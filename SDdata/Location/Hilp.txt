'''Hilp''' was a small town in southern [[Cormyr]].<ref name=FRCS1e.CR-p52> It was located on [[Calantar's Way]] between [[Immersea]] to the northeast and [[Suzail]] to the southwest. Hilp marked the western terminus of the [[Way of the Manticore]], which ran east to the town of [[Wheloon]] and beyond.

==Geography==
Hilp was surrounded by farmland and grazing pastures.<ref name=FRCS1e.CR-p52/> It was situated just north of [[Starwater River]] and just outside the southeastern edge of the [[King's Forest]].

==Government==
The lord of Hilp was [[Doon Dzavar]], a former [[merchant]]. He was not from Cormyr, but during his governance he earned positive regard from the townspeople and the [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|king]].<ref name=FRCS1e.CR-p52/> 

Doon's [[Heralds (local)|herald]] was the [[wizard]] [[Baldask Delzantar]].

==Architecture==
Hilp had many tall, narrow shops with homes above them and these were shingled with slate.<ref name=VGC-p124/>

==Trade==
Hilp was a market town for the local farmers and had thriving trades in the making of [[barrel]]s and [[wagon]]s.<ref name=FRCS1e.CR-p52/> 

A shrub known as [[stelk]] was grown commercially in Hilp as fish bait. A stelk shrub resembled a cluster of brown, fist-sized [[cabbage]] heads. Aquatic creatures, from goldfish to [[dragon turtle]]s, were unable to resist it. A species of freshwater [[electric eel]] inhabited the [[Lake of Dragons]] that could release an electrical discharge deadly to [[human]]s. Any eel eating a head of stelk was unable to use this ability for a week.

==Defenses==
In [[1357 DR]], Hilp was an unfortified town 

By [[1367 DR]], the town had defensive walls, though the buildings kept outgrowing them along the major roads.

==History==
Hilp was named after its founder, a warrior who killed or drove out the [[troll]]s that infested the area.

[[Volo]], the well-known traveler and guidebook author, provided a different historical account. He claimed Hilp was named after a Cormyrean court jester who was granted extensive farmlands at the site.

==Notable Locations==
;The Slipper Shop:
:This shop was run by a kindly, elderly, female [[elf]] who enjoyed talking to her customers about [[Myth Drannor]]. She sold perfumes, cosmetics, [[herb]]s, pomanders, and medicines. She also sold magical [[potion]]s, but only if she was asked with proper courtesy and respect. The name of her shop came from the fact that all her products were sold packed in comfortable, embroidered cloth slippers.
;Handiber's Stelk Farm:
:This farm was located to the west of Hilp at the edge of the forest and was owned by [[Handiber]], a gruff and dry-humored stelk farmer. He brought his crop into town to sell, and the strong varieties he bred commanded high prices.

==Inhabitants==
Hilp was the birthplace of [[Korth (human)|Korth]], a human [[fighter]] and sword for hire who later lived in [[Ordulin]].

Local nobility included members of the [[House Cormaeril|Cormaeril]] family.

==Rumors and Legends==
[[Orncibl Rhommd]] was a weaver of Hilp who, along with his two apprentices, claimed to have stumbled upon the location of the [[Crypt of Dragons]] in [[1356 DR]]. The Crypt was a vast subterranean tomb and shrine to the [[dragon]] [[god]] [[Null]], somewhere within a day's travel of Hilp, though the exact location was long forgotten. Orncibl said that the tomb contained several mummified dragon corpses laying upon piles of [[gold]] and [[gem]]s. Orncibl's apprentices were killed by fields of blue energy when they got too close, but Orncibl escaped. Unfortunately, he disappeared before he could reveal the cavern's whereabouts, and ever since that time, agents of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] searched the region for the entrance to the Crypt.
