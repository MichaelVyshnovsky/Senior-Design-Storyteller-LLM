'''Reddansyr''' ({{Pronounce|reh|DAHN|seer|refs=}}) was a small settlement found in the [[Dragon Coast]] region of [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]]. It had a well-earned reputation as an adventurers' town because it was a good source of information for such people.

==Geography==
The town was located at the junction between the [[Grand Ride]] and the [[Trader's Road]], along the route that connected [[Westgate]] within the cities of [[Teziir]] and [[Starmantle]].

==Trade==
Reddansyr served as a launching point for caravans heading south from the region.

==History==
In the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], hatchings of the [[black dragon]] [[Aglistralarraghautha]] destroyed much of the farmlands around Reddansyr.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Giant's Folly]], a successful and popular festhall that was built out of a boat that had been up-ended and repurposed as a tavern.
* Temple of [[Oghma]], a holy house run by [[Thyrius Jorman]] whose clergy resented the free flow of information available from the local festhall, as they preferred to gather and hoard useful information for themselves.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Ornlaugh Turghle]], a [[doppelganger]] who posed as a merchant in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/64/The Everwinking Eye: Daily Life in Mulmaster|21}}
