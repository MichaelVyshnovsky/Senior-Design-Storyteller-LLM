The Witch Fen was one a malevolent swamp located in the Feywild, formed from a river corrupted by Magra Curse-Eye and her coven of fomorian witches.
The fen could be found in the twisted region of the Feywild known as the dark fey enclave.
When the fomorian witches proved to be a grave threat to the people of New Sharandar, circa the , the Iliyanbruen elves of the settlement took swift action. Their agent Triste orchestrated a plan to bypass the defenses of several witches by using adders tongue leaves and their personal cauldrons, working alongside an adventurer from the city of Neverwinter.
The Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge was able to sabotage the cauldrons of three witches and gathered enough alchemical reagents to gain access to Magra Curse-Eye herself. The hero defeated Magra and her minions in battle, finally toppling the fomorian coven that poisoned a large swathe of Feywild land.
Beyond being the personal lair of Magra Curse-Eye, the fen was home to several other fomorian witches including Mab, Nyx, and Usha. It was overrun with their dark fey servitors, among which were scores of evil redcaps, hideous trolls, and cyclops brutes.
