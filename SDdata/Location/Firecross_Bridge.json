        "mainbody": "Firecross Bridge was a great bridge found within Mount Hotenow, originally built by the dwarves of Delzoun.While the exact origins of the bridge are not explicitly stated, the matching architecture and close proximity to Fireguard Fortress suggest that it was built around the same time.\nThe bridge was located near the ancient dwarfhold of Fireguard Fortress.\nFirecross Bridge was held by the fire giant Grumthrox and the fire archon Immolus in the , when the cult of Maegera came into conflict with the forces of Neverwinter and the dwarves of Clan Hillborn. The two cult leaders were defeated and the Hillborn expedition took control of the bridge."
