        "mainbody": "'''Brikklext''' was a hamlet located in the [[Upperdark]] under the southern foothills of the [[Earthspur Mountains]] , between [[Impiltur]] and [[the Vast]].",
        "Description": "This hamlet, unlike other [[goblin]] communities, was somewhat civilized. The tribe was ruled by a mixed council of [[blue (goblinoid)|blues]] ([[psionic]] goblins) and [[bugbear]]s, and together they managed to force the goblins out of their usual squalor and lack of perspective, guiding them into a more cohesive society.",
        "History": "The peculiarity of Brikklext was its underground water reservoir. Under the blues' direction, the goblins diverted a spring that once brought water to the surface. By digging and dam building, they redirected its waters to flood their own underground caves, creating a vast reservoir of clean drinking water.\n\nWhen their spring dried up, the surface people had to accept trade with the goblins, who began appearing everyday with loads of water [[cask]]s for sale.\n\nThe goblin \"citizens\" of Brikklext accepted civilization slowly. The idea of codified laws and a trade system was strange to them, though some understood the benefits."
