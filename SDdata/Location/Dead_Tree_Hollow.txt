'''Dead Tree Hollow''' was a [[village]] in [[the Vast]].{{Cite polyhedron/88/The Everwinking Eye: Treasures of the Vast, Part One|15}}

==Geography==
It lay on the [[North Road]] between [[Dragon Falls]] and [[Swords Pool (village)|Swords Pool]], where [[Blaern's Trail]] from [[Fallentree]] met the North Road.

==History==
A very long time before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], but still within [[elf|elven]] memory, the flying carriage of Lady [[Alauthshaee]] was attacked by [[Ilthuryn]], her scorned suitor, with his [[spell]]s. It supposedly crashed to earth within Dead Tree Hollow and Alauthshaee and her guards were subsequently buried alive. A side-effect of Ilthuryn's [[magic]] was to render the entire valley a [[dead-magic zone]].

The valley was once a camping spot for travelers on the North Road as they crossed the [[High Country]].

For many years, it was the site of an ancient and gnarled [[oak]] [[tree]], so huge that its trunk was as wide as a regular cottage. It was also hollow and a [[druid]] once lived within, until a voracious [[dragon]] (thought to be [[Halarglautha]]) burned the tree and forced him out.

The location subsequently developed into the village known as Dead Tree Hollow by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1322}}, the village was ravaged by a wandering band of [[Minotaur|minotaurs]] who swept through as they passed. Most survivors moved to [[Ravens Bluff]], with known members being the future Lord Magistrate [[Tordon Sureblade]], his half-brother Guildmaster [[Thorm Sureblade]] and their father [[Wilhelm Sureblade]]. Thorm especially gathered the survivors to ambush and revenge against these minotaurs as a great loss and Thorm's right eye.{{Cite polyhedron/148/Pillars of Ravens Bluff}}

==Description==
Dead Tree Hollow was a small valley that contained a number of ponds and wooded areas. It contained a small and sleepy village.

It was famous for its [[fern-frond soup]] and [[fiddlehead soup]] (when it was in season), as well as its exotic [[mushroom]]s that gourmets all around the [[Dragon Reach]] clamored for.

However, the entire valley was a dead-magic zone, apparently a result of Ilthuryn's spells.

===Notable Locations===
[[The Blue Stallion]] was an [[inn]] in Dead Tree Hollow. There was also a first-rate wagonworks.

A local landmark was the ancient and enormous oak tree; once it was a druid's home, but after being burned down, it was little more than a rotten stump by [[1370 DR]].

==Rumors & Legends==
The flying carriage of Lady Alauthshaee, and the great treasures within, was thought to be buried or sunk in a pond somewhere in Dead Tree Hollow. It also possibly still contained the bodies of Alauthshaee and her guards. [[Adventurer]]s occasionally came to search the valley for it.
