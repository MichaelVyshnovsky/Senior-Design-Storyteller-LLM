'''Jadaren Hold''' was a stronghold built into an extinct volcano near [[Erlkazar]].

Before it was claimed by [[Gareth Jadaren]], it was known as '''Giant's Fist''' and was home to a clan of [[dwarf|dwarves]] who carved an extensive series of tunnels and chambers under the mountain. Gareth claimed Giant's Fist in [[1461 DR]] and had his friend [[Jandi M'baren]] use the [[Rythanko]] to place powerful wards on the stronghold.
