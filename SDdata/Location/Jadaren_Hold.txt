Jadaren Hold was a stronghold built into an extinct volcano near Erlkazar.
Before it was claimed by Gareth Jadaren, it was known as Giants Fist and was home to a clan of dwarves who carved an extensive series of tunnels and chambers under the mountain. Gareth claimed Giants Fist in 1461 DR and had his friend Jandi Mbaren use the Rythanko to place powerful wards on the stronghold.
