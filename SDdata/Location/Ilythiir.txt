'''Ilythiir''' was a realm of the [[Dark elf|dark elves]] during the [[Dawn Ages]] and [[First Flowering]] (founded roughly {{Yearlink|-27000}}) before being destroyed after the [[Descent of the Drow]] following the Fourth [[Crown Wars|Crown War]].

==Geography==
Ilythiir was an expansionist country, that started in the southern jungles and spread throughout [[southern Faerûn]] during the [[Dawn Age]]. It experienced another period of expansion during the [[First Flowering]], during which it spread across the areas later known as the  [[Shaar]] and [[Forest of Amtar]].

==Inhabitants==
Ilythiir was founded by [[dark elf|dark elves]]. According to [[Ka'Narlist]], this was due to a genetic dominance of the dark elves. If the same was a measure, the dark elves derived a claim for superiority from their trait.

===Slaves===
Ilythiir was a nation that institutionalized slavery. Known slaves included [[elf|elves]], [[wemic]]s and [[minotaur]]s.

After [[Syòrpiir]], [[Eiellûr]] and [[Thearnytaar]] fell in the face of Ilythiir's strength, the [[moon elf|moon]] and [[wild elf|wild elves]] were enslaved. The aforementioned trait of the dark elves included their offsprings as dark elves in one-two generations.

Furthermore, Ilythiir was a society in which results of the research topic "creation of life" were a source of pride and they did create specific creatures to serve them. [[Athamault]] was one such research facility.{{cite book/Lost Empires of Faerûn|58}}

===Notable Inhabitants===
;[[Clan Sethomiir]]:
was the ruling House of Ilythiir. Its fiendish patron was [[Wendonai]].

;[[Clan Hune]]:
was a clan of [[Ghaunadaur]]-followers. They aided the remnants of [[Miyeritar]] of [[House Aelryth]].

;[[Ka'Narlist]]:
leader of [[Atorrnash]]

==Notable locations==
After the dark elves were banished from the sunlit realms after the [[Crown Wars]], most of the remnants of the empire were razed by [[elf|elves]] hoping to eradicate any presence of their evil cousins. The ruins of Ilythiir were the most sparse of all the ancient elf empires to survive into later ages.

;[[Athamault]]:
or the "Iron Pit" was a fortress built during the Second Crown War near the [[Lake of Steam]]. It served as a research facility for spells and the alchemical creation of life.

;[[Citadel of Slime]]:
was a cave, that functioned as a temple, and a site to conduct sacrificial rituals, to [[Ghaunadaur]].

;[[Elder Orb of Ooze]]:
was a subterranean temple to [[Ghaunadaur]]. [[Clan Hune]] built it to empower themselves but were killed by their god for some offense.

;[[Misty Vale (forest)|Misty Vale]]:
was strictly spoken not Ilythiir's territory. The [[wild elf|Wild elves]] who helped Ilythiir during the Second Crown War were granted this land.

;[[Narathmault]]:
or the "Dark Pit" was a fortress in [[Riildath]], or [[Forest of Lethyr]] and [[Rawlinswood]], built around {{Yearlink|-10400}}.

==Organizations==
The [[drow]], Ilythiir's descendants, intentionally ignore their forebears' history for it forced them to accept how much they did lose. However, there were organizations that did remember their roots:
;[[Church of Vhaeraun]]: The church of [[Vhaeraun]]'s goal was to bring the drow back to power and take back what they'd lost.

;[[Fanatics of the Overflowing Pit]]: This was an order of [[crusader]]s dedicated to [[Ghaunadaur]]. It was presumed that they survived the fall of Ilythiir and continued to exist in some fashion in [[Llurth Dreier]].

==History==
===[[Dawn age]]===
The [[elf|elves]] came to [[Toril]] via gates of the [[Fey]], around {{Yearlink|-27000}}. The [[dark elf|dark elves]] were the members of the second immigrant wave and differed from the elves of the first immigration wave, [[aquatic elf|aquatic elves]], [[avariel]]s and [[lythari]]s, It wasn’t clear how they managed it but the Ilythiiri negotiated with dragons and founded the first elven state on [[Faerûn]], Ilythiir, with the capitol of [[Atorrnash]]. 

Like all other elves during that time, the Ilythiiri didn’t have an idea that something like an [[Seldarine|elven pantheon]] existed. [[Ghaunadaur]]’s faith was a minor player but had only a small following. In Ilythiir, religious affiliation wasn’t a factor that prevented one from climbing the social ladder as proven by [[Ka'Narlist]], a follower of [[Ghaunadaur]], who managed to advance to a position like one of the leaders of Attornash.Where he was respected to foreign diplomats whom he met for the first time.

After accidentally destroying their own country around {{Yearlink|-25400}}, elves from [[Tintageer]] fled to Toril. then killing, and then taking the red dragon [[Mahatnartorian]]’s territory for themselves.

Around {{Yearlink|-25000}}, the [[Dracorage mythal]] was created as a concerted effort of elves. This act, gradually weakened the hold of the dragons and eventually lead to the end of the Time of Dragons and with it to the start of the [[First Flowering]].

Around {{Yearlink|-24500}}, [[Lolth]]’s attention was directed to Toril through the intrusion of Kethryllia into her [[Demonweb Pits]].

===[[First Flowering]]===
During the first millennium of the First Flowering, Ilythiir spread further to the south and to the east of the continent. Around the time of {{Yearlink|-23200}}, Ilythiir's territory included the [[Shaar]] and the [[Forest of Amtar]].

During this time Ilythiir was on generally good terms with the newly founded elven nations,

Around [[-18000DR]], some Ilythiiri nobles discovered [[Ghaunadaur]] as a suitable patron for them. Other evil [[deity|deities]], [[Lolth]] among them, also made inroads into the nobility of that country.

In a matter of centuries, [[Lolth]]'s machinations successfully poisoned the previously good relationships between Ilythiir and the other nations. It went to the point, that the different [[elf|elven]] subraces sought a means to get rid of [[dark elf|dark elves]]. The idea didn't revolve around killing but the creation of a dark-elf free piece of land. Among those who were excluded from the project and from the result were dark elves on their side like worshipers of Eilistraee The exclusion heightened general resentments between dark elves and others.

Around {{Yearlink|-17600}}, the [[First Sundering]] to create the aforementioned dark elf-free land was cast, the continent was destroyed as collateral damage. Among this collateral damage was [[Atorrnash]], Ilythiir's capitol. The casualties in lives were immense Conflict with the [[church of Eilistraee]] opened the path for Ghaunadaur and Lolth to become more popular.

Around {{Yearlink|-17500}}, three [[elf|elven]] realms, [[Thearnytaar]], [[Eiellûr]] and [[Syòrpiir]] made steps to unify themselves into a single nation. Ilythiir sabotaged these efforts

===[[Crown Wars]]===
The Crown Wars were a series of wars that led to the end to the [[elf|elves]]' golden age.

====Second Crown War====
In {{Yearlink|-11800}}, [[Miyeritar]] lost the First Crown War against [[Aryvandaar]].{{cite book/Lost Empires of Faerûn|52}} in {{Yearlink|-11700}}, not because they had strong relationship with Miyeritar, their relationship was thin, but because that nation was the only other one with a meaningful proportion of [[dark elf|dark elves]]. In their quest to destroy Aryvandaar's allies, Ilythiir destroyed [[Orishaar]]. That nation was an ally and major trade partner of Aryvandaar, which also lay physically the closest to Ilythiir. These successes took its own momentum and new wars like the Second Crown War were practically a foregone conclusion.

After Orishaar fell, Ilythiir isolated and burned down [[Syòrpiir]] around {{Yearlink|-11600}}. This usage of fire was considered so offensive by [[Thearnytaar]] and [[Eiellûr]], that they decided to fight Ilythiir.

At around the same time, a [[balor]] under Lolth’s employment, and bought power from the [[demon]] and with it from [[Lolth]]. It catapulted Lolth's church to importance in Ilythiir. The nation’s nobility followed their royalty’s example and bought power from other fiendish patrons. Around this time, the mind set and conduct of the Ilythiir became one that made the pretense to avenge Miyeritar sound less and less serious. Until the Fourth Crown War, apart from Lolth, [[Ghaunadaur]], [[Kiaransalee]] and [[Vhaeraun]] provided the [[dark elf|dark elves]] similar help. These kind of actions led to the Ilythiiri to gain the nickname ''dhaerow''.

The arrangement with [[fiend]]s proved itself successful. Ilythiir found itself attacked during the [[Sable Wars]], (circa {{Yearlink|-11450}}). They faced an invading force from Eiellûr and Thearnytaar, in addition to a small amount of aid provided by [[Keltormir]] and [[Shantel Othreier]], aiming to reform or conquer the [[dark elves]] before they destroyed any more realms. Over half the invading forces were wiped out by the dark elves' corrupt magic.

By {{Yearlink|-11400}}, Eiellûr was isolated and burned down like Syòrpiir. Ilythiir had help of who hoped to restore peace by appeasing the Ilythiiri. Keltomir got frightened of Ilythiir and prepared for an attack against it. The two nations skirmished along its southern and eastern borders in the following years.

====Fourth Crown War====
Around {{Yearlink|-11600}}, resistance against [[Aryvandaar]] re-flared in [[Miyeritar]].  The scale wasn't clear but Ilythiir's factions sending aid to Miyeritar's in the form of weapons, intelligence and training wasn't unheard of. 

Eventually, Miyeritar was destroyed by the [[Dark Disaster]], the suspected culprits were Aryvandaar (based on no evidence), or Miyeritar's high mages, as an accident to harness power for their resistance. Either way, Ilythiir blamed Aryvandaar and the Fourth Crown War was launched, circa {{Yearlink|-10450}}. This new wave of hostilities saw the Ilythiiri openly using the corrupt powers granted them by their dark and evil gods, namely [[Lolth]], [[Ghaunadaur]], [[Kiaransalee]] and [[Vhaeraun]].

During this war, [[Keltomir]] ceded land around {{Yearlink|-10300}} and forced Aryvandaar and Ilythiir to face each other in {{Yearlink|-10270}} over the [[Stone and Claw Campaign]], it was the first time the two nations faced each other in a military campaign.

Ilythiir attacked [[Shantel Othreier]], by that point Aryvandaar's territory. Still, elves asked the [[Seldarine]] for divine salvation.

Elves' plea were answered by {{Yearlink|-10000}}. [[Corellon]]'s magic changed the dark elves into [[drow]]. Over the course of two months, weakness against sunlight and/or the efforts of the other elven nations drove them into the [[Underdark]] and Ilythiir ended.
