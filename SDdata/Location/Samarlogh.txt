The '''Samarlogh''' was a dense jungle that covered the northern rim of [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
Enclosed by the [[Sanrach Mountains]] in the north and west, and the [[River Samar]] to the east, the Samarlogh covered much of northeastern Samarach. The jungle reached all the way to the coast of the [[Great Sea]] in the west below the mountains.

==Inhabitants==
Flocks of [[corollax]]es and large carnivorous sloths, as well as many more dangerous creatures, could be found within the jungle. Ruins from [[House Sauringar]] strongholds littered the Samarlogh.

==Rumors & Legends==
Native Samarachans told of the legend of [[Squamata the Black]], an embodiment of the encroaching jungle that swallowed everything in its path.
