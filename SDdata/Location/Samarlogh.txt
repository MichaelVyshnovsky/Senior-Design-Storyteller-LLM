The Samarlogh was a dense jungle that covered the northern rim of Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.
Enclosed by the Sanrach Mountains in the north and west, and the River Samar to the east, the Samarlogh covered much of northeastern Samarach. The jungle reached all the way to the coast of the Great Sea in the west below the mountains.
Flocks of corollaxes and large carnivorous sloths, as well as many more dangerous creatures, could be found within the jungle. Ruins from House Sauringar strongholds littered the Samarlogh.
Native Samarachans told of the legend of Squamata the Black, an embodiment of the encroaching jungle that swallowed everything in its path.
