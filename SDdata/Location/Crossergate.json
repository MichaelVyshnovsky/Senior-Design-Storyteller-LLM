        "mainbody": "Crossergate was a small town and a caravan stop on the High Road for those traveling towards the city of Triboar in the mid-14 century DR.\nCrossergate stood between the towns of Vilnask and Leilon, not far from where the road that connected Triboar with the High Road began moving east across the danger-riddled Lost Hills.\nLike many other small towns around Neverwinter, Crossergate was governed by the Lord Protector.\nThe town made business by offering goods and services and serving as a convenient resting and layover stop for caravans and travelers who traveled to or from Triboar. For its relatively small size, Crossergate had a lot of accommodations and shops that serviced the passing travelers.\nIn the , caravans that passed Crossergate began mysteriously disappear in the Lost Hills. The Lord Protector pleaded for aid to Lord Nasher Alagondar of Neverwinter, fearing for some unknown danger looming just outside the town walls. In turn, Lord Nasher tasked hired adventurers with the investigation. They discovered that whatever strange evil took residence in the Hills turned the road into a twisting and turning disorienting maze as if it was altered by magic. No maps could lead those lost among the hills to safety.\n*Crossergate Curious Items Emporium, a general and curio store in the mid-14 century DR.\n* Western Weapon Shoppe, a famed arms and armor dealer in the mid-14 century DR."
