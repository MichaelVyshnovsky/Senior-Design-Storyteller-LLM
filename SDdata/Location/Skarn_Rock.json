        "mainbody": "'''Skarn Rock''' was a tiny island just a stone's throw from the mainland of the [[Sword Coast]] near [[Baldur's Gate]] in [[West Faerûn|western Faerûn]]. Smugglers and [[pirate]]s used it as a clandestine meeting place, and it was the hub of the network of ''[[portals]]'' known as [[Lost Princess Road]].{{Cite dragon/268/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Princess Road|90}}",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The interstitial area between Skarn Rock and the shore was filled with jagged rocks that prevented safe travel by boat, but the island could be approached from the seaward side and even had a tiny cove at the northern end in which a rowboat could be moored. The surface was roughly 12 feet (3.7 meters) above high tide and constantly wet with sea spray. It was particularly hazardous in winter when ice formed. On the somewhat drier side facing the mainland were four shallow pits carved out of the stone arranged in two pairs very close together. These were the ''portals'' of Lost Princess Road."

        "History": "The pirates gave Skarn Rock its name after the body of a fellow brigand named Skarn was found dead on the island after a failed smuggling deal.{{Cite dragon/268/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Princess Road|89}}"
