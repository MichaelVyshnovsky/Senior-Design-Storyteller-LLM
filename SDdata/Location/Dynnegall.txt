Dynnegall was a small village located on the isle of Moray within the Moonshae Isles.
The village was located in north central Moray along the northeast shore of Lac Dynnegall,  south of Caer Moray.
Dynnagall was named for a former king of the island. The villages location on the lake and near the Breasal Marsh provided it with an excellent source of peat for heating and of kryne, a nutritious plant.
The village had a bloody history, having been completely wiped out several times by monsters. Attacks from the Black Blood Tribe occurred several times per year. Soldiers stationed here often came away with many stories of their heroics, assuming they survived.
