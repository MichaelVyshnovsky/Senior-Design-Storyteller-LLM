Xantharls Keep was a fortified village south of Mirabar. As of 1370 DR, it was home to a population of 475. It was known for its tall stone houses with steep roofs.
As its name suggested, Xantharls Keep featured a central keep, its surrounding village and a fortified wall.
During the late 15 century DR, the keeps lordship was served Narbeck Horn, who  in turn reported to the marchion of Mirabar, by means of a sending stone.
The keep was protected by 150 defenders, over twice the population of the accompanying village.
A number of heavy crossbows were mounted upon its outer wall.
Some time after the War of the Silver Marches, the Frost giant Kaltivar laid siege to the keep with a small army of goblins, hobgoblins, and ogres equipped with goblin-huckers. The giant used the siege as a ruse while he sent a gang of Bugbears to find and capture the wanted shield dwarf criminal Worvil Forkbeard, who was hiding within the Falling Orc inn.
