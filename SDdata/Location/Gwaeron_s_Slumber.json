        "mainbody": "Gwaerons Slumber was a sacred forest located west of Triboar in the Dessarin Valley. It was a place of reverence for worshipers of Gwaeron Windstrom, the god of tracking, and the followers of Mielikki, the goddess of the forests. \nMuch of Gwaerons Slumber was ruled by autumn, with leaves of yellow, orange, and red, and this remained unchanged by the passing of the seasons. Despite its sacred status, there was no actual shrine here.\nIt was widely believed that Gwaeron himself visited the wood so that he might sleep within its leafy fastnesses. Hence, when he was seen, he was usually walking the land around Triboar and going in and out of the forest. Thus, bustling Triboar was nicknamed the \"Town Where Only Gwaeron Sleeps\". Witnesses reported seeing him roam amidst the trees, appearing as a tall and well-muscled man with long white hair and beard blowing in a wind, even if there was none. He did not manifest to those who came looking for him, but only when not expected and only rarely.\nThe faithful of Mielikki, and later those of Gwaeron too, believed that if they slept in the forest they would receive dreams of prophecy, hinting at what their deity desired of them. Rangers that followed Mielikki visited the forest to pray and later those that followed either deity came to search for inspiration. Those who were not rangers would suddenly learn the skills of tracking just like real rangers, but only for the day, and only once in their life. Many Gwaeronans tried to make a pilgrimage there at least once in their lives.\nThe Lord Protector of Triboar forbade anyone from hunting wildlife or woodcutting in this forest for fear of angering Gwaeron.\nthumb|center|1000px|The mural around the base of the stage in the Triboar playhouse, including Gwaeron on his seat.\nIn the late 15 century DR, an oni who resided in a  hillside cave further to the west of Triboar sometimes came here to hunt the rangers who went to sleep at Gwaerons Slumber. It disguised itself as Gwaeron before attacking its awed prey. Afterward, it fastidiously cleaned up, leaving little to no trace of itself or its victim. The disappearances gave life to a new belief that Gwaeron was spiriting away his worshipers to his divine realm."
