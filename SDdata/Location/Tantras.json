        "History": {
            "Time of Troubles": "[[Image:Tantras.PNG|thumb|250px|''A map of Tantras in 1358 DR.'' (1) Tantras Harbor <W>, (2) The Sea Tower <W>, (3) The The Market, (4) The [[Temple of Torm's Coming]] <N>, (5) The Great Bell <nowiki><S>, (6) Fountain of the Mermaid</nowiki>]]\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], [[skeleton]]s rose from their graves to take over the neighboring town of [[Hlintar]]. Refugees from Hlintar and other chaos-stricken areas fled to Tantras and other Vast cities.\n\nThe [[god]] [[Torm|Torm the True]] manifested in the city of Tantras and took up residence there, making the city famous. Meanwhile, led by their [[Dunn Tenwealth|heretical high priest]], his faithful persecuted those of other gods, labeling them as \"unbelievers\" in a display of religious bigotry.\n\nDuring this, Tantras prepared for war against the forces of [[Zhentil Keep]], which followed close behind their god [[Bane|Bane the Black Lord]]. The [[Guard (Tantras)|\"Guard\"]] of Tantras mobilized, commandeering privately owned homes by the coast, as well as a number of inns (including the [[Roaring Lion Inn]] and [[Gulder's Good Grub Inn]]), for use as barracks. Meanwhile, the Tantran navy seized the [[Green Sirene]] as a barracks and recruiting post. [[Halemar's Fine Blades]], an armorer and weaponsmith, was kept very busy crafting materiel for the war effort, while [[Muldiver|Muldiver the Shipwright]] readied the ships.\n\nTorm eventually discovered the crimes of his priests and punished them for it. Then the god Bane arrived to take one of the [[Tablets of Fate]], which he'd hidden in the city. In a titanic battle in the harbor, Torm fought Bane, and absorbed the souls of thousands of his willing faithful there to strengthen himself.\n\nIn the end, both gods slew one another, and left parts of the city destroyed, depopulated, and in a massive [[dead-magic zone]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades}}\n\nLater, looting mobs of refugees from Tantras and other cities suffering strife wandered the Vast. Meanwhile, in the southern Vast, many wealthy merchants of [[Procampur]] and [[Tsurlagol]] fled to their country houses in the town of [[Maerstar]]. However, they were harassed by the mobs, who'd also come through Maerstar, and some were killed.\n\nDespite the devastation, Tantras made a good recovery after the Time of Troubles, and even prospered. The destruction was almost fully repaired well before [[1372 DR]]. The overhauled and chastised faith of Torm became very tolerant and indulgent of the other faiths in the city.",
            "Recent history": "With the [[Horde Wars]] in [[east Faerûn|east]] and [[Northeast Faerûn|northeastern Faerûn]] over [[1359 DR|1359]]–[[1360 DR]], the [[Tuigan Horde]] was expected to overrun [[Thesk]] and [[Impiltur]] and then the Vast, before continuing east. Thus, King [[Azoun IV]] of [[Cormyr]] called for a crusade against the Tuigan Horde in the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]]. Tantras was among those free cities that sent envoys to Azoun's council on [[Tarsakh 10]], and contributed 1,600 well-trained volunteer soldiers, as well as wizards, to the crusade.\n\nAfter three years of Kaverin Ebonhand attempting to revenge himself upon Artus Cimber and Hydel Pontifax, and them thwarting his schemes and disposing of his agents, things finally came to a head in 1360 DR. Kaverin slipped up and was caught in a tavern in the open without his bodyguards by Artus and Hydel, and Hydel blew him to bits with a ''[[lightning bolt]]'' spell. However, since they'd used magic and neglected to call in the watch, the city authorities charged the pair with murder and a dozen other offenses. Artus and Hydel escaped, and were forced to avoid Tantras for at least the next three years. Meanwhile, Kaverin made a deal with [[Cyric]], the then Lord of the Dead, gaining his life back in order to spread chaos and strife.\n\nKaverin Ebonhand remained mostly in the safety of Tantras, protected by the [[Cult of Frost]], which he'd seized control of. Finally, in the [[1363 DR|Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR]], Kaverin Ebonhand and the [[Mulhorand]]i mage [[Phyrra al-Quim]] and their minions left the city to hunt for the famed ''[[Ring of Winter]]'' in [[Chult]], following Artus Cimber and Hydel Pontifax themselves. On the ship ''[[Narwhal (galleon)|Narwhal]]'', travelling from [[Baldur's Gate]] to Chult, Kaverin and Phyrra, masqueraded as Tantrasan ambassadors to keep Artus and Hydel from investigating for fear of being arrested or tried on the spot. Regardless, Artus finally slew Kaverin in Chult with the power of the ''ring''.\n\nTantras was among those areas covered by the [[Tyrantfog]] of 9–11 [[Mirtul]] of the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]]. Under the fog, [[Cyric]] worshipers were afflicted with terrible diseases, while followers of [[Iyachtu Xvim]] were strengthened. Finally, items and beings filled with Bane's power were destroyed, and [[banelich]]es hidden in Tantras exploded. The Tyrantfog then burned away in green flame.\n\nLater that year, following her war against [[Ravens Bluff]], [[Myrkyssa Jelan]] reappeared with another army, likely the remnants or reserves of her first, and this time marched on Tantras. She demanded the city's surrender, else she'd raze it to the ground. The Tantran High Council met with the Warlord, and they came to some agreement. The terms of this were unknown, but Jelan's army withdrew without attacking. Tantras had requested aid from [[Procampur]] and Ravens Bluff, but by the time this arrived, Jelan's army had faded into the mountains.\n\nLater in 1370 DR, Ravens Bluff proposed the formation of a regional government in the Vast, but Tantras strongly rejected the proposal.",
            "Post-Spellplague": "A regional government was eventually formed in the Vast, as the formerly independent city-states of Calaunt, Ravens Bluff, and Tantras united in the nation of [[Vesperin]]. It was still a young nation by [[1479 DR]]. Tantras was named its capital.It is unknown exactly when the unification into Vesperin occurred between 1372 DR and 1479 DR."
        },
        "Demographics": "In [[1358 DR]], the city had an estimated population of around 69,000 people. This could rise to ~86,000 in the summer. However, the city had space to comfortably house up to 89,000. In [[1372 DR]], Tantras was listed with a population of 21,816, making it the fourth-largest city in the Vast.The [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' (3rd edition)]] saw widespread, significant population reductions, though it is not clear why. The larger figure of 69,000 may refer to the population of the surrounding land that Tantras controls, while 21,816 may only be those people within the city itself.''\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], Tantras had a population of around 23,000.",
        "Government": {
            "Relations": "Tantras was one of the five so-called \"sister cities\" of the Vast, together with [[Calaunt]], [[Procampur]], [[Ravens Bluff]], and [[Tsurlagol]]. Ravenians liked to think of Tantras as their city's \"dark twin\", though Tantrans thought otherwise. Either way, Tantras was one of the leading cities of the Vast by [[1372 DR]].\n\nBy [[1479 DR]], Tantras had united with Calaunt and Ravens Bluff in the nation of Vesperin. Tantras, as part of Vesperin, remained neutral with regard to international politics.",
            "Law & Order": "The High Council endeavored to go unnoticed as a government and to make few restrictions on citizens. Being composed of merchant houses, it focused mainly on setting tariffs, making laws that regulated trade, and making business easy for merchants. It cared less about the actions of thieves' guilds and adventurers unless they impacted on mercantile interests. What people did outside business was their own affair. As a result, Tantras was a boisterous, almost lawless, wide-open city. Only the more extreme crimes and breaches of courtesy would get the Guard involved. The Guard under Lassalar Ormitar was more serious about limiting merchant freedoms in favor of law and order. The harbor was strictly policed.\n\nHowever, Tantras cracked down hard on smuggling and piracy, those crimes that most affected trade, and judges were rarely lenient in these cases. Smugglers had their illicit goods confiscated and were fined to the same value, while repeat offenders were typically executed. Pirates were sentenced to death by drowning, being tied to heavy stones and dumped in the Dragon Reach. Nevertheless, Tantras did not worry overmuch about piracy unless one of its own ships was involved."
        },
        "Armed forces": "The armed forces of the city were called simply the [[Guard (Tantras)|\"Guard\"]], and had the duty of both defending the city and policing it. Just after the [[Time of Troubles]] in 1358 DR, the Guard was commanded by [[Lassalar Ormitar]], a member of the Council. Although the Guard was directly responsible to the Council, their loyalties lay with Lassalar, who was more serious about restricting merchant freedoms in favor of law and order.\n\nThe Guard consisted of about 900 male and female [[fighter]]s. [[Generic Guard man-at-arms (Tantras)|Regular troops]], who patrolled in units of fourteen, were outfitted in [[plate mail]] armor and carried [[spear]]s, [[short sword]]s, and [[dagger]]s. Patrols were led by \"longswords\", or [[Generic Guard sergeant (Tantras)|sergeants]], who carried [[longsword]]s and [[mace]]s. When multiple units were involved, they took orders from [[Generic Guard officer (Tantras)|officers]], who wielded maces, [[morningstar]]s, or short swords. [[Crossbow]]men and [[wizard]]s were called in emergencies. Thirty-strong garrisons of crossbowmen mainly guarded the harbor and manned the [[ballista]] batteries there.\n\nTantras also had a reserve militia of about 6,000 that could be called up when needed. However, these were mostly not professionals but folk who had other jobs and thus they were considered poor-quality troops.\n\nTantras was also home to the [[Trueblades]], a Torm-worshiping [[crusader]] order. The Trueblades performed damage control during warfare and disasters, such as after the cataclysmic battle between the gods Torm and Bane in 1358 DR.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades}}\n\nAs the city-state had little outside territory to defend, Tantras's naval forces were few. Nevertheless, the city maintained almost half-a-dozen warships in case it had need of them.",
        "Coat of Arms": "The heraldic coat of arms of the city of Tantras showed a curling silver ocean wave (a breaker) surmounted by three silver stars, on a field of royal blue.",
        "Economy & Trade": "Tantras was a busy port city, humming with industry yet characterized by diligent entrepreneurs among its ruling merchant families. The people were prosperous and wealthy, from nobles to common folk.\n\nIt was made popular for trade by the many cargo-lifting cranes in the harbor, which provided the ability to move large amounts of freight in and out quickly. These cranes had been installed by the [[House of Skilled Hands|temple of Gond]], which received a [[copper piece]] for every load lifted. They were recent inventions by the mid-1300s, and were also in use in [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Scardale]] and other ports. The heavy policing and defenses of the harbor area also made the port desirable to merchant shipping.\n\nShops in Tantras had an excellent range of products, much more than normally available on this stretch of the Dragon Reach, though the selection was reduced in a hard winter. In particular, they had quality [[wine]]s and a wide variety of ornaments and novelties and rare items.\n\nTantras's own products included crates, wagons, locks, wrought-iron hardware, and building parts like carved wooden window casements, posts, and railings. The city also produced locally caught [[fish]], including the spiced and pickled \"[[Tantran finefish]]\".",
        "Culture & Society": {
            "14th century": "Although it had grown wealthy and proud on the back of its trade, Tantras remained an active and dynamic city, not one set in its ways or fallen to decadence. It could be described it as ever-changing. The city was dominated by the entrepreneurs of the merchant families and by the priests of its many temples. The city was home to major temples of [[Lathander]], [[Gond]], [[Selûne]], [[Milil]], [[Tempus]], [[Torm]], and [[Tymora]], with smaller shrines to [[Cyric]], [[Loviatar]], [[Umberlee]], and [[Waukeen]] also present.\n\nTantras was indeed dominated by religion, particularly that of [[Torm|Torm the True]], the [[paladin]] god of duty, loyalty, and obedience. The Tormite faith was always popular among Tantrans, and remained so after the Time of Troubles, when the god himself gave his life to defend the city from [[Bane|Bane, the Lord of Darkness]] (despite the destruction and loss of life their battle wrought on the city). Torm was venerated as the savior of Tantras even after he was restored to life. The [[Temple of Torm's Coming]] was the most successful, dominant, and influential church in the city, and led the spiritual and social life of its citizens. The high priest even had a seat on the governing High Council.\n\nThis influence was not always to the best, however. During the Troubles, the church of Torm, under a [[Dunn Tenwealth|heretical high priest]], took to persecuting \"unbelievers\" — those who held to other faiths — in a show of religious intolerance. Temples of the other faiths suffered harshly under this regime, with some even destroyed. However, Torm's condemnation of the heretics' behavior and subsequent reforms saw the temple much more indulgent of the other religions. Nevertheless, this period harmed Tantras's reputation. Many rural inhabitants of the Vast felt Tantras was overly dominated by religion, a \"god-ridden\" place home to suspicious and unfriendly people, namely the Tormites.\n\nThe city was however a haven for many adventurers and a sanctuary for folk fleeing dangerous wizards and groups like the [[Zhentarim]] of [[Zhentil Keep]] and the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]]. This was thanks to the merchant lords' light rule, the successful thieves' guild, the numerous priests, and especially the large dead-magic zone.\n\nOwing to the presence of the large dead-magic zone and the associated difficulty of casting [[spell]]s around the city, few wizards chose to establish themselves in Tantras after the Time of Troubles. Those who did learned to be cunning and to hide their Art from others. They developed a natural sensitivity to magic, automatically sensing a nearby aura roughly one-third of the time, though not to identify or locate it. However, they also had to learn highly precise and taxing spellcasting techniques. This made them somewhat slow to react and cast spells.\n\nTantran warriors were typically more cosmopolitan than their peers, usually knowing another language. Furthermore, owing to the many priests in the city, they were well versed in a particular Faerûnian religion. However, following the appearance of the dead-magic zone, they grew lax in their defenses against magic, and thus more vulnerable.\n\n[[Rogue]]s and [[thief|thieves]] of Tantras had no special character distinct from their trade and nationality, but most were members of the resident thieves' guild, the [[Grayclaws]]. Those who were not and did not come to some arrangement with the guild found their careers cut suddenly short.",
            "15th century": "In the 15th century [[DR]], as capital city of Vesperin, Tantras was no longer so changeable or flexible. Instead, it had developed a highly structured society, with rigid class divisions and hierarchies, along social, economic, and political lines. Signs of such social hierarchy manifested in the price of goods in shops and of housing, and in the business and residential districts.\n\nThe rich upper class enjoyed ostentatious displays of their wealth, particularly in the ornamentation and unnecessary decorations that were everywhere in the city. Expensive gold leaf covered furniture, carriages, and even architectural features, and so were a common target of thieves. Thus the wealthy hired private guards, militias, and small armies for the defense of their homes."

        "Organizations": "The [[Grayclaws]] were an effective [[thieves]]' [[guild]] composed of thieves and smugglers. Loyal to Tantras, they operated mostly only against visitors and those Tantran natives that they felt deserved it, ''i.e.'', the very rich, the arrogant, and the immoral. At one time or another, they defended their city against outside factions attempting to muscle into the underworld, including the [[Cult of the Dragon]], the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]], the [[Zhentarim]] of [[Zhentil Keep]], [[Inner Sea]] pirates sponsored by [[Calishite]] slavers, and even the [[Harpers]]. Around 1358 DR, the Grayclaws were led by [[Amlithor Harlguss]] and [[Othniir Xalast]]. The Grayclaws were named for the claw-like [[grayclaws (weapon)|weapons they favored]], which made them dangerous in a fight and skilled climbers.\n\nThe [[Harpers]] had a strong presence in Tantras, and they had the support and guidance of the Happy House of Splendor and Song, the local temple of [[Milil]]. and the mage [[Tarntassa]] was a Harper friend. For the most part, the Harpers largely left the [[Grayclaws]] thieves’ guild alone, owing to the Grayclaws' proven ability to keep their common enemies out of Tantras.\n\nAn organization of [[beguiler]]s jointly devoted to the goddess [[Leira]], Lady of Deception, and to the god [[Mask]], Lord of Shadows, was once based in Tantras, out of the hidden [[Halls of Demarch]].
