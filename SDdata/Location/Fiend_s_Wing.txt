}}The '''Fiend's Wing''' was a large province of the [[Yikarian Empire]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{Cite dragon/241/Campaign Classics: The Roof of the World}}

==Geography==
This section of the Empire was found at a narrow section of the [[World Pillar Mountains]] that separated the jungles of the east from the barbarian lands of the west. The province sprawled from the mountains into the lowlands as it ran south for several hundred miles before reaching the border of the [[Bronze Falcon]].

==Inhabitants==
The powerful [[Cloud Wizard]] ruled this province with the help of [[marrash]] allies.

==Activities==
Given its location, Fiend's Wing served to protect the heart of the Empire from any threats to the northeast and east.
