'''High Hedge''' was the home of the [[wizard]] [[Thalantyr]], which was situated northwest of [[Beregost]].

==Structure==
Thalantyr the Conjurer's estate was a dark, turreted stone building overgrown with pines. It overlooked a pond, which the wizard used to sit near and speak to something beneath the surface.

==Defense==
The house was defended by two [[griffon]]s, who were a mating pair and strongly loyal to Thalantyr. His home was also protected by an [[Invisibility|invisible]] servant, who was known to spy and deliver information and objects to the wizard.
