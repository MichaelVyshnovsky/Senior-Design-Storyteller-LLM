The Furdah Rustauk District was district in Dhaztanar, Semphar that lay along Gbor Nor and including the harbors.
The walls surrounding Furdah Rustauk were the oldest in the city, sitting in a state of disrepair. Mud brick was used in their construction, which weathered over time.
The entire southwestern section of Furdah Rustauk touched the shore of Gbor Nor. Much of the northern border of the district abutted the walls of the vast Madinat. Both the northwest and northeast corners of the district bordered the Shari-Souk District.
Many canals ran from the harbor to the rest of the city, feeding small boats that carried cargo and passengers from the larger ships that sat at anchor.
