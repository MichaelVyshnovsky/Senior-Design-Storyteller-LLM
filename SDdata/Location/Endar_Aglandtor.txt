'''Endar Aglandtor''' (the "Sword Grotto") was an abbey dedicated to the [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[deity]] [[Haela Brightaxe]], and the chapter house of the militant religious group [[Haela's Host]].

==Geography==
The Sword Grotto was built into a series of dwarf-dug caves at the base of the [[Tor of Swords]], a [[granite]] hill near one of the most northeasterly "loops" of the [[Winding Water]], on [[Pelleor's Prairie]] and south of the [[Marsh of Chelimber]].{{Cite web/Map of Faer√ªn 5th edition}}

==History==
At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1}}, a quintet of [[magic]]al swords associated with the [[Netheril|Netherese]] successor realm of [[Anauria]] was entombed within the Tor of Swords, lending the hill its name.

When the [[cleric]]s and [[crusader]]s of Haela's Host settled beneath the Tor, they found these fabled blades and gave them to their most able swordswomen. Striking out from their isolated abbey, the warriors of Haela Brightaxe were very effective in culling the monstrous population of nearby areas like the [[Serpent Hills]], the [[Battle of Bones]], the [[Forest of Wyrms]], and the Marsh of Chelimber.

==Rumors & Legends==
Because most tales confused the Tor of Swords with the nearby [[Dungeon of Swords]] in the [[High Moor]], Endar Aglandtor was rarely visited by [[adventurer]]s.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* Blade of the Crimson Axe [[Aglaya Rockfist]], leader of [[Haela's Host]] ''circa'' 1371 DR.
