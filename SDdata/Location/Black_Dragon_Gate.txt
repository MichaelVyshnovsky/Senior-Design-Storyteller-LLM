The Black Dragon Gate, also known as the Landward Gate, was the grand northward gate that allowed passageway through the northern wall of Baldurs Gate. It also segregated the Outer City slums of Blackgate, from the entirety of the Upper City.
The gate earned its name from the large stone sculpture of a black dragon head that loomed over the inner side of the wall. The stone statue of the dragons head was actually constructed in honor of a real black dragon that was slain by a knight and whose head had been proudly displayed in the exact same location.
Each morning, laborers and peddlers traveling along the Trade Way would wait in the streets outside the Black Dragon Gate, in order to enter into, or pass through, the city at dawn. Each individual passing through the Black Dragon Gate was required to pay 2 cp, and an additional fee if they were selling goods at a stall in the Wide.
All of the goods brought in by parcel, handcart or wheelbarrow were inspected by members of the Watch.
