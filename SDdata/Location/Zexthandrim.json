        "mainbody": "Zexthandrim was an ancient kobold kingdom that was destroyed by the forces of Imaskar.\nZexthandrim was famous for the gold and gems they mined. After the Imaskari enslaved them in , they demanded yearly tribute in this form. However, the kobolds chose to withhold their choicest gemstones, eventually provoking Imaskar into an attack upon their vassal kingdom that came in . The attack was carried out by a force of golems of two types portal golems, whose chests held a portal, and smaller but incredibly strong shepherd golems, which could chase the kobolds in their own tunnels, herd them towards the portal golems, and finally throw them through the golem portals. The kobolds of Zexthandrim were all cast into an unknown doom that way.\nThe golems were left in Zexthandrim, and they continued to fulfill their original orders in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. The kobolds had also created dozens of cleverly built death traps, including collapsing ceilings, explosive devices, and other cruel contraptions in the crudely hewn tunnels to better safeguard their treasures. The gnomes of nearby Songfarla had begun keeping guard over the location to prevent others from encountering the same fate.\nIn , the Brightsmith dwarves came across the ancient ruin of Zexthandrim more than a dozen dwarves died exploring the empire, before their queen declared it off-limits."
