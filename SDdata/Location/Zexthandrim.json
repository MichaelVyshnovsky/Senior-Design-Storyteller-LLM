        "History": "Zexthandrim was famous for the [[gold]] and [[gem]]s they mined. After the [[Imaskari]] enslaved them in {{yearlink|-7891}},{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|19}} they demanded yearly tribute in this form. However, the kobolds chose to withhold their choicest gemstones, eventually provoking Imaskar into an attack upon their vassal kingdom that came in {{yearlink|-7403}}.{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|54}} The attack was carried out by a force of [[golem]]s of two types: portal golems, whose chests held a portal, and smaller but incredibly strong shepherd golems, which could chase the kobolds in their own tunnels, herd them towards the portal golems, and finally throw them through the golem portals. The kobolds of Zexthandrim were all cast into an unknown doom that way.",
        "Description": "The golems were left in Zexthandrim, and they continued to fulfill their original orders in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The kobolds had also created dozens of cleverly built death traps, including collapsing ceilings, explosive devices, and other cruel contraptions in the crudely hewn tunnels to better safeguard their treasures. The gnomes of nearby [[Songfarla]] had begun keeping guard over the location to prevent others from encountering the same fate.\n\nIn {{yearlink|1374}}, the [[Brightsmith]] [[dwarves]] came across the ancient ruin of Zexthandrim; more than a dozen dwarves died exploring the empire, before their queen declared it off-limits.{{Cite web enhancement/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|8}}"
