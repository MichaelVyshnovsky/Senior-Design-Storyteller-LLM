        "Geography": "Manass was located in northern [[Khazari]] along a pass found halfway up the [[Katakoro Shan]] mountains.",
        "Description": "Though small by most standards, Manass was heavily guarded against attack from outside forces. Manass was roughly square-shaped, with each side measuring nearly half a mile. The streets were arranged in a grid facing the cardinal directions.\n\nAll of the buildings of Manass were made from carefully stacked stone that was plastered with mud then white-washed.\n\nFields of [[barley]] and millet surrounded the land around Manass.",
        "History": "Manass's fortifications were built to protect against invasion from [[Kao Dynasty]] [[Shou Lung]] during the 600s [[DR]]. Throughout the years, it was destroyed several times but was always rebuilt.\n\nManass was conquered by [[Yamun Khahan]]'s [[Grand Army of the Tuigan|Horde]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR.",
        "Defenses": "City walls that stood 30 ft. (9 m) high helped protect Manass. Guard towers which overhung the walls were placed evenly around the city, allowing archers to rain arrows down upon enemies below. The Jade Gate and Stone Gate were the only entrances through the walls.\n\nA militia of 5,000 soldiers protected Manass, made of 2,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry.",
        "Inhabitants": "Since the threat of invasion was always high, all of the citizens of Manass lived within the protection of the city walls.\n\nBefore the conquest of the [[Tuigan]], Manass was ruled by [[Sanjar al-Mulk]]. [[Jadaran]] was given charge of the city after the conquest."
