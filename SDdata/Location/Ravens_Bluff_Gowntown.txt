The '''Gowntown''' neighborhood of [[Ravens Bluff]] was a wealthy and important part of the city's [[Temple District (Ravens Bluff)|Temple District]], 

The neighborhood garnered its name, "Gowntown", from the great number of [[priest]]s and [[cleric]]s found about town, walking to and from their residences and nearby places of worship.

==Notable locations==
;Businesses and Shops:
*[[Glar Maru's Golden Palace]]: This four-story emporium bought any and all sorts of items from local Ravenians for mere [[cp|coppers]], and re-sold them secondhand. 

;Civic Offices:
*[[Hangman's Courthouse]]: Named for the deceased judge that literally made the building his home, this courthouse handled trials for crimes committed within the city's Temple District.

;Guildhalls:

;Inns, Taverns and Restaurants:
*[[Phoaraudo's]]: Just as pretentious as it was popular, this high-end restaurant was constantly packed with idle customers that spent more time talking than eating. 

;Landmarks:
*[[Golden Rooster Roost]] & [[Rooster Fitness & Training Center]]: The Roost was a splendid inn that had been converted to accommodate the [[Knights of the Golden Rooster]]; their training facility was full of sparring gear, dummies and wooden weapons that allowed them, or any Ravenian knights, to hone their martial prowess. 
*[[Hawksblood Hall]]: Fronting on [[Hawk Passage]], this diminutive castle served as the "secret" headquarters of the city's [[Knights of the Hawk]].

;Merchant houses:
*[[Doumath House]]: The traders in this mercantile house were well-known woodcarvers and furniture-makers. 
*[[Glimmertree House]]: An up-and-coming group of traders, as of 1370 DR, this group of lumberers and miners sought to tap into the natural resources of [[the Vast]].  
*[[Talking Skull House]]: This merchant house set up shop within this building shortly before the year [[1370 DR]], replacing the old [[Abluuder's Everything Emporium]].
*[[Telsark's House]]: Located on the corner of [[Cylyria Street]] and [[Blacktree Boulevard]], this sophisticated brownstone headquartered the jewelry business of the dashing [[Agulustor Telsark]].

;Residences:

*[[Palraedinor Manor]]: The [[Palraedinor]]s maintained residence within this stately, blue-stone building. 
*[[Rashala's Towers]] & [[Windstand House]]: These neighboring manors were rebuilt by the Ampners as a set of rental apartments, connected by a set of two-story bridged suites. 
*[[Seiringlast House]]: Yet another Ampner property, this manor was rumored to contain the hidden treasures and wealth of the long-dead [[mage]] [[Seiringlast]], after whom the structure was named. 
*[[Yarnar Close]]: Housing the noble [[Yarnar]] family, this manor was decorated by a statue that came to be called the ''[[Vigilant Ravenian]]'', a masterpiece created by the famous, and deceased, sculptor [[Indrii]].
