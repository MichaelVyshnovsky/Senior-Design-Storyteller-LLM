The '''Coast Way crossing''' was a point where the [[Coast Way]] crossed the [[Winding Water]].

==Geography==
The crossing was located some ways east of the [[Coast Way forest]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Auchlin Deepvein]] undertook a dig at the site of the crossing. His efforts were thwarted by a [[Gurn Coldhearth|dwarf]] from [[Clan Coldhearth]] who had underwent [[lich]]dom.

During the [[War of the Shining Crusade]] the bridge at the crossing was destroyed by a panicked [[Shining Crusade]] [[mage]]. This disaster forced a contingent of [[Flaming Fist]] soldiers to reroute to [[Boareskyr Bridge]] in order rally with the rest of the [[Coalition]] forces.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Sterling Silver Inn]]: This cozy establishment was run by the [[halfling]] man [[Takos]] and his wife.
