        "mainbody": "'''Soorenar''' was a city-state located on the western coast of the [[Bay of Chessenta]] that headed the [[Northern Alliance]], one of the three most powerful alliances in [[Chessenta]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nFollowing the events of the [[Spellplague]], the city was destroyed, and the flooded ruins came to be known as '''Drowned Soorenar''' during the 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "Description": "Prior to its destruction, the city of Soorenar was a large, mercantile metropolis\n\nAfter its destruction, the ruined city sat submerged and abandoned, and only the tallest of Soorenar's buildings broke the waterline. Hardly any trace remained of the old inhabitants save for rumors of their wealth still lying underwater.",
        "Geography": "Soorenar was located on the coast of the Bay of Chessenta at the delta of the [[River Akax]], which split the city into East Soorenar&mdash;where the docks, warehouses, and amenities for mercenaries were located&mdash;and the well-defended West Soorenar&mdash;where most of the city's residents lived. Its location made it one of the primary Chessentan ports on the [[Inner Sea]].\n\nFollowing the lowering of the Inner Sea as a result of the Spellplague and the opening of the [[Underchasm]], the Bay of Chessenta shrank, thus leaving Drowned Soorenar fairly far inland along the River Akax on very the eastern edge of the newly formed [[Lake Akax]].{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|72}}\n\n[[Mudmen]] were known to be especially numerous in the shallow waters north of the city.",
        "Government": "Prior to its destruction, the city operated under a variant of the legal system known as the [[Code of Enlil]], which allowed accused criminals to defend themselves before a jury and held that crimes committed to stop greater crimes were blameless. \n\nThe city was ruled by a triumvirate of lords, and any decision that affected Soorenar had to be agreed upon by all three of them. Each of these rulers represented one of Soorenar's three most powerful noble families: the [[Thurik]]s, [[Yashur]]s, and [[Brolkchant]]s. These families traced their lineage back to the three families who founded the city, and were related to the ruling families of [[Luthcheq]].",
        "Trade": "Most of Soorenar's food came from the fertile [[Akanul]] region, and agricultural goods from the Akanul also passed through the port on they way to other destinations. Farmlands on the outskirts of the city also grew some produce, such as [[turnip]]s. \n\nUnlike some other ports on the Inner Sea, the city had no notable relationship with the undersea nations of [[Serôs]].\n\nThe city hosted a notable [[Thayan enclave]].",
        "Defenses": "As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Soorenar wielded its wealth as a weapon, hiring mercenaries and spellcasters to do their dirty work. Even so, it boasted a navy and an army of 5,000&mdash;made up of 3,000 infantry, 1,000 cavalry, and 1,000 archers&mdash;which could easily be boosted to as many as 15,000 by hiring mercenaries and conscripting citizens and [[slave]]s. Like most city-states in Chessenta, Soorenar had a 3-year cache of food preserved by [[magic]] for use in case of war.\n\nThe city was allied with [[Mordulkin]], [[Airspur (Chessenta)|Airspur]], and Luthcheq&mdash;although their willingness to employ [[wizard]]s sometimes put them in conflict with Luthcheq. Ports under the protection of Soorenar generally greeted such pirates with a wizard lobbing ''[[fireball]]s''.",
        "History": "Soorenar was founded after Chessenta gained its independence from [[Unther]] in the {{YearlinkName|929}},{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|75}} by the three families whose armies were said to have driven the Untherites out. Until the {{YearlinkName|1117}}, Soorenar belonged to the Chessentan Empire, founded by the \"Invincible Warrior\" [[Tchazzar]]. \n\nIn the years following the empire's collapse, Soorenar's alliances and enemies were constantly shifting. For example, they allied with [[Akanax]] at the [[Siege of Cimbar]] in the {{YearlinkName|1154}}&mdash;the outcome of which was to greatly reduce [[Cimbar]]'s power in the region&mdash;but also waged a notable war against Akanax in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}, which left Akanax in ruins. In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Soorenar allied with Airspur to attack Cimbar, set on dividing the city between them, although Soorenar began to fare poorly in this war.\n\nIn the decade that followed, Soorenar would ally with Airspur in another war against Akanax, which was complicated by attacks on their mercenaries by the [[City of the Werecrocodiles]] in the [[Adder Swamp]].{{Cite polyhedron/108/Forgotten Deities: Sebek|4}} By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Soorenar had a reputation for aggressive rulers who preferred to purchase victories rather than fight for them.\n\nOn [[Nightal 1]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Tchazzar returned to Chessenta in his true form: the [[red dragon]] [[chosen]] of [[Tiamat]]. He first appeared above an ongoing naval conflict between Soorenar and Cimbar, and proceeded to annihilate both fleets. In the wake of this attack, Tchazzar seized control of Cimbar and used it as a base to grow the [[Church of Tchazzar|religion dedicated to himself]]. As he attempted to spread his influence, Soorenar was at the forefront of efforts to oppose him. They engaged in secret negotiations with Cimbar while hiring mercenaries to fight them. They were also rumored to be offering an enormous bounty to any who could provide them with powerful spells to contain the dragon, such as those developed by [[Sammaster]] during the recent [[Rage of Dragons]].\n\n[[File:Adder Swamp 4e.JPG|thumb|''A map showing \"Drowned\" Soorener as of 1480 DR.'']]Much of Chessenta was devastated during the events of the Spellplague and the violent arrival of [[Akanûl]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, and Soorenar was no exception. Amidst earthquakes and cataclysms, water swept into the city and reduced it to a flooded ruin known as \"Drowned\" Soorenar.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* As of 1357 DR, the ruling triumvirate of Soorenar consisted of two male [[fighter]]s, the Lords Thurik and Brolkchant, and a female [[mage]], the Lady Yashur. Although all three had great ambitions for the city, only Lord Brolkchant had an unrealistic optimism about the city's strength and influence, while Lord Thurik and Lady Yashur understood the need for savvy diplomacy.\n* The [[lich]] [[Velsharoon]] maintained a lair known as the [[Tower Terrible]] in Soorenar prior to his ascension to [[god]]hood in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. He was the subject of sinister rumors during that time.{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}}\n* A family of [[werecrocodile]]s lived in the city's sewers, and would eat peasants and other poor folk.\n* As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, a [[dragon turtle]] named [[Scyllmara]] had taken up residence in the flooded ruins, claiming much of the sunken wealth for itself."
