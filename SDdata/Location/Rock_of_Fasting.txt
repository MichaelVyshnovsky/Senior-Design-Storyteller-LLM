The Rock of Fasting was located within the fortress of Sarahin in the Haunted Lands.
This  pillar of stone was only accessible by a single narrow rope bridge.
The Rock of Fasting served as the prison for Sarahin. It was scorching hot under the rays of the sun, and freezing during the night when frost formed on every surface.
The rope bridge leading to the Rock of Fasting was guarded by a wind walker. In the event of a rescue attempt, the wind walker would destroy the bridge. Prisoners attempting to escape would be buffeted until they fell to their deaths on the rocks below.
