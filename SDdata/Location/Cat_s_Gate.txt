The Cats Gate was a Netherese extra-planar portal located in Anauroch.
Most of this gate was buried by the shifting sands. What was exposed stood fifty feet tall. The gate was composed of two worn stone pillars, both fifty feet apart. The surface of the pillars was covered with carvings of cats. Three sides of each pillar were straight, but the fourth was pyramidal.
In operation, the active region showed as a pane of green light, rippling with green lightning bolts.
The gate on the other side was inclined at a forty-five degree angle, to prevent the sands from draining away through the gate.
The gate led to the Plane of Concordant Opposition (the Outlands). The exit was near the home of Gzemnid, the god of eye tyrants.
Built during the height of Netheril, this gate was erected as part of an attempt to conquer the Outlands. The gate was large enough to admit an army for that reason. However, other more powerful beings of that plane had the same idea about Netheril, which sparked a conflict known as The Seven Sigils War. The surrounding Netherese domain of Rdiuz was abandoned after about a century of warfare, as the sands encroached.
It was later found and seized by agents of Iyachtu Xvim in 1369 DR.
