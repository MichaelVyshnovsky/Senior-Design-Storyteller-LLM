        "History": "Long before the birth of Cormyr in [[26 DR]], the [[shadow dragon]] [[Shadraxil]] lurked in the Thunder Peaks. When Cormyr began to create a series of fortresses along its frontier in [[236 DR]], Shadraxil took this as an affront to his lands and began attacking the outposts. In response to Shadraxil's depredations, Cormyr sent a small force of armed men and [[War Wizard]]s led by the paladin [[Jerold Keegan]]. Keegan created a magical trap within one of the keeps and trapped Shadraxil in the [[Plane of Shadow]].\n\nSir Jerold Keegan became the lord of that outpost, which was then called Keegan's Keep. The town of Winterhaven was founded nearby due to the keep's protection.\n\nIt is said that some time after Shadraxil's banishment, Keegan became a crazed madman and slew all of his family and friends, cursing the keep forever. The leaders of Cormyr, afraid that this dark influence could be corrupting, ordered the keep torn down. They slew a young shadow dragon, claimed it was Shadraxil's corpse, and buried in a fake dragon burial site southwest of Winterhaven\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], a cult of [[Shar]] was established in Winterhaven.{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/files/dungeon/155_Shadowfell_FR.pdf |author=[[Greg Bilsland]] |title=Keep on the Shadowfell Forgotten Realms Conversion |accessdate=2008-06-13|format=PDF |work=Dungeon magazine 155 |pages=13}}",
