Elfmeet was a small community in the Pasocada Basin in Maztica.
The hamlet was located right on the edge of the Long Canyon. It had a spring at its center, and there were trails leading to the bottom of the canyon.
Elfmeet was an Azuposi settlement with a static population of 400, but was a favored place for the nomadic Poscadari to go to trade with the Azuposi.
