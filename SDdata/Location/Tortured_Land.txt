The '''Tortured Land''', also called the '''Tortured Lands''', was a barren area in the northernmost [[Moonsea]] region in [[north Faerûn]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|50,51,62}} In one language, it was called the '''Lee-wai''' (or Leewai{{Cite document

{{Quote|''This is a barren place where monsters chase smaller beasts around endless spires and weirdly sculpted rocks. It's a deities' playground of teeth and swirls and fingers and suchlike of stone, some of them pierced by caves where bats lurk, but most of them just in your way as you flee from the next prowling monster. A little metal to be had, but no safety in which to mine it. Water, but not enough, and the beasts watch the waterholes for their next meal.''|Anonymous [[Harper]] agent<ref>{{Cite web/geocities/Ed Says: Geography of the Realms}}}}

==Geography==
It lay beyond the Moonsea, north of [[the Ride]] and just below the southern edge of the [[Great Glacier]], west of the northern [[Galena Mountains]] and east of [[Anauroch]] and the northern tip of the [[Border Forest]], sandwiched between the [[Abbey Mountains]] and the [[White Peaks]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}} There was no clear border with Anauroch; only where the plants ended and bare rock began marked where one had left the Tortured Land.

Flowing southwest into the eastern half was the [[River Pelauvir]], which was joined by the tributary [[Shattersoul River]]. It was crossed by a trail from [[Ilinvur]] called the [[Way of the Powrie]], which led onto the Great Glacier.

The landscape was formed from lava flows left by ancient volcanic eruptions that were then carved by flowing glacial ice. Scattered around were weird stone pillars and rock formations, which were smoothed by the wind into natural sculptures, with jagged parts where bits broke off. There was also ice, similarly wind-carved. In the west, the land was dry and rocky, and cut through by deep canyons. In the east the ground was cold and hard, where frozen [[sand]] formed dunes in strange and broken shapes and tundra stretched from the Pelauvir north to the Frozen Forest. All over, the terrain was unforgiving and the temperature changes dramatic.

It was a [[tenday]]'s ride north of the [[Varm]] lands.

==Flora & Fauna==
The Tortured Land was much more moist than the desert of Anauroch, which permitted a lot more plants to grow, though it was still considered a barren wasteland, uninhabitable to the majority of people.

There were small prey animals and strangely shaped and savage monsters.

==Inhabitants==
Few outsiders went into the Tortured Land, and fewer still lingered there long enough to explore, let alone map it. It was believed to be a cold and harsh wasteland of rampaging monsters and an evil land shunned and little-spoken-of by even the Riders of the Ride.

However, in a secluded part of the Tortured Lands there lived the [[ondonti]]s, a community of pacifist [[orc]]s dedicated to the goddess [[Eldath]]. Fifteen tribes lived in harmony with the land through farming and foraging.

In the icy northeast, where the Way of the Powrie crossed the River Pelauvir at the bridge called Maram's Span was the settlement of [[Frozen Flindyke]],{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|62-63}}

In the late 1360s DR, a [[Moonstars]] agent based in [[Whitehorn]] monitored events in the Tortured Lands, Anauroch, and [[Frozen Forest]].

==Notable Locations==
Beside Frozen Flindyke stood the ancient [[stone giant]] citadel of [[Moch-Fanan]], fashioned of rune-inscribed [[iron]] and long abandoned by the jotunbrud. They built this and the bridge later called Maram's Span. For thousands of years, it guarded trade into the south of their realm. It was later claimed by the gnolls of Flindyke.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|81}}

Two mysterious locales in the heart of the Tortured Lands were the [[Oubliette of Madness]] and the [[Cenotaph of Lost Gods]].

Somewhere in the heart of the Tortured Land there was once a glowing spring. Once a year in the month of [[Ches]], the Riders were said to come to venerate the [[Tyranthraxus|spirit]] of this spring.

==History==
According to the Sage [[Archembald]] of [[Yûlash]], in the last years of the [[Age of Dragons]] ({{Yearlink|-30000}} to {{Yearlink|-24000}}), the stone giants reluctantly gave up Moch-Fanan and went into the Abbey Mountains. After them came the gnolls, who built Frozen Flindyke around the citadel and bridge.

''Circa'' {{YearlinkName|-2274}}, a [[shield dwarf]] clan dwelling in the Tortured Land declined to join a dwarven war party in raiding peaceful settlements of the Border Forest. Convicted as traitors by their kin, they were exiled from the Tortured Land and migrated north onto the Great Glacier. After a year-long journeyed, they settled in [[Novularond]], but only four members of the clan had survived. They went on to found the [[Innugaakalikurit]] clan, the modern-day [[arctic dwarf|arctic dwarves]].<ref group="note">''Demihumans of the Realms'' places this "2,200 years ago", perhaps miscalculating the conversion of the [[Ulutiun calendar]] used in ''The Great Glacier''. However, other sources give other, very different dates for arctic dwarf settlement 

A legend of the northern tribes told that a being of fire called Tirantikus—[[Tyranthraxus]] the Flamed One—emerged from the Tortured Land. Tyranthraxus, together with [[Edranka]] and [[Torath]], were generals of the [[Twisted Ones]], unholy creatures employed by the glowing pool. In the {{YearlinkName|-356}}, they raised armies and conquered, destroyed, and reigned over the northern lands. From out of the Waste, Tyranthraxus led the Riders to conquer [[Barze]], [[Horreb]], and [[the Vane]] before being defeated, for a time.{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: Ironfang Keep|50}}{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|80}}

After the fall of the [[Netherese]] survivor states, a group of pacifist refugees from [[Rulvadar]] passed through the Tortured Lands and settled in the neighboring mountains near the Border Forest. Joining the people of [[Yrlaancel]], in the {{YearlinkName|351}}, they founded the city of Ondathel, later [[Myth Ondath]], a city dedicated to Eldath. The people adopted a group of orphaned orc children and raised them in the faith of the Green Goddess. When that city was destroyed by the [[Iyraclea|Ice Queen]] and the ''[[Gatekeeper's Crystal]]'' in the {{YearlinkName|633}}, these orcs were among the few survivors.{{cite book/Volo's Guide to All Things Magical|107}} They lived on in peace in the Tortured Lands as the ondontis.

The ondontis were discovered unexpectedly by a scouting party out of [[Zhentil Keep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1340}}. Shortly after their first meeting, fourteen of the fifteen tribes were captured by [[Zhentilar]] raiders and taken to the [[Citadel of the Raven]] to be used as slaves and breeding stock for a new army. The final tribe left, isolated at the time, escaped into deep seclusion and avoided later raids. They employed the divine magic of their clerics to conceal themselves from the slavers. Thus they remained by [[1369 DR]].

In the spring of [[1480 DR]], [[elemental]] creatures began roving south out of the Tortured Lands, causing people to flee their homes near [[Ilinvur]] and Barze.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}}
