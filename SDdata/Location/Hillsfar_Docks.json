        "mainbody": "The Hillsfar Docks was a small hamlet located outside the walls of Hillsfar on the shore of the Moonsea.\nThe hamlet was home to around 200 people around 1367 DR. Several inns and taverns were constructed around the main harbor area which served as the staging area for Hillsfars water traffic.\nA force of 100 Red Plumes guarded the docks at any given time. They were stationed in an easily defended stone tower that also doubled as a lighthouse for the harbor.\nSpies for the rogues guild were rumored to lurk in the area."
