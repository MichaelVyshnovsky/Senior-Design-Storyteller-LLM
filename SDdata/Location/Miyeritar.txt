}}'''Miyeritar''' was an ancient [[elf|elven]] empire in the northwestern parts of [[Faer√ªn]].

==History==
The realm of Miyeritar was founded by [[green elf|green]] and [[dark elf|dark elves]] around {{Yearlink|-18000}} in the area later known as the [[High Moor]] and [[Misty Forest]]. In its heyday, the land was verdant and lush.{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|53}} The goddess [[Eilistraee]] had a strong follower base among the people of Miyeritar, to the point that near entirety of her faith was concentrated there.

The [[Sun elf|gold elven]] realm [[Aryvandaar]] became their greatest threat. In {{Yearlink|-14700}}, the rulers of Aryvandaar started trying to annex Miyeritar, initially through peaceful and diplomatic means. Despite these troubles with their powerful neighbors, in {{Yearlink|-13900}}, the realm of Miyeritar developed into a hub of arts and elven [[magic]] and [[High Magic]]. But Aryvandaar did not let up and in {{Yearlink|-13200}} the two realms engaged in skirmishes and interference in each other's trade. It was only a question of time until a real war broke out between them. That happened in {{Yearlink|-12000}} when the rulers of Aryvandaar lost their patience and attacked. This was the beginning of the [[First Crown War]].

In {{Yearlink|-11800}}, the Aryvandaarans seemed to have won: their forces occupied and formally annexed Miyeritar. However, a number of Miyeritari clans and strongholds held out and resisted them. They received help from the elves of [[Illefarn]], who, although officially neutral, secretly provided sanctuaries to Miyeritari refugees.

Nevertheless, Miyeritar was considered fully conquered at the end of the First Crown War in {{Yearlink|-11300}}.

Aryvandaar went on to conquer other realms. After the conquest of [[Shantel Othreier]] in {{Yearlink|-10600}}, a guerrilla uprising and mage rebellion occurred in parts of Miyeritar and the newly conquered lands. This led to the Aryvandaarans using High Magic to cause a tremendous killing storm. The event became known as the [[Dark Disaster]]. It reduced the entire forest and realm of Miyeritar to barren wastelands within three months. The peoples of [[Faer'tel'miir]], one of the cities destroyed during the Dark Disaster, became the [[fhaorn'quessir]]&mdash;the first [[sharn]]s.

Ruins of Miyeritar could still be discovered in later times (circa [[1372 DR]]). One of them was the mysterious [[Kraanfhaor's Door]], which was the entrance to a school of High Magic. The [[drow]] mage [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] found a way to open it and found an ancient ''[[Selu'Kiira]]'' of his Miyeritari ancestors. With the help of that he learned to use High Magic and helped in making nearly everyone on Toril forget [[Kiaransalee]]. Later, he helped to transform a few hundred among the few thousands followers of Eilistraee (those drow who were descendants of ancient Miyeritari clans) into [[dark elves]], whose souls were then admitted into [[Arvandor]] by [[Corellon]] (even though they could already go there, in Eilistraee's own realm).

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the Miyeritari city of [[Rhymanthiin]] was ressurected with the help of [[Khelben Arunsun]].{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|59}}

==Notable Locations==
* [[Faer'tel'miir]], a city destroyed in the Dark Disaster whose survivors became the first [[sharn]]s.
* [[Great Sapphire Wood]], a forest that was destroyed in the Dark Disaster.{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|58}} 
* [[Myth Akherynnar]], a city that outlived Faer'tel'miir but ultimately did not survive the Dark Disaster.
* [[Tosofome Caldera]], the intended site of a High Magic ritual to send the Dark Disaster back at its casters.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* The [[Three Watchers]] ([[T'karon]], [[Hamra]], and [[Alunor]]) who conducted the ritual to transform the survivors of Faer'tel'miir into the fhaorn'quessir, which became the first sharns.
* [[Lyrna Fathomlin]], a [[high mage]] from [[Myth Akherynnar]].
