''[[Lost Empires of Faerûn]]'' has Ardeep founded by Shantel Othreier in {{Yearlink|-23600}}. Hence founded \"around\" is used.",
        "Geography": "The realm of Ardeep encompassed the area later known as the [[Ardeep Forest]] as well as lands north of the River [[Delimbiyr]].''The Grand History of the Realms'' has Ardeep founded in the area later known as [[Greenfields (Western Heartlands)|Greenfields]]. However, it is noted in ''Lost Empires of Faerûn'' that Ardeep was founded by and a vassal realm of Shantel Othreier and encompassed the forest that later became known as the Ardeep Forest. Therefore, it is more likely the extent of Ardeep lay further north, encompassing the area of Ardeep Forest, stretching along the [[Sword Coast]], and not in the area known as Greenfields.",
        "History": "Ardeep was a vassal state of [[Shantel Othreier]] at the beginning of the [[Crown Wars]]. At the conclusion of the [[Third Crown War]] in {{Yearlink|-10600}}, Shantel Othreier was conquered by the [[Vyshaantar Empire]] of [[Aryvandaar]]. Ardeep continued to battle against the forces of Aryvandaar until it was conquered in {{Yearlink|-10460}}. It took the next hundred years for Aryvandaar to gain complete control and two of Ardeep's rulers were slain: [[Ilitharath]] and his grandson, [[Tarosspur]].\n\nAfter Shantel Othreier was conquered by the [[Vyshaantar Empire]], it was taken as a vassal realm of the Empire. When the Vyshaan were dissolved, Ardeep joined with [[Illefarn]] in {{Yearlink|-9000}}. When [[Aelinthaldaar]] was razed by its own people in {{Yearlink|-1100}}, Illefarn split into three fragmented states of which Ardeep was one and became independent for the first time in many millenia.\n\nAlliances were made with the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Dardath]], the [[human]]s of [[Delimbiyran]], the [[gnome]]s of [[Dolblunde]] and the [[halfling|halflings]] of [[Secomber]] and together they formed [[Phalorm]] in the {{YearlinkName|523}}.. Phalorm eventually fell in the {{YearlinkName|615}}, and was replaced by the [[Kingdom of Man]]. Many of the [[elf|elves]] of Ardeep left for [[Evermeet]] at that time and most of those that remained [[The Retreat|followed]] in the {{YearlinkName|1344}}."
