'''Heartleaf's Garden''' was the last remnant of a grove on [[Mount Hotenow]] that survived the destruction caused by the volcano's eruption in the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It comprised a single tree that was tended by [[Heartleaf]], the [[dryad]] after which it was named.

{{Quote|From this handful of seeds, a new forest of my sister trees will one day grow and live again.}}

==History==
When Mount Hotenow erupted in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, an [[Charred Wood|entire grove of trees]] was incinerated and nearly all the [[Dryad|dryads]] that dwelled within died off. By some miracle, the young sapling Heartleaf managed to survive the devastation. Heartleaf remained in her garden for decades, dedicating her existence to the regrowth and renewal of her sisters' lost trees.
