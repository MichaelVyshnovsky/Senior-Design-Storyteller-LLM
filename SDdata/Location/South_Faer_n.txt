The lands of South Faerûn lay to the south to those around the Sea of Fallen Stars, isolated from neighboring realms by the Lake of Steam in the west and the vast plains of the Shaar along the north. It was bordered to the west by the Chultan Peninsula, and along the south and east by the Great Sea.
This region along the southeastern shore of the Lake of Steam was a land of unstable kingdoms that rose and fell all too frequently. Despite the turbulent politics and struggles for power, the hardy locals managed to survive and go about their lives, though they could by no means be considered prosperous. Among the score of minor fiefdoms were
* Adaerglast, the realm founded by a pair of mages that invaded the dreams of their would-be vassals.
* Blacksaddle, a barony founded by the family after which the realm was named.
While the Shining South earned a reputation among the Heartlands of the north as the land where fantastical myths of the Realms came to manifest, in truth the people of the South lived their lives just the same as many others.
The region came to be known as the "Scarred South" during the 15 century DR, following the massive destruction caused by the events of the Spellplague.
* Great Rift Within the southern stretch the Shaar lay this great, steep-sided canyon that served as the ancient home of the gold dwarves, along with two of their great settlements the surface city of Eartheart in the south, and Underhome in the east. Following the formation of the Underchasm during the disastrous Spellplague, a portion of the Great Rift remained as the East Rift, while the rest was swallowed up by the great scar on Faerûn.
* Halruaa The citizens of this wealthy and predominantly insular magocracy were descended from survivors that fled the warring empire of Netheril shortly before its collapse. The nation was divided into sections by three rivers that met at Lake Halruaa in the center, the northern shore of which held the capital city of Halarahh. Halruaan wizards managed to transport their home nation to the world of Abeir for a time to avoid the disaster of the Spellplague, returning to Toril during the Second Sundering over a century later.
* Shaar The expansive grassland that spanned the entirety of the Shining South–and continued east into the Shining Lands Like other lands in the south, it was also devastated by the Spellplague, later coming to be known as the "Shaar Desolation".
