        "mainbody": "he Archdruids Grove was a temple complex of sorts dedicated to Silvanus, the Oak-Father, just outside the city of Mosstone in the Forest of Tethir. The Grove was a center of the gods worship and home of the Archdruid of Mosstone.\nThe Grove was a large round clearing in the middle of the woods, well-sheltered from prying eyes by a thick growth of shadowtop trees. Its ground was a flat moss-covered surface with a massive ancient oak the in the middle that shadowed tall shadowtops that surrounded the Grove. Each of the oak branches was big enough to house a large cottage. The tree was called the Great Oak and was considered a holy site of Silvanus. Even druids who do not reside in the Grove came to the Great Oak to pray. The tree was fiercely protected, and all axes were banned from the Grove, and no weapon was allowed to come near the Gray Oaks ancient bark.\nA large low stone structure with round doors stood to the southeast of the Great Oak. The building called the Aldinus was a vine and ivy-entangled home of the Archdruid and a group of servants and messengers who served them. The Aldinus had several hidden round rooms where the druids kept seeds, secured in the times of strife, blight, drought, or winter-sear. The main hall of the structure was used for town hall gathering for the people of Mosstone and the Interregnum Tribunal of Tethyr.\nNewleaf House, a druidic seminary, stood to the east from the Aldinus, shaded by the tall shadowtops. The seminary walls were closely-planted living trees with a giant stone slap held up by them, forming Newleaf Houses roof. Its windows only had shutters that allowed a cool breeze to raven through the seminary in all seasons of the year. Weathering sweltering summer heat, spring storms, and freezing winter cold was a part of druidic training. Newleaf House also was used to drop mushrooms and other edible plants used to feed the worshipers of Silvanus.\nTo the northwest of the Great Oak, across from Newleaf House, the library of Seirystrum rose above the Grove. The peculiarly shaped conical building was lit on the inside by the glow of numerous druidic spells. The library was always open to Mosstonians and used by druids as a meditation chamber.\nThe Archdruids Grove could be found to the northeast of Mosstone, at the end of a nondescript mossy dirt path through the woods. Any traveler who uttered the word \"please\" while walking the path was greeted by a small glowing orb faerie fire. Its gentle blue and white radiance guided travelers to the trails end and harmlessly snuffed into the air. If a traveler collapsed exhausted or decided to sleep while traveling the path, the magic orb remained with them as they rested.\nDruids known as the Becloaked were a mysterious group found within the Archdruids Grove. Three of these Becloaked druids were always seen patrolling the Grove under the commands of the Archdruid. According to Volothamp Geddarms testimony, he once witnessed a glimpse of a Becloakeds hand â€“ covered in tiny green iridescent scales.\n*The age and significance of the Great Oak meant it was surrounded by numerous legends. One stated that deep and high in the trees canopy hung crowns of kings not yet born, and many long lost magical swords were buried under its roots, spirited there from across the forests of Toril.\n*Another legend claimed that under the Great Oaks roots laid a cavern with a powerful enchanted throne, a pool of visions, and stone tombs of kings or other powerful beings from ancient times still living in ensorcelled stasis.\n*Mosstonians held a popular belief that at the end of the Archdruids life, they stepped into the Great Oak, becoming one with the mighty tree. Others, however, argued that Archdruids traveled to Old Oak Dell and transformed themselves into oak trees there.\nApart from druids, the staff of Aldinus included sylvan creatures and good-natured lycanthropes. Seirystrum was guarded by its own watchghost guardians called \"The Waiting,\" who prevented bookworm infestations and kept other book-harming predators away. The Waiting served druids of the Grove and performed tasks for the Archdruid."
