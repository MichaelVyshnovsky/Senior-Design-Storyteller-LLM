        "mainbody": "'''The Archdruid's Grove''' was a temple complex of sorts dedicated to [[Silvanus]], the Oak-Father, just outside the city of [[Mosstone]] in the [[Forest of Tethir]]. The Grove was a center of the god's worship and home of the [[Archdruid]] of Mosstone.",
        "Description": {
            "Aldinus": "A large low stone structure with round doors stood to the southeast of the Great Oak. The building called the Aldinus was a vine and [[ivy]]-entangled home of the Archdruid and a group of servants and messengers who served them. The Aldinus had several hidden round rooms where the druids kept seeds, secured in the times of strife, blight, drought, or winter-sear. The main hall of the structure was used for town hall gathering for the people of Mosstone and the [[Interregnum Tribunal]] of [[Tethyr]].",
            "Newleaf House": "Newleaf House, a druidic seminary, stood to the east from the Aldinus, shaded by the tall shadowtops. The seminary walls were closely-planted living trees with a giant stone slap held up by them, forming Newleaf House's roof. Its windows only had shutters that allowed a cool breeze to raven through the seminary in all seasons of the year. Weathering sweltering summer heat, spring storms, and freezing winter cold was a part of druidic training. Newleaf House also was used to drop [[mushroom]]s and other edible plants used to feed the worshipers of Silvanus.",
            "Seirystrum": "To the northwest of the Great Oak, across from Newleaf House, the library of Seirystrum rose above the Grove. The peculiarly shaped conical building was lit on the inside by the glow of numerous druidic spells. The library was always open to Mosstonians and used by druids as a meditation chamber."
        },
        "Geography": "The Archdruid's Grove could be found to the northeast of Mosstone, at the end of a nondescript mossy dirt path through the woods. Any traveler who uttered the word \"please\" while walking the path was greeted by a small glowing orb ''[[faerie fire]].'' Its gentle blue and white radiance guided travelers to the trail's end and harmlessly snuffed into the air. If a traveler collapsed exhausted or decided to sleep while traveling the path, the magic orb remained with them as they rested.",
        "Government": "Druids known as the [[Becloaked]] were a mysterious group found within the Archdruid's Grove. Three of these Becloaked druids were always seen patrolling the Grove under the commands of the Archdruid. According to [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s testimony, he once witnessed a glimpse of a Becloaked's hand â€“ covered in tiny green iridescent scales.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "*The age and significance of the Great Oak meant it was surrounded by numerous legends. One stated that deep and high in the tree's canopy hung crowns of kings not yet born, and many long lost magical [[sword]]s were buried under its roots, spirited there from across the forests of [[Toril]].\n*Another legend claimed that under the Great Oak's roots laid a cavern with a powerful [[enchanted]] throne, a pool of visions, and stone tombs of kings or other powerful beings from ancient times still living in ensorcelled stasis.\n*Mosstonians held a popular belief that at the end of the Archdruid's life, they stepped into the Great Oak, becoming one with the mighty tree. Others, however, argued that Archdruids traveled to [[Old Oak Dell]] and transformed themselves into oak trees there.",
        "Inhabitants": "Apart from druids, the staff of Aldinus included sylvan creatures and good-natured [[lycanthrope]]s. Seirystrum was guarded by its own [[watchghost]] guardians called \"The Waiting,\" who prevented [[bookworm]] infestations and kept other book-harming predators away. The Waiting served druids of the Grove and performed tasks for the Archdruid."
