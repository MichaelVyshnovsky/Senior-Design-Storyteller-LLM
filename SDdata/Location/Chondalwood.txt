'''Chondalwood''' was a large forest located in [[Chondath]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]], stretching from the [[Nunwood]] to the [[Nagaflow]] River. It was also known as '''Satyrwood'''. The village of [[Elbulder]] was to the south of the forest.

==History==
The forest was once home to the [[green elf]] realm of [[Nikerymath]]. It contains the hidden city of [[Rucien-Xan]].

==Inhabitants==
[[File:Satyrwood.png|thumb|''A [[satyr]] of [[Satyrwood]] keeping an eye on [[human]]s.'']]
The Chondalwood was the home of [[wild elves]].

As of [[1368 DR]], troops of [[satyr]]s patrolled the [[Old Road]], scaring travelers into making haste out of the forest or to go around it, and the forest was also inhabited by [[voadkyn]] (wood giants) and [[centaur]]s. As of [[1372 DR]], savage druids lived in the forest and posed a threat to anyone approaching them. Clans of [[ghostwise halfling]] roamed about the forest, never staying in one spot for too long. Various plant creatures such as [[shambling mounds]] and [[tendriculos]] also lived here. All of these intelligent races had one goal in mind: to prevent [[human]] encroachment.

The [[Eldreth Veluuthra]] were active in this forest, and as of [[1374 DR]], generally received support from the forest's inhabitants such as the centaurs, ghostwise halflings and satyrs. The wild elves in the forest provided the organization's agents with shelter. [[Talindra Amalith]] of the [[Vel'Nikeryma]] (the Eldreth Veluuthra's guiding council) sought out new wild elf recruits in this area.

==People==
[[Totoruan]] of the Chondalwood, a member of the [[People of the Black Blood]], lived here around [[1372 DR]].

==Rumors==
For many years, the people of the [[Vilhon Reach]] wondered over the existence of an elven realm called [[Rucien-Xan]] within the forest.
