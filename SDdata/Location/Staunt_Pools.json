        "Description": "The pools were the lair of a freshwater [[giant squid]]. Many barge guards swore to have met and killed the squid, but others reported attacks by another identical example. The legend of the \"Treasure of the Holes\" was very well known in the region.",
        "History": "According to the rumor, a barge carrying a [[dwarf]]-treasure full of [[silver]] bullion was sunk somewhere in the sludge of one of these pools. The pools were named for the ruined village of [[Staunt's Hold]] that once stood nearby."
