        "mainbody": "The Staunt Pools referred to a succession of deep holes located in the River Rauvin to the west of Jalanthar.\nThe pools were the lair of a freshwater giant squid. Many barge guards swore to have met and killed the squid, but others reported attacks by another identical example. The legend of the \"Treasure of the Holes\" was very well known in the region.\nAccording to the rumor, a barge carrying a dwarf-treasure full of silver bullion was sunk somewhere in the sludge of one of these pools. The pools were named for the ruined village of Staunts Hold that once stood nearby."
