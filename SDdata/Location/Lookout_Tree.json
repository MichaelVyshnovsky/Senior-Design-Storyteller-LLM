        "Description": "It was a [[shadowtop]] tree, with a near-endless spiral staircase. Up top, the leaves were large enough to act as cushions; for those who were guests of such elves as [[Starsunder]], the leaves would mold themselves into chairs if needed.",
        "Defenses": "Those who did not walk up the stairs would startle the tree on contact, and it would defend itself.",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|767}}, during the Chaos of [[the Art]], a mage from [[Galadorna]], [[Umbregard]], visited [[Tangletrees]] looking for answers regarding [[Elminster Aumar]], one of the [[Chosen of Mystra]]. He was met by Starsunder, who brought him to the Lookout Tree to converse."
