        "mainbody": "The '''Brandiar Moor''' was a region of moorland in central [[Damara]].",
        "Geography": "The Brandiar Moor straddled the borders of the Duchies of [[Arcata]], [[Brandiar]], and [[Carmathan]]. Its southern edge was located {{SI|20|miles|k|long=yes}} east of the Arcatan capital of [[Valls]].The location of Valls was moved much further south between the original map in ''[[The Bloodstone Wars|H3: The Bloodstone Wars]]'' and the subsequent map created for ''[[The Bloodstone Lands (sourcebook)|The Bloodstone Lands]]''. This would place the Brandiar Moor's new location much further south than the intersection of the borders of the three duchies as described in the actual text of ''The Bloodstone Lands'' and as shown on the original map. As such, the new map is presumed to be in error. The alternative reading is that the Moor extends south all the way into central Carmathan.\n\nThe region was characterized by steep-sloped hills pocked by stone walls.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, the southern edge of the Brandiar Moor became the site of the [[Bloodstone_Wars#Fight_of_Three_Borders|Fight of Three Borders]], a major battle in the [[Bloodstone Wars]] between the forces of Baron [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] of [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]] and the forces of Duke [[Helmont the 14th]] of Carmathan."
