The Windbreak was a massive rock that towered over the remote northern coastline of Icewind Dale on the Sea of Moving Ice.
The rock was tall and blade-like in shape. It sat atop cliffs overlooking the Sea of Moving Ice, and rose over  above these already  cliffs.This height is based on the description of Revels Ends tower, which is described as being carved out of the Windbreak. 
As of the late 15 century DR, the high-security prison of Revels End was carved out of the rocks northwest side. The rock earned its name because of its role in shielding the prison from the harsh winds coming off the Reghed Glacier.
