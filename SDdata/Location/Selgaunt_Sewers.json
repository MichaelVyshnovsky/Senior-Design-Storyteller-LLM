            "Sewer Ecology": "In addition to standard sewer wildlife such as [[rat]]s and [[giant rat]]s, tales abounded in Selgaunt of dire creatures lurking within its sewers. These included such things as [[ghoul]]s, flesh dissolving [[slime]]s, and [[algoid]]s.",
            "Surface Connections": "* An [[unnamed Harper safehouse]] in the city's [[Selgaunt/Warehouse District|Warehouse District]].\n* The [[Hunting Gardens of the Hulorn]] were connected to the sewers, by a fountain, the centerpiece of the gardens, separated by a grate that could be pushed up from below. It was not uncommon for teenagers to sneak into the Hunting Gardens through the sewers, dared by their friends to bring back some rare flower or another as proof of their trespass.\n* The [[Night Knives|guildhouse]] of the [[Night Knives]], formerly a trading office and storehouse for the [[Six Coins Trading Coster]], had a concealed trapdoor in its lower level that granted the  access to the city's old sewer system.\n* An alley off of [[Stevedore's Way]] had a secret entrance to the sewers in the form of a well with an affixed ladder and special [[lock]] mechanism that had been established by the [[Harpers]]. It was roughly a {{SI|80|ft|long=yes}} descent from the well to the tunnels below.\n* In an alley off of [[Winding Way]] stood a dry common well, dug by the Night Knives, that provided access to the sewers {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} below. The area it dropped down into branched off into three directions and blocked off from the main tunnels."

        "Groups of Interest": "* The Harpers, like other covert organizations in Selgaunt, used the sewers to navigate the city beneath the notice of the [[Zhentarim]].\n* The Night Knives, the local [[thieves' guild]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], had a number of entrances to the sewers and regularly patrolled their areas to keep them clear of unwanted intruders.\n* The [[Shadowblades]], a group of [[Maskarran]] [[thieves]], once operated in the sewers and maintained a shrine to [[Mask]] there until it was discovered by agents of the Zhentarim as they were making inroads into Selgaunt.{{Cite dragon/277/Rogues Gallery: The Heroes of Shadow's Witness|103}}",
        "Inhabitants": "It was not uncommon to find Selgauntian beggars and destitute to take shelter in the warmth of the sewers, occasionally perishing therein and becoming food for the local rats.",
        "History": "Despite the existence of the sewer system, Selgauntians continued to pour their waste out in [[chamberpot]]s for collection by [[nightsoil wagon]]s well into the late 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite dragon/304/Haunted: A Tale of Sembia|70}}\n\nAround {{YearlinkName|1370}}, thieves [[Erevis Cale]] and [[Jak Fleet]] fled down the secret entrance off of Stevedore's Way to escape from Zhent agents that were after them. Erevis was suspicious of Jak's knowledge of how to access the secret entrance, but before they could come to blows they ran into Jak's fellow agents and he was forced to reveal to Erevis that he was a member of the Harpers. The two friends managed to reconcile and continue their travel through the sewers.\n\n[[Larajin]], a [[half-elf]] servant of the [[Uskevren]] family, often snuck into the Hunting Gardens of Hulorn whenever she needed to clear her head. But one night when she was planning to go, in the winter of 1370 DR, the [[dwarf]] [[Kremlar]] offered her thirty [[Raven (coin)|ravens]] if she could retrieve a rare flower by the name of [[Selune's Kisses]]. She would manage to access the Hunting Gardens with ease, but while there discovered an injured [[tressym]] and [[Andeth Ilchammar]], the [[Hulorn]] of Selgaunt, whose body had been transformed by dark magics. Fearful of being caught, Larajin waited until he was out of sight before fleeing from the scene and vowing to return the next morning for the tressym.\n\nThe next night she returned with [[Talbot Uskevren]], who had insisted upon accompanying her after hearing her recount. from beaks, serpent tongues, human-like hands, hooves, feathered wings, horns, and even a tiny human head in one case. The two ran feverishly through the dark sewage as the ravenous swarm pursued them, grasping at them, gnawing at their clothes. With luck, the two managed to escape from the depths.\n\nA year later around [[Deepwinter]], Erevis Cale came across a pile of rotting corpses at the base of the ladder leading up into the Night Knives guildhouse. Numbering around fifteen to twenty, the entangled mass of corpses were being feasted upon by giant rats. It took Cale little time to recognize the corpses as all members of the Night Knives,\n\nBy [[Uktar 11]], in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, unrest across Sembia left the possibility of a civil war looming as a certainty over the new Hulorn of Selgaunt, [[Thamalon Uskevren II]]. Wanting to prepare his city against the army of Countess [[Mirabeta Selkirk]], Thamalon had [[engineer]]s supervise wide-scale renovations of the city's defenses, which included securing Selgaunt's sewer grates.<ref>"
