'''Sshamath''' or the '''City of Dark Weavings''' was a [[drow]] city located in the [[Gauth Grottoes]] below the [[Far Hills]].

==History==
Sshamath was established in {{Yearlink|-4973}} by the [[Lolth]]-worshiping drow house [[Sshamath (house)|Sshamath]]. It was a standard drow city for nearly 2000 years. Then, in {{Yearlink|-2867}}, it was discovered that the city's local ''[[faerzress]]'' was fluctuating badly. Five years later it was gone and the city was gravely weakened.

Around three centuries previously, the [[Matron Mother]]s of the city had given birth to an unusually large number of male children. This contributed to a large increase in the number of [[wizard]]s, and a decrease in the number of priestesses. Thanks to the lack of nearby threats, the house wizards set about plundering the ruins of lost civilizations, such as [[Netheril]] and [[Oghrann]]. They took and duplicated every magical item that they could find, using them to instigate a very short civil war that killed all of the house matriarchs and replaced them with wizards. Thereafter, practitioners of [[the Art]] reigned supreme.

In the {{YearlinkName|1379}}, [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] was accepted into the Conclave of the School of Ancient Arcana. That same year, after the [[High Magic]] ritual that transformed those drow not tainted by [[Wendonai]]'s blood and hundreds (but not all) among the followers of [[Eilistraee]] into their original [[dark elf]] forms, [[Seldszar Elpragh]], Master of the College of Divination, revealed that the College of Ancient Arcana and the College of Divination would be relocated to the surface city of [[Rhymanthiin]], the City of Hope, which was ruled by the [[sharn]].

==Society==
Sorcerers, bards, and divine spellcasters were treated as secondary citizens because [[magic]] that was earned through work was much more respected than magic that came naturally or from deference to another.

The city was ruled over by the [[Conclave of Sshamath]], an [[:Category:Oligarchies|oligarchy]] composed of one representative from each of the eight schools of [[schools of magic|magical specialization]], one who did not specialize, and one who was elected from among the more esoteric arcane practitioners ([[elemental savant]]s, [[deep diviner]]s, ''etc.'').

The [[shadow adept]] [[Nurissa Vyllshan]] wanted to have users of the [[Shadow Weave]] accepted as an official school and thus become eligible for a conclave seat. Unfortunately for her and her followers, the worship of [[Shar]] was frowned upon by the other wizards and this threatened the power of the already established members. However, some argued that the practitioners of such magic should operate with conclave support rather than go unregulated.

The city itself was a major trading center for all things magical. One could find nearly anything a wizard could possibly want in the Dark Weavings Bazaar. If something was not available, it could likely be procured for an exorbitant fee by adventurers (including non-drow) for hire.

[[Slavery]] was also treated differently here than in other drow cities. While it was widely practiced in Sshamath as in other drow cities, races considered capable of wizardry such as [[humans]], [[elves]], [[svirfneblin]], and [[deep Imaskari]] were never kept as slaves by citizens, and those who came to the city from outside and demonstrated an aptitude for wizardry were considered free in the eyes of Sshamath law. However, since only drow could be citizens, these others formed a lower class that inhabited a ghetto. The Conclave did not allow them to grow too numerous and used them as scapegoats and sacrificial lambs. Otherwise, races thought too "primitive" for wizardry, like [[goblin]]s, [[grimlock]]s, [[minotaur]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[chitine]]s, and others, were freely kept as slaves. Even if one of them did demonstrate arcane magic, they were regarded as anomalies or novelties, not as evidence for their race as a whole.

==Relations==
It had trading contacts in the [[Zhentarim]] citadel of [[Darkhold]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Dark Weavings Bazaar]]: At the bottom of the great cave was the Dark Weavings Bazaar, the marketplace of Sshamath. In hundreds of tents and small shops in stalagmites, a visitor could buy almost everything. In the center of the bazaar was the slave market. In most other places such a market consisted of many tents and cages but in a city full of wizards it was housed in a single building. Magical glyphs on each side tried to encourage people to buy one or more slaves. The slaves were held in magical clearstones&mdash;magically shrunk to fit into fist-sized cubes and stored on shelves.
* [[Z'orr'bauth]]: The great pillar in the center of the city. It stretched from the floor of the cavern right to the roof, which led to the entrance cave above the city. Hundreds of bridges extended from this great pillar, leading to individual homes.
* [[The Stonestave]]: This was where the Conclave met on the rare occasions when necessary. It was heavily guarded and warded. Like Z'orr'bauth, it stretched from the floor to the ceiling of the cavern. It got its name from its shape, that of a wizard's staff.
* [[The Quillspires]]: A cluster of hollowed stalactites hanging from the roof of the cavern, northwest of Z'orr'bauth, where the city's scribes and low-level wizards created [[scroll]]s for sale in the bazaar and dealt with minor magical research.
* [[Tower of the Masked Mage]]: A stalactite temple to [[Vhaeraun]] suspended over the Darkwoods.
* Web of the Spider Queen: A cluster of stalactites and stalagmites that served as Lolth's temple in the city. Only a token deference was given to the Spider Queen by the city's citizens outside of the Web and among wizards, even less. The priestesses who lived here did good business with mages that required clerical spells to complete [[magical item]]s.
* [[Fountain of Endless Elixirs]]: A shop where any magical or non-magical liquid could be purchased.
* [[Genie's Wish]]: A high-priced shop for new visitors to the city. It was in a stalactite shaped like a [[Calimshan|Calishite]] minaret so it was easily recognizable. Any visitors asking for help buying something were directed here where they were regularly tricked into buying cursed or nearly depleted items. Those who were experienced enough not to be fooled could utilize the shop's large inventory and its item location and retrieval service for a large non-refundable handler's fee. Prices were usually doubled on top of that for items found this way.
* [[Jacinth Rose]]: Located right in the middle of the Dark Weavings Bazaar, here, one could buy [[gem]]stones from all over [[Faer√ªn]] and some parts of [[Kara-Tur]]. Magical gems were sometimes available but non-drow were discouraged from buying them.
* [[Great Elixir]]: The most famous tavern in the city. It was rumored that one could get any alcoholic beverage from the Realms Above or Below here. A pool in the center of the open-air court was filled by the slow drip of a stalactite above. Patrons tried to convince gullible visitors that it had magical properties but all it contained was guano runoff.
* [[Lukhorn's Gullet]]: Located on the south edge of the bazaar, it was famous for its excellent meals. They could cater to ''any'' sentient being, regardless of palate. It was a series of ringed platforms, one atop the other, two of which were enclosed with ''[[Wall of force|walls of force]]'' and flooded with water (one salt, one fresh) to accommodate aquatic patrons. Another housed flame-dwelling creatures. Drow servers used ''[[Levitate|levitation]]'' to quickly access each of the rings and serve customers.
* [[Shattered Scepter]]: Located far from the center of Sshamath in the west, this inn was formed from a stalactite that fell and split into two parts. One part was used as a stable while the other formed the main building. The inn had over a dozen rooms for paying customers but the establishment was known as a place of ill repute.
* [[Gloura's Wings]]: A small [[festhall]] on the western edge of the bazaar. It was famous for a song written about the place that was popular among [[bard]]s north of [[Amn]]. Three [[gloura]]s ran the place, calling themselves the "Deep Queens", and it was staffed by beautiful minstrels and dancers.
* [[The Spider's Kiss]]: A large festhall named after the practice of some drow females of killing their mates after breeding with them, much like some spiders. This place was known for selling a variety of [[poison]]s.
* [[Darkwoods]]: A petrified forest in the southeast corner of the city that was home to the worst residents (and a few monsters). The conclave mostly ignored this sector.
