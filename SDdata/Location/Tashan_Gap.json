        "mainbody": "The Tashan Gap was a rather wide mountain pass found in northern Tashalar on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.\nThe Tashan Gap marked where the dense Black Jungles pushed through the lowland area between the Delphin Mountains in the east and the Hazur Mountains in the west. The gap measured nearly  across, yet the dense jungle made any kind of passage difficult."
