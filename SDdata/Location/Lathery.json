        "mainbody": "Lathery, also written Lachery, was a Netherese enclave of Netheril that specialized in fishing, using its mythallar to do so. It was found hovering over the Narrow Sea, moving along its shoreline.\nLathery mainly fished the Narrow Sea, using the magic of its mythallar to teleport fish (and anything else) that passed under the enclave into special cold storage chambers. These were kept constantly chilled by the spell Veridons storm. The frozen fish were then exported to other cities.\nThis technique was later fine-tuned, being able to separate, for example, crawfish and lobsters from ordinary fish and teleport them into different holding tanks. However, the determination was unscientific, and while certain creatures were teleported to particular areas, all others went to another.\nThe city was elevated to enclave status in 3357 NY (−502 DR) by Veridon.\nBy 3400 NY (−459 DR), Veridon had improved upon Latherys fishing mythallar such that it could distinguish between certain creatures and send some to different holding tanks.\nIn 3426 NY (−433 DR), the ancient white dragon Wintercloak flew under the city and found itself teleported into one of the cold storage chambers. It tore itself free and broke out into the city streets, but was confronted by Veridon and the citys arcanists. Veridon and a dozen others were killed by the dragons icy breath, but it was slain by the survivors.\nIn the Fall of Netheril of 3520 NY (−339 DR), Lathery dropped city-side-down into the Narrow Sea. When magic was restored, the survivors were transported into the cold storage chambers and quickly froze to death.\nLathery was presumably entombed beneath the High Ice when it later advanced over the Narrow Sea. Lathery was later one of those cities confirmed to have been shattered in the Fall."
