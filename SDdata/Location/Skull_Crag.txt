'''Skull Crag''' was a [[human]] hamlet in the [[Storm Horns]] to the northwest of [[Cormyr]]. It was a mining community with a population of 270 ''circa'' [[1372 DR]] The settlement was overshadowed by a large whitened [[marble]] outcropping shaped like a human skull.

==Description==
[[File:Skull Crag.png|thumb|''A 15{{th}} century [[DR]] map of Skull Crag.''|400x400px]]
Skull Crag was a squalid hamlet that reeked of [[manure]] and other fetid odors. The notable aroma was cleared only when mountain winds blew across Skull Crag. A crooked sign by the Skull Crag's gateway displayed the village's name and its population underneath. Sometimes, the numbers were crudely crossed off and "corrected" by vandals. The town was protected by a gated stockade, locked through the night; however, [[coin]] could always secure passage.

The town had several unique features, including passages and buildings cut directly out of the Storm Horns. One of such passages provided an additional connection to the [[Skull Crag Keep]] and a direct tunnel from it to the town gates. The keep itself loomed over the town ominously.

The white rock that was polished and chiseled into a skull and was used as a shrine to [[Kelemvor]], previously a shrine to [[Cyric]], and a shrine to [[Myrkul]] before that. The skull attracted pilgrims of the [[Church of Myrkul]], and later the [[Church of Cyric]], who sought revelations but many ended up being bleached bones in the crag's foothills to the delight of the abundant population of local [[vulture]]s.

==Defenses==
Skull Crag was under the protection of the Skull Crag Keep's [[Roadwarden Guard]] and its leader – the [[Roadwarden]]. The Roadwarden troops were tasked with guarding the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]] on which the town stood, ensuring trade caravans' safe passage.

==Trade==
North of the hamlet stood the [[Old Blind Mage Mountain]] – claimed by prospectors and miners who traded in [[iron]], [[nickel]], and [[copper]]. The green rolling fields north of the village were taken by mountain shepherds that produced meat, magically preserved, and sold to passing merchants and caravans.

==History==
The hamlet's Skull Crag Keep once belonged to a [[vampire]] couple, aged around 1200 by the 1360s DR. [[Khulzond]] and his consort [[Mordroka]] were forced out and the keep taken by the [[Purple Dragon Knight]]s who later established the Roadwarden Guard. Both vampires survived and swore vengeance.

By the 1360s [[DR]], Skull Crag's protector, the Roadwarden [[Arelin Starbrow]], and her son [[Vidruand]] were great heroes in the eyes of the hamlet's inhabitants. Locals liked to share old stories of the duo's heroics with Skull Crag's guests over a cup of hot [[tea]].

Some of such guests were a group of adventurers who were paid to escort a caravan to the town of Skull Crag. After the adventurers counted the reward of coin and a ''[[ring of projection]]'', they headed to the [[The Thirsty Traveler]] tavern to slake their thirst. Soon after, the group was heading out of the town, continuing on their way, when they were greeted by blasting [[horn]]s. A lone rider was galloping towards the town's gates with a body thrown across the saddle. The man was Sir [[Dutiocs]], the Chief of the local trade route protectors – the Roadwarden Guard from the Skull Crag Keep. A gang of monsters was pursuing him – [[minotaur]]s, [[ogre]]s, and several [[hill giant]]s. The adventurers aided the rider and slew the monsters. Only then did everyone realize that the dead body was none other than the Roadwarden. Arelin Starbrow was killed in a monster attack.

The monster attack was just a harbinger, and a horde soon besieged the mountain road leading towards Skull Crag and collapsed the town's underground passages. Sir Dutiocs invited the adventurers to the Skull Crag Keep, knowing that the Roadwarden Guard would need help against the horde and the recovery of the ''Arms of the Roadwarden,'' taken off Arelin's body.

Arelin's death brought her aging husband, [[Morudel]] of [[Marsember]], to Skull Crag as he was the next in the command line. Vidruand was thought to had been killed alongside his mother after missing for a long while. Morudel tasked his surviving children with the ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' recovery and asked for the hero caravan guards' help. [[Kallithrea]], [[Dazmilar]], and [[Yemandra]] were to recover the ''[[sword]]'', the ''[[shield]]'', the ''[[lance]]'', and the ''[[helmet|helm the Roadwarden]]''.

Subsequently, as the ''arms'' were recovered from roaming monsters, Vidruand revealed himself inside the Skull Crag Keep's Great Hall, hiding his pale dead face behind the horned ''Helm the Roadwarden''. He claimed that the adventurers who were aiding the keep were the villains who slew his mother and kept him hostage. Vidruand demanded the rest of the ''Arms the Roadwarden'' to slay the evildoers. His siblings, however, did not fall for the lie. Without losing a moment of surprise, Vidruand revealed his undead nature to the family and attacked them, controlling an army of [[giant rat]]s and [[mobat]]s. After a fierce battle between Vidruand and his still-living siblings, the true masterminds behind the Roadwarden and all the troubles that plagued Skull Crag revealed themselves. They declared that it was time to exact revenge on the Roadwarden Guard and take what was theirs by force. Another battle ranged. Khulzond, his consort Mordroka, a summoned swarm of monsters, vampires, and Vidruand, battled the heroes of Skull Crag, Sir Dutiocs, Dazmilar, Kallithrea, and Yemandra.

After the battle was over and the vampire menace repelled, the keep's cleric made sure no more lives were lost that day. As a result, Skull Craig was safe once again, and one of the adventurers was offered the position of the new Roadwarden. It was unknown if they agreed to take on the responsibility or if the search for a worthy leader continued.

* [[Generous General Store]], a store that traded in a wide variety of mostly mundane goods in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
*[[Molar's Artful Armourer]] and [[Molar's Very Well-Equipped Voyager]], two signs and two neighboring doors that led into a single blacksmith's shop in the 14{{th}} century DR.
*[[Temple of Tymora (Skull Crag)|Temple of Tymora]], a small shrine dedicated to [[Tymora]], The Lady Who Smiles, located on the northern side of the village.
* [[The Thirsty Traveler]], a well-renowned tavern and eatery among the caravaners in the 14{{th}} century DR, located wast of the [[manure]]-reeking stables.
*[[The Tricky Thief]], a shop of arcane miscellany and curious in the 14{{th}} century DR.
*[[The Weary Wanderer]], a small and unwelcoming inn in the 14{{th}} century DR.

==Rumors and Legends==
Old Blind Mage Mountain miners told stories of an ancient lost mine to the east of the mountain. However, no prospector ever found the fabled location, partially due to the dangers of the area and preying [[peryton]]s attached to all the fat [[sheep]] herded nearby.
