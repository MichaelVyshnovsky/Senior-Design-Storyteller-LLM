The Mount of Forgiveness was a necropolis located in Muluk, the City of Kings, in 1367 DR.
Located just outside of the walls on the southeast side of the city, this artificial mount was covered with artistic tombs and sepulchers.
The Mount of Forgiveness was the resting place for the honored dead of Muluk, including past caliphs and royal families.
The citizens of Muluk whispered that the undead of the Mount of Forgiveness tunneled out a maze of catacombs within the earth. The clergy of Muluks mosques insisted this was a simple lie instigated by jealous rivals of the city.
