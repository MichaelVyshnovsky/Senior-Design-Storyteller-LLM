        "mainbody": "Darkturret was a ruined castle located on the banks of the River Orlaphar in Gontal. Because it was exposed to the Spellplague, the ruins of Darkturret existed outside time and space.\nAs a place that existed outside time and space, the castle could shift through time, trapping within its ruins creatures and adventurers from any time period of either Abeir and Toril. The ghosts of the members of the Garrandar family were also trapped forever in Darkturret.\nAmong the rooms of Darkturret, there was one connected to a time period when the goddess Mystryl was still alive, another room connected to the year 569 DR, and another to the year 2421 DR.\nAnother room had magical crystal spheres that allowed a person to see specific historical events. Among the events showed by the spheres were\n* The creation of the yuan-ti and naga races in the Days of Thunder.\n* The first moments of Karsuss Folly.\n* The assassination of Leira at the hands of Cyric.\n* The first moments of the Spellplague.\nDarkturret was originally built long ago by a unnamed wizard to serve as its home. After being affected by the Spellplague, the original site was removed from normal time and space. In 1429 DR, members of the Garrandar family commissioned the construction of a castle in the ruins of the original Darkturret, and since nobody knew anything about the original site or the wizard who build it, historical records credited the Garrandars for building the place.\nIt was believed the Garrandars used the place to hide wealth stolen from other Twelvefold families. The other families joined forces and swiftly attacked and destroyed Darkturret in revenge. The ruined stronghold became a haunted place inhabited by terrible undead and other monsters from the Glaur Barrens and other places and time periods of Abeir and Toril."
