        "mainbody": "'''Darkturret''' was a ruined castle located on the banks of the [[River Orlaphar]] in [[Gontal]].{{Cite dragon/366/Gontal|52}} Because it was exposed to the [[Spellplague]], the ruins of Darkturret existed outside time and space.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stir Not the World's Doom|7}}",
        "Background": "As a place that existed outside time and space, the castle could shift through time, trapping within its ruins creatures and [[adventurer]]s from any time period of either [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]]. The ghosts of the members of the [[Garrandar (family)|Garrandar]] family were also trapped forever in Darkturret.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stir Not the World's Doom|8-17}}\n\nAmong the rooms of Darkturret, there was one connected to a time period when the goddess [[Mystryl]] was still alive,{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stir Not the World's Doom|9}} another room connected to the year [[569 DR]],{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stir Not the World's Doom|11}} and another to the year [[2421 DR]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stir Not the World's Doom|10}}\n\nAnother room had [[magic]]al crystal spheres that allowed a person to see specific historical events. Among the events showed by the spheres were:{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stir Not the World's Doom|13-14}}\n* The creation of the [[yuan-ti]] and [[naga]] races in the [[Days of Thunder]].\n* The first moments of [[Karsus's Folly]].\n* The assassination of [[Leira]] at the hands of [[Cyric]].\n* The first moments of the Spellplague.",
        "History": "Darkturret was originally built long ago by a unnamed [[wizard]] to serve as its home. After being affected by the Spellplague, the original site was removed from normal time and space. In [[1429 DR]], members of the Garrandar family commissioned the construction of a castle in the ruins of the original Darkturret, and since nobody knew anything about the original site or the wizard who build it, historical records credited the Garrandars for building the place.\n\nIt was believed the Garrandars used the place to hide wealth stolen from other [[Twelvefold]] families. The other families joined forces and swiftly attacked and destroyed Darkturret in revenge. The ruined stronghold became a haunted place inhabited by terrible [[undead]] and other monsters from the [[Glaur Barrens]] and other places and time periods of Abeir and Toril."
