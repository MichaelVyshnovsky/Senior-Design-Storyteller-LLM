The Shadowtop Glade was a shrine to Eilistraee in the northern part of Velarswood, near Harrowdale.
The shrine consisted of two series of caverns located on both sides of a steep-sided gully. It was named after a grove of shadowtop trees that surrounded the place.
A group of about fifty followers of Eilistraeen, drow and other elves, dwelt in the shrine.
The worshipers of Eilistraee of the Shadowtop Glade were creating a surface home there and had good relations with local humans, whom they aided when ill. 
Eilistraeen priestesses and moon-worshiping lycanthropes from the nearby Howling Hill joined together in sacred hunts to Eilistraee and Selûne when the moon was full.
