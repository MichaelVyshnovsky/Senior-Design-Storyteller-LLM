The '''Shadowtop Glade''' was a shrine to [[Eilistraee]] in the northern part of [[Velarswood]], near [[Harrowdale]].

==Geography==
The shrine consisted of two series of caverns located on both sides of a steep-sided gully. It was named after a grove of [[shadowtop|shadowtop trees]] that surrounded the place.

==Inhabitants==
A group of about fifty followers of Eilistraeen, [[drow]] and other [[elf|elves]], dwelt in the shrine.

==Activities==
The worshipers of Eilistraee of the Shadowtop Glade were creating a surface home there and had good relations with local humans, whom they aided when ill. 

Eilistraeen priestesses and moon-worshiping [[lycanthropes]] from the nearby [[Howling Hill]] joined together in sacred hunts to Eilistraee and [[Selûne]] when the moon was full.
