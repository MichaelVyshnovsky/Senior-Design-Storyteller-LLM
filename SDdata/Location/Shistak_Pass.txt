Shistak Pass was a mountain pass located in the Keryjek Ridge of the Great Glacier.
The Shistak Pass was a man-nade pass, a cut extending into the Keryjek Ridge  from the Angalpuk side and  from the Alpuk side, with the remaining  in between incomplete. This has caused issues with adventurers and travelers, who found a dead end and were forced to turn around. Bandits from Eghagu took advantage of this and often ambushed these unfortunate travelers. 
Construction on the pass began in  when the residents of Hupiik and Isenghack realized a safe passage through the Keryjek Ridge would be advantageous for travel and trade.
