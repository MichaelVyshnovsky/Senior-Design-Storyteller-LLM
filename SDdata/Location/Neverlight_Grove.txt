The '''Neverlight Grove''' was a [[myconid]] community in the [[Northdark]]. Its isolation permitted the myconids to live in peace until the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Neverlight Grove was led by the myconid sovereign [[Phylo]] for a long time.

''Circa'' [[1484 DR]], fellow sovereign [[Basidia]] led its colony to the Grove and assumed co-leadership of the community. Two years later, the [[demon lord]] [[Zuggtmoy]] considered the Neverlight Grove to be perfect for her headquarters on [[Toril]] and corrupted Phylo. With its help, Zuggtmoy slowly corrupted most of the myconids.
