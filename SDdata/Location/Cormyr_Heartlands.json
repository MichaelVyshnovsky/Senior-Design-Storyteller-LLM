        "mainbody": "he Heartlands of Cormyr was an informal region of the Forest Kingdom that was made up of the lands around the Kings Forest, which included the oldest and most important cities of the realm.\nThe popular imagination of Cormyr was largely based on the Kings Forest and the surrounding lands. This protected woodland was a site of great natural beauty, home to beasts and fey, as well as many villages and lost ruins of the realm. The forest was bordered by the farmlands that supported much of the realms population, the country estates of the nobility, and the major highways that held Cormyr together.\nThe heartlands were roughly bounded by the Storm Horns and west reaches of Cormyr, the Wyvernwater and coastal region to the east, and the Dragonmere to the south. The north was met by the Stonecliffs and broad east reaches, marking the start of the Stonelands. The heartlands were bisected by the Starwater River, which passed south from the northern Storm Horns through to the Dragonmere.\n* The River Sharragh rose in the eastern forest and flowed for a few miles, before disappearing into Plungepool and the Underdark, collecting at Lake Thalmiir and Daerbraun near the drow city of Sschindylryn.\n* The Starwater River emerged in the northern Storm Horns and passed through the Kings Forest, was joined by the smaller Tearflow stream, and eventually emptied into the Dragonmere.
