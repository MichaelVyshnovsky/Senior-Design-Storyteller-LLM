'''Rilauven''' was a relatively small and young [[drow]] city in the [[Underdark]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The city was located under an area near the surface city of [[Neverwinter]], likely in the [[Northdark]].{{speculation}} It was close to the [[illithid]] compound of [[Z'hinda Citadel]], which once belonged to the drow.

==Society==
Rilauven's [[Lolthite]] priesthood was overthrown by the worshipers of [[Vhaeraun]] in a relatively bloodless coup. The city was thereafter ruled by a council of the representatives of its Sorcere, Belaessar, Melee-Quartha, and Ultrinnan Qu'ellar, respectively, the academies of [[wizards]], [[merchant|merchants]], [[warriors]], and old noble Houses. These houses included:
* [[House Despana]]
* [[House Arabani]]
* [[House Olonrae]]
* [[House Leun]]
* [[House Pharm]]
* [[House Vaer]]

All drow members of its society, be they wizard, fighter, or cleric, were apparently treated the same, although the city's [[Archmage]], [[Malavon Despana]], who organized the coup, seemed to hold the most power and Vhaeraun was venerated above [[Lolth]]. 

==Rumors & Legends==
It was rumored that the [[Legion of the Chimera]] would attack Rilauven, and the Melee-Quartha were busy preparing battle defenses.

Apparently, the priests of Vhaeraun railed against civic battles. The Sorcere hoped that Menzoberranzan never decided to wipe them out.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Malavon Despana]]: Archmage of the Sorcere.
* [[Ginafae Despana]]: Sister of Malavon, turned into a [[drider]] and returned to drow-form later.
* [[Ilmryn Despana]]: Deceased brother of Malavon.
* [[Malfeem Despana]]: Son of Malavon and former weapon master, deceased.
* [[Dizreth Arabani]]
* [[Viizra Arabani]]: Priestess of Vhaeraun and Lolth, a Masked Traitor, First Daughter
* [[Kadresh Olonrae]]: A male drow [[cleric]] of Vhaeraun and seller of magic items
* [[Valas Belaem del Pharm]]: the [[half-drow]] who fought as a gladiator in Rilauven.
* [[Tanthalyn Rrostarr]]: A spy scouting [[Pirtelspace]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/45/An Artist's Errand|12}}
