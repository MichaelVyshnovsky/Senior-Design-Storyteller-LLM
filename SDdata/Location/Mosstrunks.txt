The Mosstrunks was an area in the heart of the Elven Court wood of Cormanthor.
This section of forest was said to be damp and always misty.
The Mosstrunks were said to be the deepest part of the Elven Court wood, and were located south of the Vale of Lost Voices and west of Essembra.
In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Daern Claundon claimed to have discovered a long-lost but remarkably intact dwarven kingdom located somewhere underground beneath the Mosstrunks. The excitement with which he told his story led to the spread of rumors that the ruins must have contained either great wealth or objects of great power.
