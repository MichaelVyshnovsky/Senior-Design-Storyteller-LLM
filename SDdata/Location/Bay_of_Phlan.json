        "mainbody": "he Bay of Phlan lay in the Moonsea near the city of Phlan.\nIt contained a small tear-shaped island, named Thorn Island. The island itself contained Sokol Keep, and a ring of rocks protected the island where many ships had broken apart on in the past. However, rowboats could navigate through the rocky coast to reach the sandy shore as long as the sailors were patient."
