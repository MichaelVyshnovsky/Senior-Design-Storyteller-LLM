Tali al-Jasmini was a janni inhabiting the Lost City of Ubar within the High Desert of Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Even among the widely attractive jann, Tali was considered to be quite beautiful.
Tali was a goal-driven individual who was eager to please her supervisor, Farad al-Meisal, though he barely took notice of her.
Tali assisted the Vizier of Ubar, Farad, in his duties.
