        "mainbody": "{{quote|Time to smash some DRAGON RIBS!}}\n'''Ribsmasher''' was an apparently mad [[human]] male [[monk]] of [[Tempus]].",
        "Personality": "His apparent madness was simply the excessive zeal of a monk in the service of Tempus.",
        "History": "Ribsmasher was locked up in the [[ogre]] [[Ghellu]]'s [[Riverguard Keep]] in [[1374 DR]]. Upon being released by the [[Kalach-Cha]] and other adventurers, Ribsmasher attacked his jailers with his bare fists.\n\nLater that year, Ribsmasher was again a captive, this time of a cult of [[Shar]]. When freed once more by the Kalach-Cha, he traveled to [[Crossroad Keep]]. Once there, he made available his abilities to passing adventurers and any rib-related smashing opportunities they might be able to offer him."
