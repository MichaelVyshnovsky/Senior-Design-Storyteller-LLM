        "mainbody": "ibsmasher was an apparently mad human male monk of Tempus.\nHis apparent madness was simply the excessive zeal of a monk in the service of Tempus.\nRibsmasher was locked up in the ogre Ghellus Riverguard Keep in 1374 DR. Upon being released by the Kalach-Cha and other adventurers, Ribsmasher attacked his jailers with his bare fists.\nLater that year, Ribsmasher was again a captive, this time of a cult of Shar. When freed once more by the Kalach-Cha, he traveled to Crossroad Keep. Once there, he made available his abilities to passing adventurers and any rib-related smashing opportunities they might be able to offer him."
