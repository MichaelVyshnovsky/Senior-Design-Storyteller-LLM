'''Solara "Sinker" Thann''' was a [[giant-killer|giantslayer]] and [[paladin]] who roamed around the [[Savage Frontier]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Solara preferred to fight her foes up close, but was willing to hang back when necessary in order to let one of the traps devised by her ally [[Lai Antolio]] do its job.

==History==
Some time after the shattering of the [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]] in [[1485 DR]], the Savage Frontier became a hotbed of squabbling [[giant]] activity. Having sworn an oath to protect the natural order of things, Solara felt it was her duty to protect against this rising threat by becoming a giantslayer. To this end, she eventually joined up with two other [[adventurer]]s to form a giantslayer organization &mdash; [[Hook, Line, and Sinker (organization)|Hook, Line, and Sinker]].
