On [[Eleasis 16|Eleasias 16]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Farmer Bortas and his wife were out at night with their wagon and [[horse]] [[Ned]] when they saw the ghost of the bandit chieftain [[Fastred]]. They fled to the [[Swamp Rat]] tavern and raised a posse of fellow farmers like Rob and Will and returned to the scene, but the ghost had vanished and they didn't dare venture into the [[Vast Swamp]]. His wife continued to have nightmares about it.

Later that year, on [[Eleint 17]], [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] went to the Swamp Rat tavern and met Bortas, as well as Rob and Will. He bought them [[Shadowdark ale]] and asked about the ghost sighting, after it was discovered to be [[Dovo]] in disguise, who was found dead. Bortas provided a full account, but no new information.

Two nights later, on [[Eleint 19]], Bortas, Rob, and Will came out of the Swamp Rat and saw Jasper and a group of townsfolk escorted by the [[Purple Dragons]] to [[Benelaius]]'s house for the investigation into Dovo's murder. Bortas thought they were going to a party, and apparently a rather grim one.
