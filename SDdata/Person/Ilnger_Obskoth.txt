'''Ilnger Obskoth''' was a male priest of [[Ilmater]] in the 9th century [[DR]]. He was the high priest of the Ilmatari town of [[Carathryn]] in the [[Purple Hills]] of [[Tethyr]].

One morning in the [[848 DR|Year of the Vigilant Familiar, 848 DR]], the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'' appeared on the altar of Ilmater in Carathryn. The Ilmatari told the story that Ilmater himself had placed it there. Ilnger Obskoth proclaimed it as "the hand of holy Ilmater made manifest among us", and it swiftly became the most venerated sacred object in Carathryn.
