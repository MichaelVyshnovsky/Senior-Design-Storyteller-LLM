        "mainbody": "'''Neb''' was a crazy serial killer in [[Baldur's Gate]] who fled to [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]] the 1360s [[DR]].It is unclear what species Neb actually is. The first game implies he is a [[gnome]], but in the second game, it alternately refers to him as a gnome and as a [[dwarf]]. Ungar Hilldark describes him as \"looking like a hill dwarf\" and his severed head is stated as coming from \"Neb the dwarf\", but he uses a gnome sprite and voiceclips, and he is referred to as a gnome in the journal and by the government officials to whom his head is delivered.",
        "Possessions": "Neb owned a ''[[Neb's Nasty Cutter|unique, magical dagger]]'' that he coated in [[poison]] before he killed.",
        "History": "Neb was an assassin in Baldur's Gate until he was caught by the [[Flaming Fist]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, and held at their headquarters in the [[Upper City]]. There he met [[Abdel Adrian]], who at that time was imprisoned within the same cell. Neb helped Abdel escape from the prison after he solved Neb's riddle, which involved the number of children he had slain.\n\nAfter the escape, Neb traveled to Athkatla. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}} he was involved in the theft of some [[illithium]] from the merchant [[Unger Hilldark]]."
