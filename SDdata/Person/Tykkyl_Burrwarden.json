        "mainbody": "Tykkyl Burrwarden was a shopkeeper in Skullport.\nTykkyl, with his twin sister Tohkkal Burrwarden, managed the shop Clockwork Wonders.\nTykkyl was the dreamer of the Burrwarden twins. He was prone to bouts of inspirational ranting and activity. He dropped whatever he was doing and began sketching out a newly formulated idea on any nearby piece of paper, napkin, or tablecloth. Often his ideas were of no application, but sometimes he devised a truly new development. Tykkyl was a pacifist at heart, and so unable to to harm someone."
