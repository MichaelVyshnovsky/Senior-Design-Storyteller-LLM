Just after their Prophet [[Rohini]] was slain upon the cathedral's altar, the Ashmadai in the catacombs managed to complete the ritual to bring forth Baelrath to the [[Prime Material Plane]], warping the stone and earth around their [[summoning circle]].\n\nThe great pit fiend enjoyed a short stay on the Prime however, as it was nearly immediately slain by the same heroes that struck down the cult's prophet moments earlier."
