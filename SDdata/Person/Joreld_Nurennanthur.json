        "mainbody": "Joreld Nerunnanthur was a War Wizard in Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.\nHe was particularly indifferent to noble lords deaths, and disliked Glathra Barcantles leadership.\nHe disliked Surgol Velard.\nIn the , Joreld was among the many War Wizards that responded in the wake of the disaster during the Council of the Dragon. He commented about the deaths of many nobles during the event while heading towards Glathra Barcantle to make their report, together with Welwyn Tracegar. They were so engrossed in their converse that they missed Amarune Whitewave running loose in the castle, and almost missed Mirt doing the same thing they dismissed him instead as probably unimportant.\nLater, he was called upon by Glathra to capture Amarune and Storm Silverhand, who wanted to talk to King Foril Obarskyr I about the blueflame ghosts sighted during the Council. Her order was cut short, and she neglected to call it again.\nHe considered the deaths of Montror Barelder and Lyrannus Tantorn to be nothing worth fighting over."
