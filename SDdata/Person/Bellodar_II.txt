'''Bellodar II''' was a 7{{th}} century king of [[Impiltur]] of the [[Durlarven Dynasty]]. He ruled the kingdom from the [[626 DR|Year of the Eagle and the Falcon, 626 DR]] to the [[642 DR|Year of of the Sifting Sands, 642 DR]].

==History==
In 626 DR, members of the [[Orbil]] family staged a coup against [[Bellodar I|King Bellodar]] and assassinated the ruling monarch in an attempt to seize the Golden Throne for their own. The rebellion was put down and Prince Bellodar II succeeded his father as king of Impiltur.

In the [[635 DR|Year of the Soldiers' Forfeit, 635 DR]], King Bellodar II marched on the city-state of [[Chessagol]]. His antagonistic military actions were ceased when [[Lamoth|King Lamoth]] offered his daughter to be wed to [[Bellodar III|Prince Bellodar III]] along with a significant dowry. Among the treasures was the [[magic]]al [[sword]] ''[[Galathos]]''.{{Cite dragon/277/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Soargar's Legacy}}
