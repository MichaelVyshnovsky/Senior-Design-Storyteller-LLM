{{quote|''Well, bless me for bein' an idiot if I haven't gone and forgotten me manners. My name be Gaelan Bayle. Ye needn't stretch your brain thinkin'–I be sure it's a name ye haven't heard.''|Gaelan Bayle}}

==Description==
Gaelan wore brown clothing and a powerful [[enchanted]] ''+3'' [[leather armor]] as well as a ''[[cloak of protection]]''. He often punctuated his speech with "Coo!" exclamations.

==Possessions==
The thief was armed with an enchanted ''+2'' [[short sword]] and a magic ''+2'' [[light crossbow]]. His missiles included regular crossbow [[bolt]]s, ''[[bolts of biting]]'', and enchanted ''+1'' crossbow bolts. In case of emergency, he carried a ''[[potion of invisibility]]'' and two ''[[potions of extra healing]]''.

==Relationships==
Gaelan Bayle's was only known to thieves and rogues of Athkatla. He had a reputation of a man of many connections and a man his word. Rogue adventurer and a companion of [[Abdel Adrien]], [[Yoshimo]], was familiar with Gaelan by reputation.

[[Brus]] was Gaelan's nephew who worked for the thief as a messenger and information gatherer.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Gaelan Bayle contacted [[Gorion's Ward]] with an offer to help find his missing sister, [[Imoen]], captured by the notorious [[Cowled Wizards]] alongside [[archmage]] [[Jon Irenicus]] for a just recompense of 20,000 [[gold]] [[coin|pieces]]. Gaelan found Abdel Adrien as he and his companions entered the [[Athkatla/River District|River District]] slums and invited him to the Shadow Thieves hideout – a home in the same district. The rogue did not know where Imoen or Jon Irenicus were taken, but he was offering to but Gorion's Ward in contact with the people who did.
