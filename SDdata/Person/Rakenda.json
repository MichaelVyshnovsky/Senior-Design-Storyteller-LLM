        "mainbody": "'''Rakenda''' was an elderly [[tiger]] who was living out his last years in [[Marigold's Menagerie]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Behavior": "Rakenda was rather peaceful and gentle around other people. He always let out a rumbling purr whenever the Menagerie's proprietor stopped by to see him.",
        "History": "For much of his life Rakenda was one of the animal performers in the [[Mooney & Sons Circus]], where he worked alongside the in-training member [[Marigold Mufflefoot]], until he became too old to continue performing. Marigold worried for weeks that Rakenda might be killed or let loose into the wild, until he came to the idea of the Menagerie and suggested it to [[Isbeau Navarne]], thus insuring that Rakenda could live out the last of his days in peace.{{Cite polyhedron/97/The Living City: The Hand of Mercy and Marigold's Menagerie|10}}",
        "Relationships": "Rakenda was rather popular among the children who visited Marigold's Menagerie and he always attracted an audience whenever he went out into the facility's exercise yard."
