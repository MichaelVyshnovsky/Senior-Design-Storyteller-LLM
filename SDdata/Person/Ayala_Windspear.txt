Ayala Windspear was an elf Harper of the late 14 century DR who saved Drogan Drogansons life after the kobold attack on Hilltop.
Ayala was a slim elf, with long dirty-blonde hair, often put into a ponytail.
A deeply caring person, Ayala was very loyal to the Harpers. She knew a great deal about herbs, toxins, and poisons and used her knowledge to help and heal others.  She was a keen healer and herbalist and worshiped the deity Mystra.
Ayala was a fellow Harper agent of Drogan and healed him back to health after he was gravely poisoned.
In the , Ayala was passing through the Silver Marches to note any strange occurrences for the Harpers when she tracked some kobolds. She knew something was wrong when the kobolds arrived in Hilltop, especially as these kobolds had traveled so far from their original home in the Nether Mountains.
With the knowledge that magical artifacts were being held in Hilltop, Ayala traveled quickly to Drogan but was too late to stop the attack. Though originally looked upon with suspicion by two of Drogans apprentices, Xanos Messarmos and Dorna Trapspringer, Ayala earned their trust and worked alongside them and the one known as Drogan Drogansons pupil in efforts to protect Hilltop. Mischa Waymeet was originally trusting of Ayala and stayed behind at Drogans school to help her with healing Drogan and protecting the school from any further attacks.
Ayala attempted to identify the poison and heal Drogan but it resisted and was later identified as a magically altered form of snake venom. Further healing required tressym tongue, charcoal, and helmthorn berries, which were collected further in town by Drogans oldest apprentice. Ayala eventually managed to heal Drogan back to full health. She also provided detailed information about the stolen artifacts to Drogans apprentices, which led to their recovery.
