'''Ayala Windspear''' was an [[elf]] [[Harper]] of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who saved [[Drogan Droganson]]'s life after the [[kobold]] attack on [[Hilltop]].

==Description==
Ayala was a slim elf, with long dirty-blonde hair, often put into a ponytail.

==Personality==
A deeply caring person, Ayala was very loyal to the Harpers. She knew a great deal about [[herb]]s, toxins, and [[poison]]s and used her knowledge to help and heal others.  She was a keen healer and herbalist and worshiped the deity [[Mystra]].

==Relationships==
Ayala was a fellow Harper agent of Drogan and healed him back to health after he was gravely poisoned.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Ayala was passing through the [[Silver Marches]] to note any strange occurrences for the Harpers when she tracked some kobolds. She knew something was wrong when the kobolds arrived in Hilltop, especially as these kobolds had traveled so far from their original home in the [[Nether Mountains]].

With the knowledge that magical artifacts were being held in Hilltop, Ayala traveled quickly to Drogan but was too late to stop the attack. Though originally looked upon with suspicion by two of Drogan's apprentices, [[Xanos Messarmos]] and [[Dorna Trapspringer]], Ayala earned their trust and worked alongside them and the one known as [[Drogan Droganson's pupil]] in efforts to protect Hilltop. [[Mischa Waymeet]] was originally trusting of Ayala and stayed behind at Drogan's school to help her with healing Drogan and protecting the school from any further attacks.

Ayala attempted to identify the poison and heal Drogan but it resisted and was later identified as a magically altered form of [[snake]] [[venom]]. Further healing required [[tressym]] tongue, charcoal, and [[helmthorn]] berries, which were collected further in town by Drogan's oldest apprentice. Ayala eventually managed to heal Drogan back to full health. She also provided detailed information about the stolen artifacts to Drogan's apprentices, which led to their recovery.
