==Possessions==
Kragmar wore a personalized ''[[Belt of the Many Arrows]]''. This girdle granted him limited regeneration abilities in addition to the powers of a regular ''Belt of the Many Arrows''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Kragmar and fellow warband leaders [[Drogthu Elfeater]] and [[Lurg Bloodspear]] were in charge of coordinating attacks against the [[Neverwinter Guard]]. Finally, Scout [[Gaelen]] of the Guard sent an [[adventurer]] to infiltrate their barracks through a secret passage and eliminate all three of them.
