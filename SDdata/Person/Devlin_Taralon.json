        "Description": "Devlin was very jittery and seemed to stammer a lot when talking. He largely feared Baeloth, as the [[drow]] would often hurt him, and thus he refused to do anything to cause himself further harm. He fought with a [[longbow]] and [[arrow]]s, wore [[studded leather]] armor, and could cast a small number of [[spell]]s."
