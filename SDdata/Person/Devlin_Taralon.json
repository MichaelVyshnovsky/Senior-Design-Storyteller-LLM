        "mainbody": "Devlin Taralon was a ranged weapons dealer and slave of Baeloth Barrityl.\nDevlin was very jittery and seemed to stammer a lot when talking. He largely feared Baeloth, as the drow would often hurt him, and thus he refused to do anything to cause himself further harm. He fought with a longbow and arrows, wore studded leather armor, and could cast a small number of spells."
