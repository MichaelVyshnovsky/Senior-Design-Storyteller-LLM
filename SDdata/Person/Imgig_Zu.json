            "The Song of Selûne": "[[File:Imgig Zu and Luna 1.jpg|thumb|right|With the wand of power, a disguised Imgig Zu and the goddess Selûne ride on winged beasts to Toril, with the rest of Imgig's people.]]Imgig Zu's history was a matter of legend, set down in the [[Song of Selûne]]. It began when the wayward young goddess [[Selûne]] traveled to another [[plane]] and was smitten by a mysterious and attractive warrior, a lord of his people. The stranger persuaded her to use her father's [[wand of power]] to transport him and his followers to [[Toril]], where they planned to settle. However, once they landed, he revealed his true form and intentions—he was the monstrous Imgig Zu and he and his people were intent on conquest and ruin. He seized her father's wand of power and intended to kill the deceived goddess.\n\nFortunately, a brave young [[wizard]] named [[Ostus Agrivar]] who was riding by raced to her rescue. Although the wizard was not powerful enough to defeat the monsters, he was capable of causing enough confusion and chaos that Selûne could escape. The goddess, now freed from her subjugation, used the only thing she had left: her own life force. Draining her life force away, she imprisoned the monsters inside a pocket dimension within a gigantic [[moonstone]], which should contain them for all time. She reduced the gem, now known as ''[[Selûne's Eye]]'', in size and gave it to Ostus for safe keeping.",
            "Escape": "However, from inside the gem, Imgig Zu somehow managed to observe a shamanic rite in which the [[elves]] of [[Shadowdale]] extracted a dark spirit from the infant [[Cybriana]], daughter of Ostus Agrivar. Imgig watched as the dark spirit transformed itself into a living being, an evil [[drow]] woman who took the name \"[[Kilili]]\". Imgig forged a magical link with Kilili, which allowed him to escape into the Realms. However, he needed Cybriana and Kilili together to release the rest of his people from ''Selûne's Eye''. Kilili fell in with Imgig, and together they hatched their scheme.{{Cite comic/Sorcerer's Moon}} \n\nImgig Zu once forcibly transported the [[fire elemental]] [[Jogaoh]] from his home [[plane]] to the world of Toril. Employing a [[Lockstone]], Imgig then trapped the powerful fire elemental in the form of a weak [[dwarf]], which in turn bound him to Toril, and furthermore used his ''[[staff of withering]]'' to drain the strength from Jogaoh's limbs. Nevertheless, Jogaoh was able to escape. Thus, Imgig placed the Lockstone atop [[Stoner's Needle]] in the [[Sword Coast]] lands with a frozen [[Basilisk|greater basilisk]] as guardian. The Lockstone also proved the key to Jogaoh's release. Its conditions were the passing of two centuries and to be touched by a living creature. Once these were met, it would restore withered or lost limbs to the one who touched it and transform them back to their original form, but also awake the greater basilisk guardian. Jogaoh feared the basilisk too much to make the climb up and take the Lockstone.{{Cite comic/The Bounty Seekers Of Manshaka|17 25}} <ref group=\"note\">The conditions of the Lockstone imply this took place at least two centuries prior to 1357 DR, so some time before [[1157 DR]]. However, the young age of Cybriana suggests a much more recent escape for Imgig. Imgig may have trapped Jogaoh some time prior to coming to Toril.",
            "The Great Awakening": "[[File:Wyvern - comic.jpg|thumb|right|Imgig Zu rides his wyvern through the wall.]]In the [[1352 DR|Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR]], riding a [[wyvern]], Imgig Zu broke through the wall and magical defenses of [[Ostus's Hold]] and attacked the aged Ostus Agrivar and his son [[Priam Agrivar|Priam]]. Imgig crippled Priam with the ''staff of withering'' and slew Ostus with a death [[spell]]. Then he seized the ''Selûne's Eye'' and left, mocking Priam for his crippled state and inability to threaten him.\n\nHowever, some six years later, Imgig Zu was yet unable to use the ''Eye''. By this time, he and Kilili had joined forces with a [[yuan-ti]], [[gargoyle]]s, [[ogre]]s, and a number of [[chasme]] minions.{{Cite comic/The Secret of Selûne's Eye|6}} Kilili had her sport with those that were brought back, testing their power in magical combat and dispatching them with ease until she found her counterpart.\n\nThe chasme brought back [[Jalma]] and two other [[elf]] women, but failed to capture Cybriana, with three killed in the process. For their failure and deaths, Imgig Zu killed the chasme leader. When the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] of Waterdeep discovered his tower, Imgig Zu sent his gargoyles to destroy them.{{Cite comic/The Bounty Seekers Of Manshaka|4}} \n\nLater, after the chasme had gone hunting for more victims and been destroyed by Cybriana and her companions, Imgig Zu observed ''Selûne's Eye'' glow like the moon, meaning that Kilili's sister was near his tower and had been found by the chasme. Kilili visited Cybriana, and lured her toward Imgig's tower.{{Cite comic/The Secret of Selûne's Eye|15-17}} Imgig's gargoyles snatched up Cybriana; when dropped, Kilili rescued her with a ''[[ring of telekinesis]]'', and Cybriana was taken into their lair. Her companions, Priam Agrivar, [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Timoth Eyesbright]], and [[Onyx the Invincible]] escaped the gargoyles and found other ways in.{{Cite comic/The Secret of Selûne's Eye|19-20, 23-24}}\n\nIn the caverns beneath Imgig's tower, Cybriana was placed inside a ''[[forcecage]]'' as Kilili stood just outside. Their proximity, both to each other and to ''Selûne's Eye'' caused the gem to glow even more brightly and to swell in size. He revealed to Cybriana the secret of his connection to Kilili. Proclaiming his triumphs before an audience of his ogre minions, Imgig Zu used the combined powers of the elven women and the stolen wand of power to open the ''Eye'' and released his long-imprisoned people into the world, to overrun and conquer the Realms. Meanwhile, Cybriana's companions battled through the ogres and into the cavern, but were ultimately subdued. Imgig gloated, threatening to kill Priam with the same spell of death he'd used to kill Ostus. But, just then, the roof of the cavern tore open and the brilliant light of the full moon—the workings of the goddess Selûne, via her avatar [[Luna]]—shone through, blinding the ogres. Cybriana urged her brother Priam to strike, and strike he did, slaying Imgig Zu in the name of their father.\n\nAt Imgig's death, the ''forcecage'' faded, and Cybriana escaped. She grabbed Kilili and the two merged into a [[Kyriani|single being]], the living key to ''Selûne's Eye''. The merged being vanished inside the gem, drawing all of Imgig's people back within, saving the Realms from devastation."

        "Description": "Imgig's natural form was of a powerfully built humanoid creature, muscular and standing 7.5 feet (2.3 meters) tall. He had scaly gray-green skin, red eyes, and a wide maw full of fangs. His great head bristled with curving horns: two protruded from the top of his head, two from the sides, and two from his jaw either side of his mouth.\n\nIn the guise of a [[humanoid]] being, he appeared to Selûne as a darkly handsome man with long black hair.\n\nIn both forms, he customarily wore a white breastplate, greaves, bracers, and armbands, decorated with curling black designs and red gems in gold settings. Behind, he wore a long green cloak.",
        "Personality": "Imgig Zu possessed a genius intellect, but was cruel, unpredictable, deceitful, and very evil. He had designs on conquest and slaughter.",
        "Abilities": "Imgig Zu commanded the magical powers of a [[magic-user]] of middling level. His spells included ''[[flesh to stone]]'' and ''[[Wall of stone]]''. He also knew a spell of death that could kill a being outright.\n\nHe also possessed a number of other, separate powers, each usable once a day. With a talent for earth-based magic, Imgig could cast ''[[Animate objects]]'' (on stone statues), ''[[earthquake]]'', ''[[move earth]]'', ''[[rock to mud]]'', and ''[[stone to flesh]]''. He could also shape-change into the form of any [[humanoid]] being. Finally, he possessed a slight resistance to magic.\n\nHowever, Imgig seemed to lack any magical ability to travel between planes.\n\nImgig was also incredibly strong.",
        "Origins": "The world or [[plane]] that Imgig Zu and his people originated from was unknown, and it may have been an alternate [[prime material plane]], one of the [[Lower Planes]], or a small demi-[[plane]]. In the [[Song of Selûne]], [[Luna]] (in truth an avatar of [[Selûne]]) described it as a plane with a forbidding blood moon palely glowing over a barren land.\n\nIt was also unknown whether Imgig's people had the same powers he wielded, though they had the same appearance and shape-changing power, and were thought to be just as evil.",
        "Possessions": "[[File:Imgig's tower.jpg|thumb|right|Imgig's tower was erected in a single night and bears his crest, as shown above.]]Imgig Zu wielded a ''[[staff of withering]]'', a powerful [[staff]] that could magically age a struck creature, and even leave the struck limbs withered and crippled. He also held the [[wand of power]] seized from [[Selûne]], in turn stolen from her father.",
        "Relationships": "Imgig Zu was ruler of a race of people like him.\n\nIn his plots in the 1350s DR, Imgig worked with [[Kilili]], a [[drow]] sorceress and the literal key to his schemes; and a led number of monstrous minion: a squad of [[chasme]] fly [[demon]]s; a [[yuan-ti]] who organized the chasme; a wing of gargoyles that guarded his tower; and a legion of [[ogre]] warriors that waited in the caverns below. At one time, he also rode a [[wyvern]]."
