Captain Redleg was the shipmaster of Ruathyms armada circa 1358 DR, and an exceptional fighter.
Shipmaster Redleg was a tall man with black hair. He had a blue tattoo of a sword across his right arm, and wore brown clothing over his barrel-chested body. He acquired the name "Redleg" when he engaged a vicious shark.
The captain was incredibly proficient at swordplay, and was even smart, wise, and very charismatic.
Redleg despised Luskan and the alliance he was magically forced into, and referred to the High Captains of Luskan as the "Low Captains".
In 1358 DR, Lord Vaalgamons failure to conquer the Savage Frontier and his subsequent death, the Zhentarim started to gather their allies. They hatched a plan to sow discord with the Lords Alliance, and suggested that Luskan should ally with Ruathym, to strengthen their efforts in blockading Waterdeep.
Luskan spies and those of the Host Tower of the Arcane were sent to convince Ruathym to join the cause. The First Axe believed the lies, but Redleg was not a fool, and tried to resist the overwhelming force. Instead of killing him, the Luskar spies and mages forced him to command his own fleet to blockade Waterdeep, or else they would slay several hostages. Next, he was ordered to attack defenseless merchants, but Redleg outright refused, and it was then that he was magically dominated by the Host Tower mages, and was made to do their bidding.
Later that year, the Heroes of Ascore, after advice from Jagaerda, made their way to Ruathym and took down the magic-users that had charmed Shipmaster Regleg. The talented swashbuckler eagerly offered his many skills to the heroes, and raised those of Ruathum to put an end to the Zhentarims plan.
