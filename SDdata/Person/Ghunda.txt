Ghunda was one of the elders, along with her husband Thurrak, of a stone giant tribe on the eastern shore of the Lake of Shadows.
Ghunda did not share the same reticence as others of her kind when dealing with others. She was more than willing to express her pessimistic view of the world, albeit after much thought.
