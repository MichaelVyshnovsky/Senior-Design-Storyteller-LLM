Shalush Myrkeer was a prominent merchant in Westgate
Shalush emigrated from Amn in 1350 DR and wanted to start his merchant house in Westgate. For a long time his aspiration to take a place in the Council of Lords was blocked by House Urdo and House Guldar, but with the deaths of both the Urdo and Guldar patriarchs, and the elevation of Houses Bleth and Cormaeril, Shalush had hope again.
