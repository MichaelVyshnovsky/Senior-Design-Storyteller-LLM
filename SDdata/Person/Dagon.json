He and his minions lurked for a long time in the [[Trench of Lopok]] and were only known as \"Those who Sleep Below\". They infested the dreams of those who swam in the Sea of Fallen Stars with nightmares. The most ambitious of the demons was Prince Dagon, who planned to overcome a pantheon of sea creatures and achieve their divine powers. To reach this goal he brought the depths of the Sea of Fallen Stars under the control of his servants and their forces. The next step was made with long-forgotten eldritch magic. He restricted the influence of the deities of the [[shalarin]] in the [[Sea of Corynactis]], on the west of [[Maztica]].{{Cite dragon/355/Volo's Guide: Demon Cults of the Realms|71}}\n\nThe next step was the creation of five \"wild tides\" to sweep large numbers of shalarin into the Sea of Fallen Stars, where his minions could slaughter them. The first wild tide began in {{Yearlink|-1509}} with the opening of the [[Wildtide Portals]] connecting the two ocean realms. Many shalarin were swept into the Sea of Fallen Stars, where roughly 70% died under the attacks of Dagon's servants. The rest were only rescued by the intervention of enemies of Dagon, like [[merfolk]].\n\nDagon repeated this tactic every 720 years and the last wild tide was in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. This time, the [[portal]] stayed and became permanent. The shalarin of [[Faerûn]] kept the portal a secret, fearing that others could use it for their own ends. But another fact was more disturbing for them. Between the fourth and fifth tide, the shalarin of their homelands near Maztica had all but abandoned their gods because they had grown silent. Instead of the gods, they began to venerate the demon Dagon and his cult became the dominant religion in the Sea of Corynactis. The shalarin of the Sea of Fallen Stars cut off the travel between their communities. But it was too late and the cult of Dagon had already taken root among their ranks and grew in secret.\n{{Fq|text = In the end, Dagon's reasons might have simply mirrored my own.
