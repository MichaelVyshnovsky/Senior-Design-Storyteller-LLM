Cujas was a powerful Netherese priest who taught at the Alchemical Seminary in Eileanar shortly before its destruction in .
Cujas specialized in the study of elemental water, liquids, and the transmutation of similar materials. She originally came to fame when she created a pool of "heavy water" that could support the weight of rock, and also managed to transmute water into an explosive fluid that had to be stabilized with sawdust. She later became a teacher at the Seminary and worked under Quintus to teach her field of elemental transmutation.
