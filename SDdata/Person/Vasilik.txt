'''Vasilik''' was one of the [[Blades of the Old Man]] as of {{yearlink|1374}}. He was tall, the only one who could look [[Sauk]] eye to eye, though he was not as robust otherwise. Pale and long-haired, he had a barbarian's look, but he had been just muscle for a guild from [[Waterdeep]] before [[Alaodin]] took him in. He took a vigil on the night of [[Tarsakh 19]] on the orders of the [[Old Man of the Mountain]] at the [[Garden of Winged Horses]] in [[Sentinelspire (fortress)|Sentinelspire]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||16}} By the next day, his remains were found on the [[Star Fountain]]. Identification was not completely conclusive, but he wasn't seen again.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||20}}
