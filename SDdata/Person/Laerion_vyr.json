        "mainbody": "Mistress Laerionvyr was a drow high priestess of Lolth who ruled a small drow settlement beneath the Stonelands in the late 15 century DR.\nSometime around the Darkening, Laerionvyr controlled a sizable group of drow, including driders, lesser priestesses, a draegloth bodyguard, and a cadre of ritualists led by Vurdin that summoned a number of slaadi allies, including the powerful gray slaad Iltharis the Terrible. The drow had a contentious relationship with a nearby group of subterranean lizardfolk, and their presence may have been discovered by adventurers that plumbed the adjacent Netherese tomb and confronting the red dragon Daeronnax."
