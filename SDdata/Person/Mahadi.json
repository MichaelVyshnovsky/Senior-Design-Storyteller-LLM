Additionally, he ran his own restaurant, called [[Infernal Rapture]], located within an self-enclosed [[demiplane]] that accompanied the traveling bazaar. Using his guise as a courteous host combined with his skill as an expert professional intermediary, Mahadi acted as an informant for his patron [[Asmodeus]].",
        "Description": "Supremely charismatic and superficially gracious, Mahadi was a master manipulator who acted as a host and moderator for various personalities that came to Avernus.",
        "Possessions": "Among his numerous possessions, Mahadi had a collection of [[soul coin]]s that contained the souls of previously defeated foes. He treated them each as a sort of confidant, coercing them for advice on his operations.",
        "Relationships": "In addition to his servants who were bound to work in the Wandering Emporium, Mahadi commanded an [[erinyes]] named [[Ilzabet]], who appeared at his beck and call."
