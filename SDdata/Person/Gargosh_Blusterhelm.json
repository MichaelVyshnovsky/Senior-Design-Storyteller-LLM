        "mainbody": "argosh Blusterhelm was a dwarf of Mithral Hall during the Elemental Evil crisis.\nGargosh devoted his life to finding the legendary axe Orcsplitter, property of King Torhild Flametongue of Besilmer, and presenting it to the elders of Clan Blusterhelm in the hopes of restoring his familys lackluster reputation. The clan elders considered this a fools plan, and the Harpers tried to sabotage him, sensing it was better not to recover the weapon, and secretly his cousin Drannin Splitshield plotted to steal the axe from him at the right time.\nIn 1491 DR, despite everything, Gargosh, with the support of the Lords Alliance, hired some adventurers to search for the axe in the Halls of the Hunting Axe in the Dessarin Valley. The Harper wizard, Ariana Riverlost, tried to stop this attempt, but eventually failed.\nHowever, soon after, he was kidnapped by Drannin, who replaced him with a doppelganger loyal to him.\nAfterward the axe was recovered by his adventurers and Drannin and the doppelganger defeated, Gargosh was freed from his prison near Yartar."
