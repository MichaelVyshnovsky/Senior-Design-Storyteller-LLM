'''Bronwyn Caradoon''' was a proprietor of an antiquities shop called the [[Curious Past]], a part-time [[adventurer]], and a member of the [[Harpers]].

==Activities==
Bronwyn was always one to share her knowledge of ancient texts and lore while making sure to pick up little gems of information&mdash;typically regarding lost or stolen items&mdash;in the process.

==Relationships==
A friend of [[Ebeneezer Stoneshaft]], Bronwyn was allied with the [[shield dwarves]] of [[Clan Stoneshaft]]. On the other hand, she was not on good terms with the [[Knights of Samular]], [[Algorind]] of [[Tyr]], or Sir [[Gareth Cormaeril]].

Bronwyn raised a girl named [[Cara]], who was the daughter of Bronwyn's estranged brother [[Dag Zoreth]].

==Possessions==
As a descendant of [[Samular]], Bronwyn had in her possession one of the three ''[[ring of Samular|rings of Samular]]''. She also possessed a ''[[bag of sending]]'' that would transport items deposited into it back to her shop Curious Past.

==History==
While growing up in [[Amn]], Bronwyn was captured by the [[Zhentarim]] and became quite the skilled counterfeiter of jewelry and coins. After purchasing her freedom, Bronwyn started dealing in antiquities and was eventually recruited by the Harpers.
