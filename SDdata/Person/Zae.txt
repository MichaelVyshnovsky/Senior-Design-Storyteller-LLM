'''Zae''' was one of the [[tiefling]] refugees from [[Elturel]], displaced after the city's [[Descent into Avernus]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Zae was a dance-loving tiefling woman with red skin, burning yellow eyes, and black hors that betrayed her hellish [[Asmodeus]] bloodline. She had blonde hair gathered in a loose bun and she wore a green dress.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Zae and all other tieflings within were outcasted from the city of Elturel. The refugees began to follow [[Hellrider]] [[Zevlor]], who led them west towards the sprawling metropolis of [[Baldur's Gate]]. The group was regularly attacked by [[goblin]]s and eventually took refuge at the [[Emerald Grove]] within a community of [[druid]]s. However, the tiefling refugees were waylaid by a goblin army â€“ the [[Cult of the Absolute]], that sought to capture or slaughter the group. Zae stayed with the group until the tieflings' fate at the fate of the Emerald Grove were decided.
