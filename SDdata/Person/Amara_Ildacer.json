        "History": "Amara was born in [[8 DR]] as a member of the [[Audark]] clan.\n\nAmara at one point joined the [[Harpers in Twilight]]. In [[711 DR]], Amara and [[Aolis Ildacer]], after a meeting with the Grand Mage [[Ualair]], Arms-Major [[Kelvhan Olortynnal]], and Councilor [[Phraan Audark]], decided to create the [[N'Vaelahr]], a covert army.\n\nIn [[712 DR]], Aolis devised and supported the [[Spider's Truce]], a secret alliance with the [[drow]] of [[House Dhuurniv]] in exchange for the drow's possession of the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]]. Despite being viewed as traitors, the allied Dhuurniv–N'Vaelahr troops fought very well against the [[Army of Darkness]]. In [[Midwinter]]–[[Alturiak 1]] of [[713 DR]], Aolis fell alongside Matron Mother [[Laele Dhuurniv]], and the Spider Truce was ended. In that battle, Laele killed Aolis from behind but afterward was quickly killed by Amara.\n\nAs the new leader of the N'Vaelahr, she continued to fight, despite no longer being permitted dealings with Myth Drannor's army for N'Vaelahr's bad reputation.\n\nAmara survived the city's fall and died in [[821 DR]].",
        "Relationship": "Amara and her husband Aolis were both able [[Akh'Faer]] officers.\n\nOnly Amara and her husband knew the identities of the Councilors that supported the N'Vaelahr."
