In 711 DR, Amara and Aolis Ildacer, after a meeting with the Grand Mage Ualair, Arms-Major Kelvhan Olortynnal, and Councilor Phraan Audark, decided to create the NVaelahr, a covert army.\nIn 712 DR, Aolis devised and supported the Spiders Truce, a secret alliance with the drow of House Dhuurniv in exchange for the drows possession of the Twisted Tower of Ashaba. Despite being viewed as traitors, the allied Dhuurniv–NVaelahr troops fought very well against the Army of Darkness. In Midwinter–Alturiak 1 of 713 DR, Aolis fell alongside Matron Mother Laele Dhuurniv, and the Spider Truce was ended. In that battle, Laele killed Aolis from behind but afterward was quickly killed by Amara.\nAs the new leader of the NVaelahr, she continued to fight, despite no longer being permitted dealings with Myth Drannors army for NVaelahrs bad reputation.\nAmara survived the citys fall and died in 821 DR.\nAmara and her husband Aolis were both able AkhFaer officers.\nOnly Amara and her husband knew the identities of the Councilors that supported the NVaelahr."
