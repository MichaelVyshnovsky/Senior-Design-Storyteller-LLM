'''Benji''' was the Principal Sniffer, a [[ghoul]], kept by [[Lucretious]], the proprietress of of the [[Circus of the Last Days]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
==Description==
Benji appeared to be an ordinary blood-splattered leather-skinned [[undead]] ghoul with limited intelligence and a docile nature, thanks to being controlled by the Circus of the Last Days. The ghoul was dressed in a colorful [[jester]]-like garb.
==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Benji could be found at the gate of Lucretious's circus in [[Rivington]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], where the extra-planar troupe performed for a short period of time, before moving on to another world. In lieu of recently surging murders in Baldur's Gate, Benji was tasked with sniffing out blood on every guest entering the circus. The ghoul was supervised by [[Klaus]], the Assistant Sniffer. One of the sniffees was the commoner man named [[Montgomery]], who brought his son to see the famed [[Dribbles]] the clown. Even though the father and the son both were clean, the boy was terrified of the blood-covered jester ghoul and refused to enter the circus.
