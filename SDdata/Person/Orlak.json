        "mainbody": "'''Orlak''', called the '''Night King''', was a powerful [[vampire]] who once ruled the city of [[Westgate]] in the 3{{rd}} and 2{{nd}} centuries before [[Dale Reckoning]].",
        "History": {
            "Legacy": "Although their master was slain, Orlak's vampire minions survived and escaped into the catacombs beneath the city. They chose a new [[Night King]] from among their number to reign over them and the city's underworld. The line of Night Kings continued into the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nFinally, in the [[1346 DR|Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR]], the then-current Night King turned one of the ''[[stasis clone]]s'' of [[Manshoon]] into a servitor vampire. Finally, in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], when released from stasis, the vampire clone ambushed and slew the next Night King. Not stopping at becoming the new Night King, he went so far as to rename himself [[Orlak II]]."
        },
        "Items": "Two unique magical treasures created and used by Orlak were the ''[[Argraal of Orlak]]'', a bloody chalice, and the ''[[Flying Fangs of the Night King]]'', a twin-bladed [[dagger]]. The two items worked in tandem to feed the vampire and bolster his power. These became the regalia claimed by the later Night Kings. Some of Orlak's personality lingered in the dagger.",
        "Description": "Orlak was never seen without a porcelain mask with a black-and-white hatched pattern that concealed all of face but his eyes.",
        "Activities": "Throughout his reign, the Night King was never sighted during the day, instead holding court only after sunset. This, and his unnatural lifespan, led many citizens to—correctly—suspect Orlak of being a vampire."
