'''Blaine''' was a [[human]] soldier of [[Fort Locke]] near the [[Mere of Dead Men]] on the [[Sword Coast North]].

==History==
Blaine was one of [[Fort Locke]]'s best soldiers (who spent decades in the Neverwinter army) that went with [[Tann]] and his men to patrol. However, they were captured by the [[Unnamed shadow priest|shadow priest]]. Repko was cornered, as the room he was in was trapped. The [[Kalach-Cha]] and [[Tann]] could've rescued him.
