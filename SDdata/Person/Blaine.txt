Blaine was a human soldier of Fort Locke near the Mere of Dead Men on the Sword Coast North.
Blaine was one of Fort Lockes best soldiers (who spent decades in the Neverwinter army) that went with Tann and his men to patrol. However, they were captured by the shadow priest. Repko was cornered, as the room he was in was trapped. The Kalach-Cha and Tann couldve rescued him.
