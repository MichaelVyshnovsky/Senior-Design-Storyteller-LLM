The Earth Spider was a terrible monster in Kozakura in 1358 DR.
Once the Earth Spider ruled over Shou Lung but he and his legion were banished by the Celestial Emperor in the Realms of Mirrors. He could not escape unless he wed a girl of Wood Spirit people. However, the Earth Spider could possess a human and used them his vessel.
One of his vessels was the evil monk Jinchin, who led a revolt against the Shimamura Clan in Kanazaki Province. In truth, the Earth Spider wanted to capture the spirit woman Onoye, one of the companions of Doin Sanehiro, in order to fulfill the conditions for his release. However, in the end, Doin killed Jinchin, ending the Earth Spiders powers over Toril.
In 1357 the Earth Spider had managed to dominate also the bakemono and goblin spider of the Keluh Valley in Chu Yuan province of Shou Lung.
