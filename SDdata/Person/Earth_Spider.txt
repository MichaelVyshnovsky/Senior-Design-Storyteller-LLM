The '''Earth Spider''' was a terrible monster in [[Kozakura]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Once the Earth Spider ruled over [[Shou Lung]] but he and his legion were banished by the [[Celestial Empire|Celestial Emperor]] in the [[Realms of Mirrors]]. He could not escape unless he wed a girl of [[Wood Spirit]] people. However, the Earth Spider could possess a [[human]] and used them his vessel.

One of his vessels was the evil [[monk]] [[Jinchin]], who led a revolt against the [[Shimamura Clan]] in [[Kanazaki]] Province. In truth, the Earth Spider wanted to capture the [[Spirit folk|spirit]] woman [[Onoye]], one of the companions of [[Doin Sanehiro]], in order to fulfill the conditions for his release. However, in the end, Doin killed Jinchin, ending the Earth Spider's powers over [[Toril]].

In 1357 the Earth Spider had managed to dominate also the [[bakemono]] and [[goblin spider]] of the [[Keluh Valley]] in [[Chu' Yuan]] province of Shou Lung.
