The '''Duchess of Wyndrake''' was a [[Noble|noblewoman]] living near [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].<ref group="note">Labelled only as "the Duchess of Wyndrake", she is technically unnamed.

==History==
Around [[1491 DR]], Duchess Wyndrake, a wealthy patron of Neverwinter, requested aid at her manor. She told the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] of an unnatural fog that had been closing in around her lands, and of the arrival of travelers called the [[Vistani]] that many believed to be responsible.
