'''Amun-Re''' was the last [[Pharaoh]] of the land of [[Bakar]] in the [[Raurin]] up until approximately the year {{yearlink|300}}. He had commissioned a theft-proof tomb, the [[Pyramid of Amun-Re]]. He called on [[Osiris]] to curse the river [[Athis]] out of existence upon his death; though the god felt bound to carry out his bidding, he also cursed the Pharaoh not to enter heaven until his tomb was plundered.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|30}}

==Death Curse==
Per the ''Book of Amun-Re'', the Pharaoh believed tomb accoutrements were necessary to make it possible to complete his trip to the afterlife. He often had nightmares as a boy that, were his tomb to be plundered, his funerary arrangements would not be sufficient to satisfy Osiris' judgement. After personally examining the damage to his beloved father's plundered tomb, he became traumatized, weeping tears of fury.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|42}}

This led him to make war on his neighbors and heavily tax his own people in order to finance the construction. During a riot in the capital, approximately on the year {{yearlink|300}},{{Amun-Re-time}} the Pharaoh called down a curse to threaten the rioting mob. In the name of his ruling staff, Osiris, and the Star of Mo-Pelar, were his heart to stop, then so would the spring of [[Athis]].

A spear came from the mob, striking the Pharaoh dead. Osiris was required to fulfill the Pharaoh's curse, as it had been called in his name, but he did not accept his soul in the afterlife, for Amun-Re's monument was supposed to be his people, not his tomb. He would not be able to enter his tomb and pass on until a mortal soul had taken away the implements by which he had called down this curse.

After his death, Amun-Re was considered the greatest of the gods in heaven westward, for he manifested his own power in his own temple: per the ''Tale of the Years'' of his priests, sacrifices of gold and food were made daily into the temple, and all that was placed in the Eastern temple disappeared, presumably claimed by Amun-Re.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|90}}

==Apparition==
By the mid-14{{th}} century DR, Amun-Re was an apparition in the area once covering the Kingdom of Bakar. He'd approach travelers every night, requesting that men of valor plunder the [[Ruling Staff]] and the [[Star of Mo-Pelar]] out of his tomb, so that he may pass on to the afterlife. The odds of being approached by the pharaoh were slim, but they were increasingly cumulative for as long as one remained in the area. Once one had been visited by the pharaoh, the apparition would repeat every night until they left Bakar. If they were within sight of the pyramid, the apparition would raise its arm to point that way.

==Relationships==
The wizard [[Martek]] had given Amun-Re the [[Star of Mo-Pelar]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|5}}
