'''Wurthek''' was a mapmaker from [[Tethyr]] who explored the jungles of [[Chult]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Wurthek was a mapmaker and an explorer, one of many who lost their lives to the grave dangers of [[Chultan Peninsula]]. He died sometime before [[1362 DR]], and his body was returned to [[Port Castigliar]]. He was buried according to [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] traditions with a simple flat gravestone that read "Here lies Wurthek of Tethyr. He has gone to chart the realms beyond." as an introduction for [[Ubtao]], when the deity was to arrive to collect the soul of the deceased adventurer. His final resting place within Port Castigliar's graveyard, adjacent to [[Ibn Engaruka]]'s general store and the headstone was carved by Ibn himself.

In 1362 DR, [[Artus Cimber]] came across the mapmaker's grave marker, covered in Chultan [[creeping vine]]s. Artus wondered if Wurthek's family know of the man's fate, even though Ibn Engaruka tried to pass the dead adventurers' names back to [[Faerûn]], it was not known if the sad news ever reached them.
