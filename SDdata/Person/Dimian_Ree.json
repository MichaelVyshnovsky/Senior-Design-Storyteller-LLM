        "History": "Dimian Ree was installed as the Baron of Morov by [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, after the [[lich]] killed most of the ruling families of Damara following his victory at the [[Ford of Goliad]]. Dimian replaced the former rulers, [[House Banacath]]. Prior to this, the Damaran capital city of Heliogabalus belonged to no single barony or duchy, but Dimian's first decree was to claim it as part of Morov and move his barony's capital from [[Morovar]]. This was considered the first sign that he had designs of one day declaring himself King of Damara.\n\nDuring the two years of Zhengyi's reign, Dimian squabbled with his neighbors and extracted tribute for the Witch-King from his subjects. He was further humbled when his forces were soundly defeated, and began to lose respect among his people when he subsequently refused to support the Bloodstone army against Zhengyi, arguing it was a suicidal effort. However, Baron Gareth Dragonsbane managed to truly defeat the Witch-King, gaining immense support and leading to an exodus of soldiers and their families out of Morov. \n\nFor the rest of 1359 DR, Dimian worked very hard to regain his support after his blunders, and soon was the principal claimant to the Damaran throne alongside Gareth Dragonsbane. and [[Carmathan]]. In order to gain more support, Dimian secretly approached both Queen [[Sambryl]] of [[Impiltur]] and the [[Grandfather of Assassins]], although only the latter agreed to assist him. and tried to sway southern merchants into supporting him with promises of trade benefits.\n\nAlthough he ultimately lost the kingship of Damara to Gareth by the end of 1359 DR, Dimian remained a powerful and defiant member of the Damaran ruling class through the 1360s DR. He maintained his alliances with both Baroness Sylvia of Ostel and [[Timoshenko]] of the [[Citadel of Assassins]] and was rumored to be carefully watching for an opportunity to supplant the king."
