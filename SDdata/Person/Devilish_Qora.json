        "mainbody": "Devilish Qora was an unsavory tiefling fighter mercenary from the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nQora had crimson skin and horns that showed her Mephistopheles tiefling bloodline. She wore her red hair in a short bob. As a warrior, Qora wore a simple breastplate and wielded a longsword.\nIn the , the opportunistic and immoral mercenary Aradin Beno set out to find the Nightsong for the mage Lorroakan. If the Nightsong, in reality a Sel√ªnite aasimar, was to reach the city of Baldurs Gate, then Beno had a band of mercenaries with questionable morals ready to attack those who sheltered her. Devilish Qora was among those mercenaries, ready to break into the Elfsong Tavern to kill and kidnap."
