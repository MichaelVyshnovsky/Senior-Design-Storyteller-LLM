        "mainbody": "Asheyron the Learned was a sage and the owner of the Elfskull Inn in Arabel in 1367 DR.\nAsheyron possessed a wealth of knowledge about monsters, particularly gorgons. He would perform lectures detailing the faiths that the different monster races followed and rituals they used during worship.\nIn a vain attempt to capitalize on his uncles will, Asheyron briefly adopted his brother Asgetrions name. The gems that he hoped to get his hands on from the will were never found, so Asheyron switched back to his own name.\nAsheyron wore an amulet of protection from petrification.\nHe was rumored to be immune to a gorgons breath weapon because of his many unscathed exposures to the attack."
