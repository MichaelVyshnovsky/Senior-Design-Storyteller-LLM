        "mainbody": "'''Cernd''' was a respected [[druid]] dedicated to the protection of nature. He served the greater balance during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''\"We are the embodiment of balance. The greater cycle will turn evenly with our influence.\"''|Cernd}}",
        "Personality": "Cernd was a focused man who was fully dedicated to serving his druidic circle and maintaining the natural order of things.\n\nA man of calm demeanor, Cernd seldom showed strong emotional reactions. He often spoke in parables and used nature-themed similes to describe the state of things.",
        "Abilities": "As a [[shapeshifter (kit)|shapeshifter]], Cernd was capable of transforming into the hybrid form of a [[werewolf]] several times per day, or less frequently, the hybrid form of a [[wolfwere]].",
        "Possessions": "Cernd owned two personal items, a ''[[cloak of the High Forest]]'' and the ''[[staff of the High Forest]]''.",
        "History": "During his younger years, Cernd spent an entire year contemplating upon his relationship with and duty to serve the natural world.\n\nIn the years prior to his ascension as a druid, Cernd lived with his wife [[Galia]], in the city of [[Athkatla]]. They had a modest home in [[Waukeen's Promenade]] that was tended to by their servant [[Fennecia]].\n\nWhen Cernd felt the call to serve nature and protect the land he left his wife behind and traveled across the realms. He spent some time with a grove in [[Cormyr]], before joining one in [[Tethyr]]. From his perspective, they decided together than this action was best for the greater good. Unbeknownst to Cernd she was pregnant and within the next nine months, gave birth to a baby. While he was away, Galia became involved with a nobleman named [[Deril]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Cernd was sent north to investigate a disturbance at a druid grove in [[Amn]]. The influence of [[Shadow Druids]] corrupted the once peaceful druid enclave creating conflict with the nearby town of [[Trademeet]]. While investigating the area Cernd was captured by the townsfolk and imprisoned. They mistakenly took him for one of the Shadow Druids responsible incarcerated him within the cells beneath the mayor's house. This delayed his investigation and prolonged the crisis."
