He often spoke in parables and used nature-themed similes to describe the state of things.\nAs a shapeshifter, Cernd was capable of transforming into the hybrid form of a werewolf several times per day, or less frequently, the hybrid form of a wolfwere.\nCernd owned two personal items, a cloak of the High Forest and the staff of the High Forest.\nDuring his younger years, Cernd spent an entire year contemplating upon his relationship with and duty to serve the natural world.\nIn the years prior to his ascension as a druid, Cernd lived with his wife Galia, in the city of Athkatla. They had a modest home in Waukeens Promenade that was tended to by their servant Fennecia.\nWhen Cernd felt the call to serve nature and protect the land he left his wife behind and traveled across the realms. He spent some time with a grove in Cormyr, before joining one in Tethyr. From his perspective, they decided together than this action was best for the greater good. Unbeknownst to Cernd she was pregnant and within the next nine months, gave birth to a baby. While he was away, Galia became involved with a nobleman named Deril.\nIn the , Cernd was sent north to investigate a disturbance at a druid grove in Amn. The influence of Shadow Druids corrupted the once peaceful druid enclave creating conflict with the nearby town of Trademeet. While investigating the area Cernd was captured by the townsfolk and imprisoned.
