'''Clyssavar''' was a [[gold dragon]] who was mentioned in legends about [[Stormwreck Isle]].

==History==
Clyssavar was one of the three great [[metallic dragon]]s who defeated the great [[red dragon]] [[Sharruth]]. Legends say that he, the [[bronze dragon]] [[Astalagan]], and the [[brass dragon]] [[Turadaer]] joined forces to battle Sharruth and confined her beneath the ocean floor.

It is unknown how exactly Clyssavar died, but it was centuries prior to the late 1400s DR and it was "a violent death". His bones could be found scattered across the rocky shoal on the north side of Stormwreck Isle. Through the centuries, this site caused many shipwrecks including the wreck of the [[Compass Rose (ship)|''Compass Rose'']]

As of the {{YearlinkName|1481}},{{Stormwreck-time}} a [[blue dragon]] [[Dragon aging|wyrmling]] named [[Sparkrender]] had taken up residence in the [[Clifftop Observatory]] on Stormwreck Isle and attempted to harness the power of the island's fallen dragons. For this cause, he ordered his [[kobold]] followers [[Mek]] and [[Minn (kobold)|Minn]] to build and paint sculptures of the five great dragons, Clyssavar among them. When a group of adventurers attempted to stop the wyrmling's ritual, the effigy of Clyssavar provided the power of the long dead dragon, unleashing 'Clyssavar's Flames' in glowing golden colors upon Sparkrender.
