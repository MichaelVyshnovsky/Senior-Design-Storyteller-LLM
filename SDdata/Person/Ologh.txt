'''Ologh''' was a male [[orc]] and [[Overking]] of the orc kingdom of [[Vastar]] in the 6th century [[DR]].

==History==
At some point, Ologh rose to the position of Overking of Vastar. He created a throne for himself and the title, holding court from the [[Hollow Mountain]].

However, Ologh the Overking was killed by the [[black dragon]] [[Iyrauroth]], dying to the wyrm's claws and fangs, in [[572 DR|the Year of Writhing Darkness, 572 DR]], leaving the position vacant. With that, Vastar descended into civil war as orcish factions battled for control across the land.

==Description==
Ologh was described as a "monstrous" orc.

==Possessions==
The [[Blazing Banner of Ologh the Overking]] was his famous battle standard and an important military artifact.{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|66}}
