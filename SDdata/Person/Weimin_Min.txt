Weimin Min was a ghostly lieutenant who served Nan Kung Chi in the Crypt of Durkon in Kara-Tur in the 14 century DR.
Weimin Min wore a set of enchanted +1 plate mail and he wielded a magic +2 mace.
Weimin Min died many moons before the late 14 century DR. In life, he was one of six trusted lieutenants who served Nan Kung Chi and continued to do the same after death. In the , the crypt faced an illithid incursion led by Goxxa the alhoon. The mind flayers consumed ancient preserved minds of the crypts dead and sought the Claw of the Black Leopard. At the same time, a vampire thief named Hexxat arrived at the tomb on the behest of her master Larloch, who sought the tombs magical treasure. A ghostly monk named Ki Chin Sang stood guard of Nan Kung Chis tomb and demanded anyone seeking entrance to defeat six of Nan Kung Chis trusted undead lieutenants who all were interred together. When Hexxat and her allies challenged the lieutenants to battle, Weimin Min was joined by Yi Niu, Borok-Tosst, Ming-hua Dai, and Jiang Dai, and, presumably, was defeated.
