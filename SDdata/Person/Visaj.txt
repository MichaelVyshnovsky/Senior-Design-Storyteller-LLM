Visaj was a male drow wizard who worked for Jarlaxle. 
Visaj first referred to himself as a merchant, and asked Gorions Ward to buy a magical rope from him for 1000 pieces of gold. He mentioned that he stole the rope from Jarlaxle, and replaced it with a fake one. He told the ward that with it, the group would be immune to Deirexs power, and could loot his mage tower.
He could be found in the headquarters of Bregan Daerthe, and was a lieutenant to his commander, Jarlaxle.
