'''Visaj '''was a male [[drow]] [[wizard]] who worked for [[Jarlaxle Baenre|Jarlaxle]]. 

== History ==
Visaj first referred to himself as a [[merchant]], and asked [[Gorion's Ward]] to buy a [[magical]] [[rope]] from him for 1000 pieces of [[gold]]. He mentioned that he stole the rope from Jarlaxle, and replaced it with a fake one. He told the ward that with it, the group would be immune to [[Deirex]]'s power, and could loot his mage tower.

He could be found in the headquarters of [[Bregan D'aerthe]], and was a lieutenant to his commander, Jarlaxle.
