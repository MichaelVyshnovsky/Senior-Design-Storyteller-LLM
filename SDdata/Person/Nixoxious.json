        "mainbody": "'''Nixoxious''' was a [[kraken priest]]ess and a member of the [[Cult of Talos]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Nixoxious was a [[tiefling]] who wore blue robes.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], Nixoxious led a group of [[berserker]]s from the Cult of Talos in an attack on the recently resettled town of [[Leilon]]. Their assault sent much of the town's inhabitants fleeing north along the [[High Road]]. The cultists captured a number of fishers and soldiers to use as [[human]] sacrifices to [[water elemental]]s that Nixoxious attempted to ritually conjure to destroy the town. However, a group of [[adventurers]] managed to defeat her after she began the ritual."
