Their assault sent much of the towns inhabitants fleeing north along the High Road. The cultists captured a number of fishers and soldiers to use as human sacrifices to water elementals that Nixoxious attempted to ritually conjure to destroy the town. However, a group of adventurers managed to defeat her after she began the ritual."
