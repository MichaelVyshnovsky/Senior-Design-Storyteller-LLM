'''Ashkabbar''' was an [[orc]] leader in [[Blingdenstone]].

==History==
In [[1478 DR]], Ashkabbar led a group of orcs into a section of Blingdenstone. They started raiding the [[deep gnome]] settlers led by [[Kargien Dissengulp]] until, in [[1479 DR]], an adventuring party hired by Kargien defeated Ashkabbar and forced the orcs to abandon the city.

==Activities==
Ashkabbar usually stayed in his camp with four burly female orcs with him at all times.
