'''Lump''' was an [[ogrillon]] residing in [[Illefarn]] around [[1480 DR]].

==Relationship==
Lump had a pet [[rat]] called [[Scratches]].

==History==
Lump's parents were killed by [[elves]].

Around 1480 DR, the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Arvik Zaltos]] instructed [[Thord Ironaxe]], his son [[Grit]], and Lump to go to [[Daggerford]] to help his apprentice [[Darwa Dalion]] to recover the [[earth key]] from inside the [[Ambergul Crypt]].

However, when Darwa, Thord, and the others found the altar to [[Ogremoch]], she tried to unlock the earth key by force and a magical trap turned her into stone. It also struck Scratches.

So Thord went back together with Grit and Lump, but Thord was captured by some [[minotaur]]s who wanted to cook and eat him.

Only Lump and Grit made it back to Illefarn with the earth key.

After giving the key to the Red Wizards, Lump went to his room to cry for Scratches's fate.

==Personality==
Lump cared a lot for Scratches but he was not very smart and could easily mistake another rat for his loved one. He hated elves for their role in killing his family.
