Lump was an ogrillon residing in Illefarn around 1480 DR.
Lump had a pet rat called Scratches.
Lumps parents were killed by elves.
Around 1480 DR, the Red Wizard of Thay Arvik Zaltos instructed Thord Ironaxe, his son Grit, and Lump to go to Daggerford to help his apprentice Darwa Dalion to recover the earth key from inside the Ambergul Crypt.
However, when Darwa, Thord, and the others found the altar to Ogremoch, she tried to unlock the earth key by force and a magical trap turned her into stone. It also struck Scratches.
So Thord went back together with Grit and Lump, but Thord was captured by some minotaurs who wanted to cook and eat him.
Only Lump and Grit made it back to Illefarn with the earth key.
After giving the key to the Red Wizards, Lump went to his room to cry for Scratchess fate.
Lump cared a lot for Scratches but he was not very smart and could easily mistake another rat for his loved one. He hated elves for their role in killing his family.
