        "History": "Hlethvagi was the leading cleric of Loviatar in the city for a long time. Circa [[1352 DR]], he discovered the [[Long Dark Stair]], a fabled and long-forgotten entrance to Undermountain. Using this exclusive passage, Hlethvagi accumulated a lot of money. With this money, he lived a comfortable life but also financed a temple for Loviatar, and finally in the {{YearlinkName|1368}} the [[House of Pain]] was completed."
