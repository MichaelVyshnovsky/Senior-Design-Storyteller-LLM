Sinensa was a myconoid who lived in Seagrove Caves beneath Stormwreck Isle in the late 15 century DR. She led her colony.
Around 1481 DR, Sinensa fell ill as a result of strange fumes emerging from within her cave. Although her fellow myconoids tried as hard as they might, they could not heal her.
A group of adventurers destroyed the crystal causing these fumes to leak into the cave, saving her.
