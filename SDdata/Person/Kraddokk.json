He traveled there, and found that it had been discovered by members of the Cult of the Dragon, who had been killed by the ice mephits that lived inside. He arrived after adventurers following the notes of the murdered treasure-hunter Veradda Stoor had discovered the shrine, and spoke to them about Annam and the Ordning.
