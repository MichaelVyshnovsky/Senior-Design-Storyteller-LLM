The self-styled Lord Byronae Trilluach was a mercenary in Skullport.
Byronae still dressed in the typical Ardeep dress. He dismissed curiosity about his noble title by affecting annoyance or making the inquirer feel ignorant that she or he did not already know, a tactic that worked well with society snobs. He was a compassionate individual.
Byronae was born in Ardeep Forest to a moon elf woman and a human mercenary. In 1367 DR, he went to Skullport and soon became the leader of one of the three most powerful mercenary groups, thank to his numerous contacts outside Waterdeep. For this, he was constantly targeted by assassins hired by his competitors until he decided to remain closed up in his villa.
