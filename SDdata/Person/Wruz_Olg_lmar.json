        "History": "Wruz was a drow who was captured by a [[mind flayer]] sect led by [[Thlorrog]]. He was used as a slave and guinea-pig for the illithid's experiments until an adventurer sent by [[Soren Ravaris]] broke into the laboratory and freed him. Wruz had already become an [[Ceremorphosis|illithid host]], but before he succumbed to death he directed the adventurer to destroy most of the illithid's resources."
