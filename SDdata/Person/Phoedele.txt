'''Phoedele''' was a [[Zhentarim]] mercenary warlord in the [[Dalelands]] around [[1479 DR]].

==History== 
In 1479 DR, Phoedele was hired by [[Barcero]], a [[Sembian]] wizard agent of the [[shadovar]], to recover the  ''[[Diamond Staff of Chomylla]]'', which was in possession of [[Imani]], a sage from [[Turmish]] residing at [[Hap]].

For this task, she hired some [[Fangfist]] [[orc]]s.

However, when Phoedele had the staff in her hands she decided to betray Barcero and went in search of the [[Uvaeren]] treasures for herself.

Phoedele and her group went to the Uvaeren ruins in [[Mistledale]] and there Phoedele was on the verge of opening a powerful ''[[selu'kiira]]'' using the Staff when her party was attacked by some [[Cult of the Dragon]] minions of [[Dretchroyaster]].

==Personality==
Phoedele always had the best interests of the [[Zhent]]s in mind and her goal was to help the Zhentarim to dominate the Heartlands like it had in the past.
