Phoedele was a Zhentarim mercenary warlord in the Dalelands around 1479 DR.
In 1479 DR, Phoedele was hired by Barcero, a Sembian wizard agent of the shadovar, to recover the  Diamond Staff of Chomylla, which was in possession of Imani, a sage from Turmish residing at Hap.
For this task, she hired some Fangfist orcs.
However, when Phoedele had the staff in her hands she decided to betray Barcero and went in search of the Uvaeren treasures for herself.
Phoedele and her group went to the Uvaeren ruins in Mistledale and there Phoedele was on the verge of opening a powerful selukiira using the Staff when her party was attacked by some Cult of the Dragon minions of Dretchroyaster.
Phoedele always had the best interests of the Zhents in mind and her goal was to help the Zhentarim to dominate the Heartlands like it had in the past.
