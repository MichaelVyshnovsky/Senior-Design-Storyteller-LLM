        "mainbody": "Patricia was the proprietor of the Den of the Seven Vales tavern and an inn in the City of Coin, Athkatla, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nPatricia was a poultry woman with a large personality who harbored disdain for males, especially for loud, brash, and stupid men. She was always glad to see women patrons enter her establishment.\nPatricia did not care for gossip and complained that her taverns customers yacked about other peoples business more than the lippiest fishwife.\nPatricia employed Alatelo De Bonito, a wizard security guard who also served as her financial advisor. The man was an aspiring bard and often tried to perform his laments to unenthused customers and Patricias irritation. She often threatened to fire Alatelo for his whaling.\nBy the , Patricias husband Richard was gone, and she was left a widow. The woman inherited the Seven Vales from Richard, who was responsible for the inns queer name. Patricias husband employed belly dancers, all of whom were fired when she took over, but Patricia did not have the hart to change the establishments name by much, simply calling it the Den of the Seven Vales. Patricia was annoyed that the inn and taverns regulars were drunk males who used to frequent the place before the ownership change. She believed that the drunks never even realized that the dancers were long gone from the Den."
