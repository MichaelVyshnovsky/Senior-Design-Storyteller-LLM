        "mainbody": "'''Aubleth Crownsilver''' was a member of the noble [[House Crownsilver]] in [[Cormyr]] around the turn of the 11{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a courtier and a member of the [[Griffon Guard]]â€”an elite unit of [[knight]]s that rode [[griffon]]s.{{Cite dragon/280/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 3|85}}",
        "Description": "Aubleth had [[amber]] eyes and blond hair that fell to his shoulders, and he kept his facial hair clean-shaven. He tended to be a bit overweight.",
        "Personality": "Aubleth was a prankster and seemed always to be laughing at something or someone, being quick with a witty remark. However, he was serious about his duty and was a brave and noble knight.",
        "Abilities": "He was a skilled rider of griffons.",
        "Activities": "For a while, he was the youngest member of the Griffon Guard, and he fought in the battle that defeated [[Thauglorimorgorus|Thauglor]], the [[black dragon]] that attacked [[Castle Obarskyr]] in the {{YearlinkName|1018}}.",
        "Relationships": "Aubleth was a good friend of [[Gardrath Roaringhorn]], also of the Griffon Guard.",
        "History": "Aubleth was one of the four people who discovered the so-called ''[[Harp of Healing]]'' in a clearing just north of [[Suzail]], shortly after the defeat of Thauglor. The others were his companions Gardrath, [[Lareth Huntsilver]], and [[Aiken Wyvernspur]]. A few months after his encounter with the harp, Aubleth apparently sleepwalked from his bed to the harp, knocked out a guard and a [[War Wizards|War Wizard]], and attempted to break the harp into pieces with his bare hands. The harp essentially called for help by emitting extremely loud music that roused more guards. When reinforcements arrived, they witnessed a spectral [[human]] woman hovering in the room who appeared to be simultaneously draining life from Aubleth and restoring the dismembered harp. War Wizards attacked with quick spells and the woman and the harp vanished. The feeble and shriveled Aubleth eventually fully recovered from his ordeal, but was unable to remember anything about the event."
