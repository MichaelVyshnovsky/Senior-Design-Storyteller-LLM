Bifely Lyeelm was the high priestess of Cyric at the temple dedicated to his worship in Mulmaster. She was half-crazed from her incessant scheming, though it had worked out somewhat as she managed to ingratiate herself to High Blade Rassendyll Uoumdolphin.
Previously a worshiper of the deity Bane, Bifely converted to the church of Cyric during the Time of Troubles. When Bane was resurrected, however, she did not forsake her new god. This led to much derision from the Black Lords clergy in Mulmaster.
