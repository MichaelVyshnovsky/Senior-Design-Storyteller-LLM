'''Volshur the Crooked''' was a priest of [[Ilmater]], of the 3rd century [[DR]], who held the title "[[Exalted Servant]]" and helped create the legendary sword ''[[Dornavver]]'', the "Demonbane".

==History==
To counter the growing spread of evil under the [[Shoon Imperium]] and a plethora of evil artifacts fashioned at the time, the [[Church of Ilmater]] sought a weapon to combat such evil. To this end, the sword ''Dornavver'' was completed in the [[275 DR|Year of the Wrath Sword, 275 DR]]. On the night of the [[Feast of the Moon]] that same year, Volshur, along with [[Archsufferer]] [[Irmakul|Irmakul "Bloodthews"]], [[Revered Brother]] [[Filithan]] and other senior clergy of Ilmater, took the sword and gathered at [[Allyn's Anvil]] in the [[Alimir Mountains]] east of [[Calimshan]]. There they conducted a holy ritual in which their impassioned prayers and howls of suffering enchanted the sword. These events were documented in the tome ''[[Relics of the Righteous]]''.
