        "mainbody": "Talanthe Truesilver was a half-elf bard who lived in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid–14 century DR. She was renowned for composing \"The Ballad of the Dream Weaver\".\nIn the late 1320s DR, then a young woman, Talanthe visited an obscure and ramshackle tavern in Secomber named the Stag. One night in the taproom, she performed a ballad of her own composition, \"The Ballad of the Dream Weaver\". For some reason, it proved to be popular, becoming one of the most well known and widely played ballads in Faerûn by the 1360s DR, with many variations. However, Talanthe used the original \"proud lady, laughing lady\" words, whereas later female singers would use \"proud lord, laughing lord\". The Stag was renamed The Seven-Stringed Harp to take advantage of the reputation.\nHer daughter was Teseryne Truesilver, who also became a bard.The Truesilver name suggests a connection to the Truesilver noble house of Cormyr, but this may just be coincidental."
