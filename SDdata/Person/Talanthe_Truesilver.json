        "mainbody": "'''Talanthe Truesilver''' was a [[half-elf]] [[bard]] who lived in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was renowned for composing \"[[The Ballad of the Dream Weaver]]\".",
        "History": "In the late 1320s DR, then a young woman, Talanthe visited an obscure and ramshackle tavern in [[Secomber]] named the Stag. One night in the taproom, she performed a ballad of her own composition, \"The Ballad of the Dream Weaver\". For some reason, it proved to be popular, becoming one of the most well known and widely played ballads in [[Faerûn]] by the 1360s DR, with many variations. However, Talanthe used the original \"proud lady, laughing lady\" words, whereas later female singers would use \"proud lord, laughing lord\". The Stag was renamed [[The Seven-Stringed Harp]] to take advantage of the reputation.",
        "Relations": "Her daughter was [[Teseryne Truesilver]], who also became a bard.{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/\"Grey Hunt\" Plot Recap}}<ref group=\"note\">The Truesilver name suggests a connection to the [[Truesilver]] noble house of [[Cormyr]], but this may just be coincidental."
