Irmakul "Bloodthews" was a priest of Ilmater from Memnon, Calimshan, of the 3rd century DR. Irmakul was an Archsufferer in the Church of Ilmater and helped create the legendary sword Dornavver, the "Demonbane".
To counter the growing spread of evil under the Shoon Imperium and a plethora of evil artifacts fashioned at the time, the Church of Ilmater sought a weapon to combat such evil. To this end, the sword Dornavver was completed in the Year of the Wrath Sword, 275 DR. As recorded in Relics of the Righteous, the senior clergy of Ilmater took the sword and gathered at Allyns Anvil in the Alimir Mountains east of Calimshan. Irmakul was present, along with Revered Brother Filithan and Exalted Servant Volshur the Crooked and many others of the church. There they conducted a holy ritual in which their impassioned prayers and howls of suffering enchanted the sword.
