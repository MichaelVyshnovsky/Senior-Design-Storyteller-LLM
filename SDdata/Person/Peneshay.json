        "mainbody": "'''Lord Peneshay''' was the leader of the [[Order of Tye]], an elite organization dedicated to guarding the members of the [[Lords' Alliance]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "Under Lord Peneshay's leadership, the Order of Tye gained significant prestige, attracting overwhelming number of young aspiring knights. Peneshay implemented rigorous and dangerous trials for the squires that sifted out the weak and left only select few alive and worthy. In 1372 [[DR]], Lord Peneshay sent three youths, Squire [[Blancheflor]], Squire [[Launfal]], and Squire [[Camelon]], to slay a deadly and fearsome beast - the [[Mighty Rat of Cunning Demeanor]], as their Knight's Trial. Subsequently, the two returned successful and brought the dreaded MRCD to Lord Peneshay as their captured prisoner."
