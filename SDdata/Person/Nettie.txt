'''Nettie''' was a healer in the [[druid]] hierarchy of the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|You know, I've spent my life treating folk and never once saw a mind flayer infection. Then suddenly there's dozens of you - maybe more. Master Halsin and I were tracking them, studying them, trying to figure out what the hells was going on.|Nettie, to an adventurer infected by a mind flayer tadpole.}}

==Personality==
She was a careful individual who would take nearly any actions needed to help keep safe the druids of her grove.

==Possessions==
Nettie wore the ''[[Key of the Ancients]]'' circlet, which bestowed upon her greater understanding of all things related to nature. She also kept with her several [[potion]]s, [[poison]]s, and other solutions, including a vial of ''[[wyvern poison]]'' and a single ''[[elixir of Silvanus]]''.

==Abilities==
[[File:Nettie,_magic.png|thumb|right|350px|''Nettie, casting a druidic spell.'']]
While Nettie was a skilled healer, her powers paled in comparison to those of her teacher and mentor.

==Relationships==
She was an apprentice to Master [[Halsin]], the [[archdruid]] of the [[Emerald Grove]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Nettie helped Halsin in his investigation of increased cases of [[ceremorphosis]] that appeared across the [[Sword Coast]]. The two found a single [[drow]], who had been infected with a [[mind flayer]] tadpole, and took the dark elf's remains back to the Emerald Grove for study.

When Master Halsin ventured off to the [[Shattered Sanctum]] to learn more, Nettie was left in charge of completing the investigation of the drow and learning whatever more she could.
