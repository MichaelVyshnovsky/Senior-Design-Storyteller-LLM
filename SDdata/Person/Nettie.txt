She was a careful individual who would take nearly any actions needed to help keep safe the druids of her grove.
Nettie wore the Key of the Ancients circlet, which bestowed upon her greater understanding of all things related to nature. She also kept with her several potions, poisons, and other solutions, including a vial of wyvern poison and a single elixir of Silvanus.

While Nettie was a skilled healer, her powers paled in comparison to those of her teacher and mentor.
She was an apprentice to Master Halsin, the archdruid of the Emerald Grove.
In the , Nettie helped Halsin in his investigation of increased cases of ceremorphosis that appeared across the Sword Coast. The two found a single drow, who had been infected with a mind flayer tadpole, and took the dark elfs remains back to the Emerald Grove for study.
When Master Halsin ventured off to the Shattered Sanctum to learn more, Nettie was left in charge of completing the investigation of the drow and learning whatever more she could.
