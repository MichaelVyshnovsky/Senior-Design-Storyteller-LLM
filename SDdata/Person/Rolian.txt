'''Rolian''' was a warrior in the [[Frostfire Banner]] adventuring party ing the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He found fatalism annoying.

==Possessions==
He carried a sword.

==History==
Rolian was a member of the Frostfire Banner when they took on High Duke [[Horostos]]'s assignment to search for the reason why all animals larger than one's hand, as well as most people, were vanishing on the road between [[Starmantle]] and [[Ripplestones]].

They were ambushed on their first night out of Starmantle by a chiming mist, [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]]. Rolian did notice the sound, but when he warned [[Paeregur]], the latter moved to the edge of the cliff where they'd stopped to check up on [[Arvas]]. In the few moments while Paeregur's back was to Rolian, the Slayer struck at him, disintegrating him; by the time Paeregur noticed, Rolian's clothes fell over, and split in three pieces.
