{{quote|I am hopeful that we shall be thoroughly entertained. I hear this fellow is monstrously droll.|Waldo Walnut}}

==Description==
Waldo was a well-dressed male [[rock gnome]] with a light skin tone, dark brown eyes, and short curly brown hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Waldo Walnut was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. He attended the "Laff Riot" show at the Elfong, a stand-up comedy performance hosted by [[Harvard Willoughby]] in Elfsong's side room with a stage. Waldo hoped the show would entertain him, as he heard that Harvard was a peculiar man and had a "smashing [[monocle]]."
