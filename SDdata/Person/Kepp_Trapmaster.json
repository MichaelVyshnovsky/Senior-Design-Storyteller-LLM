        "mainbody": "'''Kepp Trapmaster''' was an adventuring squire to [[Sirge de La Sunya]] and a member of the [[The Winter Rose]] from [[Amn]].",
        "Appearance": "Kepp was a well-groomed and clean shaven [[rock gnome]] who wielded a [[shortsword]] and a [[shortbow]] in battle.",
        "History": "Kepp gained the name Trapmaster during his days with the infamous [[Shadow Thieves]] of [[Athkatla]]. Despite his membership and accomplishments as a professional [[thief]], the gnome never liked murders and blood-soaked activities of the guild. Salvation came when Kepp was captured and sentenced to indentured servitude with the [[Church of Helm]]. Kepp Trapmaster became a squire for a noble Helmite [[paladin]] [[Sirge de La Sunya]]. With time, Kepp and Sirge became close. The gnome was not just a friend, but also a teacher for the younger man.\n\nSometime before the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, Sirge discovered a family secret, a bastard [[demon]]-born daughter, abandoned in [[Damara]] after birth. Shaken by the revelation, Sirge denounced [[House de La Sunya]] and left Amn searching for his long-lost sibling. Of course, Kepp Trapmaster followed his friend, forming an adventuring group – [[The Winter Rose]]. Later, by chance, the duo was joined by a [[half-elven]] [[druid]] [[Tianya]]. Eventually, the Winter Rose found Sirge's sister – a [[tiefling]] [[monk]] [[Naleen]]. The tiefling orphan joined the Winter Rose, not knowing that the group's leader, the so-called \"Watcher,\" was her brother. The last two members of the group were [[Llendril Coe]] and [[Dalwynd Meadsbreath]]. Kepp new adventuring troupe gained a reputation of being self-proclaimed defenders of the north."
