Despite his membership and accomplishments as a professional thief, the gnome never liked murders and blood-soaked activities of the guild. Salvation came when Kepp was captured and sentenced to indentured servitude with the Church of Helm. Kepp Trapmaster became a squire for a noble Helmite paladin Sirge de La Sunya. With time, Kepp and Sirge became close. The gnome was not just a friend, but also a teacher for the younger man.\nSometime before the , Sirge discovered a family secret, a bastard demon-born daughter, abandoned in Damara after birth. Shaken by the revelation, Sirge denounced House de La Sunya and left Amn searching for his long-lost sibling.
