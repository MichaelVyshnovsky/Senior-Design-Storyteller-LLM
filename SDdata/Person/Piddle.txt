Booyagh Piddle was a goblin spellcaster and a devout follower of the Absolute during the late 15 century DR.
Unlike many other goblins, Piddle was literate in Common and had a fairly robust vocabulary that he sought to expand.
On occasion, Piddle distracted himself from his clerical duties by spending time learning new information.
After he and his fellow goblins abducted the famed writer Volothamp Geddarm, Piddle got his hands on a copy of his latest unpublished manuscript, On Goblins My Life Among the Conquering Host.
He was subordinate to Priestess Gut and was in awe of the tremendous power bestowed upon her by the Absolute.
In the , the goblinoid cultists of the Absolute sacked the Waukeens Rest inn and made their way back to the Shattered Sanctum to celebrate. Piddle kept away from drinking, fighting, and chasing chickens, preferring to pass his time deep in study.
