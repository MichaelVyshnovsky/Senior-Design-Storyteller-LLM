Drejjd was a doppelganger inhabiting Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Drejjd was a member of the Unseen who was often hired by the owner of the Angry Coxswain, Ramas Shehepset, to masquerade as victims who were captured as slaves and magically transported to Mulhorand. Drejjds portrayal of the victims for a time after their disappearance helped keep the slavers from attracting unwanted attention from authorities.
