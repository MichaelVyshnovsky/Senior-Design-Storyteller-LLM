        "mainbody": "'''Erelgus Mistmrone''' was an eccentric painter of [[Yhaunn]], considered to be the most prestigious painter of [[Sembia]] by some in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Erelgus's fame came from his oversized paintings, which were beloved across Sembia. His works were notoriously oversizedâ€”each painting was about the size of a barn's doors. Erelgus's paintings usually depicted scenic Sembian seacoasts with waves crashing over purple-hued rocks. The paintings often showed picturesque castles and pergolas as well as figures of people wearing gowns."
