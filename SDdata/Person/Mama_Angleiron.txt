{{quote|''I think it's time you seek some professional counsel for your melancholy. Such things can't be left to brew away unchecked. You've always been a sensitive soul, and I know how heartbreak has always hurt you more than you let on. There's no shame in seeking a little aid, is there?''|Mama Angleiron}}

==History==
Mama Angleiron was the mother of Master Gyldro and some unrevealed number of his siblings. Despite Having a close relationship with his Mama, Gyldro was a lonely and sensitive soul. By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, he developed a case of [[melancholy]] that worried Mama Angleiron. She tried to encourage the master blacksmith via petter to seek professional help. His depression likely was the result of loneliness and a broken heart. Despite her pleads, Gyldro seemed be resistant to the idea.
