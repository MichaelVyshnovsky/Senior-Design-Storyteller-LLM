        "mainbody": "'''Rindon Wasatho''' was a guide for, as well as a member of, the organization known as the [[Fellowship of the Purple Staff]]. He often led new members through the [[Gulthmere Forest]] or east to the region between [[Turmish]] and the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Rindon was entirely loyal to the group and was perhaps the most trusted of their agents.",
        "Personality": "A quiet and small-framed man, Rindon was easily mistaken for a [[wild elf]]. He was particularly quiet, preferring to speak through his actions. He was also known for the extensive observation he took before deciding to make contact with a person he did not know. One being Rindon did trust was his [[animal companion]], a [[bloodhound]].",
        "Possessions": "Among Rindons possessions were a deck of ''[[Tashalan divination cards]]'' (which were given to him by his father), a ''+1 [[short sword]]'' of [[dwarven]] craftsmanship and a pair of ''[[boots of elvenkind]]''. Rindon wore masterwork [[studded leather armor]]."
