==Description==
Farrain was a large, heavily-built man with white hair.

==History==
Around the time of the [[Shadovar invasion of Wheloon]], Farrain and [[Barmar Trull]] oversaw the processing of prisoners at the docks of [[Eveningstar]] as they were loaded onto the [[Wheloon Prison boat]]. He had strong misgivings about the operation given what he had heard about the prison.
