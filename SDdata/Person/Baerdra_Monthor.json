On the day in which Lady [[Joysil Ambrur]] departed Marsember to go after [[Vangerdahast]], Baerdra Monthor made no end of venomous comments regarding the [[Obarskyr]] family, openly claiming to delight in their misfortune. She impugned [[Tanalasta Obarskyr]]'s flirtation with converting to the faith of [[Chauntea]], her romance with the traitor [[Rowen Cormaeril]], challenged the parentage of their child, [[Azoun Obarskyr V]], and questioned the honor of the regent [[Alusair Obarskyr]]."
