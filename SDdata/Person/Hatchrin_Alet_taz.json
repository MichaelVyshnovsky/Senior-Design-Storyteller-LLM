        "mainbody": "'''Hatchrin Alet'taz''' was the disgraced consort of [[Erelal Freth]] inside [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Hatchrin became the consort of Erelal Freth and fathered her unborn eleventh child around the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]]. However just after those events, Erelal accused Hatchrin of plotting to poison the unborn child after childbirth (in truth, this was a false accusation planted by [[Drivvin Freth]]) and ordered him to be imprisoned and tortured. However, Hatchrin still wanted to regain Erelal's trust. He was tortured together with the [[House Auvryndar (Menzoberranzan)|Auvryndar]] spy [[Varrn Telenna]]."
