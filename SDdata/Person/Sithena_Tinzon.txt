'''Sithena Tinzon''' was a [[Mulan]] priest of [[Bhaal]] who was working under [[Tyaral]] on {{yearlink|1372}} as his chief inquisitor and torturer. He sent her to recover [[Jarval Keth]]. {{cite web enhancement/Secrets of Imaskar|2}} 

==Personality==
Sithena was proud and cruel.

==History==
She had started life in the streets, with no intention of returning. She embraced Bhaal while young to better treat other people the way she had been treated. She did not wish to fail Tyaral, who she saw as her means to acquiring greater power. When [[Jarval Keth]] escaped and boarded a ship, she found out which one and chartered a quicker ship to catch up to him.

Though Bhaal was dead in [[1372 DR]], Sithena still received spells from him. Her early start as a street urchin had shaped her stealth skills. While trying to retrieve Jarval Keth, Sithena was decked in an [[enchanted]] full [[plate armor]] and had a ''[[cloak of resistance]]''. Had she been unable to take Jarval Keth alive, she'd have settled for just his head. Unless killed, she'd have returned to attack the adventurers again sometime along their quest. {{cite web enhancement/Secrets of Imaskar|3}}
