        "mainbody": "Rathan Thentraver () was a human cleric of Tymora and a member of the Knights of Myth Drannor during the mid–14 century DR. \nHe appreciated feasting and drinking very much and suffered from hangovers from time to time, though he did not complain about them. His trust in the Lady Luck made him a fearless man who preferred to act instead of thinking issues over.\nWhile he was overweight and rather unattractive, Rathan had a jovial and brutally honest personality.\nRathans best friend was fellow adventurer Torm, a thief.\nThe priest wielded a mace and shield in battle, the latter of which could hold onto his holy symbol.\nHe also had a ring of the ram, which he recovered after a battle with some wizards of the Zhentarim.\nBorn to Rathur and Ulla Thentraver, Rathan lost his parents at an early age to cholera, and was thrust into the church of Tymora by his greedy uncles in an effort to lay claim upon his familys wealth. Rathan was \"officially\" assigned to the temple in Arabel, by superior priest Segril, to spread the faith of Tymora among the travelers and adventurers who may need a little luck in their perilous journeys, though in all likelihood it was just to rid himself of the boisterous drunkard.\nIn 1348 DR, Rathan had a chance meeting with the Swords of Eveningstar, who had been teleported to Arabel by a dungeon trap. Shortly thereafter, he wandered to the Dalelands where he joined the Swords, who by then had renamed themselves the Knights of Myth Drannor."
