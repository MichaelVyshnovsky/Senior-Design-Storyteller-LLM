==Description==
Sakrysta had dark unkempt hair. She usually wore bizarre garments.<ref name=EotSS-p166"/>

==Personality==
She had a fierce temper and was passionate about her interests.<ref name=EotSS-p166"/>

==Activities==
Sakrysta pursued a variety of get-rich-quick schemes, usually hiring [[adventurer]]s to scour locations for select items. Her efforts had mixed results including some that were beneficial, a few [[curse]]s, and being enslaved by a [[lich]] for a decade. She acquired a strange gelatinous creature that she kept stored in a chest. When she let the creature crawl across her body it augmented her magical powers, but at the cost of draining some of her vitality.<ref name=EotSS-p166"/>
