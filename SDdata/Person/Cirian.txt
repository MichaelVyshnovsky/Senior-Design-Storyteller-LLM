Cirian was a murderer who resided in the ruined Temple of Bhaal in the Undercity of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Cirian was a human woman with light skin and brown eyes. Her head showed a half-shaven scalp and, on the opposite side, a mop of long blonde hair. When out of her civilian disguise, she wielded a common tool of her Bhaalist sect â€“ an enchanted dagger called Murderous Cut.
In the , during the Absolute crisis, Cirian led a band of murderers on a mission of venerating their evil deity through the slaughtering of innocents in the Bloomridge Park of the Lower City. It was unknown if the slaughter was commenced or if the Bhaalists were stopped and slain by the Absolute Adversaries.
