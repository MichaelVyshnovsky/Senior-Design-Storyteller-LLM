        "mainbody": "'''Melinter''' was a vile [[mage]] who inhabited the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the 1350's [[DR]].",
        "History": "Melinter organized a gang of apprentices and followers to help hatch his nefarious plans. The [[wizard]] preferred meeting in a courtyard located in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] with his followers to plan their course of actions. Melinter and his apprentices would use their [[magic]] to put any innocent bystanders to ''[[sleep]]'' in order to discuss their matters without leaving witnesses behind. The [[Melinter's Court|courtyard]] was named after Melinter following his death and his followers continued to meet there to further their master's plans."
