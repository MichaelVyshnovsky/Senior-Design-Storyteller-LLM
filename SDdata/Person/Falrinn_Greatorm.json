        "mainbody": "'''Falrinn Greatorm''' was a strange [[gnome]] smuggler in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was acquianted with [[Kleef Kenric]], topsword of the [[Marsember Watch]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, Falrinn transported the reaver [[Anton Marivaldi]] out of the city of [[Westgate]] in order to meet with the boy [[Chosen]] of [[Lathander]], [[Stedd Whitehorn]].\n\nLater on [[Uktar 2]], Falrinn transported [[Arietta Seasilver]]; [[Kleef Kenric]], [[paladin]] follower of the dead god [[Helm]]; and two Chosen, [[Malik el Sami]], follower of [[Cyric]], and [[Joelle Emmeline]], follower of [[Sune]], out of [[Marsember]] along with his ship, the ''[[Lonely Roamer]]''. His ship crossed the [[Dragonmere|Lake of Dragons]] to the southeast for two [[Tenday|tendays]], but it sank while the ship was attacked by [[Shadovar]] and then [[Yder Tanthul|Yder Tanthul's]] [[Leviathan (disambiguation)|sea monster]]. Only he, Kleef, Joelle, Malik and [[Arietta Seasilver]] survived the turbulent encounter and reached shore. Arietta gave him a letter of transfer of the ''Wave Wyvern'' that earlier departed to [[Westgate]], carrying Watchman [[Jang]], Grand Duchess [[Elira Seasilver]] and her thirty surviving subordinates during the attack on his ship. Excluding Falrinn who sought the ''Wave Wyvern'', the other four people headed across the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to [[Vilhon Reach]] in [[Turmish]], transporting the [[Eye of Gruumsh (relic)|''Eye of Gruumsh'']]."
