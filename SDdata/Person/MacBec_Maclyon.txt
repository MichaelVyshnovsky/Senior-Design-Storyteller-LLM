MacBec Maclyon, also known as Malcyon, was an evil abjurer in the Silver Marches in the midâ€“14 century DR.Formerly named "MacBec Maclyon" in The Savage Frontier and The North Guide to the Savage Frontier, his name changed to "Malcyon" in Silver Marches. It is unknown if this is an error or a deliberate change.
In the 1350s DR, MacBec Maclyon and his orc minions came to the long-abandoned Castle of Illusion in the Frost Hills. Maclyon meticulously unveiled the secrets of the Castle of Illusion and became its master, occupying it by 1358 DR. He had his orc minions seal off the lower mines.
He was still in control through 1370 DR and 1372 DR. By then, he was known as "Malcyon" and had begun summoning fiends to serve him and defend the Castle of Illusion. The wizard was not aware he was on his way to creating a second Hellgate Keep.
MacBec was served by a retinue of thirty orcs, including a magic-user or mage, a fighter as his bodyguard, and an orcish witch doctor.
By 1372 DR, Malcyon was frequently summoning dangerous fiends and making deals with dark powers to gain ever-greater magical knowledge. He had devils teach him their dark arts, protect his castle, and patrol the surrounding lands.
He was a dour man.
