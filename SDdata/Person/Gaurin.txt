Gaurin was a blightlord magic tutor of the Nar demonbinder Jesanta Berils in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, until she killed him.
Jesanta Berils uncle found the Talontar blightlord Gaurin and had him serve as Jesantas tutor in the Art on her twelfth birthday. Gaurin taught her magic in the Lady of Poison, Talonas ways, rather than sorcery as a tutor, he disciplined Jesanta for her interest in binding demons over creating diseases. However, on her eighteenth birthday, Jesanta wandered into her uncles cabin and found him dead to a Talontar poison in response, she slew Gaurin in his sleep.
Jesanta Beril later named her imp familiar Gaurin after the late blightlord.
