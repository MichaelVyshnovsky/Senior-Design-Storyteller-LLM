Sheikh Ibrin ruled the House of Hotek tribe in the Haunted Lands of interior Zakhara around 1367 DR.
Ibrin was a natural leader whose charisma attracted many followers to his cause.
Ibrin was obsessed with destroying the city of Hiyal and the corruption and wickedness that he believed it stood for. The source of this obsession was his kahin Amene.
Ibrins wife died shortly after Amene came into his life. His son Jisaron gave Amene a wide berth.
