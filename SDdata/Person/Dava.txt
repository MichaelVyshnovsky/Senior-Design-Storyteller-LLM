Dava was a female Tethyrian human evoker in Cormyr in the midâ€“14th century DR.
Dava, Mendios, and Zephan were apprentices to an evoker from Marsember.
In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, their master sent the three apprentices to the Temple of Mystra in Wheloon to make an offering to the goddess of magic. They also partook in the three-day-long ritual of Mystras Sacred Trust that the priests there were pushing, alongside nine others Durgen Glintstone, Halish, Kareem Hastith, Smote, Tholwick Styles, Veera Wavecrest, Duncan, Kenniwick, and Amnic Basult.
In the end, Starweaver Deinyn Fembrys dominated all of them with the Starry Gnosis, abducting them as part of a secret Sharran plot. They were then put on Mhairs boat across the Wyvernflow, before journeying overland to the Vast Swamp and the Lost Refuge within.
A minor mage, Dava knew the spells burning hands and magic missile, as well as some cantrips.
Wearing purple robes and armed with a simple dagger, Dava possessed a scroll of scorching ray, potions of cure moderate wounds, cure light wounds, and mage armor, and three flasks of alchemists fire.
