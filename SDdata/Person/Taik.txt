King Taik was a dwarvish clan ruler who faced an invading orc horde led by a warlord, Kumon.
Long before 1372 DR, Taik was the leader and defender of his kingdom. To defend it better, he had a powerful enchanted axe crafted using the essence of an infamous marauding orc sorcerer Sajifot. The Blood Frenzy in the hands of the King chopped down many of the invaders, eventually beheading chieftain Kumon, ending the hordes rampage once and for all. King Taik lived a long life and eventually died and was interred along with the Blood Frenzy axe in a royal tomb. With ages passing, the knowledge of the tombs location was lost. However the tomb was looted sometime long after the Kings death as the Blood Frenzy was found in the hands of Derval Ironeater of Daggerford in 1372 DR.
