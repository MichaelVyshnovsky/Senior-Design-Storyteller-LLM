'''King Taik''' was a [[dwarf|dwarvish]] clan ruler who faced an invading [[orc]] horde led by a warlord, [[Kumon]].

==History==
Long before [[1372 DR]], Taik was the leader and defender of his kingdom. To defend it better, he had a powerful [[enchanted]] [[axe]] crafted using the essence of an infamous marauding orc [[sorcerer]] [[Sajifot]]. The ''[[Blood Frenzy (axe)|Blood Frenzy]]'' in the hands of the King chopped down many of the invaders, eventually beheading chieftain Kumon, ending the horde's rampage once and for all. King Taik lived a long life and eventually died and was interred along with the ''Blood Frenzy'' axe in a royal tomb. With ages passing, the knowledge of the tomb's location was lost. However the tomb was looted sometime long after the King's death as the ''Blood Frenzy'' was found in the hands of [[Derval Ironeater]] of [[Daggerford]] in 1372 DR.
