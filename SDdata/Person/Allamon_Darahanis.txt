'''Allamon Darahanis''' was a [[Cyricist]] [[cleric]] and a [[wizard]] member of the [[Zhentarim]] who operated in the town of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]] and in the [[the Vast]] region in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
As a lowly priest of Cyric, Allamon had access to several simple [[spells]] of the [[divine]] nature, such as: ''[[cure minor wounds]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[bane]]'', ''[[protection from good]]'', and ''[[shield of faith]]''. However, as a mage, he was proficient in [[arcane]] spells from up to sixth circle of magic. Some of the more notable spells in his repertoire included ''[[Otiluke's freezing sphere]]'', ''[[teleport]]'', ''[[polymorph other]]'', ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', and ''[[mage armor]]'', among others. He also possessed the knowledge and skills of arcana and spellcraft that allowed him to empower, extend, and quicken spells.

==Possessions==
Allamon was armed with a simple [[dagger]] and wore the ''[[unholy symbol]]'' of Cyric.{{Cite organized play/LC/Ineffable Tome|27}}

==History==
On the 17{{th}} of [[Flamerule 17|Flamerule]], the {{YearlinkName|1374}},{{LCRB}} Allamon Darahanis was tasked by his superior, [[Threll Whitebane]] of the Zhentarim, to recover the recently stolen artifact â€“ a ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]''. At 7:28 AM on Flamerule 17, Allamon led a group of Zhents under the effects of the ''[[invisibility sphere]]'' spell to the home of [[Harris Redfire]] on the outskirts of Dragon Falls. Harris was a [[Mystran]] who created an inter-dimensional vault for storing evil artifacts securely out of the hands of malicious individuals and servants of dark gods. At 7:49 AM, Allamon used the ''[[passwall]]'' spell and attacked Redfire in his bedroom. By 7:52 AM, Allamon and his men subdued the Mystran mage, and with the use of the ''[[alter self]]'' spell, Allamon assumed Redfire's guise.{{Cite organized play/LC/Ineffable Tome|31}}

When a group of adventurers from the Living City arrived carrying the lockbox with the [[Banite]] ''Book of Vile Darkness'', they were created by "Harris Redfire," who attempted to fool them into leaving the tome with him. From here, the accounts of the events varied. Some claimed that the heroes entrusted him the precious cargo only to realize their mistake and confront the Zhents in a cave, also rescuing the real Harris Redfire, while others swore that Allamon Darahanis was unable to fool the group, and a spell-battle broke out. One way or another, Allamon was subdued but refused to cooperate with the heroes any further.{{Cite organized play/LC/Ineffable Tome|17}}
