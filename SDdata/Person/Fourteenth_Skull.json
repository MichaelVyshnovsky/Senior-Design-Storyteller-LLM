The Fourteenth Skull was rarely seen and when a person saw him it was usually discounted as a drunks hallucinations.\nHis true purpose in Skullport was to strengthen the mythal around Skullport known as the Mantle.  He was aided by thirteen mages that he hand selected, known as the Fray.\nThe Fourteenth Skulls background was similar to that of the other skulls.  At one time he was a drow known as the Rag Mage who moved to the Netherese enclave that became Skullport and was apparently caught in the magical backlash during Karsuss Folly.\nCategoryDrow\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryInhabitants of Skullport\nCategoryInhabitants of Undermountain\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategorySorcerers\nCategoryArchmages\nCategoryFlameskulls\nao16d774esix4z7fya6ubbs0qvfdtwx"
