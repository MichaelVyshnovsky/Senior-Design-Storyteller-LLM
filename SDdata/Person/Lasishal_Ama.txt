'''Lasishal Ama''' was the greatest [[spirit]] in the [[Northern Wastes]] of [[Kara-Tur]].

She was the most powerful [[river spirit]], famous for assisting many legendary heroes, and punishing those who had sought to despoil the land. She was presumed to live inside the [[Ama River]]. It was likely that the many [[spirit folk]] in the area had descended from her.
