Lasishal Ama was the greatest spirit in the Northern Wastes of Kara-Tur.
She was the most powerful river spirit, famous for assisting many legendary heroes, and punishing those who had sought to despoil the land. She was presumed to live inside the Ama River. It was likely that the many spirit folk in the area had descended from her.
