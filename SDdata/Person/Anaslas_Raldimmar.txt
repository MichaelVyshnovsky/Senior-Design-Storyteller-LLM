'''Anaslas Raldimmar''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|404}} to {{yearlink|407}}.

==Appearance==
Anaslas was sharp-featured and handsome.

==Personality==
He despised "brutish warriors", which meant any man of arms seeking to rule by force.

==Activities==
Anaslas loved to take the form of giant raptors ([[hawk]]s or [[owl]]s) and hunt warriors. This eventually became an obsession for him.

==History==
After tricking his teacher, [[Arghorst Talandor]], into spending most of his spells, Anaslas challenged the [[Magister]] to a duel, gaining the mantle of the Magister in the process. He spent most of his tenure obsessed with hunting warriors in the shape of a giant bird, until he was ambushed and slain by [[Eleedra Nathchant]] in {{yearlink|407}}.
