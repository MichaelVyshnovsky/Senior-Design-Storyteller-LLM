King '''Strohm II''' was a [[Half-elf|half-elven]] ruler of [[Tethyr]], the second king of the [[Strohm Dynasty]].

==Description==
In addition to being a king, Strohm was a [[druid]]. He was known as the "'''Stag King of Tethyr'''".

==Relationships==
Strohm II was the grandson of [[Strohm I]], the previous ruler. He was the great-great-great-grandfather of [[Strohm III]], who succeeded him.

==History==
Strohm II was born in [[540 DR]]. He succeeded his grandfather as king of Tethyr in [[662 DR]].

In [[687 DR]], Strohm II founded the druids' town of Mosstone.

After the [[Weeping War|Fall of Myth Drannor]], Strohm II provided a safe haven for the refugees both in his own court and in Tethyr's forests.

After defeating the small nation of [[Tathtar]] in [[731 DR]] and pushing them from the area, Strohm II officially made the wilderness region of [[wikipedia:enDuchy|Duchy]] [[Elestam]] a part of Tethyr. This territory would later become the kingdom of [[Erlkazar]].

After living nearly two centuries, the Stag King of Tethyr died in [[735 DR]]. He was succeeded by Strohm III.
