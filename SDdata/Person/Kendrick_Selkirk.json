        "mainbody": "Kendrick Selkirk was the Overmaster of Sembia for a time during the late 14 century DR, from 1372 DR to 1374 DR.\nBorn in the wealthy Selkirk family, Kendrick was an honest man. This contrasted with the rest of his family, especially his cousin Mirabeta Selkirk and her sons and nephew. \nHe was a devout follower of Tyr, to the point that his testament forbade his own resurrection because he did not wish to oppose his gods will.\nKendrick was elected Overmaster in 1371 DR after the death by old age of Elduth Yarmmaster. However, unlike his predecessor, Kendrick heavily depended on the help of his family, especially his eldest son Miklos Selkirk.\nIn 1374 DR, he sent Borstag Duncastle, then later his son Miklos to deal with the Cormanthor War.\nLater that year however, Kendrick was poisoned and killed by Rivalen Tanthul of Thultanthar. He was not resurrected as per his religious beliefs."
