        "mainbody": "'''Lyvertus Gildenhart''' was an [[elf|elven]] adventuring warrior who followed the philosophy of a [[sword]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Unlike many of his peers, Lyvertus Gildenhart did not pursue more scholarly professions; instead, becoming a fighter. Lyvertus wholeheartedly believed that it was the sword that advanced civilization rather than books and scribes. The same philosophy also guided the elf's desire to accumulate wealth. By the age of 118 years old, Lyvertus had already accumulated affluence and managed to lose it all. He financed the construction of a manor in the jungles of [[Chult]] but neglected to investigate the local dangers. The manor, the wealth, and the servants were devoured by a hive of ignominious foes â€“ [[fire ant]]s. Despite the loss, Lyvertus planned on earning [[coin]] to commission the building of another home in a less dangerous area, maybe neighboring a tribe of [[goblin]]s.\n\nSometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, Lyvertus Gildenhart was among the adventurers who were interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally queer magical ''orb'' from its depths."
