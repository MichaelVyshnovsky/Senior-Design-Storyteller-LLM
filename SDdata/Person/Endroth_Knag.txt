'''Endroth Knag''' was an old member of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] in [[Waterdeep]] in {{Yearlink|1479}}.

==Personality==
Knag hated mysteries. He never quit the Watch because he had to resolve all that he found.

==Activities==
Every night after he finished his work in the Watch, Knag went to drink at the [[Yawning Portal]] tavern, pondering on unresolved cases.

==History==
Knag had been a member of the Watch for decades. His superiors in recent years pressured him to finally resign but Knag always refused. In 1479 DR, he was concerned with two mysteries: the disappearance of an entire team of the [[Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild]] in the sewers without much blood around and the search for the notorious murderer [[Josephus Blaze]].
