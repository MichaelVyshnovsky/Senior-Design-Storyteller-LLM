'''Magdar Shenlen''' was the harbor master in [[Targos]] of the [[Ten-Towns]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Magdar Shenlen personally approached ships arriving to Targos' harbors and collected several [[gold]] [[coin]]s in docking fees. Most ship captains knew the man and expected him to show up immediately on their arrival. However, in the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Magdar failed to appear as the ''[[Wicked Wench]]'' docked, carrying mercenary adventurers from the city of [[Luskan]] to the south. Captain [[Hedron Kerdos]] smelled trouble and he was right. An army of [[Legion of the Chimera]] goblins found a way into the docks of Targos and were wreaking havoc.

Magdar retreated to one of the warehouses just off the docks and locked himself inside, surrounded by goods belonging to the [[Gallaway Coster]]. Eventually, his hiding spot was discovered by the adventurers from Luskan, with a band of goblins following them into the warehouse and attacking. Magdar allowed the adventurers access to the shipment of recently arrived ''[[Potion of healing|healing draughts]]'' from [[Bryn Shander]] and anything else they could find within the warehouse, even though it legally belonged to the Coster.
