Battlelord Boneblaster was the priest of Gloryhall, the shrine of Tempus in Halfhap in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Boneblaster was a bombastic, bold, and boisterous blood-and-thunder (mostly blood) battlepriest who promoted the bloodshed and battle of Tempus followers.
Boneblaster despised Salbaril Fortunato, the happy-go-lucky priest of Tymora at the Lodge of Luck shrine.
