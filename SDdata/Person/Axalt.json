        "mainbody": "'''Axalt''' was a [[Revered Counselor]] of [[Nexal]] who ruled over the empire in its most prosperous era in the early-to-midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Axalt ascended the throne in the {{YearlinkName|1327}} at a young age, similarly to his ancestor, [[Ipana III]] some two centuries prior. The new Revered Counselor was the grandson of [[Chalco]], the previous ruler of Nexal. The boy's tutors convinced the noblemen of Nexal that despite his youth, he had the keen mind and great instincts of a true ruler.\n\nLike so many of his predecessors, Revered Counselor Axalt faced [[Kultaka]] several times in minor conflicts, yet none were as successful as the war waged by his grandfather. The old adversary of Chalco, now the Revered Counselor of Kultaka, [[Takamal]] was unbeatable in the game of strategy, leaving the Kultakans still unsubjugated. Axalt's own son, [[Naltecona]], was the general who led several of these campaigns.\n\nHowever, it was not military conquests that made Axalt the great leader he was. The Revered Counselor oversaw the creation of the grand palace in Nexal, later referred to as the [[Palace of Axalt]], as well as the [[Aqueduct of Axalt]] that carried fresh water from [[Cicada Spring]] {{SI|8|miles|k|long=yes}} away to the center of the city. Fresh water was made available to all citizens and benefited the city greatly.\n\nThe Revered Counselor Axalt died still a young man in the {{YearlinkName|1349}}. He left Nexal in a relatively peaceful state and the empire at its strongest. Nexal was paid tribute by the subjugated [[Pezelac]], [[Huacli]], and [[Kolan]] with no rebellions, and traders did business with faraway [[Payit]]. The rule was passed along to his son Naltecona, the last Revered Counselor of Nexal, who was killed in {{YearlinkName|1361}}, by the [[Golden Legion]] of [[Amn]]."
