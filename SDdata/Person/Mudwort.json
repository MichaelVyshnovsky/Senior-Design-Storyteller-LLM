        "mainbody": "udwort was a gnoll in Maligors army in Thay as well as a reluctant Harper informant in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nMudwort was an average gnoll in his appearance. He wore misfitted crude studded leather armor with a flame on a purple field emblazoned on its chest. The same symbol adorned the round battle-worn wooden shield that Mudwort handled together with a spear. The spear was festooned with a dirty red ribbon.\nMudwort was not very bright and was somewhat clumsy and greedy. He showed paranoid tendencies in seeing the Red Wizards of Thay as secretly testing his loyalty. The gnoll spoke broken Common in short monosyllabic sentences.\nIn the , the Aglarondan council contacted a Harper druid named Galvin, tasking him with investigating Maligors activities and growing army, fearing a looming war with Thay. Mudwort was an informant and spy who met with the druid in the First Escarpment area on the shore of Lake Umber. However, the gnoll only gave information that was common knowledge in Amruthar, giving the name of the Red Wizard amassing the army but hardly anything else. Greedy for more coin, Mudwort ended the exchange of intel. Galvin, growing frustrated, tried to stop the gnoll, but instead provoked him. In the ensuing fight, Mudwort was killed by the druid, who had wildshaped into cave bear form. The gnoll died being sure that the druid was a Red Wizard, and Galvin himself was left with regrets over the needless death.\nMeanwhile, Maligor was informed by his naga assistant Asp about Mudworts strange absence, raising suspicions of him being a spy. The Red Wizard sent a darkenbeast to murder the spy. The flying beast witnessed the gnolls murder and continued following Galvin instead."
