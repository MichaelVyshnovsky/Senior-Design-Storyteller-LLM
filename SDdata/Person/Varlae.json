        "mainbody": "'''Varlae''' was a [[human]] [[cleric]] of [[Bane]] and member a [[Cult of the Dragon]] who served as a liaison to and an agent for the [[dracolich]] [[Azurphax]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "Varlae was a woman who stood {{SI|5'6\"|ft-in|c|long=yes}}.\n\nIn battle, she donned a full suit of [[:Category:Magic armor|magical]] [[plate mail]] with magical [[spiked gauntlet]]s.",
        "Abilities": "She was a powerful cleric of Bane, who focused on his [[Divine domain|domains]] of [[Hatred domain|hatred]] and [[Tyranny domain|tyranny]]. Varlae had access to a large arsenal of [[Divine magic|divine]] [[spell]]s, the most powerful of which that she typically requested from her god were perhaps ''[[blade barrier]]'' and [[Geas/Quest|''quest'']].\n\nVarlae had quick reflexes and was also trained in the crafting of [[wand]]s and [[alchemical]] items, the brewing of [[potion]]s, and the scribing of [[scroll]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Besides her armor and her [[holy symbol]] of Bane, Varlae owned a finely crafted [[crossbow]] and [[bolt]]s, an ''[[amulet of health]]'', several divine scrolls, a potion imbued with the ''[[fly]]'' spell, and wands that could [[cure serious wounds]] and [[Hold person|hold a person in place]].\n\nVarlae resided within the lair of Azurphax, in a tiny cave room about {{SI|25|feet|long=yes}} across at its widest. It had very little for decorations or furniture, with only a simple bed, a desk with [[paper]] and miscellaneous writing supplies, and a three-legged stool. The chamber was lit by a [[hooded lantern]] with a [[Continual flame|flame that never went out]], which sat on the desk. She kept a chest with about 500 [[gold pieces]] in a secret tunnel connecting her room to that of the dragon's. It was protected by a ''[[glyph of warding]]''.",
        "Activities": "As an agent for Azurphax, Varlae traveled into civilized regions on her behalf. She helped to defend the [[dragon]]'s lair with ''glyphs of warding'' and various alchemical [[trap]]s, which she and the dragon designed.\n\nWhen not on a mission for her dragon, Varlae enjoyed writing poetry about the greatness of Bane.\n\nIf the lair were ever invaded, Varlae would fight intruders from the air, after drinking her flying potion, or shoot spells at them through the safety of ''[[illusory wall]]s''. If Azurphax became injured, Varlae would tend to her wounds with her magic. If the dragon were ever to be slain, Varlae intended to return to the Cult of the Dragon to retrieve Azurphax's [[phylactery]] and bring the dracolich back."
