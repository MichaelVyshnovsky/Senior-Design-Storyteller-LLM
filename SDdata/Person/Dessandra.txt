'''Dessandra''' was a member of the [[Red Plumes]] of [[Hillsfar]] in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Harried in Hillsfar|17}}

==History==
''Circa'' Dessandra led a Red Plume patrol to a factory to retrieve the red [[dye]] that the [[Goodroot]]s produced from the [[beet]] juice harvested on their farm. However, only [[Constance Goodroot]], the daughter of the factory's owners, was there and the dye was not yet ready.{{Cite adventurers league/Harried in Hillsfar|20}}
