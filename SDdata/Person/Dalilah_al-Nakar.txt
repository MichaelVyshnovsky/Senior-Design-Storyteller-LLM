'''Dalilah al-Nakar''' was [[Grand Caliph]] [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]]'s first wife.

==Description==
Dalilah was a mature beauty in her mid 40s in [[1367 DR]]. She always carried herself like a queen.

==Personality==
Her discerning gaze noticed everything that went on in the Royal Harim.

==Relationships==
Dalilah was betrothed to Khalil when he was still an adolescent boy. She preferred the friendship of [[Zaynal ibn Sabur]] to Khalil's other wives but was friendly with all of them.

==History==
During the first years following their marriage, Khalil promised Dalilah that he would not take any more wives. Dalilah was never able to conceive children. Khalil's [[Grand Vizier]], [[Alyana al-Azzazi]], informed him of the need to father children, and Dalilah released him from his oath. Her bitterness faded over the years.
