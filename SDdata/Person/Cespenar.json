He appeared to have vanished from existence with that deity's death, but reappeared in the [[Pocket Plane (Baldur's Gate)|Pocket Plane]], which [[Gorion's Ward]] and party unconsciously created to protect themselves within Bhaal's domain.\n\nCespenar was able to upgrade and create various enchanted items from the right ingredients. Some of the items Cespenar could improve included:\n* [[Angurvadal]]\n* [[Carsomyr]]\n* [[Firetooth]]\n* [[Flail of Ages]]\n* [[Ixil's Nail]]\n* [[Keryvian]] (Foebane)\n* [[Ravager (halberd)|The Ravager]]<ref>"
