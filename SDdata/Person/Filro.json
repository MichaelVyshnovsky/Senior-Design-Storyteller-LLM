        "Relationships": "Filro kept along with him a quartet of [[hook horror]] guardians.",
        "History": "Sometime in or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Filro was among the three drow who began to search out the legendary [[Adamantine Forge]] in the Underdark underneath the [[Western Heartlands]], to the point of obsession. At one point in his search, Filro was forsaken by his companions, [[Xargrim]] and [[Dhourn Ba'Tol]], and was left to die. A pack of hook horrors found the lost drow man and fed him [[gnome|gnomish]] flesh, nursing him back to health. By 1492 DR, Filro lost his sanity and lived as a hermit alongside his hook horror pack."
