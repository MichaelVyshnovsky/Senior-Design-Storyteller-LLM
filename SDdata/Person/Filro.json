There, he kept a simple bedroll and a stack of books.\nHe carried with him a simple quarterstaff and several spell scrolls. More notably, however, he carried one of the three pieces of the powerful magic staff â€“ Mourning Frost.\nFilro kept along with him a quartet of hook horror guardians.\nSometime in or before the , Filro was among the three drow who began to search out the legendary Adamantine Forge in the Underdark underneath the Western Heartlands, to the point of obsession. At one point in his search, Filro was forsaken by his companions, Xargrim and Dhourn BaTol, and was left to die. A pack of hook horrors found the lost drow man and fed him gnomish flesh, nursing him back to health. By 1492 DR, Filro lost his sanity and lived as a hermit alongside his hook horror pack."
