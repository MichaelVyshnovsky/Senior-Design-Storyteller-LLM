        "mainbody": "'''Lamris Kholl''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Tymora]] from [[Llorkh]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] living in [[Waterdeep]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Lamris had a vivacious and unpredictable personality. She was capricious and irresponsible but remained a true worshiper of Tymora. For years, she toyed with fellow priest [[Adama Miiralin]]'s emotions but after he volunteered his help, she began to develop feelings for him.",
        "History": "Lamris hailed from Llorkh but escaped the [[Zhent]] tyranny there. After settling in Waterdeep, she started making plans to rescue her entire family from the city. Circa [[1372 DR]], with the help of Adama, Lamris finally managed to free her family."
