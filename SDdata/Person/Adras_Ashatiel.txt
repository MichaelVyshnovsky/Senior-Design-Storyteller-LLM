'''Adras Ashatiel''' was the heir of the [[Ashatiel]] noble family of [[Waterdeep]] circa the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She later served as the right hand to [[Caelar Argent]] within the [[Shining Crusade]] army.

==History==
She joined the [[armed forces of Waterdeep]] while her brother [[Arran Ashatiel]] studied as a businessman. However, Arran was killed in the {{YearlinkName|1367}} under the orders of [[Sarevok Anchev]]. Totally devastated, Adras joined the [[Shining Crusade|crusade]] of the [[Shining Lady]], in order to take vengeance against Sarevok one day.

After Sarevok was killed by his [[Bhaalspawn]] sibling, Adras turned her ire on the surviving godchild.
