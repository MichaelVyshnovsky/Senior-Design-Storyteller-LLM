'''Sil'zet Tlabbar''' was the favorite daughter of [[Ghenni Tlabbar]], [[matron mother]] of [[House Faen Tlabbar]], the fourth house of [[Menzoberranzan]] until the [[Silence of Lolth]].
==History==
Sil'zet was the oldest and favorite daughter of Ghenni. In [[1372 DR]], Ghenni was targeted by [[Nimor Imphraezl]] of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] as part of his bargain with [[House Agrach Dyrr]], who wanted Ghenni dead. Nimor infiltrated the Faen Tlabbar complex and unfortunately Sil'zet was at her mother's side at that time, so Nimor killed both Ghenni and Sil'zet.
