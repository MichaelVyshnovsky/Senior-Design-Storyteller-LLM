'''Steelclaw''' was a hairless [[cat]], the feline slayer of [[illithid]] tadpoles from the [[Moonrise Towers]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''I await the arrival of my next kill. Quiet, lest I miss its cries for mercy.''|Steelclaw the Cat}}

==Description==
Steelclaw was a female hairless cat who thought herself to be a dangerous killer and a powerful foe. She referred to [[humanoid]]s as "the furless ones."

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Steelclaw could be found just outside the walls of the Moonrise Towers in the deadly [[Shadow-cursed Lands]]. The cat traveled through lapping waters on leaking ships to get to her new hunting territory. Steelclaw found a prey she enjoyed killing â€“ illithid tadpoles birthed by the [[Absolute]], who dwelled underneath the towers. Steelclaw patiently awaited new tadpoles to emerge, only to end their lives and drink their drying cries in.
