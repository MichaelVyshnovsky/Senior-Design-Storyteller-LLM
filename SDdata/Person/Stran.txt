}}'''Stran''' was a shady-looking black marker merchant who operated out of [[Black Stone Inn]] in [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].

==Description==
Stran wore a dark leather armor that made his already pale skin appear almost ghostly. He kept his black hair in a ponytail and sported a big bold spot.

==Possessions==
Stran was selling items unavailable anywhere else in Daggerford like light and flexible armors for the roguish types, a wide selection of traps and lockpicks, as well as ''[[Zakhara|Zakharan]] [[Knockout drops]]''.

==History==
Stran could be found at the back dark corner of the [[Black Stone|Black Stone Inn]], an inn of ill repute known for loud drunks, and rowdy sailors ''circa'' 1370 DR peddling his illicit stock.
