Stran was a shady-looking black marker merchant who operated out of Black Stone Inn in Daggerford circa 1370 DR.
Stran wore a dark leather armor that made his already pale skin appear almost ghostly. He kept his black hair in a ponytail and sported a big bold spot.
Stran was selling items unavailable anywhere else in Daggerford like light and flexible armors for the roguish types, a wide selection of traps and lockpicks, as well as Zakharan Knockout drops.
Stran could be found at the back dark corner of the Black Stone Inn, an inn of ill repute known for loud drunks, and rowdy sailors circa 1370 DR peddling his illicit stock.
