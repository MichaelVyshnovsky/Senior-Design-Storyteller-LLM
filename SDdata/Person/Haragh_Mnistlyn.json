        "mainbody": "aragh Mnistlyn was an apprentice Zhentarim wizard in High Dale.\nIn 1358 DR, Haragh was a member of the secret Zhent occupation army in High Dale. He was acting as gatekeeper when he noticed Elminster Aumar and Sharantyr. They looked to be suspicious individuals in his eyes so he cast a read mind spell. However, he was instead surrounded by well-trodden grassâ€”a symptom of the Time of Troubles. Haragh remained totally shocked while Elminster subtly made jokes at him.\nWhen later an insurrection started against the Zhents, Haragh confronted Elminster and Sharantyr inside the High Castle but they managed to kill him."
