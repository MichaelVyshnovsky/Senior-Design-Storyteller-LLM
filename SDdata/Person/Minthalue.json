        "mainbody": "'''Minthalue''' was a female [[human]] [[wizard]] living in [[Suzail]] in [[Cormyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nShe was once a famed [[Calimshan|Calishite]] exotic dancer, before she went to the mage [[Kappiyan Flurmastyr]] of [[Waterdeep]] and became his apprentice. This prompted gossiping throughout Waterdeep for more than a year, but Minthalue became a notable sorceress and accomplished mage before the 1360s DR."
