        "mainbody": "Minthalue was a female human wizard living in Suzail in Cormyr in the 14 century DR.\nShe was once a famed Calishite exotic dancer, before she went to the mage Kappiyan Flurmastyr of Waterdeep and became his apprentice. This prompted gossiping throughout Waterdeep for more than a year, but Minthalue became a notable sorceress and accomplished mage before the 1360s DR."
