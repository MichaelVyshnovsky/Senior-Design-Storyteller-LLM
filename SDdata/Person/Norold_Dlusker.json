        "mainbody": "Lord '''Norold Dlusker''' was a [[patriar]] that lived in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Norold was the patriarch of the disgraced [[Dlusker]] family.",
        "Activities": "This lord made his income from animal products. Specifically, his income came from a textile mill in the [[Lower City]], slaughterhouses in the [[Outer City]], and sheepfolds outside of Baldur's Gate. He sold his wares in [[the Wide]], close by the [[Beloved Ranger]] statue.",
        "Relationships": "Norold had both an older and younger sister. His older sister contracted [[mummy rot]] and passed away, and his younger sister, [[Guinever Dlusker|Guinever]], was happily married to a young noble of the [[Caldwell]] family. This left Norold without an heir.\n\nDlusker had relations with the patriars of the Gate, as well as both the [[Flaming Fist]] and [[the Guild]]. The leader of the Guild, [[Nine-Fingers]], under the name \"Lady Keene\", had been paying his stall fees for almost 4 years. Dlusker would, if necessary, lie about her identity and claim she was his accountant.",
        "History": "In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Norold and his family supported Duke [[Valarken]] prior to Valarken's failed coup. This caused him to become disgraced. His older sister mysteriously passed away, and her husband took most of Norold's wealth to [[Waterdeep]], leaving him poor and in severe debt. In [[1482 DR]], Dlusker was investigated by Duke [[Torlin Silvershield]] for his potential links with the Guild."
