        "mainbody": "Oric Cimber was the eldest son of the highwayman known as Shadowhawk.\nAs the son of a bandit, Oric was strong and quick.\nWhile Oric was physically powerful, he lacked the brains to be a successful bandit, such as remembering to search and disarm opponents of their weapons.\nAround 1335 DR, Scoril Cimber the Shadowhawk tried to teach his ten year old son the tools of becoming a highwayman, but realized the boy was not cut out for that profession, so he turned to training Orics younger brother, Artus."
