'''Andia''' was a [[mage]] who worked aboard ''[[the Crane]]'' for a time during the mid-to-late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

Some time after the {{YearlinkName|1469}}, Andia joined the crew of ''the Crane'', to serve as the vessel's resident caster. During that time she became involved with the ship's captain, [[Harp Levesque]]. The romance did not end well for either party, and eventually Andia left the ship for other prospects.
