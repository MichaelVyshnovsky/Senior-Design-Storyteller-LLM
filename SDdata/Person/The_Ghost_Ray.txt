'''The Ghost Ray''' was the most mysterious [[ixzan]] on [[Malydren]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles]], a young ixzan living in one of Malydren's outlying settlements was blessed by the [[avatar]] of [[Ilxendren]] with the gift of transformation into a greater vampire, the first after [[Zekaqux]] and [[Phiaqiv]].

Soon rumors about him spread through the ixzan community and the ruling [[Xendreth]] understood that even the confirmation of his existence could shake the balance of power in the city. Many councilors sent expeditions to find him but the Ghost Ray was well aware of the fate that awaited him if he revealed himself at the wrong time. Thus he waited, lurking in the deepest trench of the city.
