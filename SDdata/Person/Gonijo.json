        "mainbody": "Gonijo was the emperor of Kozakura in 1357 DR.\nGonijo became emperor in 1352 DR when his father Gokammu retired. His life was completely directed by counselors of the Takenaka clan and the Hojo clan. He only needed to sign the edicts made by the counselors and perform the traditional rituals to ensure the welfare of the state.\nGonijo cared nothing for the states affairs. He would gladly resign and enter a monastery but he did not yet have an heir, so this was an impossible dream for the time being."
