}}'''Larikal Dyrr''' was a member of [[House Agrach Dyrr]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] in [[1373 DR]].

==History==
Larikal was the third daughter of matron mother [[Yasraena Dyrr]].

During the siege at Dyrr's compound for their betrayal of [[Menzoberranzan]] during the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]], Larikal happened across the archmage [[Gromph Baenre]], who had infiltrated the compound in order to destroy the Lichdrow [[Dyrr]]'s [[phylactery]]. Gromph, mistaking her for her mother, immediately killed her.<ref> After Gromph used her disguise to better infiltrate the Dyrr house temple<ref>
