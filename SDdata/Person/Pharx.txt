Pharx was a deep dragon ally of the Dragons Hoard.
In 1361 DR, Pharx was the strongest ally of the Dragons Hoard group in Skullport. In her plan to destroy them, Liriel Baenre convinced her longtime friend, the mutated deep dragon ZzPzora, to dispose of Pharx. ZzPzora approached Pharx in a Skullport bar, where he was drinking disguised as a polymorphed drow male, and seduced him. Once in his lair, she attacked him. A fierce battle ensued resulting in Pharxs death. However, ZzPzora also received fatal injures.
