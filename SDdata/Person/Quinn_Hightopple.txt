Quinn Hightopple was a halfling warrior who lived in the region of the Sword Coast North near Phandalin during the late 15 century DR.
Quinn valued his friendships and exhibited great loyalty to his friends.
He had an indomitable spirit, believing that no challenge could prove too difficult for him to beat.
The upbeat halfling had great pride in his skill as a hand-to-hand combatant. He preferred a move he dubbed the "Halfling Hello", that involved him punching a larger person in the groin.
