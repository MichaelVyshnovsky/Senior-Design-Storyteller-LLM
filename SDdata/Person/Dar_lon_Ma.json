        "mainbody": "arlon Ma () was an influential member of the Red Wizards and the zulkir of enchantment in Thay as of the late 15 century DR.\nHe had a broad build and an especially charming smile.\nDarlon Ma was a politically-minded man that wielded charisma and intimidation in equal measure in his dealings. His natural allure was only enhanced by his command over magic from the school of enchantment.\nLike other ambitious Red Wizards, Darlon Ma sought the accumulation of power with the ultimate aim of ruling all of Thay. He did not believe other nations should be considered \"allies\" of Thay, but merely other lands to be conquered.\nHe commanded complete and utter loyalty from his followers but was not a proponent of slavery, bucking long-standing Thayan tradition.\nFor years, Darlon Ma opposed the rule of Thays regent Szass Tam, a powerful lich and the centuries-old Zulkir of necromancy. His main driving goal in life was to put an end to the necromancers reign and destroy Tam by any means necessary.\nDarlon often arranged for others to become indebted to him, in order to call upon their services at a later time. The wizard Khynree from Turmish,\nHe had a strong ally in the mummy lord Elchorius, a former noble from Mulhorand and priest of Sebek, and a loyal agent in Damita Uthos, a Mulan half-sun elf who hailed from Thay.\nSome time circa the late 1480s DR, Darlon met with a group of adventurers in Waterdeep and offered them information about the whereabouts of Hekaton, the missing Storm King of Maelstrom. Shortly thereafter, Darlon manipulated those adventurers and his asset Master Reader Alsbith to retrieve for him the tome The Death of the Mind from within the Tomb of the Nine Gods in far off Chult.\nLater on, Darlon tasked his servant Damita to commit to a raid against a cache of Szass Tams arcane holdings in Mulmaster. Unfortunately the group accompanying Damita was infiltrated by loyalists of Szass Tam and ambushed Damita and her adventurer companions. Afterwards, Darlon Ma was declared to be traitors, and forced to act in open defiance of Thays regent. Darlon became the target of Szass Tams assassins and was forced into hiding.\nDarlon Ma meanwhile set up an ambush for Szass Tam in the recently-excavated Abeiran ruin of Xorvintroth. He developed a ritual using The Death of the Mind that could destroy the connection that the undead Tam held with his phylactery. Darlon took over Szass Tams undead body, and two zulkirs each fought the other throughout the city, until the battled neared closer to a portal to the Far Realmâ€”a place where the rules of arcana regarding liches and their phylacteries did not exist. \nMasquerading as Darlon Ma himself, Szass Tam drew the enchanters adventurer allies into the Far Ream in order to stop the real Darlon Ma from completing the ritual to disenchant Tams phylactery. In their final showdown, the two zulkirs fought a terrible battle in the otherworldly space, as the Brood of an ancient elder evil descended upon interlopers from the Prime. In the end Szass Tam was defeated, though it was unknown if he was destroyed outright, or otherwise cast off or bound to the Far Realm. While Darlon Mas fate was equally unclear, his goal of bringing down the rule Szass Tam was finally achieved."
