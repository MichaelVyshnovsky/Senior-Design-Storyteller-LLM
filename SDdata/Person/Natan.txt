Natan was a shadar-kai high priest of Tempus in the city of Ikemmu in the Shadowfell.  He was a close friend and advisor to Uwan, Ikemmus leader. Natan regularly received visions that he believed to be from Tempus himself.  He was murdered by a shadar-kai warrior named Vedoran in 1479 DR during a plot to start an uprising in Ikemmu.	
Natan was the witch Ilvanis twin brother.	
Although not very old by shadar-kai standards, Natan had lines on his face and appeared to be much older than he really was.
