'''Natan''' was a [[shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] high [[cleric|priest]] of [[Tempus]] in the city of [[Ikemmu]] in the [[Shadowfell]].  He was a close friend and advisor to [[Uwan]], Ikemmu's leader. Natan regularly received visions that he believed to be from Tempus himself.  He was murdered by a shadar-kai warrior named [[Vedoran]] in [[1479 DR]] during a plot to start an uprising in Ikemmu.	

==Relationships==
Natan was the witch [[Ilvani|Ilvani's]] twin brother.	

==Appearance==
Although not very old by shadar-kai standards, Natan had lines on his face and appeared to be much older than he really was.
