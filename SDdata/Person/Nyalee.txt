Nyalee was a worshiper of Bhaal who raised the Bhaalspawn, Yaga-Shura.
The Bhaal worshiper owned an enchanted clerics staff, a druids ring, a cloak named the Spirits Shield, and bracers of defense.
Nyalee was once a great cleric of Bhaal. When Bhaal passed in 1358 DR, she was forced to turn to the older arts in order to survive. She stole the half-giant babe, Yaga-Shura, from his crib after realizing he was a Bhaalspawn. Nyalee hoped to create a new Lord of Murder. She raised him as her own in the temple of Bhaal, located in the Forest of Mir. Nyalee referred to him as her "boy", despite not being biologically related.
The former cleric of Bhaal taught Yaga-Shura how to remove his heart, and he did so. He kept it burning in magical flame, which made him invulnerable. After raising him for several years, Nyalees heart was stolen by Yaga-Shura, who then left the temple.
Years later, the witch met with Gorions Ward in the same temple. She mentioned that she had been expecting him, the "spawn of the dead master". Nyalee tried to recruit the ward to her cause, and seek vengeance on her traitorous "boy". She was willing to extinguish his magically flaming heart if Gorions Ward was willing to bring her back his heart, as well as her own.
