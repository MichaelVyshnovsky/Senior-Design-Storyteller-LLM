Lord '''Llewellyn''' was the ruler of the coastal town of [[Llewellyn]] in [[Callidyrr]] in the {{YearlinkName|1345}}.

==Activities==
Llewellyn was constantly at odds with his neighbor, Lord [[Kythyss (person)|Kythyss]], to the south. The two bickered about who had the rights to fish the fertile waters of [[Llewellyn Harbor]]. They even brought the matter to the attention of the High King.
