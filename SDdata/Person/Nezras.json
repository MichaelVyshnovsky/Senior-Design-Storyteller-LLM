        "History": "Nezras first arrived in Myth Drannor in [[683 DR]] and joined the [[Six Tyryl Towers]] magic school in search of [[magic]] to restore his granduncle's ''[[Unique Mageries]]'' tome. In [[686 DR]], he wed the [[elf]] [[sorceress]] [[Raejisa Sicafei]] after both graduated at Six Tyryl Towers.\n\nAt the start of  the [[Weeping War]], however, Nezras joined the Army of Darkness.\n\nHe fought with his master the [[lich]] [[Laummas]] in the decisive battle of [[Hammer 25]]â€“[[Hammer 29|29]], [[712 DR]], against the [[Harpers|Harpers at Twilight]], where most of the Harpers died. However, Laummas was destroyed by the Harper leader [[Dathlue Mistwinter]].\n\nNezras fought in another decisive battle that ended in a victory for the Army of Darkness on [[Kythorn 23]] of [[714 DR]]. In this battle, however, after the death of the [[elf]] Spell-Captain [[Phyrra Iliathorr]], the young [[moon elf]] [[Akh'Faer]] mage [[Juppar]] in a rage managed to defeat Nezras, who was presumed killed.\n\nIn truth, at the last moment, using some lost [[spell]], Nezras changed his position with another human traitor mage and survived. However, he turned into a [[lich]] and went into hiding. Around [[1014 DR]], the Harpers finally discovered the truth, believing him to be hidden in a lair in the [[Vilhon Reach]].",
        "Relationship": "Nezras was the apprentice of the [[lich]] [[Laummas]]. He was the grandnephew of the [[Mulan]] archmage [[Nezram|Nezram the World-Walker]].",
        "Possessions": "''[[Nezras's mysterious chainmail]]'' was an oddly shapeless set of armor that belonged to Nezras before and during the events of the [[Weeping War]].",
        "Rumors": "A rumor said that after the [[Time of Troubles]] Nezras was restored to life and youth."
