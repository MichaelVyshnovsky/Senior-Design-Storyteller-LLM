In 686 DR, he wed the elf sorceress Raejisa Sicafei after both graduated at Six Tyryl Towers.\nAt the start of  the Weeping War, however, Nezras joined the Army of Darkness.\nHe fought with his master the lich Laummas in the decisive battle of Hammer 25â€“29, 712 DR, against the Harpers at Twilight, where most of the Harpers died. However, Laummas was destroyed by the Harper leader Dathlue Mistwinter.\nNezras fought in another decisive battle that ended in a victory for the Army of Darkness on Kythorn 23 of 714 DR.

However, he turned into a lich and went into hiding. Around 1014 DR, the Harpers finally discovered the truth, believing him to be hidden in a lair in the Vilhon Reach.\nNezras was the apprentice of the lich Laummas.
