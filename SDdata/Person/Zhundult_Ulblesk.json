He was one of the more notable mages of the city at the time.\n\nHe was a dangerous and quite possibly insane mage who aggressively defended his privacy. He was, however, a well-known researcher on [[planes|planar]] powers and [[planar traits|conditions]] and how to use them for destructive [[spell]]s. As such, he wielded an array of strange and lethal blasting spells.",
