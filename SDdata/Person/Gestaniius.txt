Gestaniius was a blue dragon and one of Tiamats chosen.
She was invested with a third of Tiamats divine power during the Time of Troubles but was devoured, along with Skuthosiin by the bearer of another third, Tchazzar.
During the last Dracorage, she was resurrected by Tiamat and sent to the Sword Mountains to create an army for Tchazzar, who was now her ally.
In 1479 DR, Gestaniius was attacking High Imaskar and at the same time was involved in the dragon game of Xorvintaal, allied with the mercury dragon Praxasalandos. Her attack was repelled by the combined forces of the Platinum Cadre and the wizards of High Imaskar, and she was killed by the combined efforts of the paladin Medrash,
