The Dark-Eyed One was an adventurer and mage in the ruin of Spellgard.
The Dark-Eyed One was an evil adventurer member of the Free Company of the Crescent. In 1479 DR, he went with his fellows to Spellgard hoping to find Lady Saharels treasures.
Nobody apart from Devlin knew the motives of the Dark-Eyed One or even his name. He followed Devlins orders without question. He did not speak much with others but often he murmured to himself.
