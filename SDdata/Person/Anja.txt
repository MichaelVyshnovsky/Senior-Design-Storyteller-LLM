'''Anja''' was a woman from the [[Wandering Village]] that traveled [[Icewind Dale]] between the [[Ten Towns]] and [[Kuldahar]] on the [[Spine of the World]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, beautiful Anja was in love with hapless young hunter [[Jari]]. But the hunter was not the only man who clamor for Anja's hand, and her father decided that the suitors needed to compete for affection. Jari was a bad hunter and contemplated to run with Anja away from the Wandering Village.
