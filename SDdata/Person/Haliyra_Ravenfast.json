        "mainbody": "Haliyra Ravenfast was an assassin member of the Hand of Yartar during the Elemental Evil crisis.\nIn 1491 DR, a patrol of the Twelve near Triboar had defeated some cultists of the Cult of the Eternal Flame and recovered a devastation orb. They went back to Yartar with the orb but, just after they put it in the citys vaults, Nareen Dhest of the Hands of Yartar stole it. After examining it, the Hands of Yartar decided to sell it in an auction at the Wink and Kiss tavern. However, secretly, Haliyra sold it to the Kraken Society.\nShe stayed in the tavern while waiting for the right time to kill Naaren and seize the orb, but the intervention of some adventurers saved Naaren and Haliyra was killed."
