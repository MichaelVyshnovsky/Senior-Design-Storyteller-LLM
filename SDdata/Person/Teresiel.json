        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], Teresiel was chosen among many others to be part of a diplomatic delegation to [[Mirabar]]. However, at [[Beliard]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]], they were ambushed by the [[Cult of the Black Earth]]. Teresiel was captured and transported beyond the [[River Dessarin]]. There, in the [[Sumber Hills]], they were attacked by the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]], but Teresiel remained in Black Earth's custody.\n\nSome time after being transported to the Fane, however, she was ceded to the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]], who put her in a jail in their section of the Fane until some adventurers infiltrated the temple and freed her."
