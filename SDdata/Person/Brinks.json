Who do you think you are, [[Ninefingers]]? Try that shit with her - I dare you.|An excerpt from a letter to Brinks}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Brinks was active in the criminal underbelly of Baldur's Gate. The criminal worked with the gang called the [[Dead Eyes]] â€“ enemies of [[Astele Keene]]'s [[Guild]]. Brinks also gambled and did not joke when the time came to collect the winnings. The unlucky [[Bruno Indomicus]] found himself indentured to [[Captain Grisly]] and Bosun [[Gannet]] of the [[Blushing Mermaid]] as well as to Brinks, loosing [[coin]] in [[Baldur's Bones]]. Brinks demanded Bosun Gannet chop Bruno's finger off as a warning, but the innkeeper turned the request down, offering instead to buy the dwarf's debt out."
