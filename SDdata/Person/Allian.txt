Allian was a young halfling from Lowhill within the Moonshae Isles.
The female halfling had a high squeaky voice.
Shy as a maid, Allian blushed at sight of the Calishite Daryth.
In 1345 DR, during the Festival of the Spring Equinox on Gwynneth, Pawldo escorted Allian to Lowhill for the spring dance.
