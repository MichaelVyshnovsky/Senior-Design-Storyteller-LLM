Ornthalas Alastrarra was an elven inhabitant of Cormanthor from at least the 3 to the 7 century DR.
Ornthalas had a propensity for nonchalant witticism that got on the nerves of his elders.
Iymbryl remembered him as young, handsome, and haughty-looking. In person, he was proud and youthful.
In , Iymbryl Alastrarra sent Elminster Aumar to Cormanthor, bearing his own kiira, to deliver it upon his brother Ornthalas. At his home, Ornthalas was summoned to find a man in the likeness of Iymbryl holding his sister, Filaurel Alastrarra, as a shield, before a gathering of his immediate family. After the man released Filaurel, he delivered the kiira unto Ornthalas it bonded quickly, but painfully.
Once he bore the kiira, Ornthalas was supportive of Elminster being taken before the Coronal so that no stain came upon the honor of their family.
Riluaneth often teased if not outright tormented him. He was the heir after the death of his brother, Iymbryl. He was the third son of Namryiitha Alastrarra.
