Faldast was a warrior in the Frostfire Banner adventuring party in the midâ€“8 century DR.
His voice wasnt as deep as that of his comrade Paeregur.
Faldast was a member of the Frostfire Banner when they took on High Duke Horostoss assignment to search for the reason why all animals larger than ones hand, as well as most people, were vanishing on the road between Starmantle and Ripplestones.
They were ambushed on their first night out of Starmantle by a chiming mist, the Slayer. Paeregur, by the time he was able to check up on them, found only two survivors, none of which were Faldast.
