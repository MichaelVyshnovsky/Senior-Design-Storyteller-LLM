Ward Mossfeld was a human of the village of West Harbor on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 century DR.
He was a brother of Wyl and Webb Mossfeld.
Ward, like his brothers, was a member of the West Harbor militia.
Ward was the bully of West Harbor, who would tease the Kalach-Cha, Bevil Starling and Amie Fern. They were the champions of the Harvest Fair for several years.
During the Harvest Fair in the , Ward and his brothers competed in the Harvest Brawl. The Kalach-Cha, Amie, and Bevil, after defeating the Lannon siblings, wouldve faced Ward, Wyl, and Webb. If the Kalach-Cha, Amie, and Bevil were defeated, they couldve asked Merring for a rematch or acknowledged that the Mossfelds had won.
In the subsequent attack on West Harbor by bladelings and duergar, the Mossfields aided in the defense, but Ward was injured. The Kalach-Cha, Bevil, and Amie may have encountered Ward, who would ask for help, and either healed him (through magic or getting Merrings herbs) to get him back into the fight or simply slew him due to "his wounds being too thick to be healed".
When the Kalach-Cha and companions later returned to the village to reassemble the Sword of Gith, they encountered Ward and his brothers. However, it was an ambush, as they had been slain and transformed into shadows.
