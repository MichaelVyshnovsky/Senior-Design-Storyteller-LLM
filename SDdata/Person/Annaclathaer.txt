'''Annaclathaer''' was a [[marl]] that lived in an underground cavern on some mountain range on the isle of [[Alaron]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. A cavern that was located close to the surface and had its exterior entrance under a cold, swift moving river.{{Cite dragon/250/Wyrms of the North: Nymmurh|83}}

==Relationships==
Annaclathaer was a firm friend with the [[bronze dragon]] [[Nymmurh]], whose cavern connected with his lair. Their friendship began as simply a long-standing agreement between the pair, in which the marl would guard the smaller, souvenir crammed cavern passages of the dragon's lair in return for food. If ever the marl required Nymmurh's assistance, Annaclathaer needed only to break an [[enchanted]] glass "signal chime" to alert the dragon and he would speed to their aid.
