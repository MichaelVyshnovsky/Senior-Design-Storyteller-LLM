Annaclathaer was a marl that lived in an underground cavern on some mountain range on the isle of Alaron in the 14 century DR. A cavern that was located close to the surface and had its exterior entrance under a cold, swift moving river.
Annaclathaer was a firm friend with the bronze dragon Nymmurh, whose cavern connected with his lair. Their friendship began as simply a long-standing agreement between the pair, in which the marl would guard the smaller, souvenir crammed cavern passages of the dragons lair in return for food. If ever the marl required Nymmurhs assistance, Annaclathaer needed only to break an enchanted glass "signal chime" to alert the dragon and he would speed to their aid.
