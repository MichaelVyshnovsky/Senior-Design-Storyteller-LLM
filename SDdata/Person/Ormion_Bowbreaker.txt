Ormion Bowbreaker was a male Chondathan human psion (seer) and a soldier based at Castle Crag in Cormyr in the 1370s DR.
A young man, Ormion was one of the psionicists hired by Commander Bren Tallsword to instantly transmit secure messages via telepathy to Arabel in the event the castle was attacked. However, Ormions powers went a step further—he successfully foresaw a vicious raid by gnolls. The War Wizards came to interrogate Ormion and the others and confirmed their loyalty. This proved the effectiveness of psionics in the army, triggering a recruitment drive for more psionically gifted soldiers by 1374 DR.
