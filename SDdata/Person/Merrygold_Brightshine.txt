Merrygold Brightshine was a halfling priest of Lathander and the caretaker of the Shrine of Lathander in Leilon in the late 15 century DR.
Merrygold was outgoing, amiable, and quick to take care of those in need. He could be a bit reckless when he thought that there was good to be done.
As the caretaker of Leilons Shrine of Lathander, Merrygold led religious services each dawn and presided over a small number of fellow faithful. Under his stewardship, the Shrine took on the role of caring for the laborers and soldiers from Neverwinter who were participating in the reconstruction of the town. He personally provided healing and restoration services in exchange for donations to Lathander.
Merrygold was much beloved by the people of Leilon.
When efforts to rebuild Leilon began, the Church of Lathander eagerly donated to the project in order to open the first temple in the reclaimed town. which made him one of the original founders of the new town at Leilon. With the adoration of the people cementing his importance in the community, he soon became a member of the town council.
When Leilon came under attack from the Cult of Talos and the townsfolk and laborers were driven out, Merrygold called for his fellow councilors to act fast to find a pair of missing children without regard for the dangers, putting him at odds with the head of the council, Grizzelda Copperwraught.
