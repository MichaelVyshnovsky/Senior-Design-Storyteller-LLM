As the latter sections appear to be identical between adventures, this wiki assumes that these references to Merrygold as female were the product of a mistake that was propagated via copy-pasting of the entry about the Shrine's services.

'''Merrygold Brightshine''' was a [[halfling]] [[priest]] of [[Lathander]] and the caretaker of the [[Lathander Shrine (Leilon)|Shrine of Lathander]] in [[Leilon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Merrygold was outgoing, amiable, and quick to take care of those in need. He could be a bit reckless when he thought that there was good to be done.

==Activities==
As the caretaker of Leilon's Shrine of Lathander, Merrygold led religious services each dawn and presided over a small number of fellow faithful. Under his stewardship, the Shrine took on the role of caring for the laborers and soldiers from [[Neverwinter]] who were participating in the reconstruction of the town. He personally provided [[cure wounds|healing]] and [[Lesser restoration|restoration]] services in exchange for donations to Lathander.

==Relationships==
Merrygold was much beloved by the people of Leilon.

==History==
When efforts to rebuild Leilon began, the [[Church of Lathander]] eagerly donated to the project in order to open the first temple in the reclaimed town. which made him one of the original founders of the new town at Leilon. With the adoration of the people cementing his importance in the community, he soon became a member of the town council.

When Leilon came under attack from the [[Cult of Talos]] and the townsfolk and laborers were driven out, Merrygold called for his fellow councilors to act fast to find a pair of missing children without regard for the dangers, putting him at odds with the head of the council, [[Grizzelda Copperwraught]].
