'''Saeth Cromley''' ({{Pronounce|SAYTH|_|KROM|lee|refs=}}) was a retired [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] [[Generic City Guard sergeant (Waterdeep)|sergeant]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Personality==
Saeth, like his friend [[Barnibus Blastwind]] of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]], wanted solid evidence and testimonies before ordering arrests. He preferred to not have unauthorized people inside the crime scene. Saeth was a likable fellow with a sharp, sarcastic wit. He was very capable of collecting information from common folk. Once he was very strict about the City Watch's dress code but after his retirement he wore more practical dress.

==Relationships==
Saeth had a working partnership with Barnibus.

==History==
Saeth was once an officer in the City Watch until he decided to retire. Sometimes, however, he helped Barnibus in difficult cases.

In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} Saeth, together with Barnibus, was called in to investigate the blast that killed ten people in [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]], including the [[gnome]] [[Dalakhar]]. He acted as bodyguard and assistant to Barnibus.

Later, Saeth accompanied Barnibus when he was called in to investigate the [[Gralhund Villa Bloodbath]].
