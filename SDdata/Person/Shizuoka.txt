Shizuoka was a samurai retainer of the Michimori clan in Maeshi Province in Kozakura in 1360 DR.
Shizuoka was ordered, together with his younger brother Shizadai, to lead a company of bushi to assist an adventuring party hired by Michimori Uemon to retrieve the Seven Swords. He may have helped them battle Korimori clan troops led by Sakigahara and Himeji.
