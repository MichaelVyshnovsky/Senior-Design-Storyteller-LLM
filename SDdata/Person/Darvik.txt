Darvik was a gnome inhabitant of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the mid–14 century DR.
He was small with a gravelly voice, and had skin that was brown, lined and leathery in a manner distinctive of gnomes.
He was very earnest and polite, always calling people "sir"—or "sor" in his thick accent—and fearful of tracking mud into their homes. However, he was also very long-winded and rambling. Being practical, he always had a candle and flint and steel, "because you never know, no, you dont".
There was a Missus Darvik.
Once a month, Darvik went into the Vast Swamp to pick peat for burning in the stove. He knew the ways of the dangerous swamp fairly well.
On Eleint 18 of the , while picking peat in the Vast Swamp, Darvik discovered an open trapdoor at his favorite spot, which hed not noticed before because it had been concealed with moss. Venturing inside, he discovered the tomb of Fastred, a notorious bandit chieftain of centuries past, but more significantly a still-burning torch and a freshly and bloodily slain body. He immediately fled, fearing the perpetrator might still be there and attack him next.
Out of the swamp and on the road, Darvik encountered a Purple Dragons patrol led by Captain Flim. Darvik showed them the body, which Flim recognized to be that of the kings envoy, Grodoveth. Flim alerted Mayor Tobald, and they informed Benelaius, Jasper, and Lindavar, who were investigating a previous murder, with Darvik giving his account.
Subsequently, Darvik guided Flim, Jasper, and Lindavar through the Vast Swamp and back to the site, showing them where to walk and how to avoid a thornslinger tree. He waited outside while they examined the scene briefly, they considered Darvik as a culprit, but dismissed it based on footprint evidence and the difficulty of a small gnome to behead such a large human. Darvik led them out and headed back to his holding.
