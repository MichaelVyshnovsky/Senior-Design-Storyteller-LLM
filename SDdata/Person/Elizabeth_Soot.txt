Elizabeth M. Soot was an author who dedicated their life to understanding evils of the world, and writing about how they could be overcome.
In their career, Elizabeth wrote a treatise on how to best outwit and overcome the deceitful nature of hags. Unfortunately, those recommendations were not enough, as Elizabeth was actually compelled into service with a green hag, and taken captive as her servant for over two years. 
Drawing from that experience, Elizabeth wrote A Brush with Evil, which offered new advice on how to escape the machinations of evil hags run away and pray the hag does not chase you down.
