'''Rool''' was a sailor on the [[Trackless Sea]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==Activities==
Rool was the first mate of the ''[[Morkoth (ship)|Morkoth]]'' ship and a [[Kraken Society]] assassin.

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Rool, posing as a [[Lords' Alliance]] agent, led the squad that captured the [[storm giant]] king [[Hekaton]] and took him to the ship.

==Relationship==
Rool hated his captain, [[Tholtz Daggerdark]], and used any occasion to kill him, even if meant defeat for himself.
