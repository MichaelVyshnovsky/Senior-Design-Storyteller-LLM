'''Rimardo''' was an [[adventurer]] from [[Turmish]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Rimardo was a member of the [[Brightstar Sash]] adventuring company alongside [[Vonda]], [[Thloram Flambaertyn]], [[Bertro]], and [[Caladnei]].

==History==
Rimardo was with the Brightstar Sash when they acquired about 6,000 [[gp]] after a quest.

At a later date, he and Vonda tried to rob a nobleman in [[Waterdeep]], but he was captured, interrogated, and tortured to death. During this, he revealed the names of the rest of the Brightstar Sash; the nobleman's forces came after them, forcing the Sash to flee Waterdeep.
