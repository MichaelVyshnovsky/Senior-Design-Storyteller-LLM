        "mainbody": "Dulgan Proudfist was a cunning member of the Proudfist tribe of half-orcs who lived on the Sword Coast North during the late 15 century DR.\nUnlike his tribes chieftain who valued strength, Dulgan was a more subtle individual. He respected those who demonstrated shrewdness and cunning above others.\nIn the , Dulgan and the Proudfists served Vansi Bloodscar in the Many-Arrows occupation of the River District of Neverwinter and fought against the Neverwinter Guard. When a half-elf adventurer sought to prove their worth to the Proudfists in an effort to persuade them to change sides, Dulgan challenged them to find his hidden trinkets.\nAs a way to amuse himself, Dulgan liked to hide small caches of trinkets throughout the River District, unbeknownst to the orcs."
