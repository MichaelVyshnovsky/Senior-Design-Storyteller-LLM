'''Liadan''' was a [[human]] Feloguard that stood watch over the showroom of [[Felogyr's Fireworks]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Liadan was a pale-skinned human woman with mousy-blonde hair. She was outfitted with a simple [[chainmail]] and a [[spear]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] planted its roots in Baldur's Gate and ravaged the [[Western Heartlands]], Felogyr's Fireworks shop fell under the cult's sway. Its proprietor, [[Avery Sonshal]], was made into a [[True Soul]] and used the shop as a front for the cult's terrorist activities. During that time, Liadan was employed as a Feloguard, standing guard of the shop's first floor and Avery himself, as he dealt with regular customers, selling them [[fireworks]]. Liadan knowingly or unknowingly also guarded the shop's areas that were off-limits to all but the [[Banite]] members of the Cult of the Absolute.
