'''Ulfberht''' was a virtuoso [[dwarf|dwarvish]] blacksmith for hire from the city of [[Neverwinter]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Ulfberht had already reached the fame and respect of a master bladesmith. Ulfberht's swords were truly remarkable, making many people raise an eyebrow at the fact that such a master liked to work for hire in simple workshops, lending his skills to [[adventurer]]s of Neverwinter.
