Lord '''Pharnth Aelorothi''' was a [[fey'ri]] [[diviner]] of [[House Aelorothi]] of [[Siluvanede]] and a member of the [[daemonfey]] in [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
He had a wiry build and a hawk-like nose. His bald head was adorned with many mystical tattoos.

==Powers==
As a fey'ri, Pharnth had the unique powers to cast ''[[clairaudience]]'' and ''[[ESP]]'' once a day each, and was resistant to fire and electricity.

==Relationships==
Pharnth's consort was [[Saesaan Aelorothi]].

==Activities==
Pharnth was the lord and patriarch of the Aelorothi fey'ri among the daemonfey. His duties were to spy on the enemies of [[House Dlardrageth]], which he did remotely with his [[divination]] powers, and he reported to [[Ryvvik Dlardrageth]] and his intelligence-gathering networks. He was a voice of restraint in the daemonfey council, and thus was increasingly sidelined.

==Personality==
Pharnth was very cautious.
