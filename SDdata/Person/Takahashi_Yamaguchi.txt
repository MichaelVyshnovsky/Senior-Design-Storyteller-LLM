Takahashi Yamaguchi was the leader of the ninja Yamaguchi clan in the town of Aru in Wa.
Takahashi was a man of honor, never brooking an agreement. If anyone betrayed him Takahashi would do anything to have revenge.
Takahashi trained in ninja arts inside the Warazama clan until that clan was destroyed by internal dissents. So Takahashi formed a own ninja clan, the Yamaguchi clan.
One of first missions of Yamaguchi ninja was in 1358 DR spreading chaos in the town of Aru.
