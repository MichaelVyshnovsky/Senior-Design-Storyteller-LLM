'''Rault''', who was also called '''the Wise''', was a [[Northlander]] and the Jarl of [[Norland]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|11}}

==Activities==
Rault ruled from [[Stormbanner Hold]] in the city of [[Rogarsheim]]. With the decline in power of House [[Kendrick]], and the restlessness of his own Northlanders, Rault declared the Northlanders independence from High King [[Derid Kendrick|Derid]]. The [[Storm Maiden]] rose to power in Norland following those events, creating pressure for Rault to step down as Jarl given her quickly growing following. Though he had not yet stepped down as of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Rault saw the favor of destiny in the Storm Maiden and could easily see her ruling not only Norland, but the entirety of the Moonshae Isles as well at some point.

By the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, Rault still ruled, but wars with the Storm Maiden had left him with no male heirs after both his son and grandson were slain.

==Relationships==
Rault's son and grandson were [[Olfgaut]] and [[Olfsvenn]] respectively. He also had a brave and wise granddaughter.
