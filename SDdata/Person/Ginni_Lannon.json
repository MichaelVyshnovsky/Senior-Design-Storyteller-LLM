        "mainbody": "'''Ginni Lannon''' was a [[human]] inhabitant of the village of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Hush, Tarmas - save your strength. Well be back at West Harbor in no time.''|Ginni Lannon}}",
        "Description": "Ginni had blonde hair affixed in a tight ponytail. She had a face that showed determination and her bright eyes were clear and focused.",
        "Relationships": "Ginni Lannon was [[Pitney Lannon]]'s wife and a fellow soldier. They had four children â€“ [[Pitney Junior Lannon|Pitney Junior]], [[Kiri Lannon|Kiri]], [[Kyl Lannon|Kyl]], and [[Kaye Lannon]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, soon after, the [[Mere of Dead Men]] was briefly consumed by a short but deadly conflict known as the [[Second War of the Shadow]]. As the village was being rebuild and recovered, the town's [[mage]], [[Tarmas]], disappeared. Ginni and Pitney Lannon volunteered to follow the wizard's tracks and attempt the rescue. The Lannons discovered Tarmas captured by [[lizardfolk]] within the [[Dragon Caves]] south of West Harbor. They quickly returned the man back to the village. However, unbeknownst to them, Tarmas they retrieved was a magically disguised [[black dragon]]. Then the deception was revealed, Pitney joined the soldiers in defending the village against [[Voaraghamanthar]] and [[Waervaerendor]], who wanted to take over the village and its Harvest Mead brewery. It was up to adventurers to aid the soldiers or the dragons."
