'''Guldor Zauviir''' was the head of the [[College of Mages]], the College that gathered all non-specialized wizards, and one of the members of the [[Conclave of Sshamath]] in the city of [[Sshamath]] in the year [[1372 DR]].

==Relations==
Guldor had strong ties with the local church of [[Lolth]], headed by a female of [[House Zauvirr]].

==History==
In [[1379 DR]], in opposition to the proposal to elevate [[Q'arlynd Melarn]], Master of the Ancient Arcana, as a new member of the Conclave, Guldor proposed [[T'lar Mizz'rynturl]], Master of [[Bae'qeshel]] Magic, instead. However, after [[Q'arlynd Melarn]]'s revelation that only [[Lolth]]'s worshipers could practice Bae'qeshel, his proposal was rejected.

Later, he discussed with T'lar and his aunt Streea'Valsharess [[Ilharess Laele Zauviir|Zauviir]], the city's high priestess of Lolth, about why their plot had failed. Under orders of [[the Lady Penitent]], T'lar killed Guldor.
