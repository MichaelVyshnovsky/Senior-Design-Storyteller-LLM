When the quartermaster, [[Igan Sokol]], announced that he had discovered a treasure thanks to a strange [[ghost]], Grim and his fellows were filled with greed. Thus, when they came to the right room of the dungeon, Grim killed Igan. This however angered both the ghost [[Harae]] and the [[undead]] guardian of the dungeon. Thus Grim and his fellows were trapped and besieged inside the room.{{Cite adventurers league/Secrets of Sokol Keep|5}}\n\nIn the end, they may have been rescued by some adventurers hired to solve the mystery of the keep, but Grim and his fellows would very probably still need to face justice.{{Cite adventurers league/Secrets of Sokol Keep|21}}"
