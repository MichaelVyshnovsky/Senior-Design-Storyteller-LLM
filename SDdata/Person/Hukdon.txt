Hukdon was a member of the Shadow Thieves in Athkatla around 1370 DR.
Hukdon was very ill-mannered but he thought of himself as funny and likeable. Many underestimated him for his puny appearance.
Somehow Hukdon acquired a pair of gauntlets of ogre power.
Hukdon worked for the enforcer and thugs chapter of the guild in Athkatla. His boss usually used him only when a "client" needed punishment, not for mere intimidation work.
