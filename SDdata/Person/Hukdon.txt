'''Hukdon''' was a member of the [[Shadow Thieves]] in [[Athkatla]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
Hukdon was very ill-mannered but he thought of himself as funny and likeable. Many underestimated him for his puny appearance.

==Possession==
Somehow Hukdon acquired a pair of ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]''.

==Activities==
Hukdon worked for the enforcer and thugs chapter of the guild in Athkatla. His boss usually used him only when a "client" needed punishment, not for mere intimidation work.
