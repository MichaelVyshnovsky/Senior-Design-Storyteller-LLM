Duneth Wharreil was a drow and the former archmage of Maerimydra until his coup during Lolths Silence and his subsequent death at the hands of Irae Tsarran. As of 1372 DR he persisted as a silveraith under Irae Tsarrans control.
After his transformation into a silveraith, Duneth barely resembled his previous self. He appeared as a vaguely skeletal being wrapped in wisps of glowing blue energy that trailed around him much like a wizards robe.
Since his transformation into a silveraith, Duneth eschewed most material possessions. However it was known that in life he possessed a staff of frost, which was taken by Irae Tsarran.
Duneth Wharreil was the archmage of Maerimydra up until the Silence of Lolth struck the Maerimydrian priesthood. Then Duneth hatched a plan to remove the Lolthites and rise to power himself by forging an alliance with the half-fiend/half fire giant, Kurgoth Hellspawn, to invade the city.
Whilst his plan came to fruition and the city fell to their combined forces, he was struck by the aspiring church of Kiaransalee. The priestess Irae Tsarran destroyed the archmage and threw down his tower, turning the wizard himself into an undead creature known as a silveraith in 1372 DR. Duneth was rendered a mere tool of Irae, pitted against any threats she perceived.
