She also enforced the law of the land, dedicating herself to the protection of the worshipers of [[Tymora]] along with routing foreign agents from the city. These agents hailed from such groups as the [[Kraken Society]], the [[Zhentarim]], the [[Cult of the Dragon]], and those from [[Thay]].",
        "Personality": "With a stern personality and a quick mind, Belleethe was an astute judge of character. She even impressed the local [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]] tribes so much that they began to take a second look at civilization.",
        "History": "Belleethe was trained and schooled in [[Neverwinter]], even learning a little from [[Piergeiron the Paladinson|Piergeiron]] of [[Waterdeep]].\n\nShe was put forth as a candidate for the position of Waterbaron by the [[Lords' Alliance]], after the death of the [[Alahar Khaumfros|previous Waterbaron]]."
