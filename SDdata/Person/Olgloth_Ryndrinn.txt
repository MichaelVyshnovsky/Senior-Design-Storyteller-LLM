Olgloth Ryndrinn was a kobold inhabiting the Ice Mountains in northwest Faer√ªn in the 14 century DR.
Olgloth was the leader of the Drinn, a large tribe of kobolds numbering nearly 4,000 strong. He organized attacks on Citadel Adbar, but usually just dealt with any miners who wandered into his territory.
