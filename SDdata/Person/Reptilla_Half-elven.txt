Reptilla Half-elven was a half-elf wizard who dwelt in the Dragonspine Mountains in the early 1360s DR.
She was a highly dexterous mage, and skilled in making poisons.
Reptilla and her small dragon familiar, Thsst, dwelt in a cave on the sunnier side of the Dragonspine Mountains. From here, they ambushed animals and lone travelers and used them for Reptillas experiments with poisons.
Reptilla owned a staff of the serpent, bracers of defense, and a cloak of displacement, as well as a vial of curdled death.
She lost her staff of the serpent in the lair of a bronze dragon.
