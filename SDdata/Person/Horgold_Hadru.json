        "mainbody": "'''Horgold Hadru''' was a potter that lived in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Possessions": "Hadru owned a shop near the southern part of [[Wyrm's Crossing]].",
        "History": "In [[1482 DR]], skilled [[thieves]] of [[the Guild]] vandalized and removed the hands of five statues. A thorough investigation was made by the [[Flaming Fist]], but nothing turned up. A day later, six bored noble youths committed the same crime with a [[dagger]] and [[hammer]], but to the well-known [[Beloved Ranger]] statue of [[Minsc]] and [[Boo]]. During their act, a noble of the [[Ravenshade]] family dropped a brooch and a noble of the [[Oberon (family)|Oberon]] family dropped a dagger. The entire city was outraged, and the young nobles panicked; they headed to Horgold Hadru, who owed the [[Durinbold]] family a favor.\n\nHadru the potter agreed to take in the young nobles, and allowed them to hide in a hanging cellar under his shop. He too panicked and came to the conclusion that the nobles were behind the crime."
