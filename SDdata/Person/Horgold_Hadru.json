A thorough investigation was made by the Flaming Fist, but nothing turned up. A day later, six bored noble youths committed the same crime with a dagger and hammer, but to the well-known Beloved Ranger statue of Minsc and Boo. During their act, a noble of the Ravenshade family dropped a brooch and a noble of the Oberon family dropped a dagger. The entire city was outraged, and the young nobles panicked they headed to Horgold Hadru, who owed the Durinbold family a favor.\nHadru the potter agreed to take in the young nobles, and allowed them to hide in a hanging cellar under his shop. He too panicked and came to the conclusion that the nobles were behind the crime."
