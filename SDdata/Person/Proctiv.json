After this, he invented ''[[stone shape]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1749|NY}}, ''[[move earth]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1764|NY}}, ''[[glassteel (spell)|glassteel]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1769|NY}}, ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1774|NY}}, ''[[transmute water to dust]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1796|NY}}, and ''[[dig]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1799|NY}}. In {{YearlinkConvert|1808|NY}}, Proctiv had an enormous breakthrough and developed the epic ''Proctiv's breach crystal sphere'' (and its reverse version)."
