Vuhm Yestral was a commander of the Red Plumes of Hillsfar in the late 15 century DR.
Vuhm, despite being loud and opinionated, was kind and very devoted to the citizens of Hillsfar. He had no problems with nonhumans going to the city to trade.
Circa 1486 DR, after many drow raids near the city, he led a Red Plume contingent to the Waydown, a recently formed sinkhole that the drow emerged from, in order to secure the location and stop the raids. He noted that the drow attacked in sunlight and were desperate individuals.
Later, for lacking zeal in enforcing the Great Law of Humanity, Vuhm was relocated to YÃ»lash.
First Lord Torin Nomerthal and his court later made a visit to Yulash, with the objective to deal with Damaras representatives Vhum apprised the Lord of the situation in the city.
After the successful revolution against Torin, Vuhm Yestral became the new First Lord. He led a Red Plumes contingent in Sporedome to join the assault on Maerimydra.
Vuhm was a member of the Lords Alliance.
