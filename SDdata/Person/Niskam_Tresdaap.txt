'''Niskam Tresdaap''' was a male [[human]] and a [[Battleguard]] of [[Tempus]] with the title of Lance of the Lord. The aging seneschal, Trusted Sword [[Jak Errins]] was soon to retire and Niskam was maneuvering to take over the leadership of the [[Towers of the Vengeful Hand]] in [[Eshpurta]], [[Amn]], His chief rival was Battlelady [[Peris Whallnsor]].

Niskam was under the sway of [[Sapphiraktar]], an [[undead]] [[Blue dragon|blue]] [[dracolich]] and a [[Runemaster]] of the [[Twisted Rune]]. Niskam believed the voice he heard was [[Tempus]] himself speaking to him, but in reality it was the crafty Runemaster.
