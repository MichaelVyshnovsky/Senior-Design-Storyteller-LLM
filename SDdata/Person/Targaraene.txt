'''Targaraene''' was a [[nightmare]] that served as the mount and fiendish servant of [[Scyllua Darkhope]].

==Description==
Targaraene looked like a large, powerful [[horse]] with a pale white coat. Flames wreathed its hooves and flared from its nostrils.

Targaraene was stronger and heartier than an average nightmare.
