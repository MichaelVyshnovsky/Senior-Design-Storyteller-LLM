'''Turvy''' was a [[deep gnome]] [[wererat]] living in the [[Underdark]] with his twin sister [[Topsy]] sometime in the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]].

==Personality==
The [[gnome]] was very close to his twin Topsy. He was constantly blabbering and muttering darkly and his sister translated for him. They feared that someone would discover that they were novice [[wererat]]s who couldn't easily control their instincts.

==History==
Topsy and Turvy lived in [[Blingdenstone]]. Sometime in the late 1480s, they were infected with [[lycanthropy]].

Not much time later, during a trip to collect some mushrooms, he and his twin were captured by [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]].
