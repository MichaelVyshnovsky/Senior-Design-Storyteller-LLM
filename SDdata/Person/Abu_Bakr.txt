|Abu Bakr, Caliph of Semphar
}}
'''Abu Bakr''' was the Caliph of [[Semphar]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Abu Bakr was often known to wear a white [[turban]].

==Activities==
Abu Bakr ruled Semphar from the capital of [[Dhaztanar]]. He resided in the magnificent royal palace of [[Dar al-Kalif]].

He was known to use his treasury to support places of learning, and colleges for wizards.

He also gave large donations to temples, but was known to persecute others, including those of [[Ilmater]], as he feared they would rally the oppressed people of [[Semphar]] against him.
