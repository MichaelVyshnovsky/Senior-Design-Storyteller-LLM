Abu Bakr was the Caliph of Semphar during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Abu Bakr was often known to wear a white turban.
Abu Bakr ruled Semphar from the capital of Dhaztanar. He resided in the magnificent royal palace of Dar al-Kalif.
He was known to use his treasury to support places of learning, and colleges for wizards.
He also gave large donations to temples, but was known to persecute others, including those of Ilmater, as he feared they would rally the oppressed people of Semphar against him.
