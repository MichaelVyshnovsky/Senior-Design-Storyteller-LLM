        "History": "In the year or two following the invention of a robust new wagon design by [[Ulbrask Hael]] in the [[368 DR|Year of the Bitter Smile, 368 DR]], Khôltar saw tremendous growth in its economy, and space inside the protective wall again became scarce as temporary structures gave way to sturdy stone houses and workshops. The [[dwarves]], led by Shieldlord [[Amberu Khôltar]], were garrisoned in the Iron City and were managing to hold the wall around the town against a plague of attacks from [[Shaaryan]] raiders, but would not or could not protect anything built outside the wall or pursue the evasive nomads. Handrorn got tired of this defense-only strategy and demanded that he be allowed to lead a company of Khôltans to destroy or drive off the raiders for good.\n\nAmberu thought it was a bit foolish, but saw that Handrorn and his disgruntled supporters had a chance to succeed, and at the very least it would get some angry humans out of the city where they couldn't rouse the rabble. The Shieldlord gave them some funds for armor, weapons, and mounts, and a charter to wage war against the Shaaryans on behalf of the city. Handrorn and his cadre tackled the challenge with an enthusiasm bordering on the berserk. They slaughtered nomads across the land east and south of the Iron City to such an extent that the raids against Khôltar stopped and the raiders were forced north where they had to settle for attacking softer targets like [[Shaarmid]] and sites beyond.\n\nHandrorn became known as the Iron Blade{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|67}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 53: Khôltar, Part 4, Our Tour Begins}}"
