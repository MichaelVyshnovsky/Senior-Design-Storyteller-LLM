        "mainbody": "Voosss was a steam mephit sorcerer who lived with the steam mephit bard Gorsshhh in a statue called the Steaming Demon. \nVoosss and Gorsshhh had stolen some treasure from travelers. They stored it in a chamber hidden inside the Steaming Demon. \nVoosss and Gorsshhh manipulated the steam vent that the Steaming Demon was built around in order to produce steam on command. Every nine hours, the statue would appear be a steam-breathing demon. They used this fearful sight to scare travelers and rob them, choosing their targets carefully."
