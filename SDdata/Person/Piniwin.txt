'''Piniwin''' was an apprentice alchemist who worked in the city of [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Piniwin learned her craft under the supervision of [[Hazel]], who was studying the effects of the [[Blacklake]] sludge that appeared in the [[Blacklake District]] of Neverwinter.

She had a sister named [[Penny]] who also worked with Hazel.

==History==
Following the [[siege of Neverwinter]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Piniwin went with Hazel to the Blacklake District to study the sludge. There, she sold a variety of [[healing potion]]s to those adventurers who were aiding in the efforts to cleanse and rebuild the city. Later, Piniwin sought out [[adventurer]]s to help Hazel fight off the sludge-covered [[zombie]]s that were being summoned by [[Therzt]], the [[Chosen]] of [[Ghaunadaur]].
