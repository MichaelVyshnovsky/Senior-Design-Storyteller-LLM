        "mainbody": "Araundras Othaun was a Chosen of Mystryl in ancient Netheril.\nIn the time of Netheril, Araundras was a Chosen of Mystryl. However, Larloch, a fellow Chosen, doubted Araundrass loyalty to the goddess, so he gave him a ring with a scrying spell inside. Some time later, Telamont Tanthul killed Araundras and took his ring as a trophy. Thus, after Thultanthar returned to Toril in 1372, Larloch was able to use the ring to spy upon the shadovars plans. In 1487 DR, Larloch told Elminster Aumar all about Araundras."
