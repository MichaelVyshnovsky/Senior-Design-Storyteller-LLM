        "History": "In the time of Netheril, Araundras was a Chosen of Mystryl. However, [[Larloch]], a fellow Chosen, doubted Araundras's loyalty to the goddess, so he gave him a ring with a [[scrying]] spell inside. Some time later, [[Telamont Tanthul]] killed Araundras and took his ring as a trophy. Thus, after [[Thultanthar]] returned to [[Toril]] in [[1372]], Larloch was able to use the ring to spy upon the [[shadovar]]'s plans. In [[1487 DR]], Larloch told [[Elminster Aumar]] all about Araundras."
