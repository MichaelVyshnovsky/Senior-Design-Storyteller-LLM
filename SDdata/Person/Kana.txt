She took over the seneschals position after the fortresss commander, the Kalach-Cha, left the Crossroad Keep.

In the , Kana returned to northwest Faerûn and eagerly honed her skills sparring with traveling adventures in the vicinity of the Crossroad Keep. She did not pursue an adventurers life and refused companionship, insisting that the Way had to be traveled in solitude.
