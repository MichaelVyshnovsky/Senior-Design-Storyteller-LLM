'''Kana''' was a former seneschal of the [[Crossroad Keep]] who left the position in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Learning to deal with a treacherous attack is '''also''' a part of my Way.''|Kana}}

==Description==
Kana was a [[human]] woman with her brown hair gathered in a tight bun. She carried herself with the perfect posture of a dancer or an experienced warrior, likely the latter.

==Possessions==
Kana wielded an [[enchanted]] ''+3'' [[katana]] and carried several vials of ''[[holy water]]'', ''[[tanglefoot bag]]s'', and ''[[Thunderstone (item)|thunderstones]]''.

==History==
Kana was a somewhat renowned warrior who served the Crossroad Keep some years before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, assigned to it by Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]]. She took over the seneschal's position after the fortress's commander, the [[Kalach-Cha]], left the Crossroad Keep. She left the position in pursuit of the [[Way of Swords]], spending some time away, learning the warrior's life path, and seeking perfection with a single weapon—her trusted katana. In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, Kana returned to [[northwest Faerûn]] and eagerly honed her skills sparring with traveling adventures in the vicinity of the Crossroad Keep. She did not pursue an adventurer's life and refused companionship, insisting that the Way had to be traveled in solitude.
