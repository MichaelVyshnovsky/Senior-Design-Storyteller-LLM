Sememmon himself gave her a task that she completed with ruthless efficiency, rising quickly through the organizations ranks.\nIn about 1355 DR, the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon, which included her sister Kera and her lover Caledan, captured Ravendas after defeating her army at Hluthvar. Once she was alone with Kera, Ravendas convinced her Harper sister to release her and then strangled her with the bonds that previously held her.https//twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1229054227776966661\nIn 1362 DR, Cutter and her Zhentish forces conquered the city of Iriaebor, gaining control of the city and its trade routes. While looting Iriaebor of its valuables, Cutter sought and eventually found the crypt of the Shadowking deep beneath the city.\nCutter was beautiful and tall with pale skin, dusky eyes and pale gold hair cut to shoulder-length.\nWhile she counted the rest of the Zhents among her allies, Cutters enemies included Caledan Caldorien, Mari Almaren, and the rest of the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon."
