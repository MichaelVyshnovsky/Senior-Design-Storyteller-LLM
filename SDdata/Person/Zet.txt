'''Zet''' was an [[efreeti]] who lived in the [[Cities of the Pantheon|Pantheist League]] in [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Relationships==
Zet was the [[genie]] servant and bodyguard of the [[sha'ir]] [[Othmar bin Jaqal]]. Though Othmar constantly berated him, Zet encouraged his master to pursue his goals because of ulterior motives. 

==Activities==
Zet actively persuaded his master to undertake goals that had a greater chance of either destroying him or granting him glory as well. He hoped to be freed from his servitude should his master perish, or share the glory of any successes. One of his schemes involved Othmar seizing the throne of [[Mahabba]] to become its Caliph.
