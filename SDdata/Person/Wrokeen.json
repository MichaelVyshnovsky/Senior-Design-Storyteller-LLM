        "mainbody": "'''Wrokeen''' was the lead hunter of the [[Golden Mane]] [[wemic]] pride that roamed the lands of the [[Shaar]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/Wemic Camp|2}} In addition to her role as leader of the hunt, Wrokeen was generally accepted as the mother of the pride.",
        "Activities": "The powerful lioness spent most of her time scouting for the Golden Mane pride, tracking herds of prey animals, finding fresh watering holes, and scouting for possible enemies.",
        "Description": "She had a lovely look, with elegant features and feline green eyes that were considered an exotic beauty by the nomadic [[Shaaran]] people. Wrokeen had flowing black hair that she kept tied up with a leather thong.\n\nEasily the fastest member of the pride, Wrokeen was a naturally gifted scout and huntress, with a legendary skill with the bow. She had a keen sense of how to read signs of nature, which granted her kin insight on weather movements and possible nearby threats, especially those from combatants that had recently fought.",
        "Relationship": "Wrokeen was the love and favored mate of the pride's alpha and leader, [[Shaq'ar]]. In their years together, Wrokeen has borne seven cubs. As of [[1373 DR]], four of the cubs still lived with the pride, one of which was still so young that she personally cared for it. When Wrokeen was out on a hunt, her daughters would look over the wemic babe.",
        "Possessions": "As a skilled huntress, Wrokeen kept a number of [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[weapon]]s including a ''+2 [[composite longbow]]'', the accuracy of which was aided by her ''[[lesser bracers of archery]]''.{{Cite web enhancement/Wemic Camp|4}} She had a [[magic]]al ''[[Heward's handy haversack|haversack]]'' that allowed her to bring entire kills back to her pride's camp in a single trip.{{Cite web enhancement/Wemic Camp|5}}"
