Bengel was a corrupt Netherese fighter who served as an Underchief at Constabulary Branch Two in Eileanar before its destruction in .
Bengel served Chief Constable Michallon and helped manage the other constables, alongside Underchiefs Bias, Ezeddeen, and Hacklander. Motivated by fear of Michallon and greed for coin, they used the constables of the branch to covertly support certain criminal elements in the enclave, earning great amounts of money while appearing to be upstanding officers. They cultivated a culture of awe among the constables, who believed that Bengel and the others were all upstanding figures.
