        "mainbody": "'''Geveral Telkku''' was a caravan captain from [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "An employee of the [[Red Boar Trading Coster]], Geveral was the captain preferred by its owner, [[Deldron Rein]].",
        "History": "Reportedly, on or near [[Shieldmeet]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Geveral and a band of [[adventurer]]s explored the ruins of [[Phantoms' Cloister]] in [[Southwood]], either immediately before or immediately after the place \"went phantom\" and manifested its structure in full. Only Geveral came out again, and he was found wandering the woods north of the ruins. His mind was broken and he rambled incoherently of a \"whispering light\", a \"[[dragon]] in the mind\", \"the Fallen One\", and a \"monastery of the Fallen One.\"\n\nHe died by his own hand [[1371 DR|three years later]]."
