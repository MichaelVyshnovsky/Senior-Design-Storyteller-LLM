'''Gord Roundshield'''  was a [[dwarf]] adventurer from [[Citadel Felbarr]] who joined a group of fellow dwarves aiding [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was a companion of [[Skeld Steelhelm]] of [[Mithral Hall]],Skeld refers to a "handful of heroes" and lists these four dwarfholds, but only names Gord. As Skeld, Gord, Taggot, and Tori all give Lore entries about their respective dwarfholds and have dwarf-specific quests, it may be assumed that all four were part of the same group.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the four dwarf companions came to Neverwinter to offer their aid to the beleaguered city. Learning of the [[Many-Arrows]] [[orc]]s occupation of the [[Tower District]], Gord charged in to wage a one-dwarf war upon them. Skeld asked a fellow dwarf adventurer to check up on Gord and ask him to return. However, Gord had been injured by an Eye of Gruumsh shaman known only as [[Black Eye (person)|the Black Eye]], and wouldn't leave until he had vengeance. Gord ask the fellow dwarf adventurer to burn a shrine to [[Gruumsh]] and slay the Black Eye. After that, Gord agreed to return to Skeld soon.
