'''Uthalion''' was a [[human]] [[fighter]] and former [[mercenary]] who lived in the [[Spur Forest]] with his [[killoren]] friend [[Vaasurri]]. Uth was something of a naturalist and enjoyed sketching plants in a notebook. He was best known for destroying [[The Choir]] cult.	

==History==
Uthalion was a mercenary who had retired to [[Airspur]] in [[Akanûl]] with his wife and child. He left his family in [[1473 DR]] to fight for the [[Keepers of the Cerulean Sign]] in their campaign against the [[Abolethic Sovereignty|Aboleth Sovereignty]]. Uth's company was wiped out by the [[aboleth]]s at the village of [[Caidris]].

After the battle, Uth moved to the [[Spur Forest]], where he lived in a grove with a killoren named Vaasurri. In [[1479 DR]], an old [[half-elf]] friend from his military days named [[Brindani]] sought Uthalion's aid as a guide through the [[Mere-That-Was]] region of Akanûl on a mission to rescue a [[genasi]] from The Choir.

Uthalion and Vaasurri traveled with Brindani and the genasi's twin sister, [[Ghaelya]], to [[Tohrepur]] where they confronted The Choir's leader, Lord [[Khault]] and slew him. Ghaelya's twin was so corrupted by a [[spellplague|plaguechanged]] [[sirine]] that she slew her sister to end her suffering.

==Equipment==
Uth wore leather armor and had an [[magic|enchanted]] silver ring he looted from [[Tohrepur]]. The ring allowed him to go for days without sleep, a property he found very useful as it let him avoid the nightmares that haunted his sleep.

==Appearance==
Uthalion was tall and was described as neither handsome nor ugly with a rough, worn face.
