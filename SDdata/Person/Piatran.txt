Piatran was a merchant inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He created and sold clothing, with cloaks being his specialty. Piatran could even obtain enchanted cloaks through his contacts at the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, but he only did this for select customers vouched for by Madame Garah, Elistar Thistlebuck, or Nindil Jalbuck.
Piatran wore a scarab of protection.
