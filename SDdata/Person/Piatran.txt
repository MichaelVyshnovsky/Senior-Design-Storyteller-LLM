'''Piatran''' was a merchant inhabiting the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
He created and sold clothing, with [[cloak]]s being his specialty. Piatran could even obtain enchanted cloaks through his contacts at the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]], but he only did this for select customers vouched for by Madame [[Garah]], [[Elistar Thistlebuck]], or [[Nindil Jalbuck]].

==Possessions==
Piatran wore a ''[[scarab of protection]]''.
