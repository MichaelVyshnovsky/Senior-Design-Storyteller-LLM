'''Ouwoonivisc the Infected''' was an unwilling rogue [[mind flayer]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Ouwoonivisc was somehow infected by [[Lolth]] before [[1488 DR]] and spread the infection to all the illithid hive mind.

Thank to this link, [[Asbeel]] used Ouwoonivisc to sabotage the power of the hive mind and thanks to this [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]] failed to support [[Wulfgar]] in his fight against [[Brevindon Margaster]].

Kimmuriel sensed something strange about Ouwoonivisc, namely that it was more chaotic than its fellow illithids. Kimmuriel Oblodra expressed his doubts about Ouwoonivisc to Most Endeared [[Pescatawav]]. Working together, Pescatawav and Kimmuriel discovered that Ouwoonivisc had been infected by Lolth and was unwillingly disturbing the hive mind, so Kimmuriel and Pescatawav destroyed Ouwoonivisc.
