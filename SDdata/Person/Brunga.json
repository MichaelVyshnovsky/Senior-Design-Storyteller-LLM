        "mainbody": "Brunga was the saru child responsible for a wasting disease her village became afflicted with in the late 14 century DR.\nIn the Year of Discovery on the Malatran calendar, Brunga accidentally broke her villages taboo, angering a fickle local earth spirit Ligela. The saru child fell on a patch of flowers sacred to the spirit. Her deed resulted in a curse-like disease swallowing the entire village, weakening and sating its inhabitants. Brunga outlived many of her fellow saru, but she was unconscious and consumed by relentless spasms when a group of heroes from the Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba arrived at the saru village to help, thirty days after the curse was unleashed. Both the tribes shaman and Brunga received visions of an earth spirit in a guise of a child, revealing the spirits anger towards the saru.\nIn order to appease Ligela, the village shaman â€“ Magilla, was using the last of his strength to build an idol but needed aid from the heroes of the Living Jungle. They were the only hope the surviving saru and Brunga herself had. Subsequently, the adventurers succeeded, saving Magillas and Brungas lives. Due to death and drastically reduced numbers, the survivors left the village to join another saru community on the Malatran Plateau."
