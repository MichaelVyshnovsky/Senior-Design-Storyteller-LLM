        "mainbody": "'''Vreesar''' was an [[ice devil]] who tried to conquer [[Faerûn]].",
        "Description": "Vreesar was a large, insectoid creature as were all gelugons. He had massive clawed hands and feet, sharp mandibles, compound eyes, and a thick tail with razored spikes.",
        "Abilities": "Vressar could see in the dark, was telepathic, and had several spell-like abilities, such as the ability to magically [[fly]] or create a [[wall of ice]]. He could regenerate damage and emitted an aura of fear.\n\nIf one were struck by Vreesar's tail, he or she would become frozen in place with extreme, magical cold.",
        "History": "In [[1366 DR]], thanks to a planar rift from the [[Paraelemental Plane of Ice]], Vreesar managed to enter [[Toril]], in the [[Samek Valley]] near the [[Great Glacier]] north of [[Damara]]. Soon he took control of the [[gnoll]] [[Burnt Fur tribe]] after slaying its chieftain and planned to bring more of his fellow [[baatezu]] through the rift&mdash;preferably ones that could conquer the warmer lands of Faerûn. He hoped Toril would serve as a staging ground in the baatezu's fight against the [[tanar'ri]].\n\nThe [[Harper]] [[Martine]] and the fallen paladin [[Vilheim]], with the help of some [[gnome]]s, but the outcast gnoll [[Krote]] was able to hold open Vreesar's mandibles, while Martine plunged Vilheim's magic sword down the devil's throat, destroying him."
