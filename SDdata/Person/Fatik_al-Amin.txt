Fatik al-Amin was the falconer of the Dark Wind Stables in Sarahin in 1367 DR.
Fatik was a quiet man who loved his work.
Fatik was focused solely on training an impressive array of birds including a golden eagle, four peregrine falcons, a pair of saker falcons from Dirs, and the great roc, Sar.
He was also a member of the Loyalists.
Fatik owned a ring of avian control, allowing him to easily tame and train his birds.
