'''Mlartlar''' was an [[elven]] inhabitant of [[Cormanthyr]] in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Mlartlar was the herald for [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim]]. However, in {{yearlink|241}}, while referencing the latest assassination attempts against himself, Eltargrim explained that Mlartlar thought himself a better swordsman than the Coronal, leading to the implication that he'd made one such attempt himself.
