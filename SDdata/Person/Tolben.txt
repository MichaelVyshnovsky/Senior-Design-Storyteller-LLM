'''Tolben''' was a [[druid]] in the [[Spine of the World]] in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]] and the founder of [[Kuldahar]].

==Personality==
Unlike the previous druids within the Spine of the World region, Tolben did not want to frighten the people who sought to make a haven in Kuldahar.

==History==
By [[1281 DR]], Archdruid Tolben was succeeded by [[Arundel]] as the Archdruid of Kuldahar and guardian of the [[Great Oak]]. There was a stone statue in the center of the village dedicated to Tolben.
