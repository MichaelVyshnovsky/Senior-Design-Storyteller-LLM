The so-called '''Witch of Glavvim''' was a legendary inhabitant and the source of many stories around the [[Zehoarast Floodplains]] of [[Amn]].

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Witch of Glavvim was shrouded in legends and mysteries. Reportedly, she assumed a ''[[wraithform]]'' and dwelt in one of the most remote chalets high along the [[Imnestream]] river. Some [[sage]]s said she was a were-[[watchghost]]. However, that claim remained unproven. The name of the "Witch of Glavvim" was based on a story about an adventurer who was seduced and killed for his loot by the witch. Others claimed that she could be seen wearing the guises of older and less attractive people, such as old shriveled hags and bearded woodcutters.

The guide to the [[Lands of Intrigue]], penned by [[Volothamp Geddarm]], mentioned the legend of the mysterious woman and recommended travelers to treat all they meet in the region with respect as if they were powerful spellcasters capable of malicious deeds.
