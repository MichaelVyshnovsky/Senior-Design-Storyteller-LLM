        "mainbody": "Goblin Behnie was the name used by the man who served as Kingpin of Bloomridge in Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR.\nDespite his name, Goblin Behnie had no resemblance to a goblin. In fact he was a rather tall man with a refined appearance.\nWhile his outward appearance coincided with a strong personal ego, this fa√ßade concealed a furious temper. Goblin Behnie was prone to raging assaults that often left the victim of his anger with one fewer finger.\nHe and his crew were highly skilled at providing forgeries, particularly Watch tokens and other official city documents.\nWhen the Guild faced a dangerous upstart crime lord Stone Lord, secretly allied with the Cult of the Absolute, the new kingpin gradually attacked and took territory from the Guild. By the time the Absolute crisis of the  was raging in the Gate, Goblin Behnie was one of the guild wars victims, his workshop in Bloomridge was torched and the man himself was driven underground. Presumably, Goblin Behnie was safe from the Stone Lord, but was also little help to Nine-Fingers."
