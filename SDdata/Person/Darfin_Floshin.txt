Sir '''Darfin Floshin''' was a [[sun elf]] advisor in [[Daggerford]] in [[1370 DR]]

==History==
Darfin was the son of [[Elorfindar Floshin]], who acted as guardian of a [[portal]] nexus connecting the [[Ardeep Forest]] to [[Evermeet]]. For centuries, Darfin acted together with his father as advisor to the dukes of Daggerford. Eventually, his father was forced to stop some [[daemonfey]] and destroyed the portal. When his father died Darfin was freed from his family duties.

==Activities==
He lived in a house in the center of Daggerford at the intersection of [[Hill Road]] and the [[Trade Way (Daggerford)|Trade Way]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, after the attack on [[Floshin Estates]], Lord Floshin was seeking to turn his refurbished estate into an asylum for mentally ill nobles.<ref>
