He had pride in his very wide selection of imported products. For select clients, he also procured even rarer items of an illegal nature, such as silkroot.\nUsilie ran Usilie Rostiks Smoke Shoppe, a very popular shop in the city.\nIn 1491 DR, Usilie was interrogated by an adventuring party hired to found some missing noble scions. He admitted that most of them were clients of his shop. Possibly under input of Order of the Gauntlet, the adventurers discovered his role in silkroots traffic and arrested him."
