'''Narvar Belvrost''' was a fabled member of the [[Belvrost]] clan of mages. Their tale was retold as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Rumors & Legends==
They were told to have found the "Lake Where Dragons Sleep" four centuries prior to {{yearlink|1370}}, somewhere under [[Gulthmere]].How exactly this legend came to be is unclear, as the clan was supposedly created through the machinations of [[Maxiladanarr Torstren]] sometime after {{yearlink|1322}}. It is very likely that Narvar Belvrost was intended to be read as a fabrication.
