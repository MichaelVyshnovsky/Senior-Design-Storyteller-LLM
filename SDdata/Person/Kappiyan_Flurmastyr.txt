Kappiyan Flurmastyr () was a wizard and loremaster in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.
Together with his wife, Kappiyan sold potions in order to fund his Mystra-blessed magic research. However, he did not like repeat customers who interrupted his studies more than once in a few months.
Circa 1372 DR, Kappiyan married his long-time apprentice Shalara Malarrkin
