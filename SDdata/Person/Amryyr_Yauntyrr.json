        "mainbody": "Amryyr Yauntyrr was a courier in Skullport for the Dark Dagger.\nAmryrr was born to House Druugiir, In 1370 DR, he still held on his house insignia but his relationship with his house was as good s non-existent.\nHe met his best friend Malakuth Tabuirr in Menzoberranzan when the latter still ran caravans in service of his merchant house in Karsoluthiyl. At some point, he became a member of the Dark Dagger, the main reason for his entry was that his friend Malakuth was the leader of the local cell.\nAmryyr had a reserved personality and valued his friendship with Malakuth Tabuirr.\nAmryrr followed Vhaeraun and hated Lolths priestesses for their readiness to hurt people to satisfy religious demands. In other words, female drow who didn’t act in such ways received his respect and friendship as did Xalyth,\nAmryrr was mostly traveling as part of his courier work between Skullport and many Underdark settlements, including his hometown of Menzoberranzan. He was under steady employment at the Fatted Bookworm, But mostly he wasn’t in Skullport and followed his duties as a member of the Dark Dagger as a courier wandering between Skullport and various Underdark settlements, among others his birthplace Menzoberranzan.\nApart from courier work, he worked as a supplier for Xalyth’s gem and spell component enterprise. \nMalakuth was the best friend of Amryrr and the two were very close, knowing each others secrets. The only female drow that Amryrr trusted was Xalyth, who had conquered his respect with her calm behavior, her intelligence, and her business mind."
