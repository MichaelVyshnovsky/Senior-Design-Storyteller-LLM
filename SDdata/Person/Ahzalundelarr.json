        "mainbody": "Ahzalundelarr was a black dragon living in the Wyrmbones who readily manipulated non-dragons and had extended his lifespan unnaturally without resorting to dracolichdom.\nAhzalundelarr was described as a ghostly head and set of limbs, not connected to a central body.\nAhzalundelarr both thoroughly enjoyed, and was professionally devoted to, manipulating non-dragons, particularly humans. He considered the understanding of their aims, and how to manipulate those aims, to be his lifes work, and appeared to think of little else.\nBy manipulating the Weave, Ahzalundelarr appears to have managed to exist in several planes of existence at the same time, and phase his physical form between them. He absorbed all Weave energy directed at him, including harmful magic, and didnt need to eat, sleep, or even breathe. When absorbing the energy of magic items, he could study them beforehand, in order to learn exactly how they affected the Weave, and once hed absorbed them, appeared to gain the ability to affect the Weave in the same way as the item could. Its been suggested that he was very talented at scrying, as he had never once fallen into a trap that had been laid for him - that, and he had a very efficient non-magical intelligence network at his disposal.\nAhzalundelarr possessed multiple lairs, and had amassed quite the hoard of treasure. However, he didnt care about it and only seemed to find use for his wealth when he was funding his projects, rewarding his underlings, or providing bribes for his servants to pay to whomever needed bribing. Magic items that came into his possession would be studied intensely before he absorbed them.\nAhzalundelarr worked tirelessly to undermine the ambitions of non-dragons with aspirations to build an empire. As an individual, it was said that nobody else was more effective than he in doing so. He also shared Mystras goal of spreading magic among the people, though, rather than doing so for magics sake, his goal appeared to be putting the tools in the hands of the people to better protect them against orc and goblin hordes as well as more magically-inclined evil creatures, such as beholders, mind flayers, and hags.\nAhzalundelarr was the patron of the largest of Kormuls \"wyrmcults\". They called themselves \"the talons of his claws, at work in the world\". These cultists believed him to be far older and more deserving of the title god than even ancient deities like Shar. They performed whatever actions he required of them, though they were typically kept in the dark about why he was asking them to do things.\nThe dragons goals aligned closely with those of the Chosen of Mystra, and Elminster, at one time, possibly hinted to the Magister that this might be because Ahzalundelarr melded his mind with a powerful servant of Mystra, such as a Chosen."
