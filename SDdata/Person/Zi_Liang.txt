Zi Liang was an acolyte of Chauntea at the Harvesthome Abbey in Goldenfields in the late 15 century DR.
Zi Liang often tried to convince Father Ellardin Darovik to not trust the defense of the abbey to incompetent military leaders. Zi was often on patrol.
Around 1485 DR, she was at the Harvesthome Abbey when giants attacked the Goldenfields settlement.
Zi Liang was a true devotee of Chauntea. She believed that Goldenfields was a beacon of hope in the North and she must protect it. Zi didnt trust authority and went with her heart.
