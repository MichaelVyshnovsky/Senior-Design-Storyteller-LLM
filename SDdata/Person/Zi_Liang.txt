==Activities==
Zi Liang often tried to convince Father [[Ellardin Darovik]] to not trust the defense of the abbey to incompetent military leaders. Zi was often on patrol.

==History==
Around [[1485 DR]], she was at the Harvesthome Abbey when [[giant]]s attacked the Goldenfields settlement.

==Personality==
Zi Liang was a true devotee of Chauntea. She believed that Goldenfields was a beacon of hope in the [[North]] and she must protect it. Zi didn't trust authority and went with her heart.
