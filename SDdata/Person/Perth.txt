'''Perth''', also known as '''Perth the Adept''', was a member of the [[Cowled Wizards]] of [[Amn]] and a resident of [[Brynnlaw]]. He owned a wardstone, which could lower the defenses of [[Spellhold]].

==Personality==
The [[wizard]] was very erratic in his speech and appeared to be under some sort of magical domination.

==History==
He lived in the north-east of Brynnlaw, where he retired from his Cowled Wizard duties. He was killed by [[Abdel Adrian]] in order to obtain a wardstone, which was necessary to enter Spellhold.
