'''Salatis''' was a [[Senate of Innarlith|senator]] in the city-state of [[Innarlith]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR. He became an ally of the [[Red Wizards|Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rym端t]], who used him to overthrow Ransar [[Osorkon]], the ruler of the city-state in [[1365 DR]]. Following this coup, Salatis himself became Ransar of Innarlith. <ref> He himself was killed when Senator [[Pristoleph]] used an army to take power for himself in [[1371 DR]].
{{Quote|Well, Osorkon, my old friend, by the grace of the Destroyer, by the will of Talos, I must inform you that your services to the city-state of Innarlith are no longer required. May Talos eat your wretched soul to break his fast on the morrow.|Salatis to  Ransar Osorkon as the latter lay usurped and dying following Salatis's coup<ref>}}

==Description==
He was tall at a height of {{SI|6'9"|ft-in|c|long=yes}}. He had a full head of grey hair. <ref>

==Personality==
Salatis had a tendency to change his devotion from one deity to another very quickly. He was very religious, but often didn't follow a particular deity for long before he took up the faith of another one.<ref>

==Relationships==
Marek Rym端t, acting on behalf of the Red Wizards of Thay, effectively controlled Salatis once he became Ransar of Innarlith, albeit clandestinely. Salatis was well aware that he required Marek's assistance in order to keep his position in control of the city.<ref>

Among Salatis's allies on the senate included senators [[Inthelph]] and [[Meykhati]].<ref>

==History==
In [[1364 DR]], Salatis and a group of other senators made a deal to advance [[Willem Korvan]] to the senate of Innarlith after the latter had secretly assassinated Senator [[Khonsu]].<ref>

Following these events, Ransar Osorkon made plans to begin construction of a canal that would connect the [[Lake of Steam]] to the [[Nagaflow]] and thus connect the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to the oceans of [[Toril]]. The Red Wizards would not profit from this project, as it would have greatly hurt their control of the magical ''[[portal]]'' trade that previously had been used to transport ships between either body of water.<ref>

In [[1365 DR]], Salatis was transported by Marek Rym端t to the Red Wizard's pocket dimension, the [[Land of One Hundred and Thirteen]]. There he was shown an army of [[black firedrake]]s that Marek had created. Marek explained to Salatis that he intended to give the drakes to Salatis to use in order to become Ransar and in return Salatis was to obey any directions that Marek gave to him while he served as Ransar in Innarlith. Salatis agreed to the plan.<ref>

Not long after this, Salatis and some of his allies in the senate began openly questioning and challenging Ransar Osorkon in the senate chamber regarding the canal project.<ref>

On [[Highharvestide]] in 1365 DR, civil unrest erupted and Salatis took the opportunity to stage a coup against Osorkon. Osorkon and his guards kept within the Ransar's office in the [[Palace of Many Spires]] during the unrest. The black firedrakes, which had been polymorphed into [[human]] form as a disguise, besieged the palace and broke into the Ransar's office. Salatis arrived and called on Osorkon to surrender, but Osorkon insisted on giving battle. The polymorphed black firedrakes breathed flaming [[acid]] on him and his guards, thereby killing them.<ref>

Salatis then received confirmation from the senate to become the new Ransar of Innarlith. However, he didn't end the canal project, as he saw the benefit of it to the city-state, despite the harm it would have provided to the Red Wizards and Marek's dislike for the project. Marek eventually changed his position on the canal as he realized it would be impossible to stop it from being completed, since the idea had already been put out and embraced by the Innarlan public, regardless of who Marek was able to control in the city-state's government. Marek succeeded in getting Salatis to approve, however, of allowing for the establishment of a [[Thayan enclave]] in Innarlith. He then decided to use the canal project to the advantage of the Red Wizards by getting the canal builders to use Thayan magical items or services to help build the canal.<ref> 

Salatis got the senate to dismiss [[Ivar Devorast]] from his position as chief engineer in constructing the canal and put [[Willem Korvan]], another ally of Marek Rym端t, in his place.<ref>

Senator [[Pristoleph]] desired to make himself Ransar of Innarlith and to that effect, he gained control of [[Firesteap Citadel]] and built an army there with the intention of taking control of the city. Salatis attempted to assassinate Pristoleph by sending the assassin [[T'juyu]] in the guise of a [[water naga]] but was unsuccessful. Eventually, Pristoleph invaded and laid siege to the city. Marek betrayed Salatis and helped Pristoleph gain power. Salatis was murdered during the siege in [[1371 DR]] in the [[Palace of Many Spires]] by the same black firedrake bodyguards that had killed Ransar Osorkon during Salatis's coup of 1365 DR.
