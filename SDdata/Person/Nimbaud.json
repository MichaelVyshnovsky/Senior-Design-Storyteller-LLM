        "mainbody": "Nimbaud was the highest-ranking member of the Zhentarim left in Zhentil Keep during late 1368 DR.\nNimbaud chose to remain in Zhentil Keep in 1368 DR when Manshoon, sensing Cyrics plan, decided to relocate most of the Zhentarim, himself included, to the Citadel of the Raven. Nimbaud, hoping to impress the senior wizard, volunteered to remain behind to control the situation and command a small group of Zhentarim wizards. Thus the Zhentarim could say that they had not abandoned the Keep.\nOn Marpenoth 29 of 1369, Nimbaud helped the high cleric Fzoul Chembryl to bind the pit fiend who was impersonating Orgauth, the wizard believing they would soon inform Manshoon of their discovery. Instead, Fzoul and Abarax slew Nimbaud, established Orgauth/Abarax on the Council of Lords and appointed him as Lord of Zhentil Keep. Nimbaud was replaced by a baatezu to prevent his death from disturbing day-to-day operations within the keep."
