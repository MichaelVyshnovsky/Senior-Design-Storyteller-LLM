Klarz was a hobgoblin sea-captain on the Trackless Sea in the late 15 century DR. He was the captain of the Koalinth.
Once, Klarz and a ranger member of the Emerald Enclave were marooned together on an island in the Korinn Archipelago. It was plagued with monsters and the ranger saved his life, a debt that Klarz promised to repay.
After 1485 DR, Klarz repaid his debt by providing passage to Enclave-affiliated adventurers traveling in search of the Morkoth. The Koalinth anchored in a cove some miles north of Waterdeep.
