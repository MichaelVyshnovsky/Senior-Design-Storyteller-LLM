'''Jade Panther''' was an infamous [[monk]] from the nation of [[Shou Lung]] in [[Kara-Tur]], active some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Jade Panther's infamy came from the use of special [[gloves]]—the ''[[Claws of the Jade Panther]]''—that were adorned with razor-sharp blades to savage his opponents more effectively. Finally, Jade Panther's consort, [[Li Mei]], grew disgusted with the monk's cruelty, stole the ''Claws of the Jade Panther'', and tasked her servant with destroying the gloves once and for all. But Jade Panther's torturous implements were not destroyed, and, instead, ended up on the black market.
