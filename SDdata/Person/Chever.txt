'''Chever''' was a [[Netherese]] [[archwizard]] and well-renowned [[mentalist]].

==Personality==
Chever was an arcanist obsessed with discovering new things and retaining the knowledge of them.

==History==
Chever was born in {{YearlinkConvert|1894|NY}} and established the Netherese enclave [[Opus]] at 39 years old. Upon Opus, he ordered the construction of universities, theatres, and other academic buildings. Chever was also interested in [[spell]] creation, and developed ''[[contact other plane]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1945|NY}} and ''[[simulacrum]]'' 11 years later. Driven by his obsession with acquiring knowledge, he used his first spell to repeatedly contact extraplanar beings. Because of this, he was driven insane and jumped into a ''[[sphere of annihilation]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1960|NY}}.
