'''Reesa''' was [[Hagen]]'s daughter in [[Neverwinter]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Reesa was a merchant and Hagen's daughter. Reesa would greet the [[Kalach-Cha]] if the Kalach-Cha sided with the Watch. Like her father, she thought the Watch was ineffective, but would gain a better impression of them. Before thieves came, Hagen dismissed her, as she could have been captured.
