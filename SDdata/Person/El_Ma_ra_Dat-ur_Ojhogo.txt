El Mara Dat-Ur Ojhogo, meaning "the tall god who lets men sit upon his head" in Midani, was a place spirit that inhabited the sandstone mesa located near the El Mara oasis in the Sword region of Anauroch. He was venerated by the Bedine people of the desert.
El Maras mesa served as a lookout point for the Bedine tribespeople that camped out at the oasis that bore his name. He was quite okay with letting them sit upon his head.
