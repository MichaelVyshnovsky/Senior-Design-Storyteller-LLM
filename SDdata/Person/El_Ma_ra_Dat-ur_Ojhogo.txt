'''El Ma'ra Dat-Ur Ojhogo''', meaning "the tall god who lets men sit upon his head" in [[Midani]], was a [[place spirit]] that inhabited the sandstone mesa located near the [[El Ma'ra]] oasis in [[the Sword]] region of [[Anauroch]]. He was venerated by the [[Bedine]] people of the desert.

==Activities==
El Ma'ra's mesa served as a lookout point for the Bedine tribespeople that camped out at the oasis that bore his name. He was quite okay with letting them sit upon his head.
