Morale Officer '''Deneld''' was an officer of the [[Shining Crusade]] that served at their military headquarters at [[Dragonspear Castle]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{Quote|There are so many newcomers to the cause these days I can't keep track of them all. That's a good thing.|The Morale Officer, to recruits of the [[Shining Crusade]].}}

==Description==
He was a charismatic man and a skilled orator. 

==Personality==
Deneld was a proud devotee of the [[Shining Lady]] [[Caelar Argent]] and was quite knowledgeable about her and her cause. 

==Possessions==
Deneld wielded a ''+1 [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[shortsword]]'' and a ''+1 enchanted [[crossbow|light crossbow]]'' in battle. He supplemented his martial armaments with a ''[[wand of paralyzation]]''. 

Likely due to his unwavering devotion and commitment, Deneld was a proud owner of one of the ''[[Ring of the Crusade|rings of the Crusade]]''. 

He also kept a shard that had broken off from the ''[[Hold of Battle Lions#Interior|Altar of Tempus]]'' at the [[Hold of Battle Lions]] shrine. 

==Activities==
In order to maintain morale among the crusaders, Deneld spent much of his time addressing the new recruits as they arrived at Castle Dragonspear. When he noticed individuals that showed real potential, he often had them speak to other crusaders and learn more about their shared cause and call to battle.

As an officer he received daily reports about the status of the Crusade's efforts.
