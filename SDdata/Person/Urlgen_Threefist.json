        "mainbody": "rlgen Threefist was an orc and the son of King Obould Many-Arrows.\nIn the Battle of Shallows of 1370 DR, Urlgen led some of his fathers forces against Shallows, with the orcs fighting from the south while some of Dame Gerti Orelsdottrs giants threw stones from across a ravine to the north. Shallows was ultimately leveled by the attack, causing the death of Withegroo SeianDoo the wizard.\nUrlgen was approached during the campaign by Gerti Orelsdottr, seeking to diminish his fathers standing, lending Urlgen the aid of a number of frost giants, who built giant catapults to help crush the dwarves standing against him. Nanfoodle caused the catapults to collapse however, using his knowledge as an alchemist to make the wood weaker.\nThe fighting was intense and Urlgen wrongfooted Innovindil when he used his headbutt against her, leaving her a little stunned, but she recovered. Ultimately, Urlgen fell as Innovindil drew her boot dagger and drove it up into his head as he attempted another for another headbutt. Whilst Innovindil fought with Urlgen, Drizzt and Guenhwyvar provided her with cover, keeping the other orcs from the fight."
