        "mainbody": "'''Urlgen Threefist''' was an [[orc]] and the son of King [[Obould]] Many-Arrows.",
        "History": "In the [[Battle of Shallows]] of [[1370 DR]], Urlgen led some of his father's forces against [[Shallows]], with the orcs fighting from the south while some of Dame [[Gerti Orelsdottr]]'s [[giant]]s threw stones from across a ravine to the north. Shallows was ultimately leveled by the attack, causing the death of [[Withegroo Seian'Doo]] the [[wizard]].\n\nUrlgen was approached during the campaign by [[Gerti Orelsdottr]], seeking to diminish his father's standing, lending Urlgen the aid of a number of [[frost giant]]s, who built giant catapults to help crush the [[dwarves]] standing against him. [[Nanfoodle]] caused the catapults to collapse however, using his knowledge as an [[alchemist]] to make the wood weaker.\n\nThe fighting was intense and Urlgen wrongfooted [[Innovindil]] when he used his headbutt against her, leaving her a little stunned, but she recovered. Ultimately, Urlgen fell as Innovindil drew her boot dagger and drove it up into his head as he attempted another for another headbutt. Whilst Innovindil fought with Urlgen, [[Drizzt]] and [[Guenhwyvar]] provided her with cover, keeping the other orcs from the fight."
