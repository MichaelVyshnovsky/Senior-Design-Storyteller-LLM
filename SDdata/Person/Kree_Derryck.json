        "Description": "Kree was a stout duergar woman with grey eyes and skin. She kept her scalp and face clean-shaven. Kree had a [[tattoo]] in her lips.",
        "History": "After Kree Derryck joined the Cult of the Absolute, she found a use for her ability to kill with a mere whisper. Despite Kree being a valuable asset to the [[Absolute]], her total devotion to her warlock patron meant Kree could never dedicate herself to the new deity fully. This signed her death warrant, and Kree was killed by the cult in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Her soul yearned for revenge, and Kree Derryck ended up among the dozen individuals plucked from the [[Fugue Plane]], chosen by the entity called [[Withers]] to aid in his campaign against the [[Dead Three]] and their Cult of the Absolute."
