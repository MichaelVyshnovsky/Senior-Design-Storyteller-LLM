'''Icehauptannarthanyx''', or '''Icehaupt''', was a venerable [[white dragon]] who laired on [[Mount Speartop]] in the [[Cloud Peaks]] of [[Amn]].

==Personality==
Icehaupt was very cautious and cunning, choosing to avoid detection rather than be known openly. He dealt with the threat of [[human]]s by largely ignoring and avoiding them, only attacking when they were easily overcome or about to discover his lair. He understood that knowledge of his lair and the treasure within would bring far more attention than he could handle, and wished to enjoy his favored territory without such bothers.

==Possessions==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Icehaupt had a hoard of over half a million [[danter]]s in [[jewelry]] and [[gem]]s, and more than 30 powerful [[magical item]]s.

==Activities==
Icehaupt laired in an inaccessible cave on the northeast face of Mount Speartop, about {{SI|800|ft|long=yes}} short of the peak (itself {{SI|14500|ft|long=yes}} tall), and was the only dragon of note in the Cloud Peaks besides another mysterious [[red dragon]] who was slain by [[Araugauthos]] north of [[Citadel Amnur]]. He was very reclusive, and only left his lair 15 times between the 6{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries DR.

Although mountaineering to the summit of Mount Speartop was a popular hobby for wealthy Amnians, they rarely encountered Icehaupt. The mountainside around his lair was extremely difficult to climb, and the few who chose that path up were swiftly devoured. As the northeast face was already a dangerous route, their disappearances were blamed on a combination of bad luck and foolishness.

Despite his lofty isolation, Icehaupt took an interest in matters that could affect him. In particular, he kept an eye on ''[[Ghazir the Desert's Edge]]'', held by [[Iryklathagra]], to ensure it was not used to alter the cold climate of the Cloud Peaks.

==History==
Icehaupt's most notable action was his attack on the realm of [[Minsorran]]. During a harsh blizzard in the winter of the {{YearlinkName|600}}, Icehaupt attacked [[Minsor Vale]] and the other three towns and devoured all of their inhabitants, leaving no traces of his passing.
