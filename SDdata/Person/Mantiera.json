        "mainbody": "Mantiera was a human druid who enjoyed shapeshifting into the form of a seal.\nIn her seal form, Mantiera had brownish-black skin. The only telltale mark of her true nature was the red medallion fastened around her neck.\nShe preferred taking the form of a seal primarily because she liked the feeling of water on her fur. She liked swimming alone, but would occasionally travel alongside friendly seal families.\nShe was unusually dexterous, making her difficult for foes to land a blow on.\nMantiera owned a medallion of thought projection."
