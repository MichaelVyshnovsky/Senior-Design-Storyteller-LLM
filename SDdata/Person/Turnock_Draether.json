        "Personality": "Turnock had been fascinated by traveling [[hedge wizard]]s from a young age.",
        "History": "The child of two herbalists near the location occupied by [[Mosstone]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Turnock traveled to [[Zazesspur]] to become a mage's apprentice after his parents died one winter. He was repeatedly and rudely rebuffed, until he aided a wizard who was too drunk to walk back home, and by supporting him on the way home, he was finally accepted as an apprentice. That wizard was [[Belmer]] of the Six Thunders, who put a special tattoo on Turnock's chest, which would kill him if he were to attempt any treachery. Turnock came to hate his master quite heartily.\n\nDuring the [[Night of Fourteen Magisters]], Turnock split his master's head and chest in two with a single stroke from a large axe, expecting that he could not activate the tattoo's effect. However, the flesh around his tattoo began to rot as quickly as his master did; Turnock had to work quickly on a counterspell. Though he was successful, he was shaken by the experience, seeing it as a demonstration of power from [[Mystra]]. He spent his career training no less than sixty wizards, and aiding them in their endeavors."
