        "mainbody": "Turnock Draether was the Magister from  to .\nTurnock had been fascinated by traveling hedge wizards from a young age.\nThe child of two herbalists near the location occupied by Mosstone in the late 14 century DR, Turnock traveled to Zazesspur to become a mages apprentice after his parents died one winter. He was repeatedly and rudely rebuffed, until he aided a wizard who was too drunk to walk back home, and by supporting him on the way home, he was finally accepted as an apprentice. That wizard was Belmer of the Six Thunders, who put a special tattoo on Turnocks chest, which would kill him if he were to attempt any treachery. Turnock came to hate his master quite heartily.\nDuring the Night of Fourteen Magisters, Turnock split his masters head and chest in two with a single stroke from a large axe, expecting that he could not activate the tattoos effect. However, the flesh around his tattoo began to rot as quickly as his master did Turnock had to work quickly on a counterspell. Though he was successful, he was shaken by the experience, seeing it as a demonstration of power from Mystra. He spent his career training no less than sixty wizards, and aiding them in their endeavors."
