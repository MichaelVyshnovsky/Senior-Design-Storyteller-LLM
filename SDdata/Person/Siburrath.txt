Siburrath was a merfolk who was captured and killed by followers of Umberlee sometime during the late 14 or early 15 centuries DR.
Siburrath did not find peace in death. As a type of spectral undead, he attempted to possess anyone he encountered.
At some point in his life, Siburrath was imprisoned by the captain of the Bitch Queen, either aboard the vessel itself, or within the fortress of Dangwaru.
Siburrath manifestes then as a ghost, bound to the shark cage that was once used to torture prisoners taken aboard the Bitch Queen. The soul of the unfortunate merfolk could not rest until his tormentor―the captain of the ship who had been transformed into a giant slug―was herself slain.
