        "Description": "Cyrog was described to be enormous, and was situated within a large pool.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Cyrog was dying. The [[mind flayer]], [[Xetzirbor]], left Cyrog to find a cure for the dying elder brain and travelled to [[Gravenhollow]]. However, after Xetzirbor had left, a burst of [[faerzress]] occurred in the chamber, and [[Orcus]] appeared. Orcus pointed his [[Wand of Orcus|wand]] at the dying elder brain. Cyrog then communicated with the illithids under his control, telling them that Orcus had saved it, and that they should follow it into [[undeath]]."
