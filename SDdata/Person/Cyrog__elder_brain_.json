        "mainbody": "Cyrog was an elder brain of the Underdark settlement also known as Cyrog.\nCyrog was described to be enormous, and was situated within a large pool.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Cyrog was dying. The mind flayer, Xetzirbor, left Cyrog to find a cure for the dying elder brain and travelled to Gravenhollow. However, after Xetzirbor had left, a burst of faerzress occurred in the chamber, and Orcus appeared. Orcus pointed his wand at the dying elder brain. Cyrog then communicated with the illithids under his control, telling them that Orcus had saved it, and that they should follow it into undeath."
