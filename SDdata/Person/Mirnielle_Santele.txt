'''Countess Mirnielle Santele''' was a [[Tethyr]]ian noblewoman who lived in the city of [[Saradush]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
She was a reasonable person who had mixed opinions of her family members. While she was devoted to her son [[Ardic Santele|Ardic]], she had little regard for her husband [[Count Santele]].

==History==
When the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]] threatened Saradush in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, her husband was exiled from the city. She became the ''de facto'' ruler of the city.

A short time later, her son Ardic was abducted by the unscrupulous [[Kiser Jhaeri]]. She acquiesced to Kiser's demands and assisted with the false imprisonment of the soldier [[Mateo]], in order to clear Kiser of his treasonous acts against the city.

She was present within the city when it was besieged and nearly destroyed by the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Yaga-Shura]] and his [[fire giant]] army.
