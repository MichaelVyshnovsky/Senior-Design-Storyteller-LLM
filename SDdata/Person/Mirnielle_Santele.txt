Countess Mirnielle Santele was a Tethyrian noblewoman who lived in the city of Saradush during the midâ€“14 century DR.
She was a reasonable person who had mixed opinions of her family members. While she was devoted to her son Ardic, she had little regard for her husband Count Santele.
When the Bhaalspawn crisis threatened Saradush in the , her husband was exiled from the city. She became the de facto ruler of the city.
A short time later, her son Ardic was abducted by the unscrupulous Kiser Jhaeri. She acquiesced to Kisers demands and assisted with the false imprisonment of the soldier Mateo, in order to clear Kiser of his treasonous acts against the city.
She was present within the city when it was besieged and nearly destroyed by the Bhaalspawn Yaga-Shura and his fire giant army.
