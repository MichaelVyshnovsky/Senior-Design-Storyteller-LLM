Goraun was one of the apprentices of Lady Maerjanthra Shalace in the mid-14 century DR.
Jonczer worked under Maerjanthra Shalace, the jeweler.
His fellow apprentices included Jonczer, Rivrel, Tantheld and Rorgel.
Goraun was one of Maerjanthra Shalaces apprentices while she was alive. He was working under her since at least approximately , the birth of Narnra Shalace, who was twenty or twenty-two years old in . At that time, he was a witness to Maerjanthras plot to bear Elminster Aumar a child, on which she was aided by Khelben Arunsun, who under duress from the goddess Mystra gave her a potion to override Elminsters control over his own fertility. He recounted this to Jonczer.
Shortly after Maerjanthras death, Goraun disappeared after a break-in killed his fellow apprentice Rorgel.
