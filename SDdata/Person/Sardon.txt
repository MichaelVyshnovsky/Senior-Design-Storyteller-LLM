'''Sardon''' was a sorcerer dying on or before the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
At some point before {{Yearlink|767}}, Sardon had a romantic relationship with [[Saeraede Lyonora]], an apparently unique [[Netherese]] [[ghost]]-like entity. He fed her his own lifeforce for a time, lasting about as long as [[Brandagaeris]] lasted, but she'd drained him completely by the end.
