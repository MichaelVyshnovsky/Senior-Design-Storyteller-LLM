'''Therus''' ({{Pronounce|DHER|us|refs={{Cite adventurers league/The Drowned Tower|31}}}}) was a leader of the [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]] in [[Mulmaster]] in [[1491 DR]].

==History==
Therus established a small chapter of the cult inside a former [[Zhent]] watchtower near Mulmaster. There, in 1491 DR, he met and recruited the Cloak [[Drayson Fivestars]].

At last, an adventuring party hired by [[Salvar Brix]], a fellow Cloak of Drayson, defeated him and his minions.{{Cite adventurers league/The Drowned Tower|5}}
