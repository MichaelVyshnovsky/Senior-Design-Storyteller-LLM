Therus () was a leader of the Cult of the Crushing Wave in Mulmaster in 1491 DR.
Therus established a small chapter of the cult inside a former Zhent watchtower near Mulmaster. There, in 1491 DR, he met and recruited the Cloak Drayson Fivestars.
At last, an adventuring party hired by Salvar Brix, a fellow Cloak of Drayson, defeated him and his minions.
