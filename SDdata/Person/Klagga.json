        "mainbody": "Tracker '''Klagga''' was a [[goblin]] raider that was among the group that joined the [[Cult of the Absolute]] stationed at the [[Shattered Sanctum]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Mebbe they're a bit loose, but that's cuz I keep myself in shape.|Klagga, on the fit of his new pants.}}",
        "Description": "Klagga had one \"stumpy\" leg and a notably bad eye. He bore the ''[[mark of the Absolute]]''.",
        "History": "At some point, the [[drow]] woman [[Minthara Baenre|Minthara]] traveled out from Moonrise Towers and visited the Shattered Sanctum. There she took note of Klagga, and told him he may some actual worth if he fought as well as he played games with his fellow goblins. Klagga was absolutely smitten. He finally wrote her a love letter and stashed it behind a waterfall near the sanctum, hopeful to offer it to her after the next raid.\n\nKlagga was among the raiding party that pillaged the inn of [[Waukeen's Rest]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. His greatest treasure from the raid was a pair of blue pants he stole from a [[dwarven]] man, which he felt looked exceptionally good on him. He even recovered some poetry written by the dwarf, which was in fact encoded secrets about the inner reaches of the sanctum."
