Groshin Lor () was the leader of the Hawks secret police in Mulmaster in 1491 DR.
Groshin was tortured by Thayans as a young man.
In time, he became the leader of the Hawks in Mulmaster, one of the most trusted servants of High Blade Jaseen Drakehorn. He also had dealings with the Lords Alliance.
In 1491 DR, he hired an adventuring party to discover what had happened to a nearby iron mine, after a previous expedition of soldiers had disappeared.
