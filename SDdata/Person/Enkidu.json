        "mainbody": "Enkidu was a famed unbeatable warrior from the eastern lands of Kara-Tur, who was active some years before 1369 DR.\nEnkidus battle prowess were said to be unmatched by any. No one was brave enough to challenge the warrior to fair combat, yet many stealthy attacks on Enkidu came from Kara-Turan assassins, ninjas, and wu-jen. Thankfully, a suit of enchanted armor, created specifically for Enkidu, prevented such cowardly attacks from being successful. Enkidus full plate armor was a famed enough item so many copies and imitations were created by the late 14 century DR, but none could compete to the original."
