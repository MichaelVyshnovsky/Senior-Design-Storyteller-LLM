        "mainbody": "'''Enkidu''' was a famed unbeatable [[warrior]] from the eastern lands of [[Kara-Tur]], who was active some years before [[1369 DR]].",
        "History": "Enkidu's battle prowess were said to be unmatched by any. No one was brave enough to challenge the warrior to fair combat, yet many stealthy attacks on Enkidu came from Kara-Turan [[assassin]]s, [[ninja]]s, and [[wu-jen]]. Thankfully, a suit of [[enchanted]] armor, created specifically for Enkidu, prevented such cowardly attacks from being successful. ''[[Enkidu's full plate]] armor'' was a famed enough item so many copies and imitations were created by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], but none could compete to the original."
