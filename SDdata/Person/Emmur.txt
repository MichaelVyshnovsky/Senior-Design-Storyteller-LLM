'''Emmur''' was a gofer in the kitchens of [[Castle Obarskyr]] in [[Suzail]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}} while preparing for the [[Council of the Dragon]], the Master of Revels, [[Khaladan Mallowfaer]], sent Emmur and [[Darlakan]] to fetch wagons and bring new chairs and stools from [[Zorsin's Dock]]. He later sent [[Halance Tarandar]] after them, to make sure they didn't break everything.
