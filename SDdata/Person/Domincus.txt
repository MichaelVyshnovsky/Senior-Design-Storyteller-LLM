'''Domincus''' was an [[Amn]]ian bishop of [[Helm]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] and a member of [[Cordell]]'s [[Maztica]]n expedition in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}.

==History==
He took his daughter, [[Martine (Amnian)|Martine]], on the voyage and when she was sacrificed by the natives of [[Payit]] he demanded retribution. Domincus's thirst for vengeance led to a short war between the [[Golden Legion]] and Payit. The Legion easily won and claimed the Payit capital of [[Ulatos]] as a spoil of war.

Domincus was captured by [[Nexal]]ans during the Golden Legion's retreat from Nexal and was sacrificed to [[Zaltec]].<br />
