Nogah was a kuo-toa senior whip and a cleric. 
Nogah had scaled skin and webbed hands and feet, and was quite bloated. Her face was round and surmounted by wide, bulbous eyes that rarely blinked. Her long lip-less mouth was full of needle-like teeth. She often wore gold-hued garments and a gold crown.
Nogah was a devoted whip and a cleric of Blidboolploolp, which was evident from her following into the depths of a drowned illithid city following what she assumed was the voice of her goddess. Later she amassed cult-like following using the powers of Dreamheart showing the same zeal and devotion to it, as well as a lust for power. 
She worked with Thoster several times.
In 1395 DR, she found the Dreamheart in a drowned illithid city deep under the Sea of Fallen Stars.
In 1396 DR, she was stripped of her whip status when she started to preach about an ancient power revealed to her by the Dreamheart. When the kuo-toa of Olleth attempted to stop her, she summoned the kraken Gethshemeth.
After the Kraken turned on Nogah and claimed the Dreamhart artifact for himself, Nogah contacted her acquaintance Captain Thoster promising an alliance if he were to help her recover the aberrant orb. Captain Thosters crew along with Noga faced the Kraken, aberrant kuo-toa, and other aquatic creatures enthralled by Dreamheart. Nogah was killed by poisoned crossbow bolts fired by aberrant kuo-toa in 1396 DR.
She used a golden-hued pincer-staff.
Nogah could co-generate bolts of lightning with another kuo-tan whip.
