During the [[Darkening]] and the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] in the mid-1480s [[DR]], Giismekhan stood guard over a ''[[portal]]'' in the [[Demonweb Pits]] that led to the [[Underdark]] near [[Eveningstar]]. Giismekhan was overcome by [[adventurer]]s from [[Eberron]] who sought a way to [[Toril]] after passing through the [[Spinner's Prison]].
