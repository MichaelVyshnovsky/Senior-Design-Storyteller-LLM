She controlled the sale of weapons and travel gear within the city.\nShe was an accomplished warrior,\nEkene-Afa was a brave warrior and a tough negotiator. She demanded respect from those she met, and did not tolerate fools. She did not mind endangering her allies if it meant a better chance for victory, but she was also a woman of her word.\nWithin Port Nyanzaru, Ekene-Afa had a monopoly on the sale of all non-magical armaments and weaponsWhile Ekene-Afa sold shields, a different merchant Prince, Zhanthi controlled the sale of armor. Likewise, although she sold riding tack and wagons, Ifan Talroa, controlled the sale of mounts and beasts of burden. In weapons, she most often dealt in yklwas, flint daggers, and wood or reptile-hide shields. She also sold a limited number of magic weapons, ammunition, and shields in partnership with fellow merchant prince Wakanga Otamu, whom she paid for the enchantments.\nShe had the authority to issue commands to the garrison and ballista batteries at Fort Nyanzaru. \nLike other merchant princes, Ekene-Afa maintained a villa in Port Nyanzarus Merchants Ward, specifically on Throne Hill.\nEkene-Afa was married to a noted artist, Kura. They had two sons, Soshen and Tiryk, who were each named after a river in Chult.\nHer monopoly, like those of other merchant princes, was enforced with the help of the Ytepka Society. Any arms merchants or blacksmiths hoping to sell weapons in Port Nyanzaru had to go through Ekene-Afa or one of her weapon buyers, such as Silaha Mnunzi.\nShe counted Alastar Bol of the Order of the Gauntlet as an ally.\nEkene-Afa was originally a gladiator who fought for adulation and riches within Port Nyanzaru. After a few noted victories, she used her prize winnings to invest in a fledgling mercantile business that became wildly successful. Even as she became a full-time trader and politician, Ekene-Afa remained a hero among the common folk who still recalled watching her in the arena. Her statue was included atop the Grand Coliseum alongside those of other great arena champions, and busts of her face decorated a number of street corners in the city.\nAfter the rediscovery of the lost city of Omu during the events of the death curse, Ekene-Afa took an active role in directing adventurers to reclaim it.\nWhen Idrianne Smoke and her fiendish pirates laid siege to Port Nyanzaru, Ekene-Afa personally led the defense of the Market Ward as well as coordinated an attack against the pirate flagship, the Banshee."
