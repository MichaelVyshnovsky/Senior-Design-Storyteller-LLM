        "mainbody": "'''Filvendor Floshin''' was the youngest son of [[Elorfindar Floshin]] in [[Daggerford]] around [[1327 DR]] and [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Filvendor was the father of [[Kelson Darktreader]] and [[Filarion]].\n\nOn one or more occasions, he disappeared from the town.<ref group=\"note\">''Under Illefarn'' indicates Filvendor disappeared to the east 20 years prior, while ''The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier'' includes his residence and description. It is unclear whether this was included for reference or if he had returned at that time and later disappeared again. His son Filarion went to search him but with no success and Filvendor was presumed dead after [[1468 DR]].\n\nHe lived in a small house located on [[Tymora Alley]] in central Daggerford behind the [[Harvest House]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}",
        "Personality": "Filvendor was the son who most resembled Elorfindar. He was spirited and untamed and didn't avoid stress in his daily routine, like his father. Elorfindar put much effort into guiding Filvendor, but the son always remained in control of his destiny and was trying to find his personal path."
