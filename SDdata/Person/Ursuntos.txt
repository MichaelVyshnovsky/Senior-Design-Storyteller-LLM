'''Ursuntos''' was the Grand Disciple of [[Orcus]] who oversaw the [[Temple of Filth]] in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a [[ghoul]] whose appearance was so gruesome and horrid that he struck fear even among other worshipers of Orcus. He carried a [[holy symbol]] of Orcus and grasped a [[rod]] within his claws.

==Personality==
Ursuntos spoke with a raspy voice. He hungered for the flesh of his enemies, and would recite a series of oaths to Orcus as he prepared their bodies to be eaten.

==Abilities==
Ursuntos could paralyze his foes with his voice, allowing his allies to mob them. Any ghoul who was slain in his presence would rise again as a [[zombie]].

==Relationships==
Ursuntos was the most politically powerful being in Evernight aside from [[Evernight#Government|the tribunal]]. His ghoul and [[vampire]] underpriests tended to his every whim with haste.

==History==
It was said that, in life, Ursuntos had been a servant of Orcus who killed and ate a [[priest]] of [[Bahamut]], and when he finally died&mdash;with a prayer to Orcus on his lips&mdash;this great sin caused him to experience an unholy transformation into a powerful and terrifying ghoul in Orcus's service. As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, he had become the Grand Disciple at the Temple of Filth.
