Coril (Pronounce|KOR|ill|refs=
Coril was the illegitimate daughter of the rich mercenary lord Sarraver of Baldurs Gate. She ran away from him and went to Waterdeep, where she had settled in her new identity by 1357 DR. Sarraver had no idea as to her location. She was still there through 1368 DR. 
However, circa 1372 DR, Sarraver had recently found his wayward daughter. Coril was unwilling to leave Waterdeep to avoid Sarravers attentions, and so had to stay and reject his agents growing numbers of attempts to take her back to be married off.
Coril appeared as a young man who was handsome
Coril was very quiet, almost to a fault.
Coril was usually found sitting in the corners of the taprooms of the citys inns and taverns (such as the Sel√ªnes Smile). He seemed to be a people watcher, simply observing all the folk passing by and what went on. In his book, Coril made many notes and sketches, and also wrote terrible poems some of this was coded information for the Harpers whom she worked for.
Coril would also cast spells for a price and trade copies of spells in exchange for magical items or useful spells he was lacking. He would also tutor fellow mages, but not for free.
Corils spellbooks were concealed in a secret compartment in Mariners Hall, in a cavity behind a loose stone in a minaret on the roof. Coril possessed no magical items.
Coril knew a wide variety of early cantrips like bluelight, firefinger, giggle, and smokepuff and others, and a dozen minor spells, including comprehend languages, dancing lights, hold portal, shocking grasp, and write.
She was agile and a capable climber.
