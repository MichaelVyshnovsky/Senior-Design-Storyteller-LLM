Shelaya was a bard who performed at the Golden Goblet Inn in Mossbridges in the late 14 century DR.
Shelaya was a petite human woman with a head of flaming-red hair, green eyes, and a pleasant smile.
She was familiar with a good half-orc fighter who occasionally visited the Goblet – he retired fighter, Chester Hearth. Shelaya knew of a way to get to the orcs hut and was aware of Chesters old master – the priest named Athoomb.
When a new popular inn opened in Mossbridges in the late 14 century DR, the Golden Goblet Inn became Shelayas employer. She would often be found at the inn, plucking her mandolin and performing various songs, melodies, and tales.
