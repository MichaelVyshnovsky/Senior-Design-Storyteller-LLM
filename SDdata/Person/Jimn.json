        "History": "In the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} the fleeing Lord [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] ordered Jimn—or, as he called him, \"harbormaster person\"—to ready a ship to give chase to his treasure ship, which had been stolen by [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Holga Kilgore]], [[Doric]], [[Simon Aumar]], and [[Kira]]. However, Jimn was more distracted by the sight of [[Sofina]] invoking the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'' above the [[Neverwinter arena]] and, in any case, that treasure ship drifted out of control back into port, crashing into a boat and no doubt giving poor Jimn more concerns."
