        "History": "During his life as a mortal, he possessed the ''[[shield of Egons]]'' and cherished it dearly.\n\nWhen the individual known as [[Korlasz]] delved into her family's crypts, her followers and mercenaries desecrated the sanctity of Fanegonorom's resting place. He sought Korlasz's death so that he could rest in peace."
