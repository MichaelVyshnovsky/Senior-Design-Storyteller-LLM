'''Khondall Sszundar''' was a mage of [[Faerûn]].

''Circa'' [[1357]] DR, Khondall bought the ''[[Book of Bats]]'' from the merchant [[Chulu Thall]] of [[Ithmong (disambiguation)|Ithmong]], and was able to catalog the tome's spells. But he had it but briefly before an unknown enemy dispatched [[demon]]s that demolished his tower, and the tome was lost. Shortly after, the ''Book of Bats'' resurfaced in [[Innarlith]], then was swiftly stolen.The date of this is unknown, only being sometime between the ''Book of Bats'''s appearance in c. [[1147 DR]] and its last disappearance c. [[1357 DR]].
