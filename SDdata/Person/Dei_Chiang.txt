'''Dei Chiang''' was the proprietor of a laundry in the [[Xiousing]] district of [[Marsember]].

Chiang had a difficult life after her husband, a [[Shou]] [[Purple Dragon knight]], was killed in action. Alone, she tried to raise their six daughters.

Chiang liked to know everything that happened in the quarter and was an active member of the xenophobic society known as [[The Chuen]].{{Cite dungeon/195/Backdrop: Xiousing}}
