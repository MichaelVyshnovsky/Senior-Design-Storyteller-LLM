        "mainbody": "Maerthra Dunvelgeld, more commonly known as Lady Monster, was a monster breeder who resided on Tower March of Waterdeeps North Ward in the late 15 century DR.\nLady Monster was a tall and beautiful aging human woman. She had a cheerful demeanor and lush purring voice. Maerthras most notable feature was her wild head of black hair, peppered with gray.\nMaerthras home was located on the southfront Tower March, where it closed with Immar Street. The first thing visitors saw as they entered Lady Monsters parlor was a roomful of monster parts and trophies for sale. They included a wide variety of items such as antlered skulls, jarred tentacles, giant fangs, and other curios. Each item in Maerthras collection was priced individually and heavily negotiated.\nMaerthras career was built around breeding and selling various exotic creatures. She often sought capable adventurers out, sending them up and down the Sword Coast North to capture living and \"disassembled\" monsters for her clients.\nWhen more exotic living specimens were required, Lady Monster connected her clients with one of her many contacts who knew where to procure something like a living young gold dragon.\nIn her youth, Lady Monster claimed to have been an adventurer who hailed from Chessenta. By the , Maerthra Dunvelgeld established her business and new home on Tower Marc. As of the  and the decade that followed, Lady Monster still ran her business from the same base and was likely to remain active for 20 more years.\n*Waterdeeps rumor mill talked about doppelganger, drow, mind flayers, and other strange late-night visitors to Lady Monsters parlor. Some especially preposterous telltales claimed that the womans bedroom was guarded by a tamed grell, while others insinuated Maerthra Dunvelgeld was in close relations with one of the Masked Lord of the City of Splendors and several heads of noble families."
