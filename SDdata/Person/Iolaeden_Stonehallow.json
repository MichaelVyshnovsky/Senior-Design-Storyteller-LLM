        "Description": "Her long, wild hair was the color of flame.",
        "Personality": "She had a fiery temper. She eventually got sick of being a slave.",
        "Abilities": "She was famous for her spells that allowed her to belch forth [[red dragon]] breath.",
        "Possessions": "As a young woman, Iolaeden had stolen a [[spellbook]] from her master, from which she learned every spell.",
        "Activities": "Before being the Magister, Iolaeden was an enslaved kitchen hand and orphan in [[Calimshan]]. She also spent many nights learning magic after stealing a spellbook.\n\nAfter becoming the Magister, she was embattled with a succession of Magister hopefuls until her death in {{yearlink|318}}.",
        "History": "An orphan from the [[Vilhon Reach]], she was kept as a slave in a kitchen in [[Calimshan]]. One day, she stole a spellbook from the rich bedchambers of the house, and began to practice magic with it. When the book's theft was discovered, she kept her actions a secret.\n\nWhen [[Azuth]] offered her the office of the Magister, she accepted, as the god had walked through the rest of the house, effectively revealing his business with her and thus putting her life in danger. She was soon after attacked by volleys of mages intent on claiming the mantle of the [[Magister]], and survived despite fumbling many of her spells only because of the covert aid of [[Loaradden Derviir]]; aware of some force helping her, she became emboldened, and began attacking mages before they attacked her. After she had slain most of Loaradden Derviir's rivals, she found herself attacked and soon slain by him.\n\nShe lived on in [[Mystra]]'s service, participating in spellbattles.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Though she was aware that someone aided her, Iolaeden believed it was the goddess Mystra or Azuth that protected her in spell battles.\n\nMystra may have had plans for Iolaeden, kept secret even from her, as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
