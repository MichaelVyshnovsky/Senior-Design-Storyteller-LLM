'''Symgharyl Maruel''', also known as the '''Shadowsil''', was a powerful [[wizard]] affiliated with the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and the [[Zhentarim]] both.

==Description==
She had glossy black hair she kept long, and a lithe and graceful body.{{cite book/Realms of Infamy/So High a Price}}

On the day of her death, in 1357 DR, she was clad in a robe, breeches, boots, and a half-cloak. She remained young and lush, due to the effects of multiple ''[[potion of longevity|potions of longevity]]''.

==Personality==
As a young, she was rebellious, physical, restless, bold, pranksome and free-spirited, somewhat of a tomboy. She became quite confident and promiscuous around her teens. To the eyes of the goddess [[Mystra]], Symgharyl was bound to betray anyone for more power, but she would act in ways that spread magic and develop magic if her selfishness and ruthlessness would be tamped down some.

She becaome a cold-blooded, unhesitant, remorseless killer after swallowing a piece of a particular ''[[shadow crown]]'', going beyond her initial ruthless ambition{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2009)/08-01 - Relationships in the Realms}} In her altered personality, when angered, she was reckless enough to give away a dracolich's treasure. To the end, she loved [[Elminster]], but she spurned his aid when dying, claiming she was too set in her ways to change, showing rare, but intense, shame at what she'd become.

==Abilities==
She had a talent that boosted some of her spells on demand.{{Template:Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2009)/07-10 - The Shadowsil's Power}} Amongst other spells, she had ''meteor swarm'', ''fireball'', and very likely ''hold person''. Other spells of hers included, almost certainly, ''[[fly]]'' and ''[[teleport]]''.

Swallowing a fragment of the ''shadow crown'' had granted ability to see in normal or magical darkness, and the ability to learn any [[Talfirian magic]], including spells such as ''[[shadow walk]]'' or ''[[shadow step]]''.

==Possessions==
She carried an enchanted ''[[ring of protection]]'', a ''[[rope of entanglement]]'', a ''[[wand of fire]]'', and a ''[[ring of dragons]]''.

Elminster had once gifted her a pair of earrings from [[Myth Drannor]], which he had recovered after her death. Those were [[sapphire]] spindles with hanging [[king's tears]].{{cite book/Cloak of Shadows||15}}

She gained a ''shadow crown's'' magical powers by swallowing a fragment of it.

==Relationships==
Symgharyl seduced one by one each of the adventuring mages that were hired to tutor her, moving to the next after learning all she wanted from them. In order, those first tutors were [[Rindyl Haelmoon]], [[Hendrar Vulbrant]], [[Umiir Kashlakh]], and [[Renchessa Hundaerlysk]].

In her time within the [[Cult of the Dragon]] she gained a reputation for danger, ruthlessness and competence; many of her fellow Cultists gave her a wide berth, believing it likely they'd be killed, scapegoated, or sent to their deaths if they worked with her. As a member of the [[Zhentarim]], she was as trusted as anyone else. They knew she was drawn irresistibly to magical power.

[[Elminster Aumar]] had been the only person she held admiration or love for, and that she'd been able to trust, mostly because he'd gently denied her advances throughout their time together.

==History==
Symgharyl Maruel was born in {{yearlink|1273}}, in [[Mharartel]], a minor barony of [[Chessenta]] that would disappear by the turn of the 16{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was consecrated to [[Lathander]], her mother's patron deity, upon birth; the altar spoke her truename. In her early teens, her family moved to [[Zhentil Keep]], where they opened a metal casting business. By her twentieth birthday, her parents were quite wealthy, and paid for her tutoring in [[the Art]], the only thing that appeared to make Symgharyl happy. They paid for tutors, so as to avoid the [[Zhentarim]].

Symgharyl then became part of an adventuring party, or arguably a group of brigands that robbed caravans, mining camps, and ambushed or trapped local lawswords sent after them. Shortly after, she became part of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], and spent some time in the Cult's employ within the [[Western Heartlands]], ranging from [[Chessenta]] and [[Impiltur]], to [[Tethyr]], and the [[Sword Coast]] north of these locations. Through that time, she established a number of hideaways where she stashed away [[enchanted]] treasures, practiced her art, and laid low when she'd attracted unwanted attention. During that time, she came across writings from which she devised a ''potion of longevity'' recipe; she drank three.

Her activities also brought her to the attention of the [[Zhentarim]]; after slaying six magelings sent after her, she was farscried by Manshoon personally. He met with her, and recruited Symgharyl, who became his apprentice and thus an influential member of the Black Network. She managed to convince powerful members that she was infiltrating the Zhentarim, but as a member of the Black Network, she brought many Cult members into alliances with some Zhentarim.

She named herself the Shadowsil after swallowing a fragment of a magical crown made by [[Mhurrla Havvalik]], which she found in a tomb carved into the side of the gorge of the River [[Thent]], halfway to Lake [[Lake Thentar]] from Thentia. Swallowing the crown had other personality-altering effects. With that name, she started going to [[magefair]]s, though by that time, she was already well-known by name in the Western Heartlands.

She sought out Elminster Aumar for a teacher, after praying at [[Lissa's Rest]]{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|3}} Elminster was contacted by the [[Srinshee]], telling him Mystra bade him accept the Shadowsil as his student, but not lose himself to her love, albeit she was going to betray him in the end. Elminster scried on the Shadowsil as she approached him, but she still managed to surprise him, lost as he was in conversation with the Srinshee, when she opened his door. He managed to surprise her by speaking her true name.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|140|8}} She convinced Manshoon that she was doing this to better spy on the man through the process.

Later, she turned to evil and killed at least one of her lovers telekinetically, with a sword.{{cite book/Realms of Magic/The Eye of the Dragon}} She also came to work for [[Manshoon]], who found her knowledge of Elminster rather tempting;{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2008)/07-23 - The Knights of Myth Drannor}} becoming the lover of the Zhentarim leader also granted her a much higher effective rank than her official one.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/02-06 - Women in the Zhentarim}} While serving him, she was also the lover of Lord [[Chess]] for at least one night in Spring of {{yearlink|1334}}; he knew her to be one of Manshoon's wizards, and related it to his friend [[Eldarr]].

Per her recollection, as one of her first duties in the cult, she'd brought [[Aghazstamn]] treasure fourteen winters prior to 1357 DR, likely around {{yearlink|1343}}.

In {{yearlink|1357}}, she was fighting a mage in red robes at [[Myth Drannor]], when [[Shandril Shessair]] came across the site of their battle. The mage struck with a ''[[cone of cold]]'', to which Symgharyl responded with a ''[[meteor swarm]]'', slaying him. Afterwards, she captured the young woman with a spell akin to ''[[hold person]]'' and her own enchanted ''rope'', expecting to use her as a gift for [[Rauglothgor]], or for her blood if she was a virgin. Though [[Narm]] struck her with a ''[[magic missile]]'' along the way to the dracolich, she swiftly disabled him with a ''[[fireball]]''. Afterwards, she took Shandril to a ruined keep, on [[Mirtul 20]].

Beneath the ruined keep, in the lair of Rauglothgor, she interrogated Shandril, confirming she wasn't actually [[Alusair Obarskyr]]. However, during the interrogation, they were ambushed by the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] and Narm. She pursued Narm and Shandril; before she could slay the first, she was nearly brained from behind by the lass.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|102-103|6}}

When she woke up, she reached for her cache, where she drank a ''[[potion of healing]]'', and then headed to request [[Aghazstamn]]'s aid in attacking the Knights and the lass.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|125-130|7}} Shortly afterwards, she was killed by [[Elminster]] together with her [[dracolich]] mount [[Aghazstamn]] when she tried to slay the group, through a reflected ''meteor swarm''.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|135-136|8}} Though she still loved Elminster, she spurned his aid when he offered to heal her in her last moments,{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|139|8}} on [[Mirtul 21]].

===Aftermath===
Symgharyl Maruel's death spurred [[Manshoon]] into personal action, making him head straight to the Knights of Myth Drannor with intent to kill.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|143|8}}

After her death, one of her king's tear earrings held her smiling likeness since.
