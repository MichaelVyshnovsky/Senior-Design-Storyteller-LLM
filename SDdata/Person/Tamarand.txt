'''Tamarand''' was a [[gold dragon|gold]] great wyrm{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|79}}

==Personality==
Tamarand was thoughtful yet decisive. He was very wise, and was one of the few dragons who was knowledgeable about the customs of [[human]]s and [[demihuman]]s. He was also one of the few gold dragons that was relatively friendly to non-dragons, although he disliked being visited in his lair.

==Activities==
Tamarand was the King of Justice, Other gold dragons would consult with him before any major undertaking to be certain that their course of action was wise.

Before the 15th century DR, Tamarand had a lair in a huge cave complex beneath the mountains near [[Bloodstone Pass]]. who were in good terms with the gold dragon.

==Relationships==
He was a recurrent ally of the [[Talons of Justice]]. He and his followers opposed the [[Warlock Knights]] of Vaasa. When the [[giant]] kingdom of [[Kultaakarr]] arose in the late 15{{th}} century DR, he shifted his attention to oppose them,

Before he became the King of Justice, Tamarand served as the second-in-command to the former king, the gold dragon [[Lareth]], who considered him his brother.

==History==
At some point prior to [[1357 DR]], a large group of dragon hunters from Vaasa tried to kill Tamarand in his lair. However, Tamarand had learned about the attack beforehand and called other four gold dragons for help, and the Vaasan hunters were almost all killed in the ensuing battle.

On [[Flamerule 8]] of the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], Tamarand reluctantly challenged Lareth for leadership of all goodly dragons after Lareth's reasoning and judgment had been corrupted by the [[Dracorage]]. Lareth, teetering on the edge of madness as a result of the [[Rage of Dragons|Rage]], eagerly accepted, wrongly suspecting Tamarand was about to betray him. At first Tamarand tried to subdue Lareth, using only [[spell]]s to disable him, but finally Tamarand was forced to deliver a fatal blow. As required by the protocols of the ''[[Bahamut#Dogma|Ptarian Code]]'', the gold dragon [[Larendrammagar]] and the [[silver dragon]] [[Havarlan]] bore witness to the battle. Tamarand was greatly grieved from killing his superior and brother, and initially did not accept the mantle of royalty.

Almost immediately after slaying Lareth, Tamarand was forced to fly to the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]], and lead a group of [[metallic dragon]]s in lifting the siege of the monastery from a flight of [[chromatic dragon]]s sent by [[Sammaster]].

After the last Dracorage, he and Larendrammagar helped the Talons of Justice in some of their missions. Their last mission was to help the Talons locate a former member of the order who had become a rebel, the dragon [[Arendelonthos]].

By the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Tamarand had finally became the King of Justice, and a Chosen of Bahamut as well. That year he led his followers to stand in opposition against the Warlock Knights of Vaasa and the titans of Kultaakarr.
