        "mainbody": "ondar Bleth was the owner of a small farmstead about a mile from Suzail, which he and his family had settled shortly after Ondeth Obarskyr settled in the area. He was killed along with most of his family by elves in 16 DR and his farmstead was razed. Mondar wielded a large heavy-hafted sword that would later become known as Ansrivarr.\nMondar was a very large man with an aggressive temper. He was balding by 16 DR but had a very long beard, almost to his belt. He had deep lines on his forehead.\nMinda Obarskyr, originally Minda Bleth, was Mondars sister, and Mondar had a son, Arphoind Bleth. Mondars wife died while giving birth to their son.\nMondar came to the land that would become known as Suzail in 10 DR, but did not want to settle in the confines of the main village, instead choosing a glade a mile to the northwest, although Ondeth disagreed with this decision. He and Ondeth eventually became good friends, but he did not like Baerauble Etharr. \nIn 16 DR, during the night, the elves burned his farmstead to the ground and killed all of its occupants. In an effort to keep the peace between the humans and the elves, the massacre was blamed on a goblin raid. Minda and Arphoind Bleth survived the attack because they were not home at the time."
