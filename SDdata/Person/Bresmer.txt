Bresmer was a seneschal of Langalos during the midâ€“8 century DR.
He murmured more than he talked.
The man was carefully expressionless.
He served under High Duke Horostos of Langalos.
Bresmer reported to High Duke Horostos after the death of the adventurers of the Frostfire Banner, who had been seeking the Slayer in the Dead Place just west of Starmantle, that one of their horses had been found washed up in the river. He then reported, to the dukes displeasure, that no one in Reth or Westgate was forthcoming to take on the assignment to find the mysterious Slayer. And then, to even more of the dukes displeasure, he reported the Harpers had taken an interest in the matter, and would be reporting to him before the end of the season. He then helped the Duke come to terms with the fact he was in a bad situation and the best he could do was wait.
