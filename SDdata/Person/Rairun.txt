Rairun () was a druid in the interior FaerÃ»n area in 1357 DR.
Rairun wandered the Inner Sea area trying to protect forested land from human activities, working with elves in the Dalelands, with the priests of Chauntea in Voonlar and Sembia, and with druids all around the area. His best idea was to plant trees like farmers planted grain and vegetable crops this idea was used in some Dales and in the north of Sembia.
Rairun had a feud with the satyrs of the area. He had tutored most of the druids of the area.
