        "mainbody": "'''Roond Asmyrk''' was a [[Sunite]] [[priest]] and proprietor of the [[Silvery Sembian Snail]] [[tavern]] in [[Wheloon]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Asmyrk was once a priest of Sune, goddess of love and beauty, but was forced to leave the priesthood after being criticized for his explicitly hedonistic ways and views. He didn't care a bit about this, and Sune still answered his prayers and provided him with spells.\n\nBy [[1358 DR]], he was the proprietor of the Silvery Sembian Snail tavern in Wheloon.\n\nAfter several drunken parties spread from the Snail and into the town and disturbed livestock, Lord [[Sarp Redbeard]] reprimanded Roond Asmyrk. He began to use sobering [[spell]]s on patrons and developed more indoor entertainments.\n\nHe still ran the Silvery Sembian Snail ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Asmyrk spent several years developing spells that could alter the taste and smell of lesser [[wine]]s to create \"shadow wines\" that resembled far more expensive vintages. A connoisseur could purchase both and compare them if they wished. To prevent inebriated patrons and [[prostitute|escorts]] causing trouble outside, Asmyrk also cast [[spell]]s upon them to induce some sobriety.\n\nHe also taught the ways of Sune to several of the tavern's waitresses/escorts."
