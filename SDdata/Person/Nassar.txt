Nassar was a priest of Kossuth, the frontman of the Heart of Bane who utilized flames and pyrotechnics in his shows, and a part of the Bards Guild of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.
By Uktar of the , Nassar found his calling as a devote cleric of Kossuth, the Tyrant Among Fire and the single of a bardic band. His singing was often described as wailing on the pages of the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter broadsheet. Nassar assembled like-minded performers Everett Taber who played drums of panic, Firmal with his illithid bagpipes, Vanduhar Gerenstalt Eisnerâ€Ž and his Illmataran organ of pain, and Havoc Sen Thornclaw with his ax of deafening and destruction. It was Nassars call to pick a controversial name for the band. The Heart of Bane band was named after the infamous relic of the same name. Nassar believed that such a grand name was sure to attract a great number of listeners. In Uktar, the Bards Guild plastered the city with posters that advertised that the Heart of Bane would be making an appearance at a performance aimed at helping the citys morale. Coincidentally, the previous months performance was led by another follower of Kossuth.
Unsurprisingly, the ill-conceived advertisement attracted the attention of a band of tanarri led by a marilith, as the planar beings were attracted to the relics dark magic, plaguing the city at the time. The ensuing slaughter took the lives of a dozen innocents, and the Bards Guild was lit aflame, with the guild being severely damaged. The demonic attack was ended by a Golden Rooster Patrol led by Sir Kirth Sonath-Pann. In the fallout of the performance, Nassar and his band went into hiding, leaving only a spokesperson to proclaim their innocence. The proceedings from the show were never paid to Nassars group as the Bards Guild claimed that the box office was ransacked by a nabassu.
