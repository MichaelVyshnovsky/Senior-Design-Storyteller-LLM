        "mainbody": "Grask was a dusk beast and the companion of Sithierel on the Necreme in the early 1370s DR.\nGrask liked to curl up and lie down in the bow of the Necreme, where its two heads could watch over the boat and those who approached it when docked, and then alert Sithierel.\nGrask loyally served Sithierel as the shadar-kai plied the waters of Shadow Swamp ferrying captives between the Shadow Citadel and the Monastery of the Ebon Dome.\nEventually, in early Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, an adventuring party in service to Mystra likely encountered the pair and defeated Grask and Sithierel."
