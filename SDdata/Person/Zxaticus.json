        "Description": "He had a powerful voice. He wore magnifying [[spectacle]]s on some of his many eyes. His primary eye was purple.",
        "Personality": "Zxaticus was thoughtful and stern. He cared about the monsters who were students in his Academy, and had faith in them.",
        "Abilities": "He had the magical ability to teleport others over distances of more than {{SI|10|mile|k|long=yes}}.",
        "Possessions": "The door to Zxaticus's office had a statue of a [[sphinx]] on either side of it. Inside, he had a carpet with runes on it.",
        "History": "Zxaticus held a meeting in his office with professors [[Cantrip (alchemist)|Cantrip]] and [[Impro Vice]]. They discussed the recent disappearance of a group of older students led by [[goreball]] captain [[Gutrash]], and valedictorian [[Patty]], which had recently disappeared after an excursion from the Academy to strike the nearby [[Horntree Village]]. Although Zxaticus argued that the monsters were likely safe, he confided that he was concerned that the [[adventurer]] [[Allidora Steelstrike]] had encountered them in Horntree Village. This meeting was eavesdropped on by [[Zellidora Stormclash]].\n\nAfter Zellidora and the [[Danger Club]] had rescued Patty, Gutrash, and the townsfolk of Horntree Village from the [[necromancer]] [[Carrion (necromancer)|Carrion]], Zxaticus arrived near [[Bonebreak Gully]] with Cantrip and Impro Vice. He scolded the Danger Club for breaking Academy rules, but was thankful for their heroics. He took the unconscious body of Carrion for questioning, and used [[magic]] to teleport the students back to the Dungeon Academy.\n\nLater, Zxaticus held a meeting with professors [[Iasme Stormclash|Iasme]] and [[Kifin Stormclash]] about students that Carrion had taken through his portal. His plan was to get help from the Danger Club to find the missing students. This meeting was again evesdropped on by Zellidora."
