Lobo Denysse was an unsavory gnomish barbarian mercenary from the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Lobo was a light-skinned strawberry-blonde gnomish woman. She wore hide armor, hid her face behind a red mask, and carried a massive axe.
In the , the opportunistic and immoral mercenary Aradin Beno set out to find the Nightsong for the mage Lorroakan. If the Nightsong, in reality a Sel√ªnite aasimar, was to reach the city of Baldurs Gate, then Beno had a band of mercenaries with questionable morals ready to attack those who sheltered her. Lobo Denysse was among those mercenaries, ready to break into the Elfsong Tavern to kill and kidnap.
