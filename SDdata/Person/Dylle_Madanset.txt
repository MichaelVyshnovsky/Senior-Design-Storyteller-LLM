Dylle Madanset was a human resident of Eveningstar in Cormyr during the mid-1480s DR.
Dylle had brown eyes, shoulder-length blonde hair and a short trimmed beard.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, Dylle wished to abandon Eveningstar and let the drow do as they wished. He got into an argument with his neighbor Dalamene Amataxos over the matter.
