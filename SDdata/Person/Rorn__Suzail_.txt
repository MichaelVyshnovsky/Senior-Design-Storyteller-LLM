'''Rorn''' was a bullyblade for Lord [[Traevyn Illance]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Rorn looked impassible.

==Relationships==
Another bullyblade he worked with was [[Brabras]].

==Activities==
The man was a bullyblade for [[Traevyn Illance]].

==History==
Rorn was one of the bullyblades protecting Traevyn Illance when the latter met with [[Morligul Downdagger]], who had just captured [[Rauligus Helderstone]] (actually [[Mirt]] the Moneylender) for him. Unknown for him, they were being pursued by the fugitive [[wizard]] [[Elminster Aumar]]; Brabras was quickly disabled after the mage conjured a veil of darkness around him, then enspelled him into a deep sleep.

==Rumors & Legends==
Elminster then dumped Rorn's sleeping form in a garderobe atop Downdagger's own. Immediately after, while impersonating Morligul, Elminster claimed that Rorn had gone off to catch a wench who'd laid low Brabras, when Traevyn wondered about why Brabras was down on the floor.
