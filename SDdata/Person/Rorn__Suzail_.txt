Rorn was a bullyblade for Lord Traevyn Illance in the late 15 century DR.
Rorn looked impassible.
Another bullyblade he worked with was Brabras.
The man was a bullyblade for Traevyn Illance.
Rorn was one of the bullyblades protecting Traevyn Illance when the latter met with Morligul Downdagger, who had just captured Rauligus Helderstone (actually Mirt the Moneylender) for him. Unknown for him, they were being pursued by the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar Brabras was quickly disabled after the mage conjured a veil of darkness around him, then enspelled him into a deep sleep.
Elminster then dumped Rorns sleeping form in a garderobe atop Downdaggers own. Immediately after, while impersonating Morligul, Elminster claimed that Rorn had gone off to catch a wench whod laid low Brabras, when Traevyn wondered about why Brabras was down on the floor.
