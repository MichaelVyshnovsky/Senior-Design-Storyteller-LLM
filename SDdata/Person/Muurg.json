        "mainbody": "'''Muurg''' was a [[kobold]] hero of some renown whose short life and career ended sometime before [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "Muurg's heroic career remained largely unrecorded. He was known for briefly possessing the unique set of [[enchanted]] [[chainmail]], the ''[[Zeal's Walk]]''. The armor was created by a witch coven, the ''[[Newt's Brood]]'' for their lover, who tossed the item when he married an [[elf|elven]] lass. Muurg briefly owned the ''Zeal's Walk'' but lost it in death, possibly somewhere in the [[Lonely Barrens]], where the armor was hidden under a rock in 1372 DR."
