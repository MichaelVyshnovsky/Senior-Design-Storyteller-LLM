'''Xoraulkyr''' was a [[beholder]] in [[Waterdeep]].

==Personality==
The beholder believed himself above all other minds until [[Elminster]] defeated and froze Xoraulkyr in a Waterdeep prison.

==History==
In [[1487 DR]], Elminster summoned it to [[Myth Drannor]] in order to create chaos among the [[Sembia]]n mercenaries and then bound Xoraulkyr to that city.
