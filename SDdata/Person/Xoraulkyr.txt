Xoraulkyr was a beholder in Waterdeep.
The beholder believed himself above all other minds until Elminster defeated and froze Xoraulkyr in a Waterdeep prison.
In 1487 DR, Elminster summoned it to Myth Drannor in order to create chaos among the Sembian mercenaries and then bound Xoraulkyr to that city.
