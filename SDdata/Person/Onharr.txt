'''Onharr the Scalebright''' was the [[enchanter]] owner of a famed lavish festhall [[Serpentspires]] in the pre-[[Weeping War]] [[Myth Drannor]].

==Possessions==
Serpentspires held Onharr's livelihood and his passion, most were reduced to rubble or buried deep in the cellars of the half-destroyed festhall.

==History==
Onharr the Scalebright was a renowned [[wizard]] and enchanter from Myth Drannor who was told to have [[silver dragon]] blood running through his veins. 

In [[714 DR]], during the last days of the Weeping War, the [[Army of Darkness]] broke through the city's barriers and swarmed over [[Cormanthyr]]. Onharr decided to stay and defend his Serpentspires. A powerful [[mezzoloth]] [[Yekschanivosk]], the Bearer of a Hundred Screaming Skulls, faced off against Onharr the Scalebright, blasting the festhall open in the spell-slinging duel. It was believed that both Onharr and Yekschanivosk perished in the battle, even though there were theories that the mezzoloth was not banished, but instead trapped within a gemstone lost somewhere in the ruins of Serpentspires.
