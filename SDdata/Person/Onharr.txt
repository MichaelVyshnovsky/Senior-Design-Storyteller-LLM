Onharr the Scalebright was the enchanter owner of a famed lavish festhall Serpentspires in the pre-Weeping War Myth Drannor.
Serpentspires held Onharrs livelihood and his passion, most were reduced to rubble or buried deep in the cellars of the half-destroyed festhall.
Onharr the Scalebright was a renowned wizard and enchanter from Myth Drannor who was told to have silver dragon blood running through his veins. 
In 714 DR, during the last days of the Weeping War, the Army of Darkness broke through the citys barriers and swarmed over Cormanthyr. Onharr decided to stay and defend his Serpentspires. A powerful mezzoloth Yekschanivosk, the Bearer of a Hundred Screaming Skulls, faced off against Onharr the Scalebright, blasting the festhall open in the spell-slinging duel. It was believed that both Onharr and Yekschanivosk perished in the battle, even though there were theories that the mezzoloth was not banished, but instead trapped within a gemstone lost somewhere in the ruins of Serpentspires.
