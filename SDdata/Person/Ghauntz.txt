'''Ghauntz'''<ref group="note">In [[Lands of Intrigue (boxed set)|Lands of Intrigue:Erlkazar & Folks of Intrigue]], Ghauntz is referred to as "Ghantuz"., also known as '''Ghauntz the Cloaked''', was a [[cleric]] of [[Gargauth]] who went on to become the vice chairman of the [[Knights of the Shield]]. 

==Description==
Ghauntz was an old man with a scarred face who always dressed in black with a cape.

==History==
In adulthood, Ghauntz was a worshiper and a cleric of Gargauth, and it was under the guidance and influence of his god that he rose to the upper echelons of the Knights of the Shield.

Most of his peers considered him to be only a crafty old [[Keczulla]]n merchant who earned his riches with early investments in [[Maztica]]n businesses.. But his true mission was to assist [[Inselm Hhune]] in understanding the wishes of Gargauth and take control the organization. He also proselytized to the rest of the Shield Council and slowly converted the whole order to the worship of the Hidden Lord.
