        "mainbody": "'''Hexxat''' was a [[vampire]] from [[Mezro]] who worked as an agent for a powerful and mysterious individual.\n\n{{Quote|''\"Ah, yes. Civilization. I can work with this.\"''|Hexxat}}",
        "Personality": "Carrying herself with a certain manner grace, Hexxat was cordial and respectful of others, even when they did not show her the same courtesy.\n\nMore than anything else, Hexxat saw herself as someone who merely survived in the world regardless of the actions she took.",
        "History": "Hexxat was born in Mezro during the 12{{th}} century [[DR]], to a [[Mazewalker]] of [[Ubtao]]. She was however raised not by her mother, but several of her aunts. \n\nAlong with another agent [[Phreya]], Hexxat came to be employed by an individual known as [[Larloch|L]]. He tasked her with recovering three [[artifact]]s from across the Realms: The ''[[Casque of Imprisonment]]'' located in a tomb within the city of [[Athkatla]] in [[Faer√ªn]]; the ''[[Claw of the Black Leopard]]'' found in the [[crypt of Durkon]] in [[Kara-Tur]]; and the ''[[Shroud of the Unproved]]'' within its [[Tomb of the Unproved|resting place]] in [[Zakhara]]. \n\nHexxat traveled to Athkatla first and slipped into the catacombs beneath the city's [[Athkatla/Grave District|Grave District]]. She found the resting place of the reviled vampire warlord, [[Dragomir|Dragomir the Red]]. When Hexxat removed the casque from Dragomir's head the ancient vampire rose up, free from the magical binds that immobilized his body. Dragomir rose up turned Hexxat into a vampire.<ref group=\"note\">Although this is not explicitly stated, both L and [[Cabrina]] were acquainted with Hexxat ''before'' her transformation into a vampire. He imprisoned her within a nearby stone coffin, where she would languish for over two hundred years.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Hexxat was ''[[Dominate person|mentally dominating]]'' young women in the city in effort to attract a group that may free her from within the tomb. She began referring to herself as 'The Sleeper' through the voices of the women she enthralled.\n\nLater that year she appeared in the village of [[Amkethran]] in [[Calimshan]], ready to perform the final task for her patron L. In exchange for her humanity, Hexxat would hunt down the [[lich]] [[Korkorran]], who once served her master."
