Harnak the Butcher was a powerful hobgoblin warrior of the the Red Fang Marauders in the Trollbark Forest in the late 14 century DR.
In the late 14 century DR, the Red Fang Marauders targeted the environs of Baldurs Gate, striking at traveling caravans from a base that was well hidden and one of its lairs in the caverns of the Trollbark Forest. The goblin raiders attacked Randalla Brasshorns caravan that traveled from Waterdeep to the Gate, capturing and dragging several caravaners, including Randalla, to the cavern depth. Caravaners who survived rushed to the village of Wayfork, not realizing that it was also under attack by the marauders led by Harnak the Butcher. The hobgoblin broke into the Wayfork Inn where the raid survivors found shelter. Harnaks butchery came to an end when a group of six heroes confronted the marauders at the inn and slew him.
