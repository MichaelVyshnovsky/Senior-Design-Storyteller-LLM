Rassiter was also involved in fighting with the Companions of the Hall during this time. In the end, the wererats were exterminated by Astral Plane panthers and Pook was killed, so Rassiter tried to ally with Entreri to become the rulers of the streets of Calimport, but the assassin said that he worked alone and easily killed him."
