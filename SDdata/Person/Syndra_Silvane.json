        "History": "Syndra was an adventurer in her youth. At some point, she died and was raised from the dead, at which point she quit her adventuring career. She eventually became a merchant.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century, she became afflicted with the [[death curse]] and began to slowly die. After [[cleric]]s were unable to help her, she contacted the [[Harpers]], who indicated to her that the cause of the death curse was a [[necromantic]] [[artifact]] called the [[Soulmonger]] located in [[Chult]].\n\nAfter learning this news, Syndra gathered information about Chult and inscribed it upon a map. She began hiring teams of adventurers to travel into the jungles of Chult. Several of these teams subsequently disappeared into the jungle and fell victim to its perils.",
        "Description": "After becoming affected by the [[death curse]], Syndra began wearing a hood and silver mask to hide her features.",
        "Relationships": "Syndra Silvane was friends with [[Wakanga O'tamu]], one of the merchant princes of [[Port Nyanzaru]]."
