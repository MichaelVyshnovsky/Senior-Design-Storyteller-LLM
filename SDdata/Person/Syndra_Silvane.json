At some point, she died and was raised from the dead, at which point she quit her adventuring career. She eventually became a merchant.\nIn the late 15 century, she became afflicted with the death curse and began to slowly die. After clerics were unable to help her, she contacted the Harpers, who indicated to her that the cause of the death curse was a necromantic artifact called the Soulmonger located in Chult.\nAfter learning this news, Syndra gathered information about Chult and inscribed it upon a map. She began hiring teams of adventurers to travel into the jungles of Chult. Several of these teams subsequently disappeared into the jungle and fell victim to its perils.\nAfter becoming affected by the death curse, Syndra began wearing a hood and silver mask to hide her features.\nSyndra Silvane was friends with Wakanga Otamu, one of the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru."
