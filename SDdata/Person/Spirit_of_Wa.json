        "History": "When the island of [[Tsukishima]] was established by the Spirit of Wa, two sisters named the [[Bloom Lady]] and the [[Rock Lady]] competed for the hand of [[Ninigi]], the August Grandchild.\n\nThe Spirit of Wa once banished the \"[[devil]]s\" who used to wander the mainland to the [[Isle of Devils]], located off the coast near [[Aru]], where each was trapped unless a [[human]] voluntarily agreed to take its place.\n\nThe Spirit of Wa was the one who gave the fabled [[Moonlight Arrow]] and the [[Sacred Wand]] to [[Kochi]], Master of the Peach Tree, making him the first emperor of Wa."
