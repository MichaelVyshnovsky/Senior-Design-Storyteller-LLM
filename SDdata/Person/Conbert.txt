Conbert was a Red Plumes mercenary in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Conbert was one of the soldiers assigned to the garrison in the Waydown.
Conbert always dreamed of becoming a performer but in order to earn a living he joined the Red Plumes.
Circa 1486 DR, Conbert was fascinated by Felrathas new performers (secretly an adventuring party in disguise). Conbert showed great interest in Felrathas minstrel profession, wanting to know everything about it. When he spoke to her it was very rapid, his voice growing high pitched in his excitement.
