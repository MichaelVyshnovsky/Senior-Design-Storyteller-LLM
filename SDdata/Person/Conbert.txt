'''Conbert''' was a [[Red Plumes]] [[mercenary]] in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Waydown|10}}

==Activities==
Conbert was one of the soldiers assigned to the garrison in the [[Waydown]].

==History==
Conbert always dreamed of becoming a performer but in order to earn a living he joined the Red Plumes.

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Conbert was fascinated by [[Felratha]]'s new performers (secretly an adventuring party in disguise). Conbert showed great interest in Felratha's [[minstrel]] profession, wanting to know everything about it. When he spoke to her it was very rapid, his voice growing high pitched in his excitement.{{Cite adventurers league/The Waydown|17}}
