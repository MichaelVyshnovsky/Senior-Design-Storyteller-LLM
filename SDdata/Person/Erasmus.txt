Erasmus was a half-elf mage and slave of Baeloth Barrityl.
Erasmus was a minor mage, and she was only able to cast the most basic spells, such as magic missile and sleep. She also fought with a quarterstaff, as well as a sling and bullets.
Erasmus and her party were taken from a "shabby saloon" to the Black Pits. They were killed by the Champion of Baeloths Pits and their party in the Black Pits arena.
