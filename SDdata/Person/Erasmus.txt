'''Erasmus''' was a [[half-elf]] [[mage]] and [[slave]] of [[Baeloth Barrityl]].

==Description==
Erasmus was a minor mage, and she was only able to cast the most basic spells, such as ''[[magic missile]]'' and ''[[sleep]]''. She also fought with a [[quarterstaff]], as well as a [[sling]] and [[bullet]]s.

==History==
Erasmus and her party were taken from a "shabby saloon" to the [[Black Pits]]. They were killed by the [[Champion of Baeloth's Pits]] and their party in the Black Pits arena.
