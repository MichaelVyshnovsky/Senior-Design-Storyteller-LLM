He tended to be very enthusiastic and obsessive with past times, whatever they were. One of his interests was investigating the plague that hit Neverwinter. He claimed to first and foremost be a sorcerer, despite his investigatory tendencies as well.\nHis adventures resulted in his search and acquisition of a leavened bread recipe, found in Sirils Bakery within the Beggars Nest district of Neverwinter. Similarly, he discovered a prism blossom seed along the East Road and some dragon scale in Moonwood.\nHe was born in Lantan and apprenticed under a sorcerer called Prophyro. Boddyknocks explorations resulted in his stay in Neverwinter when the Wailing Death hit in the . He could be found in the Trade of Blades, where many aspiring henchman tried to find work.
