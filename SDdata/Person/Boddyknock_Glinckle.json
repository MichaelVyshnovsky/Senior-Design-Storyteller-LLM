        "mainbody": "'''Boddyknock Glinckle''' was a [[gnome]] [[sorcerer]] from [[Lantan]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who was present in [[Neverwinter]] during the [[Wailing Death]] and may have been an associate of the [[Hero of Neverwinter]].",
        "Abilities": "Boddyknock was skilled in [[arcane]] [[magic]] but also used a crossbow and dagger when needed.",
        "Personality": "He was said to be a very serious-looking gnome, often deep in thought and concentrating on the world around him.\n\nSimilar to other born-and-bred Lantanese gnomes, Boddyknock was deeply interested in science and applied a logical outlook to his lifestyle and work, despite being skilled in magic and not an inventor like many Lantanese natives were. He tended to be very enthusiastic and obsessive with past times, whatever they were. One of his interests was investigating the plague that hit Neverwinter. He claimed to first and foremost be a sorcerer, despite his investigatory tendencies as well.",
        "Possessions": "His adventures resulted in his search and acquisition of a leavened [[bread]] recipe, found in [[Siril's Bakery]] within the [[Beggar's Nest]] district of Neverwinter. Similarly, he discovered a [[prism blossom]] seed along the East Road and some [[dragon]] scale in [[Moonwood]].",
        "History": "He was born in Lantan and apprenticed under a sorcerer called [[Prophyro]]. Boddyknock's explorations resulted in his stay in Neverwinter when the Wailing Death hit in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. He could be found in the [[Trade of Blades]], where many aspiring henchman tried to find work. Boddyknock took a deep interest in a cure for the plague and looked to Beggar's Nest, its recent [[zombie]] problems, and the potential link and solution. However, it became too dangerous on his own to continue his investigation. He had the option to work alongside the Hero of Neverwinter in order to save the people from the plague and further cult plots."
