'''Roq Silent Hunter''' was a river-dwelling [[caiman katanga]] [[hunter]] from the jungles of the [[Malatran Plateau]] active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Roq was not particularly smart and the only topic he showed interest in was hunting.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Tribe of the Wise Ones]] became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded [[spider katanga]], the [[Mother of a Thousand Young]], was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly [[poison]]s into the rivers cascading off the [[Fire Mountain]]. Roq was among the younger and less-experienced heroes of the Living Jungle who answered the call. Silent Hunter's group was sent to enter the spider katanga caverns and faced [[hunting spider katanga]]s who guarded previously captured adventurers.

It was unknown if Roq survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the [[Village of the Wise Ones]] for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and nature's healing.
