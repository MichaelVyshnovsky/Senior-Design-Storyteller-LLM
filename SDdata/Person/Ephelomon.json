        "History": "In ancient times, after the [[Gith (race)|giths]]' uprising against the [[Mind flayer|illithids]] and the [[Gith (race)#Civil War and Separation|schism between the giths]], [[Gith|Mother Gith]] sought out potential allies to secure her race's future and advance the [[Eternal Crusade]]. Gith's advisor [[Vlaakith I|Vlaakith]] proposed the goddess Tiamat an agreement, details of which remained a secret. To conclude the agreement Mother Gith went to the [[Nine Hells]] herself and never returned.{{Cite dungeon/168/A Tyranny of Souls|93}}{{Cite polyhedron/159/Incursion: Knights of the Lich-Queen|32}}\n\nEphelomon stayed with Vlaakith I and became her consort. The [[duthka'gith]], who were half-githyanki [[warrior]]s, claimed to be descended from Ephelomon. Some tales of their birth suggested that Vlaakith employed Ephelomon's bloodline to fashion them as preeminent warriors, surpassing the majority of the githyanki.{{Cite polyhedron/159/Incursion: Knights of the Lich-Queen|10}}\n\nAfter the end of the [[War of the Comet]], a story detailing Prince [[Orpheus]]'s demise was relayed to the githyanki people. It was said that Orpheus had been killed by Kith'rak [[Voss]] and Ephelomon had devoured the remains of the prince's body. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, however, the [[True Soul]] heroes discovered that the prince remained among the living, and this narrative was revealed to be one of Vlaakith I's and her descendants' schemes.\n\nAfter Ephelomon's death one of his horns was used to create the [[Draakhorn]]."
