'''Obratu''' was an [[oni mage]] at the [[Shrine of the Tender Oath]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Relationship==
Obratu had a partnership of convenience with a [[duergar]] called [[Reulek]].

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Obratu and [[Reulek]] decided to recover the treasures of [[Besilmer]]. They found a map showing two entrances to King [[Torhild Flametongue]]'s tomb. Reulek decided to go to the tomb using tunnels near the [[Fane of the Eye]] and was never seen again. Obratu searched for the entrance near the Shrine of the Tender Oath. He hired renegade [[dwarves]] led by [[Grumink]]. Together, they killed the clerics of the shrine and occupied the building, searching for the entrance to the tomb.

At last, some adventurers came to investigate the shrine and defeated Obratu and Grumink.
