Obratu was an oni mage at the Shrine of the Tender Oath in the Dessarin Valley during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Obratu had a partnership of convenience with a duergar called Reulek.
In 1491 DR, Obratu and Reulek decided to recover the treasures of Besilmer. They found a map showing two entrances to King Torhild Flametongues tomb. Reulek decided to go to the tomb using tunnels near the Fane of the Eye and was never seen again. Obratu searched for the entrance near the Shrine of the Tender Oath. He hired renegade dwarves led by Grumink. Together, they killed the clerics of the shrine and occupied the building, searching for the entrance to the tomb.
At last, some adventurers came to investigate the shrine and defeated Obratu and Grumink.
