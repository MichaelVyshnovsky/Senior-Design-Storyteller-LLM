'''Shraevyn''' was a [[magelord (title)|magelord]], and [[magic]]al weaponsmith from the [[Dalelands]] in 10th century [[DR]]. He left a legacy on the art of weapon crafting and magic as a whole as both author and practitioner. He left many of his secrets in [[Shraevyn's Tomb|crypt]] in which he was interred, as well as his ''magnum opus'' the famous [[Sword of the Dales]].` 

==Personality==
Shraevyn was known for being a wise and just man.

As a weapons-mage, Shraevyn crafted the finest arms for many brave and noble [[warrior]]s, [[fighter]]s and knights throughout his years. He had an immense respect for these men and women. However, he hated [[thieves]] and believed their secretive lifestyle was ignoble and beneath work of the [[weave]].

With regard to magic, he was not a fan of [[necromancy]] and felt to serve as an [[undead]] creature was an abhorrent fate.

Shraevyn met many adventurers in his time, and believed one thing above all others when it came to that life: only groups that stuck together could survive. Aside from cooperation and untiy, he highly valued when people demonstrated their intelligence and cleverness. He believed that greed, a sin that was presented daily and satisfied in countless ways, was one of a persons greatest potential enemies.

===Faith===
Shraevyn was a follower of the faith of [[Tymora]] and felt her to be most helpful during his adventuring days.

===Relationships===
Throughout his life, Shraevyn had a number of apprentices. His most trusted was a wizard named [[Karten]], to whom Shraevyn left nearly all his treasure before he died. Since the weapon-mage died, Karten traveled to city of [[Sigil]], located in the center of the [[multiverse]].

==History== 
In his travels, Shraevyn traveled to the [[Astral Plane]] and met an [[elven]] wizard, whose name and life story he never learned. She educated him a great deal about [[the Art]], sharing with him information and insight that would have taken him years to gather on his own. 

Sometime during his travels, back on [[Toril]], he discovered the [[bastard sword]] [[Giventhar]], a blade that originated from the [[Githyanki]] in the Astral Plane. He hid it from the Gith forever and knowledge about its whereabouts was mere speculation.

Shortly before his death, Shraevyn crafted a powerful blade known as the [[Sword of the Dales]] and hid it within his casket in the last chamber within his [[Shraevyn's Tomb|tomb]].

==Works==
Shraevyn possessed a vast knowledge about magical crafting and [[enchantment]], having written several books on the subject.
