'''Rylla''' was the [[Half-drow]] battlemistress of the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]].

==History==
Rylla was the main military leader of the [[Church of Eilistraee]].

In [[1379 DR]], she summoned the [[Darksong Knight]] [[Cavatina Xarann]] for a meeting. Rylla was the first that Cavatina alerted when she discovered that the cook [[Meryl]] had been replaced by a [[dretch]]. Rylla led the Protectors to attempt to catch the infiltrator. 

Later Rylla discovered that Qilué had killed the druid [[Horaldin]] tried to stop her Lady believing her in thrall of [[Wendonai]]. However Qilué scaring that she would ruin her plot to kill [[Lolth]] was forced to kill also Rylla.
