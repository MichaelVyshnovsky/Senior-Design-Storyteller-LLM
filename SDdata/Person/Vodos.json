        "History": "Vodos was a very ancient triton born possibly in {{Yearlink|-11000}}. He was old at the time of the rise of [[Aryselmalyr]]. A devout priest of [[Persana]], under his god's inspiration, he erected the early garrisons of the [[Sharksteeth Mounts]] and planned and possibly built the Sharksbane Wall.\n\nVodos's death was surrounded by mystery. In {{Yearlink|-10400}}, when very old, he went into the [[Trench of Lopok]] and nobody saw him again. Many believed he had chosen Lopok as his resting place but this was only speculation."
