Spirali was a Maztican drow. He was one of the Ancient Ones.
In 1361 DR, a prophecy indicated that a young girl, Erixitl, would be the doom of the Ancient Ones. So Spirali was sent to find and kill her, while leading a pack of hell hounds.
At last, he found her in Payit but before Spirali could kill her, the drow and his hell hounds were killed by Halloran of the Golden Legion and the Eagle Knight Poshtli.
