Both of them were close with a Black Fist guardsman named Grim.\nDuring the 1480s DR, various problems began to arise in Phlan and tensions arose between the Black Fist and the local dockworkers that worked out of Sokol Keep. The situation reached a boiling point just after the beacon over the keep went out and numerous guardsmen, including Grim, went missing.\nOne night Keria and her friend Aravele went out for drinks at the Laughing Goblin Inn. The two got into a heated argument with a group of local dockworkers that obviously came to the inn looking to start a fight."
