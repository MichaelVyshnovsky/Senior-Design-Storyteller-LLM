        "mainbody": "Deslima, nicknamed Sneaker, was a shu warrior of the Jengi tribe who lived on the Malatran Plateau on the shores of the Lake of Giant Flies in the late 14 century DR.\nLike other shu of the Jengi village, Deslima was shy and wary of visitors from other tribes. She was a small, heavily tattooed individual.\nDeslima was armed with a blowgun with its darts dipped in berry-juice-derived poison.\nIn the Year of Gathering Darkness, Malatran calendar, sinister earth tremors shook the Living Jungle. The shu Jengi tribe was hit hard by the disaster. The tribes witch doctor, Kumon Ubok, was badly hurt, and a collection of his spell fetishes unleaded waves of wild magic. Deslima was among five warriors of the tribe who protected the witch doctor and the Tribal Elder Futori in the chaos that consumed the village. When a band of heroes of the Living Jungle arrived at the Jengi village, Deslima and her peers were sent by Futori to make sure the visitors were not hurt and to escort them to their destination."
