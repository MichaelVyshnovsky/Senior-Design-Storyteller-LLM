'''Alyssa''' was a high [[priestess]] of [[Umberlee]] who oversaw the [[Temple of Umberlee (Bezantur)|Temple of Umberlee]] in the [[Thayan]] city of [[Bezantur]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She was dedicated to the greater glory of her [[goddess]], but was also known to enrich herself in the process of collecting Umberlee's tribute.

==Activities==
Alyssa oversaw the more than one hundred priests, priestesses, and acolytes of Umberlee who staffed the temple, and presided over the temple's practice of recruiting thugs to steal treasure from ships in port in order to pay tribute to her goddess and to enrich the staff themselves. She was known to use temple funds to host lavish parties each [[tenday]] which attracted the upper echelons of Bezantur society, even including [[Zulkir]] [[Aznar Thrul]] and his retinue. The fact that Umberlee allowed this was seen as a sign of the goddess's generosity toward Alyssa.
