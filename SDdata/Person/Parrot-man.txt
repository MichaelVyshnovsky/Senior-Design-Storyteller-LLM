The parrot-man was a legendary creature in South Saishu, an island of Koryo in Kara-Tur.
The parrot-man was one of the local legends that Dan Zor, the former king and governor of Saishu, wished to investigate. By 1357 DR, he sought adventurers who would seek out the parrot-man of South Saishu for him.
