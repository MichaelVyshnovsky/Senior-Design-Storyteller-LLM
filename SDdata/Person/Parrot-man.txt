The '''parrot-man''' was a legendary creature in South [[Saishu]], an island of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]].

The parrot-man was one of the local legends that [[Dan Zor]], the former king and governor of Saishu, wished to investigate. By [[1357 DR]], he sought adventurers who would seek out the parrot-man of South Saishu for him.
