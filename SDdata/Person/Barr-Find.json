        "mainbody": "Barr-Find was a half-orc bard and proxy of the Celtic power known as Manannan Mac Lir.\nBarr-Find had an incredibly ugly appearance.\nDespite his appearance, Barr-Find had a remarkable singing voice that made even the Faer√ªnian power Oghma feel a twinge of jealousy. He could also summon aquatic creatures to his aid and shatter weapons raised against him just by plucking on the strings of his harp.\nRumors around the Outer Planes claimed that Oghma wanted to lure Barr-Find away from being the proxy of mac Lir."
