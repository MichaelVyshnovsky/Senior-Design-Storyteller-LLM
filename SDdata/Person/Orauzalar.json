        "Activities": "While [[Red Wizard]] activities were tolerated throughout the realm by [[Sambryl|Queen-regent Sambryl]] and the [[Lords of Imphras II]], they were secretly opposed by Orauzalar. \n\nHe openly criticized the council as they allowed the formation of [[Thay]]an [[Thayan enclave|enclave]]s in the cities of [[Dilpur]], [[Ilmwatch]] and [[Lyrabar]]. He believed that the council acquiesced to the demands of the cities' merchants and filled their own personal coffers in the process."
