'''Kylie''' was a [[lightfoot halfling]] [[rogue]] of the adventuring company - the [[Lady's Lament]] from [[Waterdeep]], active ''circa'' [[1310 DR]].

==Description==
Kylie was a cheerful halfling who used [[dagger]]s and [[shortbow]] in battle.

==History==
Several years before the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, Kylie joined the Lady's Lament and quickly befriended his comrades. The halfling wanted to put a smile on the faces of his new friends via jokes and pranks. He understood well that "misery likes company."

In 1310 DR, the Lady's Lament, along with many other mercenaries, traveled from [[Luskan]] to the besieged city of [[Targos]] in the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].
