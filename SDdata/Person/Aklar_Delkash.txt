'''Aklar Delkash''' was a [[human]] man and [[merchant]] operating in [[the Vast]] in the late 1360s [[DR]].

==History==
Aklar was a trader in quality [[fur]]s and woven [[rug]]s. He planned to sell these in the [[city]] of [[Procampur]], and stopped at the [[hamlet]] of [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]] on the way. There he stayed at the [[The Worried Wyvern]] [[inn]].

On the 2nd [[Eleint]] in [[1369 DR|the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], Aklar learned that a local well had been contaminated with a [[magic]]-resistant [[poison]]. Frightened, he made a quick departure.

==Description==
Aklar Delkash was a dark-skinned man with black hair and bushy eyebrows. He had beady, somewhat shifty-looking dark brown eyes. He was 5 feet and 4 inches (1.6 meters) tall and weighed 180 pounds (82 kilograms). 

He dressed flamboyantly, in brightly colored fine [[silk]]s. This was at odds with his generally dour attitude.

==Allies==
He had hired four [[mercenary|mercenaries]] to protect and assist him on his journey.{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|68–69}}
