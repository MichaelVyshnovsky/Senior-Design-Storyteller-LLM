Klank was the name given to a suit of animated armor that was used to guard the Elfsong Tavern during the late 15 century DR.
Klank served as a bouncer and protector, alongside the half-ogre Skoona. Their job was to protect the staff of the Elfsong, and refused to insert themself in any conflict that only involved the inns patrons.
