Glazhael the Cloudchaser was a white dragon allied with the reformed Cult of the Dragon of Severin Silrajin.
While Glazhael was described by some as being particularly handsome for a white dragon, he was not especially intelligent.
He believed that dragons were superior to all others beings and was proud to take actions in service to the exalted queen Tiamat.
The dragon lived in the caves and tunnels that lay in the center of Skyreach Castle, where he was tasked with protecting the treasure the cult had amassed.
Talis the White practically worshiped everything about Glazhael.
Glazhael was present at Skyreach Castle when it was infiltrated by a group of adventurers some time in the 1480s DR.
