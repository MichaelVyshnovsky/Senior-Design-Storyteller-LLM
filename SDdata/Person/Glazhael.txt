'''Glazhael the Cloudchaser''' was a [[white dragon]] allied with the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] of [[Severin Silrajin]].

==Description==
While Glazhael was described by some as being particularly handsome for a white dragon, he was not especially intelligent.

==Personality==
He believed that dragons were superior to all others beings and was proud to take actions in service to the exalted queen [[Tiamat]].

==Activities==
The dragon lived in the caves and tunnels that lay in the center of [[Skyreach Castle]], where he was tasked with protecting the treasure the cult had amassed.

==Relationships==
[[Talis the White]] practically worshiped everything about Glazhael.

==History==
Glazhael was present at Skyreach Castle when it was infiltrated by a group of [[adventurer]]s some time in the 1480s [[DR]].
