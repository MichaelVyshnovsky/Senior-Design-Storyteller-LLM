'''Huang''' was a [[Dawnbringer]] of [[Lathander]] from the city [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lady [[Firelia Jannath]] hired Dawnbringer Huang to exorcise the restless spirit that took possession of her husband, [[Oskar Fevras]]. Huang was unable to fulfill the promise and recommended Lady Jannath to hire a priest of [[Sel√ªne]] instead.
