        "mainbody": "'''Cattl''' was the [[shaman]] of the [[Nexalan]] people of [[Maztica]] and the grandson of [[Tecco]], the Prophet of [[Zaltec]], who lived in the late 11{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "After Tecco, the Prophet of Zaltec, received divine commands from the holy ''pillar of Zaltec'' to find the southern valley of their future and from there to conquer the world, the [[Nahuat]] tribe wandered the lands for many years. The exact number of years the people who would become the Nexala wandered the True World in search of the prophesied land was unrecorded by historians. But in the {{YearlinkName|1099}}, Cattl, Tecco's grandson, led the tribe to the [[Valley of Nexal]]. The lush green valley became home to the Mazticans, eventually becoming the Nexalan empire of the True World. The ''pillar of Zaltec'' was carried by the Nahuats and with Cattl's command â€“ became part of the Valley."
