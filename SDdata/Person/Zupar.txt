'''Zupar''' was an assassin and an agent of the [[Night Parade]] who was a part of the group's cell in [[Arabel]], tasked with exiting revenue on Lady Lord [[Myrmeen Lhal]] in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Zupar appeared akin to a bloated brain that strode on four twig-like legs in his true heinous form. The top of the brain had a tentacle appendage that resembled a [[whip]]. Zupar's favorite disguise was a [[halfling]], to which the aberrant monster occasionally forgot to add the usual hin feet hair. In both forms, Zupar was a {{SI|3'8|'"|long=yes}} tall creature.

==Abilities==
Like other members of the Night Parade, Zupar was a shapechanger. He lacked physical strength, but it was remedied by his skills in magic and cunning intelligence. Zupar's gift was the ability to transmute up to 100 square feet of [[wood]] or [[stone]] into water.

==History==
Zupar was a part of the Night Parade's clandestine cell established in the city of Arabel about a decade before the {{YearlinkName|1360}}. When the Lady Lord of Arabel–Myrmeen Lhal, clashed and demolished the Night Parade's operations in [[Calimshan]], in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, the aberrant creatures vowed vengeance. Myrmeen made the organization vulnerable and alerted king [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] and the [[Harpers]] of the evils orchestrated by the Night Parade. Zupar, and several other members of the cabal, led by [[Lord Tempos]], placed an artifact that could open ''[[gate]]s'' to the [[Demiplane of Nightmares]] atop [[Nyaril]] family trade warehouse and magically summoned thunderstorms for two weeks to power the device up. Once it was activated, the army of the Night Parader was to flood and take over the city, slaying Myrmeen, her daughter [[Krystin Lhal]], and a survivor of the Calimshan fiasco – warrior named [[Ord]].{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|28-29}}

The Night Parade started murdering Arabel's [[wizard]]s to ensure the plan was not interrupted. Zupar ofter accompanied his fellow monstrosity [[Brokus]], riding on its back into the assassinations. Together, the two successfully assassinated [[Epicot]] as Zupar transformed a wall in the wizard's home into water, and Brokus swiftly murdered the man. The second assignation of Zupar's was [[Myschanta Halarra]]. The sorceress was slain but her body was transported to [[Silverymoon]] via the ''[[contingency]]'' spell to be ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]'' later. Myschanta was not easy prey. She was killed but not before landing a scorching ray of magical flames on Zupar with a ''[[wand of fire]]''. With the wizard dead, the wand was claimed by Zupar.{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|37}}

The plot on Myrmeen's life was thwarted by a band of adventurers who entered Arabel on [[Flamerule 21|21{{st}} of Flamerule]], 1360 DR. The group was tasked with the investigation into mysterious deaths, and eventually led to the Night Parade's warehouse, just as the group was getting ready to open a fully-charged ''gate'' into their home plane. Myrmeen Lhal, a small squad of her guard, and the heroes stormed the warehouse, slaying the creatures of the Night Parade. Zupar's final fate remained unclear.{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|42-43}}
