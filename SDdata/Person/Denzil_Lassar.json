        "mainbody": "Denzil Lassar, later known as Lady D, was the owner and the founder of the Inferno Hall, a temple to Sharess of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.\nDenzil Lassar was known for their acid tongue.\nDenzil Lassar was born in the nation of Chessenta, where he witnessed the atrocities of slavery and abuse. There, he learned to despise the practices of slavery and evangelical preaching.\nIn Ches of the , a new establishment dedicated to the Goddess of Excess & Lust opened in Ravens Bluff, called the House of Desires. This sparked some outrage from the Clerical Circle, as the temple was opened as a merchant house by all legal definitions and registrations and, as such, the Clerical Circle held no power over it. The new establishments owner, named Ceraphane, threatened to outperform and overshadow the Inferno Hall quickly. As a gesture of goodwill, Ceraphane invited Denzil Lassar and members of the Infernal Hunt Club to the House of Desires. Following the visit, Denzil Lassar gave an interview to the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter saying that the two temples philosophies were well aligned and he saw a great mutually beneficial future ahead. Since then, Denzil had been seen meeting with Ceraphane several more times. In Tarsakh of the same year, Denzil Lassar was among many notable individuals who attended the housewarming celebration of Briar Oldhills manse, boarding house, and shrine humorously named Briars Patch.\nThe month of Mirtul of 1371 DR was shaken by a scandal that exposed Ceraphane as a being of lower planes. The social club called the Infernal Hunt Club was sucked into the scandal because of their quick and close relations ever since the initial visit to the House of Desires. Jacinth Moonspring of Ravens Bluff Trumpeter conducted an interview with Denzil after a candlelit dinner in which the Master of the Hunt denied claims that Ceraphane was a baatezu and that he and the social club held no ill intents for Ravens Bluff. The man reiterated that the Infernal Hunt Club had some of the most upstanding citizens among its rands and that he himself was aiming to run for the position of the Lord Speaker in the future.\nIn Kythorn, Denzil Lassar was one of many adventurers who embarked on a journey under the leadership of Sir Rethgif Deepburrow, Knight Commander of the Order of the Fox, to the 47 level of the Abyss to oppose its rulers dire plot against the Living City. The adventures managed to rescue several abducted inhabitants of Big Moe from an earlier attack on the town. The article by Gilbert Hadfree that recounted these events, erroneously or falsely, claimed that Rethgif Deepburrows operation rescued the goddess Waukeen, however, that was a false claim as the goddess was freed months earlier by a group of heroes sponsored by the Goldspires of Amn and guided by visions of Halanna Jashire. Later the same month, Denzil Lassar publicly denounced slavery as a gaggle of dead slavers washed ashore in the neighboring city of Tantras. He vowed the Infernal Hunt Club would guard the shores of the Dragon Reach from such deplorable people.\nBy Flamerule of 1371 DR, Denzil Lassar decided to publicly announce his retirement from adventuring and officially began the campaign to run for the office of the Lord Speaker of Ravens Bluff. The following month, Gary Goodnews of the Trumpeter conducted an interview with Harmony of Milil, a candidate for the office of the deputy mayor. During the interview, she suggested that she would be interested in picking Denzil Lassar, now known as Lady D, as her running mate. In an editorial note, it was revealed that, shortly before, Denzil had been involved in an incident of some sort in the Temple of Sel√ªne from which the candidate for the speakership emerged as a woman. The magical transformation did not affect her electoral candidacy nor campaign."
