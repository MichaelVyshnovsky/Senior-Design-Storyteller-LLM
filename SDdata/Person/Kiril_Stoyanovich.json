        "mainbody": "Kiril Stoyanovich was the leader of a pack of werewolves in the domain of Barovia, circa the Faer√ªnian 15 century DR.\nIn his human form, Kiril had a broad build, a bald head and a square, black beard that came down to a point.\nKiril and his pack made their lair in the caves near Lake Baratok.\nHe was a pragmatic but brutal leader, who did what he had to in order to ensure the safety of his pack as a whole. He accepted their fate as residents of the horrible realm they called their home, believing that escape was entirely impossible.\nSometime circa the 1480s DR, two members of Kirils pack, Dron and Utna, came under the influence of the warlock Sangin, an agent of Strahd von Zarovich who sought his freedom from Barovia.\nUnsuccessful in their efforts to flee, the pair  of wolves drew the ire of Count Strahd, who had transformed Sangin into a vampire and dispatched him to punish Kirils pack for their transgression. In a twisted compromise, Sangin forced Kiril to condemn one of his pack members to death, in order to save the rest. Kiril chose Dron, sparing Utna but leaving her furious and alone in the horrific world in which they all lived."
