She was buried in Undermountain after her death, together with her husband [[Julain De'Spri]].\n\nIn 1479 DR, the [[vampire]] [[Dayan]] using a strange resurrection machine he had found resurrected Amori. However, because she returned to life thanks to the life forces of [[kobold]]s and [[rage drake]]s, Amori's mind was temporarily addled and she often displayed kobold and rage drake mannerisms. Amori disliked her new life and wanted to return to her death with her Julain.",
