==History==
Falcata defended Uthe Lodge along with the other wood woads [[Robur]] and [[Prinus]], around the time of the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]]. They protected the [[dryad]] [[Sylvie]], who was the source of the plant overgrowth and had been subverted by the [[druid]] [[Halsaime]] through the [[ranger]] [[Peron Uthe]].
