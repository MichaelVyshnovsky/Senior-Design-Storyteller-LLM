'''Hezebel''' was an [[erinyes]] who was trapped within [[Ammon Jerro]]'s haven in the [[Sword Mountains]], for the purpose of empowering the [[warlock]].

She was in a constant feud with several of the other imprisoned [[Demon|demons]] and [[devils]], but broke free when [[Baalbisan]] convinced [[Shandra Jerro]] to spill her blood to undo the magic that bound the fiends to the haven.
