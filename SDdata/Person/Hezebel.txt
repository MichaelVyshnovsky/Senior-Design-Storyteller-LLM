Hezebel was an erinyes who was trapped within Ammon Jerros haven in the Sword Mountains, for the purpose of empowering the warlock.
She was in a constant feud with several of the other imprisoned demons and devils, but broke free when Baalbisan convinced Shandra Jerro to spill her blood to undo the magic that bound the fiends to the haven.
