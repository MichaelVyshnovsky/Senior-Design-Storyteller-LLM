        "mainbody": "Rath Modar was a Red Wizard of Thay who had desires to become the next Zulkir of Illusion and even grander plans for himself.\nRath was deceptive and obfuscating. He had an interest in ancient empires and lost items of power. He plotted revenge from his castle on the Sword Coast.\nThe Red Wizard armed himself with a staff of fire and carried scrolls of dimension door, feather fall, and fireball spells on his person at all times.\nRath was a Red Wizard of Thay who was exiled to the Sword Coast because of suspicions that he was involved in a plot by the Red Wizards to retake Thay from Szass Tam.\nHe was a key player in the alliance with the Cult of the Dragon, but unlike them was not a zealous believer in Tiamat. Rather, he desired that when she re-entered the world he would forge a Thayan alliance with her. This would be a part of the planned Thayan Resurrection, a greater scheme to depose Szass Tam and return the Red Wizards to power in Thay. Because of his exile, he wanted to take revenge by taking an army of dragons to Thay and conquering it for himself."
