        "Personality": "She was wholly devoted to her master, even to the detriment of her own self-determination.",

        "Relationships": "Nessa believed herself to be Yurgir's \"heart-jewel\", that they were true loves. Unfortunately, Yurgir had been ordering his [[merregon]] quartermaster to dose Nessa's meal with a concoction that included [[succubus]] spittle. That treatment incited Nessa's adoration for the orthon, and ensured her loyalty as a fighting companion.",
        "History": "She remained with Yurgir in the [[Gauntlet of Shar]] for some time, up until at least the {{YearlinkName|1492}}."
