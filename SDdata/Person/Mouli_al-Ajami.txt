Sheikh Mouli al-Ajami was the leader of the House of Tayif tribe in the High Desert of west Zakhara around 1367 DR.
Charismatic and intelligent, Mouli was a natural leader. All of his followers were fanatics.
Mouli had striking blonde hair and blue eyes.
Mouli was a foreigner to the sands of Zakhara, hence his surname of "al-Ajami." Over time he convinced a large number of smaller tribes and clans to rebel against the Grand Caliph. He led many raids against caravans, outposts, and civilized lands.
Captured and tortured by mamluk slavers in Qudra, Mouli quickly learned to hate civilized culture. He escaped into the desert where he began to build an army of raiders.
