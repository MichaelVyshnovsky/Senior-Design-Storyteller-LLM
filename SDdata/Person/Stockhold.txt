==Description==
[[Dawnmaster]] Stockhold's stained glass depiction showed a [[tiefling]] with dark red, a pious look, and [[Lathanderian]] garb. The depiction was shown holing a ''[[holy symbol]]'' of Lathander with the right hand held up.

==History==
Dawnmaster Stockhold was among four high-ranking members of the church who were interred in the Rosymorn Monastery sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The other three were [[Seed]], [[Welkinglory‎]], and [[Vaseid]]. All four had their sarcophagi arranged around the circular stained glass mosaic that bore their likeness while atop the pedestals laid each of their ceremonial weapons – masterfully crafted [[enchanted]] ''+1'' items that were among those great works that attracted pilgrims from across [[Faerûn]], Lathanderian and members of other faiths alike.
