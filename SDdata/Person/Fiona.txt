'''Fiona''' was the mother of [[Ayana (Baldur's Gate)|Ayana]], who lived in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Ayana died in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, and her body was buried in the [[Lower City Graveyard]]. Fiona, the child's mother, could not thank the mortician [[Valmorba]] for going above and beyond for the funeral in the letter, sending the [[Lower City Mortuary]] [[gold]] for the coffin and for Valmorba to burry the girl's beloved [[teddy bear]] with her.
