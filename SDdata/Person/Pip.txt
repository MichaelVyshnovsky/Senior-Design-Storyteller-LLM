'''Pip''' was the butler at the [[Balthis Estate]] in the City of Coin, [[Athkatla]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Welcome to the home of Acton Balthis, currently Vice-Regent for the council of Athkatla, my Lady. Er... Lord Balthis is not here. Might I ask your purpose?''|Pip}}

==Description==
Pip was a [[halfling]] man of refined etiquette with hair the color of hay.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Pip had been empty by [[Acton Balthis]] for some time, residing in the nobleman's home in Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Bridge District|Bridge District]]. Pip greeted all visitors who entered the Balthis Estate and turned away unwanted guests, claiming Acton was not in and had no time for walk-in appointments. If Pip's requests were unheeded, the estate's bodyguards were sure to escort unwanted visitors out.
