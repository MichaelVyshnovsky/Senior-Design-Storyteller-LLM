        "mainbody": "'''Bishimzon''' was the [[human]] [[wizard]] in charge of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s operation set from the ruined [[Darnarest's tower]], somewhere in the [[Interior Faer√ªn]]. His main activities ''circa'' [[1369 DR]] were capturing unwitting villagers and adventurers to be used as the Cult's slaved in the city of [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "He was {{SI|5'7|'\"|long=yes}} tall.",
        "Abilities": "As a low-level commander of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s hideout, Bishimzon was trained in ''spellcraft'', ''combat casting'', and was proficient with the exotic weapon called the ''[[claw bracer]]''.\n\nAs a wizard, Bishimzon has access to a limited selection of spells, such as ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[flare]]'', ''[[light]]'', ''[[mage hand]]'', ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[glitterdust]]'', and a few more. His favorite spell was ''[[charm person]]'' that he always started his fights with. Bishimzon kept himself under the safety of ''[[shield]]'', and '[[protection from arrows]]'' ''spells'' at all times.''",
        "Possessions": "Most commonly, Bishimzon could be found wearing his [[studded leather]] armor and a common weapon among the Cultist - the ''[[claw bracer]]''. He was also armed with a [[light crossbow]], a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]'' with fifteen charges, and his trusty ''[[spellbook]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Bishimzon led the small group of [[Cult of the Dragon]] that was capturing slaves to be transported via the ''[[gate]]'' in [[Darnarest's tower]]'s sub-basement to the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. His group consisted of approximately ten cultists, including [[Handragath]] who lured the victims to the Cult's hideout under false pretenses.\n\nAs a wizard, Bishimzon had a ''[[familiar]]'', a [[viper]] named [[Shurrs]].",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], Bishimzon's Cultists routinely abducted villagers and adventurers enslaving them. Some of their victims were [[Fitsyll]], [[Jorsh]], [[Ristim]], and [[Wenta]], all local villagers. The Cultists held the prisoner in the second basement level of Darnarest's tower, manacled to the wall until it was time to push them through the ''gate''.\n\nAfter about two tendays of operations, Bishimzon's group encountered a group of adventurers searching for the missing folk. The group destroyed the Cult's hideout and followed the survivors through the ''gate'' to Myth Drannor."
