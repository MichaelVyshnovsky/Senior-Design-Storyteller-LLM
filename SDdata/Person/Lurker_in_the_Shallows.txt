The Lurker in the Shadows was a mysterious creature inhabiting Yhauntan Bay in the Dragon Reach in 1358 DR.
The exact nature of this local menace remained unclear. Guesses as to its nature included a morkoth, an eye of the deep, and even an aquatic dragon.
The Lurker in the Shallows was rumored to reside in an enormous lair packed with treasure. Many brave adventurers searched for this lair and the treasure within, but none returned.
