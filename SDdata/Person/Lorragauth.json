        "mainbody": "'''Lorragauth''', the '''Chained Wyrm''', was a gargantuan [[black dragon]] who lived in [[Neverwinter Wood]] centuries prior to [[1479 DR]].",
        "History": "He lived a centuries-long life, and amassed a great hoard. When Lorragauth sensed his own impending death, he tried to destroy all the lands in his domain. Lorragauth felt that if he must die, so would his \"kingdom\" die with him. While destroying an area near the edge of his domain, Lorragauth spotted the [[amethyst dragon]] [[Eldenser]] intruding on his lands. Lorragauth immediately flew at the other dragon, but Eldenser was well prepared, veering away at the last moment and nearly ripping off one of Lorragauth's wings. Lorragauth crashed into a nearby mountainside, coming to a violent death.{{Cite dragon/237/Wyrms of the North: Eldenser|33}}\n\nOver the centuries, Lorragauth's corpse seeped [[magic]] into the earth around his final resting place. So potent was this magic that the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] constructed a [[Dread Ring (Neverwinter Wood)|Dread Ring]] atop Lorragauth's remains, completing their work in the [[1462 DR|Year of the Elves's Weeping, 1462 DR]].{{Cite digital book/Gauntlgrym|387}} The Red Wizards failed to complete their intended ritual, and the Dread Ring was heavily damaged. In the [[1479 DR|Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR]], Red Wizard agent [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] discovered Lorragauth's bones beneath the Dread Ring. She hatched a plan to use the immense power of the rebuilt Dread Ring to bring Lorragauth back as a [[dracolich]].\n\nAlthough nearly successful, Valindra's plan was thwarted later that same year by a coalition of the [[Neverwinter Guard]], the [[Gray Wolf tribe]], the [[Icehammer]] dwarves, the [[Harpers]], the [[Lords' Alliance]], and [[Rath Modar]]'s rogue Red Wizards. Led by [[Alphonse Knox|Sergeant Knox]] of Neverwinter, they pushed back the Thayans within the Dread Ring and damaged most of their installations, among them Lorragauth's remains excavation site, and allowed a group of [[adventurer|adventurers]] to infiltrate Valindra's tower in [[Thay]] through a teleporter to stop her dracolich ritual and kill her mortal envelop, sending her back to her phylactery."
