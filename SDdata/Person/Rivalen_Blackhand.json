        "mainbody": "'''Rivalen Blackhand''' was a [[wizard]] and the proprietor of [[Sorcerous Sundries]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. From within the store, he imported and sold [[arcane]] [[Material component|components]], offered fortune-telling of an unreliable nature, as well as spellcasting services, particularly those related to the betterment of luck.\n\nRivalen was a fairly successful businessman, earning a significant and reliable income from the shop. He was aided by his apprentice, a [[gnome]] named [[Gilligunn]].",
        "History": "Claiming to have come from the far-off land of [[Halruaa]], Rivalen boasted that he held great [[arcane]] power during his adventuring days. According to his tales however, a great battle with a [[demon]] left him with a shriveled, blackened handâ€”which in turn ended his career as an adventurer."
