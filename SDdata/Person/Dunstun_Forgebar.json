        "mainbody": "Dunstun Forgebar was a dwarf cleric of Vergadain from Clan Forgebar of the Sword Mountains. He was a merchant and a member of the Council of Sparkling Stones in the city of Mirabar in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nDunstun was a prominent member of the council in the mid-1360s DR,While Dunstun is listed as a councilor in Volos Guide to the North, circa 1365 DR, he is not listed in The North, circa 1370 DR. While the lists only give some \"prominent\" members of the 42-strong council, The Thousand Orcs mentions Agrathan Hardhammer is the only dwarf on the council, so Dunstun may have left the council or died between these dates."
