{{quote|''It's not what it looks like. I promise.''|Jitters Corbwell}}

==Description==
Jitters was a pale gnome with blond hair and blue eyes. She wore green frock finery atop a brown very and a ruffled tunic.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Jitters Corbwell found herself addicted to an illicit substance found in Baldur's Gate called [[silkroot]]. She found a dealer in the [[Lower City]], in an alley near the [[Basilisk Gate]]. The brightly acid-color-scaled [[dragonborn]] was a member of the infamous [[Guild]], but instead of silkroot, he peddled [[Aloe vera plant|aloe ointment]], as simpletons could never know the difference between the two substances.
