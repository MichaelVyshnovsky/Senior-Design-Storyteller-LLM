Emsra was a serving woman at The Eel Revealed in Suzail in the late 15 century DR.
Among the serving girls, she was the sleekest, and swiftest, too. On the day that Glathra Barcantle came looking for Arclath Delcastle, she wore a skirt, and a thigh-garter which was revealed when she twirled.
She had quite the expert moves.
She served meals at The Eel Revealed, and sometimes, attended to other needs, too.
She rather liked Arclath Delcastle, as a patron.
Emsra was serving at The Eel Revealed, where Arclath Delcastle was a regular known to her, on the morning after the murder of Halance Tarandar and Belnar Buckmantle. She served him succulent eels and morels in sardragon sauce.
