==Abilities==
She had quite the expert moves.

==Activities==
She served meals at [[The Eel Revealed]], and sometimes, attended to other needs, too.

==Relationships==
She rather liked [[Arclath Delcastle]], as a patron.

==History==
Emsra was serving at [[The Eel Revealed]], where Arclath Delcastle was a regular known to her, on the morning after the murder of [[Halance Tarandar]] and [[Belnar Buckmantle]]. She served him succulent eels and morels in sardragon sauce.
