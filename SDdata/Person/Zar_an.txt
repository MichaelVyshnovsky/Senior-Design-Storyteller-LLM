Raider '''Zar'an''' was a [[githyanki]] guard from [[Crèche Y'llek]], on [[Toril]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''Be welcome, kin, but do not disturb our peace.''|Zar'an}}

==Description==
Zar'an had a gaunt gith body and golden-colored hair. She wore little armor, just a pair of githyanki metal [[bracer]]s and a cauldron while carrying a githyanki-crafted [[crossbow]].

==History==
Raider Zar'an, along with other gith of what would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the [[Rosymorn Monastery]] of [[Lathander]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[West Faerûn]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the [[mind flayer]]s in [[Faerûn]] shifted in balance. Zar'an stood guard in the Crèche's hatchery but was more welcoming to outsiders than most of her kin.
