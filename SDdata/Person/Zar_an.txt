Raider Zaran was a githyanki guard from Crèche Yllek, on Toril during the late 15 century DR.
Zaran had a gaunt gith body and golden-colored hair. She wore little armor, just a pair of githyanki metal bracers and a cauldron while carrying a githyanki-crafted crossbow.
Raider Zaran, along with other gith of what would become Crèche Yllek, attacked and claimed the Rosymorn Monastery of Lathander in the Western Heartlands of West Faerûn sometime before the . Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in Faerûn shifted in balance. Zaran stood guard in the Crèches hatchery but was more welcoming to outsiders than most of her kin.
