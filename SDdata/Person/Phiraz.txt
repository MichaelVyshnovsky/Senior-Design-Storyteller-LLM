Phiraz of the Naturalists was a wizard and a sage who lived in Scornubel.
Phiraz was an expert on otyughs. He would often purchase live monsters or relatively intact carcasses.
At some point in the 14 century DR, Phiraz wrote up a report regarding Otyughs for the city of Scornubels Commissioner of Public Sewers. Later, around the late 1360s DR, Phiraz was conducting a study of life on the High Moor.
