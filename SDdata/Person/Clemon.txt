'''Clemon''' was a relatively prosperous [[sheep]] herder in the village of [[Volkumburgh]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
[[File:Clemon's Home.png|thumb|273px|''Clemon's residence highlighted on a map of [[Volkumburgh]].'']]
In [[1358 DR]],{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} his sheep herd was hit three times within two weeks by the [[gargoyle]] minions of [[Flashfire]], which he referred to as "demons," who would carry of his sheep to their master.

Around that time a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Suzail]], seeking out the scattered remains of the fabled [[Awtawmatawn]] on behalf of [[Amelior Amanitas]], overheard residents gossiping about this incident while in the [[Crimson Wyrm]]. With the gossip noting that recently those "demons" had grabbed two of his sheep and flew south with them. The adventurers came to Clemon's aid, fighting off the gargoyles the next time they attacked.
