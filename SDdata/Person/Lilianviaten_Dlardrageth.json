        "mainbody": "Erevan Ilesere\nLilianviaten Dlardrageth, who usually went by Lilten, was a gold elf cleric, a high priest and chosen of Beshaba, a Masked Lord of Waterdeep, and last prince of House Dlardrageth.\nHe took a fiend (possibly a feyri) as a mate and she bore him a daughter named Fayne.\nLilten was formerly a cleric of Erevan Ilesere, a deity of the Seldarine. At some point, he betrayed his god and began worshiping Beshaba, possibly because Ereven lost his power during the Spellplague. Around the beginning of the 15 century DR, Lilten became involved with a demoness and she produced a tiefling daughter whom they called Fayne. An eladrin named Ilira Nathalan, who happened to be Liltens estranged wife, tracked down Liltens demon lover and killed her, permanently scarring Fayne in the process.\nIn Waterdeep the , Lilten became aware of a young wizard named Myrin Darkdance, who had a very powerful spellscar. He enlisted the help of his daughter Fayne and hired a dwarven monk named Rath to kidnap her. Liltens plot was foiled by the paladin Kalen Dren, though Liltens involvement wasnt discovered.\nLilten traveled to Luskan in the , apparently to keep an eye on Myrin, who was in the custody of the Dead Rats gang. While in Luskan, he meddled with the abyssal Fury plague, even giving a priestess of Beshaba a scroll to summon the plague swarm.\nLater, Lilten directed Kalen and Myrin to the lair of the demon Scour, who was causing the plague, and the heroes destroyed the demon. Lilten gave Kalen a parcel containing the shards of Vindicator, which was apparently an attempt to lure Kalen to Westgate, where Kalens would-be apprentice Rhetegast Hawkwinter had traveled.\nLater in 1480 DR, Lilten journeyed to Westgate, apparently to continue manipulating Myrin. He tricked Rhett into thinking Kalen had lost his mind and intended to kill him, turning Rhett against Kalen. He also aided Fayne, who attempted to avenge her slain mother by killing Iliria.\nLilten was described as a beautiful gold elf. While in Luskan, he appeared with a rack of antlers, a sign of Beshabas favor, although its unknown if this was his true form or just an illusion."
