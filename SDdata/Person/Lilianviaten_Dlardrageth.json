        "mainbody": "'''Lilianviaten Dlardrageth''', who usually went by '''Lilten''', was a [[gold elf]] [[cleric]], a high priest and [[chosen]] of [[Beshaba]],{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|3879}} a [[Masked Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]],{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|4638}} and last prince of [[House Dlardrageth]].",
        "Relations": "He took a [[demon|fiend]] (possibly a [[fey'ri]]) as a mate and she bore him a daughter named [[Fayne]].",
        "History": "Lilten was formerly a cleric of [[Erevan Ilesere]], a deity of the [[Seldarine]]. At some point, he betrayed his god and began worshiping Beshaba, possibly because Ereven lost his power during the [[Spellplague]]. Around the beginning of the 15{{th}} century DR, Lilten became involved with a demoness and she produced a [[tiefling]] daughter whom they called Fayne. An [[eladrin]] named [[Ilira Nathalan]], who happened to be Lilten's estranged wife, tracked down Lilten's demon lover and killed her, permanently scarring Fayne in the process.\n\nIn Waterdeep the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Lilten became aware of a young [[wizard]] named [[Myrin Darkdance]], who had a very powerful [[spellscar]]. He enlisted the help of his daughter Fayne and hired a [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[monk]] named [[Rath]] to kidnap her. Lilten's plot was foiled by the [[paladin]] [[Kalen Dren]], though Lilten's involvement wasn't discovered.\n\nLilten traveled to [[Luskan]] in the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, apparently to keep an eye on Myrin, who was in the custody of the [[Dead Rats]] gang. While in Luskan, he meddled with the abyssal [[Fury]] plague, even giving a priestess of Beshaba a scroll to summon the plague swarm.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|3919}}\n\nLater, Lilten directed Kalen and Myrin to the lair of the demon [[Scour]], who was causing the plague, and the heroes destroyed the demon.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|5979}} Lilten gave Kalen a parcel containing the shards of [[Vindicator]], which was apparently an attempt to lure Kalen to [[Westgate]], where Kalen's would-be apprentice [[Rhetegast Hawkwinter]] had traveled.\n\nLater in 1480 DR, Lilten journeyed to Westgate, apparently to continue manipulating Myrin. He tricked Rhett into thinking Kalen had lost his mind and intended to kill him, turning Rhett against Kalen.{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|3389}} He also aided Fayne, who attempted to avenge her slain mother by killing Iliria.{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|5383}}",
        "Description": "Lilten was described as a beautiful gold elf. While in Luskan, he appeared with a rack of antlers, a sign of Beshaba's favor, although it's unknown if this was his true form or just an illusion.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|3875}}"
