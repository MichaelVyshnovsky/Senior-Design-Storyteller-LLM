        "mainbody": "'''Atrocious''' was a [[flesh hound]] â€“ a [[chimera]] like monstrosity of animated beast part, created by [[Luvia Bloodmire]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Atrocious inhabited the dungeon lab of Luvia's within the [[Bloodmire Manor]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. The guard dog of sorts was the sentry that stood by the passage to the mansion's deepest clears. When confronted with intruders, two-head Atrocious, alongside several smaller flesh hounds, would attack relentlessly with their [[poison]]ous gas vomit attacks, and Atrocious would launch chunks of its own body at the enemies. Presumably, the chimeric abomination was slain by the five heroes who stood against [[Mordoc SeLanmere]]."
