Kulshond, known as The Mad Mage, was an infamous trouble-making mage in the 14 century DR.
He traveled all of Toril, acquiring exotic spells and playing pranks on people along the way. This included polymorphing various creatures he encountered into other kind of creatures as the mood struck him. He could cast a dimension door as often as he liked to go where he pleased, presumably by using a magic item.
For those folk he got curious about, Kulshond hardly ever showed up in person, but rather dispatched one of his watchskulls to follow and spy on them. These were created by a spell of his own invention. He could see, hear, communicate, and even speak command words through these skulls, including multiple skulls at once, but fortunately could not cast his spells. He could cause the skull to headbutt creatures or even explode. With these watchskulls, Kulshond was known to offer helpful, or taunting, remarks to those he monitored or disrupt their spellcasting or surprise them into dropping something vital in order to interfere with their actions, to lead them to harm, or to warn others.
His behavior was erratic. He never talked aloud, only murmured and whispered, but he often giggled.
His face was concealed under a shadowy illusion.
Originally active in the early 1300s DR, Kulshond disappeared from public view circa 1330 DR, giving Faer√ªn, at least, some respite from his pranks for nearly thirty years.
Then he made a surprise return in the late 1350s DR, wandering the Realms and polymorphing random merchants and noble ladies into frogs and weasels. In Selgaunt in Sembia, he vanished a number of surprised people, with their lovers, in various stages of courtship and undress, onto the dining tables of their spouses at a trade-moot feast, leading almost to a riot.
