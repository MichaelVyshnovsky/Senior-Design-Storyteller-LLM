Shaluta Drennan was a co-owner of The Nightgate Inn until the late 15 century DR.
Shaluta was married to a ship captain from Marsember. At one point in her life, she purchased a share in the ownership of the fortified Nightgate Inn just outside of Suzails city walls. She was one of the six owners of the profitable establishment and had the smallest share. By the late 15 century DR, Shaluta was a retired widow, and as poor health and age caught up with her, Shaluta sold her share to Paresper Hethcanter of Immersea.
