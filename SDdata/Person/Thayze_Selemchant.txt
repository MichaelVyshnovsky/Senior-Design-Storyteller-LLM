Thayze Selemchant was the first Meisarch of Amn and Lord of House Selemchant.
He founded the Council of Six in 1333 DR, but then became petty and jaded. He was also secretly a high-ranked member of the Cowled Wizards. He was blackmailing two other council members but his membership of the Cowled Wizards was revealed and he died. There was a rumor that he survived as a ghost.
In 1345 DR, Tessarch Quorl Vemmil attempted to frame Thayze for a plague in Keczulla but Thayzes intelligence agents revealed the plot, and Quorl and his priests were forced to Keczulla where they perished. Thayze survived this attempt against him.
