        "mainbody": "Drazachytus was a fearsome red dragon of ill repute who laired in the Graypeak Mountains of the Savage Frontier some years before the late 14 century DR.\nDrazachytus renown came with the red wyrms death. The ambitious adventuring mage named Visdun Fardara sought to gain renown through heroics. After a series of failures, he spent most of his money to purchase a powerful wand of disintegration in the City of Splendors, Waterdeep, and traveled to Drazachytuss lair in the Graypeaks. With a single use of the wand, Visdun turned great Drazachytus into a pile of sand. The adventuring wizard collected Drazachytus ashes to use it as proof of his heroic deed. Visdun Fardara was praised as a hero for an entire week until Drazachytuss ashes were stolen from Visduns strongbox by a rival wizard who wanted to use the remnants of the great red dragon to conduct magical experiments.\nIn the , the ashes of Drazachytus were in possessions of planeswalker Mintassan, displayed in his curio shop in Westgates Market Triangle."
