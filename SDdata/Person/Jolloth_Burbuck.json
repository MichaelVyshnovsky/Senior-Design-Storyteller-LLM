        "mainbody": "Jolloth Burbuck, most often known only as Anvil, was a pirate who was a loyal crew-member of the Kissing Shark helmed by Blackfingers Ralingor in the Utter East in the late 14 century DR.\nJolloth was a hairy, battle-scarred individual with a gravelly voice. He was called Anvil because he was as heavy as one.\nJolloth was often wry. \nJolloth was a really efficient fighter and a stalwart seaman.\nJolloth was a good friend to his fellow Sharkers.\nBefore he became a pirate, Jolloth was a veteran soldier.\nSometime in the , the Kissing Shark was destroyed in a blast of smoke powder. Blackfingers Ralingor perished and only seven of the Sharkers survived Anvil was one of them. Together, the Sharkers saved one chest off the Kissing Shark. Later, the group found themselves in the tavern of Donders Dancing Masques in Tharkar. There a mysterious benefactor named Belmer Droon rescued them from one of the frequent bar fights, and helped the Sharkers avoid the brutal law enforcement of the Daggers of Tharkar.\nOnce the Sharkers and their savior reached the safety of Ankle Bells, Belmer revealed his agenda for generous pay, he wanted to hire a group of mercenaries to perform a mission in the capital of Doegan. After the pirates agreed, Belmer had them sign writs and they embarked on a mission to find and assassinate a noblewoman, Eidola of Neverwinter.\nUnder the cover of night, in secrecy, the group boarded the ship Morning Bird. Soon after the ship left the port, it came under an attack from an unknown black ship that bombarded the Bird with fire pot missiles and terrifying bone balls that melted away in the flames revealing dancing floating armed skeletons. The Sharkers and their benefactors managed to fight off the undead and evaded the black ship with the aid of Belmers box of mists and a prayer-token of Umberlee. The box transported the ship into a different part of the sea away from the pursuit, but the prayer token of the fickle goddess summoned her servants on board a ghost ship. The ship spawned the dreaded sea zombies and the crew of Morning Bird had to appease Umberlee by tossing their valuables overboard.\nDuring the short respite, the suspicious employer mixed an exotic drug called  yulchass powder in with the crews food. The powder had a side effect of making its imbibers truthful. The ship followed them, somehow tracking them. After a long search, the Sharkers and Belmer found a magical scrying device hidden on the bottom on the Sharkers chest..\nSoon after, the mysterious black ship, now identified as the Black Dragon, caught up with the Morning Bird. The pursuing captain was the infamous Orim Redbeard, the pirate responsible for the death of Blackfingers Ralingor. Kurthe Lornars short temper and rabid devotion to his old captain pushed him to attempt to attack Redbeard. Belmer knowing to expect it hit the tall Konigheimer over the head, knocking him out. Orim Redbeard realized that he pursued the wrong ship, and left the Sharkers in peace. Meanwhile, Kurthe Lornar recovered and attacked Belmer in a blind rage, while his fellow Sharkers stayed out of combat. Giving the hotheaded pirates plenty of warnings, Belmer killed Kurthe. Jolloth and Brindra Arrose noticed that Belmer had only played with Kurthe. \nAfter the Morning Bird sunk, Jolloth commented that they needed find a more durable ship. \nArrived in Eldrinpar, the surviving mercenaries led by Artemis Entreri were confronted by the paladins from Waterdeep led by Miltiades. One group was looking to rescue Eidola of Neverwinter, the abducted bride of Piergeiron the Paladinson, and the other group to assassinate her. So they started to fight in front of Eldrinpars Fountain of the Kraken and in battle Jolloth \"Anvil\" Burbuck was killed."
