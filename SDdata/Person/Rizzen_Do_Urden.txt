'''Rizzen''', later known as '''Rizzen Do'Urden''',

==Description==
Rizzen was described as "handsome but otherwise unremarkable."

==Personality==
Rizzen was very submissive to [[Matron Mother]] [[Malice Do'Urden]] and her cruel daughter [[Briza Do'Urden]]. It was no wonder, as they often beat him and threw him into the dungeon on a whim.

==History==
Rizzen was a commoner of House Do'Urden until he was made patron and allowed to carry the family name. He became patron after the previous patron, [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]], was stripped of his title. As patron, he was granted a two-room suite inside the complex of House Do'Urden.

In about [[1339 DR]], Malice tricked Rizzen into engaging the spirit-wraith ([[Zin-carla]]) Zaknafein in a fight, in which Rizzen was promptly killed. Malice claimed that it was no great loss as she had already chosen her next patron from amongst the soldiers of House Do'Urden.

==Skills==
Rizzen was trained as a fighter under Zaknafein, but he also had limited wizardly abilities.

==Relationships==
Rizzen was the known father of [[Briza Do'Urden|Briza]], [[Maya Do'Urden|Maya]], [[Nalfein Do'Urden|Nalfein]],<ref> and [[Dinin Do'Urden]],<ref> He was the "husband" of [[Malice Do'Urden]].
