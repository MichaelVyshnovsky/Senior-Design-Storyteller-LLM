Rizzen, later known as Rizzen DoUrden,
Rizzen was described as "handsome but otherwise unremarkable."
Rizzen was very submissive to Matron Mother Malice DoUrden and her cruel daughter Briza DoUrden. It was no wonder, as they often beat him and threw him into the dungeon on a whim.
Rizzen was a commoner of House DoUrden until he was made patron and allowed to carry the family name. He became patron after the previous patron, Zaknafein DoUrden, was stripped of his title. As patron, he was granted a two-room suite inside the complex of House DoUrden.
In about 1339 DR, Malice tricked Rizzen into engaging the spirit-wraith (Zin-carla) Zaknafein in a fight, in which Rizzen was promptly killed. Malice claimed that it was no great loss as she had already chosen her next patron from amongst the soldiers of House DoUrden.
Rizzen was trained as a fighter under Zaknafein, but he also had limited wizardly abilities.
Rizzen was the known father of Briza, Maya, Nalfein, and Dinin DoUrden, He was the "husband" of Malice DoUrden.
