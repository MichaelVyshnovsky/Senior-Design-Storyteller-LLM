Overblade Orrdun Fistright was the leader of the Stalwart Knights and the head of the Home of the Stalwarts in Velen during the late 14 century DR.
He was known for being a fearsome man that was not easily angered.
Orrdun succeeded Orm Talath as the head of Helms temple in Velen. Although Talath was beloved throughout the city, local residents felt secure with Orrduns appointment.
