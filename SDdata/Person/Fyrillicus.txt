Fyrillius was a red dragon in the service of Orcus in the Abyss in 1357 DR.
Fyrillicus patrolled the lands around the gate of the castle of Orcus.
Fyrillicus was spawned by a long line of red dragons that Orcus had subdued and brought to the Abyss and were larger than Prime Material Plane dragons.
The breeding process devised by Orcus had made Fyrillicus quite stupid. He always used the most direct approach. He was savage and cruel.
