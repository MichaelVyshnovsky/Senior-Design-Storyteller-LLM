'''Acwellan''' was a [[lich]] in [[Myth Drannor]], who dwelled in the [[Mages' Guild]].

==History==
He was once a [[wizard]] trying to research how to gain immortality. His attempts twisted his body and turned him into a lich.

In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, he was confronted by the [[Heroes of Waterdeep]], who might've decided to parley with him or just attack. Either way, they were forced to fight him. After he was defeated and at the point of dying, the [[Dark God]] took away the [[Codex of the Planes]], which Acwellan had carried. In his dying breath, he begged the adventurers to stop the Dark God. With the last of his energy, he teleported the adventurers near the [[Temple of Lathander (Myth Drannor)|Temple of Lathander]].
