'''Eljan''' was the door warden for [[Scornubel Hall]], the seat of [[Scornubian]] government in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Eljan had a good knowledge of the city and could give directions to most places and things to anyone visiting Scornubel. This was why Eljan received a favorable mention in ''[[Volo's Guide to the North]]'', penned by Master Traveler [[Volothamp Geddarm]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.{{cite book/Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast|106}}
