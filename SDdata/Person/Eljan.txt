Eljan was the door warden for Scornubel Hall, the seat of Scornubian government in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Eljan had a good knowledge of the city and could give directions to most places and things to anyone visiting Scornubel. This was why Eljan received a favorable mention in Volos Guide to the North, penned by Master Traveler Volothamp Geddarm in the late 14 century DR.
