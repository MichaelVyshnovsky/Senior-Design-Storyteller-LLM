{{quote|''It's people like you who make Lightbringer Gortash question our loyalty. Do not think Lightbringer Gortash is above burning you to smoke and ashes, too.''|Muttonchops Dorryss}}

==Description==
Muttonchops was a female [[gold dwarf]] with a clean-shaven face, tan skin, and mousy-gray hair. She wore a commoner's blouse and a [[corset]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the city of Baldur's Gate was threatened by the encroaching army of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. The crisis flooded the city with refugees, elevating tensions among its citizens and allowing a new power to take rulership of the city â€“ [[Lord Gortash]]. Muttonchops Dorryss eagerly consumed the new lord's propaganda from the curbside preachers and from the pages of the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette.'' [[Augur Harxkellan]] was a Gortash loyalist whose words attracted a crowd of gawkers in the Lower City. Muttonchops Dorryss was among the loyalist crowd, calling the new lord "Lightbringer Gortash."
