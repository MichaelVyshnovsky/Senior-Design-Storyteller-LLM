Lady '''Stellephosa''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Kelemvor]] in [[Undermountain]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
In 1479 DR, she went into Undermountain after hearing rumors of [[undead]] activities there. However, Stellephosa was instead captured by the [[goblin]] and [[kobold]] followers of the mad [[half-elf]] mercenary [[Zarr]]. Zarr forced her to fight as a gladiator against the [[bugbear]] [[Smurgle]].
