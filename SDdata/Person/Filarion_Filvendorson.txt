Filarion Filvendorson was a grandson of Elorfindar Floshin in Daggerford around 1370 DR and 1485 DR.
Filarion was the son of Filvendor Floshin. He trained as a thief but had a good reputation. Many in 1370 believed him the master of the local thieves guild.
He disappeared from the town for many years in search of his missing father, resurfacing only around 1445 DR at Elorfindar Floshins death hoping for an inheritance but the sole heir was Darfin Floshin.
He lived training guards and militiamen.
