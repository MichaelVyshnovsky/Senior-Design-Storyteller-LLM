Until further elaborated upon by Wizards of the Coast, this should be considered a mistake as both of Filarion's grandparents and his father are explicitly identified as Sun Elves in all older sources, while his mother was referred to as a Moon Elf.

'''Filarion Filvendorson''' was a grandson of [[Elorfindar Floshin]] in [[Daggerford]] around [[1370 DR]] and [[1485 DR]].

==History==
Filarion was the son of [[Filvendor Floshin]]. He trained as a thief but had a good reputation. Many in 1370 believed him the master of the local [[thieves' guild]].
He disappeared from the town for many years in search of his missing father, resurfacing only around [[1445 DR]] at [[Elorfindar Floshin]]'s death hoping for an inheritance but the sole heir was [[Darfin Floshin]].

He lived training guards and militiamen.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
