'''Merkul''' was a [[priest]] of [[Bane]] from the [[Dark God Reformed]], tempe of the Dark Lord in [[Voonlar]] ''circa'' [[1373 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Merkul descended into the catacombs under Voonlar, home of [[banelich]] named [[Shrazagul]], imprisoned there by the [[Church of Bane]] mani years prior. With Bane's death and return, wards that restarted the banelich faded and the temple of the Dark God Reformed attempted to restore the ancient prion. Merkul was slain by Shrazagul's undead, leaving behind his [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[plate mail]], adorned with Bane's holy symbols and regalia.
