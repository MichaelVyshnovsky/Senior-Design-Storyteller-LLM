        "mainbody": "Tathtaklo Phaerdinzer was a shopkeeper of Berdusk in the late mid-14 century DR and a prominent member of the Phaerdinzer clan.\nHe acted and looked like a shopkeeper rather than a mage.\nAs of , he sold the discards of adventurers at the Shining Sword, a shop in Berdusk. Sometimes, his wares were magical, but even those he crafted himself possessed only minor enchantments, including sometimes everbright and blueshine weapons, or glowing ones.\nThe Harpers took a keen interest in his store from the beginning, suspecting foul play in his sourcing of wares or in the owner. However, they eventually lost interest, as he only created small and subtle enchantments."
