'''Trant Mariss''' was one of the inhabitants of [[Daggerford]] who died and was buried long before [[1372 DR]].

{{quote|''Trant Mariss. Though he was fast, still came in last.''|Trant Mariss' headstone}}

==History==
In life, Trant was known fo this speed. After his death, he was buried in the [[Daggerford Graveyard]] just outside the walls of the city in the [[Eastern Farmlands]]. His headstone was located several feet away from the main structure of the graveyard, the mortuary mausoleum. ''Circa'' 1372 DR, his headstone was in good shape with its writings still quite legible.
