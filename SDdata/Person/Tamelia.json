        "mainbody": "was a wizard in the employ of the Zhentarim that regularly visited Voonlar, about every two or three tendays. She was most often seen in the company of deputy Marsara Storntil and this led to secret speculations by the town gossips about Marsaras love life. The deputy was apparently defensive about Tamelia because one farm worker, who imagined himself a potential suitor and had found courage by consuming alcoholic beverages, asked her bluntly about the rumors. Marsara proceeded to beat him so severely that she and Tamelia were never bothered by such rumors again.\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryMembers of the Zhentarim\nCategoryInhabitants of Zhentil Keep\nCategoryInhabitants of Voonlar\nCategoryInhabitants of the Moonsea\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of neutral evil alignment\nr4hqccsx7yirih4n4p8jp2mr33omr44"
