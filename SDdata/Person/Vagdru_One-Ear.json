        "mainbody": "agdru One-Ear was the owner of the Fallen Tower tavern in Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR.\nVagdru had only one ear, hence his nickname.\nAs the owner of the Fallen Tower tavern, Vagdrus job was to sell food and drinks to his fellow orcs and other patrons, and to manage the tavern. Vagdru was known for his homemade beer, which only orcs found palatable.\nWhen a tribe of orcs from Many-Arrows invaded the River District of Neverwinter in the 1470s DR, they discovered the Fallen Tower and reopened the tavern, with one of them, Vagdru One-Ear, taking the role of bartender and food-seller by 1479 DR."
