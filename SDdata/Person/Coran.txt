Coran was a wandering adventurer and womanizing archer of dubious virtue who traveled around Tethyr and across the Realms throughout the 14 century DR. He enjoyed a second, decades-long life as a politician and wealthy man-about-town in the great metropolis of Baldurs Gate.
While most elves were slender or athletic, Corans exuberance for luxury and excess lent his appearance a certain "pudginess". This was exceptionally apparent in his later years of life. 
He wore garish outfits that always drew even more attention to the spectacle that was himself. He decorated himself with rather stylist jewelry.
Throughout his life, Coran had a number of romantic entanglements and flirted shamelessly with any woman he met.
As Coran settled down with age, he settled into the role of a wise, world-weary advisor.
While his younger years were full of adventures and daring escapades, Corans later years were spent enjoying a certain level of celebrity. He was always invited to lavish parties thrown by the Baldurian patriar.
He enjoyed "guiding" adventurers in a manner that garnered him more wealth and offered him some form of entertainment. He had the audacity to profit off the crime that plagued Baldurs Gate, making bets on the manner that illegal activities played out.

Some time after the end of the Iron Crisis he began a rather tumultuous relationship with the sultry thief Safana. Some time during or after this time, be became acquainted with the famed Rashemaar adventurer Minsc.
Coran unknowingly fathered a half-elf child Namara with a young sorceress named Brielbara in Baldurs Gate after a brief fling. He also had a son named Krydle, who wound up becoming a great adventurer in his own right.
As a politician, Coran had a good working relationship with Duke Ulder Ravengard. While not necessarily close, they worked together for the betterment of Baldurs Gate and were not beyond calling in favors from each other.
In the  Coran was hired by Kelddath Ormlyr of Beregost to hunt a "great winged dragon" in the Cloakwood forest. After given the description of the beast having a barbed tail, Coran knew he was actually hunting wyverns but accepted the bounty regardless.
After spending some time in Baldurs Gate again, he ventured south to Tethyr in the . He relocated back to his cabin in the Forest of Tethir and reconnected with his love Safana. Having eloped at her request, Safana attempted to use her and Corans acquaintance with Abdel Adrian to draw the Bhaalspawn to a trap involving Lanfear and her pack of wolfweres.
Over the years Coran came to become a permanent resident of Baldurs Gate. He garnered a number of favors from among the Baldurain patriars. By the , Coran became an upstanding citizen of the city, having joined the Parliament of Peers. 
At some point during the 1480s DR, Corn briefly reunited with mysteriously resurrected Minsc at a revel thrown by some Baldurian nobles. At the same party, Coran was confronted by his son Krydle, who presented him with blackmail information from some unknown individual, by means of the Fetcher of the Undercellar. The reunion was not a joyous one for father or son.

Corans past caught up with him again when the Blades of Burgust stormed into a meeting of parliament at High Hall. The gangs leader Burgust―who had slain Corans former lover―led the attack in order to assassinate the former adventurer, in an act of cold vengeance against his son Krydle. Corans life was spared when Krydle and his partner Shandie joined the melee. During the fight, Coran got the upper hand on Burgust and stabbed him through the chest, in honor of Krydles mother. Coran and Krydle shared moment together, and left on much better terms than their last meeting.
In the , Coran was openly attacked again in High Hall, that time by cultists of the Absolute. Fortunately for Coran, his son Krydle and his friend Delina were approaching him for aide against the cult at precisely the same time. The trio managed to to defend themselves against the cultists for a time, until they were subdued by the illithid cultist Uddron Blass.
The three heroes were imprisoned Flaming Fist dungeons beneath High Hall, and both Coran and Krydle infected with mind flayer tadpoles, initiating the process of ceremorphosis. Uddron portalled Delina away, leaving Coran and Krydle to his pet displacer beast. Krydle deftly slipped out of his bonds, killed the beast, in defense of his father, and managed to break them both out of the dungeon.

Krydles efforts were largely in vain. Coran was overcome by the effects of ceremorphosis, and he rapidly began the process of transformation into a mind flayer. Coran and Krydle shared one last moment together, before they both plunged his poisoned dagger into body, ending his life while preventing transformation.
