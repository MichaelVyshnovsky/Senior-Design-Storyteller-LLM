Mother was a monstrous spawn of Grazzt in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1486 DR, Grazzt entrusted Mother to the derro of Ravagestone. There, she ate derro, myconids, and fungus, growing enormous.
Later, Mother decided to join her father in Maerimydra, and she arrived during the allied assault on the city. Mother and her derro minions inflicted heavy losses on the invading troops. At last she was killed by an adventuring party.
Mother was the daughter of the demon lord Grazzt and of an unknown, unspeakable creature.
Mother could spawn various fiends, including succubi, vrocks, and bar-lguras.
