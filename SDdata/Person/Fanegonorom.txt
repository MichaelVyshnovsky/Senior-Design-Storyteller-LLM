Fanegonorom was a revenant that dwelled within ancestral crypts of the Korlasz family as of the midâ€“14 century DR.
As a revenant, Fanegonorom could control lesser undead creatures and his touch could inflict disease upon others.
During his life as a mortal, he possessed the shield of Egons and cherished it dearly.
When the individual known as Korlasz delved into her familys crypts, her followers and mercenaries desecrated the sanctity of Fanegonoroms resting place. He sought Korlaszs death so that he could rest in peace.
