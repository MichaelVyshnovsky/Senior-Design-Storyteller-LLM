Brother Dolmas was a Tethyrian Ilmatari priest living in the Hook Ward of Calimport in the late 14 century DR.
Dolmas was a rather zealous member of his faith.
While living in the Hook Ward, Dolmas spent much of his time wandering around in search of aiding those who were in pain. In secret, he also sought means by which to help slaves escape to freedom.
Much of Brother Dolmas life was spent in his home nation of Tethyr, in the city of Saradush. But in 1370 DR, he moved to the Hook Ward of Calimport in order to act in the name of a newly hailed Ilmatari saint, Saint Asref, the patron of slave-liberation movement known as the Nadhari. Once in Calimport, Dolmas established a mission and shrine within the cellar apartment of a rowhouse.
Within his first six months living in the Hook Ward, Dolmas had spent a substantial portion of his funds purchasing eight slaves, who he then set free on ships bound to the northern city of Waterdeep.
