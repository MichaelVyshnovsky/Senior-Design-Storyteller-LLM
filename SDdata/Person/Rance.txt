Rance was a mercenary who lived in the Realms during the mid–14 century DR.
He was quite the skilled at wielding a sword in battle, and even more so adept at shooting a bow.
Rance owned a  +1 enchanted longbow.
At some point, Rance joined a group led by the elf named Vail, along with Achen Dell, Cailan, and Faizah Tin. The group assaulted the famous mage Ramazith Flamesinger at his tower in Baldurs Gate, but were petrified by the gaze of a basilisk.
The stone statue of Rance, along with those of his companions, were sold to the Baldurian nobleman, Felonius Gist, and kept at his familys estate in the city.
