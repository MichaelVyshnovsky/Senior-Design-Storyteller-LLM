'''Rance''' was a mercenary who lived in the Realms during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
He was quite the skilled at wielding a sword in battle, and even more so adept at shooting a [[bow]].

==Possessions==
Rance owned a '' +1 [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[longbow]]''.

==History==
At some point, Rance joined a group led by the [[elf]] named [[Vail]], along with [[Achen Dell]], [[Cailan]], and [[Faizah Tin]]. The group assaulted the famous [[mage]] [[Ramazith Flamesinger]] at his [[Ramazith's tower|tower]] in [[Baldur's Gate]], but were ''[[petrified]]'' by the gaze of a [[basilisk]].

The stone statue of Rance, along with those of his companions, were sold to the Baldurian nobleman, [[Felonius Gist]], and kept at [[Gist|his family's]] estate in the city.
