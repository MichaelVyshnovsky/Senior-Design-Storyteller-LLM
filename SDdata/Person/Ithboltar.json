Thus Ithboltar was the closest to a leader of the magelords as possible.\nHowever, when Elminster Aumar began his insurrection, his students appeared too disunited to fight together against the rebels. In the end, Elminster with a powerful spell destroyed Ithboltar and the few remaining magelords agreed to fight together.\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryMagelords\nCategoryInhabitants of Athalantar\nCategoryInhabitants of the Western Heartlands\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\n5s5nri3atfeni55awtycdsuaao901p1"
