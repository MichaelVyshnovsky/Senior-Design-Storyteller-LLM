        "History": "Ithboltar was a powerful member of the magelords from the start of their power, most of the magelords began as apprentices of him: first [[Neldryn Hawklyn]], later [[Kadeln Olothstar]] and [[Seldinor Stormcloak]]. Thus Ithboltar was the closest to a leader of the magelords as possible.\n\nHowever, when [[Elminster Aumar]] began his insurrection, his students appeared too disunited to fight together against the rebels. In the end, Elminster with a powerful spell destroyed Ithboltar and the few remaining magelords agreed to fight together.",
