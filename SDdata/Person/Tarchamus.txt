'''Tarchamus the Unyielding''' was a legendary [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] who lived in the midâ€“4{{th}} millennium before [[Dalereckoning]]. Tarchamus was so powerful he was able to directly harness the power of other planes to rain destruction on his enemies, and was famous for having invented a powerful lost spell called ''[[Tarchamus' volcano]]''.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|5105}}

==Relationships==
Tarchamus had a marked dislike of the arcanist [[Iriolarthas]] of [[Ythryn]], considering him to be a fraud.

==History==
He didn't particularly care much for his fellow arcanists and frequently argued with them. One feud with the arcanist [[Arion]] grew so vicious that Tarchamus created a spell that opened a gate to [[Phlegethos]] to create a volcano that destroyed the floating city of [[Tenish]] in {{YearlinkConvert|1374|NY}}.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils||15}}

After the destruction of Tenish, the most powerful arcanists, led by Tarchamus's friend [[Emrys]], banded together and found a way to block Tarchamus's access to the [[Weave]].{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|4137}} After his magical powers were revoked, Tarchamus built a huge [[Library of Tarchamus|library]] within the caverns of [[Xammux]] beneath the [[Nether Mountains]]. Since he was unable to access the Weave, he was unable to achieve [[lich|lichdom]] but was somehow able to transform himself into an extremely powerful [[mummy]] with the help of his apprentices. He was also able to transfer most of his consciousness into a magical book, the [[Book of Tarchamus]].

Tarchamus's physical form was destroyed in the {{YearlinkName|1478}}, when the [[tiefling]] [[Farideh]], her master [[Lorcan]], and friends found the [[Tarchamus' volcano|volcano]] spell and used it to blow the top off the mountain and destroy the library. Tarchamus's consciousness lived on inside the book, which fell into the possession of [[Tam Zawad]].{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|7032}}
