Tarchamus the Unyielding was a legendary Netherese arcanist who lived in the midâ€“4 millennium before Dalereckoning. Tarchamus was so powerful he was able to directly harness the power of other planes to rain destruction on his enemies, and was famous for having invented a powerful lost spell called Tarchamus volcano.
Tarchamus had a marked dislike of the arcanist Iriolarthas of Ythryn, considering him to be a fraud.
He didnt particularly care much for his fellow arcanists and frequently argued with them. One feud with the arcanist Arion grew so vicious that Tarchamus created a spell that opened a gate to Phlegethos to create a volcano that destroyed the floating city of Tenish in .
After the destruction of Tenish, the most powerful arcanists, led by Tarchamuss friend Emrys, banded together and found a way to block Tarchamuss access to the Weave. After his magical powers were revoked, Tarchamus built a huge library within the caverns of Xammux beneath the Nether Mountains. Since he was unable to access the Weave, he was unable to achieve lichdom but was somehow able to transform himself into an extremely powerful mummy with the help of his apprentices. He was also able to transfer most of his consciousness into a magical book, the Book of Tarchamus.
Tarchamuss physical form was destroyed in the , when the tiefling Farideh, her master Lorcan, and friends found the volcano spell and used it to blow the top off the mountain and destroy the library. Tarchamuss consciousness lived on inside the book, which fell into the possession of Tam Zawad.
