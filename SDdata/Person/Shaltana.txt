Shaltana was a woman who worked at the Nighthunt inn, which stood on the Dawn Pass Trail a days ride east of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. She was the wife of the innkeeper, Ildur Arntar.
She and Ildur Arntar had four daughters, two of whom were restless and keen to become sword-wielding adventurers themselves. She aided Ildur at the inn in the mid-1360s DR.
