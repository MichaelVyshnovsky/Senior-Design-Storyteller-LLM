'''Shaltana''' was a woman who worked at the [[Nighthunt]] inn, which stood on the [[Dawn Pass Trail]] a day's ride east of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the wife of the innkeeper, [[Ildur Arntar]].

==Relationships==
She and Ildur Arntar had four daughters, two of whom were restless and keen to become sword-wielding adventurers themselves. She aided Ildur at the inn in the mid-1360s DR.
