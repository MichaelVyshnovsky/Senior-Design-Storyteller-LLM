{{quote|''Out of my sight, miscreant - I do not share our merciful Lord Gortash's benevolence.''|Augur Harxkellan}}

==Description==
Augur was a [[dragonborn]] man of means who dressed in blur and brown Bladurian finery. His scales were the color of [[gold]] and orange eyes burned with conviction.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the city of Baldur's Gate was threatened by the encroaching army of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. The crisis flooded the city with refugees, elevating tensions among its citizens and allowing a new power to take rulership of the city â€“ [[Lord Gortash]]. Augur was a passionate Lord Gortash loyalist and an eager consumer of the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette,'' filled with the new Lord's propaganda. In turn, Augur used his charisma and oratory skills to loudly spew Enver Gortash propaganda in the Lower City, always attracting a crowd of gawkers and supporters.
