Augur Harxkellan was an orator from the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in late 15 century DR.
Augur was a dragonborn man of means who dressed in blur and brown Bladurian finery. His scales were the color of gold and orange eyes burned with conviction.
In the , the city of Baldurs Gate was threatened by the encroaching army of the Cult of the Absolute. The crisis flooded the city with refugees, elevating tensions among its citizens and allowing a new power to take rulership of the city â€“ Lord Gortash. Augur was a passionate Lord Gortash loyalist and an eager consumer of the Baldurs Mouth Gazette, filled with the new Lords propaganda. In turn, Augur used his charisma and oratory skills to loudly spew Enver Gortash propaganda in the Lower City, always attracting a crowd of gawkers and supporters.
