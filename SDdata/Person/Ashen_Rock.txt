'''Ashen Rock''' was a male [[tabaxi]] [[scout]]{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|29}} who resided in the [[Malar's Throat]] slums of [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]], during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|25}}{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|24}} He was a member of Port Nyanzaru's [[Citizens' Brigade]] and worked to defend the residents of Malar's Throat from the dangers of the jungle.

==Personality==
He was observant, independent, and gracious.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|26}} He was unafraid to engage in combat but he preferred stealth, and so he liked to operate on his own.

==Abilities==
Ashen Rock was dexterous, stealthy, and had keen hearing and eyesight. He had good survival skills, and in combat, he favored his natural claws.

==Possessions==
He carried a ''[[potion of poison resistance]]''.

==History==
During the events of the [[death curse]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Ashen Rock was a member of a Citizens' Brigade rescue party that embarked into the jungle when a group of [[pterafolk]] attacked Malar's Throat and abducted several residents. Ashen Rock became separated from the group and captured by the pterafolk, whom he observed to be erratic and [[disease]]d&mdash;possibly afflicted by the death curse&mdash;and to be sacrificing people to [[Plant creature|plant monsters]] in the jungle. He too was offered as a sacrifice alongside another prisoner, [[Siela]]. Although badly injured and trapped in brambles, he fought to escape from the [[Twig blight|twig]] and [[needle blight]]s to which he had been offered, but his only hope for survival lay with [[adventurer]]s who were also investigating the pterafolk.
