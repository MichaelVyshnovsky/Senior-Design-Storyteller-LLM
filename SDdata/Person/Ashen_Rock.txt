Ashen Rock was a male tabaxi scout who resided in the Malars Throat slums of Port Nyanzaru, Chult, during the late 15 century DR. He was a member of Port Nyanzarus Citizens Brigade and worked to defend the residents of Malars Throat from the dangers of the jungle.
He was observant, independent, and gracious. He was unafraid to engage in combat but he preferred stealth, and so he liked to operate on his own.
Ashen Rock was dexterous, stealthy, and had keen hearing and eyesight. He had good survival skills, and in combat, he favored his natural claws.
He carried a potion of poison resistance.
During the events of the death curse in the late 15 century DR, Ashen Rock was a member of a Citizens Brigade rescue party that embarked into the jungle when a group of pterafolk attacked Malars Throat and abducted several residents. Ashen Rock became separated from the group and captured by the pterafolk, whom he observed to be erratic and diseased&mdashpossibly afflicted by the death curse&mdashand to be sacrificing people to plant monsters in the jungle. He too was offered as a sacrifice alongside another prisoner, Siela. Although badly injured and trapped in brambles, he fought to escape from the twig and needle blights to which he had been offered, but his only hope for survival lay with adventurers who were also investigating the pterafolk.
