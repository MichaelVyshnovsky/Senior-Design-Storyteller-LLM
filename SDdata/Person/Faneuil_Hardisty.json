They met again later when he became the most prominent member of the [[City Council of Zazesspur|Council of Lords]]. Faneuil sought to restore the order within Tethyr by placing himself on the nation's throne. As it turned out, he was being used as a pawn by a creature known as the [[deepspawn]]. Allied with the Lords' Council and the bureaucracies of [[Zazesspur]], Faneuil crowned himself king and became prey for the deepspawn."
