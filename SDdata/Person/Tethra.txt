Tethra was an extra-planar fomorian who came to be in the ruins of Myth Drannor during the late 14 century DR.
The giant originally came from some other world, but ultimately ended up in Myth Drannor after passing through a portal caused by its unstable mythal. It then resided in the north-west part of the city, near the Burial Glen.
