'''Elandra of the Flail''' was a [[banshee]] enslaved by [[Manshoon|Orbakh]] in [[Westgate]] around [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Elandra was a priestess of [[Hoar]] who, together with her lover Sir [[Peregrim]], fought the [[Night Masks]]. However, during the battle, Peregrim feared for his life and fled. Elandra was captured and killed and Orbakh turned her into a banshee. Elandra was later used to power the Night Masks' secret [[Human Cattle Factory]] with Peregrim guarding her as a [[death knight]].

Around 1374 DR, an adventurer in a fight with the Night Masks destroyed Elandra to stop the Cattle Factory.
