Elandra of the Flail was a banshee enslaved by Orbakh in Westgate around 1374 DR.
Elandra was a priestess of Hoar who, together with her lover Sir Peregrim, fought the Night Masks. However, during the battle, Peregrim feared for his life and fled. Elandra was captured and killed and Orbakh turned her into a banshee. Elandra was later used to power the Night Masks secret Human Cattle Factory with Peregrim guarding her as a death knight.
Around 1374 DR, an adventurer in a fight with the Night Masks destroyed Elandra to stop the Cattle Factory.
