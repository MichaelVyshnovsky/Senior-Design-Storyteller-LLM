        "mainbody": "Scales was a fighter who worked as a bouncer at the Dusty Rat bar in Amn.\nScales was an unscrupulous man who did not care about whether people died in his money-making schemes. He made a false claim of draconic heritage, namely that one grandparent of his was a dragon.\nScales was a fighter who was trained in the use of the spiked chain and various combat maneuvers.\nScales owned several magic items. Namely, he owned a +2 scale mail, +1 spiked chain, and two potions of cure moderate wounds.\nScales was a member of the trio with Baldy Spryth and Destiny, who ran the Dusty Rat portal scam. They spread a rumor that the Dusty Rat bar had a portal that went to another dimension. They charged a fee for its usage and collected all the equipment of people who used it, which was left behind due to the creature-only nature of the Dusty Rat portal. He worked as the bouncer of the Dusty Rat bar where the portal was located.\nAs mentioned above, Scales was part of the trio that ran the aforementioned scam. None of them saw a moral problem with it.\nScales came into contact with Baldy and Destiny some time in the 14 century DR. By that point, Baldy was already quite successful by means of his scam with the portal."
