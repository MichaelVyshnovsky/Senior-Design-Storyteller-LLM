        "mainbody": "'''Scales''' was a [[fighter]] who worked as a bouncer at the [[Dusty Rat bar]] in [[Amn]].",
        "Personality": "Scales was an unscrupulous man who did not care about whether people died in his money-making schemes. He made a false claim of draconic heritage, namely that one grandparent of his was a [[dragon]].",
        "Abilities": "Scales was a fighter who was trained in the use of the [[spiked chain]] and various combat maneuvers.",
        "Possessions": "Scales owned several [[magic item]]s. Namely, he owned a ''+2 [[scale mail]]'', ''+1 [[spiked chain]]'', and two ''[[potion]]s of [[cure moderate wounds]]''.",
        "Activities": "Scales was a member of the trio with [[Baldy Spryth]] and [[Destiny]], who ran the ''[[Dusty Rat portal]]'' scam. They spread a rumor that the Dusty Rat bar had a ''[[portal]]'' that went to another dimension. They charged a fee for its usage and collected all the equipment of people who used it, which was left behind due to the creature-only nature of the ''Dusty Rat portal''. He worked as the bouncer of the Dusty Rat bar where the ''portal'' was located.",
        "Relationships": "As mentioned above, Scales was part of the trio that ran the aforementioned scam. None of them saw a moral problem with it.",
        "History": "Scales came into contact with Baldy and Destiny some time in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. By that point, Baldy was already quite successful by means of his scam with the ''portal''."
