They were forced from their hideout by the Night Brigade under Storna Harnwood, who turned it into a Temple of Shar. After being driven to the exterior of the prison where the Purple Dragons made their base, Neese helped organize a counterattack with the surviving Rats, specifically targeting the enemy officer Karissa the Knife, who made a habit of dwelling underground and hoarding treasure. Thanks to Neese, Karissas hideout in the Wheloon sewers was found and the greedy Master Thief killed."
