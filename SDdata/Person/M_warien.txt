==Possessions==
M'warien's most significant possession was the Eye of Xxiphu, the powerful fragment of the destroyed [[aboleth]] city [[Xxiphu]]. He tried to protect it from all others, even while it subtly manipulated him and drove him to madness. 

Like other morkoths, M'warien kept a large and eclectic collection of items and creatures on his island. He kept some items of his collection in cylinders made from [[glass]]. His collection included:
* A valuable tooth-shaped [[diamond]] containing the mad soul of the adventurer [[Black Dougal]].{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of Xxiphu|8}}
* A [[tome of understanding]] that could drive its owner to paranoia.{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of Xxiphu|12}}
* Two [[mummies]] decorated with many [[citrine]]s.
* The corpses of two [[hill giant]]s, which he had performed experiments on.{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of Xxiphu|9}}
* An illusion replicating [[Wonko|Wonko the Magnificent]], a ticket-puncher whose decaying body M'warien also kept.{{Cite adventurers league/The Mysterious Isle|12}}
* The [[Toga of Zagyg]], a non-magical [[toga]] that gave the appearance of great power.
* A [[magic]] red [[apple]] from another plane that could provide powerful healing.
* A magic white apple from another plane that was incredibly [[poison|poisonous]].
* A very large [[pearl]] that was once the heart of M'warien's island before he replaced it with the Eye of Xxiphu.
* Many purple [[crystal golem]]s in which he trapped the consciousnesses of [[humanoid]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of Xxiphu|10}}

==Activities==
M'warien was a reclusive creature who lived in a chamber at the center of his large personal island.{{Cite adventurers league/The Mysterious Isle|12}} whereupon it stayed in the [[Sea of Swords]]. From within his island, M'warien lured in creatures to perform experiments on.

==History==
M'warien had a history of being subjugated by aboleths. After Xxiphu was destroyed, M'warien recovered the Eye of Xxiphu deep in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. He recognized its potential to create another Xxiphu, and used its power to ward his island and hide the Eye away. The Eye's power corrupted his island, drove M'warien mad and allowed him to be discovered by those wanting to claim the Eye for themselves. The [[cloud giant]] Lord [[Dworkin]], tempted by the Eye, attacked M'warien's isle from a [[cloud palace|floating castle]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Mysterious Isle|7}} In the chaos, M'warien's isle was also invaded by an aboleth, [[sahuagin]], members of the [[Kraken Society]], and [[sea elves]] led by their Princess [[Iridansa]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Mysterious Isle|8}} 

M'warien used his crystal golems to defend his lair from the invaders, but he was overwhelmed by Dworkin's forces. Dworkin used a magical [[rod]] to disable the powers of the Eye of Xxiphu and steal it for himself. M'warien became distraught and violent at the loss of the Eye.{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of Xxiphu|11}}
