Foharell was a sea captain and a worshiper of Umberlee who prayed at the Water Queens House in Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Foharell was a dwarvish man with a charcoal gray skin tone, extremely uncommon among gold dwarves like he. The captain had cold gray eyes, bushy white beard and kept his head clean-shaven. Foharell wore a simple leather armor.
Circa the , during the Absolute crisis, Captain Foharell frequented the Water Queens House, uttering prayers to her goddess. He was at the temple shortly after one of its priestesses, Holli Dylford, drowned whilst swimming in the Gray Harbor. Foharell thought it to be a good luck to appease the goddess after a drowning.
