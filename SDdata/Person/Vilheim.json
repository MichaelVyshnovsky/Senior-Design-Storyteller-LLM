        "mainbody": "Vilheim Baltson was a native of Chessenta. He was a paladin of Torm when, during the Time of Troubles, he lost connection with his god, (when Torm was killed by Bane in Tantras). Feeling abandoned, he retreated to the Great Glacier to live as hermit. However, in 1366, he agreed to help the Harper Martine in fighting the Ice devil Vreesar."
