Kamburan was a Waterdhavian merchant in the late 14 century DR.
In early spring of the , Kamburan was in debt to the moneylender Caethur and met with him and five other debtors in a room overlooking Jembril Street. He made the payment to Caethur, but was later slain by the moneylender anyway, as he was a witness to his murder of Aldurl Nael.
Kamburan had a white beard. During the meeting in which he was slain, he wore a flame-silk overtunic.
To Caethur at least, Kamburan had too sharp a tongue.
As of his last meeting, he was carrying a small, glossy-polished wooden chest with seven beljurils inside.
