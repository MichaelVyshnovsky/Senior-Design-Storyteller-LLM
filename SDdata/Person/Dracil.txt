Dracil was a dwarf who lived within the Forest of Amtar in Dambrath.
Dracil was the leader of the nefarious adventuring group known as Dracils Raiders. His group preyed upon smaller caravans who traveled the Traders Way to the east of the great forest.
Dracil owned a short sword of speed. This sword was a sentient weapon that allowed him to fly for up to one hour per day.
