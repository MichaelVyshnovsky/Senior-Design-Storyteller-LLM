'''Brianne Byndraeth''' was one of the [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lord of Waterdeep]] who served during the mid–to–late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
As a [[sorcerer]] Brianne knew a wide variety of [[spell]]s including ''[[detect magic]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Burning Questions|6}} ''[[flaming sphere]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Burning Questions|2}} ''[[gust of wind]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Suspicion!|21}} ''[[lightning bolt]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Burning Questions|14}} [[shield (spell)|''shield'']], ''[[stinking cloud]]'', ''[[summon monster]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Death and the Dragon's Eye|15-17}} and ''[[telekinesis]]''.<ref>{{Cite comic/Suspicion!|22}}

==Relationships==
Brianne was married to her fellow lord, and master criminal, [[Carril Byndraeth]]. Their marriage and subsequent estrangement caused many troubles. The rift that was opened between the two just before Carril's death nearly caused the split of the Lords into two factions.

==History==
In the early 1350s DR, Lord Carril was killed by a [[black dragon]] in human form. Brianne played the role of a respectable Waterdhavian widow for a long time, courted by many men wanting to marry for her wealth. She used this position to spy upon them on the orders of the Lords.

By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, she became engaged to the socialite [[wizard]] [[Randulaith]] of [[Mirabar]].

==Residence==
Brianne had her own tower in the Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]], but also spent time at [[Byndraeth Estate]] outside the city proper.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|12}}
