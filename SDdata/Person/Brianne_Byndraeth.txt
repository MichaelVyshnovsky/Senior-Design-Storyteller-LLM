Brianne Byndraeth was one of the Masked Lord of Waterdeep who served during the mid–to–late 14 century DR.
As a sorcerer Brianne knew a wide variety of spells including detect magic, flaming sphere, gust of wind, lightning bolt, shield, stinking cloud, summon monster, and telekinesis.
Brianne was married to her fellow lord, and master criminal, Carril Byndraeth. Their marriage and subsequent estrangement caused many troubles. The rift that was opened between the two just before Carrils death nearly caused the split of the Lords into two factions.
In the early 1350s DR, Lord Carril was killed by a black dragon in human form. Brianne played the role of a respectable Waterdhavian widow for a long time, courted by many men wanting to marry for her wealth. She used this position to spy upon them on the orders of the Lords.
By the , she became engaged to the socialite wizard Randulaith of Mirabar.
Brianne had her own tower in the Waterdeeps North Ward, but also spent time at Byndraeth Estate outside the city proper.
