        "mainbody": "'''Korlasz''' was a [[wizard]] who came from a family that worshiped the deities of the [[Dead Three]]. As a devout follower of [[Bhaal]] and a devotee of [[Sarevok Anchev]], Korlasz played a significant role in the [[Bhaalspawn]]'s attempted coup of the [[Council of Four]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Korlasz did not have the same leadership qualities as Sarevok, though tried in earnest to lead.",
        "Relationships": "Korlasz's mother was a [[mage]] and her father was a devout Bhaalite [[priest]].\n\nShe was a trusted disciple of Sarevok and even served as a sort of confidant. Korlasz even offered him her family's crypt to him as a secure headquarters from which he could carry out his plans.",
        "History": "When Bhaal died during the [[Avatar Crisis]], in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Korlasz shifted her devotion to the Maiden of Pain, [[Loviatar]]. This was done as a temporary measure however, as she re-dedicated herself to aiding Bhaal's return to the [[Faerûnian pantheon|pantheon]].\n\nA decade later, in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Korlasz offered resources to Sarevok during his brief rise to power in Baldur's Gate. She was trusted enough to oversee his followers when it was required for him to leave the city.\n\nAfter his death, Korlasz and Sarevok's other disciples could not flee Baldur's Gate, due to the large number of refugees sought shelter from the [[Shining Crusade]]. She arranged for the theft of Sarevok's ''[[Sword of Chaos]]'' from the [[Ducal Palace]], in order to sell it to an [[Jon Irenicus|anonymous party]] in [[Athkatla]] and fund their escape to [[Zazesspur]]. While she managed to get the greatsword onto a ship to [[Amn]], she was thwarted by the [[Hero of Baldur's Gate]], who just a matter of days prior slew Sarevok himself."
