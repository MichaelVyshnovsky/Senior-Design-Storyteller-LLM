        "mainbody": "'''Goran of Tethyr''' was a mercenary recruiter in [[Tethyr]].",
        "Activities": "Goran was the best-known recruiter of Tethyr with a staff of six fighters and thieves to help him. Usually people conscripted by Goran can't abandon his company: those who escaped earned Goran's anger. Goran can create units of infantry, cavalry, and archers. However there a big difference in the efficiency of those groups: the infantry was only a disorganized mass of mostly inexperience people, the cavalry on opposite was a disciplinate group but only thank to their commanding officers, the archers were an enigma, Goran knew nothing about archery, so their efficiency depended from the individual abilities of the recruits.",
        "Personality": "Goran cared nothing about how ruled Tethyr, but remembered well the groups that not payed him well, like the city of [[Ithmong]]."
