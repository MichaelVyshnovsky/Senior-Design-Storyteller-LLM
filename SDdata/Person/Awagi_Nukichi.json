        "mainbody": "'''Awagi Nukichi''' was a writer of biographies in [[Kara-Tur]].\n\nA copy of Awagi's biography of Emperor [[Joon Tsao Choo]]—an apparent conflation of the ancient emperors [[Kujawa]] and [[Tan Chin]]—was kept in the biography reference section of the [[Great Library of Perpustakaan]] by ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}. It covered Tan Chin's corruption and the destruction of [[Kuo Meilan]], as well as made mention of the later destruction of [[Tempat Larang]].While ''Ronin Challenge'' makes several references to Joon Tsao Choo, Awagi's biography on page 67 is clearly that of the already-established Tan Chin, retelling his fall at Kuo Meilan and appending a disaster striking Tempat Larang a few years afterward. While Joon Tsao Choo could have been Tan Chin completely, ''The Grand History of the Realms'' later retconned this, inventing the much-earlier Anok-Imaskar, placing the settlement and destruction of Tempat Larang within its time, Kujawa's death 170 years later, and Tan Chin's empire centuries after that. Thus, in-universe, Awagi's story appears to be a mistaken conflation of the falls of both empires and emperors."
