{{Quote|There shall come a time when our city and its deepwater bay shall grow in fame and fortune across many realms and many worlds. Folk shall know of Waterdeep, our City of Splendors, and sing its praises. I have seen it thus, and I endeavor to make it true.|Ahghairon, ''circa'' [[1032 DR]]''}}

==Personality==
Ahghairon was known by several names during his youth, but went by only his first name during his time in Waterdeep.

==History==
{{quote|The original splendors of Waterdeep were Ahghairon's secrets, which keep us safe today and always, despite the predations of lesser so-called lords.|[[Agnan Crohal]], ''[[Tales Told Tavernside]]'', [[1268 DR]]}}<br/>
Ahghairon was born on [[Midsummer]]'s Night, in the {{YearlinkName|920}}.

===The Trollwars===
The [[Trollwars#Second Trollwar|Second Trollwar]] broke out in [[940 DR]], as [[troll]]s were pushed down into the area later known as the [[Evermoors|Trollmoors]] by [[orc]] uprisings further north. After a decade of battles, a young Ahghairon distinguished himself, using his magic to turn the war against the trolls. First, the Waterdhavian defenders drove the trolls back from their walls. The human realms then united under Ahghairon, War Captain [[Aeroth of Silverymoon]], and [[Samular Caradoon]] of [[Tyr]], and together they eradicated trolls across the Evermoors, with war finally coming to an end in [[952 DR]].<ref name=GHR>

At some point during the 940's DR, Aghairon was in [[Waterdeep]], at the time called Nimoar's Hold. Fires set to hold of the trolls threatened to destroy a large part of the town, so Aghairon asked adventurers to find and bring him [[Halaster Blackcloak|Halaster]]'s wards to bolster a ritual that would allow him to stop the fires. (More info about this adventure can be found in [[Hero of the Troll Wars]])

A third Trollwar almost took place in [[963 DR]], when the traitors [[Aviss]] and [[Fellandar]] led an army of trolls out of the [[Mere of Dead Men]] against the city. They knew well the city's defenses, and [[Castle Waterdeep]] had only just begun construction. But Ahghairon and a band of [[wizard]]s hurled Aviss and Fellandar into an extra-dimensional prison, thwarting the attack.{{Cite comic/Summer in the City|16}} <ref group="note">The comic "[[Summer in the City]]" actually refers to "great Aglairon", but by the context it seems clear this is meant to be Ahghairon.

===Rise to Power===
At this time, Waterdeep was ruled by the Warlord [[Rhaulor]], who wanted to use the city's power and wealth to create an empire spanning [[northwest Faer√ªn]]. Ahghairon strongly disagreed with this, and when he voiced his concerns, Rhaulor attacked him. Ahghairon  used his magic to turn Rhaulor's sword into a snake, which bit and poisoned him. Rhaulor died and Ahghairon assumed control of Waterdeep, proclaiming himself the first Open Lord, and establishing a form of government involving Masked Lords, whose identities would remain private.

===Rule===
In [[1007 DR]], Ahghairon constructed his [[Ahghairon's Tower|wizard tower]], but positioned it outside the walls of Waterdeep (which since expanded). At the same time, he imposed magical barriers on [[Halaster's Hold]], which prevented the possibility of any dangers escaping into the city. He created a magical axe named ''[[Azuredge]]'' in [[1026 DR]].

===Death===
Ahghairon used ''[[potion of longevity|potions of longevity]]'' to remain in prime physical form even though he was growing old by human standards. Eventually, his health failed in [[1256 DR]], and he died and was buried in his tower in Waterdeep. The tower was sealed off and protected by magic, and it was believed that his resting place remained undisturbed ever since.
