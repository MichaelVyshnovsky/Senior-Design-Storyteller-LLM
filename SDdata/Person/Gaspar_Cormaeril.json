        "mainbody": "'''Gaspar Cormaeril''' was a young member of the [[Cormaeril]] noble house of [[Cormyr]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Gaspar met with High Wizard [[Vangerdahast]] to discuss the appointment of Vangerdahast as regent. Gaspar agreed to give his support on the conditions that Vangerdahast appointed a council of a dozen or so noble houses, mostly at Gaspar's selection, with the voting power to overrule Vangerdahast himself, and that Vangerdahast's own vote would be directed by the Cormaeril house. Gaspar then assumed control of the house by having [[Ohlmer Cormaeril]] assassinated, and also had [[Sorgar Illance]] assassinated.\n\nGaspar was himself killed later that year by [[Aunadar Bleth]] to power the [[abraxus]] as part of the [[abraxus affair]]."
