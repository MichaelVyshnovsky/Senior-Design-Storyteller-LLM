        "History": "Jhassalan hailed from [[Silverymoon]] in [[Luruar]] but departed to become an adventurer. With the [[Guild of the Just]], a party of Tyrrans, he attacked the [[House of Pain]], a temple of [[Loviatar]] in [[Undermountain]], in order to free captives, but they were ambushed by the Loviatans. Jhassalan escaped only after the intervention of [[Muiral the Misshapen]].\n\nFrom that time, he devoted himself fully to Tyr and led the spellcasting forces of the [[Hall of Justice]] in [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Personality": "Jhassalan retained his hatred for the local [[Church of Loviatar]], hoping one day to uncover the source of their funds. His namesake derived from his predilection for electricity spells."
