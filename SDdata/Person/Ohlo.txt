Ohlo was a human mage who lived in the slums of Phlan circa 1340 DR.
Ohlo made his residence in an elegantly paneled space, which had pieces of furniture in it. He often sat by his table close to the eastern wall, writing things down. He dressed in typical wizards attire a purple robe and a pointed hat.
He only seemed to care for anyone whom he had a use for. Otherwise, he would look sternly at them, or even attack if someone "presumed too much".
The mage owned a wand of magic missiles and a large amount of coin.
Despite a section of Phlan becoming civilized, Ohlo decided to stay in the eastern part of the slums, where he commanded a large group of orcs and bugbears. In 1340 DR, he ordered a special potion from the Old Rope Guild, but could not fetch it due to other duties. This potion had the power to reduce the age, whilst at the same time increasing the strength, of the imbiber. Thus, Ohlo asked a new group of adventurers to fetch the potion for him from a booth in the southeast of the guild. The confirmation word to the vendor was his own name. If they returned with the potion and handed it over, the mage planned on rewarding the party with platinum, jewelry, and an enchanted piece of equipment, otherwise he planned on attacking them.
