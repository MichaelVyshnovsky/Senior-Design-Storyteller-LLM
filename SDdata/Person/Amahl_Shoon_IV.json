        "Activities": "Beginning with the death of his own brother, [[Shoon III]], Amahl Shoon IV assassinated anyone who bothered him. He killed the lowliest slaves to the entire ruling class of the city of [[Manshaka]]. In his last two years as emperor alone, he had more than 200 nobles assassinated. He also oppressed the various religions of the Empire. Like Emperor [[Shoon II]] before him, he persecuted the [[Ilmatari]] especially severely.",
        "Relationships": "Amahl IV was the younger brother of Shoon III and the older brother of [[Amahl Shoon V]].",
        "Possessions": "Amahl had a pair of prized possessions: his ''[[Silver Scimitar of Amahl the Mad|Silver Scimitar]]'' and his ''[[Amahl's Mastering|Mastering]]''. The ring, one of the powerful ''[[Qysari Rings]]'' of the Shoon Imperium, gave him the ability to harm or cast spells upon wearers of other ''[[shoonring]]s'' and unlocked special attack and defense abilities in the ''Silver Scimitar''. Amahl's sword and ring, and the hand that bore them, were strangely never recovered from the [[River Agis]] after Amahl's death, even after over 100 years of searching.",
        "History": "When his older brother came to power in [[123 DR]], Amahl IV was appointed Caleph of [[Calimshan]]. He lusted after power and desired his elder brother's position, so he murdered him one day during a feast in Shoon III's harem in [[130 DR]] and took the crown.\n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| width  = \n| text   = The necessary arrangements have been made.<br />Expect for the distraction to occur late in the evening.

        "Trivia": "Despite his brother's madness, in [[194 DR]], Amahl V commission a statue of Amahl IV to be erected in the [[Bakkal Sabban]] of [[Calimport]] as part of the [[Fountain of the Qysars]], a monument to the first seven rulers of the Shoon. Amahl IV's statue was the one on the north side of the octagonal palisade."
