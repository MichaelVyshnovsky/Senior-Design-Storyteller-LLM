'''Florenta the Garrotter''', or simply '''Flo''', was a servant of [[Zariel]] and an old friend of hero [[Karlach Cliffgate]], during her time in the [[Nine Hells]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When Karlach Cliffgate was forced into servitude to the [[archdevil]] Zariel, she found a friend in Florenta the Garrotter. When  Karlach escaped the Hells in the {{YearlinkName|1492}} abroad a ''[[spelljammer]]'' ship, Florenta sent [[sulphur]]-reeking notes to [[Toril]]. One such note that found Karlach talked about [[Fruug]] and his [[imp]], who got stuck in a [[butter]] barrel and plummeted into a volcano to Florenta's amusement. Flo's laugh irritated Zariel enough to send her out of the room.
