'''Shyael Ildacer''' was a High Mage during the [[Weeping War|Fall of Myth Drannor]].

==History==
Shyael was born in {{Yearlink|-227}} and was for many years a High Court Mage.

In [[667 DR]], after the death of [[Eltargrim Irithyl]] and his niece [[Aravae Irithyl]], and the disappearance of the [[Srinshee]], Shyael called a council of nobles and representative members of each of the races living in [[Myth Drannor]] to discuss how to rule the city from that point on. This became the early [[Council of Twelve]] and Shyael was granted a seat in it.

In [[685 DR]], Shyael formed a new group called the [[Eternal Srinnala]], devoted to following the teachings of the Srinshee. They hoped to gather around them the common folk of the city and believed fully in the Srinshee's prophecy that one day the archwizards would come back and a new coronal would emerge. The group soon became very popular and influential, gathering more than 100 wizards among [[elves]], [[half-elves]], and [[human]]s, mostly female.

During the [[Weeping War]], Shyael led her fellows in the defense of the city, fighting valorously in the [[Battle at Silversgate]] at [[Tarsakh 11]]–[[Tarsakh 13|13]] of [[712 DR]] and collaborating with both the [[N'Vaelahr]] and the [[Akh'Faer]] in some missions. However, after the catastrophic [[Mezzoloth Marches]] of [[Eleasias]]–[[Marpenoth]] of [[713 DR]], more than half of Shyael's followers decided to gather as much hidden magic as possible and left [[Cormanthyr]].

Shyael however died in the city's fall in [[714 DR]].

==Relationship==
Shyael greatly respected and admired her teacher the Srinshee. She was the fourth sister of [[Myriil Ildacer VI]], the elder of [[Ildacer House]].
