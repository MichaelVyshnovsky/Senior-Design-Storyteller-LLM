'''Asborn Moonstar''' was a young and desperate nobleman from [[Waterdeep]], member of the [[Moonstar (family)|Moonstar]] family in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In early [[1370 DR]], Asborn Moonstar and [[Elene Ruldegost]] fell mindlessly in love with each other, despite their families' old animosity. When the youths decided to tie the knot, both families were against even the mere idea of that union, but the [[Ruldegost]]s agreed to permit the marriage if Asborn were to retrieve a [[crystal rose]] from [[Undermountain]]. These roses grew in one place, the [[Garden of the Drow]], thought long abandoned. Asborn ran straight to the [[Yawning Portal]] and plunged into the dungeon.

The young Moonstar had been missing for over a week when [[Khelben Arunsun]] asked his trusted agent to find the youth in the abandoned [[drow]] monastic retreat. When [[Khelbenite]] made his way to the cave of the Garden. It became evident that the dark residents of the retreat were back, and it did not bode well for Asborn. Subsequently, the adventurer came across a sealed room with serene-looking springs, plants, [[mushroom]]s, and a single crystal rose growing in the center. Next to the delicate flower, the hero found the tattered remains of Asborn Moonstar. He was able to sneak past the drow into the rose chamber but was discovered and sealed inside, and the young man starved to death. There was nothing else to be done; Khelbenite collected the crystal flower and delivered it to Elene Ruldegost so she would have something by which to remember her departed lover.
