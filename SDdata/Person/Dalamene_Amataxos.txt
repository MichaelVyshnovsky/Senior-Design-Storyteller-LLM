Dalamene Amataxos was an Eveningstar resident of Cormyr during the mid-1480s DR.
She had shoulder-length red hair and gray eyes.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, her neighbor Dylle Madanset wished to flee Eveningstar and let the drow have it and the Thread of the Weave they sought. Dalamene disagreed and argued with him on the subject.
