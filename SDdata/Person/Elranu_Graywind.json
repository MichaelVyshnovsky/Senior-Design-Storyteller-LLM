One of the master crafter harps, simply known as an ''[[elven harp of Elranu]]'', was uncovered in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR in the mountains of the [[Vast]], among the treasures of a band of [[giant]]s. This instrument was a unique [[mohagony]] [[harp]] decorated with detailed carvings of [[unicorn]]s with eyes of inlaid white [[sapphire]]s and [[holy]] vines with berries of tiny [[rubies]]. The masterpiece was valued at 5,000 [[gold]] [[coin]]s."
