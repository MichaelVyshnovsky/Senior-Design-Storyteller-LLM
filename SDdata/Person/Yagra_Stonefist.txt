'''Yagra Stonefist'''<ref group="note">Page 21 of ''[[Waterdeep: Dragon Heist]]'' refers to Yagra's last name as "Strongfist". Since her all other mentions from that source call her by the last name "Stonefist", we assume that this one instance was in error. ({{Pronounce|YAG|raw|refs=}}) was a [[Zhentarim]] mercenary at the [[Yawning Portal]] around [[1492 DR]].{{Waterdeep-time}}

==Activities==
Yagra worked for the Zhentarim to protect [[Davil Starsong]]. In her spare time, she enjoyed wrestling with adventurers at the inn.

If adventurers sympathetic to Zhent objectives or who were enemies of the [[Xanathar]] approached Yagra, she could arrange a meeting for them with Davil.

==History==
In 1492 DR, Yagra was seen riding a carriage with Davil Starsong in the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]] of Waterdeep. Later, she learned from someone with ties to the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]] (while they were intoxicated) about a back door to the [[beholder]]'s lair in [[Waterdeep/Sewers|the sewers]] of [[Castle Ward]].

Some time later, Yagra was involved in a brawl with some of the Xanathar's agents led by [[Krentz]], but soon also became involved with some adventurers and/or [[Durnan]]. 

Later, after Davil's arrest, Yagra's new boss was [[Tashlyn Yafeera]].

==Personality==
Yagra was bored by her work and enjoyed wrestling.
