I'm going to love seeing the look on his face when he finds out! Lord High-And-Mighty Blackstaff looked sick enough for the both of them when he came to the door. Aye, that was him—for once the tavern-lasses told you true! Seems Maerj went to him for a spell to let her have the Old Meddler's child under his nose, so to speak, and Khelben threw her out of his tower . . . only to come to the door like a beggar half a day later, with a face as long as last winter and a scroll in his hand. He said Divine Mystra herself granted—and commanded—it!''|Goraun|}}",

        "History": "Goraun was one of Maerjanthra Shalace's apprentices while she was alive. He was working under her since at least approximately {{yearlink|1351}}, the birth of [[Narnra Shalace]], who was twenty or twenty-two years old in {{yearlink|1373}}. At that time, he was a witness to Maerjanthra's plot to bear [[Elminster Aumar]] a child, on which she was aided by [[Khelben Arunsun]], who under duress from the goddess [[Mystra]] gave her a potion to override Elminster's control over his own fertility. He recounted this to Jonczer.\n\nShortly after Maerjanthra's death, Goraun disappeared after a break-in killed his fellow apprentice [[Rorgel]]."
