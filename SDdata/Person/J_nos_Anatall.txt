János Anatall was an assassin from the Barovian village of Vallaki who was under the employ of Esmae Amarantha in the 15 century DR, a woman whose ritualistic plans threatened to permanently trap within the Domains of Dread the lands and people of Phlan that had been sucked into Barovia.
János kept a journal hidden under his mattress. This contained details on all the murders he committed for Esmae, a general explanation of the Evening Glory faith, and his many childish attempts at writing romantic poetry.
While under the employ of Esmae, János came to live within one of the guardrooms of the ruined Boszórkan Keep. Over time he became enraptured by both her beauty and power, worshiping her from afar. Following Esmaes merging with the vestige Evening Glory, his devotion to her grew stronger and he longed for the day he would die in her service so that he may be reborn as an undead servant.
János did not believe that Tatyana, a woman who Esmae sought to merge with, was as beautiful as her. Yet he still vowed to love Esmae even after she took on Tatyanas likeness.
