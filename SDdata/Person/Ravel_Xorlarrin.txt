'''Ravel Xorlarrin''' was a [[wizard]] of [[House Xorlarrin]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]] and a leader of the Xorlarrin expedition to [[Gauntlgrym]] in the {{YearlinkName|1463}}. He and [[Tiago Baenre]] were considered the most promising of Menzoberranzan's young males.

==Description==
Ravel had long white hair. He wore purple robes and, like most drow nobles, he wore magical boots that could clack noisily or be silenced at will. He also wore a small silver chain that closed the collar of his ''[[piwafwi]]''.

==History==
===Gauntlgrym Expedition===
In the {{YearlinkName|1463}}, Ravel snuck behind [[Gromph Baenre]] while he was working on a [[skull gem]] and learned about the abandoned [[dwarven]] settlement of [[Gauntlgrym]] and the [[primordial]] that powered the Forge. (Unbeknownst to him, Ravel and the expedition had in fact been prompted by [[House Baenre]].) Ravel reported that information to [[Matron Mother]] Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin, who assigned him to lead an expedition of House Xorlarrin troops to Gauntlgrym to scout it out and determine whether it would be a suitable place for House Xorlarrin to build their own city. The expedition successfully occupied Gauntlgrym and retook the Forge.

===The Darkening===
With the newly restored [[House Do'Urden]] representing [[Quenthel Baenre]]'s attempt on the [[Silver Marches]], Ravel accompanied [[Tos'un Armgo|Tos'un]] and [[Doum'wielle Armgo]], and the [[orc]] [[Hartusk]] on a tour of the orc forces on the surface in the {{YearlinkName|1484}}. It was rumored that Ravel was to become House Do'Urden's house wizard in place of [[Tsabrak Xorlarrin]], whom Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin was keeping close at hand in Q'Xorlarrin.

==Skills==
Ravel was skilled at [[illusion]]s.

==Possessions==
Ravel had a fancy [[dagger]] made by the famed blacksmith [[Gol'fanin]].

==Relationships==
===House Xorlarrin===
[[Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin]] was Ravel's mother. [[Brack'thal Xorlarrin]] was both Ravel's older brother and his sire. Ravel and [[Tsabrak Xorlarrin]], the house wizard, were bitter rivals.

===House Baenre===
Ravel was friends with [[Tiago Baenre]]. He was a favored student of [[Gromph Baenre]] while he studied [[magic]] at [[Sorcere]].
