        "mainbody": "ruenor Battlehammer I was a dwarf of Clan Battlehammer and the 2 King of Mithral Hall, and the namesake of the more widely known 8 and 10 king of Mithral Hall, Bruenor Battlehammer.\nHe was the youngest of Gandalug Battlehammers three sons, and inherited the throne despite not being the oldest but rather the most fitting. Bruenor led a thousand dwarves of the clan to Mithral Hall and commenced work on building the Undercity.\nTowards the end of his life, Bruenor faked his death so he could abdicate his throne and go on a final adventure free of responsibility.\nIt was his personal battle armor that became the official royal armor of all future Battlehammer kings."
