        "mainbody": "'''Fastrin the Delver''' was a powerful [[wizard]] and the benevolent ruler of an ancient kingdom in the [[Sunrise Mountains]] in [[East Faerûn]], who went mad after uncovering an ancient [[artifact]]. He ruled the kingdom for a time during the age of [[Netheril]], prior to the [[Dale Reckoning]].<ref group=\"note\">[[Unclean]] refers to the existence of Fastrin's kingdom during a time \"not so very long after the fall of Netheril\" whereas [[Undead (novel)|Undead]] states the fall of the kingdom occured \"when Netheril was young\".",
        "Activities": "For most of his life, Fastrin worked magical wonders for his subjects, and provided council to the realm's lords. He was skilled in [[the Art]], exceptionally clever,",
        "History": "One day, Fastrin uncovered a nearly ageless, red [[book]] dating back to the earliest ages of [[Toril]], from within an ancient tomb in the Sunrise Mountains. Within the tome were the specifics outlining the ''[[ritual of Unmaking]]'', that could destroy all life on [[Toril]] and beyond. After this discovery, Fastrin withdrew from his people and secluded himself from his people. Those that did encounter the powerful mage reported him as being deeply troubled.\n\nAt some point, someone stole the ancient ritual book from Fastrin, an act that eliminated what was left of his sanity. In the summer of that year, Fastrin embarked upon the systematic slaughter of the people he once served so well. Over the course of weeks he destroyed one community after another, deforming the minds and souls of his murdered countrymen. The knights of the kingdom stood against Fastrin, but to no avail. \n\nFastrin believed the only solution to prevent the Unmaking from being unleashed upon existence was to kill anyone and everyone who could have possibly taken the ritual book he had uncovered. Once his rampage was over, the mage-ruler killed himself in the same manner he had devastated his kingdom."
