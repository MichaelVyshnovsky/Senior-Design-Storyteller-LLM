'''Elvandaruil''' was an ancient [[elven]] princess.

==Legacy==
In {{yearlink|241}}, her bracelets were kept in the [[Vault of Ages]]. She was at that time more than 3,000 years dead, after the failure of her flight spell over the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]; these bracelets were all that was left of her, recovered after they washed up on the shore of [[Ambral Isle]].
