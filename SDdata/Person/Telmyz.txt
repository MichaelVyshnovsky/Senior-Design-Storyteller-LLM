}}'''Telmyz''' was a priest of [[Vhaeraun]].

==History==
In [[1377 DR]], Telmyz was one of the six [[nightshadow]]s chosen for an assault led by [[KÃ¢ras]] on the main temple of [[Kiaransalee]].

Together with the [[conjurer]] [[Mazeer]], he was [[polymorph]]ed into an insect when a sudden flood hit them, them killing Telmyz.
