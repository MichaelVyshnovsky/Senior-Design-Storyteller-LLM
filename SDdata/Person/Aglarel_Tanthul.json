        "mainbody": "Prince Aglarel Tanthul was one of the twelve original Princes of Shade, the sons of Telamont Tanthul that came to Faerûn on the eve of the Return in the late 14 century DR.\nAglarel was said to have been as large as a bugbear with dark, shadowy skin and eyes that gleamed like gems.\nHe had no interest in attaining more personal power and did not abide political maneuvering and games.\nAfter the city of Thultanthar returned to the skies over Anauroch, Aglarel took command over his fathers personal bodyguard, believing that he would undoubtedly be the target of an assassination attempt.\nThe princes personal sigil was the profile of a steel blue, riveted great helm set on a field of orange.\nHe was entirely loyal to his father Telamont Tanthul above all others.\nWhen Aglarel and his brothers returned to Faerûn in the , he traveled along with Clariburnus and Escanor to the Marsh of Chelimber to slay phaerimm. There they encountered Lady Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep and began to forge an alliance against their ancestral foes from beyond the Sharn Wall.\nIn 1487 DR during the conflict against Myth Drannor Larloch shattered the minds of Aglarel and of many of Shades finest arcanists."
