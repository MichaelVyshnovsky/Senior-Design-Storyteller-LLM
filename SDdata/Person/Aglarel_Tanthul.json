        "mainbody": "Prince '''Aglarel Tanthul''' was one of the twelve original [[Princes of Shade]], the sons of [[Telamont Tanthul]] that came to [[Faerûn]] on the eve of [[the Return]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Aglarel was said to have been as large as a [[bugbear]] with dark, shadowy skin and eyes that gleamed like [[gem]]s.",
        "Personality": "He had no interest in attaining more personal power and did not abide political maneuvering and games.",
        "Activities": "After the city of [[Thultanthar]] returned to the skies over [[Anauroch]], Aglarel took command over his father's personal bodyguard, believing that he would undoubtedly be the target of an assassination attempt.",
        "Possessions": "The prince's personal sigil was the profile of a steel blue, riveted great helm set on a field of orange.",
        "Relationships": "He was entirely loyal to his father Telamont Tanthul above all others.",
        "History": "When Aglarel and [[Princes of Shade|his brothers]] returned to Faerûn in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, he traveled along with [[Clariburnus Tanthul|Clariburnus]] and [[Escanor Tanthul|Escanor]] to the [[Marsh of Chelimber]] to slay [[phaerimm]]. There they encountered Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]] of [[Waterdeep]] and began to forge an alliance against their ancestral foes from beyond the [[Sharn Wall]].\n\nIn [[1487 DR]] during the conflict against [[Myth Drannor]] [[Larloch]] shattered the minds of Aglarel and of many of [[Shade]]'s finest arcanists."
