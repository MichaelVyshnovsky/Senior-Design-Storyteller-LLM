        "mainbody": "Admiral Marianon Silmara was one of the ambassadors from the Elven Imperial Fleet to the city of Bral during the reign of Prince Andru.\nAdmiral Silmara was a very tall elf of great strength. She had black hair and a beautiful face. She often dressed in magical plate armor and wore a cloak of displacement.\nMarianon felt like she was too prestigious for her position as emissary, though she did recognize the importance of the Rock of Bral as a strategic location for the Elven Navy, and she wished for an excuse to occupy the Rock with the force of a couple of heavy spelljamming warships. She found Prince Andru both shortsighted and selfish.\nTo all outside appearances, however, Marianon was charming and witty—if a bit blunt—though she could come across as condescending to \"lesser\" races such as humans.\nMarianon was both a superb fighter and an accomplished mage. Among her most powerful spells known were globe of invulnerability and mass suggestion.\nMarianon was assisted by her chief aide, Gaeredan Celedir, who was usually found in her presence.\nMarianon owned a magical longsword and a helm of brightness, and she sometimes made use of potions of flying and undead control.\nAdmiral Silmara was a hero of the Unhuman Wars, after which she was appointed as ambassador to Bral, where she served for at least two years."
