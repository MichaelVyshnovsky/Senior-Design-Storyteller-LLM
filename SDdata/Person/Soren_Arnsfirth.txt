'''Soren Arnsfirth''' was a [[Reghedmen]] [[human]] [[warrior]] from the [[Tribe of the Elk]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Soren was a humble individual with no grasp of how [[spirit]]s, [[gods]], or [[magic]] function.

==Description==
Soren had sky-blue eyes. As of 1485 DR, he was one of the eldest warriors of the tribe.

==Relationships==
Soren had a daughter, [[Hedrun Arnsfirth|Hedrun]], who was gifted with then-unknown powers emerging and frightening the members of the Tribe of the Elk. Soren had no idea how to help his daughter. When she was cast out he didn't do anything, but years later he still hoped his daughter was alive.

Soren frequently sought the tribe [[shaman]] [[Mjenir Tormhaalt|Mjenir]]'s guidance, but each time, he left their discussions feeling frustrated because the shaman saw Hedrun as a threat to be controlled, rather than a child in need of support. Despite lacking the courage to openly challenge the shaman, Soren held a grudge against Mjenir for turning his back on the girl and expelling her from the tribe. His hesitation also revolved around the possibility that Mjenir's decision to banish Hedrun might have been justifiable. As a grieving father himself, Soren empathized with Mjenir's bitterness over the loss of his son [[Olaf Tormhaalt|Olaf]] as a result of Hedrun's uncontrollable powers.

==History==
Soren was both bewildered and fearful as his daughter Hedrun began to display peculiar abilities during her growth. He felt powerless as he observed the tribe turning its back on her, unsure of how to provide solace to his daughter or relate to her. After Mjenir's son Olaf was frozen to death because of Hedrun's powers manifesting, Soren couldn't prevent her banishment.

Around the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, Soren started to contemplate the possibility that Hedrun might have survived, as the rumors of the [[Hedrun Arnsfirth|Ice Witch]] sweeping through the [[Reghed Glacier]] began to spread. The only reason for his speculations was the father's hope that his daughter was still alive, and he didn't share these thoughts with the other members of the tribe. Soren backed Mjenir's idea of staying away from encounters with the witch as he was unwilling to witness his daughter's demise, no matter what she had become.
