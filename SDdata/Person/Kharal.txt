'''Kharal''' was a [[locathah]] [[ranger]] of the [[Tiger Coral]] tribe on the [[Hmur Plateau]] in [[Serôs]] in the [[Sea of Fallen Star]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was the mate of [[Ghuunis]].

==Personality==
Kharal did not speak much but remained always calm, with his presence often calming others. He was the only being capable of calming Ghuunis when she was angry. He grew excited only when hunting [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]], as he hated them intensely, or when playing with dolphins.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, there was new of [[kuo-toa]] slavers active in the nearby area so Ghuunis and Kharal went to deal with the problem, tracking them by scent, responses from friendly animals, and reports of missing persons near caves on the plateau. While sneaking inside the kuo-toas' cavern, they might've met some surface-dweller [[adventurer]]s also investigating them. The locathah would be suspicious that they'd give their position away, but could work with them.

==Possessions==
He fought with a [[spear]].

==Abilities==
As a ranger, he could track and empathize with animals, and specialized in opposing merrow. He prepared [[spell]]s like ''[[invisibility to animals]]'' and ''[[pass without trace]]''.
