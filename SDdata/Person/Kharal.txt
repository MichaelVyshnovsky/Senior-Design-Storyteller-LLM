Kharal was a locathah ranger of the Tiger Coral tribe on the Hmur Plateau in Ser√¥s in the Sea of Fallen Star in the late 14 century DR.
He was the mate of Ghuunis.
Kharal did not speak much but remained always calm, with his presence often calming others. He was the only being capable of calming Ghuunis when she was angry. He grew excited only when hunting merrow, as he hated them intensely, or when playing with dolphins.
In the , there was new of kuo-toa slavers active in the nearby area so Ghuunis and Kharal went to deal with the problem, tracking them by scent, responses from friendly animals, and reports of missing persons near caves on the plateau. While sneaking inside the kuo-toas cavern, they mightve met some surface-dweller adventurers also investigating them. The locathah would be suspicious that theyd give their position away, but could work with them.
He fought with a spear.
As a ranger, he could track and empathize with animals, and specialized in opposing merrow. He prepared spells like invisibility to animals and pass without trace.
