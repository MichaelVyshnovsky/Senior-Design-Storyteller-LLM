'''Moren Marr''' was a [[Dark Justiciars]] of [[Shar]] and a member of the [[Gauntlet of Shar]] in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Justiciar Marr was among hundreds of Dark Justiciars and [[Sel√ªnite]]s who died in a bitter battle between the followers of the two goddesses in the {{YearlinkName|986}}. Moren Marr was chopped in two during the battle, and the casualty was recorded in a long log of the dead penned by [[Malus Thorm]] of [[Reithwin]].

As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Moren's death was long forgotten, being just one of an endless list of the dead, stored in Malus Thorm's [[House of Healing]] in the [[Shadow-cursed Lands|shadow-cursed]] town of Reithwin.
