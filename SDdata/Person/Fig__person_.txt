'''Fig''' was an orphaned child adopted by the [[High Harper]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Jaheira]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''It is "stand and deliver," little Fig. Though... I think I like yours better. You bellow like a true [[berserker]]!''|[[Minsc]] of [[Rashemen]]}}
==Description==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Fig was a young [[human]] child with light skin tone, phone hair gathered in two buns, and large hazel eyes. Fig was a rambunctious tomboy who liked to practice her sword fighting with a wooden sword on a dummy outside and played a guard letting people into the family home.
==Relationships==
She eagerly took on the idea of the militaristic aspect of the [[Harpers]] and considered her adoptive sister [[Rion]] to be "the commander." Fig and Jaheira's old comrade Minsc shared a friendly bond.
