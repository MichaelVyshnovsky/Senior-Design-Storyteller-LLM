Fig was an orphaned child adopted by the High Harper of Baldurs Gate, Jaheira in the late 15 century DR.
In the late 15 century DR, Fig was a young human child with light skin tone, phone hair gathered in two buns, and large hazel eyes. Fig was a rambunctious tomboy who liked to practice her sword fighting with a wooden sword on a dummy outside and played a guard letting people into the family home.
She eagerly took on the idea of the militaristic aspect of the Harpers and considered her adoptive sister Rion to be "the commander." Fig and Jaheiras old comrade Minsc shared a friendly bond.
