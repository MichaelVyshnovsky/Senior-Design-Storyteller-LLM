}}The '''Destroyer''', or '''He Who Learns to Destroy''', was a [[yak-man]] who lived beneath [[Huzuz]] in the [[Lair of the Unspeakable]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|77-79}}

==Activities==
The Destroyer learned to speak [[Midani]] from a slave in the [[World Pillar Mountains]]. Since he could read and write the language, he spent much of his time studying stolen texts written in Midani. Over the years he raided all of the great mosques, save the [[Golden Mosque]], for books, amassing quit a collection. He also stole books from wizards and other libraries. Any useful information he learned was given to the [[Unspeakable]] so he could use it against the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]].

The Destroyer was able to create one of the finest libraries in all of Huzuz from his illicit ventures.

==Possessions==
The Destroyer used a ''[[staff of withering]]''.{{cite book/City of Delights/Golden Huzuz|51}}
