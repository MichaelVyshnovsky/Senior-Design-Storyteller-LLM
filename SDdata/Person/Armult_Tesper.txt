'''Armult Tesper''' was a noble and patriach of the [[Nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian noble house]] [[Tesper]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Armult trusted too easily, a trait that led to two failed marriages when he realized his wives were only after his coin. Unbeknownst to him, the ancestral [[ghost]]s of the family villa coerced the wives to leave him before causing too much harm.

==Activities==
He lived within [[Tespergates]] located at the corner of [[Mendever Street]] and [[Delzorin Street]] in the central section of [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Waterdeep}}

==History==
He spent much of his youth adventuring south of Waterdeep, earning his father's respect.

==Relationships==
Armult's current wife, a [[Harper]] named [[Nleera Tarannath Tesper]], was discovered while masquerading as one of the ancestral ghosts of Tespergates during a party. Armult grew to love the Harper, and with the ghosts' approval, eventually married her.
