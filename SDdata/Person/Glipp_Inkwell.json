        "mainbody": "Glip Inkwell was a naturalist, scholar, and author that lived in the Realms during the early to mid–15 century DR.\nGlip was an exceptionally knowledgeable and insightful individual that took pride in work and home. Glipp was quite clever as well, managing to survive alone in the wild using only wits bestowed by the gods and resources provided by nature.\nThe intrepid scholar lived atop an earthmote that floated above the Sword Coast North for nearly three years, writing down his observations about the surrounding natural world. Glipp lived in isolation from others for many months, eventually putting to paper A Treatise on Earth Motes. The treatise detailed the biological differences between various earthmotes depending on a number of factors including size and origin of species, detailing how these populations differed from those on Toril due to cultural insulation and lessened natural predation.\nGlipp wrote extensively about the local lizardfolk population, specifically how they changed after the arrival of a new and influential member of their tripe.\nGlipp originally traveled to the earthmote circa the , as a member of the pirate crew led by Bartholomew Blackdagger.While it was not explicitly stated that Glipp was a member of the Blackdagger crew that operated from Pirates Skyhold, journal entries by the scholar suggested as such. The timeline in which Glipp and the pirates dwell within the same earthmote appears to be linked, rather than mere coincidence. As Blackdagger rose in power and wealth, some of his followers grew disaffected by changing circumstances and revolted, attempting to leave what came to be known as Pirates Skyhold by means of skyship. The mutiny was quickly and violently put down. Many that revolted were killed while some others fled to the nearby swamp to live out their days alone – Glipp was one such fortunate soul.\nGlipp lived alone but not afraid for several years, at least until the , writing in part about the neighboring lizardfolk that laired near his home in the swamp. When the black dragon Garrundar the Vile took hold over the lizardfolk tribes, Glipps world changed. The lizardfolk poisoned the water of the swamp and Glipps home was no longer a safe place to live.\nEver the craft individual, Glipp formed a plan to leave the earthmote – based on written accounts – by somehow safely falling off its edge. Glipps final fate was unknown."
