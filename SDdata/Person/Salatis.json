        "mainbody": "Salatis was a senator in the city-state of Innarlith in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He became an ally of the Red Wizard Marek Rym端t, who used him to overthrow Ransar Osorkon, the ruler of the city-state in 1365 DR. Following this coup, Salatis himself became Ransar of Innarlith.  He himself was killed when Senator Pristoleph used an army to take power for himself in 1371 DR.\nHe was tall at a height of . He had a full head of grey hair. \nSalatis had a tendency to change his devotion from one deity to another very quickly. He was very religious, but often didnt follow a particular deity for long before he took up the faith of another one.\nMarek Rym端t, acting on behalf of the Red Wizards of Thay, effectively controlled Salatis once he became Ransar of Innarlith, albeit clandestinely. Salatis was well aware that he required Mareks assistance in order to keep his position in control of the city.\nAmong Salatiss allies on the senate included senators Inthelph and Meykhati.\nIn 1364 DR, Salatis and a group of other senators made a deal to advance Willem Korvan to the senate of Innarlith after the latter had secretly assassinated Senator Khonsu.\nFollowing these events, Ransar Osorkon made plans to begin construction of a canal that would connect the Lake of Steam to the Nagaflow and thus connect the Sea of Fallen Stars to the oceans of Toril. The Red Wizards would not profit from this project, as it would have greatly hurt their control of the magical portal trade that previously had been used to transport ships between either body of water.\nIn 1365 DR, Salatis was transported by Marek Rym端t to the Red Wizards pocket dimension, the Land of One Hundred and Thirteen. There he was shown an army of black firedrakes that Marek had created. Marek explained to Salatis that he intended to give the drakes to Salatis to use in order to become Ransar and in return Salatis was to obey any directions that Marek gave to him while he served as Ransar in Innarlith. Salatis agreed to the plan.\nNot long after this, Salatis and some of his allies in the senate began openly questioning and challenging Ransar Osorkon in the senate chamber regarding the canal project.\nOn Highharvestide in 1365 DR, civil unrest erupted and Salatis took the opportunity to stage a coup against Osorkon. Osorkon and his guards kept within the Ransars office in the Palace of Many Spires during the unrest. The black firedrakes, which had been polymorphed into human form as a disguise, besieged the palace and broke into the Ransars office. Salatis arrived and called on Osorkon to surrender, but Osorkon insisted on giving battle. The polymorphed black firedrakes breathed flaming acid on him and his guards, thereby killing them.\nSalatis then received confirmation from the senate to become the new Ransar of Innarlith. However, he didnt end the canal project, as he saw the benefit of it to the city-state, despite the harm it would have provided to the Red Wizards and Mareks dislike for the project. Marek eventually changed his position on the canal as he realized it would be impossible to stop it from being completed, since the idea had already been put out and embraced by the Innarlan public, regardless of who Marek was able to control in the city-states government. Marek succeeded in getting Salatis to approve, however, of allowing for the establishment of a Thayan enclave in Innarlith. He then decided to use the canal project to the advantage of the Red Wizards by getting the canal builders to use Thayan magical items or services to help build the canal. \nSalatis got the senate to dismiss Ivar Devorast from his position as chief engineer in constructing the canal and put Willem Korvan, another ally of Marek Rym端t, in his place.\nSenator Pristoleph desired to make himself Ransar of Innarlith and to that effect, he gained control of Firesteap Citadel and built an army there with the intention of taking control of the city. Salatis attempted to assassinate Pristoleph by sending the assassin Tjuyu in the guise of a water naga but was unsuccessful. Eventually, Pristoleph invaded and laid siege to the city. Marek betrayed Salatis and helped Pristoleph gain power. Salatis was murdered during the siege in 1371 DR in the Palace of Many Spires by the same black firedrake bodyguards that had killed Ransar Osorkon during Salatiss coup of 1365 DR."
