        "mainbody": "'''Togrev the Magnificent''' was the so-called lord high commander of the armed forces of the Barony of [[Pundaria]]&mdash;although this fact was disputed.\n{{Quote|I do the talking here. I am Togrev the Magnificent, lord high commander of the armed forces of [[Pundaria]]! We claim these lands by ancient right, as approved and attested by [[Zazesspur]].}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "Togrev was a hairy [[half-ogre]]  His shoulders were massive, his neck thick and muscular, his fingernails black, and his odor&hellip; unappealing&mdash;as expected from his [[ogre]] side. Togrev wore his greasy black hair in a topknot and had an unshaven chin. He spoke with a deep, rumbling voice.\n\nTogrev was fleeter of foot than one might expect for such a large man.\n\nAs revealed by magic, Togrev was an [[evil]] being.",
        "Possessions": "Togrev fought with a [[greataxe]] with a {{SIAdj|6|ft|c}} shaft. The axe head had slits that made it whistle in low moans when the weapon was whirled around.\n\nHis armor was a layer of [[Leather armor|leather]], covered with a [[hauberk]] of tarnished metal [[Scale armor|scales]].\n\nTogrev rode a massive {{SIAdj|18|h|c}} [[horse]] that was as wide as a [[cart]] for carrying [[beer]] kegs.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, Togrev was in service to Baron [[Pundar]], who had been appointed ruler of a barony within [[County Morninggold]] without knowledge of that county's then lord, [[Zaranda Star]]. Zaranda refuted the claim, which was made by Togrev and his men, when she encountered them pillaging a farmhouse and killing its residents under the guise of collecting taxes for the \"baron\". She challenged him to single combat, in exchange for the life of her traveling companion, Father [[Pelletyr]], whom Togrev and his men had captured. Zaranda was victorious, and she slew the ogrish man with her [[saber]] [[Crackletongue]]."
