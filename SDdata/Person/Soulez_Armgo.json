        "mainbody": "oulez Armgo was the matron mother of House Barrison DelArmgo in the 12 century DR.\nSoulez was the mother of MezBarris Armgo.\nSoulez had transformed House Barrison into one of the most promising houses in Menzoberranzan, despite being ranked forty-seventh or forty-third. Her strategy was to keep a low profile while gathering all the resources possible, including the best male warriors and wizards. She sought to only move up to the Ruling Council and not risk open war with a show of power.\nIn 1118 DR, she conspired with Dabnay Trarach of Bregan Daerthe to kill Zaknafein DoUrden, having identified House DoUrden as one of the obstacles to her ascension, especially since she was fearful of Zaknafein killing her weapon master Uthegentel. For this purpose, Soulez manipulated the resentful Arathis Hune. Matron Soulez offered to Dabnay a place in her House in exchange for the death of Zaknafein.\nThe next year, Arathis and Zaknafein were both called to an isolated spot and were attacked by a Barrison DelArmgo war party led by Uthegentel DelArmgo. The pair partnered up in the fight, and managed to kill most of the Armgo warriors, except for Uthegentel. Suddenly Arathis supported Dabnay by attacking Zaknafein. But Zak expected the betrayal and managed to kill the assassin Arathis himself, sparing Dabnay. Despite everything, Mother Soulez was satisfied in the end, and rewarded Dabnay by admitting her into House Armgo."
