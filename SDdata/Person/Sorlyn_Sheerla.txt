'''Sorlyn Sheerla''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Milil]] and a teacher at a [[bardic college]] in [[Amn]], active sometime before [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Sorlyn Sheerla was gifted a powerful magical [[flute]] named ''[[Sorlyn's Ditty]]'' as a [[Midsummer]] gift sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. She fell in love with the instrument and decided to order several dozen copies of the flute created to be given out to the best students as a gift of recognition. She quickly realized that creating an exact copy would be far too expensive, and the resulting copies were of significantly lesser power. Sorlyn did not think that was much of an issue as she believed that any prize student of hers would keep out of trouble anyway.
