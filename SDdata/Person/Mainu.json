        "mainbody": "'''Mainu''' was the most mysterious member of the ''[[bara]]e'', the seven \"super-paladins\" sworn to protect the holy city of [[Mezro]] in [[Chult]].",
        "Description": "Whatever form she used to have, by the late 1300s [[DR]], Mainu had no body but appeared as a flowing dark patch in the waters of the [[River Olung]]. She often changed her aspect, appearing in the form a voluptuous woman or a giant piranha. Whatever shape the flowing darkness took, she always had a pair of golden, glowing eyes.",
        "Personality": "Mainu was very elusive but a stickler for protocol and decorum. She required all visitors to treat her as royalty.",
        "Abilities": "Like all ''barae'', Mainu had been granted special powers from [[Ubtao]], which included the following:\n* She could utter magical [[command]]s that would compel the hearer to obedience.\n* She [[regenerate]]d health rapidly.\n* She could [[detect evil]] at will.\n* She had improved reflexes and physical and mental resistances.\n\nIf within the [[Temple of Ubtao]], she could also cast the following spells:\n* ''[[Cure critical wounds]]''\n* ''[[Forbiddance]]''\n* ''[[Remove blindness or deafness]]''\n* ''[[Remove disease]]''\n* ''[[Restoration]]''\n* ''[[True seeing]]''\n\nIn addition, Mainu possessed the power to control the waters and creatures of the River Olung within ten miles of Mezro."
