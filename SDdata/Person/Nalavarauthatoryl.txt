'''Nalavarauthatoryl''' or '''Nalavara''', formerly the [[elf]] [[wizard]] '''Lorelei Alavara''', was an elf-[[dragon]] who sought vengeance against the kingdom of [[Cormyr]].{{Cite web enhancement/Roll Call of Dragons}}

==History==
Lorelei Alavara was the betrothed of [[Thatoryl Elian]], an elf hunter of the [[Wolf Woods]]. When he was murdered by [[Andar Obarskyr]]—the first elf in the region ever murdered by [[human]] hands—Alavara persuaded [[Iliphar Nelnueve]], [[Lord of Scepters]], to help her take revenge against human settlers. Despite earning Iliphar's respect and alliance when he and Andar's brother [[Ondeth Obarskyr|Ondeth]] first met, around 1000 humans were killed by elven hands before the elves grew tired of Lorelei's warmongering and, over a century since Elian's death, banished her to the [[Stonelands]]. She maintained her quest for vengeance on the [[Obarskyr]] name and all humans in [[Cormyr]].<ref><ref group="note">The adventure ''[[Into the Dragon's Lair]]'' states that Lorelei Alavara's beloved was killed by "[[Faerlthann Obarskyr|the first king of Cormyr]]", whereas the novel ''[[Death of the Dragon]]'' specifies that it was Andar Obarskyr, uncle of Faerlthann, who did it. Asked about this at the REALMS-L Mailing List, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150131025937/http://oracle.wizards.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0010c&L=realms-l&D=1&F=&S=&P=3959 here], [[Sean K. Reynolds]] explained that he had to share a single rough draft of the novel with three other people and that bit of information probably got lost for that reason.

In [[116 DR]], a group of five Cormyrean wizards cast binding spells, specifically keyed to the elf-dragon, and imprisoned her in the [[Grodd]] demiplane. In the casting, two of the wizards gave their lives to empower the final words of the spell. In the process, several of Nalavara's companions were also cast into a [[Hoard (demiplane)|parallel dimension]].

She was later freed by the magic of [[Vangerdahast]], Cormyr's Royal Wizard. She brought with her the [[Grodd goblin]]s, a tribe of [[goblin]]s from the city of [[Grodd (city)|Grodd]]. She was also responsible for the creation of [[ghazneth]]s from the long-dead members of the royal family who had betrayed Cormyr in some way. She was the primary force behind the [[Goblin War]]. In [[1371 DR]], Nalavara and King [[Azoun IV]] fought and finally killed each other.
