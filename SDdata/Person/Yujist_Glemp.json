        "mainbody": "ujist Glemp was the \"almost famous\" sculptor from the hamlet of Gillians Hill, active sometime before 1372 DR.\nYujist Glemp once created and gifted a statue to the good folk of Gillians Hill that later came to be known as Glemp in Granite. The sculpture was proudly displayed on the streets of the town. Many locals felt that the generous gesture rang hollow as the statue bore resemblance to the sculptors own face. Eventually, to no ones surprise, an unknown person \"improved\" the sculpture one night night with a hammer and a chisel. Angered, Glemp stormed around the hamlet, trying to find the \"ungrateful peasant\" who defaced his masterwork. The sculptor decided to re-bestow the sculpture on the poor inhabitants of Gillians Hill. The new version was to be a golden reproduction of the sculptors face, raised on top of a high obelisk, \"out of each of their barbarous chisels.\"\nSoon after the ruination of Yujist Glemps first gift, he mysteriously disappeared before the sculptor had a chance to start working on the new monument to himself. The defaced sculpture was moved away from the decent folks of Gillians Hill eyesight and into the back of Torleths Treasures, the local antiques and \"junk\" shop. Glemp in Granite, as it came to be known, was still in Torleth Mindulspeers store as of 1372 DR.\nThe truth of Glemps disseverance was somewhat mundane. To finance his golden cast statue, he took a load from notorious shark - Vladmyr of Daggerford. Using that coin, the sculptor purchased barrels worth of what he thought was gold. In reality, it was useless pyrite. Glemp wanted to use his sculpture as a collateral, but with only pyrite on hand, he was in danger. Before Vladmyr could send his collectors, Glemp disappeared, leaving behind his \"Barrels of Bamboozle\" for the angry loanshark."
