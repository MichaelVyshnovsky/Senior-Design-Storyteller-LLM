Azetlin was the kobold scribe of a tribe from Undermountain that raided streets of Waterdeep midâ€“14 century DR.
Azetlin was one of the smartest kobolds of his tribe and one of the few who know how to write. His common was extremely broken.
He cared for his mate, Nizella.
Sometime in early 1370 DR, Azetlins tribe was pushed out from their home to the Dungeon Level of Undermountain. On the tribes "king," the kobolds started raiding and thieving in Waterdeep. That year, one of the 5 of Eleint Azetlin the scribe documented one of such thieving expeditions to the surface. The recorded raid was unsuccessful as the kobolds were scared off by a City Watch dwarf with a glowing in the moonlight magical blade. Some minor stolen supplies were traded to a gray orc for food, and the kobolds planned another raid the following night. During the same period of time, the area of the Undermountain they were forced to relocate to was flooded, making some of the tribes kobolds "sneeze-sick," which only added to the kobolds struggles.
