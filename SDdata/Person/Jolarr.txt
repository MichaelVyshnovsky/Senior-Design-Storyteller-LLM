'''Sheik Jolarr''' was the leader of a tribe of [[magic]]-hunting [[Bedine]] warriors that wandered the sands of the [[Anauroch]] desert during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/Portals of Anauroch: The Lost Portal at Hlaungadath}}

==Description==
Despite his destructive goals in life, Jolarr was quite the honorable man. He only considered [[spellcaster]]s among the people with whom he held true enmity.

Jolarr was a skilled outdoorsman, expert rider, and master swordsman when he held blades in each hand. He was particularly adept at hunting down and slaying members of the [[Zhentarim]].

==Activities==
As the leader of 300 Bedine, Jolarr led raids against Zhentarim camps, rogue spellcasters, and magical creatures they encountered in the desert. Ironically, the tribe made use of a handful of [[sorcerer]]s who were adept at ''[[counterspell]]ing'' but never cast offensive magic. There were no [[cleric]]s under Jolarr's leadership, and spiritual worship was fulfilled free of [[divine magic|the Power]].

==Possessions==
Due to his magic-hating nature, Jolarr kept no [[Item enchantment|enchanted items]], but rather kept a pair of masterwork [[blade]]s, a [[saber]], and a [[short sword]].

==History==
When he was was a young boy, Jolarr's tribe launched a raid on a Zhentarim caravan and met stiff resistance. While the rest of the youth of the tribe stayed in the back of the conflict as observers, they were nearly ensnared by the [[wizard]]s of the Black Network, but managed to retreat. Unfortunately, Jolarr's father was not so lucky and died by a dark spell cast by another magic-wielding [[Zhent]].

Jolarr grew to both fear and detest magic, taking up the life of a [[forsaker]], and united his tribe under this hatred. Under his leadership they transformed from a peaceful nomadic tribe into a ferocious army that sought out and destroyed Zhentarim forces, delivering extremely brutal deaths to their [[mage]]s and acolytes. This zealotry extended beyond the dark organization, and they began to hunt down other arcane practitioners, including fellow Bedine spellcasters, and [[magical beast]]s such as [[lamia]]s, and they destroyed any constructs they encountered, such as the numerous ''[[portal]]''s that dotted the sands of the Anauroch desert.

On one occasion, Jolarr and his raiders stalked the [[lamia noble]] sorcerer [[Koreeis]] and their lamia clan into the [[Netheril|Netherese]] ruins of [[Hlaungadath]], but were halted by the presence of dark magic.
