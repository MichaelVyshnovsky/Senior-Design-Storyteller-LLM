        "History": "Rysellan the Dark was an aging wizard from Calimshan when he founded the Twisted Rune in [[864 DR]]. He intended it to be a secret consortium of wizards that would be the true power behind all rulers of the [[Lands of Intrigue]].\n\nIn [[1182 DR]], Rysellan gained the trust of [[Wyvorlaa]], the court wizard of [[Tethyr]], and the Twisted Rune gained influence over Tethyrian politics as a result. However, the work of Rysellan and his closeness with Wyvorlaa caused jealously amongst the Rune's other members, and in [[1188 DR]], three other [[liches]] accused Rysellan of divulging secrets. The ensuing battle destroyed Rysellan and two of his three lich apprentices, their phylacteries destroyed—only [[Kartak Spellseer]] would survive. This was also a major setback for the Twisted Rune's influence in Tethyr, as Wyvorlaa was uncovered and executed.",
        "Equipment": "[[Iryklathagra]], a powerful [[blue dragon]], had a set of nine matched [[king's tears]] crystals in her hoard, each depicting one of the founding liches of the Twisted Rune. These gems were known as [[Rysellan's tears]] collectively and were supposedly worth 75,000 [[gp]] together. It was unknown if these were once owned by Rysellan or simply named after him.",
