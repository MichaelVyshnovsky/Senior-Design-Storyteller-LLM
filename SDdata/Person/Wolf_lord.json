        "mainbody": "The wolf lord was one of the Animal Lords, near-godlike spirits inhabiting the Beastlands that had dominion over all animals of their type. The wolf lord held dominion over all wolves across the Prime Material and Upper Planes.\nLike all Animal Lords, the wolf lord had two forms he could switch between.\nIn his animal form, the wolf lord appeared as a great gray wolf, an ideal specimen of the species, often in the company of a huge pack of other wolves. He would always transform into this form when entering combat.\nLike other Animal Lords, the wolf lord was exceptionally intelligent, but amoral and uncaring when it came to affairs outside of those related to the animal type they had dominion over. Almost never playing favorites. With the driving force of their will being nature itself and the need to protect it from the ravages of civilization.\nThe wolf lord in particular was quite sociable, cunning, and wily. Though he could also come across to others as being strange, brutal, and uncaring. Rather than any evil inclination, this behavior was due to him embodying the characteristics of wolves.\nThe wolf lord possessed all the innate abilities common among the Animal Lords. This included a natural form of telepathy or ESP that was always active, a danger sense that bordered on precognition, an immunity to charm-related spells, a partial magic resistance, and the ability to summon two to twelve of the animal type they had dominion over (wolves). \nHe was capable of casting antimagic shell three times per day, charm person on those affectionate to wolves, as well as plane shift and teleport. The wolf lord uniquely was impervious to harm from nonmagical weapons while in his wolf form.\nThe wolf lord carried around a dagger of venom, that carried an enchantment which made it that the blade never ran dry of poison so long as he was wielding it.\nThe wolf lord was a close ally of Solonor Thelandira, one of the Elven deities that was worshiped on Toril.\nSome believed that the wolf lord knew the disposition of wolves across all the planes and even across all the worlds on the Prime Material plane."
