'''Omm Hlandrar''' was an [[archmage]] of [[Halruaa]] in [[south Faerûn]]. His lifetime spanned at least from the 8{{th}} to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}}

==History==
Omm Hlandrar was known to have fought a [[spell]]-battle with [[Velsharoon|Velsharoon the Vaunted]], then a mortal [[Red Wizard of Thay]], over the skies of the [[Shaar]] in the {{yearlinkName|827}}. It ended in a draw.

Continuing into the mid–14{{th}} century DR, Omm was one of those wizards—listed among [[Halder]] of [[Delzimmer]], [[Szass Tam]] of [[Thay]], [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]], and the [[Simbul]] of [[Aglarond]]—who challenged Velsharoon in his wicked plots. In turn, the arch-necromancer worked to acquire enough power to destroy Omm and all the other mages who'd opposed him. In the late 1350s DR, Velsharoon was working on a means of achieving godhood, and Omm and the others feared for their safety and for the safety and stability of the Realms. Velsharoon ultimately achieving godhood in the {{yearlinkName|1368}}.
