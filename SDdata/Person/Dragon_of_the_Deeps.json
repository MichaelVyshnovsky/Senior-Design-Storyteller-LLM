The tunnels extended underneath the Spines of Surkh mountain range.\nThe Dragon of the Deeps was greatly revered by the residents of the coastal city of Surkh. The Dragon in turn showed no acknowledgement of their existence.\nThey believed that being devoured by the Dragon was among the most honorable ways someone could die. Their beliefs however were not so intense that they actively sought out becoming one of its meals."
