        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, an army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Turnip Bubbs fled to the nearby city of Baldur's Gate with his farm animals. However, all of his and many other farmers' beasts were confiscated by the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries upon entry to fight famine in the city. Despite being robbed of his livelihood, Turnip was granted entrance to the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate, where he was protesting among other farmers near the [[Basilisk Gate]]."
