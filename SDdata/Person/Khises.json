        "mainbody": "'''Khises''' was a legendary [[hippopotamus]] in the fables of [[Cursrah]]. This character was considered a hero in the tales. In particular, Khises battled [[Skahmau the Wolfshead]] at the bottom of the [[Mother of Rivers]].\n\nPrincess [[Amenstar]] of Cursrah had a painting of this battle scene within her private privy. Pressing the eyes of Khises and Skahmau would open a secret door to the cellars below the royal compound, and she used it frequently to sneak away to be with her friends.\n\nCitizens of Cursrah used the phrase \"thank Khises\" as an expression of relief."
