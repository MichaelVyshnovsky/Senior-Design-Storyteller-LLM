        "mainbody": "While the crystal prison that held Pandoryms mind was hidden and difficult to damage, it was possible for a shard of Pandoryms mind to escape if it was damaged. Even such a shard was exceedingly dangerous, although only one could exist at a time and it did not last more than 24 hours.\nSuch a mind shard was possessed of powerful psionic powers. It was immune to divine divination magic and under an effect akin to nondetection, had telepathy out to , and healed any damage taken swiftly, amongst other strange and deadly abilities.\nIt was lured to Faer√ªn and imprisoned by the ancient Imaskari because they wanted it as a deterrent, a doomsday weapon to deter the vengeful deities of the Mulan from destroying Imaskar after their arrival in . Since Pandorym was very dangerous to the Imaskari themselves, they kept its body and mind separated. Both were stored in the Celestial Nadir, a demiplane created by the Imaskari,  with its psyche kept in the Imperial Weapon Cache within the Palace of the Purple Emperor, which was shifted to this plane. In the end, Pandorym was never used, and Re, Enlil, and the other deities destroyed the Imaskari Empire in .\nAfter millennia of imprisonment, Pandoryms psyche partly freed itself in 1370, and began using the people of Vaelan to free itself. When Datharathi miners from Vaelen discovered a gate to the Celestial Nadir and mined the local crystal directly from there, the patriarch of the Datharathi, Shaddon Datharathi, used the pure Celestial Nadir crystal to build superior prosthetics. Those not only improved the abilities of those who had them, but allowed him to possess and control those who took the crystal. He soon found out that Pandorym could control him too.\nPandorym also shifted the Palace of the Purple Emperor back into the world, onto its original foundation in the Raurin Desert. It also sent monsters after Ususi Manaallin, a Deep Imaskari wizard. It sought to acquire her keystone in order to fully free itself.\nDuring its imprisonment, Pandorym had foreseen the moment of its release, but also the possibility that Ususi Manaallin would prevent that. To impede this possibility, Pandorym reached forward through time and accidentally forged two competing timelines one in which Ususi would be born and dread Pandoryms darkness, and another in which Qari Manaallin, an alternate Ususi, would be born with the ability to pierce any darkness. Both timelines existed together, and in the end, the blind Qari gave her darkvision to Ususi so that she could defeat Pandorym.\nIn 1374, Pandorym attacked Deep Imaskar to take vengeance on the last descendants of ancient Imaskar, but, on Tarsakh 19, Ususi Manaallin, Iahn Qoyllor, Warian Datharathi, Kiril Duskmourn, and Prince Monolith succeeded in keeping Pandoryms body and mind imprisoned in the Celestial Nadir and the Palace of the Purple Emperor. Unfortunately, the sealing of Pandorym caused the death of most of the Datharathi senior members.\nBy the  there was a rumor that an evil of elder days haunted the corridors beneath Adamas Tooth, and that a cloud of darkness hung over the monolith forevermore since the curse that slew all but a few of the Datharathi scions."
