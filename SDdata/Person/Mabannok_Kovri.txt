'''Mabannok Kovri''', also known as '''Mab''', was a [[gnome]] [[druid]] who was interested in [[poetry]] and recipes.

==Description==
Kovri was a gnome [[loremonger]], and as such, was a studious keeper of information. They were said to be an "incomparable trove of lore". Though the gnome was skilled without their ''[[whisper jar]]'', Mab used it often, especially to aid their franchise.

==Activities==
Mab's hobbies consisted of collecting recipes that honored the "noble [[turnip]]", and examining [[dwarf|dwarven]] poetry.
