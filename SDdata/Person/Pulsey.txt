'''Pulsey''' was a girl that lived in the town of [[Llorkh]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Some time around the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Pulsey shared a brief romance with the charismatic young rogue named [[Tiep]]. Unbeknownst to poor Pulsey, Tiep had other young women waiting for him in settlements across the west from [[Scornubel]] to [[Parnast]] and beyond.
