Hruk was a hill giant sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Chief Guh took Hruk from his wife Moog as her own husband, like many others.
In Grudd Haug, Hruk was at the main entrance watching the door. Secretly he wanted to go back to Moog but did not dare defy Guh.
