They wielded [[longsword]]s, [[dagger]]s, and [[dart]]s coated with a paralytic [[poison]]. On missions outside, they were also armed with [[bow]]s.\n\n''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], sergeants wore a uniform of polished [[chainmail]] covered with a tabard in black cloth with gold trim. They carried a steel [[heavy shield]], and carried a masterwork [[longsword]] and [[club]], together with a composite [[shortbow]] and 20 arrows. However, depending on their posting, they could also have [[shortspear]]s, [[short sword]]s, and [[dagger]]s.
