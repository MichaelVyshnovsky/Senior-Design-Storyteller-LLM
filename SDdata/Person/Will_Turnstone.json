        "mainbody": "'''Will Turnstone''' was a [[halfling]] scout and a companion of [[Dorn Graybrook]] during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]].",
        "Description": "He was handsome, with black lovelocks and a heart-shaped face. He often wore leather armor.{{cite book/The Rage|7|1}}",
        "Personality": "Though he took pride in his wits, Will had a streak of decency that ultimately made him ill-suited to the life of a thief. He didn't care for manual labor, and rather favored stealth and cunning, not being all that averse to violence.\n\nHe was able to appreciate comforts, and not as keen on dragon hunting as his partners.{{cite book/The Rage|36|3}}\n\nHe did not speak [[Draconic]].{{cite book/The Rage|38|3}}",
        "Equipment": "Will Turnstone employed a ''[[hornblade]]'' weapon in battle.{{cite book/The Rage|12|1}} He wore [[calfskin]] gloves.",
        "History": "Originally from [[Saerloon]] in [[Sembia]], Will was raised by his aunt after his parents died from a fever. In spite of her best efforts, he slowly joined the local underworld, though he did not become a full-fledged thug until she died, joining the [[Night Knives]]. After joining, he became dissatisfied because of their ruthlessness, viciousness, and violence; he ultimately broke with the Night Knives after they kidnapped a human baby, threatening to hack the child to pieces if the ransom was not paid; when his parents explained they were not that rich, the ransom was doubled. Though Will returned the baby, he was forced to kill fellow guild members in the process, and fled Saerloon shortly after for the city-states of the north, around the Moonsea. He joined with a band of dragonslayers at some point afterwards.\n\nOn [[Hammer 23]], after hunting an [[ooze drake]]{{cite book/The Rage|40|3}} that broke his sword,{{cite book/The Rage|43|3}} Dorn Graybrook and his party learned of a flight of dragons rising to attack Ylraphon.{{cite book/The Rage|45|3}}. By early [[Hammer 24]], the town had been razed, and his band agreed to accompany Kara to Lyrabar in a ship.{{cite book/The Rage|60|3}} Along the way, they spotted signs of another flight of dragons, and began suspecting a full-blown Rage of dragons.{{cite book/The Rage|67|4}} Further evidence mounted as they spotted more destroyed coastal settlements;{{cite book/The Rage|89|6}} during the trip, they were approached by a flight of silver dragons, the first ones Dorn's band had ever seen.{{cite book/The Rage|100|6}} The two dragons, [[Moonwing]] and [[Azhaq]], were looking for Kara, who they explained, was actually a [[song dragon]] named Karasendrieth, whom they intended to take back with them.{{cite book/The Rage|103|6}} Dorn struck at the dragons rather than yield Karasendrieth;{{cite book/The Rage|104|6}} though the ensuing fight led to two casualties amongst the crew, Dorn's team ultimately prevailed.{{cite book/The Rage|110|6}} Kara afterwards explained that a Rage was underway, and the [[gold dragon]] king [[Lareth]] expected it to be one of the worst;{{cite book/The Rage|138|10}} the party, against Graybrook's instincts, chose to aid Kara in finding [[Helder Gorstag]] in [[Lyrabar]].{{cite book/The Rage|140|10}}\n\nIn Lyrabar, Will and Pavel consulted Gorstag Helder's landlady, [[Mureene]], about him. After bribing and threatening her, they learned that his room was ransacked by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and then by Mureene herself; Pavel determined, and Mureene confirmed, that Gorstag was taking instruction as a swordsman.{{cite book/The Rage|156-159|12}} \n\nThe whole party met with Brimstone at his lair, learning he was a [[smoke drake]].{{cite book/The Rage|177|12}} After a brief battle with Brimstone, who was possessed by Sammaster's notes while trying to read them, the vampiric wyrm bade them to attack the Cult of the Dragon and find clues; over Dorn's opposition, the party agreed.{{cite book/The Rage|188-189|12}}. On the evening of [[Ches 14]], the party protected Taegan Nightwind, who set himself out as bait for the Cult by pretending to be drowning his sorrows in too much alcohol.{{cite book/The Rage|193-196|13}} They afterwards interrogated one of the cultists that they captured, learning that the cult hid in a dungeon beneath a tannery.{{cite book/The Rage|198|13}} After a fight, they captured the [[Wearer of Purple]] [[Cylla Morieth]] and managed to learn of Sammaster's plans for the Rage.{{cite book/The Rage|206|13}}\n\nTaegan Nightwind agreed to petition Queen Sambryl to send warriors to fight the Cult of the Dragon close to Lyrabar, to which she ultimately agreed.{{cite book/The Rage|236-237|16}} Dorn, Kara, and the others instead left for [[Elmwood]], which they found to be under [[Zhentarim]] occupation.{{cite book/The Rage|240|17}} After the fight, they joined [[Thoyanna Jorgadaul]] and other authorities from town in a small grove to which a small bird led them.{{cite book/The Rage|249|17}} There, after learning of the Zhentarim activities through the area, they decided to break their control over the town, blaming dragons for any damage.{{cite book/The Rage|254|17}} During their following raid, Dorn managed to secure a craft.{{cite book/The Rage|278|18}} They took the craft to Thentia, and then to Northkeep, where they were joined by [[Chatulio]].{{cite book/The Rage|307|20}} After a battle against Sammaster's guardians, Dorn pleaded with the ghosts to allow his company to search the ruins. Surprisingly, he was heard out.{{cite book/The Rage|330|22}} After days of searching, they finally located a number of reliefs that showed the origins of the Rage.{{cite book/The Rage|339|22}}\n\nPavel and Will traveled to Hulburg on their own, arriving on [[Mirtul 1]].{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons/The Prisoner of Hulburg|345}} There, they were attacked while at sea, and later learned that the Zhentarim were using a trapped [[emerald dragon]], [[Vercevoran]], as part of a network to monitor the Moonsea.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons/The Prisoner of Hulburg|354}} Later they released Vercevoran, who rewarded them the next day by telling them about the [[King-Killer Star]].{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons/The Prisoner of Hulburg|371}}\n\nOn Mirtul 19, Pavel Shemov and Will Turnstone came across the war party of Yagoth One-Eye, who were still injured from fighting a wyrm.{{cite book/The Rite|49|1}}. They made contact a week later, in Mirtul 25, after helping them fight off a dragon.{{cite book/The Rite|64|3}}. Yagoth ultimately agreed to guide Will and Pavel to a ruin he knew of.{{cite book/The Rite|74|3}} On Kythorn 2, Pavel, Will, Yagoth, and the latter's forces arrived at the ruined temple to Vaprak of the Claws; they sought to search through the ruin.{{cite book/The Rite|122|6}} After a fight against some [[squamous spewer]]s, Yagoth double-crossed his guests and captured Pavel; Will managed to escape.{{cite book/The Rite|139|6}}\n\nPavel was kept captive by Yagoth, who tried to get him to find something he could personally use in the tablets kept within the ruined temple; though he ran out of tablets by Kythorn 6, the ogre kept him alive and bade him continue for good measure. He also broke Pavel's leg and splinted it wrong, using magic to keep him hobbled, as well as prevented him from regaining spells every dawn since his capture.{{cite book/The Rite|165|8}} Meanwhile, Will, who was in no condition to fight, lured a flight of green dragons to the temple in order to create a distraction.{{cite book/The Rite|173|8}} He was able to slay Yagoth and free Pavel shortly afterwards.{{cite book/The Rite|184|8}} On Kythorn 15, Pavel and Will were retrieved from Thar by [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]], who bore them to Damara; the drake had learned of King Dragonsbane's state, and meant to counter it so that Kara and Dorn were able to retrieve lore from the country unimpeded.{{cite book/The Rite|217-128|9}}\n\nOn Kythorn 25, Pavel and Will, together with Pavel's old master, Patriarch Kovor Gemetsk, met with queen Christine Dragonsbane to propose them Brimstone's plan.{{cite book/The Rite|225-228|11}} The next evening, Brimstone brought them, alongside a number of Dragonsbane's men, to the Plane of Shadow, to break the curse on Dragonsbane.{{cite book/The Rite|236|11}} Though Brimstone knew the curse, he needed Pavel's aid to break it in the end.{{cite book/The Rite|245-246|11}}\n\nBy Midsummer, Dorn's party had reformed in Thentia, where considerable progress had been made in decoding Sammaster's notes.{{cite book/The Rite|329-333|E}}\n\nOn Eleint 12, Taegan and Jivex had rejoined Dorn's party, and taken to exploring the steppes of ancient [[Narfell]], following Sammaster's explorations. Despite carrying a token of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s favor, they were attacked by a Far Quey raiding party.{{cite book/The Ruin|14|1}} Kara attempted to lure in the Nars for a friendly talk, but they attacked when [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]] attacked them, unbeknownst to her; they broke off after Pavel rescued their captain.{{cite book/The Ruin|32-34|1}} Afrer the conversation with the Nars, they learned of the [[Hermit]].{{cite book/The Ruin|35|1}} After they reached the Hermit and fought him, he related upon Dorn's party that it had realized, during the first Rage, that the elves had built a citadel in Novularond, but knew little beyond that.{{cite book/The Ruin|57|2}}\n\nOn 27 Marpenoth, after being captured by Raryn's family, who had poisoned the party for Iyraclea, Will's party arrived at a citadel in Novularond.{{cite book/The Ruin|116-117|6}} Later that night, Zethrindor arrived with Brimstone, and attacked Iyraclea, considering she had broken faith with Sammaster.{{cite book/The Ruin|122-123|6}} The fight ended after Zethrindor's spell appeared to annihilate Karasendrieth; Dorn had to be talked out of a suicide attack against the dragon, instead, escaping in the commotion.{{cite book/The Ruin|135|6}} Some time after the victory, Zethrindor ordered his forces to find and retrieve Dorn's party.{{cite book/The Ruin|137|6}} Though an ice wyrm came after them, they managed to narrowly defeat it.{{cite book/The Ruin|148|6}}\n\nIn 8 Uktar, after nearly sneaking out in the morning, dorn noticed several people in white clothes attempt to ambush his comrades in their sleep. Those were warriors of Sossal; dornº stopped them long enough for Pavel to defuse the situation.{{cite book/The Ruin|161|7}} On Uktar 16, Zethrindor maneuvered his dragons to block Stival Chergoba's forces from joining Madislak Pemsk's, and pincer the latter's,{{cite book/The Ruin|196-198|8}} after Stival Chergoba's group ran into his main force.{{cite book/The Ruin|191-193|8}} On Uktar 17, after a long forced march, by which they managed to successfully reach Madislak Pemsk's group ahead of Zethrindor's army, Will fought alongside Stival Chergoba's forces.{{cite book/The Ruin|203-205|9}} After the battle began, Will and dorn fought a tundra landwyrm, which had been augmented with ''[[accellerated burrowing]]''.{{cite book/The Ruin|208-210|9}}\n\nduring the fighting, Will Turnstone had an idea, and with Jivex's help, he reached the enemy commanders under Zethrindor and informed them that Iyraclea had been killed by Zethrindor.{{cite book/The Ruin|223-226|9}} Zethrindor, upon noticing, decided to confirm it.{{cite book/The Ruin|228-229|9}} Zethrindor accepted a challenge from Will Turnstone to fight dorn's party and Madislak Pemsk, wagering that the losing party's army would surrender, advised that if he chose to forfeit the challenge, he would look weak.{{cite book/The Ruin|238-239|10}} Ultimately, albeit Zethrindor slew Madislak Pemsk,{{cite book/The Ruin|244|10}} and may have slain dorn's group, the ice giants in his army struck at him, sensing weakness, and destroyed him;{{cite book/The Ruin|247|10}} even the dragons in his army chose to flee after his death.{{cite book/The Ruin|248|10}}\n\ndorn and his party returned just in time for their meeting on the Feast of the Moon. The meeting was attended by a number of dragons, including Nexus, Tamarand, Azhaq, Moonwing, LLimark, Wardancer, Vingdavalac, and the Talons of Justice, amongst other dragons, and the wizards of Thentia, amongst them Firefingers, Scattercloak, darvin Kordeion, Sureene Aumratha, Baerimel, and Jannatha Goldenshield. With no other ideas, the metallic dragons and the wizards of Thentia attempted a Grand divination; the ritual failed, instead leading to the death of [[Moonwing]].{{cite book/The Ruin|257-261|11}} Pavel Shemov finally proposed attempting to use Brimstone's hoard near Lyrabar as a focus for contacting Brimstone's necklace and Brimstone himself, under the assumption the drake had made it through the gate.{{cite book/The Ruin|264-265|11}} By Nightal 5, they managed to cross over to the ''dracorage mythal'', fighting the tarterian guardians.{{cite book/The Ruin|277-278|12}} After defeating the tarterians, the dragons and mages there managed to break through Sammaster's ward.{{cite book/The Ruin|283|12}}\n\nOn 6 Uktar, Sammaster teleported to the mythal and called upon pacts with a number of wyrms from other planes to defend the ''dracorage mythal''.{{cite book/The Ruin|289|12}} In the middle of the battle, Pavel led the majority of the non-dragons, including Will, into the fortress, to try and break the Rage while Sammaster was still occupied.{{cite book/The Ruin|297|13}} They fought the guardians to buy time for Pavel to break the wards; Pavel managed to break the mythal after five tries. Though he managed to destroy the phylactery, he sustained fatal wounds in the process.{{cite book/The Ruin|330|13}}\n\nAfter the fight, when Kara finally paid them, Will Turnstone decided to donate his share to a temple of Lathander.{{cite book/The Ruin|337|E}}"
