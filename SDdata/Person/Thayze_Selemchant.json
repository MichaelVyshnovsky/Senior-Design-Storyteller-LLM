He was also secretly a high-ranked member of the [[Cowled Wizards]]. He was blackmailing two other council members but his membership of the Cowled Wizards was revealed and he died. There was a rumor that he survived as a [[ghost]].\n\nIn [[1345 DR]], [[Tessarch]] [[Quorl Vemmil]] attempted to frame Thayze for a plague in [[Keczulla]] but Thayze's intelligence agents revealed the plot, and Quorl and his priests were forced to Keczulla where they perished. Thayze survived this attempt against him."
