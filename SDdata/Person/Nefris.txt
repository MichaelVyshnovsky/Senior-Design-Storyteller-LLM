Nefris was a female Red Wizard of Thay and the headmistress of the Academy of Shapers and Binders.
She was the one who first drew the Kalach-Cha to Rashemen by manipulating her daughters Lienna and Safiya. However, it was discovered that she was acting under the hidden orders of the Founder and she was a partial reincarnation of her. For this, Akachis brother Araman, under Myrkuls geas, led a coup in the academy and captured the Founder and killed Nefris.
