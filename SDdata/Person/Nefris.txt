'''Nefris''' was a female [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] and the headmistress of the [[Academy of Shapers and Binders]].

She was the one who first drew the [[Kalach-Cha]] to [[Rashemen]] by manipulating her daughters [[Lienna]] and [[Safiya]]. However, it was discovered that she was acting under the hidden orders of the [[Founder]] and she was a partial reincarnation of her. For this, [[Akachi]]'s brother [[Araman]], under [[Myrkul]]'s ''[[geas]]'', led a coup in the academy and captured the Founder and killed Nefris.<ref>
