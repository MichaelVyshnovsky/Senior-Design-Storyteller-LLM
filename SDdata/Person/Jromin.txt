Jromin was an elf and priest of Curna who inhabited the Shining South during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Jromin lived within the Ajmer Forest in Durpar where he served as a spiritual leader for his people. His fellows credited him for the fact that there were no druids to be found within the forest, believing Jromin would not allow anyone that sloppy within the wooded region. Regardless of if that was true or not, Jromin was highly protective of the forest and secretly monitored anyone who entered.
He carried a quarterstaff.
Jromin despised the wizard Crimonil.
