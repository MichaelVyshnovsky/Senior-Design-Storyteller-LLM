Tearn, formerly a member of Clan Tlassian, was a dragonborn warlock who lived in Djerad Thymar in 1479 DR. Tearn was a thrikominaki (clanless dragonborn).
Tearn had a gruesome scar on his left check, where once he had his clan piercings.
Tearn was interested in Untheric ruins and history. While not an expert, he investigated such matters with the help of an eladrin scholar named Eliko, and by 1479 DR was an expert in old Untheran history.
A few years before 1479 DR, Tearn was exiled from his clan for his research into Untheran relics, as members of Clan Tlassian believed he was conspiring with a rival clan, Clan Vkriss.
In 1479 DR, Tearn helped a band of adventurers to explore the Tomb of Ur-Hammabi, in order to find a powerful artifact known as the Sphere of Laskanova.
Later the same year, Tearn may have helped the adventurers to thwart a plot of the Cult of the Dragon in Tymanther, destroying that cell of the Cult.
