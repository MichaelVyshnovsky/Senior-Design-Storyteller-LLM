'''Sirac of Suzail''' was an acolyte of [[Torm]] in [[Bryn Shander]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
Sirac was the son of the famous adventurer [[Artus Cimber]], but was given up as a baby. He grew up in an orphanage in [[Suzail]], and learned to fend for himself living on the city's streets as a teenager. Although orphaned, Sirac was always aware of his lineage.

In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], he joined a caravan to [[Baldur's Gate]]. He then traveled to [[Neverwinter]] before finally arriving in [[Bryn Shander]], where he intended to work as a [[trout|knucklehead trout]] fisherman. He befriended [[Dellvon Ludwig]], who converted him to the worship of the god [[Torm]].

Sirac was present at the local [[House of the Triad]] when [[giant]]s attacked Bryn Shander.

==Personality==
Sirac belived firmly in duty and honor. He was honest at heart and felt he had found a true home in [[Icewind Dale]].
