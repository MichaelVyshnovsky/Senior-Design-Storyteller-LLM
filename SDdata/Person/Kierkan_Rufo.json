        "mainbody": "'''Kierkan Rufo''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Deneir]] at the [[Edificant Library]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]] and a colleague and rival of [[Cadderly Bonaduce]].",
        "Description": "[[File:Kierkan Rufo.jpg|left|thumb|''Kierkan menaces Cadderley.'']]\nRufo was {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall, bone-skinny, and always standing at an angle tilting to the side. He had stringy black hair and penetrating black eyes in a pale face,<ref>",
        "History": "Jealous of the attention Cadderly, a fellow devotee of [[Deneir]], received, Rufo was easily manipulated by a priest of [[Talona]], [[Barjin]], who hypnotized him in an effort to unleash the [[Chaos Curse]] in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}. Affected by the curse, he was overtaken by his hatred for Cadderly and his lust for [[Danica Maupoissant]] and became quite violent. Eventually he was subdued and freed from the effects of the curse.<ref>\n\nLater on, Rufo became repentant, seeking to redeem himself for his actions. He accompanied Cadderly, Danica and the [[elf]] prince [[Elbereth]] to [[Shilmista]], which had come under assault from the [[ogrillon]] [[Ragnor]], a mighty [[ogre]]-[[orc]] half-breed and a member of [[Castle Trinity]].<ref> Once again, Rufo found himself manipulated, forced to obey the [[wizard]] [[Dorigen]] from Castle Trinity and her [[imp]] ally [[Druzil]]. \n\nA coward to the end, Rufo returned home before the conflict in Shilmista ended. After accompanying [[Avery Schell|Headmaster Avery]] to [[Carradoon]], he was once again used as a pawn by one of Castle Trinity's wizards, [[Bogo Rath]], and inadvertently caused the headmaster's death—Rufo's final step towards the dark side of his nature.<ref> As a consequence, Rufo received a holy brand (a blown-out candle above a closed eye) from Cadderly on the forehead, banning Rufo forever from his order.<ref>\n\nExiled and alone, Kierkan Rufo met up with Druzil once again. The imp, freed from servitude to [[Aballister Bonaduce]] through the mage's death,<ref> persuaded Rufo to return to the library and retrieve the Chaos Curse. In false hopes of getting rid of the brand on his forehead, Rufo instead drank from the bottle containing the Chaos Curse<ref> and the elixir caused his death at the very steps of the Edificant Library.\n\nThree days after his death, Rufo rose from the dead at the mausoleum of the Edificant Library, having been turned into a [[vampire]]—the embodiment of the Chaos Curse. He proceeded to seize control of the library, turning many of the other priests into lesser vampires or [[zombie]]s, with the exception of Brother [[Chaunticleer]], who managed to keep himself safe.<ref>\n\nCadderly's return led to a confrontation between the old rivals, with a battle of Rufo's evil magic against the clerical powers of his rival. Eventually, as he tried to escape in mist form, Kierkan was caught in a [[bellows]] by the dwarf [[Ivan Bouldershoulder]] and exposed to the sun outside the Edificant Library. So great was Rufo's power, he denied Deneir in Cadderly's face while bathed in sunlight. Cadderly's power, however, combined with the light of the sun, eventually destroyed Rufo as he himself destroyed the desecrated library.",
        "Abilities": "As a priest of Deneir, Rufo did not possess powers worth mentioning. As a vampire though, his physical and magical powers grew beyond imagination. Rufo gained inhuman strength<ref> and could change into greenish vapor in order to pass through tiny cracks in stone.<ref> A person would heed his command to come close against his or her will.<ref> Rufo could even assume the form of a [[bat]]. Even in his human form he could climb walls upside down, using the tiniest cracks for a handhold.<ref> He could summon a sphere of darkness to shield himself from light or to hide even better in shadows.<ref>"
