        "mainbody": "'''Brant Hallower''' was a [[werewolf]] servant of [[Selûne]] and member of the [[New Moon Pact]] in the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "As a werewolf, Brant appeared as a heavily-built white [[wolf]] with bright eyes.",
        "History": "Brant served Selûne as a werewolf of the New Moon Pact, fighting against the faith's enemies in the darkness. In [[757 DR]], the High Moonmistress [[Brima Chintamn]] of [[Bright Lady's Tower]] in [[Chancelgaunt]] declared the New Moon Pact a heresy, and Brant and many other members were hunted down and executed.\n\nWhen [[Feena Archwood]] investigated the mystery of the New Moon Pact in [[1373 DR]], Brant's spirit appeared in her dreams alongside the other members of the Pact to defend and guide her. After she uncovered [[Velsinore]]'s heresy and they mutually slew each other, Feena's spirit was met by a [[Shards|Shard]] escort to the afterlife, but the spirits of the Pact members encouraged her to return to life and join the New Moon Pact herself. With the aid of [[Julith Harkspur]]'s healing, Feena was revived and ultimately continued the legacy of the Pact."
