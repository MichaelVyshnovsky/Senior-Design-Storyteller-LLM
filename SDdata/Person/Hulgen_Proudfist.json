However, Neverwintan [[mage]] [[Riftel Farsight]] felt they could be persuaded to change sides, but the Proudfists did not trust her. She sent a [[half-elf]] [[adventurer]] to speak with Hulgen. Hulgen required this diplomat to prove their worth to himself, [[Dulgan Proudfist|Dulgan]], and [[Chalik Proudfist|Chalik]]. Hulgen tested their strength by asking them to slay the mighty [[ogre]] [[Thag Slabhead]].\n\nSatisfied, Hulgen asked the adventurer to join them in battle as they rose up against their Many-Arrows overseer. After that, Hulgen would bring his tribe to Neverwinter's aid."
