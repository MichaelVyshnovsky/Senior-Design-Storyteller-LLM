        "History": "Daji was the youngest son of honorable [[Sunsho Anteki]]. Born through divine intervention, he stood only 2 inches (5 cm) tall. In 1360, Daji and his older brother [[Shunso Miharu]] went to [[Ito-jo]]. Miharu entered the caves deep the castle, and Daji remained to wait outside, but the brother never come back. After passing some time fishing, he met an adventuring party hired by [[Michimori Uemon]] to recover the [[Seven Swords]] and decided to join them in order to find his brother. At last, Daji discovered that Miharu had been killed and eaten by a wandering [[oni]]."
