Melkerech was a malevolent lich that was an old rival of Adzerak. He regularly spied upon Barrenstone with divination spells, waiting for an opportunity to seize its treasures, particularly the books. When Adzerak was destroyed and Barrenstone was looted in 1369 DR, he began devoting his efforts to tracking down the adventurers and recovering "his" books.
