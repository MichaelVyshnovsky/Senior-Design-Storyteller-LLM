'''Azoun I''' (full name '''Azoun Obarskyr''') was the 51st king of [[Cormyr]], reigning from [[391 DR|391]]–[[425 DR]]. He was the son of King [[Anglond]] of the [[Obarskyr]] dynasty, and was titled '''"the Crown Prince of Battles"''' for his campaigns as a prince.

==Description==
As a young prince, Azoun was tall and broad-shouldered but had a soft, cultured voice. He had a soft beard. His prince's crown was an unadorned [[gold]] circlet.

==Personality==
Azoun was charming and amiable.

==History==
Azoun Obarskyr was born in the [[358 DR|Year of the Battle Talons, 358 DR]]. He was the son and sole heir of his father, King Anglond, and of Queen [[Eleriel Obarskyr]].

As a boy, he was taught to read and write by the Royal Wizard, [[Baerauble Etharr]].

There was a tale he'd once been caught stealing apples by Lady [[Ryndala Merendil]]; it was equally possible he'd been caught with one of her three daughters.

Through the mid–4th century [[DR]], the small realm of [[Valashar (kingdom)|Valashar]]—a client-state of [[Tethyr]] and a subject of the [[Shoon Imperium]], under King [[Ashar Tornamn]]—had steadily extended its borders north to the [[Troll Mountains]] and beyond. Finally, in the [[375 DR|Year of the Woeful Resurrection, 375 DR]], the ambitious Ashar marched his forces north along the [[Sword Coast]] and into the [[Western Heartlands]], reaching the [[High Moor]] by late summer of the following year. He claimed all these lands for the Imperium, and began to tax caravans for "passing through the empire's lands". The people of [[Cormyr]] soon found their trade routes to the west blocked by Shoonite forces demanding tariffs.{{Valashar dates}} Responding to these claims on the northern lands, the interruption of trade, and the continued expansion toward Cormyr's border, Prince Azoun{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|22}}{{Cite dragon/407/Blades of Kings|31}} 

In early spring of the [[376 DR|Year of the Leaping Hare, 376 DR]], Azoun met the apprentice High Wizard [[Amedahast]] and offered to tutor her in her studies of Cormyrean geography, history, current affairs, and customs. The pair met in the [[Royal Gardens]] each day for a month, in which she taught him elven poetry from [[Myth Drannor]] and told him of other lands and ancient legends. However, after a noble feast, Amedahast was left devastated when she saw Azoun with another woman, seducing her with the elven poetry. The next morning in the garden, there was an assassination attempt by Lady Merendil against Azoun, in which the assailants wore elven cloaks of [[invisibility]]. It was foiled when Amedahast used her magic and Azoun his sword to defeat them.

===Campaign against Valashar===
Later in 376 DR, Prince Azoun I embarked on a bold campaign against King Ashar, with ''Ilbratha'' in hand.

Over the year, Azoun drove Ashar's forces back south, through the [[Greenfields (Western Heartlands)|Green Fields]], and quickly crushed them on the [[Giant's Plain]].

Azoun pursued Ashar all the way to the city of [[Ithmong]], capital of Tethyr. The prince himself led his forces in sacking the city, in a show of strength and a warning to both King [[Kallos Tornamn]] of Tethyr and Emperor [[Shoon VII]] of the Imperium. He might have gone on to [[Shoonach]] and attempted to bring down the Imperium, if it were not for [[orc]] hordes troubling Cormyr. As Ashar Tornamn was executed for agitating Cormyr and the Sword Coast rulers, and the Shoon Empire withdrew its borders to the north of Valashar, Azoun I led his triumphant army back to Cormyr.

===Later adventures===
Azoun later received command of a fast cog, ''[[Valashar's Bane]]'', named in honor of his victories against Valashar. He took great delight in this vessel.

In the [[389 DR|Year of the Wooded Altar, 389 DR]], Azoun sailed ''Valashar's Bane'' to the [[Vilhon Reach]], on a trade mission to [[Arrabar]]. Prince Azoun and Amedahast slipped away to explore [[elf|elven]] ruins in the [[Chondalwood]], where they ran into [[Dima el Qufis|Dima]], the self-proclaimed [[Djinni]]-Lord, a marauding mage. They killed Dima and took away his treasure and magical relics, electing to keep secret their discovery of the ''[[Silver Scimitar of Amahl the Mad]]'' and the magic ring ''[[Amahl's Mastering]]'', both powerful magical items of Shoon.

However, on the return voyage later that year, ''Valashar's Bane'' was hit by a bad storm on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], which caught Azoun and the crew by surprise. The ship was holed on the [[Neck]], east of the [[Darkflow River]]. Taking on water, the prince and his crew limped back as close to Cormyr as they could, before the ship finally sank 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from the shore. Fortunately, no lives were lost in the sinking, much to Azoun's relief. He and all the crew escaped in smaller boats and landed on shore west of the Darkflow, a day later at dawn. Azoun described the moment as "the best gleaming dawn seen in Cormyr yet". However, he regretted the loss of ''Valashar's Bane'', which had taken the royal sword ''Ilbratha'' with it, along with lesser regalia and the treasures won by Azoun on the expedition.

===Kingship===
Azoun was crowned king in the [[391 DR|Year of the Azure Cockatrice, 391 DR]], on the death of his father.

The lost sword ''Ilbratha'' had since been recovered and came into the possession of the merchant [[Phelas]]. He took the sword with him as he traveled overland, passing through Cormyr, and the sword was recognized in [[Arabel]]. When Cormyrean agents of King Azoun I attempted to retrieve it in the [[392 DR|Year of the Firstborn, 392 DR]], Phelas panicked at being so hunted. The agents killed the unlucky Phelas Urm, but the sword went missing again, either due to the confusion of the situation, or due to a corrupt agent stealing the blade.

Azoun I died in the [[425 DR|Year of the Argent Shafts, 425 DR]]. He was succeeded by his son and sole heir, [[Duar Obarskyr]].

==Activities==
As a prince, Azoun rode every morning.
