Taluth was a younger malaugrym, (a.k.a. shadowmaster) living in Westgate as of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR.
As a shapeshifter, Taluth could appear as any living thing, but usually appeared as a plain, ordinary, human female. Taluth was known to take more attractive male or female forms when it suited her needs.
Taluth was a bold operator in Westgate, but cautious enough to redirect suspicion of her activities to the merchant-lords, making it look like her accomplishments were caused by their machinations. She was unpredictable, capricious, and merciless when it pleased her, toying with others for her own entertainment.
She was particularly adept at learning new magic spells.
Taluth was constantly looking for ways to increase her pleasure, fill her coffers, or acquire new magic items and spells. She was a powerful player in Westgate, but chose to remain hidden and unsuspected.
She was particularly fond of humans and hired them as agents, dallied with them for pleasure, and used them as patsies and scapegoats. Adventuresome humans were her favorite playthings.
