'''Taluth''' was a younger [[malaugrym]], (a.k.a. shadowmaster) living in [[Westgate]] as of the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]].

==Description==
As a shapeshifter, Taluth could appear as any living thing, but usually appeared as a plain, ordinary, [[human]] female. Taluth was known to take more attractive male or female forms when it suited her needs.

==Personality==
Taluth was a bold operator in Westgate, but cautious enough to redirect suspicion of her activities to the merchant-lords, making it look like her accomplishments were caused by their machinations. She was unpredictable, capricious, and merciless when it pleased her, toying with others for her own entertainment.

==Abilities==
She was particularly adept at learning new magic spells.

==Activities==
Taluth was constantly looking for ways to increase her pleasure, fill her coffers, or acquire new magic items and spells. She was a powerful player in Westgate, but chose to remain hidden and unsuspected.

==Relationships==
She was particularly fond of humans and hired them as agents, dallied with them for pleasure, and used them as patsies and scapegoats. Adventuresome humans were her favorite playthings.
