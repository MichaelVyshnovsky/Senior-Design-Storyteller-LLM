        "mainbody": "Aklar Delkash was a human man and merchant operating in the Vast in the late 1360s DR.\nAklar was a trader in quality furs and woven rugs. He planned to sell these in the city of Procampur, and stopped at the hamlet of Sevenecho on the way. There he stayed at the The Worried Wyvern inn.\nOn the 2nd Eleint in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, Aklar learned that a local well had been contaminated with a magic-resistant poison. Frightened, he made a quick departure.\nAklar Delkash was a dark-skinned man with black hair and bushy eyebrows. He had beady, somewhat shifty-looking dark brown eyes. He was 5 feet and 4 inches (1.6 meters) tall and weighed 180 pounds (82 kilograms). \nHe dressed flamboyantly, in brightly colored fine silks. This was at odds with his generally dour attitude.\nHe had hired four mercenaries to protect and assist him on his journey.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryMerchants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vast\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryFighters\n1gi9wp8s47jwbv4lpl1kxq3gf6xwy68"
