Hadarog was the chieftain of the Spleen Eaters tribe of orcs during the late 15 century DR.
He was massive even for an orc, cutting a very intimidating presence.
Hadarog was a merciful leader in that he offered quick deaths to those who gave him what he desired.
While he understood and spoke some words of Common, Hadarog sometimes chose to communicate to other races by means of a translator.
Unlike his fellow tribesmen, Hadarog wore a well-ornamented suit of plate mail armor,
He was served well by his tribes shaman, the particularly clever Glomred.
After the Eye of Gruumsh was stolen by a pair of humans, in the latter half of the , Hadarog and his orcs traveled across central Faer√ªn with the guidance of the chief orc god. They finally caught up to the thieves at the Underchasm, having a standoff upon one of the bridges that spanned the great expanse.
During the talks, a number of shades came forth to grab the Eye for themselves.
