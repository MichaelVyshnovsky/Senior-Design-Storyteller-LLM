'''Hadarog''' was the chieftain of the [[Spleen Eaters]] tribe of [[orc]]s during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was massive even for an orc, cutting a very intimidating presence.

==Personality==
Hadarog was a merciful leader in that he offered quick deaths to those who gave him what he desired.

==Abilities==
While he understood and spoke some words of [[Common]], Hadarog sometimes chose to communicate to other races by means of a translator.

==Possessions==
Unlike his fellow tribesmen, Hadarog wore a well-ornamented suit of [[plate mail]] armor,

==Relationships==
He was served well by his tribe's [[shaman]], the particularly clever [[Glomred]].

==History==
After the ''[[Eye of Gruumsh (relic)|Eye of Gruumsh]]'' was stolen by a pair of humans, in the latter half of the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, Hadarog and his orcs traveled across [[interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]] with the guidance of the [[Gruumsh|chief orc god]]. They finally caught up to the thieves at the [[Underchasm]], having a standoff upon one of the bridges that spanned the great expanse.

During the talks, a number of [[shade]]s came forth to grab the ''Eye'' for themselves.
