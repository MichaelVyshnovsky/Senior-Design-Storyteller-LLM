        "mainbody": "Umbra was the leader of the Dragonbloods, a Luskan gang. He was rumored to be a dragon but he was actually some sort of doppelganger. Umbras face constantly shifted and his true form was unknown.\nIn 1480 DR, while investigating the Fury plague sweeping Luskan, Myrin Darkdance and Kalen Dren visited Umbra at the Dragonbloods compound. Umbra had been Myrins lover many decades ago and when he kissed Myrin she absorbed his memories of her. Unfortunately, while absorbing Umbras memories, she inadvertently drained his life force, leaving him a pile of dust."
