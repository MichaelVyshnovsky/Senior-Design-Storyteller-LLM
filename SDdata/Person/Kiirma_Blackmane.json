        "mainbody": "'''Kiirma Blackmane''' was the cloakmaster of [[Riatavin]] for the [[Shadow Thieves]]. She was also a senior agent of the [[Moonstars]] (Tel'Teukiira) in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].",
        "Description": "Kiirma posed as an ordinary wealthy widow and businesswoman.",
        "Abilities": "She was an accomplished [[thief]] and a highly trained [[wizard]]. She was a former apprentice of [[Khelben Arunsun]].",
        "Possessions": "Kiirma Blackmane owned several taverns, boarding houses, and festhalls in the town of [[Riatavin]] which gave her income as well as being a front for more shady activities. She kept her spellcasting abilities secret by being very discreet and using her ''[[ring of translocation]]'' which allowed her to choose the point of origin for any spells she cast, up to 30 ft (9.1 m) away from her.",
        "Activities": "Kiirma was the cloakmaster of Riatavin in the Shadow Thieves, an organized crime syndicate which in [[1370 DR]] had a monopoly on the criminal activity in the town. Unbeknownst to them, she was also a senior agent for the Tel'Teukiira.",
        "Relationships": "As a former apprentice of Khelben Arunsun, she was loyal to him and his organization, passing necessary information about the Shadow Thieves to the Tel'Teukiira. However, she did not reciprocate: she never relayed news of the Moonstars to the [[Shadow Council|Shade Council]].\n\nKiirma commanded the loyalty of all her guildmasters except for [[Rekx Tihler]].",
        "History": "Kiirma was a former apprentice of [[Khelben Arunsun]], and his choice to make her a senior agent of the Tel'Teukiira was questioned by the other senior agents because she was a high-ranking member of the Shadow Thieves."
