'''Darrask Baergil''' was a member of the [[Riders of Mistledale|Riders]] of [[Mistledale]] in the [[Dalelands]] in the early-to-midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He led the organization as Captain from [[1335 DR|1335]] to [[1352 DR]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2011)/Captain Baergil}}

==Description==
Darrask had brown hair and a mustache, which changed to grey in his later years. He was of average height, and had particularly hairy forearms.

==Personality==
Darrask was described as worldly and calm, as well as polite. He was noted as being fearless but kindly, and a good judge of character. He was alert to threats of treachery. Although usually calm, Darrask was able to be stern, and even ruthless, when required.

He favored practicality over fashion, choosing to dress in a simple manner. He was not fussy about food, although he liked to eat roast [[boar]] in a red-[[wine]] [[mushroom]] sauce, and enjoyed drinking [[mint wine]], which brewed by [[gnome]]s from Western [[Sembia]]. He was enthralled by [[elf|elven]] dancing.

==Possessions==
Darrask always carried a sharp knife in his belt, and used this to carve figurines to pass time. He would give the figurines away to children or acquaintances. He was a collector of maps, and would write Mistledale lore in [[chapbook]]s. After his death, a magical ''[[Cormanthyrian elfblade]]'' was discovered in his possessions.

==History==
Darrask was born in the {{YearlinkName|1301}}, on a farm near [[Ashabenford]] in Mistledale. He was the second of seven children to parents [[Angram Baergil|Angram]] and [[Baelaetha Baergil]]. While growing up, he learned to be a good [[horse]]-rider and forester, and developed a love for strategy.

In the {{YearlinkName|1321}}, Darrask joined the Riders of Mistledale, a militia group in the dale. This was the same year when eleven of the riders retired from wounds or old age. He then progressed to the rank of Swordar in the {{YearlinkName|1332}}, as second in command to Captain [[Ranthorn Hawkhar]], after the previous Swordar, [[Galaerak Darrowman]], died.

In the {{YearlinkName|1335}}, Captain Ranthorn Hawkhar was maimed when his home was burned by raiders, and he was forced to retire to [[Sembia]]. Darrask replaced him as Captain of the Riders.

In his later years, Darrask suffered injuries to his right thigh, the first from being gored by a [[boar]], and then from brigand and [[Zhent]] weapons.

Darrask retired as Captain of the Riders in the {{YearlinkName|1352}}, after he had several dreams in which [[Tempus]] appeared to him and called upon him. Darrask then became a priest of Tempus, and rose quickly through the ranks of the [[church of Tempus]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the [[Zhent]]s, under the orders of [[Bane]], converged on [[Shadowdale]]. Witnessing a [[Zhentarim]] wizard raising [[undead]] in [[Essembra]], Darrask joined the war. During the main battle against the Zhent army, Darrask managed to summon his god, Tempus, sacrificing himself but winning the day.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/The Trail of Tears:A River of Blood}}

==Relationships==
Darrask's father was Angram Baergil and his mother was Baelaetha Baergil. He was the second born of seven siblings. His older brother was [[Athror Baergil]].

Darrask never married, but became close with five women of Mistledale and two traveling [[Harpers]].

Baergil was an acquaintance of [[Merith Strongbow]] of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]].
