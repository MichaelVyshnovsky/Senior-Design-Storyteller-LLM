        "mainbody": "arajah was a renowned pit fighter champion from Calimshan who lived some years before the late 14 century DR.\nKarajah became famous for remaining the undefeated gladiator for a decade while wearing nothing by a leather armor and armed with spiked gauntlets. It was believed that Karajah was impervious to his opponents attacks until it was discovered that his armor possessed a powerful enchantment. This revelation angered the pit-fighting spectators, and they overpowered Karajah and threw him into a pit with a well-armed ogre who broke every bone in the fighters body while the armor itself remained undamaged. The armor later became known as Karajahs Life and Death."
