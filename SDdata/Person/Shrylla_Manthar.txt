'''Shrylla Manthar''' was a noble inhabiting the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Shrylla fled from her family when faced with a forced marriage that she wanted nothing to do with. For many years she used a magical disguise to hide her identiy and lived on [[Runer's Alley]], posing as a minstrel who played the pipes. During this time she went by the name '''Shrylla of the Spiders''' and simply '''Runer'''. Her hair hid needles, [[dagger]]s, and even a trained venomous [[spider]], leading to her nickname.

One day she encounted a [[wizard]] who believed her pipes to be enchanted and threatening him with a magical attack. The wizard used his own [[magic]] to ''[[Dispel magic|dispel]]'' Shrylla's facade, revealing her idenity after so many years. Unmasked, Shrylla refused to return to her family and felt her death was near. She climbed [[Mount Waterdeep]] to view the sunrise for a final time and died there. Her body was not discovered for many months, and by that time all that remained was a skeleton with a single spider living within the skull.

The alley where she slept for 30 years was eventually called [[Runer's Alley]].
