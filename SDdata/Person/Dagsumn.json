        "mainbody": "Dagsumn () was a wizard in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.\nDagsumn was friendly and could be relied onto honor an agreement, but he had a hunger for new magic and was fastidious with regard to details. He preferred to work in the City of the Dead, far from the risk that someone might discover his secrets. When Dagsumm found about new magic items, he could become very irritating, asking very insistently for details.\nOutside of his experiments in the City of the Dead, Dagsumm passed his time at the Elfsong Tavern, near to the house he shared with his wife.\nDagsumn hailed from Port Llast and was tutored in the magical arts by Malchor Harpell at the Tower of Twilight. His apprenticeship with Malchor ended peacefully around the 1320s DR, but they had not spoken to each other since. Afterward, he came to live in Waterdeep, where he met his wife Kyrss Wands of the Wands family."
