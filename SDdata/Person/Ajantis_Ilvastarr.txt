Ajantis Ilvastarr was a noble paladin of Helm and a knight of the Order of the Radiant Heart that lived during the midâ€“14 century DR.

He was acquainted with another squire of the Radiant Heart, Anomen Delryn of Athkatla.
Ajantis was born to the noble Ilvastarr family of Waterdeep. During his youth he received exceptional martial training learning the art of sword-fighting under the tutelage of Myrmith Splendon.
Some years later he joined the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart and garnered the attention of the highly respected Keldorn Firecam. He served the elder knight as a squire and a member of the Radiant Heart Auxiliary.
When the iron crisis plagued the Sword Coast in the , Ajantis felt a call-to-action. He sought to investigate the bandits that plagued the region in order to attain the status within his order as a full-fledged knight.

Unbeknownst to them, the knights had illusions placed upon them by Lord Jierdan Firkraag. The magic gave the knights the appearance of ogres, and also made them perceive other humanoids the same way. As a result of the illusion, Ajantis and his companions were slain by Gorions Ward.
