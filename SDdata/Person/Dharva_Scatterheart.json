She enjoyed the open space, freedom from taxation, and the caravans that regularly pass through. Allied with the [[Shadow Thieves]], Dharva had established a small town called [[Greenest]] on the trail that led to [[Berdusk]]. She was not particularly happy to be in business with the likes of them, but tolerated it nonetheless.\n\n\n{{stub-person}}",
