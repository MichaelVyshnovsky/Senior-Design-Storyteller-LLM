'''Dobin Noreth''' was a member of the [[Stone-Cold Reavers]], a group of reckless adventurers who made their living sometimes as sellswords and sometimes as brigands.

==Relationships==
Dobin's mount was a well-dispositioned, retired racehorse named Four-Leaf Clover.

==History==
The group tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] from its lair, [[Icespire Hold]]. Dobin was sent to the nearby village of [[Phandalin]] to gather supplies while the rest of the Stone-Cold Reavers waited for the dragon to leave its lair so they could plunder it in its absence. However, Cryovain hadn't amassed any treasure yet.
