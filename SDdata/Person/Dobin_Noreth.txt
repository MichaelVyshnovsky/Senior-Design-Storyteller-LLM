Dobin Noreth was a member of the Stone-Cold Reavers, a group of reckless adventurers who made their living sometimes as sellswords and sometimes as brigands.
Dobins mount was a well-dispositioned, retired racehorse named Four-Leaf Clover.
The group tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young white dragon Cryovain from its lair, Icespire Hold. Dobin was sent to the nearby village of Phandalin to gather supplies while the rest of the Stone-Cold Reavers waited for the dragon to leave its lair so they could plunder it in its absence. However, Cryovain hadnt amassed any treasure yet.
