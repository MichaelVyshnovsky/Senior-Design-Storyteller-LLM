        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Kagha took over leadership of the [[Emerald Grove]] when her superior, [[archdruid]] [[Halsin]], went away on trek to uncover more about goings-on in the region. After a community of [[tiefling]] refugees from [[Elturel]] had been granted refuge in the grove by Halsin, and a child named [[Arabella]] from among their ranks attempted to steal the ''[[Idol of Silvanus]]'' from the druids.\n\nKagha used Teela to frighten the child into confessing her crime and had the viper remained poised to strike, and execute her brand of justice."
