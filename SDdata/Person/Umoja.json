        "mainbody": "Umoja was a druid devoted to Ubtao, active in the late 14 century DR.\nUmoja viewed life as a maze, constantly looking for the best path through it. Many considered him strange and cryptic, yet confident.\nThe druid carried a unique enchanted sickle â€“ Umojas Harvester, and a set of magic hide armor.\nDinosaurs were known as Ubtaos Children, and as a devote follower, Umoja always attempted to calm those that tried to attack the people he traveled with rather than fighting them. His animal companion was deinonychus named Yushai. Umoja treated the beast with gentle care and affection.\nUnlike many other Tabaxi druids of Ubtao who rarely ventured far from their home city of Mezro, Umoja found himself guided by his deitys will to the neighboring nation of Samarach in the . Ubtaos visions were targeting the new interloper deity Zehir, rising along with his yuan-ti minions. For a while after his arrival, the Tabaxi was able to gain entry to the city of Samargol, where he waited for the gods further guidance while he made a living through divine healing magics."
