'''Rothilion the Honorable''' was a famous and accomplished great [[human]] scholar, judge, and [[wizard]] of [[Myth Drannor]]. Rothilion died of old age long before the [[Weeping War]] and was laid to rest in a glorious [[Crypt of Rothilion|crypt]] in the [[Polyandrium]].

==Description==
Rothilion was tall human with a peaceful face, medium-short hair, and a thick mustache. He usually wore his ceremonial intricately sown and patterned [[robe]], and a seemingly plain mundane cloak.

==Personality==
In life, Rothilion had a deep appreciation for arts, crafts, and poetry, among other things. He owned countless volumes of poetry and prose that were entombed in his crypt's library and gallery halls. He felt fondness for the artisan crafts like smithing, jewelry, tannin, and fletching.

==Possessions==
Rothilion's crypt contained a many-volumed ''[[Tribunal of Myth Drannor]]'', a collection of records of Myth Drannor's legislature led by the High Judge himself.

Another voluminous collection of books locked in his crypt was ''[[Chronicles of Rothilion]]'', chronicling his live and career.

The main item of note in his possession was the powerful artifact known as ''[[Rothilion's Staff of Justice]]'', which was kept on his body inside the crypt.

==History==
During his long and fulfilling life, Rothilion worshiped [[Lathander]], [[Tyr]], and [[Oghma]]. He famously took an oath to forsake the [[Common]] language in favor of [[Elven]]. He focused his life on studying the lore and culture of Myth Drannor. He used that knowledge to develop, implement, and enforce laws that improved the lives of the citizens of the City of Song. The also became a committed patron of the arts, and authored many books. As he died of old age, he received a hero's burial in the Polyandrium district in a big crypt that held any items he appreciated in life.

In [[1369 DR]], this crypt was unsealed for the first time since his during the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s attempt to corrupt Myth Drannor's ''[[mythal]]'' via a resurgent ''[[pool of radiance]]''. The [[Crypt of Rothilion]] was one of the tombs they aimed to excavate in search of the ''[[Testament of Jade]]''. The cultist named [[Nevessam]] was placed in charge of breaching the crypt's arcane seal. The crypt was unsealed by the group of adventurers who started their quest searching kidnapped villagers and were entangled in the plot of defending the ruins and opposing the Cult.
