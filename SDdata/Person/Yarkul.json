        "mainbody": "Yarkul was a member of the Zhentarim in Darkhold in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.\nYarkul had raven black hair and green eyes.  She preferred to wear black robes with red trim. \nHer ambition was to become the lover and second-in-command of Sememmon, but her plotting was easily detectable by the others due to the icy expressions she displayed when displeased. \nThe wizard was the best student of Ashemmi, but she also claimed to have been tutored by Khelben Arunsun. She disliked her fellow apprentice, Kadorr, the most since he was Ashemmis favored student despite the fact that Yarkul was the hardest working of the four. She was often assigned to work with Angus Materi and the Outrider cavalry unit of Darkhold. \nYarkul was recruited by the Zhentarim as she was trying to escape arrest by the Purple Dragons for attempting to rob Vangerdahast Aeiulvanas laboratory. She was assigned to Darkhold to study under Ashemmi along with three other apprentices - Ilthond, Sashen, and Kadorr. As a trusted member of the Sememmons faction, Yarkul was peripherally involved in the hunt for Shandril Shessair"
