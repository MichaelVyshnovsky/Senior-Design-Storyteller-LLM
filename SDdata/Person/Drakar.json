        "Description": "Drakar was 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and weighed 250 pounds (113 kilograms). In his younger days, he had a muscular and athletic build, but he let himself go, fattening as he became a gourmand. He had black eyes, long, blond hair that was unclean and unkempt, and a scruffy beard as he went weeks between shaving.",
