Draped across his form was a robe of black silk that had ornately decorated collar and shoulder.\nTsabrak served as a Master of Sorcere academy in Menzoberranzan. He was the house wizard of House Xorlarrin before becoming Archmage of QXorlarrin.\nIn 1484 DR, Tsabrak was tasked by Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre to prepare to be the conduit of Lolth in a spell known as the Darkening, which was intended to prepare battlefield of the North for Quenthels takeover. The knowledge for the spell was given to him by the illithid Methil El-Viddenvelp. \nLater Tsabrak went to Eryndlyn in order to raise the Demon Weave for Lolth but was stopped at the last moment by some adventurers.\nTsabrak was cousin to Berellip Xorlarrin. Tsabrak and Ravel Xorlarrin, the house wizard, were bitter rivals. \nTsabrak had three sons the twins Alak Xorlarrin and Alystin Xorlarrin and the youngest Szordrin Xorlarrin, all died during the War of the Silver Marches."
