Stedd Moonstar was the Lord of the Moonstar  Waterdhavian noble family during the late 15 century DR.
Stedd was a young lord with dark hair who liked to dress in fine clothes.
Stedd Moonstar received the burden of leading his family at a particularly young age. Superstitious, he believed his family to be particularly unlucky, but refuted rumors about it being cursed.
Stedd Moonstar tried to rebuild its house to his former glory, by expanding its business activities and re-introducing his house to the nobility. With this goal in mind he organized the End of Winter Gala, which he intended to be the best of the season.
