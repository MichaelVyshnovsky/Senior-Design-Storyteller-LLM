'''Yojimbo''' was a [[sword]]-wielding wanderer who came to [[North Faerûn]] from the far-away continent of [[Kara-Tur]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Yojimbo was a [[human]] male who wore a warrior's garb found in the island nation of [[Wa]].

==Abilities==
He was skilled at wielding [[katana]]s and knew many eastern sword-wielding techniques like ''hayase'' and ''iainuki'' that landed multiple deadly katana stashes at the enemy, and ''kawari'', a technique that allowed Yojimbo to ''[[blink]]'' to the defense of his employer, deflecting damage in the process.

==History==
Yojimbo's life was a mystery. He fled his homeland sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] by stowing away, but what forced Yojimbo to flee was unknown, and he was likely to take that secret to his grave. He eventually reached the northern gem – the city of [[Neverwinter]], where he sold his services to those who could afford Yojimbo's blade.

Yojimbo was known to sell his services during the [[Feast of Lanterns]] celebration in Neverwinter that included envoys from [[Kozakura]]. During the festival, a Kozakuran pyrobolist fired imported Kara-Turan [[fireworks]] over the [[Hall of Justice]].
