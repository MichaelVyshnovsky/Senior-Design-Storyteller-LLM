        "mainbody": "Sharia Oriest was a shopkeeper of Rigors Fabrics in Skullport.\nRumors said that Sharia had once lived in Waterdeep, where she worked as a servant of a noblewoman, but she happened to see a murder and fled to Skullport to avoid the killer. By 1370 DR, Sharia managed, with her uncooperative daughter Villiane, a shop selling burlap and canvas.\nSharia had tried to educate Villiane on the beauty of the surface, but she spent all her free time with rogues and her mother feared that she would find a bad end."
