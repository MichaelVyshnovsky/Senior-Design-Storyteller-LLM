        "mainbody": "Boubakar was the spymaster of Golconda in Turmish in 1358 DR.\nBoubakar directed the spies of the small kingdom of Golconda.\nIn 1355 DR, the self-styled king of Muktar, Hetep, started a war against Golconda. In 1358 DR, during a war council, Boubakar reported to King Samakay that one of his men had discovered that Hetep battle plans were hidden in the small keep of Fort Blood. Boubakar convinced the king that they needed to send a small party to recover the papers in order to win the war, despite Count Belims objections. Samakay hired an adventuring party well-known to him to resolve the matter.\nAfter the surprise death of King Samakay without an heir, Boubakar presented a parchment signed by King Samakay on his deathbed that nominated the adventurers as temporary commanders of Golcondas army until a new king was crowned. Thanks to this, Golconda defeated Muktars troops for good at the Battle of the Wilma Pass."
