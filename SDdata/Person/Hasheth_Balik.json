        "mainbody": "'''Hasheth Balik''' was a rising noble and a member of the [[Knights of the Shield]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Hasheth was a minor son of the late [[Pasha]] [[Balik]] of [[Zazesspur]] born in [[1349 DR]]. He was a very competent schemer and information collector.\n\nIn [[1362 DR]], Hasheth enrolled in the [[School of Stealth]] to train as an assassin but did not remain long, although he learned some very useful skills. In that time, Hasheth also came into contact with the [[Harpers]] [[Danilo Thann]] and [[Arilyn Moonblade]].\n\nAfterwards, he settled as a landlord in the [[Venazir Lands]], where he bought an estate with his father's money. In [[1364 DR]], Hasheth impressed both [[Inselm Hhune]] and [[Alaric Hembreon]] by resolving a conflict with the [[elves]] of [[Tethyr]] in the [[Trade Way]] and with this he was sponsored to join the Knights. From there, he acted as an agent and apprentice of Hhune in the [[Zazesspur]] area. Sometimes, Hasheth acted as an informant for the Harpers but had no loyalty to them."
