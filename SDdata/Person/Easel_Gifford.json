        "Activities": "Based in the third ring of [[Glyth]], Easel led Code Helm in launching attacks on [[illithid]]s, both on the planet below and against their [[spelljammer]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Easel wore at all times a suit of [[full plate mail]] forged from [[platinum]] and polished to perfection, and also had a ''[[ring of protection]] +3''. Most notably, he wielded the \"Fist of Obedience\", as he called itâ€”actually a ''[[longsword]] +3''. The sword was not only sentient, it communicated telepathically with Easel. No one could lie in Easel's presence, for the sword would sense it and inform him of the deception."
