        "mainbody": "Easel Gifford, commonly called Easel of Amn, was a human paladin of Torm hailing from Amn and the leader of Code Helm in Realmspace in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nBased in the third ring of Glyth, Easel led Code Helm in launching attacks on illithids, both on the planet below and against their spelljammers.\nEasel wore at all times a suit of full plate mail forged from platinum and polished to perfection, and also had a ring of protection +3. Most notably, he wielded the \"Fist of Obedience\", as he called itâ€”actually a longsword +3. The sword was not only sentient, it communicated telepathically with Easel. No one could lie in Easels presence, for the sword would sense it and inform him of the deception."
