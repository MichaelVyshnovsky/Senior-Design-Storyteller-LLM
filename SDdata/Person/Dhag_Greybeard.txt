Dhag Greybeard was the Herald of both High Horn keep and the town of Waymoot in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
While residing at High Horn, Dhag served under Lord Commander Thursk Dembarron. At Waymoot, he served under Lord Filfar Woodband.
Circa 1367 DR, Dhag was actively training a bard named Alatha Korduis to succeed him as herald of Waymoot, since he held two positions concurrently at that time. She assisted him in his role at that town.
