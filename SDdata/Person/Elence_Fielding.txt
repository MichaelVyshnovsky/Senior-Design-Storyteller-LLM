'''Elence Fielding''' was a merchant of the village of [[Imnesvale (town)|Imnesvale]] in the [[Umar Hills]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Ah! Now that's a tale and a half. Mind you... don't listen to the dribble these villagers might tell you... they'd have you half-believing that a five-hundred-year-old witch is on the prowl.''|Elence Fielding}}

==Description==
Elence was an [[elf]] who wore [[wizard]]'s robes. She had a fair skin and brown hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the village of Imnesvale faced a slew of disappearances, and locals did not hesitate to blame the legendary [[Umar Witch]]. Elence sold her goods, including mundane [[armor]], [[weapon]]s, some jewelry, and an occasional ''[[potion of fire resistance]]''. However, her business suffered from strife, and the supplier mercantile company hadn't been bringing goods in. Unlike the villagers who blamed the Umar Witch and some fellow merchants who blamed nearby [[ogre]]s, Elence believed that the reason behind disappearance was simple â€“ [[wolves]].
