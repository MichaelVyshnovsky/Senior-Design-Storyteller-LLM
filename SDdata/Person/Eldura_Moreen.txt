Eldura Moreen was a great inventor and bloodforge mage in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).
Eldura worked tirelessly within the Hall of Wonder to discover the essence of the bloodforge. But the leader of the Legendary Campaign resolved that no-one should know the secret of what the gods had wrought, and went there to put an end to Elduras quest in a bloodforge battle.
