'''Nyerhite Verther''' was a [[Calishite]] silk merchant just before the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].

==Personality==
The merchant was not a scrupulous individual. When unhinged, he exploded in anger and fury. 

==History==
At the start of the Tyranny of Dragons in [[1489 DR]], Nyerhite traveled to [[Waterdeep]] with a load of Calishite silk, which unknown to him was infested with worms. Unsuspectingly, he journeyed in a great caravan full of [[Cult of the Dragon]] agents transporting treasures to help bring [[Tiamat]] into [[Toril]] from the [[Abyss]].
