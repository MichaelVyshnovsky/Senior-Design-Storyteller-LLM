Yan-C-Bin ( 
Yan-C-Bin commonly appeared to his followers as a tall, thin, elderly humanoid with long hair flowing in the wind. His true form was akin to a tornado.

It was said that all creatures in the sky of any plane feared Yan-C-Bin. But he also had a strong sense of honor and would generously reward those who helped him.

Many primordials considered Yan-C-Bin to be untrustworthy and avoided him.
Yan-C-Bin and those that served him had a strong dislike of the servants of Ogrémoch and the Prince of Evil Earth himself. But his greatest rival is the good Princess of Air, Chan, against whom he has been waging a secret war of information and sabotage.
He was worshiped by the Cult of the Howling Hatred, and their companion organization, the Feathergale Knights.
During the Dawn War, Yan-C-Bin learned of the existence of the Elder Elemental Eye and convinced other primordials, including Olhydra and Imix, to join forces and serve that power in the hopes that they would be able to conquer the world. Following the Dawn War, the gods sealed Yan-C-Bin inside a mobile palace made of solidified air.
