==Description==
Yan-C-Bin commonly appeared to his followers as a tall, thin, elderly humanoid with long hair flowing in the wind. His true form was akin to a tornado.

==Personality==
Yan-C-Bin was flighty and quick to react to things, but he was also a rational thinker with a desire for intellectual stimulation and a love of scholarly pursuits. It was said that all creatures in the sky of any plane feared Yan-C-Bin. But he also had a strong sense of honor and would generously reward those who helped him.

Many primordials considered Yan-C-Bin to be untrustworthy and avoided him.

Yan-C-Bin and those that served him had a strong dislike of the servants of [[Ogrémoch]] and the Prince of Evil Earth himself. But his greatest rival is the good Princess of Air, [[Chan]], against whom he has been waging a secret war of information and sabotage.

He was worshiped by the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]], and their companion organization, the [[Feathergale Knights]].

==History==
During the [[Dawn War]], Yan-C-Bin learned of the existence of the Elder Elemental Eye and convinced other primordials, including [[Olhydra]] and [[Imix]], to join forces and serve that power in the hopes that they would be able to conquer the world. Following the Dawn War, the gods sealed Yan-C-Bin inside a mobile palace made of solidified air.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Yan-C-Bin was summoned to the [[Throne of Blood]] on [[Gehenna]] by the mortal devotee of [[Bhaal]], [[Amelyssan]]. The Prince of Evil Air was present during the battle between her and the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Abdel Adrian]].<ref>

During the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], circa the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, [[Aerisi Kalinoth]] and the Cult of Howling Hatred sought to summon Yan-C-Bin to [[Faerûn]] in the [[Howling Caves]] around the ruins of [[Besilmer]].
