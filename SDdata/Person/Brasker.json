        "mainbody": "Brasker was a warrior in service to the Cult of the Dragon in the mid-14 century DR.\nBrasker was more sanguine than Holvan about the task but still believed they should focus their energy on slaying other chasers of spellfire, the Zhentarim in particular, expecting reinforcements later on.\nHolvan and Brasker were sent to the caravan led by Orthil Voldovan from Scornubel to Waterdeep in late , which the spellfire wielder Shandril Shessair had boarded. They were ordered to capture her, though neither liked their chances of success. During one of the ambushes the caravan faced, they accidentally blabbed about their allegiance within earshot of Shandril, who was hiding inside a wagon.\nBrasker and Holvan slew Praulgar, revealing him as a Zhentarim, in an attempt to ingratiate themselves with Shandril. However, when Brasker introduced them by name, Shandril had already overheard them to be Cult members, and launched spellfire at their eyes, blinding and severely injuring them Narm finished them off with a knife.\nTheir allegiance was known to the Zhentarim scriers Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle, and to the Red Wizards in the service of Hulrivior."
