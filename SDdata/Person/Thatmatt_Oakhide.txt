{{quote|''If you're here to report something, don't bother - the Fist don't give a damn.''|Thatmatt Oakhide}}

==Description==
Thatmatt was a [[shield dwarf]] with a light skin tone, brown eyes, massive bulbous nose, long brown hair and a lush long brown beard. 

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Thatmatt and Bruha faced the dangers of increased crime levels and looming war. Thatmatt was mugged twice in one month despite him always carrying a blade and the [[Flaming Fist]] outpost in the [[Basilisk Gate]] did not bother to act on the couple's reports. Like so many commoners of the Gate, Bruha and Thatmatt were unable to leave the city because they were too poor, and were too scared to stay.
