        "mainbody": "'''Xanda Pennywell''' was a weaver from the hamlet of [[Liam's Hold]] who sold her textiles via her husband in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Xanda Pennywell was a slender brown-haired woman with elven features and skillfully nimble fingers that masterfully worked the finest [[silk]]s and [[satin]]s, weaving beautiful garments. Xanda's craved and engraved work table was always littered with copious sheets of various dress sketches and designs.",
        "Possessions": "''[[Dwenthor's cape of bravery]]'' was an [[enchanted]] [[cloak]] gifted to Xanda by her past lover to protect her from harsh [[Sword Coast]] winters. After the lover's departure, she kept the magic cape in case she ever needed [[coin]].\n\nXanda kept a diary and treated the book as her friend.",
        "Relationships": "Xanda was a loyal customer of [[Lashar]]'s purchasing lovely fabrics from him. She used some of the purchased materials to weave a richly colored [[gold]]en and purple [[silk]] scarf for [[Jemmy Kirschtorte]], the baker's eight year old daughter's birthday.\n\nXanda and [[Michael Pennywell]] loved each other very well and the young woman missed her husband mere hours after he left for Baldur's Gate to trade.",
        "History": "Sometime before [[1372 DR]], Xanda was courted by a [[Cormyr]]ean [[War Wizards|War Wizard]], [[Dwenthor of the Winds]], who dwelt in a humble stone cottage in the pastures of Liam's Hold. Eventually, Xanda was swayed by the older man and they engaged in a romantic relationship that was cut shirt by a group of mercenaries who came to return Dwenthor to the War Wizards' service. It was revealed that Dwenthor was a deserter and a coward. After his departure, he's never returned to Liam's Hold, and eventually, Xanda married a honest merchant man - [[Michael Pennywell]].\n\nBy 1372 DR, Xanda's and her husband's business was blossoming and kept the couple busy. Xanda spent her days weaving and sowing garments while her husband, [[Michael Pennywell]], sold their goods in the city of Baldur's Gate. With a busy work schedule and in high demand, Xanda did not accept new orders as she had already accumulated over two months' worth of work ahead of her. Xanda's orders included drapery, embroidery, weaved rugs, tablecloths, seat covers, or other mundane cloth items of intricate design. Her exercise, however, laid in creating capes and shawls. In 1372 DR, the young half-elf's husband set out to the annual cloth market in Baldur's Gate. The husband spent over two months in the Gate, away from Liam's Hold, and was two weeks late with his return.\n\nIn 1372 DR, Xanda Pennywell volunteered to keep patrols and understaffed Liam's Hold militia after strange events started happening in the hamlet: people were suffering from nightmares, late-night visitors, and [[Rab Bitnez]] was even drained of blood. One night, Xanda was on a night patrol with a young militiaman recruit [[Hegrad‎‎]]. The man noticed a shadowy figure stalking them and disappearing into the mist but thought it to be a trick of darkness or simply a thief. Later, Hegrad‎ found Xanda's home's door open and the woman herself - missing. The weaver was taken by [[Sieronius Dethick]], an ancient [[drow]] [[vampire]] imprisoned under the hamlet centuries prior. The [[Hero of Daggerford]] was taken with the investigation and eventually found Xanda Pennywell's unconscious body in the grasps of the undead creature. Sieronius was planning to mesmerize the woman and force her to marry him to break the curse that kept the vampire trapped. Several stories were told of Xandas' fate following the abduction. Some claimed the Hero slew the evil undead and freed the woman, and some said that another woman was sacrificed in Xanda's place - [[Lula Redcap]] from [[Daggerford]]. Lastly, some even claimed that the Hero let the vampire have his new bride and leave the hamlet forever."
