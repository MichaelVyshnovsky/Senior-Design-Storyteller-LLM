Lord '''Yoraeida''' was a commander from [[Evermeet]] that led [[elven]] forces in the [[Army of the North]] during the [[Return of the Archwizards (event)|Return of the Archwizards]] saga of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Forgive me if I find your judgement someone clouded.|Lord Yoraeida, to [[Laeral Silverhand]].}}

==Personality==
He was a haughty individual that looked down upon [[human]]s and other non-elves, extending even to a [[chosen]] of the gods.

==Activities==
Yoraeida led a force of over 500 elven warriors and [[mage]]s.

==History==
When the leaders of the Army of the North rallied their forces against the [[phaerimm]] in the [[Forest of Wyrms]] in [[Mirtul]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, they faced an army of thousands of [[gnoll]]s and [[bugbear]]s. While [[Laeral Silverhand]] did her best to boost spirits about the seemingly insurmountable odds, Yoraeida and others remained pessimistic about their success. Yoraeida even went so far as to say Laeral was distracted by her desire to reunite with her partner [[Khelben Arunsun]], who remained within the borders of beleaguered [[Evereska]]. 

Eventually, the Army of the North was able to translocate via ''[[teleportation circle]]'' all the way to the [[Greycloak Hills]], outside the [[shadowshell]] in relief of the Evereskan defenders, within a few mere hours. This masterful feat of war time logistics was all for naught however, as the army's [[Shadovar]] allies abandoned them soon after their arrival. [[Enchantment]]s were placed upon Yoraeida and the allied army's leaders so they turned on one another, and their collective detection devices were ultimately ineffective. The phaerimm rapidly descended upon the allied forces and everyone was forced to flee the onslaught.
