Marane was an exiled archdevil in the mid-late 14 century DR.
She affected to be almost unthinkingly hungry.
She had ruby skin, horse heads for breasts, long nails, like talons, cloven feet, a tail, and wings.
During her fight with Elminster Aumar, she only ever acted physically.
In her cave, she had stored a number of enchanted items including a wand of lightning, and a rod created by Telamont Tanthul.
While Elminster, trapped in Avernus, found a brief respite from Nergal in , he was attacked by Marane, who intended to eat him, explaining she was hungry enough to disregard Nergals claim over him. Elminster fled into her cave, where he found some magic items he used them, and his own silver fire, to slay her and prepare an ambush for Nergal afterwards.
