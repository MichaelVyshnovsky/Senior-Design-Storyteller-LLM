'''Marane''' was an exiled [[archdevil]] in the mid-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She affected to be almost unthinkingly hungry.

==Appearance==
She had ruby skin, horse heads for breasts, long nails, like talons, cloven feet, a tail, and wings.

==Abilities==
During her fight with [[Elminster Aumar]], she only ever acted physically.

==Possessions==
In her cave, she had stored a number of [[enchanted]] items including a [[wand of lightning]], and a rod created by [[Telamont Tanthul]].

==History==
While Elminster, trapped in [[Avernus]], found a brief respite from [[Nergal (archdevil)|Nergal]] in {{yearlink|1372}}, he was attacked by Marane, who intended to eat him, explaining she was hungry enough to disregard Nergal's claim over him. Elminster fled into her cave, where he found some magic items; he used them, and his own silver fire, to slay her and prepare an ambush for Nergal afterwards.
