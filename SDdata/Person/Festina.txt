{{Quote|''Just look at her, ha ha! She hasn't been this excited since her birthday!''|Ma Festina}}

==Description==
Ma Festina was a [[human]] woman with a light skin tone, light brown eyes, and long, wavy blond hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, Festina brought her daughter, Ch'kk'ch, to a performance of some showy magics by three spellslingers, on the [[Murl's Rest]] plaza in front of [[Sorcerous Sundries]]. The mother was delighted by her daughter's joy seeing the magical show.
