        "mainbody": "Elizar Dryflagon was a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Elemental Flame at the Scarlet Moon Hall.\nAn older male human, Elizar customarily wore robes. \nElizar wielded a Dagger +1 and carried a pipe through which he could summon four smoke mephits.\nElizar was once a druid until he turned to the worship of Imix. Soon he became one of the leaders of the Eternal Flame.\nIn 1491 DR during the Elemental Evil crisis, Elizar and his minions, posing as the obscure (and fictitious) Circle of the Scarlet Moon druid circle, set up camp at Scarlet Moon Hall and called for help in performing the Rite of the Wicker Giant in order to restore the balance of nature in the troubled region, or so he claimed.\nAt last, Elizar was confronted and defeated by some adventurers."
