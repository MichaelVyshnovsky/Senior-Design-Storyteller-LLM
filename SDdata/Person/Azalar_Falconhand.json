        "mainbody": "Azalar Falconhand was a ranger of Mielikki and the son of Dove and Florin Falconhand.\nAzalar, even at the age of 16, was already over 180cm (6ft) tall and still growing. He had the same powerful build as his father and the silver hair of his mother which he tied back in a thick braid. Tiny horns and almond shaped eyed revealed his fey ancestry.\nAzalar was the direct result of Mielikki ordering his parents to marry and beget a child, with the approval of Mystra. Working with the fey of Shadowdale, Azalar earned the ire of the Zhentarim when they attacked the Dale in the summer of 1374 DR, subsequently imprisoning him in Castle Krag.\nAzalar was later freed by rebels seeking to overthrow the Zhentish army in Shadowdale where he confronted the horrific Susurrus under the direction of Mielikki. By leading the Susurrus out of the Fey crossroads where the monster had been trapped, Azalar and a band of adventurers were able to defeat the beast once and for all. This would lead to Azalar and his fey allies aiding the folk of Shadowdale in its emancipation.\nAfter Mourngrym Amcathra resigned from his role as Lord of Shadowdale when the rebellion was successful, Azalar was elected as Mourngryms replacement. Azalar himself retired from the position in 1459 DR.Web of the Spider Queen doesnt contain any specific dates but it does say that it is the year before the Old Skull Inns 200 year anniversary (which would make the current year 1479 DR) and that Azalar retired twenty years ago.\nAzalar used +1 mithral chain shirt, +1 longsword, +1 short sword, and a composite longbow."
