        "mainbody": "Ilstan Narbrace was a veteran member of the Purple Dragons in Suzail during the late 15 century DR.\nAround 1479 DR, Hethel and four more Dragons acted as escorts for the War Wizard of Cormyr Ellard Gauntur in his pursuit of the renegade Rorskryn Mreldrake to Marsember through a portal. They found their renegade in the shape of a woman, but Gauntur recognized their quarry because of a stain in Mreldrakes robes right at the moment of crossing through the portal as they expounded on this to their retinue, Ilstan quickly pushed their leader through the same portal. Then the evil vampire archmage Manshoon sent the death knight Targrael after them to hide Mreldrakes trail.\nTargrael caught up to Ilstan Narbrace while running up a flight of stairs at the kings tower in Marsember on the other side of the portal, and punched her sword through his helm, without any fight."
