'''Janesta Leafgrace''' was a [[wood elf]]Janesta is described as both a half-elf and as a wood elf in p. 138 of chapter 11. Given that the description of a half elf is given from Raidon's perspective, while the Master of the Yuirwood speaks of her as a wood elf, this article assumes that Raidon's perception of her as a half elf is likely in error, expecting the Master to be more familiar with the features of elves and half-elves both. and [[Natal Peacethorn]]'s friend.

==History==
On {{yearlink|1375}}, Jamesta was part of a group that studied standing stones which showed the path to a [[Stardeep/Causeway|causeway]]. One day they found the mist between the stones dissipating and the path open for the first time. Entering, she and [[Natal Peacethorn]] saw the Gate of [[Stardeep]]. The day after, their encampment was attacked by [[Empyrean Knights]].{{cite book/Stardeep|137-139|11}} As she had gotten up early to examine a [[cougar]]'s tracks, she was not at the encampment, leaving her as the only survivor. During the attack, she saw Natal dragged out of his home.{{cite book/Stardeep|101-104|9}}

She hid during the attack, and made it back to [[Relkath's Foot]], where she told of the attack, with the aid of the [[Masters of the Yuirwood]]. Janesta identified the precise location of the Causeway Gate to Stardeep to all present.
