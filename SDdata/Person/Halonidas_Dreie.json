        "mainbody": "'''Halonidas Dreie''' was a [[wizard]] living in [[Scornubel]] with an eye for business and the wealth it could bring, ''circa'' the [[1340 DR|Year of the Lion, 1340 DR]] until his death around the [[1350 DR|Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR]].{{Cite dragon/271/The New Adventures of Volo: The Great Goblet|88}}",
        "Personality": "Halonidas was haughty and cruel, even to his apprentices.",
        "Abilities": "He was an accomplished spellcaster who bested a number of journeyman mages, survived three assassination attempts,The source does not name him as the inventor of the spell but says \"one conspirator was a wizard who'd mastered a spell\" and then mentions his name later as \"one leading conspirator\".",
        "Possessions": "Halonidas got rich off the spoils of dirty business practices by the cabal of merchants of which he was a member. After his death, his wealth was apparently split between the conspirators that brought him down, including a set of a dozen or more [[gold]]en goblets that became the symbol of the organization that was formed while standing around his corpse&mdash;the [[Great Goblet]].",
        "Relationships": "He was domineering and abusive to his apprentices, especially [[Glaratha Starntempest]] and her beautiful younger sister [[Ileldra Starntempest|Ileldra]], of whom he took advantage and coerced their submission. Glaratha was particularly incensed about their treatment and both were eager to listen when conspirators approached them with an offer of support in arranging his demise.",
        "History": "Halonidas joined a nameless cabal of merchants in Scornubel sometime around 1340 DR and provided [[magic]]al services to the group. Their aim was to bring down certain [[Waterdhavian]] noble merchant families, or at least push them out of the local economy. As tensions escalated, the nobles hired mages to pose as mercenaries to surprise any attackers on their caravans. Halonidas was instrumental in dealing with the magical threats and felt it gave him the authority to speak for the group and hand out marching orders. This inevitably led to conflict and confrontation with the other merchant members of the cabal who did not feel he had the right or even a mandate. Three times they attempted to get rid of him and three times Halonidas killed the rivals that attacked him. Seemingly unassailable, the remaining conspirators approached his apprentices and found willing accomplices in the Starntempest sisters. Sometime around 1350 DR, they caught him in a relatively unguarded moment and drowned him while he was bathing."
