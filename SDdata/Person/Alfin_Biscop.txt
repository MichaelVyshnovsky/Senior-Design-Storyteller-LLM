'''Alfin Biscop''' was a wealthy [[cleric]] of [[Torm]] and an [[adventurer]] who had retired to [[Neverwinter]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon+/14/Fiction: Prelude (Tomb of Annihilation)}}

{{Quote|''Perhaps it was natural to assume you're meant to take the black king; to vanquish [[evil]]. But no; [[Chess (game)|chess]] is a game of self-discipline and mastery. You were meant to take the white king instead; to overcome yourself. You did not even see this option, did you?''|Alfin Biscop}}

==Description==
Alfin came under the effects of the [[death curse]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, which caused his body to wither and rot: his hair fell out, his skin sagged, and his nose decayed away. However, it did not impact his sharp mind or his deep voice.

==Personality==
{{fq
| text   = These creatures are evil, either by their inherent nature, or by the actions they’ve chosen. I could have destroyed them all. I destroyed many of them. Others, I’ve allowed to exist and put into some goodly service.

}}He was famous for his love of chess.

He valued self-discipline. He had no mercy or sympathy for thieves or evildoers unless he had a use for them, and he had no issue with keeping "evil" creatures imprisoned or enslaved if doing so could further the greater good.

When he became stricken with the death curse, he began to question his choices and his worldview, wondering whether he might be being punished for his actions or for his wealthy lifestyle.

==Abilities==
He was a powerful healer, able to slow the course of [[poison]]s that were supposed to be instantly fatal.

==Possessions==
He had a mansion in Neverwinter, the floors of which were decorated in a checker pattern to look like a [[lanceboard]]. He displayed many trophies from his adventuring days, including a [[gorgon]] which had been fashioned into a table and an [[iron golem]] which had been fashioned into a [[magical]] door; a stuffed [[owlbear]] and [[girallon]]; an [[orrery]]; and a number of weapons, including a [[barbazu]]'s [[glaive]], an [[erinyes]]'s [[rope]], and an [[osyluth]]'s [[Pole arm|hooked polearm]].

The trap which protected his vault was armed with an incurable poison from the tail of [[Geryon]] himself, and consisted of many [[mephit]]s and [[imp]]s trapped within glass chess pieces.

He owned a special [[telescope]] fashioned from living, malfunctioning [[modron]]s which he used to study the [[Cosmology|cosmos]].

In battle, he had wielded an [[adamantine]] [[mace]].

==Activities==
Alfin was a minor celebrity in Neverwinter such that his presence was looked for and expected during [[:Category:Holidays and festivals|holidays and festivals]]. He was also believed to occasionally set out to travel [[Faerûn]] on his own.

==Relationships==
Alfin was on good terms with the [[Harpers]], and tended to trust them. He also had a number of trusted servants, some of whom he would send out on missions of great importance. He maintained limited contact with his old adventuring companions.

He also had many enemies who would gladly strike him down in the streets if they could.

==History==
In his youth, Alfin had campaigned in the name of Torm. He had faced many powerful foes and notably many [[devil]]s. He was said to have carried a chessboard on all of his expeditions, and even to have gambled his life in games of chess against a [[dragon]] on two separate occasions: once against a [[silver dragon]] in which he won, and once against a [[blue dragon]] in which he lost and had to be revived by his temple. He was one of several members of his adventuring group who had died and been ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]''.

When he retired to his mansion in Neverwinter, he commissioned the [[warlock]] [[Rokh Manti]] to create both a devious chess-based trap to protect his vault as well as his telescope for studying the [[planes]].

{{fq
| text   = Our resurrection... perhaps it never was a divine blessing, but a temporal one… the return to life, paid for by our future selves. Is that all healing ever was? I wonder now... Or perhaps we are being punished for our transgressions. Instead of this manor house, was I meant to live in a hovel? And yet these material things have furthered my cause. After all, must I strike with a bare fist, when I can kill so many more devils with an adamantine mace? Must I pay for a beggar’s supper, when I can host affairs here, and fete the politicians, and convince them to pay for so many more suppers for the poor?

}}When the death curse began, Alfin withdrew from the public eye as he tried to find out the cause of it. He sent his servants far and wide to learn of the curse and to determine the fate of his old adventuring companions, and used his modron telescope to study the planes. Eventually, as he lost hope as his body decayed, and dismissed his remaining servants.

After six months, his absence led many to start to worry about where he had gone, and also led the [[Shadow Thieves]] of Neverwinter to assume that his mansion was unattended. After having learned of his love of chess from Rokh Manti, they correctly surmised that his vault would be locked in some way involving the game. Thus, they had one of their agents, [[Pion]], sharpen his chess skills in preparation for burgling the mansion. This went poorly, with Pion fatally poisoned. However, Alfin slowed the poison in his system, and blackmailed the thief into delivering a message to the Harpers: he believed that he had finally discovered that the death curse had something to do with the flow of [[positive energy]] to [[Toril]] from the [[Positive Energy plane]].
