        "mainbody": "'''Chancil Crystalheart''' was a [[human]] mage of [[Memnon]] in [[Calimshan]] in the 1350s [[DR]].{{Cite comic/Shell Game|1, 11-12, 17-22}}<ref group=\"note\">An unnamed, non-speaking wizard of similar (though not identical) build and dress appears as one of two mages in Duum's employ in issue #16, \"[[The Last Betrayal]]\", but it is not clear if this is Chancil or another wizard. Typically, comics characters retain their costumes for familiarity, so this is assumed not to be Chancil. However, if he is, he would have participated in the final capture of Conner, Vajra, and the [[Catlord (old)|Catlord]], accompanied Duum to [[Gladsheim]], and finally been banished from the plane by the Catlord, his fate unknown.",
        "Relations": "Chancil was a subordinate of [[Pasha]] [[Abon Duum]] of [[Manshaka]]. Furthermore, Duum possessed Chancil's actual heart encased in a crystal and kept in his home in Manshaka, while a connecting crystal was embedded in Chancil's chest where his heart should be. Thus, he was called \"Crystalheart\". With the heart, Duum knew when Chancil acted disloyally and punished him with agony as his heart beat more rapidly, and thus ensured his obedience. \n\nChancil paid a band of thugs and mage apprentices to protect him and keep away those who sought him. Such men were equipped with wands of ''[[telekinesis]]''.",
        "History": "In the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], Chancil and a group of bounty hunters traveled to [[Waterdeep]] and the [[Selûne's Smile]] tavern. Slipping a potion into the drinks, they rendered all the patrons unconscious and kidnapped the [[cat child]].{{Cite comic/Shackles of the Past |24}}\n\n[[File:Memnon - comic.jpg|thumb|left|Chancil in the streets of Memnon.]]\nChancil returned to Memnon, where he kept the cat child prisoner in his house prior to delivering him to Duum. He briefly contemplated keeping the boy and his powers for himself, until, from afar, Duum used his captive heart to torture him into obedience. After following his thugs, [[Conner]], [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], and [[Salabak]] spied on Chancil and made a bid to rescue the boy: Conner pretended to have caught Vajra—an escaped slave of Duum—and required Chancil's assistance in taking her to Manshaka. Initially, Chancil disbelieved Conner and [[summon monster|summoned]] a [[cyclops]] to beat him, but Vajra made no reaction or move to aid him, convincing Chancil of the ruse and so he dispelled the monster. He gave Conner half the reward for Vajra and claimed her, but the escape and rescue attempt failed. Conner and Vajra only just got away, abandoning the cat child, while Salabak slew one of Chancil's apprentices.\n\nDuum ultimately received the cat child, and Vajra too.{{Cite comic/Cat & Mouse|1}}",
        "Description": "Chancil was very tall and slender and wore robes and jewelry. Notably, he had a large octagonal rose-hued gemstone embedded in the center of his chest."
