        "History": "Pierson was one of the members of [[West Harbor]] militia. He was a reluctant friend of thieves, since he kept goods he collected over the years. During the battle against [[duergar]] and [[githyanki]], Pierson could've been asked to join the attack. Regardless, he was killed in the battle."
