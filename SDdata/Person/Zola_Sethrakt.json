        "Appearance": "Zola was a youthful-looking woman, appearing quite comely. She never went anywhere without numerous bone and jet ornaments swinging from her neck and sliding on her arms. As a result, a clatter accompanied her every breath.",
        "Activities": "Zola was the representative of a small group of necromancers in the council of zulkirs during the war of Thay. These mages evaded [[Szass Tam]]'s control but were not the most powerful or even intelligent of their order.",
        "History": "When it became apparent that a war against Szass Tam could not be won, [[Nevron]] had her killed by one of his [[demon]]s, being annoyed of her constant claims to be his equal as zulkir.",
