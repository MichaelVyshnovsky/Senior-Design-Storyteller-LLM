        "Description": "Agrak's goblin body was lean and tall in shape, with six fingers on each hand. Emblematic of his descent from Graz'zt, his skin was black as [[obsidian]] and his head bore a crown of horns.",
        "History": "Agrak was banished from the [[Lowerdark]] and settled among a goblin clan living in an [[Upperdark]] tunnel very near the surface city of [[Hillsfar]]. Quickly, Agrak gained supremacy inside the clan, who soon became known as the [[Skullspike tribe]]. Thanks to his leadership and Graz'zt's influence, Agrak's tribe grew.\n\nMany years later, ''circa'' [[1486 DR]], Agrak led his tribe in a number of raids on surrounding farms, taking treasures, goods, and [[slave]]s. Usually the Skullspikes killed all witnesses to their raids but in the last raid, two [[human]] workers managed to escape alive.{{Cite adventurers league/Quelling the Horde|5}}\n\nUltimately, he was defeated by an adventuring party hired by [[Glenna Moonsmith]].{{Cite adventurers league/Quelling the Horde|18}}",
        "Activities": "He typically relaxed in his room together with his [[carrion crawler]] mount [[Vellicatus]].",
        "Personality": "Agrak had all the megalomania, hedonism, and madness of his forebears. He had shaped his clan like the court of Graz'zt.",
        "Relationship": "Agrak was an old friend of the [[incubus]] [[Mardivec Gentlecut]].{{Cite adventurers league/Quelling the Horde|16}} He was a direct descendant of Graz'zt, being born from a cambion offspring of Graz'zt and a goblin chieftain."
