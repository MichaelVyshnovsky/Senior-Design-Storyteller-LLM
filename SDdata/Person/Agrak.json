        "mainbody": "ord Agrak () was a cambion goblin lord and chief servant of Grazzt in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.\nAgraks goblin body was lean and tall in shape, with six fingers on each hand. Emblematic of his descent from Grazzt, his skin was black as obsidian and his head bore a crown of horns.\nAgrak was banished from the Lowerdark and settled among a goblin clan living in an Upperdark tunnel very near the surface city of Hillsfar. Quickly, Agrak gained supremacy inside the clan, who soon became known as the Skullspike tribe. Thanks to his leadership and Grazzts influence, Agraks tribe grew.\nMany years later, circa 1486 DR, Agrak led his tribe in a number of raids on surrounding farms, taking treasures, goods, and slaves. Usually the Skullspikes killed all witnesses to their raids but in the last raid, two human workers managed to escape alive.\nUltimately, he was defeated by an adventuring party hired by Glenna Moonsmith.\nHe typically relaxed in his room together with his carrion crawler mount Vellicatus.\nAgrak had all the megalomania, hedonism, and madness of his forebears. He had shaped his clan like the court of Grazzt.\nAgrak was an old friend of the incubus Mardivec Gentlecut. He was a direct descendant of Grazzt, being born from a cambion offspring of Grazzt and a goblin chieftain."
