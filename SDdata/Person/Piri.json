        "mainbody": "Piri was a drow wizard from Sshamath.\nPiri was an apprentice in the College of Mages of his city, known for his skill in piecing together arcane texts. He was an acolyte of the skin.\nIn 1377 DR, Qarlynd Melarn invited him to his new College of Ancient Arcana. There, Piri unlocked an ancient Ritual of Bonding and bonded himself with a quasit, Glizn.\nHowever, Piri tried to betray Qarlynd just before the casting of the elven high magic spell that erased Kiaransalee from everyones minds. Qarlynd killed him and afterward resurrected him. Qarlynd used the kiira of Kraanfhaors Door to remove Piris disloyalty from his mind.\nIn 1379 DR, however, Piri started to act strange, worrying Qarlynd. He started a magic duel with his fellow Eldrinn Elpragh. He summoned a deepspawn of the Breeders Guild against Eldrinn before being knocked out. Later Master Qarlynd arrived and defeated the monster.\nLater, Qarlynd discovered that the quasit bonded with Piri had manipulated him to kill Eldrinn to remove a possible rival. Qarlynd cast a spell to send the demon back to the Abyss, but Piris body also disappeared.\nLater, it was discovered that Glizn had gained control of Piris body. He was summoned by StreeaValsharess Zolond, who asked him about Master Qarlynd."
