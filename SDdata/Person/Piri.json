        "History": "Piri was an apprentice in the [[College of Mages]] of his city, known for his skill in piecing together arcane texts. He was an [[acolyte of the skin]].\n\nIn [[1377 DR]], [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] invited him to his new [[College of Ancient Arcana]]. There, Piri unlocked an ancient [[Ritual of Bonding]] and bonded himself with a [[quasit]], [[Glizn]].\n\nHowever, Piri tried to betray Q'arlynd just before the casting of the [[elven high magic]] spell that erased [[Kiaransalee]] from everyone's minds. Q'arlynd killed him and afterward resurrected him. Q'arlynd used the [[kiira (disambiguation)|''kiira'']] of [[Kraanfhaor's Door]] to remove Piri's disloyalty from his mind.\n\nIn [[1379 DR]], however, Piri started to act strange, worrying Q'arlynd. He started a magic duel with his fellow [[Eldrinn Elpragh]]. He summoned a [[deepspawn]] of the [[Breeder's Guild]] against Eldrinn before being knocked out. Later Master Q'arlynd arrived and defeated the monster.\n\nLater, Q'arlynd discovered that the quasit bonded with Piri had manipulated him to kill Eldrinn to remove a possible rival. Q'arlynd cast a spell to send the [[demon]] back to the [[Abyss]], but Piri's body also disappeared.\n\nLater, it was discovered that Glizn had gained control of Piri's body. He was summoned by Streea'Valsharess [[Zolond]], who asked him about Master Q'arlynd."
