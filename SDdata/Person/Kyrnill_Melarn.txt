'''Kyrnill Melarn''' (formerly known as '''Kyrnill Kenafin''') was formerly the [[matron mother]] of [[House Kenafin]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] and later the First Priestess of [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]].

==History==
Starting before [[1361 DR]] and lasting until [[1383 DR]], Kyrnill Kenafin served as the matron mother of House Kenafin. When House Kenafin and [[House Horlbar]] merged to form House Melarn, Kyrnill allowed [[Zhindia Melarn|Zhindia Horlbar]] to assume leadership of the house, expecting that Zhindia would die in a power struggle. Zhindia survived, however, and as First Priestess, Kyrnill found great pleasure in seeing Zhindia's power undermined.
