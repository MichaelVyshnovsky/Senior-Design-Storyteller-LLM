{{quote|I used to play in these very streets when I was young, myself. Nobody's got the right to deny a child their childhood.|Thyssa Shineboot}}

==Description==
Thyssa was a [[hin]] woman of middle age. She had a pale complexion splattered with freckles. Thyssa had blue eyes and hid her hair under a cloth fillet.

==History==
Thyssa Shineboot grew up in the city of Baldur's Gate. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Thyssa found herself among those Baldurians in a crowd who witnessed [[Bastian d'Zinn]], a man of means, accosting the child named [[Rhaneld]] for accidentally hitting him with a rock while playing. Bastian believed that a child playing on a street was a sign of the city's crime-ridden downward spiral. Thyssa expressed how opinion that a child playing is just that â€“ a child playing like she herself did on the very same streets as a kid and that Bastian lived a charmed life if a child were his greatest worry.
