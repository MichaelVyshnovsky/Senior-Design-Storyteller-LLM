        "mainbody": "Nottle was an industrious halfling scavenger, thief, and a merchant who was stationed in the ruins of Myth Drannor in 1369 DR.\nNottles main priority was gold. Even though he did not hesitate to aid adventurers when needed, he considered it to be an investment as the same adventurers were his current customers and potential customers.\nHe prided himself on his thieving skills and usually marked looted chests and treasure troves with one single carved letter \"N\".\nNote was highly proficient at disarming and  detecting traps, the skill he fully used during his time in the ruins of Myth Drannor. He easily deactivated even the most dangerous trapped chests. One such chest was armed with a fireball trap, a poison needle, and an acid splash trap.\nNottles varied inventory was held within his caravan wagon, which was Nottles home, business venue, and shelter. The wagon was enchanted with a plethora of defensive spells that kept the halfling and his stock safe, even in the most dangerous of situations.\nthumb|220x220px|Nottles enchanted wagon.\nIn 1369 DR, Nottle heard about the Cult of the Dragons nefarious plan to take over the ruins of Myth Drannor and he knew that meant profit. He correctly anticipated adventurers arriving to stop the cult and he was there to sell them supplies and buy whatever ancient magical trinkets they recovered.\nThe halflings magically enchanted wagon kept him safe from cultists, undead, and orcs prowling the area. On occasion, he snuck into the ruins to scavenge, using his thieving skills. On one of those expeditions, Nottle was captured by the Cult and needed rescuing. Thankfully, the adventurers from Phlan,  the Veiled Ones, often came to his aid."
