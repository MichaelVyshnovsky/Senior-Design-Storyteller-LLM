        "mainbody": "'''Nottle''' was an industrious [[halfling]] scavenger, [[thief]], and a merchant who was stationed in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1369 DR]].\n{{quote|''I've got my wits to live on, and my wagonâ€”it's got so many blasted spells on it, I'm amazed it don't just burst into flames someday.''|Nottle}}",
        "Personality": "Nottle's main priority was gold. Even though he did not hesitate to aid adventurers when needed, he considered it to be an investment as the same adventurers were his current customers and potential customers.\n\nHe prided himself on his thieving skills and usually marked looted chests and treasure troves with one single carved letter \"N\".",
        "Abilities": "Note was highly proficient at disarming and  detecting traps, the skill he fully used during his time in the ruins of Myth Drannor. He easily deactivated even the most dangerous trapped chests. One such chest was armed with a ''[[fireball]]'' trap, a ''[[poison]]'' needle, and an ''[[acid splash]]'' trap.",
        "Possessions": "Nottle's varied inventory was held within his caravan wagon, which was Nottle's home, business venue, and shelter. The wagon was enchanted with a plethora of defensive spells that kept the halfling and his stock safe, even in the most dangerous of situations.\n[[File:Nottle's wagon.jpg|thumb|220x220px|''Nottle's enchanted wagon.'']]",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], Nottle heard about the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s nefarious plan to take over the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] and he knew that meant profit. He correctly anticipated adventurers arriving to stop the cult and he was there to sell them supplies and buy whatever ancient magical trinkets they recovered.\n\nThe halfling's magically enchanted wagon kept him safe from cultists, undead, and [[orc]]s prowling the area. On occasion, he snuck into the ruins to scavenge, using his thieving skills. On one of those expeditions, Nottle was captured by the Cult and needed rescuing. Thankfully, the adventurers from [[Phlan]],  the [[Veiled Ones]], often came to his aid."
