__NOTOC__
==Description==
A former warrior, tall and strong, but some of his muscle had turned to fat.
==Personality==
Haundrae was a great bear of a man, moving slowly and deliberately, with a stern demeanor. He loved cheese and kept the pantry full of as many different varieties as he could get from traders that did business in Voonlar.
==Abilities==
He was still quite strong and very good with a [[throwing axe]]. He brewed a heavy, dark ale from nuts that was popular with some guests.
==Relationships==
The Three Elves was a very popular inn throughout the Moonsea region and its owner/operators were highly regarded.
