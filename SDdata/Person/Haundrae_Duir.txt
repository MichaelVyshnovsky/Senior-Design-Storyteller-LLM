Haundrae Duir was part-owner, cook, brewer, and host at the Three Elves inn in Voonlar circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
__NOTOC__
A former warrior, tall and strong, but some of his muscle had turned to fat.
Haundrae was a great bear of a man, moving slowly and deliberately, with a stern demeanor. He loved cheese and kept the pantry full of as many different varieties as he could get from traders that did business in Voonlar.
He was still quite strong and very good with a throwing axe. He brewed a heavy, dark ale from nuts that was popular with some guests.
The Three Elves was a very popular inn throughout the Moonsea region and its owner/operators were highly regarded.
