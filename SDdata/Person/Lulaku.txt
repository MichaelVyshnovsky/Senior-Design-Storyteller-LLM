Lulaku was a hunting spider katanga who served the Mother of a Thousand Young within the Fire Mountain of the Malatran Plateau in the late 14 century DR.
Lulaku was a spider katanga who wielded daggers in combat.
When faced to battle, Lulaku promptly tried to have her daggers enchanted by Fusamu, a spider katanga sorceress. When faced with overwhelming odds, Lulaku was likely to try and escape with her life.
Lulaku was armed with bone daggers, a longspear, but her venomous bite was the katangas most dangerous weapon.
In the late 14 century DR, the Tribe of the Wise Ones became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded spider katanga, the Mother of a Thousand Young, was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Lulaku was posted to guard a stockade of captured heroes of the Living Jungle, enemies of the Mother of a Thousand Young. She was accompanied by Turanu and Fusamu. The spider katanga were guarding several Nubari humans and lizardfolk. Lulaku was loyal to Talunuku, a spider katanga who was secretly responsible for the poison and sought to become the new Mother of a Thousand Young.
Lulakus fate was unknown however, she and other guards were faced with heroes of the Living Jungle that were sent to rescue the prisoners and stop the Mother of a Thousand Young, likely resulting in her death.
