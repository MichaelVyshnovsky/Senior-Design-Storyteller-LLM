'''Great Gark''' was a king among the [[goblin]]s of [[Nachtur]] in the [[Feywild]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|4}}

==Activities==
Gark attempted to expand his kingdom into the [[Moonshae Isles]] by sending goblins, [[worg]]s and other creatures to the [[Dernall Forest]] in [[Callidyrr]]. This was initially a small nuisance for the scattered villages found within the forest, but Gark's minions later infested the entire wood.
