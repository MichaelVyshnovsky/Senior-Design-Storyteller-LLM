'''Cryonax''' ({{Pronounce|KRY|o|naks|refs=<ref>{{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}|audio=Cryonax.ogg}}) was the Prince of evil cold-using creatures, and one of the inhabitants of the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Ice]].{{cite book/Heroes of the Elemental Chaos|26}}

==Description==
He somewhat resembled a yeti with two tentacles in place of each arm. He stood {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed {{SI|2800|lb|k|long=yes}}. He radiated an aura of terrible cold, said to chill both the body and soul of those around him.{{Cite dragon/347/Princes of Elemental Evil|32}}

==Domain==
Within his plane Cryonax resided in the [[Chiseled Estate]], a massive ornate fortress constructed of ice, rock crystal, and glass that rose {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} above the surface. It was claimed to be the coldest region in his entire plane, though in reality its frigid temperatures were surpassed by the [[Mountain of Ultimate Winter]].{{Cite dragon/347/Princes of Elemental Evil|32}}

==Activities==
Cryonax's primary goal was to raise the influence of his domain so that it could one day become a fifth base elemental plane; thus, he constantly sought out territory among the [[elemental planes]] to conquer, though Cryonax was a careful schemer and he had much grander ambitions, plotting to one day surpass and usurp the other elemental forces of the [[Inner planes]], and beyond that, strove to one day freeze the entire [[multiverse]].

He also sought to unleash the [[Archdevil]] [[Levistus]], but for what reason was unknown.

==Relationships==
Unlike the other Evil Archomentals, there was neither a ruler of an opposing elemental force nor Good Archomental counterpart actively competing against his interests. The closest thing to the former was [[Chilimba]], but Cryonax did not consider them a credible threat.

On his own plane Cryonax was opposed by the Great White Wyrm, [[Albrathanilar]], a potent and cunning wizard. The local [[immoth]]s and some [[Ice mephit]]s also opposed Cryonax's rule, mainly through living in isolation, though the latter had been known to aid his enemies.

His army consisted of [[ice archon]]s,{{cite book/Heroes of the Elemental Chaos|25}} [[frost giant]]s, [[ice crab]]s, ice mephits, [[ice para-elemental]]s, [[ice toad]]s, [[white dragon]]s, [[white pudding]]s, [[winter wolves]], and [[druid]]s who specialized in cold-based magic.

==Rumors & Legends==
One legend claimed that Cryonax was a [[primordial]] who was once a [[demon lord]] who had tried and failed to conquer the [[Elemental Chaos]]. 

A [[djinni]] in service of a [[pasha]] from [[Calimshan]] believed that the ''[[Ring of Winter]]'' had the power to summon Cryonax.

Legend holds that back during the [[Dawn War]], in a battle on a now-forgotten mountain top, Cryonax shattered his teeth upon the armor of the dwarven god [[Moradin]] and that jagged [[primordial shard]]s of this could still be found today.{{cite book/Heroes of the Elemental Chaos|156}}

More recent rumors claimed that within the Chiseled Estate lived a coven of enslaved [[planetouched]] [[wizard]]s and [[priest]]s, many of them either [[ice genasi]] or [[water genasi]], who worked tirelessly to develop new forms of ice-based monsters for Cryonax's army.
