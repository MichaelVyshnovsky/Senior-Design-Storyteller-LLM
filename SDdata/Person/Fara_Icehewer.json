        "mainbody": "Fara Icehewer was a ranger of the Sky Pony tribe of Uthgardt barbarians that lived in a camp in the Nether Mountains circa 1372 DR. This band snubbed the traditions of the Uthgardt and acted as plundering bandits under the leadership of Wolmad Eaglewing.\nDespite her identity with the tribe, Fara led a faction within the Sky Ponies that opposed the needless violence and greed."
