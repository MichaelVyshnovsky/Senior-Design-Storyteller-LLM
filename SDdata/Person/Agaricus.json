        "mainbody": "Agaricus was one of the myconid rulers in Sporedome in the late 15 century DR.\nCirca 1486 DR, many myconid sprouts disappeared from Agaricuss colony and from many others. He believed the Sacred Seer, a mutated myconid follower of the demon lord Zuggtmoy, to be responsible. At last, Agaricus and his fellows managed to capture the Sacred Seer and were on the verge of putting her to death.\nHowever, an adventuring party arrived in search of the fabled braincap mushroom. They offered to save the missing sprouts in exchange for help from the Sacred Seer to find the braincap. After pondering the offer, Agaricus decided to accept the help of the adventurers.\nLater, Agaricus joined in the planning of the assault on Maerimydra.\nAgaricus was a noble and venerable creature. He did not much like the drow of Szith Morcane but could tolerate them."
