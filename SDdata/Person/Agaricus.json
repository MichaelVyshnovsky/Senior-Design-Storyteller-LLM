        "History": "''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], many myconid sprouts disappeared from Agaricus's colony and from many others. He believed the [[Sacred Seer]], a mutated [[myconid]] follower of the [[demon lord]] [[Zuggtmoy]], to be responsible. At last, Agaricus and his fellows managed to capture the Sacred Seer and were on the verge of putting her to death.\n\nHowever, an adventuring party arrived in search of the fabled [[braincap]] mushroom. They offered to save the missing sprouts in exchange for help from the Sacred Seer to find the braincap. After pondering the offer, Agaricus decided to accept the help of the adventurers.\n\nLater, Agaricus joined in the planning of the assault on [[Maerimydra]].{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|11}}",
        "Personality": "Agaricus was a noble and venerable creature. He did not much like the [[drow]] of [[Szith Morcane]] but could tolerate them."
