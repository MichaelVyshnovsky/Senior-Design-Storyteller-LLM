During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] in the 1480s DR, a group of [[Purple Dragons]] were attacked by beasts in the [[King's Forest]]. They returned to the [[Eveningstar War Hospital]], only for it to transpire that at least one of them was infected with [[lycanthropy]]. One night, the head priest of the hospital [[Hurim Jaskyr]] was brutally murdered and torn to pieces, to the shock and horror of the patients and staff. Healer [[Delethir Mistveil]] accepted the aid of [[adventurer]]s and bid them investigate, only for nightfall to reveal the presence of multiple werewolves within the hospital. After a running battle, the surviving patients were able to open the front doors and escape the bloodbath, only for Ogiyon Tomain and his wolfy companions to charge in and seek vengeance for their lost kin. Though fearsome, Ogiyon did not survive the battle.
