Palron Kaeth was a vampire and the leader of the Prefects around the 5 to 7 centuries DR.
Palron Kaeth was bald with black sigil tattoos adorning his cheek and neck. He possessed a heavy black leather cloak that protected him from the sunlight.
Kaeth was able to speak the incredibly complicated phaerimm language.
Kaeth sought to destroy the Sharnwall and free the phaerimm, and he believed the blood of Khelben Arunsun and his father Arun Maerdrym would allow him to succeed at the task.
Kaeth was the one responsible for the death of Khelbens mother, Arielimnda. 
In the , in the Sword of Anauroch, Palron Kaeth and the phaerimm fought against Arun and his son Khelben. When they ran out of spells and realized that they had no other options, the two men agreed to sacrifice themselves to stop Palron. Arun struck Khelbens Duskstaff of Sarael with his Lupinaxe, causing an explosion that killed both him and Khelben and turned the surrounding sand to glass.
