'''Jukini''' was the daughter of the [[Reghedmen]] [[barbarian]] prince [[Kinnuki]] and his Liskanite lover [[Mathilda]] who died ''circa'' [[1269 DR]] after surviving the [[Great Thaw]] in [[Icewind Dale]].

==History==
Jukini's father, Kinnuki fell in love with the wife of an evil necromancer from [[Luskan]] who came to [[Icewind Dale]] to search for eternal life away from the prying eyes of other mages of the Arcane Brotherhood. Kinnuki and Mathilda ran away from the evil wizard and eventually had Jukini while living with the barbarian prince's tribe. The necromancer, [[Damien Morienus]] summoned demons to hunt them down, and eventually, the lower planes creatures caused the even called the Great Thaw ''circa'' 1269 DR. Almost all of the tribe, along with Mathilda, perished when the ice cracked under their feet. Jukini survived the arctic waters but died a few days later of bad fever.
