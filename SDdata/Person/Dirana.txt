'''Dirana''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]] at the [[Fane of the Eye]] under [[Tyar-Besil]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Dirana lived at the [[Temple of the Crushing Wave]] in [[Tyar-Besil]]. However, she was captured in a skirmish by the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]] and put in a jail in the Fane's Eternal Flame section until some adventurers infiltrated the fane and defeated the earth cultists and found her.
