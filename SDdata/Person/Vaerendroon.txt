Vaerendroon was a skilled wizard and sage of magical lore who lived during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He was known to trade magic for specific spell that he was eager to possess. He often dealt with apprentices of other powerful mages in order to gain access to unique spells. Vaerendroon compiled his collected knowledge within a tome called Vaerendroons Ineffable Enchantments and sold the volume for 90,000 gp in Baldurs Gate when he needed coin badly.
