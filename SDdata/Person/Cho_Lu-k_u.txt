'''Cho Lu-k'u''' was a [[wizard]] who once lived in [[Koryo]].

Cho Lu-k'u died in the [[Dang Caverns]] and cursed its tunnels. This may have led to the evil monsters that lurked there.{{speculation}}<ref group="note">The text states only that Cho Lu-k'u cursed the tunnel ''and'' it harbors monsters. There is no direct cause-and-effect relation between these statements, but their proximity implies a connection. It also refers only to a single tunnel, but also mentions hundreds of entrances, so this is assumed to be in error and that there are multiple tunnels.

[[Meo Cha]] heard of this story from his old tutor some time before [[1350 DR]].
