'''Aasim''' was a [[cleric]] who dedicated himself to the dogma of the [[Iron Throne]] leader and [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Sarevok]] during the midâˆ’14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Template:Cite game/Baldur's Gate}}

==Activities==
Unbeknownst to the Iron Throne, Aasim and his companions [[Gardush]], [[Naaman]], [[Diyab]], [[Alai]], along with their leader [[Zhalimar Cloudwulfe]], sought to advance Sarevok's agenda rather than that of the mercantile organization.

==Possessions==
Aasim wore a suit of ''+1 [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[studded leather]] armor'' and a ''+1 [[mace]]''. He also possessed a single ''[[wand of the heavens]]''.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, Aasim and his allies were sent by the Iron Throne to the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] to advise [[Thaldorn]] in his negotiations with [[Tar (emissary)|Emissary Tar]] and the city's [[Council of Four]]. Just prior to when that meeting was supposed to take place, the group was thwarted by Sarevok's half-brother, [[Abdel Adrian]].
