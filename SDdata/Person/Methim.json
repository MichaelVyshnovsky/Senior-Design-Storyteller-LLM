Only the half-celestials influence could stop the Beast of Malar from rending their opponents on sight.\nLike other Beasts of Malar, Methim was a shapechanger able to switch between the hunting panther, claw slayer, and bat forms. The creature was resistant to non-magical damage and immune to fear. Methim was also gifted with true seeing and regeneration.\nMethim was Alaffinels loyal companion, traveling across the planes with him.\nMethim accompanied Alaffinel who fled justice of his kin across the planes after an unrevealed crime that disgraced him and the one he refused to atone for. Circa 1370 DR, Alaffinels shelter was discovered by the group of adventurers investigating unrest in Daggerford. He confronted the unwanted guests, suspecting them being sent to capture or kill the half-celestial.
