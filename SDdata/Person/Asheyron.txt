'''Asheyron the Learned''' was a sage and the owner of the [[Elfskull Inn]] in [[Arabel]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Activities==
Asheyron possessed a wealth of knowledge about monsters, particularly [[gorgon]]s. He would perform lectures detailing the faiths that the different monster races followed and rituals they used during worship.

In a vain attempt to capitalize on his uncle's will, Asheyron briefly adopted his brother [[Asgetrion]]'s name. The gems that he hoped to get his hands on from the will were never found, so Asheyron switched back to his own name.

==Possessions==
Asheyron wore an ''[[amulet of protection from petrification]]''.

==Rumors and Legends==
He was rumored to be immune to a gorgon's breath weapon because of his many unscathed exposures to the attack.
