        "mainbody": "'''Tojo Marushima''' was a restaurateur who ran the well-known [[Tojo's]] restaurant in the town of [[Aru]] in [[Wa]] in the 1770s on the [[Wa Calendar]].",
        "Relations": "His brother [[Aki Marushima]] ran a competing restaurant, and the two were fierce rivals.",
        "History": "In {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, Tojo declared his restaurant to be the best in Aru, but so did Aki. To settle the question, they each might've offered a group of adventurers a free meal, one night after the other, so they could serve as impartial judges. However, Tojo would pay a person to slip a mild purgative into their food when they dined at [[Aki's]], which would cause them gastrointestinal problems during their adventures."
