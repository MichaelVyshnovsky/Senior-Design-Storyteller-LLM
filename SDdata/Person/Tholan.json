        "mainbody": "'''Tholan the Beautiful''' was a [[ranger]] who once paramour a coven of witches but later earned their scorn by marrying another.",
        "History": "Sometime before [[1372 DR]], Tholan the Beautiful found himself a lover of a witch coven known as ''[[Newt's Brood]]''. Being a ranger with endless wanderlust, he often traveled far away from his lovers and stayed away for long periods of time. To keep an eye on him, the ''Newt's Brood'' created a suit of [[enchanted]] [[chainmail]] for the man, the ''[[Zeal's Walk]]''. Eventually, Tholan met another woman and, soon after, married her. To avoid his ex-lovers' retribution, Tholan disposed of the magic armor. The happy couple's final fate remained unknown."
