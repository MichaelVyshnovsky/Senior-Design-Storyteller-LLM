'''Mhegras''' of [[Esmeltaran]] was a [[Zhentarim]] priest of [[Bane]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was quite bitter about owing allegiance to the [[Zhentarim]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|155-158|10}}

==Relationships==
He bickered much with [[Sabran]] during their assignment to the capture of [[Shandril Shessair]],{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|218|13}} [[Hlael Toraunt]] and [[Korthauvar Hammantle]] counted him as all temper and bluster.

==Abilities==
He had a spell he counted as a "brainbore-worm", which burrowed into eyes and gnawed at brains. He believed it to be adequate for revenge on his would-be murderer, strongly implying it was painful.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|277-278|16}}

==Possessions==
Some of the cargo he concealed included horse barding.

==History==
Sabran joined the caravan from [[Scornubel]] to [[Waterdeep]] in which [[Shandril Shessair]] sought passage on late {{yearlink|1357}}. He presented himself as a weaver instead of a priest,{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|252-253|15}}

In the aftermath of the fight, they tried to capture Shandril while she was out of spellfire and knocked out, guarded only by [[Narm Tamaraith]], but decided against it when she woke up too soon. However, they were then ambushed by the [[Harpers]] [[Beldimarr]] and [[Arauntar]], who were posing as caravan guards, and got their necks broken.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|262-265|15}} This left them unseen to the [[Zhentarim]] scriers [[Hlael Toraunt]] and [[Korthauvar Hammantle]]. for much of a day.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|271|16}} Unknown to the Harpers, he survived thanks to a contingent spell.

He was slain during the caravan's next ambush; he attempted to capture Shandril but she reduced him to ashes using her [[spellfire]].
