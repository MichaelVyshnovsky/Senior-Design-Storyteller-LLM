'''Lhaerand''' was a mage in the [[Frostfire Banner]] adventuring party during the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
He could hurl fire.

==History==
Lhaerand was among the Frostfire Banner when they took on High Duke [[Horostos]]'s assignment to search for the reason why all animals larger than one's hand, as well as most people, were vanishing on the road between [[Starmantle]] and [[Ripplestones]].

On their first night on the road from Starmantle, they were ambushed by a chiming mist, [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]]. Lhaerand woke up when [[Paeregur]] called everyone awake; only he and [[Phostral]] were still alive at that point. Paeregur asked him to hurl fire at the phantom, but after seeing it disintegrate Phostral into nothing, Lhaerand instead ran all the way to the cliffside and jumped. Paeregur heard him hit the earth, presumably killed.
