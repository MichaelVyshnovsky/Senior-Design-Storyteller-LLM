        "mainbody": "General Anglin of Seventon was a Netherese arcanist and a respected general in the Seventon militia.\nAnglin was constantly worried about defending himself and the town of Seventon from attacks. This defensive focus reflected on the nature of the spells he invented.\nBesides being a very well respected general, Anglin also ran a spellcraft school called the Summoned Sorcerer. In exchange for his teachings, he only asked pupils to serve in the Seventon militia for at least five years.\nAnglin invented many of the prismatic spells, such as prismatic sphere, prismatic spray and prismatic wall, always from a defensive point of view. He was also credited with the magic mirror spell as a means to watch out for danger.\nHe was killed while researching for a new spell he would name Anglins gateway. The accident sucked him into a mystic portal."
