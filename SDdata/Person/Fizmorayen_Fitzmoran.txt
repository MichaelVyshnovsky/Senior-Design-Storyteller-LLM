Fizmorayen Fitzmoran was an exiled high artificer and a cleric of Gond in the 14 century DR. He lived in the fortress known as Throne Rock, protected by several glyphs of warding, on the island of Tuern.
Fitzmorayen kept several tons of valuable ore within his castle.
Living with Fizmorayen within his sanctuary were several dwarves, human tinkerers, and an alchemist.
Around 1370 DR, Fizmorayen was known to purchase adamantite ore and resell it to merchants from Waterdeep.
