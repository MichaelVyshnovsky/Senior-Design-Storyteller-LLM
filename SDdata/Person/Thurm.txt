Thurm was a brother of Basillus, the addled murderous cleric of Cyric who terrorized Beregost in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR.
Thurm, along with the rest of Basillus family were from Zhentil Keep of the Moonsea region. Sometime in or before 1368 DR, presumably during the Siege of Zhentil Keep, Basillus family, including brother Thurm, perished. The trauma left Basillus mad and led him to murder innocent townies and raising them as his undead "family".
