'''Thurm''' was a brother of [[Basillus]], the addled murderous [[cleric]] of [[Cyric]] who terrorized [[Beregost]] in the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]].

==History==
Thurm, along with the rest of Basillus' family were from [[Zhentil Keep]] of the [[Moonsea]] region. Sometime in or before 1368 DR, presumably during the [[Fall of Zhentil Keep|Siege of Zhentil Keep]], Basillus' family, including brother Thurm, perished. The trauma left Basillus mad and led him to murder innocent townies and raising them as his [[undead]] "family".
