'''Fetitia Ledora''' was a [[half-elven]] [[incantatrix]] who founded the [[Sorority of the Silver Fire]], alongside [[Yhelfanna the Masked]], in her quest for revenge against the [[Cult of the Dragon]].  

==History==
At some point ''circa'' [[975 DR]], a terrifying [[dracolich]] threatened the destruction of Fetitia's home, the city of [[Everlund]]. This urged the woman to locate the origin of such an abomination, an adventure that took her all the way to [[Sembia]], far to the southeast, where the Cult of the Dragon hid its temples.

Before she could fully put her plan into action, however, Fetitia found that she was not the only woman the Followers of the Scaly Way had upset; already, they were embroiled in a tense combat against Yhelfanna the Masked, a capable [[witch]] of [[Rashemen]]. Moving quickly to join her, the two became fast friends and, through their combined might, managed not only to foil a cell of Cultists but also end a pair of dracoliches that the Cult had hurriedly brought forth. Ultimately, the two women even destroyed a copy of the ''[[Tome of the Dragon]]'' that the Cult had been keeping there.

From there, in the {{YearlinkName|985}}, Fetitia and Yhelfanna decided to maintain their joint efforts. This union would go on to be known as the Sorority of the Silver Fire, a group that, like their founders, dedicated itself to the pursuit and elimination of [[Sammaster]]'s corruptive ''Tome'' and his terrible dracoliches.

==Rumors & Legends==
Certain rumors spoke of Fetitia's parentage as being none other than [[Alustriel Silverhand]].
