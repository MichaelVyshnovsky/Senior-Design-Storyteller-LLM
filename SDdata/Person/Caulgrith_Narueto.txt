Caulgrith Narueto was a dwarf warrior inhabiting the city of Suldolphor in the far eastern reaches of Calimshan in south Faer√ªn near the Land of the Lions.
Caulgrith possessed truly unusual breadth, being wider that he was tall. He had heavily muscled arms and calves.
Caulgirth was a skilled blacksmith and jeweler, specializing in fine detail work. He owned a shop located on Pelaerel Street.
The dwarf appeared to never require sleep, leading some to believe he had a twin brother who stood in for him when he rested.
