        "mainbody": "'''''Ayo Armbrust''''' was the son of [[Talli Armbrust|Talli]] and [[Tym Armbrust]], a down-on-his-luck tailor, from [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''Hello! Are you a tax collector? Papa told me I shouldn't talk to them if they showed up.''|Ayo Armbrust}}",
        "Description": "Ayo was a [[human]] boy who took on his father's appearance â€“ light skin, light brown hair, and dark brown eyes.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Ayo and Talli's wellbeing was threatened by Tym's debt to the notorious [[Guild]] of Baldur's Gate. When Tym was unable to pay, [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] implicitly threatened the tailor's family in a letter and notified him of collectors coming to collect the late fee. The family's struggle was noticeable to Talli's friends, [[Sabine (Baldur's Gate)|Sabine]] and [[Freddie]], who visited the Armbrusts. They offered to help the family out by taking in little Ayo to give  Talli and Tym some privacy and a way to relax. While at home, Ayo was instructed by his father not to talk to \"tax collectors\" where they were to show up."
