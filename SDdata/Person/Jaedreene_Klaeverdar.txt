'''Jaerdreene Klaeverdar''' was a previous matriarch of the [[Klaeverdar]] clan, whose tale of the protection of [[Oldturret Farm]] was still passed down the generations by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Legend==
It was said that she protected [[Oldturret Farm]] from "the evil ones out of [[Dragonspear]]", at the cost of her life, and that she'd transformed several of her family members into animals for their own protection during the raid. The raid also destroyed the tower that gave the farm its name. Furthermore, not all of her family members were restored to manshape afterwards.
