        "mainbody": "Hamun Kost was a Red Wizard of Thay of the late 15 century who specialized in necromancy.\nKost had pale, yellowing skin, and was rather plump. His sallow face was covered with a black, necromantic tattoo, and he wore a red robe.\nThe necromancer did not resort to aggression unless agreements could not be made.\nHamun Kost owned several pieces of silver, electrum, gold, and platinum, as well as a pearl. He also kept a scroll of darkness in a bone scroll case, and a ring of protection in a jeweled box.\nCirca 1491 DR, Kost traveled to Old Owl Well to seek out ancient Netherese magic and anything associated with it. He set up camp and his writing desk, and planned to stay here for some time. The necromancer set up camp and summoned twelve zombies to protect him during his search. He came across a Netherese ring of protection, and other items."
