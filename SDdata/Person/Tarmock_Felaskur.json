        "mainbody": "Tarmock Felaskur was the apothecary in Triboar in the late 15 century DR.\nTarmock sold medicines and remedies out of his apothecary shop. His goods were known to be largely ineffective, and so he made most of his money selling sweet water, a naturally sweet and carbonated water that bubbled up from a small spring concealed in the shed behind his house.\nTarmock supplied most of his sweet water to a local restaurant called The Pleasing Platter. This one business relationship was his primary source of sales."
