        "mainbody": "Crughth was an orc shaman inhabiting Omans Isle within the Moonshae Isles during the late 15 century DR.\nCrughth was well-respected among the giant rulers of the isle because of his divine and primal power. He planned to taint the moonwell found in the Old Stone Wood. If Crughths plan succeeded the giants of Omans Isle would be able to transport soldiers to any of the other moonwells scattered throughout the Moonshae Isles."
