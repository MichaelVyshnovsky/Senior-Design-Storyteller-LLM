        "mainbody": "Sirge Wintermelt was a scout and member of the Harpers in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.\nIn 1489 DR, Sirge followed rumors of the Cult of the Dragon gathering orcs from the Thar. In doing this, Sirge discovered the Claws of Tiamat bandit gang. He was captured by them and discovered that they were not Dragon Cultists, but only crazed zealots of Tiamat. Eventually, he was freed by an adventuring party hired to clear the Iron Route of outlaws.\nIn 1491 DR, he possibly resurfaced in Mulmaster during an investigation of a mine in te Earthspur Mountains. He said to the adventurers that Harpers wanted to free the local miners and that most political dissidents of the city knew important secrets."
