        "mainbody": "'''Sarafin''' was a roaming adventurer who traveled the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''You look like you need to clean off the road-dirt almost as much as I do. No good inns with hot water and a tub on this side of the Crossing though.''|Sarafin.}}",
        "Description": "Sarafin was a slender [[High elf]] woman with olive skin, short brown hair, and grey eyes. Her adventuring garb consisted of handsome light-colored cloth armor and simple leather pauldrons.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Sarafin was a member of an adventuring band that included the [[gnome]] [[Yonks]], the [[half-orc]] [[Zog]], and the [[tiefling]] [[Quinara]]. The group traveled the Sword Coast in search of steady adventuring work. They traveled from [[Waterdeep]] to [[Baldur's Gate]] during the [[Absolute crisis]] and, unable to find work, planned to move out to [[Neverwinter]] as the city was searching for adventures. During her stay in Baldur's Gate, Sarafin took a swim in the [[River Chionthar]] but emerged dirtier than before the plunge. The river was polluted at the time by [[Lord Gortash]]'s machinery."
