Myrcrest was a magical bird and servant of Vangerdahast, the Royal Magician of Cormyr, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Although resembling a raven, Myrcrest was much larger, being about 50% wider and longer in the wings than a regular specimen. Its feet were pale and fleshy and ended in  talons, and its eyes glowed or reflected greenish-yellow light. Stranger still, its feathers had no sheen, instead seeming dull and even absorbing light. It could be quite intimidating to those unused to it.
Myrcrest was intelligent, but could only communicate via raven-like squawking and head bobs.
Myrcrest delivered messages for Vangerdahast. These it carried in a thick leather pouch tied around its neck.
On the evening of Eleint 18 in the , Myrcrest carried a vital message from Vangerdahast concerning the fate of the killer of the kings envoy Grodoveth to retired War Wizard Benelaius at his cottage. He and Lindavar received it well, but Jasper was frightened of it.
