'''Alydar''' was an [[elf]] [[fighter]] and [[adventurer]] who was active in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Wedding Summons in Ravens Bluff|6}}

==Possessions==
Alydar dressed in very refined clothing.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, [[Vernon Condor]] conducted a census of adventurers in the city of Ravens Bluff, which was later publicized in an issue of the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' [[broadsheet]]. Within that census Alydar was included in a list of the city's most skilled active adventurers.{{Cite polyhedron/96/The Ravens Bluff Trumpeter}}

Sometime later, a group of [[adventurer]]s were hired by [[Davy Jones]] to hunt down a [[mammoth]] and stopped by [[Flirin's Sushi Bar]]. There they found both Alydar and [[Charles Oliver O'Kane]] waiting in line for the restaurant.
