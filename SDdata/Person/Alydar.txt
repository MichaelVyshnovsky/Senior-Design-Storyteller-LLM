Alydar was an elf fighter and adventurer who was active in the city of Ravens Bluff in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Alydar dressed in very refined clothing.
In the late 14 century DR, Vernon Condor conducted a census of adventurers in the city of Ravens Bluff, which was later publicized in an issue of the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter broadsheet. Within that census Alydar was included in a list of the citys most skilled active adventurers.
Sometime later, a group of adventurers were hired by Davy Jones to hunt down a mammoth and stopped by Flirins Sushi Bar. There they found both Alydar and Charles Oliver OKane waiting in line for the restaurant.
