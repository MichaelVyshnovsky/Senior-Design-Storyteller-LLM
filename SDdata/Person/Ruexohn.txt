'''Ruexohn''' was an [[incubus]] agent of the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]] in [[Hillsfar]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Hillsfar Reclaimed|5,9}}{{Cite adventurers league/Death on the Wall|25}}

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Ruexohn killed and replaced [[Davon Malaeda]], the closest advisor of First Lord [[Torin Nomerthal]]. Using his new identity, Ruexohn influenced the First Lord's decisions. He also introduced Nomerthal to his "twin sister" [[Thessaly Malaeda]], just arrived in the cityâ€”a [[succubus]] and fellow agent of Graz'zt.

Thessaly seduced Nomerthal and Ruexohn convinced him that he needed to marry her. So the First Lord organized the [[Midsummer Masquerade]] ball in order to announce his marriage to all the wealthiest citizens of Hillsfar.{{Cite adventurers league/Hillsfar Reclaimed|18-19}} 

However, Ruexohn was quickly replaced by another incubus also posing as Davon.{{Cite adventurers league/Death on the Wall|17}}
