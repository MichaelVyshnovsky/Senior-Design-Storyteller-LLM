        "mainbody": "Rsolk was the leader of the Dead Rats branch in Neverwinter in the late years of the 15 century DR.\nRsolk was a one-eyed wererat. He attributed the loss of his eye to a fight with Toytere.\nAt some point before 1479 DR, Rsolk was sent to Neverwinter by Toytere, with the goal of expanding the Dead Rats reach to Neverwinter. After the death of Cymril, the Dead Rats joined forces with the Nashers to depose Dagult Neverember. However, Rsolks true objective was to eliminate the Nashers, whom he saw as rivals to the Dead Rats, and to establish a permanent alliance with Thay."
