        "mainbody": "'''Rsolk''' was the leader of the [[Dead Rats]] branch in [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Rsolk was a one-eyed [[wererat]]. He attributed the loss of his eye to a fight with [[Toytere]].",
        "History": "At some point before [[1479 DR]], Rsolk was sent to Neverwinter by Toytere, with the goal of expanding the Dead Rats' reach to Neverwinter. After the death of [[Cymril]], the Dead Rats joined forces with the [[Sons of Alagondar#The Nashers|Nashers]] to depose [[Dagult Neverember]]. However, Rsolk's true objective was to eliminate the Nashers, whom he saw as rivals to the Dead Rats, and to establish a permanent alliance with [[Thay]]."
