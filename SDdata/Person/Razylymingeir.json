Since the adventure is said to take place mid-summer (p. 58), it is fairly clear the adventure is set in {{Yearlink|1369}}. The adventure contains a dating error, claiming Steelheart's parents fought in the [[Bloodstone Wars]] in {{Yearlink|1347}}, prior to her being hatched. At the same time, Steelheart is stated to be 27 years old. This would date the adventure to {{Yearlink|1374}}, which in turn would render a lot of the references to current events anachronistic, such as the repeated references to the [[Zhentarim]]'s allegiance to [[Cyric]]&mdash;the Cyricist faction was purged in {{Yearlink|1370}} (''[[Cloak & Dagger]]'', p. 16). This wiki chalks this discrepancy up to a mistake by the author.",

        "mainbody": "'''Razylymingeir''', better known as '''Steelheart''', was a female [[steel dragon]] active in [[Vaasa]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She spent much of her time in the form of a [[human]], and used the name '''Katelyn Brekstel'''.",
        "Description": "In her true form, Razylymingeir had grayish-blue scales.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|54}} In her human form, she adopted the appearance of a conventionally attractive human girl with blonde hair, light grey eyes, tan skin, and a few small moles on her jaw. When she was a [[dragon aging|juvenile]], this human form was about {{SI|5|feet|c|long=yes}} tall and appeared to be a teenager of 12–14 years old.",
        "Personality": "Razylymingeir was brave{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|68}} and prone to emotion, likely to burst into tears when sad{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|61}} and to seek furious revenge when aggrieved.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|56}}\n\nShe was fascinated by humans{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|59}} If these companions deduced her true nature, she was polite and apologetic as she attempted to explain her actions.\n{{Quote|''Come on, you're heroes, aren't you? You're not going to let a few [[orc]]s get in our way, are you?''|Razylymingeir, as Katelyn Brekstel}}",
        "Abilities": "As a steel dragon, Razylymingeir could breathe a cloud of [[poison]] gas. She could also freely ''[[polymorph]]'' herself, and preferred the forms of small animals&mdash;such as [[mice]], [[cat]]s, [[bird]]s, or [[snake]]s&mdash;in order to move about undetected. She was also known to adopt other forms during battle&mdash;such as a [[tiger]]&mdash;depending on the situation or space constraints.",
        "Activities": "Razylymingeir lived in the town of [[Darmshall]], from where she kept a watchful eye on the evil of [[Castle Perilous]]. She kept her nature as a dragon hidden, and lived outwardly as \"Katelyn Brekstel\".",
        "Relationships": "Razylymingeir opposed the [[Cult of the Dragon]].\n\nHer parents were the steel dragons [[Forge (steel dragon)|Forge]] and [[Glimmerfang]]. Prior to their deaths, the three dragons lived together in human form in Darmshall, where Forge held the identity \"Jarl Brekstel\" and served as the town blacksmith while Glimmerfang held the identity \"Ingrid Brekstel\".\n{{Quote|''Friends, what my mom and dad said is true. The bravery of humankind is beyond measure.''|Razylymingeir}}",
        "History": "Razylymingeir was hatched ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1342}}, and that she was never to assume her true form in front of a humanoid except in an absolute emergency. The family of steel dragons thus outwardly lived in Darmshall as if Razylymingeir was the ordinary daughter of an ordinary blacksmith and his wife. \n\nBoth of Razylymingeir's parents worked as spies against [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] following his aggression toward Vaasa and [[Damara]] in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}. They helped to oppose the Witch-King in the [[Bloodstone Wars]], and even after his defeat, the pair continued to keep an eye on his ruined citadel at Castle Perilous, especially as evil [[chromatic dragon]]s began nesting in the ruins.\n\nIn the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1369}},&mdash;her parents attracted the ire of the Cult of the Dragon when they tricked a member into revealing the Cult's plans for an alliance with the [[Zhentarim]] and an invasion of [[Thar]].&mdash;and a [[white dragon]]&mdash;[[Frostnax]]. Razylymingeir escaped by ''polymorphing'' into a mouse, but both of her parents were killed after managing to slay Frostnax and wound Flameshoot. The sight of her badly wounded father and of a red dragon's maw around her mother's neck was the last time she saw her parents alive.\n\nOn the verge of despair, Razylymingeir recalled her parents' words about the bravery of humans, and set out to recruit [[adventurer]]s to help her take revenge on the dragons who slew her parents.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|70}}{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|71}} With these events behind her, Razylymingeir returned to Darmshall to honor her parents' calling of keeping watch on Castle Perilous.\n\nAs of the the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a year after the events of [[Sammaster's Rage]]&mdash;in which the Cult of the Dragon used the ''[[Dracorage mythal]]'' to wreck havoc across [[Faerûn]] and in the [[Cold Lands]] especially&mdash;Razylymingeir continued to keep a wary eye on Castle Perilous."
