        "mainbody": "Huldyl Rauthur was a wizard and a member of the War Wizards of Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nShort and stout, Huldyls face was often sweaty. He had eyes the color of amber and a large mustache that partially obscured his mouth. He tended to wear many rings.\nHuldyl lacked assertiveness and sometimes misjudged social situations and Court maneuverings. He seemed to be seeking a purpose for which he was suited to handle. He studied the Art diligently and took pride in perfecting small, useful spells.\nHuldyl worked directly for the Royal Magician Vangerdahast doing odd jobs and carrying things when needed. He traveled extensively in southern Cormyr performing official functions and was also seen stalking the halls of the Royal Court ferrying messages between important people.\nHe was on good terms with the Mage Royal and often tried to please him by giving him spells that he had developed. He was great friends with Kurthryn Shandarn, another war wizard and drinking buddy.\nHe lived in the War Wizard apartments above the Horngate (the eastern gate into Suzail). After the events of the Abraxus Conspiracy, he laid low and tried to stay out of the outrage and intrigue that swirled around the Royal Court. He mainly spent his time excessively drinking is favorite ale and playing chess with Kurthryn."
