Gundul Hulvesper was a breeder of horses in the village of Maskyrs Eye in the Vast in the midâ€“14 century DR.
His youngest son was Torzhin Hulvesper, an acolyte of Chauntea at the House of Plenty.
He had a stocky build and a hooked nose.
His humor was broad and he was known for driving a hard bargain.
He dwelled at Hulvesper Farm. It was found just south of the bluff on which Maskyrs Tower once stood, which itself was roughly due south of the village center and on the west of the road.
One of the most well-respected horse breeders of Maskyrs Eye, he produced the popular blackhair breed of equine.
