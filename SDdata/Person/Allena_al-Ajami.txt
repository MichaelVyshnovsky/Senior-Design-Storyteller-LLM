'''Allena al-Ajami''' was a foreign [[ajami]] and the Chief Vizier to the Caliph of the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free City]] of [[Utaqa]] in [[north Zakhara]] in {{Yearlink|1367}}.{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Given that she was a "foreign barbarian" herself, Allena usually dealt with situations in Utaqa related to foreigners. Most importantly, she was responsible for paying Utaqa's massive [[mercenary barbarian]] force.

==History==
Allena fled to [[Zakhara]] to put some distance between herself and powerful enemies.
