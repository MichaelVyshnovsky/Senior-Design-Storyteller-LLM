Pell was a boy who worked for Gustaf Stellern as a stablehand in his hunting lodge in Neverwinter Wood during the late 15 century DR.
Pell was a mute boy who was twelve years old in 1492 DR. He lived in a simply furnished bedroom on the upper level of the stable house.
Following the appearance of the white dragon Cryovain in the region, an alliance of orcs from the south and a half-orc cult of Talos formed in Neverwinter Wood and attacked the hunting lodge in which Pell lived. The anchorites of Talos also conjured Gorthok the Thunder Boar to aid the attack.
