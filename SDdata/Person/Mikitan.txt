'''Mikitan''' was a successful businessman inhabiting the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Mikitan owned the [[Mikitan Shipyards]] located in southeast Daggerford near the [[Delimbiyr River]]. The proximity of Mikitan's business to the river compared to that of his land-locked rival [[Dekoran]] helped make Mikitan a very wealthy and influential person in Daggerford.
