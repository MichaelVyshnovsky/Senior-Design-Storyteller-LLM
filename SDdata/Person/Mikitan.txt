Mikitan was a successful businessman inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Mikitan owned the Mikitan Shipyards located in southeast Daggerford near the Delimbiyr River. The proximity of Mikitans business to the river compared to that of his land-locked rival Dekoran helped make Mikitan a very wealthy and influential person in Daggerford.
