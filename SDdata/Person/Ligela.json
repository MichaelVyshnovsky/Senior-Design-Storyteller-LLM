        "mainbody": "Ligela was a fickle and vain earth spirit who dwelt on the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur and was a patron of a small saru village in the late 14 century DR.\nLigela took on a form of an earth woman or an earth child. She walked about the saru unseen, and where she stepped, death followed.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the Year of Discovery on the Malatran Calendar, Ligela became angered with a saru village after a saru child broke tabu by falling on a patch of sacred flowers. She could not tolerate such disrespect and started reclaiming nourishment she gifted them through land, jungle, and beast.\nSpirits showed a vision of the wasting curse to Bengoukee, the shaman of Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba, telling him that only a certain group of the heroes of the Living Jungle would be allowed to aid the saru.\nWhen the adventurers reached the village, they were greeted with the sight and scent of death. The homes were turned to tombs, and surviving saru were wasting away, consumed by painful convulsions, including Brunga, the child responsible for the spirits rage. They learned that the saru were cursed a month prior. First, Ligela deprived the saru of food. Then she rotted any fruit gathered and stored in the village. Saru grew weaker and started perishing, unable to eat or drink. No healing magics was effective in removing the affliction.\nThe saru shaman Magilla used the last of his waning strength to build a special totem to appease the spirits rage. And the heroes of the Living Jungle were tasked with aiding him. They were sent to retrieve special green river stones and giant bee wax."
