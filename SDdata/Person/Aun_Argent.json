        "mainbody": "'''Aun Argent''' was a devout follower of [[Lathander]] that served within the [[Order of the Aster]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Aun Argent was a dutiful man who held the safety and concern of others in high regard.",
        "Relationships": "He had a niece named [[Caelar Argent|Caelar]], of whom he was quite protective.",
        "History": "As a young girl living in an Order of the Aster monastery, Caelar bristled at the discipline forced upon her by her elders. Seeking more power, she snuck into the order's library and read aloud from the ''[[Tome of the Nine]]''. In doing so she inadvertently opened a ''[[gate]]'' to [[Avernus]] and forfeited her soul to the [[fiend]] [[Belhifet]]. Aun Argent interceded and offered his own soul in place of that of Caelar, freeing the young girl from hellish bondage.\n\nAun's soul languished in the [[Nine Hells]] for some time, until an adult Caelar Argent led a crusade across the [[Sword Coast]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, in a misguided attempt to free it. Unfortunately, Caelar was betrayed by her \"spiritual advisor\" [[Hephernaan]], who was in truth a servant of Belhifet. Eventually, Caelar and a handful of her crusaders, closely followed by the [[Hero of Baldur's Gate]] and his adventuring party, traveled through the [[Dragonspear Castle|Dragonspear]] ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Basalt Tower]] in Avernus.\n\nAlthough the exact events that played out were unknown, Belhifet was slain in the Nine Hells and Aun Argent body and soul were freed from imprisonment. Aun Argent was severely disappointed in the actions of his niece."
