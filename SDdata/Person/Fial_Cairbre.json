        "mainbody": "Fial Cairbre was a human proxy and alleged son of the Celtic and Faer√ªnian power known as Oghma.\nFial was a very eloquent and persuasive speaker.\nHis skills in barding with a harp were quite exceptional, able to quiet anyone who heard them. He was even capable of raising the dead and killing the living through use of his barding skills.\nFial spent much of his time wandering across the planes, though he occasionally visited the Prime Material world of Toril.\nArawn felt no ill will towards the deaths and resurrections that Fial performed, as the man made sure to keep the balance of such things equal."
