        "mainbody": "Lassratha Nalorth was the High Rider, or commander, of the Yevven Riders in Yeshpek along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nLassrathas bloodthirsty nature was matched by her menacing  frame. She had raven-black hair and was rumored to sleep in her armor.\nShe dreamt of leading Yeshpeks forces in victory over Suldolphor and even Calimshan, making her city truly free. She realized this was likely an unobtainable fantasy, but kept her troops in top fighting shape regardless."
