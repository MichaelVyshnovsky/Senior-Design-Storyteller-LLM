        "mainbody": "'''Nas'Sirin''' was the advisor and investors relationship manager of [[Sa'Sani]]'s [[Mercantile House]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''That statement presumes I am employed by her, or that I remain here at her behest. That assumption is wholly inaccurate. In addition to a standard advisory role, I represent the various and complex interests of this company's many investors, who are keen to see it succeed and not be bogged down with foolish undertakings. If anything, Sa'Sani must answer to me.''|Nas'Sirin}}",
        "Description": "Nas'Sirin was an older man, [[human]] in appearance, but [[pureblood]] [[yuan-ti]] in reality. He had a haughty personality, a strict attitude, and a permanent scowl affixed on his face. His body language combined boredom and irritated unease.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Nas'Sirin was technically superior to Sa'Sani through his connections to the investors and sponsors of her mercantile company while officially acting in an advisory role. Nas'Sirin had little patience in dealing with outsiders or anyone not in his immediate circle. Even though this seemed to be a personality trait, the attitude was due to the man being secretly a [[Snaketongue cult]]ist of [[Zehir]], whose goal was undermining Sa'Sani's attempts to rebuild trade in the south and the [[Sword Coast]]. After the cult's threat became evident, Nas'Sirin and Sa'Sani fled Samarach to the [[Crossroad Keep]] on the Sword Coast, despite Nas'Sirin's protestations. The man found the decision to be foolish, leaving Samargol without even trying to appeal to the council first, and he despised the fact that Sa'Sani chose to move the headquarters to a \"pitiful twice-ruined keep.\" Subsequently, with the help of a band of adventurers, Sa'Sani gathered enough clues to confront her advisor. Nas'Sirin was tortured for information on the cult and their plans and slain. With the knowledge in tow, Sa'Sani returned to Chult and headed to the [[Temple of World Serpent]] to face the interloper deity who was bringing her House to ruin."
