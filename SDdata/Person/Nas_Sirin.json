        "mainbody": "asSirin was the advisor and investors relationship manager of SaSanis Mercantile House in the late 14 century DR.\nNasSirin was an older man, human in appearance, but pureblood yuan-ti in reality. He had a haughty personality, a strict attitude, and a permanent scowl affixed on his face. His body language combined boredom and irritated unease.\nBy the , NasSirin was technically superior to SaSani through his connections to the investors and sponsors of her mercantile company while officially acting in an advisory role. NasSirin had little patience in dealing with outsiders or anyone not in his immediate circle. Even though this seemed to be a personality trait, the attitude was due to the man being secretly a Snaketongue cultist of Zehir, whose goal was undermining SaSanis attempts to rebuild trade in the south and the Sword Coast. After the cults threat became evident, NasSirin and SaSani fled Samarach to the Crossroad Keep on the Sword Coast, despite NasSirins protestations. The man found the decision to be foolish, leaving Samargol without even trying to appeal to the council first, and he despised the fact that SaSani chose to move the headquarters to a \"pitiful twice-ruined keep.\" Subsequently, with the help of a band of adventurers, SaSani gathered enough clues to confront her advisor. NasSirin was tortured for information on the cult and their plans and slain. With the knowledge in tow, SaSani returned to Chult and headed to the Temple of World Serpent to face the interloper deity who was bringing her House to ruin."
