Marquise '''Dresimil Chûmavh''' was the matriarch of [[House Chûmavh]], a [[drow]] clan that occupied [[Tower Chûmavhraele]] in a huge cavern beneath [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|123|1}}{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|1595}}

==Relationships==
Dresimil had two brothers, [[Jezzryd Chûmavh|Jezzryd]] and [[Jaeren Chûmavh|Jaeren]].

==History==
At some point between [[1367 DR]] and [[1479 DR]], [[House Chûmavh]] moved into the huge cavern beneath the city and built Tower Chûmavhraele. In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Dresimil was supervising the re-activation of the ancient [[drow]] [[mythal]] in the cavern when her drow accidentally released the [[rogue]] [[Jack Ravenwild]] from his imprisonment inside the mythal.

Jack escaped and Dresimil devoted some resources to recapturing Jack.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|3341}} Ultimately, she lent drow warriors to the [[slavery|slaver]] [[Cailek Balathorp|Fetterfist]] for an attack on a social gathering of Ravens Bluff nobles.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4263|13}}

The attack was repelled and a large force led by [[Myrkyssa Jelan]] descended to the [[Underdark]] to free nobles captured in the raid and Dresimil was killed by Myrkyssa during the battle.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4890|13}}
