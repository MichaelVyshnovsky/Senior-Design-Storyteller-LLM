        "Description": "In life, Jhesiyra was described by a fellow mage in [[Cormanthor]] as \"short, broad-shouldered, curvaceous more than muscular, with snapping dark brown eyes and lustrous light brown hair, worn long but curbed by magic into graceful shapes, never a flurry before her eyes or a tangle anywhere.\" Another considered her \"more a fierce flame, splendid in her energy, than a rose of placid beauty.\"\n\nAs a living spell, she was but a web of magical energy, shimmering and silvery, with a blue-white glow at its heart.",
        "History": "Alongside the other six apprentices of Halaster, Jhesiyra departed from [[Halaster's Hold]] in the {{YearlinkName|307}}. They apparently all went underground, planning to establish their own underground holds.<ref> But following Halaster's test, she left his service, and fled, knowing him to be utterly mad. Her writings afterward would tell the world what little was known of the Mad Mage.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = ...see magic made mighty without the madness and twisted evil I have grown all too used to.\n| source = Jhesiyra's stated purpose for journeying to Myth Drannor.\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}\nInstead, Jhesiyra traveled to [[Myth Drannor]] in [[Cormanthyr]], where she studied [[arcane magic]] among the [[elf|elven]] masters for several years. She almost alone developed the principle that even great masters of magic could still learn something from their lessers, and therefore that all [[wizard]]s should be forever students.\n\nShe had become quite interested in the [[spell web]]s weaved by groups of elven mages, before she became [[Magister]] in the {{YearlinkName|658}}, after the electrocution of [[Dathchaunt Sandrach]] the year before. Excited by her new power, Jhesiyra experimented with the creation of [[arcanaweave]]s, a type of elven spell web developed long before her arrival, and re-invigorated their idle research with her human passion. Hers would be [[living spell]]s that regenerated spells when needed, moved independently, perceived the world, and even be capable of sentience while remaining loyal to their creators, whom they would work with. Moreover, they would be made for specific purposes, such as maintaining forests, eradicating blights, and replanting trees.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = ...spreadeagled as if on a rack, surrounded by a glow of magic that pulsed and faded, like a dying firefly.\n| source = Description of Jhesiyra in her last known arcanaweave binding\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}\nLater, Jhesiyra even began binding herself into the arcanaweaves, which she term \"riding the weft\", so they could control them and commune with them and did this with increasingly bigger and more powerful arcanaweaves. She was last seen by two elven mage colleagues in the heart of one spider-like, tentatively crawling web that wandered away into the forest. After that, Jhesiyra disappeared from Myth Drannor and could not be found anywhere in [[Faerûn]]. While it seemed possible the arcanaweave could've drained her life and power completely, or else developed into some strange new entity, some theorized that she had been abducted by her former master, Halaster, as he did other mages of the city the [[668 DR|following year]].<ref> Confirmation of her death, or something like it, only came in late summer of the {{YearlinkName|667}}, when the mantle of Magister passed to [[Nerren Prentiyuel]], and neither [[Azuth]] nor [[Mystra]] were willing to speak of Jhesiyra Kestelharp's fate. \n\nIn fact, both the theories were true, but she was not dead—Jhesiyra had transformed herself into a particularly powerful living spell and Halaster had abducted and imprisoned her in Undermountain to create living spells for him.\n\nShe came to rule over the other living spells that she'd created, eventually escaping her prison and taking over Undermountain's [[Citadel of the Bloody Hand]], destroying the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|Waterdhavian City Guard]] garrison stationed there. Driven half mad by her transformation and centuries of imprisonment, she lived in constant fear of Halaster exacting his retribution for her escape.''Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage'' says Halaster trapped Jhesiyra Citadel of the Bloody Hand and she escaped during the Spellplague, but this conflates the events described in ''Expedition to Undermountain''. It may be that Halaster later trapped her within her former lair. In the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, she encountered [[adventurers]] on the [[Falling Stair]] who defeated two of her living ''[[flaming sphere]]s'' and impressed with their tenacity. Communicating by visions to arcane spellcasters, she offered them her ''horned ring'' to help them navigate Undermountain and accomplish their quest. But she would not permit them entrance to her lair, barring the way with a ''[[wall of force]]''.\n\nWhen the [[Spellplague]] struck in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the wards around the Citadel of the Bloody Hand failed and Jhesiyra escaped and used a ''wish'' spell to conceal herself within the stones of Undermountain itself. This state gave her control of its magical [[gate]]s and other aspects, some more so than even Halaster, but she was beyond the reach of all mortal magic now. Halaster was unaware of her presence, but questioned her disappearance.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = Turn back! You're not prepared for the danger that lies ahead!\n| source = Jhesiyra's warning to adventurers in Undermountain\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} she tried to manipulate and aid adventurers that entered Undermountain in order to use them to defeat the Mad Mage and become the master of the dungeon herself.

You're not prepared for the danger that lies ahead!\" though she could not be communicated with.",
        "Possessions": "Jhesiyra had one of the ''[[horned ring]]s'' given to Halaster's apprentices, though it was unknown what became of it after her disappearance.<ref><ref><ref> In fact, she had kept it the whole time and and later bestowed it on a band of adventurers in 1375 DR and again in 1492 DR; it's unclear if these are the same of different ''horned ring''s."
