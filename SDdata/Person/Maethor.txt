'''Maethor''' was a Baron of [[Galadorna]] during the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|It grieves me, men of Galadorna [...] to see such anger and open lawlessness in this chamber. This blustering of those who walk around with ready swords, and the merciless will to use them, is the very thing that must be stopped if the Galadorna we all love is to be saved from sinking into ... a land not worth saving or dwelling in, just another warlord's den.|Baron Maethor in 764 DR}}

==Description==
He was known to be silver-tongued, and was called a pretty boy at least once. He dressed richly, with a ruffled cloak, and had a perfect flowing mane of brown hair.

==Relationships==
His men wore purple tunics, gaining them the nickname of "purple poisoners". He was known to employ spies. He was no friend of Baron [[Tholone]], but was known to be his peer amongst the strongest barons. However, only Baron [[Feldrin]] sought his death at all costs.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|764}}, Baron Maethor supported the bid of Baron Tholone to ascend to the throne of Galadorna, in exchange for Baron Belundrar to take up service as seneschal. Feldrin, in turn, agreed to support Tholone's bid as well, in exchange for Maethor's future assassination. In any event, this did not materialize as the King and Tholone were both eliminated by Court Mage [[Ilgrist]] right in the middle of pronouncing Tholone king. As Ilgrist revealed himself to be Nadrathen, only to be eliminated by two newly arriving mages, [[Elminster Aumar]] and [[Dasumia]], Maethor briefly considered backstabbing Elminster. He decided against it as Dasumia crowned herself Queen of Galadorna, and then ordered her apprentice Elminster to bring her a vow of loyalty or a vital organ from every surviving baron.

Up until the later destruction of Galadorna, Maethor was still alive, and still known for his love of [[poison]] and intrigue.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|627|9}}

==Rumors==
He was seen as a man who spun a thousand intrigues, and danced in as many bedchambers.
