Jhaartael Ealoeth was a male feyri fighter/sorcerer bladesinger, and one of the daemonfey around the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
In 1370 DR, while posing as a moon elf from Evermeet, Jhaartael wandered the North in order to lure adventurers into the High Forest, where his fellow feyri ambushed and killed them.
In 1372 DR, he was in the daemonfeys hideout in the northern High Forest, under the command of Teryani Ealoeth.
