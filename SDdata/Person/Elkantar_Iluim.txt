'''Elkantar Iluim''' was the [[drow]] companion of [[Qilué Veladorn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Elkantar was a drow noble who had been sold into slavery by his matron mother because of his rebellious tendencies. He found refuge in the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]] in [[Skullport]], where he devoted himself to [[Eilistraee]] and her [[Chosen]] Qiluè. He became attracted to Qiluè and became her companion. They gave birth to a daughter, [[Ysolde Veladorn]].

Elkantar become the leader of the [[Protectors of the Song]], the temple guards.<ref>

In the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, Qiluè agreed to help [[Liriel Baenre]] against the [[Vhaeraun]]-worshiping [[Dragon's Hoard]], sending her warriors, including Elkantar, to attack their headquarters. However, during the fighting, despite their victory, [[Gorlist]] killed Elkantar.
