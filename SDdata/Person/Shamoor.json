Among other spells he had access to cure wounds, purify food and drink, bane, invisibility to undead, protection from good, obscuring mist, desecrate, contagion, unholy blight, and many others. Additionally to his divine gifts, Shamoor was quite knowledgeable in arcane, religion, potion-making, and wand-crafting.\nShamoor was armed with his masterwork heavy mace, and a light crossbow. He was well-protected by an enchanted +1 full plate, a cloak of resistance, and a mirror mask.\nShamoor was held personally responsible for the excavations and its failures by the Cults Wearers of Purple. They tasked him with recovery of magical items from the crypts to used them in the immersion ritual. The ritual that was to empower the dracolich Pelendralaar vis the corrupted pool of radiance.\nShamoor could not stand Ryngoths animal companion, the awakened dire badger Zulkir. His hate for the creature was so strong, Shamoor planned on putting pox on him.\nIn 1369 DR, during the Cult of the Dragons occupation of the ruins of Myth Drannor, Shamoor was one of the top commanders of Kya Mordrayns sect. He was personally to oversee the dangers of the Crypt of Kesefehon, Crypt of Orbakh, and Crypt of Rothilion\nDuring his time in Castle Cormanthor, Shamoor could most often be found in the vicinity of the pool of radiance, preparing the immersion ritual. A grotesque zombie dragon was raised and controlled by him. The undead creature served as Shamoors guardian and as a back-up body for dracolich Pelendralaar, in case the ritual failed and his physical shell was consumed and destroyed by the pure magic of the pool. When the adventuring gand who beat the Cult to the tombs found their way to the pool chamber to destroy Pelendralaars phylactery, Shamoor and his zombie dragon were among the defenders who faced the heroes. As the battle ended, Shamoors final fate remained unclear."
