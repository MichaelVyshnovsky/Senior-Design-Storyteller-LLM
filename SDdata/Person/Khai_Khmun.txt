Khai Khmun was a Red Wizard of Thay loyal to Araman. 
After Araman led a coup against Nefris, the headmistress  of the Academy of Shapers and Binders, he sent his loyal mage Khai Khmun to kill Lienna and Safiya. Khai managed to kill Lienna in Aglarond but crossed paths with the Kalach-Cha, who became forcibly involved in the matter. Thus, when Khai tried to kill Safiya, she allied with the Kalach-Cha in search of answers and the two killed Khai Khmun.
