'''Khai Khmun''' was a [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] loyal to [[Araman]]. 

==History==
After Araman led a coup against [[Nefris]], the headmistress  of the [[Academy of Shapers and Binders]], he sent his loyal mage Khai Khmun to kill [[Lienna]] and [[Safiya]]. Khai managed to kill Lienna in [[Aglarond]] but crossed paths with the [[Kalach-Cha]], who became forcibly involved in the matter. Thus, when Khai tried to kill Safiya, she allied with the Kalach-Cha in search of answers and the two killed Khai Khmun.<ref>
