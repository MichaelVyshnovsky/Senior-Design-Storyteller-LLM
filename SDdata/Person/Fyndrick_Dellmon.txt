'''Fyndrick Dellmon''' was the youngest son of [[Kerbin Dellmon]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], the [[Iceshield]] [[orc]]s attacked many farms around the Dellmon farm. However, Kerbin refused to abandon his farm and go to [[Yartar]]. Fyndrick was worried about the orcs. With the lucky arrival of some adventurers, the Dellmons managed to defend the farm.
