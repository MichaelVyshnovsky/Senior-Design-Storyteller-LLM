        "mainbody": "'''Korax of Manchar''' was a [[human]] male [[shukenja]] and follower of [[the Way]] from the town of [[Manchar]] in [[Koryo]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a holy man who wandered northern Koryo, and was famous for his kindness.",
        "Activities": "Korax commonly wandered the lands of northern [[Silla]] in Koryo, between [[Foo Nakar]] and [[Koje]], doing his holy work. Known for his great kindness, Korax often healed ill and wounded people whom he encountered, but departed before anyone could thank him. Rarely, he even resurrected a fallen warrior, provided they were of [[lawful good]] nature and had died in a battle against evil.\n\nKing [[Wanang Sun]] regularly met with Korax, asking for his sage advice on [[magic]] and other matters.",
        "Description": "Korax was tall and had long silvery hair, which he tied back with a leather thong. He wore the garb of the common folk of Koryo, namely an all-white work smock. Unusually, however, he belted it with an heavy leather girdle, a wide belt worked with colorful [[dye]]s and shimmering threads. He also bore a heavy [[iron]] ring on his right index finger.",
        "Possessions": "Korax owned a [[belt of giant strength|''girdle of stone giant strength'']] and his iron ring let him cast a [[lesser globe of invulnerability|''minor globe of invulnerability'']] once a day. These enchanted items were granted to him by an envoy of the [[Celestial Empire|Heavens]], in order that he use them to better mankind.",
        "History": "Korax once came across a wounded [[hare]], which turned out to be the [[Hare hengeyokai|hare]] [[hengeyokai]] [[Xax Chung]]. However, after healing him, Korax placed a ''[[geas]]'' on Xax, commanding that he must protect the people of the city of [[Koje]] until [[Jisziat's Tower]] was cast down. Finally, many years later, Xax died defending Koje from a [[dragon]] that tore down Jisziat's Tower.{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|2}}<ref group=\"note\">Only a wandering shukenja is mentioned in the source, but as a wandering, shukenja healer near Koje, it seems very clear that this in fact Korax.\n\nAround 1357 DR, Korax healed some twenty townsfolk of Koje. Although he did not give his name, the people erected a monument in thanks regardless.<ref group=\"note\">Similarly, this wandering shukenja healer is unnamed, but is assumed to be Korax."
