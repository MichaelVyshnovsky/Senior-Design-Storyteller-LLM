        "mainbody": "Korax of Manchar was a human male shukenja and follower of the Way from the town of Manchar in Koryo in the midâ€“14 century DR. He was a holy man who wandered northern Koryo, and was famous for his kindness.\nKorax commonly wandered the lands of northern Silla in Koryo, between Foo Nakar and Koje, doing his holy work. Known for his great kindness, Korax often healed ill and wounded people whom he encountered, but departed before anyone could thank him. Rarely, he even resurrected a fallen warrior, provided they were of lawful good nature and had died in a battle against evil.\nKing Wanang Sun regularly met with Korax, asking for his sage advice on magic and other matters.\nKorax was tall and had long silvery hair, which he tied back with a leather thong. He wore the garb of the common folk of Koryo, namely an all-white work smock. Unusually, however, he belted it with an heavy leather girdle, a wide belt worked with colorful dyes and shimmering threads. He also bore a heavy iron ring on his right index finger.\nKorax owned a girdle of stone giant strength and his iron ring let him cast a minor globe of invulnerability once a day. These enchanted items were granted to him by an envoy of the Heavens, in order that he use them to better mankind.\nKorax once came across a wounded hare, which turned out to be the hare hengeyokai Xax Chung. However, after healing him, Korax placed a geas on Xax, commanding that he must protect the people of the city of Koje until Jisziats Tower was cast down. Finally, many years later, Xax died defending Koje from a dragon that tore down Jisziats Tower.Only a wandering shukenja is mentioned in the source, but as a wandering, shukenja healer near Koje, it seems very clear that this in fact Korax.\nAround 1357 DR, Korax healed some twenty townsfolk of Koje. Although he did not give his name, the people erected a monument in thanks regardless.Similarly, this wandering shukenja healer is unnamed, but is assumed to be Korax."
