        "mainbody": "'''Hhormun''' was an elder member of the [[War Wizards]] of [[Cormyr]], that served the Forest Kingdom during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He was a rather portly man that could be quite energetic despite his old age.",
        "Relationships": "He was the superior War Wizard to [[Caladnei]] for a time, before her ascent as Mage Royal of Cormyr.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the flying [[Netheril|Netherese]] city of [[Thultanthar]] returned to the Realms, and quickly emerged as a threat to Cormyr and the rest of the [[Heartlands]]. In [[Mirtul]] of that year, Hhormun, Caladnei, and a band of [[Purple Dragons]] hid themselves amidst a tribe of [[Bedine]] nomads in order to uncover the location of the Shadovar city. During their journey, Hhormun gave just a bit too much leeway over planning to Sheikh [[Sa'ar]] of the [[Bait Mahwa]], allowing the Bedine to capture resting [[veserab]]s owned by the [[Shadovar]]. This act of aggression drew the Shadovar into battle, forced them to call for reinforcements, and ultimately offered the Cormyreans the location of Thultanthar.\n\nRather than strike out at the flying city however,"
