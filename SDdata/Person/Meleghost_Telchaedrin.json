        "mainbody": "eleghost Telchaedrin was a Halruaan nobleman, wizard and adventurer in the 14 century DR.\nHe was very tall, with a very long nose. His breath smelled of old spices, which was somehow pleasant.\nHe knew many spells, which included teleport and almost certainly fly. He possessed some means to mindscry people at a distance, and used the power to chat.\nHis home had at least one high-vaulted hall, with a round window as tall as six men.\nMeleghost used to adventure in his youth.\nOne of the people Meleghost adventured with was Thabrant Swordsilver. He was an older uncle of Sarde Telchaedrin.\nCaladneis last mission with the Brightstar Sash was a request from Sarde Telchaedrin during its completion, she received a missive from Lord Meleghost Telchaedrin. She went to meet him at his home, and he told her that their mission was a ruse by Sarde to get them to attack a rival family, instructing her to flee Halruaa immediately and alone. He also revealed he knew Caladneis father, Thabrant Swordsilver, and that they were friends. The man explained that now that Thabrant Swordsilver was dying, his pride was gone and he just wanted Caladnei back with him for the end. To this end, he yielded unto her the teleport spell Caladnei insisted on trading him a spell of flight. Though he claimed he already had it, he accepted hers.\nPeople in Halruaa considered Lord Meleghost Telchaedrin an \"odd one\"."
