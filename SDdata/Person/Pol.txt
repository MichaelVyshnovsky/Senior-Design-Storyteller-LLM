'''Pol''', or '''Brother Pol''', was a knight, [[wizard]], and [[cleric]] of [[Helm]] at [[Watcher's Keep]] in [[Amn]].

The god Helm gave Pol and his fellow knights the task of sealing [[Demogorgon]] inside the keep. Knowing it was a difficult mission, his leader, [[Odren]], recruited [[Gorion's Ward]] to work for him. Pol gave Gorion's Ward the [[Vigil Stone]], which he needed to enter the keep.<ref>
