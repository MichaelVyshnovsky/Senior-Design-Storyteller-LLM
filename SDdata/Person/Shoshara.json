        "mainbody": "Shoshara was a priestess of Eilistraee in Shilmista.\nIn 1377 DR, she was arguing with Glorst, a former priest of Vhaeraun, about which of their gods had absorbed the other in their duel in 1375 DR, when they were approached by Halisstra Melarn. Glorst tried to kill her but was defeated. Later Halisstra interrogated Shoshara about the current situation and the location of Cavatina Xarann. However, Shoshara distrusted her and refused her aid, despite Halisstras suffering. So, at last feeling betrayed by Eilistraee, Halisstra killed Shoshara."
