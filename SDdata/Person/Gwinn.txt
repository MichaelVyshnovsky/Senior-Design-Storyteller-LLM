Gwinn was a human inhabitant of Longsaddle in the Savage Frontier in the late 15 century DR.
She was a tall and athletic barbarian woman.
Gwinn was the second wife of Marlamin, a halfling man.
In the late 1490s DR, Gwinn met and married Marlamin. Theyd been together almost a year when his ex-wife Holga Kilgore visited. At that time, Gwinn had "squashed" a pack of bullywugs and came home bloody and carrying a sack and briefly met Holga. Marlamin explained to Holga he preferred that Gwinn made an honest living, not thieving as Holga did. Accepting that Marlamin was happy with Gwinn, Holga departed. Later, the couple had a goose and pickleberries for dinner.
