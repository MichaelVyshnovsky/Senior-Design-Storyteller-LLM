'''Gwinn''' was a [[human]] inhabitant of [[Longsaddle]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}

==Description==
She was a tall and athletic [[barbarian]] woman.

==Relationships==
Gwinn was the second wife of [[Marlamin]], a [[halfling]] man.

==History==
In the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Gwinn met and married Marlamin. They'd been together almost a year when his ex-wife [[Holga Kilgore]] visited. At that time, Gwinn had "squashed" a pack of [[bullywug]]s and came home bloody and carrying a sack and briefly met Holga. Marlamin explained to Holga he preferred that Gwinn made an honest living, not thieving as Holga did. Accepting that Marlamin was happy with Gwinn, Holga departed. Later, the couple had a [[goose]] and [[pickleberry|pickleberries]] for dinner.
