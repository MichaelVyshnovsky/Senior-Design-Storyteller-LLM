        "mainbody": "Haedraline was a Old One who was made a Word Slave bound to the Words of Power. \nThe Hero of Neverwinter first met her while searching for the Words of Power, and she offered help in finding them and eventually defeating Morag. Her help was dubious, however, offering only warnings about Morag and Maugrim, and insisting the Words of Power be found. She offered to tell the heroes about the history of the Creator Races and the Words the North of Faer√ªn was once a tropical jungle, ideal for the cold-blooded Old Ones, but as it began to cool the ruler of the Old Ones made the Source Stone and the Words of Power, magical artifacts capable of warming the entire planet. Haedraline explained that the Source Stone, buried beneath Neverwinter in its dormant state, was why the city never experienced harsh winters.\nHaedraline later presented herself to the rulers of Neverwinter, who imprisoned her, thinking she was aligned with the other members of the Old Ones. She alerted the city to the presence and location of the Source Stone, and told the heroes how to access it to defeat Morag.\nAfter the Hero defeated Morag, the magic that sustained both Haedraline and the Source Stone Chamber began to destabilize. Though dying, Haedraline used to last of her energy to create a portal to a pocket dimension, allowing the hero to escape the collapsing chamber and back to Neverwinter. \nIn the  pocket dimension, she spoke to the Hero one last time, saying that she accepted her end as the time of the Old Ones was over and was glad that Morag was finally defeated."
