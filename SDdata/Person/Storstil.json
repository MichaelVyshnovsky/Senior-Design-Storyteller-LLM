He was sour a sour man.\nStorstil often wore a distinctive tunic, dun in color with red trim. The man was slim.\nHe owned a pipe and smokeweed.\nStorstil worked as a caravan drover in Orthil Voldovans caravan. He was part of the caravan when they headed from Scornubel to Waterdeep in late , and were joined by Shandril Shessair.\nWhile relieving himself and trying to get a smoke in, Storstil was slain by an unknown assailant who reduced his head to ash with an intense flame.\nThorst, another caravan guard, was inclined to believe Shandril was his slayer. Narbuth, yet another fellow, thought Narm Tamaraith was instead."
