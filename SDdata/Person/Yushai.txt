'''Yushai''' was the [[animal companion]] of the [[priest]] and [[druid]] of [[Ubtao]], [[Umoja]] of [[Chult]] in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Yushai was a green-hued [[deinonychus]] with a bright green underside. Despite being a ferocious predator, Yushai behaved more akin to a loyal dog, regularly looking up at his master with puppy-like eyes, looking for affection and approval.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Yushai accompanied its master Umoja to the jungles of [[Samarach]] and into the city of [[Samargol]]. His deity guided the druid to combat the growing threat of the [[yuan-ti]] deity. The duo stayed at the [[Openpalm Bazar]] in Samargol and offered healing to a group of [[adventurer]]s who were survivors of the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]''. When Umoja accompanied the group on their adventures into the jungles, and later back to the [[Sword Coast]], Umoja instructed his [[dinosaur]] companion to remain in the Samarachan jungles until he returned.
