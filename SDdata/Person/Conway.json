        "mainbody": "Conway was a ranger who led a strike force ordered by Maerovyna of the Harvest House on the secret temple of Bhaal masquerading as an innocent monastery on the outskirts of Liams Hold.\nConway owned a pair of enchanted boots of speed.\nShortly before the Time of Troubles, on Eleint 16, 1358 DR, Maerovyna of the Harvest House in Daggerford was investigating a slew of murders and child abductions that all converged on the monastery in Liams Hold. The true nature of the monastery was uncovered, and a small strike force of Chaunteas followers, rangers, and Misty Forest elves assembled. The leader of the assault was the ranger Conway.\nThe assault ended with defeat. The attackers were all slain, and Conway was gravely wounded. His body was the only one never recovered following the disastrous attack. After being hurt, Conway used his magic boots to escape. He found a way into the crypts underneath Liams Hold and there died of his injuries. Conways skeletal remains were still in the crypts in 1372 DR."
