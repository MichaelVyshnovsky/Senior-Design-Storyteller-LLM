        "mainbody": "'''Webb Mossfeld''' was a [[human]] of the village of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "He was a brother of [[Wyl Mossfeld|Wyl]] and [[Ward Mossfeld]].",
        "Activities": "Webb, like his brothers, was a member of the West Harbor militia.",
        "History": "Webb was the bully of West Harbor, who would tease the [[Kalach-Cha]], [[Bevil Starling]] and [[Amie Fern]]. They were the champions of the Harvest Fair for several years.\n\nDuring the Harvest Fair in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Webb and his brothers competed in the Harvest Brawl. The Kalach-Cha, Amie, and Bevil, after defeating the [[Lannon siblings]], would've faced Webb, Ward, and Wyl. If the Kalach-Cha, Amie, and Bevil were defeated, they could've asked [[Merring]] for a rematch or acknowledged that the Mossfelds had won.\n\nDuring the attack of [[bladeling]]s and [[duergar]], the Kalach-Cha could've encountered Webb, who would fight the attackers. Once finished, he could've been asked to go to the field to defend the town. \n\nIn the subsequent attack on West Harbor by [[bladeling]]s and [[duergar]], the Mossfields aided in the defense. The Kalach-Cha, Bevil, and Amie may have encountered Webb fighting the attackers. Once finished, he could've been asked to go to the field to defend the town.\n\nWhen the Kalach-Cha and companions later returned to the village to reassemble the ''[[Sword of Gith]]'', they encountered Ward and his brothers. However, it was an ambush, as they had been slain and transformed into [[shadow]]s."
