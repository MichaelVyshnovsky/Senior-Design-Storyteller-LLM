Iriaebor
Alora was a halfling thief that lived in the Western Heartlands during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Alora was extremely curious about the world around her and wanted little more than to explore every "off-limits" area of her surroundings. She did so with an upbeat attitude and carefree outlook. Her unique charm and sweet demeanor often prevented her from getting into real trouble with the authorities.
Unlike many thieves she had little interest in material wealth or riches.
She had a high-pitched voice that resembled that of a human child. She frequently spoke in "baby talk" using words like "grumpypuss" or "hamsty-wamsty" when referring to a hamster.
Quite fitting to her chosen profession, Alora owned a lucky rabbits foot.
