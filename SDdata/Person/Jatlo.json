        "mainbody": "'''Jatlo''' was a [[redcap]] servant of the [[green hag]] named [[Auntie Ethel]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "In his redcap form, Jatlo's appearance was similar to most other members of his [[fey]] race. When he took on the guise of a [[dragonborn]], Jatlo appeared as a sinister-looking green-scaled dragon humanoid with no fins nor horns on his [[snake]]-like face.",
        "History": "[[File:Jatlo Snakeman.png|thumb|''Jatlo's sinister [[dragonborn]] guise.''|300x300px]]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Jatlo was ordered by his mistress to infiltrate the [[Anti-Hag Support Group]] formed by Auntie Ethel's victim – [[Mayrina]]. The redcap penned a letter to the support group asking to join them, creating a story of how his brother was a fellow victim of an evil hag. Jatlo claimed that his bother asked a hag for fame and wealth and was turned into a statue in his hometown's square with a plaque that read \"'Toss a Coin for Luck.\" When Jatlo was allowed to join, he placed a ''[[curse]]'' on Mayrina using the hag's ''[[hex doll]]'' – a payback from Ethel. With Mayrina out of the picture, the redcap was trying to find a [[book]] that help the recipe for ''[[hag's bane]]'' – a concoction that could save the life of a child devoured by a hag.\n\nIt was unknown if Jatlo was successful or if he was found out and slain by the [[Absolute Adversaries]], who themselves as a bone to pick with Auntie Ethel."
