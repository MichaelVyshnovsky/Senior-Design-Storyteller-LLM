'''Krondac''' was a baron in [[Hlath]] in [[Chondath]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
In 1358 DR, Krondac was called to a meeting of prominent citizens gathered by Lord [[Fior Botpur]] to discuss the menace of a barbarian army from [[Kara-Tur]]. He proposed [[Pohidge Plam]] serve as the main commander and to attack the enemy before they reached the city. 

He took part in the defense of the city.

==Personality==
Krondac was a very poor strategist. He wanted Pohidge as leader only because he believed he could manipulate him.
