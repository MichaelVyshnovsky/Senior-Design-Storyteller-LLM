Krondac was a baron in Hlath in Chondath in 1358 DR.
In 1358 DR, Krondac was called to a meeting of prominent citizens gathered by Lord Fior Botpur to discuss the menace of a barbarian army from Kara-Tur. He proposed Pohidge Plam serve as the main commander and to attack the enemy before they reached the city. 
He took part in the defense of the city.
Krondac was a very poor strategist. He wanted Pohidge as leader only because he believed he could manipulate him.
