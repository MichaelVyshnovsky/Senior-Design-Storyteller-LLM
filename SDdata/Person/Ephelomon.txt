Ephelomon was a red great wyrm consort of the Queen of Dragons, Tiamat, and later a consort of the Lich-Queen, Vlaakith I.
In ancient times, after the giths uprising against the illithids and the schism between the giths, Mother Gith sought out potential allies to secure her races future and advance the Eternal Crusade. Giths advisor Vlaakith proposed the goddess Tiamat an agreement, details of which remained a secret. To conclude the agreement Mother Gith went to the Nine Hells herself and never returned.
Ephelomon stayed with Vlaakith I and became her consort. The duthkagith, who were half-githyanki warriors, claimed to be descended from Ephelomon. Some tales of their birth suggested that Vlaakith employed Ephelomons bloodline to fashion them as preeminent warriors, surpassing the majority of the githyanki.
After the end of the War of the Comet, a story detailing Prince Orpheuss demise was relayed to the githyanki people. It was said that Orpheus had been killed by Kithrak Voss and Ephelomon had devoured the remains of the princes body. In the , however, the True Soul heroes discovered that the prince remained among the living, and this narrative was revealed to be one of Vlaakith Is and her descendants schemes.
After Ephelomons death one of his horns was used to create the Draakhorn.
