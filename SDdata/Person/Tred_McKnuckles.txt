Tred McKnuckles was a stout dwarf with a yellow beard. He wore a throwing hammer on the back of each shoulder. He was a skilled blacksmith and farrier, and was often called upon by King Emerus Warcrown to shoe horses.
Tred had a brother called Duggan McKnuckles
Tred used a single-bladed axe with a point at its tip, and also a double-bladed axe.
During late winter when it was attacked by a band of orcs and boulder-hurling frost giants. Tred was injured during this attack, and only he and Nikwillig survived. They stumbled across the hamlet of Clicking Heels where they were given food and healing, before continuing their journey, encountering Bruenor Battlehammers caravan, and joining up with them.
