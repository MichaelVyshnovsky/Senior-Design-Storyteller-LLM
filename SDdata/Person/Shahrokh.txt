Shahrokh was an extremely powerful djinn lord and was the vizar to the pasha of Calimport.
Shahrokh was a powerful mage who was even able to penetrate Acham el Jhotoss wards to enter the city of Almraiven.
He worked with efreet to complete the Ritual of Return, which would free Calim and Memnon from their prison.
Like most djinn, Shahrokh had no legs rather, his lower body was a whirlwind. He was larger than most genies.
