{{Quote|I have received your letter and am quite overjoyed by your proposition. I have told my wife, and she is as excited as I am...This will be our greatest feat yet! To kill three Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate!|Slythe, in a letter to [[Sarevok]].}}

==Possessions==
The skilled assassin possessed the ''[[Shadow's Blade]]'', a unique ''[[short sword of backstabing]]''.

==Activities==
He conducted his business out of the [[Undercellar]] of Baldur's Gate.

==Relationships==
Slythe worked alongside his wife and fellow killer-for-hire, [[Krystin]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Slythe and Krystin were hired by [[Sarevok Anchev]] to slay three Dukes of [[Baldur's Gate]]. They managed to kill [[Entar Silvershield]] before regrouping to kill Duchess [[Liia Jannath]] and Duke [[Belt]] at Sarevok's coronation. Unfortuantely for the duo, they were confronted in the Undercellar and themselves killed before they could complete the job.
