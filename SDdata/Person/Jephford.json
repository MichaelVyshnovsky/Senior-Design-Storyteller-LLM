Jephford was one of these Purple Dragons; after Glathra revealed they were seeking out the sages [[Orkrash]], [[Loagranboydar]], [[Garendor]], [[Argrant]], and [[Wyshbryn]], and that they were doing other tasks as well, Jephford blurted out she must be looking for nobles born with a talent for [[the Art]] so as to determine who was responsible for the [[blueflame ghost]] featuring in the massacre. Glathra all but confirmed his conclusion.\n\nAfter the five sages were discovered slain, Vainrence cast a spell to determine how they were killed. A lurking contingency exploded the room in response. Only one of the Purple Dragons survived."
