        "mainbody": "'''Elklund Oromanche''' was one of the many [[Oromanche]] siblings of a prominent [[Mosstonian]] merchant family in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Every member of the Oromanche family was described to have \"dark, lush good looks,\" which made the family lush with rumors of and well-publicized trysts. The family was known for being flamboyant and grand individuals.",
        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Oromanche clan was one of the most successful merchant organizations in [[Tethyr]] and the town of Mosstone. [[Maerele Oromanche]] was the matriarch of the clan and the oldest sibling. The rest brothers and sisters were much younger including [[Odyle Oromanche|Odyle]], [[Imraphar Oromanche|Imraphar]], [[Olora Oromanche|Olora]], [[Emruelle Oromanche|Emruelle]], and [[Haladeira Oromanche|Haladeira]]. Most contributed to the family's mercantile activities. [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]] had a warm relationship with the family, but his attitude towards Elklund Oromanche was notably cold."
