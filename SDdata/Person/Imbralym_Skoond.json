        "mainbody": "Imbralym Skoond was a wizard and member of the Parliament of Peers in Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nImbralym desired to use his magical power to acquire great riches. He was an amoral but charming individual.\nOriginally, Imbralym worked as a dancing master in Athkatla, Amn, before he realized his talent for magic. He went to Baldurs Gate to search for a rich sponsor. Imbralym soon attracted the interest of Grand Duke Torlin Silvershield, who, after proving his suitability and that he was not a threat, made him one of his subordinates. Duke Silvershield also appointed Imbralym as a member of the Parliament of Peers by 1479 DR."
