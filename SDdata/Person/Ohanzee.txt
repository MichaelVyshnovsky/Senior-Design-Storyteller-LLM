'''Ohanzee''' was a [[sorcerer]] living in [[Unther]] in [[1374 DR]].

==Activities==
Ohanzee lived at the [[Altar of Scales]] temple of [[Tiamat]] in [[Unthalass]]. He helped in [[Malise]]'s experiments in exchange for funds. Usually, all his familiars died because Ohanzee forgot to care for them.

==Personality==
Ohanzee cared little about [[Tiamat]] or her temple. He was a bitter man with a strong sense of self-importance and a cruel steak. He enjoyed hurting people but always protected himself.
