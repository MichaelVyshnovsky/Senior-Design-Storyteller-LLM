Ohanzee was a sorcerer living in Unther in 1374 DR.
Ohanzee lived at the Altar of Scales temple of Tiamat in Unthalass. He helped in Malises experiments in exchange for funds. Usually, all his familiars died because Ohanzee forgot to care for them.
Ohanzee cared little about Tiamat or her temple. He was a bitter man with a strong sense of self-importance and a cruel steak. He enjoyed hurting people but always protected himself.
