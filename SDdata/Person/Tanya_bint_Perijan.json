        "mainbody": "Tanya bint Perijan was one of Grand Caliph Khalil al-Assad al-Zahirs favorite wives.\nHer dowry for her engagement to the Grand Caliph was a staggering 500,000 dinars, instantly propelling her family to prominent status among the elite of Huzuz.\nStill in her early 20s, Tanya was young and stunningly beautiful. She had rich sable hair and dark eyes that she accented further with kohl. Her favorite color was yellow, and she often wore garments and gold jewelry of this color. Her hands and feet were dyed with henna.\nTanya was an opportunist and constantly thirsted for power, though she remained devoted to her husband.\nTanya had only but to ask to receive just about anything one could imagine, but she was known to always have in her possession a ring of protection +3, a ring of invisibility, a scarab of deception, a dagger +2, oil of attractiveness, and a philter of love.\nAs Khalils favored wife, Tanya ruled the other wives and concubines of the Royal Harim through friendship, bribery, or blackmail.\nTanya was the daughter of Perijan and Khwaja, both members of a powerful trading family based out of Gana in the Pearl Cities.\nShe had two daughters with her husband, Janya and Dalia."
