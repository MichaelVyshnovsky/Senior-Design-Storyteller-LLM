        "mainbody": "eowen was a half-elven \"Harper\" agent who worked for a man named Teygan against the Zhentarims grab for power on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 century DR.\nBeowen had medium-length blonde hair, delicate elven features, and a strong human body. He wore brown clothes and armor along with a cloak.\nMiyandra and Beowen both used false Harper identities when they accompanied Teygan—or the infamous Sememmon, the enemy of Fzoul Chembryl of the Zhentarim—to a cave base outside the city of Daggerford. The three briefly aided the Hero of Daggerford in discovering the Black Networks plans for Daggerford. Once \"Teygan\" delivered invaluable hints and advice to the Hero, all three \"Harpers\" abandoned the cave base, happy with their involvement in the foiling of Fzouls plans."
