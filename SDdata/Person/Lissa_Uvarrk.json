Per [[Rilitar Shadow-water]], she had died some time before [[Mirtul 20]] of {{yearlink|1373}}. Presumably, this was because of a spirit she summoned, which slipped her leash.{{cite book/The Rage||2}} By [[Mirtul 26]], [[Taegan Nightwind]] and him were disabused of the idea, and certain that she had not summoned any spirits, but that a different magician had bound the fiend and used it to slay her.{{cite book/The Rage||5}}"
