'''Elsger''' was a [[Mar (ethnicity)|Mar]] sailor on board the ''[[Morning Bird]]'' under cowardly captain [[Jander Turbalt]] in the mid–14{{th}} century DR.

==History==
Elsger was part of the crew of the ship hired by a mysterious individual named [[Belmer Droon]] to transport himself and his hirelings under the cover of night from [[Tharkar]] to [[Eldrinpar]]. The voyage turned out to be a dangerous one as shortly after sailing the ''Morning Bird'' was chased by a grim-looking black ship. The black ship bombarded the ''Bird'' with [[fire pot missile]]s and terrifying ''[[boneball]]s'', making the passengers and the crew fight for their lives. Narrowly escaping the pursuers, thanks to Belmer's skill and [[magic item]]s, the ''Morning Bird'' found itself besieged by [[Umberlee]]'s ''[[ghost ship]]'' and its [[sea zombie]]s.

After appeasing the Bitch Queen, the ''Morning Bird'' was caught up with by the ''[[Black Dragon (ship)|Black Dragon]]'', helmed by the infamous captain [[Orim Redbeard]]. Belmer Droon managed to convince the pirate captain to leave them alone, even though one of his hirelings, [[Kurthe Lornar]], was getting ready to take over the ''Bird'' and pursue Orim Redbeard, blinded with vengeance. Kurthe ordered Elsger to aid him. Kurthe Lornar himself was killed in a duel with Belmer over the attempted mutiny.

Soon after, the ''Morning Bird'' sprouted leaks, likely because of Orim Redbeard's magic, rotting the hull of the ship. The crew and passengers had to evacuate the sinking ship and swim with their belongings to the shores of [[Doegan]]. Surviving the dangers of open waters, they soon encountered the creatures that made Doegan infamously deadly—the "[[fiend]]s". Elsger was the first victim of the evil creatures when he was snatched and eviscerated by a forest-dwelling "fiend", left hanging in the [[shadowtop]] trees like a freshly buttered meat in a slaughterhouse.
