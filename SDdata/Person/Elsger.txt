Elsger was a Mar sailor on board the Morning Bird under cowardly captain Jander Turbalt in the mid–14 century DR.
Elsger was part of the crew of the ship hired by a mysterious individual named Belmer Droon to transport himself and his hirelings under the cover of night from Tharkar to Eldrinpar. The voyage turned out to be a dangerous one as shortly after sailing the Morning Bird was chased by a grim-looking black ship. The black ship bombarded the Bird with fire pot missiles and terrifying boneballs, making the passengers and the crew fight for their lives. Narrowly escaping the pursuers, thanks to Belmers skill and magic items, the Morning Bird found itself besieged by Umberlees ghost ship and its sea zombies.
After appeasing the Bitch Queen, the Morning Bird was caught up with by the Black Dragon, helmed by the infamous captain Orim Redbeard. Belmer Droon managed to convince the pirate captain to leave them alone, even though one of his hirelings, Kurthe Lornar, was getting ready to take over the Bird and pursue Orim Redbeard, blinded with vengeance. Kurthe ordered Elsger to aid him. Kurthe Lornar himself was killed in a duel with Belmer over the attempted mutiny.
Soon after, the Morning Bird sprouted leaks, likely because of Orim Redbeards magic, rotting the hull of the ship. The crew and passengers had to evacuate the sinking ship and swim with their belongings to the shores of Doegan. Surviving the dangers of open waters, they soon encountered the creatures that made Doegan infamously deadly—the "fiends". Elsger was the first victim of the evil creatures when he was snatched and eviscerated by a forest-dwelling "fiend", left hanging in the shadowtop trees like a freshly buttered meat in a slaughterhouse.
