'''Rizzeryl''' was a [[drow]] wizard in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Activities==
Rizzeryl led a hidden base inside the [[Arcane Chambers]] managed by eight [[Zhent]] [[wererat]]s.

==History==
In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} some [[wererat]] minions of Rizzeryl stole a key from the southern watch post of the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]] on the level. Rizzeryl falsely believed it opened a [[Melairkyn]] vault. The Xanathar lieutenant [[Shunn Shurreth]] wanted to kidnap and ransom a wererat to get the key back.

==Personality==
Rizzeryl liked to remain invisible when dealing with outsiders. As a Zhent ally, he wanted to destroy the Xanathar's influence in the Arcane Chambers.

==Relationship==
Rizzeryl worked for two masters: on the surface, he was an ally of the [[Zhentarim]] but secretly he worked for the [[drow]] [[House Auvryndar]]. He had a [[quasit]] [[familiar]] and had good dealings with the leader of the Zhent wererats.
