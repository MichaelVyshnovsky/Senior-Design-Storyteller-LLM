He was known to have lived in the Tower Terrible in Wrinklestone in the Sword Coast North, before traveling beyond the world of Toril.\nWhile his physical appearance was that of a hunched-over, untidy man who often muttered to himself, Grimwald was known for having a kind heart.\nGrimwald founded the School of Wizardry in 457 DR, along with the other renowned wizards Aganazzar, Ilyykur, and Presper. with the aim of fostering, and enforcing, peace between the warring tribes of the North. They marked this occasion by the creation of a collective spellbook known as the Tome of the Covenant, which possessed spells of each mages creation.\nUnfortunately the mages apprentices never took on the pact of their masters and the school went largely inactive for many years. Grimwald and Presper began to embark on a series of adventures through portals, but only returned to Toril a few times in between travels, the last known visit occurring in 1298 DR. Grimwalds home was looted long before 1372 DR.\nIn the late 14 century DR, Grimwald and Presper encountered the wizard Savengriff in their travels across the planes. After some discussion, the three decided to reform the Covenant, this time based in the city of Waterdeep.\n*Grimwalds greymantle This spell prevented healing or regeneration effects from working on a single creature.\nThe blades known as Grimwalds daggers were named after the wizard, who was notorious for taunting his pet cats."
