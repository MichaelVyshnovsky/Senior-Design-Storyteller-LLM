        "mainbody": "Beltar Whitewave was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the midâ€“15 century DR.\nHe was greatly renowned and respected amongst his peers. He was also the father of Amarune Whitewave.\nBeltar Whitewave was slain in an ambush by hire-spell mages brought by Sembian smugglers. Afterwards, the smugglers knifed the rest of his family in the middle of the night Amarune alone escaped.\nThe Helhondreths and the Ilmbrights blamed Beltar for the loss of a chest of waterstars. After his death, Lady Talane attested to having manipulated Beltar in some manner during his life, and implied that it may have been the cause of their presumption on his guilt, which in turn may even have been part of the reason why he was slain."
