'''Umi''' was a [[tiefling]] child from [[Elturel]] that was forced to live as a refugee with others of his kind for some time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Oh! Uh....right. 'Go for the heart."|Umi, repeating his training on how to fight [[goblin]]s.}}

==History==
After the city of Elturel was [[the Descent|dragged down]] to the [[Nine Hells]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the city's tieflings were blamed for the disaster and subsequently exiled. Umi was among a group of them led by the [[Hellrider]] [[Zevlor]], that ventured west across the [[Risen Road]] towards [[Baldur's Gate]].

After being attacked by [[goblin]]s, the Elturian tieflings were given shelter at the [[Emerald Grove]] by the benevolent druid [[Halsin]]. While living in the cave system at the grove's entrance, [[Asharak]] set to teach the tiefling children some basics about how to defend themselves if threatened while on the road. Umi was rather excitable and not quite as focused as some of the other children.
