'''Dukar Krabbellor''', who was nicknamed '''Hammerhand''', was a laborer inhabiting the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Dukar never mentioned his first name to anyone to the point where he nearly forgot it himself. Instead, he prefered to go by Hammerhand. A suiting nickname considering that one of his hands was made from [[iron]]. He was obsessed with finding the person responsible for killing his brother in [[Cormyr]]. All he knew for certain was that they were a [[wizard]] who had a [[half-orc]] bodyguard.
