Dukar Krabbellor, who was nicknamed Hammerhand, was a laborer inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Dukar never mentioned his first name to anyone to the point where he nearly forgot it himself. Instead, he prefered to go by Hammerhand. A suiting nickname considering that one of his hands was made from iron. He was obsessed with finding the person responsible for killing his brother in Cormyr. All he knew for certain was that they were a wizard who had a half-orc bodyguard.
