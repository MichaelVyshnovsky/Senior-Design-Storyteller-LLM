{{Quote|I come in peace, but being alone in these dangerous times, I fear for my hide every night. Might I share your fire? I will work healing on anyone amongst you that needs it, if you will let me share your company until the morrow.|Theln, to a group of [[adventurer]]s during the [[Avatar Crisis]].}}

==Description==
He was rather short, with wide-set shoulders.

==Personality==
Coming from a noble family, Theln was a man of culture and refinement. However, he was not so pampered that he could not could brave life on the road. When he did encounter others during his travels, Theln was kindly and forthright in his dealings.

==Possessions==
Theln wore [[padded armor]] dyed the color of a [[rose]] along with a metal [[helm|helm]]. He carried with him a simple [[iron]] [[mace]], his [[holy symbol]] of [[Lathander]], bandages for tending wounds, and several [[scroll]]s of ''[[cure light wounds]]''.

==Activities==
While on the road, Theln offered healing services to other travelers and adventurers. In exchange he only asked for an evening's company and the comfort of a shared campfire.

==History==
Theln was born in [[Waterdeep]] to the city's noble [[Roaringhorn (Waterdeep)|Roaringhorn]] family. He traveled across the Realms carrying out Lathander's will for many years. In winter of the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Theln was in [[Soubar]] along the [[Trade Way]] when he and others of his faith witnessed an appearance Lathander himself. The Morninglord imparted upon his faithful a prophecy regarding the [[Bane|"Hidden One"]], a prideful being that would commit a great theft that would lead to all the gods being sent down to [[Faerûn]].

When the gods were banished to the Realms, during the [[Time of Troubles]] the [[1358 DR|following year]], Theln had made his way to the [[Dragon Reach]] region of the [[Eastern Heartlands]]. It was there he met a group of adventurers questing for the ''[[Tablets of Fate]]'', and directed them to the [[Spouting Fish (Waterdeep)|Spouting Fish]], a rather friendly inn in [[Zhentilar]]-occupied [[Scardale Town]].
