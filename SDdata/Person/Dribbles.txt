Dribbles (a.k.a. Norris Greenie), known as the Master of Puns and Punchlines, was a clown and entertainer who worked at the Circus of the Last Days, which travelled across the various planes of existence. He continued his act until late 15 century of the Faer√ªnian calendar, when the circus traveled to Toril on the Prime Material plane, when he was ceremoniously slain by Bhaalist murders and the remains of his body were scattered across the breadth of Baldurs Gate.
Dribbles dressed in outlandish, fools motley befitting his role in the circus. He painted his face white, with whimsical makeup, and dyed his hair a vibrant shade of pink. Dribbles wore a ring with a grinning face on his left hand.
He wielded the clown hammer, an enchanted maul that could incite fits of laughter in anyone it struck.

Dribbles act included the recitation of strained puns, animal-charming, and "magic tricks" involving members of his audience. Mass murders were notably not a part of his usual performances. The clown was absolutely adored by fans from across the planes, people that were counted among myriad races and faiths throughout.
He performed his act with the assistance of Bitey Buddy, a particularly fearsome looking blink dog.
In the , Dribbles was slain when the Circus of Last Days visited the city of Baldurs Gate on the planet of Toril. Dribbles was replaced by a doppelganger named Fumm, who appeared to be loyal to the Cult of the Absolute. Dribbles body was rendered piece by piece, and scattered across the city. Some limbs or portions of his body were found at the sites of other grisly murders.
The perpetrators of those were murders were followers of the false Chosen of Bhaal, Orin the Red. It was not Orins associates among the Absolutists that were responsible for Dribbles death, rather aspiring murders who wished to prove loyalty to the Dread Lords Tribunal in the Baldurian Undercity.
