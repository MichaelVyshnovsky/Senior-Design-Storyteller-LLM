'''Sleethur''' was a [[dark naga]] who laired under [[Myth Drannor]] in deep [[Elven Catacombs]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Personality==
Sleethur was an evil and conniving creature that preyed on the unwitting passersby.

==Abilities==
Sleethur was a highly capable spellcaster who was proficient in using the offensive magics, natural dark naga abilities, and the powers of the enchanted set of armor in their possession, ''[[Nezras's mysterious chainmail]]''.

==History==
In 1369 DR, Sleethur made their way into the deep levels of the Elven Catacombs, the areas controlled by the recently arrived [[drow]] of the [[House Freth]]. From there, the dark naga started preying one the creatures that resided or passed by the territory, that included the drow, [[Cult of the Dragon]] members, [[orc]]s, and other humanoids. Sleethur's strategy was to lure the creatures into a false sense of security, addressing them, and having friendly interactions. Once the unwitting prey relaxed, the naga used the ''mysterious chainmail'' to ''[[blink]]'' at a safe distance, and shower them with offensive magic, like ''[[fireball]]s''. Sleethur attacked the wrong prey in 1369 DR, the heroes from [[Phlan]] sent by [[Elminster Aumar]] to stop the Cult's activities in the ruins. Even though ambushed, the heroes persevered and killed the treacherous creature.
