        "mainbody": "Katyr Toralynnsyr was an copper elf ranger of the Elmanesse tribe in the Forest of Tethir in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.The AD&D Trading Card \"Katyr\" places him in the unknown \"Tethyr Wood\", but Lands of Intrigue Tethyr corrects this to the Forest of Tethir.\nKatyr dressed in green and earth-colored clothing. He had shoulder-length dark hair and light skin.\nHe was married to the fellow elven ranger Annelwin, who was a staunch defender of forest creatures.\nAlthough he was entirely mute, Katyr was able to communicate with his wife using a simple sign language, which she in turn translated for others.\nHe owned a magical cloak of elvenkind.\nIn addition to being a scout for the Elmanesse tribe, Katyr and Annelwin kept a vigil over the forests of northern Tethyr, keeping merchants safe and guiding lost travelers. He was said to silently appear out of a rain-soaked mist or the shadows of the trees to a stricken soul in their hour of need. They also thwarted poachers and others up to no good on the Trade Way north of Mosstone by 1370 DR."
