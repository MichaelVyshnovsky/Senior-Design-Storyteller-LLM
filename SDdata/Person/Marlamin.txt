Marlamin was a halfling inhabitant of Longsaddle in the Savage Frontier in the late 15 century DR.
With a bright and friendly manner, he had wavy brown hair and a short grey-peppered beard. He tended to wear a plain shirt, vest, and pants.
His hobbies included prettying up his cottage, working in the garden, writing a book, and learning to play the panpipes.

Marlamin was the husband of first Holga Kilgore, whom he divorced, and then Gwinn. He had loving relationships with them, but had not been able to bear the fear for Holgas safety and freedom. Generally, he appeared to have a particular attraction to barbarian human women.
Marlamin met and fell in love with Holga Kilgore, an Uthgardt human barbarian of the Elk tribe. However, because he was outsider, Holga was kicked out of her Elk tribe and shunned.
Once, while in the Greypeak Mountains, Holga stole what she thought was a mere walking stick from a wizard shed encountered and gifted it to Marlamin.
However, their marriage later fell apart. Holga could not let go of the pain of her banishment, for all of Marlamins efforts to make her a new home, and he was sick of fearing for her safety and whereabouts, given her life of crime, and often wept late into the night. Finally, he separated from her. Rootless in the world, Holga wandered for a while as she sought new bonds and eventually wound up in Targos in Icewind Dale, where she fell in with Edgin Darvis.
Later, Marlamin sent Holga a letter stating he was no longer her husband and formally their ending their marriage. Nevertheless, she still held feelings for Marlamin, considering him "one of the finest men in Faer√ªn". After she and Edgin escaped from Revels End prison in the late 1490s DR, she wanted to visit Marlamin for closure.
Meanwhile, Marlamin had met and married another barbarian woman, Gwinn. Theyd been together almost a year when Holga visited. Marlamin explained he preferred that Gwinn made an honest living, not thieving. They shared their reasons for their past struggles and separation. Accepting that Marlamin was happy with Gwinn, Holga departed, taking with her the old walking stick shed once given him and thinking he looked even better than she recalled. Later, the couple had a goose and pickleberries for dinner.
