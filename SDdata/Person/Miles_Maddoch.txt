'''Miles Maddoch''' was a leader of a group of patriots loyal to House [[Kendrick]] in [[Llandrain]] on the island of [[Snowdown]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|13}}

==Activities==
Miles was a blacksmith of [[Ffolk]] heritage. He despised his [[Amn]]ian and [[dwarf]] customers for their exploitation of Snowdown. Miles realized that patience was a virtue when dealing with these outsiders, and bided his time for the perfect time to strike for the High King.
