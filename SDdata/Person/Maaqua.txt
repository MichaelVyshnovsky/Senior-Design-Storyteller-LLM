'''Maaqua''' was the queen of the [[Razor Heart]] tribe of [[goblinoids]] in the [[Giantspire Mountains]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.
==Personality==
She was clever, diplomatic, and ambitious.
==Possessions==
Maaqua possessed one of the ''[[Crowns of Whispers]]'', which made her more charismatic, as well as the ''[[Greatsword of Impiltur]]'', a mighty and storied weapon. Both of these items had been left with her people by the [[demon lord]] [[Soneillon]] during the events of the [[Spellplague]] nearly a century prior.
==Activities==
Her machinations had earned her ties with the Kingdom of [[Damara]], which she leveraged in order to gain the right to levy "taxes" on travelers along the [[Long Road (Northeast Faer√ªn)|Long Road]] through the [[Giantspire Gap]].

She was also expansionistic, driving her Razor Hearts to absorb neighboring tribes within the Giantspires. She vied for control over the Giantspire Gap with the [[Blood Mountain]] clan, and clashed with the [[Black Wolf (tribe)|Black Wolf]] tribe of the southern Giantspires, whose cheiftan&mdash;[[Aruugan]]&mdash;possessed the other ''Crown of Whispers''.
