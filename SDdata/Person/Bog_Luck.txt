'''Bog Luck''' was a [[half-orc]] member of the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] under [[Severin Silrajin]], and the owner of the [[Carnath Roadhouse]] on the [[Sword Coast North]].

==History==
Bog Luck owned a roadhouse north of [[Waterdeep]] on a highly trafficked caravan road - the [[High Road]]. He used this position to smuggle the Cult's goods away from the caravans that stopped at his place. The delivered goods were shipped further by some [[lizardfolk]] via a tunnel.
