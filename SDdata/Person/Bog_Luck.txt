Bog Luck was a half-orc member of the reformed Cult of the Dragon under Severin Silrajin, and the owner of the Carnath Roadhouse on the Sword Coast North.
Bog Luck owned a roadhouse north of Waterdeep on a highly trafficked caravan road - the High Road. He used this position to smuggle the Cults goods away from the caravans that stopped at his place. The delivered goods were shipped further by some lizardfolk via a tunnel.
