Cathakay Shintar was a half-drow priestess and Queen of Dambrath during the 11 century DR.
Cathakay died without bearing a child, so the rulership of Dambrath passed to her niece, Melanith, upon her death.
Cathakay killed her mother, Filina Shintar after Filina had ruled for only 5 years. Cathakay ruled Dambrath for 54 years before dying in combat against a gold dragon.
