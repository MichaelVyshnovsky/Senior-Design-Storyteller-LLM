Harbormaster
Drauz the Dreg was an elven ship captain who lived in Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR.
Drauz had patchy whiskers.
Drauz had a ship that could be described as having a worn appearance.
According to dockworkers, Captain Drauz the Dreg used deceit and managed to assume the role of harbormaster of the Blacklake districts docks in Neverwinter. He was spotted flogging the dockworkers on multiple occasions, and there was a troubling incident where he took candy from a small child.
Circa , Drauz was "put in his place" by a carpenter who was since called a "hero" among local dockworkers. Drauz then left the town.
Nevertheless, in , his ship was docked at Pier 9 of the docks of the Blacklake district. By chance, he unexpectedly received several pleas from adventurers, among whom was the carpenter who had thrown a wrench in the captains lfve, to be ferried to Stormwreck Isle aboard his ship on the same day. Its unknown how exactly the carpenter ultimately got to the isle he may have saved Drauzs ship from a pirate, or he had simply stowed aboard the ship.
