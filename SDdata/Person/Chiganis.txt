Chiganis was one of the Blades of the Old Man in Sentinelspire.
Chiganis acted as one of the personal guards of Talieth, the Lady of Sentinelspire. Valmir, one of his fellow Blades, had a dislike for him.
At some point, Chiganis looked at one of his fellow Blades, Sauk, the wrong way, leading the half-orc to beat him nearly to death.
