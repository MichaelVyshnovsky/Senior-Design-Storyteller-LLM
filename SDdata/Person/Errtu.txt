'''Errtu''' ({{Pronounce|AYR|too|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}) was a powerful [[balor]]. He commanded his own layer of the [[Abyss]] and the [[tanar'ri]] inhabitants that resided there.

==Personality==
He had a particular interest in gaining power on and from the [[Prime Material Plane]], in particular [[Toril]].

==Combat==
He carried a [[vorpal]] sword that appeared as a bolt of lightning and was resistant to magic.

==History==
===Crenshinibon and Drizzt Do'Urden===
Errtu once worked for the group of [[lich]]es that created the [[artifact]] named [[Crenshinibon]]. When it was brought to "life," Errtu was cast back to the Abyss. He originally thought Crenshinibon was destroyed in the same blast. 

After he learned that Crenshinibon had not actually been destroyed, Errtu devoted his existence to finding Crenshinibon again. His search for Crenshinibon led him into several altercations with the [[drow]] [[ranger]] [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], who sought to keep the artifact out of Errtu's hands. The first time, when Errtu was serving as [[Akar Kessel]]'s general in [[Icewind Dale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1351}}, Drizzt summoned Errtu, meaning to pose as a drow scout and inquire about Crenshinibon. When Errtu discovered Drizzt's [[ivory]] [[unicorn]] pendant—the [[holy symbol]] of [[Mielikki]]—he attacked the drow, surrounding himself with flames and using his whip to catch Drizzt and pull him into the flames. Upon contact with Drizzt, the flames were extinguished by the magic of the as-yet unnamed [[scimitar]] ''[[Icingdeath]]''. In a confused moment for both of them, Drizzt slashed Errtu with ''Icingdeath'', causing the balor real pain and the blade's magic even froze the tissues at the edge of the wound. Errtu and Drizzt were both shocked, having never even heard of a weapon with such an effect, but Drizzt recovered first and stabbed the balor in the stomach. The scimitar's magic won out, destroying Errtu's material body and banishing him for a hundred years. As his body dissolved, Errtu reminded Drizzt of their long lifespans and promised revenge.

In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, after Drizzt's companion [[Wulfgar]] was "killed" by a [[yochlol]] summoned by [[Vierna Do'Urden]], the evil goddess [[Lolth]] gifted the [[barbarian]] to Errtu as a bargaining chip in exchange for his guardianship of [[Menzoberranzan]] during the [[Time of Troubles]]. While sending his demons to Menzoberranzan, Errtu assumed that the magical chaos caused by the Time of Trouble would possibly nullify his banishment only to be summarily rejected as he attempted to re-enter the Material Plane. 

During the siege of [[Mithral Hall]], Errtu observed [[Matron Mother]] [[Yvonnel Baenre]] hunting for Drizzt. Knowing he couldn't risk the drow renegade getting killed at Baenre's hands, Errtu passed a coffer containing a black sapphire capable of nullifying magic to a [[glabrezu]] being summoned by Yvonnel, coercing the [[tanar'ri]]'s cooperation with the promise of becoming his general. This resulted in the deaths of Yvonnel and her daughters, [[Bladen'Kerst Baenre|Bladen-Kerst]] and [[Quenthel Baenre|Quenthel]], who were heavily reliant on magic, at the hands of the Companions of the Hall.

Later on, Lolth upheld her end of the bargain and handed over Wulfgar to Errtu, having anticipated he would somehow ensure Drizzt's survival. She then offered him the chance to redeem himself in her eyes by observing the chaos in Menzoberranzan as a result of Yvonnel's demise. That same year, after the fall of [[House Oblodra]], the house's [[matron mother]], [[K'yorl Odran]], was also given to Errtu as a prisoner.

In the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, he set in motion a series of events to break his banishment. He sent a [[doppelganger]] to impersonate Captain [[Deudermont]] to direct Drizzt to [[Caerwich]]. Though [[Guenhwyvar]] exposed the doppelganger, the incident compelled Deudermont to direct the ''[[Sea Sprite]]'' to Caerwich anyway, where a hag relayed a riddle to the drow, implying that an old enemy was holding someone dear to him. When he eventually deduced his adversary to be Errtu, he assumed the prisoner to be his father [[Zaknafein Do'Urden|Zaknafein]]. Drizzt would later summon Errtu with the aid of [[Cadderly Bonaduce]], at which the balor declared that simply summoning him back to the Material Plane, he had broken his banishment, before Cadderly managed to send him back to the Abyss. Subsequently, the glabrezu, [[Bizmatec]], informed Errtu that he had tricked the [[wizard]], [[Dosemen]] of [[Sundabar]], into summoning him. Upon being summoned to Dosemen's quarters, Errtu used an [[Antimagic field|anti-magic]] stone he kept in a bag, a leftover from the Time of Troubles. This dispelled the summoner's protective ''[[magic circle against evil]]'', which was otherwise flawless, and likewise disabled Errtu's magical abilities. However, Errtu, being very strong physically, did not need them to kill the summoner. That year, the balor gained the artifact Crenshinibon and used it to build a stronghold in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]], a body of water west of Icewind Dale and dotted with icebergs. Despite his dislike of cold, Errtu chose the place because of its natural barriers. He opened a gate to the Abyss and let innumerable lesser fiends through, as well as more powerful demons. Drizzt and his friends managed to fight their way through, and confronted Errtu in an ice cave. This time, Errtu had space to fly, and repeatedly ''[[teleport]]ed'' around the room, using his flames to melt nearby ice and fill the floor with water—in which he would periodically thrust his lightning-bladed sword to shock the companions. Drizzt and his friends would have died, had Wulfgar not been inadvertently freed by a younger barbarian via the hammer ''[[Aegis-fang]]'' and joined the fight. Together, the companions managed to bring Errtu out of the air, where Drizzt struck with ''Icingdeath'' and banished him for the second time.

===Return to Icewind Dale===
In the {{YearlinkName|1466}}, Errtu appeared outside the walls of [[Bryn Shander]], seeking Drizzt. The drow warrior [[Tiago Baenre]] confronted him and banished him, making himself a hero to the inhabitants of the city. The spot where Errtu was slain was permanently blackened. On that spot, the citizens erected a statue of Tiago with the inscription, "On this spot did Master Tiago slay the demon. And the snows will cover it nevermore."

Although he had tortured her and considered her his toy, K'yorl Odran willingly schemed with Errtu a century later when Lolth plotted to use her as a way to weaken the barriers between the Abyss and the Prime Material Plane. In the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, Lolth incapacitated Errtu's rival, [[Balor (individual)|Balor]], as a favor to him. In exchange, Errtu allowed K'yorl to speak with [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]]. She provided him with an incantation to subliminally convey to [[Gromph Baenre]]. When Gromph cast the incantation, believing it to be the product of his genius, it weakened the walls of ''[[faerzress]]'', allowing demons such as [[Demogorgon]] to freely pass into Toril.

==Relationships==
Errtu was known to cooperate with other evil beings. In 1356 DR, he chose to ally himself with the wizard Akar Kessel on the promise that when Kessel died (which wouldn't be long in Errtu's view, even if Kessel died of old age), he would gain Crenshinibon. In 1358 DR, he became a reluctant ally of the drow goddess Lolth—at first because she could obliterate him if he didn't cooperate, and later because she offered him a chance to gain total, personal revenge on Drizzt.

Errtu was the greatest rival of Balor, the great demon for which the balor race was named.
