        "History": "In [[505 DR]], Aga settled in [[Kuroijo]] on [[Kuroi-joshima]] and from there terrorized the inhabitants of [[Miyama Province]], not wanting to rule but only to gain special privileges. At his whim, he sent destruction and death.\n\nFinally, in [[528 DR]], General [[Kinusake no Yori]], aided by the wu jen [[Omo]], attacked Aga. In a terrible battle against Aga's monstrous minions, they prevailed. However, Yori was killed by some [[goblin]]s and Aga's corpse was never found. Rumors said that he would return one day."
