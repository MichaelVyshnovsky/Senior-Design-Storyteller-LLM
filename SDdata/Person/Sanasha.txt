Sanasha was an apprentice wizard who served a Zhentarim necromancer in Athkatla during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Along with her comrade Prebek, Sanasha served the mad necromancer Xzar.
Sanasha adorned herself in a mage robe of cold resistance and was armed with a simple quarterstaff. She carried several spell scrolls on her person.
As of the , the trio were conducting experiments to create hideous little creatures that resembled goblins. Both young mages were jumpy and wary of intruders, apparently, at least on one occasion, Xzar sent intruders to Prebeks house in the Wave District as a test. Unbeknownst to the Zhents, they were being investigate by the Athkatlan Harpers under the leadership of Galvarey. Prebek, Sanasha, and their "creations" may have been ordered dead by Harper Rylock.
