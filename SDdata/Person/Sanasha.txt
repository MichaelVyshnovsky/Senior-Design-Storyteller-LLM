{{quote|''Errr... all right. Foul intruders! We shall stop you for our master!''|Sanasha}}

==Relationships==
Along with her comrade [[Prebek]], Sanasha served the mad necromancer [[Xzar]].

==Possessions==
Sanasha adorned herself in a ''[[mage robe of cold resistance]]'' and was armed with a simple [[quarterstaff]]. She carried several [[spell]] [[scroll]]s on her person.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the trio were conducting experiments to create hideous little creatures that resembled [[goblin]]s. Both young mages were jumpy and wary of intruders, apparently, at least on one occasion, Xzar sent intruders to Prebek's house in the [[Wave District]] as a test. Unbeknownst to the Zhents, they were being investigate by the Athkatlan [[Harpers]] under the leadership of [[Galvarey]]. Prebek, Sanasha, and their "creations" may have been ordered dead by Harper [[Rylock]].
