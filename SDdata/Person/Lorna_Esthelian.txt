Lorna Esthelian was a half-elven socialite from the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Lorna was a woman with a light skin tone, youthful features, long brown hair, and dark brown eyes.
In the , Lorna Esthelian was one of the targets for the vampire spawns under the control of Cazador Szarr, a powerful vampire from the Lower City of Baldurs Gate. She was seduced by one of the spawns and invited to attend an exclusive party at "the Palace" just the night before during a diner date at the Blushing Maiden Inn. Lorna found it a bit suspicious her date ate nothing during dinner and brought in his own "wine," thick and metallic-smelling. She was to meet her consort in the sewers of Baldurs Gate near a secret door that opened into the Szarr Palaces undercellars. Luckily, the spawn never showed up, leaving Lorna unable to attend the party. All of the partys guests were brutally torn to shreds by Cazador Szarrs beast and werewolf thralls.
