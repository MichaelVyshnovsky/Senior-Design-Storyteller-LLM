{{quote|''My date's supposed to meet me here, but there's no sign of him. You haven't seen him, have you? Pale, skinny - extremely piercing eyes.''|Lorna Esthelian}}

==Description==
Lorna was a woman with a light skin tone, youthful features, long brown hair, and dark brown eyes.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lorna Esthelian was one of the targets for the [[vampire spawn]]s under the control of [[Cazador Szarr]], a powerful [[vampire]] from the [[Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate. She was seduced by one of the spawns and invited to attend an exclusive party at [[Szarr Palace|"the Palace"]] just the night before during a diner date at the [[Blushing Maiden Inn]]. Lorna found it a bit suspicious her date ate nothing during dinner and brought in his own "[[wine]]," thick and metallic-smelling. She was to meet her consort in the [[sewers of Baldur's Gate]] near a secret door that opened into the Szarr Palace's undercellars. Luckily, the spawn never showed up, leaving Lorna unable to attend the party. All of the party's guests were brutally torn to shreds by Cazador Szarr's beast and [[werewolf]] thralls.
