Sandesyl Morgia was a vampire and member of the Cult of the Dragon as of the late 15 century DR.
She was a true believer of the "true path" as taught by Sammaster, the founder of the Cult of the Dragon and former chosen of the goddess Mystra.
For a time, Sandesyl dwelled within Skyreach Castle, a floating fortress owned by a cloud giant allied with the cult. During the night she patrolled its perimeter, and during the day rested within a coffin set inside one of the castles crumbling towers.
Sandesyl had two moon elf, vampire spawn consorts that accompanied her during her time in Skyreach Castle.
During the 1480s DR, a new faction within the Cult of the Dragon emerged. Led by the mage Severin Silrajin, these cultists switched their devotion from dracoliches to living dragons. Sandesyl considered this a blasphemy against the teachings of Sammaster.
For a time, Sandesyl was forced to work alongside the new sect at Skyreach Castle in the Greypeak Mountains.
Sandesyl acted out against the new sect of Dragon Cultists. When the armies of the Five Factions marched upon the Well of Dragons to stop Severin and his allies from completing their ritual to summon Tiamat to the Realms. Sandesyl worked on the fringes of the Well of Dragons and sabotaged the cults efforts to magically create drakes by using the remains of dead dragons. She allied herself with an adventurer from Neverwinter to disrupt the cults alchemical-based rituals and helped slay their master alchemist.
