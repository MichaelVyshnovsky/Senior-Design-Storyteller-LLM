{{Quote|Then you must have slain the Master Alchemist! How I wish I'd been there myself to slake my thirst on his blood! The Cult of the Dragon will initiate another in the secrets of draconic alchemy, but for now they must suffer this defeat!|Sandesyl Morgia, to the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]].

==Personality==
She was a true believer of the "true path" as taught by [[Sammaster]], the founder of the Cult of the Dragon and former [[chosen]] of the goddess [[Mystra]].

==Activities==
For a time, Sandesyl dwelled within [[Skyreach Castle]], a floating fortress owned by a [[cloud giant]] allied with the cult. During the night she patrolled its perimeter, and during the day rested within a coffin set inside one of the castle's crumbling towers.

==Relationships==
Sandesyl had two moon elf, [[vampire spawn]] consorts that accompanied her during her time in Skyreach Castle.

==History==
During the 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} a new faction within the Cult of the Dragon emerged. Led by the mage [[Severin Silrajin]], these cultists switched their devotion from [[dracolich]]es to living [[dragon]]s. Sandesyl considered this a blasphemy against the teachings of Sammaster.

For a time, Sandesyl was forced to work alongside the new sect at [[Skyreach Castle]] in the [[Greypeak Mountains]].

Sandesyl acted out against the new sect of Dragon Cultists. When the armies of the [[Five Factions]] marched upon the [[Well of Dragons]] to stop Severin and his allies from completing their ritual to summon [[Tiamat]] to the Realms.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 9}} Sandesyl worked on the fringes of the Well of Dragons and sabotaged the cult's efforts to magically create [[drake]]s by using the remains of dead dragons. She allied herself with an [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|adventurer from Neverwinter]] to disrupt the cult's alchemical-based rituals and helped slay their master alchemist.
