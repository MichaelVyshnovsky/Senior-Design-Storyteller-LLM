        "mainbody": "Nala, formerly a member of Clan Yrjixtilex, was a dragonborn priestess of Tiamat and Skuthosiins lovak (head servant in the xorvintaal game), who posed as a cleric of Bahamut in order to infiltrate and corrupt the Platinum Cadre. Due to her faith in a dragon god, Nala was a thrikominaki (clanless dragonborn).\nNala had brown scales speckled with gold, and scars were she once wore her clans piercings. Unlike most female dragonborn, Nala had a lithe body.\nNala was able to breathe fire. Thanks to her connection with Tiamat, she was able to maker her breath more powerful and could use it more often than normal dragonborn.\nShe was the lover of Patrin, the leader of the order.\nDue to her faith in a dragon god, Nala had been casted out of her clan.\nIn 1479 DR, she was part of the group of members of the Platinum Cadre that went to the Black Ash Plain to exterminate as many ash giants as they could.\nNala initiated new members of the order into the mysteries of Tiamat, all the while claiming that it was really Bahamuts power she was channeling. Because the dragonborn were unfamiliar with the gods of Toril, they did not realize Nala was calling on Tiamats power rather than Bahamuts. \nThe Platinum Cadre was part of Vanquisher Tarhuns joint military operation against the giants. Although Nala didnt wanted them to attack at the same time the other thymari military forces did it, because she was using magic to hinder the military effort, Balasar was able to convince his \"brothers-in-arms\" to join the fray, to her annoyment. Nala later joined forces with Balasar, Medrash and Patrin in order to save Tarhuns life.\nSuspicious of Nala, Balasar infiltrated the Platinum Cadre and discovered she was a worshiper of Tiamat. Nala fled to the Black Ash Plain when her secret was revealed and joined Skuthosiins army. She was killed by Balasar during the siege of Ashhold."
