        "History": "Natrisse was a priestess of [[Lathander]], who worked along [[Merring|Brother Merring]], before he went to [[West Harbor]].",
        "Gameplay": "The [[Kalach-Cha]] and the companions could obtain a quest from Natrisse to bring Brother Merring a tithe box. Natrisse would warn them not to open the box, else they'd feel the wrath of Lathander. If they did, the box was destroyed as well.\n\nNote that unlike most merchants she is affected by friendly spells and bard songs. (her Appraise skill can get buffed if she is within spell range, raising her prices)"
