        "mainbody": "orik the Undying, known as Morik Stormhand in life, was a vengeful lich and ally of the High Priestess of Lolth who was plotting Waterdeeps downfall in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nMorik the Undying had some history with the worshipers of Clangeddin Silverbeard, which turned into seething hate in his undead state.\nThe lich called his undead servants his children, and valued them above his drow allies. He was planning on betraying Azurna eventually.\nIn the , Morik Stormhand allied himself with Azurna, a High Priestess and a Matron Mother who led the drow forces on a holy quest to retrieve the Flame Sword of Lolth and use it to bring the City of Splendors to its knees. This quest led Azurna to a confrontation with the dwarves of Clangeddins Hearth. The dwarves attempted to flush the drow and their servant kobolds out of Undermountains sewers, which infuriated the Matron Mother. She led an assault on Clangeddins Hearth, slaughtering every single dwarf within the temple. As a final insult, she gifted the temple and all the fallen people within to Morik the Undying in exchange for him finding a piece of the spider statue hidden in the temple. The lich accepted and raised the dead dwarves as his undead servants. Subsequently, an agent of Khelben Arunsun arrived to investigate the disappearance of the dwarven colony and confronted the undead horrors, slaying the lich in the  process.\nMoriks phylactery was nowhere to be seen, likely allowing the lich to return to plague Clangeddins devotees further."
