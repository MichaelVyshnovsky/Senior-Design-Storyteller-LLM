        "mainbody": "'''Morik the Undying''', known as '''Morik Stormhand''' in life, was a vengeful [[lich]] and ally of the High Priestess of [[Lolth]] who was plotting [[Waterdeep]]'s downfall in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Clangeddin loved death and battle, and I've certainly brought both to his domain. Perhaps, in an odd way, I am doing him an honor. What a joke! The most foolish of a pantheon of dotards.''|Morik the Undying}}",
        "Relationships": "Morik the Undying had some history with the worshipers of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], which turned into seething hate in his [[undead]] state.\n\nThe lich called his undead servants his children, and valued them above his drow allies. He was planning on betraying [[Azurna]] eventually.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Morik Stormhand allied himself with Azurna, a High Priestess and a Matron Mother who led the [[drow]] forces on a holy quest to retrieve the ''[[Flame Sword of Lolth]]'' and use it to bring the City of Splendors to its knees. This quest led Azurna to a confrontation with the [[dwarves]] of [[Clangeddin's Hearth]]. The dwarves attempted to flush the drow and their servant [[kobold]]s out of Undermountain's sewers, which infuriated the Matron Mother. She led an assault on Clangeddin's Hearth, slaughtering every single dwarf within the temple. As a final insult, she gifted the temple and all the fallen people within to Morik the Undying in exchange for him finding a piece of the ''spider statue'' hidden in the temple. The lich accepted and raised the dead dwarves as his undead servants. Subsequently, an agent of [[Khelben Arunsun]] arrived to investigate the disappearance of the dwarven colony and confronted the undead horrors, slaying the lich in the  process.\n\nMorik's ''[[phylactery]]'' was nowhere to be seen, likely allowing the lich to return to plague Clangeddin's devotees further."
