'''Purvis''' was a [[human]] gravedigger from the town of [[Lonelywood]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Purvis was a light-skinned man with one eye covered by an eyepatch. He wore black [[rogue]]'s garb and spent hours meditating in his lodgings while sitting cross-legged.

==Possessions==
Despite his stunted speech and inability to understand much, Purvis owned quite a collection of curios. He carried a ''[[potion of extra-healing]]'', a ''[[short sword of backstabbing]]'', ''[[Edventar's Gift]]'', ''[[Whispers of Silence]]'', a precious [[pearl]], a fine vintage bottle of [[Marsember Blush]] [[wine]], and a pair of ''[[Worn Whispers]]''.

==History==
Seemingly a simple-minded man, Purvis arrived in the town of Lonelywood in the {{YearlinkName|1281}} and took ownership of a simple shack at the edge of town. His humble vocation was digging holes for the town's dead. He greeted strangers with a simple "You needs a hole?" Purvis was proud of his work, bragging of how deep his holes were so the town didn't stank of the decay. In reality, Purvis was an [[assassin]] who put up a masterful charade, even allowing the local hellion child – [[Hailee Dunn]], to bombard him with briarcones. He arrived to Lonelywood only two weeks before the [[Heroes of Icewind Dale]] arrived, summoned to aid against the [[barbarian]] army of [[Wylfdene]]'s.

The assassin's benefactor was none other than Speaker [[Baldemar Thurlow]], who hired Purvis, through the Council Representative of [[Targos]], to assassinate the barbarian leader. The townies were told that the mysterious one-eyed man whom they saw visit Baldemar was just a representative from the ten Towns. When the word of the assassin got out, the barbarian camp doubled the guard, making Wylfdene unreachable. As the adventurers investigated the threat, Wylfdene's true identity was revealed, and the risen barbarian was put to rest once more. Unwilling to gain the reputation of a failure, Purvis assassinated Speaker Thurlow, wife [[Arden Thurlow]], and just needed to finish off the last witnesses of his failure – the Heroes of Icewind Dale. It was unknown if the confrontation had taken place, but if it did, Purvis's life would've been forethought.
