        "History": "At some point, Hendak was captured by slavers and taken to the city of [[Athkatla]]. He was forced to fight as a gladiator in the fighting pits hidden away in the slums behind the [[Copper Coronet]] inn. \n\nHendak endured his imprisonment and forced combat for years, at least until the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. He did his best to keep the other slaves alive and boost their spirits, to limited success. Hendak wanted nothing more than to enact vengeance upon the Coronet's owner [[Lehtinan]] and free the others who were enslaved."
