Balineth Skroun, was a Zulkir of Conjuration sometime circa late 1300 DR.
This unfriendly and toad-faced human man liked to use intimidation to achieve his goals. He unnerved his rivals and underlings alike with magic prepared tricks. Despite his demeanor, Balineth loved Thay and was loyal to his fellow zulkirs. However he never showed it.
Balineth Skroun took the title of the Zullkir of Abjuration sometime before the late . His name was among several zulkir names that became widely known after being named and described in the book called Twelve Winters Under the Lash, penned by an anonymous slave and smuggled out of Thay sometime in late 1300 DR. After years spent as a zulkir, Balineth became one of the most trusted members of the Council for being a team player and acted to better Thay.
