She beseeched the angel, who unbeknownst to her had fallen from grace, for the power to enact revenge on Hoondarrh for destroying her home village on [[Norland]]. Rayonde found Helene and the two traveled back to a ship captained by Aiden, docked at [[Caer Moray]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|8-12}} \n\nIn short time the group was beckoned to assist the village of [[Dynnegall]] with marauding members of the [[Black Blood tribe]], and Rayonde and Helene went together to the nearby [[moonwell]] to save the townsfolk that were being sacrificed by [[Mala]]-worshiping [[lycanthrope]]s. Helene used the power of the moonwell to call forth dark powers to defeat the Black Bloods, unwittingly offering up Rayonde as a sacrifice to the corrupted Zariel and her new [[Fiend patron|patron]], the [[archdevil]] [[Asmodeus]].
