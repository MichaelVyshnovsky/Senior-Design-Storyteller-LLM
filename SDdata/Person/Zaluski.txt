Zaluski was a fishmonger in Daggerford around 1370 DR.
Zaluski was a fishmonger west of Mirabar but was forced to abandon the area because of the growing pressure from Luskan. She resettled in Daggerford where she married and later gave birth to three children.
She lived in a house in the south section of Daggerford on Wall Street and Kaoth Alley near the barracks.
