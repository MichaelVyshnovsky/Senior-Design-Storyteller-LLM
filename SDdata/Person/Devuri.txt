'''Devuri''' was a [[Crab hengeyokai|crayfish hengeyokai]] [[shukenja]] and priest of the [[Lords of Creation]] in the town of [[Kataburi]] in the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was previously an adventurer.

==Activities==
''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], Devuri led the town's temple to a local river spirit, who was believed to bless Kataburi with its [[giant crayfish]]. He had many contacts with fellow water-dwelling creatures of the river.

Some, such as the old nun [[Ama]], didn't like that Devuri was employed as a priest and thought he wasted too much of his time in the river, but this was likely prejudice.
