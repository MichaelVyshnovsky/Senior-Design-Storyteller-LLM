Gallowshawk, known by all as Slop, was an innkeeper in Skullport.
Gallowshawk was, in 1355 DR, a lowly scullery cook on board a ship that had arrived in Skullport when the boat was shipwrecked and he was miraculously the only survivor. Not only that, but Gallowshawk also managed also to recover some of the captains treasure.
With the money, Slop opened a restaurant/inn, but by 1360 DR he had lost most of his money in bad investments.
Around 1370 DR, his was one of the worst restaurant/inns in the city.
