'''Gallowshawk''', known by all as '''Slop''', was an innkeeper in [[Skullport]].

==History==
Gallowshawk was, in [[1355 DR]], a lowly scullery cook on board a ship that had arrived in Skullport when the boat was shipwrecked and he was miraculously the only survivor. Not only that, but Gallowshawk also managed also to recover some of the captain's treasure.

With the money, Slop opened a restaurant/inn, but by [[1360 DR]] he had lost most of his money in bad investments.

Around [[1370 DR]], his was one of the worst restaurant/inns in the city.
