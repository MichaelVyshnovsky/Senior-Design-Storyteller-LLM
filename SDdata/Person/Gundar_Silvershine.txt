Gundar Silvershine was an outlander living in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Gundar owned and operated Abas for All. He possessed the weaving skill to accurately depict dragons and wyverns on cloth which was a rare talent in Golden Huzuz. Much of the court found these creature bizarre, so he kept plenty of common abas for sale as well.
Since coming to the Land of Fate, Gundar became Enlightened, following the teachings of Jauhar.
Originally from a distant land called Cormyr, Gundar served a barbarian king named Azoun. His greed got the better of him and Gundar was forced to flee his homeland when he was caught stealing from the crown.
