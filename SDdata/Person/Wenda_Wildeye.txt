'''Wenda Wildeye''' was an infamous bandit and [[bloodforge]] mage operating out of the [[Serpent Valley]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

Wenda Wildeye used the Serpent Valley as a hideout and mustering area. While preparing for another raid, the leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] came to put an end to the banditry.
