Guerik was an orc zombie in  SildÃ«yuir in 1372 DR.
Guerik was an orc mercenary captain. He was recruited by the nilshai sorcerer Tolgbyri to conquer the Night Realm from Mourel Duskwalker. He became the second-in-command of the mercenary army after Savera took control of the group, killing Tolgbyri. However, continued exposure to the Night Realms energies drove Guerik mad and he fled from the mercenary camp.
He decided to go alone to fight Mourel but was defeated and transformed into a zombie guarding the entrance point to the Night Realm.
