        "mainbody": "'''Baeron Silmaeril''' was one of the original [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. Along with [[Shilarn]], he overthrew the Lords Magister [[Ehlemm Zoar]] and [[Lhorar Gildeggh]] to restore the government of Waterdeep.",
        "Relationships": "Baeron married [[Shilarn Silmaeril|Shilarn]], also a Lord of Waterdeep. They had a daughter, [[Lhestyn]] the Masked Lady, who later became an [[Lords of Waterdeep#Open Lord|Open Lord]] of Waterdeep.\n\nBaeron was friends with King [[Jaszur]] of [[Tethyr]]. \n\nLord Baeron was served by the general, [[Delver Kinlake]], for 30 years. As a token of his appreciation for his loyalty, Baeron bestowed upon Delver a fine [[Delver's plate|suit of armor]].",
        "Background": "After the [[Council of Guildmasters]] seized power in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1256 DR]], most of the Lords of Waterdeep were eliminated because their identities, which were supposed to have remained secret, had been compromised. Only Baeron and [[Shilarn]] are known to have survived this purge. In [[1273 DR]], they both entered the court of the Lords Magister [[Ehlemm Zoar]] and [[Lhorar Gildeggh]], who were in power in the city at the time, and demanded that they leave the city. When they refused, Shilarn struck them down and killed them using her magic. Baeron revealed his identity, restoring the original form of government and becoming the Open Lord.\n\nIn [[1302 DR]], Lady Lhestyn and her husband, [[Zelphar Arunsun]], had a child, Baeron's grandson, [[Khelben Arunsun the Younger|Khelben the Younger]].\n\nBaeron died of fever in [[1308 DR]]. His wife, Shilarn, killed herself by jumping onto his funeral pyre.",
