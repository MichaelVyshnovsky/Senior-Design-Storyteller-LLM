Beauty. music, nature— those things are sources of great comfort to me. They help me to forget, as much as I can forget what I am.

        "Description": "Jander was {{SI|5'9|ft-in|long=yes}} tall<ref group=\"note\">In ''[[Children of the Night: Vampires]]'', he was described as being {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall. and weighed {{SI|130|lb|k|long=yes}}. He had angular features but retained the noble countenance of an [[elf]]. Jander kept his wheat-colored hair long enough to reach his shoulder blades and it almost hid his ears. His skin was the color of pale gold and he had expressive silver eyes. His left hand was withered and appeared burnt after contact with the ''[[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]]''.\n\nHe would go about in public disguised as a leprous beggar in filthy cloaks, coating himself in stinking garbage to keep people away. He always wore gloves, both to hide his disfigured hand and so that his bare flesh would not touch plant life.",
        "Personality": "Jander had a unquenching hatred for all types vampires including himself. After Jander's defeat with [[Strahd von Zarovich]] in [[Castle Ravenloft]] he swore to destroy all vampire kind.",

While in Castle Ravenloft, Jander was made a indigo tunic by [[Cristina]] the seamstress of Strahd. The fine clothes included a cotton shirt, indigo tunic embroidered with golden thread, clean white [[boots]], and multiple pairs of white gloves.",

        "History": {
            "Early Life in Faerûn": "Jander Sunstar was born to gold elf parents on the island of Evermeet. He was struck by wanderlust and headed to mainland [[Faerûn]] in search of adventure. He became a Hellrider out of Elturel and became friends with another Hellrider, Gideon who became a cleric of Ilmater from his experiences of fighting Tiamat in the hells.<ref>Christie Golden (September 1991). ''Vampire of the Mists''. (TSR, Inc). pp. 157. ISBN 1-56076-155-5. They eventually became two members of the Silver Six and slew a red dragon in Merrydale. Whilst in [[Merrydale]], the original pack of [[vampire]]s that infested the area for years to come attacked. Jander was betrayed by a friend who had been transformed in the first battle between the Dalesmen and the vampires.\n\nNow a vampire himself, Jander was bound to the will of his new master, [[Cassiar]], for over a century, but never surrendered his soul to his master's evil ways. He tried to survive on animals instead of [[human]]s but Cassiar's orders caused him to perform many evil deeds. Eventually, he managed to kill Cassiar in [[Mistledale]] in the middle of [[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|892}} with the help of his friend [[Rhynn Oriandis]].\n\nHe wandered Mistledale for a while, preying on bandits asleep in the wilderness but not killing them, just drinking a little from each in their group. One night though, the group he was following were alerted to his presence and he had to flee. When he stopped, he encountered the goddess [[Eldath]], who offered him sanctuary in a holy grove of [[Silvanus]]. For as long as he didn't leave the grove, he would be a mortal elf again, though sunlight would still be deadly. He met a priest of Silvanus from a nearby abbey, coming to draw water from the sacred pool and the two became friends. The next night, wood and antlers were on the ground and, seeing it as a sign, Jander whittled them into statuettes of Eldath and other shapes, which he gave to the priest for his abbey to sell. Jander was extremely happy with this life until one night when he saw that the abbey was on fire. His new friend struggled to the grove saying that they were under attack but Jander should stay in the grove lest his divine absolution be revoked. Jander couldn't stand the sight of thugs beating his friend and left the grove, using his returned powers to slaughter them and saving the lives of many of the abbey's residents. But when he tried to return to the grove, he found that he could not—a painful, invisible barrier prevented him from returning and he doubted Eldath would offer him succor twice.",
            "Journey to Barovia": "Jander left the [[Dalelands]] and his memories behind that night, heading for [[Waterdeep]]. He settled outside of the city and when feeding on animals wasn't enough he fed on inmates at an insane asylum. He fell passionately in love with one of them though, a beautiful [[human]] woman named [[Tatyana|Anna]], cursed to never age or be free of her madness. Anna fell deathly ill with fever in the {{YearlinkName|1098}} and Jander offered to turn her into a vampire to save her but she refused. She died in his arms and in his rage and grief he slaughtered the other asylum inhabitants, setting the building on fire, and swore revenge on whatever caused Anna's madness.\n\nThe Dark Powers of the [[Demiplane of Dread]] heard his plea and whisked him away to their awful realm. Almost immediately, he came into contact and conflict with Count [[Strahd von Zarovich]] of [[Barovia]]. He learned that Anna was once known in Barovia as Tatyana and was the lover of Strahd's brother [[Sergei von Zarovich|Sergei]]. Strahd murdered his brother and drove Tatyana to madness in his attempts to make her his. She threw herself into the ever-present Mists of the plane and an aspect of Tatyana arrived in Waterdeep, where she was committed and met Jander.\n\nTwenty-five years later, Jander and Strahd were bitter enemies—knowing he had found the object of his revenge, Jander came to hate the darklord of Barovia with all his heart. With the aid of two brave villagers, a priest named Sasha and a rogue named Leisl, he attacked Strahd, even offering [[Lathander]] his life in exchange for victory though both vampires survived the confrontation, severely wounded. Jander believed himself to be dying and asked his friends to let him see the sun rise one last time.\n\nCertain Faerûnian sages claimed that the Mists of the realm blocked the sun's glare from destroying Jander and he awoke in the area of the Demiplane known as [[Forlorn]]. He later became a vampire hunter by trade, sharing the hatred he still had for Strahd to all of his unwanted kin and if he ever returned to [[Toril]], he would likely perform exactly the same service.",
            "The Hellriders": "[[File:Jander-5e.jpg|thumb|300px|''Jander imprisoned and tortured in Avernus.'']]\nLater, Jander returned to Toril and rejoined the [[Hellriders]] as a volunteer. He then participated in the invasion of [[Avernus]] known as [[the Ride (battle)|the Ride]], led by then-[[angel]] [[Zariel]] in the {{YearlinkName|1354}}. The horrors of the plane, however, were too much for Jander and many of the Hellriders, who, in a blind panic, deserted and fled back through the portal to [[Elturel]], sealing it shut behind them. The loss of her army sealed Zariel's fate, enabling her capture and later transformation into an [[archdevil]].\n\nAfter spending years filled with shame and agony for his decision, Jander once again decided to end his existence by facing the [[The sun|sun]], pleading for [[Lathander]]'s mercy. However, he was again denied release and was instead condemned to become a prisoner back in Avernus, there to be held captive by [[Haruman]], one of only two generals who had never left Zariel's side and had been later turned into a [[narzugon]]. Jander was crucified and impaled on an iron tree at [[Haruman's Hill]], while his body was kept functioning by the work of [[stirge]]s that injected him with the blood of other companions who had met the same fate.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} Jander pleaded with any passersby to cut him down and release him from his torment, so his cursed soul might move on elsewhere.\n\nHowever, this was probably a clone, as a machine split Jander into multiple copies and scattered them across the multiverse, with one still dwelling in the Domains of Dread.<ref>"
