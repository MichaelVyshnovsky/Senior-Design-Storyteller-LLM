'''Alberik''' was the captain of the guards at the path leading to [[Adama's Tooth]], posted by the [[Datharathi]] to protect the access to their mine. In {{yearlink|1374}}, he allowed [[Eined Datharathi]] into the mine despite being under standing orders not to let anyone in, as he had not been notified her family wanted her captured. Alongside her, he allowed in [[Ususi Manaallin]] and [[Iahn Qoyllor]]. The man had been a part to the indiscretions of the Datharathi heiress around the year {{yearlink|1369}}, which made it more likely for him to take her statements at face value.{{cite book/Darkvision|193-194|13}}
