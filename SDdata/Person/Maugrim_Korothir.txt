'''Maugrim Korothir''' was [[Morag]]'s second in command.

==History==
Maugrim unleashed the [[Wailing Death]] upon [[Neverwinter]] and, being one of Morag's elites, was the mastermind of the attack on Neverwinter. He was defeated shortly after he performed a ritual to bring his mistress Morag out of her magical stasis. This resulted in his banishment to [[Cania]].
