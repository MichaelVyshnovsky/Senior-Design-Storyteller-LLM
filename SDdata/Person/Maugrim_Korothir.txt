Maugrim Korothir was Morags second in command.
Maugrim unleashed the Wailing Death upon Neverwinter and, being one of Morags elites, was the mastermind of the attack on Neverwinter. He was defeated shortly after he performed a ritual to bring his mistress Morag out of her magical stasis. This resulted in his banishment to Cania.
