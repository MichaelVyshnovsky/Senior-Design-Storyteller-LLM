        "Activities": "He was a guard in [[Castle Obarskyr]].",
        "History": "When [[Rorskryn Mreldrake]] fled Castle Obarskyr through a ''portal'' to [[Marsember]], transformed into a woman, he was spotted at the portal by the [[War Wizard]] [[Ellard Gauntur]], who'd been deployed to capture him. Ellard figured out that was Mreldrake transformed from a stain on his clothes, and pursued.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|51-52|6}}\n\nTwo sentries stayed on the Marsember side of the portal so that Mreldrake could not return easily: [[Berent Thallowood]] and Mandron Saldar. While the two sentries speculated, the [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]] sent after them the [[death knight]] [[Targrael]]; she quickly slew Berent without him even noticing, and then took out Mandron Saldar shortly after. The man confirmed to her that he was Saldar, and she'd killed Thallowood moments prior."
