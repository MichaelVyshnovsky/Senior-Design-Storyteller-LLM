Only Kivan made it out alive, swearing revenge against Tazok when all was said and done.\nTazok was an instrumental figure of the iron crisis that plagued the Sword Coast in the . He coordinated the efforts of the Chill and Blacktalons banditry efforts while guiding their leaders Ardenor Crush and Taurgosz Khosann to believe they were in fact working for the Zhentarim rather than the Iron Throne.\nBy means of his subordinate Tranzig, he also supervised the sabotage of the iron mine of Nashkel. He made periodic visits to the Cloak Wood to see his superior Davaeorn.\nLater that year, Tazok stood by Sarevoks side when the Bhaalspawn made his last stand against his half-brother Abdel Adrian.\nTazok somehow survived that encounter and later traveled south to Amn. the  Tazok had resettled in the Windspear Hills region of Amn."
