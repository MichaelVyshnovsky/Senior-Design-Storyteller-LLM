Only Kivan made it out alive, swearing revenge against Tazok when all was said and done.\n\nTazok was an instrumental figure of the [[iron crisis]] that plagued the [[Sword Coast]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. He coordinated the efforts of the [[Chill]] and [[Blacktalons]] banditry efforts while guiding their leaders [[Ardenor Crush]] and [[Taurgosz Khosann]] to believe they were in fact working for the [[Zhentarim]] rather than the Iron Throne.\n\nBy means of his subordinate [[Tranzig]], he also supervised the sabotage of the [[iron]] mine of [[Nashkel]]. He made periodic visits to the [[Cloak Wood]] to see his superior [[Davaeorn]].\n\nLater that year, Tazok stood by Sarevok's side when the [[Bhaalspawn]] made his last stand against his half-brother [[Abdel Adrian]].\n\nTazok somehow survived that encounter and later traveled south to [[Amn]]. the {{YearlinkName|1369}} Tazok had resettled in the [[Windspear Hills]] region of [[Amn]]."
