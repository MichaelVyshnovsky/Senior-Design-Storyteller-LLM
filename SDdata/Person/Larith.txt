'''Larith''' was an assistant to [[Nadron Ilanis]] as of {{yearlink|1356}}.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|70}}

==History==
Larith was a dedicated servant, together with [[Baris]], and did not involve himself with politics or gossip in the camp. They spent about three quarters of their time in their quarters; half of the time Nadron was in the room, the two of them would be there too.
