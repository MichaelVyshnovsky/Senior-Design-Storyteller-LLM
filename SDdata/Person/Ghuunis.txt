Ghunnis was quite hardheaded and unforgiving, and her beliefs and feelings were always extreme, either seeing everything as growing great or else a disaster in the making unless she and Kharal acted. She did not like [[Myth Nantar]]'s ''[[mythal]]'' for its unnatural effects on ocean environment, but could accept it because Myth Nantar was a beacon of tolerance. She also despised [[slavery]], and further viewed the kuo-toan slavers in terms of predators overhunting an area, and so it was her duty to eradicate them.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, there was new of [[kuo-toa]] slavers active in the nearby area so Ghuunis and Kharal went to deal with the problem, tracking them by scent, responses from friendly animals, and reports of missing persons near caves on the plateau. While sneaking inside the kuo-toas' cavern, they might've met some surface-dweller [[adventurer]]s also investigating them. The locathah would be suspicious that they'd give their position away, but could work with them.

==Possessions==
She owned a ''[[charm of safety]]'' that repelled [[shark]]s.
