Ghuunis was a locathah druid of the Tiger Coral tribe on the Hmur Plateau in Ser√¥s in the Sea of Fallen Stars in the late 14 century DR.
She was the mate of Kharal.
Ghunnis was quite hardheaded and unforgiving, and her beliefs and feelings were always extreme, either seeing everything as growing great or else a disaster in the making unless she and Kharal acted. She did not like Myth Nantars mythal for its unnatural effects on ocean environment, but could accept it because Myth Nantar was a beacon of tolerance. She also despised slavery, and further viewed the kuo-toan slavers in terms of predators overhunting an area, and so it was her duty to eradicate them.
In the , there was new of kuo-toa slavers active in the nearby area so Ghuunis and Kharal went to deal with the problem, tracking them by scent, responses from friendly animals, and reports of missing persons near caves on the plateau. While sneaking inside the kuo-toas cavern, they mightve met some surface-dweller adventurers also investigating them. The locathah would be suspicious that theyd give their position away, but could work with them.
She owned a charm of safety that repelled sharks.
