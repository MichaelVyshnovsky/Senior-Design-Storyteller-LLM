        "mainbody": "phril was a seer and an inmate of the Spellhold asylum in 1369 DR.\nThe wizard was kept in Spellhold, the Residence for the Magically Deviant, for her sage-like abilities. Experimenting with planar travel gave her awareness of sights beyond the known world. Aphril was driven mad by her ability to stare through and across the planes, as well as at their denizens.Aphril makes comments about happenings of these otherwordly planes and places that are clearly references to other Dungeons & Dragons video games, such as Neverwinter Nights and Planescape Torment. For Neverwinter Nights, she commented \"I see... a place... coming soon... where there is... never winter... where people have control... over their own stories.\" For Planescape Torment, which was set in the center of the multiverse, Sigil, the seer commented \"I see... a city of changing streets under the Lady of Pain. My eyes... pluck out my eyes.\", a reference to the ruler of Sigil. She also made a comment about the Nameless One, the games protagonist \"I see... a walking corpse... he speaks... to a pillar of skulls? See, it is madness!\"\nShe did not sleep much, and would apparently be studied so that some good may come of her condition. Her eyes did \"not close when closed\", so she was never truly alone, always surrounded by mysterious places and creatures.\nIn 1369 DR, Aphril was amongst the inmates at Spellhold when it was taken over by Jon Irenicus. When Gorions Ward arrived seeking Imoen, despite Aphrils initial caution, she was goaded into battling the evil elven archmage to avenge the torments she had suffered under his hands. Unfortunately, like the rest of the inmates, she evidently perished."
