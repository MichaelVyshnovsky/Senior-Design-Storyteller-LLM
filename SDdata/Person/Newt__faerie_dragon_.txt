'''Newt''' was a [[faerie dragon]] who lived in [[Myrloch Vale]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite digital book/Darkwalker on Moonshae|2095}}

==Description==
Newt's hide was orange and his body measured {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} in length, longer than the average faerie dragon.

==History==
Newt made the acquaintance of [[Tristan Kendrick]] when the prince and his companions were on a mission to rescue [[Keren Donnell]].{{Cite digital book/Darkwalker on Moonshae|2653}} A few days later, Newt found [[Kamerynn]] after the [[unicorn]]'s attempt to cleanse a corrupted [[Moonwell]] of the [[Earthmother]]. It was crippled and blinded but the faerie dragon found out that it could see illusions and thought about a way to help Kamerynn by recreating the surroundings as an illusion so the unicorn could run towards [[Genna Moonsinger]], the Great Druid of [[Gwynneth]].{{Cite digital book/Darkwalker on Moonshae|5432}} The two creatures helped her rescue her daughter, [[Robyn Moonsinger]], from [[Laric]] the [[Bloodrider]] who had kidnapped her.{{Cite digital book/Darkwalker on Moonshae|5702}} Finally, Robyn rode the unicorn while Newt helped it with its illusions so she could help Tristan in the fight against [[Kazgoroth]].{{Cite digital book/Darkwalker on Moonshae|5877}}
