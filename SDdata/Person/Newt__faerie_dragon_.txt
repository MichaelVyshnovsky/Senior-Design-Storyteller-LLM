Newt was a faerie dragon who lived in Myrloch Vale in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Newts hide was orange and his body measured  in length, longer than the average faerie dragon.
Newt made the acquaintance of Tristan Kendrick when the prince and his companions were on a mission to rescue Keren Donnell. A few days later, Newt found Kamerynn after the unicorns attempt to cleanse a corrupted Moonwell of the Earthmother. It was crippled and blinded but the faerie dragon found out that it could see illusions and thought about a way to help Kamerynn by recreating the surroundings as an illusion so the unicorn could run towards Genna Moonsinger, the Great Druid of Gwynneth. The two creatures helped her rescue her daughter, Robyn Moonsinger, from Laric the Bloodrider who had kidnapped her. Finally, Robyn rode the unicorn while Newt helped it with its illusions so she could help Tristan in the fight against Kazgoroth.
