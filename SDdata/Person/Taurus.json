        "mainbody": "Taurus was a proud gladiator and mastermind who fought in the Arena of Hillsfar.\nThe minotaur was well known around Hillsfar, and involved in a lot of drama. The superb gladiator was renowned for his cruelty and brawn, and fought with his horns, as well as his weapon. He had at least one servant do his bidding.\nTaurus fought in the arena circa 1358 DR, and was a high ranked pugilist. He was a friend of Jared Jymn, who went missing that same year. Granite, a dwarf of the Fighters Guild was commissioned to find Jymn, and worked his way through the arena to fight Taurus. After being questioned mid-fight, Taurus told Granite that he had left a message at Hermits Place. Taurus followed up with an insult and an attack, but the ferocious Granite slammed the minotaur into the seating area of the stadium, defeating him.\nDue to jealousy, Taurus imprisoned the daughter of Diane, a resident of Hillsfar, in a mirror of life trapping. Only an honored mage would be able to break such an enchantment. Mhai Prittee, the mage who was inexperienced in hand-to-hand combat, had already achieved great honor, and thus was tasked with defeating Taurus in an arena duel, a seemingly impossible quest. The duel began, and Mhai did not fair well, being knocked to the ground by Taurus quarterstaff, and faced certain defeat. However, Mhais crafty frog pet, Dodo, tripped Taurus up with his huge tongue, giving Mhai the opportunity to knock him out, ending the battle. Prittee then located Taurus mirror and destroyed it, freeing Dianes daughter."
