'''Rial Potjian''' was one of the three guildmasters of the [[Diviner's Guild]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Rial stood roughly {{SI|6'2"|ft-in}} tall and weighed around {{SI|180|lbs.|k}}. He had brown hair, green eyes, and a very tan weathered skin from the years spent in his homeland.

==Personality==
Rial was a very devoted and compassionate individual who sought to uplift the disenfranchised of society due to what he witnessed during his youth. He also had a fascination with gadgets.

==Abilities==
Rial was a [[diviner]] type of [[mage]] and knew how to cast the following [[spell]]s:
:''[[alarm]]'', ''[[avoidance]]'', ''[[chill touch]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[contagion]]'', ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[enervation]]'', ''[[false vision]]'', ''[[feign death]]'', ''[[hold undead]]'', ''[[identify]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[locate object]]'', ''[[magic mirror]]'', ''[[protection from cantrips]]'', ''[[protection from evil]]'', ''[[spectral hand]]'', ''[[summon shadow]]'', and ''[[vampiric touch]]''.

==Combat==
Rial was proficient in the use of [[dagger]]s, [[dart]]s, and [[staves]].

==Possessions==
Rial possessed a ''[[robe of the archmagi]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]] +2'', a ''[[ring of regeneration]]'', and several ''[[potion of longevity|potions of longevity]]''.

==Activities==
A lot of this individual's time was spent working on new devices, often tinkering with them in the courtyard of the guild house. He purposely chose this spot so that he could keep an eye on the building itself and all visiting diviners.

==History==
Rial was born in the land of [[Calimshan]] to a minor noble family of the city of [[Calimport]]. During his youth he came to be disillusioned by the decadence of both his family and the ruling class of Calimport. This eventually prompted him to take up the practice of [[magic]] and [[adventurer|adventuring]].

Rial's travels took him to the land of [[Amn]], where a [[gnome]] diviner by the name of [[Aberdeen Krestner]] joined his adventuring company. During one adventure, when fighting [[drow]] they encountered within the ruined city of [[Monrativi Teshy Mir]], they caused a [[wild magic]] surge that transported them both far away to the ruins [[Myth Drannor]]. 

Soon after fighting their way out of Myth Drannor, they met a fellow diviner by the name of [[Saldo Presto]]. They came to adventure together for nearly a decade, until deciding to settle down in the city of Ravens Bluff. There they got a residence close to the city's Diviner's Guild and devoted much of their time to the study of [[tome]]s.

After thwarting the plans of a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] that they had overheard in a tavern, the trio earned the respect of the [[Lord/Lady Mayor of Ravens Bluff|Lord Mayor]] [[Charles Oliver O'Kane]] and were elected guildmasters of the Diviner's Guild by unanimous vote.
