Kaldir was the most powerful lieutenant of the Xanathar Thieves Guild in Skullport in 1479 DR.
Originally Kaldir was a noble in an unknown drow city, but his House was totally destroyed and only he survived. Without allies or resources, Kaldir wandered for a while in the Underdark until he met a beholder cluster. He was charmed to serve them.
In 1479 DR, he willingly became their emissary to Waterdeep in order to help the new Xanathar, Zushaxx, to establish himself as the new Xanathar. Kaldir assassinated all the previous lieutenants of the guild. Zushaxx quickly affirmed his rule and Kaldir was chosen as one of the new lieutenants.Derek Myers.

Kaldir supervised all the guilds activities involving the use of violence assassinations, extortions, blackmail, and enforcement. He was brutal but efficient. Under Zushaxxs orders, he fomented strife among the other lieutenants.
Kaldir was naturally charismatic, with a talent for scheming. However, he preferred to remain silent and alone with himself. Thanks to his drow heritage, Kaldir deferred to the authority of his female peers.
Usually, Kaldir resided in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep or in the Mistshore district.
Kaldir was the most trusted servant of Zushaxx and the only one to know his true identity. In time, he developed feelings for his fellow lieutenant Sial Sapphire.
