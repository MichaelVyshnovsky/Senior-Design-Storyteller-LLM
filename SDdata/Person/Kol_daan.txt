Koldaan was the leader of the last free troglodyte tribe in the Troglodyte Warrens in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
In 1492 DR, the drow retainers of House Auvryndar killed the chieftain of the last free troglodyte tribe and Koldaan became the acting leader.
Koldaan was prone to striking heroic poses with his sparring sword and giving inspiring speeches in Troglodyte both during battle and during negotiation.
