'''Jandur''' was a [[War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
At some point after spring started in the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, the [[Red Wizard]] [[Harnrim Starangh]] assaulted the armory of the sanctum where [[Vangerdahast]] dwelt after his retirement as [[Royal Mage]] of [[Cormyr]]. In doing so, he slew three mages: one with a [[slaying-snake]] spell, another by twisting his shielding magic against himself into a paralyzing field, and a third with [[staeradder]] poison. He fled after using a spell that burned out all recollections from their minds, preventing their dead bodies from responding to any questioning.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|259-262|16}}

[[Darthym]] reported Jandur as dead to the [[War Wizard]] [[Huldyl Rauthur]], a fellow War Wizard working in the sanctum.
