'''Egalavin Zauvirr''' was a noble of [[House Zauvirr]] that joined [[Bregan D'aerthe]] in the early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Egalavin hailed from [[House Zauvirr]] in [[Ched Nasad]]. In [[1018 DR]], he was one of the few true followers of matron mother [[Sheeva Zauvirr]] that followed her after she was exiled from Ched Nasad. However, [[Jarlaxle]], [[Arathis Hune]], and [[Zaknafein]] were hired to kill Sheeva and lured Sheeva's group, including Egalavin, into a trap. During the fighting, only Egalavin and two other males survived and Jarlaxle offered them a chance to join the growing Bregan D'aerthe.

In [[1488 DR]], Egalavin, together with [[Braelin Janquay]], acted as support for the resurrected Zaknafein at Bregan D'aerthe's meeting with [[House Hunzrin]] in the [[Waterdeep]] sewers.
