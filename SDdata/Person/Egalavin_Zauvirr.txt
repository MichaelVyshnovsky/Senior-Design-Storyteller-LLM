Egalavin Zauvirr was a noble of House Zauvirr that joined Bregan Daerthe in the early 11 century DR.
Egalavin hailed from House Zauvirr in Ched Nasad. In 1018 DR, he was one of the few true followers of matron mother Sheeva Zauvirr that followed her after she was exiled from Ched Nasad. However, Jarlaxle, Arathis Hune, and Zaknafein were hired to kill Sheeva and lured Sheevas group, including Egalavin, into a trap. During the fighting, only Egalavin and two other males survived and Jarlaxle offered them a chance to join the growing Bregan Daerthe.
In 1488 DR, Egalavin, together with Braelin Janquay, acted as support for the resurrected Zaknafein at Bregan Daerthes meeting with House Hunzrin in the Waterdeep sewers.
