Tauthryn the Mad was a mage of Turmish of the 12 century DR.
Tauthryns habit was using his magic to breed monsters, including bulettes, perytons, and even strange hybrids of all kinds, which naturally made him notorious. Finally, adventurers killed him for it.
However, over two hundred years later, by the midâ€“14 century DR, the descendants of his creations could still be found wandering Turmish. Some may have bred, while others may have been recreated by deepspawn.
