'''Tauthryn the Mad''' was a mage of [[Turmish]] of the 12{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/96/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Mysterious Turmish|6}}

==History==
Tauthryn's habit was using his [[magic]] to breed monsters, including [[bulette]]s, [[peryton]]s, and even strange hybrids of all kinds, which naturally made him notorious. Finally, [[adventurer]]s killed him for it.

However, over two hundred years later, by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the descendants of his creations could still be found wandering Turmish. Some may have bred, while others may have been recreated by [[deepspawn]].
