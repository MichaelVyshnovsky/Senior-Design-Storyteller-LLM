'''Kepli''' was an avid reader and a member of the [[Book Brigade]], a [[book]] club from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Kepli was a [[rock gnome]] woman with a light skin tone, green eyes flaked with brown, and long strawberry blonde hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Kepli was a part of a group that gathered monthly to discuss a pulpy book they all read. The group, ed by [[Morgan‎‎]], a [[hin]], met at the [[Bloomridge Park]] and included [[Nansi Gretta]] of the [[The Bibliophile]], and [[half-elf]] [[Caerdwyn]]. Kepli was a regular member for whom Nansi had feelings. At some point during the [[Absolute crisis]], Nansi Gretta chose to leave the group due to her busy schedule running the bookstore, but Morgan still tried to entice the shopkeep to rejoin, using her affections for Kepli as an incentive. One of the works the group read was a smutty series of books about a [[werecow]] – ''[[Dusk's Dark Desires]]'', with the protagonist being Morgan's favorite character – something Kepli thought to be basic. Kepli herself liked the character named Bedford. The book club was in session in Bloomridge Park with a group of assassins worshippers of [[Bhaal]] who attempted to slaughter the park-goers in the middle of a day to venerate their monstrous [[deity]]. It was unknown if Morgan and her club survived.
