Jemmy Kirschtorte was a young sorceress daughter of Nell Kirschtorte, a baker from the hamlet of Liams Hold circa 1372 DR.
Jemmy was a young girl with long brown hair. She had a curious and intense personality and a defiant streak.
Jemmys sorcerous gift manifested quite early. She discovered the ability to speak with animals and befriended a smart little bat she named Mr. Barnabus. She also possessed a gift of seeing she drew pictures of people, faraway places, and the people she observed while flying around in her dreams.
In 1372 DR, Jemmy, along with her mother, became targeted by an ancient drow vampire named Sieronius Dethick. The bloodsucking creature had been trapped underneath the hamlet of Liams Hold centuries prior and could not escape unless his curse was broken. And the curse could only be lifted by the drows wife. The vampire attempted to mesmerize Mr. Barnabus, but the bat was too attached to the young sorceress to leave her side. The undead was attracted to Jemmys gift. He visited the girl under cover of night, seeping in fog form through the floorboards into the bakery. Mr. Barnabus witnessed these visits and informed Jemmy of the strange man. For a while, the vampire communicated with the young sorceress via dreams, giving her nightmares. One night, Jemmy saw the man sitting on her bed and shooed him away. Later, Sieronius Dethick attempted to take Nell Kirschtorte, but Mr. Barnabus woke Jemmy. When Sieronius arrived, he saw the girl was awake and left Kirschtorte household to find another wife.
