'''Lin Kwan Shu'''  was a famous female martial artist of [[Shou Lung]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Lin Kwan Shu was a woman living in the city of [[Ping Chow]] in [[Wang Kuo]] province. She was the master of the [[Five Stars School]], which she taught in the back of a bathhouse. Her style of martial art was very adaptable for young women and was based on five styles of movements. Lin Kwan Shu accepted only students who were brought in by a previous high-level student. The final test of a Five Star student was incredibly simple in theory: they only needed to pluck a shiny blue stone from the Master's open palm. Very few passed the exam.

==Description==
Lin Kwan Shu was a slender woman with startling blue eyes, a trait inherited from an ancestor from [[Faer√ªn]].
