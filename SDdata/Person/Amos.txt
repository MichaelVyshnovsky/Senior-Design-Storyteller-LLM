'''Amos''' was a [[warlock]] and adventurer that lived in [[Icewind Dale]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He dedicated himself to reversing the curse of the [[Everlasting Rime]] that plagued his homelands for over two years.{{Cite comic/At the Spine of the World 3|6-10}}

{{Quote|I'm not some lackey doing someone's bidding. I'm a hero, dammit! I'm fighting for the greater good.|Amos, to the druid Belvyre.}}

==Personality==
Amos was a pragmatist who did whatever he could to help others survive. He believed his actions to ultimately be altruistic, and that―despite the cost in the short term―the good he accomplished would outweigh whatever harm was caused along the way. Amos was unfortunately not above letting some suffer in order for him to accomplish those greater goals.

His determinism and ultimate deceitfulness was hidden under an affable persona and attractive charm. Amos' sarcastic wit never left him, even when he faced the darkest of odds.

He seemed to resent people that came from lives of comfort and chose to "play" at adventuring.{{Cite comic/At the Spine of the World 3|16-17}}

==Abilities==
While it was known that Amos had an otherworldly patron as a source of his [[warlock]] powers, it was unknown who that entity was, or where their origin lay.

==Possessions==
Amos possessed meager adventuring gear, including a single [[short sword]], but boasted a beauteous ''[[cloak of raven feathers]]''.

==Relationships==
While they could not really be called friends, Amos formed a genuine connection with the [[halfling]] [[druid]] [[Belvyre]]. The two shared the same goal of saving Icewind Dale by tapping into [[magic]] of the world, albeit by entirely different means.

==History==
{{Quote|Sure, people have died, but the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. These are the rules of survival.|Amos, to Belvyre after kidnapping him.}}

Sometime during or after the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, the goddess [[Auril]] cursed Icewind Dale with everlasting darkness, freezing over the already bleak landscape and killing off much of the land's plantlife. Amos came to learn about an [[Ythryn|ancient Netherese city]] buried deep beneath the [[Spine of the World]], that house incredible magical power, seemingly enough to reverse Auril's curse.

Amos joined forces with the [[duergar]] warlord [[Xardorok Sunblight]], who was raising an army to carry out the will of a sentient, [[primordial shard]]. As part of his efforts to aid the "Boss" as he called Xardorok, Amos worked with miners to extract [[chardalyn]] from deposits in Icewind Dale.

While transporting his mining crew, along with some chardalyn, across the Icewind Dale, Amos crashed his dogsled in the snowy wastes. He was rescued by a [[Runa]], a [[Reghedmen]] [[barbarian]] of the [[Tribe of the Tiger]]. Runa then saved Amos again, when she and the wilderness guide [[Saarvin]] slew a massive [[remorhaz]] that descended upon Amos' crashed caravan. With Amos injured,{{Cite comic/At the Spine of the World 1|1-8}} the trio traveled to [[Good Mead]] where they could all recover.{{Cite comic/At the Spine of the World 1|13-17}}

[[File:Amos, Patience.png|thumb|left|250px|''Amos, getting a talking to by Patience.'']]
It was in Good Mead that Amos was introduced to Belvyre, a young but powerful druid, and his loyal bodyguard [[Patience]]. It was revealed that Belvyre had been working on ways to restore crops in Icewind Dale to save the people of [[Ten Towns]] and had a powerful, heirloom ''[[frostbrand]]'' walking staff in his possession. Amos sparked Belvyre's sense of wonder and magic, by sharing with the group the tale of the ancient city lost deep beneath Icewind Dale, one with powerful magic that could further expand his experiments in crop preservation.

The group of five companions set out across the frozen expanse of the Dale, and were force to take shelter from a snowstorm in a lone cave.{{Cite comic/At the Spine of the World 2|1-4}} Unfortunately, their refuge was attacked by [[frost giant skeleton]]s. Runa and [[Saarvin]] led in the initial attack against the [[undead]] giants, and Patience was forced to leave Belvyre's side to join the battle. Amos swore to protect Belvyre, but had another plan in mind. When the right time arose, Amos abducted Belvyre, and used the halfling's ''frostbrand'' to blast their companions off the snowy cliffside.{{Cite comic/At the Spine of the World 2|10-17}} With Belvyre in town, Amos set out to Xardorok Sunblight's underground, chardalyn mining operation.

[[File:Amos, Belvyre.png|thumb|right|250px|''Amos' final moments, saving Belvyre's life.'']]
During their trek, Amos explained to Belvyre how the food he could grow would better serve Icewind Dale. He wanted the halfling to feed Sunblight's burgeoning duergar army, rather than the residents of the [[Ten Towns]].{{Cite comic/At the Spine of the World 4|7-13}}

Amos was disheartened by his boss' decision to allow his own people to die. Belvyre appealed to Amos' compassion and convinced him to help save the abandoned duergar before it was too late. The duo's former companions caught up to them, and immediately attacked Amos for his betrayal. Belvyre intervened on Amos' behalf and made them spare his life. Unfortunately for everyone, the earth shook beneath then and lava spewed forth.{{Cite comic/At the Spine of the World 4|15-16}}
