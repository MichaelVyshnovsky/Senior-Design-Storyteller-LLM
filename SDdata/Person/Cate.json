        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, Cate had already been long dead. Her sister [[Drusilla]] still cherished Cate's memory. The alchemist kept Cate's remains in a [[terra cotta]] urn decorated with a cameo of her face. When Drusilla made [[tea]], she served a set of [[clay]] mugs for the sister, placing them in front of the urn. The alchemist made tea with [[honeycomb]] like Cate liked it in life."
