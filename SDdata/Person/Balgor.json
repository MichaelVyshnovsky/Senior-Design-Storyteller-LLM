        "mainbody": "Balgor was a gold dwarf from the Rivington district of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nBalgor was a stout well-dressed dwarf with golden-brown skin and reddish brown beard and blue eyes. He wore a quality jacket and a simple wide-brimmed hat.\nIn the , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldurs Gate, displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. However, Sylvie Summerworth was not particularly frightened by the encroaching army. Unlike his friends Sylvie Summerworth and Randalf, Balgor was worried over the looming army. While Sylvie ranted over missing mail, Balgor was annoyed by her caring more about post rather than possible description of Rivington in a war with the Absolute."
