        "mainbody": "adrar \"Hawkblade\" Bruynnis was an adventurer and mercenary that traveled Faerûn during the mid—14 century DR.\nSometime around the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR, Hadrar \"Hawkblade\" was exploring an underground complex beneath the Forest of Tethir. While underground, Hadrar claimed that he briefly held The Argyr, a Gondar relic of tremendous importance and value.\nUnfortunatley for Hawkblade, he was assailed by a group of wights just before the subterranean ruins began to crumble around him. Although he lost the spectacular tome Hadrar managed to survive the collapse and live long enough to share his tale."
