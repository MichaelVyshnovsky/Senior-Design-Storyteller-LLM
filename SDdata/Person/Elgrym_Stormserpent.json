        "History": "After [[Nethglas Stormserpent]] hid the ''[[Wyverntongue Chalice]]'', he told his brothers, planning to tell more people later for the sake of clout. In the meantime, however, he became fearful of retaliation from the Crown and possible exile or fines, and instead swore his brothers to secrecy. His oldest younger brother, Elgrym, told [[Nael Rowanmantle]] anyway, and Nethglas had the two of them killed for that, telling his younger brothers later that Elgrym had met a \"very unfortunate accident\"."
