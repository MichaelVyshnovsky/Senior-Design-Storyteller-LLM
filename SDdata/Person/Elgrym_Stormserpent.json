        "mainbody": "Elgrym Stormserpent was one of the heirs of House Stormserpent in the early-to-mid 15 century DR.\nAfter Nethglas Stormserpent hid the Wyverntongue Chalice, he told his brothers, planning to tell more people later for the sake of clout. In the meantime, however, he became fearful of retaliation from the Crown and possible exile or fines, and instead swore his brothers to secrecy. His oldest younger brother, Elgrym, told Nael Rowanmantle anyway, and Nethglas had the two of them killed for that, telling his younger brothers later that Elgrym had met a \"very unfortunate accident\"."
