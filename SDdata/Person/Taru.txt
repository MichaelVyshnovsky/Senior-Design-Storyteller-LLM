Taru was a spinning spider katanga cleric who served the Mother of a Thousand Young within the Fire Mountain of the Malatran Plateau in the late 14 century DR.
Like other inhabitants of the Malatran Plateau, Taru worshiped spirits of the land, and like other spider katanga, he worshiped the extraplanar evil of the Tamara. Taru was devoted to death and channeled his devotion into death and fire domain spells. This faith made him fearless and spirits granted him such magics as burning hands, death knell, searing light, and others.
As a spider katanga, Taru could scale any wall with ease and create ensnaring webs. His bite was venomous.
The spinning spider katanga cleric decorated himself with skulls of twenty-seven different creatures. He was armed with an obsidian dagger, and a vast collection of spell fetishes.
In the Year of Tigers Curse, Malatran calendar, late 14 century DR, the Wise Ones tribe became aware of an old foe resurfacing. The leader of evil spider katanga, the Mother of a Thousand Young, was ready to birth an army of thousand ravenous younglings. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Taru was stationed within the katangas web room, alongside a katanga archer named Ramu. The room was draped in thick spiderwebs with desiccated bodies of small animals tangled up in them as well as immature spider katanga and ordinary spider young.
It was unknown if Taru survived the confrontation with a group of heroes of the Living Jungle when they infiltrated the katanga caves. However, it was likely Taru fought to the death as he feared nothing and venerated death.
