A man who could always get the best deal on just about any item a person could want, Red was well-liked and respected all over the city. He could often be found conducting business in a corner booth in [[the Cutlass]], where he downed an endless number of drinks with near immunity to the effects of intoxication. Red was never one to betray the trust and was often willing to accept favor over gold as payment for his services.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]] the Cutlass was under Aruph's proprietorship. During that time the inn was not bustling with clientele, instead, it housed local refugees fleeing from the High Capitas' all-out war for control what was ravaging Luskan. The Cutlass had almost no rooms available and only served watered-down [[ale]] during the long weeks of the conflict.<ref>"
