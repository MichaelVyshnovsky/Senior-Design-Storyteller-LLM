Torlgar was the warden of the Sanatorium in Helms Hold during the late 15 century DR.
Like many in Helms Hold, the imposing goliath was afflicted with a spellscar. After becoming involved with the cults that arose in Helms Hold, Torlgar allowed himself to be transformed into a foulspawn, a process that turned parts of his flesh entirely inside-out.
Torlgars original duties included watching over and protecting the Helmite priests as they administered healing to the potentially harmful patients of the Sanatorium. Over time he started to serve as Rohinis personal bodyguard as well.
He was wholly devoted to the Prophet Rohini, to the extent that he allowed himself to be experimented upon, eventually undergoing the process of being transformed into a foulspawn berserker. Unlike several others who sacrificed of themself for the cult leader, Torlgar never surrendered his soul to Rohini.
Torlgar was ultimately slain by the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge during the Siege of Helms Hold, circa the .
