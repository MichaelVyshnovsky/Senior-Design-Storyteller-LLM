'''Torlgar''' was the warden of the [[Sanatorium]] in [[Helm's Hold]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Like many in Helm's Hold, the imposing [[goliath]] was afflicted with a [[spellscar]]. After becoming involved with the cults that arose in Helm's Hold, Torlgar allowed himself to be transformed into a [[foulspawn]], a process that turned parts of his flesh entirely inside-out.

==Activities==
Torlgar's original duties included watching over and protecting the [[Helmite]] priests as they administered healing to the potentially harmful patients of the Sanatorium. Over time he started to serve as Rohini's personal bodyguard as well.

==Relationships==
He was wholly devoted to the Prophet Rohini, to the extent that he allowed himself to be experimented upon, eventually undergoing the process of being transformed into a foulspawn [[berserker]]. Unlike several others who sacrificed of themself for the cult leader, Torlgar never surrendered his soul to Rohini.

==History==
Torlgar was ultimately slain by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] during the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.
