Gunthor () was a dwarf in Shadowdale in 1357 DR.
Gunthor was a forge-master for many years in Hillsfar. Among his many customers were the Shadowdale militia.
When Maalthiir seized power in Hillsfar in 1356 DR, Gunthor decided to relocate to Shadowdale but was imprisoned by Maalthir before he could leave. Florin Falconhand of the Knights of Myth Drannor bought Gunthors freedom and he settled in the Twisted Tower of Ashaba working for Lord Mourngrym Amcathra.
