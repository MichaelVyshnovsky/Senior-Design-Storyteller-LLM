Lorlarrio pondered Professor Limeleechs true opinion of her.
Lorlarrio wrote a guide for language teachers called The Pronunciation of Common for Monstrous Species A Guide for Pedagogues.
In the , Lorlarrio lived in the Lodge of the Society of Brilliance and was actively working on a translation dictionary aimed at bridging the communication gap between the warring species of the Underdark.
She tried to find someone speaking the Classical Meenlock language to conduct an interview with for her dictionary.Volos Guide to Monsters and Monster Manual II 3rd edition state that meenlocks use telepathy to communicate. It has not been proven that meenlocks have a spoken language, thus her assumption that such a language exists may be misguided.
