Geltheluth was a wizard and sage inhabiting Suldolphor in the far eastern reaches of Calimshan in south Faer√ªn during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Geltheluth could be mischievious.
He was a handsome man who enjoyed showering women with his affections. He always dressed in the latest fashion.
Though he did not go adventuring outside of Suldolphors walls, Geltheluth would cast spells for others if the price was right provided it did not involve magically spying on others. Despite this some believed the wizard commanded several magical creatures that spied on others at his discretion.
