Udlara Thaerintauhn was a bedine camel breeder.
Udlara was not above taking advantage of outlanders, if they didnt show themselves to be respectful of bedine culture.
Udlara sold camels and lived in a tent that was larger on the inside, Udlaras tent.
Udlara bred camels.
Udlara was a widow. At the Bitter Well Oasis, he employed a few boys as keepers.
A casually-cast Zhentarim spell had killed her husband, widowing Udlara some time prior.
At a later point, Udlara was the owner of Udlaras Camel Emporium, and also a man. He served the adventurers sent by Cormyr to track down Sabkhat el Talab, providing better service should they be mindful of the customs.
