'''Udlara Thaerintauhn''' was a [[bedine]] [[camel]] breeder.

==Personality==
Udlara was not above taking advantage of outlanders, if they didn't show themselves to be respectful of [[bedine]] culture.

==Possessions==
Udlara sold [[camel]]s and lived in a tent that was larger on the inside, [[Udlara's tent]].

==Activities==
Udlara bred camels.

==Relationships==
Udlara was a widow. At the [[Bitter Well (Anauroch)|Bitter Well Oasis]], he employed a few boys as keepers.

==History==
A casually-cast [[Zhentarim]] spell had killed her husband, widowing Udlara some time prior.

At a later point, Udlara was the owner of Udlara's Camel Emporium, and also a man. He served the adventurers sent by [[Cormyr]] to track down [[Sabkhat el Talab]], providing better service should they be mindful of the customs.
