'''Derreg''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Amaunator]] at the [[Abbey of the Rose]] in [[Sembia]] in the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1450}}, Derreg welcomed [[Varra]] and called the priest [[Erdan]] to help her to give birth to [[Vasen Cale]]. Soon after, [[Drasek Riven]] also arrived at the abbey; he explained to Derreg that the child had a crucial role in the future and asked Derreg to protect Vasen from evil until that day.

In later years, Derreg acted as substitute father for Vasen and trained him as paladin of Amaunator.

==Relationships==
Derreg was the son of [[Regg]] and he was a good friend of Erdan.
