'''Asparagus Mhallie''' was a dairy [[goat]] farmer, displaced by [[The Absolute]], and as a refugee, sought shelter in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Asparagus was an aging [[human]] woman with wispy gray hair, dressed in a simple dress with a [[corset]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, an army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Asparagus Mhallie fled to the nearby city of Baldur's Gate with her heard of dairy goats – her girls, her family. Sadly, her girls were taken – confiscated by the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries upon entry to be slaughtered due to ration shortage in the city. Despite being robbed of her livelihood and beloved beasts, Asparagus was granted entrance to the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate, where she was protesting the confiscations along with other farmers near the [[Basilisk Gate]].
