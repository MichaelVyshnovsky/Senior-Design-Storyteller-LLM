Ganark was a bugbear chieftain who led his fellow bugbears in Mrolgyets Legion in the late 15 century DR.
Ganark and his troops were disciplined. He was known to share his allotments of food and treasure with his tribe while also assuming more than his fair share of danger in battle.
In the battle between Mrolgyets Legion and the Lords Alliance on Harvestshield Mountain in the late 15 century DR, Ganark led his troops to support the gnolls led by Hnalguk. He was defeated in combat by a group of adventurers from Waterdeep, causing his disciplined line to buckle and forcing the Legion to spread their troops out more than they wanted to.
