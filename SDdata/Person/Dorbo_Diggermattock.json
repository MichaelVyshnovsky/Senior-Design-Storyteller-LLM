        "mainbody": "orbo Diggermattock and his wife Senni Diggermattock were the informal rulers of the svirfneblin settlers in Blingdenstone in the late 15 century DR.\nDorbo oversaw the rebuilding of palaces and the reopening of mines, plus organizing patrols to explore as-yet-unexplored parts of the city and to defend the new citizens.\nLike most svirfneblin, Dorbo was serious and aggressive when dealing with outsiders. At heart, however, he was a loving and caring husband and a thoughtful leader for the settlers. He was devoted to the vision of a rebuilt Blingdenstone.\nDorbo and Senni were capable miners. With the money they gathered, Dorbo and Senni planned the reclamation of Blingdenstone. They pondered the reclamation mission for ten years, in order to consider all the dangers. They finally returned to Blingdenstone leading a contingent of settlers, slowly reclaiming parts of the city.\nCirca 1486 DR, Dorbo faced many threats."
