'''Berna''' was a [[human]] instructor of the [[Neverwinter Academy]] who lived in [[Neverwinter]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Berna served as an instructor at the Neverwinter Academy, focusing on teaching students the skills needed to maintain accurate journals of their adventures. She took it upon herself to combat the prevailing rumors regarding the [[Neverwinter Nights|Waterdhavian Creatures]] within the Academy and the cure against the [[Wailing Death]]. She taught the [[Hero of Neverwinter]]. Tragically, Berna met her end during the attack on the Academy.
