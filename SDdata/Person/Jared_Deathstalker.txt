Jared Deathstalker was a cleric of Kelemvor who opposed the ancient Netherese lich Umgatlik in the late 14 century DR.
Jared Deathstalker was clean-shaven, both face and head, and wore dark plate armor adorned with colors and symbols of the Church of Kelemvor.
The Kelemvorite cleric wore gauntlets of ogre power and was armed with a large enchanted +1 shield, carried a scroll of the battletide spell, and several curative potions.
In , Jared Deathstalker joined a bumbling scholar from Waterdeep, Savant Gumbril, in an expedition to uncover the location of the shrine of Umgatlik. Gumbril believed Umgatlik to be a lost Netherese god. His accidental discovery reached the ears of the Church of Velsharoon and Vetrixia Nightmaiden secretly infiltrated the expedition, hoping to release the immensely powerful Netherese lich out of his ancient planar prison. The expedition discovered the ancient tomb in the Crabs Claw Coast, and Jared Deathstalker was there, ensuring the lichs continued imprisonment.
Vetrixia hoped to find an ally in the so-called Hero of Daggerford, offering him arcane power and ancient treasures. It was not recorded if the Hero agreed to the proposition, but that did not stop Vetrixia from returning to Gumbril and confronting Jared.
Within the crypt, Vetrixia Nightmaiden attempted to manipulate Savant Gumbril into doing her bidding through promises of riches and academic success. Dimwitted Gumbril was torn between dreams of a grand academic future and Jared Deathstalkers calls for the scholars common sense. The lich could be unleashed through a simple ritual using undead bones and a special scepter upon the tombs altar. Jared was attempting to discourage outsiders from tampering with Umgatliks shrine peacefully but would eagerly take up blade to slay those attempting to unleash the creature on Toril. If a Hero were to oppose the lichs return or brave enough to venture into Umgatliks prison plane to slay Jared Deathstalker was ready to aid in the task.
