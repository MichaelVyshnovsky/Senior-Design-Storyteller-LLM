'''Jared Deathstalker''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Kelemvor]] who opposed the ancient [[Netherese]] [[lich]] [[Umgatlik]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''Fame will do you little good after Umgatlik tears your head off and feasts upon your soul!''|Jared Deathstalker}}

==Description==
Jared Deathstalker was clean-shaven, both face and head, and wore dark [[plate armor]] adorned with colors and symbols of the [[Church of Kelemvor]].

==Possessions==
The Kelemvorite cleric wore ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'' and was armed with a large [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[shield]], carried a [[scroll]] of the ''[[battletide]]'' [[spell]], and several curative [[potion]]s.

==History==
{{Quote|''Evil [[succubi]], dark rituals, and the stink or undeath. We must ensure that Umgatliks evil taint can never be summoned into this world again!'''|Jared Deathstalker}}<br/>
In {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Jared Deathstalker joined a bumbling scholar from [[Waterdeep]], Savant [[Gumbril]], in an expedition to uncover the location of the shrine of Umgatlik. Gumbril believed Umgatlik to be a lost [[Netherese]] god. His accidental discovery reached the ears of the [[Church of Velsharoon]] and [[Vetrixia Nightmaiden]] secretly infiltrated the expedition, hoping to release the immensely powerful Netherese [[lich]] out of his ancient planar prison. The expedition discovered the ancient tomb in the [[Crab's Claw Coast]], and Jared Deathstalker was there, ensuring the lich's continued imprisonment.

Vetrixia hoped to find an ally in the so-called [[Hero of Daggerford]], offering him arcane power and ancient treasures. It was not recorded if the Hero agreed to the proposition, but that did not stop Vetrixia from returning to Gumbril and confronting Jared.

Within the crypt, Vetrixia Nightmaiden attempted to manipulate Savant Gumbril into doing her bidding through promises of riches and academic success. Dimwitted Gumbril was torn between dreams of a grand academic future and Jared Deathstalker's calls for the scholar's common sense. The lich could be unleashed through a simple ritual using undead bones and a special [[scepter]] upon the tomb's altar. Jared was attempting to discourage outsiders' from tampering with Umgatlik's shrine peacefully but would eagerly take up blade to slay those attempting to unleash the creature on Toril. If a Hero were to oppose the lich's return or brave enough to venture into Umgatlik's prison plane to slay Jared Deathstalker was ready to aid in the task.
