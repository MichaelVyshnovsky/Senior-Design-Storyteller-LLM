        "mainbody": "'''Ysuran Auondril''' was a [[moon elf]] [[necromancer]] and [[adventurer]] who hailed from the city of [[Evereska]].",
        "Abilities": "Ysuran was a master of [[magic]] pertaining to the creation, dictation, and destruction of life force. Some of his more potent spells focused on draining his opponents and augmenting himself, or channeling dark energy that could inflict death to any enemy. He could summon [[undead]] creatures to assist him in combat.",
        "History": {
            "War Against the Vampires": "[[File:YsuranvsZhentarim.jpg|thumb|''Ysuran fighting the Zhentarim.'']]\nAs Ysuran learned tidbits of his memory, he grew increasingly powerful in the necromantic arts. Eventually, Ysuran learned his whole memory after confronting Zarad in the clock tower, located in the [[Cloak Wood]]. Zarad, however, fearing that Ysuran would once again commit genocide, attacked Ysuran. By this time, though, Ysuran had become a [[shadow adept]] and was very skilled in shadow arts. Ysuran fought and killed Zarad.\n\nIn an attempt to renounce his old identity, Ysuran joined the [[Harpers]] in [[Baldur's Gate]]. Ysuran rescued the heroes who had killed [[Eldrith|Eldrith the Betrayer]] and then confronted the [[vampire]] king, Mordoc SeLanmere, who had held them captive. The heroes joined Ysuran's group and helped him defeat the vampire king. It was not a full victory, though, as the king fled to Baldur's Gate where he raised the [[Onyx Tower]]. Ysuran brought down the Betrayer's tower with the help of his seven other companions and together killed Mordoc SeLanmere for good and became a hero within the city."
