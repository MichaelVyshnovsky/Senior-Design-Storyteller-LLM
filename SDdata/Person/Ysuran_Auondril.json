        "mainbody": "Ysuran Auondril was a moon elf necromancer and adventurer who hailed from the city of Evereska.\nYsuran was a master of magic pertaining to the creation, dictation, and destruction of life force. Some of his more potent spells focused on draining his opponents and augmenting himself, or channeling dark energy that could inflict death to any enemy. He could summon undead creatures to assist him in combat. \nYsuran was a noble of Evereska, related to the ruling family, but he was exiled from the city for his deeds. (Adrianna also came from Evereska but Ysuran lived there about two hundred years before her.)\nYsuran joined the Eldreth Veluuthra and tried to commit genocide against the humans of Toril. This motivated him to study necromancy, traveling to Zarads Clock Tower in order to do so. There, he learned necromancy from Zarad Duskmarrow. However, after Zarad learned of Ysurans intentions against humans, he erased the moon elfs memory. This caused Ysuran to wander the Western Heartlands in an effort to discover more about his past. In the Graycloak Hills north of Evereska, he was shunned and turned back by his kin.\nThrough these travels, he met some companions with whom he traveled leading up to the fight against Mordoc SeLanmere.\nthumb|Ysuran fighting the Zhentarim.\nAs Ysuran learned tidbits of his memory, he grew increasingly powerful in the necromantic arts. Eventually, Ysuran learned his whole memory after confronting Zarad in the clock tower, located in the Cloak Wood. Zarad, however, fearing that Ysuran would once again commit genocide, attacked Ysuran. By this time, though, Ysuran had become a shadow adept and was very skilled in shadow arts. Ysuran fought and killed Zarad.\nIn an attempt to renounce his old identity, Ysuran joined the Harpers in Baldurs Gate. Ysuran rescued the heroes who had killed Eldrith the Betrayer and then confronted the vampire king, Mordoc SeLanmere, who had held them captive. The heroes joined Ysurans group and helped him defeat the vampire king. It was not a full victory, though, as the king fled to Baldurs Gate where he raised the Onyx Tower. Ysuran brought down the Betrayers tower with the help of his seven other companions and together killed Mordoc SeLanmere for good and became a hero within the city."
