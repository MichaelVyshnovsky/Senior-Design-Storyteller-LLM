'''Argast''' was a promising young [[malaugrym]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationship==
Argast was the son of [[Halthor]], a very powerful malaugrym.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, following hints discovered in the writings of the long-dead Shadowmaster High [[Melvydur]], Argast found a secret grotto inside the [[Castle of Shadows]]. However, using a separate way, his rival [[Amdramnar]] also found it. They decided to temporarily cooperate to discover the secret of this place. Afterward, both decided to travel to [[Faerûn]]. He secretly hoped to find his mother.

Upon their arrival, they were attacked by some members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] but thanks to their shapechanging powers, Amdramnar killed all the cultists. After arriving in [[Daggerdale]], Amdramnar and Argast learned about the death of [[Elminster]] during the [[second battle of Shadowdale]].

Later, they went in disguise inside the [[Tower of Ashaba]] in order to collect more information about Elminster. At the arrival of [[Tantor Dauntinghorn]], envoy of King [[Azoun IV]] of [[Cormyr]], Argast and Amdramnar posed as the [[War Wizard]] delegate [[Luthtor]] of [[Suzail]] and [[Shaerl Amcathra|Shaerl Mourngrym]] in order to gain information.
