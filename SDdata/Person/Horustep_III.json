        "mainbody": "'''Horustep III''' was the sixteenth [[pharaoh]] of [[Mulhorand]], the nation's pharaoh as of the [[Present Age]], and the first mortal among that nation's long line of god-kings.",
        "Description": "Like all [[incarnation]]s of Horus-Re, Horustep III had facial features that were suggestive of a [[hawk]].",
        "Personality": "In comparison to the former pharaohs of Mulhorand, Horustep III was known to be rather demanding, domineering, and determined to exercise his power far more decisively.",
        "Abilities": "Like incarnations, Horustep III had innate abilities far above that of the average human.",
        "History": "Horustep III was born in the year {{YearlinkName|1346}}, Since a young age, he was best friends with his bodyguard [[Brathes]].\n\nHe ascended to the throne of Mulhorand in the summer of [[1357 DR]] at the age of 11, after the assassination of his father, [[Akonhorus II]]. Over time [[Anhur]], the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi god]] of war, would press the pharaoh to take on a more active role in the world. And his worshiper Brathes actively worked towards sealing the distance between the pharaoh and the [[Church of Anhur]].\n\nDuring the Time of Troubles, Horustep III was one of many mortal incarnations of Horus-Re that fell into a coma, as the god was attempting to regain some of his powers by absorbing the divine fragments held by their bodies.\n\nHorustep III would go on to appoint a new vizier, [[Kalarzim]], to help him in exercising influence over the daily rule of his people. He also became more paranoid, fearful that others may have discovered that he was no longer a lesser avatar of Horus-Re, including enemies within his own church just waiting to strike at him any moment. In an effort to try and maintain the impression that he was divine, Horustep III would frequently summon Horus-Re's avatar, having it inhabit his body.\n\nFollowing the [[Untheric pantheon|Untheric]] god-king [[Gilgeam]]'s death at the hands of [[Tiamat]], Horustep III realized that without the manifestation's presence the border treaty between the god-kings of Mulhorand and [[Unther]] was null.\n\nHorustep III's campaign would eventually culminate in Mulhorand occupying nearly half of Unther by [[1372 DR]], forcing neighboring nations to treat them with greater care.\n\nAs he grew older the pharaoh was increasingly influenced by the foreign mercenaries that worked for him, such as allowing women in the same professions as men in order to solve the nation's then-shortage of workers, a change that was suggested by Kendera. Following that he began to consider restructuring Mulhorand's inheritance laws to be more equitable.\n\nHorustep III's reign came to an end around the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, when the [[Spellplague]] caused widespread devastation in Mulhorand by altering the landscape.<ref>"
