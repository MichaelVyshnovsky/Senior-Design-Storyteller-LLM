'''Lothan Durncaskyn''' was a lord of [[Cormyr]].

==Activities==
Lothan was the lord of [[Immerford]] in the [[Thunder Peaks]] on the eastern border of [[Cormyr]]. He was also the liaison between [[Castle Irlingstar]] and the king.

==History==
Lothan was a veteran of the [[Purple Dragons]] that had often proved his loyalty and his ability.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom}}.
In [[1480 DR]], Lothan was informed of the death of seneschal [[Marthin Avathnar]] inside [[Castle Irlingstar]] but he had no [[War Wizards]] to send as reinforcements. Plus, he had three other troubles in his land: a group of outlaws preying upon caravans, an unseen thief, and a possible crazy wizard in [[Hullack Forest]].

Some time later, [[Mirt]] and the tax collector [[Rensharra Ironstave]] asked for his help and protection.

At last, [[Storm Silverhand]] and some of her new [[Harper]] agents delivered to Lord Durncaskyn all he needed to clear the region of it problems.

==Relationship==
Lothan had the absolute trust of King [[Foril Obarskyr I|Foril]] and of Crown Prince [[Irvel Obarskyr|Irvel]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom}}.
