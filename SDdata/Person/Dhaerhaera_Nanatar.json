        "mainbody": "'''Dhaerhaera Nanatar''' was a female [[human]] [[wizard]] and adventuress who made her home in [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]] around [[1358 DR]]. She was one of the more notable mages of the city at the time.\n\nIn the late 1350s [[DR]], Dhaerhaera captured a [[griffon]] and successfully tamed it and taught it to carry her as a rider. Riding her griffon, she regularly flew around the Vast looking for adventure. After the [[Time of Troubles]] in 1358 DR, her project was exploring the old mountain tombs and strongholds of [[elves]] and humans, dating back to the time when [[dwarves]] [[Roldilar|ruled the Vast]]. She sought lost [[magic]], and had some success in this."
