        "mainbody": "Bwimb II, called the Paraelemental Princess of Ooze, was the second evil archomental of the Paraelemental Plane of Ooze after the death of her father, Bwimb. Although she was generally considered a true archomental (in the loosest sense), she was the weakest of the group.\nBwimb II was an undulating mass of violet sludge.\nAccording to rumor, Bwimb II knew that she would never be more than a minor archomental on her own and had begun searching outside of her homeplane for allies.\nLike her father, Bwimb II was an enemy of Ben-hadar because of how she polluted pure waters.\nBwimb II had somehow come to an understanding with the demon lord Juiblex, though what their shared goals might be was unclear.\nThe ooze para-elementals obeyed her, but little else that inhabited the Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze paid any attention to her.\nBwimb II inherited her power and title as archomental of Ooze after the death of her father, Bwimb, at the hands of Tenebrous.\nAccording to some rather morbid gossip, Bwimb II had spawned from the sludge-like corpse of her \"father\"."
