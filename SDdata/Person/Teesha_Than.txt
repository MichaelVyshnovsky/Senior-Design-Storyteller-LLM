Teesha Than was a human monk of the Old Order and an adventurer from Waterdeep in the early 1370s DR.
Described as energetic, Teesha traveled as an adventurer through Deepingdale in the Dalelands circa 1370 DR. There she befriended the renowned wizard Rhauntides.
In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR, Rhauntides died and, to the surprise of all, bequeathed his tower in Highmoon to Teesha. She established a small monastery there in Rhauntidess Tower, the first of the Old Order in the Dalelands. It was in operation by the Year of the Wild Magic, 1372 DR. The Deepingdalesfolk were initially wary but soon warmed to them after learning the monks were good neighbors.
