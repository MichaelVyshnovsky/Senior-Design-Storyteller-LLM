        "mainbody": "Rokolor was a drow rogue of Menzoberranzan and a member of Bregan Daerthe in 1479 DR.\nRokolor could be influenced by those who showed him how to gain the biggest profit for himself and Bregan Daerthe. He appreciated solutions that maximized gains and minimized losses.\nRokolor was his organizations representative for an alliance with House Xorlarrin and House Melarn in handling a party of adventurers. For the expedition, he asked adventurers loyal to his organization to find and capture alive the traitor in the previous party.\nAfter the adventurers returned from their first mission, Hoshtar Xorlarrin was invited to meet with members of the Council of Spiders by his cousin, Raelaryn Xorlarrin. At the meeting, a Jaezred Chaulssin assassin killed Raelaryn and captured Hoshtar. The alliances hired team managed to rescue him. Regardless of the alliances decision on how to deal with the civil war, it was unanimous in sending the adventurers to eliminate the leader of the assassins. However, Rokolor wanted proof of Melarn involvement in Hoshtars kidnapping and ordered adventurers affiliated with his organization to place items bearing the insignia of House Melarn around the hideout."
