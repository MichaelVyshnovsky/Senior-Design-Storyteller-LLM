        "Personality": "Ro'kolor could be influenced by those who showed him how to gain the biggest profit for himself and Bregan D'aerthe. He appreciated solutions that maximized gains and minimized losses.",
        "History": "Ro'kolor was his organization's representative for an alliance with [[House Xorlarrin]] and [[House Melarn (disambiguation)|House Melarn]] in handling a party of [[adventurer]]s. For the expedition, he asked adventurers loyal to his organization to find and capture alive the traitor in the previous party.\n\nAfter the adventurers returned from their first mission, [[Hoshtar Xorlarrin]] was invited to meet with members of the [[Council of Spiders]] by his cousin, [[Raelaryn Xorlarrin]]. At the meeting, a [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] assassin killed Raelaryn and captured Hoshtar. The alliance's hired team managed to rescue him. Regardless of the alliance's decision on how to deal with the civil war, it was unanimous in sending the adventurers to eliminate [[Valan Jaelre|the leader of the assassins]]. However, Ro'kolor wanted proof of Melarn involvement in Hoshtar's kidnapping and ordered adventurers affiliated with his organization to place items bearing the insignia of House Melarn around the hideout."
