        "mainbody": "eliane was an elf priestess of Eilistraee in Cormanthor and Velarswood in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nFeliane was short, smaller than the average drow, and had dark brown hair. She had pale skin, but often rubbed black dye into her skin to simulate the appearance of a drow. She wore fine mail and a round helmet and wielded a thin blade.\nIn 1372 DR, Feliane was accompanying Seyll Auzkovyn, Xarra, and Halisstra Melarn to an Eilistraeean dance when Halisstra charmed Feliane, sending her away and killing Seyll.\nHalisstra later converted to the worship of Eilistraee and set out with Ryld Argith to find the Crescent Blade in the Cold Field. The two were badly injured but were rescued by Feliane and Uluyara, who had scried them.\nIn early 1373 DR, Feliane and Uluyara accompanied Halisstra to the Demonweb Pits in order to kill Lolth with the Crescent Blade. The three set up a small shrine to Eilistraee in Lolths domain. Soon afterwards, the trio confronted Quenthel Baenre and Danifae Yauntyrr. Feliane was killed in the subsequent fight by Jeggred Baenre."
