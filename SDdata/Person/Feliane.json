        "mainbody": "'''Feliane''' was an [[elf]] priestess of [[Eilistraee]] in [[Cormanthor]] and [[Velarswood]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Feliane was short, smaller than the average [[drow]], and had dark brown hair. She had pale skin, but often rubbed black [[dye]] into her skin to simulate the appearance of a drow. She wore fine mail and a round helmet and wielded a thin blade.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], Feliane was accompanying [[Seyll Auzkovyn]], [[Xarra]], and [[Halisstra Melarn]] to an Eilistraeean dance when Halisstra charmed Feliane, sending her away and killing Seyll.\n\nHalisstra later converted to the worship of Eilistraee and set out with [[Ryld Argith]] to find the [[Crescent Blade]] in the [[Cold Field]]. The two were badly injured but were rescued by Feliane and Uluyara, who had [[Scrying|scried]] them.\n\nIn early [[1373 DR]], Feliane and Uluyara accompanied Halisstra to the [[Demonweb Pits]] in order to kill [[Lolth]] with the Crescent Blade. The three set up a small shrine to Eilistraee in Lolth's domain. Soon afterwards, the trio confronted [[Quenthel Baenre]] and [[Danifae Yauntyrr]]. Feliane was killed in the subsequent fight by [[Jeggred Baenre]]."
