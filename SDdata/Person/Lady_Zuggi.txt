Lady Zuggi was a noblewoman and scholar of Heraldry from the Blade Kingdoms who authored Lady Zuggis Primer of Basic Heraldry, including appendices on Charges, Countercharges, and Trends of Modern Times sometime before 1217 DR.
By 1217 DR, Lady Zuggis Primer was considered an essential volume for the young nobles of the Blade Kingdoms. The book was a required study even for the Princes and Princesses of the city-states. In 1217 DR, Princess Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria used an arcane spell to record herself reading the dreadful book to use it as a cover while she studied wizardly magics.
