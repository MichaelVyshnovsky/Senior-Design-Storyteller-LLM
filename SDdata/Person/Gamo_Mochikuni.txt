'''Gamo Mochikuni''' was a retainer of [[Funada clan]] in [[Nakamaru]] around [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Mochikuni wandered looking like a gaudy tough, wearing loud clothing and swaggering


==History==
Mochikuni and his brothers may be involved in a plot of [[Funada Toyoo]] that can end with their death at hands of [[Mashida Kowa]] and [[Oka Sanai]]

==Personality==
Being the youngest Mochikuni's behavior was heavily influenced by his evil brothers. Lacking even their limited experience, he compensated by bravado and bluster.
