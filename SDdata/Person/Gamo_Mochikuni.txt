Gamo Mochikuni was a retainer of Funada clan in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
Mochikuni wandered looking like a gaudy tough, wearing loud clothing and swaggering
Mochikuni and his brothers may be involved in a plot of Funada Toyoo that can end with their death at hands of Mashida Kowa and Oka Sanai
Being the youngest Mochikunis behavior was heavily influenced by his evil brothers. Lacking even their limited experience, he compensated by bravado and bluster.
