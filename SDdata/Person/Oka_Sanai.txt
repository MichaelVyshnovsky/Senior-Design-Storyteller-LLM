Oka Sanai was a retainer of the Goshukara clan in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
Sanai was a noted satirist, writing some pamphlets against the Funada clan.
In 1357 DR, after Oka Yoshinaka and Mashida Kowa had clashed with the Gamo brothers, Hidenobu, Mitsutoshi, and Mochikuni, thanks to a plot by Funada Toyoo, Sanai was framed for a satirical pamphlet against the three Gamos. Sanai and his friends thought the Gamo had framed Sanai and wanted revenge.
Sanai was always ready to offer sound advice and wise counsel to his friends. He disliked physical exertion and always tried to win battles with a minimum of effort.
