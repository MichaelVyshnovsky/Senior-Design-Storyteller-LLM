        "mainbody": "Brenvol Whitebrow was a werewolf ranger of Sel没ne and a member of the Fangshields who served as their liaison to the lycanthropes of Faer没n. He believed that his family, the White Pack served as an example to the evil shapechangers of Toril, proof that faith in the Lady of Silver could keep anyone on the path of good and righteousness.\nBrenvol was a skilled hunter, tracker and fairly good cook who always preferred to have company while enjoying a campsite meal.\nThe young werewolf had a pointed nose, red cheeks and graying hair (in his human form), that was fully white in some spots, a trait common among his pack members. He had a long and lean frame, similar to that of a wolf.\nHe was a friendly and outgoing man who was popular among the Fangshields, and had many among the group who would readily rush to his aid. His good nature made him the perfect contact person for new recruits within the Fangshields.\nBrenvols mother was Brena Whitebrow, the alpha female of the White Pack Sel没neite lycanthropes. His mother imparted upon him the seriousness and responsibilities of being a leader, preparing him to take over the pack after her.\nAmong Brenvols possessions were a +1 suit of studded leather armor, a quality heavy mace, shortbow and a elemental gem. He often kept his quiver full of silver arrows and decorated his clothes with custom silver coins imprinted with the holy symbol of Sel没ne."
