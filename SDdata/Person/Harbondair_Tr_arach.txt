'''Harbondair Tr'arach''' was a [[drow]] warrior in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the 11{{th}} and 12{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Relations==
Harbondair hailed from [[House Tr'arach]], a small house.

==History==
He was among the warriors led by [[Duvon Tr'arach]] to attack [[House Simfray]] in the {{YearlinkName|1018}}, while riding a [[giant lizard]]. However, during the attack the talented Simfray weapon master [[Zaknafein]] easily defeated but did not kill him.

Afterward, Harbondair joined [[Bregan D'aerthe]] and, in the {{YearlinkName|1118}}, [[Jarlaxle]] ordered him to act as barkeep of the [[Oozing Myconid]] tavern, thus providing cover of the group in the [[Menzoberranzan/Braeryn|Braeryn]].

However, Harbondar supported [[Duvon Tr'arach]] in his attempt to kill Zaknafein by [[poison]]ing his drink.
