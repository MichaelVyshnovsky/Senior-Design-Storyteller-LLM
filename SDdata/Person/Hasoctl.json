        "History": "Hasoctl gained everything in life thanks to his connection with his great-uncle, the Revered Counselor [[Caxal]]. He entered into the service of Lord [[Drakosa]] but secretly worked for Caxal.\n\nIn [[1362 DR]], he was tasked with accompanying an adventuring party hired by Drakosa to find the [[Cloak of One Plume]]. In truth, he would deliver it instead to his great-uncle.",
        "Personality": "Hasoctl was always worried about something: his health, his wealth, the respect of others, the place of the gods in the universe, etc. At heart, he was a coward, always escaping from danger. However, he considered himself a practical philosopher, particularly in dealing with others."
