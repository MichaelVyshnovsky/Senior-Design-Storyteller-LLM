'''Xelez-Dar''' was a leader of the [[drow]] who commanded [[minotaur]]s of the [[Storm Horn Mountains]] of [[Cormyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the early [[1360 DR|1360s DR]], Arelin Starbrow was killed along the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]], ambushed by a monster horde. Her body was retrieved by valorous Sir [[Dutiocs]]. However, the ''Arms of the Roadwarden,'' the [[enchanted]] set of weapons and armor that symbolized the office, were lost to the monster attackers. Xelez-Dar's minotaurs took place in the attack and got away from the ''Sword of the Roadwarden''. The minotaurs delivered the [[sword]] to their mistress deep within the tunnels underneath the [[Labyrinthine Cavern]] north of [[Skull Crag]]. When a group of caravan guards, who stood alongside Sir Dutiocs against a monster attack, was sent to retriever the ''Sword of the Roadwarden'', they hacked and slashed through the Labyrinthine Cavern, eventually confronting Xelez-Dar. In the first encounter, Xelez-Dar vanished in a cloud of darkness and left the adventurers to defend themselves against a band of drow warriors. The second encounter was on Xelez-Dar's territory. She ambushed the adventures, dropping at them from the ceiling along with her drow troops. Despite the ambush, Xelez-Dar was believed not to had survived that battle.
