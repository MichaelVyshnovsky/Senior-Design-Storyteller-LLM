        "mainbody": "Ruthgul was a swindler in Suzail during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe was grizzled and scarred. During the night in which he tried to climb into Amarune Whitewaves window, he was wrapped in largely ragged clothes.\nHe was suitably distrustful, though he sometimes complained of the lack of trust.\nHe had been the one to teach Amarune Whitewave many of her thieving skills, strongly implying he was a talented thief. He climbed to Amarunes window, for instance, one night, which meant he had adequate climbing skills.\nOf note, he owned a cart of wine casks.\nBesides swindling, he did a little bit of honest living as a wine seller.\nRuthgul had taught Amarune Whitewave much of what she knew about thieving.\nIn Mirtul of the , Ruthgul woke up Amarune Whitewave by trying to open her rooms shutters from the outside with a knife. She woke up after recognizing Ruthgul and gathering her weapons, she let him in. He hired her to fake a signature on a document. While she worked, someone else tried to punch through the window Ruthgul claimed it was the person who asked him for the contract. Amarune helped him escape the building unnoticed.\nLater, he was part of Amarune, Storm Silverhand and Arclath Delcastles secret escape from the city of Suzail, sneaking them out in his cart loaded with empty wine casks. He did so under some duress as he had not intended to leave the city yet when he agreed, it with a hand crossbow armed and a small bag of gems as payment, alongside the promise hed be sworded if he refused.\nManshoon planned on using a corpse that would be enspelled to look like Ruthgul at first, then shift into anothers form to throw Amarune off-balance, making her more distrustful, so that she would be less likely to aid Elminster Aumar if he came asking. Amaruen did indeed witness Ruthguls body changing into that of Gaskur, whom she didnt know, and this did make her more suspicious."
