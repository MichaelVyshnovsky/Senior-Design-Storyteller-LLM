Djir Garpeth was a duergar business agent the 1480s DR.
Djir had slate-gray skin, no beard, and a bald head.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, Djir placed himself in a shallow cavern near Eveningstar that the Purple Dragons had recently captured from the drow. He saw the opportunity in all the heavily-armed soldiers and adventurers running about, and set about recruiting them to come fight in the nearby Underdark Arena.
