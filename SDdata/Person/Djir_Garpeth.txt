|You look like you might be dangerous. Care to try your luck in the [[Underdark Arena]]?<br/>Great rewards await those willing to fight for the amusement of the Arena's customers. And they're always glad to see a surface dweller. They like to watch 'em suffer â€” er, compete, I should say.
|Djir's recruitment pitch

==Description==
Djir had slate-gray skin, no beard, and a bald head.

==History==
During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], Djir placed himself in a shallow cavern near [[Eveningstar]] that the [[Purple Dragons]] had recently captured from the [[drow]]. He saw the opportunity in all the heavily-armed soldiers and [[adventurer]]s running about, and set about recruiting them to come fight in the nearby [[Underdark Arena]].
