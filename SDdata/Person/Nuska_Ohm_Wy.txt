'''Nuska Ohm Wy''' was a monkey [[hengeyokai]] living in [[T'u Lung]] around [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Nuska was well known along [[Henai River]], from the dammed lake to outside [[Zun Hi]], for his small thefts, pranks, and general mischief-making. Usually, he tried to join caravans or travelers on the [[Broken Road]], pretending to be an adventurer looking for work or companions on the road. But then he engaged in petty thefts against them, before causing chaos to cover for it or simply to embarrass them. Examples included pinching people's clothes as they slept and making holes in boats or rafts so they'd slowly leak. Peasants in the area for a very awkward situation: "You've met Nuska."

==Personality==
Nuska was not actually evil, just devious and sly and he loved making fools of [[human]]s. He never set out to cause death, only utter embarrassment.

==Abilities==
As a monkey hengeyokai, he could turn into a man or a monkey as he willed.
