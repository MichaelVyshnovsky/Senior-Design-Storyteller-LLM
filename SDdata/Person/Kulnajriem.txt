'''Kulnajriem''' was a [[stone giant]] artist and noted recluse from the [[Heartcoil Deeps]] who was active in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Possessions==
He carried with him large, intricately carved stones that he hurled at enemies in battle. 

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Kulnajriem left his home in the [[Heartcoil Deeps]] to travel the surface when his people were displaced by [[mind flayer]]s led by [[Qholillaroon]]. 

When [[adventurer]]s reported the highly unusual sighting of him on [[Harvestshield Mountain]], it alerted the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], [[Laeral Silverhand]], that something must have been amiss in the Heartcoil Deeps. Although Kulnajriem fought with the adventurers, they parted without killing each other, and he left behind several of his throwing stones carved with messages of warning for the surface world.
