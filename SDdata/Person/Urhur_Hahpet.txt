Urhur Hahpet was a Red Wizard practitioner of necromancy and a follower of the lich Szass Tam.
Urhur was one of the necromancers tasked by Tam with creating and commanding the marauding undead who had attacked eastern Thay in order to create fear. Aoth Fezim, Bareris Anskuld, Chathi Oandem, and Mirror, already suspecting the truth, ambushed Urhurs party, and after he was subdued he confirmed their suspicions. However, he was killed by Szass Tams binding enchantment before he could reveal the necromancers orders concerning the imminent fight against the undead host..
