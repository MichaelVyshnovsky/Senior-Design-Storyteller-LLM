'''Urhur Hahpet''' was a [[Red Wizard]] practitioner of [[necromancy]] and a follower of the [[lich]] [[Szass Tam]].

==History==
Urhur was one of the necromancers tasked by Tam with creating and commanding the marauding [[undead]] who had attacked eastern [[Thay]] in order to create fear. [[Aoth Fezim]], [[Bareris Anskuld]], [[Chathi Oandem]], and [[Mirror (ghost)|Mirror]], already suspecting the truth, ambushed Urhur's party, and after he was subdued he confirmed their suspicions. However, he was killed by Szass Tam's binding enchantment before he could reveal the necromancer's orders concerning the imminent fight against the undead host..
