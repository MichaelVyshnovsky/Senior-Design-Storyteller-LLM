'''Indur''' was a servant of [[Delasko Sornstern]].

==Relationships==
Delasko Sornstern was confident Indur knew the consequences of lying, and he would kill him for leading him false.

==History==
In late [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Delasko Sornstern confided to [[Broryn Windstag]] that the [[blueflame ghost]]s which had been seen slaying across [[Suzail]] were returning afterwards to [[Stormserpent Towers]], strongly implying [[Marlin Stormserpent]], their co-conspirer, was behind these ghosts' activities.

He attributed the revelation to his servant Indur, who tried to follow the ghosts, only to find they vanished through a wall; upon checking, the servant could find no illusion or secret door.
