        "mainbody": "Uktarl Krannoc was one of the co-leaders of the Undertakers in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.\nUktarl and his fiance Harria Valashtar led a group of failed actors who settled in the Dungeon Level of Undermountain, where they posed as vampires and preyed upon gullible adventurers. In 1492 DR, the relationship between Harria and Uktarl was broken and the two started plotting to kill each other and become the only leader of the gang. Harria acquired a flesh golem and was on the verge of winning the conflict.\nUktarl was a coward, always blaming the others for his failures. He lied and cheated for fun."
