        "mainbody": "Sir Jean-Dorial Encarthan was an elvish Knight Commander of the Griffon Guard cavalry from the city of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Sir Encarthan had already earned the high rank of the Knight Commander, deferred of the Bluff, and was a renowned warrior adventurer. Subsequently, he found a mate and held a high-profile social event – the wedding to Kima Greyleaf, moon elf adventurer and the Clan Shados Leader for Life.\nThe wedding took place at the end of the great summer solstice festival, filled with gayety, celebrations, and merchants from across the land. The ceremony was conducted by Lord Chester DMarke, the High Priest of Mystra. Many of the city officials and adventurers of the Living City were in attendance and enjoyed a free feast served to all. The wedding was plagued by accidents from the start – Leland, Jean-Dorials best man before the wedding, was attacked on the way to the event and came to it only to realize that the marrying couples ring was being stolen. A group of hired adventurers was sent after the stolen items, the quest that would end in the discovery of Sarah DeMarcus betrayal of Ravens Bluff. After the simple wedding ceremony was over, the celebration was cut short by an uncanny eclipse that darkened the skies and the blushing brides abduction by a Shar-worshiping hag Amilani, Harven, and Betsy. The hags sought to perform a ritual, sacrificing a worshiper of Mystra to Shar. With help from a group of adventurers who attended the party, Kima Greyleaf was rescued, and the ritual was stopped just in time.\nBy the following year, Sir Jean-Dorial Encarthan was thinking about retirement from adventuring, dedicating himself fully to the service to Ravens Bluff. However, that did not make his life uneventful. Soon after, Jean-Dorial disappeared from the Bluff. Some believed that his absence was rallied to the citys struggles against tanarri incursion in the Vast. Kima Greyleaf-Encarthan was interviewed by the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter but refused to comment on the situation."
