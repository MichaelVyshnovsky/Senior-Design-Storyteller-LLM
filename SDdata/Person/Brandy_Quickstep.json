        "mainbody": "'''Brandy Quickstep''' was a [[halfling]] resident of [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|Things may look bleak, but they can always get better!|Brandy}}",
        "Relationships": "Brandy had a number of connections in her home city, including [[Tarley Bluebell]], who spent her time in [[Protector's Enclave]], as well as a number of Neverwintan merchants.",
        "History": "After the [[Siege of Neverwinter]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Brandy and her associate Tarley tried to create an enclave to house a number of their fellow halflings. Brandy traveled to the city's [[Blacklake District]] and hired adventurers to scout out three houses—Brimbleton Place, Thatcher Road, and Chadwick Stoop—believing them to for sale. They were in fact ruins and overwhelmed with the sludge that arose from the [[Blacklake]] itself.\n\nAfter that unfortunate revelation, Brandy thought to make an effort to help some of her merchant friends. She turned to some adventurers, asking them to recover some of the residents' personal effects that had been stolen by members of the [[Nashers]], the violent faction of the revolutionary [[Sons of Alagondar]], in order for her to return them to their rightful owners."
