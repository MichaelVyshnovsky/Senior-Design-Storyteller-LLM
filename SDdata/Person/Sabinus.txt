'''Sabinus''' was a male [[human]] smuggler and crime lord in [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]] before and during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Sabinus interacted with the mortal [[Kelemvor]], who was in search of one of the [[Tablets of Fate]], and smuggled inside [[Bane]]'s agents, the then mortal [[Cyric]] and the assassin [[Jhembryn Durrock|Durrock]], into Tantras. After the terrible battle between Bane and [[Torm]], Sabinus fled the city, asking help from Cyric, but the thief killed Sabinus, as he was no longer of use to him.{{cite book/Tantras|4-6}}
