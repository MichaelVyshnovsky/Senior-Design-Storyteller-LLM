Sabinus was a male human smuggler and crime lord in Tantras in the Vast before and during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR.
Sabinus interacted with the mortal Kelemvor, who was in search of one of the Tablets of Fate, and smuggled inside Banes agents, the then mortal Cyric and the assassin Durrock, into Tantras. After the terrible battle between Bane and Torm, Sabinus fled the city, asking help from Cyric, but the thief killed Sabinus, as he was no longer of use to him.
