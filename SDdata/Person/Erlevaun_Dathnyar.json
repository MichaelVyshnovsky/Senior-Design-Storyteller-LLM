        "mainbody": "rlevaun Dathnyar was a moon elf wizard from Evereska, murdered in 1348 DR by Horaundoon, the Eater-of-Mantles.\nErlevaun Dathnyar was a spell-caster of average prowess among the elves of Evereska. He used his magic to flatten rocks in his garden into pleasant and appealing forms of waves and swirls with glowing beautiful moonflowers planted in them. The garden was the first place Erlevaun created after his arrival to the Hidden Realms and since then, the wizard could often be found there, lingering and musing. His death came in 1348 DR, when Erlevauns spell mantle was affected by Horaundoons magics. The Zhentarim agent developed a unique spell that allowed him to steal arcane spells and knowledge via mantles, incinerating the target in the process."
