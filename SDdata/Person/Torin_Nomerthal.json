        "mainbody": "Torin Nomerthal was a First Lord of Hillsfar in the late 15 century DR. He was a human who reinstated the citys Great Laws of Trade and Humanity in 1487 DR.\nHe was head of a powerful family, known to be outwardly friendly, but secretly shrewd and cunning.\nTorin governed the city with the aid of Chancellor Garos Daunger the Just, Seneschal Torgrave Needlebaum, Chamberlain Malkyn Grenefeld, and his former advisor, Davon Malaeda.\nTorin was briefly betrothed to Davons twin sister, Thessaly Malaeda, but she turned out to be a shapechanged succubus.\nTorin formed an alliance made up of Hillsfars Tower Guard, Mages Guild, and Rogues Guild, as well as mercenaries and disloyal Netherese soldiers and defeated the Netherese garrison outside Hillsfar. Torin later reformed the Red Plumes and reenacted the citys Great Laws, forcing all non-humans out of the city."
