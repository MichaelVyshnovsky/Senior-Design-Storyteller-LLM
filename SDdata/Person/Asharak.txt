'''Asharak''' was a [[tiefling]] of [[Elturel]] that was forced from his home city along with others of his kind in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|A few words for the kids? Spare a story or two?|Asharak, to one of the [[True Soul]]s.}}

==Abilities==
He possessed some prowess in martial combat and readily shared his knowledge with others.

==Relationships==
Should anything have happened to Zevlor their group's journey, Asharak was set to take over as leader of the Elturian tieflings.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Elturel was [[the Descent|pulled down]] to [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]] and all its tiefling residents were expelled from the city upon its return to [[Faer√ªn]]. Asharak was among the group led by Zevlor, which traveled west for [[Baldur's Gate]], but was forced to take shelter from [[goblin]] raids at the [[Emerald Grove]] near the [[River Chionthar]].

Asharak spent some of his time training the tiefling community's children, such as [[Gan]], [[Umi (tiefling)|Umi]], and [[Ide]], in basic combat skills. He beckoned local adventurers, like [[Wyll]] the Blade of Frontiers to help bolster the children's spirits and give them a fighting chance on the harsh road ahead of them.
