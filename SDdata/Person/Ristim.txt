'''Ristim''' was a young [[human]] commoner and the nephew of one of his village's elders.

==Description==
Ristim was a young man with black hair and a noticeably long nose.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], Ristim was one of the unfortunate villagers captured by the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s slavers. Alongside [[Tren (person)|Tren]], [[Wenta]], and [[Jorsh]], the villagers were dragged to the Cult's hideout in the basement of the ruined [[Darnarest's tower]]. Unlike his fellow abductees, Ristim was left in shackles while others were transported to [[Myth Drannor]] to work in the Cult's excavation project in the [[Polyandrium]]. Thankfully, a group of heroes tasked with investigating the missing persons subsequently made their way to Darnarest's tower, scattering and slaying the cultists, and rescuing Ristim.
