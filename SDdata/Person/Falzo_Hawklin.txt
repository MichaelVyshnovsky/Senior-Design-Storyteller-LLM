'''Lord Falzo Hawklin''' was a noble of the [[Hawklin]] family and a commander among [[Alusair Obarskyr]]'s [[Blades]]. Lord Falzo Hawklin resided in a modestly sized manor on the northern side of [[Suzail]]'s great Promenade with extensive gardens.

==Description==
Smooth-voiced, tall, dark-featured, and dressed in flawless black garb, Falzo appeared to be every bit the image of what a noble should be. As a young man he was known to be incredibly handsome.

==Personality==
Quick of wit and intellect, Falzo Hawklin bore himself with the mature comportment and relaxed manners of one of the most sophisticated nobles, even in his younger years.

==Possessions==
Falzo carried several [[magical]] devices, such as a ''[[ring of mind shielding]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]]'', and ''[[bracers of armor]]'', and he could often be seen wearing a magical and ceremonial-looking, ornate dagger at his side.

==History==
In mid-[[1372 DR]], Lord Falzo Hawklin was instructed by Alusair, the Steel Regent, to wipe out a group of bandits spotted in some ruins near the [[Tilverton Scar|Black Crater]] of [[Tilverton]]. Falzo quickly worked in conjunction with both the [[War Wizards]] and [[Purple Dragons]] of [[Cormyr]] to locate reliable adventurers to undertake the task.
