        "mainbody": "The '''Ghost Knight of Galardoun''' was a wandering [[ghost|apparition]] that appeared in various locations throughout the heartlands of [[Faer√ªn]].  Several cults sprang up to venerate the apparition including the [[True Ghost Knight Faithful]] in [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Nature": "There were two competing theories on the nature of the Ghost Knight.  One theory held that the creature was the ghost of an undead hunting [[paladin]], while the other theory claimed the helm was animated by [[magic]].",
        "Behavior": "The Ghost Knight was known to guide lost travelers to safety and also to lead adventurers to hidden crypts.  The ghost was claimed to attack [[undead]] and the great [[mage]] [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]] believed the apparition fed on the essence of the undead.",
        "History": "The ghost first appeared near the abandoned village of [[Galardoun]] between [[Scornubel]] and  [[Triel]] around [[1420 DR]].  It haunted the general vicinity for about twenty years, after which it began to wander widely with sightings in Waterdeep, [[Marsember]] and [[Sembia]].  It was even reported as far away as [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]]."
