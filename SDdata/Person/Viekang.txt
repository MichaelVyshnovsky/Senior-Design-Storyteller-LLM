'''Viekang''' was one of the [[Bhaalspawn|children]] spawned by the deity [[Bhaal]], in the years before the [[Avatar Crisis]].

==Personality==
For most of his life he was quite a fearful individual.

==Abilities==
Viekang had a unique ability – whenever he felt great fear, he teleported to a different location on [[Toril]].

==History==
Viekang was known to have spent some time in the town of [[Trademeet]], when it was under assault from wild animals under the command of malevolent [[druid]]s.

During the conflict  of the [[Bhaalspawn]], in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Viekang was hunted by a number of his half–siblings, most notably the [[fire giant]] [[Yaga-Shura]].

When he was in the city of [[Saradush]] he encountered [[Melissan]], an individual dedicated to helping all of the Bhaalspawn. She "cured" him of his randomized teleportation ability.

On [[Returning Day]], in the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, Viekang interrupted [[Grand Duke]] [[Abdel Adrian]] when he was addressing the Baldurian citizens within the [[The Wide|marketplace]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. He and his allies assaulted the Grand Duke and a chaotic fight broke out.

It was unknown which of the two men died in the battle, but it was clear that the victor transformed into the [[Slayer]]. The monstrous creature was subsequently defeated by the combined efforts of [[the Watch]] and band of visiting [[adventurer]]s. Unbeknownst to all, the death of the final two Bhaalspawn and Bhaal's avatar resulted in the god of murder's return to the [[Faerûnian pantheon]].
