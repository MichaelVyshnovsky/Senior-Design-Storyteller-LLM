Viekang was one of the children spawned by the deity Bhaal, in the years before the Avatar Crisis.
For most of his life he was quite a fearful individual.
Viekang had a unique ability – whenever he felt great fear, he teleported to a different location on Toril.
Viekang was known to have spent some time in the town of Trademeet, when it was under assault from wild animals under the command of malevolent druids.
During the conflict  of the Bhaalspawn, in the , Viekang was hunted by a number of his half–siblings, most notably the fire giant Yaga-Shura.
When he was in the city of Saradush he encountered Melissan, an individual dedicated to helping all of the Bhaalspawn. She "cured" him of his randomized teleportation ability.
On Returning Day, in the , Viekang interrupted Grand Duke Abdel Adrian when he was addressing the Baldurian citizens within the marketplace of Baldurs Gate. He and his allies assaulted the Grand Duke and a chaotic fight broke out.
It was unknown which of the two men died in the battle, but it was clear that the victor transformed into the Slayer. The monstrous creature was subsequently defeated by the combined efforts of the Watch and band of visiting adventurers. Unbeknownst to all, the death of the final two Bhaalspawn and Bhaals avatar resulted in the god of murders return to the Faerûnian pantheon.
