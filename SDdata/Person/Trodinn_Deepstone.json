        "History": "Trodinn Deepstone spent the entirety of his long life with a [[hammer]] in hand, ablaze by the heat of blacksmithing furnaces. Despite that, Trodinn had never grew tired of such labor. He was truly happy working the metal into quality [[weapon]]s. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Trodinn was working in the city of Neverwinter, offering his services to adventurers and city defenders."
