'''Quinn Silverfinger''' was the Grand Syndar in change of [[The Golden Lodge]], a shrine to [[Waukeen]], in the town of [[Lonelywood]] in the late 13{{th}} and early 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

{{quote|''I joined the church because, unlike my plump kin, I have the ambition and dedication to succeed at business. I was quite successful at the Goldenspires in Amn.''|Grand Syndar Quinn Silverfinger}}

==Description==
Quinn was a pale-skinned [[hin]] man with bright red hair, wearing the [[gold]]en garb of the [[Waukeenar]].

==Possessions==
Perhaps the halfling's most prized possession was his [[enchanted]] [[sling]]. Quinn brought the sling with him to [[Icewind Dale]] and hid it in a secret chest within the temple's living quarters. He used enchanted ''+2 [[force bullet]]s'' and wielded a powerful ''+4'' ''[[defending]]'' [[morningstar]].

==Relations==
Quinn did not hold speaker [[Baldemar Thurlow]] of Lonelywood in high regard, thinking him to have the political grace of a [[walrus]].

==History==
Quinn Silverfinger hailed from the capital of [[Amn]] – [[Athkatla]]. He joined the Church of Waukeen to dedicate himself to ambition and business, gaining him some success at the famed [[Goldspires]] temple complex. As a recognition of his work, the head priest of Goldspires blessed ''[[Quinn's fancy sling]]''. The halfling proudly carried the weapon with him wherever he went but only got to use it on three occasions. Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Quinn established The Golden Lodge shrine in the frontier town of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale, driven by the challenge and desire to bring commerce and prosperity into one of the most remote places in [[Faerûn]].

Another notable member of the clergy under Quinn was [[Nolan the Healer]], who served the church at The Golden Lodge until he was shipped to [[Targos]] as a "penance" for greed running too thickly in his blood. The healer took it begrudgingly and considered the Grand Syndar to be nothing but a "runt." Nolan was tasked with establishing new trade with Lonelywood and traveled to other settlements in the area, trying to convert drunks and [[barbarian]]s into the Waukenaar faith. In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Nolan of The Golden Lodge joined the [[Targos Guard]] as a healer to aid the town against the attacks of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] that plagued the region.
