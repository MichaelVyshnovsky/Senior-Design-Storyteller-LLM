        "mainbody": "Lord '''Vorik Aris''' was a noble of [[Cormyr]] and a covert supporter of [[Gondegal]]'s revolt and brief civil war in [[1352 DR]]. In [[1369 DR]], he took over [[Wyvernwatch Castle]] and used it as a base of operations as he planned his illicit activities in Cormyr.",
        "Description": "Lord Aris was a handsome and distinguished man. His symbol was a skull on a black field with three yellow lightning bolts radiating from it.",
        "Personality": "He was incredibly ambitious, with arrogance and pride to match. He was dangerously clever and farsighted, enough to achieve his goals, and he unscrupulously allied with anyone who would serve his aims.",
        "Possessions": "Lord Aris expertly wielded a ''+3 [[vorpal]] [[longsword]]'' and a ''+2 [[shield]]'', and wore ''+2 [[plate armor]]'' and a ''[[ring of human influence]]''. He rode a prized heavy [[warhorse]], a white stallion named Perdition.",
        "Activities": "In [[1369 DR]], Lord Aris built up a loyal cohort of soldiers, mercenaries and adventurers, hiding his forces in Wyvernwatch Castle as he planned raids in the [[Stonelands]] and planted spies in [[Tilverton]], [[Halfhap]], [[Hillmarch]], [[Arabel]], [[Bospir]], [[Thunderstone]], [[Hultail]], and [[Immersea]]. He ultimately planned on overthrowing Cormyr and becoming King himself.",
        "Followers": "Lord Aris recruited a large number of followers for his build-up in Wyvernwatch Castle. They included a veteran core of soldiers who had served under [[Gondegal]], human and demihuman mercenaries, [[undead]], [[adventurer]]s and other opportunistic individuals.\n\n* [[Tobias Querl]], Captain of the guard.\n* Four veteran human lieutenants and 100 human soldiers, including 32 veterans of Gondegal's war.\n* [[Tanatha (priestess)|Tanatha]], [[Stormlord (priest)|Stormlord]] of [[Talos]] and his spiritual advisor.\n* [[Ratakos]], a [[necromancer]] who helped handle the undead.\n* 75 [[skeleton]]s and 75 [[zombies]].\n* [[Gribbergrash]], [[orog]] chief of the [[Eye Killers]] orogs.\n* Three orog leaders and 60 well-equipped orog soldiers.\n* [[Oznod Brekker]], [[Winaneh Marlowson]], and four more veteran scouts.\n* Various other groups and individuals.\n\nLord Aris also managed to somewhat domesticate a nearby mated pair [[wyvern]]s and their two grown offspring, gaining him fierce protectors for Wyvernwatch Castle.",
        "History": "Lord Aris covertly supported [[Gondegal]]'s overly-ambitious war on Cormyr in [[1352 DR]], and managed to escape discovery by the Crown. Over the following years he developed his own plans for conquering Cormyr. After assembling his forces in Wyvernwatch in [[1369 DR]], he marched on the ruins of [[Darkenshield]] in order to set up a forwards base for attacking Cormyrean forces in the Stonelands. He was confronted by a group of interfering adventurers that were joined by the [[bard]] [[Mendryll Belarod]] and the angsty noble [[Rhyn Mournsoul]]. The handful of heroes performed a ritual with the ''[[Four from Cormyr (item set)|Four from Cormyr]]'' that drew forth the spirits of the [[Starburst Swords]] [[Purple Dragons]], and another which summoned the spirits of the slaughtered residents of Darkenshield.\n\nThe vengeful dead swarmed across his forces, and Lord Aris was forced to defend himself alongside his officers, [[Tanatha (priestess)|Tanatha]], [[Gribbergrash]], and [[Ratakos]]. He was ultimately defeated and either killed or driven back to [[Aris Castle]], his plans in ruin.",
        "Rumors": "One of Lord Aris' lieutenants suspected that he intended to perform a magical ritual in the ruins of Darkenshield that would aid his military operations."
