'''Wythyndle''' was a blind [[half-elf]] [[bard]] of the 10{{th}} century [[DR]] known for receiving a holy book from [[Milil]].

==History==
Wythyndle received the [[Wythyndle's Round Book|"Book that Sings"]] from the Lord of All Songs while singing his praises, alone, on an unnamed mountaintop in the eastern [[Cloven Mountains]].

After receiving the book, Wythindle was carried by Milil down to the [[House of Alastrin]] to bring news of this holy gift. He lived there until his death in the winter of the {{YearlinkName|996}}, at which point the book magically disappeared from the temple.
