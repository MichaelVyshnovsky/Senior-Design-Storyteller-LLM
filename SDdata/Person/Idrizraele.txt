'''Idrizraele''' was a [[Morueme]] [[blue dragon|blue]] [[dragon]] that lived in the [[Morueme's Cave|Morueme lair]] within the [[Nether Mountains]] until the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1371 DR]] the patriarch of the Morueme dragon clan. [[Kizilpazar]], was killed by his power-hungry sons, [[Nahaunglaroth]] and [[Roraurim]]. As Idrizraele was the elder dragon's younger mate, she was driven out of the clan's ancestral home by the two younger males. Whether out of frustration, despair, or rage, Idrizraele assaulted the nearby [[Lady's Hand Monastery]] and was blasted away by the clergy of [[Loviatar]], via weapons from ancient [[Netheril]].

Oddly enough, her death was avenged by Nahaunglaroth and Roraurim, who proceeded to destroy over half of temple's Loviatan inhabitants.
