'''Mudwort''' was a [[gnoll]] in [[Maligor]]'s army in [[Thay]] as well as a reluctant [[Harper agent|Harper]] informant in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''The gnoll snorted. The information he had been passing on to the Harper was common knowledge in Amruthar. Still, it was another matter to reveal the Red Wizard's present location to an outsider. Perhaps it was a test, Mudwort considered. Maybe the Harper was Maligor's puppet, and the Red Wizard was testing the gnoll's loyalty.''}}

==Description==
Mudwort was an average gnoll in his appearance. He wore misfitted crude [[studded leather]] armor with a flame on a purple field emblazoned on its chest. The same symbol adorned the round battle-worn wooden [[shield]] that Mudwort handled together with a [[spear]]. The spear was festooned with a dirty red ribbon.

==Personality==
Mudwort was not very bright and was somewhat clumsy and greedy. He showed paranoid tendencies in seeing the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] as secretly testing his loyalty. The gnoll spoke broken [[Common]] in short monosyllabic sentences.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, the [[Aglarond]]an council contacted a Harper [[druid]] named [[Galvin]], tasking him with investigating Maligor's activities and growing army, fearing a looming war with Thay. Mudwort was an informant and spy who met with the druid in the [[First Escarpment]] area on the shore of [[Lake Umber]]. However, the gnoll only gave information that was common knowledge in [[Amruthar]], giving the name of the Red Wizard amassing the army but hardly anything else. Greedy for more coin, Mudwort ended the exchange of intel. Galvin, growing frustrated, tried to stop the gnoll, but instead provoked him. In the ensuing fight, Mudwort was killed by the druid, who had wildshaped into [[cave bear]] form. The gnoll died being sure that the druid was a Red Wizard, and Galvin himself was left with regrets over the needless death.

Meanwhile, Maligor was informed by his [[naga]] assistant [[Asp (spirit naga)|Asp]] about Mudwort's strange absence, raising suspicions of him being a spy. The Red Wizard sent a [[darkenbeast]] to murder the spy. The flying beast witnessed the gnoll's murder and continued following Galvin instead.
