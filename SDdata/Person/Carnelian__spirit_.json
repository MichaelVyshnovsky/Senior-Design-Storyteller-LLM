        "Background": "Carnelian was one of the few self-aware ghosts who lived in Wandering Stones, and he had lived there for many decades, as of 1479 DR. Carnelian was a wise individual, thanks to the information he had learned from other spirits, including the spirit of the [[primordial]] [[Arambar]] itself. He was intrigued about this primordial, wondering what could be the event Arambar was awaiting so eagerly. Carnelian was also a good friend of the [[dragonborn]] [[shaman]] [[Olothon]]."
