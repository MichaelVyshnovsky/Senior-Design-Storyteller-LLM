Her Royal Highness '''Sybille Zaranda Rhinda Chenowyn Alisande Rhindaun''' was Princess of the [[Corsairs' Sea]]{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|44}}

==Relationships==
Sybille's regent until she came of age was her father, King [[Haedrak Rhindaun III]], who ruled over the Principality in her stead. She was the heir to the throne after her mother [[Zaranda Star|Zaranda Star Rhindaun]].

Sybille was the oldest of three triplets. As was the tradition in Tethyr for princes and princesses, the first daughter always shared the first name of her mother as her second name.

Her brother's name was [[Coram Rhindaun]]. His daughter, [[Jemra Rhindaun]], would marry into the [[Obarskyr]] royal family of [[Cormyr]]. Her sister's name was [[Cyriana Rhindaun]].

==History==
Sybille, along with her brother and sister, were born in [[Flamerule]] of [[1370 DR]]. This was the first time there had been royal triplets in Tethyr since the reign of Queen [[Alisande Bormul]] in [[832 DR]].
