Raashub was an uridezu and captain of a ship of chaos.
Raashub was the captain of a ship of chaos that crashed into the Lake of Shadows in the Underdark and was trapped in time in a whirlwind. At the end of 1372 DR or the beginning of 1373 DR, Pharaun Mizzrym and his group, led by Quenthel Baenre, sought out and repaired the ship in order to travel with it to the Demonweb Pits in search of Lolth. Pharaun was able to bind the uridezu captain with a locket and wax figurine, but Raashubs attempted to escape by summoning rats and gating in his cousin Jaershed. The group defeated the attack, but with Raashub gone, Pharaun was forced to learn to control the ship of chaos himself (with the secret help of the invisible Aliisza). The group traveled with the ship, but it shattered on the Plane of Infinite Portals.
Raashub had the ability to summon rats.
Raashub had a cousin named Jaershed.
