        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|922}}, Strongor convinced [[Chardansearavitriol]], a [[black dragon]] known as Ebondeath, to become a [[dracolich]]. He provided the magical assistance needed for the transformation. \n\nFollowing the creation of the dracolich, Strongor presided over members of the new Ebondeath Sect, which resided in the [[Mausoleum of Ebondeath]] that they'd created beneath the ruins of the [[Uthtower]]. As their leader, he led the sect in a unique perspective combining the teachings of Myrkul with those of [[Sammaster]]. He preached that Myrkul would absorb the mortal world into his realm. The gods of the living would be discarded and a new pantheon of dracoliches would ascend. He resided at the Mausoleum for the remainder of his life. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|929}},<ref group=\"note\" name=\"death\">Ed Greenwood, in a [https://www.sageadvice.eu/can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-ebondeath-and-strongor-bonebag/ tweet], stated that Strongor was murdered in [[969 DR]]. However, \"Eye of Myrkul\" in ''Dragon'' #73 already said \"Strongor's sudden death less than a decade later...\" from 922 DR and the transformation of Ebondeath into a dracolich. This article therefore assumes the year to be 929 DR. a young, ambitious cult member conspired against Strongor. He hoped to not only kill the leader, but also trap his soul in the weapon that slew him, an enchanted [[obsidian]]-bladed dagger. This cultist was successful in his ambition to kill Strongor, but it was unknown if his plans to trap Strongor's sentience in the dagger were successful. It was also unknown what became of the assassin, though he may have perished in the attack.{{cite web\n| url            = https://www.sageadvice.eu/can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-ebondeath-and-strongor-bonebag/\n| title          = Can you tell us a little about Ebondeath and Strongor Bonebag?\n| accessdate     = 2021-05-29\n| author         = [[Ed Greenwood]]\n| date           = 2020-05-05\n}}"
