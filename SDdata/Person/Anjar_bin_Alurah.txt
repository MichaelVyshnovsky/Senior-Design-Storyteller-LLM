Anjar bin Alurah was a prince of Hiyal around 1367 DR and the favored son of Sultan Alurah bint Asrah.
Anjar was intelligent and strong and obeyed his mothers wishes. His greatest fault was his lack of subtlety. Anjar always favored an extreme direct approach.
Though Anjar had not been officially appointed as the Sultanas heir, he was given the title of Grand Commander of Hiyals army.
Anjar was the eldest of five children.
