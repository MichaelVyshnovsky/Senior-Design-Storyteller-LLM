'''Aballister Bonaduce''' was a [[wizard]] and head of the Triumvirate of [[Castle Trinity]] in [[Erlkazar]] and the nemesis of his own son, [[Cadderly Bonaduce]].

==Personality==
He was calculating, cold, and merciless.

==History==
Aballister murdered his wife and was unwilling to raise his son, Cadderly, so he abandoned him at the [[Edificant Library]]. Thereafter, he focused on his magical studies.

Guided by the goddess [[Talona]], Mistress of Poison, Aballister created the Chaos Curse and unleashed it upon the Edificant Library, home of Cadderly and his friends.<ref>

He was ultimately killed by Cadderly in a spell duel on another plane of existence in the {{YearlinkName|1362}}.

==Relations==
Aballister's familiar was the imp [[Druzil]], who himself held the wizard in distaste.

Aballister was also the leader of the wizards of Castle Trinity, located north of the Edificant Library in the [[Snowflake Mountains]]. and later the head of the sect itself.<ref>
