Oswulf swiftly left the Castle of the Twins and formed the Silver Blades, with the aim to contain his brothers evil. \nOswulf journeyed back to Verdigris, along with his Silver Blades. Here, they forced out the monsters that now inhabited the ruined town. Despite his brothers lichdom, Oswulf was still unwilling not to slay him.
