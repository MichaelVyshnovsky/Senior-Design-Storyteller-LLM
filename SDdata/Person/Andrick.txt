'''Andrick''' was a young man who joined the [[Cult of the Absolute]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|What...? Are you...are you testing us?|Andrick, to someone he literally just met.}}

==Description==
He wore a long blue tunic, long enough to be considered a dress, which was studded with [[pearl]]-like decorations. He was balding on the top of his head, and let the sides of his head grow out to some length.

==Relationships==
Andrick and his companion [[Brynna]] followed the lead of [[True Soul]] [[Edowin]]. They completely devoted themselves to the man, who they viewed as one [[the Absolute]]'s [[chosen]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Andrick, Brynna, and Edowin were tasked by the Absolute with finding missing prisoners that escaped from a [[nautiloid|vessel]] that came crashing down to the [[Sword Coast]] from the sky. Andrink and Brynna were unaware that their true goal was to recover a ''[[mysterious artifact]]'' for their goddess.

During their journey, Edowin was injured by a vicious mother [[owlbear]]. While he managed to wound the monstrous creature with his [[spear]], the True Soul suffered mortal wounds during the fight.
