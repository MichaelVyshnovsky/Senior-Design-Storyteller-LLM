When it came to leadership, she valued and respected honesty above all else. \nShe was very passionate about protecting the environment of her homeland, willing to lay down her life for it, though she longed for the day that she could just return to the serenity of the oceans depths.\nVaasha was one of four storm giant bodyguards that accompanied Imperator Uthor in the Storm Kings assault on Iymriths lair. She fought alongside Nimir, Orlekto, and Shaldoor."
