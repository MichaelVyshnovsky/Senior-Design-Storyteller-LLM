Floryn Spellshatter was an adventurer in Cormyr with the Magebanes company in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Floryn had a strong distrust and disdain for magic items and spells, and refused to use or work alongside them.
Lacking magical enhancement, Floryn was a strong and powerful warrior on his own merits.
In , Floryn and Densil Wizardfoe attended a party at Thistleflame Keep, held by Lord Partic Thistle for King Azoun IVs birthday. They stayed the night in the Keep and were briefly considered suspects after Lord Thistles apparent murder, but their refusal to use any magic ruled them out.
