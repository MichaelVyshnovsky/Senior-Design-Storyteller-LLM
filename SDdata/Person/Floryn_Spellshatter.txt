'''Floryn Spellshatter''' was an [[adventurer]] in [[Cormyr]] with the [[Magebanes]] company in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Floryn had a strong distrust and disdain for [[magic item]]s and [[spell]]s, and refused to use or work alongside them.

==Abilities==
Lacking magical enhancement, Floryn was a strong and powerful warrior on his own merits.

==History==
In {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Floryn and [[Densil Wizardfoe]] attended a party at [[Thistleflame Keep]], held by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] for King [[Azoun IV]]'s birthday. They stayed the night in the Keep and were briefly considered suspects after Lord Thistle's apparent murder, but their refusal to use any magic ruled them out.
