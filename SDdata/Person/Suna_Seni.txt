'''Suna Seni''' was an [[elf|elven]] slaver who worked with [[Eldarin]] in the City of Coin, [[Athkatla]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Suna had a very pale skin tone and platinum-white hair.

==Possessions==
As a [[fighter]], she relied on dexterity and wore simple [[leather armor]]. However, Suna was armed with a deadly [[enchanted]] [[blade]] â€“ ''[[Arbane's Sword of Agility]]''.

==History==
At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Suna was romantically involved with [[ranger]] [[Valygar Corthala]], however, their eventually cut the ties due to Suna's involvement with slave trade in [[Amn]]. In the 1369 DR, Eldarin and Suna Seni worked with a cabal of slavers who operated out of slums in Athkatla. When [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Abdel Adrian]] interrupted the slaving trade, Eldarin and Suna Seni began hunting the adventurer and his companions across the City of Coin. Suna led a group of slaver warriors and [[mage]]s but all were believed dead after an unsuccessful attempt to kill their mark.
