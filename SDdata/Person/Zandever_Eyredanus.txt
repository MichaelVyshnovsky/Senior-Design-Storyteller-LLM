'''Zandever "Nighteyes" Eyredanus''' was a guide in the town of [[Triboar]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Zandever earned his reputation for guiding parties through the woods during the night, in order to strike against the [[orc]]s. He often deals with wealthy [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavians]].

He advised [[spellcaster]]s that if they could not acquire a ''[[ring of warmth]]'', they should instead use a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]'' and lie in a fire to keep warm.
