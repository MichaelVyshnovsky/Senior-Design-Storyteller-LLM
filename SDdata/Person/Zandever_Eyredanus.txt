Zandever "Nighteyes" Eyredanus was a guide in the town of Triboar during the 14 century DR.
Zandever earned his reputation for guiding parties through the woods during the night, in order to strike against the orcs. He often deals with wealthy Waterdhavians.
He advised spellcasters that if they could not acquire a ring of warmth, they should instead use a ring of fire resistance and lie in a fire to keep warm.
