        "mainbody": "'''Dracandros of the Crimson''' was an exiled [[Red Wizard of Thay]] in [[Battledale]] in [[1357 DR]].",
        "History": "Dracandros was a promising but megalomaniac Red Wizard. He was stripped of all his property and exiled from [[Thay]] after he attacked a [[mind flayer]] ambassador during a dinner party.\n\nHe dreamed of unleashing a new [[Flight of Dragons]] and managed to ally with the [[dracolich]] [[Crimdrac]] and to obtain the powerful [[Helm of Dragons]].\n\nDracandros later relocated to the small village of [[Hap]], which he conquered thanks to his [[drow]] mercenaries and [[efreeti]] and [[salamander]] minions. At this point, [[Tyranthraxus]] offered to Dracandros to join the [[New Alliance]] and he agreed.\n\nDracandros at last was killed by the adventuring party possessing the [[Azure Bonds]].",
        "Personality": "Dracandros was crazy. He believed himself one of the most powerful Red Wizards and did not understand the reasons for his exile. He was obsessed with unleashing a new Flight of Dragons, believing this was the key to returning in glory to [[Thay]]."
