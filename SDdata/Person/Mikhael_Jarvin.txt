==History==
[[File:Mikhael Jarvin zombie.jpg|150px|thumb|''Mikhael after fully succumbing to the infection.'']]
During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], Mikhael was recovering in the [[Eveningstar War Hospital]] when [[Peron Uthe]] arrived for treatment. Peron was infected with a strange disease passed from the [[druid]] [[Halsaime]], which turned him into a [[red musk zombie]] and began spreading to the other patients. Mikhael was among those infected, and eventually transformed into a zombie before being destroyed when the hospital was cleansed. A sample from his body was used by head priest [[Hurim Jaskyr]] to create an inoculation against Peron's infection, allowing the fallen ranger to finally be destroyed.
