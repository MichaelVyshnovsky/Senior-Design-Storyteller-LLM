During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, Mikhael was recovering in the Eveningstar War Hospital when Peron Uthe arrived for treatment. Peron was infected with a strange disease passed from the druid Halsaime, which turned him into a red musk zombie and began spreading to the other patients. Mikhael was among those infected, and eventually transformed into a zombie before being destroyed when the hospital was cleansed. A sample from his body was used by head priest Hurim Jaskyr to create an inoculation against Perons infection, allowing the fallen ranger to finally be destroyed.
