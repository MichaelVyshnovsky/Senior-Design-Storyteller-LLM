'''Kelda''' was a [[horse]] that accompanied the [[chosen]] of [[Cyric]] [[Malik el Sami]] for a time during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The horse had a sad look to her eyes and expression but appeared to otherwise be well cared for, if a bit overweight.

She walked with exceptional grace, more akin to a [[unicorn]] that a regular horse.

==Relationships==
{{Quote|Why is it you care more for your horse than for your friends?|The [[Harper]] agent [[Ruha]], to [[Malik el Sami|Malik]].}}

Malik was especially fond of Kelda, Malik demonstrated his affection for Kelda by cooing to her, extolling her virtues or even kissing her on the snout.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Malik and Kelda traveled all the way from [[Thousand Faces]] in the [[Greypeak Mountains]] and the [[Dire Wood]] within the [[High Forest]]. After Malik relocated to [[Villa Dusari]] in the [[Netheril|Netherese]] city of [[Thultanthar]] the [[1372 DR|following year]], Kelda was given a comfortable home within the city's stables.
