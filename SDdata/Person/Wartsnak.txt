Wartsnak Direlord was an orc leader in the 14 century DR and later a wight warlord around 1485 DR.
Around 1347 DR, Wartsnak was the war leader of the orcs living inside Illefarn.
In 1485 DR, Wartsnak was somehow possessed by the pit fiend Baazka and thanks to him he slaughtered the leaders of the Fanged Moon, Gory Maul, and Jagged Scythe tribes and took control of a large orc horde. Afterward, Wartsnak retreated into the dungeon under their headquarters in the ruins of Harpshield Castle.
Later, he was killed by an adventuring party hired to search for the Delimbiyr Bloke.
