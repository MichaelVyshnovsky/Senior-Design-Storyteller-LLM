'''Wartsnak Direlord''' was an [[orc]] leader in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and later a [[wight]] warlord around [[1485 DR]].

==History==
Around [[1347 DR]], Wartsnak was the war leader of the orcs living inside [[Illefarn]].

In 1485 DR, Wartsnak was somehow possessed by the [[pit fiend]] [[Baazka]] and thanks to him he slaughtered the leaders of the [[Fanged Moon]], [[Gory Maul]], and [[Jagged Scythe]] tribes and took control of a large orc horde. Afterward, Wartsnak retreated into the dungeon under their headquarters in the ruins of [[Harpshield Castle]].

Later, he was killed by an adventuring party hired to search for the [[Delimbiyr Bloke]].
