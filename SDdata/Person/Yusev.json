His face was often creased by frowns of concentration.\nIn the , Yusev, still a youth, was sent by his family to join Kelemvors temple in Mulsantir. Despite still being a very fresh member of the faith, Yusev found the church to be disappointing. He was under the impression that the Church of Kelemvor permitted the study of necromancy like Kelemvors divine predecessors did, something Yusev had a natural knack for, but after arrival, he realized the temple saw that school of magic to be an abomination. Yusev was tempted to learn more about the art of necromancy, but the temples library was lacking. He enrolled aid of individuals outside of the Kelemvorite faith in order to procure tomes of necromantic lore. One such vault was hidden within the Death Gods Temple, an old temple dedicated to Myrkul, located in Mulsantirs Shadowfell reflection."
