'''Grimwald''' was a legendary [[mage]] of [[The Covenant]] and founder of the [[School of Wizardry]] in [[Waterdeep]] (previously [[Neverwinter]]). He was known to have lived in the [[Tower Terrible]] in [[Wrinklestone]] in the [[Sword Coast North]], before traveling beyond the world of [[Toril]].

==Description==
While his physical appearance was that of a hunched-over, untidy man who often muttered to himself, Grimwald was known for having a kind heart.

==History==
Grimwald founded the School of Wizardry in [[457 DR]], along with the other renowned [[wizard]]s [[Aganazzar]], [[Ilyykur]], and [[Presper]]. with the aim of fostering, and enforcing, peace between the warring tribes of [[the North]]. They marked this occasion by the creation of a collective [[spellbook]] known as the ''[[Tome of the Covenant]]'', which possessed spells of each mage's creation.

Unfortunately the mage's apprentices never took on the pact of their masters and the school went largely inactive for many years. Grimwald and Presper began to embark on a series of adventures through ''[[portal]]s'', but only returned to [[Toril]] a few times in between travels, the last known visit occurring in [[1298 DR]]. Grimwald's home was looted long before [[1372 DR]].

In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Grimwald and Presper encountered the wizard [[Savengriff]] in their travels across the planes. After some discussion, the three decided to reform the Covenant, this time based in the city of [[Waterdeep]].

==Invented spells==
*''[[Grimwald's greymantle]]'': This spell prevented healing or regeneration effects from working on a single creature.

==Trivia==
The blades known as ''[[Grimwald's dagger]]s'' were named after the wizard, who was notorious for taunting his pet [[cat]]s.{{Cite dragon/169/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A dozen deadly daggers from the FORGOTTEN REALMS}}
