With a deceased husband and no children of her own, the only family she knew was a few siblings to whom she did not speak.\nShe was well-served by her personal valet Kaddrus, a cambion that took the visage of a particularly attractive younger man. She believed him to be quite capable in carrying out her wants and orders.\nIn the early 1490s DR, Lutecia sought out scholars at High Hall in order to track down family members who she would find more amenable to being heir to her familys city estate.\nWhen the Shield of the Hidden Lord was stolen from the family crypts, in the , Lady Lutecia tasked Kaddrus and his lackeys with its retrieval."
