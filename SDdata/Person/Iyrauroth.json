        "mainbody": "'''Iyrauroth''', also called '''\"the Wyrm of the Peaks\"''', was a male [[great wyrm]] [[black dragon]] that laired in the steppes of [[Thar]] and in [[Mount Grimmerfang]] in [[the Vast]].",
        "History": "In fear of his older sister, [[Embrurshaile]], Iyrauroth spent centuries of his life hiding on other continents. During this time, he sired sixteen sons and daughters. Embrurshaile's death caused a magical backlash in the [[Weave]] that likely notified her brother of her demise. He immediately set off with his children to conquer her territory in the [[Galena Mountains]] and [[Thar]],{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/The Cauldron of Monsters}} joining the [[Dark Alliance]] in the process and helping to lay waste to [[Northkeep]] in the [[400 DR|Year of the Blue Shield, 400 DR]].<ref name=tGHotR-p73> He later went on to destroy [[Tharniir]], shattering the power of the [[ogre]]s of Thar.\n\nIn the [[572 DR|Year of Writhing Darkness, 572 DR]], Iyrauroth killed with claw and fang the [[orc]] [[Ologh]], the [[Overking]] of [[Vastar]], plunging the orcish kingdom into civil war.{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|66}}\n\nIyrauroth later fell into a deep slumber under the steppes of Thar that lasted for centuries.\n\nA [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell, namely the [[Wyrmsmoke cell]], awoke Iyrauroth by [[1369 DR]]. They attempted to persuade him to undergo the transformation into a [[dracolich]], and gave him offerings. Iyrauroth only found their efforts amusing.\n\nStirred from his rest now, Iyrauroth acted as he pleased, and took to raiding caravans crossing Thar between Glister, [[Melvaunt]], and [[Phlan]], including those run by the Cult. When a whole caravan to Glister disappeared and agents reported on the previously unknown black dragon's raids, the [[Zhentarim]] feared that the Cult of the Dragon was responsible. To preserve trade, they marched [[Zhentilar]] troops into Thar, to which the Cult reacted by rallying local tribes to their cause, until a war loomed.\n\nBy [[1374 DR]], however, Iyrauroth had gone south to [[the Vast]] and based himself in [[Mount Grimmerfang]], once the seat-of-power of Ologh the Overking.",
        "Relations": "Iyrauroth had an elder sister, Embrurshaile, whom he hated and feared.\n\nHe had sired at least sixteen sons and daughters, whom he kept firmly in line and marshaled as his army against his foes and to enforce his will. Reportedly, many dragons worked to secretly kill off a number of \"Iyrauroth's get\" to diminish his army and ensure none replaced him when Iyrauroth passed. It was believed these scions might have recovered Embrurshaile's gathered magic items in Thar to bolster their own arcane might.\n\n[[Dalgar]], a [[Draconic creature (template)|draconic]] [[orc]], claimed lineage from Iyrauroth, bearing the title \"Blood of Iyrauroth\". ''Circa'' 1374 DR, he was a member of the Wyrmsmoke cell of the Cult of the Dragon based in the Galena Mountains overlooking Thar."
