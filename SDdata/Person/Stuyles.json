Thus Stuyles and many of his fellows became bandits assaulting the caravans of Luskan.\n\nIn [[1463 DR]], their ambush was repelled by [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] and [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. After Drizzt discovered the whole truth of their situation, he was shocked and offered some goods to Stuyles and his fellows.",
