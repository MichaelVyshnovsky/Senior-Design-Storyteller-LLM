{{quote|The North is too cold of winter nights for one who's neglected to bring a warm fire—and a stout hall to house it in—with him.|Arnthiir Windrivv}}

==Description==
He was visibly restless.

==Personality==
Arnthiir was a hearty thrill-seeker, prone to reckless deeds, and a pranksome man, though he was somewhat exhausting.

==Abilities==
Despite his age, the rogue was still notably dexterous by {{yearlink|1367}}, despite a career that stretched back before {{yearlink|1337}} and a human lifespan. He was possessed of remarkable force of personality.

Of note, due to a curse, Arnthiir had to change his name.

==Possessions==
Windrivv was known to carry an [[enchanted]] [[dagger]] that could be made to glow with ''[[faerie fire]]'' on command, a ''[[ring of the ram]]'', and a ''[[ring of spell turning]]''.

==Activities==
Arnthiir Windrivv wandered from tavern to inn throughout [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], occasionally serving [[Laeral Silverhand]] on covert matters. Those sometimes took him through [[Waterdeep]] and even [[Skullport]].

==Relationships==
He was once one of the Nine alongside the [[ranger]] [[Thanadar]] and Laeral Silverhand. After they were released from their curses, Arnthiir continued to serve Laeral Silverhand, who nonetheless found his company exhausting.

One of his maternal ancestors had a bad reputation; he named himself after that one when he changed his name.

==History==
The bard was one of the Nine in the {{yearlinkName|1337}}, the year in which they acquired the ''[[Crown of Horns]]'', a [[Myrkul]]ite artifact. The crown put a curse on them that gave any [[hordling]] in [[Hades]] the ability to ''[[teleport without error]]'' to their presence, even across planes, by simply uttering their names. Laeral came to possess the ''Crown'' through most of that time; with its fell power, the artifact drove the adventurers to fight each other until Laeral was rescued by [[Khelben Arunsun]]. The mage then broke the curse on the surviving members, including the bard and the ranger, but that required them to abandon their old names.

By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Arnthiir, as he was now known, spent most of his time wandering [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]], but had undertaken occasional missions for [[Laeral]] where she required a covert agent.
