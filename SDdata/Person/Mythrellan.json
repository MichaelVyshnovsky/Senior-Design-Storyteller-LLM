She lived in the Serpent Tower, within the city of Bezantur in Priador. She was known to have only mindless servants.\nMythrellan changed her appearance as often as other noblewomen change their gowns. At times she had golden eyes and sky blue skin, while at others she patterned her body in brown and tan diamonds that resembled the skin of a snake.\nShe preferred isolation and devoted most of her time to study.\nthumb|Tower home of zulkir Mythrellan in Bezantur.\nSome time before 1320 DR, Mythrellan took the young man Lailomum Zerad as an apprentice.\nSometime before 1362 DR Rembert Wellford apprenticed under her.\nMythrellan served as zulkir of illusion for many years, even assuming the title before the birth of Zulkir Aznar Thrul.\nMythrellan died some time between 1373 and 1375 DR, presumably by the zulkir-lich Szass Tam, and was replaced as zulkir by Dmitra Flass."
