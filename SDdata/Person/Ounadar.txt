'''Ounadar''', also called '''the Blood-Drenched''', was a [[cleric]] of [[Garagos]] who rose to power in the [[Vale of the Reaver]] in [[Yondath]].

==Activities==
Ounadar gathered a congregation consisting of criminals, [[berserker]]s, and others not opposed to committing acts of violence. Ounadar and his brethren practiced their slaughter on creatures spawned from several captured [[deepspawn]]. He dreamed of one day conquering and ruling the city of [[Westgate]].
