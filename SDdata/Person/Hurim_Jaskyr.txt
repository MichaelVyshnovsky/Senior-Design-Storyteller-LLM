{{Quote
|It seems only Peron Uthe — the first man infected — can transmit it thus far. They can be cured before they reach the second stage… after that, I can do nothing. At first, I thought it was [[Yellow musk creeper|Yellow Musk Creeper]], and it certainly is a plant-borne illness.

During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], Hurim Jaskyr supervised the [[Eveningstar War Hospital]] as they treated the wounded and sick. He was assisted by fellow healers [[Meena Follakin]], [[Delethir Mistveil]], [[Eolynn Arva]], and [[Jono Branton]].

When the [[ranger]] [[Peron Uthe]] returned to Eveningstar, he started spreading a disease to the other patients that turned them into [[red musk zombie]]s, though they themselves could not pass it on. Peron was barricaded into the west wing of the hospital to contain him, and Meena went for help with Anazar. They found a team of [[adventurer]]s who were brought in, and helped Hurim create an inoculation against Peron's disease by collecting samples from the fallen patients [[Aeron Leifbrand]] and [[Mikhael Jarvin]]. With a protection devised against the disease, Hurim created a ''[[dimension door]]'' to the west wing and sent the adventurers though to finish the job, saving the hospital.

Later, several [[Purple Dragons]] infected with [[lycanthropy]] were brought into the hospital for treatment, without anyone knowing they were afflicted. The first sign of something being wrong was when one of them killed Hurim Jaskyr and tore his body to shreds, leaving him in his bed. The healer Delethir Mistveil invited more adventurers into the locked-down hospital to investigate the bizarre murder, only for the following nightfall to reveal even more [[werewolves]] and the pack leader [[Ogiyon Tomain]].
