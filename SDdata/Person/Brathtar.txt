'''Brathtar''' was a commander of the [[Empyrean Knight]]s in [[Stardeep]] until {{yearlink|1375}}.{{cite book/Stardeep|156-160|14}}

==Description==
Brathtar was usually clad in [[mithral]] [[greave]]s and [[hauberk]].

==Activities==
Brathtar was a commander for the [[Empyrean Knights]] in Stardeep.

==Relationships==
Until [[Telarian]] began his scheme to free [[Carnis|the Traitor]], they were friends.{{cite book/Stardeep|92-97|10}}

==History==
Around ten years before {{yearlink|1374}}, Brathtar received Keeper [[Nangulis]]' [[Cerulean Sign]] after the latter was transformed into a sword. He was to pass it to the next keeper of the [[Stardeep/Inner Bastion|Inner Bastion]].{{cite book/Stardeep|174|16}} The knight [[Telarian]] often joined him and the captains for dice games and white wine, which the commander imported from [[Sildëyuir]] at great cost. They once explored the [[Stardeep/Underdungeon|Underdungeon]] beneath Stardeep, where Brathtar had saved Telarian's life from some [[revived fossil]]s and then ordered the entrances closed.

On {{yearlink|1375}}, after [[Midwinter]], Brathtar received orders from Keeper Telarian to eliminate an elven encampment that had wandered too close to [[Stardeep]]'s entrance. Though he agreed to the task, he left a letter for [[Delphe]], asking her to meet with him at her earliest opportunity.{{cite book/Stardeep|104-107|9}}

After they began receiving retaliation from the [[Masters of the Yuirwood]], Brathtar was ordered by Telarian to hide all signs of fight; after he failed at that task, Telarian judged him a traitor. When Brathtar began to question Telarian's orders again, the Keeper slew him on the spot with ''[[Nis]]''.
