        "mainbody": "'''Nester''' was one of [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s apprentices.",
        "Description": "In life Nester was a handsome, slender man with thinning hair and a penetrating stare. After achieving lichdom, Nester appeared as a green-glowing, floating skull and skeletal arms.",
        "History": "Nester tried to become a [[lich]] and succeededâ€”in part. He attained [[undead]] status, but he badly bungled his spells. He became a lich, in form, but gained slightly different powers. His [[phylactery]] was disintegrated and his body followed slowly."
