        "mainbody": "Nester was one of Halaster Blackcloaks apprentices.\nIn life Nester was a handsome, slender man with thinning hair and a penetrating stare. After achieving lichdom, Nester appeared as a green-glowing, floating skull and skeletal arms.\nNester tried to become a lich and succeededâ€”in part. He attained undead status, but he badly bungled his spells. He became a lich, in form, but gained slightly different powers. His phylactery was disintegrated and his body followed slowly."
