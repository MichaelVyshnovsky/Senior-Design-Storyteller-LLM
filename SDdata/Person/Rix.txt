'''Rix''' was a [[kobold]] from the [[Dragon's Rest]] cloister in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Rix's strong religious devotion to [[Bahamut]] led her to maintain his temple, taking on the role of elder [[Runara]]'s assistant. Rix also adored puns.

==History==
Rix shared with three other kobolds a small [[Dragon's Rest#Monastic cells|monastic cell]] in the Dragon's Rest cloister cut into the cliff face. Each of the four slept on individual hammocks. Just like all the other kobolds, she worked at night because of their sensitivity to sunlight.

''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1481}},{{Stormwreck-time}} Rix and [[Varnoth Wender|Varnoth]] witnessed the wrecking of a ship to the north of the cloister, in the area around the wreck of ''[[Compass Rose (ship)|Compass Rose]]''.
