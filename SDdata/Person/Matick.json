        "mainbody": "General '''Matick''' was a legendary figure of the [[Netherese Empire]], who invented many of the most popular [[spell]]s used throughout the [[Realms]]. His known spells were: '''''General Matick's missile''''', '''''General Matick's shield''''', and '''''General Matick's armor'''''. He was also a rare [[arcanist]] of  the martial arts and the arcane, like the later rebel [[Adrian Freeman]].",
        "Description": "The general was not only a skilled [[arcanist]] and [[inventor]], but also a great [[Fighter|warrior]]. Unlike most mages of the era, Matick was both especially strong and robust.",
        "Personality": "General Matick was said to be relentless and aggressive, particularly towards [[elves]], whom he disdained.",
        "History": "Matick was born in {{YearlinkConvert|2238|NY}} of the [[Golden Age of Netheril]]. He quickly worked his way up the ranks in the army of [[Seventon]] and repelled several raids of [[goblinoid]]s. An extremely successful commander, General Matick had the lowest ally-to-enemy troop loss ratio in the entire history of Netheril. At the [[Pass of Humaithira]], General Matick died in  a last stand against a horde of trolls in {{YearlinkConvert|2298|NY}}.\n\nMatick officially introduced ''magic missile'' in {{YearlinkConvert|2268|NY}} at age 30, ''shield'' in {{YearlinkConvert|2279|NY}} at age 41, and ''magic armor'' in {{YearlinkConvert|2284|NY}} at age 46.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some sages did not believe that Matick had invented his wildly popular spells, but instead had them commissioned."
