'''Mifune''' was a [[samurai]] in the town of [[Aru]] in [[Wa]] in the 1770s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==Description==
He was deeply ugly and had a barrel-chested build. He was aged in his mid-30s.

==Personality==
When sober, he was typically rather surly, but when inebriated, he grew very belligerent and abusive. He was proud and vengeful.

==Relations==
Mifune was the only son of a wealthy local noble of [[Aru Province]], but did not serve the [[daimyo]], [[Benju Matsutomo]].

==Abilities==
He was specialized in his [[katana]] and proficient in [[horse]]manship, and for some reason noh theater.

==History==
One night in high summer in {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, Mifune got completely plastered in a local tavern or [[Wikipedia:yakitori|''yakitori'']] bar. Stumbling and potentially bumping into a relaxing adventurer, he would fly into a rage and immediately challenge them to a duel on the spot, could not be talked out of it, and would attack even if refused or ignored. If not slain in the fight, but incapacitated through "dishonorable" means like [[magic]], he would go rogue as a [[ronin]] to avenge the insult. Even if he was slain in the fight, his father would seek his killer for revenge of his own. Either way, it was a bad night out all around.
