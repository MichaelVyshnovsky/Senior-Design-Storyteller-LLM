        "mainbody": "ander Turbalt was the captain of the ship Morning Bird based in Tharkar in the Utter East in the late 14 century DR.\nJander was fat and craven.\nJander was cowardly and incompetent. He lost all his last scraps of courage and dignity after the sinking of the Morning Bird and only despair, rage, and shame remained to drive him.  \nCaptain Turbalt was hired by a mysterious individual named Belmer Droon to transport himself and his hirelings under the cover of night from Tharkar to Eldrinpar in Doegan. The voyage turned out to be a dangerous one as shortly after sailing the Morning Bird was chased by a grim-looking black ship. The black ship bombarded the Bird with fire pot missiles and terrifying boneballs, making the passengers and the crew fight for their lives. Narrowly escaping the pursuers, thanks to Belmers skill and magic items, the Morning Bird found itself besieged by Umberlees ghost ship and its sea zombies.\nAfter appeasing the Bitch Queen, the Morning Bird was caught up with by the Black Dragon, helmed by the infamous captain Orim Redbeard. Belmer Droon managed to convince the pirate captain to leave them alone, even though one of his hirelings, Kurthe Lornar, was getting ready to take over the Bird and pursue Orim Redbeard, blinded with vengeance. Kurthe Lornar himself was killed in a duel with Belmer over the attempted mutiny.\nSoon after, the Morning Bird sprouted leaks, likely because of Orim Redbeards magic, rotting the hull of the ship. The crew and passengers had to evacuate the sinking ship and swim with their belongings to the shores of Doegan. Jander and a big group of his sailors survived the sinking alongside the Sharkers but the captain blamed the loss of his ship upon Belmer and the Sharkers.\nTurbalts resentment over the ships loss was only exacerbated by the apparent threat of fiends and monsters who roamed the wilderness of Doegan. One by one, all the sailors were killed by the fiends and only the Sharkers and Jander Turbalt remained.\nAfter arriving in Eldrinpar in Doegan, Jander revealed to the paladins from Waterdeep led by Miltiades the true identity of Belmer Droonâ€”the famed assassin Artemis Entreri, hoping they would avenge the loss of his ship. He said hed been held captive for the last week by the Sharkers. After hearing his betrayal, Entreri calmly drew a small blade and threw it at Turbalts head, instantly killing him."
