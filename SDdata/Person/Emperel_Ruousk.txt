Emperel Ruousk () was a member of the Purple Dragons and the guardian of the Lords Who Sleep.
Emperel lived in Ashabenford but often was out in the Stonelands fighting alone against goblinoids and trolls.
He was killed by the ghazneth Xanthon Cormaeril while investigating a series of murders in 1370 DR.
Emperel was a polite man with a noble heart and calm reasoning. He was worried that goblinoid find on accident the tomb of the Lords Who Sleep.
Emperel was equipped with a weathercloak, a magical dagger, a magical ring that emitted light, and magical gauntlets that shot kings bolts. Unfortunately, none of these items were of any use against the ghazneth.
