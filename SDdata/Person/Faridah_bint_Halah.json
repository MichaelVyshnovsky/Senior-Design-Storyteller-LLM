        "mainbody": "aridah bint Halah was a person of note in Hawa.\nShe was tall and trim and had deep brown eyes that matched her sun-streaked brown hair. Faridah always smelled of rich perfume and was thought of as one of the prettier corsair captains of Hawa. Most believed her to be a human, but Faridah was actually a lamia noble masquerading as a human in order to spread evil throughout the Corsair Domains.\nRumors of her cruelty had led to substantial rewards being offered by Qudra for her capture.\nFaridahs most implemented ability was her wisdom-drain.\nFaridahs ship was Dark Rover, a notorious vessel among the Free Cities of Zakhara and the mamluks of Qudra. She owned a secret fortified area on top of a portion of the Island of Firethorns.\nShe actively sought prisoners while out on the seas in order to add to her crew. Faridah developed a plan to eventually enslave the entire population of the fishing village of Safe Cove, draining the wisdom of a few inhabitants on each of her visits.\nFaridah was followed loyally by her crew, each of which had had their wisdom drained and acted as slaves to her will."
