Should that change, rest assured I will serve you as loyally as I have [[Vala Thorsdotter|Vala]].|Shatevar, to [[Galaeron Nihmedu]].}}",
        "History": "Shatevar was coerced into service by [[Vala Thorsdotter]] and her [[Vaasan]] warriors as they ventured into the depths of the [[Greycloak Hills]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. Shatevar was forced to use his ''[[disintegrate|disintegrating]]'' eye beam to carve through rock and stone to reach [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] in the area around the [[Sharn Wall]].\n\nWhen Vala and her men engaged a band of [[Evereskan tomb guardian]]s, Shatever proved a valuable ally to the humans, nullifying their magic with its [[antimagic]] eye beam and even killing the elven sentry [[Aragath]]. Shatevar was slain with a single slash of a [[darksword]] by one of the Vaasan warriors, its body left limp and lifeless upon the cavern floor."
