        "mainbody": "'''Nalkara''' was an [[empyrean]] of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the daughter of [[Auril]], the goddess of winter, and [[Thrym]], the god of the [[frost giant]]s.",
        "Description": "Her appearance was that of a strikingly beautiful frost giant with pale blue skin and cold blue eyes, while for hair she had crackling blue flames. Her surroundings changed in accordance with her mood, becoming warm and bright if she was happy and dim and cold if she was unhappy.",
        "History": "She owed a favor to [[Halaster Blackcloak]] and in [[1492 DR]] she came to his aid when summoned inside his tower. He ordered her to kill a group of adventurers who confronted him in his throneroom."
