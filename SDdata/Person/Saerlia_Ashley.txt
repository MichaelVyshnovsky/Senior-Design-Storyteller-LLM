'''Battle Chaplain Saerlia Ashley''' was a [[human]] [[cleric]] of [[Tempus]], god of battle. She tended the [[Shrine of Tempus (Thunderstone)|shrine of Tempus]] in the town of [[Thunderstone]] in [[Cormyr]] around [[1369 DR]].

She was a scarred woman who inspired attending adventurers and [[Purple Dragons]] soldiers with sermons of battle, blood, and fire. She offered her healing only to those wounded in battle, and would confirm the truth of a tale before she started.
