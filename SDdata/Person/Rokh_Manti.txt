'''Rokh Manti''' was a [[warlock]] and [[artificer]] active in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. During the events of the [[death curse]], he was hired by the [[Harpers]] to investigate the curse's cause.{{Cite dragon+/14/Fiction: Prelude (Tomb of Annihilation)}}

==Description==
He was an inventor and crafter of [[magic]]al contraptions and devices, including traps, tools, vehicles, and even his own body. Virtually the only part of his body that was still original was his brain, with the rest being a construction of his own design. His brain was protected within a [[brass]] skull that was equipped with an emergency escape device that could ''[[gate]]'' it away to a back-up body if needed.

==Relationships==
Rokh Manti was on good terms with the Harpers.

He was known to have dealings with the [[Shadow Thieves]] of Neverwinter, such as for acquiring [[magic items]] needed to build his inventions.

His [[warlock patron|patron]] was the enigmatic artificer known as [[Kwalish]].

==History==
As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Rokh Manti had designed several devices for the [[cleric]] [[Alfin Biscop]], including a trapped lock mechanism for his vault (made by imprisoning [[imp]]s and [[mephit]]s inside of [[glass]] [[Chess (game)|chess pieces]]) and a [[telescope]] for studying the [[planes]] (made from still-living rogue [[modron]]s).

Several months into the events of the death curse, at the demand of his patron and with funding from the Harpers, Rokh was tasked with traveling to the Positive Energy plane to investigate claims made by Alfin Biscop and other Harper contacts (including [[Szass Tam]]) that the death curse might have been caused by a disruption of the flow of [[positive energy]] to [[Toril]]. To make this trek, he began construction on a vehicle of his own design intended to travel to the [[Positive Energy plane]]. This vehicle was to be made of brass and to resemble a [[xag-ya]] (consisting of a small, spherical cockpit with long tentacles) with "eyes" made of a honeycombed arrangement of ''[[gem of seeing|gems of seeing]]'' to allow him a perfect ability to see into the hazardous plane. The craft was also equipped with the ability to emit pulses of [[negative energy]] as a defense mechanism.While not stated explicitly, Rokh Manti's vehicle is implied to be a variation on the ''[[apparatus of Kwalish]]''. Rokh made use of his Shadow Thieves contacts to acquire the ''gems of seeing'' for this project, and while doing so, he let slip to them that the lock which he had made for Alfin Biscop's vault involved a life-or-death game of chess. The Shadow Thieves used this information to plan a heist of Biscop's mansion, and sent in a skilled chess player named [[Pion]].

| text   = As directed, I have located the current to Toril. A funnel, directing the planeâ€™s energies down towards our world. I have also discovered the anomaly in the current Biscop described... The current has been choked off. It still leads to Toril, but all of it redirected to a singular location there. To Chult.

Rokh ultimately made use of his brass craft to travel to the Positive Energy plane, and he discovered that all of Toril's positive energy was being siphoned directly to [[Chult]]. His craft was destroyed soon after this discovery by a group of xag-ya overwhelming it with positive energy, but his brain managed to ''gate'' back to the [[Prime Material plane]] just in time, allowing him to report back with what he had learned.
