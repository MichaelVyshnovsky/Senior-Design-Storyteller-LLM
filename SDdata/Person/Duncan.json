        "History": "In the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Duncan visited the new [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] and was among a group of people who partook in the three-day-long ritual of Mystra's Sacred Trust that the priests there were pushing, alongside eleven others: [[Durgen Glintstone]], [[Kareem Hastith]], [[Smote]], [[Tholwick Styles]], [[Dava]], [[Mendios]], [[Zephan]], [[Veera Wavecrest]], [[Halish]], [[Kenniwick]], and [[Amnic Basult]]. In the end, Starweaver [[Deinyn Fembrys]] [[Dominate person|''dominated'']] all of them with the ''[[Starry Gnosis]]'', abducting them as part of a secret [[Shar]]ran plot.\n\nHowever, Duncan either resisted the effect or was deemed unsuitable, lacking any magical ability. Duncan, Kenniwick, and Amnic were tortured to death on a rack by Fembrys, then beheaded and had their heads stuffed and mounted in the mad priest's room. Eventually, on [[Eleint 6]], investigators found their bodies and identified them by their possessions.",
