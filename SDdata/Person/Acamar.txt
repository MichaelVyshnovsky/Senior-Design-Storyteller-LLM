'''Acamar''' was a star-like entity from the [[Far Realm]] who had taken a place among stars of [[Realmspace]]. Unlike normal stars, Acamar didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.

==Description==
Acamar was a dead star of utterly black inky nothingness that ate other celestial bodies that drew too close to it.

==Activities==
Acamar and the other Far Realmâ€“infested stars of Realmspace were somehow related to the [[Eldest]].

Acamar's hunger was endless, and when its influence on [[Toril]] was at its peak, it sent its agents, the [[Maw of Acamar|Maws of Acamar]], to devour everything they encountered in their path to sate the hunger of the dead star.

Acamar was usually sought out by some [[warlock]]s to make a pact with it.

==History==
Acamar was one of the stars the warlock [[Japheth Donard]] sought out in [[1396 DR]], after losing his pact with the [[archfey]] [[Neifion]].

In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Acamar, posing as an imaginary lover, taunted [[Skrianna Shadowdusk]].
