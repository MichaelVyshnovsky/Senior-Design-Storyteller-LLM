Kendar Morn was the constable of Daggerdale.
Kendar loved his work. He did not trust people from Mulmaster, Darkhold, or old Zhentil Keep.
Kendar, a member of the Morn family, was chosen as constable of Dagger Falls. In 1479 DR, after an increase in raids by gnolls, he discussed with the mayor the option of hiring a group of Zhent mercenaries to clear the area. Secretly, Kendar did not trust the Zhents and hired an adventuring party to investigate the raids.
