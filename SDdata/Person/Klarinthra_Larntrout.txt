'''Klarinthra Larntrout''' was an [[elf|elven]] [[wine]]maker who lived in the 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Klarinthra Larntrout was renowned for making a strong type of [[mushroom wine]] using [[morel]]s and [[mint]] as main ingredients. The tipple was [[the Simbul]]'s favorite alcoholic beverage. Klarinthra was also a good friend of [[Elminster Aumar]] until her death in the 11{{th}} century DR. Following her death, the Simbul was searching for a new drink that could come close to Klarinthra's recipe in taste and potency.
