'''Ergol Mrauksoun''' was a moneylender and landlord in [[Immerford]] in [[Cormyr]].

==History==
In [[1480 DR]], Ergol and other wealthy citizens went to protest to Lord [[Lothan Durncaskyn]] about an unseen thief and murderer but the lord explained he was busy with two other troubles: a group of outlaws preying upon caravans and a possible crazy wizard in [[Hullack Forest]].
