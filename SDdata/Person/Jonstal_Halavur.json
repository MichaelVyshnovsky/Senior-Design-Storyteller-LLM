        "mainbody": "'''Jonstal Halavur''' was a merchant from [[Var]] who later built his fortune in [[Amn]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Similar to [[Ladrelas Tranth]], Jonstal traveled to [[Athkatla]] in order to enrich himself. At the end of the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]] he also put effort into putting his investments in promising [[Tethyr]]ian nobles who he believed would provide long-term stability. His money allowed for the construction of inns, bridges, roads, warehouses, workshops, and other forms of infrastructure that Tethyr needed, and ensured the rise of the particular nobles who he believed would be sensible stewards of the realm. Thanks in part to his intervention, Tethyr enjoyed a rapid recovery from the destruction of the civil war."
