'''Aconflagblazen''' was a [[red dragon]] who was known as the Steam Snake.

==Activities==
She was known to lair in the sea caves of [[Velmhold]].

==History==
Aconflagblazen seized control of the port known as Velmhold that was previously held by humanoid tribes for many centuries. Prior being owned by such tribes, Aconflagblazen's home had been occupied by the dwarves of [[Clan Gemcrypt]] and [[elves]] from the [[Forest of Tethir]]. After much time, an unknown [[dragon]] slayer killed her. The name of Aconflagblazen's lair had changed over the centuries, and as of [[1352 DR]], was known as the [[Cloister of St. Ramedar]], where [[Ilmatari]] monks lived.
