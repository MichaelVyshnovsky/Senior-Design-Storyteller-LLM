'''Tarntassa''' was a [[human]] woman of the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]]. She was a mage and adventurer.

==Home==
Tarntassa was based at a tower known as [[Tarntassa's Tower]], standing off Sandril's Lane in the western side of Tantras.

==Description==
Tarntassa was easily recognized by her tall stature and very long ponytail of bronze-hued hair.

==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], Tarntassa had apparently disappeared. In fact, she'd traveled to [[Waterdeep]] and there became a friend and ally to [[Khelben Arunsun]]. She also became a secret ally of the [[Harpers]]. Afterward, she returned to Tantras.

==Relationships==
Tarntassa was a friend to the Harpers. Harper agents were welcome at her tower, provided they came quietly under cover of dark.
