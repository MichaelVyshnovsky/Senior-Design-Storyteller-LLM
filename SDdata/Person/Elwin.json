        "mainbody": "Elwin was a pirate hailing from the Sword Coast who settled into a well-paid job in Thays citrus orchards as a sentry and a slave trader in the midâ€“14 century DR. \nLike many people in Thay, Elwins head was clean-shaven. His teeth were broken and his chin was scarred, showing his rough past.\nElwin was a cruel and selfish man. After being charmed he showed affection towards Brenna and her companions, even though he wouldnt have hesitated to sell them into slavery beforehand.\nThe pirate did have a softer side to him one of the small pleasures in life for him was watching the fyreflies in the orchards at night. \nHe wore his two daggers on a strap around his chest. \nElwin was born on the Sword Coast. He spent his life on a pirate ship until a few years prior to 1362 DR, when Elwins ship started selling slaves for Thay. Elwin decided to stay in Thay, having been seduced by the easy life, pay, and labor in the orchards, while doing some slave trading on the side.\nIn 1362 DR, Elwin oversaw a Thayan citrus orchards orc sentries. His patrol came across Harper agents Brenna Graycloak, Galvin, and Wynter. Following a short scuffle, the orcs were restrained by Galvins entangle spell, and Elwin himself was mesmerized into being the Harpers guide to Amruthar by Brennas charm spell.\nThe charmed slavers help did not last though. Later the same night, he brought the Harpers to a small thickly wooded area behind an abandoned barn. The structure stood a few miles away from the orchard, giving them some privacy."
