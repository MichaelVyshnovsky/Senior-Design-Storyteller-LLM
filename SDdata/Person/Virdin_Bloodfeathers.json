        "Description": "Virdin was a young and kind ruler who was much respected by many of his subjects.",
        "History": "Virdin was King of Damara during the [[Vaasan War]] against [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]], although he was still quite young as the decade-long war came to an end in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, when he personally led the Damaran armies at the [[Ford of Goliad]].\n\nVirdin was tricked into believing that a [[magic]] [[wand]] provided to him would enable his army to cross the Ford undetected and defeat the [[Vaasa]]n host. It was widely believed in Damara that he was deceived into believing this by [[Felix]], his own chief lieutenant. Zhengyi was waiting for Virdin to make this mistake, and inflicted a thorough defeat upon the Damaran army while they were helpless in the river. Virdin was on a nearby hill watching these events unfold when he was assassinated by a [[dagger]]. It is believed that Felix was also responsible for this act."
