        "mainbody": "'''Alzarro Rumnthorygh''' was the proprietor of [[Rumnthorygh's Welcoming House]] inn in [[Mosstone]], [[Tethyr]], in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Alzarro Rumnthorygh was a dedicated innkeeper. His establishment was renowned for its cheerful atmosphere and cheap prices. Unfortunately, the tiny inn was always jam-packed with customers, turning the place into chaos with kitchens unable to keep up with orders. In addition, the building was so cramped, Alzarro had to sleep in stables' rafters. Eventually, Alzarro Rumnthorygh was able to expand his inn by building a new wing in the inn's back. The expansion was welcomed, but it also rose prices at the inn to recoup the expenses."
