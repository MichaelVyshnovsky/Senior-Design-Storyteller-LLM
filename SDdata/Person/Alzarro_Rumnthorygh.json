        "mainbody": "Alzarro Rumnthorygh was the proprietor of Rumnthoryghs Welcoming House inn in Mosstone, Tethyr, in the 14 century DR.\nAlzarro Rumnthorygh was a dedicated innkeeper. His establishment was renowned for its cheerful atmosphere and cheap prices. Unfortunately, the tiny inn was always jam-packed with customers, turning the place into chaos with kitchens unable to keep up with orders. In addition, the building was so cramped, Alzarro had to sleep in stables rafters. Eventually, Alzarro Rumnthorygh was able to expand his inn by building a new wing in the inns back. The expansion was welcomed, but it also rose prices at the inn to recoup the expenses."
