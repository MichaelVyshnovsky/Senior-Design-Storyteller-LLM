        "mainbody": "'''Mol''' was a young [[tiefling]] entrepreneur and criminal from [[Elturel]], who began their enterprises during the 1490s [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|We're saving up for a better hideout when we get to Baldur's Gate. Why, you planning on telling me stealing is wrong?|Mol.}}",
        "Description": "Mol had light red skin and two small black horns. Her face was adorned with black markings around her eyes, and gold-colored wrapping around her right horn.",
        "Possessions": "She offered a few interesting items for prospective customers, including an ''[[arrow of Ilmater]]'', a scroll of ''[[Melf's acid arrow]]'', and [[thieves' tools]].",
        "Relationships": "Mol had convinced a number of the tiefling children who were also exiled from Elturel to join her in a life of crime, including [[Arabella]], [[Doni]], [[Mattis]], [[Meli]], [[Silfy]], and [[Zaki]].",
        "History": "[[File:Mol.png|thumb]]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the city of Elturel was pulled down into the [[Nine Hells]] in an event that came to be known as [[the Descent]]. As a result, all the tieflings within were exiled from their home, and forced to live as refugees. Mol and her gang decided to take that opportunity to strike out on their own. They worked as pickpockets, burglars, and con-artists, stealing and scamming what they could from outsiders that encountered the Elturian tiefling community, and even the [[druid]]s of the [[Emerald Grove]] who gave them temporary shelter.\n\nMol did not abide how how the tieflings, especially the children, were treated, and offered them hope of a better life in the big city."
