        "mainbody": "'''Kordin''', more commonly known as '''Alley Cat Kordin''', was a [[human]] cat burglar in [[Tantras]].",
        "Description": "Kordin clad himself in all black, save for a pair of leather boots and a leather belt pouch. He had shoulder-length brown hair streaked with gray, and a gray mustache.",
        "Personality": "As a total lackwit, Kordin was constantly concocting improbable, seriously flawed schemes. He suffered from a serious case of bad luck, made worse by his inadequate intellect.",
        "Possessions": "Kordin owned a pair of ''[[slippers of spider climbing]]'', but they did little to improve his burglaring abilities.",
        "Activities": "All of Tantras knew him by the nickname \"Alley Cat Kordin\", owing to his poor luck and ineptitude. Although he sought recognition for his career as a cat burglar, Kordin would rather people forget about that unfortunate sobriquet."
