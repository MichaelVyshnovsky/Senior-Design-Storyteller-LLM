        "mainbody": "Kordin, more commonly known as Alley Cat Kordin, was a human cat burglar in Tantras.\nKordin clad himself in all black, save for a pair of leather boots and a leather belt pouch. He had shoulder-length brown hair streaked with gray, and a gray mustache.\nAs a total lackwit, Kordin was constantly concocting improbable, seriously flawed schemes. He suffered from a serious case of bad luck, made worse by his inadequate intellect.\nKordin owned a pair of slippers of spider climbing, but they did little to improve his burglaring abilities.\nAll of Tantras knew him by the nickname \"Alley Cat Kordin\", owing to his poor luck and ineptitude. Although he sought recognition for his career as a cat burglar, Kordin would rather people forget about that unfortunate sobriquet."
