|She's a [[cleric]] of [[Shar]]. Can't see why anyone would give their life over to a goddess of darkness and loss myself. But [[Storna Harnwood|Storna]] is a complete and utter fanatic.<br/>She took a bunch of houses that the Night Brigade seized—the very spot where we Rats had our nest, in fact—and spent her cut of the Night Brigade's plunder on turning it into a temple. We lost our home so Storna could glorify her loathsome god.
