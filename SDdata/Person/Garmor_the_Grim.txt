Garmor the Grim was an elder wererat of the Riverside Rats gang, who dwelt in the Wheloon Prison of Cormyr during the late 15 century DR.
As a wererat, Garmor had brown fur and white muttonchops.
Garmor lived in Wheloon Prison with his fellow wererat gangsters until they were forced from their hideout by the Night Brigade under Storna Harnwood, who turned it into a Temple of Shar. After being driven outside the prison, Garmor helped organize a counterattack on the enemy leader, ultimately slaying her and destroying the gang.
