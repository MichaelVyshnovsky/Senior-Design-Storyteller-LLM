'''Z'dusk''' was an [[illithid]] [[psychic warrior]] and [[elocater]] of [[Oryndoll]] who served as a scout for the Council of Oryndoll in the 1370s [[DR]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionics Across the Land}}

Around [[1374 DR]], the Council learned of a lost fragment of an [[avatar]] of the illithid [[deity]] [[Ilsensine]] somewhere in [[Sembia]] (actually buried in a sandy cave on Sembia's coast). The Council hoped to sooth the god's anger by recovering the fragment and sent Z'dusk to retrieve it.

In turn, Z'dusk, remaining cowled and mysterious, hired the [[Stray Thoughts]] company in Sembia to hunt for the fragment, describing it as only a psionic [[artifact]] of unspecified nature and powers, for a 25,000 [[gp]] reward. Taking no chances, Z'dusk and the Council planned to hire a number of other adventurers and mercenaries for the same task, and intended to slay whoever got it first and take it from them, rather than pay up.
