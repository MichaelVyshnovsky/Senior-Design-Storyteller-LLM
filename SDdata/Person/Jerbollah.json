        "mainbody": "Jerbollah was a dwarf cleric of Moradin in Mithral Hall in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nWhile Jerbollah was strong in magic, many of the other clerics of Mithral Hall poked fun at him and enjoyed slapping him on the back of this head.\nIn 1358 DR, King Bruenor held trials to replace the deceased Cobble as Holy Cleric of the Hall. Bruenor Battlehammer awarded Jerbollah a seven out of ten for his brewing of mead dwarven holy water. With the coming of the Time of Troubles, Jerbollah turned his face red instead of casting a red light spell."
