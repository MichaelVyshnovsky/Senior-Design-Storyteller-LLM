Khareesa Hkar was a drow elf slaver of House Hkar in Menzoberranzan.
The drow female was very beautiful with fine facial features, shapely legs, and thick white hair.
Like most drow, Khareesa was wicked and enjoyed making other creatures, such as goblins suffer her wrath.
In battle, Khareesa, clad in suit of drow chainmail, used a fine sword and whip.
In 1357 DR, Drizzt DoUrden journeyed into the Underdark and returned to 
Menzoberranzan. The drow ranger joined a band of slavers, led by Khareesa, and entered the city.
Shortly after returning to Menzoberranzan, Bregan Daerthe soldiers spied Drizzt and traveled to the Isle of Roth√© to interrogate Khareesa about the drow renegade. After revealing Drizzts name, the soldiers backstabbed Khareesa through the kidney, cut her head off, and tossed it at Drizzt when he arrived back on the island.
