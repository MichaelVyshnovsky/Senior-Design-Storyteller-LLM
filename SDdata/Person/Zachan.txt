'''Zachan''' was a villager of [[Highcliff]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Some time before meeting the [[Kalach-Cha]], Zachan received an amulet from his father. This amulet was passed down to his father from his grandfather. The [[amulet]] was [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] and increased constitution and will.

Zachan was in [[Weeping Willow Inn]] when he was attacked by [[bladeling]]s and [[duergar]]. [[Gera]], his wife, asked the Kalach-Cha to rescue him. Once Zachan was rescued, both of them headed for [[Highcliff]].

In Highcliff, he and his wife worried about their lost sons, [[Alex]] and [[Andrew]]. If the Kalach-Cha saved the boys from [[wolves]] at [[Highcliff Castle]], Zachan admitted he told his sons stories to give them more confidence. Nevertheless, he would reward the Kalach-Cha with his amulet.

Finally, the Kalach-Cha encountered Zachan again on the way to Highcliff after the [[King of Shadows]] launched his attack. Zachan and Gera would thank the Kalach-Cha and explain what was going on in Highcliff.
