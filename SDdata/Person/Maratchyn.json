        "Personality": "He was described as overbold.",

        "Relationships": "He apprenticed under [[Khelben Arunsun]] and was acquainted with [[Laeral Silverhand]] and [[Alustriel Silverhand]] both.",
        "History": "In late {{yearlink|1357}}, Maratchyn witnessed Laeral's strength failing; she nearly fainted, and he held her. Then, as she ordered the apprentices to remove all [[magic item]]s from the room in the tower where they were, he witnessed the phantom silhouette of Alustriel speak to her about [[Shandril Shessair]]'s ''[[spellfire]]'' going out of control, and discussing their preparations. Laeral teleported away shortly after, and Khelben turned up, demanding to know what had transpired. He was not satisfied by Maratchyn's account of events, and proposed to review his memories directly, which Maratchyn didn't argue against."
