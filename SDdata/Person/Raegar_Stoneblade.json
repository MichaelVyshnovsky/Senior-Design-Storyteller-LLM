        "mainbody": "'Raegar Stoneblade''' was an [[Church of Oghma|Oghmanyte]] [[rogue]] who gathered intelligence in [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]].",
        "Appearance": "Raegar was trim and muscular with a tattoo on his left shoulder. He had long hair and a dark, close-trimmed beard. He wore a red shirt.",
        "Personality": "Two of Raegar's personal rules were \"never get into a game if you don't know all the players\", and \"make sure you know what you're carrying\".",
        "Possessions": "Raegar wore a magical ring on his left hand that, when activated, could shroud the local area with thick fog that only he could see through. He carried a small mirror in his belt pouch so that he could see unnoticed around corners. Raegar also possessed ''[[boots of spider climbing]]'', and had a [[short sword]] in a scabbard on his right leg.",

            "Encounter with Frostrune and the Blackstaff": "On [[Uktar 28|28 Uktar]] [[1374 DR]], Raegar first met [[Tsarra Chaadren]] and her group in the morning along [[Seaeye's March]] while he spied on them and [[Blackstaff Tower]]. His inadvertent actions outside the tower cause the physical end of Tsarra's friend [[Danthra]]. Later, he and Damlath had brought the [[Diamondblade]] to the [[Sleeping Dragon]] inn, and on his arrival, [[Gamalon Idogyr]]'s green gem eye caused lightning bolts to transmit between it and the blade, destroying the front of the building and a large area of the upper floor.\n\nGamalon Idogyr, Raegar and Damlath survived, but Gamalon's wife, many guards and other bystanders were killed in the incident. While Gamalon was laid low, Damlath (who was possessed by the lich [[Priamon \"Frostrune\" Rakesk]]) stole his gem eye."
