        "mainbody": "aegar Stoneblade was an Oghmanyte rogue who gathered intelligence in Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14th century DR.\nRaegar was trim and muscular with a tattoo on his left shoulder. He had long hair and a dark, close-trimmed beard. He wore a red shirt.\nTwo of Raegars personal rules were \"never get into a game if you dont know all the players\", and \"make sure you know what youre carrying\".\nRaegar wore a magical ring on his left hand that, when activated, could shroud the local area with thick fog that only he could see through. He carried a small mirror in his belt pouch so that he could see unnoticed around corners. Raegar also possessed boots of spider climbing, and had a short sword in a scabbard on his right leg.\nRaeger grew up in the South Ward of Waterdeep. His father was a stone carver and a sail maker, but both his parents died during the Time of Troubles when undead assaulted the city. Raegar ensured his survival by becoming a street thief, and then a stone carver.\nRaegar grew to resent the wizards of Waterdeep because he perceived that they were always causing disaster for the city and were never held to account for these actions. He would take on jobs carving gargoyles or other stone work outside wizards homes and use his skills as a thief to steal scrolls and books.\nRaegar took a job working on the construction of the Font of Knowledge, a temple to Oghma, and began to learn about Oghmas teaching, finding them in accord with his own personal beliefs. In 1365 DR Raegar began working unofficially for Loremaster Gustyl \"the Curious\", a gnome priest, but was forbidden from spying on Maaril the Dragonmage and anyone associated with the Wands clan or Blackstaff Tower.\nAfter Gustyls death in 1371 DR, Raegar began working with Phanar Manthar, who insisted he partner with the wizard Damlath. Together their surveillance and dispatching of Surkhas of Leilon was able to prevent the Arcane Brotherhood from claiming the High House of Thalivar and its secrets.\nOn 28 Uktar 1374 DR, Raegar first met Tsarra Chaadren and her group in the morning along Seaeyes March while he spied on them and Blackstaff Tower. His inadvertent actions outside the tower cause the physical end of Tsarras friend Danthra. Later, he and Damlath had brought the Diamondblade to the Sleeping Dragon inn, and on his arrival, Gamalon Idogyrs green gem eye caused lightning bolts to transmit between it and the blade, destroying the front of the building and a large area of the upper floor.\nGamalon Idogyr, Raegar and Damlath survived, but Gamalons wife, many guards and other bystanders were killed in the incident. While Gamalon was laid low, Damlath (who was possessed by the lich Priamon \"Frostrune\" Rakesk) stole his gem eye.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryRogues\nCategoryWorshipers of Oghma\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\negxcnbhct8jeoqkgaqmplk9gqdsdki3"
