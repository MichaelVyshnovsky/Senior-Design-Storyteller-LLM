Lieutenant '''Rikard Dolban''', known as the '''Black Baron of Tethyr''', was an infamous thug who terrorized peasants during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]].

==Possessions==
Rikard had a black [[chainmail]] [[gauntlet]], which he stole from the royal armory. For this armored glove, he demanded that he be called the Black Baron.

==Activities==
The Black Baron used his stolen black gauntlet while torturing and questioning prisoners of his several employers.

==History==
Rikard hailed from the town of [[Tethammar]], which was outside [[Castle Tethyr]]. He joined the town guard, simply so that he could wield power over his neighbors. When Castle Tethyr fell at the start of the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]] in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}, he saw it as an opportunity for a rise in power. He happened to be on his first night watch at the time. As the castle burned, he and eight companions stole many weapons, slew their commanding officers, and joined the looters. He stole many treasures from the castle, including his namesake gauntlet and a prize [[stallion]].

For several years, the Black Baron and his men raided, murdered, and raped villagers in the plains around the [[Tethyruins]] and the [[Starspire Mountains]]. After growing bored of life as a bandit, he offered his services as an enforcer to several of the petty rulers of Tethyr at that time. He began working for [[Minshak Keseri]], a [[wizard]], in [[1350 DR]], then for [[Pasha]] [[Balik]], who ruled the city of [[Zazesspur]] until [[1364 DR]]. Next, Baron Dolban worked as strong-arm for Baron [[Lutwill]]. and Rikard's final employer was Baron [[Zam]].

Baron Zam was one of the nobles who betrayed Zaranda Star, after having sworn an oath to support her rise to power over the nation. Zam and Rikard joined forces instead with [[Yusuf Jhannivvar]]. During the [[Second Siege of Myratma]], in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Rikard tried to flee the city, but he was captured by [[Onyx the Invincible]] and [[Estemal Talltankard]].

Rikard Dolban was hanged for treason four months after the siege had ended.
