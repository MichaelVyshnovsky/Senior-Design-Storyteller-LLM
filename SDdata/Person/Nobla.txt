'''Nobla''' was an alcohol loving and somewhat dim-witted [[half-orc]]ish crew-member of the ''[[Barracuda (ship)|Barracuda]]'', allied with [[Zhentarim]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Personality==
Unlike his mate [[Wierdnog]], Nobla had no interest nor intelligence to discuss or even care about the ills and faults of society.

==History==
Nobla, like the rest of his crew, was involved in smuggling of illicit goods to an army of [[tanarukk]]a and [[orc]]s, enemies of Daggerford, in exchange for hefty sums of gold and able-bodied slaves. In 1372 DR, Nobla, alongside Wierdnog, was placed on sentry duty in the docks of Daggerford. During their shift, the adventurer, who later would be known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]], approached the duo in attempts of gaining entrance to Captain [[Herab]]'s quarters. While they both were committed to their job, the allure of alcohol was stronger, and the Hero was able to incapacitate both with a sleep-inducing jug of [[Fillian's Brew]]. However, accounts of these events varied. Some claimed that another concoction put them to sleep or that the Hero simply slaughtered both half-orcs.
