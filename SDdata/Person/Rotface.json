        "mainbody": "Rotface was a green hag of the Bloodroot Coven in Twilight Marsh near Phlan in 1489 DR. \nRotface was petty and had a bit of mean streak. She was rude and offensive, with no concern for social rules. In the absence of Deathwallow, she tried to act as the voice of reason but with few results."
