'''Grimak Nailbiter''' was a particularly malevolent [[redcap]] witherer who dwelled in the [[Feydark]] during the late 15{{th}} century of the [[Calendar of Harptos|Faerûnian calendar]].

==Relationships==
Grimak joined with the forces of King [[Malabog]] when the evil [[fomorian]] began a crusade of conquest against the [[elves]] of [[New Sharandar]].

==History==
''Circa'' the  {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Grimak began to use fomorian [[poison]]s to taint great tree roots that intertwined with one another in the [[Gnarlroot Caves]]. This evil act led to the use of a new name for the trees that grew aboveground, which became known as the [[Blighted Grove]].
