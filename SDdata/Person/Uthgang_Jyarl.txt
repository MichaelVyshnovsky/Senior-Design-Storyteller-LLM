Uthgang Jyarl was the head of the Tall Trees druidic order and the reputed Great Druid of the North. 
Not much was known of the goals of the druidic other than their desire to protect that portion of the woods that was once part of Earlann. Very few were allowed access to the Tall Trees enclave save a few allied Harpers, and notable figures of good, with whom they had some mutual alliance. Like most nature faiths, they also sought to keep a balance between wild lands and civilization.  The Deep Glade, the key grove of Silvanus was to be found in Tall Trees.
