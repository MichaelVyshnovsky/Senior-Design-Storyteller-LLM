'''Catanarla the Crimson Cloaked''' was a [[sorceress]] of [[Telflamm]] in [[Thesk]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Following the controversial publication of the first ''[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]'' early in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Catanarla threatened to transform [[Volothamp Geddarm]] into some helpless form and magically subject him to unending torment and agony enough for him to wish for death but never find it.
