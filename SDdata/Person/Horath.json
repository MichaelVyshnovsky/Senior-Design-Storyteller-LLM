        "mainbody": "'''Horath''' was an unlucky shepherd from the outskirts of [[Luskan]] who was killed by a [[dire wolf]] while tending to his [[sheep]] not far from the [[High Road]] ''circa'' [[1490 DR]].",
        "Possessions": "Before his death, Horath briefly wielded his father's [[handaxe]] called ''[[Wolfsbane (handaxe)|Wolfsbane]]'', albeit unskillfully.",
        "History": "Sometime around 1490 DR, Horath agreed to tend to his friend [[Jared]]'s sheep herd outside of [[Luskan]], while Jared himself was happily drinking [[ale]] at the [[Cutlass (inn)|Cutlass]] with Horath's sister. The unlucky shepherd was not informed of the constant threat of [[wolves]] in the area. Horath encountered the [[wolf]] pack leader, a dire wold the size of a [[horse]], luckily, he brought along his father's enchanted handaxe called the ''Wolfsbane''. In the end, Horath was not proficient in handling weapons and fell to the hungry dire wolf. His final thoughts were that Jared intentionally set him to be killed on that task."
