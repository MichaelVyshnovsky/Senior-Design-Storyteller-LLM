        "mainbody": "Horath was an unlucky shepherd from the outskirts of Luskan who was killed by a dire wolf while tending to his sheep not far from the High Road circa 1490 DR.\nBefore his death, Horath briefly wielded his fathers handaxe called Wolfsbane, albeit unskillfully.\nSometime around 1490 DR, Horath agreed to tend to his friend Jareds sheep herd outside of Luskan, while Jared himself was happily drinking ale at the Cutlass with Horaths sister. The unlucky shepherd was not informed of the constant threat of wolves in the area. Horath encountered the wolf pack leader, a dire wold the size of a horse, luckily, he brought along his fathers enchanted handaxe called the Wolfsbane. In the end, Horath was not proficient in handling weapons and fell to the hungry dire wolf. His final thoughts were that Jared intentionally set him to be killed on that task."
