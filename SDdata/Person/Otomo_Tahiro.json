        "History": "In [[1359 DR]] (1433 in the Kozakuran Calendar), Tahiro went to [[Ito-jo]] to destroy the evil inside but he was outmatched, captured, and tortured with magic by an evil [[wu jen]] in the caves deep the castle.\n\nAfter three months, an adventuring party hired by [[Michimori Uemon]] to recover the [[Seven Swords]] came across him. His mind was virtually gone and he was near death. After blabbering about a terrible monster inside the caves (a [[krakentua]]), he finally died."
