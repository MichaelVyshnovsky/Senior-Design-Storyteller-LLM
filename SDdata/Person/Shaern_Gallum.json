        "mainbody": "Shaern Gallum was the Countess-Consort of Count Jordy Gallum, the leader of Greenshores circa 1370 DR, a County in Tethyr located on the Firedrake Shores.\nShaern Gallum hailed from the town of Mosstone of Tethyr. By 1370 DR, Shaern and Jordy Gallum had been married for fifteen years. During their time together, the couple lived in the busy and posh Zazesspur and later in the Counts residence, Kirgard. Shaern appreciated and loved simple life and often found herself uncomfortable with the role of a Countess. She preferred to cook her own food, something that was considered breaking of protocols for a woman of her stature. However out of place she felt in Kirgard, she appreciated that life over the snobbery of Zazesspur."
