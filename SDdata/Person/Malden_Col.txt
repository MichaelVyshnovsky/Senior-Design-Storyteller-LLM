'''Malden Col''' was a follower of [[Caelar Argent]] and a spy who operated for the [[Shining Crusade]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was a devout follower of the Shining Lady's message and a convert of her proselytism.

==Possessions==
Malden kept a notebook that detailed specifics about the Coalition forces, with particular notes about their strengths and weaknesses.

==History==
During the [[war of the Shining Crusade]], Malden managed to infiltrate the [[Coalition]]'s war camp. During his mission, he was able to "borrow" the military code book belonging to [[Simonetta Twoedged]].

While the camp was stationed a short distance away from [[Dragonspear Castle]], the treasure-hunter [[Safana]] accidentally pick-pocketed Malden's notebook. Not knowing which of the soldiers from which she stole was the book's owner, Safana was unable to accurately identify the spy.
