He served alongside his fellow elves, Nimieye and Ehamond among others, under their unit commander Galaeron Nihmedu.
In the , Dynod and his squad came upon a band of Vaasan tomb raiders in the crypts of the reviled Vyshaan elves. They captured the human intruders, along with their leader Vala Thorsdotter, but were convinced by the sorcerer Melegaunt Tanthul to demonstrate mercy.
Dynod kept guard over the prisoners until his commander Galaeron led their group back to Evereska, so the humans could face the citys Hill Elders for judgement.
