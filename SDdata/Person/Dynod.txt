'''Dynod''' was a member of the [[Evereska]]n [[Evereskan tomb guardian|Tomb Guard]] that served his city as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He served alongside his fellow [[elves]], [[Nimieye]] and [[Ehamond]] among others, under their unit commander [[Galaeron Nihmedu]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Dynod and his squad came upon a band of [[Vaasan]] tomb raiders in the crypts of the reviled [[House Vyshaan|Vyshaan]] elves. They captured the [[human]] intruders, along with their leader [[Vala Thorsdotter]], but were convinced by the [[sorcerer]] [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] to demonstrate mercy.

Dynod kept guard over the prisoners until his commander Galaeron led their group back to Evereska, so the humans could face the city's [[Hill Elders]] for judgement.
