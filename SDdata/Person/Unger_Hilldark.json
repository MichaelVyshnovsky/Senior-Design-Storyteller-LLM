        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the famed Athkatlan sculptor Sir [[Sarles]] of the [[Jysstev Estate]] sought {{SI|200|lb|k|long=yes}} of pure [[illithium]] ore to work on a piece commissioned by the [[Church of Helm]]. The only ore merchant in Athkatla at the time who occasionally had access to the elusive material was [[Jerlia]], who ran her business from the [[Waukeen's Promenade]]. Despite Sir Sarles's demands, Jerlia could only get her hands on up to {{SI|50|lb|k|long=yes}} of illithium ore per season. She also revealed that her source of the substance was a duergar merchant, Unger Hilldark, operating out of the [[Copper Coronet]]. Coincidentally, a serial killer named [[Neb]] stole a huge shipment of illithium from Unger around the same time. [[Gorion's Ward]] involved itself in illithium's retrieval from Neb on Unger's behalf, however, the outcome of the task remained unrecorded."
