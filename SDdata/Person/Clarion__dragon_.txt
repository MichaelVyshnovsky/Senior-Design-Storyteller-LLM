'''Clarion''' was a male adult [[silver dragon]].

==History==
He helpedÂ Queen [[Dagnabbet]] of [[Mithral Hall]] transport an elite strike team of six [[dwarven]] warriors, who were charged with carrying out a mission on behalf of the [[Lords' Alliance]], to disable the strongholds of [[cloud giant]]s that floated throughout [[the North]]. Clarion supposedly owed the queen a favor, so he agreed to help the dwarves.
