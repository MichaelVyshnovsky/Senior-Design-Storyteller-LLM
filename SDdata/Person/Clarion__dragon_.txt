Clarion was a male adult silver dragon.
He helpedÂ Queen Dagnabbet of Mithral Hall transport an elite strike team of six dwarven warriors, who were charged with carrying out a mission on behalf of the Lords Alliance, to disable the strongholds of cloud giants that floated throughout the North. Clarion supposedly owed the queen a favor, so he agreed to help the dwarves.
