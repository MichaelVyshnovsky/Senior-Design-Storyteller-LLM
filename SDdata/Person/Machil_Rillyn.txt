Machil Rillyn was an adventurer and member of the Rillyn patriar family of Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR.
He was a determined and highly-motivated man who unfortunately let his ego get the better of him.
While he had accumulated and lost a great deal of treasure in his life, Machil left few possessions to the world after his death, save for old maps and notes about his adventuring days, undelivered correspondence, and other personal effects.
Machil had quite the successful adventurer, having acquired a great amount of wealth over the years.
The veteran mercenary was survived by his niece Yvandre, and Taresson, the Rillyn family butler.
When exploring the ancient library known as the Haven of the Red Quill within the ruins Delimbiyran in the , Machil came across the magical book known as The Scriveners Tale. By uncovering the old tome, Machil inadvertently became afflicted the scriveners mark, a curse that caused the text of the book to gradually cover more and more of their bodys surface as it transformed into shadowglass, a substance associated with the archfey Nintra Siotta, who herself was closely linked with the tome.
In order to learn more about the curse and save himself from a grim fate, Machil traveled to the library-fortress of Candlekeep to the south. Machil then donated the The Scriveners Tale to Candlekeeps scholars, with the stipulation that it be secluded away with other dangerous works and be never read by another living soul.
While the casting was successful and Machil was freed from the scriveners mark, He was tragically slain within a months time, unable to offer an apology to his family for the missteps he had made in life.
