Reading the scrolls at a slower rate, as most others did, would have helped Truesilver retain the information contained within, but it would have also increased his chances of going mad.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2011)/07-06 - The Nether Scrolls, the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar, and the Naja Fountain}} By the time his ten-month period of contemplation ended and he left behind Windsong Tower, the toll of the scrolls had turned his hair white at only twenty-five, and, [[581 DR|after a year]], his prodigious knowledge became limited to certain aspects that he remembered especially well, while the rest, though still useful and far beyond common understanding, he could only half-recall.\n\nSeven years later, in [[588 DR]], Ecamane left behind the City of Song,{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 5}} accompanied by his own students and allies.",
