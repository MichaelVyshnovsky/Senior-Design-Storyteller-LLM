        "mainbody": "camane Truesilver was human wizard and a founding member of the city of Silverymoon, eventually becoming its first elected High Mage. to the North of Faerûn, bringing enlightenment in the form of knowledge, magic, and the arts.\nFor a short period of time in his life, Ecamane Truesilver was the lover of Shalantha Omberdawn, a moon elf and fellow student at the Windsong Tower of Myth Drannor. The wisdom Truesilver could impart also attracted many apprentices to him—including those nine who accompanied the man to Silverymoon—and by the end of his many years of teaching,Though the Silver Marches sourcebook claimed that Aglanthol was Ecamanes nephew on page 57, p. 48 of the \"Cities & Civilization\" book of The North Guide to the Savage Frontier and pp. 82 and 99 of The Grand History of the Realms confirm he was the mans great-nephew. was chief among them. He was named worthy of Ecamanes title as the High Mage of Silverymoon, as was Truesilvers last apprentice, Ederan Nharimlur, who would go on to receive it from Aglanthol. \nEcamane Truesilver was born in the first months of the , and though he originally hailed from the Cormyrean capital of Suzail, his family moved to Myth Drannor by the end of the year. \nBy the , a little over a decade later, Ecamanes acolyteship at the Tower granted him the privileged knowledge of the QuessArTeranthvar, becoming one of the first humans given such an honor. Though the gods help allowed Ecamane to circumvent the need for secret keys which hid certain scrolls, the full extent of the trees wisdom still eluded him. Reading the scrolls at a slower rate, as most others did, would have helped Truesilver retain the information contained within, but it would have also increased his chances of going mad. By the time his ten-month period of contemplation ended and he left behind Windsong Tower, the toll of the scrolls had turned his hair white at only twenty-five, and, after a year, his prodigious knowledge became limited to certain aspects that he remembered especially well, while the rest, though still useful and far beyond common understanding, he could only half-recall.\nSeven years later, in 588 DR, Ecamane left behind the City of Song, accompanied by his own students and allies.\nTruesilver ventured northwards, intent both on making amends for the destruction wreaked by the mages of Netheril, \nIt was nearly four decades after leaving Myth Drannor, in the , that Ecamane Truesilver first arrived at the village that would become Silverymoon. There, he, as well as his nine apprentices, established an academy that would teach the Art as the elves once did. Truesilver asserted they had been brought to the village by the divine will of five goddesses Mystra, Mielikki, Lurue, Sehanine Moonbow, and Eldath.  \nA year later, Ecamane and his apprentices defended the village from an attack by the Granitefang tribe of orcs, which marked the first time that the Silvaeren lost no casualties to the monsters raid. In 629 DR, the wizards founded the Silver Ladys Library to accompany the settlements school, its shelves filled by Truesilvers donation of many rare Myth Drannan books. The Granitefang orcs returned once more in 631 DR and were, again, routed by Ecamane, his apprentices, and the Silvaeren militia, prompting the village to strike out at the tribes own encampent three years later, which they would destroy in the Battle of Brokenfang. \nA decade after his arrival, Silverymoons first set of walls were established, making it a proper city. ruling from atop the Silver Throne, Although his people were mostly illiterate, rough-living trappers and lumberjacks, Truesilver began a tradition of fostering learning and sharing culture among the people.\nSeeing such a diverse population living in harmony, flourishing even in artistic expression and enlightenment, was a beacon for like-minded people across Faerûn. The atmosphere that Ecamane and his colleagues had fostered drew in mages and loremasters from around the continent, who came to the city in 659 DR—aptly named the Year of Mages Dawning by the Silvaeren—for peaceful study and magical research. They had sought to make Silverymoon \"the Myth Drannor of the North\". at the hidden Incanistaeum. Rumors said that Ecamane sent him away, rather than granting Tallrunner the education he desired, to avoid the wrath of his tribesmen, who still roamed the lands near Silverymoon.\nWith a greater number of their populace trained in the Art by 694 DR, Ecamane and twenty-one fellow wizards weaved powerful defensive spells into Silverymoons walls, which some believed later persisted as the wards of Silverymoon. \nAt some point prior to , Ecamane was contacted by one of his citys patron dieties, the Unicorn Queen, Lurue, who encouraged him to write a storybook. This tome, known as Lore of Lurue, described the history of the Silvaeren region long before the citys establishment, on the 30 of Uktar in the . He enchanted a demiplane into the text soon before the Year of the Lost Lance which would physically place its readers into the middle of the recounted events.\nIt was during that year that Ecamane Truesilver participated in the Woodsheart Wars of the Weeping War, bringing his wizardly allies to support the elves at the battle at Silversgate. There, on the 13 of Tarsakh, they fought against the Army of Darkness within Silverymoon Pass. Truesilver, weakened by age, exerted himself too much in destroying the gate with Elminster Aumar, ultimately costing the High Mage his life. and interred in the Crypt of the High Mages beneath a statue of himself wielding a staff of the magi.\nBy the time that Ederan Nharimlur ruled as the third High Mage, in 766 DR, members of the Brotherhood of the Black Hand stole a variety of Ecamanes collected magical items,"
