Lazlo Lunk was a high-ranking officer of Muktar in Turmish in 1358 DR.
Lazlo was a member of the Champions of Muktar. His weapon of choice was his cursed sword. His companions gave him a wide berth in battle.
Lazlo acquired his cursed sword in a game of chance.
In 1358 DR, Lazlo and his fellow Champions arranged a trap inside Fort Blood, planned by the self-styled king of Muktar, Hetep, to eliminate an adventuring party well-known in Golconda.
Later, he led his brigade in the Battle of Wilma Pass.
Lazlo continued to use the cursed sword because it suited his battle-hungry personality.
