'''Lazlo Lunk''' was a high-ranking officer of [[Muktar]] in [[Turmish]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Activities==
Lazlo was a member of the [[Champions of Muktar]]. His weapon of choice was his [[Curse|cursed]] sword. His companions gave him a wide berth in battle.

==History==
Lazlo acquired his cursed sword in a game of chance.

In [[1358 DR]], Lazlo and his fellow Champions arranged a trap inside [[Fort Blood]], planned by the self-styled king of [[Muktar]], [[Yrkhetep|Hetep]], to eliminate an adventuring party well-known in [[Golconda]].

Later, he led his brigade in the [[Battle of Wilma Pass]].

==Personality==
Lazlo continued to use the cursed sword because it suited his battle-hungry personality.
