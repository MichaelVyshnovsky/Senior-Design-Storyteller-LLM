'''Prism''' was a great artist who worked himself to death creating a monument for a woman he loved, yet had only ever glimpsed once.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1368 DR]], the sculptor had stolen emeralds, and retreated close to the [[Nashkel]] mines. There was a bounty on his head, and was being sought out by the bounty hunter, [[Greywolf]]. The legendary artist knew he did not have long, and began to use ''[[potion of speed|potions of speed]]'' to speed up his work. This work was of a statue of a woman he had fallen for. He took the emeralds, and he believed they would represent the spark in her eyes. Prism said that he had only seen her once in the outskirts of [[Evereska]] but did not dare to address her.
