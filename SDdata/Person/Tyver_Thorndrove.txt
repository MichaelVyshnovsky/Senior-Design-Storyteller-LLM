Tyver Thorndrove "the Peacemaker" was a werewolf servant of Selûne and member of the New Moon Pact in the 8 century DR.
As a werewolf, Tyver appeared as a gray wolf.
Tyver served Selûne as a werewolf of the New Moon Pact, fighting against the faiths enemies around Berdusk in the Western Heartlands. In 757 DR, the High Moonmistress Brima Chintamn of Bright Ladys Tower in Chancelgaunt declared the New Moon Pact a heresy, and Tyver was among those captured and executed.
When Feena Archwood investigated the mystery of the New Moon Pact in 1373 DR, Tyvers spirit appeared in her dreams alongside the other members of the Pact to defend and guide her through the challenges to come. After she uncovered Velsinores heresy and they mutually slew each other, Feenas spirit was met by a Shard escort to the afterlife, but Tyver and the other Pact members encouraged her to return to life and join the New Moon Pact herself. With the aid of Julith Harkspurs healing, Feena was revived and ultimately continued the legacy of the Pact.
