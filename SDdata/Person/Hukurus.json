        "mainbody": "Hukurus was a young deepspawn in Undermountain in 1375 DR.\nHukurus resided in a lair in the second level of the dungeon, surrounded by its spawned minions. It never left its lair willingly. It had two spawned grimlocks with it.\nHukurus lived in a deepspawn community in the second level but in 1375 DR the earthquake caused by Halaster Blackcloaks death destroyed a drow base, and the fleeing drow put pressure on the deepspawn. Hukuruss mother abandoned it to save its own life. Hukurus relocated to the southwestern part of the level, where it made its lair.\nHukurus knew itself to be a weak monster, so it was cautious. It could spawn only drow, dwarves, and grimlocks but hoped to eat and spawn other creatures in time."
