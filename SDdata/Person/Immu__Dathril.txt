'''Immué Dathril''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|1066}} to {{yearlink|1104}}.

==Appearance==
Immué had glossy white hair, milky white skin, long ears, and large brown eyes.

==Personality==
Immué had been described as something akin to a "loose cannon", and her sense of humor as "impish".

==History==
Born somewhere in eastern [[Tethyr]], before becoming the [[Magister]], Immué had been part of a series of adventuring bands. At the time that [[Azuth]] offered her the position, she was working as a ship mage for a vessel that hauled cargo up and down the [[Sword Coast]]; [[Azuth]] appeared to her during a particularly severe storm. She let him know of her displeasure, and in response, he created a tunnel of good weather, opening the way to [[Mintarn]].

As Magister, Immué most often stood up for those with less powerful magic against those who were stronger mages. Though her duels were rarely lethal, she seized magic from those she defeated- which made her accumulate foes quickly. Later in her life, she had longer periods of kindness, where besides having affairs with some mages, she aided some in minor ways, and even aided nonmages in other, smaller ways.

In one of her more impish moments, she was remembered for having cast ''[[imbue with spell ability]]'' on all the dancers of a [[Calishite]] nightclub, allowing them to cast ''[[fly]]'' spells by touch.

Immué Darthil finally died in a cavern she reached from [[Undermountain]], where unknown assailants blasted her to pieces and then kept her magically alive as a torso and head of decaying sanity. She was then mercy-killed by [[Nelnfaen Sauntarae]], who took pity on her and employed a mind-meld spell to minimize the pain.

==Rumors & Legends==
Her assailants may have been [[phaerimm]], according to the sources, but also may have been something else.
