        "mainbody": "'''Kazz'Temmet''', the '''Lord of the Infernal Pit''' and the '''Master of the Twelve Blades of Gorgos''', was a [[balor]] summoned by the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] in [[1373 DR]].",
        "Description": "Kazz'Temmet had a pair of powerful [[bat]]-like wings, and skull visage with malice-filled eyes.",
        "Possessions": "The balor wielded one of the [[enchanted]] ''[[Abyssal blade]]s'' that glowed with red radiance. These weapons were given to the most powerful generals of the [[Abyss]].",
        "History": "Kazz'Temmet was a powerful Abyssal general. In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, several influential denizens of the [[lower planes]] were pulled to [[Toril]] by the Order of the Crippled Fang, under the command of [[archwizard]] [[Maganus]]. The cult unleashed the fiends on the [[Moonsea]] region, interrupting trade, sowing destruction, and attacking [[Zhentarim]]-controlled territories. Kazz'Temmet was bound by summonings and put in charge of the attack on the town of [[Voonlar]]. As the balor's armies ravaged the city, cultists assassinated the High Priest of [[Bane]], [[Gormstadd]]. Following the battle, Kazz'Temmet was ordered to stay on the [[Shind Road]] and slaughter anything, especially Zhent forces, that passed. Along with Kazz'Temmet, the cult summoned a powerful [[slaad]] general [[Grazkahn]], with whom the balor shared a long and bloody animosity.\n\nEven magically enslaved, Kazz'Temmet did not abandon his sinister plans. He thought the summoning to be an opportunity. If he were to slay Grazkahn and his slaadi, he would win invaluable time that would allow the blare to break free of magical bondage and stay on Toril of his own free will. Unable to slay the foe personally, Kazz'Temmet tested the [[Hero of Daggerford]] and his allies' mettle by sending fiends against the adventurers. Seeing how formidable the Hero was, Kazz'Temmet offered him a deal: slay Grazkahn and receive power and riches. It was unknown whether the Hero of Daggerford accepted the proposition, slew the field, or left the demon lords to their own business. One thing was sure, Kazz'Temmet had no intention of keeping the promise of the reward."
