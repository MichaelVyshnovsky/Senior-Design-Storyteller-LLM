        "mainbody": "High Priest Malvaya was the chief administrator of the church of the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe had been in this role for some time before the younger Vishnan VII became priest-king, and thus his superior and head of the church.\nMalvaya managed the majority of temple matters, and did so capably. However, he did not like Vishnan, nor did he appreciate the secular issues he had to consider as king. Thus, to get the kings favor for the temples, High Priest Malvaya and fellow senior priests engaged in some minor sabotage, such as inventing reports of unrest at the border to receive more government funds and thus support more temple soldiers. Circa 1357 DR, he even covered up predictions by Kuong diviners that the army of conquest sent to invade Laothan would suffer misfortune. Malvaya desired a disaster to reduce the kings military might so that he must instead subsidize and depend on the temple soldiers to defend the kingdom."
