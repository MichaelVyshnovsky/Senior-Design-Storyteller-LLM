        "mainbody": "'''Ulraunt''' was the [[Keeper of the Tomes]] of [[Candlekeep]] as early as [[1368 DR]]. He was known to be a proud and haughty [[wizard]].",
        "Description": "Ulraunt's nickname among the library's acolytes, \"the Old Buzzard\", was given to him due to his facial features - large nose, dark eyes, [[hawk]]'s gaze, and sharp tongue. The unflattering name eventually became quite common among many residents of the Sword Coast.",
        "Possessions": "Ulraunt is reputed to carry a staff of office with him that has the powers of a ''[[staff of the magi]]'', in addition to more potent powers. This staff of office also has a token built into it known as a ''[[glow stave]]''. He owned a ''[[wand of sleep]]'' and wore a ''[[mage robe of fire resistance]]'' ''circa'' [[1368 DR]].",
        "Abilities": "Ulraunt was a competent wizard and had numerous spells scribed in his ''[[spellbook]]'', including ''[[improved invisibility]]'', ''[[flame arrow]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[Aganazzar's scorcher]]'', ''[[chromatic orb]]'', among others.",
        "Relationships": "[[Tethtoril]], the [[First Reader]] of [[Candlekeep]] ''circa'' 1372 DR was often mistaken for Ulraunt by visitors because of his scholarly attitude, demeanor, bearing, and intelligence. Ulraunt was embittered at Tethtoril for that.\n\nUlraunt's personal life was filled with rumors and obfuscations. Folk claimed that he was involved with young ladies of several Waterdhavian and Tethyrian noble houses in his youth. Rumors that floated ''circa'' 1368 DR connected Ulraunt to haughty [[elven]] ladies from [[Evermeet]].",
        "Activities": "Ulraunt ordered all petitioners who sought access to the vast libraries of Candlekeep to share at least one eveningfeast, seating to the mage's left side and diligently entertain the Keeper of the Tomes by answering his questions.\n\nReportedly, Ulraunt's expansive collection of spell eclipsed that of most spellcasters in Faerûn. Some people claimed that the old wizard practiced his spellcraft regularly in his personal chamber and in depths of Candlekeep's catacombs and caverns. His overall goals remain unknown to most, apart from the wizard's desire to make Candlekeep the center of scholarly studies and a political power.",
        "History": "Sometime after [[712 DR]], then young Ulraunt got his hands on a supremely rare book, ''[[Lore of Lurue]]''—a tome penned by [[Ecamane Truesilver]], the first [[High Mage]] of [[Silverymoon]]. Young traveling [[monk]] used this rare opportunity to gain access to Candlekeep, eventually becoming its Keeper of the Tomes.\n\nIn 1368 DR, entry to Candlekeep was allowed only to those to those who were able to contribute a [[tome]] of great knowledge by the orders Ulraunt. No-one was exempt to these sanctions, even inhabitants of the library, such as [[Abdel Adrian]].\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], [[Manshoon Prime]], the eldest of the [[Manshoon]] clones forged a secrecy alliance with Ulraunt after providing him with seven extremely rare volumes, including ''[[Pharaudo's Tome]]'' in exchange for asylum.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Cloak & Dagger]]'' stated that Ulraunt was a First Reader of Candlekeep, rather than the Keeper of the Tomes. This minor discrepancy was likely due to later timeline adjustments or simply an editorial error. He was named the Keeper as early as 1368 DR in ''[[Baldur's Gate (game)]]'' and ''[[The Lost Library of Cormanthyr]]''.\n\nAs of [[1372 DR]], Ulraunt remained the Keeper of the Tomes. Following the apotheosis of mortals [[Mystra]] and [[Cyric]], Ulraunt was tempted by the mad god but Tethtoril managed to keep the haughty wizards out of following Cyric or other dark powers. In [[1375 DR]], Ulraunt greeted and dined with the adventurers who opposed the returned [[Netherese]] enclave - [[Thultanthar]]. The frugal dinner included thin [[soup]], stale [[bread]], boiled vegetables, and diluted [[wine]]. The adventurers were pelted with questions about their quest, their goals, and what they were hoping to find among the endless bookshelves of Candlekeep."
