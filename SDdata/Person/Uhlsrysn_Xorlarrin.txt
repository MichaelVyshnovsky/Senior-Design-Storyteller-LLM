Uhlsrysn Xorlarrin was a member of House Xorlarrin and a master of Sorcere in 1479 DR.
The drow had a prickly pride, always feeling himself inferior to his brother and he was easily provoked.
Uhlsrysn was a talented transmuter, known especially for his transmutations of goblin slaves into terrible monsters.
Uhlsrysn was the secondboy of House Xorlarrin, but because the elderboy was a more talented wizard, Uhlsrysn was chosen to remain as an instructor at Sorcere.
