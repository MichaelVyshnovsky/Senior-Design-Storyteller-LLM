        "Description": "Tender Henk was a gruff and unfriendly [[half-orcish]] man with a shaggy mop of black hair. He offered sub-par service to the tavern's guests.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Tender Henk ran The Singing Lute, a tiny waterside tavern that overlooked the [[Counting House]] and the city's [[Gray Harbor]]. [[Honk]], a fellow half-orc who had a similar appearance and attitude to Henk's, was known to tend to The Singing Lute when Henk was indisposed. Their similarities implied a blood relation. Honk insisted that Henk played his [[lute]] in the kitchen during the off hours.\n\nDuring the same period of time, Henk posted an ad, searching to hire a [[drum]]mer for the Lute's pickup band."
