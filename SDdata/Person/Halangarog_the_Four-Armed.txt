'''''Halangarog the Four-Armed''''' was one of the [[Tharkul]]s of [[Thar]], legendary for abdicating from the position of power, sometime before [[1372 DR]], simply because he was sick of it all.

==History==
During his reign, Halangarog the Four-Armed was served by seven [[oni mage]] advisors. They were impressed with the ruler's mastery of weaponry from the countries to the east of [[Faer√ªn]] and gifted him the ''[[Seven Stars of Halangarog]]'', enchanted [[shuriken]]s, imbued with their life force and weaved in powerful enchantments. The oni advisers looked forward to seeing these powerful weapons in combat, but that was never to be. Halangarog infamously gave up the throne before the shrikes ever taste blood. The ruler simply was fed up with the job. He left the seat of power and Thar itself, becoming the only Tharkul ever to do so and the only Tharkul not to die on the throne.
