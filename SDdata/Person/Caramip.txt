'''Caramip''' was a female [[rock gnome]] living in [[Gnomengarde]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Caramip, like most of Gnomengarde's inhabitants, looked up to the master inventors [[Dabbledob Plasterpatch]] and [[Fibblestib Pinebark]], and would refer visitors to them rather than answer any questions herself.

==Abilities==
Just like the other [[gnome]]s in Gnomengarde, Caramip had some training as a [[wizard]].
