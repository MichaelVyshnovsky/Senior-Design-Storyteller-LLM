Caramip was a female rock gnome living in Gnomengarde in the late 15 century DR.
Caramip, like most of Gnomengardes inhabitants, looked up to the master inventors Dabbledob Plasterpatch and Fibblestib Pinebark, and would refer visitors to them rather than answer any questions herself.
Just like the other gnomes in Gnomengarde, Caramip had some training as a wizard.
