'''Naahal''' was a [[whale]] bard until [[1369 DR]].
 
==History==
Born in [[613 DR]], Naahal become the leader of the largest pod of [[humpback whale]]s. His main duty was to lead the whalesongs of [[Serôs]].

In [[Eleasias]] of 1369 DR, during the [[Twelfth Serôs War]], in order to gain the total trust of his [[sahuagin]] subjects, [[Iakhovas]] hunted and killed Naahal.

His death was deeply mourned by his fellow whales.
