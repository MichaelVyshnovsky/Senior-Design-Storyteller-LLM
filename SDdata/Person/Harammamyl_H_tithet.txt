'''Harammamyl H'tithet''' was the main [[drow]] delegate in [[Mantol-Derith]].

==Personality==
Harammamyl hid well her disgust for other races and even understood that a little false compassion helped in business.

==History==
Harammamyl was a member of the merchant [[House H'tithet]]. In [[1372 DR]], she became a delegate to Mantol-Derith after assassinating her predecessor, [[Yyssisiryl H'tithet]]. However, the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]] prevented travel to her home city and for the time, Harammamyl, like [[Kassawar Plickenstint]], had very little to do.
