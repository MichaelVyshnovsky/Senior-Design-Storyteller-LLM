Harammamyl Htithet was the main drow delegate in Mantol-Derith.
Harammamyl hid well her disgust for other races and even understood that a little false compassion helped in business.
Harammamyl was a member of the merchant House Htithet. In 1372 DR, she became a delegate to Mantol-Derith after assassinating her predecessor, Yyssisiryl Htithet. However, the Siege of Menzoberranzan prevented travel to her home city and for the time, Harammamyl, like Kassawar Plickenstint, had very little to do.
