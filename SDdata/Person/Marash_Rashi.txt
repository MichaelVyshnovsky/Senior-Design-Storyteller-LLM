Marash Rashi was a barbarian merchant and member of the Kashghun tribe in the Plain of Horses circa . Based in the city of Chegoyui in the Quoya Desert, Rashi was the best trader in livestock there. 
Rashi was quite aged, having squinting eyes, showing no teeth when he smiled, and having a bowed back on an already short build.
Nevertheless, Rashi was still a sharp-witted and merchant and negotiator who was adept at setting people at ease and tricking them out of their money. Although honest, he was crafty and opportunistic.
Rashis specialty was trading in horses and other kinds of livestock. Highly resourceful, he could acquire almost any animals, goods, or services that could be found on the Plain of Horses. Owing to this, he was a preferred partner of Shou traders who made the journey from Shou Lung. He would even trade with enemies of the Kashghun, if their money was good.
Usually, he made multiple bargains with each customer, in the process entangling them in long-term debt. For example, to a soldier looking to purchase a new horse, Rashi would generously offer the horse on credit. Next, they would haggle over the value of the horse, then settle the price that would be paid for it, and finally negotiate the terms and schedule for payment. Often, Rashi declined coin and instead asked for hides or livestock, even for beasts not yet grown. Continuing the example, Rashi would choose ten lambs from the soldiers flock, to be collected once mature. However, at that time, Rashi would declare a few of the sheep were still immature. At this point, he offered to extend credit into the next season, and claim another one or two lambs as interest. In this way, he could extend credit nearly indefinitely and trap the soldier in a cycle of debt.
Fortunately for Rashi, he was the brother-in-law of the yagbhu (the vice-ruler of the tribes ruling qaghan) and could call on government enforcers, guaranteeing that his debtors must pay or they would face the guards.
