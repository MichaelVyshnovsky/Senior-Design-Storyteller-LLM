        "mainbody": "Imbrar Heltharn I, known as Imbrar the Lost, was the ninth Paladin-King of Impiltur and the second ruler of the Heltharn Dynasty.\nThrough his father, Imphras I, he was a descendant of a line of paladins related to the Durlarven Dynasty by marriage, through one of the sisters of King Bellodar III.\nMost scholars believed that Imbrar bore the magic sword Dornavver when he went to war against the hobgoblins of the Giantspire Mountains. Others claim that he in fact gave the sword to his general, Osper Wellhaven.\nBorn in 1098 DR, Imbrar was the eldest son of King Imphras I and Queen Sambral. He was a paladin like his father before him.\nImbrar became king in 1122 DR at his fathers death. His short reign ended in 1127 DR when he vanished during a military campaign against the hobgoblins of the Giantspire Mountains. His sister had observed the hobgoblins rebuilding their forces through one of the Scrying Stones, so the king had marched against them. Neither the army nor the hobgoblins were ever seen again. With grief, Ilmara took the throne after her lost brother.\nWhat Ilmara never learned was that her brother had been changed into a death knight by the succubus Soneillon."
