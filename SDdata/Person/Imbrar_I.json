        "Possessions": "Most scholars believed that Imbrar bore the magic sword ''[[Dornavver]]'' when he went to war against the [[hobgoblin]]s of the [[Giantspire Mountains]]. Others claim that he in fact gave the sword to his general, [[Osper Wellhaven]].",
        "History": "Born in [[1098 DR]], Imbrar was the eldest son of King Imphras I and Queen Sambral. He was a [[paladin]] like his father before him.\n\nImbrar became king in [[1122 DR]] at his father's death. His short reign ended in [[1127 DR]] when he vanished during a military campaign against the hobgoblins of the Giantspire Mountains. His sister had observed the hobgoblins rebuilding their forces through one of the [[Scrying Stones]], so the king had marched against them. Neither the army nor the hobgoblins were ever seen again. With grief, Ilmara took the throne after her lost brother.\n\nWhat Ilmara never learned was that her brother had been changed into a [[death knight]] by the [[succubus]] [[Soneillon]]."
