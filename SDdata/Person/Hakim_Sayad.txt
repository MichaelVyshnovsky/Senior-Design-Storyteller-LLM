Hakim Sayad was the owner of Clothes for the Enlightened within the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Hakim was portly, even for an ogre. His smile was hideous even though his intentions were sincere. Hakim always dressed himself in the latest fashions sweeping through the City of Delights.
Hakim owned and operated his shop within the Grand Bazaar, catering to rich clientele and even a few members of the Court of Enlightenment.
He purchased all of the fine silk used for making his garments from the House of Al-Kamari.
