'''Hakim Sayad''' was the owner of [[Clothes for the Enlightened]] within the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Hakim was portly, even for an [[ogre]]. His smile was hideous even though his intentions were sincere. Hakim always dressed himself in the latest fashions sweeping through the City of Delights.

==Activities==
Hakim owned and operated his shop within the Grand Bazaar, catering to rich clientele and even a few members of the [[Court of Enlightenment]].

He purchased all of the fine silk used for making his garments from the [[House of Al-Kamari]].
