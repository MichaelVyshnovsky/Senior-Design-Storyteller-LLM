Sadalar was a crinti warchief living in Dambrath during the 12th century DR.
Sadalar was the consort of queen Melanith.
Under direct appointment from Queen Melanith, Sadalar became the first male named warchief of Dambrath. Bribery and corruption plagued his time as warchief.
As warchief, Sadalar used his influence raising the standard of life for the arkaiun living in Dambrath, eventually elevating them to second-class citizens as opposed to slaves.
Sadalar perished during the battle with the deep gnome city of Aventine.
