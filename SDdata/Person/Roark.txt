'''Roark''' was a tavernkeeper and the owner-proprietor of the [[Uphill Climb]] in [[Caer-Dineval]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a middle-aged man as of the late 1480s DR, with a weathered and rough sort of handsomeness.

==Activities==
Roark was known for buying only the finest libations for his tavern, favoring the good food of [[Bryn Shander]] and the best honey wine made in [[Good Mead]].{{Template:Cite book/Legacy of the Crystal Shard/Campaign Guide|22}}

==History==
When the ''[[Everlasting Rime]]'' spread across [[Icewind Dale]], around the {{yearlinkName|1489}}, Roark's tavern out of both [[beer]] and liquor and its business suffered.

When the [[Knights of the Black Sword]] took over [[Keep at Caer-Dineval|Caer-Dineval's keep]], Roark nudged [[adventurer]]s in their direction in the hopes they would uncover its mysterious goings-on.
