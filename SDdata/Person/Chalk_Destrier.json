        "mainbody": "The '''Chalk Destrier''' was a bizarre [[spellscarred]] creature made of animate stone. It became a collector, residing in the [[Plaguewrought Lands]] near [[Ormpetarr]] since the [[Spellplague]].",
        "Description": "The Chalk Destrier was a sleek, centaur-like creature with a body made of glowing white stone, like [[chalk]], except that its surface was smooth like milk.{{cite book/Plague of Spells|249-255|18}}",
        "Personality": "A bizarre creature, it sought to trade secrets for gifts and other secrets. Sometimes, it took people as trophies out of its own initiative rather than enforce an exchange.",
        "Abilities": "The creature turned red in combat, actually becoming red-hot. It could transform one of its arms into a blade, and it was incredibly fast. Beyond those powers, it wielded some degree of control over the stone of its home, and it had some ability to limit and thwart extradimensional access into its abode.",
        "Possessions": "The creature resided at the end of a canyon-like fissure along the ground, which had multiple bands of different colors at different depths, some crystalline and some suspiciously fleshlike. At the end of that canyon, there was an open space with modified constellations, and two miles or so ahead, an incredibly tall, horizon-spanning wall of what resembled chalk; per [[Cynosure (construct)|Cynosure]], it was a fallen moon of a different world, possibly native to Abeir.{{cite book/Plague of Spells|246-248|18}}\n\nIts collection included oversized shields, magic swords, bejeweled staves, enchanted garments, and a number of preserved bodies. The bodies were not just those of game animals and monsters, but a number of preserved [[undead]] and stuffed, posed [[humanoids]] still wielding their [[enchanted|magical]] gear. Until the {{YearlinkName|1396}}, it also included the sword ''[[Angul]]''.",
        "Activities": "After the [[Spellplague]], the Chalk Destrier mostly traded secrets for gifts and other secrets. Sometimes it collected trophies out of creatures.",
        "Relationships": "[[Grandmother Ash]] considered it an enemy.",
        "History": "Per [[Grandmother Ash]], the Chalk Destrier had become empowered during the [[Spellplague]] of {{yearlink|1385}}, though the tree also said that its mind had been corrupted during the event, suggesting that it understood the Chalk Destrier as having existed previously already. It was possibly native to Abeir.\n\nIn 1396 [[DR]], [[Raidon Kane]], guided by Cynosure's voice, visited the Chalk Destrier looking to recover ''[[Angul]]'', and inquired about the whereabouts of [[Kiril Duskmourn]], [[Thormud Horn]], and [[Xet]]. The chalk destrier demanded a secret in return; Cynosure remotely volunteered that the [[elf|elven]] realm of [[SildÃ«yuir]] had fallen back into the [[Feywild]]. Then the chalk destrier admitted that it had granted the three of them a one-way trip to [[Abeir]] in return for the elven [[sword]] ''Angul''.\n\nAfter Raidon and Cynosure requested an opportunity to gaze upon ''Angul'', the destrier allowed them to look at its collection, but decided to take Raidon himself as payment, by turning him into a trophy. Raidon was able to recover ''Angul'', but found the blade to be ineffective against the destrier. Cynosure managed to pull Raidon out just in time, teleporting him out of the location.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The Chalk Destrier related that the soul in ''Angul'' was [[human]], rather than that of a [[star elf]]. It was unclear whether it didn't know, didn't care, or couldn't tell the difference."
