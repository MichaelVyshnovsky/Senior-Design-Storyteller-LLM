        "mainbody": "The text is ambiguous on whether the lunar fragment or the Chalk Destrier itself is the one possibly native to Abeir.\nThe Chalk Destrier was a bizarre spellscarred creature made of animate stone. It became a collector, residing in the Plaguewrought Lands near Ormpetarr since the Spellplague.\nThe Chalk Destrier was a sleek, centaur-like creature with a body made of glowing white stone, like chalk, except that its surface was smooth like milk.\nA bizarre creature, it sought to trade secrets for gifts and other secrets. Sometimes, it took people as trophies out of its own initiative rather than enforce an exchange.\nThe creature turned red in combat, actually becoming red-hot. It could transform one of its arms into a blade, and it was incredibly fast. Beyond those powers, it wielded some degree of control over the stone of its home, and it had some ability to limit and thwart extradimensional access into its abode.\nThe creature resided at the end of a canyon-like fissure along the ground, which had multiple bands of different colors at different depths, some crystalline and some suspiciously fleshlike. At the end of that canyon, there was an open space with modified constellations, and two miles or so ahead, an incredibly tall, horizon-spanning wall of what resembled chalk per Cynosure, it was a fallen moon of a different world, possibly native to Abeir.\nIts collection included oversized shields, magic swords, bejeweled staves, enchanted garments, and a number of preserved bodies. The bodies were not just those of game animals and monsters, but a number of preserved undead and stuffed, posed humanoids still wielding their magical gear. Until the , it also included the sword Angul.\nAfter the Spellplague, the Chalk Destrier mostly traded secrets for gifts and other secrets. Sometimes it collected trophies out of creatures.\nGrandmother Ash considered it an enemy.\nPer Grandmother Ash, the Chalk Destrier had become empowered during the Spellplague of , though the tree also said that its mind had been corrupted during the event, suggesting that it understood the Chalk Destrier as having existed previously already. It was possibly native to Abeir.\nIn 1396 DR, Raidon Kane, guided by Cynosures voice, visited the Chalk Destrier looking to recover Angul, and inquired about the whereabouts of Kiril Duskmourn, Thormud Horn, and Xet. The chalk destrier demanded a secret in return Cynosure remotely volunteered that the elven realm of SildÃ«yuir had fallen back into the Feywild. Then the chalk destrier admitted that it had granted the three of them a one-way trip to Abeir in return for the elven sword Angul.\nAfter Raidon and Cynosure requested an opportunity to gaze upon Angul, the destrier allowed them to look at its collection, but decided to take Raidon himself as payment, by turning him into a trophy. Raidon was able to recover Angul, but found the blade to be ineffective against the destrier. Cynosure managed to pull Raidon out just in time, teleporting him out of the location.\nThe Chalk Destrier related that the soul in Angul was human, rather than that of a star elf. It was unclear whether it didnt know, didnt care, or couldnt tell the difference."
