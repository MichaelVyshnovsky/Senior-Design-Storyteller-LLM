        "mainbody": "yorli was the female rat familiar of Gromph Baenre, the Archmage of Menzoberranzan.\nGromph and Kyorli were relatively close and affectionate with one another.  She had a rats intelligence, however, and was easily distracted.\nKyorli couldnt see well in the dark (at least compared to a drow) and was colorblind. Gromph could communicate with her mentally.\nIn 1372 DR, Kyorli aided Gromph in escaping from the lichdrow Dyrrs imprisonment spell. She temporarily acted as Gromphs eyes after he was blinded by his attack on Nimor Imphraezl. When Gromph received an eye transplant, Gromph forced Kyorli to eat out his blind eyes so that Jaemas Xorlarrin could cast a spell to transplant the newly retrieved eyes to Gromph."
