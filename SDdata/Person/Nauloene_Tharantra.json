        "mainbody": "auloene Tharantra was a notorious hedonist and businesswoman living in Waterdeep in the latter half of the 14th century DR.\nJudging by her nickname and her profession, she was probably a redhead who honored Sune, but this is uncertain. She lived on Sevenlamps Cut in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep. Her last known public appearance was sometime around the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, when she stood on the stage of the Splendid Falcon theater and dancehall (also in the Castle Ward) and announced that she was looking to marry again, stating she felt sufficient time had passed since enduring her last husbands cruel nature. She wore a sparkling gown made of chains in a crisscross pattern adorned with blue diamond teardrop pendants dangling from various locations.\nShe was a lady of pleasure, known to be free-loving and free-spending.\nFor many years, Nauloene was the manager and hostess of the Heartflame festhall on Snail Street in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep until it burned down on the Night of Pirates in Uktar, the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR.\nNauloene was married nine times before her announcement on the stage of the Splendid Falcon theater. Five of her husbands died two fled Waterdeep citing personality and lifestyle conflicts one was exposed as a doppelganger and killed in the streets of Waterdeep and the ninth husband, merchant Mharelk Thorlkan from Innarlith, she threw out and paid to have the marriage dissolved.\nThe rumors in Waterdeep were that Nauloene had a hand in the death of at least two of her husbands."
