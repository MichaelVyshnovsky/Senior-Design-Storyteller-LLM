        "mainbody": "Akyid al-Neti was the Headmaster of Al-Bidir Sallah, or the \"Home of the Seekers of Knowledge\", which was located in Huzuz, in 1367 DR.\nAkyid was a half-elven male sorcerer.\nAkyid lectured for several hours each week covering the finer points of magic. His audience for these lectures was composed of wizards of at least moderate skill.\nForeign wizards wishing to study at the College of Magic were first interviewed by Akyid to determine their motives. These interviews were conducted while Akyid wore a ring of truth so he could discern if the applicants were lying to him.\nAkyid was also the dean of the College of Magic and the third such person to hold the title of Dean and Headmaster at the University.\nHe believed that anyone possessing a modicum on intelligence could learn at the least basic magical skills."
