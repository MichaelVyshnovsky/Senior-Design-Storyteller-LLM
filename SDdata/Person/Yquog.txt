'''Yquog''' was a [[barghest]] whelp member of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''My name is Yquog, to answer the first part of your question. What I am is a barghest whelp. And do not look upon me and make rash judgments, adventurer—believe me when I say you look exceptionally foul to mine eyes as I probably do to yours.''|Yquog}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] was besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved teleporting [[goblin]]s from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. The next attack came as a direct assault on the town's palisades. Lord [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]] of Targos ordered a group of mercenaries from [[Luskan]] to follow two of his scouts, [[Ennelia]] and [[Braston]], southeast to the goblin fortress.

The fortress and the caves underneath were not just occupied by goblins but also by other [[monstrous humanoids]] and [[Iyachtu Xvim]]–worshiping monsters, including barghests in various stages of life. Yquog was one of them and harbored a grudge against another member of the Legion. Unlike other creatures of the Legion, Yquog was more interested in exchanging favors with the [[adventurer]]s after they infiltrated the fortress's caves. A [[Dekanter goblin]] named [[Kruntur]] stole a message sent to Yquog by its master, and failure to follow the message's instruction would incur wrath and dire punishment. Yquog wanted the adventurers to retrieve the message from Kruntur, preferably without slaughtering him and the other Dekanter goblins. As a payment for the service, Yquog offered an [[enchanted]] item taken off the corpse of an unlucky adventurer. It was revealed that Kruntur stole the message because Yquog stole [[Tamjan's bracers|magical bracers]] from his brother, and Kruntur wanted them back. It was unrecorded if the adventurers from Luskan negotiated the exchange of the message for the bracers or decided to move forward using more violent methods.
