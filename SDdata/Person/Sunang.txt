'''Lord Sunang''' was a ruler in [[Kara-Tur]] in the mid–12th century [[DR]].

When the forces of a mighty [[wu-jen]] laid siege to his lands, Lord Sunang was forced to make alliances and purchase magical weapons, such as the ''[[blade of the elements]]'', which was designed to slay [[elemental]]s. However, this strategy proved very costly: Sunang was near-bankrupted and his influence waned, while his enemy continued to grow in power. Ultimately, Sunang's realm collapsed from its own weaknesses, not to conquest. It was supposed that the profit-hungry merchants supplied arms to both sides, but proof was lost to history.
