Lord Sunang was a ruler in Kara-Tur in the midâ€“12th century DR.
When the forces of a mighty wu-jen laid siege to his lands, Lord Sunang was forced to make alliances and purchase magical weapons, such as the blade of the elements, which was designed to slay elementals. However, this strategy proved very costly Sunang was near-bankrupted and his influence waned, while his enemy continued to grow in power. Ultimately, Sunangs realm collapsed from its own weaknesses, not to conquest. It was supposed that the profit-hungry merchants supplied arms to both sides, but proof was lost to history.
