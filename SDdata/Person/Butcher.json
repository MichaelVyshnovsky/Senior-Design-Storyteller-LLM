        "mainbody": "The Butcher was one of the followers of Gorgomorz, Daggerfords Devil, along with numerous orcs and tanarukka, and was the chieftain of a goblin tribe from the Delimbiyr Vale, circa 1372 DR.\nThe Butcher was fierce but dim-witted.\nThe Butcher was armed with a simple in appearance but enchanted bludgeon, called Big Board with Nail. He carried several bottles of magic Goblins Grog, a colorful alcoholic concoction that could render its imbiber invisible.\nIn 1372 DR, the Butcher and his cave goblin tribe allied with Gorgomorzs army of orcs and tanarukka. A part of the army established a hideout in caves underneath the Wild Pastures of Liams Hold. Despite orders, the Butcher ordered his goblins to abduct cows from the local shepherds. The strange occurrence attracted the attention of the Hero of Daggerford, who agreed to help the shepherds in investigating the disappearances. Eventually, goblin tracks led the Hero towards the well-hidden goblin lair. The adventurer walked in on the Butchers attempts at convincing his tanarukk superior that the cow carcass the goblin was standing on was, in fact, a cow-shaped rock. Eventually, the inhabitants of the caves attacked the trespasser and perished in the process."
