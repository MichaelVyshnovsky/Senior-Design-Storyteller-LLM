Thear was a dwarven cleric of Tempus who resided in Shadowdale.
Thears face was dominated by a sizable nose, framed by a mane of shoulder-length white-and-gray hair with a matching beard. He wore dark green robes underneath his armor.
He had a reputation for flying into fits of rage, typical for clerics of his religion.
In addition to his enchanted suit of plate mail, Thear owned an extremely potent magical warhammer.
Owing to his explosive temperament, the residents of Shadowdale tended to avoid Thear. He was very interested in purchasing a warhorse, but had trouble finding a suitable mount he found horses too large, and ponies too scrawny.
