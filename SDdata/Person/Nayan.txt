'''Nayan''' was a leader of the [[Shadowmasters of Telflamm]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1374}}, after [[Mask]] stopped answering their prayers, Nayan led a small band of Shadowmasters to find the First and Second [[Chosen]] of Mask in order to receive a sign of the god. They found [[Drasek Riven]] and waited until the arrival of [[Erevis Cale]]. When the two Chosen met Nayan and his companions, they sensed the will of Mask at work and agreed to help their mission to infiltrate the [[Hole]] prison in [[Yhaunn]].

The mission was successful despite the sacrifice of one of Nayan's companions. Cale instructed Nayan to take [[Endren Corrinthal]] back to his son [[Abelar Corrinthal]]. Nayan did so, then tried to hire Nayan and his men to fight in the [[Sembian Civil War]] but Nayan dismissed the offer, saying he only fought for his god. During the fighting against [[Kesson Rel]], Nayan and all his companions, beside [[Vyrhas]], were empowered by Erevis Cale in order to fight better in the upcoming battle.
