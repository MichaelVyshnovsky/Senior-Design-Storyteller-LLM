Grisha was a human cultist of Yeenoghu in the Labyrinth in the late 15 century DR.
Grisha was a slave of the drow until he escaped and made his way to the very small village of Filthriddens inside the Labyrinth. There, he lived under constant fear of minotaur raiders.
Circa 1482 DR, Grisha saw a minotaur horde march against the village but then be destroyed by the demon lord Yeenoghu. So Grisha devoted himself to the gnoll god and soon the cult of Yeenoghu gained control of Filthriddens with Grisha as their leader.
A strict ruler, Grisha believed he sensed the power of Yeenoghu in all things and that he was behind the cultists being resurrected as ghouls after they died.
