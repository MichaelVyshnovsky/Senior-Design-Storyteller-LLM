Nar'l was so successful that he became the only advisor of the Xanathar.\n\nIn [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} however, Nar'l was worried about the growing paranoia of the beholder, who'd started to suspect something about the drow.",

        "Relationship": "Nar'l had always at his side a [[grell]] bodyguard assigned by the Xanathar; the grell had secret orders to dispose of the drow if it saw signs of disloyalty."
