        "mainbody": "'''Neera''' was a [[half-elf]] [[wild mage]] that traveled across [[west Faerûn]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Casting wild magic is like playing a flute by ear...when I miss a note, the flute shoots fire at everyone. Also the flute sometimes turns me into a [[hamster]].}}",
        "Description": "Neera previously had light blond hair, but it was changed pink as a result of a [[wild surge]]. At one point it was even lavender in color.",
        "Personality": "Most of the time Neera was quite upbeat and whimsical, though like her magical powers, her mood was not always predictable. On a deeper level she was troubled by events in her past.\n\nNeera had the habit of making nicknames for people that were often not well received.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Neera CLB.jpg|thumb|280px|''\"In magical terms, I can play a pretty mean tune. But when I miss a note, the flute shoots fire at everyone.\" —Neera]]\nAs a wild mage, Neera was a powerful and at times dangerous [[spellcaster]] whose magic often had unforeseeable results. Her instructors believed it was a flaw in her character that caused her wild surges. She was particularly skilled at casting [[evocation]] spells.",
        "Possessions": "Neera had few possessions, but did own a ''[[Neera's staff|unique quarterstaff]]'' that she won from a classmate [[Pollae]].{{Cite dragon+/22/Final Exam & Best Friends}}",
        "Relationships": "While she was living in the High Forest, Neera's best friend was an irreverent [[tressym]] named [[Ettin (tressym)|Ettin]].",
        "History": {
            "Early Life": "Neera was born and grew up in the community [[Highbough]] within the [[High Forest]]. She trained in magic with the other elves of her village and learned about her unpredictable powers at a young age. On one occasion, she conjured a sphere of fire that burnt another student when she tried to merely form an [[illusion]] of fire in the likeness of her [[gnome]] classmate [[Binster]]. Terrified of her own powers, she fled Highbough and went to live in the region of [[Turlang's Wood]].\n\nShe stayed in the woods for some time but regularly became involved with the wrong sorts of people. In autumn of one year, she and her friend Ettin encountered a band of [[orc]]s trudging through the forest. To defend herself, Neera cast a number of fire spells of increasing power. The [[treant]] [[Turlang]] intervened and exiled her from the High Forest for good. She wandered the surrounding lands for some time but was ill-suited for a life on the road.\n\nAt some point she stole 200 [[gold piece]]s from a [[halfling]] man named [[Meklin]] while he slept. To get away from him she threw a pot over his head and beat it with a spoon.",
            "On the Run": "[[File:Neera promotional.jpg|thumb|left|280px|[[Wild magic]] moments.]]\nSome time around the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, a team of [[Red Wizard]]s guided by the [[Evoker|invoker]] [[Ekandor]] began to chase after Neera. They sought to experiment on wild mages in order to understand how they could wield the \"power of arcane chaos\". She fled from them for months, eventually reaching the town of [[Beregost]].\n\nAfter evading the Red Wizards, Neera sought out a fellow wild mage by the name of [[Adoy]]. She believed he could help her with the erratic effects caused by her magic. She found him at his hidden enclave east of the [[Firewine Bridge]], but was interrupted by the sudden appearance of Ekandor and his allies. After the group of Red Wizards was bested, Adoy cast a [[conjuration]] spell and disappeared in a sudden wild surge. \n\nSome time later Adoy was captured by Red Wizards from the [[Order of Eight Staves]]. However while in the [[Fugue Plane]], he was able to communicate only with Neera by some form of telepathy. Having his voice in her head became too much for the young wild mage, and she sought out the ingredients for a ''[[potion]]'' that could sever their link and give her peace of mind. During her search Neera herself came to be trapped in the settlement of [[Bridgefort]] while it was besieged by the [[Shining Crusade]].",
            "Forming a Community": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}} Neera founded the [[hidden refuge]], a commune that Sheltered wild mages from the clutches of the Order of Eight Staves. It was hidden within the [[Forest of Tethir]], in an area just beyond an area of [[wild magic]]. At some point, Neera traveled to the city of Athkatla to rescue the young wild mage [[Mereth]]."
