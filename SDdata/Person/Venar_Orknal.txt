'''Venar Orknal''' was a [[bloodforge]] mage in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

Venar was on a campaign to unify the war-torn and fractious Utter East through conquest, exactly like the rival [[Legendary Campaign]]. For months, Venar Orknal and the Legendary Campaign leader had outwitted each other with no victory. Finally, they agreed to a contest of skill and bloodforge battle prowess within the [[Puzzle Palace]], with the loser to give up their mission and claim to the realm for all time.
