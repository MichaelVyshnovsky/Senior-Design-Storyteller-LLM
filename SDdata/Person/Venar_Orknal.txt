Venar Orknal was a bloodforge mage in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).
Venar was on a campaign to unify the war-torn and fractious Utter East through conquest, exactly like the rival Legendary Campaign. For months, Venar Orknal and the Legendary Campaign leader had outwitted each other with no victory. Finally, they agreed to a contest of skill and bloodforge battle prowess within the Puzzle Palace, with the loser to give up their mission and claim to the realm for all time.
