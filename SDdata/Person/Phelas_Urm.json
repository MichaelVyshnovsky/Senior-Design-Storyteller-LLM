        "mainbody": "'''Phelas Urm''' was a merchant from [[Thentia]] by the [[Moonsea]] in the late 4{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|22}}\n\nSome time after the sinking of ''[[Valashar's Bane]]'' in [[389 DR]], he purchased the recovered [[Cormyr]]ean state sword, ''[[Ilbratha]]'', from a fellow merchant, [[Sevan]] of [[Amnwater]], while in [[Scornubel]], not realizing the blade's significance. Phelas took the sword with him as he traveled overland, passing through Cormyr, and the sword was recognized in [[Arabel]]. In the [[392 DR|Year of the Firstborn, 392 DR]], agents of King [[Azoun I]] of [[Cormyr]] attempted to recover the sword, and Phelas panicked at being so hunted. Phelas was killed in the process, but the sword went missing again, due to either the confusion of the situation or a corrupt agent stealing the blade."
