'''Lethias Enaril''' was an [[elven]] [[bladesinger]] that acted as protector of the the [[Hand of the Seldarine]] for centuries after the 10{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
In life he was a close friend of [[Larrel]], the elven [[archmage]] who founded the Hand in [[Icewind Dale]].

==History==
Some time before the late 13{{th}} century, the Hand of the Seldarine was besieged a monstrous horde of [[orc]]s and [[goblinoid]]s. Lethias and his other elves fought to defend the fortress for days, but ultimately saw they would lose the battle. True to his oath, Lethias sacrificed his life by leading a great many of the invaders into the Hand. His fellow elves amassed a number of [[artifact]]s within one of the Hand's four towers and detonated them, collapsing the tower over Lethias and so many of the invaders.

Lethias' [[spirit]] lingered in the ruins of the Severed Hand, as the elven fortress was then called.
