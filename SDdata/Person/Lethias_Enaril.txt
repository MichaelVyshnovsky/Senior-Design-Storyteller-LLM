Lethias Enaril was an elven bladesinger that acted as protector of the the Hand of the Seldarine for centuries after the 10 century DR.
In life he was a close friend of Larrel, the elven archmage who founded the Hand in Icewind Dale.
Some time before the late 13 century, the Hand of the Seldarine was besieged a monstrous horde of orcs and goblinoids. Lethias and his other elves fought to defend the fortress for days, but ultimately saw they would lose the battle. True to his oath, Lethias sacrificed his life by leading a great many of the invaders into the Hand. His fellow elves amassed a number of artifacts within one of the Hands four towers and detonated them, collapsing the tower over Lethias and so many of the invaders.
Lethias spirit lingered in the ruins of the Severed Hand, as the elven fortress was then called.
