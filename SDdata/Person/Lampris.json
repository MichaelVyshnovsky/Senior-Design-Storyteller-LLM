        "Relationships": "Lampris's father was a [[ranger]] who had traveled from another world, and his mother was a spellcaster from the [[Kara-Tur|far east]] of [[Faer√ªn]]. He had an older brother, Parzal.",
        "History": "As an infant, his family home was attacked by a [[sohei]] from the [[Monastery of the West Wind]]. The sohei slew his parents, robbed and burned the home, and kidnapped Parzal and Lampris. The sohei eventually abandoned Parzal in the [[Dunes of Death]], and sold Lampris into [[slavery]]. Although Parzal searched for his brother as an adult, he never found Lampris again."
