'''Nisar Zayid''' was a [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] [[barbarian]] and [[sorcerer]] and a crew-member of the ''[[Midnight Rose]]'' ship.

==Description==
Nisar had a dark skin and a clean shaven head. His face was covered in blue and yellow tattoos. He carried a [[battleaxe]] with him.

==History==
Nisar was born to a chieftain who lived in the jungles of [[Chult]]. His father sold him to river raiders, who in turn sold him to a pirate to act as a surgeon's whelp. Over time, he earned his freedom and did some honest work in the [[Nelanther Isles]] before joining captain [[Allendry]]'s crew on the ''Midnight Rose''.

Around [[1372 DR]], when the priestess of [[Umberlee]] [[Tasina Alcrest]] took control of the ship by summoning an army of [[sahuagin]] that slaughtered most of the crew, including Captain Allendry, Nisar managed to escape. He found refuge at [[Spindrift Town]], a pirate port on a small island that was part of the Nelanther Isles. There, he was possibly recruited by the new captain of the ''Midnight Rose'', an adventurer tasked by Allendry's [[ghost]] to have vengeance upon Tasina.
