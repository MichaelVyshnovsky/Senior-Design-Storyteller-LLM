Jaufan was a sohei participant at the Komite in Shou Lung.
Since 1348 DR, Jaufan had worked as an enforcer for a criminal yakuza gang. In 1358 DR, believing that street fights had taught him more lessons than practice in a dojo, Jaufan went to participate at the Komite in Suijeng. He told everyone he had a 12th-degree black belt in kung fu.
