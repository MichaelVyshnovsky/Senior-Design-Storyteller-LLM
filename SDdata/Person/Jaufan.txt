'''Jaufan''' was a [[sohei]] participant at the [[Komite]] in [[Shou Lung]].

==History==
Since [[1348 DR]], Jaufan had worked as an enforcer for a criminal [[yakuza]] gang. In [[1358 DR]], believing that street fights had taught him more lessons than practice in a dojo, Jaufan went to participate at the Komite in [[Suijeng]]. He told everyone he had a 12th-degree black belt in [[kung fu]].
