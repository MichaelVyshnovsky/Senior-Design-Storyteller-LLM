        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the armies of the [[Absolute]] ravaged the [[Western Heartlands]], scribe [[Gallaher Brym]] and his family were among countless refugees seeking entrance to Baldur's Gate. Desperate for admission into the closed city, Gallaher penned a letter, sent via the [[Sword Coast Couriers]], addressed to Lord Haverford Gist. The scribe offered his professional services and eternal gratitude if Haverford, renowned for his charitability, would help the family enter the city. It was unknown whether Lord Gist responded to the request or even if the letter was ever delivered."
