'''Daisake Mayazato''' was a [[wu jen]] in the town of [[Aru]] in [[Wa]] in the late 1350s [[DR]].

==Personality==
As an effect of his old age, Daisake had become senile and became obsessed with some ideas or plans for no real reason.

==History==
Some years before, he saved [[Moonlight]], [[Smoke (ninja)|Smoke]], and [[Snake (ninja)|Snake]] of the [[Warazama]] [[ninja]] clan from a [[spirit folk]] ambush. They agreed to repay his help by working for him for five years.

He decided to ruin the [[Ceremony of the Three Thousand Steps]] at the [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]], though he had no actual reason for it.

A citizen of Aru claimed that "Dosko" (as he misremembered the name) put a [[spell]] on him that sickened his right arm, though it had healed by {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}.
