        "History": "Nrymm was very young when his father, and king, died and he was raised by the women of the court.\n\nWhen [[magelord]]s seized control, Nrymm disappeared. Magelord records indicated that he was turned into an [[otyugh]] by the magelords, then kept in the middens of [[Athalgard]], the royal castle in [[Hastarl]], so that they had another blood heir of Uthgrael in their power, other than [[Belaur Aumar]].\n\nNrymm was slain in otyugh form in [[238 DR]] by one of the mages hired by [[Felodar Aumar]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|26-37}}",
