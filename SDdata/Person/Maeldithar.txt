Maeldithar  was a centaur ranger who lived in Icewind Dale in the midâ€“14 century DR.
He could be found by adventurers just outside a village that had been raided by drow elves. He could be convinced to join their party, although he was wary of traveling too far from his home, as his family were expecting his return.
