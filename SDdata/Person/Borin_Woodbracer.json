        "mainbody": "Borin Woodbracer was a dwarven ex-adventurer who worked for Lord Partic Thistle as a handyman at Thistleflame Keep circa 1369 DR.\nBorin was a gruff and quiet fellow, but also creative and thoughtful. He adored the exterior stonework of Thistleflame, a major influence on his desire to work at the estate.\nHe had an unfortunate habit of drinking too much at the Bubbling Bulwark and rampaging around the common room, breaking furniture and causing a mess. This would result in Lord Thistle paying for the damages, or Borin performing the repairs himself.\nHe had a magical warhammer from his time as an adventurer.\nBorin was a good friend to Thistleflames gardener, Berke Glorata, as he didnt feel threatened by his stunning good looks. He tended to get on less well with elves and half-elves such as Kaleb Fleetwing, who he had a general distrust of."
