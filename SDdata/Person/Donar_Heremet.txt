Donar Heremet was a thief inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He wore an enchanted suit of leather armor, and wielded a short sword and a dagger of homing. The equipment, as well as his stealthy training, came from Essimuth Lanys.
Donar enjoyed playing pranks on people that were usually harmless such as hanging a bucket of water over a door. His antics frequently got him chased from the Safehaven Inn.
He had two sisters named Edrianna and Ariel.
