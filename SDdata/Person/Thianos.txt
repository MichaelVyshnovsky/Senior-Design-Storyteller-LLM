Thianos, nicknamed "Ironskull", was a male dwarf cleric of Moradin who lived in the town of Llorkh in the Savage Frontier in the late 1350s DR.
Following his takeover of Llorkh in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Lord Geildarr Ithym named Thianos an outlaw and ordered the Lords Men to find him.
He was considered aged at the time.
