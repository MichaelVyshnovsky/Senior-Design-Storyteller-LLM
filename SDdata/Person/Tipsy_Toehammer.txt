'''Tipsy Toehammer''' was an unreliable [[halfling]] [[rogue]] active in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|222|Tipsy Toehammer}}

==Abilities==
Tipsy was an exceptionally dexterous and uncannily lucky halfling. He was a talented rogue but laziness was his most prominent trait. Many considered Tipsy to be selfish, unreliable, and untrustworthy, especially in a crisis.

==Possessions==
Tipsy Toehammer had a special [[throwing dagger]] [[bandolier|harness]] draped across his chest for ease of access to his main weapons. Along with the daggers, the halfling had a ''[[ring of invisibility]]'' handy.

==History==
Ever since his childhood, Tipsy was a lazy person. His natural size and aptitudes guided him toward the life of thievery. Tipsy's uncanny luck certainly helped him to make a name for himself. Many claimed that the halfling's luck could even defy [[god]]s.
