Trynn was a halfling ranger and agent of the archdevil Zariel who posed as a paladin of Tyr, the God of Justice.
She carried with her a bow and demonstrated great skill with the weapon.
Rurik traveled alongside her fellow agents, human paladin and leader Anders, the wizard Cyrel, and the dwarf named Rurik.
Sometime in the year , Trynn was tasked by Zariel to bring the tiefling Karlach Cliffgate back to the Nine Hells after she escaped the archdevils service by boarding a Nautiloid.
Lead by Anders, Trynn and her fellow agents caught up with the tiefling somewhere along the Risen Road and managed to injure her, but could not kill her. The group stopped by a nearby tollhouse along the River Chionthar to corner their mark and were subsequently attacked by gnoll cultists loyal to the Absolute, though Trynn and her companions managed to slay them.
