'''Trynn''' was a [[halfling]] [[ranger]] and agent of the [[archdevil]] [[Zariel]] who posed as a [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]], the God of Justice.

{{Quote|You won't get any further this way, friend. Road's blocked up ahead.|Trynn.}}

==Possessions==
She carried with her a [[bow]] and demonstrated great skill with the weapon.

==Relationships==
Rurik traveled alongside her fellow agents, [[human]] [[paladin]] and leader [[Anders]], the [[wizard]] [[Cyrel]], and the [[dwarf]] named [[Rurik]].

==History==
Sometime in the year {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Trynn was tasked by [[Zariel]] to bring the [[tiefling]] [[Karlach Cliffgate]] back to the [[Nine Hells]] after she escaped the archdevil's service by boarding a [[Nautiloid]].

Lead by [[Anders]], Trynn and her fellow agents caught up with the tiefling somewhere along the [[Risen Road]] and managed to injure her, but could not kill her. The group stopped by a nearby tollhouse along the [[River Chionthar]] to corner their mark and were subsequently attacked by [[gnoll]] [[Cult of the Absolute|cultists]] loyal to [[the Absolute]], though Trynn and her companions managed to slay them.
