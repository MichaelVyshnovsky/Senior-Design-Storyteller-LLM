Snowhair the Sorceress was a character appearing in a ballad about the rumored Bryndar of Brynwood in the Vast.
According to one tale about the Bryndar, they were real human women who adopted animal forms to discourage anyone who ventured into their forest. A certain minstrel wrote a ballad about one of these women, whom he named "Snowhair the Sorceress". She was depicted as a scornful, white-haired mage.
