'''Snowhair the Sorceress''' was a character appearing in a ballad about the rumored [[Bryndar]] of [[Brynwood]] in [[the Vast]].

According to one tale about the Bryndar, they were real [[human]] women who adopted [[animal]] forms to discourage anyone who ventured into their forest. A certain minstrel wrote a ballad about one of these women, whom he named "Snowhair the Sorceress". She was depicted as a scornful, white-haired [[mage]].
