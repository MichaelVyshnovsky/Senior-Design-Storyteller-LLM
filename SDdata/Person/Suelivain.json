        "mainbody": "'''Suelivain''' was a [[shade]] mage from [[Thultanthar]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the leader of [[Demarch's Folly]], an organization dedicated to learning [[shadow magic]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Shadowcasters|}}",
        "Abilities": "Suelivain was both a [[wizard]] and a [[shadowcaster]], practicing both traditional [[arcane]] [[magic]] and shadow magic. He merged both in the path of the [[noctumancer]]. He was familiar with, but did not use, [[Shadow Weave]] magic.",
        "Possessions": "Suelivain owned a number of [[magic item]]s. He wrote down his notes on shadow magic in the ''[[tome of Suelivain]]''.",
        "History": "Suelivain was dwelling in Thultanthar when a [[shadowstorm]] struck and he lost several of his possessions, including the ''tome of Suelivain''. His things were spread across the [[Plane of Shadow]]. Unbeknownst to him, however, a rift to the plane later deposited his things in the [[Halls of Demarch]] in the city of [[Tantras]] in [[Faer√ªn]].\n\nMembers of Demarch's Folly found the ''tome of Suelivain'' and from it they learned the fundamentals of shadow magic. They tracked down Suelivain and returned his tome and other possessions in exchange for training in the ways of shadow magic. Suelivain accepted and joined Demarch's Folly in the role of mentor and leader. He educated them in the differences between shadow magic and Shadow Weave magic. He was still with them by [[1374 DR]]."
