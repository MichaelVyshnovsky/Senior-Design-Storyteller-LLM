'''Proctiv''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]], prolific [[spell]] inventor, and master of [[variation]].

==Description==
Proctiv was an extraordinary mage who developed the second most powerful spell in the Empire of [[Netheril]], ''[[Proctiv's breach crystal sphere]]'' (which was tied with ''[[Mavin's worldweave]]'' in terms of power).

==History==
Proctiv developed eight spells during his life. Spectacularly, in {{YearlinkConvert|1746|NY}}, he developed his first spell: the epic ''[[move mountain]]'', which became crucial for creating the base of a [[Netherese enclave|flying enclave]]. After this, he invented ''[[stone shape]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1749|NY}}, ''[[move earth]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1764|NY}}, ''[[glassteel (spell)|glassteel]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1769|NY}}, ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1774|NY}}, ''[[transmute water to dust]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1796|NY}}, and ''[[dig]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1799|NY}}. In {{YearlinkConvert|1808|NY}}, Proctiv had an enormous breakthrough and developed the epic ''Proctiv's breach crystal sphere'' (and its reverse version).
