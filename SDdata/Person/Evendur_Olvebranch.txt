Evendur Olvebranch was a halfling expert and sage living in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 14 century DR.
She was an inquisitive young woman of two diametrically opposed parts on the one hand, prim and proper and orderly, and on the other, a chaotic whirlwind of activity, talk, and thought. She was excitable in conversation, asking lots more questions than necessary, and she forgot nothing. Not many could spend more than a few minutes in her company.
Nevertheless, Evendur was a fast and knowledgeable researcher, but also quite expensive. For her services, circa 1372 DR, she charged 20 gp to answer a significant question, but could do so in a couple of hours.
She visited the Monastery of St. Ulrach occasionally to collect some special herbs that the monks there cultivated.
