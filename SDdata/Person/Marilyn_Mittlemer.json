        "mainbody": "Marilyn Mittlemer was the wife of Mortimer Mittlemer, an illusionist con-artist from Ravens Bluff, the Living City in the mid-14 century DR.\nShe was an accomplished thief who approached her carefully selected marks with utmost caution.\nMortimer was a deeply selfish and greedy man. He married Marilyn because he wanted to use her thieving skills, but despite that, he did eventually fall in love with the woman. Despite being married, Mortimer claimed 60% of their loot, and Marilyn got only 30% of the take. Marilyn, however, adored her husband and aimed to please him at every turn. She also found joy in scamming and swindling gullible adventurers.\nHer most prized possession was a magical cloak of elvenkind, a wedding gift from Marilyns mother.\nMarilyn met Mortimer when she unsuccessfully tried to pickpocket the illusionist. To Marilyns surprise, Mortimer asked the woman out instead of reporting her to the city guards. Their romanced mood at a break-neck speed. Soon after, the two tied the knot. She believed that Mortimer picked a wrong vocation and strove to teach him her thieving ways eventually.\nDuring a spring or summer of the mid-14 century DR, Marilyn joined her husband and Elmerth Willowit, a fellow thief, on a scam aimed at traveling adventurers. Mortimer trained seven canaries with his magical ring and staged a scorched patch of grass to convince travelers he was a platinum dragon. Then he would approach travelers and ask them to support some faraway countrys strife and ask for donations of gold and gems to pay for the goodly nations defenses against evil. As the adventurers were distracted, Marilyn and Elmerth snuck to the victims and pickpocketed any remaining valuables from them. If Marilyn failed to lift the loot, she signaled her husband with a mirror, slipping away with the use of her cloak of elvenkind or a potion of flying.\nDuring a spring or summer of the mid-14 century DR, a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff, the Living City, came across the charlatan while traveling the forest. The result and successes of the interaction remained unrecorded. However, Mortimer was ready to use magic to scare adventurers into donating or fleeing using dust of disappearance. During that time, Mortimer Mittlemer and his wife used swindled treasure to invest in a certain lending institution and a popular tavern in Ravens Bluff."
