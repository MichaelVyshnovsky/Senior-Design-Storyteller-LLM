Lord Thesp Eltorchul was a noble inhabiting Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Thesp was the patriarch of the Eltorchul noble family. Upon inheriting his familys wealth from the spice trade, Thesp invested a large sum of money into establishing the Eltorchul Academy in Waterdeeps Sea Ward. In addition to educating young wizards, the Academy procured rare spell components. Thesp was forced to be far less discriminating on who was admitted to Eltorchul Academy or risk complete bankruptcy following a magical accident involving his son and heir, Oth Eltorchul.
Thesps younger daughter, Fea Eltorchul, became his heir apparent following Oths accident.
