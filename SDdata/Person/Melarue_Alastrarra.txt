'''Melarue Alastrarra''' was an inhabitant of [[Myth Drannor]] in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].

==Appearance==
She was tall. On the evening in which she encountered [[Elminster Aumar]], she was wearing a nightshift, which like her sister's, made of blue-green [[silk]] hanging loosely from a collar.

==Abilities==
She could conjure fire around her wrists, and likely could cast other [[spell]]s, too.

==History==
On the evening when Elminster Aumar arrived at the [[Alastrarra]] home, ''[[polymorph]]ed'' into [[Iymbryl Alastrarra]], she found Elminster with her sister, [[Filaurel Alastrarra]], hugging him. He took cover behind Filaurel, so that Melarue wouldn't attack him; [[Naeryndam Alastrarra]] and [[Ornthalas Alastrarra]] arrived soon after. Ornthalas received the ''[[kiira]]'' from Elminster, and Naeryndam took him to the [[Coronal]] for justice.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|104-108|5}}
