        "Personality": "Vournoth had become well-known enough in the vicinity of [[Maerimydra]] that the [[lich]]'s name was attributed to the [[Vournoth's Mire|mire]] it resided in.",
        "Abilities": "The powers and abilities of a [[lich]], like Vournoth, meant the creature was highly resistant to ordinary attacks and could paralyze foes with but a touch. Vournoth was considered dangerous enough by the [[drow]] of Maerimydra that they sent a champion out to face the lich.",
        "Possessions": "A notable lich, Vournoth at one time had a [[phylactery]] that allowed the lich to reform after defeat.",
        "History": "At some point, Vournoth managed to master the [[necromancy|necromantic]] art of [[lich]]dom and took up residence in a mire roughly 40 miles (64.3 km) from the [[drow]] city of [[Maerimydra]] in the [[Deep Wastes]]. Although many creatures had laired in the mire over the years, Vournoth's reputation eventually spread to such a degree that the fetid intersection became known as [[Vournoth's Mire]].\n\nHowever, in [[800 DR]], the expansion of Maerimydra's influence in the wake of the [[Weeping War]], coupled with the threat of a lich so close to their city, prompted the drow to send a champion to hunt down Vournoth. The drow champion managed to drive the lich from its lair and paved the way for the founding of [[Szith Morcane]] in [[804 DR]], and the lair itself was turned into an outpost.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], Vournoth's reputation had diminished to the point that the mire was simply known as \"Lich's Mire\" among the Maerimydran drow.{{cite web |url= http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/frx/20020920|title= City of the Spider Queen Maps|accessdate= |accessmonthday= June 23|accessyear= 2015|author= Dennis Kauth|date= 2002-09-20|work= City of the Spider Queen|publisher= WotC }}"
