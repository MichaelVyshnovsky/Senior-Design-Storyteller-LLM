        "mainbody": "ournoth was a lich that laired in a stagnant intersection in the Deep Wastes that became known as Vournoths Mire.\nVournoth had become well-known enough in the vicinity of Maerimydra that the lichs name was attributed to the mire it resided in.\nThe powers and abilities of a lich, like Vournoth, meant the creature was highly resistant to ordinary attacks and could paralyze foes with but a touch. Vournoth was considered dangerous enough by the drow of Maerimydra that they sent a champion out to face the lich.\nA notable lich, Vournoth at one time had a phylactery that allowed the lich to reform after defeat.\nAt some point, Vournoth managed to master the necromantic art of lichdom and took up residence in a mire roughly 40 miles (64.3 km) from the drow city of Maerimydra in the Deep Wastes. Although many creatures had laired in the mire over the years, Vournoths reputation eventually spread to such a degree that the fetid intersection became known as Vournoths Mire.\nHowever, in 800 DR, the expansion of Maerimydras influence in the wake of the Weeping War, coupled with the threat of a lich so close to their city, prompted the drow to send a champion to hunt down Vournoth. The drow champion managed to drive the lich from its lair and paved the way for the founding of Szith Morcane in 804 DR, and the lair itself was turned into an outpost.\nBy 1372 DR, Vournoths reputation had diminished to the point that the mire was simply known as \"Lichs Mire\" among the Maerimydran drow."
