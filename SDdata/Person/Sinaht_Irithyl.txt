'''Sinaht Irithyl''' was the chosen heir of [[Sakrattars Irithyl]], and the third [[Coronal]] of [[Cormanthyr]] from {{Yearlink|-1950}} to his death in {{Yearlink|-1338}}.

He became coronal upon drawing the [[Rulers' Blade]] after the former coronal's death. His rysar was known for a successful campaign against the [[drow]] of the [[Twisted Tower]] and the former realm of [[Uvaeren]] in {{Yearlink|-1354}}, which utilized the combined forces of Cormanthyr and [[Rystall Wood]] to rout many of the dark elves from the woods. Unfortunately, they failed to penetrate the Twisted Tower, and many drow managed to escape into the [[Underdark]].
