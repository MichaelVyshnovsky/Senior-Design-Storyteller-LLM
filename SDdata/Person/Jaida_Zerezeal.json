        "mainbody": "Jaida Zerezeal was a half-elf ranger of the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. She held the title of Gauntlet of the Western Marches, with the duty of defending Loudwaters territory to the west, until she was replaced by Isyan Kiysisnos in Eleasis/Eleint of 1372 DR.Created for the Legacy of the Green Regent campaign, Jaida has no involvement in any of the adventure modules and is later replaced by Isyan, with no explanation for the change. Her removal may have been explained in the unreleased Secret of Phantoms Cloister. Furthermore, its unknown if she is western or eastern Gauntlet, but since Harazos is typically the eastern Gauntlet, it is assumed that Jaida is the western."
