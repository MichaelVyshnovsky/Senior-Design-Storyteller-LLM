        "History": "In [[1361 DR]], his prime assistant was [[Shatil]], brother of [[Erixitl]].\n\nZitli conspired with the [[Nexal]] high priest [[Hoxitl]] in order to arrange an ambush against the [[Golden Legion]] at Palul. Under Shatil's suggestion, Zitli decided to use Erixitl as a translator.\n\nHe and Zitli were at Zaltec's pyramid during the false party. However, when the legionaries started attacking the hidden Nexalan warriors, it became clear that they had uncovered the plot. Zitli sacrificed his life to allow Shatil to escape via a secret passage in order to explain the situation to Hoxitl."
