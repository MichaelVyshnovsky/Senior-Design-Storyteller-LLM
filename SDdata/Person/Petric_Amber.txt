==Description==
Petric Amber was a wood elven man with sharp facial features and a skin tone tinted with floral green-brown. He had long brown hair and wore a [[monocle]] over his right eye. He preferred blue finery and wore a resplendent hat decorated with a single massive feather.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, shortly before the armies of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] attacked the city of Baldur's Gate, Lord Petric Amber was a Parliamentarian of the Gate who voted in support of crowning lowborn Lord [[Enver Gortash]] as the city's Archduke. Lord Amber was present for Gortash's coronation that took place in the audience hall of [[Wyrm's Rock]]. Following the coronation, Petric stated that he would support the new Archduke as long as Gortash honored the agreement between them.
