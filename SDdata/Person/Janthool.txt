Janthool was a merchant in Athkatla in 1359 DR.
Janthool traveled Faer√ªn in order to make money. He tried to damage Auroras Emporium by hiring orcs and bandits to attack their outlets.
Janthool gained wealth thanks to shrewd bartering and careful, covert investments. One time he arranged a stampede against the Auroras outlet in Waterdeep but had to flee the city hastily when evidence was given against him. In 1367 DR, he found a treasure in Soubar.
