        "mainbody": "Purfbin Doogrick was a young gnome rogue companion of the Hero of Daggerford who rescued Great Duke Pwyll Daggerford from the Zhentarim abduction in 1372 DR.\nPurfbin was a portly young gnome with shaggy curly blond hair and black, slightly bulging eyes. One of his front teeth was noticeably chipped. Purfbin wore brightly colored jacket of many pockets, each overstuffed with valuables and gadgets.\nPurfbin Doogrick smiled often and possessed a mischievous streak. Trulit & Greegons claret was one of Purfbins favorite libations, he could detect its smell from a distance even if it was sealed in waxed casks. Like many of his fellow gnomes, Purfbin loved cheese, in moderation, of course, and hated feeling even slightest hint hunger.\nHowever cheerful and eccentric the gnome appeared to be, he missed his home and family greatly, often tearing up when talking bout the Doogrick clan burrows.\nHis main motivator in life was avarice. He loved gold, silver, and had especial weakness for gems.\nPurfbin Doogrick considered himself to be a \"professional treasure hunter\", and not a thug or a thief. He honed his roguish skills in acquiring and recovering rare artifacts. That profession often brought him to antagonize with other thieves by stealing from them said powerful artifacts.\nPurfbin always tinkered with his weapons and armor, often actually making useful alterations.\nPurfbins clothes were far from fashionable and were eccentrically dyed, but enchanted his roguish skills. Purfbins crossbow was a powerful invention that could shoot a seemingly unlimited number of bolts of lightning along with regular crossbow ammunition. He also had a potion of cure light wounds handy.\nPurfbin often said that the home was wherever he found a safe place to sleep, however he missed his mode and family greatly. The Doogrick clan burrows were located somewhere to the south of Daggerford. The family was typical for gnomish standards, however Purfbins favorite family member was Retsotnert Doogrick, a famous and quite an eccentric inventor.\nSometime before Purfbin set out to adventure, he lived with this family in Doogrick clan burrows. From that time Purfbin fondly remembered an incident when his grandfather Retsotnert cobbled together a flying machine out of twigs, grease, and cogs. The young gnome accompanied his grandfather on the inventions maiden flight. The machine managed to fly several feet before falling apart to Purfbin and Retsotnerts grand joy and thunderous laughter.\nAs a youth, Purfbin wanted to become a famous inventor like his grandfather. The gnome invented a terrifying invention he named Shred-o-Matic 1000 to help with peeling potatos for the annual grand Harvest Stew served during the New Harvest Festival. Gnome youth was always tasked with the chore, and one year, Purfbin decided to unveil his invention in front of the festival guests, hoping for praise and accolades for the grand invention. The burrows Chief Cook Bitty Bitterbreath allowed the demonstration, and Purfbin fired up the Shred-o-Matic 1000 within the eyesight of the most important attendees. The gnome could imagine his machine displayed in Gonds High House of Wonders in Baldurs Gate, displayed alongside other grand inventions such as Gurns Great Gnomeflinger and Baldrics Brilliant Blamblower. Daydreaming, Purfbin did not notice something jamming in the machines navigation. Instead of moving towards a mountain of potatoes, Shred-o-Matic 1000 moved towards Mayor Whimblesnort and her new expensive silk hat, then Dame Edzas prized wig. The guests screams of terror could be heard for miles around as the machine continued shredding the most expensive pieces of guests finery. This incident became a disgrace for clan Doogrick.\nDuring Purfbins time in the City of Splendors, Waterdeep, he used his roguish skills to the fullest however, food was just as valuable to the gnome as coins and gems. One misadventure came his way when Lady Spitalsmore unexpectedly returned home earlier than anticipated. The diminutive thief was stuck in the noblewomans dark basement as Lady Spitalsmore settled in her kitchen for a cup of afternoon tea. Threatened by hunger and the dreaded threat of missing a meal, Purfbin emptied the many pockets of his gaudy outfit. What appeared to be useless junk became invaluable tools of escape. The gnome slid a shard of a mirror under the basement door to survey the tea room. Next, he used wire to construct an intricate trap. A trap for lizards! And dead Modovian dung beetles served as bait. The captive lizard was pushed through into the ladys kitchen as a distraction. Purfbin slid out of the basement while the terrified shrieking noblewoman evacuated the premises. The gnome snuck out of her abode but not before gathering copious foodstuffs from her kitchen.\nIn 1372 DR, Purfbin Doogrick \"hitched a ride\" in Falias Emberthumbs caravan trying to escape jail sentence in Waterdeep after he was accused of lifting a purse off of a Waterdhavian noble, Lord Thunderfist. The disgruntled noble threatened the gnome with hanging with no proper trial after Purfbin tried to claim that the Lords purse simply fell on him like an apple off a tree.\nDuring the travel along the Trade Way, Zhentarim agents disguised as bandits ambushed the trade caravan and magically abducted one of the caravan guard hirelings, a fighter Talarenne, leaving behind her best friend, later came to be known as the hero of Daggerford. Purfbin Doogrick aided the caravaners fighting off the bandits and agreed to help with the heros quest of rescue of their friend in exchange for splitting the loot.\nAt the site of the  ambush the duo met Astriel Shalyn, secretly an agent of the Lords Alliance, who looked somewhat similar to the heros kidnapped friend."
