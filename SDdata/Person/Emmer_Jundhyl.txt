Emmer Jundhyl was an Illuskan human and a member of the City Watch of Waterdeep, holding the position of watch civilar for the North Ward.
The watch captain was hefty and outgoing. Always one to show off his great big grin, Emmer had a particularly boisterous and hearty laugh.
Emmer was good friends with Regnet Amcathra and Scirkhel Wands.
In 1372 DR, Emmer was supplanted by the doppelganger Fengharl of the Unseen. At the time, no one noticed the change and the real Emmers whereabouts were unknown.
