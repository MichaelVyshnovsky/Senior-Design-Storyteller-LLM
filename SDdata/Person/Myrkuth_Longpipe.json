        "mainbody": "'''Myrkuth Longpipe''', more commonly known as '''Ilph''', was a former [[thief]] and watchmen who served within the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] of [[Waterdeep]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Ilph was strong and thin for a [[halfling]]. He had black hair and favored black clothing when not wearing his watchman's uniform.",
        "History": "During the mid-14{{th}} century Ilph was a sneak-thief who roamed the rooftops and delved within the sewers of Waterdeep. In his off time he frequented the taverns of the city's [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]].\n\nSometime during the [[1366 DR|Year of the Staff, 1366 DR]], Ilph was stashing some his ill-gotten loot in a hidden cache located in a hollowed-out stone block on the roof of the [[Palace of Waterdeep]], when he was stopped by one of Waterdeep's [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lords]]. The lord chased the thief atop the city's building, keeping deft footing as well as Ilph, and eventually caught the criminal. Unbeknownst to Ilph, this lord was the newly-elected [[Nindil Jalbuck]].\n\nIlph was sentenced to six-years service within the City Watch. While he initially detested this new life that was forced upon him, by the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]] he came to respect the Watch and enjoyed the attention and respect he garnered among his law enforcement comrades."
