Bucklal Boldover was a half-mad halfling thief in Myth Drannor in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Bucklal went with a group of his fellow halflings to sack Myth Drannor. However, all his companions died and in order to survive Bucklal was forced to eat them. He also fought giant spiders using his bare hands. Afterward, he became half-mad. From then on, he preyed upon adventurers and monsters, moving like a rat in the citys tunnels.
Bucklal wandered the ruins of Myth Drannor tormenting and stealing from adventurers, killing small prey with his bare hands, and destroying baatezu using his magic items.
