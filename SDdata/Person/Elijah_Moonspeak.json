        "mainbody": "'''Elijah Moonspeak''' was a crazed [[cleric]] in [[Chult]].",
        "History": "Elijah and his adventuring party, including his beloved, went to Chult around [[1323 DR]] to search the [[heart of the jungle]] jewel. However, a [[tyrannosaurus]] attacked them. Elijah escaped while the [[dinosaur]] ate his friends. This completely shocked him. From then on, he wandered the jungles, avoiding [[dinosaur]]s and [[goblin]] patrols and eating lizards. In time,r he descended into madness.\n\nSomehow, in this time, he became devoted to [[Ubtao]] and discovered the place where the heart of the jungle lay, in the  village of the [[Batiri|Kuro]]Â goblins.",
        "Activities": "If Elijah met people from the [[Heartlands]], he quickly believed they were his lost companions ignoring any possible differences. At first, he believed they'd somehow escaped from the tyrannosaurus but afterward came to believe they were instead [[undead]] and attacked them."
