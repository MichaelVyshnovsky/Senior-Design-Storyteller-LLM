'''Delaan Winterhound''' was a chief ranger of the [[Emerald Enclave]] and their main delegate at the [[Council of Waterdeep]].

==Personality==
Delaan preferred the wild spaces of the [[North]] and felt uncomfortable in [[Waterdeep]]. He believed that the [[Cult of the Dragon]] needed to be stopped, as they caused too much destruction that would unbalanced nature's equilibrium. However, his primary concern was the natural order.

==History==
Delaan lived in the northern wilderness. Once a year, he visited his friend in [[Nesmé]].

When the menace of [[Severin Silrajin]]'s [[Cult of the Dragon]] became global, Delaan was chosen as the leading delegate at the Council of Waterdeep. Eventually, he was able to call on the help of [[treants]] against the Cult if he was impressed by the adventurers recruited to stop the Cult

==Relationship==
Delaan had a [[winter wolf]] companion called [[Loska]]. He was also good friend of the famed treant [[Turlang]] of the [[High Forest]].
