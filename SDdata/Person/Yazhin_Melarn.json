        "Activities": "Yazhin was studying at [[Arach-Tinilith]].\n \nMatron Mother [[Zhindia Melarn]] was grooming Yazhin to become her successor, perhaps even above [[Kyrnill Melarn]].",
        "History": "In [[1486 DR]], Yazhin was recalled from her studies at Arach-Tinilith in order to observe the attack from House Melarn and [[House Hunzrin]] against the reformed [[House Do'Urden]]. However, when the attack failed after the  ntervention of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and his companions, Yazhin was killed by the magical dagger of [[Artemis Entreri]]. This was confirmed by [[Yvonnel Baenre II]] to have totally destroyed Yazhin's soul."
