        "mainbody": "Prince '''Yder Tanthul''' was one of the twelve [[Princes of Shade]] and the right hand of his older brother Prince [[Rivalen Tanthul]]. While he served the High Prince and empire of [[Netheril]] as its general,\n\n{{Quote|Shar cares nothing for ancient names or aristocratic blood. She values ability above all else, and man like you...let us just say that when the Mistress of the Night reigns over Toril, nobles will bow to ''you''.|Yder, sharing the virtues of Shar to his adversary [[Kleef Kenric]].}}",
        "Description": "Yder had gleaming blue-grey eyes the color of [[steel]]. His protruding fangs became visisble when he smiled.\n\nHe had a notably deep voice that would resonate in the minds of others.",
        "Personality": "The prince had a cunning mind for tactics and was wholly dedicated to any mission he undertook. He was not one to be influenced by flattery.",
        "Possessions": "Yder's personal sigil is a stylized silver [[greatsword]] on a gray field. The pommel of this sword is a replica of the symbol of [[Shar]]: a black disk with a deep purple border.",
        "Abilities": "Using the power bestowed upon him from Shar, Yder could enter into the dreams of others. During these psychic intrusions he could communicate with his victim or spy upon their recent memories.",
        "Activities": "Upon the return of [[Thultanthar]] to the Realms, Yder served as a [[divine champion]] dedicated to Shar and commanded the [[Night Guard]]s of the [[Hall of Shadows]].\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Yder had become a general of the armies of thereturned empire of [[Netheril]]. He also performed duties as the chief templar in Rivalen's [[Dome of Night]].",
        "Relationships": "{{Quote|Do not follow your brother's path, I warn you. I won't tolerate it again.|Telamont Tanthul, to Yder.}}\n\nUnlike his elder brother, [[Rivalen Tanthul|Rivalen]], Yder has no quarrel with his father's hand, [[Hadrhune]]. He would simply like the will of his deity guide the Shadovar rather than Hadrhune's.\n\nYder was briefly served by [[Ajloon]], his short-lived second-in-command of the Night Guard. Despite his subordinate's shortcomings, the Prince of Shade respected Aldjoon did his best to impart his wisdon and guidance onto him.\n\nDuring his final years Yder's relationship with his father [[Telamont Tanthul]] began to fracture. The repeated failures endured by the Netheril empire along with the deaths of Yder's brother Rivalen took its toll on father and son. Yder resented the fact Telamont did not truly dedicate himself to the worship of Shar.",
        "History": {
            "15{{th}} Century": "{{Quote|Even if you are right, the [[Cycle of Night]] has been stopped. Now you must serve Shar, if you wish her hep in the War.|Yder, to Telamont in [[1486 DR]].}}\n\nYder played an important role in the  invasion of [[Cormyr]] during the late 15{{th}} century DR, but was unsuccessful in claiming its capital of [[Suzail]]. During the events of the [[Second Sundering]], Telamont Tanthul refocused his efforts on the identification and apprehension of the various [[chosen]] of the gods.{{Page needed}} \n\nWhile in Cormyr in the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, Yder was tasked by his father Telamont to hunt down two of these chosen: [[Joelle Emmeline]] the [[Heartwarder]] of [[Sune]], and [[Malik el Sami]], [[Cyric]]'s resurrected Seraph of Lies. The pair were in possession of a powerful artifact desired by Shar, the ''[[Eye of Gruumsh (relic)|Eye of Gruumsh]]''. Yder's soldiers drove them out of the beleagured city of [[Marsember]] and into the company of two other chosen fleeing the city, the [[Helm]]ite champion [[Kleef Kenric]], and the noble-born devotee of [[Siamorphe]] [[Arietta Seasilver]].\n\nYder slew Arietta's father [[Farnig Seasilver|Farnig]] and captured her mother [[Elira Seasilver|Elira]] aboard the [[Wave Wyvern|family's ship]] at sea. This bold maneuver drew the four chosen out from hiding and forced them to commit to a path that Yder could easily follow. The Shadovar general penetrated the mind of the guardsman Kenric, granting him insight during the pursuit across the lands of [[Turmish]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] and eventually the [[Chondalwood]]. \n\nHaving disappointed High Prince Tanthul by letting the chosen flee Cormyr, Yder was forced to relinquish the Night Guard back to Thultanthar. Fearing his father would take his frustration out on the Hall of Shadows, Yder rebuked his Telamont's order and directed Ajloon to lead the Night Guard in protection of the temple by any means necessary.\n\nYder and his remaining Night Guard finally confronted the four chosen at [[Sadrach's Spire]] in the [[Underchasm]]. Despite the prince's best efforts, they were unable to retrieve the ''Eye of Gruumsh'' and Yder was struck down by Kenric, who gained renewed power as his god Helm returned to the Realms."
