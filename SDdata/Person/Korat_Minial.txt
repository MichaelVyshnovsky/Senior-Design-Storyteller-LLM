Korat Minial owned Lights in the Dark within the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Korats shop specialized in offering lamps and lanterns that gave off different colors of light. He claimed that certain colors complimented different occasions better than others. Whether or not this was true was irrelevant, since it attracted customers and made for interesting conversation.
