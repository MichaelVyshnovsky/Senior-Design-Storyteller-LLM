'''Korat Minial''' owned [[Lights in the Dark]] within the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Korat's shop specialized in offering lamps and lanterns that gave off different colors of light. He claimed that certain colors complimented different occasions better than others. Whether or not this was true was irrelevant, since it attracted customers and made for interesting conversation.

Korat employed two craftsmen who made all of the lamps sold by the store.
