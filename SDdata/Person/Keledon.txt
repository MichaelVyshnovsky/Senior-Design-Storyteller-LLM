'''Keledon''' was a [[ghost]] who was the husband of the [[elf|elven]] songstress of the [[Elfsong Tavern]].

==Appearance==
Keledon was located through a door in the [[Onyx Tower]] and manifested as a ghostly apparition.

He appeared to be wearing a tattered green cloak. His hair, although balding, was white. His body resembled a skeletal structure. Keledon often hovered above the ground.

==History==
Keledon was a soldier of the [[Westering Sun]] under [[Eldrith]]'s command. Because of her treachery, Keledon and his men met their fate in the [[Marsh of Chelimber]]. Keledon knew the story of the elven maiden who sang in the Elfsong Tavern. He left his wife within the walls of [[Baldur's Gate]], where she would be safe. He described her as the most beautiful elven maid, and he revealed that the voice in the Elfsong Tavern was his wife, who sang in lament for him.

Both spirits could not reunite until Eldrith was defeated.
