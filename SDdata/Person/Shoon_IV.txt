'''Shoon IV''' ({{Pronounce|SHOON|refs={{Cite adventurers league/A Wrinkle in the Weave|12}}}}) was the first [[Necromancy|necromancer]] emperor of the [[Shoon Imperium]] and the second-most evil and infamous of all its emperors.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 5}}

==Personality==
Shoon IV was arrogant, bold, and manipulative and had a famous bad temper. In his favor, he was also a master of domestic and foreign policy, because of his impressive foresight into such matters.

==Possessions==
Shoon IV possessed a pair of rings, [[Annulus Qysarus Major]] and [[Annulus Qysarus Minor]]. The former ring acted like a ''ring of [[spell turning]]''; the latter as a [[ring of spell storing]]. If both rings were worn together, Shoon IV also gained the powers of a ''[[ring of vampiric regeneration]]''.

Shoon IV also creafted a powerful magic [[scimitar]] called [[Ghazir|''Ghazir the Desert's Edge'']].

His greatest magical work, rumored to include a ''create mythal'' spell, was called the ''[[Necroqysarus]]''. It included twelve volumes of magical spells. It was lost to history after the fall of the Imperium.

==Activities==
Shoon IV was a [[wizard]] of ever-growing power. He amassed a vast amount of magical knowledge and [[artifact]]s in his thirst for power.

One of his most significant magical achievements was the invention of a spell to create a [[mythal]]. He was the only non-elf ever able to do so. Using its power, he surrounded the entire palace in [[Shoonach]] with a magical field that only permitted necromantic spells to work, and he cast similar fields around the necropolis of [[Debukkher]] within that city as well. He used [[undead]] in his armies, which greatly disturbed most of his nobles, who feared his reckless powers.

He gained his largest collection of magical artifacts when he slew the [[silver dragon]] [[Rhimnasarl]] and carried off the great treasures from her lair.

Politically, it was his reign that saw the Calishar Emirates evolve into what would soon become [[Amn]]. He made a treaty with [[Dalagar]] of [[Andlath]]&mdash;or perhaps magically coerced him&mdash;to build a [[Tethir Road|trade route]] from [[Ormath]] to [[Athkatla]]. He was also influential in the rise of the demihuman realms of [[Tathtar]] and [[Meiritin]], which he sought to exploit to his own ends.

For civic works, Shoon IV erected the two [[Sea Towers]] in the [[Nelanther Isles]], which served as lighthouses for his fleet as they passed through those islands, and the [[Beckoning Tower of Shoon|Beacon Tower of Shoon]], another lighthouse located on the largest of the [[Beacon Rocks]] off the coast of [[Samarach]].

==Relationships==
Shoon IV was the grandson of [[Amahl Shoon V]] and the brother of [[Amahl Shoon VI]]. He had a single son, but that son married three separate times and produced many grandchildren for Shoon IV.

Shoon IV had a close relationship with the young [[Emyr]], child heir of [[Tethyr]], and the latter saw Shoon IV as a mentor.

Shoon IV made enemies with the great [[blue dragon]] [[Iryklathagra]], triggering her hatred toward [[Calimshan]] that would last for centuries.

Shoon IV was born in the [[183 DR|Year of the Murmuring Dead, 183 DR]]. Only fifteen months after his brother became [[Alzhedo dictionary#Q|qysar]], Shoon IV assassinated him by arranging for a poisonous scorpion to find its way into Amahl's bed. In this way, Shoon IV became the next emperor in the [[205 DR|Year of the Greengrass, 205 DR]].

For nearly twelve years, Shoon IV had attempted to dispel Tethyrian riots and terrorist activities in [[Ithmong]] and the villages between it and Shoonach. In [[231 DR]], the emperor finally lost his patience and unleashed a horde of [[zombie]]s, [[skeleton]]s, and [[wight]]s upon the rebels, created from dead slaves and villagers of Tethyr. This [[Death Parade]] attacked on the night of [[Marpenoth 30]] and decimated all known rebels. In the morning, the undead were returned to death, but the fear of incident lived on among the populace of Ithmong and its vicinity.

In [[236 DR]], Shoon IV sought to destroy the silver dragon Rhimnasarl the Shining, because the dragon was strongly opposed to Shoonite rule. Shoon conspired with the [[blue dragon]] [[Iryklathagra]] and learned a way to defeat the great wyrm. However, Shoon betrayed Iryklathagra and defeated and killed Rhimnasarl before Iryklathagra could challenge the other dragon to a formal duel. He then kept all the plunder for himself. Enraged, Iryklathagra attacked Shoon and severely wounded him, but she was driven off and retreated to the [[Marching Mountains]] to patiently plan her revenge against the Shoon.

[[238 DR|Two years later]], when [[Elminster Aumar]] defeated the Mad Mage [[Ihundyl]], who had previously conquered the [[halfling]] realm of Meiritin, Shoon IV reconquered that small country. Secret plans were uncovered, revealing that Ihundyl had previously conspired with many of the disgruntled nobles of Calimshan to attempt to remove Shoon from power. In retribution, Shoon IV ordered the deaths of 232 of the conspirators and their relatives for treason.

[[229 DR]] was the year in which Shoon IV succeeded in scribing his ''create mythal'' spell. During its casting, he survived the process by sucking the life forces from all the six other casters whom he had deceived into assisting him. Four of the assistant casters were elven [[sorceress]]es, and they were said to haunt the ruins of the [[Shoonach]] as [[banshee]]s.

Shoon IV's decision not to interfere in the founding of the country of Tathtar proved problematic initially for his empire, as that young country tried to expand into Tethyr. It took Shoon IV ten years to force a peace treaty with them in the year [[240 DR]].

It was Shoon IV's intent to become a [[lich]] and rule in perpetuam. He sustained himself with magic until he had almost reached one hundred years of age. All of his heirs had mysteriously died off, with the exception of his great-grandaughter Munaa yr Oma el Shoon. Shoon formally named her as his heir, even though she was a woman and this angered his advisers, but he never expected her to actually rule. She in fact did, however, because, despite his great magical power, his transformation to a lich failed, and he died in [[281 DR]]. Munaa took the name [[Shoon V]] and became the first empress of the Imperium.
