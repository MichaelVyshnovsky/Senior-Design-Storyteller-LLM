Lucifuge was an incipient archdevil, eaten by Asmodeus before he ever did much of anything.
Per Nergal, Lucifuge was the child of Beherit and Batna. He was eaten by Asmodeus shortly after his birth, and his parents were both slain for begetting him without permission Nergal claimed to be a direct witness to the devouring.
