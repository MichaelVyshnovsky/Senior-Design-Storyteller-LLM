'''Lucifuge''' was an incipient [[archdevil]], eaten by [[Asmodeus]] before he ever did much of anything.

==History==
Per [[Nergal (archdevil)|Nergal]], Lucifuge was the child of [[Beherit]] and [[Batna]]. He was eaten by Asmodeus shortly after his birth, and his parents were both slain for begetting him without permission; Nergal claimed to be a direct witness to the devouring.
