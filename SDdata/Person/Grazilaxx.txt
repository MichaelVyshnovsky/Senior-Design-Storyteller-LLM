'''Grazilaxx''' was a [[mind flayer]] member of the [[Society of Brilliance]] during the late 1480s or early 1490s DR.

{{Quote|You studied hard. How delicious!|Grazilaxx.}}

==History==
Grazilaxx once had an arrangement with the [[lich]] [[Zarifrax]] wherein Zarifrax would rip the souls from his captives and then give their bodies to Grazilaxx to eat their brains. It eventually founded and joined the Society of Brilliance; having done so alongside [[Blurg]], [[Omeluum]], [[Sloopidoop]], [[Y]], and [[Skriss]].<ref name="BGIII" >


Grazilaxx and all the other members of the [[Society of Brilliance]] went on a pilgrimage to [[Gravenhollow]] some years before the [[demon]]ic crisis that struck the Underdark in the late 1480s [[DR]].

During the late phase of the crisis, Grazilaxx surprisingly helped [[Regis]] and [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] in fighting the [[demon lord]] [[Demogorgon]] near [[Mantol-Derith]].
