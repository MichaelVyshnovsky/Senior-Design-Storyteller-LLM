Thrix the Profane was a cornugon that served under Belhifet in Avernus for at least a centurys time.
While he obeyed Belhifet to the letter, Thrix was insightful enough to see when his masters time was at an end. He was also opportunistic enough to aid anyone that appeared to be a threat to Belhifets reign.
The devil had grown somewhat weary of his master Belhifet, particularly after his failed attempt to conquer Easthaven and the other Ten Towns using the Crenshinibon.
Thrix served Belhifet from his escape onto Toril in the  to well into the 14 century DR.
In the , he encountered the Hero of Baldurs Gate after the imp masquerading as Hephernaan opened the portal beneath Dragonspear Castle. He proposed a wager to the Bhaalspawn if the hero could answer a unique riddle, he would grant them a powerful magical item and passage into the Basalt Tower, if they couldnt, Thrix would claim their soul or that of one of their companions.
