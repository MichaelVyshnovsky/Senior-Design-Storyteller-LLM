        "mainbody": "King '''Errilam''' was the thirteenth king of the [[Lions' Dynasty]] of [[Tethyr]].",
        "Personality": "Errilam was a very kind man, and he was well-loved by the people of Tethyr. He wrote just laws and was friendly to rich and poor, [[human]] and [[elf]].",
        "Relationships": "Errilam was the third son of King [[Haedrak II]]. He was uncle to [[Alemander III]]. Errilam had no sons.",
        "History": "Errilam was born in the [[1236 DR|Year of the Struck Gong, 1236 DR]].\n\nIn [[1274 DR]], Errilam's sister Cyralna died in labor while on a visit to [[Waterdeep]]. Before this news had even reached Tethyr, his brother Toram arranged for the brutal murder of his sisters Chynnil and Pyriiss and his five nieces, the daughters of his older sister Kessynna. When his father Haedrak heard of these eight deaths of his beloved daughters and granddaughters, he died of shock. Errilam immediately succeeded his father and ordered the deaths of Toram and his co-conspirator Lord [[Kyvan Emveolstone]]. The two criminals were drawn and quartered.\n\nIn only his third year as king, in [[1277 DR]], King Errilam died in a hunting accident while pursuing an [[owlbear]]. Errilam was succeeded by his nephew Alemander.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Because some of his hunting companions were friends of his who were elves, rumors started that the elves had secretly had him assassinated. In this case, the rumors were indeed true; King Errilam's assassination had been orchestrated by the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]]."
