Floshwa was a female loxo wizard and a member of the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company, based in Mindulgulph Castle just south of Priapurl on the Dragon Coast.
In the 1360s DR, Floshwa went with the company to the Eastern Shaar, where they took an extended contract with the gold dwarves of the Great Rift. Their purpose was to study the chances of war in the local Underdark. They were still here at the end of 1367 DR. During this time, Floshwa joined her commander, Gayrlana, and a wemic named Karrlon on a scouting expedition in the Shaar.
