'''Karima''' was a [[Monkey hengeyokai|monkey]] [[hengeyokai]] [[bushi]] in [[Aru]] in [[Wa]] in the 1770s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==Description==
In human form, Karima was small with long slender arms. His face was broad and his nose flat. He was never without a smile on his face. He never donned [[armor]] but always had his [[katana]] with him.

==Personality==
Karima was highly curious and talked incessantly, but usually about pointless and silly things.

==History==
Around [[1357 DR|Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR)]], Karima may have become very fascinated by a group of adventurers in Aru, finding their exploits entertaining. He followed them everywhere to watch them work, though he would not get involved, neither to help them nor to hinder them. He could list almost all that they had done in Aru, focusing on what was most interesting, funny, or just embarrassing. He was, in short, their biggest fan. If caught and confronted by them, he would smile and wave and explain himself. If they told him to go away or tried to drive him off, he'd say he understood, but even if they didn't see him, he would still be there, watching.
