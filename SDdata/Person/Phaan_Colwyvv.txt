'''Phaan Colwyvv''' was a Tessarch of [[Amn]]. He was one of only two surviving members of the original [[Council of Six]] set up in [[1333 DR]]. At this time, he entered the council as a Pommarch, but rose to Iltarch in [[1345 DR]] and Tessarch in [[1362 DR]].

==Description==
Phaan had a hooked nose and was notoriously miserly, focusing on finances and ways to make more profit. He had a cold manner.

==History==
Phaan knew Iltarch [[Rhinnom Dannihyr]] well but trusted him little because they'd once worked together as [[Shadow Thieves]], where Phaan was a spy, nicknamed "Shar's Gallant". Phaan killed all five of his older brothers to become the head of the family, but the family's power was decreasing in 1333 DR, at which point he was invited to join the Council of Six by [[Thayze Selemchant]].
