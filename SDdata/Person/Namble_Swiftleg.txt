Squad Leader Namble Swiftleg was a human male and Council Army officer of Squad 4 in the Second Battalion of the Amnwater Blues Regiment, based in Eshpurta, in the .
Namble was a robust, active, honest, and sociable man who commanded the complete loyalty of his squad of soldiers, two men and two women.
Namble was in possession of a magic longsword called Blackflame that was superbly good against undead. The entire sword became enveloped in ominous-looking but harmless black flames, as a warning to its owner whenever it was within  of an undead creature.
In 1362 DR, Namble and the Amnwater Blues were sent into the hills upstream of Trollford to chase up reports of trolls attacking farmers. The trolls were few in number and easily dispatched, but the soldiers also found the village of Moonhearth, a secluded and idyllic place devoted to Selûne. During their brief stay before returning to Eshpurta, the soldiers fell in love with the village and its people, and some even began courting the locals. Namble and the other soldiers would visit the place whenever they could find the time, and considered it their home.
Namble became engaged to the local woman Arayea Beaufort, but tragedy struck in 1367 DR when her younger sister Sharill, the villages "Daughter of Selûne", became mysteriously ill and people began disappearing in the village. Namble sought help from adventurers in Eshpurta, and would have them help investigate the mystery Moonhearth. If the adventurers proved cunning and wise, they would have discovered that Sharill had been attacked by a Sharran eastern vampire and turned into one as well. There was even the possibility that the condition could be reversed and Sharill returned to life, in which case he would have gifted Blackflame to the heroic saviors of the village.
