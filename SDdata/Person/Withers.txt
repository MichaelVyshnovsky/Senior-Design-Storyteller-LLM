Withers was the name given to a mysterious being that was interred within an ancient temple of Jergal on the Sword Coast and who remained there until the late 15 century DR.
Withers appeared as a decrepit humanoid corpse, partially wrapped in bandages and clothed in priestly garments, wearing a unique form of metallic adornment across its head and chest. To those attuned as such, Withers gave off an aura of both divinity and eternal, inescapable death.
Withers was capable of "mending the threads" between life and death, in effect offering a form of resurrection.
He possessed an aspect of divine power, comparable to that of a gods chosen.
Withers could not be injured by attacks. He stated, "Fate has not declared mine injury. Therefore it shall not occur."
He carried a simple quarterstaff.

Withers was interred within the temple of Jergal many years before the era of the Second Sundering, in a sarcophagus designed for the "Guardian of Tombs". As of the , Withers was tasked with assisting those that emerged from a crashed nautiloid on the Sword Coast of west Faer√ªn. He was forced to accept and had no choice in the matter.
