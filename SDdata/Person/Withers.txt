'''Withers''' was the name given to a mysterious being that was interred within an ancient [[Temple of Jergal (Sword Coast)|temple]] of [[Jergal]] on the [[Sword Coast]] and who remained there until the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Fate spins along as it should.|Withers.}}

==Description==
Withers appeared as a decrepit [[humanoid]] corpse, partially wrapped in bandages and clothed in priestly garments, wearing a unique form of metallic adornment across its head and chest. To those attuned as such, Withers gave off an aura of both divinity and eternal, inescapable death.

==Abilities==
Withers was capable of "mending the threads" between life and death, in effect offering a form of ''[[resurrection]]''.

He possessed an aspect of divine power, comparable to that of a god's [[chosen]].

Withers could not be injured by attacks. He stated, "Fate has not declared mine injury. Therefore it shall not occur."

==Possessions==
He carried a simple [[quarterstaff]].

==Activities==
In Withers' own words he was an "arbiter of certain matters" and a "servant to obligation". 

==History==
{{Quote|So he has spoken and so thou standest before me. Right as always...Now I have a question for thee: what is the worth of a single mortal's life.|Withers to an adventurer that appeared before his crypt.}}

Withers was interred within the temple of Jergal many years before the era of the [[Second Sundering]], in a sarcophagus designed for the "Guardian of Tombs". As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Withers was tasked with assisting those that emerged from a crashed [[nautiloid]] on the Sword Coast of [[west Faer√ªn]]. He was forced to accept and had no choice in the matter.
