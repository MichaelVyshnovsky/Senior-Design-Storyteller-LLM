Heino was a gnome bard and the leader of Heinos Woodland Troupe, a band of performers that traveled Faerûn in the mid–14 century DR.
Heino was a very friendly individual and at times could be excessively jolly. He viewed himself as a samaritan, helping and looking after the welfare of others.
Heino was capable of casting the following spells
blur, cantrip, change self, clairvoyance, color spray, fear, fools gold, illusory wall, invisibility, Nystuls magic aura, improved phantasmal force, phantasmal force, rainbow pattern, spectral force, and wraithform.
Heino possessed a chime of opening and a wand of illusion.
Heino and his troupe were known to have spent some time traveling with Marcus Wands and a group of adventurers in central Faerûn.
Some time around 1367–68 DR, the sage Elminster charged his apprentice Lhaeo with compiling a comprehensive report detailing the lands of east Faerûn for the Harpers, at the behest of Alustriel Silverhand, High Lady of Silverymoon. The Tethyrian mage reached out to a number of contacts across the realms, and requested that Heino and his fellow performers gather information on the nation of Thay.
In order to gather the information, Heino bribed Thayan officials with bottles of Elminsters Choice, and began their travels just south of the First Escarpment, continuing north to the then-independent city of Amruthar. They continued up the Thayan Plateau by mount and wagon, through Nethentir, inland to the city of Eltabbar, and eventually Tyraturos, before taking the High Road south to the port city of Bezantur. The troupe paid for their journey by performing in the more squalid establishments near the nations numerous tax stations, but endured harassment from legion soldiers and racial prejudice directed at most of their members.
Among the members of the Woodland troupe were a fellow bard named Phillip, the sprite known as Starlight, Darna the dancer, and Grax the half-orc knife-thrower.
