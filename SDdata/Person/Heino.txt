'''Heino''' was a [[gnome]] [[bard]] and the leader of [[Heino's Woodland Troupe]], a band of performers that traveled [[Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Heino was a very friendly individual and at times could be excessively jolly. He viewed himself as a samaritan, helping and looking after the welfare of others.

==Abilities==
Heino was capable of casting the following [[spell]]s:
:''[[blur]]'', ''[[cantrip]]'', ''[[change self]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[fear]]'', ''[[fool's gold]]'', ''[[illusory wall]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[Nystul's magic aura]]'', ''[[improved phantasmal force]]'', ''[[phantasmal force]]'', ''[[rainbow pattern]]'', ''[[spectral force]]'', and ''[[wraithform]]''.

==Possessions==
Heino possessed a ''[[chime of opening]]'' and a ''[[wand of illusion]]''.

==History==
Heino and his troupe were known to have spent some time traveling with [[Marcus Wands]] and a group of adventurers in [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]].

===Journey in Thay===
Some time around [[1367 DR|1367]]–[[1368 DR|68 DR]], the [[sage]] [[Elminster]] charged his apprentice [[Lhaeo]] with compiling a comprehensive report detailing the lands of [[east Faerûn]] for the [[Harpers]], at the behest of [[Alustriel Silverhand]], High Lady of [[Silverymoon]]. The [[Tethyrian]] [[mage]] reached out to a number of contacts across the realms, and requested that Heino and his fellow performers gather information on the nation of [[Thay]].

In order to gather the information, Heino bribed Thayan officials with bottles of ''[[Elminster's Choice]]'', and began their travels just south of the [[First Escarpment]], continuing north to the then-independent city of [[Amruthar]]. They continued up the [[Thayan Plateau]] by mount and wagon, through [[Nethentir]], inland to the city of [[Eltabbar]], and eventually [[Tyraturos]], before taking the [[High Road (Thay)|High Road]] south to the port city of [[Bezantur]]. The troupe paid for their journey by performing in the more squalid establishments near the nation's numerous tax stations, but endured harassment from legion soldiers and racial prejudice directed at most of their members.

==Relationships==
Among the members of the Woodland troupe were a fellow bard named [[Phillip]], the [[Sprite (creature)|sprite]] known as [[Starlight]], [[Darna]] the dancer, and [[Grax]] the [[half-orc]] knife-thrower.
