        "mainbody": "mmon was Marrecs adoptive stepbrother, and his closest friend growing up.\nUnlike his siblings, who cared more for commerce, Emmon loved the wild just like Marrec did. He joined Marrec often in their treks, though he didnt share his martial prowess.\nOne night while they were kids, Emmon and Marrec were caught by a downpour of cold rain while out trekking on a dare. They sought shelter on a cave, where they came across an aggressive bear Marrec managed to keep it at bay with a sharp stick, but not before Emmon was injured.\nHe took up a posting with the village militia together with Marrec, when the latter was sixteen years old. In spite of the extensive weapon drills, Emmon was still not a good swordsman. He took up arms in defense of the village when they were raided by the Durang ogres, and was slain in that confrontation. The sight of his dead body allowed Marrec to unlock his medusa petrifying gaze."
