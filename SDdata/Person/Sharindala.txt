'''Sharindala''' was an [[undead]] sorceress in [[Ripplestones]] during the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
While an undead, Sharindala was mostly grey and brown bones, with some long brown hair still attached to the remains of her scalp.

==Relationships==
She knew [[Caladaster Daermree]] while he was but a boy.

==Abilities==
She had strong wards around [[Scorchstone Hall]], almost certainly of her own making. She was later able to use her spells to regain more of a semblance of life.

==Possessions==
She wielded at least one ''[[wand]]'' that fired volleys of ''[[magic missile]]s'', likely a ''[[wand of missiles]]''. One of the spells she gained afterwards granted her the power to speak, despite being reduced to bones.

==History==
Sharindala became undead somehow and then her home burned down; due to the strong wards, no one approached.This occurred when Caladaster was just a boy; he recalled the incident when he was an old man in 767 DR, suggesting it was in the late 600s or early 700s DR.

In the {{yearlinkName|767}}, a wandering [[Elminster Aumar]] entered her home to cache away magic so that others might find it; he then came across her animated skeleton, cowering in a closet. Though she attacked him to no effect with her wand, Elminster was not furious or offended. After she refused his offer to help her find lasting rest, he offered her new magic instead, giving her a [[spellbook]]; one of the spells allowed a caster with no throat to speak, even speak magic words. He also bid her use that magic to beseech [[Mystra]] over the spellbook when she had the time.

She later did beseech Mystra, who put some meat on her bones, just enough for her to be able to weep.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|699|17}} After Caladaster Daermree, and the wandering scholars [[Tabarast]] and [[Beldrune]] returned from [[Karsus' Keep]], she showed herself at the local tavern, the [[Fair Maid]]. Her magic had returned her to flesh everywhere above the hips, though she was still far from being able to eat or drink. She asked Beldrune for one of the dressing gowns he brought from [[Karsus' Keep]], but Caladaster gave her the robe he was wearing. They left the place to go for a walk, with Sharindala insisting they had much to talk about, and told all in the tavern that all that had been said of the god [[Azuth]] was true.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|752-753|20}}
