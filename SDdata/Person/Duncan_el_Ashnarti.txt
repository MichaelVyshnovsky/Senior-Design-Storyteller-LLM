Sultan '''Duncan el Ashnarti''' was the ruler of the city of [[Keltar]] in [[Calimshan]] as late as [[1370 DR]].<ref name=EotSS-p108>

==Wealth==
Duncan Ashnarti (who often dropped the article in his name to sound more like a northerner<ref name=EotSS-p108/>), was one of the richest men in Keltar, having made his money through connections in the [[horse]]-breeding, meat-packing, and shipping industries.<ref name=EotS-p56> He was the owner of a number of tanneries as well, which produced the cowhides used by the [[Tenassar Saddleworks]].<ref name=EotSS-p109>

==Rule==
As a ruler, Duncan was a relatively good leader with no need to rely on powerful supporters to keep him in office.<ref name=EotS-p56/> He was receptive to input from his advisers, but he was the one in full control. He was proud of the peacefulness of his city.<ref name=EotSS-p108/>

==Relationships==
A key factor in Duncan's control of Keltar was in the fact that he was also the leader of its only significant crime syndicate, the [[el Ashnarti]] family, which maintained a guild of thugs and enforcers. Having married into the [[el Ahimar]] crime family, he also connected himself into one of the "four families" of Calimshan.<ref name=EotSS-p110> Duncan considered the [[El Kahmir|Kahmir]] clan his rivals.<ref name=EotSS-p109/>

Though ordinarily men in their positions would be rivals, Duncan was a decades-long friend of the [[Alzhedo dictionary#Y|ynamalik]] of the [[Alzhedo dictionary#S|shanate]] surrounding Keltar, [[Uras el Ihak]], and their friendship partly explained the peace of Keltar.<ref name=EotSS-p109/>
