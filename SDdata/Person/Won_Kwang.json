        "mainbody": "'''Won Kwang''', known commonly as '''the Master''', was a noted [[monk]], scholar, and philosopher of [[Koryo]].\n\nIn [[925 DR]], Won established a school for martial arts and other skills in the city of [[Pyong Do]] in the then kingdom of [[Koguryo]]. Won set down its daily routine and defined five rules for the basis of its teachings and the good behavior of its students:\n# \"Loyalty to lawful rulers.\"\n# \"Honor to parents and friends.\"\n# \"Bravery in battle.\"\n# \"Strength in heart and mind.\"\n# \"Mercy and justice in necessary killing.\"\nWon also built a shrine there. By [[1357 DR]], the [[Do Jang of Won Kwang]] was a prestigious military academy that had trained many great generals, even King [[Wanang Sun]]."
