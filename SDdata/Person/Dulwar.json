        "Description": "Dulwar was a thin, small, balding and lithe man well past his youth.",
        "History": "Dulwar became well aquainted with [[Randal Morn]] and [[Mestin Durmark]] in his early years in southern [[Daggerdale]] when they would go on many profiable adventures together.\n\nDulwar moved to Dagger Falls roughly around [[1359 DR]] from southern [[Daggerdale]] and set up his shop selling quality leather of all varieties. His goods were always popular with the locals of the town, even by the garrisoned [[Zhentil Keep|Zhent]] soldiers during their occupation.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], Dulwar helped Randal Morn reclaim Dagger Falls by using his shop as a place to relay information about troop movements and numbers. After the defeat of the Zhents by Randal Morn’s forces Dulwar and his team of tanners worked closely with the priests of [[Lathander's Light]] in the rebuilding of their temple by moving supplies for them.\n\nEven after the reclamation of the dale, Dulwar still operated as a spy for Randal Morn by [[1372 DR]].",
