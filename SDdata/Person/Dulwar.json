He was a friend to and spy for Randal Morn.\nDulwar was a thin, small, balding and lithe man well past his youth.\nDulwar became well aquainted with Randal Morn and Mestin Durmark in his early years in southern Daggerdale when they would go on many profiable adventures together.\nDulwar moved to Dagger Falls roughly around 1359 DR from southern Daggerdale and set up his shop selling quality leather of all varieties. His goods were always popular with the locals of the town, even by the garrisoned Zhent soldiers during their occupation.\nIn 1369 DR, Dulwar helped Randal Morn reclaim Dagger Falls by using his shop as a place to relay information about troop movements and numbers. After the defeat of the Zhents by Randal Morn’s forces Dulwar and his team of tanners worked closely with the priests of Lathanders Light in the rebuilding of their temple by moving supplies for them.\nEven after the reclamation of the dale, Dulwar still operated as a spy for Randal Morn by 1372 DR.\nCategoryHumans\nCategorySpies\nCategoryThieves of 8th level (2e)\nCategoryThieves (2e)\nCategoryRogues of 9th level (3e)\nCategoryRogues (3e)\nCategoryRogues\nCategoryTanners\nCategoryInhabitants of Old Dulwars Leatherworks\nCategoryInhabitants of Dagger Falls\nCategoryInhabitants of Daggerdale\nCategoryInhabitants of the Dalelands\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands\nkg7625n53ew38b91lyqgmm8doxgq1jz"
