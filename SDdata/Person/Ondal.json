He was best known as a vintner who made very good wine.  \nWhen the Spellplague struck in 1385 DR, Ondals manor was destroyed and the mage disappeared and was thought to have perished. Several wagonloads of Ondals wine survived destruction and were recovered. These bottles contained wild magic that was released when the bottles were opened. \nMost accounts depicted Ondal as a kindly wizard."
