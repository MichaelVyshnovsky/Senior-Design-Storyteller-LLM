Gorglak was a duergar guard in Gracklstugh in the late 15 century DR.
Gorglak was well-known as one of the most corrupt members of the Stone Guards. He liked to collect weird weapons.
Circa 1486 DR, Gorglak was at the citys main gate and, for a good price, permitted a party of adventurers to escape drow slavers of Velkynvelve and to enter the city.
