'''Gorglak''' was a [[duergar]] guard in [[Gracklstugh]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Gorglak was well-known as one of the most corrupt members of the [[Stone Guard]]s. He liked to collect weird [[weapon]]s.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Gorglak was at the city's main gate and, for a good price, permitted a party of adventurers to escape [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]] and to enter the city.
