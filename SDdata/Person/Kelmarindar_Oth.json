Kelmarindar had an altercation with Volothamp Geddarm once over the scribes affections towards the beautiful apprentices, who, according to Volo, were forced to carry heavy baskets from the market because master Oth was corpulent and lazy. When Volos attention to Dazaratha and Haelume was discovered, Kelmarindar threatened him with being turned into a head of boiled cabbage and made sure the writer was not welcomed in Port Kir."
