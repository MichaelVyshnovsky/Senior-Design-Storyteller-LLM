Annen was a shukenja adventurer in Miyama Province in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Annen lived most of his life in the Konjo temple of Miyama until, in 1357 DR, his master said that to achieve enlightenment he needed to see the world. So Annen, together with his friend the sohei Akirakeiko, went outside the temple.
