Emlar Goldsword was a rogue fighter and a member of House Goldsword of Cormyr.
Elmar was a bald man.
He was loyal to Cormyr but not to the Obarskyrs. In fact, he cleaved to Sembia and hated and feared the Obarksyrs. He preferred rule by a merchant council, but was too cowardly and too wise to actively rebel.
