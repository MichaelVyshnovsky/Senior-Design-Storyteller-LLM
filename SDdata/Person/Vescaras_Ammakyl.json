In fact, it was only due to Dahls abrasive personality. Behind Dahlâ€™s back, he actually spoke fondly of the Oghmanite paladin, and considered him a valued asset to the Harpers, something he admitted to Farideh when Dahl had to leave Cormyr suddenly due to his family being endangered. His fellow agent Khochen once claimed to have had a sexual affair with him, but this ultimately turned out of be false."
