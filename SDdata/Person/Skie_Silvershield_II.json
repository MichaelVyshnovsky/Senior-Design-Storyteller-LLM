        "mainbody": "'''Skie Silvershield II''' was a noblewoman from the wealthy [[Silvershield]] family living in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-10-09 - Silvershield family (Part 2)}}{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-10-09 - Silvershield family (Part 1)}}",
        "Personality": "She became the authoritative and unyielding matriarch of her family in Baldur's Gate.",
        "Relationships": "Skie was the elder daughter of [[Torlin Silvershield]] and [[Evelyn Silvershield]].\n\nShe secretly observed her son [[Ralagondar Silvershield|Ralagondar]]'s actions through her spies, among whom was the [[doppelganger]] [[Seldrorn]]. Despite Ralagondar's attempts to conceal his wrongdoings, his amusing behavior thoroughly entertained her, and she was quickly becoming a devoted admirer of his deeds.",
        "History": "Skie was born in the Silvershield family and lived in the [[Silvershield estate]] in Baldur's Gate. Her family's substantial wealth allowed them to allocate several thousand [[Gold|gold pieces]] for the acquisition of an operatic chandelier, complete with [[whispering candles]], for her cotillion ball.\n\nSkie's first marriage with [[Ostrand Beldaerhallow]] was arranged when she was five, but he passed away mere months later. She was married again to [[Atelburt Maerbraunt]] later that very year.According to [[Ed Greenwood]]'s tweet, in noble circles of Baldur's Gate, it wasn't uncommon to arrange marriages involving very young individuals, often intended to solidify legacies and alliances. Nevertheless, this tradition was losing popularity as the years went by, largely due to widespread dissatisfaction in these unions.\n\nHer husband Atelburt was eager to have offspring immediately, so he used a powerful and contemptible spell to accelerate her aging. From around the {{YearlinkName|1472}}, she gave birth to a son, Ralagondar, and two daughters, [[Paerevelle Silvershield|Paerevelle]] and [[Elnantra Silvershield|Elnantra]]. Her forced aging didn't lead to any development of love within this marriage and they grew apart even more. When she was near 18 years of age in [[1492 DR]], she could be described as \"elderly\".\n\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1494}}, her second husband Atelburt died. By this time, some of the influential family members had left the Gate and Skie became the leader among the Silvershields still living in the city."
