'''Tirin''' was a successful [[horse]] breeder from the forest town of [[Waymoot]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, Tirin was a well-known horse breeder whose [[Tirin's horse farm|farm]] stood on the western edge of Waymoot. Tirin made much [[coin]] by purchasing tired and blown dray-horses from travelers who rushed along [[Calantar's Way]] for cheap and sold them replacements at twice the price. In 1348 DR, [[perfume]] merchant [[Peraegh Omliskur]] sold his beasts of burden to Tirin at a loss, trying to move quickly to his next destination. Unbeknownst to all, the murderous [[Zhentarim]] agent [[Horaundoon]], the Eater-of-Mantles, disguised as a wrinkled old man, hitched a ride with Peraegh's cart pulled by Tirin's horses.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Tirin still offered quality horses, but his services were nowhere as popular as those of [[Llamskir]], whose farm was across the road from Tirin's.
