Urnst was a potter from Kuldahar in the Spine of the World.
The white haired human wore a brown tunic and grey pants.
The potter was a fearful man who stuttered.
In Eleint, 1281 DR, Urnst spoke of fleeing to Baldurs Gate once the weather got better after villagers were kidnapped by the lizardfolk of Dragons Eye.
