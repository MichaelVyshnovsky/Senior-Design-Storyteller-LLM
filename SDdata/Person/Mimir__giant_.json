        "mainbody": "'''Mimir the Wise''' was a [[mountain giant]]{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|31}}{{Cite dragon/90/Plane Facts on Gladsheim|37}}",
        "Description": "Mimir stood somewhere around {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} tall, possibly more, His hair was wild and windblown, whilst his beard was unkempt and white in hue. He garbed his body in ragged cloth and skins.",
        "Personality": "Mimir had a demented mind, but an immense wealth of knowledge and wisdom. He sometimes liked to toy with the people that came to use his well, playing dumb as if he didn't know what they were going on about.",
        "Abilities": "The exact powers that Mimir possessed were unknown, though whatever they were put him on par with the [[archdevil]]s of the [[Nine Hells]] and the [[Lady of Pain]]. He also knew far more [[arcane magic]] than [[Toril]]'s greatest [[mage]], [[Elminster]].Mimir the Wise's statblock in the ''[[Planes of Chaos (boxed set)|Planes of Chaos]]'' boxset states his origin as being a [[proxy]], though the text does not specify who he is a proxy of. One possibility is the god [[Mimir (deity)|Mimir]], though ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]'' states that Mimir is a [[dead power]].",
        "Possessions": "A massive ladle, crudely crafted from a fallen branch of [[Yggdrasil]], was wielded by Mimir like a [[club]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|32}}",
        "Activities": "Mimir lived in a cave within one of the two large hills that stood next to the Well of Knowledge. As it was the only thing in life he treated with any sort of reverence or respect, Mimir was dedicated to protecting the Well. Stopping all who would attempt to steal its ''[[power key]]s'', ''[[spell key]]s'', or drink from its waters, demanding a payment for all three. Usually he would pay no great heed to those that weren't either a powerful [[giant]] or a member of the [[Norse pantheon]], resorting to killing them, though he was willing to do business with anyone that presented him a [[favor coin]] as ownership of one showed that the individual seeking his services was powerful to some degree.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|11-12}} Whenever someone asked a question instead of the chance to drink from the Well of Knowledge, Mimir would drink from the Well himself and then answer their query.\n\nIn terms of the planar philosophical factions, Mimir the Wise was considered to be a member of the [[Fated]].",
        "History": "While the average mountain giant had a lifespan of only one hundred years,<ref> Mimir lived for untold thousands of years old. Over the course of that lifespan he drank from the Well of Knowledge, accumulating vast stores of lore over time. He also developed the concept of favor coins as an alternative source of payment to sacrifices, desiring to obtain favors from deities.\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] on the [[Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]] went on an epic journey across [[Asgard]], Jotunheim, and Yggdrasil in search of the Well of Mimir so they could learn how to destroy a powerful [[githyanki]] artifact known only as the ''[[Great Machine]]''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2}} Their benefactors, the [[Ministry of Art]], knew little about Mimir but said that the knowledge it held was far greater than that contained within the halls of [[Candlekeep]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|5}}\n\nEventually the heroes managed to reach the Well and, recognizing that Mimir was far too powerful for them to ever beat in combat, negotiated for the use of the Well with favor coins they had earned over the course of their journey from the goddess [[Sune]] and either the [[frost giant]] [[Brimir]] or Queen [[Titania]] of the [[Seelie Court]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|31-32}} Once all the coins they had were given away Mimir waved the adventurers off, threatening to eat them without a second thought if they ever returned.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|32}} Whether or not any of the adventurers sacrificed an eye, asked for a ''spell key'', or asked for a single draught from the well was unknown."
