In 1491 DR, despite an alliance with a local goblin tribe, a large group of bugbears, led by Hrar, attacked the village and captured many hostages, seizing control of the village and the road to the monastery. Eventually, an adventuring party hired for a mission at the monastery defeated a bugbear patrol, and Sergor then asked their help to free the hostages, including his family, and to defeat the bugbears."
