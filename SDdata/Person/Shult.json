        "mainbody": "'''Shult''' was the innkeeper of the [[Wild Goose]] in [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He was considered a kind old man around [[1367 DR]].",
        "Activities": "As well as running the inn, Shult could procure almost anything a patron could ask for, provided it could fit through the corridors and wasn't outright hazardous. This was thanks to his arrangements with [[Mitchifer]] of the dimensionally neighboring [[World Serpent Inn]]. Shult would deliver it for free, but the patron must pay whatever Shult's vendors charged. Shult also knew how to enter the World Serpent and would sell the secret to those who asked.",
        "Relationships": "He had three daughters, whom [[Volo]] described as jolly, robust, and incredibly energetic about their duties."
