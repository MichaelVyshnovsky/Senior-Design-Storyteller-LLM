Wunturn Radest was the high priest of the temple of Tempus within the city of Mulmaster. 
Radest and the rest of the clergy served the army of Mulmaster as the majority of its forces shared in the worship of the Lord of Battles. A veteran of many battles in just as many campaigns, Wunturn inspired countless soldiers to raise arms against the enemies of Mulmaster.
