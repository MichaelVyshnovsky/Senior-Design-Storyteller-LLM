        "mainbody": "slave\nTymos was a human boy working as a stablehand and messenger in the Yawning Portal inn in Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nTymos and another boy, Harel, were slaves to the merchant and slaver Mather Ukkhemn. In Flamerule of the , Mather dared to stay at the Yawning Portal with the boys in tow, thus angering its proprietor, Durnan, whod reputedly been a slave himself once and despised the practice. Although Mather promised the boys were working for him of their own free will, their fear and their scars were apparent to Durnan and other patrons. Durnan had Mather removed from Waterdeep and gave the boys new jobs as stablehands. Over the next two months, the boys proved themselves to be capable messengers and errand boys on the behalf of the inns guests as well.\nBeneath a charm that could put people at ease and discourage them from seeing the truth, Tymos was a cunning, vindictive, and avaricious young thief.\nTymos went out at nights to pick pockets. He avoided being apprehended by Durnan and the authorities, but had been noticed by fellow thieves in the Dock Ward.\nTymoss friend Harel was trusting and loyal and so ended up innocently covering for Tymoss stealing. Tymos was quite grateful to Durnan for rescuing them, and repaid him by working for him and not robbing him. Durnan was suspicious of their activities, but did not confront them, instead waiting for one or the other to own up or slip up."
