        "mainbody": "Alora was a halfling thief that lived in the Western Heartlands during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nAlora was extremely curious about the world around her and wanted little more than to explore every \"off-limits\" area of her surroundings. She did so with an upbeat attitude and carefree outlook. Her unique charm and sweet demeanor often prevented her from getting into real trouble with the authorities.\nUnlike many thieves she had little interest in material wealth or riches.\nShe had a high-pitched voice that resembled that of a human child. She frequently spoke in \"baby talk\" using words like \"grumpypuss\" or \"hamsty-wamsty\" when referring to a hamster.\nQuite fitting to her chosen profession, Alora owned a lucky rabbits foot.\nthumb|250px|Alora is for the birds.\nAlora grew up as an affable but mischievous child in the city of Iriaebor. She constantly got into trouble when she was young, despite the best efforts of her parents. She felt constrained at home and was not content to the homebody lifestyle that was idealized by so many of the Hin.\nAfter years of mischief, Alora wound up in Baldurs Gate. She soon discovered that her constant yearning for new discoveries could best be fulfilled by life as a thief. In the , she planned a heist to burgle the High House of Wonders in the citys Temples District."
