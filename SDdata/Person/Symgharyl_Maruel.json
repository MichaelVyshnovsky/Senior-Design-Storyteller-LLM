        "mainbody": "'''Symgharyl Maruel''', also known as the '''Shadowsil''', was a powerful [[wizard]] affiliated with the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and the [[Zhentarim]] both.",
        "Description": "She had glossy black hair she kept long, and a lithe and graceful body.{{cite book/Realms of Infamy/So High a Price}}\n\nOn the day of her death, in 1357 DR, she was clad in a robe, breeches, boots, and a half-cloak. She remained young and lush, due to the effects of multiple ''[[potion of longevity|potions of longevity]]''.",
        "Personality": "As a young, she was rebellious, physical, restless, bold, pranksome and free-spirited, somewhat of a tomboy. She became quite confident and promiscuous around her teens. To the eyes of the goddess [[Mystra]], Symgharyl was bound to betray anyone for more power, but she would act in ways that spread magic and develop magic if her selfishness and ruthlessness would be tamped down some.\n\nShe becaome a cold-blooded, unhesitant, remorseless killer after swallowing a piece of a particular ''[[shadow crown]]'', going beyond her initial ruthless ambition{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2009)/08-01 - Relationships in the Realms}} In her altered personality, when angered, she was reckless enough to give away a dracolich's treasure. To the end, she loved [[Elminster]], but she spurned his aid when dying, claiming she was too set in her ways to change, showing rare, but intense, shame at what she'd become.",
        "Abilities": "She had a talent that boosted some of her spells on demand.{{Template:Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2009)/07-10 - The Shadowsil's Power}} Amongst other spells, she had ''meteor swarm'', ''fireball'', and very likely ''hold person''. Other spells of hers included, almost certainly, ''[[fly]]'' and ''[[teleport]]''.\n\nSwallowing a fragment of the ''shadow crown'' had granted ability to see in normal or magical darkness, and the ability to learn any [[Talfirian magic]], including spells such as ''[[shadow walk]]'' or ''[[shadow step]]''.",
        "Possessions": "She carried an enchanted ''[[ring of protection]]'', a ''[[rope of entanglement]]'', a ''[[wand of fire]]'', and a ''[[ring of dragons]]''.\n\nElminster had once gifted her a pair of earrings from [[Myth Drannor]], which he had recovered after her death. Those were [[sapphire]] spindles with hanging [[king's tears]].{{cite book/Cloak of Shadows||15}}\n\nShe gained a ''shadow crown's'' magical powers by swallowing a fragment of it.",
        "Relationships": "Symgharyl seduced one by one each of the adventuring mages that were hired to tutor her, moving to the next after learning all she wanted from them. In order, those first tutors were [[Rindyl Haelmoon]], [[Hendrar Vulbrant]], [[Umiir Kashlakh]], and [[Renchessa Hundaerlysk]].\n\nIn her time within the [[Cult of the Dragon]] she gained a reputation for danger, ruthlessness and competence; many of her fellow Cultists gave her a wide berth, believing it likely they'd be killed, scapegoated, or sent to their deaths if they worked with her. As a member of the [[Zhentarim]], she was as trusted as anyone else. They knew she was drawn irresistibly to magical power.\n\n[[Elminster Aumar]] had been the only person she held admiration or love for, and that she'd been able to trust, mostly because he'd gently denied her advances throughout their time together.",
        "History": {
            "Aftermath": "Symgharyl Maruel's death spurred [[Manshoon]] into personal action, making him head straight to the Knights of Myth Drannor with intent to kill.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|143|8}}\n\nAfter her death, one of her king's tear earrings held her smiling likeness since."
