        "mainbody": "Bismalla bin Alai was a member of the Winged Bulls in 1367 DR.\nBismalla was a polite individual who deferred to those in charge for any decision. He often spoke slowly, since he had to think hard about what he was about to say.\nBismalla was an aging, overweight holy slayer who was well past his prime. It was said that he possessed both the strength and the brains of an ox."
