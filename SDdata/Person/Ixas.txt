'''Ixas''' was one of the [[Wearers of Purple]], a [[wizard]]<ref group="note">Ixas is described as a wizard on SoTM-p5, however his stat block on p30 is that of a Cult Fanatic, with Cleric Spells. and a traditionalist follower of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows over the Moonsea|5}}

==History==
His master remained loyal to the old traditions of the Cult, in opposition to the majority of the Cult that had shifted to [[Severin Silrajin]]'s vision. In order to increase the power of his faction, in the {{YearlinkName|1489}} he sought the power hidden in a village on a small isle near [[Phlan]]. He had his [[kobold]] minions attack the village, but they were defeated by an adventuring party hired to investigate rumors of [[dracolich]]es and [[ghost ship]]s wandering the area, as well as the villagers, who had mastered [[fiend]]ish powers.{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows over the Moonsea|24-26}}

Soon after, Ixas' ship was attacked both by the adventurers and fiendish pirates accidentally released by the adventurers. In the battle, Ixas and his crew were presumably killed.
