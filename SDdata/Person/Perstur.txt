'''Perstur''' was a [[pit fiend]]  in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] slain by [[the Simbul]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, Perstur was one of the [[pit fiend]]s under [[Geryon]] when he came after [[the Simbul]], who was scouring [[Avernus]] in search of [[Elminster Aumar]]. Together with [[Agamur]], he was sent directly to follow a cloud of blue fire, in which the Simbul was hiding; all of the pit fiends close to it were crushed later, when a mountain crag was magically thrown on top of them all.
