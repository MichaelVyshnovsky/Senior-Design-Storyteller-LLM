        "mainbody": "Incylia was a priestess of Ilmater in the late-13 century DR.\nPrior to 1281 DR, Incylia lived in an Ilmatari monastery that was located just outside of Illefarn. On that year Incylia and the rest of her fellow clergymen had their minds dominated by an Ilmtari priest named Poquelin, who in reality was the devil Belhifet in disguise.Belhifet is erroneously referred to as a demon in both Icewind Dale and Icewind Dale II. This is overridden by the later sources Dragon #278 and Baldurs Gate Siege of Dragonspear, where he is referred to as a devil.\nMesmerized by Poquelin, Incylia and the other Ilmatari followed him north into the region of Icewind Dale. They then traveled through the Kuldahar Pass, losing many of their fellow clergymen along the way, and down into the ruins of the dwarven fortress Dorns Deep.\nIn the Lower Depths of these ruins she and four others were instructed to guard the magical idol inside what had once been a temple to the dwarven god Berronar Truesilver, with Brother Harken stationed next to her. While guarding the idol they and the other Ilmatari were individually surrounded by a magical barrier. Overtime they watched as Poquelin became more militant and fascist, but the magic of the idol had them too enthralled to resist and made them believe his words superseded the gospel of Ilmatar. Those outside the idols range tried to resist him and for their efforts were transformed into undead guardians for the idol, such as boneguards, mummies, and zombies.\nEventually, a group of adventurers arrived that year and destroyed the idol, thus freeing Incylia and the rest of her fellow Ilmatari from its dominating effect. Once freed Incylia initially had no memory of where she was or what she had done, but the memories of her time under the idols control quickly flooded her mind and kindled a great sense of shame for her actions."
