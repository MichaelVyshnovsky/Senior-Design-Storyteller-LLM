        "Activities": "Sometime around [[1372 DR]], War-leader Wolmad usurped power from the dying chieftain and led the Sky Ponies in a campaign of banditry in [[Old Delzoun]]. He singled out the dwarves of the region, often raiding their passing caravans.\n\nAfter years of fighting with the [[orc]]s of the Nether and [[Rauvin Mountains]], Wolmad developed a twisted sense of ownership of the valleys between and demanded monetary tribute for anyone passing through what he referred to as \"his lands\"."
