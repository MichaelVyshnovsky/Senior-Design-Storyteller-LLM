        "mainbody": "'''Klaus''' was the Assistant Sniffer, a gateman, employed by [[Lucretious]], the proprietress of of the [[Circus of the Last Days]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Klaus was a handsome [[wood elf]] with sharp features, slightly tan skin, brown wavy hair streaked with red, and brown eyes. He wore a loud colorful performer's outfit of blues, gold, and green.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Klaus and the Principal Sniffer [[ghoul]] [[Benji (ghoul)|Benji]] could be found at the gate of Lucretious's circus in [[Rivington]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], where the extra-planar troupe performed for a short period of time, before moving on to another world. In lieu of recently surging murders in the Gate, Benji was tasked with sniffing out blood on every guest entering the circus. The ghoul was supervised by Klaus, the Assistant Sniffer, who allowed patrons through the locked gates. One of the sniffees was the commoner man named [[Montgomery]], who brought his son to see the famed [[Dribbles]] the clown. Even though the father and the son both were clean, the boy was terrified of the blood-covered jester ghoul and refused to enter the circus."
