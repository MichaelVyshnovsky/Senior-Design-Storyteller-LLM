Among other survival techniques, her ranger brother taught her some of the Orc language.\nIn 1370 DR, Tryola Perrentine was to attend the wedding of her sister Devana and Rivven Melshimber in Waterdeep. During her travel to the City of Splendors for the ceremony, she somehow ended up in Skullport, where she was ambushed by a band of orcs. The orcs who snatched the noblewoman were a part of the marauders of Horazak. Tryola was taken to an ancient prison and mines in Undermountain that once belonged to Clan Melairkyn. She hoped to get rescued, but with time passing, she realized that her family likely thought her dead. Not losing hope, she befriended a fellow prisoner, a dwarf named Urkantor of Clangeddins Hearth. Together they managed to escape the prison and slip into the mines to the orc leaders unending rage. Even though the two were soon recaptured, they were granted freedom after Khelbenite, a trusted adventurer agent of Khelben Arunsun, infiltrated the prison and decimated the orc forces. Thankful for the aid, Tryola told the adventurer all the things she overheard in Orcish while imprisoned, namely of Horazaks unholy alliance with the drow who plotted Waterdeeps downfall."
