Zuras el Ireen was the Grand Yrshelem of Ships of the Rundeen in 1370 DR.
Zuras started as a pirate in service to the Rundeen. When he became bored of life at sea, he asked his masters for permission to join a shipping business. In five years, Zuras became the leader of the shipping business and so, with the blessing of the Rundeen, he started a new shipping business in an other city. His business skills and his pirate contacts guaranteed a premier position for his company in that city. Slowly, Zuras retired from the company, which remained in the control of his heirs, and started overseeing all shipping business for the Rundeen. It was only natural in 1357 DR to promote Zuras to Grand Yrshelem of Ships when his predecessor died of old age.
