        "History": "When an exiled priest, [[Kesson Rel]], moved the Hall of Shadows to the [[Plane of Shadow]] in order to capture the [[shadow dragon]] [[Furlinastis]], Avnon Des chose to sacrifice himself and the remaining priests of the Hall of Shadows in order to release Furlinastis from the soul spell that Kesson Rel had put on the dragon. But Avnon and the other priests lived on as spirits.\n\nWhen [[Erevis Cale]]'s party destroyed Kesson Rel, in gratitude Avnon and his fellows agreed to protect the [[Abbey of the Rose]].\n\nFinally, in the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, the [[Oracle]] released the spirits from their service and they went to serve [[Drasek Riven]]."
