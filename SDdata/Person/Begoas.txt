Begoas the Inquisitive was a handsome human necromancer from the Old Empires region and the first Minister of Necromancy in the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art in the 14 century DR.
Begoas was a soft-spoken individual, prone to giving wise advice. He had a deep fascination with human anatomy, a fascination that some believed had no boundaries. When it came to necromancy, Begoas was very outspoken against the prejudice of Ravens Bluffs populace, saying that his study of that school of magic was done for the purpose of opposing those who would use it for evil purposes, though many Ravenians didnt believe his protestations.
Begoas was born somewhere in the Old Empires region, and was speculated to be either Mulhorandi or Untheri.
Begoass time in the Ministry of Art began with its formation by Lord Mayor Charles Oliver OKane in the , shortly before the month of Flamerule. During those early days, public opposition towards the formation of the governing body included criticism of the inclusion of a representative for the necromancy school of magic, arguing that it was inherently evil.
In Ches of the , the Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild were unified the two wizardly organizations allied their functions and leadership under a new name the Guild of Magical Arts. The Ravens Bluff Trumpeter reported the unification was a desperate act caused by the War with Myrkyssa Jelan taxing the magic and resources of both organizations. Nevertheless, Begoas and his fellow Ministers, along with the ranking members of the Wizards Guild, unanimously approved of the merger. During that time, Begoas coached and led Wizards Guilds members that specialized necromancy.
However, after only two months of operation, the Guild of Magical Arts dissolved in Tarsakh. The Ravens Bluff Trumpeter reported ministers had begun leaving the joint organization to reform the Ministry of Art after quickly becoming disillusioned with Alcides Von Tighes leadership. Those seats that remained with the Guild of Magical Arts included Begoass seat and the seat for wild magic. However, the wild magic seats position was a forced one, as Minister Glora Vano was on the run after being accused of treason for aiding Myrkyssa Jelan. Both organizations were unsure of how to proceed, and no plans for recruiting new Ministers were made.
By Mirtul, 1370 DR, Begoas the Inquisitive was the only member whod returned to the Ministry of Art. Back in the seat of necromancy, Begoas headed an investigation and search for the traitor Glora Vano. His investigation uncovered an ancient tomb that was believed to be the ex-Ministers hideout. The Ministry of Art disclosed the tombs location to any and all adventurers willing to bring Glora Vano to justice.
