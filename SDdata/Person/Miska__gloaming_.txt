'''Miska''' was a [[gloaming]] [[sorcerer]] and [[shadowcrafter]] who served the cause of the [[Underdark Anarchists' Fellowship]].

==Personality==
Prone to inconstancy, Miska rarely committed to any particular task or cause for long. He enjoyed stirring up trouble and then moving on, delighting in the change he could bring to the status quo.

==Abilities==
Miska shared his race's proclivity for [[shadow magic]]; shadow and [[illusion]] [[spell]]s made up a large portion of his casting repertoire. As a shadowcrafter, Miska specialized in strengthening the quasi-real illusions created by the spells ''[[shadow conjuration]]'' and ''[[greater shadow conjuration]]''.

==Possessions==
Among Miska's possessions were a pair of ''[[bracers of armor]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]]'', a ''[[cloak of charisma]]'', a magical [[dagger]], a ''[[pearl of power]]'', and a ''[[wand of baleful polymorph]]''. He also carried [[potion]]s of ''[[potion of gaseous form|gaseous form]]'' and ''[[potion of cure moderate wounds|cure moderate wounds]]''.

==Activities==
Despite his tendency toward transience, Miska was a valued member of the Underdark Anarchists' Fellowship. The organization's leader, [[Marlowe Rodan]], did not think Miska had the devotion necessary to remain with the cause for long. Still, as of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Miska had been a member of the Fellowship for three years, due in large part to enjoying the tasks entrusted to him which kept him from boredom.

Along with other senior members of the Anarchists' Fellowship, Miska undertook missions to recruit new members and facilitate plans and stratagems.

Miska believed Marlowe was grooming him for command of the Fellowship one day. While this probably was not the case, the prospect of leadership both enticed and frightened Miska.
