Priestess of the Purple Cloak Hallabra Burune was a high priestess of Sharess inhabiting Suldolphor in the far eastern reaches of Calimshan in south Faerûn during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Hallabra was a tall woman.
Though publicly she appeared to be cold and proper, Hallabra was quite lustful and energetic with her fellow followers of Sharess.
She was the ranking priestess within the House of the Purple Cloak—a temple devoted to the Lustful Mistress located in the central section of the city.
