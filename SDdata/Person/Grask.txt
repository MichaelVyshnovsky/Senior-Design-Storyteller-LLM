'''Grask''' was a [[dusk beast]] and the companion of [[Sithierel]] on the ''[[Necreme]]'' in the early 1370s [[DR]].

==Activities==
Grask liked to curl up and lie down in the bow of the ''Necreme'', where its two heads could watch over the boat and those who approached it when docked, and then alert Sithierel.

==History==
Grask loyally served Sithierel as the [[shadar-kai (fey)|shadar-kai]] plied the waters of Shadow Swamp ferrying captives between the [[Shadow Citadel]] and the [[Monastery of the Ebon Dome]].

Eventually, in early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], an adventuring party in service to [[Mystra]] likely encountered the pair and defeated Grask and Sithierel.
