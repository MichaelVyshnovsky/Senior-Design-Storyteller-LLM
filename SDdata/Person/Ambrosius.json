        "mainbody": "Ambrosius was a high-ranking paladin of Tyr from Suzail, active in mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nAmbrosius proudly wore the holy symbol of his deity, announcing his faith and standing within the Church of Tyr.\nAmbrosius was an honest Knight of Tyr and loyal subject of the Cormyrian Crown. He did not like spies and subterfuge, even when done on behalf of his king. Unlike many of his fellow paladins, Ambrosius was ready to retreat when dealing with powerful magic or unknown powerful beings.\nLike other paladins, Ambrosius was able to see through lies. That ability was even further strengthened by the paladins perceptiveness and keen mind.\nIn 1360 DR, Ambrosius was a frequent customer of the Black Rat tavern in Suzail. During the tumultuous time directly preceding the Crusade against the Tuigan Horde, King Azoun Obarskyr IV visited the Rat while discussed as an elderly commoner. The King was there to see the reaction of his subjects to the announced war. There, he met Ambrosius, who was able to see through the disguise, thinking Azoun to be one of the kings spies. During that evening, Ambrosius informed the discussed king that many Cormyrians signed up to be part of the army, the paladin himself included.\nAfter the Crusades end, in 1362 DR, Ambrosius was still a frequent customer of the Black Rat. He was present in the establishment, eating a humble breakfast, when Artus Cimber and Zintermi were attempting to identify a mysterious amulet Artus recovered from an unnamed ruined keep in the Stonelands."
