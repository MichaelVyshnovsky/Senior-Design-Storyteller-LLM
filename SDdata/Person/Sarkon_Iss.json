        "Abilities": "When personally engaged in battle, the prince used his natural ability to spin webs to immobilize his foes, while assailing them with waves of dark energy.",
        "History": "Sarkon'Iss undertook a drow led, slave-capturing expedition that targeted villages and farmers in [[Rothé Valley]] during the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. The drow forces enjoyed success for some time, until their operation was put to an end by an [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|adventurer]] from the surface city of [[Neverwinter]]. The prince was slain that year at the hands of that same adventurer."
