Taark Shanat, known as the Crusader, was a dwarf and the founder of the kingdom of Shanatar.
Around , Taark and his eight sons left Bhaerynden, leading a great migration of dwarves journeying westward, and sought to establish a new kingdom. These emigrants eventually took the name "shield dwarves".
Around , the Cloaker Wars broke out, in which Taark and his dwarves came up against the inhabitants of Rringlor Noroth. Taark slew four blue dragons in the Rift of Dhalnadar and the dwarves were victorious.
The skulls of the four blue dragons were brought together by a deity, probably Dumathoin, to form the Wyrmskull Throne, and the site was renamed Brightaxe Hall, founding the kingdom of Alatorin and this is what shield dwarves consider to mark the First Great Age of Shanatar. They founded the great empire of Shanatar beneath the lands that would later be known as Amn, Tethyr, Calimshan, and the Lake of Steam.
