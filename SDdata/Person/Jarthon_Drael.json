        "mainbody": "Jarthon Drael was a male half-elf werebadger from the Moonwood and was the Bloodmaster for the tribe of the People of the Black Blood living there.\nClear of thought and adaptable, Jarthon took great relish in battle and stealth and outwitting his foes alike. Although he was ruthless in combat, often prone to flying in a rage when injured, Jarthon was not above fleeing an unnecessary battle if it could mean his death. \nAs a werebadger, Jarthon could assume the form of a dire badger when pressed in combat. Jarthons skills as a hunter were also accomplished enough to earn him leadership of the Moonwood tribe of the People of the Black Blood.\nJarthon was spartanly equipped, usually with only his mithral chain shirt, magic longsword, dagger, and crossbow (albeit with a few silver-tipped bolts) for protection.\nHowever, Jarthon had amassed a small stash of gold, gems, and a couple of potions of cure moderate wounds back in Claw Hollow.\nJarthon Drael was once a half-elf from Silverymoon who used his skills to hunt down lycanthropes from the People of the Black Blood in the Moonwood, hoping he could protect the people of his city from them. However, on one of his hunts, he was bitten during a werebadger attack and eventually contracted lycanthropy, becoming the very thing he hunted.\nRising to leadership of the Moonwood tribe and based at the refuge of Claw Hollow, Jarthon became a barb in the flank of the people of the Silver Marches. In 1372 DR, he led his tribe in a campaign against the people of Quaervarr, abducting a woodcutter during one of Jarthons monthly High Hunts in the month of Kythorn. When the woodcutters body was found it had a pinned note from Jarthon warning the town to cease expanding into his territory."
