        "mainbody": "'''Reman Byrrd''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]] and brother of [[Ramen Byrrd]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|64|Reman Byrrd}}",
        "Description": "Reman stood {{SI|5'6\"|ft-in}} tall and weighed around {{SI|145|lb|k|long=yes}}. He had willowy blond hair and blue-green eyes. Overall he was very similar in appearance to his brother Ramen, with people finding it difficult to tell the two apart. They even had similar speech patterns.",
        "Abilities": "Reman and his twin brother Ramen shared an uncanny empathetic link. The twins were able to share ideas and thoughts between them without uttering a single word.\n\nHe was capable of casting the [[spell]]s ''[[blindness]]'', ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[deafness]]'', ''[[detect invisibility]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[friends]]'', ''[[flame arrows]]'', ''[[identify]]'', ''[[improved phantasmal force]]'', ''[[knock]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[Melf's minute meteors]]'', ''[[phantasmal force]]'', ''[[secret page]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[spectral force]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[summon swarm]]'', ''[[unseen servant]]'', ''[[ventriloquism]]'', and ''[[wizard mark]]''.",
        "Possessions": "Reman typically wore dark brown and blue clothing, to contrast with the pale colored clothes that his brother preferred. Though sometimes he swapped outfits with his brother to confuse others.\n\nOn his person, Reman Byrrd wore his magical ''[[bracers of defense]]'' and was armed with a ''[[staff of striking]]''. The brothers also owned a ''[[spelljammer]]'' ship.",
        "History": "The most notable event in Reman and Ramen's lives was their father's mysterious disappearance that was punctuated by the arrival of a ''spelljammer'' ship at their home. The twins took this opportunity to turn the magical vessel into an amusement ride."
