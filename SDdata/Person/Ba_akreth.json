        "mainbody": "'''Ba'akreth''' was a [[githyanki]] youth from [[Crèche Y'llek]], on [[Toril]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Ba'akreth had a yellow spotted leathery skin typical for her people and blonde hair.",
        "History": "Youth Ba'akreth, along with other gith of what would become Crèche Y'llek, was brought to the recently claimed [[Rosymorn Monastery]] of [[Lathander]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Soon after, the function of the crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the [[mind flayer]]s in [[Faerûn]] shifted in balance, while Ba'akreth was still a teenager and not fully trained. She continued her military education along with other youths of the Crèche under instructor [[Sa'varsh Kethk]]."
