        "mainbody": "elwyn Tracegar was a War Wizard in Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.\nHe was somewhat invasive with personal space, but meant no unpleasantness.\nHe held a dim view of Surgol Velard, a fellow War Wizard, and seemed to consider Glathra Barcantle unreasonable.\nHe carried a wand of sleep, and a potion of healing.\nHe was a War Wizard of Cormyr.\nIn the original date of the Council of the Dragon in the , Welwyn was among the many War Wizards tapped by Glathra Barcantle to combat the spread of poison gas in the Hall of Justice of Castle Obarskyr, which ultimately delayed the Council.\nDuring the Council, Welwyn Tracegar was amongst those that went into the Hall from the west doors to try and stop the King, Foril Obarskyr I, from being murdered. He later commented to Joreld Nurennanthur, while heading towards Glathra Barcantle to debrief, that he counted Obraerl Foulweather and Lord Briarbroke as no great loss. In their way to moot with Glathra, they completely missed Amarune Whitewave running around palace, and dismissed Mirt doing the same thing as probably nothing.\nGlathra later commanded Tracegar and Nurennanthur to capture Storm Silverhand and Amarune, which they failed at, Tracegar in particular by getting a discharge from his wand of sleep reflected at him his ward nullified it, but he didnt do much afterwards. When, much later, Silverhand, Delcastle, and Whitewave were finally captured, Glathra had Tracegar take responsibility for taking them to the dungeons. Once there, he tried to have the prisoners unchained, considering those unnecessary, but couldnt get the lionar to budge in procedure. While talking to Storm, she wrestled him despite being chained, and allowed the ashes of the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar to get inside him, puppeteering the man.\nPuppeteered by Elminster, Tracegar healed the prisoners, and ushered them out of the cell at wandpoint, This was done with the later approval of Ganrahast, who bade Glathra not investigate once she noticed Tracegar had not only lost the prisoners, but gone missing. Elminster left his body shortly after for that of Reldyk Applecrown, with the help of Arclath Delcastle and the former Royal Magician, Vangerdahast.\nStorm Silverhand and Amarune later attempted to leave Palace by pretending to be Glathra Barcantle and Storm Silverhand in spell-spun disguises. It worked."
