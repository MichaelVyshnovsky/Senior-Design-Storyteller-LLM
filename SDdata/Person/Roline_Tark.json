        "mainbody": "'''Roline \"the Hand\" Tark''' was a caravan guard from the city of [[Daggerford]] who made a fortune selling [[lizardfolk]] teeth to collectors, sometime before [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "Roline wielded her [[enchanted]] [[mace]] against the lizardfolk, who often attacked merchant caravans of Daggerford. The weapon was crafted specifically to battle against the increased threat of the scaled humanoids of the [[Lizard Marsh]]. With time, Roline \"the Hand\" Tark started collecting teeth from the lizardfolk she defeated while protecting her employers' caravans. Later in life, she made a significant fortune selling the teeth to collectors. The name of the mace—the ''[[Teeth Taker]]''—was given to the weapon by the very lizardfolk it was used against. It was a gesture of respect of the magic mace and of Roline Tark."
