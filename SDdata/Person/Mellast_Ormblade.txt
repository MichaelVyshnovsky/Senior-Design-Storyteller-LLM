Mellast Ormblade was a noble in Cormyr during the late 15 century DR.
Mellast Ormblade was the worst sort of snob, but he was genuinely cultivated.
He had a gift with words, and with diplomacy.
Per Arclath Delcastle, Mellast Ormblade ran with a circle that included the lords Broryn Windstag, Delasko Sornstern, Kathkote Dawntard, Irlin Stonestable, Sacrast Handragon, and Marlin Stormserpent. He was one of the more formidable lords there.
Mellast Ormblade was one of the guests at the Open Feast in Mirtul 26 of the , where he briefly inquired with Marlin Stormserpent about a project of the latters. He also was with Broryn Windstags posse when they got kicked out of the Dragonriders Club, and went to Stormserpent Towers afterwards, a few days after.
In the calamitous aftermath of the Council of the Dragon days after, he met with Broryn Windstag and Sacrast Handragon, who were at Staghaven House he brought with himself news of the deaths at Council. While he was there, the moot was joined by Traevyn Illance, Marlin Stormserpent, and briefly visited by Osbur.
