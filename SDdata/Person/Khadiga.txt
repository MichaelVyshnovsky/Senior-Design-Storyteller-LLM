Khadiga was a human shair living on Al-Zabdiyat in the Crowded Sea in 1367 DR.
Khadiga and her giant sea snake pet, Shipwrecker, were the only known inhabitants of the entire island. Khadiga enjoyed her privacy and discouraged visitors by sending inhuman messengers. Ships that ignored her warnings were never seen again.
Khadiga was rumored to be constructing a large domed mausoleum made from clear crystal in the middle of her lagoon.
