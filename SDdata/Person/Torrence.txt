'''Torrence''' was one of the names used by a [[jackalwere]] that lived in or around the city of [[Tilverton]] in [[Cormyr]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|I am known by many names. Who would you like me to be?|Torrence, to [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]].}}

==Description==
In his disguised form, Torrence appeared as a silver-haired [[human|man]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Torrence drew out the solitary [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]], believing him to be a fellow [[antherion]] that would enjoy feasting on the people of Tilverton. He confronted Kelemvor at the city's [[Temple of Gond (Tilverton)|temple]] of [[Gond]], but soon realized the other man was actually cursed with a unique form of [[lycanthropy]] when he made his transformation into a great black [[panther]].

The two were-beasts fought in the city for a brief while, until eventually Kelemvor delivered to Torrence a fatal blow, and the silver jackal lay dying in the street.
