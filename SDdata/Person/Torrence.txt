Torrence was one of the names used by a jackalwere that lived in or around the city of Tilverton in Cormyr during the midâ€“14 century DR.
In his disguised form, Torrence appeared as a silver-haired man.
In the , Torrence drew out the solitary Kelemvor Lyonsbane, believing him to be a fellow antherion that would enjoy feasting on the people of Tilverton. He confronted Kelemvor at the citys temple of Gond, but soon realized the other man was actually cursed with a unique form of lycanthropy when he made his transformation into a great black panther.
The two were-beasts fought in the city for a brief while, until eventually Kelemvor delivered to Torrence a fatal blow, and the silver jackal lay dying in the street.
