        "History": "During an inspection to the [[Neverwinter/Neverdeath|Neverdeath Graveyard]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Awen was ambushed and captured by [[Red Wizard]]s. She was forced to watch a fellow doomguide by the name of [[Stonehammer]] be transformed into an [[undead]] creature before she was ultimately slain herself. Awen returned as a [[ghost]] but was unable to acknowledge her own death for some time.\n\nAt the behest of [[Volahk|Doomguide Volahk]], an [[adventurer]] was sent to cleanse the graveyard and help uncover her whereabouts. The adventurer burned her body to prevent the Red Wizards from using it to carry out a dark ritual, an act that allowed the deceased doomguide to achieve some peace in the afterlife."
