        "mainbody": "Ionoi was the advisor to Tekinjo Gasahan, daimyo of the province of Kurahito in Wa.\nIonoi was from the Isle of the Long Legged and Long Armed, whose inhabitants were exceptionally tiny with long limbs relative to their bodies. As such, Ionoi only stood  tall. Unlike the other inhabitants of his homeland, however, he had short legs, while his arms were still long. Because of this, he had to drag himself along with his dangling, long arms.\nIonoi had a very high voice, sounding like he was squeaking to the ears of normally proportioned humans.\nIonoi was a man of strong moral fabric.\nA knowledgeable philosopher, historian, botanist, and musical scholar, Ionoi was a versatile teacher.\nAs Gasahans personal advisor, Ionoi spent many years giving lectures to his lord, numbering over 1,500.\nIonoi loved Gasahan deeply, and the two were best friends. Nevertheless, Gasahan kept Ionois existence a secret.\nAround , Ionoi was banished from his home island because of how short his legs were. He was placed on a tiny bamboo raft and set adrift. Eventually, he drifted north all the way up the eastern coast of Tsukishima to a beach near the city of Kurahito, where he was discovered by a young man named Gasahan, the future ruler of the province.\nIonoi was very ill and weak from the epic journey over the ocean, but Gasahan nursed him back to health, and the two became close friends. Over the next twenty years, Ionoi, already a learned man at the time, tutored his rescuer. When Gasahan became daimyo, Ionoi became his most trusted advisor."
