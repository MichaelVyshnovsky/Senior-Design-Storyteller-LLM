        "mainbody": "'''Viizra Arabani''' was a [[drow]] [[cleric]] who helped overthrow the [[Underdark]] city of [[Rilauven]] in the late 13{{th}} and early 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].",
        "History": "Viizra, the first daughter of [[House Arabani]], was once a priestess of [[Lolth]]. She later assisted in overthrowing Rilauven, as part of [[Malavon Despana]]'s coup, as she was going nowhere within her House. She was a member of the Masked Traitors, who worked against her House during the coup. During the takeover, she advanced from third daughter of her House to first.\n\nAfter the successful takeover, Viizra became a cleric of [[Vhaeraun]], but was unhappy with her position. She was promised equality, but did not feel as if she'd achieved that, even after risking her life. She longed to be the [[matron mother]] of House Arabani, but that was not possible as long as her brother, [[Dizreth Arabani|Dizreth]] was alive. Furthermore, if Dizreth had any heirs, then they would assume patronage of the house, instead of Viizra."
