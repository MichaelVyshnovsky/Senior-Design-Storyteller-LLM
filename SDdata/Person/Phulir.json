        "mainbody": "Phulir was a member of the Company of the Anvil adventuring company in 1370 DR.\nPhulir was a rather normal-looking individual.\nPhulir was often underestimated by his opponents because of his nondescript appearance, a fact from which Phulir gained advantage.\nPhulir was a old ally of Bramas Thorntree like all in the company.\nIn 1370 DR, he joined the Company, and together they recovered the Sondarr Scepter from a long-forgotten dwarven tomb in the Starspire Mountains. They had been ordered to maintain a low profile and, on their return journey on Uktar 10, stopped at the Blue Badger Inn in the village of Toralth for drink.\nLater that night, three dwarves, Bapar Ghalmrin, Odak Truesteel, and Soram Battlebellow, entered the tavern seeking the Sondarr Scepter. However, the dwarves accidentally engaged in a brawl with the Shields of the Highland adventuring company. Phulir and the others in the Company covered for Bramas and joined in the brawl, so that he could use this as an opportunity to escape with the scepter, but the dwarves eventually caught up with him and recovered it."
