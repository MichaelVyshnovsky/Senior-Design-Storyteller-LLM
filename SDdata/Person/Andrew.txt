'''Andrew''' was a child of [[Highcliff]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Andrew's father, [[Zachan]], told Andrew about the story that thounsands of [[duergar]] fought a battle. This caused Andrew and his brother, [[Alex]], to gain confidence and go adventuring. However, they ended up near [[Highcliff Castle]], where they got cornered by a bunch of wolves. Gera and Zachan asked of thr [[Kalach-Cha]] to rescue their sons. Upon rescuing them, the Kalach-Cha could tell the truth there were twice as many duergar, or lie that there was no battle.<ref>
