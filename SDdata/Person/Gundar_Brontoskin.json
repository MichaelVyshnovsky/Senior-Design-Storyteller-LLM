        "mainbody": "Gundar Brontoskin was the King of Grunwald and the Thunderbeast Tribe.\nThe king was a good looking man who ruled Grunwald with a light touch. \nIn battle, Gundar used a broadsword, a handaxe, and carried hidden daggers on his person.\nBrontoskin was very diplomatic with the Uthgardt barbarians and kept them from raiding many nearby settlements. He was deeply interested in any news from around Faer√ªn. He was said to have won the loyalty and respect of Red Tiger tribe for having slain a leucrotta with only a pair of red tiger claws during a Runemeet."
