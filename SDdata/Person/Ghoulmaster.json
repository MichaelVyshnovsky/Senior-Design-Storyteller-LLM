        "History": "Ghoulmaster was a sinister intelligent [[ghoul]] who worshiped Lolth, the Queen of Spiders, in the mid–14{{th}} century DR. The dark goddess entrusted him with a strange [[artifact]], a part of what appeared to be a stone spider, and tasked the ghoul necromancer with orchestrating attacks on the [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. Ghoulmaster discovered an old Shrine of [[Myrkul]] within the ancient crypt of the [[Cassalanter]] family on the [[Dungeon Level]] of [[Undermountain]]. Corrupting the shrine, Ghoulmaster raised the dead of Waterdeep's noble houses and sent them out to attack the citizens of Waterdeep. The power of the stone spider artifact not only raised and enthralled the dead but also bound their souls to their undead bodies, causing them unspeakable suffering.\n\nThe lone hero recruited by [[Khelben Arunsun]] and the Lords of Waterdeep to stop recent [[kobold]] attacks on the city was tasked with cleansing the Cassalanter family crypt after a skeleton wearing the family's crest was seen attacking Waterdhavians. The adventurer was able to slay the undead, destroy Ghoulmaster, and recover Lolth's artifact. The Cassalanter family generously rewarded the hero for securing the crypt once again."
