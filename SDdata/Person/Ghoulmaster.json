        "mainbody": "Ghoulmaster was an undead necromancer who plagued Waterdeep in the mid–14 century DR.\nGhoulmaster was fully committed to serving Lolth.\nGhoulmaster was a sinister intelligent ghoul who worshiped Lolth, the Queen of Spiders, in the mid–14 century DR. The dark goddess entrusted him with a strange artifact, a part of what appeared to be a stone spider, and tasked the ghoul necromancer with orchestrating attacks on the Lords of Waterdeep. Ghoulmaster discovered an old Shrine of Myrkul within the ancient crypt of the Cassalanter family on the Dungeon Level of Undermountain. Corrupting the shrine, Ghoulmaster raised the dead of Waterdeeps noble houses and sent them out to attack the citizens of Waterdeep. The power of the stone spider artifact not only raised and enthralled the dead but also bound their souls to their undead bodies, causing them unspeakable suffering.\nThe lone hero recruited by Khelben Arunsun and the Lords of Waterdeep to stop recent kobold attacks on the city was tasked with cleansing the Cassalanter family crypt after a skeleton wearing the familys crest was seen attacking Waterdhavians. The adventurer was able to slay the undead, destroy Ghoulmaster, and recover Lolths artifact. The Cassalanter family generously rewarded the hero for securing the crypt once again."
