        "mainbody": "erlis was one of the Blades of the Old Man in the fortress of Sentinelspire. He was a part of the team accompanying Sauk to look for Kheil and secure the Eraellen in the Northern Shalhoond, conspiring to kill the Old Man of the Mountain. He appeared to be afraid of spiders. Kerlis was instrumental to Lewans capture, in order to assure Beruns compliance, but he received a number of painful wounds in the process, which affected his already low standing amongst his peers. He was slain by Berun with an arrow to the eye then, on Tarsakh 16."
