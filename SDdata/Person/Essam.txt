'''Essam''' was an elf from [[Al Qahera]] in [[Raurin]] as of {{yearlink|1374}}. When [[Kiril Duskmourn]] sought to take refuge from a dust storm of the [[Raurin]] in Al Qahara, it was Essam that was at the door and let her in; at the moment, he was wearing a white gown, and a larger, rune-covered cloth over it. Though his features were elven, he was sun-weathered.{{cite book/Darkvision|183-184|19}}

He became interested in Kiril's tale as soon as she mentioned that she sought a source of evil north of their settlement,{{cite book/Darkvision|187-188|19}} and told her of their own experiences with the Storm Spike, as they'd dubbed the [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]]. When Kiril was about to leave, he bequeathed ''[[Sandrul]]'' unto her, hoping she could avenge [[Feraih]] with it.{{cite book/Darkvision|207-211|22}}
