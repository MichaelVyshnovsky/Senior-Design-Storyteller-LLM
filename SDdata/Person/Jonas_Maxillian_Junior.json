        "mainbody": "'''Jonas Maxillian Junior''' was the son of [[Jonas Maxillian Senior]] and [[Gravia Maxillian]], from the lineage of [[lycanthrope]]s that stretched for several centuries. The [[werewolf]] family worked as [[apple]] farmers by day and sated their blood lust at night ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Dad says I'm just a young pup, right Dad?''|Jonas Maxillian Junior}}",
        "Description": "Jonas Maxillian Junior was an overeager and somewhat simple young man who looked a lot like his father, extremely muscular to almost freakish levels.",
        "History": "Jonas Maxillian Junior was born to Jonas Maxillian Senior and Gravia Maxillian several years after Gravia was caught at night by a werewolf and turned, forcefully joining the Maxillian clan. The lycanthropes lived in the [[Maxillian Manor]] of the [[Western Farmlands]] of [[Daggerford]], picking apples by day. Jonas Maxillian Junior was very much like his father and quickly accepted the family [[Malar]]ite customs and creed.\n\nIn 1372 DR, the father and son were luring adventurers and travelers to partake in a \"celebration.\" They offered the guests [[Gravia's hot apple cider]], drugged with [[knockout drops]]. The victims were undressed and dropped within the Chase Maze, a maze underneath the Maxillian Manor, where they were chased and ripped apart by the bloodthirsty father and son. Gravia Maxillian never participated in these chases. She was merely a lesser werewolf and lacked the bloodlust and drive to chase and kill, which strained her relationship with her son and husband. Some of the victims were [[Pettywick Wocket]], a [[gnome]] adventurer, and the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. Jonas Maxillian Junior chased the Hero through the maze, but the adventurer managed to retrieve the equipment and slay both werebeasts.\n\nGravia Maxillian mourned her son but held no grudge against the killer of her family. The Hero helped her find a new and safe home with the [[Church of Sel√ªne]]."
