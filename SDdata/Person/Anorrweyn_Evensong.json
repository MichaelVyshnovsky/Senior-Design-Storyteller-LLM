        "mainbody": "'''''Anorrweyn Evensong''''' was an [[elf|elven]] [[wizard]] leader of the [[Sisterhood of the Silver Fire]], the sect of [[Mystra]] in [[Myth Drannor]], and a close ally of the [[Council of Twelve]] who lost her life in the [[Weeping War]].\n\n{{quote|''The clouds burn! Flee, priestesses, we are undone! Mother Mystra, hear me - so long as my bones rest in your temple, let my spirit walk this plane to do your will!...''|Anorrweyn Evensong}}",
        "Description": "Anorrweyn was a beautiful elven woman, tall, slender, and graceful with long cascading brown hair.\n\nIn life, Anorrweyn Evensong wore a gentle-smelling [[perfume]] scented with [[gardenia]]s, in death, the phantom aroma accompanied her spirit.",
        "Personality": "Priestess Anorrweyn was known for her wisdom as well a tactical prowess and expertise in both arcane and divine magic.",
        "Abilities": "In life, she was an accomplished [[wizard]]s and [[cleric]] of Mystra. Her skills and influence were great enough to be a close ally and advisor of the Council of Twelve. After her death, she remained a powerful creature who wielded her magics in service of the Lady of Mystery, protecting the ruins of Myth Drannor.",
        "History": "Anorrweyn Evensong was born into the noble [[gold elf]] [[House Durothil]] long before the advent of the Weeping War and the destruction of her home, Myth Drannor. During the period of time [[Elminster Aumar]] spent in the City of Song, from [[241 DR|241]] to [[261 DR]], Anorrweyn became inspired by the strange [[human]] man who affected the culture of Myth Drannor to open its doors to the outside world and bring on the golden age. Following Elminster's dedication to the ''Art'', she embraced worship of [[Mystra]] and created the sect dedicated to the Lady of Mystery, the Sisterhood of Silver Fire.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030409112020/http://www.pool-of-radiance.com/story/chars.htm| title = Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor website | accessdate = 03-04-2003| date = 03-04-2003}}\n\nWhen Myth Drannor fell under the wave of the [[Army of Darkness]] in [[714 DR]], Anorrweyn Evensong was fighting for her home along with her closest friends and allies of the Council of Twelve, [[Trasaal]], [[Ualair]], and others. The heiress of House Durothil stood alone at the shrine to Mystra, in the [[Nightingale Court]]. During the battle [[nycaloth]]s unleashed a wall of living flame on the Court and as the city fell and she met her goddess. Her will and love for Myth Drannor and the ''Shrine of the Silver Fire'' were so strong that Mystra granted Anorrweyn power to walk the [[Prime Material plane]] as a [[ghost]], a guarding apparition, tied to the temple where her body was buried.\n\nOver the centuries that followed, Anorrweyn Evensong stood strong, defending her small shrine of ancient sanctity. She made allies, like [[Odelinde]], the Golden Serpent, and [[undead]] enemies who sought to desecrate the shrine. On a rare occasion, Anorrweyn appeared to adventurers who were friendly to the worshipers of Mystra to offer them advice and temporary protection. Each time she stepped into the Prime Material, a ghostly apparition of her shrine materialized as well, as if never destroyed by the Weeping War.[[File:Anorrweyn Evensong.jpg|thumb|''Anorrweyn Evensong, becoming one with the ''[[mythal]]'' of [[Myth Drannor]].''|260x260px]]\n\nAs the City of Song's ruins stood through the centuries, stories of the Mystra ghostly cleric brought surviving members of Sisterhood of Silver Fire in search of council with the founder of the sect. These pilgrimages continued until ''circa'' [[1169 DR]] until the ruins became too dangerous to traverse even for the Mystran worshipers.\n\nSometime before [[1369 DR]], a [[lich]] who was once defeated by Anorrweyn's ghost retaliated by sending his undead minions to desecrate Evensong's grave. The creatures stole her skull, disturbing the priestess's body and the divine enchantments that bound her to the Prime Material plane. The skull was taken into the lich's lair deep within [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]] and Anorrweyn was left powerless, fading in and out of existence in time and space. In her weakened state, the priestess was not able to stop [[dark naga]]s [[Kog]], [[Skerndli]], and [[Gorgat]] claiming the ruined temple of Mystra as their lair.\n\nIn 1369 DR, the [[Cult of the Dragon]] took hold of the elven ruins. Led by [[Kya Mordrayn]], they were able to tap into the immense power of a ''[[pool of radiance]]'' that formed in Castle Cormanthor. Using its foul magics, the cult twisted and wrapped the city's ''[[mythal]]''. The irreparable damage done to the ''mythal'' saddened the goddess of magic, and she placed a call to her worshipers, a call for aid. Elminster heeded the call and assembled adventurers to protect the magics of the ''mythal'' and destroy the corrupted ''pool''. One such group were the [[Veiled Ones]]. The heroes reached the ruined temple of Mystra and slain its evil inhabitants. Next, they placed the ''[[holy symbol]]'' of the goddess onto the altar, giving Anorrweyn Evensong the strength to appear. The elven priestess told them about the ''mythal's'' corruption, about its guardian, [[baelnorn]] [[Miroden Silverblade]], and asked for the retrieval of her skull so the priestess could serve her deity once again.\n\nSubsequently, the Veiled Ones reassembled the undead elven maid's body, returning her to full strength. During the journey, they discovered that the damage done to the ''mythal'' was severe, and the only way or repairing it was replacing the ''[[gem of the weave]]''. Miroden Silverblade's undead existence was tied to the corrupted jewel, and as the last act of protection of the ruins, he shattered the gem, ending his own unlife. With Anorrweyn Evensong's guidance and [[Harldain Ironbar]]'s help, the Veiled Ones replaced the ''gem'', the perfect [[sapphire]]. The elven priestess volunteered to become the new guardian of the ''mythal''. She merged with Mystra's greatest spell, the ''mythal'' of Myth Drannor, returning it to full power and purging the Cult's corruption.\n\nUnder Anorrweyn Evensong's watchful eye, the city of Myth Drannor was resettled in the 15{{th}} century DR and later, in the {{YearlinkName|1487}} faced another tragedy as the [[Netherese enclave]] [[Thultanthar]] crashed into the city's central business district. However, despite the calamity, the ''mythal'' still remained, along with Anorrweyn, and other beings tied to the ''mythal's'' magics.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211225175025/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1474798405704683520| title = TheEdVerse on Twitter| accessdate = 3-29-2022| date = 12-25-2021}}"
