        "mainbody": "'''Amglar''' was a [[Zhentilar]] commander operating in [[Battledale]] in the [[Dalelands]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Amglar led a [[Zhent]] garrison in [[Essembra]] together with the [[Zhentarim]] wizard [[Ondeler]]. Secretly, Amglar was under orders to report regularly to [[Draethe]], steward of the Inner Circle, on the wizard's performance.\n\nIn the small hours of [[Flamerule 16]], they were attacked by some mysterious [[undead]]. Amglar reported the news to Ondeler, who gathered his apprentice [[Myarvuk]] and [[Belurastra Stormfall]]. However, Belurastra revealed herself to be a [[malaugrym]] and made an agreement with Amglar while at same time killing Ondeler.\n\nOn [[Flamerule 17]], Amglar and Nentor led the Zhent army against the defenders of [[Mistledale]]. The Zhents were winning when [[Anastra Syluné Silverhand]] appeared behind Nentor and Amglar and killed the two Zhent commanders."
