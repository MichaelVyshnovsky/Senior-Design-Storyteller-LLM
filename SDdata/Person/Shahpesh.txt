'''Shahpesh''' was a [[human]] [[moralist]] and a member of the moralist order known as the [[Chosen of Fate]] around [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
To reflect her inner purity, Shahpesh dressed in flowing, white robes that covered both the top of her head and the lower portion of her face. She wore a golden amulet around her neck, and several bracelets on her right arm. Shahpesh had light skin and dark hair that reached just below her shoulders.

==Personality==
When Shahpesh burned her magical ''[[incense of obsession]]'', she became convinced that her spells were of superior purity and worth. Under the influence of the incense, she deluded herself into believing she could cast spells beyond her own ability. In reality, nothing happened when she tried to cast these too-powerful spells.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|463|Shahpesh's Incense of Obsession}}

==Possessions==
Aside from her ''incense of obsession'', Shahpesh owned a ''[[phylactery of faithfulness]]'', as well as a ''[[philter of persuasiveness]]''.

==Activites==
She traveled the breadth of [[Zakhara]] as a missionary for her order, hoping to convince people of the need to purify themselves.
