        "mainbody": "Tholone was a baron of Galadorna during the midâ€“8 century DR.\nHe wanted to be a mage.\nThe man was heavily scarred.\nThough he was considered a baron of King Baerimgrim, he styled himself Lord rather than baron, and openly flouted many royal decrees. He had under his service many magelings, many of them outlanders, and quickblades. He was no friend of fellow baron Maethor.\nDuring his last decade, starting around , Lord Tholone had willfully disregarded the royal decrees of King Baerimgrim. In the , King Baerimgrim rode to Tholones lands with a retinue of armed knights ready to demand his renewed oath of loyalty and back taxes. The king was attacked along the way by the green dragon Arlavaunta, leading to the wounds that left him bedridden for the last year of his life.\nDuring the royal moot called by King Baerimgrim in the subsequent , where hed name his successor, Lord Tholone spoke ill of Baron Hothals offer to make peace with the Lords of Laothkund, and claimed to be the baron best suited to kingship because of the company of magelings he had assembled, which was a guarantee his reign would not be as bloodthirsty as the other barons would be instead. His bid, to everyones surprise, was supported by his fellow Baron Maethor, on the condition that Baron Belundrar be made seneschal of the Realm. Fellow baron Feldrin also made a deal with the king, pledging his support for Tholones bid, conditional on the execution of Hothal, and the future elimination of Maethor. All so arranged, Tholone almost became king, but was slain by Court Mage Ilgrist, in truth the archmage Nadrathen, a Chosen of Mystra.\nNadrathen then had Tholones body animate and speak in support of the mages bid for the throne, which was inconsequential.\nIt was said that Arlavaunta attacked King Baerimgrim on Tholones orders. He was also said to be the worst choice for King of Galadorna and even the greatest threat to freedom and life for all Galadornans."
