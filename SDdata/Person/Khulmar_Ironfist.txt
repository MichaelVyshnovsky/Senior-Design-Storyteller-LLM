'''Khulmar Ironfist''' was a male [[dwarf]] and a member of [[Ironfist Clan]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Khulmar was a scout of the Ironfist Clan. He went with some dwarves to explore the [[Ironfist Stronghold]], but they were stopped by [[bugbear]]s.

===Gameplay===
[[Khelgar Ironfist]] and the [[Kalach-Cha]] could have encountered Khulmar, but he would refuse their help, as he viewed Khelgar as deserting to pursue his own ideas. Khelgar and the Kalach-Cha could have explored the Stronghold themselves and found the ''[[Gloves of Ironfist]]'', then returned to Khulmar to report their findings.
