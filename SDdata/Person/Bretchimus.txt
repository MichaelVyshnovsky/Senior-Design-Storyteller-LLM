Bretchimus was a guard at Castle Felmorel in the midâ€“8 century DR.
He was rather old for a guard.
Bretchimus wielded a pike that was in sorry shape.
He sometimes watched the front gate alone.
He served under Lord Esbre Felmorel. His brother was Habaertus Ilynker.
On a spring night of the , Wanlorn was present at a feast at Castle Felmorel. When he snuck out, the one guard that watched the gate was Bretchimus. He completely missed not only Wanlorn, but Thessamel Arunder, and luckily for him, even the Slayer.
