'''Spectorial''' was a mage and a friend of the warrior hero [[Rigar Trueblood]].

As he lay on his deathbed, Rigar Trueblood begged Spectorial to preserve his skill and fortitude in battle. Although reluctant, Spectorial acceded and extracted these qualities from Rigar's soul, placing them into the ''[[pale green ioun stone]]'' so that others might benefit from them.
