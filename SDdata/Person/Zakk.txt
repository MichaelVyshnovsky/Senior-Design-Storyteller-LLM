'''Zakk''' was a ploughman, displaced by [[The Absolute]], and as a refugee, sought shelter in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Asparagus was a [[human]] man with brown eyes, blonde hair, and blonde scruff.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, an army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Farmer Zakk and his husband fled to the nearby city of Baldur's Gate with a few of their surviving [[cow]]s. Sadly, if the spouses were to be given access to the city within the walls, the cows would be confiscated by the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries upon entry to be slaughtered due to ration shortage in the city. Zakk was granted entrance to the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate, while his husband the cattle stayed in [[Rivington]]. Zakk lamented the prospect of loosing their cows â€“ their only livelihood and joined the protesting farmers by the Basilisk Gate.
