As of the , Serpentguard Dshai and several other serpentine abominations were left to guard a long-abandoned temple that once belonged to House Sauringar until they abandoned the worship of Sseth in favor of the interloper deity Zehir. The temple stood in the heart of the Samarlogh and hid the divinely enchanted Sauringar Tome. In 1374 DR, an infamous writer and explorer named Volothamp Geddarm sought lore to pen Volos Guide to the Serpent Kingdoms, a book dedicated to Samarach. He asked a band of adventurers to infiltrate Dshais temple to retrieve yuan-ti artifacts from its inner sanctum.
