        "mainbody": "Cultist\nSavra Belabranta () was a member of the Cult of the Howling Hatred during the Elemental Evil crisis of 1491 DR, but later became a member of the Order of the Gauntlet in Waterdeep.\nWhile a member of the Cult, Savra was totally brainwashed by it and fully believed everything.\nSavra was a member of the Belabrantas, a noble Waterdhavian family whose main activity was raising griffons to serve as mounts for the Griffon Cavalry.\nSavra hailed from Waterdeep, where she joined the Feathergale Knights, a cover group for the Cult of the Howling Hatred. There, she was indoctrinated into the worship of Yan-C-Bin. In 1491 DR, Savra showed some adventurers the Feathergale Spire.\nSome time later, Savra repented from her cultist days and became a member of the Order of the Gauntlet. Fully reformed, she began to serve Tyr in an attempt to atone for the evil acts she committed and to regain her honor. She returned to Waterdeep and worked for the Order at the Halls of Justice, assigning missions and swearing new members into the Order."
