'''Pyras Autorian''' was the [[tharchion]] of [[Thaymount]] of [[Thay]].
{{quote|He is doing very well under my ministrations. I believe that when I am done, no one will ever notice a difference.|Szass Tam, on "healing" Pyras Autorian}}

==Description==
In [[1373 DR]], Pyras was in his early 30s. Pyras had hazel eyes, and his most noticeable feature was a full head of bright red hair. It always stood up in the sea of shaven-headed Thayans. Pyras's hair was strangely resistant to any attempts of removing it, be it in mundane ways or via magic.

==Personality==
Pyras Autorian thought himself to be fair-minded, but most Red Wizards that knew him called him weak-willed. Pyras often hid his failures and weaknesses.

==Relationships==
Pyras had little magical talent, to the constant embarrassment of his father. To please the senior Autorian, Pyras entered the world of politics.

==Activities==
Pyras had no real talent and was an open puppet of [[Szass Tam]]. In turn, Szass kept Pyras safe with bodyguards, [[magical item]]s, and [[spell]]s.

==History==
Pyras was tharchion of Thaymount by [[1372 DR]].

In the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, Pyras Autorian was possessed by [[Eltab]] in the plot of [[Naglatha]] against Tam but was likely killed by [[Thazienne Uskevren]] when she defeated Eltab.

Although soon healed or resurrected by some means,
