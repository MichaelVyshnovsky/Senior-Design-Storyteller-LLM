When the [[black dragon]] [[Throstulgrael]], recently settled in [[Twilight Marsh]] near [[Phlan]], started preying upon caravans, Reema and her men were ordered to find and defeat the dragon.\n\nLater, fellow Gauntlet agent [[Zern Xerkstil]] asked an adventuring party sent to recover some items from the dragon's lair to discovered what happened to the former party. The adventurers discovered that Reema and her fellows had been killed by [[kobold]] minions of the dragon."
