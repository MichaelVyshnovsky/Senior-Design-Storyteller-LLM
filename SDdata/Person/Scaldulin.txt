'''Scaldulin''' was a famous hero from the world of [[Oerth]] and the owner of a powerful [[enchanted]] [[longsword]], the ''[[Hoarfrost Blade]]''.

==History==
Sages of [[Toril]] knew about some of the hero Scaldulin's feats and heroics on a distant world of Greyhawk. The hero discovered the ''Hoarfrost Blade'' plugged into the heart of a glacier. He wielded the enchanted blade through several major conquests of his career. He used the blade's magics that punished extraplanar creatures to stand against a [[demon]] army in the [[Battle of the Thousand Dead]], at some point later, the hero sliced the hand of a dreaded [[lich]] [[Scaroth]] the Warped of [[Blackmoor]].

Scaldulin's heroics ended with him being transformed into a [[death knight]] and slaughter of a [[solar]] named [[Arazium]]. His final fate remained unknown to scholars of Toril, but the ''Hoarfrost Blade'' found its way to [[Faer√ªn]] in [[1372 DR]], broken and scattered across [[Delimbiyr Vale]].
