Zezania Tarth-Kelet was a Chultan human woman from Tashalar. She was a priestess of Shar and a member of Demarchs Folly, an organization dedicated to learning shadow magic.
Zezania was a wizard and cleric of Shar who studied divine magic, arcane magic, and shadow magic, and was able to use the Shadow Weave. She combined these diverse paths of study as a mystic theurge, and also developed as a child of night.
Interested in shadow magic and curious about the Shadow Weave, members of Demarchs Folly sought out someone who could use both. They discovered Zezania. She agreed to join their organization and provided guidance in their efforts.
