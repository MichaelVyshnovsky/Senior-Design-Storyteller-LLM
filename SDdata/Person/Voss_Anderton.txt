Voss Anderton was a member of the Absolution Council, the ruling body of the Revels End prison and the group that oversaw the fates of the prisons inmates on behalf of the Lords Alliance. He dutifully represented his home city of Neverwinter during the late 15 century DR.
Councilor Anderton was a stern, no-nonsense individual. He took his job seriously and was always punctual to all his scheduled meetings.
He always spoke in a precise manner as befitting an officer of a legal court.
When presented with a sentencing or parole hearing, Councilor Anderton carefully considered the consequences that might arise from the vote he made. He was ever practical and did not practice compassion when carrying out his duties as councilor.

In the late 1490s DR, the Absolution Council—Voss Anderton, Jil Torbo, Kriv Norixius, and a delayed Jarnathan—met in Revels End to consider a pardon for Edgin Darvis and Holga Kilgore for the crimes of skulduggery and grand larceny. Anderton opened the meeting and listened quietly through Edgins statement, despite his many breaks and stalling. Ultimately, though, the Council approved their pardon, the pair escaped by fighting off the guards, grabbing Jarnathan, and jumping through the window before they could announce it.
More than a year later, the same council met to consider Forge Fitzwilliam for pardon, but were wise to the same tricks and refused him.
