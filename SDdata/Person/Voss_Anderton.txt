'''Voss Anderton''' was a member of the [[Absolution Council]], the ruling body of the [[Revel's End]] prison and the group that oversaw the fates of the prison's inmates on behalf of the [[Lords' Alliance]]. He dutifully represented his home city of [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|By the authority of the Lords' Alliance, this Absolution Council will now come to order in the case of Edgin Darvis and Holga Kilgore.|Anderton opening the council}}

==Personality==
Councilor Anderton was a stern, no-nonsense individual. He took his job seriously and was always punctual to all his scheduled meetings.

==Description==
He always spoke in a precise manner as befitting an officer of a legal court.

==Activities==
When presented with a sentencing or parole hearing, Councilor Anderton carefully considered the consequences that might arise from the vote he made. He was ever practical and did not practice compassion when carrying out his duties as councilor.

==History==
[[File:Voss Anderton.png|thumb|''Stone-faced Voss Anderton.'']]
In the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} the Absolution Council—Voss Anderton, [[Jil Torbo]], [[Kriv Norixius]], and a delayed [[Jarnathan]]—met in Revel's End to consider a pardon for [[Edgin Darvis]] and [[Holga Kilgore]] for the crimes of skulduggery and grand larceny. Anderton opened the meeting and listened quietly through Edgin's statement, despite his many breaks and stalling.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} Ultimately, though, the Council approved their pardon, the pair escaped by fighting off the guards, grabbing Jarnathan, and jumping through the window before they could announce it.

More than a year later, the same council met to consider [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] for pardon, but were wise to the same tricks and refused him.
