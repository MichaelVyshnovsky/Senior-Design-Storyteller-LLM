        "mainbody": "Frestin Cohlver was a young minor aristocrat from Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.\nHe was pompous and loved to drink. He dressed in fine clothes.\nFollowing the publication of Volos Guide to Monsters, Frestin was one of many hapless thrill-seekers who were intrigued and charmed by the authors description of the town of Phandalin. He made his way to the town and attempted to eat and drink at the quaint establishments detailed by Volo, and proceeded to get very drunk. In his stupor, he was robbed of both his purse and his mount, and somehow lost an ear. When he was discovered in the morning, he was face-down in a bed of sunflowers with little memory of the night before."
