'''Yrjixtilex Kallan''' was a [[dragonborn]] mercenary and the interim [[Vanquisher]] of [[Tymanther]] in [[1487 DR]].

==Description==
Kallan was a handsome dragonborn, even by [[human]] standards, with dark-gray scales and silver eyes. Before he was elected Vanquisher, he didn't have any clan piercings.

==Relationships==
Kallan was clan-kin of [[Ophinshtalajiir Perra]].

==History==
Kallan was raised in the homesteads of Tymanther. Since culture was less demanding in the homesteads than in [[Djerad Thymar]], Kallan was never asked to use clan piercings or to marry by his clan elders.

In [[1486 DR]], Kallan was working as a mercenary in [[Cormyr]]. Kallan's mercenary group was hired to protect [[Aubrin Crownsilver]] during the siege of [[Suzail]]. During this time, Kallan and Clanless [[Mehen]] became close, but Mehen's insecurities didn't allow their relationship to blossom.

After the hostilities, Kallan and a fellow [[wizard]] were hired by the [[Ilstan Nyaril]], [[Chosen]] of [[Azuth]], to accompany him to Djerad Thymar. Kallan didn't know Ilstan's reasons to be in Djerad Thymar were to kill [[Farideh]], foster daughter of Mehen. Due to Ilstan's actions, however, Kallan was imprisoned by the [[Adjudicators]] and had to be freed by [[Yrjixtilex Vardhira]], matriarch of Clan Yrjixtilex. After he was freed, he helped Mehen and his daughters hunt the [[maurezhi]] that was killing dragonborn in Djerad Thymar. During this time, Kallan and Mehen finally formalized their relationship.

After Vanquisher [[Tarhun]] was killed by the maurezhi, and seeing the threat posed by the [[Unther]]ite forces that advanced against Djerad Thymar, [[Verthisathurgiesh Anala]] proposed Kallan as a candidate for interim Vanquisher. Although he was not popular among the elders of the clans at first, and even Kallan was reluctant to take the position, on [[Hammer 6]] of [[1487 DR]] he was made interim Vanquisher in order to assemble all of Tymanther's military forces and send an unified front against Unther during the [[First Tymanther-Unther War]]. After the war ended, Kallan allowed [[Namshita]] and her rebel forces to form their own [[Namshita's clan|clan]], giving them full rights in Thymari society, as a reward for their help during the war.

Kallan publicly supported [[Dumuzi]]'s efforts to proselytize the faith of [[Enlil]]. Mehen and Kallan also officially started their relationship after the war ended.
