        "mainbody": "'''Mauletar''' was a guardsman from the nation of [[Thay]] who became the namesake of the ''[[battle axe of Mauletar]]'' in the 11{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1074}}, the [[Red Wizard]] nation of Thay became consumed by a short but bloody civil war when the people of the nation rose against the [[Zulkir]]s. During the war, Mauletar escorted members of the House [[Ormynd]] out of the war-torn nation. He had befriended the family and wanted them to reach safety. As they fled, it became apparent that the family was betrayed. Mauletar picked up Ormynd's [[enchanted]] [[axe]] and stood against the family's enemies, allowing them to flee to safety. Mauletar's battle cry shook the land before being snuffed out. His death was not forgotten. The axe he wielded became known as the ''battle axe of Mauletar,'' and his name became the symbol of loyalty and devoted friendship."
