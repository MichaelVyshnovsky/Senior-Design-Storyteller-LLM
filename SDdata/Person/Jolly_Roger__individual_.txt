Though he was a quite strict man, Jolly loved adventure{{Cite organized play/LC/Strongwind|6}}{{Cite polyhedron/130/Strongwind|31}} often swapping them with whoever he conversed with.

==Possessions==
Jolly wielded a [[scimitar]] as his weapon of choice.

==History==
Sometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, a group of [[adventurer]]s in [[Ravens Bluff]] were tasked by Harbormaster [[Calvin Longbottle]] with tracking down a ship that had been terrorizing the Sea of Fallen Stars in the prior few weeks, rumored to be the [[ghost ship]] ''[[Strongwind (ship)|Strongwind]]''. Unable to lend them a ship due to the crisis,{{Cite organized play/LC/Strongwind|2-3}} and with the city's [[Merchants Guild (Ravens Bluff)|Merchants Guild]] being unwilling to lend Calvin one, the group was forced to go find a ship they could book passage on. One of three possible ships they came across was the ''Lolli'', however, Captain Roger informed them that his ship was booked and if they wished to buy out the ship for 200 [[gold piece]]s they would need to speak with his boss, [[Steven Goldstein]].
