        "mainbody": "Brida was a crew member of the ''[[Green Siren]]'' under the command of [[Thoster]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Brida had dark hair and a terrible scar.",
        "History": "Brida was next to [[Dorlan Nyrotha]] as he attempted to pry open the chest where [[Anusha Marhana]] hid aboard the ''Green Siren'' as a stowaway in {{yearlink|1396}}. Anusha was using her dreamform to explore the ship unseen; when she brought her dreamform to try and stop him, Brida caught a glimpse of the ordinarily invisible form on a mirror. As Dorlan was rendered unconscious by the dreamform's power, she took the reflection for a [[ghost]], and called for help."
