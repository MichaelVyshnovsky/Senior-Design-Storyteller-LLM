        "mainbody": "Brida was a crew member of the Green Siren under the command of Thoster during the late 14 century DR.\nBrida had dark hair and a terrible scar.\nBrida was next to Dorlan Nyrotha as he attempted to pry open the chest where Anusha Marhana hid aboard the Green Siren as a stowaway in . Anusha was using her dreamform to explore the ship unseen when she brought her dreamform to try and stop him, Brida caught a glimpse of the ordinarily invisible form on a mirror. As Dorlan was rendered unconscious by the dreamforms power, she took the reflection for a ghost, and called for help."
