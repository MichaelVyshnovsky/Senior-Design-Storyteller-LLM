'''Argus''' was a powerful [[fighter]] from [[Deepingdale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who died while on an expedition in the [[Shining Sea]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|20-21}}

==History==
Argus worked in Deepingdale as an inexperienced lumberman until meeting the charismatic [[Waukeenar]] known as [[Devlin (Ravens Bluff)|Devlin]], who recruited him into his company of{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2,4}} Devlin made him the captain of one of the group's ships, the ''[[Erine's Smile]]''.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2}}

On [[Marpenoth 5]], Argus and a [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] by the name of [[Wedonai]] were patrolling the island when they came across the horrifically mutilated corpse of a [[stegosaurus]]. Wedonai would go on to express concerns about angered [[spirit|forest spirit]]s, whilst Angus would tell Devlin that the creature's wounds were suggestive of an attack from another [[dinosaur]]. On [[Marpenoth 11]], five [[velociraptor]]s attacked the expedition site's messhall and both men aided in fending them off, though Argus would die in the process.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|7}} The expedition's leader Devlin would go on to lament the loss of Argus within the pages of his diary.
