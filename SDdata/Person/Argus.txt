Argus was a powerful fighter from Deepingdale in the late 14 century DR who died while on an expedition in the Shining Sea.
Argus worked in Deepingdale as an inexperienced lumberman until meeting the charismatic Waukeenar known as Devlin, who recruited him into his company of Devlin made him the captain of one of the groups ships, the Erines Smile.
On Marpenoth 5, Argus and a Chultan by the name of Wedonai were patrolling the island when they came across the horrifically mutilated corpse of a stegosaurus. Wedonai would go on to express concerns about angered forest spirits, whilst Angus would tell Devlin that the creatures wounds were suggestive of an attack from another dinosaur. On Marpenoth 11, five velociraptors attacked the expedition sites messhall and both men aided in fending them off, though Argus would die in the process. The expeditions leader Devlin would go on to lament the loss of Argus within the pages of his diary.
