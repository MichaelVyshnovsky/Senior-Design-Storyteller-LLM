        "mainbody": "'''Shandril Shessair''' was an [[adventurer]] from [[Deepingdale]] and a wielder of [[spellfire]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "[[File:Shandril spellfire.png|thumb|''Shandril's spellfire power.''|389x389px]]\nIn the long term, Shandril simply wanted to live a quiet life with her family and friends. She desired no conquests, no deaths, and no more power than the spellfire she already wielded.",
        "History": "Shandril was the daughter of [[Garthond Shessair]], a wizard who had often fought the [[Cult of the Dragon]], and the [[incantatrix]] [[Dammasae]], an adventurer whom Garthond had rescued from the cult. Dammasae had the ability to use spellfire and passed on that power to her daughter. The family lived quietly in [[Elturel]] only until Shandril was old enough to withstand the rigors of travel, for the cult—which already knew of Dammasae's ability—wanted the child as well as the mother.\n\nWhen Shandril was eight months old, the family fled with [[Gorstag]], a [[battleaxe]]-wielding warrior and friend of the family. The four moved to the east in disguise. But at the [[Bridge of Fallen Men]] near [[Cormyr]], the cult ambushed them. Garthond gave his life for the freedom of his wife and daughter. Before he died, Shandril's father destroyed nine cult mages and three swordsmen. Gorstag and Dammasae were both wounded, but they fled with Shandril toward [[Shadowdale]].\n\nSadly, Shandril's mother did not live to reach their destination. After Dammasae died, Gorstag turned south toward [[Deepingdale]], hoping to leave the infant Shandril with the [[elves]] there. He then planned to retrieve Garthond's writings and the [[magical item]]s that were Shandril's inheritance. The elves brought word to him, however that the cult had broken into Garthond's tower and prepared its basements to become the lair of one of their [[dracoliches]], [[Rauglothgor]].\n\nCounting on the fact that he was not well known to the cult and thus he would be able to keep Shandril's location a secret from them, Gorstag stayed on in Deepingdale, raising her as a servant girl. When she was old enough, she helped him run the inn he had purchased, [[The Rising Moon (inn)|The Rising Moon]].<ref>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, at the age of 16, bored by her dull hardworking life and eager to see the world, Shandril ran off to become an adventuring thief. She joined the [[Company of the Bright Spear]] as a thief, but that group was soon decimated in a battle by a large party of cult members. Shandril was captured and imprisoned inside an old tomb.\n\nShe managed to escape using a magical device that was hidden in the crypt. Unfortunately, the magic teleported her into the fiend-infested city of [[Myth Drannor]], where she was again captured by the cult. [[Symgharyl Maruel]], the Shadowsil, the cult's [[archmage]], intended to make \"good\" use of Shandril's blood, initially mistaking her for the missing Cormyrean princess, [[Alusair Obarskyr|Alusair]].\n\nAn apprentice mage by the name of [[Narm Tamaraith|Narm]] witnessed Shandril's abduction and enlisted the aid of the fabled [[Knights of Myth Drannor]]. With the help of the Knights and [[Elminster]], Narm was able to rescue Shandril just before she would have been consumed by the dracolich Rauglothgor.\n\nDuring this conflict, a strange creature capable of absorbing magical energy known as a [[balhiir]] was accidentally released from a crystal sphere where it had been contained. The presence of the creature foiled all magical attacks belonging to the Knights, cult members, and the dracolich itself. It was mentioned in lore that only the person who released a balhiir could destroy it. Henceforth, Elminster asked Shandril to absorb the energy of the balhiir itself and release it at her will. Filled to bursting with magical power, Shandril released the force in the form of bolts of lightning that blew apart Rauglothgor, the cult members, and much of the surrounding terrain. Elminster began to have suspicions regarding the amount of spellfire Shandril had used in the battle being much more than what the balhiir had absorbed.\n\n[[File:Dracolich - Clyde Caldwell.jpg|thumb|''[[Rauglothgor]] vs Shandril.''|413x413px]]After more major battles, Elminster and the Knights brought Shandril and Narm to [[Shadowdale]], where his suspicions regarding Shandril having a latent ability of spellfire were confirmed. He eventually tested Shandril's spellfire ability and helped her refine it. Shandril and Narm were soon married, in between attacks by the cult, and the couple then received an invitation to visit [[Silverymoon]] from [[Alustriel Silverhand|Lady Alustriel]], ruler of that city. Alustriel promised protection from those who sought Shandril's power, as well as further instruction in the use of ''spellfire''. After joining the [[Harpers]], Shandril and Narm prepared for a long journey.\n\nThe pair's first stop was Deepingdale, where Shandril was reunited with Gorstag. They were betrayed, however, by a cult member—[[Korvan]], the cook at the inn—and had to flee again. A third dracolich, [[Shargrailar]], came to destroy Shandril and Narm, but Shandril managed to absorb its magical breath weapon, destroy the undead beast, and heal Narm's injuries. A [[dwarf]] named [[Delg Hammerhand]], another survivor of the Company of the Bright Spear, caught up to the pair and joined them on their journey to Silverymoon.\n\nAs the trio continued their travels, Shandril learned that she and Narm were going to be parents. It was then that the [[Zhentarim]] began to move against them. In one Zhent attack, the evil men had dug a pit in the trail to catch the heroes as they fled. Only Delg got trapped in the pit, and the threat was easily dispatched by Shandril. After blasting his cohorts to bits with her spellfire, she \"persuaded\" the sole-surviving Zhent to help get Delg out of the trap. It was not long thereafter that the trio became a quartet when [[Mirt|Mirt the Moneylender]] assisted them with the Zhentarim's relentless attacks.\n\n[[File:Jon-sullivan-crownfire.jpg|thumb|''Shandril and the [[Company of the Bright Spear]].''|423x423px]]As their journey carried them into the [[Stonelands]] of Cormyr, the band of heroes was attacked by Zhentarim mages and a force of [[gargoyle]]s. Delg was taken aloft by one of the stony flying beasts, and as he rained axe blows upon the creature's body they both plummeted from the sky. The dwarf was impaled on a shard of rock and could not be saved. Shandril comforted him as he died, and then set about destroying his killers.\n\nThe death of Delg was what convinced Shandril that she had to take a stand against her pursuers. She cremated her friend's body with spellfire, and then instructed Mirt to guide her to [[Zhentil Keep]] so she could take the fight to her enemies at their source. He agreed to do so, but instead of heading directly there by a long overland route, Mirt took Shandril to [[Eveningstar]] and introduced her to its ruler, Lord [[Tessaril Winter]]. After the Lord of Eveningstar came to respect Shandril's need to confront her pursuers, she consented to use a ''[[teleport]]'' spell to get Shandril to her destination much more quickly.\n\nShandril found herself transported to [[Spell Court]] in the [[Citadel of the Raven]], a fortress that the Zhents took over by trickery years earlier, and surrounded by a ring of [[beholder]]s. She was able to dispose of all the eye tyrants by using spellfire, but then collapsed from fatigue. Mirt, who had followed her magically through the use of a ''[[roguestone]]'', grabbed her unconscious form and managed to keep her out of the clutches of Zhent soldiers who were closing in on the two of them.\n\nHe got her to a safe place—a house of pleasure that was being run by an undercover Harper—and soon thereafter the two returned by magic to Eveningstar, where they were reunited with Narm, Tessaril, and their other friends. The heroes resolved to return to Zhentil Keep and finish what Shandril and Mirt had begun.\n\nIn the climactic battle, the heroes faced the evil priest [[Fzoul Chembryl]] and his minions. Another Harper undercover agent, [[Sarhthor]] the wizard, took Fzoul's [[javelin]] through the chest—a javelin intended for Shandril. As he died, he implored Shandril to touch his head, absorb his life energy, and create a [[crown of fire]], which was the most powerful form of spellfire known. Shandril did as he instructed, and with the awesome power that then came under her control she blew away the Wizards' Watch Tower of Zhentil Keep, down to its foundations.\n\nWith at least that enemy out of the way, Narm and Shandril were free to resume their long-postponed journey to Silverymoon, after spending some time resting and recuperating in seclusion. After the triumph at Zhentil Keep, Elminster informed her that their child would be a girl and that, like Shandril herself, she would inherit the power of spellfire from her mother.\n\n[[File:Jon-sullivan-spell-fire.jpg|thumb|''Shandril vs the [[Zhentarim]].''|250x250px]]\nShe began her travels to Silverymoon with the aid of a caravan master, [[Ortho Voldovan]], and his guards, two of whom were Harper agents. Unknown to all of them, the rest of the caravan was filled with Zhentarim, Thayan, and Cult agents. As the caravan was whittled down during the journey, [[Sharantyr]] of Shadowdale was dispatched to find and aid Shandril. After a long journey, she caught up, only to discover her old friend Voldovan was not himself, but a Red Wizard of Thay who had slain and taken his place before the journey ever started. Shandril lost control upon discovering all of her enemies, and began a maelstrom of fire. As she slaughtered everyone within reach, Alustriel of Silverymoon, [[Laeral]] of [[Waterdeep]], Mirt, and [[Asper]], his companion, all teleported to Shandril to try and stop her. Shandril, however, blasted them back as the Chosen of Mystra and Waterdhavians tried to reach her. Narm was stabbed brutally during the fight, and Shandril, seeing this, blasted him with spellfire, trying to heal him. When Narm collapsed, Shandril was overcome with grief, believing that she'd killed him. Asper pleaded with Shandril to stop, but Shandril waved farewell to her friends and fed herself spellfire. The resulting explosion blinded Asper for days to come. Shandril's spirit was gathered by [[Mystra]], who gave her the power to appear whenever spellfire or [[silver fire]] was used. Narm survived and Shandril told him not to grieve, and to find another woman, as life was long."
