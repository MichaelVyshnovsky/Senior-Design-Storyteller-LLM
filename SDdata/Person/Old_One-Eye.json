        "mainbody": "'''Old One-Eye''' was a huge fearsome [[worg]] who hunted cattle at the [[Wild Pastures]] of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''I have sen big Ol' One-Eye, and he's nastier than a big ol' hog who ate too much sour [[cheese]].''|[[Lavna]] the Shepherd}}",
        "Description": "As per his nickname, Old One-Eye was a black-furred worg with one eye. The creature was smarter, fiercer, and much bigger than an average worg, twice the size by some accords.",
        "History": "By 1372 DR, Old One-Eye was considered almost a mythical creature, treated as a scary tale, a ting that goes bump in the night. Even though many believed the worg to be just a story, the giant wolf hunted and fed on stray cattle of the lush but extremely dangerous Wild Pastures to the west from the hamlet of [[Liam's Hold]]. Lavna the Shepherd was among very few who witnessed the creature and lived to tell the tale. When the cattle started disappearing from the Wild Pastures in 1372 DR, Lavna was convinced it was the work of the One-Eyed Worg, something no-one believed. Even though Lavna was wrong and the cattle was abducted by [[orc]]s to feed devil [[Gorgomorz]]'s [[tanarukk]]a army, she offered adventurers a humble reward for killing the dreaded beast - her ''[[shepherd's charm]]''."
