Khalif Mubrek was the owner of several follies in the city of Phoenix. An apparition of him could still manifest in his home.
Khalif Mubreks home contained a number of follies, most of them harmless a too-small door would chuck chocolate cream pies at people entering his home, a trick seat would likely startle anyone who sat on it, and a number of water-related practical joke devices on his kitchen. His spirit manifested on his home as well, as a small, wealthily-dressed, pudgy man offering a toast and a feast to travelers with dribble cups. Food would disappear for those who did not laugh, while those who did laugh were rewarded with a piece of jewelry as a memento after the meal.
However, there was a mirror of opposition on his home, which was likely to prove deadly.
Theres no indication as to where the chocolate cream pies came from.
