'''Khalif Mubrek''' was the owner of several follies in the city of [[Phoenix (city)|Phoenix]]. An apparition of him could still manifest in his home.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|89}}{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|90}}

==Overview==
Khalif Mubrek's home contained a number of follies, most of them harmless: a too-small door would chuck chocolate cream pies at people entering his home, a trick seat would likely startle anyone who sat on it, and a number of water-related practical joke devices on his kitchen. His spirit manifested on his home as well, as a small, wealthily-dressed, pudgy man offering a toast and a feast to travelers with dribble cups. Food would disappear for those who did not laugh, while those who did laugh were rewarded with a piece of jewelry as a memento after the meal.

However, there was a ''[[mirror of opposition]]'' on his home, which was likely to prove deadly.

==Trivia==
There's no indication as to where the chocolate cream pies came from.
