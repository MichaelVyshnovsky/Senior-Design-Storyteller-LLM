        "History": "Once Preeta was a wizard assistant of [[Arcturia]], who nevertheless performed horrible experiments upon her. So she escaped and settled inside the hobgoblin settlement in the Sargauth Level; the fearful hobgoblins left her alone.\n\nIn [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} however, the menace of the drow of [[House Auvryndar]] forced Azrok to ask Preeta for help and she agreed.",
        "Powers": "Preeta had a mouth twice as large as normal size full of sharp teeth, and two [[beholder]] eyestalks sprouting from her eye sockets. The eyestalks emitted a fear ray and a paralyzing ray.",
