'''Drizhal''' was a young soldier and lieutenant in the allied army of the [[Dalelands]] that lived and died during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a slender man with gangly limbs and long, vivid blonde hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, while less than 20 years old, Drizhal fought alongside his countrymen to defend their home from the [[Zhentilar]] in the [[second battle of Shadowdale]]. For a time during the battle, he served under the authoritative [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]],

Facing insurmountable odds and unable to execute a tactical retreat, Drizhal stood firm against the Zhent soldiers but was ultimately killed soon after the fighting broke out.
