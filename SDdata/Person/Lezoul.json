        "mainbody": "Lezoul, or Lezoul of the Great Oaks was famed guide of the High Forest in the mid–14 century DR.\nLezoul was a guide who protected groups on pilgrimages through the Unicorn Run. He guarded these pilgrims so that they could pay homage to Mielikki. The sorceress, Cortarra, was said to obsess over his work.\nIn 1358 DR, after the Battle of Ascore, several retreating Zhentarim and monsters made their way through the High Forest. Lezouls daughter, Siulajia, was kidnapped and taken as a \"gift\" to Lord Geildarr Ithym."
