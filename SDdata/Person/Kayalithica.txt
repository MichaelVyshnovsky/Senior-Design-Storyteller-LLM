Thane '''Kayalithica''' was the ruler of the [[stone giant]]s in the late 15th century [[DR]].

==History==
Kayalithica was one of the [[giant]] lords at the time of the shattering of the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]].

After [[1485 DR]], after the disappearance of [[storm giant]] king [[Hekaton]], all giant lords started their path to reshaping the ordning. Kayalithica's plan was to seek divine illumination from the giant god [[Skoraeus Stonebones]] and destroying all the small folks' settlements built upon the ruins of ancient [[Ostoria]].

In order to accomplish her project, Kayalithica allied with the similarly minded [[Uthgardt]] [[Blue Bear Tribe]] and her minions destroyed the nearby [[Orlbar]] and [[Llorkh]].

==Activities==
Usually, Kayalithica was at the temple of Skoraeus Stonebones, meditating in front of the [[Steinfang]] stalactite, which she believed whispered the will of Skoraeus. In truth, she was deceived and the Steinfang housed a fragment of the earth [[primordial]]Â [[Draunn]], who wanted only to create havoc.
