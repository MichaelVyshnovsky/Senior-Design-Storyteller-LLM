'''Chase''' was a rich and overly-dramatic young noble who lived somewhere along the [[Sword Coast]] ''circa'' [[1368 DR]].

==History==
In 1368 DR, Chase found a high cliff along the [[Way of the Lion]] coastline, not far from the road to [[Candlekeep]], and threatened passersby with jumping off it in a dramatic way. He loudly declared his intentions and told folk not to come any closer. His actions' however, were ruled by attention-seeking rather than any dire emotional issues. He claimed that no one cared about his needs, not  "Mumsey," not "Daddums," nor even "Jeeves." When faced with passersby, who did not care for his theatrics, he announced that he would stay alive despite his selfish parents. Of course, Chase has done this display several times, and each time he was talked out of his intentions (rather easily) by passersby. He thought to ask his "Daddums" to build a cliff for these dramatic excursions in the future closer to home as the walk to the Way of the Lion was quite exhausting.
