'''Duvon Tr'arach''', later known as '''Avinvesa Fey''', was a [[drow]] weapon master in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relations==
Duvon hailed from [[House Tr'arach]], a small house.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1018}}, Duvon, together with Matron Mother [[Hauzz Tr'arach]] and his sister [[Daungelina Tr'arach]], planned an attack on [[House Simfray]]. The first priestess reassured Hauzz about the [[wizard]]s they had hired from [[House Xorlarrin]] and Duvon about the presumably very talented Simfray weapon master [[Zaknafein]].

During the attack, Daungelina and Duvon confronted Zaknafein but the enemy weapon master easily defeated Duvon and later, with a few quick actions, also killed Daungelina. Duvon was on the verge of being killed by his [[riding lizard|giant lizard]] mount when [[Jarlaxle]] saved and sedated him.

Afterward, with Duvon's blessing, Jarlaxle sold him to [[House Fey-Branche]] to be their new weapon master until one of the children of Matron [[Byrtyn Fey]] proved adept at the job. He remained in that position until [[1118 DR]].

However, Duvon was still resentful of Zaknafein and Matron Byrtyn and, that year, her daughter [[Affyn Fey]] started to plot Zak's death using Duvon. A few days later, Duvon tried to kill Zaknafein inside the [[Oozing Myconid]], with the support of [[Harbondair Tr'arach]], but was stopped by Jarlaxle, who proposed to set up a regular duel soon.

On the day of the duel, which had attracted many noble gamblers, Duvon had his great fight with Zak. However, thanks to a little support from Jarlaxle, Zaknafein ultimately gained supremacy and Duvon surrendered. After the defeat, Jarlaxle traded with Matron Byrtyn to have Duvon dismissed by House Fey-Branche and, following a sojourn in [[Ched Nasad]] in the {{yearlinkName|1119}}, he formally joined [[Bregan D'aerthe]].
