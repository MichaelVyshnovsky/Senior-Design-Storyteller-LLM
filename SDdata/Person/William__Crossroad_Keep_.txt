==Description==
William has a handsome [[human]] man with fair complexion, brown hair. He wore his facial hair in a well-groomed manner. William's warm eyes betrayed a slight hint of hardness behind them.

==History==
In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, William and his [[tambourine]], was a part of a [[rogue|roguish]] band of traveling performers that included Lila, a [[flute|flautist]], [[venn]] a sting musician, and the troupe's leader, a flaming dancer named [[Azahr]]. William and the band spent some time performing at the [[Crossroad Keep]] as it was being reinvigorated by trade and commerce after a devastating [[Shadow War]]. The band's leader was happy to be making [[coin]] once again and planned on staying at the keep for a little while. However, that time was cut short after Azahr sole a precious artifact â€“ ''[[Gauntlets of Ironfist]],'' from the keep's seneschal. William accompanied his bandmates to Azahr's cabin hideout in the [[Neverwinter Wood]]. [[Khelgar Ironfist]] sent a group of adventurers to retrieve the precious stolen magic item; a brawl was ensured.
