        "mainbody": "ragomir the Red was a power-hungry vampire warlord who commanded armies both in life and during undeath.\nHe was known to command both admiration and fright from his followers.\nAfter Dragomir was turned, he commissioned the necromancer Zulann Flass to craft him a magical cloak that allowed him to travel outside during the daylight hours.\nHe kept his coffin within a unique bag of holding that he entrusted to his most loyal of knights. Whenever he was slain in battle he merely turned into a gaseous form and need to travel to his resting place to regenerate. By keeping it nearby in the possession of an ally, that distance was greatly reduced.\nDragomir nearly always fought in the front lines of the military campaigns he led.\nWhile Dragomirs followers were loyal to him for quite some time, they began to see that his voracious desire for power would lead to their doom. Some of his most-trusted devotees commission the creation of the Casque of Imprisonment, a crown of sorts that would stun and immobilize the wearer. They interred Dragomir within a crypt beneath the graveyard of Athkatla, where he remained for years to follow.\nSome time during the 12 century DR, a thief by the name of Hexxat was tasked with recovering the casque for their patron. When she removed it from his head, Dragomir awoke and turned Hexxat into a vampire her self. He then imprisoned her within a nearby stone coffin where she stayed for over two hundred years.\nIn the , the Hero of Baldurs Gate assisted a woman named Clara with the task of entering into Dragomirs tomb. The pair were both manipulated into slaying Dragomir for good, and freeing Hexxat from her imprisonment."
