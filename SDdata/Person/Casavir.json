        "mainbody": "'''Casavir''', also known as '''''Katalmach''''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] who participated in the [[Shadow War]] as a companion to the [[Kalach-Cha]].\n{{Quote|''I do not have faith in a city or a nation, but the people within it.''|Casavir}}",
        "Description": "[[File:Casavir appearance.jpg|thumb|left|''Casavir's appearance.'']]\nAged in his 30s, black-haired and blue-eyed, Casavir was a well-built and dignified [[human]] with a handsome physique and sophisticated aura. Casavir would have been an image of strength were it not for the resigned expression that so often crossed his face. Dour and serious, Casavir was rarely exuberant but instead measured and calm in both speech and body language. Casavir was often dressed in [[full plate armor]] and his weapon of choice when the Kalach-Cha encountered him was a large [[warhammer]], paired with a [[shield]].",
        "Personality": "Virtuous by just about any measure, Casavir took his duties as a paladin very seriously. Adhering to his code to the letter, Casavir held himself to very high standards, standards that he himself, in spite of his constant vigilance against evil or temptation, often failed to meet. His high standards were likely in part due to his past, which involved his self-exile from [[Neverwinter]] and his estrangement from a lost love. Because of these personal failures and past mistakes, Casavir took it upon himself to fight injustice at all times, even to points that were sometimes unwise or overly brash, such as his crusade at [[Old Owl Well]].\n\nThis attitude put him at odds with the openly selfish and pragmatic Bishop, whose cruelty and evil ways disturbed the paladin as much as Casavir's refinement put Bishop at unease. Casavir also caused the [[tiefling]] [[Neeshka]] no small amount of discomfort, though the paladin seemingly held no grudge against her.",
        "History": {
            "Campaign at Old Owl Well": "After his exile from Neverwinter, Casavir wandered southwards to the outpost of Old Owl Well. There, he discovered the increasing strength and organization of [[orc]]ish raids upon the settlement, which he would later determine was due to increasing unification of the mountain tribes. Determined to prevent the outpost from falling into enemy hands and the settlers from being massacred, and determining that aid from Neverwinter was unlikely, Casavir took on the job of defending Old Owl Well himself, believing that one man could make a difference.\n\nFor the next few years, Casavir carried out numerous guerrilla strikes against the orcs, first on his own and later with the help of several warriors and mercenaries, including his sergeant [[Katriona]]. So successful were these raids that the orcs came to fear Casavir and his men, nicknaming him ''katalmach'', a term describing orcs who lost control of themselves in battle. Eventually, Casavir learned that the orcish chieftain [[Logram Eyegouger]] was behind the attacks and planned his attacks appropriately.\n\nThough at first Casavir's campaign received little to no aid from Neverwinter, the orcs drew the city's attention when an ambassador from [[Waterdeep]] disappeared as a part of a plot by [[Black Garius]] and other allies of the [[King of Shadows]]. Determining the orcs of the [[Sword Mountains]] might have something to do with it, Neverwinter chose to investigate the matter and sent an expedition. Incidentally, this expedition was led by Callum though it would be quite awhile before either Casavir or Callum became aware of the other's part in the campaign.",
            "The Shadow War": "The aid sent to Old Owl Well by Neverwinter included a hero known as the Kalach-Cha. As successful if not more so than Casavir had been initially, the Kalach-Cha attracted the paladin's attention shortly after destroying one of the orcish encampments. As the hero returned to Old Owl Well, they were ambushed by a group of Logram's warriors and it was then that Casavir made his appearance, counter-ambushing the orcs and lending aid to the Kalach-Cha that ultimately allowed the orcs to be defeated. Impressed with the Kalach-Cha's work, Casavir offered his service as an ally and loyal soldier.\n\nAlthough initially the two joined together only to defeat Logram, after the orc chieftain's defeat the paladin chose to stay with the Kalach-Cha. Promoting Katriona to take his place, Casavir left Old Owl Well and returned to Neverwinter, this time as the Kalach-Cha's ally and companion. There he hoped to make up for his past failures and may have proved an important part of the quest, possibly aiding in the Kalach-Cha's quest and potentially becoming close to the hero.\n\nCasavir later joined the Kalach-Cha and their other companions in the attack on the King of Shadows's fortress within the [[Vale of the Merdelain]]. [[Ammon Jerro]] would later claim that, during the collapse of the ruins following the King's defeat, he saw Casavir crushed beneath a pillar as he held it up so that his fellow survivors could escape.<ref> However, while Casavir was indeed gravely injured by the pillar, he was not killed. Instead, he was found by [[Luskan]]'s agents, captured, and brought to the City of Sails in chains. There he was evidently tried for murder and imprisoned.<ref>"
