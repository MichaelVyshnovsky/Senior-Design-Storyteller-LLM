Samsi Farlak was a dwarven inhabitant of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Samsi hated the sea, but he did enjoy telling stories relating to it.
Samsi was the owner of the Home of the Happy Dolphin, an inn located within the Trade Harbor district of Huzuz.
In order to make a profit, Samsi often watered-down wine and spirits served at the inn.
If the opportunity presented itself, Samsi would not balk at selling someone, preferably an outland barbarian, into slavery.
