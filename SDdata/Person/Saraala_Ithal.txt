Queen '''Saraala Ithal''' was the first queen of [[Tethyr]].

==Relationships==
Saraala was the eldest daughter of the chieftain of [[Clan Tarseth]] of the so-called "barbarian" clans of Tethyr, but her mother was an [[elf]], the daughter of [[Selanlar]] of the [[Tethir (tribe)|Tethir]] tribe, who was allied with the [[human]]s against [[Calimshan]]. This made Saraala a [[half-elf]].

Saraala fell in love with and married the new king of Tethyr [[Darrom Ithal]] of [[Clan Ithal]], becoming the country's first queen.

Darrom and Saraala had two sons and a daughter. The [[Darrom Ithal II|first son]] was named after his father; the second son was named [[Silvam Ithal|Silvam]].

Her brother, [[Amir Tarseth I]], became chieftain of Clan Tarseth after her father.

==History==
Saraala married King Darrom in the {{YearlinkName|-211}}. Since Saraala was a member of both Clan Tarseth and tribe Tethir, the union helped maintain the unity of the fledgling country.

Saraala bore three children in the first four years of their marriage: first Darrom II, then Silvam in {{Yearlink|-209}}, and finally a daughter in {{Yearlink|-207}}. Sadly, little Darrom died from a fever in {{Yearlink|-206}}.

In the {{YearlinkName|-200}}, [[Clan Bormul]] finished construction of a palace for the royal family, [[Ithalyr]], located on the coast in the [[Purple Hills]] region. The queen moved with the rest of the court from [[Ithmong]] to this new location.

In the month of [[Eleasis]] of the {{YearlinkName|-183}}, her own brother, Chieftain Amir I, became so angry with a decision made by her husband to pacify the elves of the [[Forest of Tethir]] that he orchestrated the murder of her husband by [[teleport]]ing a [[deepspawn]] into his throne room.

In {{Yearlink|-170}}, during the reign of her son Silvam, Saraala was strongly opposed to his decision to appoint his cousin's wife [[Zahyra Bardson-Ithal]] as Tethyr's first court vizera.
