Artur was an elderly brown bear in Marigolds Menagerie in the mid-14 century DR.
In his old age Artur was a rather lazy creature.
Artur spent most of his life as the animal companion to a druid. When his druid eventually died he was taken in by Marigold Mufflefoot and given a permanent home at Marigolds Menagerie, for he knew that simply letting the aged bear return to the wild would surely spell its death. Whenever Marigold could manage to get Artur outside to exercise, it always attracted a crowd.
