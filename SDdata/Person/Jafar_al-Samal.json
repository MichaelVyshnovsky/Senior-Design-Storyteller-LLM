        "mainbody": "'''Jafar al-Samal''', also known as '''Jafar the Incomparable''', was the first [[sha'ir]] in the land of [[Zakhara]].",
        "History": "Sometime in the far distant past, Jafar was able to negotiate with or summon [[gen]], and he gained great [[magical]] power from these associations. The lords of the [[dao]], [[djinn]], [[efreet]], and the [[marid]]s became jealous of his growing power and sent armies to invade Zakhara. In response, Jafar created a powerful relic known as the ''[[Seal of Jafar al-Samal|Seal]]'' that subjugated all [[genie]]s to the will of the (human) [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]] as long as it was in Jafar's possession.<ref group=\"note\">This power operated similarly to the way [[yak-men]] were able to summon and command dao.\n\nFor the rest of Jafar's lifespan, the people of Zakhara enjoyed a golden age of peace and prosperity. After his death, his students fought over possession of the ''Seal'', causing their gen to unite and rise up against the warring students by stealing the ''Seal'' and hiding it where it would never be found."
