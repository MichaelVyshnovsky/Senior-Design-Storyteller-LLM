'''Maraszymo Darluth''' was a woodcutter who worked around [[Secomber]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Maraszymo cut wood from the [[High Forest]], and was one of the most reliable and affordable suppliers of the raw lumber. He was linked by [[merchants' map]] to [[Samril's Fine Blades]] also in Secomber, who used the [[duskwood]] and [[blueleaf]] timber to make wooden handles for weapons such as [[longsword]]s.
