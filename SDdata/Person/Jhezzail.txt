Jhezzail was a young acolyte of Sel√ªne living at Moonshadow Hall in Yhaunn in 1373 DR.
Jhezzail was a thin girl whose robes of silver and blue were too big for her, who looked to be no older than fourteen years old in 1373 DR. She carried a mace etched with the symbol of a crescent moon on its head that she wore hanging from her belt.
Jhezzail did her best to be friendly and polite, even in uncomfortable situations.
Jhezzail was usually tasked with sentry duty at Moonshadow Halls main gate, which mainly involved greeting or turning away visitors.
Jhezzail was on sentry duty when Feena Archwood arrived to aid High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar.
She was unfortunate enough to witness the bloody aftermath of Dhaunas attempt to force Feena to infect herself with lycanthropy, and followed Feenas instructions to use belladonna on the victim. She was then assigned to guard Feenas room, but was overcome by the more experienced priestess by charming and paralysis magic, allowing Feena to bind and gag her, then escape the temple.
