'''Jhezzail''' was a young acolyte of [[Selûne]] living at [[Moonshadow Hall]] in [[Yhaunn]] in [[1373 DR]].

==Description==
Jhezzail was a thin girl whose robes of silver and blue were too big for her, who looked to be no older than fourteen years old in 1373 DR. She carried a [[mace]] etched with the symbol of a crescent moon on its head that she wore hanging from her belt.

==Personality==
Jhezzail did her best to be friendly and polite, even in uncomfortable situations.

==Activities==
Jhezzail was usually tasked with sentry duty at [[Moonshadow Hall]]'s main gate, which mainly involved greeting or turning away visitors.

==History==
Jhezzail was on sentry duty when [[Feena Archwood]] arrived to aid High Moonmistress [[Dhauna Myritar]].

She was unfortunate enough to witness the bloody aftermath of Dhauna's attempt to force Feena to infect herself with [[lycanthropy]], and followed Feena's instructions to use [[belladonna]] on the victim. She was then assigned to guard Feena's room, but was overcome by the more experienced priestess by [[Charm person|charming]] and [[Hold person|paralysis]] magic, allowing Feena to bind and gag her, then escape the temple.
