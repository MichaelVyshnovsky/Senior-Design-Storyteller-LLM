'''Yanna Hammerbound''' was a [[dwarf]] and a high-ranking member of the [[Ironhanded]] in [[Phlan]] during the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].

==History==
Yanna worked as high-ranking member of Phlan's Ironworkers' Guild. One day in [[1489 DR]], she went to the [[Madame Freona's Tea Kettle]] to meet a merchant named [[Trett]] in order to buy a powerful magic item. When a ''[[lightning]]'' spell from inside the item hit Trett, Yanna tried to escape with the magic item but was captured by adventurers hired by [[Buhrell Caah]].{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|24-25}}
