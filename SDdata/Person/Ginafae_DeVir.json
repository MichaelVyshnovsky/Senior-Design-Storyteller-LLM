        "mainbody": "'''Ginafae DeVir''' was the [[matron mother]] of [[House DeVir]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] until its destruction in [[1297 DR]].",
        "History": "In [[1297 DR]], Ginafae DeVir was the matron mother of the fourth house and thus the youngest matron in the Ruling Council. During a drow raid against [[svirfneblin]], she used her clerical powers to aid the deep gnomes (the drow's greatest enemies) so that they would kill the [[wizard]] son of the third house, House DeVir's chosen enemy. In doing so, Ginafae lost the favor of [[Lolth]]. Her house was subsequently destroyed by [[House Do'Urden]]. Ginafae herself was killed by [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]], who used his whip to take out her tongue as she tried to cast a spell.\n\nAfter her death, Ginafae's [[ghost]] was summoned by her son, [[Alton DeVir]], who was attempting to learn the identity of the house that destroyed House DeVir. Before she could answer, however, a [[yochlol]] interrupted and revealed that as a fallen priestess, Ginafae was continuously tormented in the [[Abyss]].",
        "Relationships": "Ginafae had two living daughters in [[1297 DR]]. [[Alton DeVir]] was her son."
