        "mainbody": "inafae DeVir was the matron mother of House DeVir in Menzoberranzan until its destruction in 1297 DR.\nIn 1297 DR, Ginafae DeVir was the matron mother of the fourth house and thus the youngest matron in the Ruling Council. During a drow raid against svirfneblin, she used her clerical powers to aid the deep gnomes (the drows greatest enemies) so that they would kill the wizard son of the third house, House DeVirs chosen enemy. In doing so, Ginafae lost the favor of Lolth. Her house was subsequently destroyed by House DoUrden. Ginafae herself was killed by Zaknafein DoUrden, who used his whip to take out her tongue as she tried to cast a spell.\nAfter her death, Ginafaes ghost was summoned by her son, Alton DeVir, who was attempting to learn the identity of the house that destroyed House DeVir. Before she could answer, however, a yochlol interrupted and revealed that as a fallen priestess, Ginafae was continuously tormented in the Abyss.\nGinafae had two living daughters in 1297 DR. Alton DeVir was her son."
