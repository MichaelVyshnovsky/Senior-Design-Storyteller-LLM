'''Zellix''' was a [[mind flayer]] who founded and managed an asylum in the [[Underdark]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Zellix discovered that brains of people infected by the [[demon lord]]s' madness ''circa'' [[1486 DR]] were more succulent and tasty than others. So it founded an asylum where it could keep them until the right time. It also sent [[intellect devourer]] servants to lure new subjects into its asylum..
