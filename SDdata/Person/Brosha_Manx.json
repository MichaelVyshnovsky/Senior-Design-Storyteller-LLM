        "mainbody": "'''Brosha Manx''' was a [[half-elf]] [[apothecary]] and proprietor of the [[Loudwater Apothecary]] in [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He was thin and had a scarred face and shaking hands as a result of failed attempts at making [[potion]]s in his younger days.",
        "Personality": "Brosha had a dour, listless, and terse manner and disliked small talk.",
        "Activities": "Publicly, Brosha did not pay protection money to the [[Lady of Shadows]]. Privately, this was because he was one of her gang already. In [[1479 DR]], [[Calla Maran]] hoped Brosha would be an ally in resisting the Lady of Shadows. She would be wrong."
