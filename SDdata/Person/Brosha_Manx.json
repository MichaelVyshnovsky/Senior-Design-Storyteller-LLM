        "mainbody": "rosha Manx was a half-elf apothecary and proprietor of the Loudwater Apothecary in Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 15 century DR.\nHe was thin and had a scarred face and shaking hands as a result of failed attempts at making potions in his younger days.\nBrosha had a dour, listless, and terse manner and disliked small talk.\nPublicly, Brosha did not pay protection money to the Lady of Shadows. Privately, this was because he was one of her gang already. In 1479 DR, Calla Maran hoped Brosha would be an ally in resisting the Lady of Shadows. She would be wrong."
