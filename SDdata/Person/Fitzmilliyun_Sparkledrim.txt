Fitzmilliyun Sparkledrim was a mighty gnome illusionist who lived centuries before the 14 century DR, when Ascalhorn was in its prime.
He hailed from the Shinglefell Gnome Burrow, which was lost by the 14 century DR.
Fitzmilliyun later erected the keep known as the Castle of Illusion in the Fell Pass in the Frost Hills in the Silver Marches. He defended it with illusions, traps, and puzzles.
A century after Fitzmilliyuns death, a tribe of orcs living nearby overwhelmed the castle and slew his servants before they settled in the ruined castle. They sought treasure, but found none. However, Fitzmilliyuns lethal magical defenses lingered long after his passing, killing a lot of the orcs, maddening many more, and driving them away.
He was known to be a droll little fellow.
Fitzmilliyun placed illusions and glamers, wards, traps, and subtle yet deadly puzzles all through the castle, below it, and outside it. These combined mechanical tricks and magical illusions, so even the most perceptive would be deceived. His treasures were all concealed by the puzzles and traps. Some of his grandest puzzles were
* Milliyuns Mirror Maze A hall of mirrors, perhaps with a mirror of life trapping and a mirror of opposition built in.
* The Crystal Cube A cube of seemingly indestructible crystal, 10 feet (3 meters) to a side, containing valuable treasure and at least three skeletons.
* Ten Doors, No-Way-Out A room with ten doors when a door was opened, the whole room seemed to spin around. Only one door was an exit, while the rest unleashed traps or magical guardians.
