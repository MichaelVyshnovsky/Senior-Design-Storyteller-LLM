        "mainbody": "'''Alanis Dirgesong''' was a traveling bard who specialized in depressing and despondent songs in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{Quote|''Our lives, which fall like leaves in [[Uktar]],<br/>blown off life's tree by death's cold wind,<br/>flutter to the ground, spent and lifeless,<br/>then buried in snow that Auril sends.''|Alanis Dirgesong, mournful bard}}",
        "Description": "Alanis had long black hair and gray eyes. She dressed in a white blouse with a black leather bodice and leggings.",
        "Personality": "She had a constantly gloomy mood, and enjoyed wallowing in self-pity and woe in any circumstance.",
        "Abilities": "Alanis had a variety of bardic magical abilities that she used to protect herself and enhance her performances. She adored portraying her spells as evidence of her futile struggle against her doomed fate.",
        "Possessions": "Alanis carried a [[short sword]] and wore enchanted ''+5 [[leather armor]]''. Her tool of the trade was a black [[harp]], and she also carried a ''[[ring of free action]]'' and an ''[[Figurine of wondrous power|onyx dog figurine]]''. She traveled about on a [[pony]].",
        "Activities": "Alanis traveled the Realms and performed her music widely, gaining a significant following despite her depressing and pitiful persona. She wrote and performed songs about subjects such as doomed lovers, infants dying in the crib, futile struggles against fate, and [[adventurer]]s that were lost and forgotten. He work was adored by Lord [[Rhyn Mournsoul]] in particular.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, she was traveling in eastern [[Cormyr]] and stayed overnight at the [[Journey's Rest]] inn. When the [[vampire]] innkeepers [[Ryanna]] and [[Moria]] attacked the other customers, she immediately accepted her death and began composing an epitaph. Fortunately for Alanis, the vampires did not consider her a target as she was too famous and her disappearance would draw too much attention to the inn."
