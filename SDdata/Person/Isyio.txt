'''Isyio''' was a wizard in [[Teziir]] in [[1359 DR]].

==History==
Once Isyio was an apprentice of the [[Simbul]] but after he embarrassed her, the Simbul sent him away in order to mature.

In 1359 DR, he was in Teziir doing magical research and teaching [[magic]] to the children of the [[Teziir City Council]]'s members. He was still hurt by the Simbul's words and his goal was to prove his sincerity and go back to [[Aglarond]].
