        "Personality": "In life and undeath, Olanthius was a person of great thoughtfulness and compassion.",
        "Possessions": "Throughout his existence, he kept a series of journals, which detailed his thoughts, feelings, and later on the conflict he felt as a creature of undeath.",
        "Relationships": "Following their descent into the Hells, Olanthius came to truly detest Zariel.{{Template:Cite book/Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|103}}\n\nWhile he did not share the outlook of his fellow Hellrider [[Haruman]], whom he viewed as being devoid of understanding and compassion, he held great veneration and love for General [[Yael]].",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1354}}, the [[angel]] Zariel led the Hellriders from Elturel to Avernus in an epic extra-planar military campaign that came to be known as [[the Ride]]. While some of the soldiers bravely fought through the ranks of [[devil]]s, others retreated back to [[Toril]], leaving Zariel with too few men to hold their ground.\n\nOlanthius and his fellow commander Haruman refused to leave Zariel's side, remaining united until they were taken to [[Nessus]] and the angel was compelled to swear allegiance to [[Asmodeus]]. Distraught over the angel's betrayal of their shared ideals, Olanthius took his own life. He found no peace in death however, as he was raised as a [[death knight]] by Zariel, made to serve as her lieutenant for eternity.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Olanthius made his home within the [[Crypt of the Hellriders]].{{Template:Cite book/Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|102}} While he was compelled to protect the site, he could readily travel anywhere on Avernus."
