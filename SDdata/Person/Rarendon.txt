Rarendon was a priest of Chauntea in the mid–8 century DR.
He was old.
He was kindly, but confused.
Rarendon was evicted from the Shrine of the Sheaf in Buckralams Starn around , when the bandits of the Iron Fox took over the town. He lived in the old stables behind the local mill since then.
After the Chosen of Mystra Elminster Aumar liberated the town from the Iron Fox, he told a local woman, Immeira, to take Rarendon to Saern Hill.
