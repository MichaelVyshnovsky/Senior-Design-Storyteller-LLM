'''Rarendon''' was a priest of [[Chauntea]] in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was old.

==Personality==
He was kindly, but confused.

==History==
Rarendon was evicted from the [[Shrine of the Sheaf]] in [[Buckralam's Starn]] around {{yearlink|755}}, when the bandits of the [[Iron Fox]] took over the town. He lived in the old stables behind the local mill since then.

After the [[Chosen of Mystra]] [[Elminster Aumar]] liberated the town from the Iron Fox, he told a local woman, [[Immeira]], to take Rarendon to [[Saern Hill]].{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|536|2}}
