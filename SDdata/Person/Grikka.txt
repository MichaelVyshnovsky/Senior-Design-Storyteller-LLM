==Description==
He had yellow skin and long, brown hair. Like other goblin 'trackers', Grikka wore leather armor adorned with various bones.

Grikka decorated himself with blue body paint.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the cult of the Absolute launched a raid against the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn. It was unknown if Grikka was among those goblins who participated in the raid, but he was definitely present for the celebratory feast afterwards.
