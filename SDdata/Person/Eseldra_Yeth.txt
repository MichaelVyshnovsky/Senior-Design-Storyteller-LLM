'''Eseldra Yeth''' was a [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] and the [[tharchion]] of [[Lapendrar]] from around the [[1387 DR|Year of the Emerald Ermine, 1387 DR]], until the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Eseldra was a [[vampire]] and a follower of [[Szass Tam]] that was appointed tharchion of [[Lapendrar]] ''circa'' [[1387 DR]] and remained in that position until the [[Tyranny of Dragons]] a century later.
She remembered well the [[War of the Zulkirs]] and to avoid a return to that time wanted to eradicate all exiled [[Red Wizard]]s.
A band of adventurers who were working against the [[Cult of the Dragon]] convinced her to gather together all the other factions to thwart [[Rath Modar]]'s faction because he planned to ally with [[Tiamat]] and conquer [[Thay]].
