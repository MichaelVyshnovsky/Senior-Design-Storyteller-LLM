Lord Ilmeth barely tolerated adventurers in his presence, so long as they remained out of his way.\n\nWar-Chancellor Ilmeth was an accomplished warrior. He inherited the lordship of Essembra in [[1351 DR]].\n\nDisputes and justice were traditionally resolved by the lord of Essembra. Ilmeth disliked this duty, but tried to be as fair as possible.\n\n{{stub-person}}",
