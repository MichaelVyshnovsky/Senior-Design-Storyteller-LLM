        "mainbody": "Notia Tong was an elderly hare hengeyokai wu jen living in a temple in the forested Valley of Lo Chi in the midâ€“14 century DR, acting as the guardian of a hare hengeyokai tribe.\nHe was not the type to be outright hostile to strangers. However, Tong would attack anyone that entered his temple with the intent to disturb or destroy.\nTong was capable of casting the following spells as a wu jen cloud ladder, conjure elemental, dancing blade, haste, hold person, hypnotic pattern, hypnotism, know history, magic missile, polymorph other, smoke shape, steam breath, stinking cloud, and wall of fog.\nTong wore a set of leather armor and wielded a katana.\nTong labored for many years protecting both his tribe and temple from the ravages of the shukenja Ko Hung Cho and his monks from Lo Chi monastery. The constant vigilance and mental concentration this required of him taxed Tongs body over time, making it age prematurely. At some point, he sent his son Phags-pa to go learn the ways of that monastery, as he knew almost nothing about them himself.\nLater, around , a group of adventurers from Shou Lung came to his temple in search of the Flowers of Flame, to which he smiled and nodded as if expecting their arrival. He asked them of their place of origins, details on their journey, and what was the purpose of it, and he checked what they said against his know history spell. All the while, ten of Tongs tribesmen stood in the forest awaiting any sign that they should intervene. When asked of the Flowers of Flame, Tong told the adventurers that he knew only rumors."
