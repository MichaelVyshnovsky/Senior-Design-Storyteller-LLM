        "Abilities": "Like other dark nagas, Kog was a powerful adversary, adept at spellcasting. Kog also could spit venom. The dark naga was immune to [[poison]]s and resistant to [[charm]] effects.",
        "History": "Sometime before 1369 DR, Kog and his dark nagas came to inhabit a small open-air temple of [[Mystra]] in the ruined [[Nightingale Court]] of Myth Drannor. The nagas were in conflict with the restless spirit of [[Anorrweyn Evensong]], the long-dead leader of Myth Drannor's [[Sisterhood of Silver Fire]], the sect that worshiped the goddess of Magic. In 1369 DR, the [[Cult of the Dragon]] led by [[Kya Mordrayn]] arrived at Myth Drannor to find and take control of the city's ''pool of radiance''. With the ''pool'' corrupted, it started creating smaller \"tendrils\" of sorts to spread its effects, called ''spawn pools''. One such pool surfaced in the ruined temple of Mystra, where the nagas resided. Kog pledged himself, Skerndli, and Gorgat to the ''pool'' allowing it to power them, grow, and strengthen.[[File:Naga totem.jpg|thumb|270x270px|''A mysterious totem worshiped by the dark nagas under Kog.'']]\n\nThe ''pool'' was a pure exposed part of the [[Weave]] and it allowed the nagas to tap into its energies to weaken and banish the [[ghost]] of Anorrweyn Evensong. In her weakened state, she reached out to the group of heroes, the [[Veiled Ones]], who were working to bring down the Cult on behest of [[Elminster]]. The adventurers confronted the nagas who converted the temple of Mystra to a shrine with an odd and mysterious totem tied to the nagas and the ''pool''. Kog and his dark nagas attacked the Veiled Ones, thinking them to be dinner. After a fierce magic-slinging battle, the adventurers slew the corrupted nagas and smashed the idol. With the slaves of the ''pool'' gone and its focus destroyed, the ''spawn pool'' drained, allowing the benevolent ghost of Anorrweyn to regain her power and return to aid the Veiled Ones."
