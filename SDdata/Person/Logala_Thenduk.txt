Logala Thenduk was a female drow wererat rogue and a member of the Hidden during the Silence of Lolth.
Although a drow, Logala spent much of her time in her dire rat form to avoid detection.
Inquisitive and sneaky, much like a rat, Logala was always hungry for information.
As both a drow and a wererat, Logalas innate aptitude for stealth was particularly impressive. This was further enhanced thanks to her ability to transform into a dire rat and move unnoticed around the Underdark.
In combat, Logala relied on attacking an opponent from the shadows and darting away again to deadly effect.
Logala traveled lightly as she depended on the natural abilities of her wererat forms most of the time. However, she was equipped with a fine light crossbow, 20 bolts, and a rapier at least.
As a member of the Hidden, Logala worked closely with its other members to try and restore Maerimydra. She also had a large number of rat allies to assist her.
During the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR, the drow city Maerimydra fell to the armies of Kurgoth Hellspawn and the undead minions of Irae Tsarran. Logala Thenduk was one of a number of lurking drow and other "invisibles" who had evaded detection since Maerimydras conquest. She was recruited by Hamadh the Unseen and united with others in common purpose against the occupying armies. With the newly formed Hidden, Logala helped to restore Maerimydra to its former glory and driving out the respective forces of Kurgoth Hellspawn and Irae Tsarran.
Logala was often sent on scouting mission with Wisp and Guk to spy on the forces in Maerimydra and keep an eye out for potential allies. She and Guk would provide support while the more personable Wisp approached likely candidates.
