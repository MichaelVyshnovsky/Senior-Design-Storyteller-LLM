'''Krystryd Mithralforge''' was the [[dwarf]] blacksmith of [[Quaervarr]] in [[1484 DR]].

==History==
After [[Highharvestide]] of 1484 DR, a supposed [[phantom]] started appearing in the village. One night, Krystryd saw the phantom and was greatly scared. However, she was more worried about rumors she heard from her kin in [[Mithral Hall]] about [[orc]] movements.
