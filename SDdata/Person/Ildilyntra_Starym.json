        "mainbody": "'''Ildilyntra Starym''' was a matriarch of the [[Starym]] clan of [[elves]] in of [[Cormanthyr]] in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]]. She was a chief opponent of [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl]]'s plan to open [[Cormanthor]] to non-elves, and took her own life to form a [[blood dragon]] in an attempt to slay the elven ruler.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|11-13|0}}{{cite book/Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves|117}}",
        "Description": "Ildilyntra was known for her dark eyes that glinted gold when she was full of emotion, and her dark blue-black hair, which she wore unbound and so long it nearly touched the ground. She had perfect blue-white skin that shone brilliantly.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|4-6|0}}",
        "Relations": "Ildilyntra once had a relationship with Coronal Eltargrim, as friends and possibly lovers.",
        "History": "Ildilyntra, angered by the Coronal's refusal to halt his plans for the [[History of Myth Drannor|Opening]] (in which all races could come to Cormanthor and enjoy its beauty), came to him in the {{YearlinkName|241}} to plead with him in person. When he still would not be swayed, she took her own life with her honor blade, stabbing herself once in the breast, the neck, and the eye, to form a blood dragon that would attempt to slay Eltargrim. The Coronal defeated the dragon with magic and her attempt was in vain. Despite this attack, the Coronal had her buried with full honors and returned her family's relics without question."
