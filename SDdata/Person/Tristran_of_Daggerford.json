        "mainbody": "Tristran of Daggerford was a human wizard adventurer who worked in Cormyr during the late 15 century DR.\nTristran had pale skin, blond hair, and wore a dark robe.\nAround the time of the Darkening, Tristran and his adventuring companions Jarus Brithandir, Kirina Aelorothi, Popkin Shortshanks, Helayna, and Liantor Stoneborn discovered an ancient Netherese tomb at the bottom of a crevasse in the Stonelands. They fought their way past some none-too-threatening undead inhabitants, then found a hidden passage leading deeper underground. After passing into the extensive cave system, the group was ambushed by the kobolds of Clan Daeronnax, who overwhelmed and separated the group. Although Popkin was able to escape to Eveningstar to get assistance, the rest of the group remained trapped in the caves.\nTristran eventually got knocked unconscious by the kobolds after his magical abilities ran dry, and was delivered as a prize to the lair of the red dragon Daeronnax. The great dragon considered him nothing more than a snack for later, and so kept Tristran chained up next to his piles of treasure until Popkins allies finally arrived and saved the unfortunate wizard."
