'''Liza''' was a female [[human]] refugee in [[Fort Locke]] near the [[Mere of Dead Men]] on the [[Sword Coast North]].

==History==
Liza was one of a group of people that traveled around the [[Mere of Dead Men]] in [[1374 DR]]. They were attacked by bandits. She and others escaped, while the bandits took some people into their camp. She asked the [[Kalach-Cha]] to find those people and rescue them.
