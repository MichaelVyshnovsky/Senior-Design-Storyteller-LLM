'''Sharth''' was a High One of the [[illithid]]s and one of three persons responsible for creating the [[World Serpent Inn]], according to the [[wizard]] [[Elminster]].

==Relationships==
Very little is known about Sharth except that he is said to have joined the friends [[Alaurum]] and [[Ilyndele]]&mdash;a [[Toril]]ian [[archmage]] and a member of [[Arcane (race)|the Arcane]], respectively&mdash;in "crafting" the inter-planar inn.

==History==
Hundreds of years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Alaurum, Ilyndele, and Sharth built the inn itself. The [[demiplane]] within which the inn resided&mdash;and the plane's many portals&mdash;had already existed, supposed by some cosmologists to be a [[dreamscape]] resulting from a sleeping fragment of the [[World Serpent]].
