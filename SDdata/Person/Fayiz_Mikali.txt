Fayiz Mikali was a crewman on the pirate vessel Leap for the Throat in 1367 DR.
As a sea mage, Fayiz made good use of his powers while raiding merchant vessels sailing on Suq Bay. Fayiz was also in charge of the other wizards onboard the ship.
Fayiz owned a special mirror of mental prowess that Almari bint-Kafira used to communicate with Prince Tannous al-Assad back in Huzuz.
