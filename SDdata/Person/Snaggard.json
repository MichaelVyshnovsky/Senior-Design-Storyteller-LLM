        "mainbody": "Farmer '''Snaggard''' was an inhabitant of the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He lived a long way down the west swamp road near Ghars.\n\nSince the days of his youth, Snaggard had a liking for the West Fennet Number Three variety of [[pipeweed]]. He even grew a small plot of it for personal use each year on his farm, and because the tobacconist in Ghars refused to stock it.\n\nSnaggard was also a regular of the [[Swamp Rat]] tavern, and was there on [[Eleint 17]], [[1367 DR]]. [[Benelaius]] used these facts in a display of his powers of observation, deducing that [[Jaspar (servant)|Jasper]] had also been to the Swamp Rat."
