        "mainbody": "Farmer Snaggard was an inhabitant of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR. He lived a long way down the west swamp road near Ghars.\nSince the days of his youth, Snaggard had a liking for the West Fennet Number Three variety of pipeweed. He even grew a small plot of it for personal use each year on his farm, and because the tobacconist in Ghars refused to stock it.\nSnaggard was also a regular of the Swamp Rat tavern, and was there on Eleint 17, 1367 DR. Benelaius used these facts in a display of his powers of observation, deducing that Jasper had also been to the Swamp Rat."
