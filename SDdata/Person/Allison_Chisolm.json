        "mainbody": "'''Allison Chisolm''' was a baker at the family-run [[Downunda Patisserie]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/51/The Living City: The Downunda Patisserie|16,17,31}}",
        "Relationships": "She was the daughter of [[Jemima Chisolm|Jemima]] and [[Arvend Chisolm]], and the middle sister of [[Derek Chisolm|Derek]] and [[Karl Chisolm|Karl]].",
        "Personality": "Allison was kind and friendly to everyone, and while she understood how beautiful she was, she wasn't conceited or vain. She loved her family and loved to spoil Karl. Unlike her mother and brothers, she was willing to talk about her father, but only in confidence and when her family weren't around.\n\nWhile she'd had no chance to get formal schooling, her experiences made her wiser than others her age. Allison was interested in [[magic]] and yearned for adventure, especially if good-looking young men were involved. There was a good chance she'd run off with a band of young fellow adventures to become an [[adventurer]] herself some day, possibly as a [[thief]] or [[magic-user]], with proper training. But her mother feared this and disapproved of adventurers.",
        "Description": "At age 17, Allison stood {{SI|5'2\"|'\"|long=yes}} and weighed {{SI|111|lb|k|long=yes}}. She had flame-red hair and eyes that matched her mother's bright blue, and strikingly beautiful. Her mother rationed her and her siblings to only three of the bakery's smaller cakes a week to prevent them putting on weight.",
        "Activities": "She lived above the store. Allison was kept busy helping her mother in the bakery by putting out and selling goods and working second shifts at the ovens, and running the store when Jemima was busy.{{Cite organized play/LC/Invitation to a Wedding|9,10}}",
        "History": "When her father Arvend was executed for murder and all the family's belongings seized, leaving them destitute and ashamed, Allison left with her family to build a new life. They arrived in Ravens Bluff and purchased the bakery. She was still working there by [[1370 DR]]."
