        "mainbody": "eskulladar, also known as Manytalons, was a silver dragon.\nIn 947 DR, Teskulladar killed the white dragon Cortulorrulagalargath in a battle above the realm of Calandor, indirectly causing the deaths of the Duke of Calandor and his retinue when the defeated Cortulorrulagalargath fell upon Delimbiyran.\nTeskulladar eventually met and fell in love with the song dragon Essembramaerytha. After they married, they traveled together across the Dalelands for many years until the day both disappeared without a trace. There were many legends about what fate befell the two dragons, but the truth was that they simply retired to live in Evermeet."
