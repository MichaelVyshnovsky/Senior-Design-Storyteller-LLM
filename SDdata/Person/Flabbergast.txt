Flabbergast was a wizard who served Acquisitions Incorporated as a mojordomo in the late 15 century DR.
He was rarely seen without his familiar, Mister Snibbly.
Little was known of Flabbergasts history, although his family was said to come from Neverwinter, and that they had helped to erect the Dolphin Bridge there.
At some point in his life, Flabbergast had worked for the rival company Dran Enterprises, and their boss Portentia Dran.
He later left to serve Acquisitions Inc. instead, and was there by 1496 DR.
