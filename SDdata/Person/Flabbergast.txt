'''Flabbergast''' was a [[wizard]] who served [[Acquisitions Incorporated]] as a mojordomo in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relations==
He was rarely seen without his [[familiar]], [[Mister Snibbly]].

==History==
Little was known of Flabbergast's history, although his family was said to come from [[Neverwinter]], and that they had helped to erect the [[Dolphin Bridge]] there.

At some point in his life, Flabbergast had worked for the rival company [[Dran Enterprises]], and their boss [[Portentia Dran (changeling)|Portentia Dran]].

He later left to serve Acquisitions Inc. instead, and was there by [[1496 DR]].
