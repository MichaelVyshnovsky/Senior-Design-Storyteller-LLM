        "mainbody": "'''Arleosa Starhenge''' was a tavern owner in [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the {{YearlinkName|1485}}.",
        "Description": "Arleosa had gray hair and cleverly ironic sense of humor.",
        "Abilities": "She had the inborn ability to ''[[alter self]]'' a few times a day.",
        "Possessions": "In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], she was the proprietor of the [[Stag-Horned Flagon]], a tavern in the village of Amphail. She had a magic [[ring]] made of wood and carved with cavorting [[nymph]]s. She was told that it would provide aid or advice if she spoke the name of its creator into the ring, but she never availed herself of this boon.",
        "Relationships": "Arleosa knew [[Miros Xelbrin]] from her years with a traveling carnival and they were still friends into retirement.",
        "History": "Arleosa was of Chondathan descent, born in an area infused with [[wild magic]] which apparently gave her a shapechanging ability. This ability led her to join a carnival and she traveled widely for many years. In the late 1480s or early 1490s, she settled in Amphail where she bought the Stag-Horned Flagon tavern and worked as a tavernmaster. No one in Amphail knew of her magical nature and she did not use her ability any more, having retired from that life."
