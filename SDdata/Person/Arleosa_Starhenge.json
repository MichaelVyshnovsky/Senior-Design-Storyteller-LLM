She had a magic ring made of wood and carved with cavorting nymphs. She was told that it would provide aid or advice if she spoke the name of its creator into the ring, but she never availed herself of this boon.\nArleosa knew Miros Xelbrin from her years with a traveling carnival and they were still friends into retirement.\nArleosa was of Chondathan descent, born in an area infused with wild magic which apparently gave her a shapechanging ability. This ability led her to join a carnival and she traveled widely for many years. In the late 1480s or early 1490s, she settled in Amphail where she bought the Stag-Horned Flagon tavern and worked as a tavernmaster. No one in Amphail knew of her magical nature and she did not use her ability any more, having retired from that life."
