        "mainbody": "Yahlir Smoothtongue was a honey-tongued adventuring bard and a historian, active in the 14 century DR.\nYahlir had a light heart, glib tongue, and light feet.\nYahlir claimed to have earned his bard title at a court in the Snowhigh Towers. No one knew of the places existence, as it was likely completely fictional. By the age of twenty-two, Yahlir was known for being too brash and too boastful, uncharacteristically for a bard from any court in Faer√ªn. Despite that, Smoothtongue had a vast knowledge of history, lore, and songs. He valued ancient art and jewelry above all else. Yahlir made a living as an adventurer and a mercenary archeologist because being a poet paid little.\nSometime in the 14 century DR, Yahlir Smoothtonguet was among adventurers interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths."
