'''Finder''' was the name given to a [[Netherese]] [[human]] who found the [[Nether Scrolls]] in the [[Nether Age]].

==History==
It's said that he found the scrolls while searching a ruined building west of the [[Far Horns Forest]] in {{YearlinkConvert|326|NY}}. The ruins were from a strange species who apparently had more than two legs, likely quadrupedal, and who used the wall and the floor equally. After he found the scrolls and studied them for years, he brought them to the wizards of [[Alliance of Seventon|Seventon]] and [[Zenith]].
