On his way, though, he saw the village of Ember destroyed. Elgun came back home, but began telling stories of how he defeated Embers attackers.\nThe Kalach-Cha could have gathered information about Ember and confronted Elgun with the knowledge. Elgun would hesitate, but if undeniable proof was given, Elgun would explain the real story of what had happened."
