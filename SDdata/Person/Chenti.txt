'''Chenti''' was a [[human]] [[Harper]] who followed the Harper hero [[Jaheira]] to the [[Shadow-cursed lands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Chenti had sun-kissed skin and bob-length blondish-brown hair. She had a [[tattoo]] of a small bird in flight under her left eye. Chenti wore blue [[robe]]s and was armed with a [[quarterstaff]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Jaheira was alerted to the mysterious return of [[Ketheric Thorm]], now a leader of a [[Cult of the Absolute|cultist army]] that worshiped [[The Absolute]]. Harper Chenti was one of the agents who accompanied Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed lands surrounding the [[Moonrise Towers]]â€”General Thorm's seat of power.

When a group of [[True Soul]]s arrived at the [[Last Light Inn]], which the Harpers had claimed as a temporary base, Chenti was among those present for the events that followed. When [[Marcus]] of the [[Flaming Fist]] revealed himself to be a cultist and a turncoat, Chenti lamented that and the fact that she could've never imagined him to betray the Harpers and the Fist. In the end, Chenti concluded that the betrayal was not Marcus's fault but the parasite the Absolute had implanted in his head. It was unknown if Harper Chenti survived the war with the Absolute; she might've perished after the Last Light Inn was consumed by the darkness or else survived with the rest, storming the [[Moonrise Towers]] to end General Thorm's reign.
