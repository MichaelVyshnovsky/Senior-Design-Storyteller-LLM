        "mainbody": "Randalf was a lightfoot halfling from the Rivington district of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nRandalf was a handsome, polite, and well-dressed pale-skinned blond halfling with blue eyes. He wore a quality leather jerkin, a leather circlet, and simple muddy-green breeches.\nIn the , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldurs Gate, displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. However, Sylvie Summerworth was not particularly frightened by the encroaching army. Instead of being worried about the looming doom to the city of Baldurs Gate, Randalf and his friend Sylvie Summerworth stressed over undelivered pigeon mail. Randalf attended to Sylvie as she raged over Sword Coast Courier pigeon mail and suggested others to hold on to the mail until the situation was resolved. Unbeknownst to most, the pigeons were hunted and eaten by Gale Dekarioss tressym named Tara, who recently followed her master to Baldurs Gate from Waterdeep."
