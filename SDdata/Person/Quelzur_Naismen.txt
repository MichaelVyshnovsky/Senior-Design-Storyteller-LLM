'''Quelzur Naisen''' was a member of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] and a pirate in [[1359 DR]].

==History==
Quelzur was a talented wizard but frequently came into conflict with his superiors and was not prone to making friends. So, when he offended the powerful [[zulkir]] [[Szass Tam]], Quelzur decided to go into voluntary exile instead of risking becoming one of Tam's [[zombie]]s.

Quickly, he turned to piracy and became a very able pirate thanks to his ''[[censer for summoning hostile air elementals|censer for summoning air elementals]]'', which transformed his ship into one of the most maneuverable vessels on the [[Inner Sea]].

==Personality==
Quelzur maintained the typical mentality of a [[Red Wizard]], in which wizards were superior to any non-wizard. He lorded over his crew like a godling. He still dressed like a Red Wizard.
