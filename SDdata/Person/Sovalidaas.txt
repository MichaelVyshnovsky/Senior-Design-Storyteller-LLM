General '''Sovalidaas''' was a military commander of [[Suldanessellar]].

==Description==
Sovalidaas was not proficient in combat, but fought with a ''+2'' [[magic|enchanted]] [[longsword]] and wore ''[[elven chainmail]]''.

==Personality==
The general was bold and did not have much trust for others, other than those in his [[elf|elven]] legion. He particularly despised [[drow]], who his kin fought often.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], [[Gorion's Ward]] reached Suldanessellar and was taken to the suspicious general. The general passed the ward on to [[Elhan]].
