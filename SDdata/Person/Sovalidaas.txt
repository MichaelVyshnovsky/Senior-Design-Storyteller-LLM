General Sovalidaas was a military commander of Suldanessellar.
Sovalidaas was not proficient in combat, but fought with a +2 enchanted longsword and wore elven chainmail.
The general was bold and did not have much trust for others, other than those in his elven legion. He particularly despised drow, who his kin fought often.
In 1369 DR, Gorions Ward reached Suldanessellar and was taken to the suspicious general. The general passed the ward on to Elhan.
