'''Jamison''' was the fletcher of the [[Bloodstone Village]] in [[1357 DR]].
 
==Activities==
Jamison was very popular with the ladies and always friendly. He was a regular customer of the [[Inn of the Clowns]] and had good connections with the woodmen. However, in truth, he was a bandit spy.

==History==
In 1357 DR, when [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s party arrived at the village, Jamison tried to gather as much information about the adventurers as possible. That night, he went out of the village to send a falcon with a report about the adventurers to the [[Grandfather of Assassins]]. In answer, the Grandfather ordered Jamison to kill the adventurers.
