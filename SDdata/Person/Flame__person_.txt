'''Flame''' was a smuggler and kidnapper who lived in the city of [[Selgaunt]], in [[Sembia]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He worked with a few trusted allies, and could be contacted through the [[Green Gauntlet]] inn found in the city. They would either abduct targets for ransom, or smuggle the willing out of certain locations, typically so they could find safety.

==Description==
Despite his distinct pseudonym, Flame was a quiet and rather indistinguishable young man.

==Activities==
Flame and his gang, including some wizards, specialized in hiding or transporting willing people, and kidnapping and ransoming unwilling people. He could be contacted at the [[Green Gauntlet]] in the city docks.

==History==
Before he worked in human trafficking, Flame was an arsonist within his home city. He was stopped by a group of [[cleric]]s and [[mage]]s and struck down with a series of ''[[flame strike]]s'' to convince him of the error of his ways. He set upon a self-imposed exile for some time, before returning to Selgaunt, where he established his more inconspicuous business endeavor.
