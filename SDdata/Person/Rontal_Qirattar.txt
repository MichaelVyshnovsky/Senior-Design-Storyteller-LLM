'''Rontal Qirattar''' was a male [[human]] [[cleric]] of [[Deneir]]. He was the [[farsann]] of Lady [[Kyrin Hawkwinter]], the countess of [[Calimmon County]] in [[Tethyr]].

Rontal was in charge of planning Lady Kyrin's wedding to [[Garron Ersemm]] in the beginning of the [[1371 DR|Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR]]. However, he secretly wanted Kyrin for himself, believing himself to be the ideal man for her, and plotted the removal of Master Ersemm, so he could try to console and woo her.
