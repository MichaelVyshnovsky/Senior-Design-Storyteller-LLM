Rontal Qirattar was a male human cleric of Deneir. He was the farsann of Lady Kyrin Hawkwinter, the countess of Calimmon County in Tethyr.
Rontal was in charge of planning Lady Kyrins wedding to Garron Ersemm in the beginning of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR. However, he secretly wanted Kyrin for himself, believing himself to be the ideal man for her, and plotted the removal of Master Ersemm, so he could try to console and woo her.
