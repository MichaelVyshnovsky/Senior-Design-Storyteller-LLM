'''Mareeka''' was one of two cooks that worked in the kitchens of the [[Flying Stag]] inn, located in [[Voonlar]], as of the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. She was a rotund woman with a good sense of humor and lived her life joyfully. Her specialty dish was actually a bowl made from a round loaf of bread that was hollowed out and then lined with melted cheese and allowed to harden. The soup of the day was served in these unique bowls whenever she took her shift in the kitchen.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|23}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 17: A Place to Stay}}
