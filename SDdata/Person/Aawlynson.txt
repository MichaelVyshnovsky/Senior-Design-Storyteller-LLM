Aawlynson was one of the bandits under the Iron Fox in the midâ€“8 century DR.
The men of the Iron Fox wore light armor and brought no lances or horses.
When Elminster Aumar, a Chosen of Mystra, carried out a scouring of the bandits in Buckralams Starn, Aawlynson remained with his boss, the Iron Fox, until moments before his death at Fox Tower. They were ambushed at the mess hall, where Elminster struck him down with a crossbow quarrel to the face.
