Raulauvin Oregh was a human cleric of Chauntea in the midâ€“14 century DR.Although statted as "male" and given masculine titles in Forgotten Realms Adventures and A Grand Tour of the Realms, the latter source refers to Raulauvin as "her", possibly in error or a retcon. Without more information, this article uses the literal interpretation. It is noted the church of Chauntea also has feminine titles like Harvestmistress. Raulauvin was one of the most favored servants of Chauntea in the Realms.
By 1358 DR and through 1367 DR, she was the High Priest and Harvestmaster of the High Harvest Home temple in Elturel, overseeing eighteen priests and forty-two followers.
