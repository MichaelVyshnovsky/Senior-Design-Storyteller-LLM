'''Taffy'''  was a brutish guard, and a member of the [[Mariners' Alliance]] allied with [[Zhentarim]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Taffy was a hulking muscular man with a vacant expression on his face.

==History==
In 1372 DR, Taffy was standing guard in the Mariners' Alliance's guildhall, in front of the door to the building's sub-basement. He was tasked with stopping anyone from snooping inside the building and keeping unwanted individuals away from the sub-basement where the members of the guild were planning their operations, secretly working alongside Zhent agents against Daggerford well-being.

When the investigation into the plots against the city brought adventurers later known as heroes of Daggerford to the Mariners' Alliance, Taffy attempted to stop them from proceeding deeper into the building however, the [[Hero of Daggerford]] managed to get past him. It was unknown if it was done via violence, intimidation, or bluff.
