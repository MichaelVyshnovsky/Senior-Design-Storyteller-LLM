Estera was a reclusive lich who interacted with the realm fo the living via his servant and apprentice Alatian sometime before 1372 DR.
Estera sent Alatian on many quests to aid in the lichs necromancy research, retrieve rare components, and visit numerous graveyards. As a boon of protection and a self-preservation contingency, Estera gifted the Spell Shroud to Alatian. Eventually, the apprentice himself ascended to undeath as a fellow lich.
