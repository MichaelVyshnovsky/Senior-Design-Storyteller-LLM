Diarbekir was a skilled necromancer who inhabited the city of Ysawis before its fall.
The necromancer used his skills to enchant a magical blade for his brother, Kagemni, the first king of Ysawis. This powerful blade was called Drinker of a Thousand Lives.
As fate would have it, Diarbekir was eventually slain by his brother who was under the twisted influence of the very sword he created.
