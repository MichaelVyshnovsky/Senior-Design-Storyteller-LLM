'''Dornig Leiyraghon''' was the Lord of [[House Leiyraghon]] and one of the seven councilors that ruled [[Melvaunt]] in [[1374 DR]].
==History==
Dornig led his house to bring down [[House Marsk]] and [[House Natali]], breaking the stalemate that had frozen the town in previous years. However, instead of claiming dominion over all the city, Dornig proposed a system to nominate a Despot of Melvaunt from the seven great Houses every two years.

In 1374 DR, Dornig's son [[Kalman Leiyraghon]] went on adventures with some friends and disappeared. However, sensing a trap, Lord Leiyraghon would not speak with the adventuring party hired by Lord [[Woarsten Nanther]] to find the noble scions.
However, after the adventuring party came back after defeating the [[orog]] warlord [[Thrull]] inside the [[XÃ»l-Jarak]] citadel in [[Thar]], and rescued the scions, Dornig insisted on hosting a great party to celebrate the heroes.

However, his son Bremen in truth had orchestrated the capture of his brother. He and his friends, together with the surviving orog commander [[Daazlag]], attacked the party. In the fighting Dornig was hit and was on the verge of death.
==Relationship==
Dornig had two sons, the heir [[Bremen Leiyraghon]] and his younger brother Kalman.
