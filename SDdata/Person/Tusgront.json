        "mainbody": "usgront was a member of The Guild from the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nTusgront was a half-orcish sentry and muscle. He was a tall, muscled, imposing figure dressed in barbarian garb dyed emerald green – the color of The Guild, and armed with a greataxe. He had curly chestnut hair gathered in a bun. Tusgront wore a signet ring of The Guild that unlocked the secret passage into the Guildhall.\nIn the , Tusgront was tasked with standing guard of the secret entrance into Baldurs Gates Undercellar where The Guilds Guildhall was hidden. Tusgront appeared intimidating but preferred not to engage in violence when threatened. He harbored disdain for the agents of the Zhentarim who were allied with Nine-Fingers Keene at the time. Tusgront still stood guard, surrounded by a small number of fellow Guildsmen, ready to make holes in any adventurers or journalists trying to sneak in without the Guildmasters approval.\nAround the same time, Tusgront was one of the Guilds muscle named and detailed in a book penned by the Flaming Fists, that compiled the mercenaries investigation and research into Nine-Fingers Keene – Queen of Kingpins. Tusgront was described as being nothing but dim brute by the Fists."
