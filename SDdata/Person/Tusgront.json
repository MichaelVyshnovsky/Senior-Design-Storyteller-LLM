        "mainbody": "'''Tusgront''' was a member of [[The Guild]] from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Shouldn't go wandering in dark alleys. Very dangerous hobby. Gets people killed. Scurry away, gubuk. Before I crush you.''|Tusgront}}",
        "Description": "Tusgront was a [[half-orcish]] sentry and muscle. He was a tall, muscled, imposing figure dressed in [[barbarian]] garb dyed [[emerald]] green – the color of The Guild, and armed with a [[greataxe]]. He had curly chestnut hair gathered in a bun. Tusgront wore a signet ring of The Guild that unlocked the secret passage into the Guildhall.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Tusgront was tasked with standing guard of the secret entrance into Baldur's Gate's [[Undercellar]] where The Guild's Guildhall was hidden. Tusgront appeared intimidating but preferred not to engage in violence when threatened. He harbored disdain for the agents of the [[Zhentarim]] who were allied with [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] at the time. Tusgront still stood guard, surrounded by a small number of fellow Guildsmen, ready to make holes in any adventurers or journalists trying to sneak in without the Guildmaster's approval.\n\nAround the same time, Tusgront was one of the Guild's muscle named and detailed in a book penned by the [[Flaming Fist]]s, that compiled the mercenaries' investigation and research into Nine-Fingers Keene – ''[[Queen of Kingpins]]''. Tusgront was described as being nothing but dim brute by the Fists."
