'''Akongo''' was one of the ''nyama-nummo'', the offspring of the deity [[Olurobo]] in ancient [[Katashaka]].<ref group="note">The ''nyama-nummo'' are named after elements of the [[Wikipedia:Dogon religion|religion of the Dogon people of Mali]], with the concept of ''nyama'' (roughly, human nature) and the [[Wikipedia:Nommo|Nummo]] spirits or deities. However, what they could be in D&D terms and in the Forgotten Realms setting is unknown.

Akongo was known by the ancient [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]] tribe to be a particularly perfidious entity dwelling in the southern highlands. When the [[couatl]] [[Ecatzin]] came to them to preach of [[Ubtao]] some time before {{Yearlink|-2809}}, they were initially resistant, fearing the feathered serpent to be a minion of Akongo.
