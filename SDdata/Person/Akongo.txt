Akongo was one of the nyama-nummo, the offspring of the deity Olurobo in ancient Katashaka.The nyama-nummo are named after elements of the religion of the Dogon people of Mali, with the concept of nyama (roughly, human nature) and the Nummo spirits or deities. However, what they could be in D&D terms and in the Forgotten Realms setting is unknown.
Akongo was known by the ancient Tabaxi tribe to be a particularly perfidious entity dwelling in the southern highlands. When the couatl Ecatzin came to them to preach of Ubtao some time before , they were initially resistant, fearing the feathered serpent to be a minion of Akongo.
