Pickled Pete was an old drunk handyman who worked in region of the Sword Coast North near Phandalin during the late 15 century DR.
He had an awful memory, and legitimately could not remember his own surname.
Pete was a creative individual when it came to his work. He loved finding new ways to solve problems and get the job done.
He loved his ale, and actually seemed to work better when inebriated rather than sober.
Despite his flaws, Pickled Pete was a helpful man, whom his friends could truly rely on.
