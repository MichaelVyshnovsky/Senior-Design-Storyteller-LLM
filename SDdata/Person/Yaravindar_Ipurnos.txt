'''Yaravindar Ipurnos''' was one of the last surviving [[Imaskari]]. He lived within the [[Violet Spire]], in the [[Glittering Spires|Glittering Mountains]], as of {{yearlink|1372}}.{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|56}}

==History==

Yaravindar had extended his lifespan several times over through magic.{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|58}} 

The ancient wizard maintained most of his age-old beliefs about human superiority and still held gods in great contempt. Although he saw nothing wrong with enslavement of other races, he had mostly given up on that because of the hassle in managing them; his slender purple [[granite]] minaret was protected and staffed by a host of summoned [[elemental|elementals]] and surviving Imaskari [[construct|constructs]]. The tower spurned doors, instead employing keyed [[portals]] for access and egress. The artificer richly rewarded [[Tuigan]] nomads who brought ancient Imaskari magic to him.
