        "mainbody": "Fist '''Darbonna''' was a member of the [[Flaming Fist]] and a healer who served the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Look, I really don't care - just get moving.''|Fist Healer Darbonna}}",
        "Description": "Darbonna was a [[human]] woman with tan skin, bluish-green eyes, and shortly-trimmed brown curly hair. She wore a uniform of the Flaming Fist – a set of [[splint mail]] and a [[tabard]] adorned with the Flaming Fist insignia, with a large [[hammer]] strapped to her back.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Darbonna was stationed just outside one of the gates between the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] and its more affluent [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]]. Her and other fellow Fists' job was stopping rabble from entering the Upper City, allowing only those with much [[coin]] through. The Fists managed a slow-moving queue of rich and poor – city folk trying to return home or just find safety behind the second set of walls."
