        "mainbody": "Tooralooralayo was a beggar, or possibly, a refugee, from the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nTooralooralayo was a human woman with a light skin tone, dark brown eyes, and shortly-cropped blonde hair. Her skin was dirty and clothes were humble.\nIn the , Spatula Farggo, a worker from the Elfsong Taverns kitchens, began helping out the beggars in the Lower City, by bringing them kitchen scraps and leftovers to those in need, both locals, and the refugees fleeing fro the armies of the Absolute. Tooralooralayo and her son, Pickles, were among those who happily accepted the scraps. Tooralooralayos boy was happy to have more than one meal a day and the woman herself worked about Spatula Farggo getting in trouble for his sneaky generosity."
