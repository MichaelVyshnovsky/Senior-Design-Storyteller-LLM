In 1372 DR, she became a delegate to Mantol-Derith after assassinating her predecessor, Yyssisiryl Htithet. However, the Siege of Menzoberranzan prevented travel to her home city and for the time, Harammamyl, like Kassawar Plickenstint, had very little to do.\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryRogues\nCategoryDrow\nCategoryMembers of House Htithet\nCategoryInhabitants of Menzoberranzan\nCategoryInhabitants of Mantol-Derith\nCategoryInhabitants of the Northdark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Middledark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\np6pva6tq4gzsnsuplc5j2c0asq29ont"
