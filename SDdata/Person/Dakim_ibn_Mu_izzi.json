        "mainbody": "Dakim ibn Muizzi was a goblin employee of the House of Al-Kamari in Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nThe success of Al-Kamari silk ventures was largely due to Dakims skill and ingenuity. He could fashion 6,000 different colors for dyes, many of which could not be reproduced by others attempting to mimic them.\nDakim researched a project to make a bedsheet for the Grand Caliph from giant spider silk.\nHe was trusted to make most business decisions for the merchant family and often inspected their factories and those of their competitors.\nDakim began his relationship with the House of Al-Kamari as a slave. Though technically still owned by Al-Kamari, his skills proved his worth to them a thousand times over, earning him a level of comfort far beyond even the most highest prized slaves."
