'''Dagsumn''' ({{Pronounce|DAG|ah|summ|refs=}}) was a [[wizard]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Personality==
Dagsumn was friendly and could be relied onto honor an agreement, but he had a hunger for new magic and was fastidious with regard to details. He preferred to work in the [[City of the Dead (Waterdeep)|City of the Dead]], far from the risk that someone might discover his secrets. When Dagsumm found about new magic items, he could become very irritating, asking very insistently for details.

==Activities==
Outside of his experiments in the City of the Dead, Dagsumm passed his time at the [[Elfsong Tavern]], near to the house he shared with his wife.

==History==
Dagsumn hailed from [[Port Llast]] and was tutored in the magical arts by [[Malchor Harpell]] at the [[Tower of Twilight]]. His apprenticeship with Malchor ended peacefully around the 1320s [[DR]], but they had not spoken to each other since. Afterward, he came to live in Waterdeep, where he met his wife [[Kyrss Wands]] of the [[Wands]] family.
