        "mainbody": "Shadowfang was a shadowslain fang dragon involved in the Zhent invasion of Shadowdale in 1375 DR.\nIn 1373 DR, Shadowfang approached the church of Shar in the hopes of using Shadow Weave magic to avoid the Rage of Dragons. However, a Rage-induced madness caused him to attack some devils in Myth Drannor, resulting in his death.\nEsvele Greycastle retrieved the corpse and had him raised as a shadowslain undead. In 1375 DR, she gave Shadowfang to the Matron Sisters of House Dhuurniv to cement their alliance with the Sharrans. The drow initially thought the dragon too subservient to Shar but soon understood that he was a free agent and collaborated with him."
