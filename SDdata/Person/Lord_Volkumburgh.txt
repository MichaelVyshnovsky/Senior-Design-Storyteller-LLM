'''Lord Volkumburgh''' was a [[Cormyr]]ian noble in the 11{{th}} to 12{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[999 DR]], Lord Volkumburgh acquired a villa within the [[Thunder Peaks]] in a valley that would come to be known as [[Volkumburgh Vale]]. In the mid-12{{th}} century DR,{{ShatteredStatue-pasttime}} a unique [[stone golem]] known as [[Awtawmatawn]] rampaged throughout the valley. Before it could sack his home, the lord hid his treasure in a secret cavern underneath it.

Inevitably, the Awtawmatawn came through and sacked his villa.

Later on, some man would approach Lord Volkumburgh with one of the hands of the Awtawmatawn and task him with hiding it. He went on to hide it beneath the village's fountain and both this, as well as his hidden treasure, would continue to be spoken of as local legends in Volkumburgh well into [[1358 DR]].{{ShatteredStatue-Time}}
