'''Solom Ned'razak''' ({{Pronounce|SOHL|um|_|NED|rizz|ack|refs={{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|70}}}}) was a [[drow]] [[wizard]] who was the [[Archmage]] of [[Szith Morcane]] and head of the [[Inverted Tower]] in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Description==
Solom was a middle-aged drow with a fine fashion sense and an air of hedonism. He was ruggedly handsome, though not especially muscular, and wore a [[gold]] hoop in his left ear. His garb consisted of black [[trousers]] tucked into knee-high black leather boots, and a billowing purple shirt unbuttoned halfway down. A fine gold headband (a ''[[headband of intellect]]'') held his long white hair back from his face, and the sleeves of his shirt were tucked into elaborate gold bracers (''[[bracers of armor]]'') A fine black [[cloak]] (a ''[[cloak of charisma]]'') completed the ensemble. He smelt of [[perfume]] and [[incense]].

==Personality==
Ambitious and rebellious, even amid the matriarchal drow of Szith Morcane, Solom had long defied any dilution of his dominance over the Inverted Tower. When speaking with others, he would prefer to deal them from atop his ornate throne, where his authority was made most apparent. The archamge's aim was to one day turn Szith Morcane into a [[magocracy]], like [[Sshamath]], with himself as its undisputed ruler.{{Cite adventurers league/It's All in the Blood|25}}

==History==
During the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372 DR]], Solom Ned'razak witnessed the overthrow of the ruling [[cleric]]s of [[Lolth]] by the [[Church of Kiaransalee]]. He took a neutral stance in the coup, siding with whichever side won out.

After adventurers sent by [[Randal Morn]] from [[Daggerdale]] ended the plots of the Church of Kiaransalee in Szith Morcane, Solom decided to set out plans for a permanent magical barrier and cut off his newly acquired outpost from the surface world.

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], the [[fire giant]]s of [[Maerimydra]] started a war against Szith Morcane, so Solom started working with the alchemist [[Xaven Tanor'this]] to create a means to purge the giants of the [[demon]]ic blood that powered them. However, before Xaven could complete the research, Szith Morcane fell to the giants and Xaven was captured.{{Cite adventurers league/It's All in the Blood|5}} Later, a fire giant army led by [[Hledh Hellspawn]] attacked Szith Morcane, destroying and occupying much of the city.{{Cite adventurers league/The Occupation of Szith Morcane|5}} In the end, Solom himself was captured by the fire giant lieutenant [[Fydor]] but soon after was freed by an adventuring party hired by [[Elanil Elassidil]]. He decided to break the magical barrier and briefly retreated from Szith Morcane.{{Cite adventurers league/The Occupation of Szith Morcane|20-21}}

Some time after, Solom Ned'razak retreated to the [[myconid]] community of [[Sporedome]] and found that Xaven had been sold to the [[yugoloth]] [[Maram il Vass]] and hired an adventuring party to find and free him.{{Cite adventurers league/It's All in the Blood|23}} and took him to Sporedome to meet with Solom.{{Cite adventurers league/It's All in the Blood|24}} Afterward, Solom sent the adventurers to Maerimydra to obtain some samples of fiendish blood to complete the experiment.{{Cite adventurers league/It's All in the Blood|37}}

Later, while Solom was leading the [[Drow Resistance]], the mad drow [[Quil'bryn]] seemed to have killed him.{{Cite adventurers league/Szith Morcane Unbound|14}} In truth, Solom recreated his body inside the Inverted Tower.{{Cite adventurers league/Szith Morcane Unbound|18-19}}

After the successful liberation of Szith Morcane, Solom journeyed to [[Sporedome]] so he could join the assault on Maerimydra.{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|11}}

During the combined attack on Maerimydra, [[Dorina T'sarran]] captured Solom and took him to the [[Shattered Tower]]. There, the drow priestess manipulated the vengeful [[silveraith]]s into draining his soul.{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|32}}
