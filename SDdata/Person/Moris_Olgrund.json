        "mainbody": "'''Moris Olgrund''' was the Funeral Director and mortician of [[Daggerford Graveyard]] in the [[Eastern Farmlands]] of the city of [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].\n{{quote|''It's a strange occupation, I'll grant you. But I actually enjoy caring for the dead. They're so predictable and hence so dependable! All the stress of my job comes from dealing with the living. When I tell the poor family what has happened, they'll never forgive me...''|Moris Olgrund}}",
        "Description": "Moris was a pale and gaunt [[half-elf]] with sharp features and long black hair.",
        "Personality": "Diligent and perfectionist by nature, Moris could get extremely stressed by certain events, like missing corpses. His body language portrayed severe agitation, and he perspired excessively when stressed and wrung his hands.\n\nMoris Olgrund was a devoted follower of Lord [[Kelemvor]] and he despised the [[undead]].",
        "Possessions": "Moris Olgrund kept detailed records of the funerals in his ledger, a logbook embossed with gold letters.\n\nThe mortician was stocked up on ''[[holy water]]'' if he ended up needing to destroy undead and send their spirits to Kelemvor's realm.",
        "History": "The Olgrunds had been in the family business of caring for the dead of Daggerford for several generations. Moris's entire life was spent perfecting that vocation. The family reputation was spotless.\n\nIn 1372 DR, Moris Olgrund embalmed and interred [[Elveronne Bricket|Old Man Bricket]] on the behest of his sister [[Muriel Bricket]] in the Bricket family crypt for the sum of five hundred [[gold]] [[coin]]s. Soon after the interring ceremony, however, the corpse went missing. This incident pushed poor Moris into a panic. He was terrified of all of Daggerford finding out about his failure, especially the man's kindly sisters. They'd be heartbroken! Serendipitously, the [[Hero of Daggerford]] volunteered to help the panicked mortician. Moris was unable to leave his duties to go gallivanting across the fields in search of Elveronne Bricket's cadaver. The mortician suspected vile [[necromancy]] was at work and asked the Hero to destroy the undead abomination if indeed Elveronne rose as a shambling dead.\n\nMoris told the Hero that Old Man Bricket died due to spontaneous and severe food poisoning as per the coroner and the man's sisters who witnessed the distressing ordeal. They blamed bad [[salmon]]. Subsequently, the Hero of Daggerford discovered the truth behind the walking dead. He was raised from the dead by the theft of his precious ''[[elven keepsake necklace]]'' by his sister [[Alicine Bricket]]. Eventually, the Hero managed to return the undead Old Man Bricket to the grave, however the accounts of the events varied, with some saying the zombie was doused with ''holy water'' and destroyed, others whispered the story of the Hero allowing the undead to exact revenge on his murderous sisters, and others simply claimed that the Hero negotiated the keepsake's return."
