        "mainbody": "oris Olgrund was the Funeral Director and mortician of Daggerford Graveyard in the Eastern Farmlands of the city of Daggerford circa 1372 DR.\nMoris was a pale and gaunt half-elf with sharp features and long black hair.\nDiligent and perfectionist by nature, Moris could get extremely stressed by certain events, like missing corpses. His body language portrayed severe agitation, and he perspired excessively when stressed and wrung his hands.\nMoris Olgrund was a devoted follower of Lord Kelemvor and he despised the undead.\nMoris Olgrund kept detailed records of the funerals in his ledger, a logbook embossed with gold letters.\nThe mortician was stocked up on holy water if he ended up needing to destroy undead and send their spirits to Kelemvors realm.\nThe Olgrunds had been in the family business of caring for the dead of Daggerford for several generations. Moriss entire life was spent perfecting that vocation. The family reputation was spotless.\nIn 1372 DR, Moris Olgrund embalmed and interred Old Man Bricket on the behest of his sister Muriel Bricket in the Bricket family crypt for the sum of five hundred gold coins. Soon after the interring ceremony, however, the corpse went missing. This incident pushed poor Moris into a panic. He was terrified of all of Daggerford finding out about his failure, especially the mans kindly sisters. Theyd be heartbroken! Serendipitously, the Hero of Daggerford volunteered to help the panicked mortician. Moris was unable to leave his duties to go gallivanting across the fields in search of Elveronne Brickets cadaver. The mortician suspected vile necromancy was at work and asked the Hero to destroy the undead abomination if indeed Elveronne rose as a shambling dead.\nMoris told the Hero that Old Man Bricket died due to spontaneous and severe food poisoning as per the coroner and the mans sisters who witnessed the distressing ordeal. They blamed bad salmon. Subsequently, the Hero of Daggerford discovered the truth behind the walking dead. He was raised from the dead by the theft of his precious elven keepsake necklace by his sister Alicine Bricket. Eventually, the Hero managed to return the undead Old Man Bricket to the grave, however the accounts of the events varied, with some saying the zombie was doused with holy water and destroyed, others whispered the story of the Hero allowing the undead to exact revenge on his murderous sisters, and others simply claimed that the Hero negotiated the keepsakes return."
