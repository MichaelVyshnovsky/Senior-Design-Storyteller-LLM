'''Intulik of the Blood''' was an ambitious and ruthless [[witch doctor]] and a politician from [[Chult]], active before [[1372 DR]].

==Possessions==
Intulik used his magical abilities to fuse the [[spirit]]s of seventeen [[tiger]]s and imbue them into a [[helmet]], which he would later name the ''[[Spirit of the Predator]]''.

==History==
Intulik of the Blood used his magics and political prowess to gain power sometime before 1372 DR. He crafted an [[enchanted]] helmet, the ''Spirit of the Predator'' which he subsequently used to dispose of political opposition. Eventually, Intulik of the Blood rose to power over non-[[Mezro]]an [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] tribes. However, the subjection was short-lived. Intulik's career was ended via the sword of a bounty hunter called [[Tatchalik]] who claimed the ''Spirit of the Predator'' and left Chult for [[Waterdeep]].
