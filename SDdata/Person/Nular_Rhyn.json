        "mainbody": "'''Nular Rhyn''' was a [[Thayan knight]] who served his homeland of [[Thay]] as the personal bodyguard of [[khazark]] [[Chathin Zurn]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was extremely loyal to khazark Zurn and the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]], and demonstrated his devotion to their cause time and again. He was ready to kill or be killed in the name of the Red Wizards.",
        "Description": "Though he was on the smaller side, Nular possessed an intimidating appearance. His muscular physique was decorated with the same traditional Thayan tattoos that adorned his entire face.",
        "History": "Born to a noble family within Thay, Nular displayed no aptitude for [[magic]] in his youth. He was, however, rather skilled with the sword. Using his natural gifts, and honing those which he would need to excel, Nular sought out knighthood as a means to best serve the Red Wizards and his homeland."
