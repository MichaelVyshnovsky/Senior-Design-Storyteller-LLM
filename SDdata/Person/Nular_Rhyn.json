        "mainbody": "Nular Rhyn was a Thayan knight who served his homeland of Thay as the personal bodyguard of khazark Chathin Zurn during the late 14 century DR. He was extremely loyal to khazark Zurn and the Red Wizards, and demonstrated his devotion to their cause time and again. He was ready to kill or be killed in the name of the Red Wizards. \nThough he was on the smaller side, Nular possessed an intimidating appearance. His muscular physique was decorated with the same traditional Thayan tattoos that adorned his entire face.\nBorn to a noble family within Thay, Nular displayed no aptitude for magic in his youth. He was, however, rather skilled with the sword. Using his natural gifts, and honing those which he would need to excel, Nular sought out knighthood as a means to best serve the Red Wizards and his homeland."
