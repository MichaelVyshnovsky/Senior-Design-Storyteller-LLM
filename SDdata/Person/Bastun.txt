'''Bastun''' was a [[Vremyonni]] wizard of [[Rashemen]].

==Appearance==
Bastun wore a dark mask of wood inlaid with silver whorls and tiny designs resembling thorny vines that covered his face from forehead to jawline. He wore robes.

==Equipment==
Bastun's mask was enchanted to enhance his hearing.

==Family==
[[Ulsera]] was Bastun's sister.

==History==
Bastun was taught and inducted into the brotherhood of the [[vremyonni]] by [[Keffrass]] shortly after being suspected of tempting his sister to enter the [[Urlingwood]], which was a capital offense in Rashemen. Bastun studied under Keffrass, who awakened a love of knowledge in him. He was later suspected in the murder of Keffrass and was given the choice of exile or death; he chose exile and, in doing so, found out who was responsible for his master's death.
