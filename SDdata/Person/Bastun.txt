Bastun was a Vremyonni wizard of Rashemen.
Bastun wore a dark mask of wood inlaid with silver whorls and tiny designs resembling thorny vines that covered his face from forehead to jawline. He wore robes.
Bastuns mask was enchanted to enhance his hearing.
Ulsera was Bastuns sister.
Bastun was taught and inducted into the brotherhood of the vremyonni by Keffrass shortly after being suspected of tempting his sister to enter the Urlingwood, which was a capital offense in Rashemen. Bastun studied under Keffrass, who awakened a love of knowledge in him. He was later suspected in the murder of Keffrass and was given the choice of exile or death he chose exile and, in doing so, found out who was responsible for his masters death.
