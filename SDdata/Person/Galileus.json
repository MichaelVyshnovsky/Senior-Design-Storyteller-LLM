        "Description": "As could be expected, Galileus spoke in generalities and offered vague predictions to those who asked. He often got a crick in his neck from starting up at the skies for so long.",
        "Activities": "Galileus spent his time studying heavenly bodies, gathering raw data from their positions, and making predictions based on that information.",
        "History": "At some point in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, he was seen passing by the town of [[Beregost]]."
