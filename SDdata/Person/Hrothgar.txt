Hrothgar was a human adventurer from Easthaven within the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale.
The soldier was a powerfully built man who wore heavy armor, like plate mail.
Hrothgar spent many years traveling and collecting trophies from legendary beasts, such as a gorgon and a mind flayer. He was known for helping anyone in need and had found a strong place in the community of Easthaven.
In Eleint, 1281 DR, Hrothgar put together an expedition to travel to the aid of Kuldahar in the Spine of the World.
Hrothgar was killed when the expedition was attacked by frost giants in Kuldahar Pass.
