'''Emberosa''' was a [[fire giant]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime prior to 1492 DR,{{Waterdeep-time}} Emberosa and her six [[fire giant]] kin came to [[Arcturiadoom]] on a mission to dethrone the [[storm giant]]s of [[Faer√ªn]] within the [[giant]]s' [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]]. They originally sought an ancient ''[[rune]] of power'' created some 40,000 years before the [[Second Sundering]], which they believed was stolen by dwarves and taken to their domain beneath [[Mount Waterdeep]].

However, it was [[Halaster Blackcloak]] who possessed the rune and he agreed to give it to Emberosa in exchange for her services using their exceptional metal-forging abilities to build a giant [[construct]] for him.

==Activities==
Within the central hall of Arcturiadoom, the fire giants gathered scrap metal from [[Trobriand's Graveyard]] and began construction on an enormous magical [[iron]] automaton called [[Mecha-Halaster]]. This 100-foot (30.5-meter) tall machine was the near-exact duplicate of Halaster himself, though by 1492 DR, it was still incomplete. The Mad Mage intended to use this colossus to combat the [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep|Walking Statues]] of [[Waterdeep]] when the time arrived to conquer the surface city. Emberosa supervised the project.

==Personality==
Emberosa was a very irritable individual.

==Relationship==
During their excursion into Undermountain, Emberosa and her fire giants were accompanied by the [[Death's Head Phalanx]] band of [[hobgoblin]]s, led by the Warlord known as [[Doomcrown]]. She had always at her side her three [[smoke mephit]] assistants.
