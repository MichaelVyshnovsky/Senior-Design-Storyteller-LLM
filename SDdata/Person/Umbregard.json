Their conversation grew long, and was only interrupted by the elf receiving notice that flame was wielded in a distant forest, near what was the Dead Place they crossed a portal to reach it.\nAcross the ocean, they fought a number of Sharran Dreadspells they only prevailed because of the intrusion of his foe of many years, Tenthar Taerhamoos. Starsunder was badly injured during the fight, and in the aftermath, Tenthar helped heal him."
