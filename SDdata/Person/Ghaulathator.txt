'''Ghaulathator''', also known as '''Wintercloak''', was an ancient [[white dragon]] slain in the time of [[Netheril]].

==History==
In [[-433 DR|3426 NY (−433 DR)]], Wintercloak flew under the floating city of [[Lathery]], over the [[Narrow Sea]] in Netheril, and was [[teleport]]ed into one of the city's cold storage chambers, as part of its fishing system. Wintercloak tore himself free and broke out into the city streets, and there was confronted by [[Veridon]] and the city's [[arcanist]]s. Wintercloak slayed Veridon and a dozen arcanists with its icy breath, but was slain by the survivors.''[[Dragons of Faerun]]'''s Roll Call of Dragons gives the name "Ghaulathator" to the dragon previously known as "Wintercloak". However, it lists his lair as [[Lachery]], but ''[[Netheril: Empire of Magic]]'' makes it clear he only visited and died there.
