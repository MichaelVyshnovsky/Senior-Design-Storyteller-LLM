        "mainbody": "'''Ashok''' was a [[Shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] from  the [[Shadowfell]]. Formerly a member of a small shadar-kai enclave, he later resided in [[Ikemmu]], where he was considered a champion of the [[deity|god]] [[Tempus]].",
        "History": "Ashok was raised in a shadar-kai enclave located in a series of large caves north of the city of [[Ikemmu]]. Ashok's father was the enclave's leader and he encouraged his sons to fight each other. Ashok's childhood was hardly idyllic as he had to constantly fight his brothers for standing within the clan. As a young man, he gained his father's approval by killing a brother in self-defense in front of his father.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], the shadar-kai of Ikemmu sent a scouting party led by the witch [[Ilvani]] to investigate the area near Ashok's enclave. At the same time, Ashok's father became concerned about a pack of [[shadow hound]]s near the enclave and he sent Ashok to eliminate the pack.\n\nAshok killed the pack but was gravely wounded. He was found by a group of shadar-kai from Ikemmu, who took him back to the city. The shadar-kai healed Ashok's wounds and he was given permission to roam the city, though he was always watched. [[Uwan]], the leader of Ikemmu, believed Ashok could be useful to the city and encouraged Ashok to train with the city's warriors. Ashok was allowed to attempt to tame a [[nightmare]] that had been captured by the Ikemmu shadar-kai and was successful enough that he was able to ride the creature as a steed.\n\nAshok was sent on an expedition led by [[Vedoran]] to rescue Ilvani's party from the shadar-kai enclave. Ashok used his knowledge of his clan's caves to lead the group through the complex to free Ilvani, but the other members of Ilvani's group were already dead. During the rescue attempt, Ashok's nightmare came to his aid, slaughtering many shadar-kai.\n\nVedoran suspected that the enclave was Ashok's home and conspired with a [[cleric|priest]] of [[Beshaba]] to frame Ashok as a traitor to Ikemmu. Uwan found Ashok guilty and sentenced him to ten days of solitary confinement, a sentence that could be fatal to shadar-kai, who required constant sensory stimulus to avoid fading to oblivion. During Ashok's confinement, Vedoran attempted to kill Ashok in his cell but was stopped by Uwan, although Uwan was seriously injured. Vedoran was killed by Ashok during the fight.\n\nin [[1480 DR]], Ashok traveled with a caravan from Ikemmu to [[Rashemen]] to discover the source of the spirits that were plaguing Ilvani. Along the road, he helped battle bandits, [[troll]]s, and [[winter wolf|winter wolves]]. When the group arrived in Rashemen, he helped Ilvani defeat the [[Witches of Rashemen|Wychlaran]] [[Sree]], which put an end to Ilvani's hauntings.{{Cite digital book/The Darker Road}}",
        "Relationships": "Ashok was a close friend of [[Cree]] and [[Skagi]] and was a friend of [[Chanoch]] prior to his execution. Because of his martial prowess and because he was named chosen of Tempus, Uwan respected Ashok, but Ashok didn't fully trust Uwan.",
        "Equipment": "Ashok carried a [[chain]] and a [[dagger]] and wore bone armor. He had an uneasy alliance with a nightmare, who at times allowed Ashok to ride him."
