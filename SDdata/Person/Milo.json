        "mainbody": "ilo was a new recruit of the Shadow Thieves who resided in the stronghold within Undermountain in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nSometime in early 1370 DR, Shadow Thieves guild regained pretense in Waterdeep via a hidden stronghold in the top levels of Undermountain. The guilds activities included recruitment, and Milo was one of the young halflings that joined. Missing a cold personality and assassin skills, he was stationed to work in the hideouts kitchen, where he proved himself adequate in cooking the Undermountains easiest meat - rats, both average and giant. Rat stew was his speciality.\nWhen the guilds pretense was discovered by Khelben Arunsun, he sent a lone hero he recently recruited as his agent to Waterdeeps mega-dungeon. The adventurer discovered the strongholds location and eventually infiltrated the thieves lair, slaying the Guild Master. Being not much of a fighter, Milo pleaded for his life and offered the lone hero his rat stew and free passage in exchange for his life."
