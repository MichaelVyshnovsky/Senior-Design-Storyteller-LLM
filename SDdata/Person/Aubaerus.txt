}}'''Aubaerus''' ({{Pronounce|AW|bear|us|refs=}}) was a [[hierophant]] [[druid]] in the [[Thunder Peaks]] area in [[1357 DR]].
==History==
Aubaerus had gained rich treasures from his druid teachings over the years.

==Activities==
Aubaerus usually remained in the form of a giant [[raven]] flying over the [[Dragon Reach]] area. Sometime he agreed to train novice druids but always driving a hard bargain for payment, in order to discourage them.

==Personality==
Aubaerus was a gruff man, disliking human company but agreeing to meet fellow druids or [[elves]]. However, he enjoyed the company of ravens.
