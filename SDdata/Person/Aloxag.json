        "mainbody": "'''Aloxag''' was the trusted bodyguard [[spectator]] who served [[Ibbalar Thrul]] in his [[Undermountain]] lair in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Ibbalar Thrul constructed a magical apparatus that was powered by a rare enchanted ''[[Kossuth ruby]]''. Using the magical portal pool, Ibbalar called forth a small army of spectators and sent them into [[Waterdeep]] to \"guard\" powerful magical items, such as [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]]'s enchanted sword. The floating aberrations created chaos in the city, and [[Khelben Arunsun]] sent his trusted agent into the mega-dungeon underneath the [[Yawning Portal]] to find and stop the nuisance invasion. That [[Khelbenite]] managed to infiltrate the mad [[wizard]]'s lair and confronted what he thought to be Ibbalar Thrul himself. In reality, Aloxag took the wizard's place, allowing him to escape the punishment from the [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. Aloxag was slain in the process."
