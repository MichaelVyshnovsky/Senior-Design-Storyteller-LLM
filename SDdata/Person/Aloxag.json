Using the magical portal pool, Ibbalar called forth a small army of spectators and sent them into Waterdeep to \"guard\" powerful magical items, such as Piergeiron the Paladinsons enchanted sword. The floating aberrations created chaos in the city, and Khelben Arunsun sent his trusted agent into the mega-dungeon underneath the Yawning Portal to find and stop the nuisance invasion. That Khelbenite managed to infiltrate the mad wizards lair and confronted what he thought to be Ibbalar Thrul himself. In reality, Aloxag took the wizards place, allowing him to escape the punishment from the Lords of Waterdeep. Aloxag was slain in the process."
