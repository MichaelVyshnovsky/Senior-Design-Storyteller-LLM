'''Dakim ibn Mu'izzi''' was a [[goblin]] employee of the [[House of Al-Kamari]] in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
The success of Al-Kamari silk ventures was largely due to Dakim's skill and ingenuity. He could fashion 6,000 different colors for [[dye]]s, many of which could not be reproduced by others attempting to mimic them.

Dakim researched a project to make a bedsheet for the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] from [[giant spider]] [[spider silk|silk]].

He was trusted to make most business decisions for the merchant family and often inspected their factories and those of their competitors.

==History==
Dakim began his relationship with the House of Al-Kamari as a slave. Though technically still owned by Al-Kamari, his skills proved his worth to them a thousand times over, earning him a level of comfort far beyond even the most highest prized slaves.
