'''Kumed Hahpret''' replaced the murdered [[Aznar Thrul]] by [[1385 DR]] as [[zulkir]] of [[Evocation]].

==Importance==
Kumed supported the council of zulkirs in their war against the [[lich]] [[Szass Tam]], who proclaimed himself regent of all Thay.

He was supposedly killed by [[Nevron]] in [[1385 DR]] before all remaining zulkirs left [[Bezantur]] in flight of Szass Tam's [[undead]] forces.
