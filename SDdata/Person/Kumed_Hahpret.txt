Kumed Hahpret replaced the murdered Aznar Thrul by 1385 DR as zulkir of Evocation.
Kumed supported the council of zulkirs in their war against the lich Szass Tam, who proclaimed himself regent of all Thay.
He was supposedly killed by Nevron in 1385 DR before all remaining zulkirs left Bezantur in flight of Szass Tams undead forces.
