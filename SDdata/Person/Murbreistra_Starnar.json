        "mainbody": "'''Murbreistra Starnar''' was a renegade [[sorceress]] of [[Halruaa]] based in [[Phelzol]] in [[Semphar]] in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the sister of [[Halatha Starnar]].",
        "Activities": "Murbreistra, together with her sister Halatha, was a wicked mage who enjoyed breeding monsters, leading to the creation of many bizarre creatures and even [[mongrelmen]]. This practice attracted many enemies and thieves, particularly old foes from Halruaa. For impulsive young Halruaan mages looking to prove their might, flying [[Halruaan skyship|skyships]] overhead at night and dropping in on [[rope]]s to try to raid their walled estate turned into popular recreational sport. When the Starnars used [[spell]]s to [[teleport]] a number of [[crimson death]]s into the gardens whenever they wished, this sport quickly died out.The phrasing \"has since ended\" in ''Prayers from the Faithful'' suggests the Starnar sisters were still alive as of the book's setting date, [[1368 DR]].",
        "Relations": "The sisters seem to have had as a minion, willingly or unwilling, an unnamed [[dwarf]] who was never seen without two [[raven]]s perched on each shoulder whom he apparently communicated with and even obeyed.",
        "Home": "Murbreistra and Halatha dwelled within a sprawling mansion of countless rooms and porches connected by [[Wikipedia:breezeway|breezeway]] passages and doors opening into the mossy-rock garden. The whole estate was surrounded by a high wall.",
        "History": "After the {{YearlinkName|1231}}, an [[adventuring company]] known as the [[Talons of Timindar]] went to [[Kh√¥ltar]] in the [[Shaar]], where they sold ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'' for 90,000 [[gp]] and a pair of ''[[slippers of spider climbing]]'' to a strange dwarf who didn't give them his name. This was likely the agent of the Starnar sisters.\n\nDuring one of the earliest raids on the Starnar estate, in the {{YearlinkName|1244}}, a local thief, [[Andaren Robyth]], used the spell-battle as a cover to scale the wall and infiltrate the house. Amidst lightning bolts, fiery blasts, conjured jaws, and transforming spells, he got away with a sackful of [[magical item]]s from the sisters, including the ''Companion''. But he did not escape unscathed: a partly polymorphed reptilian left arm made him an outcast."
