'''Thukmuul Teleshann''' was a [[magister]] of [[Mystra]] at the [[Tower of Balance]] in [[Silverymoon]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1366 DR]], Thukmuul ended one of his religious services by announcing [[Eriladar Leafsigil]] as his successor before leaving the Tower. He was seen quickly pacing towards the [[Moonbridge]], before eventually disappearing in a flash of emerald colored light once he reached its highest point. Some noted that his manner of disappearance was similar to that of the [[High Mage of Silverymoon|High Mage]] [[Orjalun]].

In the years that followed some attempted to inquire with Mystra about Thukmuul's whereabouts or activities, but such efforts proved fruitless.
