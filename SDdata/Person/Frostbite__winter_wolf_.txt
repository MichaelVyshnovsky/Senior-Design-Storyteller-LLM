'''Frostbite''' was a [[Cyricist]] [[winter wolf]] involved in the [[Zhent]] invasion of [[Shadowdale]] in [[1375 DR]].

==History==
Frostbite was recruited by [[Cyric]] in [[1368 DR]] when he was part of the monster's army that assaulted [[Zhentil Keep]] at the god's will; he continued to work with the [[Church of Cyric]] even after; in 1375 DR the high members of the church of Cyric send Frostbite to Shadowdale to observe and eventually gained power by the Zhent occupation of the dale.
Arrived in the dale Frostbite quickly gained control of the [[Moonshadow Pack]], a pack of wolves; Frostbite wanted kill many [[Bane|Banite]] as possible but they appeared too strong for now. frostbite tried to ruin the alliance between Zhent, [[Church of Shar]] and [[drow]] of [[House Dhuurniv]] but meantime hunted the druids of the [[Circle of Shadowdale]].
