Ghennitiroth Tlabbar was the drow matron mother of House Faen Tlabbar the fourth house of Menzoberranzan.
Unlike most drow, Ghenni was a tall and very slim. She had snow white hair and ebon skin.
Ghennitiroth was one of the most devoted followers of Lolth in Menzoberranzan.
In battle, Ghennitiroth used a dagger called Scrag-tooth, which was taken by Kyorl Odran upon her death. Within the Faen Tlabbar compound, Ghenni used a platinum sacrificial platter known as the Faen Tlabbar communing plate.
In 1358 DR, Ghenni prayed to Lolth to protect her house from the advances of House Oblodra
Near the end of the Time of Troubles, Kyorl Odran entered the chapel of House Faen Tlabbar and used psychic energy to rip the heart from Ghennitiroth and placed it on the sacred plate. At her death, Ghennitiroth was over 640 years old.
