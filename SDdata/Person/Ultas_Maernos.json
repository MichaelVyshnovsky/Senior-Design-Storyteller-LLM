        "mainbody": "Lord '''Ultas Maernos''' was a human fighter and, in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, was head of the [[Maernos]] noble family in [[Waterdeep]].",
        "History": "In his youth, Ultas was a mercenary and committed numerous atrocities against southern villages in order to make money for his family. He took up the lordship in Waterdeep, abandoning his past life, but was consumed by guilt, which caused him nightmares.\n\nHe had a wife and several children, but they all died in the plague in [[Amn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1345}}, leaving him with no heirs. After this, Ultas became a recluse and saw few people, save for the High Priestess of [[Selûne]], [[Naneatha Suaril]], who helped him recover from his grief and encouraged him to take up religion, worshiping Selûne in particular. During this time he began donating generously to several Waterdhavian temples.\n\nUltas refused to marry again after the death of his wife, and had no children and therefore no heirs. He was permitted, upon his death, to donate his fortunes to the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] who spread them equally amongst the ten major temples and the [[Plinth]]. The Maernos family home was converted to a place of refuge and worship for non-human inhabitants of Waterdeep called [[Holyhands House]]. He began this conversion himself before his death, purchasing art such as paintings and statues appropriate for non-human races.\n\nLady [[Tresh Lanngolyn]] was one of the Waterdhavian nobles adamantly opposed to accepting non-humans into polite society and, in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, schemed to derail his plans. She took in a young man named Morrisan who had just arrived from Amn (where Ultas' wife and children perished) bearing a striking resemblance to the Maernos patriarch and planned to groom him and present him as Ultas' long lost son. However, her attempt at manipulating Lord Ultas ultimately failed.{{Cite dragon/211/\"I Sing a Song by the Deep-Water Bay\"|34}}"
