Mendolin Nightweaver was an elvish specialty priest of Mystra in the mid–14 century DR.
Mendolin was not a confident man and he had not reached his full potential as a cleric.
The elf wore a set of mundane splint armor and carried a shield. He was armed with an enchanted +1 silver dagger.
In the mid–14 century DR, Mendolin Nightweaver sought to establish a temple to Mystra in the city of Loudwater in the Savage Frontier.
