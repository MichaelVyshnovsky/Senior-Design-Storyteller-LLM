        "mainbody": "mril Zoar was a murderer and a descendant of the Zoar family in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nPer Piergeiron Paladinson, who mind-touched him, he was young and full of excitement.\nHe had an enchanted sword. He had also acquired numerous Harper pins on which hed layered no end of enchantments, and at least one potion of healing, which he kept at his hideout. He also possessed a tome from Ahghairon himself discussing the use of echo gates.\nHis hideout was a place with high, vaulted ceilings, and pillars, with at least one coat of arms, strongly implied to be the home of the Zoar family.\nHis swordcraft was more than a match even for Storm Silverhand, and his sorcery was likewise second to none. He had also become a master of echo gates.\nAn unnamed Harper was his tutor in the Art. He had a network of spies at his service.\nOne day, a knight of Waterdeep slew Zoars father and his tutor in the Art, a Harper whod never given his name, but who died protecting Amril. This event happened at some point after , as he judged it happened during Tamaeril Bladesemmers tenure as a Lord of Waterdeep, which began in that year. In the years since, Zoar came to possess a book written by Ahghairon on the use of echo gates, capable of bypassing most of the wards in Waterdeep.\nOn early Flamerule of the , he resolved to get revenge, and using the echo gates, he ambushed Piergeiron Paladinson, charmed him and extracted from his mind the identities of all the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. He then attacked the open lord, severely wounding him and Tamaeril Bladesemmer, as well as the latters dog and songbird in the same night, leaving a Harper pin on Resengar.\nIn the same night he attempted to ambush Mirt at the Inner Audience Chamber of the palace, following him into the sewers through a secret passage after taking some attacks, he tried to lure him into an exploding portal instead. He then used another gate to rush into the Yawning Portal, where he was fought back into the portal by Tamsil Dryndilstann and Mhaere Dryndilstann before he could reach Durnan, dropping a Harper pin before he left.\nHe was afterwards ambushed by Storm Silverhand, who used a special spell to teleport herself to any Harper pin that had been tampered with in Waterdeep. They were soon joined by Elminster, Piergeiron Paladinson, Asper, and Mirt, and they swiftly defeated and immobilized Amril Zoar, who confessed to his plan afterwards. Before they could kill him, Storm pleaded for them to have mercy on him as he was worthy of becoming a Harper, and swore that she would kill him herself if he returned to his murderous ways."
