        "mainbody": "'''Amril Zoar''' was a murderer and a descendant of the [[Zoar]] family in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Per [[Piergeiron Paladinson]], who mind-touched him, he was young and full of excitement.",
        "Possessions": "He had an enchanted sword. He had also acquired numerous ''[[Harper pin]]s'' on which he'd layered no end of enchantments, and at least one ''[[potion of healing]]'', which he kept at his hideout. He also possessed a tome from [[Ahghairon]] himself discussing the use of [[echo gate]]s.\n\nHis hideout was a place with high, vaulted ceilings, and pillars, with at least one coat of arms, strongly implied to be the home of the Zoar family.",
        "Abilities": "His swordcraft was more than a match even for [[Storm Silverhand]], and his sorcery was likewise second to none. He had also become a master of [[echo gates]].",
        "Relationships": "An unnamed [[Harper]] was his tutor in [[the Art]]. He had a network of spies at his service.",
        "History": "One day, a knight of [[Waterdeep]] slew Zoar's father and his tutor in the Art, a Harper who'd never given his name, but who died protecting Amril. This event happened at some point after {{yearlink|1346}}, as he judged it happened during [[Tamaeril Bladesemmer]]'s tenure as a [[Lord of Waterdeep]], which began in that year. In the years since, Zoar came to possess a book written by Ahghairon on the use of echo gates, capable of bypassing most of the wards in Waterdeep.\n\nOn early [[Flamerule]] of the {{YearlinkName|1355}},{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|2|Realmslore}} he resolved to get revenge, and using the echo gates, he ambushed Piergeiron Paladinson, ''[[charm person|charm]]ed'' him and extracted from his mind the identities of all the [[Masked Lord]]s of Waterdeep. He then attacked the open lord, severely wounding him;{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|126|9}} and [[Tamaeril Bladesemmer]], as well as the latter's [[dog]] and [[songbird]]{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|115-120|7}} in the same night, leaving a ''Harper pin'' on Resengar.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|148-152|9}}\n\nIn the same night he attempted to ambush [[Mirt]] at the [[Inner Audience Chamber]] of the palace, following him into the sewers through a secret passage; after taking some attacks, he tried to lure him into an exploding ''[[portal]]'' instead. He then used another gate to rush into the [[Yawning Portal]], where he was fought back into the portal by [[Tamsil Dryndilstann]] and [[Mhaere Dryndilstann]] before he could reach [[Durnan]], dropping a ''Harper pin'' before he left.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|153-156|10}}\n\nHe was afterwards ambushed by Storm Silverhand, who used a special spell to teleport herself to any ''Harper pin'' that had been tampered with in Waterdeep. They were soon joined by [[Elminster]], Piergeiron Paladinson, [[Asper]], and Mirt, and they swiftly defeated and immobilized Amril Zoar, who confessed to his plan afterwards. Before they could kill him, Storm pleaded for them to have mercy on him as he was worthy of becoming a Harper, and swore that she would kill him herself if he returned to his murderous ways."
