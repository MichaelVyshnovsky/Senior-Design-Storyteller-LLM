Sarissa Duncastle was a female human wererat from the Moonwood and was a rogue for the tribe of the People of the Black Blood living there.
Sarissa was the best scout of her tribe. She loved efficiency and she was cold and calculating, a woman who knew no fear and felt a secret ambition to supersede the Bloodmaster. Sarissa had been a lycanthrope since her birth and a descendant of a long line of wererats.
Among the possessions of Sarissa there were a mithral chain shirt, a +1 dagger, a ring of jumping, and a potion of invisibility.
