Tiralia was a human that originally stood , but later walked at a height of  after an incident with a spell going wrong. She was rather attractive, had a fair complexion, and sported curly red hair that dropped down to her shoulders.
Tiralia was extremely flirtatious and never failed to attract attention. When it came to fight, she preferred to use her incredible strength and staff, using her wizard spells to protect her or improve her chances in close-quarter combat.
After her incident with a spell gone wrong, Tiralia had strength equivalent to that of an ogre and could wield weapons suitable for a hill giant.
As a wizard Tiralia possessed a number of magical items. These included ring of djinni summoning, a ring of protection +2, a wand of fireballs, and a wand of magic missiles. In terms of non-magical items, she carried an ironwood staff that was  in length and  thick.
Tiralia also possessed spellbooks that contained and allowed her to cast the spells alter self, audible glamer, blur, cantrip, deeppockets, dispel magic, feather fall, fog cloud, friends, invisibility, read magic, shield, slow, stinking cloud, and wizard lock.
Tiralia grew up not knowing her parents, living among nobles as a successful courtesan. Eventually she grew tired of life among nobility and used all the money she had earned to enroll at a school of magic. She managed to learn there for two years before her funds had depleted, after which she left to become an adventurer. After a long journey, she joined the Iron Maidens adventuring company,
