'''Aiken Wyvernspur''' was a member of the noble house of [[Wyvernspur (house)|Wyvernspur]] in [[Cormyr]] in the 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Aiken was short and slender, with dark brown eyes and hair.

==Personality==
He was a quiet man, and loyal to friends, family, and the Crown.

==Abilities==
Aiken was a wise investor and developer in real estate. He ensured the family's financial stability by building houses and shops in [[Suzail]].

==Relationships==
Aiken was the son of [[Gerrin Wyvernspur I]] and [[Maritha]] of [[Mistledale]]. Aiken had an older sister, [[Sarah Wyvernspur I|Sarah]] and a younger sister, [[Linnese Wyvernspur|Linnese]]. Aiken married [[Cinda Sweetwater]] and they had two children, [[Gould Wyvernspur II|Gould]] and [[Leah Wyvernspur|Leah]]. [[Finder Wyvernspur]] was Aiken's uncle.

==History==
Aiken and his friends, [[Lareth Huntsilver]], [[Aubleth Crownsilver]], and [[Gardrath Roaringhorn]], discovered a mysterious magical instrument that folks named the ''[[Harp of Healing]]''. They were walking home from a roadside inn north of Suzail and saw some commoners being drawn to the music of a floating, glowing, harp. After touching the instrument, each person seemed healed of any aches, sickness, or deformity, and then they departed, joyously, into the forest. When the four men grabbed the the harp in order to take it to a [[War Wizards|War Wizard]] for examination, the instrument fell dark and silent and would not display any activity while they were within a few steps of it. [[Divination]] and detection spells cast on the harp and the men did not reveal any more information about the harp, and thereafter it only seemed to temporarily relieve pain when touched, not restore full health as it appeared to do when the four companions first came upon it.{{Cite dragon/280/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 3|86}}
