'''Berg'inyon Baenre''' was a [[drow]] weapon master of [[House Baenre]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].


==Relationships==
He was the youngest son to [[matron mother]] [[Yvonnel Baenre]] and had many elder sisters and brothers.

==Description==
Handsome even by drow standards, Berg'inyon kept his short hair finely cut.

==Personality==
He was described as a typical drow with high ambitions and no sense of morality.<ref>

==Possessions==
Being an elite drow soldier, Berg'inyon was skilled in the use of handling [[riding lizard]]s, and armed himself with a 10-foot-long (3 meters) ''[[death lance]]'' and a [[hand crossbow]].

==History==
Berg'inyon was a classmate and rival of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] in [[Melee-Magthere]], where he constantly ranked second to Drizzt and never once beat him, much to his dismay and to his mother's anger.<ref> He was initially trained by his brother [[Dantrag Baenre|Dantrag]].<ref>

After graduating Melee-Magthere, he commanded House Baenre's 400 lizard riders.<ref>

Later, in the {{YearlinkName|1357}} when Drizzt returned to the Underdark, Berg'inyon helped Dantrag in fighting Drizzt. But when Dantrag began to lose, Berg'inyon betrayed Dantrag and left the fight. Drizzt killed Dantrag,<ref> and Berg'inyon became the new weapon master of his house.<ref>

Following the drow retreat from their assault on [[Mithral Hall]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Berg'inyon chose to accept [[Jarlaxle]]'s offer to join [[Bregan D'aerthe]] as a lieutenant of the renegade drow band. He rationalized the instability that would likely plague House Baenre after the disastrous failed conquest of Mithral Hall and the likelihood that [[Triel Baenre|Triel]] would soon give birth to a son she would groom to replace Berg'inyon as the weapons master, which among the drow would likely mean Berg'inyon's death).<ref>

When [[Crenshinibon]] began to cloud Jarlaxle's judgment, Berg'inyon joined [[Rai-guy]], and [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]] in their attempt to usurp control of Bregan D'aerthe in the {{YearlinkName|1366}}. In the ensuing conflict, Berg'inyon faced off against the [[human]] [[assassin]] [[Artemis Entreri]] in single combat with Berg'inyon desiring to fight the one considered Drizzt's equal. However, Entreri proved the better and killed Berg'inyon during the fight in the lair of the [[red dragon]] [[Hephaestus]].<ref>
