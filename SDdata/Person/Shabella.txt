Shabella the Pale was the high priestess of the Temple of Mask in Bezantur, Thay, as well as the Guildmistress of that citys thieves guild in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Shabella was greedy,
Under her leadership, the thieves guild operating out of the Temple of Mask was one of the most powerful institutions in Bezantur, with leverage over the merchants and the guards. She took a personal cut of all temple donations and all guild activities.
She always made sure to keep Tharchion Aznar Thrul well bribed, and always sent him a nice fruit basket each year on the day of Bezanturs founding.
While she was the high priestess of the Temple of Mask, she was not the most high-ranking member of the church of Mask in Thay. Whenever her superior, a traveling high priest, was in town, she was subordinate to him with regards to issues of the faith.
As the head of Bezanturs mighty thieves guild, Shabella was one of the most powerful people in the city by the late 1360s DR, with even Aznar Thrul effectively in her pocket. However, as of the , the Shadowmaster of Telflamm had begun operating in the city, and were undermining her and her guilds influence.
