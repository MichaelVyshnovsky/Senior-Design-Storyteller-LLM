'''Shabella the Pale''' was the high [[priest]]ess of the [[Temple of Mask (Bezantur)|Temple of Mask]] in [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]], as well as the Guildmistress of that city's [[Thieves' guild (Bezantur)|thieves' guild]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Shabella was greedy,

==Activities==
Under her leadership, the [[thieves' guild]] operating out of the Temple of Mask was one of the most powerful institutions in Bezantur, with leverage over the merchants and the guards. She took a personal cut of all temple donations and all guild activities.

==Relationships==
She always made sure to keep [[Tharchion]] [[Aznar Thrul]] well bribed, and always sent him a nice [[fruit]] basket each year on the day of Bezantur's founding.

While she was the high priestess of the Temple of Mask, she was not the most high-ranking member of the [[church of Mask]] in Thay. Whenever her superior, a traveling high priest, was in town, she was subordinate to him with regards to issues of the faith.

==History==
As the head of Bezantur's mighty thieves' guild, Shabella was one of the most powerful people in the city by the late 1360s DR, with even Aznar Thrul effectively in her pocket. However, as of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the [[Shadowmaster of Telflamm]] had begun operating in the city, and were undermining her and her guild's influence.
