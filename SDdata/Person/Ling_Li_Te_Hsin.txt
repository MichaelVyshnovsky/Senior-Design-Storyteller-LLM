==Activities==
Ling Li worked as a cartographer for the [[Ministry of Public Works]] in [[Kuo Te' Shou]]. He was also the master of the [[Iron Hand School]], where he taught his personal style of martial art, assisted by his numerous relatives and disciples. Ling Li accepted only students who had previously mastered another form of [[kung fu]] and his training was very hard in order to made the body as hard as iron. Despite this, fighting was consider the last resort for Ling Li, as martial arts were a way of personal betterment.
