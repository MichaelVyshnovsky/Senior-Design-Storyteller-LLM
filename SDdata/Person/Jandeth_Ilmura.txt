Jandeth Ilmura was an adventuress in Myth Drannor in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Jandeth lived in a theater in Ordulin and prayed to Tymora to live a life of adventure. One night, she saw some thieves attacking a priestess of Tymora. Jandeth quickly went to help them. Together, they defeated the thieves and the priestess offered to Jandeth to join the church of Tymora and she accepted. After becoming a full cleric, she wandered on adventures helping people in the Dalelands and the Moonsea.
One day, she went back to Sembia, where she met the Company of the Catlash. A voice inside her told to join them and Jandeth followed the advice she believed came from her goddess.
In 1370 DR, the Company decided to go to Myth Drannor in order to acquire some magic items to empower them.
Jandeth was a long-standing member of the Company of the Catlash.
Jandeth lived fully in the present, not caring for her future. However, she hoped to one day make something that would change for the better the lives of people of the Dalelands. Usually she was amicable with strangers.
