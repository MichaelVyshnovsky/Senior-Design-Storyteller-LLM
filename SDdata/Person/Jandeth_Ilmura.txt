After becoming a full cleric, she wandered on adventures helping people in the [[Dalelands]] and the [[Moonsea]].

One day, she went back to [[Sembia]], where she met the [[Company of the Catlash]]. A voice inside her told to join them and Jandeth followed the advice she believed came from her goddess.
