'''Dura Gerathu''' was a male [[ranger]] who lived in the [[Brynwood]] forest in [[the Vast]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}

==History==
In the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], Gerathu met [[Cedric Ravajar]], leader of the [[Red Brigade]] mercenaries, while they conducted a scouting expedition in Brynwood.

In the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], Dura was asked by [[Randolph dul Umast]], high priest of [[Tymora]] in the [[hamlet]] of [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]], to locate the hideout of the [[Vipers]] band of bandits. He searched for several months with little success, until finally on [[Eleasis 28|Eleasias 28]] he located the tracks of [[Calispar Delgorth]] and [[Autton Shadowshroud]]. He followed these and discovered the [[Vipers' Nest]] in the Brynwood, in a [[dead-magic zone]] he had heard about but not visited. He observed the place and Viper activities for two days, and told what he found to his friend, a [[druid]] known only as [[The Green Lady]] of [[Misty Vale]].

He returned to his cabin in Brynwood and composed a letter about his findings for his [[falcon]] Gale to deliver to Umast. However, Cedric—now leader of the Vipers—had spotted and recognized Dura and sent Calispar and his bandits to eliminate him. Dura was surprised in his cabin and murdered, his valuables robbed, and his letter burned. However, a fragment miraculously survived. Two [[Sprite (creature)|sprites]] reported Dura's death to the Lady.

==Possessions==
Dura had a trained [[falcon]] named [[Gale]].

He lived in a single-room log cabin located in [[Dura's Vale]] in [[Brynwood]].

==Allies==
Dura was close friends with the Lady of Misty Vale.{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}
