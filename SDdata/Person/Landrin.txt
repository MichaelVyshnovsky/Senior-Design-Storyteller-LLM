'''Landrin''' was a [[gnome]] resident of [[Beregost]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Her home was located just west of the [[Jovial Juggler]] inn.

==History==
In the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]] Landrin's home became infested with [[giant spider]]s. She traveled to [[Baldur's Gate]] in order to buy some [[poison]], presumably to kill the arachnids, and stopped off at the [[Friendly Arm Inn]]. While there, [[Bentley Mirrorshade]] offered her temporary lodging until the problem was dealt with.
