Landrin was a gnome resident of Beregost during the midâ€“14 century DR. Her home was located just west of the Jovial Juggler inn.
In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR Landrins home became infested with giant spiders. She traveled to Baldurs Gate in order to buy some poison, presumably to kill the arachnids, and stopped off at the Friendly Arm Inn. While there, Bentley Mirrorshade offered her temporary lodging until the problem was dealt with.
