'''Aedelthrang the Black''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Uthgar]] in the [[Red Tiger tribe]] of [[Uthgardt]] barbarians that lived in the [[Silver Marches]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was an important authority figure within the tribe, serving as their "spirit talker".

Although the tribe was officially led by Chieftain [[Thradulf Longfang]], following the death of his uncle [[Adalwulf Longfang|Adalwulf]], Adelthrang acted as their true leader.
