Flubnak was a gnoll chieftain and trapper around 1485 DR.
Flubnak led a gnoll tribe near Daggerford. In 1485 DR, he was possessed by the pit fiend Baazka and manipulated into losing his title in favor of Noyerghu, a gnoll from Thay who accompanied the Red Wizard of Thay Thegger Grynn.
Flubnak became a kind of hermit, isolated from all save his two pet wolves. He was later killed by an adventuring party that had invaded the lodge to stop the gnolls raids.
