'''Flubnak''' was a [[gnoll]] chieftain and trapper around [[1485 DR]].

==History==
Flubnak led a gnoll tribe near [[Daggerford]]. In 1485 DR, he was possessed by the [[pit fiend]] [[Baazka]] and manipulated into losing his title in favor of [[Noyerghu]], a gnoll from [[Thay]] who accompanied the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Thegger Grynn]].

Flubnak became a kind of hermit, isolated from all save his two pet [[wolf|wolves]]. He was later killed by an adventuring party that had invaded the lodge to stop the gnoll's raids.
