        "mainbody": "Kalah, known by most as Black Claws, was a sahuagin prince after the Twelfth Serôs War.\nTKalah was born in 941 DR as a mutant with four arms.\nAround 1290 DR, he joined the royal guard by winning a duel, despite losing an arm.\nAfter the death of King Kromes and the destruction of the kingdom of Aleaxtis by a volcanic eruption in early 1369 DR, TKalah used this opportunity to challenge to Prince Githax to a duel, killing him. However, with the arrival of Iakhovas, he was forced to submit.\nTKalah followed Iakhovas loyally in the Twelfth Serôs War until the month of Uktar when tritons joined Iakhovass enemies and Iakhovas led his troops to Myth Nantar. TKalah and two other princes at this point abandoned the war, going back to sahuagin territories.\nAfter the war, the sahuagin kingdom was in chaos and TKalah easily defeated the remaining princes, emerging as the leader of his race. Soon TKalah sent his followers to build the colony of Balath among the Mountains of Volar.\nIn 1370 DR, following an ancient sahuagin tradition, he founded a city with his name upon the ruin of an elven city. Soon, the city of TKalah became the most powerful sahuagin city ever seen in Serôs. Its position also boosted the probability of malenti being born in the following hatching, guaranteeing TKalah with many spies to use."
