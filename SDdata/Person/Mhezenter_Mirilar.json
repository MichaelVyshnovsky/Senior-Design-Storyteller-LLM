        "mainbody": "'''Mhezenter Mirilar''' was a [[human]] [[thief]] in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He worked at [[Rallogar Hardware]] but was also a thief.",
        "Description": "Mhezenter was a thin man with a beak-like nose. He feigned being [[deaf]].",
        "Activities": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], Mhezenter worked for [[Zendaros Rallogar]] at Rallogar Hardware, loading crates of goods. He slept in the store's attic at nights. However, he was also a thief, and usually spent his nights robbing local warehouses and caravans passing through.\n\nHe was available to train other thieves, if they could catch him and survive a duel with him, for a sufficient payment. Mhezenter shrugged off attempts to blackmail him, then attacked and fled those who might threaten him.",
        "Possessions": "Mhezenter wielded a slim, [[rapier]]-like [[short sword]] and [[dart]]s, both of which he took to [[poison]]ing if he felt threatened. The poison induced sleep, but was old and had lost a little of its effectiveness. He also possessed a ''[[necklace of fireballs]]'' (with a single use left in 1358 DR), and a ''[[ring of the ram]]'', which he hid elsewhere in Wheloon, though he retrieved it if in danger."
