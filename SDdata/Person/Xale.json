His intensely piercing eyes were pale blue. Xale wore fine dark blue cloaks, silken shirts, and tailored pants. He even wore this attire into battle, donning a light [[mithral]] [[chain shirt]] under his fine clothes, instead of wearing heavier armor that many often associated with knights.",
        "Abilities": "The High Moonknight was a capable warrior and his devotion as a paladin allowed him to exuded an [[aura of courage]] to aid those around him. He could also [[smite evil]] foes. The Knights of the Blue Moon were granted a number of special lunar abilities by Mystra and [[Selûne]], and Xale had access to all of them. As both a paladin and sorcerer, he could cast both [[Divine magic|divine]] and [[arcane magic|arcane]] [[spell]]s including ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', and ''[[faith healing]]''.",
        "Possessions": "Xale owned and utilized many tools and powerful magical items.\n* +3 mithral chain shirt\n* [[Comet's Tail]], a +2 [[shattermantle]] lance\n* +1 [[keen]] [[bastard sword]]\n* [[Mystryl's Whirlstar]], a +1 [[returning]] [[shuriken]]\n* [[Amulet of health]] +2\n* [[Belt of giant strength]] +4\n* [[Ring of force shield]]\n* [[Ring of wizardry]] 1\n\nXale rode his celestial [[griffon]], [[Arimaspea]], into battle.",
        "Relationships": "The relationship between [[Meleghost Starseer]] and Xale was antagonistic and at times almost hostile. While not officially barred from entry, Meleghost made it known that the Knights of the Blue Moon were not welcome in the [[House of Wonder]]",
        "History": "Xale of the Starry Glen originally hailed from [[Selûnarra]]. Near the end of the [[Time of Troubles]], Xale was in the [[Ardeep Forest]], a land he did not know. While lost, he experienced a repeated vision of the [[Selûne (moon)|moon]] encircled by seven stars. He followed the vision’s guidance making his way to [[Waterdeep]]. After arriving in the City of Splendors, his visions persisted and he sought out council from the Church of Mystra at the [[House of Wonder]]. Further visions brought him to the Church of [[Selûne]] at the [[House of the Moon]]. Both clergy had been experiencing shared visions of a joint order of knights to fight against [[Shar]]. Xale volunteered to lead this new knightly order, interpreting that to be the purpose of his vision. The Churches accepted his offer, and Xale became High Moonknight of the Order of the Blue Moon."
