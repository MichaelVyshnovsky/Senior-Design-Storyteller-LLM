Sheik Ar-Rabi was a bandit leader during the mid–14th century DR.
Ar-Rabi was the leader of the bandit group known as the Desert Wind. His base of operations was the Grinning Skull oasis located deep within the Plains of Purple Dust.
Ar-Rabi would use captured prisoners to sample the potentially deadly water of the oasis before allowing his men to drink.
He would organize raids on the tribes of the desert and southern Murghôm.
