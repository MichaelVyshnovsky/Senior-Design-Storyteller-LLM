Rezifo was a steward of the Gudelmer family and its patriarch Albaerlus Gudelmer, active in the late 14 century DR.
In the late 14 century DR, Rezifo resided in the Gudelmer family estate â€“ the Dancing Dolphins House, located in the opulent Gem District of Athkatla. The steward of the Dancing Dolphins House was the only person, apart from the familys patriarch, whose mental commands controlled numerous gleaming suits of armor that lined the estates cavernous entryway. These suits of armor were reportedly animated helmed horrors.
