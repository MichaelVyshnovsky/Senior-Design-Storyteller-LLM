        "mainbody": "baya Uday () was a Chultan priest of Waukeen from Port Nyanzaru who traveled to Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.\nShe spent her time at the Yawning Portal, offering to pay premium (and nonnegotiable) prices for magic items and spellbooks recovered from the treacherous dungeon of Undermountain.\nShe discouraged inexperienced adventurers from delving into Undermountain, but was happy to help them gain the skills they needed to do so.\nObayas venture to collect magic items was on behalf of her employer, Wakanga Otamu, a wizard and merchant prince of Port Nyanzaru who controlled all trade in magic and lore within that city.\nShe hired a surveyor named Azuli Tefnek to map the routes into the deeper levels of Undermountain and to retrieve magical relics from within.\nObaya travelled from her native Chult to Waterdeep around 1492 DR with the objective of acquiring magical treasures for her master, Wakanga Otamu. To that end, she placed a large amount of platinum pieces in local banks and found her way to the Yawning Portal, where she booked a room and began to sponsor expeditions into Undermountain. It was her intention to hire bodyguards to protect herself and her acquisitions once she was ready to return to Chult."
