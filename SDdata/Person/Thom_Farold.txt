Thom Farold was a fisher from the town of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale in the late 13 century DR.
By 1281 DR, Thom was an aged human man with light skin tone, his hair whitened and eyesight dulled by age.
Thom and his late wife lived in a cabin in Lonelywood, elevated from the frozen ground and perched atop tall stilts, next to the towns windmill. The cabins entrance was only accessible via a tall ladder.
By the , Thom Farold was a widower. He honored his late wife by building a large boat that could transport up to seven people. Selara, the boat, was named after her. During the late 13 century DR, Thom could often be found fishing with his friend, a not-so-humble fisher named Young Ned. In his later years, Thom took on building small boats, with Selara being his biggest project, when he was not over-indulging in ale.
