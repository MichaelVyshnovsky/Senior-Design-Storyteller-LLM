'''Thom Farold''' was a fisher from the town of [[Lonelywood]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Why, welcome to Lonelywood, friends. Your faces don't look familiar to me. Then again, my eyes aren't what they used to be. Heh. Name's Thom, Thom Farold.''|Thom Farold}}

==Description==
By [[1281 DR]], Thom was an aged [[human]] man with light skin tone, his hair whitened and eyesight dulled by age.

==Possessions==
Thom and his late wife lived in a cabin in Lonelywood, elevated from the frozen ground and perched atop tall stilts, next to the town's [[windmill]]. The cabin's entrance was only accessible via a tall ladder.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Thom Farold was a widower. He honored his late wife by building a large boat that could transport up to seven people. ''[[Selara]]'', the boat, was named after her. During the late 13{{th}} century DR, Thom could often be found fishing with his friend, a not-so-humble fisher named [[Young Ned]]. In his later years, Thom took on building small boats, with ''Selara'' being his biggest project, when he was not over-indulging in [[ale]].
