'''Merrisara Winterwhite''' was the leader of [[New Sharandar]], a fortified outpost in the [[Feywild]] that was home to [[elves]] who descended from ancient [[Iliyanbruen]].

==Personality==
She was a dedicated and forthright leader, who worked well to navigate the various political interests of her people.

==Activities==
While Merrisara served as the commander of New Sharandar in the Feywild, she spent much of her time in [[Faer√ªn]] working to restore the ruins of [[Sharandar|Old Sharandar]].

As a leader she often had to mediate the varied interests of her people. Some of them were consumed with seeking revenge against those that plundered their ruined home and focused on little else.

==Relationships==
Merrisara had a strong-willed lieutenant in [[Olirien Mistcrown]], an eladrin who called for extreme violence to be taken against those creatures that befouled what remained of ancient Sharandar. While his rhetoric made the situation more difficult for Merrisara, he remained a loyal ally unlike elven officers.

==History==
Some time after the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the Iliyanbruen elves led by Merrisara formed New Sharandar, on either side of the ''[[Fey Crossing]]'', the ''portal'' that connected the [[Neverwinter Wood]] to the Feywild. They reclaimed the ruins of Old Sharandar, the former capital of their once great home, and slew the [[dark fey]] that despoiled the land.

New Sharandar faced a grave threat ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, when the [[fomorian]] giant-king [[Malabog]] launched his war of conquest from his [[Realm of Malabog|personal realm]] in the [[Feydark]]. Merrisara sent an [[Iliyasha Guidingstar|emissary]] to the great city of [[Neverwinter]], requesting aid from the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] and the [[Neverwinter Guard]]. She worked with the hero to help restore the destruction caused to New Sharandar by Malabog's dark fey minions, defeat some of the king's most malevolent allies, and finally scatter his army in a decisive battle in his [[Malabog's Castle|own castle]].
