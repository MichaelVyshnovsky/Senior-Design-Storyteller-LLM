        "mainbody": "'''Grazkahn''' was a [[death slaad]] commoner summoned by the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] in [[1373 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''I am Grazkahn. In the furthest reaches of the Multiverse, I make my home on planes so wild and chaotic they would shatter the minds of any mortal who gazed upon them.''|Grazkahn}}",
        "Description": "Like other slaadi, Grazkahn was a creature of chaos. His voice was a deep and croaky rumble. He had great magical and physical powers. Grazkahn was a power-hungry slaad and desired to devour [[Maganus]] - the one-eyed raven mage who summoned the slaadi to the [[prime Material plane]].",
        "Possessions": "Grazkahn commanded an army of [[Blue slaad|blue]] and [[green slaad]]i.",
        "History": "Grazkahn was among several influential denizens of the [[lower planes]] pulled to [[Toril]] by the Order of the Crippled Fang, under the command of [[archwizard]] Maganus in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}. Among other fiends enslaved by the cult was Grazkahn's enemy [[Kazz'Temmet]], the Master of the Twelve Blades of Gorgos. The cult unleashed the fiends on the [[Moonsea]] region, interrupting trade, sowing destruction, and attacking [[Zhentarim]]-controlled territories. \n\nGrazkahn was bound by summoning magics and put in charge of the attack on the [[Shind Road]] and its Zhent patrols. The slaadi forces were among the creatures that plagued the road when the [[Hero of Daggerford]] and his allies traveled from the town of [[Voonlar]] to [[Hillsfar]] to investigate the cult. By that time, Grazkahn had already spent a month on the prime material and was bored of its solid form. Kazz'Temmet sought the Hero's aid in slaying Grazkahn and buying him invaluable time that would allow the balor to break free of magical bondage and stay on [[Toril]] of his own free will.\n\nWhile Kazz'Temmet plotted, Grazkahn hatched his own scheme against the enemy. He ordered the Hero of Daggerford to kill the balor and retrieve his [[enchanted]] ''[[Abyssal blade]]''. Grazkahn knew of the blade's powers, and its connection to the lower planes, and the death slaad hoped to use the magic weapon to sever his summoning binds.\n\nIt was unrecorded which side the Hero of Daggerford chose if any. But eventually, the Shind Road's fiend infestation was ended, along with the chaos brought on by the Order of the Crippled Fang."
