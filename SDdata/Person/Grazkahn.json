        "mainbody": "razkahn was a death slaad commoner summoned by the Order of the Crippled Fang in 1373 DR.\nLike other slaadi, Grazkahn was a creature of chaos. His voice was a deep and croaky rumble. He had great magical and physical powers. Grazkahn was a power-hungry slaad and desired to devour Maganus - the one-eyed raven mage who summoned the slaadi to the prime Material plane.\nGrazkahn commanded an army of blue and green slaadi.\nGrazkahn was among several influential denizens of the lower planes pulled to Toril by the Order of the Crippled Fang, under the command of archwizard Maganus in the . Among other fiends enslaved by the cult was Grazkahns enemy KazzTemmet, the Master of the Twelve Blades of Gorgos. The cult unleashed the fiends on the Moonsea region, interrupting trade, sowing destruction, and attacking Zhentarim-controlled territories. \nGrazkahn was bound by summoning magics and put in charge of the attack on the Shind Road and its Zhent patrols. The slaadi forces were among the creatures that plagued the road when the Hero of Daggerford and his allies traveled from the town of Voonlar to Hillsfar to investigate the cult. By that time, Grazkahn had already spent a month on the prime material and was bored of its solid form. KazzTemmet sought the Heros aid in slaying Grazkahn and buying him invaluable time that would allow the balor to break free of magical bondage and stay on Toril of his own free will.\nWhile KazzTemmet plotted, Grazkahn hatched his own scheme against the enemy. He ordered the Hero of Daggerford to kill the balor and retrieve his enchanted Abyssal blade. Grazkahn knew of the blades powers, and its connection to the lower planes, and the death slaad hoped to use the magic weapon to sever his summoning binds.\nIt was unrecorded which side the Hero of Daggerford chose if any. But eventually, the Shind Roads fiend infestation was ended, along with the chaos brought on by the Order of the Crippled Fang."
