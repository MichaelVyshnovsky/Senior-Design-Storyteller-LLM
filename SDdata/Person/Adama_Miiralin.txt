'''Adama Miiralin''' was a young and naive [[cleric]] of [[Tymora]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Personality==
Adama was a young and enthusiastic man. He hoped to rise through the ranks of the church of Tymora. Despite his usually wise nature, he believed wholly in luck, and took wild risks as a matter of course.

==Relationships==
The young priest was hopelessly in love with [[Lamris Kholl]].

==History==
Adama hailed from [[Arabel]] in [[Cormyr]], but departed to distance himself from the heretical local clerics of Tymora. In Waterdeep, he aspired to have the local [[Tower of Luck]] be considered the center of Tymoran worship.

Adama spent much of his time stayed near the [[Yawning Portal]], observing adventurers that entered and exited [[Undermountain]] and keeping records of those who attempted Lady Luck's ultimate test. He shared these records with both his superiors in the [[Church of Tymora]] and with the [[Open Lord]] [[Piergeiron the Paladinson|Piergeiron]].

On the month of [[Eleint]], in the year [[1368 DR|336 NR (1368 DR)]], High Priestess [[Seenroas Halvinhar]] ordered the Adama to set down an account of all the latest activity and news surrounding the Yawning Portal and [[Undermountain]].{{Cite dragon/227/The Reports from Undermountain|15}}
