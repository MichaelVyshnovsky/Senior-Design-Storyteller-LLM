'''Thorvin Twinbeard''' was the chief [[engineer]] of the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]] in [[Waterdeep]] during the early 1490s [[DR]].
 
==Activities==
Thorvin was the chief engineer and trapsmith for the [[Xanathar]]. He was also a paid informant of the [[Harpers]] and informed them of the Xanathar's plots under the cover of his maintenance inspections in [[Skullport]].

In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} he was working on a mechanical [[beholder]] while three [[duergar]] and one [[gazer]] protected him. In truth, the gazer was spying on Thorvin under orders of the Xanathar, who suspected the dwarf.

He lived inside the [[beholder]]'s lair. His pet project was a pulverizer to destroy for good the petrified victims of his master but he used it as cover to gather information to sell to the Harpers.
