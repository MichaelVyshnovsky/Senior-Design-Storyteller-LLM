        "mainbody": "Kelvar Helmfast, nicknamed \"The Old Captain\", was a member of the Helmfast noble family of Waterdeep and the Master Shipwright of the Order of Master Shipwrights guild in the mid–14 century DR.\nBy 1368 DR, his consort was Ranya Helmfast and his eldest son and heir was Edwind Helmfast.\nKelvar Helmfast once fought a spontaneous duel with Lorngar Roaringhorn in the Great Library of the House of the Moon temple to Selûne in the late 1330s DR. They did substantial damage to the library, for which their respective families made reparations at many times the cost of the damage.\nHe held his positions as head of family and guildmaster by 1357 DR and through 1368 DR and 1372 DR."
