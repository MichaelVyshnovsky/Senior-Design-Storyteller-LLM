        "mainbody": "Cobble was a dwarven cleric in Mithral Hall.\nHe was a squat and round dwarf with a short yellow beard.\nThe dwarven cleric was said to be strong in magic and have deep insight into the world.\nIn 1357 DR, Bruenor Battlehammer gave him the title Holy Cleric of the Hall. \nIn 1357 DR, the Companions of the Hall delved deep into Mithral Hall searching for Drizzt DoUrden after Bruenor discovered Artemis Entreri was masquerading as Regis. While hunting for Drizzt, Cobble saw metal shavings on the floor and realized a spell trap. He shouted for the others to fall back but was crushed to death beneath a wall of solid iron cast by Vierna DoUrden."
