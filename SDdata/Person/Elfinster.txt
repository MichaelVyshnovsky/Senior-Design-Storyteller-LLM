}}'''Elfinster''', also known as '''El''', operated the small establishment known as the [[School of the Mage of Shadowdale]] in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
El was a [[human]] [[ajami]] mage who called himself the "Mage of Shadowdale."

==Personality==
He would get very prickly if anyone confused him with [[Elminster]] or called him by that name, often refusing to deal with them unless they apologized profusely.

==History==
The [[wizard]] decided to get as far away from [[Shadowdale]] as possible in order to avoid comparison with "the ''other'' mage of Shadowdale." El eventually settled in Huzuz, where he married [[Amsha al-Lanim]] and opened his establishment.
