'''Smiler''', or '''Smiler the Defiler''', was an insane [[fey eladrin]] adventurer who was the leader of [[Smiler's Defilers]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1424 DR]], Smiler and his companions ventured into [[Avernus]] from the [[Feywild]]. His associates left him there, and from then on, he roamed the first layer of [[Baator]]. Some time later, the Defiler sold his soul to a [[pit fiend]]. Using the power granted to him by the great [[baatezu]], he took control of a warband previously lead by [[Yarrasto]], a [[sky demon]]. The gang had access to multiple [[infernal war machine]]s, and started to get on the nerves of other warbands and their leaders.

Due to Smiler's antics, a trio of warlords—[[Feonor]], [[Kovik|Princeps Kovik]], and [[L'zeth|Bitter Breath]]—ganged up on him and his warband. The eladrin, however, managed to escape by riding away on a [[Devil's Ride]].

After his escape, by [[1492 DR]],{{BG-DiA-time}} he attempted to get [[Mad Maggie]] to help him get vengeance on the warlord trio.

==Description==
Smiler was an [[evil]] eladrin warlord who was said to have an unnerving grin. 

==Personality==
The Defiler was somewhat insane, being absolutely reckless, but ultimately positive. Smiler would sometimes use ''[[hallucinatory terrain]]'' to make an illusory version of a forest of his original home. Within, he would meditate and concoct plots to deceive his foes. He believed he could achieve anything, but also realized that this way of thinking might be the death of him.

Despite his insanity, Smiler was actually rather intelligent and charismatic. Owing to this, he was able to easily persuade foes into doing what he wished, as well as simply deceiving them.

The Defiler was known to pee into the hot wind, as well as drive a two-wheeled infernal war machine.The description in ''[[Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus]]'' that introduces Smiler has two notable typos. The first is "You see ''an'' two-wheeled infernal war machine". The second is "Standing atop the rock, ''peeing'' into the hot wind, is a slender elf-like figure." While this ''might'' be meant to be "peering", one could consider that the notably insane and reckless Defiler might well do such an insane and reckless self-defiling thing.

==Abilities==
The chaotic eladrin was a fairly competent combatant, able to attack quickly with his enchanted [[sword]], and cast many [[spell]]s at will. Amongst his spell list was ''[[Otto's irresistible dance]]'', ''[[enthrall]]'', ''[[confusion]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', and ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter]]''.

==Possessions==
The warlord wore ''+2 [[leather armor]]'', and wielded a ''+1 [[shortsword]]''. He carried seven [[soul coin]]s.

==Relationships==
Smiler was allied with Mad Maggie, but did not wish to join her crew.
