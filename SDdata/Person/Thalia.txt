'''Thalia''' was a member of the [[Rogues of Tilverton]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
In 1357 DR, the Guildmaster [[Artur Grossman]] ordered Thalia, disguised as a servant, to escort out of the Rogues' hideout an adventuring party possessing the [[Azure Bonds]]. In that moment, a group of mercenaries attacked them and Artus led his men in battle.

==Personality==
Thalia was unhappy about Guildmaster Artur's sexism, but considered him a good guy.
