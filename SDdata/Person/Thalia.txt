Thalia was a member of the Rogues of Tilverton in 1357 DR.
In 1357 DR, the Guildmaster Artur Grossman ordered Thalia, disguised as a servant, to escort out of the Rogues hideout an adventuring party possessing the Azure Bonds. In that moment, a group of mercenaries attacked them and Artus led his men in battle.
Thalia was unhappy about Guildmaster Arturs sexism, but considered him a good guy.
