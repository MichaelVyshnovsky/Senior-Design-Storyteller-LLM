'''Quarrel''' was a [[half-orc]] [[assassin]] in the service of [[Tyranthraxus]].

==Description==
Quarrel was a slender and powerful female [[humanoid]] with black hair, [[jet]] colored eyes, and a [[wikipedia:pig|piggish]] nose.

==Personality==
Slim and beautiful, spoke with a rough voice and could not escape her [[orc]] heritage.

==Possessions==
In battle, Quarrel armed herself with her favorite [[dagger]] and wore dark [[wikipedia:cape|cape]] over her [[chain mail]].

==History==
In [[1340 DR]], Quarrel and her assassin guild searched [[Sembia]] for [[ioun stone]]s. Two weeks later, she was hired by the ''Possessing Spirit'' to either persuade the heroes of [[Phlan]] to join the ''Lord of the Ruins'' or die.

===Death===
A day later on the 28th of [[Flamerule]] 1340 DR, Quarrel met the heroes in the [[Laughing Goblin Inn]] but they refused to join Tyranthraxus, so she threw her poisoned dagger at Shal and fled. During a short melee in the inn, Quarrel had her skull crushed in under the hooves of Shal's [[horse]] [[familiar]], [[Cerulean]].
