Quarrel was a half-orc assassin in the service of Tyranthraxus.
Quarrel was a slender and powerful female humanoid with black hair, jet colored eyes, and a piggish nose.
Slim and beautiful, spoke with a rough voice and could not escape her orc heritage.
In battle, Quarrel armed herself with her favorite dagger and wore dark cape over her chain mail.
In 1340 DR, Quarrel and her assassin guild searched Sembia for ioun stones. Two weeks later, she was hired by the Possessing Spirit to either persuade the heroes of Phlan to join the Lord of the Ruins or die.
A day later on the 28th of Flamerule 1340 DR, Quarrel met the heroes in the Laughing Goblin Inn but they refused to join Tyranthraxus, so she threw her poisoned dagger at Shal and fled. During a short melee in the inn, Quarrel had her skull crushed in under the hooves of Shals horse familiar, Cerulean.
