'''Arghain''' was a [[half-ogre]] bandit who wandered near the town of [[Nashkel]]. He lived during the [[iron crisis]] of the [[Sword Coast]] and in desperate need for good iron to restore the reputation of his clan, he and three other half-ogres attacked [[Gorion's Ward]], leading to Arghain's death.
