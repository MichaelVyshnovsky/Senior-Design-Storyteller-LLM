{{quote|Stupid Conall, throwing my ba - Sorry. Mam said I shouldn't talk to strangers.|Emen}}

==Description==
Emen was a [[human]] child with a light skin tone, long brown hair, and hazel eyes.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Emen often played ball with his friend, [[Conall]] at the [[Bloomridge Park]]. At some point during the [[Absolute crisis]], the children were at the Park, and Conall threw Emen's ball far away, refusing to retrieve it. When a group of [[assassin]] worshippers of [[Bhaal]] attempted to slaughter the park-goers in the middle of a day to venerate their monstrous [[deity]]. It was unknown if the children survived.
