        "mainbody": "'''Jil Torbo''' was a member of the [[Absolution Council]], the ruling body of the [[Revel's End]] prison and the group that oversaw the fates of the prison's inmates on behalf of the [[Lords' Alliance]]. She served as a representative of her home city of [[Baldur's Gate]] for a time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "The councilor was a wholly dour and humorless individual. She was not without compassion however, and often gave others the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Activities": "Councilor Torbo absolutely hated her job. She struggled to remain her composure whenever someone aggravated her.\n\nEver the contrarian, she regularly voted to commune prisoners' sentences, often against the wishes of her fellow councilors.",
        "History": "[[File:Heroes Unite - Absolution Council.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Jil contemplates Edgin's statement.'']]\nIn the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} the Absolution Council—Jil Torbo, [[Voss Anderton]], [[Kriv Norixius]], and a delayed [[Jarnathan]]—met in Revel's End to consider a pardon for [[Edgin Darvis]] and [[Holga Kilgore]] for the crimes of skulduggery and grand larceny. Torbo was wearied by Edgin's many breaks and stalling while making his statement.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} She was right to be—ultimately, though, the Council approved their pardon, the pair escaped by fighting off the guards, grabbing Jarnathan, and jumping through the window before they could announce it.\n\nWhilst traveling south back to Baldur's Gate, Jil passed through [[Neverwinter]] and stopped at the [[Driftwood Tavern]] during the city's [[High Sun Games]]. There, she happened to notice Edgin and Holga, now joined by [[Simon Aumar]] and [[Doric]], as they rented an upstairs meeting room. Jil alerted the [[Neverwinter Guard]], but by the time they arrived, the thieves had escaped again.\n\nMore than a year later, the same council met to consider [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] for pardon, but were wise to the same tricks and refused him."
