Tanglor was a half-elf adventurer who infiltrated the mysterious Darkmoon temple, in 1358 DR.
Tanglor, while being a half-elf, looked surprising dwarven. He had a bushy brown beard, and donned a dwarven helmet. He owned some enchanted equipment, including his short sword and shield. He fought with a dagger and wore full plate mail, along with using his holy symbol to cast priestly magic.
The adventurer made it all the way to the silver tower of the Darkmoon temple, seemingly single-handed. He may have been found sleeping, and snoring loudly, in the corner of a room by the Heroes of Waterdeep. If so, Tanglor suddenly jerked awake, grabbed his dagger and was prepared for combat. He grumbled at them, claiming they were clerics coming to disturb his rest again. The adventurers apologized for waking him, and he responded by saying that he believed he was the only one bold enough to take the test for admission to the temple. Tanglor then said the heroes were worthy of his company, and offered to join them.
