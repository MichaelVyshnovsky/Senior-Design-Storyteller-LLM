        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1374}}, he left to investigate the nearby [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]], which had been returned to Raurin by [[Pandorym]], together with his companions [[Feraih]] and [[Ghanim]]. He entered the structure with Ghanim while Feraih remained outside, waiting for them to return; they never did.\n\n[[Kiril Duskmourn]] entered the Palace some time after and was attacked by two elves from Al Qahara, now under the influence of Pandorym. She assumed them to be Ghanim and Haleem from the initials engraved in the arrow that one of them shot her with, but was forced to slay one as he kept trying to cut her down with a sword despite her entreaties to talk. The other used an arrow to put his own amulet connecting it to Pandorym inside an imprisoned [[water elemental]], breaking its imprisonment in the process; the separation from its amulet slew it on the spot.{{cite book/Darkvision|260|27}}Ghanim and Haleem were never referred to separately; it is impossible to tell from the text which one was slain by Kiril Duskmourn and which one gave his life to infect the water elemental with Pandorym's amulet. In fact, they could be other elves; there is no guarantee those two were actually Ghanim and Haleem. The event most likely occurred on [[Tarsakh 19]], the same day Pandorym was resealed.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"N2\">Kiril Duskmourn entered the Palace of the Purple Emperor during the day. As there is no indication they rested in there, and she never went through the Celestial Nadir, it is most likely all of her actions occurred on the same day as Pandorym was resealed."
