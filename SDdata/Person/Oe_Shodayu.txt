Oe Shodayu was a retainer of the Funada clan in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
Shodayu was an old warrior tired of fighting. He preferred to study the classics and train himself.
In 1357 DR, during the plot of Goshukara Akinari to make Funada Mitsuhide lose face in front of the special envoy of the shogun, Lord Masago, Shodayu would attempt to strike down Akinari.
Shodayu lacked a true warlike spirit, so he did not advance much in his profession. However, he carried out his duties faithfully and to the best of his abilities.
