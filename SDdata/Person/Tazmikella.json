        "mainbody": "Tazmikella was a copper dragon who lived in the Bloodstone Lands.\nHer human form was that of a rather ordinary looking, middle-aged woman with once-strawberry-blond, mostly soft-gray hair, dressed in simple clothes. She was also known to take the form of a young blond female elf, but still kept her human name. She had wide shoulders and a smallish head.\nTazmikella was considered friendly by her customers and neighboring merchants. She hated wearing clothes and couldnt understand the need of humans to hide their natural forms. To her that showed a level of shame and modesty reflective of a race that couldnt elevate itself above its apparent limitations.\nBy the 14th century DR, Tazmikella was centuries old. She had a sister, Ilnezhara, with whom she crawled from her egg in the great deserts of Calimshan.\nShe and her sister were once approached by Zhengyi, the Witch-King, with the offer of immortality in lichdom if they served beside his conquering armies. The dragon sisters declined that offer.\nIn 1368 DR, Tazmikella owned a shop at Walls Around in Heliogabalus called Tazmikellas Bag of Silver.\nBy 1484 DR, Tazmikella was posing as the human \"Mickey,\" the owner of a curiosity shop called Mickeys Bag of Holding at Walls Around in Helgabal. That year, the drow Jarlaxle approached her and her sister, requesting them to help him in the events surrounding the Darkening and the involvement of several white dragons.\nDuring the Tyranny of Dragons, she was chosen as member of Protanthers council of metallic dragons to oppose the Cult of the Dragon and Tiamat.\nIn her dragon form, Tazmikella could blow a garlic-smelling breath that slowed those affected. When in her human and elf forms, Tazmikella still retained her dragon strength, being capable of stopping a frost giants warhammer many times her size as well as use it against it with ease, a feat that shocked many who bore witness."
