==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, the [[Red Fang Marauders]] began raiding the environs of [[Baldur's Gate]] and attacked caravans on the Trade Way. One such raid was led by [[Harnak]] the Butcher. The [[goblin]]s attacked Wayfork Village, forcing the survivors to flee and shelter in Larani's inn. Harnak and his men broke into the inn, but the survivors and Larani herself were saved by a group of six heroes who ended the hobgoblin's life and fought the raiders off. Larani was grateful and even collected some humble coin to reward the adventurers, but despite that, she still believed that adventurers were rough and dangerous kind.
