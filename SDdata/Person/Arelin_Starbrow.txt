'''Arelin Starbrow''' was the [[Roadwarden]], the leader of the [[Roadwarden Guard]], stationed in the [[Skull Crag Keep]] in the [[Storm Horn Mountains]] of [[Cormyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Arelin Starbrow was married to [[Morudel]] of [[Marsember]], with whom she sired several children, including a fellow Roadwarden Guard – heroic [[Vidruand]], and the problem child and a notorious vandal [[Dazmilar]].

==History==
By the early [[1360 DR|1360s DR]], Arelin Starbrow was a renowned hero of [[Skull Crag]] and a beloved Roadwarden. Locals often shared tales of Arelin's and her son, Vidruand's heroics. Her career and life ended when she and the Chief of the Roadwarden Guard, Sir [[Dutiocs]], were ambushed by monsters of an encroaching horde. Sir Dutiocs rushed back to the Skull Crag Keep with Arelin's body, leaving behind the symbol of the office she wielded in battle – the ''Arms of the Roadwarden.''

Some time later, a [[rakshasa]] who forged an alliance between [[ogre]]s and [[oni mage]]s of the Storm Horns took on Arelin Starbrow's guise to trick adventurers and their companion [[Arderiel]]. However, the ruse failed and Arelin's memory remained untainted.
