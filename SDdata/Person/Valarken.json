        "mainbody": "'''Grand Duke Valarken''' was one of the rulers of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He famously led a coup against his fellow [[Grand Duke]]s, in an attempt to gain sole rulership over the Gate.",
        "Relationships": "Valarken was supported in his political aspirations by a group of [[lycanthrope]]s known as the [[Band of the Red Moon]].",
        "History": "During Valarken's takeover, his group managed to kill two members of the [[Council of Four]], but were unable to slay [[Dillard Portyr|Grand Duke Portyr]]. Unfortunately for them, however, they were stopped by the [[Flaming Fist]] and the [[the Watch|Baldurian Watch]], and subsequently driven into the nearby [[Wood of Sharp Teeth|Werewoods]].\n\nIt was believed that they began to rebuild the city of [[Vehlarr (city)|Vehlarr]] to reform a nation for [[werewolves]]."
