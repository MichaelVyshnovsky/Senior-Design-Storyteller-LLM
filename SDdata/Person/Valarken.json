        "mainbody": "Grand Duke Valarken was one of the rulers of Baldurs Gate during the midâ€“15 century DR. He famously led a coup against his fellow Grand Dukes, in an attempt to gain sole rulership over the Gate.\nValarken was supported in his political aspirations by a group of lycanthropes known as the Band of the Red Moon.\nDuring Valarkens takeover, his group managed to kill two members of the Council of Four, but were unable to slay Grand Duke Portyr. Unfortunately for them, however, they were stopped by the Flaming Fist and the Baldurian Watch, and subsequently driven into the nearby Werewoods.\nIt was believed that they began to rebuild the city of Vehlarr to reform a nation for werewolves."
