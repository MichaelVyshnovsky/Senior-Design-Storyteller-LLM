Easton Kneller was a human resident of Eveningstar in Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
Easton had light skin and short red-brown hair. He wore a long tunic and carried a quarterstaff.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the mid-1480s DR, Easton tried to get heroic individuals such as adventurers to rescue Eveningstar residents from being stranded in the Kings Forest, which was a battlefield with the drow of Sschindylryn.
