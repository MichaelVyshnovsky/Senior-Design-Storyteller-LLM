He had brought with him a great deal of personal wealth from Tavaray and used this to pay off anyone who was opposed to him seizing power.\n\nUth I began to feel the effects of age around [[158 DR]] and allowed his eldest son [[Ornoth I|Ornoth Myrmoran]] to run the government. He died a decade later in the {{YearlinkName|168}}.\n\nKing Uth I's and Queen Sarlani's crypts were located below the ruins of the Uthtower in what eventually became the [[Mere of Dead Men]]."
