Curampah was a junior kuo-toa whip and companion to Nogah during the late 14 century DR. His faith in her was greater than that of most kuo-toa.
Curampah was able to call upon lightning bolts together with Nogah.
Curampah was Nogahs junior whip, and her authority over him was absolute. Though she believed him to doubt her,, he actually had more faith in her than most kuo-toa.
Curampah carried a pincer staff.
Curampah joined Nogah in her expedition to the depths in , following her visions.
While exploring the side of the vent, Curampah discovered a ruined illithid city. Proximity to it caused the charm protecting them from the crushing weight of the water to unravel he quickly woke Nogah up. Looking together, they discovered an undead mind flayer guarding the location. After some struggling, they defeated it with a lightning bolt. Searching through the city, they discovered a great six-sided iron door, which Nogah felt was the locus of her visions. Curampah died after the two of them managed to open the valve door with coordinated blasts of lightning. They were carried across the door in a great rush of water, as the pressure of the Sea of Fallen Stars filled the site protected by the door he hit his head while thrown around by the torrent.
