'''Thurl Merosska''' was a high-ranking member of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]] and leader of [[Feathergale Knights]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Personality==
Thurl's main motivation and goal was power. He thought that, thanks to Yan-C-Bin, he could rule Waterdeep. Thurl pledged loyalty to [[Aerisi Kalinoth]] but only reluctantly, believing that one day he would use her and her minions to conquer Waterdeep.

==History==
Thurl was once [[Griffon Cavalry|a griffon rider]] in [[Waterdeep]] until a great storm nearly killed him. After that experience, he started to worship [[Yan-C-Bin]]. Soon, he gathered around him a group of like-minded wealthy folk of Waterdeep and founded the [[Feathergale Knights]] as a cover group of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]].
