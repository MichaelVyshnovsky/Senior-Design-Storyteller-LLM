Thurl Merosska was a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Howling Hatred and leader of Feathergale Knights during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Thurls main motivation and goal was power. He thought that, thanks to Yan-C-Bin, he could rule Waterdeep. Thurl pledged loyalty to Aerisi Kalinoth but only reluctantly, believing that one day he would use her and her minions to conquer Waterdeep.
Thurl was once a griffon rider in Waterdeep until a great storm nearly killed him. After that experience, he started to worship Yan-C-Bin. Soon, he gathered around him a group of like-minded wealthy folk of Waterdeep and founded the Feathergale Knights as a cover group of the Cult of the Howling Hatred.
