'''Halanther Dayne''', was a merchant and representative of the [[Shield Trading Company]] in [[Voonlar]] in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''If I had a [[gold]] piece for every adventurer that came to me asking questions, I'd double the Shield's turnover in a year. Still, it's a cold day, and I could use the company. Go ahead.''|Halanther Dayne talking to yet another adventurer}}

==Description==
In [[1373 DR]], Halanther was almost 60 years old. His aged face held a perpetual frown and was leathery.

==Possessions==
Halanther Dayne ran the merchant house in Voonlar and offered the trading company's goods for sale at a higher than normal price due to [[Bron]]'s steep taxes. All guests who entered the Shield Trading outpost were greeted with grim over man who nodded towards a massive [[shield guardian]] who towered beside him – the main anti-thievery determent.

==History==
Halanther Dayne was born into poverty within the infamous city of [[Zhentil Keep]]. As a child, he fed on carrion and scraps. When the frost opportunity presented itself, Halanther fled to the town of Voonlar, where he remained.

By the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Halanther Dayne was already a stern and experienced merchant. He kept the outpost safe through the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] crisis that briefly ravaged the Moonsea. It affected Halanther's trade, and in 1373 DR, the Order unleashed an army of [[fiend]]s on Voonlar, but both Halanther and his [[golem]] remained unharmed. Halanther was proud that his trading house was virtually only one organization in Voonlar that was not owned nor affiliated with the dreaded [[Black Network]].

A Shield Trading Company's merchant named [[Madoc]] arrived at [[Voonlar]] with a big shipment of goods from the [[Dalelands]] just before the attack took place. He was accompanied by the [[Hero of Daggerford]] who helped to defend the town. Halanther was surprised to see a famed Hero working as a simple caravan guard, and even more shocking was the Hero's pay – almost half the Shield Trading Company's annual profits. When Madoc's true affiliation with Zhentil Keep was revealed, and the dwarf was executed for his betrayal of the Black Network, Halanther refused to believe it as he'd known the cranky merchant for years.
