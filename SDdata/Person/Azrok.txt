Azrok was a hobgoblin warlord in Undermountain in the late 15 century DR.
Usually, Azrok sat on his throne assisted by his wife and lieutenant Lurkana and six goblins, two bugbears, and four hobgoblins, plus two worgs.
Azrok was born blind in a hobgoblin clan in Undermountain. Normally, his disability would doom him but Azroks mother, a powerful sorceress, crafted for him a dagger of blindsight that permitted him to see as a normal hobgoblin. In time, Azrok became the leader of his clan and with great wisdom settled his people inside the Sargauth Level where they prospered, killing the local grimlocks and troglodytes. Azrok even sired an heir and his people renamed themselves the Legion of Azrok.
In the , Kessandro Rosznar went to met Azrok in order to start a slaving business together but instead Azrok killed the young Rosznar for his failing to show the proper respect to the warlord.
Some time after, some duergar thieves of Clan Ironeye stole Azroks magical dagger. Using this advantage, the drow of House Auvryndar managed to settle in the level without too many attacks from Azroks army. His wife and lieutenant Lurkana tried to cover for Azroks weakness but her efforts were ruined by a mind flayer ambassador of Skullport who used some intellect devourer infiltrators to spread the truth about Azroks condition. Many of his bugbearÂ and goblin minions abandoned Azrok and went to Skullport to join the Xanathars Thieves Guild. Afterward, Azrok feared an invasion from Skullport into his dominion and a very probable new attack by House Auvryndar.
Azroks subjects believed him to be blessed by Maglubiyet and he encouraged this rumor.
Azrok possessed a magical dagger that permitted him a normal vision despite being blind.
