==Description==
He was a heavy-built man of few words.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Goulart and his fellow adventurers recovered a collection of scrolls and documents from the remains of a [[dragon]] that had died in battle on the edge of the [[Wyvernwater]]. They soon discovered that inscribed upon the scrolls were the [[true name]]s of quite a number of the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]], having been collected by agents of King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|Azoun IV]].
