'''Beldergast''' was a [[Zhentarim|Zhentish]] merchant and spy in [[Thentia]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Activities==
Beldergast was a cloth merchant in Thentia, but also worked alongside [[Amthrud]] in studying the city for economic weaknesses that would allow [[Zhentil Keep]] conquer the city. His loyalty and efforts were fruitless, however. Worse, his spycraft had been discovered by several locals, including [[Melyrk Rubyripper]].

Amthrud had a bodyguard of three [[wizard]]s and six [[fighter|men-at-arms]].
