Beldergast was a Zhentish merchant and spy in Thentia in 1367 DR.
Beldergast was a cloth merchant in Thentia, but also worked alongside Amthrud in studying the city for economic weaknesses that would allow Zhentil Keep conquer the city. His loyalty and efforts were fruitless, however. Worse, his spycraft had been discovered by several locals, including Melyrk Rubyripper.
Amthrud had a bodyguard of three wizards and six men-at-arms.
