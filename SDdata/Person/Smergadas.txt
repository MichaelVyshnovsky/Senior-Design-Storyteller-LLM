Smergadas was a young adult male red dragon who attempted to settle in the Dessarin Valley, sometime before the midâ€“14 century DR.
The young, brash Smergadas attempted to settle in the Dessarin Valley in an area very near to the town of Red Larch, having taken a liking to the region. After flying around for a day without opposition, he feasted on local deer, then landed to rest. Claugiyliamatar, unhappy with Smergadas presence within her territory, flew out and picked up a massive boulder from the top of a mountain and dropped it on him while he slept, killing him. She then feasted on his remains.
The boulder, as left by Claugiyliamatar, would come to be known locally as Lance Rock.
