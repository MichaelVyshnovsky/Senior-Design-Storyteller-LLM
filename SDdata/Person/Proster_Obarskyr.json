        "History": "Proster was born in the {{YearlinkName|1035}}.\n\nHe became king in the {{YearlinkName|1056}}, after his father was mortally wounded in the retaking of rebellious [[Arabel]].\n\nDuring his reign, Proster pursued an extensive number of building projects. In hopes of expediting their construction, he commissioned [[Valmous]] of the [[College of Shaping Magics]] to develop a new type of [[stone golem]] that was larger than average. However, due to a misfired [[spell]] the [[Awtawmatawn|golem]] became possessed by a [[horned devil]] and went on to destroy the College before being destroyed itself.\n\nHe passed away in the {{YearlinkName|1122}}, aged 87, and was succeeded by Baerovus."
