'''Tsjancy Yildree''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|528}} to {{yearlink|531}}. He was chosen by [[Azuth]], probably by being the most thorough magical researcher of his day.

==Appearance==
He was a fat, scuttling man.

==Personality==
He was genial, and always smiled, even during torture. His hobbies included strong cheeses, mustard pickles, and crafting new spells.

==Abilities==
He was the most thorough magical researcher of the day.

==History==
Tsjancy accepted the office of the [[Magister]] when [[Azuth]] offered it, but almost immediately regretted it due to the volume of challengers for the position. This frustration led him to develop a spell, the ''[[feeblemind field]]'', to deal with them more efficiently.

The end of his tenure began when a foe captured him with a freshly-developed ''[[dispel magic field]]'' spell, and chained one of his hands to a cave where the ''dispelling field'' was set down. He then tortured him for the specifics of several spells by crushing his free hand. When his captor allowed him some time alone, Tsjancy severed his own hand with a hidden boot knife, freeing himself, and transformed into a serpent to escape between the bars.

He spent some months afterwards hiding from all mages to the best of his ability, but then was caught and slain by [[Urboltar Highymhelver]], who mployed a ''[[spellseeking worm]]'' to do it.
