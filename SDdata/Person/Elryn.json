Immediately after teleporting, they came to a shrine of [[Shar]] near [[the Dead Place]], where they picked up the woodsman [[Uldus Blackram]] and had him work as their guide.\n\nCoercion became necessary, and Uldus Blackram led them with a sword and knife to his back, as well as a noose tied around his neck to make sure he didn't miss any reminders. During the first leg of their trip, they came across [[Ilbryn Starym]], an [[elven]] [[wizard]], and quickly turned violent; though Ilbryn escaped, he first slew Uldus Blackram, and one of the Dreadspells, Iyrindyl, was slain during the fight.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|696-698|17}}\n\nOnce they found the ruin, Karsus' Keep and Vaelam stumbled upon the way to access the inside, Elryn led the looting.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|725-726|19}} Once their looted magic failed against Azuth, despite bringing down the ruin, they fled.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|730-731|19}}\n\nWhen Dread Sister [[Klalaera]] appeared and herded them back against Azuth, they were stopped partway by [[Umbregard]] and [[Starsunder]], two mages that appeared suddenly. During the battle, they were eliminated one by one, until Elryn alone remained; he was slain by a third archmage, [[Tenthar Taerhamoos]] of the [[Phoenix Tower]]."
