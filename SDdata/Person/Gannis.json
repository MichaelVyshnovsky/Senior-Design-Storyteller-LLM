        "mainbody": "Gannis was a human conman active throughout the taverns of the Sword Coast in the late 15 century DR. He adopted different surnames and backstories in each city to which he traveled.\nIn Baldurs Gate, Gannis posed as a merchant named Gannis Tath seeking to raise funds for an expedition to Chult. He sold false gemstones to patrons at the Low Lantern, and claimed to introduce his marks to a Chultan tradition that bound them in an unbreakable trust. By the time that he was outed as an imposter by Artus Cimber, he had already fled Baldurs Gate. A vengeful kenku assassin soon pursued him.\nIn Waterdeep, he adopted the identity of Gannis Frostmantle and claimed to be an emissary of the Tuigan working to undermine demonic forces. He used this story to woo Iokaste Daliano, the proprietor of the Pink Flumph, and conned her out of a great deal of coin. She ultimately realized that he was lying when he failed to recognize traditional foods of the Endless Wastes, and she and her companion Wishes drove him out of town using illusions to make him believe that the gods of the Tuigan were angry with him. He fled from there to Luskan.\nIn Luskan, he claimed to be Gannis Redthumb, a fugitive nobleman from Damara fleeing from persecution. He settled in at One-Eyed Jax and convinced drunk patrons to buy the seeds of peaches and strawberries that he claimed to be magically hardy and resistant to winter snow. However, it was here that the kenku assassin from Baldurs Gate caught up to him, and he wound up dead in the mouth of the River Mirar."
