Nanteuil was a dwarf cleric in Daggerford around 1370 DR.
Nanteuil drank heavily as a younger man, resulting in the accidental death of a young half-elf woman. He was sentenced to 85 years of hard work for his crime. To made amends, he stopped drinking and encouraged others to also stop. He tried many times to convince the duke to ban alcohol from Daggerford. The militia suspected him of the attempted arson of one of the local taverns.
He lived in a house in the southeast section of Daggerford located at the intersection of Kaoth Alley and Water Street near the River Gate.
