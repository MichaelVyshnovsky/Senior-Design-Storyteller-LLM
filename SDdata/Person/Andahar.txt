'''Andahar''' was a [[unicorn]] that could be summoned by [[Drizzt Do'Urden]].

==Description==
Drizzt possessed a horn charm on a silver chain. When blown into, the charm summoned Andahar who appeared, running and gradually growing in size, from another dimension. However, unlike Drizzt's other magical companion, [[Guenhwyvar]], Andahar was mortal and could be wounded. He could be summoned at any time for a limited amount of time.

Andahar was 17 hands tall. He had a white coat of fur, an ivory horn tipped with a golden point, and blue piercing eyes.

==History==
The ruling council of [[Silverymoon]] commissioned Andahar as a mount for Drizzt in gratitude for his work during the [[Third Orc War]].
