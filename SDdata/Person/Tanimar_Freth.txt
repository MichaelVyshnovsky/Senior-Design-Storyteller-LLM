'''Tanimar Freth''' was a [[drow]] warrior of [[House Freth]] inside [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Activities==
As second-boy of his House, Tanimar led the warriors against their enemies of [[House Auvryndar]] but he lost his right eye. Around the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], Tanimar together with his younger brother [[Xaphtal Freth]] controlled the gate to the Freth complex in the [[Maze Level]].
