{{quote|''An excellent choice, my Lady. You'll find that I offer many things not to be found elsewhere in Athkatla... and if they are, you 'll not find them at a lower price.''|Arledrian}}

==Possessions==
Typically for a man of his skills, Arledrian wore [[studded leather]] [[armor]] and was armed with an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[short sword]] as well as a simple [[shortbow]]. He also carried a ''[[potion of invisibility]]'' and a ''[[potion of extra Healing]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Arledrian could be found in Gaelan Bayle's Shadow Thieves' safehouse. On the house's second floor, Arledrian sold his wares to allies of the guild, acquired from undisclosed sources.
