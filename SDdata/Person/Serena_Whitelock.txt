'''Serena Whitelock''' was the only [[half-elf]] councilor serving on the [[Dale Council]] in [[High Dale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was known as a practical woman who always seemed to have a disagreeable expression on her face. In addition to her civic duties to the dale, Serena owned one of its largest sheep pastures.
