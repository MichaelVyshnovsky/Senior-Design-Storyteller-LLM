'''Mara''' was the chef of the [[Bubbling Cauldron]] tavern in the village of [[Hilltop]]. 

==History==
In [[1372 DR]] after a [[kobold]] attack on Hilltop, Mara was taken hostage in the tavern's kitchen by a small group of kobolds led by [[Hurc]], who had been separated from the main attack force.

==Gameplay==
*In the official campaign of the computer game ''[[Neverwinter Nights: Shadows of Undrentide]]'', the player can receive a quest from [[Lodar]] to free Mara the Chef from the kobolds.
