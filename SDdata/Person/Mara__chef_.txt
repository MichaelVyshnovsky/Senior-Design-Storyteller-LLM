Mara was the chef of the Bubbling Cauldron tavern in the village of Hilltop. 
In 1372 DR after a kobold attack on Hilltop, Mara was taken hostage in the taverns kitchen by a small group of kobolds led by Hurc, who had been separated from the main attack force.
*In the official campaign of the computer game Neverwinter Nights Shadows of Undrentide, the player can receive a quest from Lodar to free Mara the Chef from the kobolds.
