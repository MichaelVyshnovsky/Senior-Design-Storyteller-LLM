'''Morista Malkin''' was a scout and a member of the [[Emerald Enclave]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Morista hailed from [[Luruar]] but responded to Bruenor's call to liberate [[Gauntlgrym]] from evil in the {{YearlinkName|1485}}. After the victory, she acted as an advisor to King Bruenor. She also trained elite scouts to move in the dark recesses of the [[Underdark]].

Morista was chosen as the Emerald Enclave's delegate to King [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] to discuss the madness spreading in the [[Underdark]] ''circa'' [[1486 DR]].

==Personality==
Morista always tried to balance her loyalties to her people and king and to nature. She believed her duty was to protect dwarves from the dangers of the Underdark, but also to remind them of its natural beauty. Morista admired and respected King Bruenor.
