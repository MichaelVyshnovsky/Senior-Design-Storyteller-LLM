        "mainbody": "Gaundos was a strange illusionist and follower of Leira inhabiting Waterdeep, City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nGaundos went to extremes to ensure that no one knew anything about him including what he really looked like, where he lived, etc. He employed the change self spell frequently to disguise his appearance, usually several times per day. Gaundos could be contacted via the bartender Elgorel, whom he spoke often with, at the Swords Rest tavern in Waterdeeps Southern Ward. He would tutor others in the use of magic and cast spells for a fee in order to raise money to further his own pursuit of illusion magic.\nGaundos always wore a necklace of missiles for protection."
