Along with Yhekal, Zarud plotted a large attack in order to enslave the Bedine people. The pair managed to gain [[magic]] control over Sheikh [[Sabkhat]] of the [[Mtair Dhafir]] tribe. While on the face of things Zarud appealed to the sheikh under the guise of friendship, bringing them a treaty was was supposedly mutually advantageous, Zarud actually compelled him to welcome the Zhentilar to their camp with open arms.\n\nThe plot was uncovered by the sheikh's daughter [[Ruha]], the [[Harper]] agent [[Lander]], and the tribe's strongest warrior [[Al'Aif]]; but Zarud's magic continued to hold sway over Sabkhat and the sheikh did not cast away the Zhent mercenaries.\n\nDuring the night following Zarud and Sabkhat's discussions, the Zhent agent was slain by Lander, the only other outlander in the Bedine camp."
