'''Barim Stagwinter''' was one of the rulers of [[Boareskyr Bridge]] in [[1359 DR]].

==Activities==
Based in Boareskyr Bridge, Barim, together with [[Theskul Mirroreye]], became one of the ''de facto'' rulers of that place, protecting it from [[troll]]s, brigands, [[wolves]], and worse, which attacked during winters. He sponsored and directed some adventuring parties to expel [[serpentfolk]] from the [[Serpent Hills]]. He supported Theskul in his project to built a shrine to [[Tyr]] in exchange for support to build a castle and the title of Baron of Boareskyr for Barim.
