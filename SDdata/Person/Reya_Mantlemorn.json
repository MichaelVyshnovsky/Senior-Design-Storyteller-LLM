        "Personality": "She was a dutiful soldier who held the [[Creed Resolute]] close to her heart. Reya was impassioned about her home city of [[Elturel]], and did everything in her power to defend its people.",
        "History": "Reya was born in the land of [[Turmish]], but came to the city of Elturel when she was twelve, so that she could train as a Hellrider.\n\nWhen the city of Elturel was transported to Avernus in the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} Reya was training a few miles north of the city when it vanished, to her horror. Returning to the site of the city, she found only a gigantic crater, and decided to lead some refugees to the shelter of [[Baldur's Gate]].\n\nOnce inside the city, Reya was separated from the other refugees after a group of [[Flaming Fist]] thugs confronted them. She was able to shake one off, and fled into the city in disguise. While on the run from the law, she began to look into the whereabouts of [[Thavius Kreeg]] and his association with the [[Vanthampur]] [[patriar family]]."
