Antriera a priestess of the Church of Chauntea active in Triel during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Antriera was stubborn, quietly helping the populace with travelers with her healing skills despite Elvar, the local ruler, changing faiths almost every tenday.
She would always burn the priestly vestments of Loviatar bought by Elvar, because he looks ridiculous in them and because she feared he might find creative ways to use the whip and chains they came with.
