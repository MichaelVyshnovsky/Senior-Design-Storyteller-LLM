'''Miriam''' was an innkeep who inhabited [[Caer Corwell]] on the island of [[Gwynneth]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Miriam owned [[the Red Stag]] inn. Her establishment was nice and quiet, especially compared to [[the Boar's Tusk]] which was quite rowdy. Miriam lived in [[Waterdeep]] before relocating to the Moonshae Isles.
