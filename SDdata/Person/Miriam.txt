Miriam was an innkeep who inhabited Caer Corwell on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Miriam owned the Red Stag inn. Her establishment was nice and quiet, especially compared to the Boars Tusk which was quite rowdy. Miriam lived in Waterdeep before relocating to the Moonshae Isles.
