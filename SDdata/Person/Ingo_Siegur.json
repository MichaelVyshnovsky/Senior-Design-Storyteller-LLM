        "mainbody": "ngo Siegur was a scout of the Purple Dragons of Cormyr of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nAlthough Ingo enjoyed hunting, falconry, and tracking, he didnt actually want to remain in the wilderness after he retired, instead preferring city life. Thus he returned to the capital city of Suzail, where he had been raised.\nLong retired by 1379 DR, Ingo found love in the form of a \"Mirtulâ€“Eleint infatuation\" with the beautiful young Fadlimi. She persistently asked him for tales of his military career, and he shared knowledge of Purple Dragons tactics, formations, sites of caches of supplies and weapons, passwords, and more. Ingo didnt suspect she was anything more than an innocent admirer and couldnt believe she might betray him. He would react violently if told she was, say, a doppelganger spy."
