        "mainbody": "'''Ingo Siegur''' was a scout of the [[Purple Dragons]] of [[Cormyr]] of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|48}}",
        "History": "Although Ingo enjoyed hunting, falconry, and tracking, he didn't actually want to remain in the wilderness after he retired, instead preferring city life. Thus he returned to the capital city of [[Suzail]], where he had been raised.\n\nLong retired by [[1379 DR]], Ingo found love in the form of a \"[[Mirtul]]â€“[[Eleint]] infatuation\" with the beautiful young [[Fadlimi]]. She persistently asked him for tales of his military career, and he shared knowledge of Purple Dragons tactics, formations, sites of caches of supplies and weapons, passwords, and more. Ingo didn't suspect she was anything more than an innocent admirer and couldn't believe she might betray him. He would react violently if told she was, say, a [[doppelganger]] spy."
