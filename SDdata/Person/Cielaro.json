        "mainbody": "Cielaro was a minor noble from the Harvestshield Mountain region in the Sword Coast North. As of the late 15 century DR, she had been transformed into a vampire spawn and dwelt in the Heartcoil Deeps.\nShe was known to be irreverent and foolish prior to her transformation into a vampire spawn.\nCielaro was very close to Elcharn, another minor Harvestshield noble who shared her interests.While the exact relationship between Cielaro and Elcharn is not specified in Warriors of Waterdeep, it is strongly implied that they were romantic partners. Cielaro and Elcharn were known to cause small scandals in their noble circles by foregoing banquets in order to go hunt monsters.\nCielaro and Elcharn were enamored with the legends of Bellorath, a rebel who was driven from Chaunteas Citadel atop Harvestshield Mountain and disappeared into the Heartcoil Deeps. The two of them believed a theory that Bellorath had sought out fiendish power after being exiled, and they became obsessed with discovering what had happened to him. Thus, the two of them travelled to the Heartcoil Deeps, but were never seen again on the surface.\nThe two of them explored much of the Deeps, even managing to get all the way into the territory of the reclusive stone giant clan who dwelt in its deepest depths. As they went, Cielaro recorded their experiences in her journals while Elcharn sketched a map. Eventually, they succeeded in their mission to find Bellorath, but discovered that they were correct about his mission for fiendish power Bellorath had transformed into a minotaur, and clashed with the two nobles. After their last battle with him, Cielaro and Elcharn became separated.\nLost and without her partner, Cielaro despaired of ever returning to the surface. It was at this time that she discovered that the Heartcoil Deeps were a nexus for dark powers when she was approached by a vampire and transformed into a spawn. Upon discovering her fate, Elcharn despaired but refused to accept that he could not save her, however he too would become undead instead and they were again separated.\nEventually, Cielaro was abandoned in the Heartcoil Deeps by the vampire who had sired her. Her fate remained a mystery to the outside world until the late 15 century DR when a group of adventurers discovered her journals and then encountered her in battle."
