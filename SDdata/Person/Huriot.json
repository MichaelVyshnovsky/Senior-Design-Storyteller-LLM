        "mainbody": "uriot was a notorious thief and follower of Mask who inhabited the city of Skuld in Mulhorand during the 9 century DR.\nHuriot came into possession of a magic item called the dice of chancelessness. Huriet was captured in Skuld and convicted of robbing graves. When brought to the pharoah for final justice, he convinced the ruler to let his fate be decided by diceâ€“if Huriot won the game of chance then he would be sold into slavery, if he lost then he would be executed. The pharoah divined the nature of Huriots magical dice and used his powers to reverse their effect, resulting in Huriot living the rest of his days as a slave."
