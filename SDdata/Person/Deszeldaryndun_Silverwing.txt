Deszeldaryndun Silverwing, the Guardian Wyrm of Everlund, was an ancient silver dragon who inhabited the Floating Mountain, an enormous hollow rock that hovered above the woods east and south of Everlund.
Deszeldaryndun was known to employ a variety of magics that were devised and gifted to him by Valamaradace, including the spells gentle breath, guardian trumpet, and icy claw.
Deszeldaryndun spent much of his time in human form in the western forests of Everlund, going by aliases such as Ergoth Falaer or Drouth Sammart. However, he was also known to disguise himself as powerful and influential individuals when the need arose, most notably Khelben Arunsun and Elminster. He was also known to take up the guise of Alustriel Silverhand when engaging in covert business with the Harpers or Chosen, especially in situations where an attempt on her life was likely. If not disguised as her himself, Deszeldaryndun was known to accompany Alustriel in both her palace and outside the city in the guise of a cloaked swordsman named Talyn.
Deszeldaryndun rarely ever went out hunting for food, having cultivated caverns of edible fungi and pools of fish. When he did take to the skies, it was usually to remove troublesome creatures from his domain. His favorite animals to hunt for were hippogriffs, as well as deers and horses within the High Forest.
Deszeldarynduns consort for over a thousand years was the gold dragon wyrm Valamaradace.
During the Rage of Dragons of 1373 DR, Deszeldaryndun and Valamaradace were driven to attack each other by the ensuing madness. Only the intervention of Alustriel Silverhand prevented them from murdering each other, and for their gratitude they pledged to watch over the Silver Marches.
