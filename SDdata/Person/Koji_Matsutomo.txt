'''Koji Matsutomo''' was a head of the [[Matsutomo]] clan and a [[daimyo]] of [[Aru Province]] in [[Wa]] in the mid-1600s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==History==
In {{YearlinkConvert|1640|WY}}, the [[shogun]] returned Aru Province to the Matsutomo clan, appointing Koji Matsutomo as daimyo. A weak man, Koji was liked by peasants but hated by rival nobles who'd moved to Aru. He survived two attempted coups in {{YearlinkConvert|1645|WY}} and {{YearlinkConvert|1649|WY}}, and thereafter focused only on protecting himself and his clan.

As a result, he neglected the province's administration and corruption got out of control. When in {{YearlinkConvert|1652|WY}} the annual shipment of tax payments at [[Uwaji]] was 30% less than reported on the manifest, Koji and the Matsutomos were removed, with the province passed to the [[Kubahachi]] clan.This may be in error: Uwaji was not the capital of Wa at the time, instead, [[Iiso]] was.
