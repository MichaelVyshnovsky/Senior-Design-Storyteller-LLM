Koji Matsutomo was a head of the Matsutomo clan and a daimyo of Aru Province in Wa in the mid-1600s on the Wa Calendar.
In , the shogun returned Aru Province to the Matsutomo clan, appointing Koji Matsutomo as daimyo. A weak man, Koji was liked by peasants but hated by rival nobles whod moved to Aru. He survived two attempted coups in  and , and thereafter focused only on protecting himself and his clan.
As a result, he neglected the provinces administration and corruption got out of control. When in  the annual shipment of tax payments at Uwaji was 30% less than reported on the manifest, Koji and the Matsutomos were removed, with the province passed to the Kubahachi clan.This may be in error Uwaji was not the capital of Wa at the time, instead, Iiso was.
