        "mainbody": "'''Elsura Dauniir''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]] and later a field agent of the [[Moonstars]] for [[northwest Faer√ªn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "She had the unique ability to transform herself into a black [[cat]] at will.",
        "History": "Elsura was born in [[Silverymoon]], with her father [[Aumar the Lion]] a guardscaptain in the [[spellguard]], and she grew up in the company of [[elves]] and [[Harpers]]. As teenager, she joined the [[archmage]] [[Tasirin]], becoming his cook and companion. One night Elsura vanished and she reappeared only a year later at her father's funeral in the form of a cat.\n\nAt this point Lady [[Alustriel]] offered her to be tutored in magic by [[Harper]] wizards and Elsura agreed. For a time she was the student of the adventuress [[Sharanralee]].\n\nAfterward Elsura went to [[Myth Drannor]] and tried to build there a refuge for herself and her friends.\n \nIn the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, she was chosen as a field agent of the Moonstars for [[the North]]; she was quite famous in the region and some people, especially in [[Luskan]], spoke of being \"clawed by Elsura\" to indicate an unexpected and often deadly surprise.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, she was among the many powerful mages [[Khelben Arunsun]] brought together in order to cleanse part of the [[High Moor]] and restore [[Faer'tel'miir]], a lost city of [[Miyeritar]].<ref>",
        "Personality": "Elsura was said to have the same personality as a cat. She hated slavers and those how hunted for sport. Elsura was shy, moody and very slow to trust someone."
