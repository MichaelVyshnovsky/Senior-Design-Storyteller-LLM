        "mainbody": "Onglore was a brave dwarven lord and brother of Inglore who perished in the Weeping War of Myth Drannor. His abandoned body was transformed into a ghast who survived for centuries after the citys destruction.\nOnglore prided himself on charging first into battle and was a devoted follower of Haela Brightaxe.\nThe dwarven lords prized possession was the Onglores amulet of war, a pendant blessed by Haela Brightaxe, that he wore in life and after he was laid to rest in his coffin.\nOnglore and his brother Inglore died defending Myth Drannor during the last months of the Weeping War. Their bodies were placed in coffins and opened for the surviving dwarves to pay respects in the Main Halls of the Dwarven Dungeons. When the survivors of the War retreated from the fallen city, the Dwarven Dungeons were sealed, and the bodies of the dwarven siblings were left un-entombed.\nIn 1369 DR, when the Cult of the Dragon was occupying the ruins of Myth Drannor, a group of heroes from Phlan discovered two dwarven brothers locked in the same room their bodies were displayed but in a state of undeath and frenzied hunger. The ghast brothers were destroyed by the adventurers, granting them the peace of death."
