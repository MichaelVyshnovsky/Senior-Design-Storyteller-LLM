'''Ophinshtalajiir Perra''' was a [[dragonborn]] member of [[Clan Ophinshtalajiir]] who served as the ambassador of [[Tymanther]] in [[Chessenta]] as [[1479 DR]].

==Description==
Perra was tall and gaunt. Her brown scales where speckled with white due to her old age.

==Relationships==
Perra was clan-kin of [[Yrjixtilex Kallan]].

==Abilities==
For someone of her age, Perra was strong enough to easily handle the big [[greatsword]] only high-ranking [[Thymari]] were allowed to use and to stand on her own against multiple enemies.

==History==
In 1479 DR, Perra was sent to [[Luthcheq]] in order to improve the diplomatic relationship between Chessenta and Tymanther.

During the travel back home, a [[Topaz dragon|topaz]] ''taaldarax'' (one of the players of [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]'s ''[[xorvintaal]]'') attacked Perra and her delegation, but with the help of [[Daardendrien Balasar|Balasar]], the [[paladin]] [[Daardendrien Medrash|Medrash]], [[Khouryn Skulldark]] and his [[Brotherhood of the Griffon|men]], the dragonborn were able to drive away the dragon.

After the [[Battle of Luthcheq]], Perra was reinstated as the ambassador with Chessenta, a position she still held in [[1487 DR]].
