'''Kheldivur''' was a veteran battle-mage. At some point prior to the {{yearlinkName|1318}}, he was killed somewhere in [[Chessenta]] during a war between [[wizard]]s in sight of a young [[Maldiglas Turntower]]. Glittering [[ring]]s remained on his hand. The young man snatched what he could from Kheldivur's charred corpse before it cooled down, kickstarting his own career as a wizard.
