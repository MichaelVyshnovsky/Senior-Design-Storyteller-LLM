'''Radom''' was the last member of the [[dukar]] [[Order of Jhimari]] in [[Myth Nantar]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Radom was an ancient member of the Jhimari dukars at the time of the fall of [[Nantarum]] in {{Yearlink|-220}}. Somehow, he ended up as a coral statue inside the city's Coliseum.

In 1370 DR, Radom returned to life and quickly adapted to the modern era. His goal was to resurrect his order with the help of [[Qos]]. Despite looking like a young elf, his 1,000 years of isolation greatly aged his spirit.
