'''Priam''' was a caravan guard. He was a lanky man with a fierce trap of a mouth, admired for his courage.{{cite book/The Rage||4}} when he discovered a [[Flight of Dragons]]. Though frightened, he kept his wits about himself, and led the caravan to hide in the tall grass. Though most of the flight passed it by, they were then attacked by a hungry [[red dragon]]. [[Janx]] suggested they scatter, but Priam talked him out of it: both were slain by the dragon, which then killed the rest of the caravan. The only survivor was a badly maimed, 9-year old [[Dorn Graybrook]].{{cite book/The Rage||Prologue}}
