        "mainbody": "ortas was a farmer of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe was an old man with wrinkles around his eyes.\nHe had a wife and was drinking buddies with Rob and Will.\nOn Eleasias 16 in the , Farmer Bortas and his wife were out at night with their wagon and horse Ned when they saw the ghost of the bandit chieftain Fastred. They fled to the Swamp Rat tavern and raised a posse of fellow farmers like Rob and Will and returned to the scene, but the ghost had vanished and they didnt dare venture into the Vast Swamp. His wife continued to have nightmares about it.\nLater that year, on Eleint 17, Jasper went to the Swamp Rat tavern and met Bortas, as well as Rob and Will. He bought them Shadowdark ale and asked about the ghost sighting, after it was discovered to be Dovo in disguise, who was found dead. Bortas provided a full account, but no new information.\nTwo nights later, on Eleint 19, Bortas, Rob, and Will came out of the Swamp Rat and saw Jasper and a group of townsfolk escorted by the Purple Dragons to Benelaiuss house for the investigation into Dovos murder. Bortas thought they were going to a party, and apparently a rather grim one."
