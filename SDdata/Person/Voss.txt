Kithrak Voss was a githyanki knight who traversed the planes in service of the githyanki queen Vlaakith.
Voss had no mercy, and let nothing stand in the way of his mission.
He led a number of githyanki warriors, including Sarth Baretha, Gish Forreth, and Raider Chost. He claimed as his steed a ferocious red dragon called Qudenos.
Voss was widely believed to have killed Orpheus at the end of the War of the Comet. In truth, Orpheus survived, albeit imprisoned within the Astral Prism. After the war, Voss maintained a façade of loyalty to Vlaakith, but secretly sought to free Orpheus and end Vlaakiths reign.
In the Faerûn , Voss and his fellow knights began pursuit of an illithid nautiloid, in search of the prism. Mounted atop their red dragon steeds, the knights traveled to the planet of Toril over the city of Yartar, to the Nine Hells on the planes of Cania and Avernus, and again back to Toril in the region of the Sword Coast.
Just beyond their crèche, Voss and his knights began to patrol a stretch of the Risen Road. There they encountered a group of Flaming Fist mercenaries, who they then killed without a second thought.
