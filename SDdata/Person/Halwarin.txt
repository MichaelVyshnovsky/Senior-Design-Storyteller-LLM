adventurer
Halwarin was a priest of Bane and member of the Zhentarim who led the Holy Keep of Bane in the city of Bral on the Rock of Bral in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
A former adventurer, Halwarin established the Holy Keep in the mid-1300s DR. He was committed to spreading the Banite faith to the stars, but after eight years it remained a lesser faith in Bral, and this was not aided by the god himself being inconveniently dead.
Nevertheless, in the 1360s DR members of the Tenth Pit on Bral contacted Halwarin they sought to use the Banite faith to gain power, but Halwarin would not yoke Banes cause to theirs.
