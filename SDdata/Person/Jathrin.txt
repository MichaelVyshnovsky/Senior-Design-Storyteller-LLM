Jathrin was a criminal whose execution gave name to the town of Jathrins Jump in Turmish.
Jathrin was a highly intelligent and slim human male,  tall. In his undead form, he was seen wearing ripped leather armor and carrying a lit ghostly torch.
Long before the late-14 century DR, a criminal named Jathrin was executed via being tossed off a cliff. With time, a smuggling stop grew into a relatively lawless town that took its name from the criminal â€“ Jathrins Jump.
Circa the , Jathrins ghost started appearing on the cliff of Jathrins Jump. The apparition returned to the Prime Material plane to guard loot he stashed away before the execution. His haunting was not to bring justice for his heath, nor caused by a disturbed burial ground. The ghost of Jathrin was guided by hate for all living, whom he blamed for the undead state. He attacked the living in sinister silence targeting lone travelers rather than well-outfitted adventuring bands. At times when he encountered individuals who were able to damage his incorporeal form, Jathrin always fled. His main weapon was his ghostly aging gaze.
