Qaxdivak was a mutant ixzan cleric and a member of theÂ Xendreth, the ruling council of Malydren, as well as a priest of Ilxendren in 1370 DR.
Although small in size, Qaxvidak made up for it by being highly cunning. He possessed a surprising degree of influence over his fellow councilors by subtly playing each against the others and taking advantage of their weaknesses.
Qaxdivak was an albino mutation but had a higher than normal natural magic resistance for his kind.
