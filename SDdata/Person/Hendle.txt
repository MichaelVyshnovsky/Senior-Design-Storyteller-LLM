'''Hendle''' was a druid from [[Rashemen]] and an old member of the [[Emerald Enclave]] in [[1489 DR]].

==Personality==
Hendle was saddened by the loss of [[treant]]s in forests.

==History==
In 1489 DR, he was the Emerald Enclave delegate sent to help a hired adventuring party to defeat the great dragon [[Claugiyliamatar]] of [[Kryptgarden Forest]]. The Enclave's main objectives were not to destroy the forest in the midst of the battle against the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and to ask the help of the [[fey]] lords of the forest.{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|8-9}}
