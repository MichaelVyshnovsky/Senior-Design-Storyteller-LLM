'''Harlyn Grimmerhand''' was a moneylender, and a retired adventurer from [[Daerlun]]{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Adventures|82}} who was also a member of the [[Men of the Basilisk]], an all-male secret society. He was also an infiltrator in the [[Cult of the Dragon]], where he had gained the rank of [[Wearer of Purple]] during the late 14{{th}} century DR.

==Activities==
Publicly, Harlyn Grimmerhand bred horses and tutored warriors to entertain himself.{{cite polyhedron/142/Men of the Basilisk|26}}{{cite book/Cloak & Dagger|137}}

He had also been secretly sent by the [[Octad]] to infiltrate the [[Cult of the Dragon]], where he had gained the rank of [[Wearer of Purple]] for the ruined keep of [[Battlegate]]. Under his leadership, the Cult of the Dragon was used to guard the [[Auantiver Labyrinth]].

==History==
In {{yearlink|1370}}, he received approval from the brotherhood to send adventurers after the [[red dragon]] [[Nevalarich]]. This required careful deliberation, once he discovered that it was acting as an agent of [[Aurgloroasa]].{{cite polyhedron/142/Men of the Basilisk|27}}

==Possessions==
Harlyn's holdings were known to be guarded by [[golem]]s.

==Relationships==
Harlyn was said to have worse pets and allies than golems.
