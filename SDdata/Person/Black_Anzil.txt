'''Black Anzil''' was a feared and infamous pirate from [[Turmish]] who prowled the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in the early 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Black Anzil was a follower of the legendary [[Immurk|Immurk the Invincible]], the Great Pirate, sailing as part of his fleet of 100 ships based at [[Dragonisle]]. However, after Immurk's death in the {{yearlinkName|1201}}, a half-dozen rival pirates each claimed to be Immurk's successor and broke the fleet apart between them and turned on each other in the [[Pirate Wars]]. Black Anzil rose to prominence in this period.<ref group="note">While it is only known that Anzil appeared at this time, it may be assumed he was previously a follower of Immurk and may have been one of the rival claimants. This is supported by Anzil having Immurk's shield.

In the {{YearlinkName|1206}}, Black Anzil was recorded to be in the possession of ''Jhalanrojir'', the shield of Immurk himself. However, he later lost it and three more pirates would wield the ''Pirateshield'' even before Black Aznil died in the {{YearlinkName|1218}}.

==Possessions==
Anzil was notably an owner of ''[[Jhalanrojir]]'', the ''Pirateshield'', a magical shield.

==Activities==
One of the cruelest pirates of his day, Black Anzil had his captured foes covered in [[pitch]], and then lit on fire.
