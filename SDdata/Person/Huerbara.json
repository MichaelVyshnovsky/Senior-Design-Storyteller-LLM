        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, during the hunt for [[Elminster]], Huerbara was speaking with [[Neleyd]] when the elder [[Bheloris]] approached them, proposing to hatch a plan together to increase the chance of their success in the hunt.\n\nLater, during [[Dhalgrave]]'s absence, she was chosen by the temporary leader [[Milhvar]] to go with [[Kuervyn]] and [[Andraut]] to [[Silverymoon]] to kill Lady [[Alustriel Silverhand]]. However, they were easily discovered by the palace's staff and killed.\n\nHowever, Huerbara alone had managed to survive and escaped and hid. After Dhalgrave's death at the hands of Elminster, she was elected as the new Shadowmaster High with the support and teaching of [[Hulurran]] and [[Gathran]] and proclaimed she would move more carefully.",
