        "mainbody": "'''Alustriel''', more commonly known by her nickname, '''Triel''', was a female [[faerie dragon]] that imprisoned the [[wizard]]-murderer [[Maddgoth]] in his [[Maddgoth's Castle|own castle]] in [[Undermountain]] and made it her home in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, alongside her mate, [[Ottolenszillasla|Otto]].",
        "Description": "Triel seemed to be about {{SI|13'|ft-in|long=yes}} tall to any shrunken individuals within Maddgoth's Castle, but was, normally, around {{SI|1'1\"|ft-in|c|long=yes}}. Besides her growth to this size, Triel appeared much as she did at birth. She was a very silvery faerie dragon, so much so that her scales had a vaguely reflective quality about them, and had thin, translucent wings of an aquamarine coloration that matched the icy blue of her eyes. Once she made her home in Maddgoth's Castle, she took to wearing a signet [[ring]] around her back right leg, matching with Otto as though it were a marital one.",
        "Personality": "{{quote|''If ye step so much as an inch closer, ye'll be wearing the daftest looks on yuir faces for the rest of yuir lives! I'm not as kind a host as me mate, and I've no patience for nosy adventurers of any size, at least, not now.''|Triel, when encountered by a group of adventurers in Maddgoth's laboratory}} \nTriel, though she had her bouts of overreaction, was generally of a cheery disposition. Any emotion she felt, she felt strongly, so it was difficult for her expressions to remain stoic when they so easily displayed her feelings. This characteristic passion extended to her whole body language, as she was known to flutter without restraint when happy or, when anxious, to rapidly hit her tail against things. She also had a slapstick sense of humor, but if ever her jokes led to genuine discomfort, Triel was just as quick to share an earnest apology.  \n\nThe faerie dragon, however, had a sharp change in personality during her stay in Undermountain. While she grew accustomed to motherhood, Triel took on a much more draconic temperament, becoming quick to anger and very defensive, particularly around her clutch of babes.",
        "Abilities": "Triel had all the natural abilities that came to faerie dragons, including a [[faerie dragon#Breath Weapon|paralyzing gas breath]], and, given that she towered over any foes within the size-shifting field around Maddgoth's Castle, these were only amplified. She had also learnt sufficient wizardly capabilities to be able to cast a few [[spells]], such as ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter|Tasha's uncontrollable hideous laughter]]'', and ''[[slow]]''.",
        "Possessions": "The signet ring that Triel wore was one of six, originally made by [[Chollas]] the Variant, that allowed her to activate the two-way ''[[gate]]'' between Maddgoth's Castle and the cellar of Chollas' home in Waterdeep. as well as claiming ownership over some of the possessions left behind by her close friend, [[Sandoth]], a collection that included a [[cursed]] ''[[hat of stupidity]]''.",
        "Activities": "Triel often ventured into Maddgoth's kitchen to forage for dried vegetables or spices. She found the place disgusting, magically burning some of the serial killer's leftovers and renouncing his filthy utensils, but the preserved foodstuffs she took to cook herself. Though she eventually planned to find fresher food up above in [[Waterdeep]] once she had taken sufficient vengeance on Maddgoth, they also served to supplement the food that her husband provided using magic. As an extension of these motherly duties, and to help lift her spirits, she enjoyed discussing the nuances of comedy with her children as well as telling them jokes. \n\nWhen she was not occupied with her hatchlings, however, she also found the time to gleefully torment the trapped wizard, even, at one point, going as far as to fill his prison with water.",
        "Relationships": "Triel may never have known her true, biological family, but the bond she subsequently formed with Sandoth was like that between a father and a daughter. She was ready to depart [[Silverymoon]], where she had lived with him her entire life, to stay by his side, and was wracked by such anger at his death that she swore to take cruel vengeance upon his murderer: Maddgoth.\n\nFor this man, and his [[homunculi]], she had little sympathy, reveling in tormenting him or hunting down his companions whenever she got the chance. She insisted that, since he had taken so much from her and hers, it was only fair she return the favor in kind.  \n\nThe only responsibility she held above that was the one she had to her mate, Otto, and their two hatchling faerie dragon children. Though she could be overprotective, anything she perceived as a threat to their safety earned her enmity and was met by her ruthless claws.",
        "History": {
            "At Home in Silverymoon": "Triel was born ''circa'' [[1318 DR]] in the north of the [[High Forest]]. Her mother and her siblings, still in their eggs, were being used to nourish a young [[black dragon]], leaving only Triel to be hatched successfully after a party of [[adventurers]], known as the [[Moonsilver Corps]], slew it. The survivors of the fight found her right as she hatched, leading to Triel mistaking one, the apprentice wizard Sandoth the Laugher, as her father. He and his sole remaining companion, [[Gulland Stonefist]], took the strangely colored faerie dragon back with them to Silverymoon where they would raise her. Given her silver scales, her new caretaker, who so adored the silver-haired [[Alustriel Silverhand]], named the hatchling after her, though he never addressed her by her full name and instead preferred the shorter \"Triel\". \n\nDuring the intervening years, Triel and Sandoth greatly enjoyed each other's company. She grew to truly take on the role of his daughter rather than, as most people assumed, his familiar, with the two risking their lives for each other multiple times during their adventures. At some point, she also met and fell in love with Otto, much to her mage friend's chagrin, until sometime around [[1365 DR]], when she played a mutual prank on the pair that alleviated their jealousy. The three years that followed were some of the happiest in Triel's life, but this would not last long.",
            "Move to Waterdeep": "In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Sandoth decided that he would move to the city of Waterdeep, and both of his faerie dragon allies agreed to come with him. Despite the other two's excitement, however, Triel could not help her trepidation. She was reluctant to leave Silverymoon and, by extension, her namesake, whom she secretly believed was the reason for all of their success. Even so, she found it in herself to look forward to living in a new city, where she could comfortably hatch her eggs under the protection of both her loved ones, and the three were off. Unfortunately, soon enough, her fears were proven right: Sandoth was murdered just two days after their arrival in Waterdeep.\n\nThe pair of faerie dragons had been out leading Waterdeep's [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] on chases through the [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]] when, upon their return to their new home, they caught Maddgoth stealing materials from Sandoth's stores. Triel was so deeply enraged to see the serial killer's homunculi still maiming the corpse, She had injured the murderer all in the same motion, prompting him and his companions to run through their ''gate'' in the cellar back to Undermountain.",
            "Life in Undermountain": "Though shaken by the sudden change in surroundings, Triel and her mate were quick to leap back into action, paralyzing Maddgoth with their breaths and holding off his homunculi simultaneously, until Otto was able to properly capture their friend's murderer.\n\nTriel was not content with Waterdeep and reminisced about the sunlight up above, but while she made her home in Maddgoth's Castle, she began to be satisfied with, at the very least, the modicum of protection it provided for her new nest. This nest she made, primarily, after venting her frustrations on the wizard's laboratory and recovering segments of parchment she could use. She destroyed large parts of his equipment and his tomes, most of all the [[spellbook]]s he had stolen from his many victims. \n\nIt was on [[Eleint 16]] of the same year that her eggs finally hatched: one of standard red scales, while the other's matched her silver. At some point during her stay, she even began to sell off the various treasures Maddgoth had hoarded as a way to purchase Sandoth's property and keep the ''gate'' in its cellar hidden.\n\nAs of [[1374 DR]], Triel still made her lair in Maddgoth's Castle alongside Otto."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "After Sandoth's corpse was found, both Triel and Otto were being sought as possible witnesses to the crime, but, because of their disappearance, some Waterdhavians instead began to suspect that they were the ones guilty of his murder."
