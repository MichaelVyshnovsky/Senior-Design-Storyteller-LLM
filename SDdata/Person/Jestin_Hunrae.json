        "mainbody": "Jestin Hunrae was the proprietor of the Triglio general store in Targos in Icewind Dale in the late 15 century DR.\nOnce, he fished upon Maer Dualdon as many did in Targos, until a boat collision with rival fishermen from Termalaine crushed his left hand. He retired to land and was running the Triglio as of 1485 DR and through 1489 DR.\nHe was middle-aged and quite slender of frame, looking almost like a scarecrow."
