'''Maferil''' was a [[Wizard|mage]] rumored to have been studying the history of the [[Order of the Burning Dawn|Burning Dawn]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Maferil was notorious for writing everything down, and had a secret library in the ruins of [[Illusk]].

==History==
Maferil had an apprentice, [[Hommet Shaw]], but sent him to Neverwinter.

Around [[1490 DR]], Maferil was murdered; according to [[Dalanir Ch'fyr|Soronil Noonshadow]], this was presumably by the [[Arcane Brotherhood]].
