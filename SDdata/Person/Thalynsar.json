        "mainbody": "'''Thalynsar''' was an [[illithilich]] [[wizard]] and was once a leader of the [[illithid]] city of [[Ch'Chitl]] in the [[Northdark]] of the [[Underdark]].",
        "History": "Thalynsar was an [[ulitharid]] in Ch'Chitl in the midâ€“13{{th}} century [[DR]] when a raiding party of [[githyanki]] assaulted the city and mortally wounded the [[elder brain]]. Taking desperate measures, Thalynsar transformed himself and several other [[illithid]]s into [[lich]]es so they could devour the elder brain, preserve its knowledge and powers, and take its place.\n\nSuccessful in their endeavor, the illithiliches formed a [[Conclave of Elders]], with Thalynsar as the most powerful among them. He tried to retain much of the elder brain's knowledge for himself, but the excessive information steadily turned him insane. Nevertheless, Thalynsar ruled Ch'Chitl for over a hundred years.\n\nFinally, around [[1370 DR]], [[Aulagol]] and the other Elders united and were obligated to kill the insane Thalynsar. However, they struggled to lead in his place and divide the elder brain's lore."
