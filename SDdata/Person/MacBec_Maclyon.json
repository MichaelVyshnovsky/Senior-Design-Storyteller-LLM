It is unknown if this is an error or a deliberate change.",
        "History": "In the 1350s DR, MacBec Maclyon and his [[orc]] minions came to the long-abandoned [[Castle of Illusion]] in the [[Frost Hills]]. Maclyon meticulously unveiled the secrets of the Castle of Illusion and became its master, occupying it by [[1358 DR]]. He had his orc minions seal off the lower mines.\n\nHe was still in control through [[1370 DR]] and [[1372 DR]]. By then, he was known as \"Malcyon\" and had begun summoning [[fiend]]s to serve him and defend the Castle of Illusion. The wizard was not aware he was on his way to creating a second [[Hellgate Keep]].",
        "Relations": "MacBec was served by a retinue of thirty orcs, including a [[magic-user]] or mage, a [[fighter]] as his bodyguard, and an orcish [[witch doctor]].\n\nBy 1372 DR, Malcyon was frequently summoning dangerous [[fiend]]s and making deals with dark powers to gain ever-greater [[magic]]al knowledge. He had [[devil]]s teach him their dark arts, protect his castle, and patrol the surrounding lands.",
        "Personality": "He was a dour man."
