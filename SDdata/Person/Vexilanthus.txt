'''Vexilanthus''' was a [[Dragon aging|young]], male [[copper dragon]] that lived in the [[Savage Frontier]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
One day while flying lazily in circles over his domain, a group of [[adventurer]]s caught the attention of Vexilanthus. While conversing with him the adventurers mentioned that they were on the lookout for [[giant]]s. Vexilanthus informed the group that recently [[Moog|some hill giant]] had been prowling around a decrepit old tower, somewhere in the hills After pointing the adventurers in the direction of the tower, Vexilanthus offered to escort them to the nearest settlement for a fee of 500 or more [[gold piece]]s.
