Achen Dell was a mercenary who lived in the Realms during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He took on jobs that he believed would include fighting against forces of evil.
Achen owned an enchanted +1 longbow, a weapon he wielded with exceptional skill.
Archel Dell had a family that he cared for greatly.
At some point, Achen joined an adventuring group led by the elf known as Vail. The group assaulted the wizard Ramazith Flamesinger at tower in the Temples District of Baldurs Gate. He and his comrades were petrified by the gaze of a basilisk.
The stone forms of the adventurers were then sold as works of art to the Baldurian nobleman, Felonius Gist, and kept at his familys estate in the city.
