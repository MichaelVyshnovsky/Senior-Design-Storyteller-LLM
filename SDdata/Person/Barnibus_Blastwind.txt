Barnibus Blastwind was a special investigator of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors in Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR.
Barnibus, like his friend, the retired City Watch sergeant Saeth Cromley, wanted solid evidence and testimonies before ordering arrests. He preferred to not have unauthorized people in the crime scene.
Outside work, Barnibus lived in an estate in the Sea Ward that he inherited from his grandmother.
Barnibus was assigned to investigate all crimes involving magic in Waterdeep.
Sometimes, in difficult cases, he asked the help of his friend Saeth.
Barnibus and Sergeant Cromley had a working partnership.
In 1492 DR, Barnibus was called to investigate the blast that killed ten people in North Ward, including the gnome Dalakhar. He asked for the support of Saeth.
Later, Barnibus, with Saeth at his side, was called in to investigate the Gralhund Villa Bloodbath.
