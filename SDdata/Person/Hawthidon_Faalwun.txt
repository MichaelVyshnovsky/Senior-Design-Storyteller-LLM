==History==
During the [[Siege of Neverwinter]], in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Hawthidon recruited an adventurer to the Neverwinter Guard, and fought alongside them against the [[undead]] minions of [[Valindra Shadowmantle]].

Afterward, Hawthidon was part of the contingent gathered in the [[Blacklake District]] of the city to stop the [[Nashers]] rebel group. Sergeant [[Alphonse Knox]] sent an adventurer hunting for the Nasher thief [[Gothwan Cooper]], who was behind the theft of the ''[[Crown of Neverwinter]]'', to meet Hawthidon for information. Hawthidon sent the adventurer to Gothwan's known haunts to find clues, which showed he'd been kidnapped by the [[Dead Rats]]; then to retrieve him from the Dead Rats; and finally to work with Private [[Zoey Fargo]] to defeat Nasher leader [[Karzov]].
