{{Quote|''Your tools were stolen, right? No - you were mugged! Wait, I'm mixing you up terribly sorry; I'll - I'll get back to you.''|Manip Seyama}}

==Description==
Seyama had a fair complexion and had her graying hair fashioned into a high pompadour. She wore a Flaming Fist-embroiled [[leather armor]] and wielded a duo of [[axe]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Manip Seyama was stationed in the [[Basilisk Gate]]'s barracks and prison, serving under Blaze [[Liara Portyr]]. The Basilisk's Fang was tasked with collecting skyrocketing crime reports from the citizens of the Lower City. She also supervised the Basilisk Gate's prison and received prisoners scheduled for execution. Two such individuals were [[Durm Goroy]] and [[Vince Torell]]. Torell was accused of being a spy for [[the Absolute]] and treason, while Goroy was arrested after being accused of an assassination attempt on Lord [[Enver Gortash]]. Both were tried and condemned to public execution. [[Manip Farthingale]] of [[Stonyeyes]] sent a [[pigeon]] letter to Seyama, notifying her of the two prisoners being transferred soon to be publicly executed in the plaza in front of the gate.
