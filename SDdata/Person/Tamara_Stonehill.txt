'''Tamara Stonehill''' was the daughter of [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]] and [[Trilena Stonehill]], the proprietors of the [[Stonehill Inn]] in [[Phandalin]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Personality==
Tamara was precocious and perceptive. She talked freely, but only if she was not engrossed in some activity.

==Relationships==
Once each [[tenday]], Tamara accompanied her mother to the [[Shrine of Luck]] to pray to [[Tymora]]. She was well versed in the traditions of the shrine, and would offer her help if needed to Sister [[Garaele]].

In addition to her parents, Tamara had a brother named [[Pip Stonehill|Pip]].

==History==
In [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} when Tamara was ten years old, she and her mother witnessed a trio of [[goblin]]s cause the Shrine of Luck to collapse. Tamara helped clean up the rubble by searching for still-usable pieces of the structure, and by herself managed to surmise that the collapse had been caused by the removal of the central stone in the structure's archway.
