'''Olin Foolsgold''' was an [[alchemist]] who lived in the [[Cormyr]]ean village of [[Darkenshield]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Olin created the ''Formula For Vengeance'', a ritual which could summon vengeance upon the perpetrators of a crime.

When Darkenshield was attacked by the [[Twilight Brigade]] during [[Gondegal]]'s war in [[1352 DR]], he hid in the Village Meet with many of the villagers. When it became clear there was no escape, he distributed a poison to the young and elderly that painlessly slew them, then died fighting the raiders.
