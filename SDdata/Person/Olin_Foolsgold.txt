Olin Foolsgold was an alchemist who lived in the Cormyrean village of Darkenshield in the mid-14 century DR.
Olin created the Formula For Vengeance, a ritual which could summon vengeance upon the perpetrators of a crime.
When Darkenshield was attacked by the Twilight Brigade during Gondegals war in 1352 DR, he hid in the Village Meet with many of the villagers. When it became clear there was no escape, he distributed a poison to the young and elderly that painlessly slew them, then died fighting the raiders.
