        "mainbody": "ack the Gnome was a gnome wizard of the Silver Marches in the late 14 century DR.\nJack had lived in the Underdark for centuries and was at one time a student of illithids and demons in his search for greater magical knowledge. The illithids in particular taught him to escape the bounds of the corporeal and of the mortal.\nSometime in the mid-to-late 1200s DR, Jack had made some undetailed slight against Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon, which instilled a deep fear in the often-arrogant gnome.\nDuring the war started by Obould in the , after spotting the Lady of Silverymoon, he pleaded with his host to flee, claiming that she would recognize him and use all her might to destroy him.\nJack the Gnome was slain by Drizzt DoUrden.\nApparently, Jack was highly skilled at shape-changing. He often took the form of a winged snake to carry on his mischief and manipulations of the shamans of the half-orc, half-ogre tribe Clan Karuck, who resided beneath the Spine of the World in the upper reaches of the Underdark.\nJacks enchanted silk wizard robe was a magical robe that couldnt be soiled or dirtied in any way. It was taken from Jacks corpse by Drizzt as loot and given to Catti-brie."
