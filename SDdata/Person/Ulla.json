        "Activities": "Alongside [[Pog]], Ulla was one of Gnomengarde's sentries. It was her job to hail any outsiders in [[gnome language|Gnomish]], and to attack anyone she deemed to be a threat.",
        "Abilities": "In addition to her innate [[gnome|gnomish]] abilities, Ulla (like everyone else in Gnomengarde) had some training as a [[wizard]]. In combat, she preferred to attack with [[spells]] like ''[[ray of frost]]'' and ''[[magic missile]]''.",
        "History": "When Gnomengarde came under attack by a [[mimic]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the only information given to the gnomes by their king, [[Korboz]], was to attack any [[shapechanger]]s on sight. Unfortunately, this left Ulla and her partner Pog in a predicament because ''anyone'' could be a shapechanger. They were thus highly suspicious of any outsiders, and were unlikely to let anyone pass without a fight unless they could persuade the sentries otherwise or unless they had an audience with King Korboz or King [[Gnerkli]]."
