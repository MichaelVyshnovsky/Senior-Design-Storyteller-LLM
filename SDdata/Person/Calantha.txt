'''Calantha''' was a member of [[Ship Rethnor]] of [[Luskan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==History==
Calantha's family was from [[Waterdeep]], but as she did not get along with them, she eventually moved to Luskan, where she joined [[Ship Rethnor]]. She traveled a bit, but, finding life as a sailor hard, she ultimately found work as a night watchman at the docks.

Around [[1490 DR]], Calantha encountered the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]] in the [[Cutlass (inn)|Cutlass]] in Luskan.
