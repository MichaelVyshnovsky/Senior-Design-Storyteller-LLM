        "mainbody": "ranny Muyuk was a sea hag in the Thunder Cliff Caves in the late 15 century DR. She and her sisters Auntie Unk and Nana Pocktuss formed a sea hag coven.\nMuyuk was an alcoholic. She was bored with the fanatical Talos cultists she was allied with.\nMuyuk and her sisters ate the edible body parts of drowned sailors and animated the inedible body parts as skull fliers to protect their lair.\nThe Cult of Talos maintained a base of operations in the Thunder Cliff Caves. The sea hags had come to terms with the cultists and entered into a mutual-protection agreement. In addition, the followers of Talos provided the corpses of sailors who drowned after being shipwrecked on the magical reefs. In return, the coven assisted the cult with specific issues.\nCirca 1491 DR, the Thunder Cliff Caves were attacked by a group of adventurers. Their main objective was to defeat the Talos cultists but they also confronted Granny Muyuk and her sisters."
