'''Malchior''', usually known as '''Malchior of Darkhold''', was a [[cleric]] of [[Cyric]] and a member of the [[Zhentarim]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Personality==
Malchior's first and foremost loyalty was to himself, his god a distant second. His greed was matched only by his cunning. Malchior was a master manipulator who loved twisting others to his will.

==Relationship==
Machior had great influence over [[Dag Zoreth]] and [[Gareth Cormaeril]] thanks to a combination of blackmail and charisma.

==History==
Malchior was a [[Zhent]] of [[Darkhold]] sent to Waterdeep. By 1372 DR, he rarely went back to his home, where the [[Church of Bane]] had become more and more dominant.
