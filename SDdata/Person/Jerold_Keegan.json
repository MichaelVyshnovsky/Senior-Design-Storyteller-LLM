        "mainbody": "Sir '''Jerold Keegan''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Selûne]], a dragon-slayer, and a knight of [[Cormyr]] in [[236 DR]].{{Cite dungeon/155/Keep on the Shadowfell: Forgotten Realms Conversion|12}}",
        "History": "Sir Keegan was a renowned dragonslayer. He was knighted by King [[Tharyann Obarskyr]] himself, who gave him the [[Magic weapon|magic sword]] ''[[Aecris]]''.\n\nWhen the [[shadow dragon]] [[Shadraxil]] began to attack Cormyrian frontier outposts, it was Sir Keegan's duty to stop the dragon. He led a small force of armed men and [[War Wizard]]s and created a magical trap within one of the keeps in order to ensnare Shadraxil and bind him in the [[Plane of Shadow]].{{Cite dungeon/155/Keep on the Shadowfell: Forgotten Realms Conversion|5}}\n\nAfterwards, Sir Keegan became the lord of that outpost, charged to keep Shadraxil sealed in the [[Shadow Rift]]. The keep was consecrated to the goddess Selûne and renamed [[Shadowfell Keep|Keegan's Keep]]. The town of [[Winterhaven]] was founded nearby, likely for the keep's protection.\n\nIt was said that some time after Shadraxil's banishment, Keegan became a crazed madman and slew all of his family and friends, cursing the keep forever. All of this was in fact due to Shadraxil, still locked away in the Plane of Shadow but nonetheless able to exert his dark power over Keegan's mind. It was believed Sir Keegan was driven into the passages beneath the keep and killed by a group of his own men. However, in truth, Sir Keegan was too skilled for any one soldier to defeat. Gravely wounded, he fled into the deep passages beneath the keep and hid. His senses returned while he rested and tended to his wounds. Crushed with remorse, he drank a vial of poison and killed himself.\n\nHis spirit was bound to the ruined keep, waiting for a champion to redeem his memory and complete his mission—to keep the seal in place and protected so that this passage into the Shadowfell and Shadraxil's prison remained closed forever."
