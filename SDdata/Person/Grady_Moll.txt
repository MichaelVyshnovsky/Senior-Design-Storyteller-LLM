Grady Moll was an officer of the Soldiery of Mulmaster.
In 1491 DR, Grady was investigating the lumber merchant Fatell, who was suspected to be part of the Cult of the Eternal Flame, when a fire destroyed Fatells shop. Grady possibly managed to capture Fatell with the help of some adventurers—members of Lords Alliance—hired by Cora Peytir.
Around 1492 DR, he was promoted to captain.
Grady was secretly a member of the Lords Alliance.
