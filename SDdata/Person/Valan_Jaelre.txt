'''Valan Jaelre''' was a wizard leader of [[House Jaelre]] and the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]].
 
==Physical Description==
Valan wore fine robes and a house insignia of a sunburst with two [[dagger]]s pointing downward from it. He wielded a twisted [[staff]] that looked like it was made of filaments of shadow.

==Personality==
He was overconfident and would rant about how he would defeat his opponents and bring down [[Menzoberranzan]] even when fighting a losing battle.

==History==
In the late 15th century [[DR]], Valan put a [[simulacrum]] of himself in charge of a House Jaelre attack on [[Shadowdale]] to steal the ''[[Pendant of Ashaba]]''. The real Valan infiltrated the [[Braeryn]] in his ancestors' home of Menzoberranzan, hoping to cause civil war. The assassins' involvement was discovered, and the adventurers were dispatched to Stenchstreets to eliminate Valan.

==Relationship==
Valan was taking orders from someone inside [[House Nuryndin]].
