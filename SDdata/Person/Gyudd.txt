'''Gyudd''' was a master brewer in [[Skullport]].

==Personality==
Gyudd had been haunted by the [[Melairkyn]] ghosts in his dreams for most of his life. Shaken and overwhelmed by the responsibility, he started to drink heavily, and this quieted the ghosts.

==Possessions==
Gyudd typically wore a [[leather]] [[apron]] over a short-sleeved [[tunic]] and rough [[breeches]]. He also owned a pair of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[hobnail boot|hob-nailed boots]], passed down to him by his great-grandfather on the man's deathbed, that functioned similarly to a pair of ''[[boots of the north]]''. He rarely walked around heavily armed, instead preferring to have a [[dagger]] or [[knife]] tucked away in his belt for emergencies.

==Activities==
Gyudd ran [[Gyudd's Distillery]]. In his free time, he was always in a bar drinking.

==Relationship==
Guydd was the last member of the Melairkyn dwarves and a direct descendant of King [[Melair IV]].

==History==
Gyudd arrived in Skullport ''circa'' [[1310 DR]] and soon started his brewery and distillery. However, some time after the Melairkyn [[ghost]]s started to appear, Gyudd tried to silence them by becoming more and more drunk.

In [[1375 DR]] Gyudd's dreams became too strong after the earthquake following the [[Halaster]]'s death. He sold his business and hired an adventuring party to accompany him to the [[Belkram's Fall]] citadel inside [[Undermountain]].

He was still in operation as successful brewer during the early 1490s [[DR]].
