'''Mausa''' was a woman living in [[Fullpoint]]. The farmer [[Hemish]] had sought her advice on taking care of the infant [[Ash|Araluen]], only to find her to be superstitious and hateful. When by chance, the baby touched her horse, a broken-down nag, it was restored to health; she became fearful of the girl afterwards.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|6-7|1}}
