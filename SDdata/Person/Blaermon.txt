'''Blaermon the Blessed''' was a knight of [[Ilmater]] and a member of the [[Holy Warriors of Suffering]] in the mid–13th century [[DR]].

==History==
Blaermon the Blessed was known for surviving a string of hopeless battles, for which he earned his name.

''Circa'' [[1267 DR]], [[Althea|Althea the Abased]]—the leader of the [[House of the Broken God]] temple in [[Keltar]] and journeying up and down the [[Sword Coast]]—selected Blaermon for a holy task. She bade him to take away the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', the holiest book of the faith, to the "wild places" of the Realms and bestow it upon the first "needy and worthy" Ilmatari he met, someone who worked or fought for the benefit of the common people and their faith, not merely for wealth and adventure.

Blaermon obeyed and, in the [[1268 DR|Year of the Daystars, 1268 DR]], he gave the ''Tome'' to [[Flaergon]] of [[Glister]], who devoted his efforts to assisting miners and caravan-workers in the frozen north of the [[Moonsea]].
