        "mainbody": "Sharth was a High One of the illithids and one of three persons responsible for creating the World Serpent Inn, according to the wizard Elminster.\nVery little is known about Sharth except that he is said to have joined the friends Alaurum and Ilyndele&mdasha Torilian archmage and a member of the Arcane, respectively&mdashin \"crafting\" the inter-planar inn.\nHundreds of years before the late 14 century DR, Alaurum, Ilyndele, and Sharth built the inn itself. The demiplane within which the inn resided&mdashand the planes many portals&mdashhad already existed, supposed by some cosmologists to be a dreamscape resulting from a sleeping fragment of the World Serpent."
