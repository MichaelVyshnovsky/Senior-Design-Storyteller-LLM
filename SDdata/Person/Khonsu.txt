'''Khonsu''' was a senator of [[Innarlith]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was assassinated by [[Willem Korvan]] when Korvan attempted to advance to his own senate seat.

==Description==
He typically dressed in a conservative fashion.

==Relationships==
He was a great patron of the temple of [[Waukeen]], to which he had donated a great deal of money over the years. When Korvan made his first attempt to assassinate him by poison, a team of clerics from the temple came to rescue him and were able to keep him alive for months.  <ref>

==History==
Khonsu was a long-serving member of the senate of Innarlith and a wealthy aristocrat. By the time of his assassination he was the oldest senator in Innarlith.<ref> 

He ran committees on the senate and had important allies in the body. He formerly had been the senator in charge of selecting new senators.

Willem Korvan, the deputy of master-builder Senator [[Inthelph]], attempted to assassinate him by poison in the year [[1363 DR]]. However, Khonsu survived the attempt with help from priests of Waukeen. Khonsu didn't reveal Korvan's assassination attempt, however, and in the following year, Korvan made a second attempt in which he disemboweled Khonsu with a knife inside of his home. Korvan's reason for killing Khonsu was to protect Inthelph's position, since he feared that Khonsu was about to turn on Inthelph, owing to Inthelph's incompetence with the building projects he had been entrusted with. Inthelph was Korvan's principal patron and gateway to advancing to the senate.

A lavish funeral was paid for by Khonsu's estate. It included a procession down the streets through Ransar's ride in the second quarter of Innarlith.<ref>
