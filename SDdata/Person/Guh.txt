Chief Guh was the ruler of the hill giants sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Guh was one of the giant lords at the time of the shattering of the ordning.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, after the disappearance of storm giant king Hekaton, all giant lords started their path to reshape the ordning. Guhs plan was to eat enough food to become the largest giant in the world, so that the giant pantheon would notice and elevate her to the top.
To make her plan work, Guh relocated to Grudd Haug, took all male hill giants as her husbands, and sent them in search of food for her.
Usually Guh ate all people that showed up in her den, unless they proved to be valuable allies.
Like her fellow hill giants, Guh was not very intelligent, and her plot was a questionable one. She believed that if she became the worlds biggest giant, none would question her. In addition, Guh was a glutton.
