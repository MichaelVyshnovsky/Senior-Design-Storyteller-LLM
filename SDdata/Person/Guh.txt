Chief '''Guh''' was the ruler of the [[hill giant]]s sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
Guh was one of the [[giant]] lords at the time of the shattering of the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]].

In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, after the disappearance of [[storm giant]] king [[Hekaton]], all giant lords started their path to reshape the ordning. Guh's plan was to eat enough food to become the largest giant in the world, so that the [[giant pantheon]] would notice and elevate her to the top.

To make her plan work, Guh relocated to [[Grudd Haug]], took all male [[hill giant]]s as her husbands, and sent them in search of food for her.

Usually Guh ate all people that showed up in her den, unless they proved to be valuable allies.

==Personality==
Like her fellow hill giants, Guh was not very intelligent, and her plot was a questionable one. She believed that if she became the world's biggest giant, none would question her. In addition, Guh was a glutton.
