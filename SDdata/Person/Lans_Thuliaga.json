        "History": "''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Lans, known as Friend of the Friendless, was sent to fight [[demon]]s inside the [[Labyrinth]]. At one point, he was battling a powerful [[balor]] when he met the [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] and [[Linu La'neral]] and asked their help. Together they went down into the [[Chasm]] to fight the demon. However, after the defeat of the balor, Lans suddenly felt something taking control of his mind and, proclaiming his loyalty to [[Baphomet]], he went into a ''[[portal]]''. Later, but previously in the Heroes' perception of time, Lans, known as Illithid Scourge, led the demon armies to take control of the [[Maze Engine]] for his [[demon lord]] but was defeated and retreated."
