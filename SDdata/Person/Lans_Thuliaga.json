At one point, he was battling a powerful balor when he met the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge and Linu Laneral and asked their help. Together they went down into the Chasm to fight the demon. However, after the defeat of the balor, Lans suddenly felt something taking control of his mind and, proclaiming his loyalty to Baphomet, he went into a portal. Later, but previously in the Heroes perception of time, Lans, known as Illithid Scourge, led the demon armies to take control of the Maze Engine for his demon lord but was defeated and retreated."
