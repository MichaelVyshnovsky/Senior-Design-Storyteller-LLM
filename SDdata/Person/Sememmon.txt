Sememmon ( His body is a clone (his 6th) that was created for him by Manshoon during his time with the Zhentarim.
Sememmon was over 6 ft (1.8 m) tallSource states he was a handspan taller than Khelben, who was 1.83m (6ft). and, as of 1374 DR, had a light beard.
Sememmon was mild mannered, observant, patient, and keenly intelligent. He was also cunning and calculating, but he controls himself.
Sememmon knew which way the winds were blowing so he and his consort went rogue from the Zhentarim. Sememmon knew that the enemies of his enemy, (Fzoul Chembryl), are his friends. He planned to make himself available to the forces of good. His goal was to make himself indispensable to the countries, nations, and people he once opposed.
Sememmon often disguised himself and asked groups of adventurers to perform tasks on his behalf, and he always kept his word in this regard, never abandoning those working for him.
Sememmon spoke Abyssal, Chondathan, Draconic and Elven in addition to Common.
Sememmon had three masterwork cold iron daggers and a whole host of magical items, including a dagger of venom, rings of protection and regeneration, bracers of armor, a hood of intellect, a periapt of proof against poison, a vest of resistance and a war wizard cloak.
After catching the young pickpocket Tiep attempting to steal from him in Scornubel, Sememmon manipulated the boy into becoming a personal spy of sorts as well as an asset of the Zhentarim.
At some point before 1372 DR, Sememmon gained a servant in a foul-mouthed and abrasive raven named George. The talking bird was not a familiar and became bound in service to Sememmon under undisclosed circumstances. George was a useful tool who served his masters cause well.

Sememmon was born in Huddagh in the , as Malathar Wingstarl. His father sent him to study in Ordulin at a priesthood of Waukeen, and he developed keen business skills. He soon met the curios dealer Gelvar Thordrunn, who took Malathar on as an apprentice. Two years after the apprenticeship began, Gelvar disappeared, believed lost at sea.
In the , Harlshoon, the father of Manshoon, was poisoned in Zhentil Keep. Malathar had been asked to come back to Zhentil Keep to work for his family, doing business with the Toroth noble family. Manshoon had sought the help of the Toroth family in avenging his fathers death, and soon after, Malathar pulled Manshoon out of a destroyed Toroth villa, saving him.
To return the debt, Manshoon agreed to tutor Malathar in wizardry. Manshoon eventually rose to Lordship in Zhentil Keep, by which time he had developed many political rivals, and this caused Malathar to fake his death and change his name to distance himself from Manshoon. He chose "Sememmon" which had been the name of one of his grandfathers servants.
The Zhentarim was founded in the , and Sememmon began vying for the role of chief apprentice under Manshoon. He betrayed his fellow apprentice Alvagaerus Firtlthond in order to successfully acquire the role of chief apprentice in 1266 DR. He also began vying for power in the hierarchy of the Zhentarim, against Fzoul Chembryl.
After the conquest of Darkhold in 1312 DR, Sememmon was promoted to the Inner Circle of the Zhentarim and trusted with its command.

In the , a human wizard recruit by the name of Ashemmi caught Sememmons attention, and he deduced that it was actually a female elf disguised as a human. He was attracted to her, and did not give away that he knew about her disguise. In 1355 DR, Ashemmi revealed to him that she was in love with him, and that she was a Harper spy sent to infiltrate the Zhentarim. Sememmon realized that he was also in love with her and he did not want to betray her.
Sememmon covered Ashemmis tracks and set up safehouses across Northwest Faerûn under his original name. The Zhentarim discovered Ashemmis true identity in the , and, in a confrontation with Manshoon, Sememmon died while defending Ashemmi. Sememmon was brought back to life as a clone, and Manshoon magically locked away Ashemmis emotions. Whilst Sememmon told Manshoon that he was again loyal to the Zhentarim, in reality he wanted to escape from their grasp.
Despite his true allegiance, Sememmon fought alongside the Zhentilar forces during the Second battle of Shadowdale the following year during the Time of Troubles.
Sememmon worked for years to break down the magic restraining Ashemmis emotions, and in the , they made their escape, aided by Moonstars sent by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun. In return for this, both Sememmon and Ashemmi became loyal to Khelben, performing his missions when required of them. The same year, Sememmon became aware of his nemesis plot to install a puppet leader in the city of Daggerford. Under the guise of a Harper named Teygan, Sememmon built a temporary base in a cave in the wilderness outside Daggerford. He was accompanied by loyal raven George and two "Harpers" – Beowen and Miyandra. When a group of adventurers emerged acting against the Zhent plot, Sememmon seized the opportunity and approached the future Hero of Daggerford. The "Harper" invited the adventurers to his hideout and fed the Hero intel about the Zhentarim. Sememmon revealed that the omnipresent recent bandit attacks on Daggerfords trade were perpetrated by disguised Zhents, and the newly hired mercenary company that defended the city – the Griffons, were all loyal Zhetish fighters. Sememmon pointed the Hero towards the most recent Zhen bandit camp in the Lonely Barrens region. Subsequently, this intel led to the failure of Fzoul Chembryls plot.
On Uktar 28 1374 DR, Sememmon and Ashemmi assisted Khelben to defeat a sharn at the Sleeping Dragon inn, using a strategy known as Petryllocs Gambit.
