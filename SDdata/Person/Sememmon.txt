'''Sememmon''' ({{Pronounce|SEH|mem|on|refs= but went on the run with his consort [[Ashemmi]].{{fact}} His body is a [[clone]] (his 6th) that was created for him by Manshoon during his time with the [[Zhentarim]].{{fact}}

==Description==
Sememmon was over 6 ft (1.8 m) tall<ref group="note">Source states he was a handspan taller than [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun|Khelben]], who was 1.83m (6ft). and, as of [[1374 DR]], had a light beard.

==Personality==
Sememmon was mild mannered, observant, patient, and keenly intelligent. He was also cunning and calculating, but he controls himself.{{Cite dragon/357/Volo's Guide: Renegades of Darkhold|73}}

Sememmon knew which way the winds were blowing so he and his consort went rogue from the Zhentarim. Sememmon knew that the enemies of his enemy, ([[Fzoul Chembryl]]), are his friends. He planned to make himself available to the forces of good. His goal was to make himself indispensable to the countries, nations, and people he once opposed.{{fact}}

Sememmon often disguised himself and asked groups of adventurers to perform tasks on his behalf, and he always kept his word in this regard, never abandoning those working for him.

Sememmon spoke [[Abyssal language|Abyssal]], [[Chondathan language|Chondathan]], [[Draconic language|Draconic]] and [[Elven language|Elven]] in addition to [[Common]].

==Possessions==
Sememmon had three masterwork [[cold iron]] daggers and a whole host of magical items, including a ''[[dagger of venom]]'', rings of ''[[ring of protection|protection]]'' and ''[[ring of regeneration|regeneration]]'', ''[[bracers of armor]]'', a ''[[hood of intellect]]'', a ''[[periapt of proof against poison]]'', a ''[[vest of resistance]]'' and a ''[[war wizard cloak]]''.

==Relationships==
After catching the young pickpocket [[Tiep]] attempting to steal from him in [[Scornubel]], Sememmon manipulated the boy into becoming a personal spy of sorts as well as an asset of the Zhentarim.

At some point before [[1372 DR]], Sememmon gained a servant in a foul-mouthed and abrasive [[raven]] named [[George]]. The talking bird was not a familiar and became bound in service to Sememmon under undisclosed circumstances. George was a useful tool who served his master's cause well.

==History==
[[File:Sememmon DoD.png|thumb|Sememmon looking his usual wholesome self.]]
Sememmon was born in [[Huddagh]] in the {{YearlinkName|1234}}, as Malathar Wingstarl. His father sent him to study in [[Ordulin]] at a priesthood of [[Waukeen]], and he developed keen business skills. He soon met the curios dealer [[Gelvar Thordrunn]], who took Malathar on as an apprentice. Two years after the apprenticeship began, Gelvar disappeared, believed lost at sea.

===Meeting Manshoon===
In the {{YearlinkName|1258}}, [[Harlshoon]], the father of [[Manshoon]], was poisoned in [[Zhentil Keep]]. Malathar had been asked to come back to Zhentil Keep to work for his family, doing business with the [[Toroth]] noble family. Manshoon had sought the help of the Toroth family in avenging his father's death, and soon after, Malathar pulled Manshoon out of a destroyed Toroth villa, saving him.

To return the debt, Manshoon agreed to tutor Malathar in wizardry. Manshoon eventually rose to Lordship in Zhentil Keep, by which time he had developed many political rivals, and this caused Malathar to fake his death and change his name to distance himself from Manshoon. He chose "Sememmon" which had been the name of one of his grandfather's servants.

===Rise of the Zhentarim===
The [[Zhentarim]] was founded in the {{YearlinkName|1261}}, and Sememmon began vying for the role of chief apprentice under Manshoon. He betrayed his fellow apprentice [[Alvagaerus Firtlthond]] in order to successfully acquire the role of chief apprentice in [[1266 DR]]. He also began vying for power in the hierarchy of the Zhentarim, against [[Fzoul Chembryl]].

After the conquest of [[Darkhold]] in [[1312 DR]], Sememmon was promoted to the Inner Circle of the Zhentarim and trusted with its command.{{Cite dragon/357/Volo's Guide: Renegades of Darkhold|72-73}}

[[Image:SememmonStudy.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''Sememmon deep in study in his private library in Darkhold.'']]
===Time With Ashemmi===
In the {{YearlinkName|1346}}, a human wizard recruit by the name of [[Ashemmi]] caught Sememmon's attention, and he deduced that it was actually a female elf disguised as a human. He was attracted to her, and did not give away that he knew about her disguise. In [[1355 DR]], Ashemmi revealed to him that she was in love with him, and that she was a [[Harper]] spy sent to infiltrate the Zhentarim. Sememmon realized that he was also in love with her and he did not want to betray her.

Sememmon covered Ashemmi's tracks and set up safehouses across [[Northwest Faerûn]] under his original name. The Zhentarim discovered Ashemmi's true identity in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, and, in a confrontation with Manshoon, Sememmon died while defending Ashemmi. Sememmon was brought back to life as a clone, and Manshoon magically locked away Ashemmi's emotions. Whilst Sememmon told Manshoon that he was again loyal to the Zhentarim, in reality he wanted to escape from their grasp.

Despite his true allegiance, Sememmon fought alongside the [[Zhentilar]] forces during the [[Second battle of Shadowdale]] the [[1358 DR|following year]] during the [[Time of Troubles]].

Sememmon worked for years to break down the magic restraining Ashemmi's emotions, and in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, they made their escape, aided by [[Moonstars]] sent by [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]]. In return for this, both Sememmon and Ashemmi became loyal to Khelben, performing his missions when required of them. The same year, Sememmon became aware of his nemesis' plot to install a puppet leader in the city of [[Daggerford]]. Under the guise of a Harper named Teygan, Sememmon built a temporary base in a cave in the wilderness outside Daggerford. He was accompanied by loyal raven George and two "Harpers" – [[Beowen]] and [[Miyandra]]. When a group of adventurers emerged acting against the Zhent plot, Sememmon seized the opportunity and approached the future [[Hero of Daggerford]]. The "Harper" invited the adventurers to his hideout and fed the Hero intel about the Zhentarim. Sememmon revealed that the omnipresent recent bandit attacks on Daggerford's trade were perpetrated by disguised Zhents, and the newly hired mercenary company that defended the city – the [[Griffons]], were all loyal Zhetish fighters. Sememmon pointed the Hero towards the most recent Zhen bandit camp in the [[Lonely Barrens]] region. Subsequently, this intel led to the failure of Fzoul Chembryl's plot.


On [[Uktar 28]] [[1374 DR]], Sememmon and Ashemmi assisted Khelben to defeat a [[sharn]] at the [[Sleeping Dragon]] inn, using a strategy known as ''[[Petrylloc's Gambit]]''.
