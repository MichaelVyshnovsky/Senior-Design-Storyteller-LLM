        "mainbody": "Winking Murene was a landlady and tavern owner from Lyrabar. She rented an apartment to Gorstag Helder in .\nThe woman was obese, with red, scrofulous patches on her pasty skin. She had a sour body odor. Her namesake was a drooping eyelid, which sagged so low that it appeared to be closed.\nMurene lived in a tavern, the upper floor of which was rented out as rooms. The lower floor was open to the street, with two kegs and a door used as a makeshift bar. The establishment looked rather squalid.\nMurene was interrogated by Will Turnstone and Pavel Shemov on Ches 12 of 1373 DR, regarding Gorstag Helder. Though threats and strong-arming were involved, she revealed, in order, that Gorstag Helder was behind on his rent, that he had died, that his room had been searched by three men, one of which was undead, and that she had sold his possessions to cover the rent. Amongst those possessions, there were fencing implements, which led Pavel and Will to figure out he had been learning swordplay."
