Askalath was a mage who once resided on the isle of Askalet in the Sea of Swords, many centuries before the 14 century DR.
By the late 14 century DR, little remained recorded of Askalaths history. Elminster Aumar, the Sage of Shadowdale, believed that the mages island, Askalet, got its name from a corruption of "Askalath." The mage resided in his tower, long a ruin in the 14 century DR. By that time, his home was looted of most of the treasures. However, in the towers basement, one could find a long, seeming infinite well, a shaft that plummeted deep into the bowels of the Undermountain. Cellar complexes were hidden closer to the shafts end, with entrances accessible from the bottom of the well.
