        "mainbody": "rik was a thug and robber who operated near Yhaunn in Sembia in 1373 DR.\nHe was an unpleasant and predatory man, and wielded a club in combat. He was quiet and untalkative compared to his companion.\nDrik was a close associate of Stag, and was also friends with the patrons of Cutters Dip, such as Noyle, Kor, and Lahumbra Sashtyn.\nIn Eleasis of the , he and Stag attempted to rob Feena Archwood outside of Yhaunn, not knowing she was a werewolf and a priestess of Sel√ªne. She defeated the two of them handily with her unarmed skills and divine magic, and left them unconscious outside the city.\nA tenday later, Drik and Stag came across Feena again by chance at the Cutters Dip tavern. This time, they turned the bar patrons against her by claiming she was a robber and a wild mage, and easily had her at their mercy as they tormented her with Dips Stagger. They were interrupted by Keph Thingoleir, who rescued Feena purely out of personal disdain for Stag. After a brief unarmed brawl, Drik drew a throwing knife, but Keph shattered his knee with a well-placed kick, leaving him on the floor of the tavern."
