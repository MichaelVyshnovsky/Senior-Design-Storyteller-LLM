        "mainbody": "'''Drik''' was a thug and robber who operated near [[Yhaunn]] in [[Sembia]] in [[1373 DR]].",
        "Description": "He was an unpleasant and predatory man, and wielded a club in combat. He was quiet and untalkative compared to his companion.",
        "Relationships": "Drik was a close associate of [[Stag (bandit)|Stag]], and was also friends with the patrons of [[Cutter's Dip]], such as [[Noyle]], [[Kor (Yhaunn)|Kor]], and [[Lahumbra Sashtyn]].",
        "History": "In [[Eleasis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, he and Stag attempted to rob [[Feena Archwood]] outside of Yhaunn, not knowing she was a [[werewolf]] and a [[priestess]] of [[Sel√ªne]]. She defeated the two of them handily with her unarmed skills and [[divine magic]], and left them unconscious outside the city.\n\nA [[tenday]] later, Drik and Stag came across Feena again by chance at the Cutter's Dip tavern. This time, they turned the bar patrons against her by claiming she was a robber and a [[wild mage]], and easily had her at their mercy as they tormented her with [[Dip's Stagger]]. They were interrupted by [[Keph Thingoleir]], who rescued Feena purely out of personal disdain for Stag. After a brief unarmed brawl, Drik drew a [[throwing knife]], but Keph shattered his knee with a well-placed kick, leaving him on the floor of the tavern."
