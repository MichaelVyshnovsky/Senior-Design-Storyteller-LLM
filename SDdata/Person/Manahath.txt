'''Manahath''' was a caravan guard from the [[Moonshae Isles]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He sold [[spices]] to the [[drow]] of [[Menzoberranzan]].

==History==
He could be encountered by adventurers in the underground tunnels of the plains of [[Icewind Dale]], which lead to the [[Underdark]]. Manahath and his [[barbarian]] fellows were cheated by [[House Do'Urden]] via [[illusion]] [[magic]].
