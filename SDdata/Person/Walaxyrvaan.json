        "mainbody": "'''Walaxyrvaan''', (who preferred to be called by her nickname '''Lynx''',) was a [[copper elf]] from the [[Elmanesse]] tribe in the [[Wealdath]] who had earned an apprenticeship at [[Blackstaff Tower]]. Her name translates as \"Lynx of the Approaching Dusk\" in [[Elven language|Elven]].",
        "Description": "Walaxyrvaan had copper-colored skin. She had a deep, calming voice. She was quite agile and could easily balance on tree limbs and even perform handstands. She was already skilled at hunting before coming to the Tower for training in magic.",
        "History": "Walaxyrvaan was recommended by [[Arilyn Moonblade]] and [[Danilo Thann]] for apprenticeship at Blackstaff Tower, where she was under the tutelage of [[Tsarra Chaadren]]. She was the newest apprentice there in [[1374 DR]], when she was not quite an adolescent by elven standards. She was older in years, however, than the combined age of all of Tsarra's other students at that time. On the journey to [[Waterdeep]] from [[Tethyr]], she helped guard the caravan.\n\nOn [[Uktar 28]] of that year, she was a member of a group of eight apprentices, including her teacher, who spent an overnight hunting trip in the [[Pellamcopse Woods]]. She snared or shot a brace of [[tarrant]]s and helped some of the other students dress a [[deer]] that Tsarra had shot.\n\nWhen they arrived back at the tower, she was one of four tasked with butchering the game that they had taken and was in the kitchens when an explosion destroyed one of the walls of the tower."
