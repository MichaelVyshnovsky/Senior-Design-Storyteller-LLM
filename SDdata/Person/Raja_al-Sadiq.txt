'''Raja al-Sadiq''' was a ruthless [[sha'ir]] inhabiting [[Rog'osto]] in [[east Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Adventure Book|5}}

==Personality==
She was ambitious and greedy.

==Activities==
Raja was part of a group of bounty hunters who accidentally stumbled across the ruins of [[Tadabbur]] in the jungle while searching for lost treasures. Her group removed a unique talisman they discovered from the ruins, unknowingly breaking the seal that had kept [[Tisan Balshareska]], the Arch [[Geomancer]], imprisoned for ages.

Tisan struck a deal with Raja, tasking her to retrieve the [[Seal of Suhail min Zann]] in exchange for rulership and power. Raja used [[Tabati]], an [[invisible stalker]] and her servant, to track down the seal. Both Tisan and Raja were bound by a ''[[geas]]'' so they could not betray each other, but unbeknownst to Raja, Tisan planned to use a ''[[wish]]'' to safely break the ''geas'' when the seal was retrieved.
