        "mainbody": "rudence Tarkwold was a Zhentarim agent who lived in the village of Easthaven during the late 15 century DR.\nWhile Prudence posed as a simple clerk in Easthavens town hall, she lived a double life as a spy and informant for the Black Network.\nPrudence had no true loyalty to Easthavens Speaker Danneth Waylen, and would readily betray him if the right opportunity presented itself. Her loyalty lay solely with the Zhentarim, who she considered her one and true family.\nShe kept a pet flying snake that served as her own personal messenger."
