Zor '''Faltyn Gos''' ({{Pronounce|ZOR|_|fawll|TEEN|_|GAHSS|refs={{Cite adventurers league/Flames of Kythorn|29}}}}) was a noble in [[Mulmaster]].

==Personality==
Faltyn indulged in self-appreciation, always reminding everyone of his contributions to the city. He became very upset if not called by his correct title of "Zor Gos".

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Gos competed with other Mulmaster nobles over arts. Thus, for the birthday of his wife [[Tiega Gos]], Faltyn commissioned his nephew [[Andrik Gos]] to make a painting of her and hired [[Marim Tem]] as a musician.{{Cite adventurers league/Flames of Kythorn|12}}
