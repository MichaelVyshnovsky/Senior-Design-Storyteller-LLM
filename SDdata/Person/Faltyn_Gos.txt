Zor Faltyn Gos () was a noble in Mulmaster.
Faltyn indulged in self-appreciation, always reminding everyone of his contributions to the city. He became very upset if not called by his correct title of "Zor Gos".
In 1491 DR, Gos competed with other Mulmaster nobles over arts. Thus, for the birthday of his wife Tiega Gos, Faltyn commissioned his nephew Andrik Gos to make a painting of her and hired Marim Tem as a musician.
