century wizard|other people with the same name|Rivalen
Rivalen Blackhand was a wizard and the proprietor of Sorcerous Sundries during the late 15 century DR. From within the store, he imported and sold arcane components, offered fortune-telling of an unreliable nature, as well as spellcasting services, particularly those related to the betterment of luck.
Rivalen was a fairly successful businessman, earning a significant and reliable income from the shop. He was aided by his apprentice, a gnome named Gilligunn.
Claiming to have come from the far-off land of Halruaa, Rivalen boasted that he held great arcane power during his adventuring days. According to his tales however, a great battle with a demon left him with a shriveled, blackened handâ€”which in turn ended his career as an adventurer.
