==History==
In the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Dragonsoul Arden let the cult's efforts to uncover the resting place of [[Cruven Gantara]], in order to locate a ''[[portal]]'' to the isle of [[Tuern]]. He and his fellow cultists used [[barrel]]s of [[dragon fire tar]] to excavate tombs within [[Ebon Downs]].

Unfortunately for Arden and the Cult of the Dragon, their mission in Ebon Downs was thwarted by Preceptor [[Theraclast]] of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] and the adventurer known as the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]].
