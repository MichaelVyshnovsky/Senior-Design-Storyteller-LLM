'''Skriss''' was a [[troglodyte]] member of the [[Society of Brilliance]] during the late 1480s or early 1490s DR..

==History==
Details of Skriss' early life are unknown, though she eventually founded and joined the Society of Brilliance; having done so alongside [[Omeluum]], [[Grazilaxx]], [[Blurg]], [[Y]], and [[Sloopidoop]].<ref name="BGIII" >

Skriss and all the other members of the society went on a pilgrimage to [[Gravenhollow]] some years before the [[demon]]ic crisis that struck the Underdark in the late 1480s [[DR]].
