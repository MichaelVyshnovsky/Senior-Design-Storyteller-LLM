FhetAhla was an amnizu businessman in the Wandering Emporium, which traveled across the plains of Avernus in the Nine Hells.
Once FhetAhla failed a critical mission for Asmodeus, so the Lord of Hell exiled him to the Emporium for an indefinite period of time. He was also forbidden to usurp Mahadis authority.
FhetAhla operated an imp courier service. He also acted as a notary of infernal contracts and exchanged soul coins for other goods.
