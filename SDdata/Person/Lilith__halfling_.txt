'''Lilith''' was a member of the [[Zhentarim]] in [[1489 DR]].

==Personality==
Lilith was a quick-witted individual who used humor to disarm others' mistrust.

==History==
In 1489 DR, Lilith was the Zhentarim delegate sent to help a hired adventuring party to defeat the great dragon [[Claugiyliamatar]] of [[Kryptgarden Forest]]. The Zhentarim's main objectives were to investigate some [[Red Wizards of Thay]] inside the new faction of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], recover stolen cargo, and to stop a possible alliance of the [[fey]] lords of the forest with [[hobgoblin]]s. Lilith revealed that a recently joined cultist, [[Yalek Snurd]], was a [[Zhent]] spy.{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|9}}
