Lilith was a member of the Zhentarim in 1489 DR.
Lilith was a quick-witted individual who used humor to disarm others mistrust.
In 1489 DR, Lilith was the Zhentarim delegate sent to help a hired adventuring party to defeat the great dragon Claugiyliamatar of Kryptgarden Forest. The Zhentarims main objectives were to investigate some Red Wizards of Thay inside the new faction of the Cult of the Dragon, recover stolen cargo, and to stop a possible alliance of the fey lords of the forest with hobgoblins. Lilith revealed that a recently joined cultist, Yalek Snurd, was a Zhent spy.
