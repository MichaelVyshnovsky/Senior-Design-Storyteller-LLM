'''Phubbs''' was one of the employees of [[Lady Jannath's Estate]] in the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Chamberlain Mercer, the man in charge of Lady [[Firelia Jannath]]'s staff, dismissed all servants from the mansion on the mistress's orders. Mercer placed Phubbs, who was assigned to be a guest greeter, [[Furbleston]], [[Bailey]], [[Cyrilla]], [[Jooli]], and Chef [[Marjoram (chef)|Marjoram]] on temporary leave with the pay of half-wages and allowance to seek temporary employment somewhere else. The chamberlain issued a statement that this dismissal was done at no imputation of malfeasance and would be ended upon notice.
