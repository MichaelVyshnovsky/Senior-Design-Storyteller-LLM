'''Gwelt''' was a very ambitious [[arcanist]] of [[Thultanthar]].

==History==
In [[1487 DR]], [[Manarlume Tanthul]] and her sister [[Lelavdra Tanthul]] found that Gwelt was a highly dangerous individual who was plotting to kill all the [[Princes of Shade]].

Later, Gwelt was summoned by the High Prince [[Telamont Tanthul]], who wanted to know him. Happy with Gwelt's reactions, the Most High showed Gwelt that the Wards of [[Candlekeep]] were gone and ordered him to investigate. Later, Telamont announced to [[Aglarel Tanthul]] that Gwelt would become his herald.

Thereafter, Gwelt led all the [[shadovar]] arcanists in working great ''[[mythal]]''-draining magic. However, he abandoned the casting just before [[Larloch]] shattered the minds of all the collected arcanists. Gwelt went to Manarlume and Lelavdra to discuss how to survive the fighting.

Later, among the ruins of the collapsed [[Thultanthar]], the three laughed about the stupidity of the High Prince.

After the fall, the three relocated to a magically concealed fortress in the ruins of the [[Citadel of the Raven]], creating a society to rally survivors of [[Shade]]. Gwelt traveled often, doing most of the recruiting.<ref>[[Ed Greenwood]] (2014-09-17). After the Fall. [[Forging the Realms]]. [[Wizards of the Coast]]. Archived from the original on 2016-08-16. 

In [[1491 DR]] he was sighted in [[Waterdeep]], and may have had a relation to the murdered [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lord]] Ammasker Gwelt.<ref>[[Ed Greenwood]] (2016-06-07). ''[[Death Masks]]''. ([[Wizards of the Coast]]). ISBN [[Special:BookSources/0-7869-6593-2|0-7869-6593-2]].

==Relationships==
Gwelt was friends with fellow arcanist [[Relvrak]], who was also his tutor for a time.
