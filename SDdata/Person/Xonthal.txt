Xonthal was an adventurer mage from Faerûn that traveled the breadth of Toril, visiting the continents of Zakhara, Kara-Tur, and Maztica across the Trackless Sea, and eventually became a powerful and famous archmage.
The mage was a solitary person that greatly valued his privacy and solitude.
He was famous for being the first Faerûnian mage to become a plumaweaver, the practitioners of feather magic that was unique to the lands of Maztica. His arcane studies centered around the the school of conjuration as well as elemental evocation.
Xonthal also spent some amount of time looking into time-altering magic. Within his tower he kept two man-sized hourglasses that were built to potentially manipulate or alter the time stream.
Through his years of magical experimentation, Xonthal sought to incorporate the most desirable features of elementals from various planes and combine them within a single being.
Xonthal could often be found traveling alongside genies and other beings from the elemental planes.
The aspiring spellcaster began his illustrious career as a simple adventurer.
At some point, Xonthal decided to construct a black stone tower at the base of Mount Hlim in the Savage Frontier. His apprentices and servants had homes built around the tower, in effect founding a burgeoning village that would remain for at least a century later.
Around the , Xonthal underwent an extreme shift in personality. He expelled his students from the tower, set deadly enchantments upon the hedge maze surrounding its entrance, and disappeared from public life.
After his disappearance, some residents of Xonthals Tower village believed the elusive archmage had died, or even underwent the process of lichdom.
