Ovros Thilymm was a man of Mordulkin in Chessenta and Head Librarian of the Jedea Academy in the early 1370s DR.
In the winter of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Ovros led Ythnel Duumin, Kestus Aentius, Muctos Dapritus, and Kohtakah to a secret meeting with a contactâ€”in truth, King Hercubes Jedea.
He was an old man who wore a conical hat and a medallion bearing a cut sapphire. He used a magic glowing quill to write with at night.
