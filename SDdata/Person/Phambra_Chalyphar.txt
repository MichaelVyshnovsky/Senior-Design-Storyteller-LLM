'''Phambra Chalyphar''' was the [[Magister]] for six months in {{yearlink|345}}.

==Appearance==
Phambra had glossy black hair. She was quite beautiful.

==Personality==
She was governed by her ambition, with a malicious tongue and a hatred of all those who "knew too much about her".

==Activities==
Phambra was known to attend [[Magefair]]s after her death, where she frightened young mages that made moves on her; this gave her the nickname she was known by.

==History==
She was a local sorceress where one of [[Hortil Droone]]'s apprentices lived; she noticed him visiting her. After scrying on him, she took him to be a mage of much power and magical wealth, setting up an ambush to "slay and seize".

She remained the [[Magister]] only long enough to slay two wizards, leave the belongings of one of them to his apprentice so as to placate [[Mystra]], and then lose her next spell duel, which was against the significantly more expert [[Arghorst Talandor]].

After her death, she became a [[shadowstaff]], whose appearance was mostly the same as in life.
