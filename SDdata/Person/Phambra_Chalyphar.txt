Phambra Chalyphar was the Magister for six months in .
Phambra had glossy black hair. She was quite beautiful.
She was governed by her ambition, with a malicious tongue and a hatred of all those who "knew too much about her".
Phambra was known to attend Magefairs after her death, where she frightened young mages that made moves on her this gave her the nickname she was known by.
She was a local sorceress where one of Hortil Droones apprentices lived she noticed him visiting her. After scrying on him, she took him to be a mage of much power and magical wealth, setting up an ambush to "slay and seize".
She remained the Magister only long enough to slay two wizards, leave the belongings of one of them to his apprentice so as to placate Mystra, and then lose her next spell duel, which was against the significantly more expert Arghorst Talandor.
After her death, she became a shadowstaff, whose appearance was mostly the same as in life.
