'''Rhondethar Windrider''' was a mage who was held in the dungeons of [[Westgate]] on the [[Dragon Coast]] in the early 14th century [[DR]].

Rhondethar was forcibly extracted from the dungeon by the famed mercenary [[Brandon]] some time before [[1356 DR]], who cut through many city guards to get to him.
