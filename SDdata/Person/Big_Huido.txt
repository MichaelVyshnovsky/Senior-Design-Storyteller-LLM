{{Quote|''You'll be swimming with the critters unless you skedaddle. The Guild are due to pick up this shipment at any moment.''|Big Huido}}

==Description==
He was a [[hin]] with a close-cut blond hair and brown eyes. The halfling's face was streaked with numerous long scars. Huido armed himself with two simple [[dagger]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Big Huido worked with a gand of smugglers: [[Galem Meats]], [[Lo Blank]], and [[Jezzy Topps]], transporting [[weapon]]s, [[drug]]s, and [[firewine]] into Baldur's Gate. The shipments were well defended and all were released into the hands of the members of the Guild only. One such shipment during the [[Absolute crisis]] was a chest containing [[essence of ether]], [[dream mist]], [[silkroot]], and [[terazul]]â€”all illegal substances in the city.
