Housemaster Eiraklon Marimmatar was in charge of security at the famous Gentle Mermaid tavern and gambling hall in the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Eiraklon commanded several dozen bouncers and watch wizards to maintain security within the Gentle Mermaid. He was assisted by his second in command, Ulthlo Relajatyr. Eiraklon had suspicion that shady funds were funneling through the Gentle Mermaid, but did not dare bring his suspicions to the owner, Jhant Daxer. He had the freedom to hire whoever he wished and conduct operations how he saw fit.
