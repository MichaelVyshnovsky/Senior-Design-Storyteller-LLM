Housemaster '''Eiraklon Marimmatar''' was in charge of security at the famous [[Gentle Mermaid]] tavern and gambling hall in the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Eiraklon commanded several dozen bouncers and watch [[wizard]]s to maintain security within the Gentle Mermaid. He was assisted by his second in command, [[Ulthlo Relajatyr]]. Eiraklon had suspicion that shady funds were funneling through the Gentle Mermaid, but did not dare bring his suspicions to the owner, [[Jhant Daxer]]. He had the freedom to hire whoever he wished and conduct operations how he saw fit.
