        "mainbody": "'''Sharndrel''' was a male [[black dragon]] that lived in the [[High Moor]] throughout the 13{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1290}}, when Sharndrel was still young, he and two other [[dragon]]s were each individually summoned by [[Ithtaerus Casalia]] to [[Dragonspear Castle]]. The mage created a convoluted plan that involved them killing the defenseless [[copper dragon]] [[Halatathlaer]] so that he could claim its hoard.\n\nWhen the dragons arrived, they fought one another and only Sharndrel survived. When he reached Halatathlaer's hoard he saw that Ithtaerus had taken a great share of it and only a small collection of coins remained. Incensed he went to the top of Dragonspear Castle and in effect disintegrated Ithtaerus with his acidic breath.\n\nSharndrel was still alive as of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}."
