Harper Lymn was one of the agents who accompanied Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed lands surrounding the Moonrise Towersâ€”General Thorms seat of power.\nWhen a group of True Souls arrived at the Last Light Inn, which the Harpers had claimed as a temporary base, Lymn was among those present for the events that followed. It was unknown if Harper Lymn survived the war with the Absolute she mightve perished after the Last Light Inn was consumed by the darkness or else she survived with the rest, storming the Moonrise Towers to end General Thorms reign."
