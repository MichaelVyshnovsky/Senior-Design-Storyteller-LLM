        "mainbody": "'''Borlin, blood of Ghellin''', titled '''Axe of the Iron House''', was a [[dwarf]] of the [[Iron House]], the exiled royal court of the [[Mines of Tethyamar]]. He was a descendant of [[Ghellin]], King-in-Exile of the Iron House. He was also a leader of dwarven armies, such as the [[Mithril Legion]].{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|90}}",
        "History": "In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], Borlin led a force of dwarves against the [[green dragon]] [[Urnalithorgathla]], who laired in the [[Spiderhaunt Wood]] in the [[Dalelands]]. The victorious dwarves slew the wyrm and Borlin discovered in her hoard the sword ''[[Sarghathuld]]'', a legendary blade of the fallen dwarven realm of [[Roldilar]]. He claimed the weapon to wield in battle.\n\nBorlin later inspired a large number of dwarven warriors to form the [[Mithril Legion]] and embark on a quest to reclaim the lost Mines of Tethyamar, near the [[Dalelands]]. They marched out of [[Tilverton]] in the [[1364 DR|Year of the Wave, 1364 DR]], heading north-west, but then vanished, their fate unknown.\n\nSome claimed that Borlin and the Mithril Legion had successfully retaken part of the Mines, and sent a report of such to King Ghellin via [[magic]], but this was only speculation.\n\nIn fact, Borlin and the Legion made a successful assault against one of gates into Tethyamar, but ran into an [[orc]]-fashioned ''portal''. This transported them deep into the mines, far from the entrance. Steadily, they fought their way through the orcs and back to the surface, but fell one by one. Borlin was the last, dying in sight of Tethyamar's doors.",
        "Possessions": "Borlin wielded the sword ''[[Sarghathuld]]'', an [[orcslayer]] blade of great power."
