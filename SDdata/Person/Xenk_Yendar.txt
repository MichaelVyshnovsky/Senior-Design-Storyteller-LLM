'''Xenk Yendar''' {{pronounce|ZENK|_|YEN|dar|refs={{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Thieves' Gallery}} but was renowned as a holy warrior, healer, and hero in his own right.
{{quote|In those instances when faith wanes and doubt waxes, I recall the tenets of the ancients, which teach us that—|Xenk}}

==Description==
A handsome and muscular man, he had an altogether striking appearance.With a similar design to Dralas's seen at his hairline, Xenk most likely has more tattoos on his scalp that are covered by his hair, which he may have grown to conceal them.

He wore ornate half-plate armor trimmed and emblazoned with gold designs, over blue-green attire and under a fine [[cloak]].

==Personality==
[[File:Xenk.png|thumb|left|250px|''The rod up his backside is his spine.'']]
The very image of the knight in shining armor, of the resolute paladin, Xenk embodied what it meant to be a heroic divine warrior against all the odds. He had sworn an [[Oath of Devotion]] to help the innocent and uphold justice and he had a reputation for kindliness, honor, and integrity. His longevity gave him a farther perspective and more experience than most, yet it could also be a burden upon him. Xenk regretted that as a boy he had taken fright and ran and not been able to save his parents from becoming [[zombie]]s in service to Szass Tam.

He endeavored to inspire goodness in his companions. He was always ready to share his knowledge and wisdom with others, but all too often, those others were not willing or patient enough to listen.It's unknown which [[deity]] Xenk follows as a paladin; [[Ilmater]], god of martyrdom and suffering, or [[Torm]], god of duty and loyalty, seem the best matches. Leaks from earlier versions of the ''Honor Among Thieves'' script mention the [[Triadic knight|Triadic Knights]] (followers of [[the Triad]] of Ilmater, Torm, and [[Tyr]], god of justice), suggesting this aspect was lost in rewrites.

Xenk dealt with every issue with complete dedication and conviction, which made him seem too serious to others.

==Abilities==
[[File:Xenk sword.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Well, it's no ''[[holy avenger]]'', but it's close.'']]
Xenk had an aura about him that helped protect those near him from harm. With his cleansing touch, he could not only heal a fellow creature's wounds but also cure what ailed them as with ''[[lesser restoration]]''. He was capable of other divine magic and had great prowess as a warrior, and could cause his blades to strike with a [[radiant energy]]. He could [[detect evil|sense the presence of evil]] by smelling it.

Despite his holiness, Xenk's close brush with undeath left him aging slower than a human otherwise should. This gave him great longevity—he grew to be more than a century old. He also possessed [[darkvision]].

==Possessions==
[[File:Dralas and Xenk.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''At least this way throwing his sword doesn't leave him unarmed.'']]
He wielded a unique ''[[daggersword]]'', a [[longsword]] that could come apart into both a [[dagger]] and a [[shortsword]], making him a very versatile warrior. With this, he could fight with the longsword&mdash;which he would imbue with radiant power&mdash;or he could dual-wield both shortsword and dagger to pick apart his opponent's defenses. Furthermore, he could launch its blade like a spear at an opponent with enough force to skewer a target and knock them down, and still leave him with armed with the dagger. Shortly after, the blades would magically reattach. On its blade was inscribed, in the [[Celestial language]], the legend "Neither Virtue Nor Blade Shall Break," ironically enough.

He wore [[half plate]] [[armor]].

==Activities==
{{quote|''Cothin al napeai!''|Xenk's battle cry when charging into the fray}}
Xenk spent his days traveling the realms of [[Faerûn]] in search of villainy to oppose, innocents to protect, and good deeds to do.

He was athletic and insightful, and was learned in history and skilled in survival, and also had keen hearing.

==Relationships==
He was an old enemy of the undead Thayan assassin [[Dralas]].Notably, Xenk and Dralas display the same Thayan tattoo at their hairline, hinting at a stronger connection, but this is not explored.

==History==
===Early Life===

Xenk grew up in the land of [[Thay]],''Honor Among Thieves'' only says "the capital" of Thay, which at the time should be [[Eltabbar]]. However, it is presumed Xenk lived in Thaymount, owing to him bearing Tam's tattoo and the apparent depiction of the Citadel. Moreover, Xenk may be referring to it as the present capital. Therefore, the Citadel is presumed instead. His parents were downtrodden subjects of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]]. 

As Xenk would recall, when he was a boy in the mid-1370s DR, Szass Tam called all the other zulkirs and all the people of Thaymount, Xenk and his parents among them, to a grand celebration atop the [[Citadel]] on [[Kythorn 19|the eve]] of the [[summer solstice]]. A few of the common people carried sun symbols.<ref group="note">''Honor Among Thieves'' mentions only the eve of the solstice; due to the presence of sun-like symbols in the crowd, this is presumed to be the summer solstice. The newly revived sun god [[Amaunator]] has a similar holy symbol and treats the summer solstice as a holy day, suggesting a link to the celebration. But it was all a lie—instead, Szass demanded all Thayans abandon their mortality and serve him in undeath. Then Szass used the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'' to invoke a terrible red smoke that consumed their souls, thereby creating an army of [[undead]] under his control for his coup and conquest of Thay. All who tried to flee were slain or trapped within by the Red Wizards.It is difficult to reconcile Xenk's account and the scenes in ''Honor Among Thieves'' with the established history of Szass Tam, the zulkirs, and Thay, as Tam's betrayal here contradicts his betrayals elsewhere. It appears to conflate the zulkirs gathering at the Citadel in ''The Crimson Gold'' in 1373 DR; the meeting of the [[Council of Zulkirs]] in Eltabbar, the start of the War of the Zulkirs, and Tam's takeover of Thay in ''Unclean'' in 1375 DR; and a later new event of Tam creating his undead armies from his subjects. Since this is presented as a story from a book a century later and from Xenk's childhood memories, it's presumed to be a case of unreliable narration or movie dramatization.

Escaping the [[lich]]-ruled nation of Thay, Xenk was forced to live in exile as a wanderer of the Realms for the next century. In his time, he performed many great and heroic deeds.

===The Quest of the Helm===
[[File:Xenk helmet of disjunction.png|thumb|right|350px|''Xenk being entrusted with the ''helmet of disjunction'' by the dying Ven Salafin.'']]
''Circa'' [[1400 DR]],<ref group="note">The battle is undated but is "a century ago" from the date of ''Honor Among Thieves'', which is itself undated but assumed to be the late 1490s DR. The {{yearlinkName|1402}}, is a likely candidate. Xenk arrived amidst the [[Battle of the Evermoors]] as it raged between the [[Uthgardt]] [[Elk tribe]] and the [[Cult of the Dragon]], together with their [[black dragon]] master, [[Rakor]]. Hoping to save lives, Xenk ran into the fray and found a dying warrior with a vital mission—[[Ven Salafin]], who was struggling to get the ''[[helmet of disjunction]]'' away from the cultists. Xenk inspected his wounds and found he could not help him, but promised to keep the ''helmet of disjunction'' safe. Believing him, Ven gave up the helm and expired. In the end, all he could save was the helmet.

Having inherited this quest, Xenk hastened to [[Waterdeep]], where he found the mage [[Mordenkainen]] from the world of [[Oerth]]. Though he had first crafted the ''helmet of disjunction'',{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Legendary Magic Items}} he wanted nothing to do with "the accursed thing" and sent Xenk away. Xenk later clashed with the Cult of the Dragon and a [[dracolich]] who sought again to claim the helm from him.

Looking for some deep dark place to hide the ''helmet of disjunction'', Xenk ventured underground, into the [[Underdark]] itself. There, he was soon assaulted by a [[mind flayer]], which wished to give the helm to his master, the [[elder brain]] [[Zuphelithid]]. Though it tried to eat his brain, and got as close as sucking on his head, in order to liberate their people from the mind flayers' thralldom. Soon enough, Xenk caught up with them and heard their plight, but he didn't think it wise for them to risk using the helm. So the sisters demanded he liberate their family from the mind flayers instead, but Xenk hardly needed to be asked.

[[File:Zuphelithid.png|thumb|right|250px|right|''Brains versus brave.'']]
Xenk found and confronted the illithid overseers, demanding their surrender, but was surprised by the elder brain Zuphelithid and a pack of [[intellect devourer]]s. He battled through the walking brains and resisted the psychic assault that reawakened his old regrets about not saving him family, until a mind flayer enthralled Trick and took her the ''helmet of disjunction'' both. Xenk got Trap to safety before she could be caught too. They healed up and created a new and ingenious plan. This time, Xenk challenged Zuphelithid to a ''[[compelled duel]]'' to the death. But it was a ruse, and Xenk fought and kept the elder brain in place long enough for Trap to drive a drill-headed mining machine into it, and Xenk split it in twain with his sword. The remaining illithids escaped and the svirfnebli were liberated.

Afterward, the deep gnomes thanked Xenk and wished to repay him. He asked only that they conceal the ''helmet of disjunction'' within the ruins of the hanging city of Dolblunde. They fashioned a mechanical locked vault inside a statue, and declared it to be "the last place anyone who values their life would go." Trick and Trap and all the deep gnomes waved Xenk farewell. He departed them and emerged from the Underdark in the region of [[Neverwinter]].

===Later Heroics===
On one occasion, Xenk worked with the [[Emerald Enclave]], an order of guardians of nature, to thwart the destructive schemes of the [[church of Talos]], the [[Talos|Storm Lord]].

On another, he fought battles in the desert of [[Anauroch]] beside a warrior of the [[Elk tribe]]; this man, a cousin of Holga, vouched for him as a good man.

Once, Xenk even held back a [[beholder]] with nothing more than a sharpened gourd, or something else sharp, at least according to Simon's uncle.

===Working with Thieves===
[[File:Xenk in Harper sanctuary.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''When you realize that, once again, you're the only one who read the lore.'']]
By the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Xenk was operating out of the village of [[Mornbryn's Shield]] on the [[River Surbrin]], Edgin was scornful, thinking all Thayans were killers corrupted by the evil [[Red Wizards of Thay]] and disgusted by Xenk's righteousness. Nevertheless, the others gained Xenk's interest by speaking of their desire to rob and bring down the corrupt and tyrannical Lord [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] of [[Neverwinter]] and of his connection to a Red Wizard, [[Sofina]].

Xenk led the party into the [[Kryptgarden Forest]], where an entrance to the Underdark lay, in a deep hole that he termed "the orifice". On the way, he asked about Edgin's past, why he had left the Harpers and Zia's death, whilst warning that Zia may not be willing to be resurrected. He also tried to improve Edgin's views of Thayans by sharing his own tragic past.

[[File:Honor Among Thieves publicity image 2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Even fearless paladins have "Oh, [[naeth]]!" moments.'']]
After venturing down into the Underdark, the party passed uninterested [[intellect devourer]]s and arrived at the ruins of Dolblunde, wherein Xenk had hidden the ''helmet of disjunction'' long ago. After negotiating the trapped collapsing bridges, that is triggering and collapsing them before Xenk could finish explaining the intricately complicated technique needed to cross them, Simon noticed that Marlamin's walking stick was in fact a [[Hither-Thither Staff]], and they used it to cross into the city. Finding and opening the gnomish mechanical box, Xenk retrieved the helm. But that was when a band of undead Thayan assassins led by Dralas showed up, having been sent by Sofina to find and kill the thieves. Xenk and Dralas taunted one another; it was not the first time they'd clashed. They fought valiantly, with Xenk handily taking down the whole squad of assassins and impressing the others, as his companions provided a little aid

[[File:TJN Xenk, Edgin, and Holga.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A parting of the ways.'']]
Some time later, with the ''helmet of disjunction'' in their possession, they emerged in the [[Sea of Swords]] and swam to shore, where they rested on the rocky beach. There, Xenk said his farewells; though they asked him to stay and assist them, he preferred to let Edgin, Holga and the others use what they had and rise to the occasion themselves rather than for him to keep carrying them himself. He departed down the beach, heading off for adventures anew.

In time, Edgin, Holga, Simon, and Doric would save Neverwinter, and Edgin even kept his oath to Xenk about distributing the wealth among the people of the city. Afterward, Xenk encountered the fugitive Forge Fitzwilliam in a forest one night and returned him to face justice; he was incarcerated in [[Revel's End]].
