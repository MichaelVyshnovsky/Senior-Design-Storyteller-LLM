Another older sibling was [[Dariel Tefoco]] who served the [[Flaming Fist]]. [[Thegglis Tefoco|Thegglis]] and [[Crowell Tefoco|Crowell]] were traveling caravan guards, while the youngest of the bunch, [[Maggie Tefoco|Maggie]] and others, still lived with Oliver and Kroyce as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.",

Oliver left behind to run the shop, to Kroyce's dismay. Hemjax and the family were given Uncle Sternwell's shearing shed to live in."
