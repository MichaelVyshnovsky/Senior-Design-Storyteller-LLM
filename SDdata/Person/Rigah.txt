Rigah was a berserker from Rashemen who traveled across the Sword Coast on his dajemma, alongside his Wychlaran companion Julann, in the midâ€“14 century DR.
In contrast to fickle Julann, Rigah was quite rational and resolute. He was quite cautious and didnt trust others as readily as she.
Among Rigahs possessions was the enchanted dragon blade.
Rigah served as Julanns bodyguard. While he was wholly dedicated to her protection, he grew increasingly frustrated with the lack of focus in their travels.
Rigah and Julann took leave of Rashemen on their dajemma to seek out the Bhaalspawn that was referred to in the prophecies of Alaundo.
In their years of travel, Rigah and Julann were often guided by little more than Julanns whims. As of the , they had heard about the rumors of a divine being and started following along with the Shining Crusade.
