'''Rigah''' was a [[Rashemaar berserkers|berserker]] from [[Rashemen]] who traveled across the [[Sword Coast]] on his ''[[dajemma]]'', alongside his [[Wychlaran]] companion [[Julann]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
In contrast to fickle Julann, Rigah was quite rational and resolute. He was quite cautious and didn't trust others as readily as she.

==Possessions==
Among Rigah's possessions was the [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] ''[[dragon blade]]''.

==Relationships==
Rigah served as Julann's bodyguard. While he was wholly dedicated to her protection, he grew increasingly frustrated with the lack of focus in their travels.

==History==
Rigah and Julann took leave of Rashemen on their ''dajemma'' to seek out the [[Bhaalspawn]] that was referred to in the [[Prophecies of Alaundo|prophecies]] of [[Alaundo]].

In their years of travel, Rigah and Julann were often guided by little more than Julann's whims. As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, they had heard about the rumors of a divine being and started following along with the [[Shining Crusade]].
