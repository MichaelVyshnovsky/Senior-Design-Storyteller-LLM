He lived in a mansion that bordered the sea, and after he passed on, was buried in this exact place. After his death, the mansion was fiercely guarded by undead beings.\nIt is said that Rhaumon Bloodaxe never fully left his waterfront home. Rumor had it that only fully loyal inhabitants of Ruathym could stay the night there without harm coming to them."
