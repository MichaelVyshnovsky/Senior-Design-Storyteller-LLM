During the Harvest Fair in the , Webb and his brothers competed in the Harvest Brawl. The Kalach-Cha, Amie, and Bevil, after defeating the Lannon siblings, wouldve faced Webb, Ward, and Wyl. If the Kalach-Cha, Amie, and Bevil were defeated, they couldve asked Merring for a rematch or acknowledged that the Mossfelds had won.
During the attack of bladelings and duergar, the Kalach-Cha couldve encountered Webb, who would fight the attackers. Once finished, he couldve been asked to go to the field to defend the town.
