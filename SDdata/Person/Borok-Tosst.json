In life, he was a wizard slayer and a serpent-tailed yuan-ti and one of six trusted lieutenants who served Nan Kung Chi. He continued to do the same long after death. In the , the crypt faced an illithid incursion led by Goxxa the alhoon. The mind flayers consumed the ancient preserved minds of the crypts dead and sought the Claw of the Black Leopard. At the same time, a vampire thief named Hexxat arrived at the tomb at the behest of her master Larloch, who sought the tombs magical treasure. A ghostly monk named Ki Chin Sang stood guard over Nan Kung Chis tomb and demanded anyone seeking entrance to defeat six of Nan Kung Chis trusted undead lieutenants, who all were interred together. When Hexxat and her allies challenged the lieutenants to battle, Borok-Tosst was joined by Weimin Min, Yi Niu, Ming-hua Dai, and Jiang Dai, and, presumably, was defeated."
