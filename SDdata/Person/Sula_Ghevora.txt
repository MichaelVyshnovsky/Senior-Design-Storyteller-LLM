{{quote|''Got gold, I hope? Most of us'll be lucky to afford a basement in the Upper City.''|Sula Ghevora}}

==Description==
Sula was a [[human]] woman of tan skin tone and dar brown eyes. She wore quality clothes with blue hues being favored, and [[gold]]en jewelry.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, the gates between the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate and its more affluent [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] were closed, monitored by the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries and allowing only the wealthy and current residents of the Upper City through. Sula Ghevora was among those Baldurians who sought entrance into the Upper City, lamenting that people like her could barely afford to rent a basement in the rich upper-crust neighborhood.
