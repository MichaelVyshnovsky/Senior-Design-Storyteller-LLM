'''Hisao Matsutomo''' was a head of the [[Matsutomo]] clan and a [[daimyo]] of [[Aru Province]] in [[Wa]] in the early 1700s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==History==
Hisao succeeded his father, [[Masakito Matsutomo]], on his death in {{YearlinkConvert|1725|WY}}. Hisao lacked his father's wisdom and corruption flourished in Aru Province. Many of his advisors established their own "business interests", most egregiously charging pilgrims a "visitation fee" to worship at the [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]]. When the [[shogun]] heard of his violation of tradition, Hisao and the Matsutomos were removed from power in {{YearlinkConvert|1730|WY}}, and the daimyate was passed to the [[Yayazato]] clan.
