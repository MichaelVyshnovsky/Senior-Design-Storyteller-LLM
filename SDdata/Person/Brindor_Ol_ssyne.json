Brindor raised an army for Aglarond, and constructed the Emmech fortress (later renamed Undumor), the citadel Glarondar, and the Watchwall.\nBrindor also commissioned the original palace on the site where the Palace of the Simbul stood, but this original wooden structure was burned down during a red dragon attack.\nBrindors son and sole heir was Althon (later Althon \"the Old\"). He had blood ties with Aubayreer of Milvarn."
