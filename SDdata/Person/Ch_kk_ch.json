Seriously cool. My favorite [[fireworks]] color is, like, dark violet, because it's the most cool!''|Ch'kk'ch}}",
        "Description": "Like her mother, Ch'kk'ch was a [[human]] girl with a light skin tone. But unlike Ma, she had dark red hair, and her eyes were blue.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, Festina brought her daughter to a performance of some showy magics by three spellslingers, on the [[Murl's Rest]] plaza in front of [[Sorcerous Sundries]]. The mother was delighted by her daughter's joy seeing the magical show. It was the most fun the girl had since her birthday."
