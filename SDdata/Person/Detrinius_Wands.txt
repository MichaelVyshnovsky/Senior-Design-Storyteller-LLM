'''Detrinius Wands''' was a [[Faerun]]ian [[lich]] in [[T'u Lung]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Detrinius Wands was a lich from Faerun who decided to go to [[Kara-Tur]], believing it was a land without [[cleric]]s. However, he was trapped by a ''[[curse]]'' in a maze in T'u Lung's [[Underdark]].

==Personality==
Detrinius went mad from solitude. He was desperate for company. If he met someone, Detrinius tried by all means not to remain alone anymore. He also wanted news about the outside world.
