He was killed by Prince Durothil.\nCirca , Durothil was planning to let his tame silver dragon Silverywing free from magical confinement, and sent Sharlario Moonflower to the top of a mountain in preparation. But Mahatnartorian appeared and attacked Sharlario. Silverywing emerged from the magical pocket dimension, ridden by Durothil, and attacked Mahatnartorian, but she was not powerful enough to defeat him. The fight was over quickly and resulted in the deaths of Silverywing, Mahatnartorian and Durothil himself. Ghaunadaur had his sacrifice."
