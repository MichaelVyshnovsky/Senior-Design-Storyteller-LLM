        "mainbody": "{{otheruses4|the Sembian man|the Zakharan god|Kor}}\n'''Kor''' was a patron of the [[Cutter's Dip]] tavern in [[Yhaunn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He was a big and surly man.",
        "Relationships": "Kor was friends with a few other unpleasant individuals at the Dip, including the bandits [[Stag (bandit)|Stag]] and [[Drik]], the old lecher [[Noyle]], and the half-mad [[Lahumbra Sashtyn]].",
        "History": "In [[Eleasis]] of [[1373 DR]], Kor was drawn into a fight between the undercover priestess [[Feena Archwood]] and her old foes Stag and Drik. Though Kor wanted to stay out of it, the tussle grew and antagonized him as well, culminating in Feena being trapped in a boisterous round of [[Dip's Stagger]]. The population of the Dip had her at their mercy until she was unexpectedly rescued by the [[Sharran]] [[Keph Thingoleir]], who escorted her out of the tavern under the glower of Kor and his company."
