Though Kor wanted to stay out of it, the tussle grew and antagonized him as well, culminating in Feena being trapped in a boisterous round of Dips Stagger. The population of the Dip had her at their mercy until she was unexpectedly rescued by the Sharran Keph Thingoleir, who escorted her out of the tavern under the glower of Kor and his company."
