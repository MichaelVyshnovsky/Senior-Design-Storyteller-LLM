        "mainbody": "Arrizz was a drow elf in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.\nArrizz was a member of a drow noble house very far from the Moonsea until he betrayed his house and struck out on his own. He escaped pursuit by bounty hunters in the Underdark until he reached the Moonsea.\nNear Cormanthor, Arrizz met the moon elf scout Deriel Rethslane and the two fell in love.\nIn the , Arrizz was pursued by duergar bounty hunters and contracted the darkborne rot illness. So he hid near the Goodroot farm. Unfortunately, he infected the half-elf farmers, and they died. Soon after, the farmers daughter, Constance Goodroot, found him but a patrol of Red Plumes arrived to retrieve the red dye that the Goodroots produced from the beet juice harvested on the farm, as well as some adventurers and even two duergar bounty hunters.\nLater that year, Arrizz was saved from his illness but was captured by the Red Plumes and destined to go to the Hillsfar Arena. His lover Deriel negotiated an exchange for him she would deliver them worthy fighters and they would release Arrizz.\nLater, in the , he agreed to work as smuggler to deliver goods from the surface to the refugees from Szith Morcane. Arrizz gained the help of a minstrel band led by a Joydancer of Lliira named Felratha. Together, they gained a shipment of supplies from the Zhentarim and planned to deliver them using the Waydown. For this they hired an adventuring party to escort them.\nHowever, during a subsequent journey in the Underdark, Arrizz was attacked by a group of githyanki.\nDespite being close-lipped, Arrizz never hesitated to criticize foolish or weak behavior. He truly wanted to abandoned the Moonsea area for all the bad things that had happened to him there. Arrizz never wanted to speak about Deriel again. He was still a drow inside, evil and intolerant of weakness."
