        "mainbody": "'''Arrizz''' was a [[drow]] [[elf]] in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Arrizz was a member of a drow noble house very far from the Moonsea until he betrayed his house and struck out on his own. He escaped pursuit by bounty hunters in the [[Underdark]] until he reached the Moonsea.\n\nNear [[Cormanthor]], Arrizz met the [[moon elf]] scout [[Deriel Rethslane]] and the two fell in love.{{Cite adventurers league/Shackles of Blood|11}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, Arrizz was pursued by [[duergar]] bounty hunters and contracted the [[darkborne rot]] illness. So he hid near the [[Goodroot]] farm. Unfortunately, he infected the [[half-elf]] farmers, and they died. Soon after, the farmer's daughter, [[Constance Goodroot]], found him but a patrol of [[Red Plumes]] arrived to retrieve the red [[dye]] that the Goodroots produced from the beet juice harvested on the farm, as well as some adventurers and even two [[duergar]] bounty hunters.\n\nLater that year, Arrizz was saved from his illness but was captured by the Red Plumes and destined to go to the [[Hillsfar Arena]]. His lover Deriel negotiated an exchange for him: she would deliver them worthy fighters and they would release Arrizz.{{Cite adventurers league/Shackles of Blood|23}}\n\nLater, in the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, he agreed to work as smuggler to deliver goods from the surface to the refugees from [[Szith Morcane]]. Arrizz gained the help of a minstrel band led by a Joydancer of [[Lliira]] named [[Felratha]]. Together, they gained a shipment of supplies from the [[Zhentarim]] and planned to deliver them using the [[Waydown]]. For this they hired an adventuring party to escort them.{{Cite adventurers league/The Waydown|5-7}}\n\nHowever, during a subsequent journey in the Underdark, Arrizz was attacked by a group of [[githyanki]].{{Cite adventurers league/Writhing in the Dark|8-9}}",
        "Personality": "Despite being close-lipped, Arrizz never hesitated to criticize foolish or weak behavior. He truly wanted to abandoned the Moonsea area for all the bad things that had happened to him there. Arrizz never wanted to speak about Deriel again. He was still a drow inside, evil and intolerant of weakness."
