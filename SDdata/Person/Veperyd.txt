Veperyd was one of the fire giant lieutenants of Queen Hledh Hellspawn, who ruled the city of Maerimydra in the Deep Wastes in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1486 DR, Veperyd was in charge of the security of Coliseum with four bar-lgura guards until an adventuring party hired by Solom Nedrazak to collect samples of fiendish fire giant blood confronted and defeated him and his minions.
Veperyd enjoyed the power of his position and did anything to keep control of the fighting in the Coliseum.
