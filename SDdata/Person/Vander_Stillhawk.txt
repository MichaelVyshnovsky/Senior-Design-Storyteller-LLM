'''Vander Stillhawk''' was a [[human]] [[ranger]] of [[Tethyr]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a companion to [[Zaranda Star|Queen Zaranda Star]] before her ascension to the crown.''Heroes' Lorebook'' calls Vander a [[wood elf]], but all other sources make it clear he was human.

==Description==
Vander was tall, slender, and long-limbed, with hard muscles under dark and weathered skin. He could be considered handsome, if one liked the tall, dark, and brooding sort. Vander could not speak, as  but rather communicated through elven hand signals.

==History==
When Vander was a boy, [[orc]]ish raiders cut out his tongue, leaving him mute.

He was raised by the [[elves]] of the [[Elven Woods]]. The elves not only trained him in use of the bow, but also in elven hand signals, allowing him to communicate with others.

He became a companion of Zaranda Star during the [[Reclamation Wars]] of Tethyr.<ref><ref>

In the battle for [[Zazesspur]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Vander was slain. Yet [[Shield of Innocence]], an [[orog]] [[paladin]] of [[Torm]], beseeched his god to restore Vander to life, before he sacrificed himself.<ref>

Afterward, Vander attained high position in the court of Tethyr, which grants him many titles: Monarch's Champion, Regent of [[Coram Rhindaun|Prince Coram Rhindaun]], and leader of the [[Warriors of the Star]]. The former title placed him in charge of the monarchs' safety as the Warriors were the personal guard of Queen Zaranda Star and [[Haedrak III|King Haedrak III]]. He was also one of the Queen's Councilors. Prince Coram even received his name, Vander.<ref>

==Possessions==
He carried a magical elven ''+1 [[longbow]]'', as well as a [[longsword]] and a clip-bladed hunting knife.

==Abilities==
As well as being able to use any kind of [[bow]], Vander possessed an innate magical power to repair a damaged arrow simply by running his lips along the shaft.

==Personality==
Like most rangers, Stillhawk despised entering a city, preferring to remain in nature. His expression was almost always grim.
