        "History": "Miverra was a priestess of the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]].\n\nIn [[1377 DR]], she was sent to ask for an audience with the [[Conclave of Sshamath]], rulers of the city of [[Sshamath]].\n\nHowever [[Q'arlynd Melarn]], a fellow devotee of Eilistraee, recommended to Miverra to trust only [[Seldszar Elpragh]], the Master of the [[College of Divination]] and his patron, when discussing about a strange magical phenomena that had affected both wizards and priests.\n\nSo Miverra and Seldszar spoke about the magic phenomena that involved disturbance in the [[faerzress]] spreading from the main temple of [[Kiaransalee]]. At last they decided that a joint-force of Eilistraee's priests and wizards of the Divination's College would scout the temple of Kiaransalee."
