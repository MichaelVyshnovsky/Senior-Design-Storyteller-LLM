'''Tappy Foamstrap''' was an innkeeper in [[Blingdenstone]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Tappy was very bored because nothing ever seemed to happen in her inn. If new foreign guests arrived, she was very keen to serve them well.

==History==
Tappy went to the reclaimed Blingdenstone and reopened the [[Foaming Mug]] inn, notorious in the days before the [[drow]] invasion of [[1371 DR]]. However, during the [[demon]]ic crisis in the [[Underdark]], because the city was not yet established (and because of the arrival of the [[demon lord]]s), she had very few customers, and even spent months without seeing anyone.
