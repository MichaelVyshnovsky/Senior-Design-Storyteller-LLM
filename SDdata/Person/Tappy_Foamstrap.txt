Tappy Foamstrap was an innkeeper in Blingdenstone in the late 15 century DR.
Tappy was very bored because nothing ever seemed to happen in her inn. If new foreign guests arrived, she was very keen to serve them well.
Tappy went to the reclaimed Blingdenstone and reopened the Foaming Mug inn, notorious in the days before the drow invasion of 1371 DR. However, during the demonic crisis in the Underdark, because the city was not yet established (and because of the arrival of the demon lords), she had very few customers, and even spent months without seeing anyone.
