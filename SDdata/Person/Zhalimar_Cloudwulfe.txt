Zhalimar Cloudwulfe was an agent of the Iron Throne, and a follower of the Bhaalspawn Sarevok.
In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, Zhalimar Cloudwulfe was one of several agents sent from abroad to the city of Baldurs Gate to advise Thaldorn in his negotiations with Emissary Tar and the citys Council of Four.
Unbeknownst to the Iron Throne, Zhalimar and his companions Gardush, Naaman, Diyab, Aasim, and Alai, were all sworn servants of Sarevok who sought to further the Bhaalspawns agenda rather than their employers.
Before they could sign a treaty with the Council of Four, Zhalimar and his fellow lackeys were intercepted by Abdel Adrian and defeated on the top story of the Baldurian Iron Throne headquarters.
