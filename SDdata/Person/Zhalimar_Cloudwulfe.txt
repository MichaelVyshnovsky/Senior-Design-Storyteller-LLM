'''Zhalimar Cloudwulfe''' was an agent of the [[Iron Throne]], and a follower of the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Sarevok]].

==History==
In the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], Zhalimar Cloudwulfe was one of several agents sent from abroad to the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] to advise [[Thaldorn]] in his negotiations with [[Tar (emissary)|Emissary Tar]] and the city's [[Council of Four]].

Unbeknownst to the Iron Throne, Zhalimar and his companions [[Gardush]], [[Naaman]], [[Diyab]], [[Aasim (human)|Aasim]], and [[Alai]], were all sworn servants of Sarevok who sought to further the Bhaalspawn's agenda rather than their employer's.

Before they could sign a treaty with the Council of Four, Zhalimar and his fellow lackeys were intercepted by [[Abdel Adrian]] and defeated on the top story of the Baldurian [[Iron Throne headquarters]].
