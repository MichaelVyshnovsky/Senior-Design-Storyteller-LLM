Dreena Dellmon was a druid during the late 15th century DR.
Dreena was a druid and an agent of the Emerald Enclave.
In 1491 DR, the Iceshield orcs attacked many farms around the Dellmon farm. However, Kerbin Dellmon refused to abandon his farm and go to Yartar. Dreena sent messages both to the Enclave and to the elves of the High Forest asking for help. With the lucky arrival of some adventurers, the Dellmons managed to defend the farm.
