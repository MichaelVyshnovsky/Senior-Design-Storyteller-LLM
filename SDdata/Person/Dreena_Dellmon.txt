'''Dreena Dellmon''' was a [[druid]] during the late 15th century DR.

==Activitivies==
Dreena was a druid and an agent of the [[Emerald Enclave]].

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], the [[Iceshield]] [[orc]]s attacked many farms around the Dellmon farm. However, [[Kerbin Dellmon]] refused to abandon his farm and go to [[Yartar]]. Dreena sent messages both to the Enclave and to the [[elf|elves]] of the [[High Forest]] asking for help. With the lucky arrival of some adventurers, the Dellmons managed to defend the farm.
