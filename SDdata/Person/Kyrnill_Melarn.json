When House Kenafin and House Horlbar merged to form House Melarn, Kyrnill allowed Zhindia Horlbar to assume leadership of the house, expecting that Zhindia would die in a power struggle. Zhindia survived, however, and as First Priestess, Kyrnill found great pleasure in seeing Zhindias power undermined.\nCategoryDrow\nCategoryMatron mothers\nCategoryMembers of House Kenafin\nCategoryMembers of House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)\nCategoryInhabitants of Lolths Web\nCategoryInhabitants of West Wall\nCategoryInhabitants of Menzoberranzan\nCategoryInhabitants of the Northdark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Upperdark\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\n7gl8qv72kqkxy7ni37fdkul9z0j9uf8"
