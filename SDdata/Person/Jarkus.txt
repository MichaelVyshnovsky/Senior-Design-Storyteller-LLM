'''Jarkus''' was a [[half-elf]] [[thief]] and [[scout]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who died while on an expedition in the [[Shining Sea]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|20-21}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2,4}} Jarkus was among the members of this group, alongside his thief wife [[Periscot]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2}}

On [[Marpenoth 11]], five [[velociraptor]]s attacked the expedition's campsite and the team managed to slay them with minimal casualties. The next day Jarkus left with the [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] [[Wedonai]] and the [[mage]] [[Briella Farthing]] to check on the ''[[Sacred Heart of the Beast]]'',{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|11-12}}

Sometime between then and [[Marpenoth 23]], the two men died from the olive slimes and metamorphosed into [[slime creature]]s. Their prone bodies were later discovered by a group of [[adventurer]]s hired by Briella's father [[Maskin Farthing|Maskin]]. The two bodies sprung to life as the adventurers got close to them and had to be fought off, finally ending their existence.
