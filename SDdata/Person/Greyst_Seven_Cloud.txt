'''Greyst Seven Cloud''' was the last ruler of [[Ixtzul]] in [[Maztica]].

==History==
Greyst was the fourteenth Revered Counselor of Ixtzul. Towards the end of his life he knew that the valley was dying because of over-farming and crowding, but did not want to abandon guardianship of the [[Star Worm]]. Thus, he created the [[bacar]] from ants using [[pluma]] and [[hishna]] magic.
