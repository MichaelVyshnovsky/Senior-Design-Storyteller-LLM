        "mainbody": "{{otheruses4|the priestess of Talos|the Zakaran vizier|Tanatha}}\n'''Tanatha''' was a [[human]] [[priestess]] of [[Talos]] in service of Lord [[Vorik Aris]], operating in [[Wyvernwatch Castle]] in the [[Stonelands]] around [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "Tanatha was darkly beautiful but usually hid it with her armor, appearing anonymous and terrifying instead.",
        "Personality": "She was cruel and unpredictable, and was fully devoted to her patron and his domain of upheaval and destruction.",
        "Abilities": "Tanatha was a powerful cleric, and could call forth many spells which she largely used to smite her enemies. Her devotion as a [[stormlord (priest)|stormlord]] gave her additional storm-themed powers, including ''[[shocking grasp]]'', ''[[call lightning]]'', ''[[water walk]]'', ''[[control winds]]'', and ''[[lightning bolt]]''.",
        "Possessions": "Tanatha wore ornate black ''+3 [[full plate]]'' with a matching ''[[helm of comprehending languages & reading magic]]'' that fully hid her identity, and carried a ''+3 [[footman's mace]]'' and ''+3 [[shield]]''. She also wore a ''[[ring of regeneration]]'' and had several vials of ''[[unholy water]]''.",
        "Activities": "In [[1369 DR]], she served Lord Aris as his spiritual advisor as he schemed to overthrow King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|Azoun IV]] and enthrone himself. She greatly anticipated the delightful chaos and war he would wreak upon [[Cormyr]], but had absolutely no loyalty to him beyond that, and was ready to abandon Lord Aris the moment his defeat seemed likely."
