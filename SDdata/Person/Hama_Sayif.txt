'''Hama Sayif''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[Mystic (Zakhara)|mystic]] who ran a small stand within the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
For a fee, Hama would give his customers advice or even dance for them. Because of his spirituality, Hama sometimes experienced strange visions about his clients while performing a dance.

==History==
Hama was originally from [[Al-Akara Mountains]] where he was one of the [[Dancing Dwarves]], but left home to eventually find his true calling in Huzuz.

==Relationships==
[[Sika al-Bana]] and [[Bara Minora]] worked for Hama, believing that he would make them rich one day. They handled all of the haggling on Hama's behalf.
