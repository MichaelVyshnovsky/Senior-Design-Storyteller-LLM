Hama Sayif was a dwarven mystic who ran a small stand within the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
For a fee, Hama would give his customers advice or even dance for them. Because of his spirituality, Hama sometimes experienced strange visions about his clients while performing a dance.
Hama was originally from Al-Akara Mountains where he was one of the Dancing Dwarves, but left home to eventually find his true calling in Huzuz.
Sika al-Bana and Bara Minora worked for Hama, believing that he would make them rich one day. They handled all of the haggling on Hamas behalf.
