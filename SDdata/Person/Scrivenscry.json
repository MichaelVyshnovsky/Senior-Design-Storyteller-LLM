The arcanaloth was ferocious and heinous, especially to those in service to it.\nIt had in its servitude a nervous, albino, blind, awakened giant penguin called Kingsport.\nThe arcanaloth owned a chime of opening, and three spell scrolls.\nIn the 15 century DR, the fiend made its way to the Prime Material Plane. It sought out four tomes containing the true names of every yugoloth in existence."
