'''Rarnok Jadronson''' was a [[ogre]] [[mercenary]] of [[The Teeth (mercenaries)|the Teeth]] in the year [[1375 DR]].

==Description==
Rarnok was {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} tall, a full foot taller than most ogres. As a member of the Teeth, his own teeth were sharpened to points.

==Possessions==
Rarnok had a ''+1 [[greataxe]]'', the hilt of which was studded with the teeth of his past victims.

==Relationships==
Rarnok's father was [[Jadron the Fang]], founder of the Teeth.

==History==
Rarnok was sent as the leader of five more Teeth mercenaries to aid in the [[Zhentarim]] invasion of [[Shadowdale]] in 1375 DR. They attacked and destroyed the village of [[Oakwood Knoll]] alongside mercenaries from the [[Skull and Club]], losing two ogre warriors in the process. Later the two groups argued over the spoils, almost coming to blows, but may have been interrupted and slain by passing [[adventurer]]s on their way to relieve [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]].
