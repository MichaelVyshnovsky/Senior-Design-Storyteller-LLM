Gerti Orelsdottr was a female frost giant who lived in an ice and rock cavern in the Tholvarr region of the Spine of the World called Shining White. She was a prominent member of the Yargray tribe.
Gerti was over  tall and had blue skin. She was attractive, with dark blue eyes and long golden hair. She had a muscular build and wore a silver wolf fur cloak with a brown leather dress, a necklace of wolves teeth, and boots topped with the same silvery fur. Her boots were rumored to be magical and quickened her strides.
Gerti spent much of her time teaching the other giants from nearby tribes, the teachings of Auril the Frostmaiden.
She sought to establish a council of jarls and have her fellow clerics join their magic to bring about an everlasting winter that would cover all of the North.
She was the sole daughter and heir to Jarl Orel the Grayhand, the frost giant patriarch who united the various families and clans around the Spine of the World to form a unified frost giant populace. 
She held command over her powerful frost giant kin named Yerki.
Many of the frost giants clerics of Tholvarr supported Gertis aims and her vision. Many of the tribes warriors were distrustful of Auril and sought to stop her by means of their own strength as leaders.
Circa the , with her father on his death bed and no more than a figurehead, Gerti was considered  most likely candidate to assume power as jarl over the frost giants once Jarl Orel died.
