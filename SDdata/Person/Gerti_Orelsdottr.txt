'''Gerti Orelsdottr''' was a female [[frost giant]] who lived in an ice and rock cavern in the [[Tholvarr]] region of the [[Spine of the World]] called [[Shining White]]. She was a prominent member of the [[Yargray]] tribe.

==Description==
Gerti was over {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} tall and had blue skin. She was attractive, with dark blue eyes and long golden hair. She had a muscular build and wore a silver [[wolf]] fur [[cloak]] with a brown leather dress, a necklace of wolves teeth, and boots topped with the same silvery fur. Her boots were rumored to be magical and quickened her strides.

==Activities==
Gerti spent much of her time teaching the other giants from nearby tribes, the teachings of [[Auril]] the Frostmaiden.

She sought to establish a council of jarls and have her fellow [[cleric]]s join their [[magic]] to bring about an everlasting winter that would cover all of [[Northwest Faer√ªn|the North]].

==Relationships==
She was the sole daughter and heir to Jarl [[Orel|Orel the Grayhand]], the frost giant patriarch who united the various families and clans around the Spine of the World to form a unified frost giant populace. 

She held command over her powerful frost giant kin named [[Yerki]].

Many of the frost giants [[cleric]]s of Tholvarr supported Gerti's aims and her vision. Many of the tribes' warriors were distrustful of Auril and sought to stop her by means of their own strength as leaders.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, with her father on his death bed and no more than a figurehead, Gerti was considered  most likely candidate to assume power as jarl over the frost giants once Jarl Orel died.
