Now he remembers absolutely nothing of his past life. He only knows this new one I've given him. He derives a large amount of pleasure from, say, getting me tea, administering a stinky but relaxing backrub, or eating the brains of my enemies. The spiritual implications are pretty profound here, right? Here's a husk imbued with purpose, given a direction, made useful in the most economic sense, and happy in the metaphysical sense.''|Excerpt from ''[[The Amiable Art of Necromancy]]''}}",
        "History": "Nascent Owens was turned into an [[undead]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. His mistress, Cherish Hollow, believed that the shambling creature derived pleasure from giving her backrubs, serving [[tea]], and eating the brains of her enemies. Despite Nascent remembering nothing of lis life nor having any sentience, Cherish believed that the zombie was a worthy company in her loneliness."
