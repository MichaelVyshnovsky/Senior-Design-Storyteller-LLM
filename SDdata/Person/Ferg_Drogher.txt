{{quote|''You're a recent arrival for sure, still bearing dust from the road... but you have something they lack. Dignity.''|Ferg Drogher}}

==Description==
Ferg was a fair-skinned man with dark brown hair and brown eyes. He fore his facial hair in a thin monstrance and a goatee. Ferg wore a simple [[leather]] jerkin and was armed with two [[dagger]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in the [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of Baldur's Gate, displacing countless refugees along the way. Many of the refugees arrived at Baldur's Gate searching for safety behind its walls; however, most were refused entry â€“ those lacking [[coin]] or proper paperwork. The Rivington district became a refugee tent city, igniting xenophobia among the locals. Ferg Drogher, a peddler of mementos from Rivington, despised the newcomers and was among those who aggressively advocated against the refugees.

Secretly, Ferg Drogher was a member of the [[Church of Shar]] that operated in Baldur's Gate's seedy underbelly. He was stationed in Rivington as the cult's lookout.
