The Sentinel was a mysterious figure who oversaw the Temple of Mystra in Elventree around 1367 DR.
The Sentinel wore at mask at all times to hide his appearance and muffle his voice.
The Sentinel was a skilled wizard. Though all were allowed to use the special spellcasting chamber within the temple, evil-doers were watched closely by the Sentinel. He had a knack for knowing the hearts of any who visited the temple.
