        "mainbody": "'''Hammar Breskult''' was a highly skilled [[warrior]] and one of the nine founding members of the shady mercantile organization known as the [[Great Goblet]]. As of the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], he was a member in good standing.",
        "Description": "Breskult was tall in stature with a well-muscled physique. He had a full beard that he kept neatly trimmed in the shape of a [[shovel]] blade. He typically wore a suit of [[Plate mail|field plate]] that bore the rusting scars of years of combat, and carried a [[greatsword]].",
        "Personality": "Hammar had the calm demeanor of someone who was quite sure of himself and didn't have to prove it to anyone.",
        "Abilities": "He was an excellent fighter and a former leader of a mercenary company. His skill with battle strategy and personal combat translated into dirty deals and confidence schemes in service to the Great Goblet.",
        "Possessions": "In addition to his armor and sword, Hammar had several [[dagger]]s of various types hidden on his person. Like all of the nine Lords, he possessed a [[gold]]en goblet that contained a desiccated finger or toe of a former colleague that tried to assert his dominance over the others. Hammar was part of the conspiracy that brought down this self-appointed leader and then formed the Great Goblet. The goblet and its grisly contents were intended as a warning against treachery among the inner circle."
