Raegar tried to flee by shrouding the street in fog, and Kemarn took his opportunity to strike. He cast a spell to unleash four huge black wolves that began attacking Khelben.\nA battle ensued between Kemarn and the defenders of the tower, who included Khelben, Elkord, Triam, Jalarra, Sarshel, Fhaornik, Maeralya and Pikar Salibuck.\nAfter Khelbens apprentices were able to dispel the wolves, Kemarn used a red fist-sized globe to summon a nishruu, which began attacking Khelben and the other defenders. A sun elf apprentice, Fhaornik, attempted to use a rod of absorption to kill the nishruu, but it did not stop the creature.\nKemarn threatened Raegar with death unless he handed over his sword, but Raegar stabbed him in the shin and caused him to fall from a roof. Raegar then escaped with the sword.\nThe nishruu was eventually defeated when Tarik and Chaid al Farid al Fuqani using floating disks to dump salt onto the creature."
