        "mainbody": "'''Kemarn Darkthrush''' was a [[wizard]] from [[Nesmé]] who attempted to kill [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] in [[1374 DR]].",
        "Background": "[[Raegar Stoneblade]] inadvertently exploded the side of [[Blackstaff Tower]] on 28 [[Uktar]] 1374 DR, causing Khelben to be wounded. Raegar tried to flee by shrouding the street in fog, and Kemarn took his opportunity to strike. He cast a [[spell]] to unleash four huge black [[wolf|wolves]] that began attacking Khelben.\n\nA battle ensued between Kemarn and the defenders of the tower, who included Khelben, [[Elkord]], [[Triam]], [[Jalarra Sakrel|Jalarra]], [[Sarshel (Person)|Sarshel]], [[Fhaornik]], [[Maeralya]] and [[Pikar Salibuck]].\n\nAfter Khelben's apprentices were able to dispel the wolves, Kemarn used a red fist-sized globe to summon a [[nishruu]], which began attacking Khelben and the other defenders. A [[sun elf]] apprentice, Fhaornik, attempted to use a ''[[rod of absorption]]'' to kill the nishruu, but it did not stop the creature.\n\nKemarn threatened Raegar with death unless he handed over his sword, but Raegar stabbed him in the shin and caused him to fall from a roof. Raegar then escaped with the sword.\n\nThe nishruu was eventually defeated when [[Tarik al Farid al Fuqani|Tarik]] and [[Chaid al Farid al Fuqani]] using floating disks to dump salt onto the creature."
