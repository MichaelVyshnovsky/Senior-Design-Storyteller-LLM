        "mainbody": "'''Hespal Nicort''' was a [[half-orc]] commander of the city guard of the city of [[Suormpar]] in [[Ulgarth]] around [[1367 DR]], leading 500 footmen and 200 archers. Although half orc, Hespal vehemently hated [[orc]]s.\n\nBy 1367 DR, warnings circulated that the [[gray orc]]s of the [[Dustwall Mountains]] were gathering in preparation for a major assault or raids into Ulgarth. Suormpar was directly threatened, and Hespal Nicort would be leading the defense."
