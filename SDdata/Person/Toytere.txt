Toytere was a halfling and the leader of the Dead Rats gang of Luskan in the late 15 century DR.
Toytere had a weasel-like face, a red beard, and sharpened teeth. He carried a cane topped by a gold rat.
Like many of the Rats, Toytere had some wererat blood although he never demonstrated any ability to shapeshift until his death when his body took the form of a wererat.
Toytere had the Sight, which allowed him to see the future when in a trance.
He was the biological twin brother of Cellica, who was the adopted sister of Kalen Dren. although he forgave Kalen before he died.
In the , Toytere ordered the capture of the powerful spellscarred wizard Myrin Darkdance with the intent of turning her over to the Coin Spinners gang for payment. Realizing they couldnt hold a mage as powerful as Myrin, they led her to believe she was the new leader of the gang.
Toytere was bitten by a rat infected with the Fury plague and slowly began to develop symptoms of the disease, becoming increasingly aggressive and irrational. Later, Toytere and the Rats turned on Myrin and he was killed by Sithe during a brawl at the Rats headquarters.
