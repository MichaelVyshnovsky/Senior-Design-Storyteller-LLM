'''Orcaheart''' was the village champion of the [[Ice Hunters]] that dwelled on the isle of [[Oyaviggaton]] ''circa'' the 1480s [[DR]].{{ToD-time}}

==Activities==
At times, the Ice Hunters' chieftain [[Barking Seal]] would propose duels between Orcaheart and wandering outlands that stepped upon their island home. If Orcaheart won, the outsiders would have to offer up some of their finer weapons, especially those made of [[steel]]. If he lost, his opponent and their companions were welcome to the village, and offered food and shelter. Orcaheart was often offered assistance in the form of healing magic but the village [[shaman]] [[Bonecarver]].
