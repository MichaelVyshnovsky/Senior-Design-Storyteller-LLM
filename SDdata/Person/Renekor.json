        "mainbody": "enekor was a beholder from the Underdark that inadvertently wandered into, and eventually took control of, the demiplane known as Wisteria Vale.\nLike other beholders, Renekor was exceedingly paranoid and saw anyone who entered into its lair as a threat. Renekor was definitely one to hold a grudge against anyone it believed had done it wrong.\nOnce he made its home within, Renekor came to see Wisteria Vale as his own personal lair and everyone within as its personal playthings. Renekor floated around the villages manor house and dawdled in its ballroom, surrounded by constructs it believed it had created.\nWhile in the Underdark, Renekor commanded a small cadre of minions, though who exactly they were was unknown.\nSometime in the , Renekor went into slumber and dreamt itself into a new reality. It was transported to the demiplane of Wisteria Vale―modeled after the ruined village of the same name―which was actually created to house a powerful former-agent of the Harpers named Arrant Quill. Renekor however believed Wisteria Vale came into existence as a result of its dream state, a sanctuary that manifested for its own personal use.\nRenekors presence within the demiplane warped its otherwise peaceful, if not entirely genuine, environment. Normal sounds and smells either went missing or manifested differently than expected, objects in the demiplane changed hues to much more vivid colors, or lost all their color entirely, and incongruous weather patterns manifested at odd times.\nMaking itself home in the simulacrum of the idyllic village, Renekor took over control of the local manor house. The intruding beholder capture Arrant Quill and trapped him within a magic painting and created an illusory of the Harper that appeared real in nearly every regard."
