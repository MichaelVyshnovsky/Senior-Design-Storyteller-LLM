        "History": "Before the [[Spellplague]], Kabal was an elderly member of the [[Many-Starred Cloak]] in Neverwinter. Due to his poor constitution, he was known as Kabal the Frail and rarely left the [[Cloak Tower]] except for weekly trips to the [[Protector's Enclave]] to buy medication from a young woman named [[Bradda]]. He fell in love with her, trying to teach her [[magic]] as an excuse to be closer to her.\n\nWhen the [[Spellplague]] hit in [[1385 DR]], he was pulled into the [[Far Realm]] along with many of his fellow wizards. The wizard [[Gyrion]] took charge and tried to helped them survive until they could escape. The energies of the Far Realm changed Kabal, transforming his body into living flame and his scrolls into a suit of armor to encase him. As a result, he began calling himself Kabal the Firesoul.\n\nEventually, Kabal and three other wizards (Gyrion, [[Nostura]], and [[Lukan]]) managed to escape the Far Realm and return to Neverwinter. Gyrion was angered by what he saw as the illegitimate rule of [[Dagult Neverember]], and believed that as the last survivors of the Many-Starred Cloak it was their duty to rule Neverwinter. The four formed the [[Cloaked Ascendancy]], and Gyrion used a replica of the Crown of Neverwinter to make himself appear as though he was the true heir of [[Nasher Alagondar]]. Shortly thereafter he appeared to a now-elderly Bradda and asked her to come with him, but she told him he was no longer the man she once knew. In a rage, he told her she would \"perish with the other fools.\".\n\nKabal aided his fellows in recruiting followers, and took charge of training them within a fiery demiplane featuring a series of metal platforms anchored high above a volcanic caldera. The Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge entered his demiplane and confronted him, but his fiery form left his armor and fled through a portal. He regrouped with Gyrion and Nostura at Lukan's hidden ritual site just outside the city, but when the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge arrived to stop them Gyrion sent him and Nostura away in order to finish the ritual himself. The pair sought refuge within the Spellplague Caverns at the bottom of the [[Chasm]], but the heroes followed and slew them for good."
