'''Ned''' was a [[horse]] belonging to Farmer [[Bortas]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
On [[Eleasis 16|Eleasias 16]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Ned was pulling a wagon with Farmer Bortas and his wife when they saw the ghost of the bandit chieftain [[Fastred]]. Bortas whipped poor Ned and they fled to the [[Swamp Rat]] tavern to raised a posse of fellow farmers to go [[ghost]]-hunting. Ned's involvement is unknown.
