        "mainbody": "'''Edwin Morahan''', a veteran paladin and [[Purple Dragons|Purple Dragon]], was the Lord Magister of Suzail around [[1479 DR]].\n\nAfter the skirmish with [[Sembia]], he retired and the King made him Lord Magister. He was very loyal to the throne, but his gruff attitude and need for strict order upset some nobles. His goal in the city was to fully establish the Suzail Writ, in which the King gave basic rights to the common people under the government. Though he saw this as simply doing his duty, this further upset the nobles but brought great adoration from the common people. His friend [[Vainrence]], the [[War Wizards]]' second-in-command, and the hard work of [[Eleanor Thond]], his herald, kept his title safe for the time being.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|64}}"
