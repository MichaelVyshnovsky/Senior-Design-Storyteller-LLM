Melusine Mellicot was a woman of the village of Swords Pool in the Vast in 1370 DR.
Melusine was a member of the Mellicot family, and sister to Melicent and Meliors. Together, the three sisters owned the Inn of the Nine Swords, a high-quality establishment.
The Mellicot sisters stocked the pond of Swords Pool with trout and a type of fish which they called "manyfins". They discouraged fishing, but some people did it anyway on dark nights.
