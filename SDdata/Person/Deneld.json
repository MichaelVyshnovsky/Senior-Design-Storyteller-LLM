        "mainbody": "orale Officer Deneld was an officer of the Shining Crusade that served at their military headquarters at Dragonspear Castle during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe was a charismatic man and a skilled orator. \nDeneld was a proud devotee of the Shining Lady Caelar Argent and was quite knowledgeable about her and her cause. \nDeneld wielded a +1 enchanted shortsword and a +1 enchanted light crossbow in battle. He supplemented his martial armaments with a wand of paralyzation. \nLikely due to his unwavering devotion and commitment, Deneld was a proud owner of one of the rings of the Crusade. \nHe also kept a shard that had broken off from the Altar of Tempus at the Hold of Battle Lions shrine. \nIn order to maintain morale among the crusaders, Deneld spent much of his time addressing the new recruits as they arrived at Castle Dragonspear. When he noticed individuals that showed real potential, he often had them speak to other crusaders and learn more about their shared cause and call to battle.\nAs an officer he received daily reports about the status of the Crusades efforts."
