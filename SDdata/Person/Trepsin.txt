Trepsin was a troll demon-worshiper, and a member of the reformed Cult of the Dragon under Severin Silrajin. 
Unlike others of his kind, Trepsin had four arms.
He loved hunting, whether animals or sentient beings. He liked to give the blood and bones of his prey to his ambush drakes and he loved to see the terror in the eyes of more intelligent prey.  
Trepsin acted as one of the lead custodians of the Cults hunting lodge in the Greypeak Mountains. Trepsin concerned himself only with savagery and saw more opportunities to pursue his interests with the Cult of the Dragon.
He was a devotee of the demon lord Baphomet.
Trepsin owned a filthy cape that was covered in mud and moss. While disgusting in appearance, it served him well against attacks made with fire.
He was also very devoted to the Wearer of Purple, Talis the White.
