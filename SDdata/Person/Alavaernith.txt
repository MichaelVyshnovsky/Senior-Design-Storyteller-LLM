'''Alavaernith''' was a [[wizard]] active sometime prior to or in the early 3{{rd}} century [[DR]] in southern [[Faerûn]].

==Personality==
Researchers after his time believed him to be close-mouthed about his secrets, and characteristically not effusive.

==Activities==
He had developed some [[spell]]s. Two researchers in [[Moonshorn Tower]] claimed he lived "south".

==History==
In the mid–8{{th}} century, the researchers [[Tabarast]] and [[Beldrune]] discussed Alavaernith's ''[[three-cats]]'' spell upon finding notes regarding a different magic of apparently similar purpose. They soon concluded it was probably not his magic.
