'''Karrel''' was a half–[[yuan-ti]] [[human]] woman and a [[cleric]] of [[Ubtao]] from [[Chult]]. She went to the [[Vilhon Reach]] in order to find information about [[Sibyl]] and kill her.

==Description==
Karrel was described as a woman of exquisite beauty. She had dark eyes, slightly wavy dark hair, dusky skin and high cheekbones. She was also very curvy and supple. She talked in a clipped accent. However, she had some reddish-brown scales over her breasts, giving away her yuan-ti heritage.

==Personality==
==Abilities==
As a halfbreed, she possessed all the magical abilities of a yuan-ti. She could [[entangle]] her opponents and [[Charm person|charm]] once a day. She was also capable of magically tying bows into knots, making them useless; causing [[fear]]; and plunging an area into [[darkness]]. However, despite being able to adopt the form of a [[snake]] at will, her bite was not venomous.

As a cleric of Ubtao, she could cast spells to [[endure elements|endure extreme temperatures]], heal, contact other beings' minds, [[entrance animals]], [[purify food and drink|purify water]], prevent others from detecting her through magical means and casting illusions on her, and [[Summon nature's ally|summon animals]].

==Possessions==
Karrel had a ''[[ring of mind shielding]]'', which she lost when a [[marilith]] cut three fingers off her right hand. She also had an [[ironwood]] [[club]], with a knobbed, fist-sized ball at one end, that hung from her belt.
