Karrel was a halfâ€“yuan-ti human woman and a cleric of Ubtao from Chult. She went to the Vilhon Reach in order to find information about Sibyl and kill her.
Karrel was described as a woman of exquisite beauty. She had dark eyes, slightly wavy dark hair, dusky skin and high cheekbones. She was also very curvy and supple. She talked in a clipped accent. However, she had some reddish-brown scales over her breasts, giving away her yuan-ti heritage.
As a halfbreed, she possessed all the magical abilities of a yuan-ti. She could entangle her opponents and charm once a day. She was also capable of magically tying bows into knots, making them useless causing fear and plunging an area into darkness. However, despite being able to adopt the form of a snake at will, her bite was not venomous.
As a cleric of Ubtao, she could cast spells to endure extreme temperatures, heal, contact other beings minds, entrance animals, purify water, prevent others from detecting her through magical means and casting illusions on her, and summon animals.
Karrel had a ring of mind shielding, which she lost when a marilith cut three fingers off her right hand. She also had an ironwood club, with a knobbed, fist-sized ball at one end, that hung from her belt.
