        "mainbody": "Prince '''Xeleth''' was the heir to the [[astral elf|elven]] [[Xaryxian Empire]] that spanned numerous planets across a [[Xaryxispace|star system]] far from [[Realmspace]].\n\n{{Quote|I am Prince Xeleth of the Xaryxian Empire. I've come for my sister Xedalli. Surrender her to me, you rats, or be annihilated.|Prince Xeleth, to a group of space-faring adventurers.}}",
        "Personality": "Prince Xeleth was extremely entitled and arrogant, believing himself superior to anyone who challenged him.",
        "Possessions": "He wore one of two paired ''[[ring of shooting stars|rings of shooting stars]]'', the other of which remained with his sister.",
        "Activities": "The prince traveled the stars aboard the flagship of the Xaryxian armada, a ''[[star moth]]'' called ''[[Xaryxia]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Prince Xeleth was the one known son of Emperor [[Xavan]], twin to his sister, Princess [[Xedalli]]. He was destined to rule the empire alongside his sister after their father's tenure was over.",
        "History": "[[File:Prince Xeleth.png|thumb|right|350px|''Prince Xeleth riding atop his solar dragon mount.'']]\nIn order to honor his father's dying wishes, Xeleth orchestrated an orbital assault on a lone planet out in [[Wildspace]]. He took command of the Xaryxian armada, and seeded the planet with energy from [[Xaryxis]], the dying star that lay at the heart of the Xaryxian Empire. In order to prevent his sister from claiming her portion of their birthright, he stranded her on the planet in the hopes her death would help restore the light of their dying star. \n\nFortunately for the princess, her ship was waylaid and she managed to join a group of [[adventurer]]s and fled the doomed planet about a [[spelljammer]]. Prince Xeleth took his fleet in pursuit of his sister and her companions to [[Doomspace]], and to the astral fortress of a [[mercane]] named [[Vocath]]. \n\nPrince Xeleth returned to the [[Temple of Light]] aboard the Xaryxian [[Imperial Citadel]], in order to carry out his father's final wishes. He began to orchestrate the funeral services for his father, and remained poised to ascend as emperor of the Xaryxian Empire. Just before his ascension, he was confronted by the same adventurers that accompanied Princess Xedalli from their doomed planet."
