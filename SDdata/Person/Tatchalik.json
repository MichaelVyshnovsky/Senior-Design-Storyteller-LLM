        "mainbody": "'''Tatchalik''' was a bounty hunter from [[Chult]], active before [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "[[Intulik of the Blood]] used his magics and political prowess to gain power sometime before 1372 DR, assassinating his political opposition. Eventually, he rose to power over non-[[Mezro]]an [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] tribes. However, the subjection was short-lived. Intulik's career was ended via the sword of a bounty hunter called Tatchalik. He claimed the ''[[Spirit of the Predator]]'', the [[enchanted]] [[helmet]] created by Intulik, as his payment and left Chult for [[Waterdeep]], proudly displaying the new magical trophy."
