Thomass daughter, Cate departed Baldurs Gate for Calimshan sometime in or prior to 1492 DR, where she encountered a curious snakeskin musical instrument called a slitherhorn. In her letter to Thomas, she promised to bring the instrument home and play it for him. Another friend, or possibly a family member, of Thomass named Eryk sent him a letter talking about a metal called pyrohydram Eryk had encountered on his adventures that was  allegedly capable of producing quality pipes. Eryk planned to return to the Gate with a bag of the ore for Thomas to be fashioned into flutes. During the same year, Thomas was known to experiment with various materials in order to produce quality strings for his instruments. However, using peahen gizzards was a gross failure, ratgut was proven to be hard to work with, and catgut was a failure, despite being better suited for string making than sheepsgut."
