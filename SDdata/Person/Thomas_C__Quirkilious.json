Quirkilious''', Maker of Musical Instruments, was the [[dragonborn]] proprietor of the [[Chromatic Scale]] music shop in the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|Oh... well, no matter. My instruments make the most splendid of gifts! I'm sure you'll find something for even the most contrary of bards.|Thomas C. Quirkilious}}",
        "Description": "Thomas was a tall male dragonborn with fiery eyes and crimson scale coloration. He had a curious and grand personality and wore expensive finery.",
        "History": "Thomas became the proprietor of Chromatic Scale some time before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Thomas's daughter, [[Cate Quirkilious|Cate]] departed Baldur's Gate for [[Calimshan]] sometime in or prior to 1492 DR, where she encountered a curious [[snakeskin]] musical instrument called a [[slitherhorn]]. In her letter to Thomas, she promised to bring the instrument home and play it for him. Another friend, or possibly a family member, of Thomas's named [[Eryk]] sent him a letter talking about a metal called [[pyrohydram]] Eryk had encountered on his adventures that was  allegedly capable of producing quality [[pipe]]s. Eryk planned to return to the Gate with a bag of the ore for Thomas to be fashioned into [[flute]]s. During the same year, Thomas was known to experiment with various materials in order to produce quality strings for his instruments. However, using [[peahen]] gizzards was a gross failure, [[rat]]gut was proven to be hard to work with, and [[cat]]gut was a failure, despite being better suited for string making than [[sheep]]sgut."
