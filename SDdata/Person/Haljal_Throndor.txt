Haljal Throndor was a dwarf blacksmith who ran the Cracked Anvil in Port Llast in the latter half of the 14th century DR.
He felt the most at home when surrounded by the stone walls of a proper mine, but following his injury his lungs could not handle the fumes from underground smelting.
Haljal was considered to be a skilled craftsman, adept at all forms of ironmongery.
Haljal was once a miner north of Mirabar until a terrible cave-in crushed the right side of his body, forcing him to retire. He wandered around for almost a century before establishing his blacksmith shop in Port Llast. While he was content with his life in the small town, once Haljal found a cleric who could heal his wounds, he planned to return to his former homeland.
