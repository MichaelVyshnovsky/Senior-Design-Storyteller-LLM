'''Haljal Throndor''' was a [[dwarf]] blacksmith who ran the [[Cracked Anvil]] in [[Port Llast]] in the latter half of the 14th century DR.

==Personality==
He felt the most at home when surrounded by the stone walls of a proper mine, but following his injury his lungs could not handle the fumes from underground smelting.

==Abilities==
Haljal was considered to be a skilled craftsman, adept at all forms of ironmongery.

==Background==
Haljal was once a miner north of [[Mirabar]] until a terrible cave-in crushed the right side of his body, forcing him to retire. He wandered around for almost a century before establishing his blacksmith shop in Port Llast. While he was content with his life in the small town, once Haljal found a [[cleric]] who could heal his wounds, he planned to return to his former homeland.
