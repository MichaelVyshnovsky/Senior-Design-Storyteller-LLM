        "mainbody": "Abinor Lashingwind was the patriarch of a family of storm giants who lived with them in the highest peak of the Gnollwatch Mountains in the midâ€“14th century DR.\nHe did all he could to keep his family secret from both the human and Crinti who lived in the lands surrounding the mountains in Dambrath. To this end, circa 1372 DR, he created the illusion of a moody silver dragon in the peaks to ward off any explorers or errant monsters."
