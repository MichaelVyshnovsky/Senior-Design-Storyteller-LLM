        "mainbody": "illian Cantilar was the half-elven ranger who dwelt on the top of the hill that later became the hamlet of Gillians Hill and was the towns namesake.\nGillian Cantilar was said to be a creature of great beauty.\nLong before 14 century DR, Gillian lived in a lone house atop the wooded mound at the northern edge of the area that eventually became known as Gillians Hill. The ranger was considered a hero and defender by merchants who traveled along the Trade Way. Gillian was one of the very few who set out to spy on local bandits, poachers, and make sure caravans remained unspoiled by the many dangers of the road.\nEventually, the area of the rangers razed home was taken by the elevated fire cairn, used to warn Daggerford of encroaching enemy armies of Dragonspear Castle and Serpent Hills. However, the makeshift tower was often used as a flophouse for various unsavory elements. In 1372 DR, a group known as the Gillians Hill Gang was occupying the spot while targeting passing traders and merchants."
