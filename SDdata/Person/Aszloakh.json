        "mainbody": "'''Aszloakh the Hooded''' was the [[finhead]] [[saurial]] who was in charge of [[The Fool's Altar]] dedicated to [[Finder Wyvernspur]], located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Aszloakh's moniker was given to him by inhabitants of the Gate because the saurial always wore a hooded weathercloak when outside on the city streets. He had a deep and rumbling voice and had many years of service to the [[Church of Finder Wyvernspur]] under his belt. Personality-wise, Aszloakh always remained patient and calm, even in the face of danger. The finhead saw [[human]]s from a friendly, humorous, yet cynical lens. He expected to be lied to and betrayed.",
        "Possessions": "The Hooded one carried an [[enchanted]] [[staff]], but its powers were unknown to most, even [[Elminster Aumar]]."
