'''Hargrid Tenslayer''' was the [[Tharchion]] of [[Laprendar]] in [[Thay]] around [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Not Thayan himself, Hargrid was originally from [[Thesk]] but after killing the child of a hierarch of [[Phsant]], he was driven out of the city. He went to Thay, which suited his nature better.

When Thay's attempt to invade [[Rashemen]] ended in catastrophe, Hargrid actually managed to distinguish himself and he was promoted to autharch of [[Falls]].

After Laprendar's last tharchion died in mysterious circumstances (that is, [[poison]]), Hargrid made his successor by unanimous agreement.

Around 1357 DR, he was heavily involved in the [[Salamander War]], having made alliance with [[Aznar Thrul]], Zulkir of Evocation, and [[Sabass]], Zulkir of Conjuration, the mages responsible for causing it.
