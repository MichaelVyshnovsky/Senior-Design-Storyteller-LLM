Hargrid Tenslayer was the Tharchion of Laprendar in Thay around 1357 DR.
Not Thayan himself, Hargrid was originally from Thesk but after killing the child of a hierarch of Phsant, he was driven out of the city. He went to Thay, which suited his nature better.
When Thays attempt to invade Rashemen ended in catastrophe, Hargrid actually managed to distinguish himself and he was promoted to autharch of Falls.
After Laprendars last tharchion died in mysterious circumstances (that is, poison), Hargrid made his successor by unanimous agreement.
Around 1357 DR, he was heavily involved in the Salamander War, having made alliance with Aznar Thrul, Zulkir of Evocation, and Sabass, Zulkir of Conjuration, the mages responsible for causing it.
