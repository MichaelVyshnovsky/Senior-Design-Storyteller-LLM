Ibn Engaruka was a Harper in Chult. 
Ibn resided in Port Castigliar, the most hidden "port" of Chult, owning and operating a depot. He had very little news from Faer√ªn but always helped any Harpers that arrived in the area. 
Ibn was amicable with fellow Harpers but stern and professional to all others.
