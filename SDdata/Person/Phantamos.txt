'''Phantamos''', who was also called '''Phantamos of the Purple Cloak''', was a [[wizard]] who inhabited the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]..

==History==
Though eventually renowned as a skilled spellcaster, Phantamos's earlier days of mastering his craft were not without their hiccups. When learning to fly in a small back alley in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] of Waterdeep, he crashed recklessly into a cart laden with crockery. The alley was later named [[Shattercrock Alley]] for this incident.
