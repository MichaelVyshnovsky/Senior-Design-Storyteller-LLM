        "mainbody": "Homen Odesseiron was a warmage and tharchion of Surthay in Thay in the late 14 century DR. His standard displayed an axe-and-boar.\nHomen wore wizards robes. He usually had a perpetually dour expression on his face.\nHis favorite weapons were his sword and lance.\nHomen was a very proud man and took responsibility for his actions as tharchion of Surthay.\nOnce Homen was a Red Wizard but he stepped down in order to become tharchion.\nAfter a failed attempt at conquering a Rashemi town, Homens army was rescued by Szass Tam and Homen thus sided with the lich lords cause of conquering Faer√ªn."
