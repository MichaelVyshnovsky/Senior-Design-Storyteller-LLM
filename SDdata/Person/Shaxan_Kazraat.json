        "History": "Shaxan was an ancient inhabitant of [[Netheril]] buried in a tomb in Anauroch. However, its tomb was occupied by the [[blue dragon]] [[sorcerer]] [[Iymrith]], who put Shaxan's remains away in a remote room, thus earning its rage. Shaxan waited only for someone to open its sarcophagi so it could have its vengeance."
