'''Neysea Snowwolf''' was a [[barbarian]] [[amazon]] from the reclusive [[Jarnsaxa]] tribe of [[Yal Tengri]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the age of 18, Neysea Snowwolf left her home in the Great Ice Sea to accumulate wealth through adventuring. A proud amazon of "the Iron-Crushers of the World," Neysea was a charming and charismatic young woman. She did not hold men in high regard, thinking them beneath her, and refused to travel alongside such weak creatures. She also showed little respect to women who did not take on a warrior's profession. Neysea worked towards her dream of owning a stable full of the strongest [[warhorse]]s in the Realms.

Sometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, Neysea Snowwolf was among [[adventurer]]s interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally mysterious magical ''orb'' from its depths.
