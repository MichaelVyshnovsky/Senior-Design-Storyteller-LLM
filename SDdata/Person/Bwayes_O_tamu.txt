'''Bwayes O'tamu''' was a [[weretiger]] who inhabited the wreck of the ''[[Narwhal (galleon)|Narwhal]]'' near the eastern shore of [[Chult]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Bwayes carried a close resemblance to his cousin, [[Wakanga O'tamu]].

==Personality==
Although he lived a life of relative solitude, Bwayes was not hostile. He was curious about passersby, and was open to trading [[gem]]s he had scavenged for [[wine]]. After becoming a weretiger, he stopped using his name altogether.

==Abilities==
As a weretiger, Bwayes could assume both [[human]] and weretiger form.

==Possessions==
Bwayes kept several scavenged items in a lockbox in his cabin, including a [[spyglass]], several gemstones, two ''[[potion of healing|potions of healing]]'',  a set of [[Three-Dragon Ante]] cards, as well as various explorer's tools.

==Activities==
Bwayes inhabited the former captain's cabin of the ''Narwhal'', which was relatively still elegant despite the wreck being upside down. He shared his domicile with a tribe of [[vegepygmy|vegepygmies]] who lived below the ship and inside its hold. Since he hunted and killed more than he could eat, Bwayes shared his spoils with the vegepygmies, and as a result they got along well.

He was happy to share information with friendly travelers, including the locations of [[Needle's Bones]] and [[Nangalore]].

==Relationships==
As a child, Bwayes was very close to his cousin Wakanga.
