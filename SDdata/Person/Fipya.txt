'''Fipya''' was a member of the ''[[bara]]e'', the seven "super-paladins" sworn to protect the holy city of [[Mezro]] in [[Chult]]. 

==Personality==
Fipya was a shy girl, and her responsibilities left her feeling overwhelmed.

==Abilities==
Like all ''barae'', Fipya had been granted special powers from [[Ubtao]], which included the following:
* She could utter magical [[command]]s that would compel the hearer to obedience.
* She [[regenerate]]d health rapidly.
* She could [[detect evil]] at will.
* She had improved reflexes and physical and mental resistances.

If within the [[Temple of Ubtao]], she could also cast the following spells:
* ''[[Cure critical wounds]]''
* ''[[Forbiddance]]''
* ''[[Remove blindness or deafness]]''
* ''[[Remove disease]]''
* ''[[Restoration]]''
* ''[[True seeing]]''

In addition, Fipya possessed the power to control plants within Mezro, and she could rejuvenate soil.
 
==Relationships==
Fipya followed the instructions of the other ''barae'', especially those of [[Kwalu]], whom she considered an older-brother figure.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Fipya was the newest ''bara'', After the [[Batiri]] attack on the city of Mezro that same year, in which they burned the Agricultural Quarter, Fipya used her new powers to restore the area.
