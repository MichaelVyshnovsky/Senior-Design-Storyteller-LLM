Fipya was a member of the barae, the seven "super-paladins" sworn to protect the holy city of Mezro in Chult. 
Fipya was a shy girl, and her responsibilities left her feeling overwhelmed.
Like all barae, Fipya had been granted special powers from Ubtao, which included the following
* She could utter magical commands that would compel the hearer to obedience.
* She regenerated health rapidly.
* She could detect evil at will.
* She had improved reflexes and physical and mental resistances.
If within the Temple of Ubtao, she could also cast the following spells
* Cure critical wounds
* Forbiddance
* Remove blindness or deafness
* Remove disease
* Restoration
* True seeing
In addition, Fipya possessed the power to control plants within Mezro, and she could rejuvenate soil.
Fipya followed the instructions of the other barae, especially those of Kwalu, whom she considered an older-brother figure.
In the late 14 century DR, Fipya was the newest bara, After the Batiri attack on the city of Mezro that same year, in which they burned the Agricultural Quarter, Fipya used her new powers to restore the area.
