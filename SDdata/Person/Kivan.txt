'''Kivan''' was an [[elven]] [[ranger]] from the [[Shilmista]] forest in the [[Lands of Intrigue]]. During the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] he set out on a mission of revenge against the [[Tazok|individual]] that ruined his life.
{{Quote|''"My need for revenge gives me strength to go on."''|Kivan.[[File:Kivan_-_Revenge.mp3]]}}

==Personality==
Kivan was a stoic man of few words. He was rather undiplomatic, cold in nature and extremely gruff with others. As such he did not readily become friendly with others.

He did not like being in cities or traveling underground like the "[[dwarven]] folk." As to be expected Kivan was not fond of [[drow]] or those that followed [[Lolth]].

==Relationships==
Despite his solitary nature Kivan was wholeheartedly in love with his wife [[Deheriana]].

==History==
A few years before the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Kivan and Deheriana took a romantic vacation away from their daily lives. The couple were waylaid and captured by a group of [[bandit]]s led by the [[half-ogre]] [[Tazok]]. The bandit leader tortured both of them for his own enjoyment. While Kivan was able to escape with his life, Deheriana was not so fortunate.

Kivan set out on mission of vengeance. In the months prior to the [[iron crisis]], Kivan began hunting bandits as a means to get closer to Tazok and the [[Blacktalons]].

Some time that year or next, he Kivan began working with several other adventurers tasked with escorting a future bride to the home of her groom in [[Amn]]. Among the others involved were the noble [[paladin]] [[Ajantis Ilvastarr|Ajantis]], the warrior [[Shar-Teel Dosan]], the Cyricist [[priest]] [[Tiax]], and [[Eldoth Kron]]. Unfortunately the group was almost immediately assaulted by a band of [[hobgoblin]]s. Kivan's fate after the battle was unknown.{{Cite comic/Baldur's Gate}}
