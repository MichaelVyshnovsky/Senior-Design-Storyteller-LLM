'''Dhalmass Rayburton''' was a member of House [[Rayburton]], and the only non-[[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]] member of the ''[[bara]]e'', the seven "super-paladins" sworn to protect the holy city of [[Mezro]] in [[Chult]]. 

{{quote|''The fact that people still read those dreadful books I wrote is proof enough to me that [[Cormyr]] is no more civilized now than when I left. Those things are filled with thoughtless condemnations of many civilized people - the [[Shou]], the [[Tuigan]]. It makes me sick to think about them.''|Dhalmass Rayburton, on the books he authored before [[172 DR]].}}

==History==
Dhalmass, a famed explorer from [[Cormyr]], traveled to Chult around [[172 DR]] and there finally found peace.
 
==Personality==
Dhalmass was a kindly individual but liked to scoff at the notion that the [[Heartlands]] were "civilized" compared to Chult.

==Abilities==
Like all ''barae'', Dhalmass had been granted special powers from [[Ubtao]], which included the following:
* He could utter magical [[command]]s that would compel those who heard them to obey him.
* He [[regenerate]]d health rapidly.
* He could [[detect evil]] at will.
* He had improved reflexes and physical and mental resistances.

If within the [[Temple of Ubtao]], he could also cast the following spells:
* ''[[Cure critical wounds]]''
* ''[[Forbiddance]]''
* ''[[Remove blindness or deafness]]''
* ''[[Remove disease]]''
* ''[[Restoration]]''
* ''[[True seeing]]''

In addition, Dhalmass possessed the power to understand all languages, whether written or spoken. He also had incredible abilities of persuasion, usually able to convert anyone to his way of thinking, especially if discussing matters relating directly to the well-being of Mezro.
