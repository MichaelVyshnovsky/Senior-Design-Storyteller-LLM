'''"Y'lara"''' was a [[yochlol]] trapped in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
A yochlol was sent by [[Lolth]] to help [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]] [[Gromph Baenre]] in a [[demon lord]] summoning ritual in late [[1486 DR]]. The yochlol knew the true plot behind the spell. However, after the summoning, Gromph also understood the true meaning of what he did, and he magically trapped the yochlol in his private sanctuary before it escaped the city. Posing as a drow priestess called "Y'lara", the yochlol tried to obtain someone's help in order to escape.
