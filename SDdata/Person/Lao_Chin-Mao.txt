'''Lao Chin-Mao''' was the most influential scholar in all [[Shou]] history.

==History==
Born in [[-719 DR|531 Shou Years (âˆ’719 DR)]], Lao spent all his life studying how to improve the behavior and morals of his fellow Shou. He wrote the ''[[Book of Heaven]]'', a guide to a moral life.

In his old age, Lao become Court Advisor to the [[Eleventh Emperor Chin]] of the [[Ho Dynasty]], using his influence to shape the growing bureaucracy in a new social class devoted to his principles. This led to the creation of the [[Mandarinate]], a upper class of scholars and gentlemen who were the intellectual elite of Shou Lung.

==Description==
Lao was known to always dress in old-fashioned robes and a conical hat.
