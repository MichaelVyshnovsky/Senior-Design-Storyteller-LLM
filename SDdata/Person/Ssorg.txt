Lord '''Ssorg''' was a [[half-elf]] member of the [[Council of Lords (Zhentil Keep)|Council of Lords]] in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] before that city's desttruction.

==Description==
Ssorg was short and appeared to be oily. His skin was darker than usual.

==Activities==
[[Gemstone]]s and [[coal]] were Ssorg's method of income, though he also dabbled with weapons and [[armor]]. He sold his wares through a store maintained in the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]], but also sold directly to other merchants and travelers. He supported the [[Zhentarim]]'s efforts, and those of Lord [[Manshoon]], when it suited his needs. He often sold goods to the Black Network at discounted prices to get back into their good graces for past mishaps.

Ssorg's estate was located in the central section of Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Inner Quarter|Inner Quarter]] on [[Gold Street]] and the [[Street of the Gods]].
