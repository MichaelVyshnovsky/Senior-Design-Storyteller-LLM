He granted control of the House to his sister Lestra Urmbrusk and also granted her the custody of his son, Rutherford Urmbrusk. Quarren then gathered an adventuring party and went into Undermountain.\nHowever, Lestra bribed Quarrens companions in order to make sure that he never came back from the dungeon.
