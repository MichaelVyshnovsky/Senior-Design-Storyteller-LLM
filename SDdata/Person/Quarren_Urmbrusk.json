        "History": "In 1476 DR, he abandoned his duty in order to go on adventure. He granted control of the House to his sister [[Lestra Urmbrusk]] and also granted her the custody of his son, [[Rutherford Urmbrusk]]. Quarren then gathered an adventuring party and went into [[Undermountain]].\n\nHowever, Lestra bribed Quarren's companions in order to make sure that he never came back from the dungeon. Nobody of that group ever returned. However, in [[1479 DR]], a voice like Quarren's started whispering Rutherford's ears.",
