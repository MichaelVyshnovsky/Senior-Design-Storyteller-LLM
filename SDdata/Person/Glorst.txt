}}'''Glorst''' was a former priest of [[Vhaeraun]].

==History==
Glorst was one of the former priests who joined the [[church of Eilistraee]] in [[Shilmista]].

In [[1377 DR]], he was arguing with a priestess of [[Eilistraee]] about which of their gods had absorbed the other in the duel in [[1375 DR]] when they were approached by [[Halisstra Melarn]]. Glorst tried to kill her but was defeated and killed by her.
