        "mainbody": "The Ogre King was a name given posthumously to an oni active in the Delimbiyr Vale in the early 15 century DR.\nDuring his lifetime, the Ogre King sought to learn about the mysteries of the Dire Wood, and he subjugated goblins to use as expendable pawns for his expeditions. Regardless, these goblins revered the Ogre King because they believed that he was leading them on glorious raids.\nAround the turn of the 15 century DR, the oni who would come to be known as the Ogre King discovered some ancient ruins of the dwarven realm of Ammarindar located beneath the Southwood. He proceeded to established a lair within the ruins and then subjugate all nearby goblins. For the next ten years, he sent his goblins on violent missions that took them far beyond the Southwoods borders. His reign was then cut short when he was killed by a group of adventurers who were passing through the region.\nIn the decades that followed, the Ogre Kings goblins and their descendants came to revere him as a god, having misunderstood that he was an oni and instead believing him to have been an ogre with a divine spark. The goblins ended up fashioning the Ogre Kings skull into a mace known as the skull totem and one of his horns into a dagger known as the horn totem.\nBy the mid-to-late 15 century DR, the goblins were led in their fervor for the Ogre King by their High Shaman, Sancossug, who claimed he could revive their dead god, who would then reveal his divinity, revive all those goblins who had died in his name, and then lead them on a glorious conquest. In fact, such magic was completely beyond Sancossugs abilities, although he truly believed he could do it.\nIn the , his plan was derailed when the wizard Curuvar of Loudwater infiltrated the Barrow, incapacitated the goblins, and stole the horn totem. which Curuvar had sold to Garwans Curiosities in the towns South Square. The goblins breached the towns southern wall with a barrel of alchemists fire and began attacking the townsfolk on their way to raiding Garwans Curiosities."
