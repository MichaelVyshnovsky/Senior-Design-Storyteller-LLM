'''Zog''' was a part of a roaming adventuring troupe that traveled the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{Quote|''Thought we'd get something steady here, but no coin is worth itâ€”not with the Absolute breathing down our necks.''|Zog.}}

==Description==
Zog was a tall and muscular [[half-orc]] with long reddish-brown hair and tan skin. His face was decorated with a nose ring and several earrings.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Zog was a member of an adventuring band that included the [[gnome]] [[Yonks]], the [[elf]] [[Sarafin]], and the [[tiefling]] [[Quinara]]. The group traveled the [[Sword Coast]] in search of steady adventuring work. They traveled from [[Waterdeep]] to [[Baldur's Gate]] during the [[Absolute crisis]] and, unable to find work, planned to move out to [[Neverwinter]] as the city was searching for adventures.
