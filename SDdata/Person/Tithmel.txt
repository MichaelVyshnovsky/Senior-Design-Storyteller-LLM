Tithmel was queen of Citadel Felbarr in the late 15 century DR.
Queen Tithmel was known for being an astute and judicious ruler. 
Tithmel shared equal authority over her people along with her husband Morinn. The monarchs were distant kin of King Emerus Warcrown.
The queen possessed a grand suit of armor, forged for her by the Royal Armorer, Ghelryn Foehammer of Triboar.
Some time after the War of the Silver Marches of 1485 DR, the monarchs received accounts of fire giant activity in the hills near Citadel Felbarr. Fearing the worst, they brought on a group of adventurers to investigate the subterranean forge of Ironslag.
