The '''Dodkong''' (meaning "'''Deathking'''" in [[Giant language|Giant]]) was the [[stone giant]] ruler of [[Cairnheim]], and also a powerful [[lich]].<ref name=GHotR-p56/>

==Relationships==
Dodkong was considered an enemy by the [[illithid]] outcast [[Qooql]] and his allies the [[Clan Ironhand]] [[dwarves]], who he has motivated into raising an army to one day drive the giants out of the region.

==History==
'''Grugaran''' was an old and frail stone giant when he recovered the artifact known as the ''[[Crown of Obadai]]'' from [[human]] tomb robbers. He and his young lover had a plan to turn themselves into liches using the ancient stone giant artifact, so that they could rule over a reborn [[Nedeheim]]. Unfortunately, when Grugaran first attempted to use it, the crown killed his young lover. Now a heartless lich, Grugaran declared himself Dodkong and set about his goal. He gathered the displaced stone giant clans of Nedeheim and with them, he refounded the kingdom, calling it Cairnheim.

The Dodkong ruled his kingdom through fear. He considered wherever he was feared to be part of his kingdom and as such commanded several [[hill giant]] clans and collected tribute from several human settlements in the region. In addition, should he choose to call upon them, he could also command several large tribes of [[orc]]s and [[hobgoblin]]s to fight for him.
