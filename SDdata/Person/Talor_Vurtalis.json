        "mainbody": "'''Talor Vurtalis''' was an [[aquatic elf]] high mage in [[Myth Nantar]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In [[1341 DR]], Talor was accepted as new student by the High Mages [[Taranath Reefglamor]] and [[Yrlimn Tidark]], together with [[Jhanra Merlistar]] and [[Keryth Adofaer]]. In [[1346 DR]], Taranath placed three ''[[selu'kiira]]'' upon their brows, sending the students into comas while the gems force-fed the knowledge of millennia into their brains.\n\nTalor and his fellows awakened only on [[Tarsakh 1]] of [[1369 DR]] in order to help in the [[Twelfth Serôs War]]. Talor and his fellow helped their masters in the war and in the great spell that sent [[Iakhovas]] to the [[Outer Planes]].\n\nAfter Yrlimn and Taranath died of exhaustion, Keryth and Jhanra replaced them as new High Mages and Talor was nominated High Mage.\n\nIn [[Ches]] of [[1370 DR]], Talor summoned a [[Whirlpool Gate]] in [[Myth Nantar]], seemingly not caring for the people around him, and disappeared. In [[Nightal]], some [[dukar]]s discovered him in the [[Cliff City of Atin]]. Talor had renamed himself '''Atin''' and had taken control of the beast of the city. He injured the dukars that discovered him.",
        "Activities": "Talor vainly wore his ''selu'kiira'' openly on his forehead in opposition to the tradition to hide it. In Myth Nantar, he paid no attention to his students and used his time to explore the city and the area around.",
        "Personality": "Talor was not confident in his abilities and responsibilities."
