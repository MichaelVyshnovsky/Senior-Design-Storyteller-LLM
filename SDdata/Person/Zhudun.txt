'''Zhudun''', also known as the '''Corpse Star''', was a star-like [[Elder Evil]] from the [[Far Realm]] who had taken a place among stars of [[Realmspace]]. Unlike normal stars, Zhudun didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.

== Description ==
Zhudun was described as a "corpse star with a blank face".{{Cite dragon/366/Wish Upon a Star|18, 21}}

==History==
Zhudun and the other Far Realm-infested stars of Realmspace were somehow related to the [[Eldest]].

Zhudun was a dead star that somehow still existed in Realmspace.

When the [[Feywild]] city of [[Cendriane]] fell, Zhudun was the brightest star in the sky.

Zhudun was usually sought out by some [[warlock]]s to make a pact with it. [[Neogi]] were specially adept to seek out pacts with it and the other Far Realm-infested stars. Zhudun bestowed those warlocks the ability to use the ''[[prophecy of Zhudun]]'' spell.

Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a vestige of Zhudun's power had found its way into the domain of [[Demiplane of Dread#Barovia|Barovia]] in the [[Shadowfell]], where it offered pacts with creatures who approached it. To those few Zhudun granted its magic, it bestowed the gift to raise the ancient dead, giving them the ability to use the ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]'' [[spell]], that always worked regardless of how long a creature had been dead. Even non-warlocks could be granted this ability from the star, though they could use Zhundun's powers just once. Those who were granted the gifts of Zhudun had their appearance changed, turning corpse-like and easily mistaken as [[undead]].
