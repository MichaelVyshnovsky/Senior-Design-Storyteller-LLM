        "mainbody": "Proskler () was a member of the Cult of the Howling Hatred in Mulmaster.\nIn 1491 DR, while posing as a strange adept of Talos, Proskler helped the relatives of Maude Kron to devise a plot against Cloak Nelvon deJun by kidnapping his younger brother, Larch deJun. They seized him at a great party in the Astrid Saj villa and took him to a nearby tower to enact a revenge rite. In truth, Proskler wanted to summon some hippogriffs from the Elemental Plane of Air, using the lives of all present at the rite. Eventually, an adventuring party hired by Nelvon foiled his plan and Proskler died."
