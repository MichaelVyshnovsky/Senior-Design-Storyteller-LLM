Dahlia traveled with [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. In disguise, Hadencourt approached Dahlia and soon the [[elves]] were ambushed by many war devils. However, the pair managed to slay all of the devils and Drizzt summoned his magical [[unicorn]] [[Andahar]], who impaled Hadencourt.\n\nBeing banished to his home plane, Hadencourt promised infinite torments to Drizzt at the end of his exile but Drizzt told him to get in line behind [[Errtu]].",
