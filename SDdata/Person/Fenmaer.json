        "mainbody": "'''Fenmaer''' was a disciple of [[Corellon|Corellon Larethian]] in [[Luskan]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Fenmaer was bald and wore heavy black armor.",
        "History": "Fenmaer and his companions met up in [[Athkatla]] sometime prior to [[1490 DR]], for what they had believed was to be a simple journey to [[Baldur's Gate]]. Over time, they traveled up the [[Sword Coast]], first through [[Waterdeep]] and then [[Neverwinter]], in order to reach their final destination of [[Icewind Dale]]. However, Fenmaer could not make the final leg of the trip, and was forced to remain in Luskan, where he awaited his companions' return. While in Luskan, Fenmaer encountered the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]] while staying in a small abode in the Luskan market district."
