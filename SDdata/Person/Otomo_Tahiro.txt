Otomo Tahiro was a shukenja in Maeshi Province in Kozakura in the 1350s DR.
In 1359 DR (1433 in the Kozakuran Calendar), Tahiro went to Ito-jo to destroy the evil inside but he was outmatched, captured, and tortured with magic by an evil wu jen in the caves deep the castle.
After three months, an adventuring party hired by Michimori Uemon to recover the Seven Swords came across him. His mind was virtually gone and he was near death. After blabbering about a terrible monster inside the caves (a krakentua), he finally died.
