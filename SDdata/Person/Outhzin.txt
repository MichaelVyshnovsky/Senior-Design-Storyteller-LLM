'''Outhzin''' was one of the [[Dekanter goblin|goblin]]s that followed Lord High Chief [[Ghistpok]] within the mines of [[Dekanter]]. He held a position of importance among his fellow tribespeople.

==Description==
Outhzin's appearance differed slightly that most other [[goblin]]s from Dekanter. His eyes were a bit more red and his fingers unusually longer than most.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Outhzin and his warriors led a group of [[human]]s and their former tribesman [[Sheemzher]] to Chief Ghistpok for an audience at their camp in the central chamber of Dekanter. After their meeting, Outhzin and the outsiders fought against a group of the [[Beast Lord]]'s [[mongrelfolk]], monstrosities that were formed from goblins from his very own tribe.
