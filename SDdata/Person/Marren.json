In a room of the node's complex under the monastery, thanks to the elemental forces, Marren's body was switched that of a cultist, [[Luros]]. Later, he met an adventuring party hired by Grandmaster [[Perrywinkle Shin]] to find the missing monks. The adventurers managed to put Marren back in his body."
