Slaul was a hobgoblin chieftain, active sometime before 1372 DR.
Slauls main achievement in life was creation of an enchanted club - the Big Board with Nail. The hobgoblin chieftain used his magic weapon to "herd goblins," especially the unruly ones under his command. Even though Slauls fate was unknown, the Big Board with Nail ended up in the hands of the gnomes of the small town of Treeroot.
