Hannah went inside to watch a performance, while Giran waited for her outside. As the act started, a gnome walked on stage and started attempting to perform magic as it failed and fizzled. Hannah thought it to be a part of the show and laughed along with the crowed. But then the circus tent fell victim to the mad gnomes illusionist magic. Bitter Kalah transformed the tents interior into a fanciful tower. The tents guests and performers became ensorcelled to appear as monsters. Hannah was trapped inside, transformed into a giant spider to her complete terror and despair. The child was left outside of the spellbound tent, crying for his missing mother. When the illusion was broken and the gnome defeated, Giran was reunited with Hannah."
