        "mainbody": "'''Thibbledorf Pwent''' was the [[dwarf]] leader of the [[Gutbusters]] of [[Mithral Hall]].",
        "Description": "Pwent was known for wearing vicious-looking spiked armor. He was also known for having never taken a bath. He had an odor so foul that even other dwarves avoided standing too close to him. In one instance, Catti-brie rubbed his head in a fond manner and ended up with a film of stinking filth on her hand.{{fact}}",
        "Personality": "Pwent was a dwarf of tremendous character; held in high regard by many of his kin.  In his initial arrival at [[Mithral Hall]], Pwent was a thorn in the side of King [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] and many others. The berserker was loud, abrasive, and smelly (because of his intense hatred for bathing). However, because of his deep love for King Bruenor and his steadfast loyalty to king and clan, Pwent earned his place as a member of [[Clan Battlehammer]] one battle at a time.{{fact}}\n\nThibbledorf was known for his eagerness for and love of battle. He once begged the werewolf [[Bidderdoo Harpell]] to bite him so that he could also become a [[werewolf]] presumably making him even fiercer in combat and hairier to boot. Bidderdoo wisely refused the request.",
        "History": {
            "Mithral Hall": "Pwent was present when the [[duergar]] and [[Shimmergloom]] first laid siege to Mithral Hall. He later escaped Mithral Hall, only to return to offer his fealty to [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] when Mithral Hall was retaken in [[1356 DR]].{{fact}} Soon after his return, Pwent bravely defended Mithral Hall from a drow raiding party, eventually becoming incapacitated by [[Vierna Do'Urden|Vierna]]'s snake-headed whip.{{fact}}\n\nPwent also  proved to be essential in defending Mithral Hall in [[1370 DR]] when he and his Gutbusters covered the dwarven retreat back into the safety of Mithral Hall. Pwent promptly rescued a severely wounded King Bruenor. Pwent was one the few dwarves selected by Bruenor when the king put together a small, elite group in order to march to the heart of the orc army and kill [[Obould Many-Arrows]] in hopes of freeing Mithral Hall from the press of the [[orc]] invasion.{{fact}}\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], Pwent ventured forth from Mithral Hall to the site of the last battle to return the bodies of his fallen comrades home in order to keep a promise made to the father of one of his recruits.\n\nIn [[1462 DR]], Pwent set out with Bruenor and [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] to find [[Gauntlgrym]]. However, he ended up staying in [[Icewind Dale]] due to his feeble knees from his battleraging. In the end, Pwent came to the aid of the group inside Gauntlgrym after the ghosts of Gauntlgrym summoned the dwarves of Clan Battlehammer for help. Pwent ultimately dragged Bruenor to the lever that sealed the [[Maegera|fire primordial]] in a cage of [[water elemental]]s. Pwent's throat was slit by [[Dor'crae]], the [[vampire]], and Drizzt believed him dead.",
            "Vampirism": "[[File:Pwent mag.png|thumb|250px|''Pwent rises after death.'']]\nIt was revealed that Pwent rose from his grave in Gauntlgrym. He was not dead, but nor was he alive. He had been turned into a [[vampire]] by Dor'crae. He hunted and fed off the blood of goblins and other monsters.  However, he feared what he would become. After a brief talk with Drizzt in [[1463 DR]], Pwent decided to wait for the sun to rise in order to commit suicide. However, he never went through with the act. When Bruenor returned to Gauntlgrym to retrieve his axe, Pwent was discovered to have escaped back into the caves after his talk with Drizzt. He was now the leader of an [[undead]] band of drow. Bruenor vowed to return to free his friend from the curse of vampirism.\n\nBy [[1484 DR]], Pwent had proclaimed himself the \"Steward of Gauntlgrym\" and controlled a number of drow vampire minions, periodically attacking the drow of [[Q'Xorlarrin]]. When Drizzt and the reborn [[Companions of the Hall]] returned to Gauntlgrym to free Pwent from his curse, Pwent at first attacked them but then aided them in finding and rescuing [[Artemis Entreri]] and his companions. Catti-brie eventually captured Pwent in [[Wulfgar]]'s magical horn, replacing the ten berserkers. They took the horn to [[Longsaddle]], where he was resurrected and cleansed; he died and was buried there in Longsaddle. However, his embodiment as a berserker remained inside the horn so that when blown, a corporeal image of Pwent would be summoned, crying out \"Me king!\"  For that reason, the horn remained in Bruenor's hands.\n\nThe vampire Pwent was not wholly destroyed and remained in his tomb in [[Gauntlgrym]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1488}}, during the battles against demons of [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]], he witnessed the presence of hundreds of drow travelling from [[Menzoberranzan]] to Gauntlgrym. At this time, Pwent was trying to resist the vampire curse but was very close to succumbing to the desire to drink blood and create a vampiric clan of dwarves. Driven by his loyalties to King Bruenor and while battling the vampire curse within him, Pwent led [[Yvonnel Baenre II|Yvonnel II]], [[Artemis Entreri]], and [[Dahlia Sin'felle|Dahlia]], to the incoming forces from [[House Baenre]].<ref>",
            "Cured of Vampirism": "When Yvonnel II and [[Quenthel Baenre]] created the powerfully enchanted web that broke the [[drider]]s' Curse of Abomination,<ref> Pwent also leapt into the magically enchanted webbing and was fully cured of his vampiric curse.<ref> He was left close to death by the violent intensity of the cure, but Artemis carried him back to Gauntlgrym and saved his life.<ref> The only lasting effect of his curse was that Pwent still had the fangs of a vampire.{{Cite digital book/Glacier's Edge|123|16}}",
            "Return to Service": "Pwent was brought along to intimidate [[Azzudonna]] so she would reveal the location of Catti-brie, who was missing. However, a truth spell enchanting the room revealed that Pwent would not harm Azzudonna as he spoke.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Glacier's Edge|126|16}} Pwent was denied the chance to join King Bruenor in his adventure to the furthest north with [[Jarlaxle]] to rescue their missing companions.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Glacier's Edge|187|23}}"

        "Possessions": "Thibbledorf's armor was ridged so as to catch the flesh of a close-held enemy and tear it when the dwarf grappled them. His helmet featured a spike that was half his height. It squeaked and squealed so much that he had no chance of stealth whatsoever. \n\nPwent, like the other Gutbusters, carried a flask of drink called Gutbuster, which helped to combat most known forms of poison and likely held an anesthetic effect as well.{{fact}}",
        "Relationships": "Pwent became one of Bruenor's most trusted friends, advisers, and combat allies.{{fact}}\n\nWhen not training in battle or drinking, a good amount of Pwent's time was spent trying to convince Bruenor's adopted daughter [[Catti-brie]] to grow a beard.{{fact}}"
