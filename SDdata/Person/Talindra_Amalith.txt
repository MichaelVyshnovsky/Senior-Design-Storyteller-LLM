Talindra Amalith was a wild elf and, as of 1374 DR, a member of the VelNikeryma, the guiding council of the Eldreth Veluuthra, who lived in the Methwood. She suffered due to the human adventurers in the area and led a cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra. She also recruited wild elves into the cell from the Chondalwood.
