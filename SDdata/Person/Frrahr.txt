'''Frrahr''' was a [[gnoll]] tavern owner inhabiting the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Frrahr owned [[the Burst Boil]], a tavern located in the eastern section of Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] just off of [[Zhent Avenue]]. He did not tolerate [[human]]s or [[demihuman]]s in the Boil. Frrahr made sure his bribes were up to date, so the [[Zhentilar]] left him alone.
