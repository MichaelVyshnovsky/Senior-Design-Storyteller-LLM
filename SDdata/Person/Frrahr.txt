Frrahr was a gnoll tavern owner inhabiting the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Frrahr owned the Burst Boil, a tavern located in the eastern section of Zhentil Keeps Foreign Quarter just off of Zhent Avenue. He did not tolerate humans or demihumans in the Boil. Frrahr made sure his bribes were up to date, so the Zhentilar left him alone.
