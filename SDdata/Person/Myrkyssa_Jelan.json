        "mainbody": "'''Myrkyssa Jelan''' was a warlord of [[the Vast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Not much was known about her except that she was extremely ambitious, had multiple identities, and threatened the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] twice.",
        "History": "Her first attempt in the {{yearlinkName|1370}}, using diverse forces such as [[orc]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[giant]]s, as well as mercenary companies, failed largely because of the calibre of citizens inhabiting Ravens Bluff. Her army went down in defeat at the [[Battle of Fire River]], and she disappeared, not appearing again until two years later.\n\nHer second attempt at the conquest of Ravens Bluff was decidedly more subtle than her first. Through unknown means, she had also recreated herself as a citizen of Ravens Bluff under the name Lady '''Amber Lynn Thoden'''. She was successful in duping the residents and officials, and even gaining the status of Lady Mayor of the city that same year.{{Cite polyhedron/147/Pillars of Ravens Bluff|16,23}}\n\nAround the same time, she created the personality of a beautiful, confident, and deadly swordswoman, '''Elana'''. It was in this guise in the {{yearlinkName|1372}} that she contracted the services of one [[Jack Ravenwild]] to retrieve a book called the ''[[Sarkonagael]]''.\n\nJelan's motives were revealed soon after through a series of events that ended up before the wild ''[[mythal]]'' underneath Ravens Bluff. Jelan's motives were finally revealed: her family used to be mighty sorcerers of [[Kara-Tur]], and their ability to wield magic was taken away by a [[divine curse]]. The wild ''mythal'' that the [[drow]] created held the key to ending the curse. If she could tame the ''mythal'' herself, the immense magical power it stored would be hers.\n\nIt was at this point that, despite earlier protests of good intentions, she revealed her plans to rule over Ravens Bluff as a dictator. Unfortunately for Jelan, she underestimated Jack Ravenwild, who took matters into his own hands and defied Jelan. They battled and Jack succeeded in defeating her, signalling an end to her nefarious plans for Ravens Bluff."
