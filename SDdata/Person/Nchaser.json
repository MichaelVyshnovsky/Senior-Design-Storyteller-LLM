        "mainbody": "Nchaser was a powerful mage who was famous for creating glowing globes and the spell Nchasers glowing orb.\nNchasers tutor in the Art was Nulathoe, from whom he learned the unique spell Nulathoes ninemen.\nNchaser was known for actively exploring the world, seeking out new magic and only twice settling down to act as an advisor for local rulers, the second time being for the High Captains of Luskan. During this stay in Luskan, he penned a spellbook known as Nchasers Eiyromancia, which he gifted to High Captain Taerl before departing the city.Nchasers personal spellbook is referred to as Nchasers Eiyromancia in all materials except the 2nd edition Encyclopedia Magica Volume IV (1995), where it is listed as Nchasers Elyromancia. The book was subsequently stolen, and would become the subject of a folk legend which claimed (not without some truth) that everyone who opened it was doomed to die.\nHe disappeared sometime before the \nThe explorer Darnell the Unfearing claimed to have come upon a tower on an island suspended above Abeir-Torils north pole by a 300-foot-tall (90 meters) stalagmite of perfectly smooth ice. When he climbed up it, he reported it being surrounded by hundreds of glowing globes, which promptly shot at him as he drew closer to the top. The magical beams fired at him disintegrated the otherwise indestructible ice of the island and Darnell reportedly slid back down the ice so fast that he broke both of his legs when he reached the bottom. However, some doubted Darnells story.\nApart from his glowing globes and possibly this tower, the only remaining legacy of Nchaser in the Realms were two spellbooks his Eiyromancia as well as a collaboration with the archmage Tulrun entitled Luminescence and Coloration. His Eiyromancia found its way into the possession of the likes of High Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon and Lord Nasher Alagondar of Neverwinter, where it killed one of Nashers courtiers. It was thus placed in Nashers library as of the , but was stolen during one of the riots known collectively as the Five Fires Rising."
