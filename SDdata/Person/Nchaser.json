            "Legacy": "The explorer [[Darnell the Unfearing]] claimed to have come upon a tower on an island suspended above [[Abeir-Toril]]'s north pole by a 300-foot-tall (90 meters) stalagmite of perfectly smooth ice. When he climbed up it, he reported it being surrounded by hundreds of glowing globes, which promptly shot at him as he drew closer to the top. The magical beams fired at him disintegrated the otherwise indestructible ice of the island and Darnell reportedly slid back down the ice so fast that he broke both of his legs when he reached the bottom. However, some doubted Darnell's story.\n\nApart from his glowing globes and possibly this tower, the only remaining legacy of Nchaser in the Realms were two [[spellbook]]s: his ''Eiyromancia'' as well as a collaboration with the [[archmage]] [[Tulrun]] entitled ''[[Luminescence and Coloration]]''.{{Cite dragon/82/Spells between the covers|58}} His ''Eiyromancia'' found its way into the possession of the likes of High Lady [[Alustriel]] of [[Silverymoon]] and Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]] of Neverwinter, where it killed one of Nasher's courtiers. It was thus placed in Nasher's library as of the {{YearlinkName|1350}}, but was stolen during one of the riots known collectively as the [[Five Fires Rising]]."
