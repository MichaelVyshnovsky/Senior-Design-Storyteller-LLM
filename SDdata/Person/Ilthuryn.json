        "History": "Ilthuryn attempted to court the infamously wealthy and haughty Lady Alauthshaee, but she scornfully rejected him. Enraged, Ilthuryn attacked her with his [[spell]]s as she rode in her flying carriage. It reportedly crashed to earth within [[Dead Tree Hollow]] in [[the Vast]]. Ilthuryn then using his magic to bury the carriage, the guards, and Alauthshaee herself alive. This took place a very long time before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], but still within [[elf|elven]] memory.\n\nAn apparent side-effect of Ilthuryn's reckless spellcasting was a [[dead-magic zone]] over the whole valley that was still there by [[1370 DR]]."
