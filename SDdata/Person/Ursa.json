        "History": "As of [[1368 DR]], a tribe of [[xvart]]s led by [[Nexlit]] considered Ursa their protectors. Were the xvarts ever attacked, they summoned the cave bear to their defense. However Ursa felt no particular kinship with the blue [[humanoid]]s and was likely to gore them as much as it was to gore invaders or adventurers seeking to stop xvart cattle raids."
