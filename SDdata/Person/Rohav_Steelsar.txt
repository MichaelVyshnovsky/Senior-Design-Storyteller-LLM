Prince '''Rohav Steelsar''' "the Exile" was an ill-fated child of the exiled [[Amn]]ian [[Parhek]] dynasty.

==Relationships==
Rohav was the second son of Princess [[Rasa Parhek]] [[Dornar Steelsar]], and was the sibling of [[Choris Steelsar|Choris]], [[Rosa Steelsar|Rosa]], and [[Rhothar Steelsar|Rhothar]].

==History==
Rohav was born in [[Silverymoon]], and was only 8 years old in the {{YearlinkName|1297}} when the family was found and attacked by Amnian assassins. Dornar and Choris fought to the death, Rosa was killed, and Rasa and Rhothar managed to escape, but Rohav was kidnapped and taken away. He was brainwashed by his captors and led to believe they had actually rescued him, and lived in [[Baldur's Gate]] while plotting to take the throne for himself. In [[1305 DR]] he betrayed his uncle Prince [[Malek Parhek (prince)|Malek the Coinmage]], leading to his death and the deaths of his three children. Rohav was poisoned to death by his vizier and controller [[Arlen Bormul]] in [[1306 DR]], putting an end to the last known heir of the Parhek dynasty.
