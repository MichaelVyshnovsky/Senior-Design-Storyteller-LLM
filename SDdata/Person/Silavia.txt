{{Quote|Don't get haughty with me, [[Jarvis]]! Take a look at that and do as I say.|Silavia, following the orders of the [[Maces of Elversult]].}}

==Description==
Silavia had a rather plump figure.

==Personality==
While she was kind and generous with her time, Silavia could be rather cheeky. She would readily help a friend while offering some sass while doing so.

==Abilities==
Silavia made delicious [[honeycake]], a treat was a favorite among the people of Moonstorm House.

==Relationships==
She had a relationship with [[John (Elversult)|John]], a farrier in the city.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1364}}, Silavia came to the aid of the sea captain [[Fowler]] and his new associate, [[Ruha]] of the [[Harpers]]. She accompanied the exhausted Ruha to the Pearl Tower at Moonstorm House, and baked goods for Fowler as he stayed up all night pressing [[Ylang|ylang blossoms]]. Unfortunately the gesture led Silavia's death, as both she and Fowler were slain by the traitor [[Tombor]] that very same night.
