Silavia was a cook at Moonstorm House in the city of Elversult, during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Silavia had a rather plump figure.
While she was kind and generous with her time, Silavia could be rather cheeky. She would readily help a friend while offering some sass while doing so.
Silavia made delicious honeycake, a treat was a favorite among the people of Moonstorm House.
She had a relationship with John, a farrier in the city.
In the , Silavia came to the aid of the sea captain Fowler and his new associate, Ruha of the Harpers. She accompanied the exhausted Ruha to the Pearl Tower at Moonstorm House, and baked goods for Fowler as he stayed up all night pressing ylang blossoms. Unfortunately the gesture led Silavias death, as both she and Fowler were slain by the traitor Tombor that very same night.
