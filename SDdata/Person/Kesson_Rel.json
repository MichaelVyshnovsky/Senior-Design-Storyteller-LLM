        "mainbody": "Human\nKesson Rel was a former Chosen of Mask. Given a sliver of divinity from his patron deity, he was driven insane, eventually driving him away from Mask and into the arms of Shar.\nIn the , he moved the Hall of Shadows from Elgrin Fau to the Plane of Shadow and bound the shadow dragon Furlinastis with a soul spell and tasked him with killing the demarchs of Mask. It was by these dead demarchs that he was separated from the spark of divinity. They bound it into Furlinastis and hid it from him, breaking the soul spell hed cast on the dragon in the process. Kesson spent millennia searching for his lost divinity and eventually grew so weak that he couldnt leave the Plane of Shadow for long, then only the portion of that plane known as the Adumbral Calyx, and finally his spire within that pocket.\nKnown there as Volumvax, he was known as a traitor to Mask who had received his quasi-divinity after millennia of loyally serving Shar.  The Sharrans themselves believed this to be true.\nEventually, Mask selected new Chosen, Erevis Cale and Drasek Riven, who sought to return the sliver of Masks divinity to their god, and they traveled to the Plane of Shadow. There, Kesson tricked them into freeing that portion of him residing in Furlinastis, and he was made whole again.\nWith the arrival of the Adumbral Calyx over Ordulin in Sembia, the Shadovar were forced to look for other answers regarding Volumvaxs divinity."
