Harlesk Knowin was the Silhouette of Assassins in the Caravan Sect of the Shadow Thieves around 1370 DR.
Harlesk was a master of disguise. He maintained more than a score of different identities, all without connection to crime or to his clerical path. He even spread rumors that some of his identities were enemies of others. Harlesks mastery of poisons ensured that nobody survived if they discovered the truth about him. It was even possible that he had also achieved status under one of his false identities in an entirely different part of the Shadow Thieves.
Harlesk usually wandered through the eastern cities, mostly under one of his many disguises.
