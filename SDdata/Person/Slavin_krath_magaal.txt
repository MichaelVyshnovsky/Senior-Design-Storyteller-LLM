Slavinkrathmagaal, also known as Slavin, was a young brown dragon living in Unther.
Slavin was a young brown dragon, part of a dragon generation that had dealings with Tiamat, who agreed to collaborate with the  Tiamatian cleric Malise in exchange for rituals to boost her power these rituals gave her the fiendish archetype. 
Later in life, her offspring Braeden had a vision of something monstrous emerging from the Pit of Many Colors, which was dismissed by Malise. Feeling that he had lost touch with the will of Tiamat, Slavin and Braeden began plotting together to overthrow him.
