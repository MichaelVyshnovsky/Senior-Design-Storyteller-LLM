Ataman al-Hajar was a noble dao who lived deep within an intricate cave system on the island of Al-Zira in the Djinnis Claws in 1367 DR.
Ataman was short for a noble dao, but still possessed a truly massive frame.
Like most noble dao, Ataman al-Hajar was an irritable genie who found it difficult to be polite to those who were beneath him.
He directed a force of xorn and earth elementals beneath the mountains of Al-Zira, collecting gems, precious ore, and other treasures.
