'''Gaerond''' of the Scars was an adventurer leading the [[Bloodshields Band]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He had sword scars, making him fearsome.

==Personality==
While professional, he was not above greed.

==Abilities==
He was very quick.

==Possessions==
He carried a [[longsword]] with peace-strings, and at least two longsarks.

==Activities==
He was a veteran adventurer.

==Relationships==
The [[Bloodshields Band]] numbered six, including him, [[Rornagar Breakblade]], [[Flamdar]], [[Malkym]] and [[Lylar]].

==History==
Gaerond led the Bloodshields Band into [[Shadowdale]] in {{yearlink|1479}}, on commission from a rich [[Sembia]]n who had paid a large amount upfront, looking for [[Elminster Aumar]], the ancient archmage. Gaerond came first upon the [[Old Skull Inn]], where he was able to commission the youngster [[Thal]], actually a [[doppelganger]], to lead him to Elminster. Thal took them to a cave, where Gaerond met a doppelganger pretending to be Elminster; when they revealed they actually intended to decapitate Elminster and carry his head as a trophy to Sembia, a number of hidden doppelgangers fired a volley of [[crossbow]]s into the band, slaying them almost on the spot. Gaerond was the last to die, though not by a great difference.
