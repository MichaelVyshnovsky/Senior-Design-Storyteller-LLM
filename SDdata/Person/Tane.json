        "mainbody": "Tane was a tumbler and performer that traveled across the Realms with a traveling troupe in the late 15 century DR.\nAlong with their siblings, Tane was an odd individual. When the group was together and approached by a stranger they only responded in terse grunts and vague nods, unless the interrupting person was especially entertaining.\nTane was one of three triplets, along with Tawn and Tine.\nOne of the three tumblers owned a bag of magic dust that could be thrown hard to the ground to conjure a great cloud. This was regularly used in the act that they performed together.\nSome time during the 1480s DR, Tane and their traveling companions stopped at the city of Phlan on the Moonsea North to perform their act for a while. At some point, they stopped at Madame Freonas Tea Kettle."
