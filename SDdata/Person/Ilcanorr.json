        "Description": "He was raven-haired with a handsome appearance and a chin-spike beard.",
        "Personality": "Ilcanorr was jaded in his ways.\n\nHe was known to have a large collection of perfumed and dyed cats.",
        "History": "Ilcanorr began his career in Luthcheq, and focused on his research and perfecting items known as ''[[sevencirclingwands]]'', but attacks by rivals and fearful neighbors drove him to move to Bedorn to live a more peaceful life and concentrate on his work.\n\nThe last pirate landing in the town of [[Oparl]] before the mid-1370s [[DR]] was successfully and violently repulsed by Ilcanorr. He sent a flight of [[gargoyle]]s out to turn them away.<ref>{{Cite web/The Border Kingdoms| url = http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/frbk/20060510a| title = Bedorn| date = 2006-05-10| accessdate = 2015-05-05}}\n\nHe authored the ''[[Hollow Codex]]'', a work consisting of at least twenty-five volumes.\n\nIlcanorr of Luthcheq magically bred a species of gently [[ooze]]s called [[starry sphere]]s sometime before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The very first starry sphere was designed to clean up after Ilcanorr's dyed [[cat]] menagerie while remaining harmless to beasts and [[humans]]."
