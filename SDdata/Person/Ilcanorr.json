        "mainbody": "Ilcanorr of Luthcheq was a male Turami human and a powerful wizard of Luthcheq who came to reside in the Border Kingdoms realm of Bedorn.\nHe was raven-haired with a handsome appearance and a chin-spike beard.\nIlcanorr was jaded in his ways.\nHe was known to have a large collection of perfumed and dyed cats.\nIlcanorr began his career in Luthcheq, and focused on his research and perfecting items known as sevencirclingwands, but attacks by rivals and fearful neighbors drove him to move to Bedorn to live a more peaceful life and concentrate on his work.\nThe last pirate landing in the town of Oparl before the mid-1370s DR was successfully and violently repulsed by Ilcanorr. He sent a flight of gargoyles out to turn them away.\nHe authored the Hollow Codex, a work consisting of at least twenty-five volumes.\nIlcanorr of Luthcheq magically bred a species of gently oozes called starry spheres sometime before the 15 century DR. The very first starry sphere was designed to clean up after Ilcanorrs dyed cat menagerie while remaining harmless to beasts and humans."
