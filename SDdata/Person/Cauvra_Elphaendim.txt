'''Cauvra Elphaendim''' was a member of the noble merchant [[House Elphaendim]] of [[Arrabar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
In [[1362 DR]], Cauvra Elphaendim was a couple of years younger than [[Emriana Matrell]], sixteen at the time.

==Personality==
Cauvra was a favorite scion of House Elphaendim, taken under the family's patriarch's – great uncle [[Thalammose Elphaendim]]'s wing. The old man saw potential in the young woman as a fellow [[wizard]] and took to secretly training her from an early age. Thalammose was afraid his great niece's talents could be misused or abused if she were to develop her skills in the arcane without guidance. Cauvra showed little interest in grand balls and events of the Arrabarran nobility; however, she was polite and friendly. Cauvra did her best to perform according to society's expectations.

==History==
On [[Tarsakh 13]] of the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, Cauvra Elphaendim attended Emriana Matrell's grand sixteenth birthday celebration. The young girls knew each other from an early age and often spent time together playing and gossiping before Cauvra's wizardly training was initiated. Along with Cauvra, the event was tended by Thalammose and [[Brastynbold Elphaendim]]. Cauvra was present at the party and, along with other guests, witnessed an assassination attempt at the matriarch of [[House Matrell]] – [[Hetta Matrell]].
