'''Terradissia''' was a [[half-elf]] [[wizard]] and [[Harper]] who followed the High Harper [[Jaheira]] to the [[Shadow-cursed lands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''I'd rather be up here than drowning in the dark.''|Harper Terradissia}}

==Description==
Terradissia had bronze skin and reddish wavy hair. As a wizard, she wore blue [[robe]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Jaheira was alerted to the mysterious return of [[Ketheric Thorm]], now a leader of a [[Cult of the Absolute|cultist army]] that worshiped [[the Absolute]]. Harper Terradissia was one of the agents who accompanied Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed lands surrounding the [[Moonrise Towers]]â€”General Thorm's seat of power.

When a group of [[True Soul]]s arrived at the [[Last Light Inn]], which the Harpers had claimed as a temporary base, Terradissia was among those present for the events that followed. It was unknown if Harper Terradissia survived the war with the Absolute; she might've perished after the Last Light Inn was consumed by the darkness or else she survived with the rest, storming the Moonrise Towers to end General Thorm's reign.
