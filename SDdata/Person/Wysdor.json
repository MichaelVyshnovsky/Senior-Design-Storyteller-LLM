        "mainbody": "ysdor was the gnomish captain of the dreadnaught Unquenchable.\nWysdors brother was named Horvath and served as navigator aboard his ship.\nDecades before 1361 DR, a group of Tinker gnomes set out from Krynn to explore the reaches of wildspace. In another crystal sphere, they had encountered neogi and were so distraught from the encounter that they returned to their own sphere and planet. Their vessel crash landed on Krynn, leaving only a small number of survivors. These survivors included Wysdor and his brother Horvath. These gnomes oversaw the design and construction of a second spelljammer to replace the one that they had lost. This ship was the Unquenchable.\nIn 1361, Wysdor took on three gnomish admirals and a young human named Teldin Moore. The plan was to sail through wildspace to a planet called Devin, but before setting off from orbit around Krynn, Wysdor ordered his brother to lead a small team to examine the exterior of the sidewheeler for damage from an earlier battle. Teldin accompanied the four gnomes on this short excursion.\nHowever, the sidewheeler was separated from its longboat when pirates unexpectedly attacked, and the fate of Wysdor and his dreadnaught are unknown."
