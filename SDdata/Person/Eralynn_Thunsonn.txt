'''Eralynn Thunsonn''' was a [[dwarf]] [[adventurer]] and member of the [[Order of Delvers]]. She was a good friend and sometimes delving companion of [[Torrin Ironstar]].{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|?}} 

==History==
Eralynn did not have an easy life. As a youth, her parents were killed by a [[red dragon]] when they became separated from a caravan traveling through a cavern system near the [[East Rift]].{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|1199}} After she joined the Delvers, she and her delving partner had some sort of accident in which her partner died. Fairly or not, other Delvers blamed Eralynn for her partner's death and considered her unlucky.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|359}} At some point, she acquired [[Spellscar|spellscarred]] hands with which she was able to work some [[magic]]. Torrin was the only person who was willing to adventure with her, although much of the time she preferred solo delves.<ref>{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|?}} 

In the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Eralynn handled tainted [[gold]] and became infected with the [[Stoneplague]]. She traveled to [[Sundasz]], believing that the non-dwarven [[cleric]]s in that city could cure her. Unfortunately, the clerics of [[Corellon Larethian]] could not cure her and she eventually succumbed to the disease.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|3061}}
