'''Okssort''' was a [[fire giant]] who, together with his wife [[Ildmane]], led an attack on [[Triboar]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], under the orders of [[Zalto|Duke Zalto]], Okssort and Ildmane went in search of pieces of the ''[[Vonindod]]''. They led a giant contingent to Triboar, the place of an ancient great battle between [[giant]]s and [[dragon]]s. However, they were defeated by some adventurers.
