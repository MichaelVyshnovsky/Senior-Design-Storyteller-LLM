Ophala Cheldarstorn was the covert owner of the Moonstone Mask as well as a respected member of the Many-Starred Cloak. 
Ophala once had a brief yet dangerous career as an adventurer of other planes, but she has since retired.
She regarded the Harpers, along with Elminster of Shadowdale as allies. She counted the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan among her list of foes. Ophalas apprentices spent most of their time spying on the Brotherhood through magical means so its agents could be stopped.
During Sammasters Rage, Ophala took Zundaerazylym -"The Laughing Wyrm" - to the Astral plane in a successful attempt to free her from the madness that was infecting Faer√ªns dragons. At the time Zundarazylym was a laundress and seamstress at the Moonstone Mask.
