Melyrk Rubyripper was the eccentric shopkeeper of Mad Melyrks in Thentia in 1367 DR.
Melyrk had keen eyes and spoke rapidly with a nasally voice.
He was somewhat manic and mischievous, and greatly enjoyed haggling and scoring bargains.
Melyrk treated haggling and bargain-hunting as a mix of art and game. Despite his odd behaviour, Melyrk was exceptionally good at appraising the value of the goods that passed through his shop.
