'''Katheera Urdo''' was an assassin of the [[Night Masks]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Katheera was the scion of the noble [[House Urdo]] of [[Westgate]] and joined the Night Masks only to indulge in her depraved interests. Her fellow assassins knew her only as "the Succubus", because her preferred method of killing was to kiss her target with poisoned lips.
