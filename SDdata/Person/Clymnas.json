        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the leader of the dreaded [[spider katanga]], the [[Mother of a Thousand Young]], captured several of the brave heroes of the Living Jungles as she prepared to birth an army of ravenous spider katanga. One of the heroes who returned to the tribe and brought the dire news â€“ [[Nathani]], secretly allied with the Mother of a Thousand Young and was the cause of Clymnas's capture. Subsequently, several groups of heroes were sent to assassinate the Mother and rescue Clymnas and their fellow prisoners."
