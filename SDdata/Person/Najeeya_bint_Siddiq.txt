Najeeya bint Siddiq was a skilled flame mage, and the first wife of Jamal al-Yindannim for 20 years, who inhabited Krak al-Niraan in 1367 DR.
Najeeya was an exotic beauty.
Though she spent much of her time in drug-induced stupors thanks to her addiction to dreambliss, Najeeya was a dangerous flame mage when active. She helped educate new recruits of the Brotherhood of the True Flame who were accepted into the keep.
Najeeya wore a sash of fire resistance. She also carried a potion of fire breath and several scrolls of the sunfire and fire track spells.
