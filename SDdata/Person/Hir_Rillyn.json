        "mainbody": "Lord Hir Rillyn was a member of the noble patriar Rillyn family of Baldurs Gate, member of the Parliament of Peers, the Chair of The Committee of Concerned Patriars, and the father of Derque Rillyn in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the , Derque Rillyn unsuccessfully requested extra coin for his allowance after Hostel Mother Pammella Nortale, the proprietress of Nortales Hostel pleaded for additional donations on top of the young noblemans annual contributions. Hir denied the request as Derque had already overstepped the allowance, and the coin from the youths incoming dowry was not there yet. Derques cousin Clerebold had an idea how to get Hir to donate. He suggested that Nortales Hostel, a non-profit hostel used to help refugees during the Absolute crisis, to be renamed to â€“ Hir Rillyns Hostel, in order to convince daddy to donate a \"good old chunk of change\" and possibly even a bit of extra coin for Derque himself.\nDuring the same period of time, the Cult of Bane identified Hir Rillyn as one of the eight top vulnerable Parliamentarians who would easily fall in line with the Absolute with some encouragement from bribery, blackmail, or direct threats."
