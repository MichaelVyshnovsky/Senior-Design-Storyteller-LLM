        "mainbody": "Lord '''Hir Rillyn''' was a member of the noble [[patriar]] [[Rillyn]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]], member of the [[Parliament of Peers]], the Chair of The Committee of Concerned Patriars, and the father of [[Derque Rillyn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Derque Rillyn unsuccessfully requested extra [[coin]] for his allowance after Hostel Mother [[Pammella Nortale]], the proprietress of [[Nortale's Hostel]] pleaded for additional donations on top of the young nobleman's annual contributions. Hir denied the request as Derque had already overstepped the allowance, and the coin from the youth's incoming dowry was not there yet. Derque's cousin [[Clerebold]] had an idea how to get Hir to donate. He suggested that Nortale's Hostel, a non-profit hostel used to help refugees during the [[Absolute crisis]], to be renamed to â€“ Hir Rillyn's Hostel, in order to convince daddy to donate a \"good old chunk of change\" and possibly even a bit of extra coin for Derque himself.\n\nDuring the same period of time, the [[Cult of Bane]] identified Hir Rillyn as one of the eight top vulnerable Parliamentarians who would easily fall in line with the Absolute with some encouragement from bribery, blackmail, or direct threats."
