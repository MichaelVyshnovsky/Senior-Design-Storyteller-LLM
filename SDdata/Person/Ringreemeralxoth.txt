==Personality==
Ring was was not overly aggressive and tended to stay close to his lair. He was dissatisfied with his Snakewood location and was cautiously building his strength before attempting to challenge another dragon for territory.

==Activities==
Ring rarely left the forest, but was known to occasionally hunt the surrounding countryside.

==History==
Ring once ambushed a cadre of highwaymen and acquired a large amount of treasure for his hoard, only to lose it and nearly his life to a pack of 30 [[troll]]s.
