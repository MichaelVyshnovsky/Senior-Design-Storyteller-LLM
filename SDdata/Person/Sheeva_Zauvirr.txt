Sheeva Zauvirr was the matron mother of House Zauvirr until the early 11 century DR.
Sheeva ruled House Zauvirr in Ched Nasad. In 1018 DR, however, she outraged Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre and she sent a Bregan Daerthe team, composed of Jarlaxle, Arathis Hune, and Zaknafein, to kill her, in collaboration with House Nasadra and Ssipriina Zauvirr. After a devious political plot, Sheeva was ousted from her position and exiled from Ched Nasad.
With a few followers, she went into the Underdark. However, Jarlaxle, Arathis Hune, and Zaknafein still needed her head and lured Sheevas group into a trap. During the fighting, only three males survived and Jarlaxle, with a creative use of his portable hole, managed to kill Sheeva despite her many magical protections.
Ssipriina Zauvirr was her youngest daughter. One son and a daughter of Sheeva followed her after she was exiled from Ched Nasad.
Sheeva believed herself better than Matron Baenre and even Lolth. She fall in love with her image in the mirror, a condition called by drow affliction of mirrors.
