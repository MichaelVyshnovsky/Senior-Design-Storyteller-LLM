Yostur Ulhmond was a fighter from the villages of the Snow People of Thar in the 1350s DR.
In the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR, Yostur was a member of a band of adventurers that rediscovered the fabled Barrochs Hold in the Glacier of the White Worm. However, they soon ran into a number of strange creatures, and were separated or killed. Yostur, together with Feenoch the Five-Fingered, made it to Orm to tell their story, though they would not be drawn on the matter of treasure. By the end of the year, it was said in Hillsfar they were trying to muster a larger group of adventurers, bearing sledges, perhaps intending to return.
At the time, Yostur was young, with blond hair and described as strong as an ox.
