'''Astergullph Daeryn''' was a [[sage]] in the town of [[Dhedluk (town)|Dhedluk]] in [[Cormyr]]. He was the author of the [[book]] ''[[Aster's Journal]]''. In one passage of the book concerning the humble origins of many [[adventurer]]s, he wrote that wielding a [[sword]] in small, apparently peaceful surroundings was no less heroic than attacking mighty cities or summoning powerful [[magic]] against a [[dragon]].<ref name=HHE-p2>
