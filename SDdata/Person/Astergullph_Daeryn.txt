Astergullph Daeryn was a sage in the town of Dhedluk in Cormyr. He was the author of the book Asters Journal. In one passage of the book concerning the humble origins of many adventurers, he wrote that wielding a sword in small, apparently peaceful surroundings was no less heroic than attacking mighty cities or summoning powerful magic against a dragon.
