        "mainbody": "Issayk was the most infamous forger in Skullport.\nIssayk could forge the most perfect false documents in the Realms. Thanks to his web of contacts across Faer√ªn, he was always informed of coming changes in the bureaucracy of a particular kingdom. Issayk also obtained wax pressings of seals of the governments of Calimport, Luskan, Waterdeep, Cormyr, and Sembia. Obviously, his prices were very high but the true mystery was what happened to all the money Issayk earned, as nobody ever saw him with more than petty cash."
