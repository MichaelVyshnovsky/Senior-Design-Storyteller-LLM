        "mainbody": "Skalnaedyr was an elder blue dragon and the ruler of the city in Murgh么m that bore his name. He was one of the Princes of Murgh么m, and also considered to be the strongest wyrm who lived in Murgh么m as of 1479 DR.\nIn 1409 DR, a plague swept through the dragon population of the Copper Mountains, causing many dragons to flee. Skalnaedyr flew to Murgh么m and stopped to rest near a small village known as Phannaskull. The frightened villagers pledged fealty to the surprised dragon, who agreed to rule the village. Due to Skalnaedyrs enlightened (for a dragon) rule, the village grew into a city during the 15th century DR.\nHe also rescued the dragonborn Ananta from an unknown but certainly grisly fate, and made her Guardian of Dracowyr. Skalnaedyr really cared for her to the point of putting himself in harm way in order to protect her if she was in danger.\nIn 1479 DR, he acceded to play the xorvintaal proposed by the vampiric smoke drake Brimstone."
