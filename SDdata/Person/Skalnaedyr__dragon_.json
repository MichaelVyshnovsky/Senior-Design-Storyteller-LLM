        "mainbody": "'''Skalnaedyr''' was an elder [[blue dragon]] and the ruler of the city in [[Murghôm]] that bore his name. He was one of the [[Princes of Murghôm]], and also considered to be the strongest wyrm who lived in Murghôm as of [[1479 DR]].",
        "History": "In [[1409 DR]], a plague swept through the [[dragon]] population of the [[Copper Mountains]], causing many dragons to flee. Skalnaedyr flew to Murghôm and stopped to rest near a small village known as [[Phannaskull]]. The frightened villagers pledged fealty to the surprised dragon, who agreed to rule the village. Due to Skalnaedyr's enlightened (for a dragon) rule, the village grew into a city during the 15th century DR.\n\nHe also rescued the [[dragonborn]] [[Ananta]] from an unknown but certainly grisly fate, and made her Guardian of [[Dracowyr]]. Skalnaedyr really cared for her to the point of putting himself in harm way in order to protect her if she was in danger.\n\nIn 1479 DR, he acceded to play the ''[[xorvintaal]]'' proposed by the [[vampiric dragon|vampiric]] [[smoke drake]] [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]."
