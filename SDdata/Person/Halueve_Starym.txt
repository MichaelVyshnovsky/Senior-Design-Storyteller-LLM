'''Halueve Starym''' was a member of the [[Starym]] family, and a [[devil]]-summoning [[mage]] who died challenging [[Elminster Aumar]].

==Personality==
He was arrogant and overbearing, with an enthusiasm for the sadistic.

==Abilities==
He had at least one spell of slaying that broke shields, even that of Elminster; another of his spells could be readied to subsume flesh, blood, and mind at the same time. He also knew a spell that was very risky to use even in the best circumstances, but which drew blood from Elminster. Finally, he had some amount of ability to bind devils.

==Possessions==
During his encounter with Elminster, he had three braziers, one of which held a hidden devil.

==Activities==
He appeared to have made it a habit of summoning devils.

==Relationships==
He disliked Elminster Aumar.

==History==
In [[Hammer 4]] of {{yearlink|904}}, Halueve Starym challenged a black-clad Elminster Aumar while inside an unnamed keep. He attempted to use a spell that drained flesh, blood and mind all together. Elminster's blood was barely drawn by his spell, and [[silver]] fire surged forth instead; when one of the bolts struck the brazier containing a devil, it caused the keep to come crumbling down.
