Halueve Starym was a member of the Starym family, and a devil-summoning mage who died challenging Elminster Aumar.
He was arrogant and overbearing, with an enthusiasm for the sadistic.
He had at least one spell of slaying that broke shields, even that of Elminster another of his spells could be readied to subsume flesh, blood, and mind at the same time. He also knew a spell that was very risky to use even in the best circumstances, but which drew blood from Elminster. Finally, he had some amount of ability to bind devils.
During his encounter with Elminster, he had three braziers, one of which held a hidden devil.
He appeared to have made it a habit of summoning devils.
He disliked Elminster Aumar.
In Hammer 4 of , Halueve Starym challenged a black-clad Elminster Aumar while inside an unnamed keep. He attempted to use a spell that drained flesh, blood and mind all together. Elminsters blood was barely drawn by his spell, and silver fire surged forth instead when one of the bolts struck the brazier containing a devil, it caused the keep to come crumbling down.
