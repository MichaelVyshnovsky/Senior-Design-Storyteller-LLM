        "mainbody": "'''Grizzelda Copperwraught''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[architect]] and leader of the town council of [[Leilon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The locals referred to her as '''the Growler''', although never to her face.",
        "Personality": "Grizzelda was gruff and confrontational, and would shame and berate those she disliked or whom she saw as uncooperative with her authority.",
        "Activities": "When Leilon was resettled in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Grizzelda was in charge of spearheading the reconstruction efforts, meaning that she directed the laborers and craftspeople as well as paid them each tenday. Because the reconstruction was the most important of the council's roles at this time, she was nominally the leader of the council and thus the most powerful person in town.",
        "Relationships": "Like most of the town council at the time, Grizzelda had been sent to Leilon by [[Dagult Neverember]], Lord Protector of [[Neverwinter]], and was on his payroll.\n\nGrizzelda was not well liked by the people of Leilon. In general, she had to maintain some diplomatic overtures to other members of the town council, notably [[Merrygold Brightshine]] and [[Valdi Estapaar]], as they could overrule her decisions.",
        "History": "At some point in the late 15{{th}} century DR, after having torn down and neutralized the [[High Tower of Thalivar]] in the center of Leilon, [[Dagult Neverember]] had become interested in rebuilding the town as part of the trade route along the [[High Road]] south to [[Waterdeep]]. He handpicked Grizzelda to oversee this task.\n\nWhen the town came under attack from the [[Cult of Talos]] and the townsfolk and laborers were driven out, Grizzelda attempted to take charge of the situation, but her abrasive personality made it difficult to coordinate any response. Grizzelda herself resigned to simply wait for reinforcements from Neverwinter until a band of [[adventurer]]s reclaimed the town. Under Grizzelda continued leadership of the council, this same group of adventurers would be called upon to perform several services to help Leilon grow and to protect it from rising threats from both followers of [[Talos]] and followers of [[Myrkul]], culminating in the [[Battle of Leilon]].\n\nOnce Leilon's reconstruction was essentially complete, much of the townsfolk expressed interest in having the surly dwarf replaced as head of the council, although few dared to say so to her face."
