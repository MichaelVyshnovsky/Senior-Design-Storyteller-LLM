'''Jessa Dribble-Obould''' was an [[orc]] [[priestess]] of the [[Kingdom of Many-Arrows]] in [[the North]] in the early 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was a companion of [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] and [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] during the search for [[Gauntlgrym]], the lost kingdom of [[dwarves]].

==History==
Jessa was one of the ambassadors of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows to [[Mithral Hall]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1409}}, she helped [[Nanfoodle Buswilligan]] [[poison]] Bruenor, but this was only so that he could fake his own death in order to secretly abdicate the throne of Mithral Hall and make [[Banak Brawnanvil]] the eleventh king.

[[Thibbledorf Pwent]], distraught over the apparent death of Bruenor, later sought out Nanfoodle and Jessa for answers in the hills outside of Mithral Hall. Upon finding the traitorous pair, he attacked them to get answers. During the fight, however, Drizzt and a very-much-alive Bruenor arrived to stop him.

After that, Jessa, Drizzt, Bruenor, Pwent, and Nanfoodle, set out to find Gauntlgrym and they traveled together for many years.
