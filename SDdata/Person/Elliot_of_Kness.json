        "History": "[[File:Underdark Gangsters.png|thumb|280px|''Sir Elliot observing criminal lowlifes at the [[Think Easy]].'']]\nElliot was a marshall of [[Juris]], and investigated various misdeeds alongside Thurgood. During one investigation they came across [[drow]] trading with surfacer criminals, and in the ensuing fight the majority of miscreants were captured, though Thurgood was killed. Sir Elliot devoted his life to tracking down and destroying the organizations that made up the drow \"white market\", eventually finding evidence of wide-reaching Underdark criminal organizations. Realizing the magnitude of his foes, he joined forces with Jayed Garhoov'r and the Forthright Band of Investigators, a band of justice-minded paladins aided by the scholar [[Gerald of Riveyra]].\n\nA later target of his vengeance was [[House Catanzaro]], a powerful drow noble house that influenced and financed a number of other Underdark criminal organizations. His targets included the Catanzaro matron [[Felyndiira Shi'narrvha]], the fence [[Gnormahlenvaey Catoneriehn]], the entrepreneur [[Brikhalna Ipprszhen]], and the assassins [[Vikhrumn Coll]] and [[Gray'shivnarien Taliain]]."
