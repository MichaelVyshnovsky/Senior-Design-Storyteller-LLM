'''Terse Torvalt''' was a member of [[the Guild]] from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Terse was a [[halfling]] man with dark brown skin, green eyes, and curly brown hair. He wore an [[archer]]'s [[Leather armor|leathers]] [[dye]]d in the Guild's green colors, hid his face behind a Guild-green bandana, and carried a [[bow]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Terse Torvalt was tasked with standing guard at the secret entrance into Baldur's Gate's [[Undercellar]], where the Guild's Guildhall was hidden. Whilst a [[half-orc]]ish enforcer [[Tusgront]] manned the main entrance, Terse was ready to dispatch any unwanted guest from a nearby rooftop.
