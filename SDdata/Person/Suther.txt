'''Suther''' was a house guard for the noble [[Seasilver]] family of [[Marsember]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was not particularly well-spoken, and became disquieted when confronted by his superiors.

==Relationships==
He served under the house guard [[Mannus]], and their superior, Sergeant [[Carlton]].

==History==
When the city of [[Marsember]] was invaded by the [[Shadovar]], on [[Uktar 2]] of the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, Suther and Mannus failed to heed the warning of the servant [[Odelia]], allowing two [[shade]]s to infiltrate the bedchambers of Lady [[Arietta Seasilver]]. They were ordered to not allow the young noblewoman to leave the family's estate, but failed in their efforts.
