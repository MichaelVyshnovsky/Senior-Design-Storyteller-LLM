Horustep II was the seventh pharaoh of Mulhorand.
Horustep II was born in 888 DR. He ascended to the throne of pharaoh of Mulhorand in 922 DR, after the former pharaoh Mahorustep I had died in battle against the Red Wizards of Thay during a half-hearted attempt to prevent the nation from seceding from the Second Mulhorand Empire. Horustep II would die later that year during the same ongoing conflict.
