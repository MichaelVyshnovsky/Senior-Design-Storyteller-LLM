        "mainbody": "Cabrath Nelinderra () was a female drow keening spirit and a cleric of Kiaransalee. She was considered Irae Tsarrans top lieutenant in life.\nIn life, Cabrath was a dusky grey-skinned drow woman with amber eyes and gray-white hair. She tended to wear a heavy black robe with rich purple colors inside the sleeves.\nAfter her death and transformation into a keening spirit, Cabrath was shrouded in a bone-white shimmer and appeared as an insubstantial and slightly transparent version of herself, with her robes trailing off into smoky nothingness.\nA fearless devotee of Kiaransalee, Cabrath was well aware she would be transformed in the event of her death. She kept few physical objects, taking no pleasure in such luxuries.\nCabrath was an adept leader and was considered capable enough to serve as Irae Tsarrans second-in-command of the cult of Kiaransalee in Maerimydra.\nAs a powerful cleric of Kiaransalee, Cabrath had a vast array of divine spells under command however, she had an especially keen talent for necromancy spells. She often made sure to have herself and her weapons empowered with spells like bulls strength and magic weapon, which made her a formidable melee combatant.\nAfter Cabraths transformation into a keening spirit, she still retained her potent spellcasting abilities but could release a deadly and terrifying wail akin to that of a banshee, as well as being capable of phasing through stone and flesh unhindered. Her touch, just like that of many other undead, inflicted a terrible chill, which could be exerted with maximum effect by phasing through her victim. She was impervious to most physical attacks.\nIn addition to the voluminous black and purples robes he wore, Cabrath carried a bone-handled spectral dagger that had a glowing blue insubstantial blade. Beneath her robes, she wore a set of half-plate armor +4 which was further warded with a light fortification enchantment. Furthermore, she kept a fire elemental gem and a ring of protection +2 on her person.\nThe lover of the vampire monk and assassin Maas, Cabrath was often found in his company after the fall of Maerimydra in . They shared a suite in Castle Maerimydra, where Maas occasionally enjoyed watching her eat.\nCabrath was considered by Irae Tsarran to be one of her most trusted lieutenants.\nIn 1372 DR, Cabrath was the second-in-command of the cult of Kiaransalee in Maerimydra. She worked with Irae Tsarran to overthrow House Ch√ªmavh after the invasion of Kurgoth Hellspawn during Lolths Silence. Once the Kiaransaleean cult had established control of Castle Maermimydra, Cabrath became responsible for the newly converted lesser Temple of Kiaransalee at the top level of the castle, which served as a companion to the Undying Temple.\nBy the , Cabrath had taken up residence in the Acropolis of Thanatos in Velddrinnsshar, where she was the head priestess of the Crones. While she tried opening a gate to the Negative Energy plane in order to bring forth an army of undead, she was killed again by the Darksong Knight Cavatina Xarann, right after she grievously injured Halisstra Melarn by phasing through her.\nShortly after her destruction, she was bound to rejuvenate with time, but the massive amount of voidstone and the negative energy it exerted accelerated the process. However, since she was a keening spirit by Kiaransalees will, when Qarlynd Melarn and his apprentices exerted Elven high magic to erase Kiaransalees name from her worshipers, the goddess disappeared, and so did Cabrath."
