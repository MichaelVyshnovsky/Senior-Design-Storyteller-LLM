}}'''Harth Trithketh''' was the owner of [[Harth Trithketh's House of Welcome]], a luxurious inn located in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].

==Description==
Harth had shiny black eyes, and an unusually sharp (for a gnome), pointed nose. When he laughed or grinned, he looked truly wicked.

==Personality==
He was inquisitive as well as acquisitive, frequently lurking about the inn and spying on his guests. He had a merry outlook on life and relaxed in the company of the escorts he employed to service his guests, usually four or five at a time.
