'''Zan-akar Zeraez''' was a [[stormsoul genasi]] who served as the ambassador of [[Akan没l]] in the late 1470s [[DR]].

==Description==
Zan-akar had long and slender silver spikes projecting from his scalp, and his skin color was like the duskiest [[grape]]s. The pattern of argent lines etched into his face was so intricate that it looked like it was a mask.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], Zan-akar was the Akan没lan ambassador in [[Chessenta]]. when a group of [[abishai]] disguised as dragonborn began to kill Chessentan citizens and allied themselves with enemies of Chessenta, Zan-akar was able to convince Shala Karanok to banish the Tymantheran [[Ophinshtalajiir Perra|ambassador]] from the country.
