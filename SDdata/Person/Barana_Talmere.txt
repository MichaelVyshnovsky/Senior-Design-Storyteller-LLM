Barana Talmere was a cleric of Amaunator from the town of Eveningstar in Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
Barana was a stout and muscular dwarven woman with plain brown hair, clean-shaven face, and light skin. She wore a set of chainmail adorn with Amaunators holy symbol.
In the late 15 century DR, Barana Talmere asked a band of adventurers from the world of Eberron, who were transported to Toril by a rift, to lend a hand defending the town of Eveningstar during the Darkening. Barana notofied the adventurers of an unnamed drow necromancer from House Szind using the Deep Glen Graveyard in Kings Forest to bolster the drow armies in the war against Eveningstar.
