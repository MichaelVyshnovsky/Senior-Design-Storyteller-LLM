Naleen was an orphan tiefling monk of the Broken Ones from the Monastery of the Yellow Rose in Damara.
Naleen had straight, long, pitch-black hair and ghostly-pale skin, the legacy of her demonic mother. Like other monks, Naleen did not wear armor, with her fists being the weapon. She did carry a dagger and was proficient with a sling.
Naleen was born to an Amnian nobleman and a member of the Church of Helm Don DiArmos and a mysterious woman he met during an expedition to Damara. After Naleen was born, her mother dropped her disguise, revealing her true demonic nature to Don DiArmos. The mother was destroyed by the cleric, and Naleen was abandoned with monks of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose. Sometime before the , the secret of her existence was revealed to Sirge de La Sunya, the son of Don DiArmos. After the noblemans death, Sirge, now a paladin of Helm, set out to find his long-lost sister. Eventually, he assembled an adventuring fellowship â€“ The Winter Rose and found Naleen at the faraway monastery. Unsure how to proceed, Sirge introduced himself as The Watcher and invited the young monk to join the adventuring group, the offer Naleen gladly accepted yearning to explore the world outside the Monastery of the Yellow Roses walls.
