'''Vaeros''' was one of the consorts of Queen [[Morwel]] of the [[Celestial eladrin|eladrin]]. He lived with her in the [[Court of Stars]], a demiplane attached to [[Arborea]] and the [[Gates of the Moon]].

==Description==
Vaeros was a [[tulani]] [[fighter]] and [[priest]] of exceptional talent. He was known for his sly personality.

==Activities==
Vaeros advised Morwel and assisted her in diplomatic matters. He was on good terms with the [[Seldarine]] and often sought them for advice. He oversaw the defense of the Court of Stars and led rescue raids into the [[Abyss]] to free captured eladrin prisoners from the [[demon]]s.

==Relationships==
The love between Vaeros and Morwel was renowned among the eladrin. In fact, a fairy tale existed that said that, should their love fail, all eladrin would lose their magical powers.

==History==
Sometime before [[1373 DR]], Vaeros fell during a raid into the Abyss to liberate prisoners. His responsibilities were taken over by another famed tulani, [[Faerinaal]].
