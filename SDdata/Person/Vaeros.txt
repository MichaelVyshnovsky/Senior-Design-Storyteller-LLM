Vaeros was one of the consorts of Queen Morwel of the eladrin. He lived with her in the Court of Stars, a demiplane attached to Arborea and the Gates of the Moon.
Vaeros was a tulani fighter and priest of exceptional talent. He was known for his sly personality.
Vaeros advised Morwel and assisted her in diplomatic matters. He was on good terms with the Seldarine and often sought them for advice. He oversaw the defense of the Court of Stars and led rescue raids into the Abyss to free captured eladrin prisoners from the demons.
The love between Vaeros and Morwel was renowned among the eladrin. In fact, a fairy tale existed that said that, should their love fail, all eladrin would lose their magical powers.
Sometime before 1373 DR, Vaeros fell during a raid into the Abyss to liberate prisoners. His responsibilities were taken over by another famed tulani, Faerinaal.
