The '''Black Alaric''' was a pirate, or more accurately, a number of different individuals each taking the name and appearance of the pirate. Over the years Black Alarics unified pirate forces during 7 major wars on the [[Sword Coast]]. This led some to believe that the pirate was one immortal individual. 

==Description==
Each Black Alaric adopted the same distinctive look, a black bandana and cowl covering the hair and face. The ships flew the same azure and black banner throughout the year. 

==Possessions==
* [[Amulet of Ioma]]

==History==
===The First Black Aleric===
[[-88 DR]] The chief of Clan Fyrson, [[Alaric the Pious]], accused a young nobleman also named Alaric of piracy, theft, fraud, and the worship of dark gods, namely [[Bane]] and [[Myrkul]]. Alaric the Pious barred the young Alaric from the line of succession. 

[[-86 DR]] The younger Alaric now called ‘Alaric False-Oaths’ was linked to a large enclave of pirates operating out of ruins in [[Velen]]. These ruins were caused by the great storms of [[-133 DR]].

[[-54 DR]] The Black Alaric led a group of pirates on a raid of the Karlag shipyards on the southern shores of Tethyr. Making off with 5 ships, the Black Alaric led his crew to the Nelanther Isles to the west of the Dragon’s Neck Peninsula. 

[[-44 DR]] King [[Nishan Ithal II]] of Tethyr launched an assault against the pirates who had been disrupting sea trade for years. Tethyr lost his best captain and capital ship in the battle, but the Tethyrian Navy was able to sink the Talon, the Black Alaric’s flagship. The Black Alaric was believed to have been killed in the fighting.

===The Second Black Aleric===
[[-9 DR]] [[Volsun Fyrson]] led a clan rebellion against his brother, the current clan chief, [[Tavis Fyrson II]]. He joined up with pirate forces and took up took the name Black Alaric, as his father’s brother had before him.

[[-6 DR]] During the now aged King Nishan II’s birthday celebration, the Black Alaric led the pirates of the Nelanther alongside aid from Clan Fyrson, in an attack on [[Ithalyr]]. Many members of royalty along with several nobles were killed, and substantial damage was done to the castle. The Prince, [[Tarsax Ithal]] and the Black Alaric killed each other in what was described as an epic saber duel. Losses were heavy on both sides, but the pirates lost nearly two-thirds of their fleet and nearly 500 men.

===Iakhovas===
A [[wereshark]] named [[Iakhovas]] adopted the name for a time, he was killed Ches 30 in [[1369 DR]] during an attack on [[Waterdeep]].
<ref group="note">In the [[Lands of Intrigue (boxed set)|Lands of Intrigue: Book Three: Erlkazar & Folk of Intrigue]] in the description of the Black Alaric it states "The last appearance of Black Alaric was over a century ago, but tavern tales now whisper that Black Alaric has returned." [[The Threat from the Sea]] series that describes the events of Iakhovas was written after after Lands of Intrigue. The Black Alaric is mentioned specifically at being the fall of Murann less than a year later so it's possible that there were two Black Alarics at the time, or that this was just an oversight.

===At the fall of Murann===
[[1370 DR]] [[Cyrvisnea]] enlisted the aid of a new Black Alaric, to provide a naval blockade during the siege of [[Murann]]. She has promised him half of the ships captured in the attack, provided that he and his crew provide five years of service to the planned empire.

==Rumors & Legends==
Legends say that only a true Black Alaric will lead the pirates to conquering the southern mainland. Some say it is why [[Akbet-Khrul]] and his crew of 3000 pirates failed.
