'''Kurtsson''' was a [[Vaasan]] [[wizard]] who lived in [[Innarlith]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a henchman of the [[Red Wizards|Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rymüt]].

==Description==
Kurtsson was fair-skinned with blond hair.

==Personality==
He was intelligent and stoic. He found the weather around the Lake of Steam to be warm by his standards even on days when it was cold and rainy.<ref>

==Abilities==
He was proficient with an [[axe]]. Among the [[spell]]s he could cast were ''[[silence]]'' and ''[[animate dead]]'', as well as various [[illusion]]s, and he could create magical ''[[portal]]s'', including those large enough to move ships.<ref>

==Relationships==
He became a henchman of Marek Rymüt sometime in the early 1360s DR. The latter sought to monopolize and control all trade of [[magical item]]s or services within Innarlith and Kurtsson agreed to join with Rymüt for this purpose.

==History==
He was present in Innarlith at least as early as [[1362 DR]] where he served Senator [[Meykhati]] as a mage. The latter had great interest in exotic things and thus had an interest in Meykhati as a mage from such a faraway place.<ref>

By [[1364 DR]], he had become a henchman of Marek Rymüt. Marek used him to kill one of his rivals in Innarlith on [[Alturiak 4]] in that year. Marek went to the home of his rival [[Thadat]] and Thadat refused Marek's wish for him to join Marek's monopoly on magical items and services. Thadat kept sharp watch on Marek's hands to make sure that he wouldn't cast any spells in his presence. Marek obliged, but while the two were sitting there, a spell of silence fell over all of them and Kurtsson teleported into the room from behind Thadat and murdered him with an axe. He then disguised himself with an illusion to make himself look like a [[Chondathan]] thug and walked out after Marek had left.

When Ransar [[Salatis]] replaced [[Ivar Devorast]] with Marek's ally [[Willem Korvan]] as the head of the project to construct a canal between the Lake of Steam and the [[Nagaflow]], Kurtsson assisted Marek in supplying magic for the project, including the raising of dead workers as undead servants to serve as laborers.<ref>

Salatis's successor, Ransar [[Pristoleph]], later placed Devorast back in charge of the canal. However, when Devorast and Pristoleph were away, Kurtsson and Senator [[Aikiko]] came to the site and installed a magic portal on the canal. Pristoleph wanted to arrest Kurtsson after he did this.<ref>

Kurtsson was later captured by Pristoleph at the conclusion of the civil war fought between Pristoleph's faction and Senator [[Meykhati]]'s faction over control of Innarlith. He was sent with Marek Rymut and Senator [[Asheru]] to Thay to face punishment.<ref>
