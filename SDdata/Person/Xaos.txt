'''The Xaos''' was a [[chaos beast]] lurking at [[Telkoun's Tower]] in [[High Thorog]] in the [[Silver Marches]]. It was twice the normal size of a chaos beast.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], the Xaos had recently been released from the ''[[stasis sphere]]'' by the evil [[sorcerer]] [[Telkoun Adranther]] in his tower. Telkoun cast the spell ''[[charm monster]]'' on the beast, gaining control of the creature and ordered it to drive intruders away from his tower.
