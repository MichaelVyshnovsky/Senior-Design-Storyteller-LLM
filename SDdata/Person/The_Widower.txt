}}'''The Widower''' was a [[drow]] [[wizard]] who led a group belonging to [[Clan Auzkovyn]].{{Cite web/Obsul Ssussun, "The Door to Light"}}

==History==
Nothing, including his name, was actually known about the Widower. It was suspected that he lived in a [[Lolth]]ite-ruled city as a consort to a matron mother, whom he strangled in her sleep. He had been inspired to the murder by [[Vhaeraun]] and committed it to leave his city and live among free drow, with whom he had a chance for a position of authority.

He escaped with the help of his new patron and managed to hide his name through spells given to him by the Masked Lord; since then, he called himself the Widower.

In [[1370 DR]], he became the leader of one of the groups belonging to Clan Auzkovyn on the surface. The Widower successfully protected the group from enemies for two years, during which he had a good relationship of mutual support with [[Jezz the Lame]] from [[House Jaelre]].

During this time, he wrote at least two [[spellbook]]s in cooperation with a [[cleric]] of Vhaeraun, making both divine and arcane versions of both books. Among them was the ''[[Obsul Ssussun]]''.

In [[1372 DR]], he left his group, giving the ''Obsul Ssussun'' to his apprentice [[Zulifein T'orgh]] while his position was inherited by the group's [[ranger]], [[Divolg Luen]].
