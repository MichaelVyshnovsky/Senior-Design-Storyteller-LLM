}}'''Inayah bint In'am''' was an [[elven]] [[sha'ir]] and resident of note in [[Hawa]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Through magic Inayah was able to disguise herself to appear as a bent old woman.

==Personality==
Inayah was secretive, hiding her true powers so no one in Hawa knew her importance to the city. She believed that the [[mamluk]]s of [[Qudra]] had gained too much power and decided to secretly offer her services to Hawa to help balance things out.

==Abilities==
An accomplished sha'ir, Inayah had considerable power but was not one to flaunt it. 

==Possessions==
Inayah owned several shacks along the docks and would use these to enter while disguised and emerge elsewhere as someone else. She also owned a house near the [[Free Market]] where she kept many magical items.

==Activities==
Inayah was the sha'ir responsible for binding the [[marid]] [[Najit'aqalat]] in service as harbormaster. She renegotiated Najit's terms of service every 101 days. She spent most of her day in the Free Market selling [[herbs]] and [[spices]].

==Relationships==
Beyond their professional relationship, Inayah rewarded Najit with special treasure she thought he would enjoy. If Inayah was attacked or threatened in any way, Najit would probably come to her aid. She also had a water [[gen]] named Sas as a companion.
