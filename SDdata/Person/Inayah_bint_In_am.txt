Inayah bint Inam was an elven shair and resident of note in Hawa in 1367 DR.
Through magic Inayah was able to disguise herself to appear as a bent old woman.
Inayah was secretive, hiding her true powers so no one in Hawa knew her importance to the city. She believed that the mamluks of Qudra had gained too much power and decided to secretly offer her services to Hawa to help balance things out.
An accomplished shair, Inayah had considerable power but was not one to flaunt it. 
Inayah owned several shacks along the docks and would use these to enter while disguised and emerge elsewhere as someone else. She also owned a house near the Free Market where she kept many magical items.
Inayah was the shair responsible for binding the marid Najitaqalat in service as harbormaster. She renegotiated Najits terms of service every 101 days. She spent most of her day in the Free Market selling herbs and spices.
Beyond their professional relationship, Inayah rewarded Najit with special treasure she thought he would enjoy. If Inayah was attacked or threatened in any way, Najit would probably come to her aid. She also had a water gen named Sas as a companion.
