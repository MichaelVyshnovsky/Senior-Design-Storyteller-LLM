Palas was a bandit who operated out of the Docks District of Neverwinter in the late years of the 15 century DR.
Palas was the leader of a gang of halfling thieves.
In 1479 DR, the shards of Selûne fell into Neverwinter and one of the Shards fell near the Blacklake. Palas bested other factions interested in the gem and stole it, killing anyone foolish enough to face him.
When Lady Jasmine hired a group of adventurers to retrieve the Shards, the adventurers tracked down Palas and killed him and his gang before retrieving the Shard.
