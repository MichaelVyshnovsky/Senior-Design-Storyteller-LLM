'''Palas''' was a bandit who operated out of the [[Docks District (Neverwinter)|Docks District]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Palas was the leader of a gang of [[halfling]] thieves.{{Cite dungeon/193/Shards of Selûne|28}}

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], the ''[[shards of Selûne]]'' fell into Neverwinter and one of the Shards fell near the [[Blacklake]]. Palas bested other factions interested in the [[gem]] and stole it, killing anyone foolish enough to face him.

When Lady [[Jasmine (priest)|Jasmine]] hired a group of [[adventurer]]s to retrieve the Shards, the adventurers tracked down Palas and killed him and his gang before retrieving the Shard.
