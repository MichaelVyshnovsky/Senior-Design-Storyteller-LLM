}}'''Therfus Handydoer''' was a [[wizard]] in [[Luskan]] and the second of [[Ship Rethnor]] in the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1463 DR]], he led an ambush against [[Drizzt]] and [[Dahlia Sin'felle|Dahlia]] just after they entered the city. He hoped to avenge Supreme Captain [[Borlann]] of [[Ship Rethnor]], who'd been killed by Dahlia. However, in the end, the ambush failed because of the intervention of men of [[Ship Kurth]]. [[Beniago Kurth]] threatened to kill Therfus from behind, forcing the wizard to retreat.

==Relationship==
Therfus served under four different Supreme Captains, but really only liked Borlann.
