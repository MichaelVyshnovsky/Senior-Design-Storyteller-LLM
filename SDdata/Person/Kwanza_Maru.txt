Kwanza Maru was a priest from Katashaka and, with his wife Nkonzi, joint leader of the Anaconda mercenary company and warrior society in the mid–14 century DR.
Together with his wife Nkonzi, he commanded their operations in the Heartlands of Faerûn in the early 1360s DR.
He was the priest of a snake god who was the patron deity of the Anaconda. Kwanza brewed a potion that granted the warriors infravision so they could see in darkness during night-time ambushes.
