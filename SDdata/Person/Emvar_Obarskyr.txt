Crown Prince '''Emvar Obarskyr''' was the older brother of King [[Foril Obarskyr I]] but was killed before he could ascend the throne of [[Cormyr]].

==Relations==
His parents were King [[Azoun V]] and Queen [[Nalara Marliir|Nalara]]. Emvar had two bastard children, [[Halance Crownsilver|Halance]] and [[Erzoured Obarskyr|Erzoured]],{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|53}}

==History==
Relatively little is noted of Crown Prince Emvar's life. His was apparently a life of responsibility, having been groomed for rulership. He did enjoy at least two romantic affairs, however, one with a woman named [[Laendra Shatterhawk]], whose son was adopted by [[Crownsilver|House Crownsilver]], and another with a merchant's daughter from [[Dhedluk]] named [[Solatha Boldtree]], who was made a Countess and invited to live in the Royal Palace in [[Suzail]].

Emvar was assassinated in the {{YearlinkName|1437}} by [[Sembia]]ns south of the [[Vast Swamp]] scant months before the birth of his second son, leaving his brother Foril as the new heir to the throne of Cormyr.
