        "mainbody": "'''Dumar Sturmarik''' was a ruler of the [[Realm of Tides]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).\n\nSeen as a greedy tyrant, Dumar focused on imposing tariffs on all seaborne merchants. Deciding to put an end to Dumar's reign, the leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] took advantage of the focus on tariffs and infiltrated the Realm of Tides, before attacking in a [[bloodforge]] battle."
