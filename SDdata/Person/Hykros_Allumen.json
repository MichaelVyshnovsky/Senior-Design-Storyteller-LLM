        "Personality": "Hykros was a devoted follower of Tyr and a bastion of law in Waterdeep. He was also a student of the early forms of the [[church of Tyr]], believing that over time Tyr's original message had been diluted. Hykros particularly rejected the notion that Tyr was the latest incarnation of [[Anachtyr]], a common belief in [[south Faer√ªn]]. He was so against this notion that he was prejudiced again non-Northern followers of Tyr. Hykros also believed in a rigid separation between the Tyrran cleric, monk, and paladin paths."
