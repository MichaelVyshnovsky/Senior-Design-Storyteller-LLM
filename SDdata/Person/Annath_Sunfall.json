        "Appearance": "Annath Sunfall, after becoming a [[grell]], resembled a worker grell.",
        "Personality": "He was described as a \"vigorous dreamer\" prior to his time as Magister. During his life as a grell, he was an embittered wanderer, who was pained by the regret of his time as the Magister.",
        "Abilities": "As a grell, Annath Sunfall had gained the ability to twist the magic of any [[enchanted]] object he touched, converting them into cursed versions of themselves. The effect also healed him completely; he was otherwise immune to all magic. He was also completely immune to all mind-affecting magic, all detection magic, and seemed to have a personal resistance to [[psionics]]. Like most grell, his tentacles paralyzed his prey; unlike other grell, he spoke [[human]] languages. Finally, he seemed to be fully immortal.",
        "Activities": "As of the mid-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Annath Sunfall was known to linger near holy sites of [[Mystra]] until forcefully expelled, writing messages to request prayers to Mystra for him. He hoped that she would one day allow him to choose another fate.",
        "History": "After slaying [[Tyvbolt Arsurath]], Annath began the process of developing a new order of mages with superior magic and several innate abilities to keep order throughout [[Faerûn]], beginning with his apprentices. Unfortunately, the process of instilling them with new abilities killed many, mangled others, and permanently turned the rest against him, making them bent on slaying him. After this, he sought \"purer, better\" mages.\n\nYears later, his next attempt met a similar end, only that it took less deaths and mishaps for the new batch to turn against him. They chased him across Faerûn; his knowledge of old traps, caches, and the lay of the land allowed him to prevail. Upon prevailing, however, he renounced all magic in his frustration, and insulted Mystra, judging it better that she and the ''[[Weave ]]'' were to become nothingness rather than exist in a way that his dream could not be fulfilled.\n\nHe was stripped of the office an instant later, and [[Mystra's Choice]] was thrust upon him. He lived until at least the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], as a [[grell]]-like creature whose touch distorted and destroyed magic."
