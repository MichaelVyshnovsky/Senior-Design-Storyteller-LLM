Naazlog was an orog in Thar in 1374 DR.
In 1369 DR, Naazlog, alongside his siblings Daazlag and his leader Thrull, emerged from the Underdark to the XÃ»l-Jarak citadel in Thar. There the orc adept Jurrg proclaimed them "sons of Gruumsh" and Thrull the new king of Thar. Quickly, Thrull ordered Naazlog and Daazlag to act as his lieutenants.
In 1374 DR, Naazlog was with twelve orc warriors who forged and crafted weapons for the Thrulls army.
