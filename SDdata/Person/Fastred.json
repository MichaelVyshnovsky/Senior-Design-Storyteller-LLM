        "mainbody": "human\nFastred was an infamous bandit chieftain who was based in the Vast Swamp between Cormyr and Sembia hundreds of years before the 14 century DR.\nMany histories of Cormyr made mention of Fastred, both in history and local legend, such as Carcroft the Longs Anthropologic and Folkloric Historie of the Settled Lands.\nIn his day, Fastred commanded a gang of brigands and killers who regularly preyed on the caravans that crossed the Way of the Manticore. They slew all those who would not surrender and looted the caravans of their riches like gold, silver, and gems before escaping back into the Vast Swamp. Fastred used his exceptional knowledge of the swampland and its treacherous terrain to evade pursuers, even when small armies sought him, leaving hunters caught in bogs and drowned. He seemed to have little trouble with the other denizens of the Vast Swamp, such as the goblins, lizardfolk, trolls, and grells.\nThus he lived like a king, in security and riches, until at last he faced his death, from natural causes,\nIn the years after, a legend arose that Fastreds ghost lingered, guarding his treasure still against any who would seek or stumble across it. It became one of the most dreaded of the Vast Swamps many threats.\nSightings of a mysterious glowing axe-wielding figure said to be Fastreds ghost became common in the farmland around the town of Ghars, northwest of the Vast Swamp, in the , starting in late Mirtul. It had townsfolk and farmers fearful and caused business at the nearby Swamp Rat tavern to decline. In fact, the ghost was nothing more than blacksmiths assistant Dovo in old armor, carrying a large axe, and smeared all over with glowing glimmergrass paint. His beheaded body was found on Eleint 17, and the real Fastreds ghost was initially considered as a possible suspect, with the motive being vengeance against the imitator, but he was eventually ruled out after various mundane clues were found. Meanwhile, the adventuress Kendra had come to Ghars while hunting Fastreds treasure. Grodoveth, a kings envoy, had researched Fastred in the Ghars library and given Dovo the idea as a cover for their spying operation.\nThen, after midnight on Eleint 20, the true ghost of Fastred finally appeared in person at the edge of the Vast Swamp and advanced on Tobald as he fled justice at Benelaiuss cottage. Fastred only watched as Tobald backed into a mire and was sucked down to drown, before fading away. Later, Benelaius and Jasper returned to Fastreds tomb to discuss what really transpired there.\nBenelaius later arranged for Fastreds treasure to be paid to Dovos widow and children, via a fiction of an inheritance from a distant relative.\nAlthough hidden, Fastreds tomb wasnt especially hard to find, with sufficient research into local folklore, history, and geography. Slime-slicked stone stairs led down into a subterranean chamber, where Fastreds own axe was mounted in a trap to be hurled at the first person to step foot inside and trip the cord across the floor.\nFrom here, a  tunnel carved by water led to a much-larger cavern. Here, atop a dais, Fastreds armored body sat in a throne, decayed to bare bones, rotting wood, and rusted iron, with cushions lost to mold by the mid-1300s DR. His treasure chest sat on the ground at his feet. Runes carved into the wall above the throne read Fastreds epitaph.\nIn life and in death, Fastred was a giant of a man, being tall, broad of body and thick of limb. He wore a gleaming mail shirt and carried a huge axe. As a ghost, he had long hair and a deathly look of sunken cheeks, grim mouth, and disturbing eyes, and he emanated a cold blue glow.\nHe was notorious for his enormous battleaxe, said to be able to cut people in two."
