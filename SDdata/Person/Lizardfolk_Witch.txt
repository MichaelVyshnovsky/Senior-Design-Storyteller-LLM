The so-called '''Lizardfolk Witch''' was a [[potion]] brewer and a merchant who operated in [[Undergate]], [[Westgate]]'s shady underbelly, in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The Lizardfolk Witch was a scaled [[humanoid]], an upright-walking lizard with powerful physique, clad hands, long tail, and sharp-toothed jaws. She had reddish hide and grayish scales.

==Possessions==
Among potions concocted by the Witch were ''[[potions of barkskin]]'', ''[[potions of bear's endurance]]'', ''[[potions of bull's strength]]'', ''[[potions of cat's grace]]'', ''[[potions of death armor]]'', and ''[[potions of lore]]''.

==History==
The Lizardfolk Witch once was a respected [[shaman]] of her people until her tribe was made extinct by a great sickness. She believed that the plague was brought by the Great Lizard, [[Ibrandul]]. The Witch did not know how she escaped the sickness so she assumed the Great Lizard protected her as one of the deity's holy ones. Being left lone, the Witch sought safety among the "hairy ones," eventually settling in the Undergate, where the warm-blooded races allowed lizardfolk to live in relative peace.
