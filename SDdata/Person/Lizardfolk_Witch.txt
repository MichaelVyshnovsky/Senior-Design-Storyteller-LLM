The so-called Lizardfolk Witch was a potion brewer and a merchant who operated in Undergate, Westgates shady underbelly, in the late 14 century DR.
The Lizardfolk Witch was a scaled humanoid, an upright-walking lizard with powerful physique, clad hands, long tail, and sharp-toothed jaws. She had reddish hide and grayish scales.
Among potions concocted by the Witch were potions of barkskin, potions of bears endurance, potions of bulls strength, potions of cats grace, potions of death armor, and potions of lore.
The Lizardfolk Witch once was a respected shaman of her people until her tribe was made extinct by a great sickness. She believed that the plague was brought by the Great Lizard, Ibrandul. The Witch did not know how she escaped the sickness so she assumed the Great Lizard protected her as one of the deitys holy ones. Being left lone, the Witch sought safety among the "hairy ones," eventually settling in the Undergate, where the warm-blooded races allowed lizardfolk to live in relative peace.
