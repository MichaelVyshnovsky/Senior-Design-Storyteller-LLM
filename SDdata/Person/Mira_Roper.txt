Mira Roper was a guard in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR. 
Mira was one of the few guards on the payroll of the Red Plumes in the village of Hillpicket.
Circa 1486 DR, Mira was concerned about the arrival of the wandering Doctor Jubals Carnival of Curiosities.
Mira did not agree with the ideology of the Red Plumes and her work in the rural areas proved to her that non-humans were good people. She was concerned about Aelias theory about the Carnival.
