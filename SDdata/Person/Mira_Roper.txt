'''Mira Roper''' was a guard in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/No Foolish Matter|8}} 

==Activities==
Mira was one of the few guards on the payroll of the [[Red Plumes]] in the village of [[Hillpicket]].
 
==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Mira was concerned about the arrival of the wandering [[Doctor Jubal's Carnival of Curiosities]].

==Personality==
Mira did not agree with the ideology of the Red Plumes and her work in the rural areas proved to her that non-[[human]]s were good people. She was concerned about [[Aelia]]'s theory about the Carnival.
