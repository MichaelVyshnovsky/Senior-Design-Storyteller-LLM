'''Mennek Ariz''' was a traitorous [[Red Wizard of Thay]] in [[Daggerford]].

==Personality==
Mennek, as an enchanter, greatly despised the preeminence of the [[necromancers]] over his land and secretly aligned with rebels who sought to overthrow [[Szass Tam]] and the necromancers from control of Thay.

==History==
Mennek was an [[enchanter]] in his home of [[Thay]] and secretly a member of the rebels known as the [[Thayan Resurrection]]. He volunteered for a mission to Daggerford. Here, Mennek tried to find an opportunity to turn his situation around and this opportunity arrived in the form of a [[pit fiend]] named [[Baazka]]. Baazka tried to possess him but failed. Mennek sensed the event and made a bargain with the pit fiend. Using Baazka's knowledge, he rose to prominence among his fellows in [[Bloodgate]].

He helped adventurers sent by Sir [[Isteval]] to ruin some Red Wizard plots in Daggerford in [[1485 DR]].

In early [[1486 DR]], he was captured by Daggerford's militiamen thanks to information from Baazka through [[Shalendra Floshin]]. Mennek knew the pit fiend's plot and agreed. The goal of Mennek and his fellow rebels was to destroy [[Bloodgate Keep]] in order to show the weakness of Red Wizard necromancers.

However, tricked by the pit fiend, Mennek ended up transporting into the [[Doomvault]], where Red Wizards brainwashed and charmed him into serving [[Szass Tam]]. Now one of Tam's most loyal followers, he was tasked with the custody of the [[Chosen]] of [[Ilmater]], [[Kieren]], until he met again the heroes of Daggerford.
