Rorstil Hallowdant was the High Steward of King Foril Obarskyr I of Cormyr.
The man was lazy and given to drinking heavily. Per Joreld Nurennanthur, he was given to saying "thats a matter of some dispute". 
After the disappearance of the Royal Magician Ganrahast and his second in command Vainrence, Rorstil Hallowdant rebuked the Master of Revels, Khaladan Mallowfaer, for a perceived excess from his own authority. Curiously, most seemed to agree with him there.
In the day of the Council of the Dragon, Hallowdant had to excuse himself with some intestinal distress, forcing him to delegate the checking of the Hall of Justice to Corleth Fentable, his understeward, who had poisoned him. He was abed and snoring when the understeward left the palace, later, after the Council was finally held.
He was found dead later at Staghaven House alongside all its inhabitants, his body cursed so that anyone who tried to pry information out of it was struck down with insanity.
Mirt seemed to think he could sneak in Amarune Whitewave and Storm Silverhand into Castle Obarskyr claiming they were exotic dancers for Hallowdant.
