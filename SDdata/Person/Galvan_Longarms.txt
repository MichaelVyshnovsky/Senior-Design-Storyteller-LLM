'''Galvan Longarms''' was a [[firbolg]] [[proxy]] of the [[Giant pantheon|Giantish]] [[power]] known as [[Hiatea]].

==Description==
Like all proxies of Hiatea, this firbolg was unusually large and strong for his race.

==Personality==
Galvan had a deep hatred for [[evil]] [[giant]]s and their deities.

==Possessions==
Galvan dressed in a set of [[scale armor]], fashioned from the scales of a [[hydra]], and carried two huge flaming ''[[spear]]s +3''. These functioned similarly to ''[[sun blade]]s''.

==Activities==
Though Galvan would never betray Hiatea, he would take some indirect action to aid those seeking to combat giants.
