        "Description": "The Voidharrow was able to take any form it wished to, but it was usually encountered as a twisting red liquid crystal with pulsing lines of silver and flecked with gold.",
        "Personality": "As a direct creation of Tharizdun, the Voidharrow was a force of chaos with no understanding of [[human]] emotions. Its personality was torn between fulfilling the will of its creator and fulfilling its own purposes.",

Tharizdun infused his will into this substance, giving it sentience. This new creature was called \"The Progenitor\".\n\nThe Progenitor remained trapped with Tharizdun for aeons, until it was released by worshipers of the evil god using a fragment of the [[Living Gate]] to create a [[Vast Gate]] that was able to breach Tharizdun's prison for a small amount of time, enough for Tharizdun to send The Progenitor out. After being freed from its imprisonment, The Progenitor changed into the Voidharrow, and began spreading its Abyssal Plague across all the [[multiverse]].\n\nThe Voidharrow was eventually destroyed by heroes from the world of [[Nerath]], but even after its death its will caused chaos in [[Toril]] thanks to the efforts of its heralds [[Murmur]] and [[Scour]], who unleashed the Abyssal Plague onto [[Faer√ªn]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}.<ref><ref>"
