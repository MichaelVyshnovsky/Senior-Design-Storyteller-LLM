His Highness '''Coram Haedrak Errilam Vander Silvam Rhindaun''' was the first son and second child of Queen [[Zaranda Star]] and King [[Haedrak Rhindaun III]] and Prince of the [[Iltkazar Highlands]] of [[Tethyr]].

==Relationships==
Prince Coram was the middle child of the triplets born to Zaranda. His sisters were [[Sybille Rhindaun]] and [[Cyriana Rhindaun]]. As was the tradition in Tethyr for princes and princesses, the first son always shared the first name of his father as his second name.

[[Vander Stillhawk]] was the boy's regent and ruled the Iltkazar Highlands in his place. Vander was very protective of Coram.

Later in life, Coram would have a daughter, [[Jemra Rhindaun]], who would marry into the [[Obarskyr]] royal family of [[Cormyr]].

==History==
Coram and his two sisters were born in [[Flamerule]] of the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]]. This was the first time there had been royal triplets in Tethyr since the reign of Queen [[Alisande Bormul]] in [[832 DR]].

Within two months, the [[Syl-Pasha]] [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]] sent word to Tethyr offering a marriage proposal between Coram and el Pesarkhal's granddaughter [[Sarya el Thamal]]. It is not recorded how Tethyr responded.
