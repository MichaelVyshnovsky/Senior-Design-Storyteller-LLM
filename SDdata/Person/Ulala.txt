'''Ulala''' was a [[dustdigger]] and pet of the famed smith [[Jogaoh]], protecting his home in the [[Sword Coast]] lands.

When [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Cybriana]], [[Timoth Eyesbright]], [[Onyx the Invincible]], and [[Priam Agrivar]] sought out the smith in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], they sighted a pool of sparkling fresh water and rushed into it. They were soon ensnared by the dustdigger, which dropped the illusion and tried to devour them. Fortunately, Jogaoh called off his pet.{{Cite comic/The Bounty Seekers Of Manshaka|1}}
