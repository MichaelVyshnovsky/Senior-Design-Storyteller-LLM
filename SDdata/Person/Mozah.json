However, the adventurer did not come back. The Kalach-Cha could investigate into the matter. Upon returning with Mozah with his pay (which was located in Highcliff Castle, held by one of the zombies near the shadow priest), the Kalach-Cha could lie nothing was found and keep the money. Otherwise, the Kalach-Cha could give the money back and get half as a reward."
