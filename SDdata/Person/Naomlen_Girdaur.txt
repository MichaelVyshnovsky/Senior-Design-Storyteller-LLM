'''Naomlen Girdaur''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[rogue]] and adventurer of [[Waterdeep]]. She was known to work for [[Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]], but only to the extent that doing so furthered her goals or the goals of the [[Zhentarim]].

==Description==
The skilled rogue had long blonde hair, tied with many hairbands. Naomlen also had a deep scar over her left eye, 

==Personality==
Naomlen had an indomitable spirit that shined through even in hard times. She was driven and patient, but also motivated by revenge. She was loyal to her friends, but liable to steal something valuable from any new place she visited. 

==Possessions==
She duel-wielded [[dagger]]s, [[short sword]]s, or [[kukri]]s&mdash;of which she took immaculate care&mdash;and wore [[leather armor]]. She openly wore the symbol of the Zhentarim on her [[Faceless Eyes of the Zhentarim|face-covering hood]].

Naomlen carried ''[[elixir of luck|elixirs of luck]]'' and possessed several [[magic items]], including the ''[[subtle blades]]'', a ''[[belt of concealment]]'', and a pair of ''[[goggles of minute seeing]]''. She also wore the ''[[elusive ring]]'', a plain-looking magic [[ring]] that she believed had been crafted by her great-grandmother, and carried the ''[[blades of abundant caution]]'' and ''[[seal of circumspection]]'', both of which had been awarded to her by Laeral Silverhand.

==Abilities==
Naomlen was an expert at moving silently and getting into the perfect strategic position without leaving any trace of her presence. She commonly applied [[poison]] to her weapons.

==Relationships==
She regarded as allies her adventuring companions [[Halbenet Soladonel]], [[Tommus Tallstep]], and [[Shevarith Kendia]]. While she was a member of the Zhentarim, she only worked with them to further her personal goals of restoring her family legacy. 

==History==
Naomlen's family had been famous as artisans until a generation ago when they were robbed of their artisan tools and finished works, causing them to fall from fame. The dwarf became an adventurer who would locate lost treasures for the highest bidder, or the original owner. However, she kept her own family's work for herself, and eventually used reclaimed pieces of Girdaur works to craft a pair of [[enchanted]] kukris, which she dubbed the ''[[kukris of cunning]]'' and treasured above all her other possessions.
