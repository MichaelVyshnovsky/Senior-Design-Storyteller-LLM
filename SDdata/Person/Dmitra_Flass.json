        "mainbody": "'''Dmitra Flass''', also known unofficially as the '''First Princess of Thay''' or '''The Tharchioness''', was the [[Tharchion]] of [[Eltabbar (tharch)|Eltabbar]] within the realm of [[Thay]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], and subsequently the [[Zulkir]] of [[Illusion]] among the [[Red Wizards]] during the [[War of the Zulkirs]]. She was also a powerful figure in [[Mulmaster]] following her marriage to that city state's ruler, [[High Blade]] [[Selfaril Uoumdolphin]].",
        "Description": "Dmitra had been dubbed the \"First Princess of Thay\"&mdash;although only outside of Thay itself&mdash;owing to her famous beauty. She specifically cultivated an \"exotic\" look with her clean-shaven head and elaborate [[tattoo]]s (which she maintained as per Thayvian noble custom), although as a master of illusion [[magic]], she could simply change her appearance at will. She had green eyes, and a voluptuous build.\n\nShe stood at {{SI|5'3|'\"|c|long=yes}} and weighed {{SI|118|pounds|k|long=yes}}.",
        "Personality": "She was known for her sharp wits and iron will. She was the most diplomatic among all of the tharchions and zulkirs, and her efforts to discourage feuds and to help settle disputes between them were said to have been the only reason that Thay had not descended into civil war in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.",
        "Abilities": "As a powerful [[wizard]] She could also conjure a flying horse.",
        "Possessions": "Dmitra dressed in ostentatious fashion, often wearing several layers of [[robe]]s, and/or a ''[[robe of scintillating colors]]''. She would laden herself with [[jewelry]], particularly piercings and also [[necklace]]s, which she wore both around her neck and across her head like [[circlet]]s. \n\nIn battle, she wielded a [[staff]] and an ''[[ebon lash]]''.",
        "Activities": "As the Tharchion of Eltabbar, Dmitra presided over the Thayan capital of [[Eltabbar]] as well as [[Lake Thaylambar]] and many of the fishing communities around it. She was known to delegate much of the day-to-day running of the [[tharch]] to her [[Autharch]]es while she remained politically active by managing relationships with neighboring realms. Relative to other Thayan tharchions, she was said to have an almost \"enlightened\" style of rulership.\n\nShe owned a great many of the public spaces in the city of Eltabbar, as well as thousands of [[slave]]s.\n\nDmitra was involved in actively expanding Red Wizard power and trade outside of Thay. Hers was the largest and most effective network of spies in all of Thay, and were known to ruthlessly dispose of their enemies. Dmitra often did some spying herself, mostly in the guise of a pretty [[Rashemen|Rashemi]] young woman.\n\nPrior to the [[Time of Troubles]], she was thought to pay respect to [[Leira]], the [[goddess]] of illusion.",
        "Relationships": "Dmitra Flass had no allegiance to the [[Flass]] family, and she would frequently use different names as a result. This led to many simply referring to her as \"The Tharchioness\" within Thay or the \"First Princess of Thay\" beyond its borders, a title that her fellow Red Wizards found quite amusing.\n\nShe was married to the High Blade of Mulmaster, Selfaril Uoumdolphin&mdash;which was actually his twin brother [[Rassendyll Uoumdolphin]], who had imprisoned and impersonated Selfaril&mdash;making her a princess and authority figure in Mulmaster. Her and Selfaril's relationship was known to be marred by violent arguments, and she didn't spend much time in the company of her husband or in his city, preferring to visit Mulmaster only three times each year and using magic to make the trip quickly. Their political marriage greatly increased both her and the Red Wizards' power within the [[Moonsea]] region. She maintained a large retinue at the [[Thayan enclave]] in Mulmaster&mdash;led by Conjuremaster [[Ahryn Firefinger]]&mdash;to promote the Red Wizards' interests and to counter the influence of rivals like the [[Zhentarim]]. \n\nDmitra recruited several servants from Mulmaster to serve her back in Eltabbar in the hopes that their lack of ties in Thay would make them less likely to betray her. One of her most trusted servants was [[Malark Springhill]], whom she brought with her from Mulmaster to manage her network of spies.\n\nThe Red Wizard [[Rembert Wellford]] was a distant cousin to Dmitra.",
        "History": {
            "Early Life": "Dmitra was born into the [[Thayan]] noble family of Flass in the {{YearlinkName|1334}}. Following a major dispute, she severed ties with the family, and although the dispute itself was soon mostly forgotten, the grudge endured and the young Dmitra preferred to avoid using her real name.\n\nBy the 1350s DR, the young Dmitra was Tharchioness of Eltabbar, but her power in the city of Eltabbar itself was tentative. The large number of influential Red Wizards residing in the city meant that her authority&mdash;as a relatively novice mage&mdash;was subject to their whims. In most cases, she simply retreated from governing the tharch and left it to her Autharches, who in turn spent much of their time pandering to meddling Red Wizards. she began a courtship with her future husband, Selfaril of Mulmaster, when she sent him a [[gold]] [[earing]] soaked in [[perfume]] and he in turn sent her a [[cloak]] of [[yeti]] fur. This exchange of gifts allowed the pair to begin meeting in person&mdash;rather than just corresponding through proxies&mdash;without fear of scandal, gossip, or the risk of offending Thayan custom.",
            "Rise to Power": "Over the course of the 1360s DR, Dmitra expanded both her political and magical power significantly, establishing herself as an important figure and becoming a staunch ally to Szass Tam. she wielded direct control over her subjects while her Autharches managed menial tasks such as rebuilding her city.{{Dmitra-Selfaril-marriage}} also helped to solidify her power as it granted her influence beyond Thay's borders. Unbeknownst to her, Selfaril had actually been secretly usurped and replaced earlier that year by his twin brother, Rassendyll. Given that she only rarely visited her new husband, Dmitra continued to remain unaware that she had married a different man.\n\nBy the end of the decade, her spies were ruthlessly seeking out the agents of her and Tam's rivals, and her rule over Eltabbar was rarely challenged by fellow Red Wizards. which ended up bringing her into conflict with everyone from the [[Brotherhood of the Cloak]] to the [[Strifelord]] of the [[Citadel of the Raven]].\n\nEarly in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Dmitra was with her husband in Mulmaster for a celebration of their wedding anniversary when they received a group of [[gemstone golem]]s as a gift from the Thayan Ambassador [[Reyvan]], but the constructs went rogue in an apparent assassination attempt. Both of them survived, but Dmitra immediately returned to Eltabbar. On [[Kythorn 3]] of that same year, Dmitra was present alongside Szass Tam and other Red Wizards when the [[demon lord]] [[Eltab]] escaped his bonds. In the chaos, she suffered severe burns and blistering when her garments caught fire on a wayward torch and her many pieces of jewelry became super-heated. The flames were extinguished by [[Thazienne Uskevren]], and her injuries were addressed by Tharchion [[Azhir Kren]].",
            "War of the Zulkirs": "In the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, when Szass Tam seized rulership of all Thay by force, Dmitra's loyalty for the lich ended. She called for a secret meeting of all zulkirs who had once supported Tam and convinced them to raise their combined armies and wizards to oppose the lich's forces. The council achieved a great victory at the [[Keep of Thazar]] against an [[undead]] army led by Szass Tam's [[necromancers]]. Szass responded by sending the combined forces of [[Gauros]] and [[Surthay]], along with hordes of undead, south towards [[Bezantur]]. This enabled Dmitra to enlist the other opposing zulkirs&mdash;[[Nevron]], [[Lauzoril]], and [[Mythrellan]]&mdash;to her council of resistance as well.\n\nFollowing the demise of Mythrellan, the long-serving Zulkir of Illusion, Dmitra assumed her title.\n\nDuring a decisive fight at the [[Keep of Sorrows]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, Szass almost succeeded in magically forcing Dmitra to fight for his cause, but his magic failed as the [[Spellplague]] hit and Dmitra was released from his hold. The war continued despite the crippling effects of the Spellplague on magic.\n\nDmitra's spymaster, Malark Springhill, suddenly switched sides to fight for Szass Tam's cause. During another battle at the Keep of Sorrows, Malark attempted to kill Dmitra with the intention to spare her from undeath.\n\nAccording to history books a century later, and as [[Xenk Yendar]] would recall, in the mid-1370s [[DR]], Szass Tam called all the other zulkirs and all the people of the [[Thaymount (tharch)|Thaymount tharch]], Xenk and his parents among them, to a grand celebration atop the Citadel on [[Kythorn 19|the eve]] of the [[summer solstice]]. A few of the common people carried sun symbols.<ref group=\"note\">''Honor Among Thieves'' only says \"the capital\" of Thay, which at the time should be [[Eltabbar]]. However, it is presumed Xenk lived in Thaymount, owing to him bearing Tam's tattoo and the apparent depiction of the Citadel. Moreover, Xenk may be referring to it as the present capital. Therefore, the Citadel is presumed instead.<ref group=\"note\">''Honor Among Thieves'' mentions only the eve of the solstice; due to the presence of sun-like symbols in the crowd, this is presumed to be the summer solstice. The newly revived sun god [[Amaunator]] has a similar holy symbol and treats the summer solstice as a holy day, suggesting a link to the celebration. But it was all a lie—instead, Szass interrupted Zulkir Dmitra Flass as she addressed the crowd and used the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'', thereby creating an army of undead under his control for his coup and following conquest of Thay. All who tried to flee were slain by Red Wizards in his service.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}<ref group=\"note\">It is difficult to reconcile Xenk's account and the scenes in ''Honor Among Thieves'' with the established history of Szass Tam, the zulkirs, and Thay, as Tam's betrayal here contradicts his betrayals elsewhere. It appears to conflate the zulkirs gathering at the Citadel in ''The Crimson Gold'' in 1373 DR; the meeting of the Council of Zulkirs in Eltabbar, the start of the War of the Zulkirs, and Tam's takeover of Thay in ''Unclean'' in 1375 DR; and a later new event of Tam creating his undead armies from his subjects. Since this is presented as a story from a book a century later and from Xenk's childhood memories, it's presumed to be a case of unreliable narration or movie dramatization. Nevertheless, it is presented here for completeness.",
