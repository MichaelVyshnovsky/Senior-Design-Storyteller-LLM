Your faces don't look familiar to me. Then again, my eyes aren't what they used to be. Heh. Name's Thom, Thom Farold.''|Thom Farold}}",
        "Description": "By [[1281 DR]], Thom was an aged [[human]] man with light skin tone, his hair whitened and eyesight dulled by age.",
        "Possessions": "Thom and his late wife lived in a cabin in Lonelywood, elevated from the frozen ground and perched atop tall stilts, next to the town's [[windmill]]. The cabin's entrance was only accessible via a tall ladder.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Thom Farold was a widower. He honored his late wife by building a large boat that could transport up to seven people. ''[[Selara]]'', the boat, was named after her. During the late 13{{th}} century DR, Thom could often be found fishing with his friend, a not-so-humble fisher named [[Young Ned]]. In his later years, Thom took on building small boats, with ''Selara'' being his biggest project, when he was not over-indulging in [[ale]]."
