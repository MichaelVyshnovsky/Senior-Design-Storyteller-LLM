'''Katl''' was an [[Eagle Knights (Maztica)|Eagle Knight]] in [[Maztica]].

==History==
In late [[1361 DR]], Katl was one of the many officers in the assorted column of refugee led by [[Cordell]]. When the survivors arrived in [[Ulatos]] and discovered that the place was under the control of [[Don Vaez]], an old rival of Cordell, Katl tried to kill Don using his eagle form but was defeated and severely injured.

Put in prison with all the officers of the [[Golden Legion]], he was near death but Cordell offered Don Vaez all his gold in order to have a [[cleric]] save him.
