'''Saurglyce''' was a female [[white dragon]] [[dracolich]] and a partner of [[Pox (lich)|Pox]] in [[Yartar]] in [[1369 DR]].

==Personality==
Saurglyce had a very close bond with her humanoid partner.

==History==
Saurglyce was transformed into dracolich by Pox and served the [[lich]] as her mount, partner, and confidante. One day, Pox arrived in Yartar riding Saurglyce. They then started to gather followers to establish a Cult cell in the city.

In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, after the [[Rage of Dragons]], the [[drow-dragon]] [[Nurvureem]] aided Cult rebels to drive Pox and Saurglyce out of Yartar.<ref>
