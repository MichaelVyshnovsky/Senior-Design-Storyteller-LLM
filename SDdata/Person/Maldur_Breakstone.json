        "mainbody": "aldur Breakstone was a human wizard in the service of the gold dragon king Orchtrien of Dawnfire during the Time of Dragons in the 26 millennium before Dalereckoning.\nHe was burly, with a florid face, and long hair dyed white.\nMaldur considered race a foremost preoccupation, and believed that elves did not value human life. He was also vindictive and scheming, taking constant stock of the perceived weaknesses of his rivals and delighting in their suffering.\nMaldur Breakstone was a wizard. Among his many spells were one that created a striking fist made of force, one that invoked storm forces to strike with lightning and roaring thunder both, one that sent forth deadly shafts of shadow that caused terror in those whom they struck, and one that radiated bolts of light from him to a great distance away. Another of his spells made his palms sprout fanged mouths. Finally, one of his spells created a scarlet radiance that broke other magics, though it was not clear whether he used all that magic under his own power or if it came from his possessions. He could also cause blinding flashes or explosions, one of which or both came from a wand.\nHe had numerous amulets and enchanted rings. Of note, he carried an ivory wand that caused either blinding flashes or explosions, perhaps both.\nHe was a wizard in the court of Dawnfire, serving as a deputy for the King.\nHe served King Orchtrien, and was a rival to fellow wizard and royal deputy Rhespen Ash.\nMaldur Breakstone had been a rival of Rhespen Ash for years. Maldur pushed King Orchtrien to rule in ways favorable to humans, in direct opposition to Rhespens preferred policies.\nAfter the rebellion of the three elven clans, Starfall, Vilirith, and Duskmere in , which Prince Bexendral put down, Maldur counseled King Orchtrien that the entire clans be put to the sword right away the King instead took the advice of his rival, Rhespen Ash, to be more merciful. The heirs of the clans were taken to Dawnfire, where they would be educated, and serve as hostages at the same time.\nDuring a dinner revel celebrating Orchtriens victory over the red triumvirate, the King asked one of the hostages, Lady Winterflower Duskmere, to sing for him. She sang a ballad about a mad king bringing forth ruin, which Maldur took as an opportunity to chastise her, using a spell to strike her with a fist made of force. He accused her of maligning the king with her song Rhespen Ash, his rival, defended the Lady. King Orchtrien bid them duel, for he considered their rivalry had gone on long enough. Maldur was defeated in that duel.\nLater the same year, after Rhespen Ash returned from winter incursions against the neighboring lands of the green cabal, his forces were met on the path to Dawnfire by Maldur Breakstone, who brought them fresh horses and garments in advance of the celebration in Rhespens honor. This made Rhespen quite suspicious, owing to Maldurs rank and the trivialness of the task. Maldur also informed Rhespen that the King had taken Winterflower Duskmere as his lover, to forestall any awkwardness. He took pleasure in breaking the bad news to his rival, who had fallen for her.\nAfter the party, Maldur noticed Rhespen was missing much of the time, and tired throughout the day. He spent the next few months anticipating that Rhespen would try to meet in secret with Winterflower. He eventually succeeded in catching him visiting the Lady, only to discover that the elven wizard had transcribed the Kings books of magic. With the aid of several half-dragon crossbowmen, Maldur managed to subdue Rhespen, but Winterflower stole the elfs staff, the copied spellbooks, and escaped.\nMaldur later took part in the search for the Kings spellbooks. He commanded some of the forces that attacked the Duskmere family stronghold."
