        "History": "Sometime before the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], Guffaw was plucked by Arcturia from his [[Underdark]] mine and taken to [[Arcturiadoom]], where she altered him to possess a voracious appetite for worked and carved stone. He felt wholly compelled to eat any such stone he encountered and had to limit how much he could devour."
