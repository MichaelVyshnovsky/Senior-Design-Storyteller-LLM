        "mainbody": "The '''Edgewarden''' was a [[Keeper of the Cerulean Sign]] who watched the gate to [[Stardeep]]'s hidden passages in [[Sildëyuir]]. He was active until at least the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Stardeep|223-228}}",
        "Description": "In winter of {{yearlink|1375}}, the Edgewarden was a lean figure, a tall, regal elf dressed in black robes emblazoned with the symbol of the [[Keepers of the Cerulean Sign]]. His eyes were milky white, with no iris; his shaved head made his ears look sinister rather than fey. He had a ramrod posture, and graceful, but worn features. He wore a platinum circlet.",
        "Abilities": "Though he knew healing arts, he could not remove [[nilshai]] poison, only delay it. He also had the gift of divination, and was able to tell that [[Raidon Kane]]'s mother was [[Erunyauvë]] by sight. He could also reinscribe the borders of [[Sildëyuir]].",
        "Possessions": "He bore a platinum circlet and a robe.",
        "Activities": "As of {{yearlink|1375}}, he had not seen anyone other than nilshai come his way for seven years. He wondered if he might be the last Keeper of the Cerulean Sign.",
        "Relationships": "[[Kiril Duskmourn]] held great respect for the Edgewarden.",
        "History": "In winter of {{yearlink|1375}}, he was approached by [[Kiril Duskmourn]] and [[Raidon Kane]], who were carrying [[Adrik Commorand]] and looking for both healing and a path into [[Stardeep]]. Kiril also informed the Edgewarden that the nilshai invaders were agents of the [[aboleth]], and that Raidon carried a [[Cerulean Sign]]. Looking at Raidon and his Sign, the Edgewarden divined that his mother's name was [[Erunyauvë]], and assured the monk that he would share any information on her if [[Carnis|the Traitor]] was stopped."
