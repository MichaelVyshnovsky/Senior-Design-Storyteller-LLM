        "mainbody": "he Edgewarden was a Keeper of the Cerulean Sign who watched the gate to Stardeeps hidden passages in Sildëyuir. He was active until at least the late 14 century DR.\nIn winter of , the Edgewarden was a lean figure, a tall, regal elf dressed in black robes emblazoned with the symbol of the Keepers of the Cerulean Sign. His eyes were milky white, with no iris his shaved head made his ears look sinister rather than fey. He had a ramrod posture, and graceful, but worn features. He wore a platinum circlet.\nThough he knew healing arts, he could not remove nilshai poison, only delay it. He also had the gift of divination, and was able to tell that Raidon Kanes mother was Erunyauvë by sight. He could also reinscribe the borders of Sildëyuir.\nHe bore a platinum circlet and a robe.\nAs of , he had not seen anyone other than nilshai come his way for seven years. He wondered if he might be the last Keeper of the Cerulean Sign.\nKiril Duskmourn held great respect for the Edgewarden.\nIn winter of , he was approached by Kiril Duskmourn and Raidon Kane, who were carrying Adrik Commorand and looking for both healing and a path into Stardeep. Kiril also informed the Edgewarden that the nilshai invaders were agents of the aboleth, and that Raidon carried a Cerulean Sign. Looking at Raidon and his Sign, the Edgewarden divined that his mothers name was Erunyauvë, and assured the monk that he would share any information on her if the Traitor was stopped."
