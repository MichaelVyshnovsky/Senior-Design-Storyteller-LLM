'''Temigast''' was the steward of [[Auckney]], serving under the Lord of Auckney since [[1339 DR]], the Year of the Weeping Moon. 

==Description==
Temigast essentially ran Auckney from beside the scene, advising Lord [[Feringal Auck]] in all important matters of state. He was quite the gentleman, one of the few in Auckney knowledgeable of places and events outside the fiefdom. His hobby was painting seascapes. 

==History==
Temigast was originally from Waterdeep. He came to Auckney as a merchant, but he then settled there and became a counselor for the then lord of Auckney, [[Tristan Auck]].

==Relationships==
Temigast helped raise Feringal and [[Priscilla Auck]] after their parents died.

He secretly shared his bed with Feringal's sister, [[Priscilla Auck]], who took care of the flower garden outside the palace. 

He was friendly towards Auck's fiance, [[Meralda Ganderlay]], even though she had been lying with other men, more specifically another man, [[Jaka Sculi]]. It was revealed that he knew Meralda's secret all along, but kept it for her sake. Meralda considered him a source of support.
