Undril Silvertusk was a half-orc priestess of Torm and a representative of the Order of the Gauntlet who was active in  during the late 15 century DR.
Undril was a reasonable person.
She wore a chain shirt and was hesitant to part with this armor, even in conditions in which doing so was beneficial.
Around the time of the events of the death curse, Undril was tasked by her superiors in the Order of the Gauntlet with personally delivering a bundle of dispatches to Niles Breakbone, the leader of the Orders expedition to purge the undead from the jungles of Chult. Having been led to believe that she could simply acquire a horse in Port Nyanzaru and ride to his base at Camp Vengeance, she was caught off guard by the dense and dangerous jungle conditions upon her arrival in the Port. She thus sought to join any existing expedition that was already headed up the River Soshenstar, along which the camp was located.
