        "mainbody": "Rugmax was a halfling dockworker and a friend of Klevtors in Daggerford. The halfling duo were practical jokesters, with one such joke leading to a young mans death in 1372 DR.\nIn 1372 DR, Fernigold the Younger was among the dock street youth making coin helping the ship captains keeping their cargo safe. Fernigold was the target of Klevtor and Rugmaxs relentless jests because of the mans big dreams of treasures and making his family rich.\nAs a cruel joke, the halflings convinced a traveling merchant to sell a fake map to fool Fernigold the Younger, which eventually led to the young mans disappearance. Days after Fernigold the Youngers disappearance, his father, Fernigold, was able to find help with a group of heroes who offered to look for the missing son. The heroes interrogated the halflings about the missing man. Rugmax was afraid of going to jail for the alleged murder and convinced Klevtor to give a copy of the map they gave to Fernigold the Younger.\nSubsequently, the Hero of Daggerford discovered the body of Fernigold inside Telarthirs tomb. When Klevtor and Rugmax were confronted with the fact that the prank map was real and led to the young mans death, the halflings agreed to surrender themselves to Daggerfords justice system."
