Vhaltus was a professional bodyguard who operated in the city of Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR.
Vhaltus had red hair that they kept in a ponytail. Vhaltus eyes looked as if the thug were continually sleepy.
Vhaltus worked as a guard for Amrik Vanthampur of the noble Baldurian Vanthampur family. Vhaltus always carried a satchel of over 100 gp, which Amrik utilized whenever he thought his life was imperiled.
Along with their noble-born patron, Vhaltus frequented the Low Lantern tavern in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate.
