'''Thusk Tharmuil''' was a powerful [[archmage]] who lived in [[Glister]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was often credited with keeping the town safe despite its hostile location in [[Thar]].
{{Quote|''I'm not the king, duke, or even mayor of this town, but I keep an eye on things as best I can. Actually, I'm supposed to be retired, but who will keep track of what the [[orcs]] and [[ogres]] are doing if I don't?''|Thusk Tharmuil{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|58}}}}

==Description==
Thusk was not merely Glister's most powerful [[wizard]],{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|56}} but one of Glister's claims to fame in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite polyhedron/81/The Everwinking Eye: As Cold As Bare Fingers|8}} The man himself was {{SI|5'8"|ft-in|long=yes}} tall, appearing as a portly man in his 50s with a balding head and a bushy grey unibrow. He preferred to dress simply, such as in a gray robe with black slippers. He did, however, wear a [[silver]]-rimmed belt which held a jeweled [[dagger]].

==Personality==
Thusk was talkative and jovial, and was generally a kind and sympathetic individual. He was gracious to those who shared his zany sense of humor and could make him laugh. He enjoyed eating, drinking, joking, singing, and telling stories, and had a deep, baritone singing voice.
{{Quote|''Well, I really thank you for coming to dinner&mdash;I haven't had a good laugh in quite a long time.''|Thusk Tharmuil}}

==Possessions==
His tower was built into a hill on the east side of Glister.

==Activities==
Thusk was ostensibly retired, although he still took an active interest in the peace and safety of Glister, and kept an eye on the orcs and ogres of Thar as well as the activities of evil factions like the [[Zhentarim]] and the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. He would go so far as to recruit and pay [[adventurer]]s passing through town to solve the regions problems. When sizing up an adventuring party's worthiness, he would invite them to a sumptuous dinner of rich food and [[wine]] to swap tales and tell jokes. If he liked the adventurers, we would treat them to a dessert of [[pudding]] and [[coffee]].

Thusk was a protector of Glister and an important source of its regional power, responsibilities he shared alongside the town's temples: the [[Hall of Luck (Glister)|Hall of Luck]], the [[House of Swords]], and the [[House of Auril's Breath]].{{Cite polyhedron/80/The Everwinking Eye: Temples, Cults, and Idle Gossip in Thentia|31}}

==Relationships==
As of the late 1360s DR, Thusk had a dutiful apprentice named [[Menzel]] and a beleaguered [[cat]] named [[Sasha (cat)|Sasha]].

Thusk kept in touch with other wizards in order to stay abreast of news.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|71}}

He took a hard stance against the Zhentarim and any plans or projects they had within Thar.

==History==
In his adventuring days, Thusk led a party known as The [[Company of the Cat]]. He retired to Glister at some point prior to the [[Vaasan War]] and was nominally credited for being the reason that [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] of Vaasa did not attempt to march his forces across the [[Galena Mountains]] into Thar.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Thusk aided a young refugee from Vaasa to find a band of adventurers to help her rescue her parents from [[dragon]]-riding brigands, whom Thusk correctly surmised to be members of the Cult of the Dragon. Unbeknownst to the archmage, however, the teenage girl was in fact a [[steel dragon]] named [[Steelheart]].
