Eldur Hawkmantle was a Highknight of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
He was guardedly irreverent, but brave.
He was a Highknight.
The group accompanying Eldur Hawkmantle during his assignment under the Lord Warder included four Purple Dragons, one of which was named as Sir Jephford.
Eldur Hawkmantle accompanied the War Wizard Glathra Barcantle and Lord Warder Vainrence to the chambers beneath Castle Obarskyr in the wake of the disastrous Council of the Dragon of the , which was attacked by a blueflame ghost. At the dungeons, they intended consult with five sages, Orkrash, Garendor, Loagranboydar, Argrant and Wyshbryn, who had been sifting through ancient records to determine if any nobles at the time could have been inherited some secret powers of sorcery, so they might have been control the ghost. He figured that all rather quickly on his own at the slightest hint from Glathra.
However, they found the sages reduced to dust, and magic lingering over them. When Vainrence tried to cast a spell to determine the cause of death, there was an explosion from a booby-trapping contingency. Eldur Hawkmantle managed to survive through quick reflexes, as did another of the Purple Dragons in the retinue.
