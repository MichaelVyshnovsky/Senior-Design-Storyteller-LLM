        "mainbody": "'''Garit Strongarm''' was a [[Sembite]] [[adventurer]] and member of the [[Gold Coins]] company ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Garit was hotheaded in the extreme, being easily offended, intensely jealous of any perceived rival, and quick to leap to violence and intimidation. Despite this, he had a kind of dashing charm to him.",
        "Relationships": "Garit wished to court the barmaid [[Annalise]] at the [[Bubbling Bulwark]], but routinely sabotaged his efforts with fits of jealous rage over imagined slights. He also imagined that he had an intense rivalry with Lord [[Partic Thistle]] over Annalise's affections, which Lord Thistle did not deign to acknowledge.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, he attended a party at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]] alongside his companion [[Kerit Darkrider]]. Because of his open hostility towards Lord Thistle, he was considered a likely suspect when the [[Emerald Swords]] company replaced Lord Thistle with a dead [[doppelganger]]."
