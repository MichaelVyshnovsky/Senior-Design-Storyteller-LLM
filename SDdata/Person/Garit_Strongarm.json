        "mainbody": "Garit Strongarm was a Sembite adventurer and member of the Gold Coins company circa 1369 DR.\nGarit was hotheaded in the extreme, being easily offended, intensely jealous of any perceived rival, and quick to leap to violence and intimidation. Despite this, he had a kind of dashing charm to him.\nGarit wished to court the barmaid Annalise at the Bubbling Bulwark, but routinely sabotaged his efforts with fits of jealous rage over imagined slights. He also imagined that he had an intense rivalry with Lord Partic Thistle over Annalises affections, which Lord Thistle did not deign to acknowledge.\nIn the , he attended a party at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail alongside his companion Kerit Darkrider. Because of his open hostility towards Lord Thistle, he was considered a likely suspect when the Emerald Swords company replaced Lord Thistle with a dead doppelganger."
