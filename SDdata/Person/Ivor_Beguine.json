        "History": "In [[1460 DR]], Ivor and his friend [[Gareth Jadaren]] became disgusted with the brutality of their captain and abandoned ship near [[Mulmaster]]. They chanced upon two [[Deva (aasimar)|devas]] and gave them the location of the ''Orcsblood'' and the devas attacked and destroyed the ship. While in Mulmaster, Ivor met a young apprentice [[mage]] named [[Jandi M'baren]] and the two fell in love.\n\nIvor traveled south with Jandi and Gareth toward [[Turmish]]. Along the road, they passed the abandoned [[dwarf|dwarven]] stronghold known as [[Jadaren Hold|Giant's Fist]] and Gareth became convinced the location would be ideal to settle in.\n\nHowever, the former first mate of the ''Orcsblood'', [[Helgre]], had tracked the trio and killed Jandi in revenge for Gareth and Ivor's betrayal. Ivor went on to found the powerful [[Beguine]] merchant family in Turmish.",
