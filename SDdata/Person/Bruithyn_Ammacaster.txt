'''Bruithyn Ammacaster''' was one of the top independent [[incense]] traders in [[Anauroch]] in [[1358 DR]].

Bruithyn was famous for carrying an ''[[iron bands of Bilarro]]'' sphere, to deal with those who threatened him. When he traveled in Anauroch, he always had with him a bodyguard of [[Sembian]] mercenaries and a priest of [[Lathander]] from [[Eveningstar]] for healing.

Bruithyn was popular at the temple of Lathandar for the gifts he gave to that faith.
