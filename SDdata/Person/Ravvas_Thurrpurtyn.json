        "mainbody": "During the late 1350s DR,  was the owner of the Whistling Wizard inn located in Voonlar.\nRavvas was a snobbish young son of a wealthy family who felt he was privileged over others. He was thin and had a nasal voice that accentuated his arrogant nature. He was often disdainful or cruel to those he considered lower in status. He had a tendency to spend money frivolously.\nSometime after coming of age, Ravvass father got fed up with his wastrel of a son and sent him away from Selgaunt with a final gift of money and instructions to never come back. Ravvas found himself in Voonlar in the winter of the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR, around the date the owner of the Whistling Wizard inn, Ansilber Klauthaudra, was dismembered in the common room of his establishment. Within a tenday of the grisly murder, Ravvas bought the inn and took over running the Wizard.\nThe Harpers believed that Ravvas was killed and impersonated by an agent of the Red Wizards of Thay sometime after he left Selgaunt or soon after he bought the Whistling Wizard, which puts his actual death date in 1356 or 1357 DR. They also believed that this unnamed agent was himself assassinated and replaced by a malaugrym for purposes unknown. In any case, over the next few years the Whistling Wizard became a nexus for nefarious groups, such as the Red Wizards, the Cult of the Dragon, the Zhentarim, and the Tarntar, to meet and conduct business.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryInnkeeps\nCategoryInhabitants of the Whistling Wizard\nCategoryInhabitants of Voonlar\nCategoryInhabitants of the Moonsea\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Selgaunt\nCategoryMalaugrym\n6t0f1adjvmqe6afq5nd549pexlkv5yo"
