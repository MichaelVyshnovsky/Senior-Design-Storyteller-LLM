        "mainbody": "Sonya DellAnar was a human turned vampire of the 13 and 14 centuries DR.\nBefore Sonya became a vampire, she had a quarrel over a man with her cousin, which left them on bad terms. Wanting revenge, her cousin contacted an evil wizard who sent a vampire to kill Sonya but who instead turned her into one.\nSonya appeared as a lady in her thirties, but her age was masked by her vampirismâ€”by the mid-to-late 1300s DR, she was almost 150 years old.\nSonya would attack anyone who resembled her cousin.\nAs well as her vampiric nature, she was very intelligent."
