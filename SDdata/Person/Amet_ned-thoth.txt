'''Amet'ned-thoth''' was a wizard-priest of [[Thoth]] in [[Skullport]].

==Personality==
Amet'ned-thoth always dressed in the typical [[kalasiris]] of his home country. He disliked [[yuan-ti]] and other reptile races for their affinity with [[Set]].

==Possessions==
Amet possessed an ''[[amulet of life protection]]'', a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]] +2'', a ''[[ring of sustenance]]'', a ''[[scarab of protection]]'', and a ''[[wand of lightning]]''.

At all times he wore a stylized [[enchanted]] circlet that sported an [[ibis]] head crest. This unique circlet granted its wearer abilities similar to the [[spell]]s ''[[comprehend languages]]'' and ''[[read magic]]'', which aided him in representing foreign clients or those who couldn't speak [[Common]]. He also generally wore his ''ring of sustenance'' as he had a distaste for the local cuisine of Skullport and because he feared the possibility of being [[poison]]ed.

He never wore weapons openly and due to his faith he never dressed in armor.

==Relationship==
Amet had few true acquaintances, only the unusual [[illithid]] [[Sangalor]] and [[Silas Broon]], the owner of the [[Flagon and the Dragon]].

==History==
Around [[1370 DR]], Amet'ned-thoth acted as a lawyer-for-hire with the [[Hall of the Voice]] in front of the [[Skulls of Skullport]]. He always chose his clients very carefully before accepting a case, and for this he earned the ire of [[Zstulkk Ssarmn]] and other leaders of the [[Iron Ring]].
