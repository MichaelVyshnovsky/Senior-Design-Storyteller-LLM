Ametned-thoth was a wizard-priest of Thoth in Skullport.
Ametned-thoth always dressed in the typical kalasiris of his home country. He disliked yuan-ti and other reptile races for their affinity with Set.
Amet possessed an amulet of life protection, a pair of bracers of defense, a ring of protection +2, a ring of sustenance, a scarab of protection, and a wand of lightning.
At all times he wore a stylized enchanted circlet that sported an ibis head crest. This unique circlet granted its wearer abilities similar to the spells comprehend languages and read magic, which aided him in representing foreign clients or those who couldnt speak Common. He also generally wore his ring of sustenance as he had a distaste for the local cuisine of Skullport and because he feared the possibility of being poisoned.
He never wore weapons openly and due to his faith he never dressed in armor.
Amet had few true acquaintances, only the unusual illithid Sangalor and Silas Broon, the owner of the Flagon and the Dragon.
Around 1370 DR, Ametned-thoth acted as a lawyer-for-hire with the Hall of the Voice in front of the Skulls of Skullport. He always chose his clients very carefully before accepting a case, and for this he earned the ire of Zstulkk Ssarmn and other leaders of the Iron Ring.
