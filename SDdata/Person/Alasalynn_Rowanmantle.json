On Mirtul 27, Alusair toured Tilverton with her court mages Vangerdahast Aeiulvana and Caladnei, along with Lady Regent Rowanmantle and an elf from Evereska named Galaeron Nihmedu. As they came to believe Tilverton would be the first target of the Princes of Shade, Princess Alusair tasked the Lady Regent with the evacuation of her city.\nSoon after, Vangerdahast let loose a powerful magical weapon upon the shade army, which ultimately resulted in the complete destruction of Tilverton. In the aftermath of the disaster, it appeared as if Lady Rowanmantle had been quite successful in getting her people safely out the city."
