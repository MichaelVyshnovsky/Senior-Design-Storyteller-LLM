        "mainbody": "Lady Regent '''Alasalynn Rowanmantle''' was a skilled [[warrior]] and [[Purple Dragons|Purple Dragon]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], and served as the ruler of the [[Cormyr]]ean protectorate of [[Tilverton]] until the city's destruction in [[1372 DR]].\n\n{{Quote|You would sacrifice Tilverton?|The Lady Regent to Princess Alusair Obarsykr, [[Mirtul 27]] [[1372 DR]].}}",
        "Activities": "Lady Regent Rowanmantle was elected to her position as Lady of Tilverton by the city's council of citizens, which she took the leadership of.",
        "Relationships": "Alasalynn was the most prominent member of the [[Rowanmantle]] family and cousin of [[Shaerl Amcathra]].",
        "History": "Before becoming regent of the city, Alasalynn served as an officer within the [[Purple Dragons]].\n\nShortly after Cormyr's annexation of Tilverton in [[1357 DR]], she was elected as Lady Regent, replacing the brief, heavy-handed, and unpopular rule of Duke [[Bhereu Ammaeth]]. She proved to be a much more popular ruler of the protectorate.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Lady Alasalynn attended King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]'s birthday feast, hosted by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] at [[Thistleflame Keep]]. She was accompanied there by Lord [[Damaris Rowanmantle]].\n\nWhen the [[shade]]s of [[Thultanthar]] returned to [[Faerûn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, it became apparent to Princess [[Alusair Obarskyr]] that they were a threat to all of [[Cormyr]]. On [[Mirtul 27]], Alusair toured Tilverton with her court mages [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]] and [[Caladnei]], along with Lady Regent Rowanmantle and an [[elf]] from [[Evereska]] named [[Galaeron Nihmedu]]. As they came to believe Tilverton would be the first target of the [[Princes of Shade]], Princess Alusair tasked the Lady Regent with the evacuation of her city.\n\nSoon after, Vangerdahast let loose a powerful magical weapon upon the shade army, which ultimately resulted in the complete destruction of Tilverton. In the aftermath of the disaster, it appeared as if Lady Rowanmantle had been quite successful in getting her people safely out the city."
