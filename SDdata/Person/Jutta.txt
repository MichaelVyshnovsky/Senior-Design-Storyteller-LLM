'''Jutta''' was a young apprentice to [[Maligor]], the [[Zulkir]] of [[Alteration]] in [[Thay]] in midâ€“14{{th}} century DR.

==Description==
Jutta was a young, short, and stocky girl with a clean-shaven head. Maligor thought her round face to look like an overripe cantaloupe. Like her master, she was a worshiper of [[Myrkul]], which was evident from a holy symbol of the god tattooed on her head. She often wore rose-scented perfumes.

==Personality==
As an apprentice, she was respectful and subservient to Maligor. She was one of the most adept pupils that Maligor ever had. He respected her ruthlessness and intelligence, qualities valued in Thay.

==Abilities==
Intelligence and ambition were her main weapons, along with a selection of [[spell]]s taught to her by Maligor. He awarded her magic lessons for well-completed tasks.

==Possessions==
Jutta was in possession of her master's ''[[ring of flying]]''.

==Relationships==
She respected her master and was eager to please Maligor as a teacher and he, in turn, respected her, planning on replacing his assistant Asp with Jutta once he got bored of her. [[Asp (spirit naga)|Asp]], a [[spirit naga]] lieutenant, was jealous of his interest in the young apprentice.

==History==
Jutta came to Maligor's service in [[1361 DR]]. To guarantee her loyalty, Maligor abducted her parents and put them to work in the slave citrus plantations. If Jutta were to displease him, their deaths would be terrible.

In [[1362 DR]], she was tasked with scattering the remains of [[Willeth Lionson]] along the [[First Escarpment]], making sure none of Maligor's enemies would be able to commune with the dead man and discover the Zulkir's plans.
