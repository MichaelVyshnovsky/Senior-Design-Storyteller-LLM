        "mainbody": "'''Donzo Shadowkisser''' was a [[halfling]] [[rogue]] who worked with the [[Stag Runners]] [[adventurer]]s in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Donzo was an archetypal rogue, a consistent hypocrite, and an extraordinary cheat and sneak.",
        "Possessions": "Donzo was equipped with a magical suit of ''+3 [[leather armor]]'' and a magical ''+2 [[dagger]]''. His tools of the trade included a ''[[bag of tricks]]'' and a small ''[[bag of holding]]''.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], Donzo and the other [[Stag Runners]] attended a royal party at [[Thistleflame Keep]]. [[Mendryll Belarod]] performed an insulting and bawdy song that targeted Sembites, provoking the Stag Runners into avenging their honor. The Stag Runners attacked Mendryll, but were defeated with the aid of another party of adventurers. The same night, the Stag Runners were also implicated in the murder of [[Partic Thistle]] by the [[Emerald Swords]] adventuring company."
