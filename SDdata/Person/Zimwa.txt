Zimwa was one of the barae, paladin of Ubtao from Mezro in Chult.
Zimwa became one of the chosen on Ubtao, tasked with defending the ancient city of Mezro centuries before 1372 DR, alongside Tabiaza, Anzi, Ras Nsi, and many others. Eventually, Zimwa died defending the hidden city and, like all fallen barae, was immortalized inside the Temple of Ubtao in Mezro, with a statue of polished black stone.
In 1372 DR, Artus Cimber read about Zimwa and other bare in the The Eternal Life of Mezro and saw the statue dedicated to them in temples Hall of Champions.
