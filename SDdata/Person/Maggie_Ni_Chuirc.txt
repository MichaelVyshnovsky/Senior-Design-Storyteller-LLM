'''Maggie Ni Chuirc''', sister to [[Aideen Ni Chuirc]], was a member of the [[Dead Eyes]], a criminal group from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] that named itself for the grim trophies they collected from the enemies in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Maggie was a [[human]] woman with a light skin. She wore a [[helmet]] and a set of mundane [[chainmail]] [[armor]]. In battle, the wielded a [[spear]] and a [[tower shield]] adorned with the insignia of the [[Flaming Fist]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Dead Eyes set out to perform a job that would end up setting the gang against [[the Guild]] and its leader, [[Ninefingers]]. Maggie's sister, Aideen, worked with a local criminal not affiliated with the Guild, [[Brinks]], to pull the heist off. The Guild did not take competition lightly and sent thugs to take care of the Dead Eyes. Her band survived and relocated to a new lair. Unbeknownst to Aideen, one of her men was a traitor. [[Bard]] [[Hiero Lue]] uncovered the secret stash where Aideen hid the loot, including the Guild's [[coin]], and sent a note to Ninefingers, informing the Guild of the Dead Eyes' lair and the hidden stash's location. The hiding spot was unknown to even Aideen's own sister, which made Maggie furious when she discovered the bard found out her sister's secret. Maggie wanted to kill the bard but reported him to Aideen, who, in turn, stated that once the job was done, she would end Hiero Lue herself. Maggie did not like the idea of keeping the bard alive that long but conceded that her sister knew better as the group's leader. It was unknown if Maggie and the Dead Eyes survived an attack from the Guild or other eager adventurers of Baldur's Gate.
