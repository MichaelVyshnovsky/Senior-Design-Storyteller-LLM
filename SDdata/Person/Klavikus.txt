'''Klavikus''' was a [[glabrezu]] in the service of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in [[Vaasa]] in [[1359 DR]].

==Personality==
Klavikus wanted to rule the Abyss, and he was mighty and shrewd enough that Orcus himself tricked him into servitude to curb his ambitions. He preferred to enter fights with overwhelming odds on his side.

He loved reading and could be bribed with a good book.

==History==
Klavikus was a powerful and ambitious [[demon]] at the court of the [[demon lord]] [[Orcus]]. Sensing him a threat, Orcus sent him to fulfill trivial duties on the [[Prime Material plane]] for 500 years starting in the {{YearlinkName|971}}. As of the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, with 112 years to go, [[Orcus]] himself had commanded Klavikus to guard the interior of [[Castle Perilous]].

Klavikus used all his centuries of servitude to Zhengyi to read all the books in the [[lich]]'s library. At some point, he started to send some of the tomes he had finished reading to his original house in the [[Abyss]].
