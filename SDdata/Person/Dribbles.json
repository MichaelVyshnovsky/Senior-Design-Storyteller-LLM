        "mainbody": "'''Dribbles''' (a.k.a. '''Norris Greenie'''), known as the '''Master of Puns and Punchlines''', was a clown and entertainer who worked at the [[Circus of the Last Days]], which travelled across the various [[planes of existence]]. He continued his act until late 15{{th}} century of the [[Calendar of Harptos|Faer√ªnian calendar]], when the circus traveled to [[Toril]] on the [[Prime Material plane]], when he was ceremoniously slain by [[Bhaalist]] murders and the remains of his body were scattered across the breadth of [[Baldur's Gate]].\n\n{{Quote|Now, I always tell children that they're special. That each and every one of them is unique. Tell me - what makes ''you'' special?|[[Fumm|\"Dribbles\"]], to a special member of his audience.}}",
        "Description": "Dribbles dressed in outlandish, fool's motley befitting his role in the circus. He painted his face white, with whimsical makeup, and dyed his hair a vibrant shade of pink. Dribbles wore a ring with a grinning face on his left hand.",
        "Possessions": "He wielded the ''[[clown hammer]]'', an [[item enchantment|enchanted]] maul that could incite fits of laughter in anyone it struck.",
        "Activities": "[[File:Killer clown dribbles.png|thumb|''A killer clown from subterrenian space.''|380x380px]]\nDribbles' act included the recitation of strained puns, animal-charming, and \"magic tricks\" involving members of his audience. Mass murders were notably not a part of his usual performances. The clown was absolutely adored by fans from across the planes, people that were counted among myriad races and faiths throughout.",
        "Relationships": "He performed his act with the assistance of [[Buddy|Bitey Buddy]], a particularly fearsome looking [[blink dog]].",
        "History": "{{quote|''Just give the word, and I will kill the clown. We would be praised as heroes.''|[[Minthara Baenre]]<ref name=\"bg3\" >}}<br />\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Dribbles was slain when the Circus of Last Days visited the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] on the planet of [[Toril]]. Dribbles was replaced by a [[doppelganger]] named [[Fumm]], who appeared to be loyal to the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. Dribbles' body was rendered piece by piece, and scattered across the city. Some limbs or portions of his body were found at the sites of other grisly murders.\n\nThe perpetrators of those were murders were followers of the false [[Chosen]] of [[Bhaal]], [[Orin]] the Red. It was not Orin's associates among the Absolutists that were responsible for Dribbles' death, rather aspiring murders who wished to prove loyalty to the [[Dread Lord's Tribunal]] in the Baldurian [[Undercity]]."
