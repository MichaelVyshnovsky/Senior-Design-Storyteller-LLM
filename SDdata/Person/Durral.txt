Durral was a half-orc who worked as a guard and bouncer at the Knight n Shadow tavern in Waterdeep as of the .
He was a brute, and his most distinguishing features were his spellscarred hands.
Durrals spellscar augmented his fists with magical force, allowing him to throw powerful punches that could instantly knock his opponents off their feet. With some effort, he was able to deliver such a thunderous blow that the force of it could knock down multiple people at once.
As a bouncer, Durral was responsible for subduing bothersome patrons or intruders&mdashnonlethally if possible Additionally, he and a group of seven human guards protected the  pit that led between the taverns lower level (called "Shadow") and Downshadow in Undermountain.
Durral was personally responsible for manning the rope-operated lift that lowered folk into Downshadow. He charged 5 gold dragons per person per trip&mdashwhich was not included in the 25 gold bribe that most visitors to Downshadow had to pay just to reach him from the "Knight" section of the tavern upstairs He strictly disallowed anyone from attempting to climb down for free.
Although it was not widely known, Durral also helped to smuggle people out of Downshadow.
Durral had caught and locked-up one particular gnome pickpocket so frequently that the thief came to be known by the nickname "Stockade".
