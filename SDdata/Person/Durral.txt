'''Durral''' was a [[half-orc]] who worked as a guard and bouncer at the [[Knight 'n' Shadow]] tavern in [[Waterdeep]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.

==Description==
He was a brute, and his most distinguishing features were his [[spellscarred]] hands.

==Abilities==
Durral's spellscar augmented his fists with [[magical]] force, allowing him to throw powerful punches that could instantly knock his opponents off their feet. With some effort, he was able to deliver such a thunderous blow that the force of it could knock down multiple people at once.

==Activities==
As a bouncer, Durral was responsible for subduing bothersome patrons or intruders&mdash;nonlethally if possible{{Cite dungeon/204/What's up in Downshadow|4}} Additionally, he and a group of seven [[human]] guards protected the {{SIAdj|50|foot|long=yes}} pit that led between the tavern's lower level (called "Shadow") and [[Downshadow]] in [[Undermountain]].

Durral was personally responsible for manning the rope-operated lift that lowered folk into Downshadow. He charged 5 [[dragon (coin)|gold dragons]] per person per trip&mdash;which was not included in the 25 gold bribe that most visitors to Downshadow had to pay just to reach him from the "Knight" section of the tavern upstairs{{Cite organized play/LFR/Out of Hatred|19}} He strictly disallowed anyone from attempting to climb down for free.

Although it was not widely known, Durral also helped to smuggle people out of Downshadow.{{Cite dungeon/204/What's up in Downshadow|6}}

==Relationships==
Durral had caught and locked-up one particular [[gnome]] pickpocket so frequently that the thief came to be known by the nickname "[[Stockade]]".
