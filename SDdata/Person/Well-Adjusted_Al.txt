'''Well-Adjusted Al''', previously known as '''Crazy Al''', was an eccentric shopkeep who operated [[Well-Adjusted Al's General Store]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''I used to be called "Crazy Al," but therapy has convinced me that selling plate armor for three gold pieces and a small duck was no way to get ahead in business.''|Well-Adjusted Al}}

==Description==
Al was a portly dark-skinned [[human]] male who wore flashy aquamarine clothes and tan pants.

==Possessions==
Well-Adjusted Al's General Store stood across the street from the [[Low Lantern]] [[festhall]], to the east from the ship,The in-game map of Baldur's Gate is not accurate to the city's maps published in sourcebooks. This article uses the Low Lantern festhall to determine its location: on Stormshore Street, across the street from it. His establishment dealt in general goods and carried mundane [[bow]]s, [[arrows]], [[throwing axe]]s, [[dart]]s, [[sling]]s, [[bullet]]s, [[crossbow]]s, [[bolt]]s, and [[throwing knives]]. Al also offered magic item identification service for 100 [[gold]] [[coin]]s.

==History==
Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Al had a reputation for offering his goods for insanely low prices, such as a set of [[plate mail]] that regularly could cost hundreds of [[gold]] pieces, for the price of mere three coins and a [[duck]]. However, this insanity was cured in therapy, after which the merchant became known as Well-Adjusted Al.
