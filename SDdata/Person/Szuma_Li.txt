Szuma Li was a bushido warrior from Chondath.
Szuma Li joined the army of Khan Kertep in 1354 DR because the khan appeared to be chosen by a god and because all his predictions were proved true. However, when in 1358 DR, Kerteps army marched upon the city of Hlath in Chondath, Szuma Li happened to see the khan transforming himself into a horrible jackal-faced demon. Totally shocked, he deserted and escaped. Szuma decided to ally with the defenders of Hlath, telling them all he knew about Kerteps tactics before helping defend the city.
