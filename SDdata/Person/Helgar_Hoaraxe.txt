Helgar Hoaraxe was the head carpenter in Skullport and owned The Draglines.
Once a sailor, Helgar settled in Skullport around 1340 DR, starting a new career in repairing and refitting damaged ships that arrived in the port. In times of slow work, he and his squad could be hired by captains as on-board carpenters or sailmasters.
