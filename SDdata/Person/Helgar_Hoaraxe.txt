'''Helgar Hoaraxe''' was the head carpenter in [[Skullport]] and owned [[Draglines|The Draglines]].

Once a sailor, Helgar settled in Skullport around [[1340 DR]], starting a new career in repairing and refitting damaged ships that arrived in the port. In times of slow work, he and his squad could be hired by captains as on-board carpenters or sailmasters.
