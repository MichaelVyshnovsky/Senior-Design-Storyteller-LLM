        "mainbody": "'''Shar-Teel''' was a [[human]] [[fighter]] from [[Baldur's Gate]] who traveled the [[Sword Coast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{Quote|Steel is the only thing that a woman can depend on.|Shar-Teel}}",
        "Personality": "Extremely aggressive and bloodthirsty, Shar-Teel had a strong hatred of men. She enjoyed humiliating male adventurers by challenging them to duels and soundly thrashing them.\n\nShe also had a particular dislike for the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenary company.",
        "Relationships": "Shar-Teel was the daughter of [[Angelo Dosan]], a lieutenant in the Flaming Fist who was secretly employed by [[Sarevok Anchev]].",
        "History": "Although not much was known about it, Shar-Teel's childhood that was less than ideal. Although it was not the case, she gave the impression that she grew up an orphan.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Shar-Teel spent some time traveling through the [[Sword Coast]], just south of the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]].\n\nSome time that year or next, Shar-Teel formulated a scheme with the devious [[spellcaster]] [[Eldoth Kron]]. The two took a job with a few other adventurers escorting a bride-to-be and her dowry south from the Sword Coast to the nation of [[Amn]]. Among this group were the [[paladin]] of [[Helm]], [[Ajantis]], the [[ranger]] [[Kivan]], and the megalomaniacal [[priest]] [[Tiax]]. After their caravan was ambushed by [[hobgoblin]]s and [[ogre]]s, Eldoth took the dowry and retreated to the [[Undercellar]] in [[Baldur's Gate]]. In fact Shar-Teel manipulated Ajantis into searching for Eldoth and killing him. She left Ajantis with a sack full of mere [[currency|copper coins]], while she rode off with the rest of the bride's substantial dowry.{{Cite comic/Baldur's Gate}}"
