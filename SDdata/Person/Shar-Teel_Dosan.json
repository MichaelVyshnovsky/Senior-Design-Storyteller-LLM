She enjoyed humiliating male adventurers by challenging them to duels and soundly thrashing them.\nShe also had a particular dislike for the Flaming Fist mercenary company.\nShar-Teel was the daughter of Angelo Dosan, a lieutenant in the Flaming Fist who was secretly employed by Sarevok Anchev.\nAlthough not much was known about it, Shar-Teels childhood that was less than ideal. Although it was not the case, she gave the impression that she grew up an orphan.\nIn the , Shar-Teel spent some time traveling through the Sword Coast, just south of the Wood of Sharp Teeth.\nSome time that year or next, Shar-Teel formulated a scheme with the devious spellcaster Eldoth Kron. The two took a job with a few other adventurers escorting a bride-to-be and her dowry south from the Sword Coast to the nation of Amn. Among this group were the paladin of Helm, Ajantis, the ranger Kivan, and the megalomaniacal priest Tiax. After their caravan was ambushed by hobgoblins and ogres, Eldoth took the dowry and retreated to the Undercellar in Baldurs Gate. In fact Shar-Teel manipulated Ajantis into searching for Eldoth and killing him. She left Ajantis with a sack full of mere copper coins, while she rode off with the rest of the brides substantial dowry."
