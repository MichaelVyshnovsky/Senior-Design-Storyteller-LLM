He was interested in Ilva.\nIn 1491 DR, Sebastian fell in love with Ilva, a girl who worked in a bar. She introduced him to meetings held by a strange dwarf prophet. Believing Ilva to be totally inappropriate for a Blades son, Blazen confronted Sebastian, urging him to break off the relationship but instead he ran away from home. An adventuring party hired by Count Stoe eventually saved him from a strange flame at the meeting room."
