'''Nrakk''' was a [[githzerai]] [[monk]] active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was greenish-yellow of complexion and was entirely bald save for a long braid of dark hair, and long tufts of facial hair on each side of his jaw. Nrakk wore maroon and blue clothing, and a thick [[scarf (clothing)|scarf]] around his neck to ward off the cold.

==Personality==
Nrakk struggled to interact with other people, particularly those he viewed as his lessers. He appeared reserved and aloof. He felt [[Toril]] was a chilly and unpleasant place.

==Abilities==
As a [[kensei]] monk, Nrakk was exceptionally skilled with his [[naginata]].

==Possessions==
Nrakk was outfitted in several magical items. His magical naginata was enchanted to be harmful to [[mind flayer]]s, and he carried an ''[[alchemy jug]]'' with him at all times. An ''[[ioun stone]]'' orbited his head.

==History==
Nrakk was dispatched by the Great Githzerai, [[Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith]], to aid an adventuring party on the [[Prime Material plane]]. Though his motivations seemed unclear, he always stayed true to the party's cause.
