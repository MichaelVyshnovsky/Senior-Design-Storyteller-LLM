        "mainbody": "'''Ramu''' was a [[hunting spider katanga]] archer, and the best sharpshooter who served the [[Mother of a Thousand Young]] within the [[Fire Mountain]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "Like other hunting spider katanga, Ramu possessed a [[poison|venomous]] bite and could easily scale any surface. He was a capable escape artist and a dextrous foe. Ramu was considered to be the best archer among spider katanga of the Fire Mountain.",
        "Possessions": "The creature was armed with bone [[dagger]]s, his [[enchanted]] hand-carved ''[[mighty shortbow]]'', and bone-tipped [[arrow]]s.",
        "History": "In the Year of Tigers Curse, Malatran calendar, late 14{{th}} century DR, the [[Wise Ones]] tribe became aware of an old foe resurfacing. The leader of evil [[spider katanga]], the Mother of a Thousand Young, was ready to birth an army of thousand ravenous younglings. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly [[poison]]s into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Ramu was stationed within the katanga's web room, alongside [[Taru]]. The room was draped in thick spiderwebs with desiccated bodies of small animals tangled up in them as well as immature spider katanga and ordinary spider young.\n\nIt was unknown if Ramu survived the confrontation with a group of heroes of the Living Jungle when they infiltrated the katanga caves. However, it was possible Ramu escaped death as he preferred to stay out of sight of enemies, shrouded in darkness."
