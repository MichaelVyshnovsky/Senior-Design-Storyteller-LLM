'''Jhassala Lyrimmjakh''' was a shipbuilder and a slaver hunter from the city of [[Nimpeth]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Jhassala was a descendant of slaves in Nimpeth, being only second generation free of bondage.

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Jhassala Lyrimmjakh was known for two things, her shipbuilding business and being a passionate hunter ad assassin who ended the lives of any slave-traders that crossed her path. Her ships were slender and fast coastal [[raker]]s, made for speed and stealth. They could not carry heavy artillery and had minimal comforts for the dialers and passengers. Jhassala's rakers were painted dark colors and were beautiful to behold. The low-laying vessels were perfectly designed to weather storms.
