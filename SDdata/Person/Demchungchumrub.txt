'''Demchungchumrub''' was a [[lich]] [[conjurer]] who inhabited the [[Many-Windowed Tower]] on the shore of the [[Yal Tengri]] in the [[Hordelands]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
He apparently took over the Many-Windowed Tower in the 11{{th}} century DR, when passing nomads noticed the lighthouse restored and wisely avoided it ever since. At first, ships sailing along the coast of the Great Ice Sea were wrecked by misleading lights on the tower, and when sailors learned to distrust it, they were beset by fogs, mutinies, attacking [[elemental]]s, and confusion and disorientation.

==Activities==
Although a loner,  he lich was using his magical arts to wreck passing ships in order to capture their sailors. Those who survived, Demchungchumrub ''[[charm person|charmed]]'' to serve him, and those who were killed, he simply animated as [[undead]]. His goal was to crew his [[spelljammer]] ship, a converted great [[galley]] known as ''[[Delras]]''. As of [[1358 DR]], his crew was near completion.

==Abilities==
He was specialized in the [[conjuration]] [[school of magic]], and incapable of both the [[invocation]]/[[evocation]] and greater [[divination]] schools. He prepared an array [[spells]] useful for waylaying and wrecking ships, charming the living and animating and controlling the dead.
