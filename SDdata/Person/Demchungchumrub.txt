Demchungchumrub was a lich conjurer who inhabited the Many-Windowed Tower on the shore of the Yal Tengri in the Hordelands in the midâ€“14 century DR.
He apparently took over the Many-Windowed Tower in the 11 century DR, when passing nomads noticed the lighthouse restored and wisely avoided it ever since. At first, ships sailing along the coast of the Great Ice Sea were wrecked by misleading lights on the tower, and when sailors learned to distrust it, they were beset by fogs, mutinies, attacking elementals, and confusion and disorientation.
Although a loner,  he lich was using his magical arts to wreck passing ships in order to capture their sailors. Those who survived, Demchungchumrub charmed to serve him, and those who were killed, he simply animated as undead. His goal was to crew his spelljammer ship, a converted great galley known as Delras. As of 1358 DR, his crew was near completion.
He was specialized in the conjuration school of magic, and incapable of both the invocation/evocation and greater divination schools. He prepared an array spells useful for waylaying and wrecking ships, charming the living and animating and controlling the dead.
