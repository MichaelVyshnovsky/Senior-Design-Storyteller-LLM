Varlamar was a caravan guard in the Sword Coast during the midâ€“14 century DR.
After one damaging ambush early in a trip between Scornubel and Waterdeep, Orthil Voldovan called for Varlamar to light up the braziers at night. He had to call for him to do it again shortly after, as Varlammar had yet to light those braziers.
