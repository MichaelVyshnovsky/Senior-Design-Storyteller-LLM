The Masked Minstrel was a famed but mysterious bard in Waterdeep.
The Masked Minstrel, as her name implied, only appeared in public while wearing a mask to conceal her identity. She was also a "lady of the evening" who entertained clients in the woods of Mount Waterdeep. Rumors said that she was an agent of the Harpers or a spy.
The Masked Minstrel had a lovely voice and played the harp, lyre, and lute.
