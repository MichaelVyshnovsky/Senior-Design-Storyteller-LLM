'''The Masked Minstrel''' was a famed but mysterious [[bard]] in [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
The Masked Minstrel, as her name implied, only appeared in public while wearing a [[mask (object)|mask]] to conceal her identity. She was also a "lady of the evening" who entertained clients in the woods of [[Mount Waterdeep]]. Rumors said that she was an agent of the [[Harpers]] or a spy.

==Skills==
The Masked Minstrel had a lovely voice and played the [[harp]], [[lyre]], and [[lute]].
