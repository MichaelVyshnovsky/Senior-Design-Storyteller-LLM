'''Shanyrria Alenuath''' was a [[bladesinger]] of the [[Alenuath]] clan in [[Evermeet]] in [[1367 DR]].
  
==Activities==
A talented bladesinger, Shanyrria was often in [[Faer√ªn]] to help scattered groups of elves or to fight enemies like the [[Church of Cyric]] or [[Zhentil Keep]]. Often, she was in [[Evereska]].

==History== 
During [[Nimesin's War]] in [[1371 DR]], Shanyrria went to [[Sunrise Tower]] to gather the bladesingers and fight the invading monstrous army of [[Kymil Nimesin]]. However, arriving at the Tower, she found the place under the control of [[sun elf]] traitors who were followers of Kymil. Shanyrria attacked the group alone with the objective of killing as many enemies as possible before dying and going with honor to [[Arvandor]].
