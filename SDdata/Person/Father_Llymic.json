        "mainbody": "Father Llymic was an alien entity and an elder evil.\nIn the time of Myth Drannor, a group of high elves adept in High Magic opened a gate to the Far Realm, seeking knowledge. What they got was the creature known as Father Llymic. Averting catastrophe, they imprisoned Father Llymics body in the Thunder Peaks, where he waited for darkness to bring him freedom.\nWhen it came, travelers crossing the Thunder Gap, which ran near Llymics prison, would be the first to notice something wrong and run afoul of his brood spawn. When he awoke, they would threaten all Cormyr, the Dalelands, and Sembia. Worse, a splinter sect of the church of Shar known as the Black Ice endeavored to free Father Llymic for Shars dark glory. They camped close to his prison, seeking to release him, while some were transformed.\nHe was trapped in an icy prison, awaiting a time when the world would be right for his coming. If he was released from his prison, the world would be covered with a glacier, removing all light and hope from the world forever.\nWorshipers were drawn to Father Llymics glacial tomb, where they eventually became infected with brood fever and became brood spawn.\nFather Llymics presence first became known when the days became shorter. As time passed, lights generated by magical or natural means were dimmed, and darkness generated by magical means was stronger. Eventually, the sun vanished altogether and magical light was impossible to generate."
