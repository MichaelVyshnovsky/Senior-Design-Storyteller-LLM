'''Shenandra''' was a [[Netherese]] [[archwizard]] who lived during the [[Shadowed Age]].

==History==
This skilled archwizard lived in [[Shadowtop Borough]] at the same time as the fellow archwizard, [[Shadelorn]]. Shenandra attempted to counteract the [[phaerimm]]s' attempt to deprive the land of nourishment and [[magic]]. She met several failures when trying to develop this counter [[spell]], but she finally developed one in {{YearlinkConvert|3517|NY}}. 

Shenandra cast the spell to negate the magic of the phaerimm, but the [[evil]] ''[[Crown of Horns]]'' corrupted her colleague's work at the same time. As this happened, the legendary crown absorbed all magical items and spell effects on the enclave, and it came crashing to the ground.
