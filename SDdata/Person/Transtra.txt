'''Transtra''' was one of the leaders of the [[Iron Ring]] and a slaver of [[Skullport]] around [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Transtra was a powerful crime lord and slaver in Skullport who associated herself with the Iron Ring Consortium. Very few knew about her true nature as a [[lamia noble]], as she used many disguises and illusions. Very secretly&mdash;and under a ''[[geas]]'' effect&mdash;she was being tutored in the magical arts by [[Halaster]] himself.

==Relationship==
Transtra's only companion was her pet [[behir]] [[Uliss]], that she had come across in Undermountain and charmed to obey her.

She was also a business associate of, and informant for, [[Mirt]] the Moneylender. 

==Business==
Transtra was the owner of the [[House of the Long Slow Kiss]], a 4-story festhall in Skullport. She also owned at least one warehouse, and had business dealings in smuggling, gambling, thievery, slavery, and moneylending. She was also known to hire adventurers to investigate rumors in [[Undermountain]].
