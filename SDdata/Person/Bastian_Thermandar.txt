Bastian Thermandar was the second-in-command of the Cult of the Eternal Flame at the Temple of the Eternal Flame in Tyar-Besil in the late 1490s DR.
Bastian was a very paranoid individual, not trusting anyone.
Bastian learned much of his elemental magic from Vanifer herself. In 1491 DR, Bastian was responsible for guarding the northern half of the temple.
