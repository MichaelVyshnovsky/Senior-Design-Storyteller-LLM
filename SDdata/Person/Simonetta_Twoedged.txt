'''Warden Simonetta Twoedged''' was a leader of [[Waterdeep]]'s [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Simonetta was a skilled tactician and had an exceptionally keen mind towards strategy.

She was a proponent of learning as much as she could about both her foes and those she fought alongside.

==History==
When Simonetta was just 18 years old, she joined Waterdeep's City Guard. She served her city for over three decades, eventually rising to the rank of Warden of Waterdeep. For her service, she was awarded the Waterdhavian medal of valor.

By the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Simonetta was retired for a number of years. When [[War of the Shining Crusade|war]] broke out that year and the [[Shining Crusade]] threatened the security of the [[Sword Coast]], she decided to join up with the [[Coalition]] as a military advisor.
