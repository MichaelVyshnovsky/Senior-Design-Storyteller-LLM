Hun-kho was a legendary war chief of the Kalmyr tribe in the Hordelands.
Hun-kho was a great conqueror of the steppe nomads, reaching as far as the Dragonwall to the east.
Hun-kho was not buried within Ejen Horo like many other great leaders of the nomads. Instead, his splendid noble tomb was buried somewhere beneath the vast steppe. All who knew of its location were slain upon its completion.
