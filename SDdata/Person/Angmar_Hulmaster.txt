'''Angmar Hulmaster''', also remembered as '''Angar Hulmaster''',<ref group="note">The short story, ''[[Realms of the Dead|The King in Copper]]'', effectively confirms that "Angar Hulmaster," as described in the ''[[Blades of the Moonsea]]'' trilogy, is the same individual as "Angmar Hulmaster" as described in ''[[The Moonsea (accessory)|The Moonsea]]'' accessory. In addition to being active during the same timeframes and having names which are only one letter off, both have Argyl Hulmaster stated to be their father. was a ruler of [[Hulburg]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Angmar's appearance had been likened to "a [[horse]]'s posterior."

==Personality==
In his youth, Angmar was aimless, bored, and boring. However, he did find amusement in his father's increasing desperation over the plight of the family.

==Relationships==
Through his twenties, Angmar lived with his father, [[Argyl Hulmaster]], and two siblings, [[Luren Hulmaster|Luren]] and [[Amali Hulmaster]].

Angmar became one of the most celebrated figures of the [[Hulmaster]] family in the decades following his death. He had a son named [[Lendon Hulmaster|Lendon]], and was the great-grandfather of [[Geran Hulmaster|Geran]] and [[Kara Hulmaster]].

==History==
Angmar grew up in the Hulmaster ancestral home of [[Hulmaster Keep]] in the ruins of Hulburg, As the family's fortune began to dwindle, his father began desperately trying to match Angmar and his siblings with potential marriage partners. By the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, his father was becoming increasingly unhinged, and would try to force even vaguely young, attractive, or wealthy individuals into marrying into the Hulmaster family. Angmar would go on to marry Estine, the daughter of a Thentian family which had fallen on similarly hard times as the Hulmasters.

Angmar had become harmach of Hulburg by the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, when the [[Red Plumes]] arrived in Hulburg, having been driven out of [[Hillsfar]]. Their leaders, [[Hekman Odelmor]] and [[Kindon Marstel]], claimed ownership over any and all treasures hidden within the ruins of Hulburg, and for almost a year they pillaged the area and forced Angmar to provide them with food and drink. On the [[Ches 16|sixteenth]] of [[Ches]] in the {{YearlinkName|1376}}, the band forced Angmar to lead them to the crypt of the Hulmaster family beneath [[Hammerbold Abbey]] so they could raid the tombs. and swore an oath that in exchange for the lich's protection of his family and city, Angmar would wield the laws of Hulburg to make sure that the various crypts and barrows of the surrounding [[Highfells]] would remain unspoiled and the sole domain of Aesperus. The lich slew the leaders of the Red Plumes, and Angmar took charge of the remaining mercenaries and their families.

After this, Angmar began rebuilding the city of Hulburg. He built the mighty fortress of [[Griffonwatch Keep]] to defend the city, He and his son, Lendon, became known for their efforts to repel orc raiders from [[Thar]].

As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, [[Angar's Square]] in the heart of rebuilt Hulburg had been named in his honor.
