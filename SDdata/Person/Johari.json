        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Johari tried to enter the [[Tower District]] in order to help in the city's fight against the occupying [[Many-Arrows]] [[orc]]s. However, Patrol Captain [[Lanward]] of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] was preventing half-orcs passing the [[Fallen Tower]] area out of fear they would join the other side. Johari was incensed by this and the two argued. She sought out a half-orc adventurer and Guard recruit to speak to Lanward and allow their kind into the rest of the district."
