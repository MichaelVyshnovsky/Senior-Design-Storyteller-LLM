'''Abelar Corrinthal''' was a holy warrior of [[Lathander]] of [[Sembia]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Though he later fell from grace, in the end he regained his faith.

==Relationships==
Abelar's son [[Elden Corrinthal]] became a [[cleric]] of [[Amaunator]] and the head priest of the [[Abbey of the Rose]]. Abelar was first taught about Lathander by the old family priest [[Mriistin]]. 

==History==
In his youth, Abelar was an adventurer but later he went to serve his father [[Endren Corrinthal]], the lord of [[Saerb]].

He was once a member of the [[Order of the Aster]] but was dismissed because Abelar disagreed with the truth of the [[Risen Sun heresy]].

When in the {{YearlinkName|1374}} he heard about the sack of [[Corrinthal Estate]] and the abduction of his son, Abelar blamed his god. In desperation, Abelar asked the help of [[Erevis Cale]] and [[Drasek Riven]] to save his son and had his vengeance upon [[Malkur Forrin]], but in killing the cruel mercenary he lost his faith.

Afterward, Abelar led the refugees of Saerb to [[Daerlun]] but the rising of the [[Shadowstorm]] ruined his plan. He decided to assist Cale, Riven, and even [[Rivalen Tanthul]] in the battle against [[Kesson Rel]] and in the battle against the [[shadow]]s he regained the benevolence of Lathander.

In later stages of the [[Twilight War]] Corrinthal commanded troops and faced off against against [[Zeeahd]] and [[Sayeed]], two agents of [[Mephistopheles]]. His troops removed the thumbs of their fighting hands.
