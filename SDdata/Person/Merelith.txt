Lady '''Merelith''' was the ruler of [[Saerloon]] in [[Sembia]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
In truth ruling as a figurehead of the city, Merelith answered to a council of wealthy and powerful merchants who really ruled ''circa'' {{Yearlink|1358}}. Merelith was also the high captain of the City Guard of Saerloon.

==History==
During the [[Twilight War]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Merelith sided with Overmistress [[Mirabeta Selkirk]] and offered her support against the rebels of [[Selgaunt]] and [[Saerb]]. On [[Uktar 21]], Mirabeta sent the disguised [[green dragon]] [[Vendemniharan]] to serve under Merelith with orders to lead an army against Selgaunt. On [[Uktar 29]], under Mirabeta orders, Merelith used a ''[[teleportation circle]]'' to transport her army to just outside Selgaunt in order to attack and take it by surprise. 

After the total defeat of her troops during the [[Battle of Selgaunt]] and the [[Shadowstorm]] consumed [[Ordulin]], Merelith offered her surrender to [[Thamalon Uskevren II]]. On the advice of [[Rivalen Tanthul]], he accepted peace with Saerloon but only after Merelith and her court abdicated.
