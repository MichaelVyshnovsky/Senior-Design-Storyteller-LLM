'''Norry Waywocket''' was a [[rock gnome]] [[sorcerer]] and a smuggler in [[Cormyr]] in the early 1370s [[DR]]. He was partner to [[Coobert Draftworth]].

==Activities==
Norry and Coobert carried on a profitable trade in smuggling stolen goods across Cormyr and fencing them to certain merchants returning to [[Sembia]] on the [[Way of the Manticore]]. Living out of [[Monksblade]] in Cormyr, they stored their illicit goods in the [[Tomb of Chonis]], their favorite drop-site. They seemed to specialize in small, easy-to-carry treasures, such as jewelry, liqueurs and wines, silks, and fine clothing.

As cover their activities, they claimed to be small-time merchants and acted as urbane and amiable gentlemen, and said they lived in [[Immersea]]. If pressed, they claimed they only used the tomb as a warehouse.

Norry Waywocket and Coobert Draftworth were constant companions and old friends, and always worked together. So close were they that they finished each other's sentences and accurately anticipated whatever the other needed. Always talking together, they could lie easily about what they did. They even claimed to think alike.

==History==
Norry Waywocket originally hailed from the [[Dalelands]]. Joining Coobert Draftworth, he became a smuggler and fence operating across Cormyr.

In early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Norry and Coobert had a load of stolen jewelry (including a signet ring of the [[Wyvernspur (house)|Wyvernspur]] noble family) when they went to the Tomb of Chonis to pick up their stash accumulated over the last three months (including bottles of [[utterdark]] wine and royal attire). However, they discovered [[dark one|others]] lurking in the tomb. After spying for a while, Norry and Coobert instead camped at the nearby [[Unknown Shrine]] while they thought about what to do about it. They'd only been there a day when adventurers investigating the [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]] may have encountered and questioned them.

==Equipment==
He was well dressed. In addition to two [[dagger]]s, Norry owned a ''[[ring of protection]] +1'' and ''[[cloak of resistance]] +1'', and carried [[potion]]s of ''[[barkskin]]'' and ''[[blur]]'' and [[wand]]s of ''[[mage armor]]'' and ''[[shield (spell)|shield]]''. He rode a [[pony]].
