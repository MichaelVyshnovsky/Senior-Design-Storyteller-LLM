'''Byldrath''' was a middle class inhabitant of the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''I guess it makes things easier for them if I drop dead.''|Byldrath}}

==Description==
Byldrath was an [[elf]]in male with pale skin, strong jaw, light brown eyes, and black hair, gathered in a severe bun. He wore clothes of quality make.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, the gates between the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate and its more affluent [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] were closed, monitored by the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries and allowing only the wealthy and current residents of the Upper City through. Byldrath was among those Baldurians who sought entrance into the Upper City. He felt frustrated with being forced to wait in a long queue in hot sun all day.
