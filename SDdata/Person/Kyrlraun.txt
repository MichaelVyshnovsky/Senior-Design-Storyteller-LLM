Kyrlraun was a paladin of Ilmater and a leading member of the Lords of Imphras II of Impiltur during the mid-14 century DR.
He was in effect the true ruler of Impiltur because the Queen-Regent Sambryl always sought Kyrlrauns advice regarding state affairs. Kyrlrauns gravest concern regarded the situation developing in Damara around the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR.
Kyrlraun possessed great tolerance and had grounded understanding of the common people.
