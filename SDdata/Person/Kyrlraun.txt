'''Kyrlraun''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Ilmater]] and a leading member of the [[Lords of Imphras II]] of [[Impiltur]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

He was in effect the true ruler of Impiltur because the [[Sambryl|Queen-Regent Sambryl]] always sought Kyrlraun's advice regarding state affairs. Kyrlraun's gravest concern regarded the situation developing in [[Damara]] around the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]].
 
==Personality==
Kyrlraun possessed great tolerance and had grounded understanding of the common people.
