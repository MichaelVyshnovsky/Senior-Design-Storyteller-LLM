        "mainbody": "Garavan was a Netherese tinkerer and the creator of the Light Pump.\nGaravans skill with tinkering and technology was extremely surprising. He had at least one ruby cut to his specifications, strongly implying he did not cut gems himself.\nOf note, Garavan created the Light Pump.\nGaravan was a tinkerer who dabbled in forgotten arcane lore.\nWhen Myshella was attacked by a phaerimm-created antimagic stone juggernaut, Garavan, an inhabitant of the city, devised a weapon meant to destroy the construct the Light Pump. The parts were built to his specifications."
