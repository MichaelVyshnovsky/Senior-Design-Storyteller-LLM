        "mainbody": "'''Govan Irfandel''' was the [[elf|elven]] [[druid]] who built and founded the druidic Stone Circle of Govan in the unapproachable [[Brush of Barbs]] ''circa'' [[1072 DR]].",
        "History": "Sometime in 1072 DR, Govan Irfandel created a pair of [[enchanted]] ''[[Govan's gloves|gloves]]'' that helped him to strengthen his affinity with the [[tree]]s, vines, shrubbery, and animals of the wild patch of land called the Brush of Barbs. The woods were secluded because of their impenetrable overgrown thickets and thorns that took over. Govan knew it was the perfect place for his fellow druids. Stories said he convinced the plants to help him drag the giant rocks and stone into position, creating a druidic standing stone circle, called the Stone Circle of Govan. The circle became the meeting place, shelter, safe haven, and ritual space for the good druids."
