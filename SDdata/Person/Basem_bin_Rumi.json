        "mainbody": "Basem bin Rumi was a gnome alchemist and researcher living in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.\nBasem was a friendly fellow who was easily distracted by fantasies. His sense of humor made adventuring with Basem a pleasure. He was also incredibly resourceful under stress.\nFashion was important to Basem. He always dressed himself in fine silks and a gold-colored fez.\nDriven by what some considered a foolish pursuit, Basem spent much of his fortune attempting to discover a way to turn metals such as lead or copper into gold. His home was littered with large mechanical water clocks while he tried to discover new methods of making them more efficient.\nBasem resorted to adventuring any time his funds ran low. He also sold magical potions to other adventurers.\nBasem settled in Huzuz after a successful career spent adventuring on the Crowded Sea as captain of a sambuk.\nBasem owned a pair of bracers of defense AC 5, a ring of water walking, a  wand of fear, a bag of holding and a multitude of magical potions."
