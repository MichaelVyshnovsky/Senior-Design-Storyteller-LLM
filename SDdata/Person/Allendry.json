        "mainbody": "'''Allendry''' was the brave captain of the ''[[Midnight Rose]]'' ship that sailed the [[Sea of Swords]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Rrawk! She's Allendry's ship, his heart, and his pride! As tor poor old Polly. He'd rather fly.''|Allendry's pet [[parrot]] [[Polly]]}}",
        "Description": "Allendry was a strong, tall, grey-skinned, one-eyed half-orc.",
        "Relationships": "Allendry's trusted intelligent and sassy companion was his old talking parrot Polly who always recited limericks and jokes taught to him by the crew. His first mate â€“ [[Nisar Zayid]], was Allendry's most trusted crew member who often was in charge of the ''Rose'' when the captain was away.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Captain Allendry accepted a precious cargo and several passengers at the docks of [[Neverwinter]]. The priestess of [[Umberlee]] [[Tasina Alcrest]] was among them, along with an adventuring sailor, later known as the [[Eater-of-Garm]], and a [[wizard]] with a powerful [[statue]] [[artifact]] excavated from the far-away [[Anauroch]]. The statue was an ancient item sought after by Umberlee, and cursed anyone touching it with terrifying visions of floods and tsunamis. The sailor named [[Martins]] was tasked with retrieving and loading the statue from the [[Silver Sails Trading Company]] but was utterly traumatized by visions. He refused to sail and drank instead. Captain Allendry sent the Eater-of-Garm and a fellow sailor Nisar Zayid to retrieve the item.\n\nWhen the ''Rose'' departed the docks of Neverwinter, Tasina Alcrest demanded the statue be handed to her. When refused, she was adamant about taking it by force. Tasina summoned an army of [[sahuagin]] that slaughtered most of the crew, including Allendry. She captured the ''Midnight Rose'', while Nisar and the Eater-of-Garm were the only lucky survivors.\n\nBecause of his hatred-filled death, Allendry wanted vengeance before he went to the [[Fugue Plane]]. Subsequently, his [[ghost]] entrusted the Eater-of-Garm with the captaincy of the ''Midnight Rose'' in exchange for the promise of bloody revenge."
