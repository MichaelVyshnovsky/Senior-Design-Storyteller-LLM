Takako became separated and was ambushed by a monster hearing her scream, the alerted samurai rushed to her side, but the monster escaped them through the undergrowth, Tazumi glimpsed the creature crouching over Takako and mistook it for a kala and informed Takako. But with no more than a scratch and a bump, Takako confidently dismissed this incident as just another monster attack.\nBut, several weeks later, Takako suffered a nightmare and a monster stalked the halls of the daimyos donjon and murdered and partly ate a samurai. The daimyo, Benju Matsutomo, uncle to Takako, may have had his adventurers investigate and protect Takako during the night. During the day, they questioned Takako, Tazumi, and the samurai guards Takako told his story but had doubts that it was a kala. Privately, he feared it might even be a shikki-gaki. He was wrong either way Takako transformed into a tagamaling buso and attacked the adventurers. Seeking a cure or a cause, Tazumi and his fellow samurai guided the adventurers to the site of the first attack in the forest and likely helped hunt down the unusual cursed tigbanua buso and slew it, ending Takakos and others afflictions."
