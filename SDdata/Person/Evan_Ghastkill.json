        "mainbody": "Lord Evan Ghastkill was the head of the prominent Ghastkill family of Nashkel in Amn in the late 14 century DR.\nEvan was the elder brother of Mayor Berrun Ghastkill. He was wed with Cara, and their only son was Evan the Younger.\nLord Evan had been very ill for a long period and, although he had stubbornly clung to life, he was not expected to live through 1370 DR. His son was eager to take over, but Cara and Berrun both believed he was an unsuitable heir."
