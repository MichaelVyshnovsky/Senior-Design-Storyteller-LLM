'''Tami''' was a maid at [[Thistleflame Manor]] and servant of Lord [[Partic Thistle]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
Tami was a curvaceous, black-haired young woman prone to giggling. She managed to dress provocatively despite her professional work at the Manor.

==Personality==
Tami was extremely flirtatious and eager for attention and affection.

==Activities==
Tami was one of the maids of Thistle Manor, alongside [[Larwyn]], and was responsible for maintaining the lower two floors of the Manor. She was somewhat careless and inattentive to her work, preferring instead to flirt with any man that caught her eye.

==Relationships==
Tami hoped that Lord Thistle would fall in love and marry her, and was greatly upset that he instead fancied [[Annalise]], the barmaid at the [[Bubbling Bulwark]]. She called Annalise "That ale-slinging trollop."
