Sylvie Summerworth was a lightfoot halfling from the Rivington district of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
This pale-skinned blonde hin woman wore fanciful red tunic and breeches and had her nose pierced, decorated with a simple note ring.
She was friends with a fellow lightfoot named Randalf.
In the , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldurs Gate, displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. However, Sylvie Summerworth was not particularly frightened by the encroaching army. Instead, she trash-talked the Sword Coast Courier pigeon mail services that continually suffered missing birds and undelivered letters. Her ire was so strong, Sylvie entertained the idea of buying and training her own pigeons. Unbeknownst to most, the pigeons were hunted and eaten by Gale Dekarioss tressym named Tara, who recently followed her master to Baldurs Gate from Waterdeep.
