{{quote|''Do not, under any circumstances, employ Sword Coast Couriers! Their service is appalling.''|Sylvie Summerworth}}

==Description==
This pale-skinned blonde hin woman wore fanciful red [[tunic]] and breeches and had her nose pierced, decorated with a simple note ring.

==Relationships==
She was friends with a fellow lightfoot named [[Randalf]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. However, Sylvie Summerworth was not particularly frightened by the encroaching army. Instead, she trash-talked the [[Sword Coast Courier]] [[pigeon]] mail services that continually suffered missing birds and undelivered letters. Her ire was so strong, Sylvie entertained the idea of buying and training her own pigeons. Unbeknownst to most, the pigeons were hunted and eaten by [[Gale Dekarios]]'s [[tressym]] named [[Tara]], who recently followed her master to Baldur's Gate from [[Waterdeep]].
