        "mainbody": "higaerd Obarskyr II was a king of Cormyr and son of Azoun III.\nRhigaerd II was the father of Azoun IV and had a daughter named Sulesta. He was married to Tanalusta Truesilver.\nRhigaerd was renowned for his spies. He gave them all boots of stealth and sent them off to map all castles and towns. Eventually the order of spies was betrayed from within and the boots were dispersed into the realms so that nobody could amass such a band again.The item description given in Baldurs Gate doesnt specify whether the king in question was Rhiigard Obarskyr (sometimes spelled \"Rhiegard\") or Rhigaerd Obarskyr II. Due to the inconsistent spelling of Rhiigard, this article assumes Rhigaerd II had the boots commissioned.\nWhen Azoun III died, prince Rhigaerd II was only six years old, so Salember Obarskyr took the throne of Cormyr as regent. Salember plotted to kill Rhigaerd and take the throne, leading Cormyr into civil war."
