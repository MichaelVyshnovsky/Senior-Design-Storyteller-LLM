==Description==
Granitdatter was a [[dwarf|dwarvish]] woman with pale skin, blue eyes, long strawberry blonde hair and a clean-shaven face. She wore a uniform of the Flaming Fist – a set of [[chain mail]]s and a [[tabard]] adorned with the Flaming Fist insignia, with a large [[greataxe]] strapped to her back.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Granitdatter was stationed just outside one of the gates between the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] and its more affluent [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]]. Her and the fellow Fists' job was stopping rabble from entering the Upper City, allowing only those with much [[coin]] through. The Fists managed a slow-moving queue of rich and poor – city folk trying to return home or just find safety behind the second set of walls.
