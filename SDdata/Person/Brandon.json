        "mainbody": "Brandon ( \nA master of tactics, Brandon hired himself out as a war-leader for almost any kind of action and for almost any employer, provided it did not involve seafaring and fit his moral code, and particularly if the pay was good. For his services, Brandon charged 20 gold pieces per day for himself, refunding half if the mission was a failure, and 4 gold pieces per day per man-at-arms he was required to bring along.\nAlthough based in Priapurl on the Dragon Coast, he operated in all the lands in the Inner Sea area, as well as on the trade routes running west through the Western Heartlands to the Sword Coast, so long as he was on dry land.\nBrandon was a hearty and jovial man, oft given to brawling, but this hid a very shrewd mind with a code of honor. Although a mercenary, he wouldnt do anything that would upset the peace in an area long-term, knowing that large-scale warfare would make his work much more dangerous, increase competition, and reduce funds available to pay him. He detested sea combat and all forms of seafaring, and was only ever found on dry land. He would happily tell stories of all his deeds to anyone with the patience.\nBrandon had served for a time in the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company (also based at Priapurl). However, despite greatly respecting its commander, Gayrlana, he got along poorly with her non-human troops."
