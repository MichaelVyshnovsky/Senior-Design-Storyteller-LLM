'''Ruelrond Honadarr''' was the Master Shipwright and builder of Honadarr's Unsinkable Hulks from the city of [[Hlath]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Ruelrond was a famed shipbuilder among sailors for creating large wide-hulled vessels, resistant to capsizing. Honadarr's Unsinkable Hulks were treated with fire-resistant substances and were virtually impossible to sink. Ruelrond Honadarr's critics claimed that the Hulks "sailed sideways" and had "all the grace of a bloated dead [[ox]] carcass."
