'''Jerlys Horlbar''' was the [[drow]] matron mother of [[House Horlbar]] in [[Menzoberranzan]].

==Description==
Jerlys was a beautiful female [[elf]] with smooth long legs and she would use her feminine wiles to seduce and manipulate her victims.

==Possessions==
As a priestess of [[Lolth]], Jerlys fought with an 8 ft (2.4 m) red three tentacle [[rod]], which she could use with deadly force. Like many drow, she wore [[drow chainmail]].

==History==
House Horlbar was the twelfth ruling house in Menzoberranzan, and Jerlys Horlbar was one of two high priestesses of Lolth, the Spider Queen.

In [[1357 DR]], [[Artemis Entreri]] encountered Jerlys in the back alleyways of the drow city while he was appearing as a member of [[Bregan D'aerthe]].
