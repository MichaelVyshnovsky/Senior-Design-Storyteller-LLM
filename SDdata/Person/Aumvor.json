        "mainbody": "'''Aumvor the Undying''' was an ancient [[Netherese]] [[lich]] and [[archmage]] who was infamous since [[Netheril]]'s [[Age of Discovery]] for his unmatched mastery over [[necromancy]].",
        "History": "He was named \"the Undying\" because, before seeking lichdom, he lived for centuries by leeching the living energy of his \"living zombie\" servitors, many of them members of his own family.\n\nThe casting of ''[[Karsus's avatar]]'' in the [[-339 DR|Year of Sundered Webs, âˆ’339 DR]], an event that nearly tore the [[Weave]] apart and caused the fall of Netheril, caused the activation of his contingency magics: Aumvor was teleported into his hidden lair inside the [[Endless Caverns]], far below the [[High Forest]] and transformed into a lich.\n\nAumvor once tried to make [[Laeral Silverhand]] his bride by making her find the legendary ''[[Crown of Horns]]''. His plot failed thanks to the timely intervention of [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]], but the involvement of Aumvor remained hidden.",
        "Description": "Aumvor, in life, was a short and stocky Netherese human mage, with fat hands, a sizable paunch, fair skin and a long, unkempt black hair.\n\nAfter attaining lichdom, he grew more obese, resembling the bloated, rotten corpse of a drowned man, with bone-white slimy skin dangling over his skeletal frame.",
        "Activities": "Aumvor, being one of the last Netherese archmages, dreamed of restoring the ancient glory of Netheril and escaping the strictures [[Mystra]] placed on the Weave after the disastrous casting of ''Karsus's avatar''.\n\nHe subtly aided promising individuals with Netherese bloodlines by placing grimoires and [[spell]] [[scroll]]s where they could find them.\n\nAumvor developed many spells during his centuries-long research into the necromantic arts. Two of these spells were named after him: ''[[Aumvor's fragmented phylactery]]'' and ''[[Aumvor's soulshatter]]''.",
        "Possessions": "Aumvor was in control of many powerful [[artifact]]s, among them the ''[[alicorn diadem of Sharrven]]'', the ''[[bonestaff of Sadebreth]]'', the ''[[Crown of Horns]]'', the ''[[jewel cage of Congenio]]'', and the ''[[tear of Ascore]]'', which was pyramid-shaped.",
        "Relationships": "Aumvor had a great-grandniece named [[Morasha]], herself a powerful necromancer, who lived with in a tower in the [[Lonely Moor]] owned by him.\n\nHe had an apprentice named [[Briel]], who was an [[archmage]] that received tutelage up until the {{YearlinkName|1320}}."
