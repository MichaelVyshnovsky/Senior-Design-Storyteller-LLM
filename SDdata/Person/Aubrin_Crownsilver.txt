'''Aubrin Crownsilver''', who usually went by his nickname '''"Brin"''', was a young acolyte of [[Torm]] and a scion of the [[Crownsilver]] noble family of [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Due to his grandmother's dalliance with a prince of Cormyr, his father was a bastard [[Obarskyr]],{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|4267}} which, under Cormyrean law and rules of succession, placed him fourth in the line for the throne as of [[1479 DR]].{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|4283}}

==History==
===Early Life===
Brin's father was assassinated by Crownsilver rivals when he was just a boy, presumably because of his father's claim to the throne.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|399}} His second cousin, [[Constancia Crownsilver]], was assigned to look after him and be his nursemaid. Later, Brin's aunt, [[Helindra Crownsilver]], placed him in a [[Torm|Tormite]] monastery to hide him from rivals. Brin was an indifferent acolyte and was not happy at the monastery.<ref>

==Teen Years==
In the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, Brin ran away from the monastary, which led the Tormites to charge Constancia with dereliction of duty. When Constancia followed Brin to the [[Sword Coast]], the Tormites placed a bounty on her. It was this bounty that a trio of bounty hunters, [[Mehen]] and his adopted [[tiefling]] daughters [[Farideh]] and [[Havilar]], were pursuing when they met Brin on the road to [[Neverwinter]]. Brin tagged along with the group and aided Farideh and Havilar in foiling a devilish plot in Neverwinter.{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1478}}, Brin was waiting in [[Waterdeep]] for Mehen to return from the [[Suzail]] portal after taking Constancia to Cormyr. While they were in Waterdeep, word came to their [[Harper]] friend [[Tam Zawad]] that a page from an ancient, magical [[Netherese]] book was for sale. Before the group could purchase the page, it was bought by a shady caravan master, [[Adolican Rhand]]. Tam and friends were able to successfully steal the page from Rhand's mansion and were able to locate the location of [[Tarchamus the Unyielding]]'s library near [[Everlund]].<ref>

The group traveled to the [[Library of Tarchamus|library]] and found the tome to which the page belonged. In the process, the companions killed Tarchamus's [[mummy]] and the [[ghost]]s of his apprentices. Unfortunately, they found it necessary to destroy the library.<ref>

==Relationships==
Brin and Havilar had a relationship with each other.<ref><ref>

==Skills==
Brin wasn't much of a priest although occasionally Torm saw fit to grant him healing powers. Brin also had access to the Crownsilver's vast wealth.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|1512}}
