Baron Aldorn "Foesmasher" Thuragar  was the cautious, yet committed ruler of Sespech in the mid–14th century DR. While he held his court in the capital of Ormpetarr, Thuragar also frequented Mimph and Elbulder with appearances.
The three-day long celebration known as the Feast of Purple Majesty, was held annually in the last few days of Alturiak to celebrate the barons rise to power.
Among Baron Thuragars possessions were a rod of lordly might, a scarab of protection, and a ring of mind shielding.
Baron Thuragar was once a member of the adventuring company known as the Band of Iron.
