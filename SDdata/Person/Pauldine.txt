Pauldine was a half-elven priest of Chauntea inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She lived in a house in the southeast section of Daggerford in between Water Street and Kaoth Alley near the River Gate.
She owned a number of scrolls containing useful divine magic spells that she looked forward to using once she developed her powers.
