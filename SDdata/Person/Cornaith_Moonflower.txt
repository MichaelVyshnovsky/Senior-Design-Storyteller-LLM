'''Cornaith Moonflower''' was the son of [[Sharlario Moonflower]]. He traveled with his father across [[Faer√ªn]]. On one of these trips both encountered the godess [[Eilistraee]]. The godess warned them of a dangerous race in the south. Powerful and evil [[dark elves]] in city known as [[Atorrnash]] who worshiped the evil god [[Vhaeraun]]. They visited the city and became guests of the dark elf and the ruler of the city, the mage [[Ka'Narlist]]. The mage exchanged a gift with Cornaith. He got a marvelous and magical enhanced dagger. When he and his father learned that the [[red dragon]] [[Mahatnartorian]] was bound back to the north, both left the city in hurry to help their people.
