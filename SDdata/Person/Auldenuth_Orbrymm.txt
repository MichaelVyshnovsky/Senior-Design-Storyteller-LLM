Aldenuth Orbrymm was a tavern owner inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Aldenuth owned the Hanged Man tavern that was located at the intersection of Pressbow Lane and Net Street in Waterdeeps Dock Ward. He would occasionally allow patrons to pay off their bar tabs by beating some of his regulars in a "tall tales" contest. If they failed then they had to wash dishes to pay off the debt.
