        "mainbody": "Pardus was a regular of the Rising Moon in the mid-14 century DR.\nHe liked the way Korvan cooked his vegetables, and wasnt above going behind his wife to eat as he pleased.\nHe was strongly implied to be a saddle maker.\nHis wife was Yantra.\nOne night during Shandrils initial absence in the , Pardus praised Korvans cooking in a way that offended his wife, Yantra.
