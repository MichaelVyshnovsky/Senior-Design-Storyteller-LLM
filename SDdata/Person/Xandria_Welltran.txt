'''Xandria Welltran''' was a resident of [[Phlan]] that lived in the city and died some time during or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|17}} There was evidence that they were a member of, or otherwise associated with the first iteration of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].While not explicitly stated, allusions to the formation of dracoliches and use of [[chromatic dragon]] imagery associated with Tiamat (not to mention the theme of the ''[[Adventurers League/Tyranny of Dragons|Tyranny of Dragons]]'' [[Adventurers League]] storyline), suggest this character is associated with the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

==History==
Xandria was buried within the stone-and-[[marble]] [[Welltran Crypt]] in [[Valhingen Graveyard]].

At some point in the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Brother [[Keefe]] and the [[Kelemvorite]] clerics of Phlan were offered some manner of evidence showing that Xandria was not in fact [[human]] but rather a [[green dragon]] that had been ''[[polymorph]]ed''.{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|20}}

==Rumors and Legends==
Xandria's crypt included oddities associated with [[dragonkind]] and the Cult of the Dragon. Notable among these were [[humanoid]] skeletons with [[dragon]]-shaped skulls, a secret door opened with gems representing the five types of [[chromatic dragon]]s associated with the goddess [[Tiamat]],{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|18}} and cursed alchemical solutions that could reanimate the bones and flesh of draconic beings.{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|19}}
