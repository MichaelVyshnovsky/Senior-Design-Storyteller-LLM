        "mainbody": "'''Holly Harrowslough''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Lathander]] and a member of the [[Order of the Aster]].",
        "Description": "She had dark brown skin and bushy brown hair that she cut short. Her dark brown eyes sparkled with life. She had a tall (5'10\"), sturdy frame and a muscular build. When going into battle she donned [[Plate mail|full plate armor]].",
        "History": "Holly's father was a [[faris]] (a holy warrior) from [[Zakhara]] and her mother a farmer from [[Daggerdale]]. Holly's father taught her a strong respect for justice and law, and told wonderful tales of the holy and just [[knight]]s of his distant homeland, dedicated to his god, [[Hajama]] the Courageous.\n\nBoth Holly's mother and father were supporters of [[Randal Morn]]'s rebellion against the occupying forces of [[Zhentil Keep]], which controlled the dale under a puppet ruler. Holly accompanied her father on raids and helped her mother patch the wounds of others from those raids, so that the young woman learned early in life both the martial and healing arts.\n\nAt fifteen, Holly joined the [[Order of the Aster]], a fellowship of knights dedicated to [[Lathander]]'s church, which held similar beliefs to [[Hajama]]'s. Shortly thereafter, she journeyed to [[Shadowdale]] to receive religious training at the temple of Lathander. While Holly was in Shadowdale, Holly's parents, uncle, and grandmother were killed in an [[orc]] raid on their Daggerdale farm. The orcs had been equipped and supported by agents of Zhentil Keep.\n\nHolly was given leave to aid Randal Morn in his rebellion against the [[Zhentilar]] and served the rebel lord as a messenger, warrior, and spy. She proved extremely capable in the last role, owing to her youth and innocent appearance. During the rebellion against the Zhentilar, Holly was chosen by Lathander to prevent the resurrection of the evil god [[Bane]], and she joined [[Joel]] to achieve that end. Joel often compared the paladin's relationship to Lathander with his own relationship to [[Finder]].<ref>{{Cite dragon annual/1997/Rogues Gallery: Finder's Band|57}}"
