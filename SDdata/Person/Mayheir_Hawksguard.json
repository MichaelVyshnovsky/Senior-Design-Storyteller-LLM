        "mainbody": "Mayheir Hawksguard was a soldier from Shadowdale that briefly served as the sergeant-at-arms at the Twisted Tower of Ashaba for a time during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe was an older and seasoned warrior.\nGiven his position as an aide to Lord Mourngrym Amcathra, Mayheir was often put in the position of dealing with big and eccentric personalities, such as the Sage of Shadowdale Elminster Aumar and his scribe Lhaeo.\nDuring their short time fighting alongside one another, Mayheir became fast friends with the mortal warrior Kelemvor Lyonsbane.\nDuring the Second battle of Shadowdale in the , Hawksguard drew up the plans to draw the approaching Zhentilar soldiers into an area full of falling-tree traps, where they would be easily downed by Dalesmen archers. The trap worked well but the soldiers continued to pour through into Shadowdale.\nNone of the Dales leaders knew that the avatar of Bane drew more strength onto itself for every additional death, regardless of the individuals side in the battle. With so many dead Zhentilar, Banes avatar soon became too powerful for any of the warriors to combat. Just as Bane was about to kill Mourngrym Amcathra with his bare hand, Mayheir freed his liege from harms way and threw himself in the way of the fatal blow.\nWith Hawksguards dying words, he caught his friend Kelemvors attention and bid him one last important message. He told Kelemvor a joke and inspired a glimmer of hope in the place of despair. The contents of the joke were never described."
