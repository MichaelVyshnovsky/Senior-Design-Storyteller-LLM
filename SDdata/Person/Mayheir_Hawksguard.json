        "mainbody": "'''Mayheir Hawksguard''' was a soldier from [[Shadowdale]] that briefly served as the sergeant-at-arms at the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]] for a time during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Look here. I have an unhappy liege. If I have an unhappy liege, then you have an unhappy liege. And if we have an unhappy liege, then...|Mayheir to [[Lhaeo]], trying to gain admittance into [[Elminster's tower]].}}",
        "Description": "He was an older and seasoned warrior.",
        "Relationships": "Given his position as an aide to Lord [[Mourngrym Amcathra]], Mayheir was often put in the position of dealing with big and eccentric personalities, such as the Sage of Shadowdale [[Elminster Aumar]] and his scribe [[Lhaeo]].\n\nDuring their short time fighting alongside one another, Mayheir became fast friends with the mortal warrior [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]].",
        "History": "During the [[Second battle of Shadowdale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Hawksguard drew up the plans to draw the approaching [[Zhentilar]] soldiers into an area full of falling-tree traps, where they would be easily downed by Dalesmen archers. The trap worked well but the soldiers continued to pour through into Shadowdale.\n\nNone of the Dales' leaders knew that the [[avatar]] of [[Bane]] drew more strength onto itself for every additional death, regardless of the individual's side in the battle. With so many dead Zhentilar, Bane's avatar soon became too powerful for any of the warriors to combat. Just as Bane was about to kill Mourngrym Amcathra with his bare hand, Mayheir freed his liege from harm's way and threw himself in the way of the fatal blow.\n\nWith Hawksguard's dying words, he caught his friend Kelemvor's attention and bid him one last important message. He told Kelemvor a joke and inspired a glimmer of hope in the place of despair. The contents of the joke were never described."
