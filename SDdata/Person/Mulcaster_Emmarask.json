He said it was once the will of Alusair Obarskyr, Filfaeril Obarskyr, and Caladnei. However, the ghost of Alusair arrived and, in overt outrage, proclaimed his claim to be false. He accused her of being a fake sent by the War Wizards, instead she responded predictably, by chilling him with her ghostly power. Then things got violent all around.\nAfter the massacre at council, there was a listening spell on him, strongly implying he lived.\nHed been rumored to be plotting to take power with the Goldfeather family, rather than the Illance, and that his chosen king would strip all other families of their titles of nobility, and properties, and then exiled.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryNobles\nCategoryLords and ladies\nCategoryMembers of House Emmarask\nCategoryInhabitants of Suzail\nCategoryInhabitants of Cormyr\nCategoryInhabitants of Interior Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands\n7it2a0blle0j50vx9v5r4i7xq9uru4z"
