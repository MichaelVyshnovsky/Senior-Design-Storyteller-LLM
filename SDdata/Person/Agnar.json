He was willing to educate other hunters in his methods for luring out some of the most ferocious dinosaurs in Chult, but only if those hunters impressed him with their trophies first.\nIn his capacity as a merchant, he sold bait and information used to lure dangerous or famous prey. He could provide hunters with a horn of the eotyrannus.\nHe also specialized in weapons, although he only did business with accomplished hunters.\nAgnar was a member of the Hunters Guild of Chult, who congregated at Hunters Square in Port Nyanzaru.\nWhen Volothamp Geddarm visited the city in the late 15 century DR, he spoke with Agnar about the dinosaurs of Chult.\nAgnar was interested in collecting the teeth of \"the Tyrant\", a great tyrannosaurus, and he instructed hunters to use rotten and rancid meat collected from the garbage pit of Port Nyanzaru to lure out this beast. Other famous dinosaurs whom he sought included the \"Lord of the Raptors\" Musshussu and the so-called King of Spines."
