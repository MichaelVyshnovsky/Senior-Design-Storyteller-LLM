        "mainbody": "'''Leylenna Candulhallow''' was a [[moon elf]] [[mage]] and the matriarch of the [[Candulhallow]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "Leylenna was particularly versed in [[necromancy]].",
        "Activities": "Her family managed Baldur's Gate's fleet of corpse carts and gained their [[coin]] from those who had lost loved ones, as well as stipends from the city. Her agents' duties were to cart bodies around the Gate, and move them to burial grounds or to the [[Shrine of the Suffering]].\n\nCandulhallow was also known to be the chief purchaser of corpses in the city, and she experimented only on rare and first-rate bodies.",
        "Relationships": "Leylenna had some sort of relationship with [[the Guild]], as her family were involved in smuggling alongside the minions of [[Astele Keene]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1492 DR]], Leylenna was matriarch of the Candulhallow family. They, however, seldom got involved in the grunt work, as they had grown rather wealthy from scams involving the dead.\n\nMadam Candulhallow was secretly working on a triumph of necromancy, a so-called \"evolution of both art and life\". She had been working on this for several months within the confines of her dank basement."
