He disliked troublemakers but appreciated adventurers in times of need. His goal in 1370 was to unveil Zhentarim and Cult of the Dragon spies inside Xantharl.\nHelder dreamed of the day when Xantharl would be an oasis of peace dedicated to Mielikki, but knew he was too old to see his dream become reality. He accepted his duty to defend the keep until his death."
