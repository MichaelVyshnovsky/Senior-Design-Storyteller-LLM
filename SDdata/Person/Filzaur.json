        "mainbody": "Filzaur was a male drow wizard and a student of the Inverted Tower in Szith Morcane.\nAn average-looking male drow, Filzaur distinguished himself by his atypical attire among drow society. He wore gaudy attire of greens and yellows, typically sporting black boots and trousers, an emerald-green shirt, and a yellow sash around his waist. If he had cause to leave the Inverted Tower (a rare occurrence), Filzaur wore a large black cloak over his lighter garments.\nFilzaur was particularly studious and tended to isolate himself to his room in the Inverted Tower where he could focus on creating vile curses.\nA skilled wizard and the apprentice of Solom Nedrazak, Filzaur had researched many spells that caused diseases or inflicted curses on a victim. In addition, he had studied alchemy and could create a number of magical potions.\nAs an apprentice of the Inverted Tower, Filzaur was denied many possessions owing to the policy of austerity that his master, Solom, enforced. However, he did keep a leather-bound spellbook in his room and wore a set of bracers of armor and a ring of protection.\nFilzaur usually kept to himself but had a cordial enough relationship with the other members of the Inverted Tower to study alongside them communally.\nAs an apprentice of the archmage, Solom Nedrazak, in the Inverted Tower, Filzaur had spent many years studying the art of wizardry. In 1372 DR, Filzaur was present when House Morcane fell to Kiaransaleean cultists and the refugees from Maerimydra arrived. Despite these disturbances to Szith Morcanes society, Filzaur and the rest of his colleagues in the Inverted Tower were left largely unaffected.\nCategoryDrow\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryInhabitants of the Inverted Tower\nCategoryInhabitants of Szith Morcane\nCategoryInhabitants of the Deep Wastes\nCategoryInhabitants of the Upperdark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nrj8wtyqy5s66kpygs501afvzi3so3u7"
