'''Aurinax''' ({{Pronounce|OR|ah|nax|refs=}}) was a [[gold dragon]] resident of the [[Dragon Tower]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Description==
Aurinax often disguised himself as an elderly [[dwarf]] called '''Barok Clanghammer'''. In that form, he used the ''dragonstaff'' as a walking stick.

He had the power to entirely bypass ''[[Ahghairon's dragonward]]'' and freely enter into and out of the City of Splendors.

==Personality==
As befitting a gold dragon, Aurinax had an enlightened outlook highlighted by compassion and keen vigilance. He was not so beholden to avarice as some other [[dragon]]s were.

==Relationships==
Aurinax was rather fond of the [[Tyr]]ran [[monk]] [[Hlam]] who also lived in Waterdeep. The two had become good acquaintances after an encounter and kept in contact over the course of many years. 

He was good friends with [[Maaril|Maaril the Dragon Mage]].

==History==
At some point, Aurinax was hired by [[Dagult Neverember]] to guard the [[gold]] stored in the [[Vault of Dragons]], in exchange for the ''[[dragonstaff of Ahghairon]]'' and payment in [[gem]]s.

Although he understood that the gold he guarded had been obtained unfairly, he had let his greed cloud his judgement and agreed to guard the treasure. He was under orders not to let anyone except for Neverember himself or one of his vassals to remove the treasure.

During [[Wintershield]] festivities, Aurinax's apprentice [[Chadwick]] drunkenly revealed the location of the ''dragonstaff of Ahghairon'' to the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. He was promptly kidnapped as the Cult prepared to raid Aurinax's vault, but was rescued shortly after by a group of adventurers passing by. The adventurers proceeded to Aurinax's abode, where they defeated the cultists and secured the ''dragonstaff'', returning it to Aurinax.
