        "mainbody": "'''Spirelli''' was a giant talking [[snail]] who was the only non-[[human]] member of the [[Blade Council of Lomatra]] in the early 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Spirelli was a human-sized snail. His eyes were on the ends of prehensile eyestalks, which had the habit of swiveling to look at both sides of an argument at once.\n\nBubbles foamed under his shell when he was upset.\n\nWhen in battle, he rode on the back of a [[horse]] and wore a [[helmet]].",
        "Personality": "Spirelli was a very charismatic individual and a persuasive speaker. He could also be underhanded and conniving, using his wealth to further his own ends.",
        "Possessions": "Spirelli was extremely wealthy. He owned two palaces, a golden pleasure [[barge]], and a large [[mercenary]] company. He was the owner of about half of [[Lomatra]] in the [[Blade Kingdoms]], including the city hall. He was known to travel in a [[sedan chair]].",
        "History": "Spirelli was not originally from Lomatra, although his exact origins were unclear. According to [[Lorenzo Utrelli]], he came to Lomatra around the {{YearlinkName|1208}} from a forest that could have been the [[Chondalwood]]. He originally went by a different name, which sounded like '''Boble-boop'''. He brought with him a large supply of [[mother of pearl]], which he exchanged for considerable wealth. Following his arrival in Lomatra, Spirelli started paying taxes, which entitled him to citizenship. Over a year later, he became a mercenary commander by hiring a large mercenary company. He spent nearly 200,000 [[ducat]]s becoming a [[Blade Captain]].\n\nIn the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1217}}, Spirelli made a late appearance at the meeting of the [[Blade Council of Lomatra]]. He argued in favor of Lomatra remaining allies with [[Sumbria]]. In their next meeting his vote was interrupted by [[Miliana Mannicci]] and [[Lorenzo Utrelli]] who used a scheme involving [[peppercorn]]s to outvote him.\n\nSome weeks later, Spirelli rode alongside [[Orlando Tropello]] in the aftermath of the battle with [[Ugo Svar√©zi]], and failed to buy the favor of Orlando or his soldiers."
