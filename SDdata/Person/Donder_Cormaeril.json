        "mainbody": "'''Donder Cormaeril''' was Lord of [[House Cormaeril]] in [[Cormyr]] around the turn of the 13{{th}}-century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Donder was a tall man with green eyes and brown hair. For facial hair, he favored a mustache. He dressed smartly, ready for action.",
        "Personality": "He was a man of few words and had a pithy sense of humor.",
        "Abilities": "Donder was an expert at swordsmanship and at breeding and training [[horse]]s.",
        "Activities": "According to famed explorer and historian [[Volothamp Geddarm]], Donder and his friend [[Althallan Crownsilver]] instigated a scheme to undermine the holdings of western [[Sembia]] and point the blame toward the [[Eltrym Drauthglas|Lord of Hullack]].{{Cite dragon/281/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 4|77}}",
        "History": "While visiting House [[Jarthoon]], Donder was cornered by Lord [[Ongmar Jarthoon]] and forced to make a choice between siding with him against King [[Pryntaler Obarskyr]] or death. Donder swiftly drew his sword, wounded Ongmar, and then used him as a shield to make his way over to a window above the courtyard. He then jumped from the high window and escaped on one of his prize horses.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "As reported by Volo, Cormaeril was likely one of the creators and promulgators of the legend of the [[Hullack Hawk]]â€”a notorious bandit that preyed on merchants from Sembia. He and co-conspirator Althallan led a search party organized by [[Chanthar Huntsilver]] away from the hiding place of the Hawk, allowing the brigand to escape."
