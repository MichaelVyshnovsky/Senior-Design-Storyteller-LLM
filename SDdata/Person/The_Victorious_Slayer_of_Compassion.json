        "mainbody": "'''The Victorious Slayer of Compassion''', nicknamed '''Victoricus''' by Marrec,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|189|18}}",
        "Description": "The Victorious Slayer of Compassion approximately resembled a wolf, made of blackened ice in a mockery of life. Its eye sockets held red, twinkling hellfire. The creature stank of a frozen corpse, and spoke with a voice that was stark and devoid of warmth.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|180-181|18}} By rubbing their forearms (or forelegs) together, they could make a nerve-wracking trilling sound.",
        "Personality": "The Victorious Slayer of Compassion often tittered, giggled and laughed, amongst other unnerving noises. It also spat chunks of phlegm-coated ice sometimes.",
        "Abilities": "As other demons of its kind, The Victorious Slayer of Compassion hovered slightly above the ground, never really touching it,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|243|25}} or overly thick rubble.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|190|19}} It was also possessed of sufficient physical strength to challenge even [[demon]] lords such as [[Eschar]]{{cite book/Lady of Poison|224|23}} or break down iron doors.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|212|21}} Even upon destruction, the [[Queen Abiding]] reconstituted it without sparing a thought. She also called it by the nickname the mortals had given it, suggesting that it shared some of its perception and memories with the Queen Abiding.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|238|25}}",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|1373}}, after [[Fallon]] and [[Araluen]] crossed the [[Barrow of the Queen Abiding]],{{cite book/Lady of Poison|174|17}} they woke the demons in that vault up.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|183|18}} The Victorious Slayer of Compassion lured [[Marrec]]'s party to the Barrow of the Queen Abiding with promises of a deal;{{cite book/Lady of Poison|251|27}}",
        "Relationships": "Victoricus was a servant of the Queen Abiding. The Queen's barrow also held a number of other, similar demons, all of which were her servants.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|182-183|18}}"
