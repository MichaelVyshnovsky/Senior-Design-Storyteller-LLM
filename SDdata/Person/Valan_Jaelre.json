        "mainbody": "Valan Jaelre was a wizard leader of House Jaelre and the Jaezred Chaulssin.\nValan wore fine robes and a house insignia of a sunburst with two daggers pointing downward from it. He wielded a twisted staff that looked like it was made of filaments of shadow.\nHe was overconfident and would rant about how he would defeat his opponents and bring down Menzoberranzan even when fighting a losing battle.\nIn the late 15th century DR, Valan put a simulacrum of himself in charge of a House Jaelre attack on Shadowdale to steal the Pendant of Ashaba. The real Valan infiltrated the Braeryn in his ancestors home of Menzoberranzan, hoping to cause civil war. The assassins involvement was discovered, and the adventurers were dispatched to Stenchstreets to eliminate Valan.\nValan was taking orders from someone inside House Nuryndin."
