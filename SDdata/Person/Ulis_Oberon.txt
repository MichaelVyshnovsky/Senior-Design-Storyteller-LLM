'''Ulis Oberon''' was a member of the [[Oberon (family)|Oberon]] [[patriar]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Ulis Oberon was found dead, alongside the bodies of [[Malghar Caldwel]] and [[Flaev Linnacker]], within the territory controlled by [[the Guild]] and guarded by its thugs, near the entrance to the Guildhall in the [[Lower City]]. All three patriars were nothing but charred remains after the Guild failed to collect the trio's debts.
