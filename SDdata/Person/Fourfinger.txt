Fourfinger was a Netherese arcanist that specialized in water- and weather-related magic.
Fourfinger was an expert variator who did not associate with other arcanists. Mostly living as a lone wolf, the mage spent much of his time devoted to spell invention.
He enjoyed the presence of storms, some of which he may have summoned himself.
The weather specialist was born in . and one year later, he passed.
The inhabitants of Scourge believed that Fourfinger was the cause of the bad quality of the air, which they called rust. After Fourfinger passed, the rusty air still persisted. Many also believed that he was cause of the great storms that wracked the area.
