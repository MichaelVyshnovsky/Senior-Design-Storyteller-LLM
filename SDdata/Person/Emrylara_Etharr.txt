'''Emrylara Etharr''' was a noblewoman of the [[Rallyhorn]] family in [[Cormyr]] in the 2{{nd}} century [[DR]]. She married [[Aulard Etharr]], the grandson of the Royal Magician of Cormyr, [[Baerauble Etharr]].

==Description==
Emrylara was a tall woman with porcelain-white skin, green eyes, and hair black as a raven. She typically wore dark colored gowns and moved about silently in soft shoes.

==Personality==
She was quiet and had a serious demeanor. She admired thoughtful wisdom and shunned suitors that tried to impress her with showy, loud, or exuberant courtship rituals and clich√©s.

==Relationships==
She was the daughter of Lord [[Theldrin Rallyhorn]], a close and trusted advisor to the [[Obarskyr]]s. Emrylara greatly admired High Mage Baerauble and was attracted to his grandson, Aulard, who was "an echo of his grandsire" in look, dress, and manner.

==History==
She bore two children before she died at age thirty one. Her firstborn was a son, [[Obrynn Etharr|Obrynn]]. Her daughter, Narnytha, died in childhood.{{Cite dragon/279/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 2|82}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Her tomb was said to be filled with art and objects of great beauty, but nothing extremely valuable. Her [[ghost]] could be seen floating down the passage toward Theldrin's tomb and attempting, but failing, to gain entrance.
