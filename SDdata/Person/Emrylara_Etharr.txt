Emrylara Etharr was a noblewoman of the Rallyhorn family in Cormyr in the 2 century DR. She married Aulard Etharr, the grandson of the Royal Magician of Cormyr, Baerauble Etharr.
Emrylara was a tall woman with porcelain-white skin, green eyes, and hair black as a raven. She typically wore dark colored gowns and moved about silently in soft shoes.
She was quiet and had a serious demeanor. She admired thoughtful wisdom and shunned suitors that tried to impress her with showy, loud, or exuberant courtship rituals and clichés.
She was the daughter of Lord Theldrin Rallyhorn, a close and trusted advisor to the Obarskyrs. Emrylara greatly admired High Mage Baerauble and was attracted to his grandson, Aulard, who was "an echo of his grandsire" in look, dress, and manner.
She bore two children before she died at age thirty one. Her firstborn was a son, Obrynn. Her daughter, Narnytha, died in childhood.
Her tomb was said to be filled with art and objects of great beauty, but nothing extremely valuable. Her ghost could be seen floating down the passage toward Theldrins tomb and attempting, but failing, to gain entrance.
