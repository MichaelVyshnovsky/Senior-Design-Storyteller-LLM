        "Relationship": "Hern was a friend of [[Mavil]].",
        "Personality": "Hern was an old man, and with age his passions had slowly been ground down by the suffering he had witnessed over a lifetime. He was depressed, caring nothing about the outside world and did only the minimum of work. However, under the surface, he felt guilty for his loss of faith and occasionally Hern could be inflamed again by passion.",
        "Activities": "Along with the novice [[Natali]], Hern was responsible for the doors at the entrance of the monastery, deciding who could enter."
