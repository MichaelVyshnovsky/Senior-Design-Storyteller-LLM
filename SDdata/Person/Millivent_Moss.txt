Millivent Moss was a farmer that lived in and worked in the Twilight Marsh near Phlan during the 1480s DR.
Millivent ran a peat farm from a bog near Phlan with her husband Haldred Moss, her daughters Alleena Moss and Kithian Moss and her sons Quayle Moss and Volland Moss. Millivent and Haldred also had a fifth child, an infant named Bo. 
One day during the 1480s, a group of Foulwater goblins attacked the farm and captured all the family members except Millivent and baby Bo. So she went to the city searching for help. At last, Millivent hired some adventurers at the Madame Freonas Tea Kettle and they resolved the situation.
Later she moved to Kabels Hills community near Quivering Forest.
