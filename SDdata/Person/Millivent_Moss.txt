'''Millivent Moss''' was a farmer that lived in and worked in the [[Twilight Marsh]] near [[Phlan]] during the 1480s [[DR]].{{ToD-time}}

==Relationships==
Millivent ran a peat farm from a bog near Phlan with her husband [[Haldred Moss]], her daughters [[Alleena Moss]] and [[Kithian Moss]] and her sons [[Quayle Moss]] and [[Volland Moss]]. Millivent and Haldred also had a fifth child, an infant named [[Bo Moss|Bo]]. 

==History==
One day during the 1480s, a group of [[Foulwater]] [[goblin]]s attacked the farm and captured all the family members except Millivent and baby Bo. So she went to the city searching for help. At last, Millivent hired some adventurers at the [[Madame Freona's Tea Kettle]] and they resolved the situation.{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|11}}

Later she moved to [[Kabel's Hill]]'s community near [[Quivering Forest]].{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|10}}
