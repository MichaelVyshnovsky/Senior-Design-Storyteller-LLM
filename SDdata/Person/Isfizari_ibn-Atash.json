He hid these injuries behind hand and face wraps.\nIsfizari lived to spread the word of mighty Kossuth. On a weekly basis Isfizari tasked Ayesha al-Rumi and Qirmiz min Hudid with bringing him an enemy of his faith. The victim was burned alive during a special ceremony and their ashes were added to large pile containing the remains of previous victims."
