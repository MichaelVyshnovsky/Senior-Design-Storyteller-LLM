'''Hulik Strathtar''' was the fourth Belarkh (ruling lord) of [[Khôltar]], the Iron City, in [[south Faerûn]]. He was appointed or elected by the [[Onsruur]] (council of lords) in the [[687 DR|Year of the Wandering Sylph, 687 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|86}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 65: Khôltar, Part 16, A Brief History of Khôltar, Part 3}}

==History==
When Hulik Strathtar took up residence in [[High Khôltar]] as the Belarkh of the city, it marked the end of any semblance of independence of the office from the control of the Onsruur. The council of lords had been maneuvering and scheming since the first Belarkh, [[Embran Orntathtar]] in the [[619 DR|Year of Orcsfall, 619 DR]], to subvert the high office into becoming just a mouthpiece for the decrees of the Onsruur. With each successive appointment, the Belarkhs became more beholden to the Onsruur until finally, Hulik was wholly their man. Eventually, the Onsruur opened the office up to city-wide election, but since they were the only ones allowed to nominate candidates, all Belarkhs after Strathtar were trained and groomed by the council of lords and were firmly under their influence.
