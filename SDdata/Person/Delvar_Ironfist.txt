Delvar Ironfist was an adventuring dwarf fighter in the mid-late 14 century DR.
Delvar was young-looking, with a full, brown beard.
Of note, he was armed with a battle axe.
He was an adventurer. He sometimes still drank with his friend Gart.
Delvar was a friend of Gart Stonenose, whom he used to adventure with.
The adventuring party he was a part of in Freedale included him alongside Beldar, Silverleaf Halfmoon, Morganth, Slinker, and Lordan.
Prior to Gart settling in, he and Delvar used to adventure together.
In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Delvar Ironfist was part of an adventuring group in Freedale that may have rescued Taran Goldenstar, recovered the Orb of dragonkind, faced Gunter Weiss in Harrow Hill, and perhaps explored Azazabus dungeon under Mount Dread.
