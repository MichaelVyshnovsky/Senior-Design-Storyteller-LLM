'''Kiristen''' was [[Talieth]]'s chief maidservant. A beautiful [[Calishite]], when [[Sauk]] came to Talieth's room to report that the [[Old Man of the Mountain]] had spoken to [[Lewan]] while he was out, she attempted to stop him, as the lady was abed together with [[Valmir]]. Sauk continued in spite of her.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||24}}
