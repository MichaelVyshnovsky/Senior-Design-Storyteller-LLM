In addition, others had not seen enough of Hadrhune's shadowed face to make out his elven features (high eyebrows and long ears). However, it was clarified by [[Telamont Tanthul]] himself that Hadrhune was in fact an elf. Telamont says the following to [[Malik el Sami]] in ''[[The Sorcerer]]'': \"Hadrhune was not so different to you onceâ€”if you will forgive being compared to an elf.\" However, in ''[[Anauroch: The Empire of Shade]]'', it states that Hadrhune was a (human) shade. This is potentially an oversight.",

        "mainbody": "'''Hadrhune''' was an ambitious [[human]] [[shade]]<ref group=\"note\" name=\"race\" /> who served as the right hand of High Prince [[Telamont Tanthul]], ruler of [[Thultanthar]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Hadrhune fought his way up through the ranks of his peers, proving himself to be a capable manipulator as well as a determined and talented [[mage]]. With his skills (and the elimination of his rivals), he soon became Telamont's top agent and personal emissary. Using [[divination]] spells, he became probably the most knowledgeable shade in the entire city on matters of the world outside of [[Anauroch]], taking particular interest in the realm of [[Thay]] and the dungeon of [[Undermountain]]. Using resources diverted from the city, his agents scoured the ruins he took interest in, looking for lost [[Netherese]] [[magic]]. It was also he who suggested the destruction of any settlements near the enclave, seeing that modern-day adventurers could pose a serious threat to his peoples' plans of world domination.\n\nOn [[Nightal 5]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Hadrhune together with Most High Telamont [[summon]]ed [[Mephistopheles]] in order to gain more information about [[Kesson Rel]], who threatened the [[shadovar]]'s ongoing conquest of [[Sembia]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Hadrhune plotted with the leader of a hive of hated [[phaerimm]] to obtain a set of the ''[[Nether Scrolls]]''. In exchange for their aid, he taught them the secrets of the [[Shadow Weave]]. The ''Scrolls'' were in the form of a tree, the [[Quess'Ar'Teranthvar]], and required a complex ritual to return them to their proper form. However, a group of heroes were following the trail of the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar and had procured a way to destroy it before the ''Scrolls'' could be obtained. In doing so, Hadrhune flew to the site of the ritual atop his [[shadow dragon]] [[Delethyrsos]] to take his revenge, but didn't realize that the tree negated the [[dead-magic zone]] in the [[Weave]]. Hadrhune battled the heroes, but survived, most likely using his power to shadow walk to escape when the fight went against him.<ref group=\"note\">While ''Anauroch: The Empire of Shade'' says Hadrhune \"most likely fights to the bitter end\" but \"he might choose to try to escape using his shadow walk power\", his appearance in later sources suggests he escaped alive or was resurrected.\n\nHadrhune was still alive and well at the onset of the [[Second Sundering]] in the 1480s DR. However, he was dead by [[1487 DR]], with his resurrection prohibited by his master Telamont.<ref>",
        "Personality": "[[File:Hadrhunes.jpg|thumb|300px|''Hadrhune and his shadow double.'']]\nEvil through and through, Hadrhune was cold and calculating. He often used [[scry]]ing to realize his goals and had no qualms about spying on his allies, using bribes and personally crafting [[magic item]]s. He was ambitious as well, planning on obtaining for himself a position of governor of Thay or the [[North]] and then using the magic of the [[Red Wizard]]s or [[Halaster]] to cement his power in the hierarchy.\n\nAlthough he was still young for a shade, he fully intended to pursue [[lich]]dom when his body began to fail him.",
        "Symbol": "Hadrhune's personal sigil was a silver winged serpent coiling around a gray tower all on a black field."
