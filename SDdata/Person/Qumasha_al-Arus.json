However, Qumasha secretly drugged Najeeya with dreambliss to foster her addiction to the drug and keep her out of the picture.\nQumasha also helped train new flame mages who joined the ranks of the Brotherhood of the True Flame.\nQumasha was quite skilled at throwing daggers and carried several with her at all times. Each of these daggers was coated with dreambliss. She owned a sash of fire resistance, a ring of shocking grasp, and a potion of extra healing. She also carried several smoke spheres."
