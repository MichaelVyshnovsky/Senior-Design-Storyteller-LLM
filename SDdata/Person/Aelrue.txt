'''Aelrue''' was a [[moon elf]] neighbor of [[Elminster Aumar]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Aelrue was youthful and slim, with long legs and long waves of silvery-gray hair reaching as far down as her tiny waist. Her eyes were blue-gray, flecked with gold.

==History==
Aelrue had borrowed a pipe from [[Elminster Aumar]] in late [[Mirtul]] of {{yearlink|1360}}, and left it to [[Tarth Hornwood]], who came to her while looking for directions to [[Elminster]]'s home, to return it.
