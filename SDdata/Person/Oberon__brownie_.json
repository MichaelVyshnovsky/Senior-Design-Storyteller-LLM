        "mainbody": "'''Oberon''' was a [[brownie]] who inhabited a forest glade in [[the Vast]], in the environs of [[Ravens Bluff]], the Living City in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Oberon was like other brownies, a short fast-talking creature who loved fun, games, dancing songs, and musical [[toadstool]]s.",
        "Abilities": "Being a [[fey]], Oberon could use several spells once per day each, including ''[[protection from evil]]'', ''[[ventriloquism]]'', ''[[dancing lights]]'', ''[[continual light]]'', ''[[mirror image]]'', ''[[confusion]]'', and ''[[dimension door]]''.",
        "History": "Doing a spring or summer of the mid-14{{th}} century DR, Oberon fell victim to an affliction that rendered him insane and catatonic. Seven of his fellow brownies wept so loudly they attracted the attention of a group of adventurers from the Living City who were traveling the lush green forest at the time. Desperate to save Oberon, the usually shy brownies called to the heroes for help.\n\nOnce the brownies determined that the Living City fold held no ill intent, they revealed that Oberon was playing using his ''dimension door'' magic just before becoming afflicted. One of the heroes realized that the ground around the catatonic brownie was unusually soft due to [[mole]] tunnels underneath. Not just any mole, but a [[brain mole]]. Subsequently, the psionic beast was slain, and Oberon's mind returned to its healthy state. Thankful and joyous, brownies danced around the Living City heroes and awarded them a ''[[potion of plant growth]]''. Before parting ways, Oberon and the boonies warned the heroes of a strange hermit who surfaced recently in the woods – [[Mortimer Mittlemer]], recognizable by seven small yellow [[songbird]]s who flittered around him."
