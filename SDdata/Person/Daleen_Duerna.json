        "mainbody": "'''Daleen Duerna''' was the [[duergar]] Laird of [[Zortagra]] during the late 1480s DR.",
        "History": "Daleen became the reigning Laird fifty years before when she murdered her father.\n\nIn the late 1480s DR, her consort was captured by the [[fire giant]]s of [[Maerimydra]]. She led a raid to free him but with no success. Daleen however stole many treasures from [[Hledh Hellspawn]]'s lair. Among them was a samovar modeled like a [[marilith]]. She drank from it and was possessed by the [[demon lord]]–inflicted madness, which soon spread to all the city.\n\nDaleen remained in her throne room assisted by the [[succubus]] [[Ashroot]] until an adventuring party, hired by [[Elanil Elassidil]] to investigate crazed duergar, arrived in Zortagra. Somehow, the adventurers stopped the spread of madness by taking away the samovar.",
        "Personality": "Under the demon lord–inflicted madness, Daleen believed herself to be [[Deep Duerra]] reincarnated and was afraid of an imminent war with [[mind flayer]]s."
