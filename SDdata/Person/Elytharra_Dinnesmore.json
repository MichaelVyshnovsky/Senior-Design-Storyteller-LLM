        "mainbody": "Elytharra Dinnesmore was a half-elf enchantress from Neverwinter active in the early 14 century DR.\nElytharra met Ulbrec Dinnesmore in the city of Neverwinter. He was a military commander of Neverwinter at the time. They eventually married, and when he retired, they moved to Targos, where Ulbrec took up the seat of the towns Speaker and Elytharraâ€“on the advisers role. She spent her time in Targos gathering and deciphering books and magic scrolls of the frozen region.\nIn the , Targos became targeted by the Legion of the Chimera. Elytharra and Ulbrec started receiving news of inserting goblin attacks in the north, and the Lord Speaker ordered the construction of a palisade around Targos. This was a wise course of action as within several months since the first goblin attacks, Targos was besieged. Ulbrec petitioned Luskan and Neverwinter for military aid, but none arrived. The attacks were a mystery, and little was known of the enemy forces location. Elytharra unsuccessfully attempted to divine the goblin armys location, and after diviner Valin Geldencross of Bryn Shander fell ill, she abandoned the attempts. Elytharra was present in Targos during the Legions use of tunnels and magic to attack the towns harbors, and shortly after, she was among the city defenders when the Legion of the Chimera helmed a full-on assault on the towns fortifications.\nThe same year she helped a group of mercenaries from Luskan to create an enchanted spectral blade called Sorrows Tear. Another enchanted weapon created by her was the Goblin Hunter that Elytharra used to defend herself from the growing goblin threat to the Ten-Towns."
