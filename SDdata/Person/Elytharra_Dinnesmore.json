        "mainbody": "'''Elytharra Dinnesmore''' was a [[half-elf]] [[Enchanter|enchantress]] from [[Neverwinter]] active in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Make fast friends with Ulbred's wife, the elven woman. She's a sharp one, she is – her eyes and thoughts are like ice, cold and sharp, but her heart has a kind bent, like the dawn of a spring morning. Her heart is in Targos, and ye can trust her.''|[[Firtha Kerdos]]}}",
        "History": "Elytharra met [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]] in the city of Neverwinter. He was a military commander of Neverwinter at the time. They eventually married, and when he retired, they moved to [[Targos]], where Ulbrec took up the seat of the town's Speaker and Elytharra–on the adviser's role. She spent her time in Targos gathering and deciphering [[book]]s and magic [[scroll]]s of the frozen region.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Targos became targeted by the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. Elytharra and Ulbrec started receiving news of inserting [[goblin]] attacks in the north, and the Lord Speaker ordered the construction of a palisade around Targos. This was a wise course of action as within several months since the first goblin attacks, Targos was besieged. Ulbrec petitioned Luskan and Neverwinter for military aid, but none arrived. The attacks were a mystery, and little was known of the enemy forces' location. Elytharra unsuccessfully attempted to divine the goblin army's location, and after diviner [[Valin Geldencross]] of [[Bryn Shander]] fell ill, she abandoned the attempts. Elytharra was present in Targos during the Legion's use of tunnels and magic to attack the town's harbors, and shortly after, she was among the city defenders when the Legion of the Chimera helmed a full-on assault on the town's fortifications.\n\nThe same year she helped a group of mercenaries from Luskan to create an [[enchanted]] spectral blade called ''[[Sorrow's Tear]].'' Another enchanted weapon created by her was the ''[[Goblin Hunter]]'' that Elytharra used to defend herself from the growing goblin threat to the Ten-Towns."
