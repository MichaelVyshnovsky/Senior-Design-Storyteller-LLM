==Description==
He wore a brown [[kimono]] and [[ring mail]], and was armed with [[katana]] and [[wakizashi]].

==Abilities==
He was adept in [[horse]]manship, calligraphy, painting, and poetry.

==History==

One night in high summer in {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, Benju ordered Tsukku to meet a group of adventurers who were staying at [[The Waiting Stone]], a local ''[[ryokan]]'' (inn). He was to invite them to a midnight meeting with the daimyo at his [[Donjon (Aru)|donjon]], and escort them there, and not take no for an answer. Tsukku privately felt the adventurers were most likely rogues and ronin. He met them with a group of seven other samurai, and later escorted them back.
