The Black Viper was a notorious pickpocket, burglar, mugger, and assassin of Waterdeep who died in the late 14 century DR after a long criminal career.
The title of Black Viper was originally claimed by Alauneth Orrane in the mid-14 century DR. The original Black Viper focused on stealing from nobles and rich merchants. She had a habit of barely escaping capture in her daring heists and always left a calling card signed "The Black Viper." Some time around 1368 DR she allied herself with the Shadow Thieves in Waterdeep and acted as a scout and recruiter for the organization, eventually rising to the title of Silhouette of Shadows. Around this time she also began stealing information which she used to blackmail and extort rich merchants into making purchases on behalf of the Thieves, in order to make them harder to trace.
One century after the death of the original Black Viper, in the late 15 century DR,Â she returned to Waterdeep to continue her criminal activities. Rumors passed between the noble houses of Waterdeep discussing how and why shed returned, but none were true. In reality, the Black Vipers title and persona were adopted by Esvele Rosznar, a brash young noble woman of Waterdeep who wanted a way to escape her day-to-day life.
