{{quote|You know not the scope of my power!|Sofina}}

==Description==
[[File:Afflicted Sofina.png|thumb|left|250px|''Sofina looking a bit under the weather.'']]
As a Red Wizard, Sofina had a bald head adorned with [[tattoo]]s that represented magical sigils. She had pale skin that darkened around her eyes, hinting at her undead nature. This was but a disguise, however, and her true appearance was decayed, gaunt, and dead-eyed.

She typically wore [[robes]] with a large cowl to cover her bald head and tattoos. It changed color at a thought or with her mood, shifting from the dark blue she habitually wore as a disguise among others to a crimson red when she wished to show off her status as a Red Wizard.

==Personality==
{{quote|''She's just rich and eccentric. That’s all. It’s perfectly natural to wear a hood and sit alone in a room playing funeral music in the middle of the day.''|Edgin Darvis's first thoughts on Lady Sofina}}
Sofina was a shrewd and patient schemer. She was aloof and disinterested in making friends, rejecting all attempts at amiability. Szass Tam called her the disciple upon whom he had always most relied. She despised the living and sought to see them all slain and raised again as creatures of undeath like her. She also despised Forge for his false charm, arrogance, and jests.

Owing to the fear that Red Wizards received outside Thay, and to conceal her true intentions in Neverwinter, Sofina kept secret her affiliations and concealed her bald head and tattoos.

==Abilities==
[[File:Honor Among Thieves Chain lightning.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''For some, meeting Sofina can be an electrifying experience.'']]
Sofina had advanced skills in spellcasting and specialized in the [[school of magic|school]] of [[necromancy]], including spells of fear and death magic. As a wizard, she commanded a variety of [[spell]]s, including ''[[mage hand]]'', ''[[message]]'', and ''[[prestidigitation]]'' at will; ''[[bestow curse]]'', ''[[Bigby's hand]]'' (which took on a black-nailed, skinless appearance), ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[mage armor]]'', ''[[Otiluke's resilient sphere]]'', and ''[[thunderwave]]'' twice a day each; and ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'', ''[[finger of death]]'', and ''[[time stop]]'' once a day each, as well as ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'' and ''[[animate objects]]''. She could also hurl a ''[[meteor swarm]]'', evoking four orbs that exploded in flames over a radius of {{SI|40|feet|long=yes}} wide, and could do so up to {{SI|1|mile|k|long=yes}}. Other spells she could cast included ''[[chain lightning]]''.

As an undead creature, she could strike with a necrotic power, either with a touch or up to {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} away. She was naturally resistant to such energy herself.

She could summon a [[wraith]] that was the spirit of a Thayan assassin. It appeared up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} from her and obeyed her commands. This wraith served for up to 1 hour, unless it or Sofina was destroyed or dismissed it.This wraith may be intended to be the undead Thayan assassin [[Dralas]], but in ''Honor Among Thieves'' he is not summoned but arrives by boat as a regular creature.

She was knowledgeable in history and [[the Art]], and possessed good insight and perception.

==Possessions==
Sofina wore a magical [[robe]] that protected her somewhat from attacks and harmful effects. She kept concealed a ''[[Red Wizard blade]]'', a necromantic weapon that prevented resurrection and healing.

Lady Sofina owned a gated and fenced townhouse in [[Longsaddle]]. After her encounter with [[Forge Fitzwilliam]], Sofina placed armed guards in front of her home. The building itself appeared unwelcoming, with its boarded-up front windows and large intimidating reinforced [[oak]]en doors. The fence surrounded the property with [[rose]] beds planted alongside the walkway to the front door. The townhouse's back window opened to the formal gardens surrounding a stone fountain. The interior was darkly decorated with expensive plush sofas and wingback chairs. The sitting room's centerpiece was a grand [[piano]] drowned in the room's shadows that the home's owner liked to play.

==History==
===Early History===
[[File:Honor Among Thieves Sofina in Thay.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''Sofina and her fellow Red Wizards trapping people in the Beckoning Death.'']]
Sofina was purported to be some three hundred years old as of the late 1400s DR.

In the mid-1370s [[DR]], on [[Kythorn 19|the eve]] of a [[summer solstice]], Sofina joined other Red Wizards who served Szass Tam atop the [[Citadel]], his headquarters.<ref group="note">''Honor Among Thieves'' only says "the capital" of Thay, which at the time should be [[Eltabbar]]. However, the Citadel is presumed instead, owing to its apparent depiction and characters like Xenk bearing Tam's tattoo. Moreover, Xenk may be referring to it as the present capital.<ref group="note">''Honor Among Thieves'' mentions only the eve of the solstice; due to the presence of sun-like symbols in the crowd, this is presumed to be the summer solstice.According to history books a century later, Szass Tam had called all the other zulkirs of Thay and all the people of the [[Thaymount (tharch)|Thaymount tharch]], [[Xenk Yendar]] and his parents among them, to a grand celebration atop the Citadel. But it was all a lie—instead, Szass used the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'', thereby creating an army of undead under his control for his coup and following conquest of Thay. Sofina and the other Red Wizards serving Szass Tam slew or trapped all who tried to flee.<ref group="note">It is difficult to reconcile Xenk's account and the scenes in ''Honor Among Thieves'' with the established history of Szass Tam, the zulkirs, and Thay, as Tam's betrayal here contradicts his betrayals elsewhere. It appears to conflate the zulkirs gathering at the Citadel in ''The Crimson Gold'' in 1373 DR; the meeting of the [[Council of Zulkirs]] in Eltabbar, the start of the War of the Zulkirs, and Tam's takeover of Thay in ''Unclean'' in 1375 DR; and a later new event of Tam creating his undead armies from his subjects. Since this is presented as a story from a book a century later and from Xenk's childhood memories, it's presumed to be a case of unreliable narration or movie dramatization.

===Quest for the Red Horn===
However, Szass Tam would later lose the strange red horn that was central to the ''beckoning death'', with the Harpers apparently having acquired or stolen it.{{Speculation}} They stored it within the vault of [[Korinn's Keep]], far from the lich's reach.From ''Honor Among Thieves'', it is unknown how the horn managed to pass from Szass Tam's possession and into the Harpers', and when this occurred. Most likely, they stole it to prevent him using it again. While speculative, the event is included here for context. Szass Tam sent Sofina to recover it.{{Speculation}}

To this end, in the mid-1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Sofina disguised herself and traveled to [[Targos]], one of the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]], to enlist the services of the ex-Harper turned thief [[Edgin Darvis]], whose wife [[Zia]] had been murdered by Red Wizards nine years earlier.<ref group="note">It might be supposed that, after Edgin revealed himself as a Harper to the Red Wizards, Sofina and others were watching him even this far back, and perhaps had even killed his wife to cause him to lose faith in the group. For aid, Sofina allied herself with his treacherous partner, the confidence trickster Forge Fitzwilliam. She wanted to hire them to help her steal the treasures of Korinn's Keep, a Harper storehouse that only a Harper could enter—Edgin. He refused, however, still having some standards. But Forge promised they would find there a [[Tablet of Reawakening]], a magical relic capable of [[resurrection|resurrecting one deceased soul]]. Against his better judgement but with hopes of restoring Zia to life, Edgin relented and acquiesced to Forge's and Sofina's scheme.

[[File:Honor Among Thieves publicity image 3.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Sofina taking the horn.'']]
Donning his old Harper uniform, Edgin led the team to Korinn's Keep and gained admittance. While the thieves helped themselves to the treasures of the vault, and Sofina claimed the red horn, Edgin went for the Tablet of Reawakening. But the poor thief triggered an alarm, summoning Harper guards, whom Sofina struck with ''[[chain lightning]]'', to Edgin's dismay. She then cast ''[[time stop]]'', which the [[sorcerer]] Simon could not ''[[counterspell]]''. It trapped the guards, Holga, and Edgin while she, Forge, and Simon made their escape. Afterward, Sofina tried to kill Simon, as they'd never intended for him to escape Korinn's Keep, and the sorcerer only just got away with his life.

===The Doom of Neverwinter===
However, Szass Tam did not merely want his horn back, but instead set Sofina a greater task. and fall into a vegetative state, Then Forge Fitzwilliam seized the opportunity, waging a political campaign for lordship of Neverwinter financed with his ill-gotten gains. Successful, he became Lord of Neverwinter with Sofina as his chief advisor and Edgin's daughter [[Kira]] as his ward. They all moved into [[Castle Never]], where cast ''[[Mordenkainen's arcane seal]]'' on the treasure vault.

But Forge and Sofina's real scheme was far larger and more terrible in scope than simply taking over Neverwinter. One of the Forge's main acts was to revive the [[High Sun Games]], a monster-filled bloodsport that had been banned by Lord Neverember as he considered them too brutal. Forge also ordered the construction of the [[Neverwinter arena]] to host the Games.{{speculation}}<ref group="note">As no structure of the kind has been seen or mapped in Neverwinter before, the arena is presumed to be new and built by Forge. The first Games were to be held in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} allegedly as a way of bringing the city together, as well as many visitors from outside Neverwinter. This was quite true, and exactly what Sofina and Szass Tam desired.

[[File:Honor Among Thieves Sofina, Forge, and Kira.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''Almost like a happy family.'']]
Meanwhile, after two years imprisoned in [[Revel's End]], Edgin and Holga escaped and came to Castle Never to retrieve Kira and the Tablet of Reawakening, but they had a less-than-warm reception. But Sofina told Blackwood to kill them in secret, though they would escape.

Later, from the shadows of Sofina's office in Castle Never, Szass sent an image of himself to communicate with her, giving counsel her that her long work was close to completion. Forge and Sofina then showed the wealthy guests [[Din Caldwell]] and [[Porb Piiradost]] around Castle Never, boasting of its upgraded security and suitability for storing the wealth they'd brought to gamble on the games in its vault; Sofina declined to elaborate on her ''Mordenkainen's arcane seal''. However, they were interrupted when Sofina sensed the presence of a [[wild shape]]d [[druid]]—[[Doric]], a new ally of Edgin and Holga—spying on them. Sofina led the hunt, blasting the walls with her ''thunderwave'' and ordering the castle guards to give chase. Although Sofina sensed Doric in other forms, including as an [[axe beak]], the druid got away. Forge was correct in his suspicion that this was Edgin's doing, but Sofina vowed to send her own forces to get rid of the gang.

[[File:Honor Among Thieves - Sofina, Dralas, and Blackwood.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Sofina and Dralas meet and share their secret plans.'']]
She sent for the Thayan assassin [[Dralas]] and his band of six fellow warriors. Sofina, Blackwood, and his Neverwintan guards met Dralas at the docks as he arrived by boat on the [[Neverwinter River]]. Sofina ordered him to hunt down and kill Edgin, Holga, Simon, and Doric. But first, she wanted Dralas to dispatch Blackwood and his guards because they'd failed to stop Edgin and Holga's escape. Dralas slew them all single-handedly.

Finally, on the day of the High Sun Games and the culmination of her long work, Sofina somehow detected that Edgin, Holga, Simon, and Doric had infiltrated Castle Never, as part of their attempted heist of the treasure vault and mission to rescue Kira. Fortunately, she had placed an ''Evard's black tentacles'' trap in the empty vault, which ensnared Simon and Holga. Meanwhile, Sofina used ''[[disguise self]]'' magic to pose as Kira and waited in the girl's room for Edgin. Finding her, he confessed he ''had'' been terrible father, for abandoning his daughter to resurrect his wife, not the mother she'd never known. But it fell on mocking ears—laughing manically, Sofina threw off her disguise and caught him in her ''Evard's black tentacles'' spell. Then Forge entered and taunted him, but Edgin pleaded for a fighting chance, that is, to compete in the High Sun Games. Though Forge was reluctant, perhaps to spare Edgin a fate worse than death, Sofina agreed that they should suffer for defeating her assassins.

[[File:Honor Among Thieves beckoning death 2.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''Sofina's half-time show was a killer.'']]
Afterward, Sofina took her place in the luxury balcony over the arena, with Forge Fitzwilliam and Din Caldwell, Porb Piiradost, and the wealthy gamblers. At last, their respective schemes had come to fruition: Forge had stolen the riches of the castle and his wealthy guests and had it all loaded aboard a ship for his getaway as he abandoned the city, and Sofina had all the people gathered together in the arena—a perfect target for the Beckoning Death, turning the whole city into undead, and bringing about Szass Tam's plan to seize control of Neverwinter. Though Forge tried an amiable farewell, Sofina coldly ordered him to get out of her city, in a hurry to be rid of him now their partnership was at an end. Chanting the arcane phrases, she finally invoked the ''horn of beckoning death'' and levitated above the arena, causing storms to brew over the city, crimson strands to funnel down through the horn, and red smoke to fill the viewing chamber and turn the wealthy gamblers and servants into ravening undead. The smoke poured down into the arena below, but before it could engulf the spectators, Sofina saw them all leaving, following a trail of treasure spilling from a ''[[portal]]'' in a [[hot-air balloon]]—the doing of Edgin and his friends. With the Beckoning Death wasted,{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Legendary Magic Items}} all of Sofina's patient work and scheming had come to naught.

[[File:Sofina.png|thumb|right|350px|''Doric as an owlbear charging on Sofina.'']]
Enraged, Sofina assaulted the thieves from atop the arena, first hurling a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' into the streets below. The fighting was furious. Sofina first grappled with Doric, who'd wild shaped into the form a [[snowy owlbear]] and then animated a statue of a juvenile [[gold dragon]] to aid her. Next, Sofina briefly trapped Edgin and Holga in an ''Otiluke's resilient sphere'', sending them rolling through the streets while she engaged in a hand-to-hand spell duel with Simon—literally so, with her ''Bigby's hand'' grappling with his ''[[Maximilian's earthen grasp]]''. Finally, all four companions fought the Red Wizard together until Sofina cast a ''[[time stop]]'' spell, presumably gaining the upper hand. Angry, Sofina confronted and threatened Edgin with eternal suffering for foiling her scheme—only to be surprised that he was not frozen in time at all as the invisible Kira put a ''[[magic-suppression cuff]]'' from the games on her wrist, negating Sofina's spellcasting abilities. Doric wild shaped back into an owlbear and put the defenseless Red Wizard down for good. But Sofina had one last curse, however—during the fray, she had stabbed Holga with her ''Red Wizard blade'', and afterward the companions found her dying.Being undead, it is not necessarily confirmed that Sofina ''is'' dead, or rather, destroyed. If she is a lich, then she may resurrect at her [[phylactery]] if she has one.

With the negation of Sofina's magic, the former Lord of Neverwinter, [[Dagult Neverember]] awoke and resumed his reign.
