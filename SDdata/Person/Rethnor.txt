'''Rethnor''' was the leader of [[Ship Rethnor]] and one of the five [[High Captains (Luskan)|High Captains]] of the city of [[Luskan]]. Along with the others he was an experienced adventurer and a former pirate.<ref name="VoloN-p111" > 

Rethnor's lead ship was the ''[[Cutlass (ship)|Cutlass]].''

==Description==
Rethnor was a large, strong man with a long black beard, bushy eyebrows, and piercing blue eyes. He wielded a sword in his left hand and a dagger in his right. In [[1361 DR]], he lost his swordhand in a battle with [[Fyodor]], but it was later restored by the [[drow]] [[priestess]] [[Shakti Hunzrin]], who was able to command it.

==History==
In [[1361 DR]], Rethnor was involved with the [[Kraken Society]] in a conspiracy to turn the [[Lords' Alliance]] (especially [[Waterdeep]]) against [[Ruathym]]. The Kraken Society assigned him to ally with [[Shakti Hunzrin]], a [[drow]] [[priestess]] searching for [[Liriel Baenre]], who was journeying to [[Ruathym]]. The plot was discovered by the Ruathen with the help of the crew of the ''[[Elfmaid (ship)|Elfmaid]]'' and Luskan's navy, led by Rethnor, was defeated.

In [[1376 DR]], Rethnor died of old age (although it is implied his son "helped" him along) and was replaced as High Captain by his son, [[Kensidan]] the Crow.

==Relationships==
Rethnor was an ally to the [[Kraken Society]]. 

High Captain [[Suljack]] was his cousin.
