Ramos was the paramount of the storm giant aerie of Lake Woe mountain in 1366 DR.
Ramos had pale violet skin and blue-black hair that was very long and unkempt. He was clean-shaven. Ramos typically wore a simple tunic with a large amount of silver jewelry. His eyes were silver-colored.
Ramos bore a sword in battle that was twenty-feet long. It was notched and rusted.
In 1364 DR, a festival was held in honor of Ramos, who at that time was of second rank in the ordning. During the feast, the sun shone on the aerie for the first time in ten years, and this was seen as a omen that Ramos was to replace the current paramount as the new leader.
By 1369 DR, Ramos was no longer paramount, having been replaced by a giant named Anastes. Anastes, Ramos, and four others were summoned magically by Lanaxis to defend him when he needed to rest during his kidnapping of Queen Brianna and her son Kaedlaw. They heeded his call. Ramos and a giant named Nikol cooked a moose for Brianna to eat, but during this time, Tavis Burdun and armies of giant-kin attacked. Nikol and Ramos were ordered by Anastes to deal with the verbeegs. Ramos fate in the ensuing battle was never recorded.
