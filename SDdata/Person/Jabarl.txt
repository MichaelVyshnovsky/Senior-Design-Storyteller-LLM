'''Jabarl the Orc-Biter''' was a member of the [[Stone-Cold Reavers]], a group of reckless adventurers who made their living sometimes as sellswords and sometimes as brigands.

==Personality==
Jabarl was a rugged, ill-tempered thug who intimidated people to get what he wanted. If that didn't work, he resorted to brute force. Jabarl liked to take care of [[horse]]s, however, which could calm his violent nature.

==History==
Jabarl had a criminal past but always managed to avoid getting caught for his crimes. With the Stone-Cold Reavers he tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] from its lair, [[Icespire Hold]]. However, Cryovain hadn't amassed any treasure yet.
