            "The guide of Torzac": "The local halfling guide was hired by the scholar, Wently Kelso, to escort him around the area close to Torzac. Kelso remarked that Insal was of minimal intelligence, but still used him in his investigations of the little-known village. The forest close to the area was overrun by wolves, and Insal and his employer were often on the run. One night, two female warriors ([[Calandra]] and [[Ira]]) came through their camp. Kelso tried to ask them information about the ''[[starfire]]'' scepter, but they were uninformed, and so Insal leered at them, and they left in a huff. Insal and Kelso continued to look for signs of [[drow]] structures, but were unsuccessful. Kelso discharged the halfling, who seemed unhappy to go, but the scholar paid him a few shiny baubles, rusted weapons and dented copper coins.",
