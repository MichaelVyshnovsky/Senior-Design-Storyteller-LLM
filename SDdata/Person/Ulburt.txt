Ulburt was a Harper in Scornubel during the mid-14 century DR.
Ulburt was enormous and bulky, with a chest covered in scars.
He carried a spike-handled axe.
He guarded what appeared to be a Harper hideout.
He knew of Marlel and Rildra.
In late , Ulburt was in Scornubel. Marlel sought him, wanting to talk to Rildra, to get access to Pharaulee after Ulburt informed him that Rildra was dead, Marlel left directly to talk to Pharaulee and left Ulburt to guard Shandril Shessair and her husband, Narm Tamaraith, in the meantime.
Strangely, a pair of eyes looked out of Ulburt at the two guests, belonging to the face of an old, gray-haired woman.
