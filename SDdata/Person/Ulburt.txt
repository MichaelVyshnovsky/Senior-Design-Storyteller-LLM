'''Ulburt''' was a [[Harper]] in [[Scornubel]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Ulburt was enormous and bulky, with a chest covered in scars.

==Possessions==
He carried a spike-handled axe.

==Activities==
He guarded what appeared to be a [[Harper]] hideout.

==Relationships==
He knew of [[Marlel]] and [[Rildra]].

==History==
In late {{yearlink|1357}}, Ulburt was in [[Scornubel]]. Marlel sought him, wanting to talk to Rildra, to get access to [[Pharaulee]]; after Ulburt informed him that Rildra was dead, Marlel left directly to talk to Pharaulee and left Ulburt to guard [[Shandril Shessair]] and her husband, [[Narm Tamaraith]], in the meantime.

Strangely, a pair of eyes looked out of Ulburt at the two guests, belonging to the face of an old, gray-haired woman.
