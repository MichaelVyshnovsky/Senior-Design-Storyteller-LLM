==Activities==
As part of her scholarly pursuits, Riftel studied [[elemental weevil]]s that she found on the slopes of [[Mount Hotenow]].

==Relationships==
Riftel had an assistant named [[Gerad Kinesward]], whom she tasked with her more mundane activities. She felt Gerad would do well to gain some real-life experience and learn to get herself out of difficult situations such as those she sent her into.

==History==
Following the [[siege of Neverwinter]], in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Riftel set herself up at an outpost of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] in the [[Neverwinter/River District|River District]], which had been taken over by the [[Many-Arrows]] [[orc]]s. Riftel wanted to begin a parlay with [[Hulgen Proudfist|Hulgen]], the leader of the [[Proudfist]] [[half-orc]] tribe, and convince them to side with Neverwinter over the kingdom of Many-Arrows. However, she felt her shyness dealing with them made her appear weak and distrusted, so she requested a half-elf adventurer to find and negotiate with them.

Meanwhile, Riftel lost six of her elemental weevils and naturally sent Gerad to recover them, though she became frightened and hid amidst the orc camp.
