        "Description": "Oyster Boy was a young male [[rock gnome]] with a light skin tone, blue eyes, and curly light chestnut hair.",
        "History": "Oyster Boy Dringo was fired to man the kennel outside the Sword Coast Couriers office at some point before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. He was put to work under an angry dog trainer named [[Mar'hyah]], who verbally abused Dringo and physically the Couriers' three dogs: [[Scratch (dog)|Scratch]], [[Gustav]], and [[Zola]]. Mar'hyah's disdain for Dringo was such that she requested Postmaster [[Danzo Arkwright]] to dock the boy's pay. The adventuring band known as the [[Absolute Adversaries]], who might've rescued and adopted Scratch after his courier master was slain, may have had confronted Mar'hyah over her cruelty. One of the possible but unconfirmed outcomes of the confrontation was Oyster Boy Dringo becoming the man in charge of the hound kennels â€“ a new, much kinder master."
