He was put to work under an angry dog trainer named Marhyah, who verbally abused Dringo and physically the Couriers three dogs Scratch, Gustav, and Zola. Marhyahs disdain for Dringo was such that she requested Postmaster Danzo Arkwright to dock the boys pay. The adventuring band known as the Absolute Adversaries, who mightve rescued and adopted Scratch after his courier master was slain, may have had confronted Marhyah over her cruelty. One of the possible but unconfirmed outcomes of the confrontation was Oyster Boy Dringo becoming the man in charge of the hound kennels â€“ a new, much kinder master."
