        "History": "In 1489 DR, he and five other men went inside the forest to recover [[Halvin Graingle]] before he disturbed the [[fey]]s. However, they were too late because the [[hag]] [[Jeny Greenteeth]] had killed him. Rerk and his fellows found their way to the hag.{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|10-11}}\n\nSome days later, Jeny returned to Kabel's Hill and nailed Rerk to the town's signpost with one of her hairpins. The hag cut out his tongue and replaced his eyes with polished [[jet]] stones. An adventuring party happened to be there and tried to save Rerk."
