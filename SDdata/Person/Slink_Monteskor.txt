Slink Monteskor was the main spymaster of the Xanathar Thieves Guild of Skullport.
Slink was a potbellied fellow with an eidetic memory, allowing him to remember all that he read. The Xanathar used him as bookkeeper and information storehouse. Slink also commanded Xanathars network of spies and had information about all the guilds operations, and all the other masters sent reports to him. The Xanathar trusted him and knew, by use of spells, that Slink was loyal but kept a very close eye on him if someone captured him, they could learn all about the Xanathar Guild.
