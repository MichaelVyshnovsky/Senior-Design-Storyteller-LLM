        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], Ghevel was hired by the [[drow]] party of [[Quenthel Baenre]] and [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] to travel the [[Darklake]]. When duergar authorities tried to arrest the drow group, fearing they had discovered the plan for the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]], Pharaun magically compelled Ghevel to flee the city. The drow abandoned Ghevel and his boat when they had escaped. It is unknown what happened to him."
