She convinced him to yield up his teleport ring.\nHe was unable to return in time for the Council of the Dragon. Later, Talonar Winter and him were the ones who reported the death of everyone in Staghaven House to Glathra, including Rorstil Hallowdant, who wasnt supposed to be there.\nEskrel was among the retinue protecting King Foril Obarskyr I during the Festival of Handras, when the Wizards of War became aware of a plot to draw out the blueflame ghosts and anticipated a dangerous situation for the King. Foril insisted in a different tactic, where the ghosts would be lured out of the palace they succeeded on that."
