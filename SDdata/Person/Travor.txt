==Description==
Travor was a chestnut-haired [[human]] male dressed in olive and tan commoner's garb.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the village of Imnesvale faced a slew of disappearances, and locals did not hesitate to blame the legendary [[Umar Witch]]. Travor spent all of his time drinking in the [[Umar Inn]] by day and sleeping in the inn's barn on a haystack or in the woods. When the killings started, the Umar Inn's proprietor [[Vincenzo]] allowed poor Travor to sleep in the attic. Travor was unsure if the Umar Witch was responsible for the strife, but he had witnessed strange shadows moving across the village's streets at night. He tried to warn the villagers of the shadows, but none in Imnesvale wanted to listen to a drunk.
