When Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard was abducted from Waukeens Rest in the , Zarys ordered her men to prepare for the demolition of their underground hideout. She knew that Baldurian authorities would have to blame someone for the Dukes disappearance and would not allow Zhentarim operations to be compromised.
