==Description==
Cheddah was extremely obese. He always wore ceremonial battle armor with gold buckles and polished medals.

==Personality==
Many considered him to be a boisterous buffoon who lacked any real talent outside of his birthright.

==Abilities==
Cheddah was a poor tracker, did not understand religion, and lacked etiquette. His comprehension of military tactics was appalling. Open mockery was averted because of his skill with the bow and his extensive knowledge of ships. It was said he could hit a fleeing antelope's eye at 300 yards (274 meters). He could list the complete statistics of every ship in the royal navy.

==Possessions==
Cheddah owned ''[[armor of swimming]] +2'', a ''long sword +3'', ''composite long bow +2'', ''[[ring of invisibility]]'', ''[[gauntlets of dexterity]]'', and 2 ''[[potion of extra healing|potions of extra healing]]''.

==Activities==
Prince Cheddah was an admiral in the royal navy of Huzuz.

==Relationships==
Cheddah was the younger brother of Prince [[Tannous al-Assad]] and paternal uncle to the [[Grand Caliph]] [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]]. He was the youngest brother of the previous Grand Caliph [[Achmed al-Assad]]. Khalil considered Cheddah one of his favorite relatives.

==History==
Cheddah taught Khalil how to sail and shoot a bow when the young Grand Caliph was growing up.
