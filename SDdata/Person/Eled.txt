'''Eled the Desecrator''' was an infamous champion of the evil races of [[Faerûn]], who lived long before the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Eled was a cruel mercenary who gladly fought for any evil creature that could afford his services. Eventually, he gained infamy for his fearsome power. One of the mercenary's clients was a group of [[maedar]] and [[medusa]]e who paid him with a powerful [[enchanted]] [[granite]] bludgeon: the ''[[Flail of Mae]]''. Eled the Desecrator wielded the weapon with a frightening efficiency until the end of his days, many years before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}.
