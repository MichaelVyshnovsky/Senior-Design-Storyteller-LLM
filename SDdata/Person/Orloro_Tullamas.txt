Orloro Tullamas was a plump merchant inhabiting Tulmon along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Orloro had a commanding voice and enjoyed chuckling.
His store, Tullamas Sales on Shandlas Street, focused on the sale of dry goods, carrying items from "gloves to grain and candles to carts."
Orloro was the nemesis of Horomel Ibrin, believing the younger merchants of Tulmon should focus on their own profits and steer clear of larger politics.
