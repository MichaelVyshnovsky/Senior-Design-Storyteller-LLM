'''Rivenaurlgoth the Darkly Pious''' was a [[red dragon|red]] [[great wyrm]]  who lived in the [[Marching Mountains]] of [[Calimshan]] in the 3{{rd}} century before [[Dalereckoning]]. He was the most powerful servant of [[Bane]] of the day.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|-284}}, followers of the god [[Anachtyr]] killed the [[dragon]], took its skull and gilded it in [[gold]], and carved the [[Myth of the Four Rivers]] into its teeth. Later, [[Church of Bane|Banites]] stole the skull and kept it hidden to preserve their [[deity]]'s fearsome reputation. Over time, the followers of Bane forgot exactly why they were hiding Rivenaurlgoth's skull, but they still felt compelled to keep it so out of greed. As of {{Yearlink|1370}}, the skull had passed into the hands of worshipers of [[Cyric]], who kept it in the [[Mountain of Skulls]] in [[Tethyr]]. Rivenaurlgoth's skull was considered a particularly [[holy]] item of the [[Church of Cyric]], with access restricted to only one worshiper at a time.
