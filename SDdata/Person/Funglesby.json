        "Description": "Funglesby was a [[gold dwarven]] woman with short curly brown hair and a clean-shaven face. She wore a simple [[leather armor]] jerkin and carried a small [[crossbow]].",
        "Abilities": "Funglesby had access to a ranger's [[spell]]s, including ''[[poison spray]]'', ''[[hail of thorns]]'', and ''[[protection from poison]]''. She was accompanied by her loyal [[animal companion]] â€“ a large [[armor]]ed [[wolf]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], [[Farlin]] led a gang of Guild members in dealing with the [[Stone Lord]] and his men. The new kingpin secretly served the [[Absolute]] and was trying to remove the Guild's influence from across the Gate. Farlin's group faced a band of the Stone Lord's men led by the [[tiefling]] [[Cairos]], including Funglesby. They clashed under the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge in [[Rivington]] over a shipment of supplies. However, the meeting devolved into a battle and either of squads's fate remained uncertain."
