        "mainbody": "'''Aeroth of Silverymoon''' was a War Captain and champion of [[Silverymoon]] during the [[Second Trollwar]] in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]]. Later in life, he founded the city of [[Vlan]] on the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|24}}<ref group=\"note\">It is likely that both Vlan and its \"merchant houses\" are not intended to be canon. The city of Vlan, as well as the role of Aeroth's descendants in the Moonshae Isles, were originally mentioned by [[Ed Greenwood]] in 1983's ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' [[Dragon magazine 74|Issue #74]], predating the release of the original ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]'' in 1987. The Moonshae Isles were changed significantly in the official [[TSR]] version of the [[Forgotten Realms]], and Vlan has never been included on any canon maps or descriptions of the Moonshaes. However, the text from the ''Dragon'' article was replicated (possibly in error) in 1988's ''[[The Magister (sourcebook)|The Magister]]'', hence it is included here as canon information.",
        "Description": "Aeroth was renowned as a champion and hero of the [[North]]. By the time he left Silverymoon, he had gray hair.",
        "Possessions": "Famously, Aeroth wielded ''[[Taragarth]]'', an [[enchanted]] [[bastard sword]] that came to be known as \"the Bloodbrand\" in his hands.",
        "History": "During the events of the Second Trollwar in the {{YearlinkName|952}}, Aeroth led an alliance between Silverymoon, [[Ahghairon]] of [[Waterdeep]], and [[Samular Caradoon]] of [[Tyr]] against the [[troll]]s, and for this task, he was gifted the mighty sword ''Taragarth''. He fought in the grueling nine-day [[Long Battle]], distinguishing both himself and his sword. That battle ultimately broke the trolls, and the alliance would go on to clear the [[Evermoors]] of the foul creatures.\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|982}}, Aeroth departed from Silverymoon alongside his wife and six sons following the death of Silverymoon's Warlord [[Rayuth]]. Saddened at his lord's passing and distasteful of Rayuth's successor, [[Tulven]], the then-elderly Aeroth traveled to Waterdeep and then boarded a ship heading west. The voyage briefly stopped at [[Toaridge-at-the-Sun's-Setting]], where Aeroth left ''Taragarth'' so that his sons would not be able to squabble over it. The family then arrived in the Moonshae Isles where they founded Vlan, which would eventually develop into a city as other disaffected folk from mainland [[Faerûn]] found their way there over the years. Aeroth's descendants would become central players among the feuding merchant houses of the Moonshaes."
