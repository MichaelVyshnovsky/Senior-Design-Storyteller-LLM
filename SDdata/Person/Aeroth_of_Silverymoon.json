        "mainbody": "eroth of Silverymoon was a War Captain and champion of Silverymoon during the Second Trollwar in the 10 century DR. Later in life, he founded the city of Vlan on the Moonshae Isles.It is likely that both Vlan and its \"merchant houses\" are not intended to be canon. The city of Vlan, as well as the role of Aeroths descendants in the Moonshae Isles, were originally mentioned by Ed Greenwood in 1983s Dragon Issue #74, predating the release of the original Forgotten Realms Campaign Set in 1987. The Moonshae Isles were changed significantly in the official TSR version of the Forgotten Realms, and Vlan has never been included on any canon maps or descriptions of the Moonshaes. However, the text from the Dragon article was replicated (possibly in error) in 1988s The Magister, hence it is included here as canon information.\nAeroth was renowned as a champion and hero of the North. By the time he left Silverymoon, he had gray hair.\nFamously, Aeroth wielded Taragarth, an enchanted bastard sword that came to be known as \"the Bloodbrand\" in his hands.\nDuring the events of the Second Trollwar in the , Aeroth led an alliance between Silverymoon, Ahghairon of Waterdeep, and Samular Caradoon of Tyr against the trolls, and for this task, he was gifted the mighty sword Taragarth. He fought in the grueling nine-day Long Battle, distinguishing both himself and his sword. That battle ultimately broke the trolls, and the alliance would go on to clear the Evermoors of the foul creatures.\nCirca the , Aeroth departed from Silverymoon alongside his wife and six sons following the death of Silverymoons Warlord Rayuth. Saddened at his lords passing and distasteful of Rayuths successor, Tulven, the then-elderly Aeroth traveled to Waterdeep and then boarded a ship heading west. The voyage briefly stopped at Toaridge-at-the-Suns-Setting, where Aeroth left Taragarth so that his sons would not be able to squabble over it. The family then arrived in the Moonshae Isles where they founded Vlan, which would eventually develop into a city as other disaffected folk from mainland Faer√ªn found their way there over the years. Aeroths descendants would become central players among the feuding merchant houses of the Moonshaes."
