Lenaia was an elven slave captured by Chieftain Saslicks lizardfolk in 1372 DR.
Lenaia was a beautiful elven lass with long blonde hair and had an unmistakable air of superiority even when dressed in dirty slaves rags. She worshiped a goddess whose name she often evoked.
Lenaia was captured by Saslicks lizard tribe sometime in or before 1372 DR. Eventually, the Hero of Daggerford infiltrated the lizardfolk tribe wearing a magical polymorph spell. The adventurer witnessed a cruel and unfair gladiatorial battle between a large half-orc Thokk and a Lenaia. Outmatched, Lenaia was unlikely to have survived. However, her fate remained unknown, whether she was slain in the ring, released along with other slaves by the Hero of Daggerford, or left in the scaly hands of her capturers.
