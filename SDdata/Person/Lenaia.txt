'''Lenaia''' was an [[elf|elven]] slave captured by Chieftain [[Saslick]]'s [[lizardfolk]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Lenaia was a beautiful elven lass with long blonde hair and had an unmistakable air of superiority even when dressed in dirty slaves' rags. She worshiped a goddess whose name she often evoked.

==History==
Lenaia was captured by Saslick's lizard tribe sometime in or before 1372 DR. Eventually, the [[Hero of Daggerford]] infiltrated the lizardfolk tribe wearing a magical ''[[polymorph]]'' spell. The adventurer witnessed a cruel and unfair gladiatorial battle between a large [[half-orc]] [[Thokk]] and a Lenaia. Outmatched, Lenaia was unlikely to have survived. However, her fate remained unknown, whether she was slain in the ring, released along with other slaves by the Hero of Daggerford, or left in the scaly hands of her capturers.
