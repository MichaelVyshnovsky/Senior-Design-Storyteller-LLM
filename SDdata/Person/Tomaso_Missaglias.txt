Tomaso Missaglias was a skilled armorer for hire from the city of Neverwinter, active in the late 15 century DR.
Tomaso hailed from a famous family of armorers. By the late 15, he had embarked on a journey â€“ a family tradition, to learn armorer skills from foreign masters. Tomaso was a reluctant craftsman who trained in the craft only to satisfy his family. Eventually, he started offering his skills to the adventurers and defenders of Neverwinter.
