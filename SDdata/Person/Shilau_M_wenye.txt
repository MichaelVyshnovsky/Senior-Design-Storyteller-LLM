Shilau Mwenye was a priest that oversaw the temple of Helm in Fort Beluarian during the late 15 century DR.
He was half Chultan on his fathers side, and Shou on his mothers side.
Shilau always did his best to not judge others and find the best in their actions.
His father was also a priest, while his mother was a mercenary.
