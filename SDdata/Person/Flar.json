        "mainbody": "Flar, also rendered as Flarr, was a warrior and adventurer who was a leader of the Company of the Gryphon up to the late 13 century DR. Notably, Flar was a wielder of  Namarra, the Sword That Never Sleeps.\nAt some point, the Company of the Gryphon killed a goblin wielding an enchanted sword named Ghaur. Flar, the companys then leader, claimed the sword and found it was the legendary Namarra, which the goblins of the Valley of Khedrun had looted in the plundering of Mirabar during the Goblin Wars in .It is unclear when this occurred. The sources say the goblins had the sword \"for almost two hundred seasons\", but it is unknown if this is meant to be 200 years (e.g., 200 winters) or only 50 years (four seasons per year). Moreover, Namarras timeline has been stretched by later dating, so it can only be some time between c. 800 DR or c. 950 DR and the 1270s DR. As the timeline is stretched, both presumed dates are difficult to fitâ€”Flar may have the sword for up to ~470 or ~320 years and seems very long-lived.\nLater, to pay for training in the combat arts, Flar gave Namarra to Thulmar One-Eye of Port Llast around the 1270s DR."
