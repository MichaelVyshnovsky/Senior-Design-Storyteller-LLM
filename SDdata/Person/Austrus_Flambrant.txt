Austrus Flambrant was a noble in Cormyr and the lord of Flambrant House.
Flambrant was close to Lady Jalassra Dawningdown.
Around 1480 DR, Lady Dawningdown disappeared from Suzail and Flambrant believed the culprits to be Mirt and Lady Rensharra Ironstave. He managed to find them near Lord Lothan Durncaskyn of Immerford and went asking for answers. Mirt confronted him and knocked him down.
