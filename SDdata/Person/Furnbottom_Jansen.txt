'''Furnbottom Jansen''' was an aging adventurer from the vast [[Jansen]] [[gnome]] family, who lived sometime in the early-to-mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''A wonderful memory... until he attracted a griffon with all that shiny armor. The griffon would have enjoyed a plate of turnips more than stringy old Uncle Furnbottom. He put up quite the fight going down. Not unlike a bad turnip, especially if you don't wash it in a spring. Hmm. I've lost track of where I was going with this...''|[[Kylie Jansen]]}}

==Relationships==
[[Jan Jansen]] and Kylie Jansen were Furnbottom's nephew and niece.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Kylie Jansen reminisced about her uncle's heroic adventuring career. She liked to tell a story about how handsome old Furnbottom looked in his shiny polished [[gold]]en [[heavy armor]] and the [[sword]] risen high. However, the gnome's career ended when a hungry [[griffon]] got attracted to the Furnbottom's shine and swooped down from the sky at him like a gnome on a platter of turnips. Furnbottom fought valiantly on the way down.
