        "mainbody": "raconis was a brown dragon and the son of Abazigal.\nCuriously enough, Draconis seemed to be a brown dragon even though Abazigal was a blue. Like Abazigal, Draconis was a dragon capable of taking humanoid form. In fact, his alternative form was more fully human. He was a powerful mage and unarmed fighter and, as a dragon, used the troublesome technique of turning invisible in combat.\nDraconis owned Grand Master Tzu Zans bracers, which were highly sought out by combatants around Toril.\nIn his human form, he was confronted by Gorions Ward and the wards companions. At first, he thought them to be more of the monks of Balthazar, who was the rival of his father. He thought they would have learned from last time, as their batch was disposed of. After he smelt the taint of Bhaals blood on the ward, the dragon mocked the wards ambition.\nDraconis was adamant that he would not let them see his father, a Bhaalspawn. After a fierce battle, he was killed by the ward, who took his severed head in order to pass into Abazigals lair."
