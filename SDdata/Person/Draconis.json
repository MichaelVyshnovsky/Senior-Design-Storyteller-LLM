        "mainbody": "'''Draconis''' was a [[brown dragon]] and the son of [[Abazigal]].",
        "Description": "Curiously enough, Draconis seemed to be a [[brown dragon]] even though Abazigal was a [[blue dragon|blue]]. Like Abazigal, Draconis was a [[dragon]] capable of taking humanoid form. In fact, his alternative form was more fully human. He was a powerful mage and unarmed fighter and, as a dragon, used the troublesome technique of turning invisible in combat.",
        "Possessions": "Draconis owned Grand Master [[Tzu Zan]]'s bracers, which were highly sought out by combatants around [[Toril]].",
        "History": "In his human form, he was confronted by [[Gorion's Ward]] and the ward's companions. At first, he thought them to be more of the monks of [[Balthazar]], who was the rival of his father. He thought they would have learned from last time, as their batch was disposed of. After he smelt the taint of [[Bhaal]]'s blood on the ward, the dragon mocked the ward's ambition.\n\nDraconis was adamant that he would not let them see his father, a [[Bhaalspawn]]. After a fierce battle, he was killed by the ward, who took his severed head in order to pass into Abazigal's lair."
