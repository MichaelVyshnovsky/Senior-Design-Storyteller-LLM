This meant that foreign weapons dealers or blacksmiths were advised to seek her out and impress her if they wished to sell their wares in the city.\nSilaha imported a great deal of weapons from lands north of Chult. She also worked alongside the Master of the Market to seek out skilled or notable smiths who visited Port Nyanzaru.\nDuring the events of the death curse, Silaha was seeking a smith to produce axes, lances, and swords of titansteel."
