Widow Trawny was an inhabitant of Hultail in Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
In the late 15 century DR, Widow Trawny rented out two back rooms in her home on the southern border of Hultail to a young and beautiful herbalist named Sulimra who had relocated from Turmish. From Widow Trawnys home, Sulimra grew herbs and ran her medicine-making business.
