Melineth Turcassan was the father-in-law of King Duar Obarskyr of Cormyr.
When Duar took an army north to battle the orc invaders in the Kings Forest, Melineth sold the city of Suzail to pirates for 500 sacks of gold.
After fleeing from Cormyr, it was unknown what happened to him. Eventually he died and was interred underneath a buckeye tree where he became the fourth Ghazneth.
Melineth Turcassan was Queen Daverna’s father and King Duar’s father-in-law.
As a Ghazneth, Melineth had the power of decay. He was able to cause extreme decay with a single touch, causing muscle to melt away, and instantly causing living matter to decay to the point of death.
