'''Jarwain''' was the handsome and fiery-eyed [[half-elf|half]]–[[moon elf]] proprietor of the shop [[Jarwain's Imports]] in [[Ashabenford]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was an observant, charismatic man who had an eye for the finest of products in his shop and was extremely detail-oriented in his study of travelers and passers-by.

==Description==
Soft-spoken and observant, Jarwain kept his shop well-defended and well-stocked, but was also a man of secrets. He imported luxurious goods, including textiles and [[spices]], from [[Cormyr]] via guarded caravans using a dangerous route that passed through [[Tilver's Gap]] and down the [[Moonsea Ride]], a business deal he preferred not to disclose to others.

In actuality, Jarwain moonlighted as an agent for the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. He sold information on other caravans passing through Tilver's Gap to ensure the safety of his own.
