He had braided short black hair.\nThe tiefling carried a variety of charms, amulets, necklaces, and rings. None of them were enchanted.\nIn the , the tiefling known as the Honest Vendor found a way to make coin on na√Øve and scared Baldurians. The city lived in fear of the cultist infiltrators and the encroaching army of the Cult of the Absolute. The Vendor advertised his mundane, cheap jewelry as magical charms that could protect the wearers from Absolutist incantations and alleviate cultist curses. Even if folk needed a magical remedy, the tiefling con artist tried to convince them they always needed to stock up on magical prophylactics. Cressida Flint was one of the Vendors customers."
