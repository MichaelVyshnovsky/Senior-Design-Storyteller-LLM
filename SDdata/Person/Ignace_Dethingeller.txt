'''Ignace Dethingeller''' was a [[loremaster]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] who journeyed to [[Anchorome]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

He communicated with [[Tethtoril]], the First Reader of [[Candlekeep]]. In one letter, he reported he had journeyed north of [[Fort Flame]] to an unnamed island where the wreckage of a flying ship was discovered. From a journal that Dethingeller was able to recover, he learned that the ship had been captained by [[Eartharran Neirdre]] from [[Evermeet]] and that it had crashed after battle with a wing of [[dragon]]s. The journal contained sketches Eartharran Neirdre had made of statues from a floating city that had been abandoned. These statues depicted a race that had both draconic and avian features which Neirdre speculated either belonged to a draconic race that had evolved these features or possibly a race that was a common ancestor to both the [[dragons]] and [[aearee]]. The city was said to have been protected by a wing of dragons.
