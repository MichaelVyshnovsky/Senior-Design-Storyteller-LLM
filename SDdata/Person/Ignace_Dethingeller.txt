Ignace Dethingeller was a loremaster of Baldurs Gate who journeyed to Anchorome in the 1370s DR.
He communicated with Tethtoril, the First Reader of Candlekeep. In one letter, he reported he had journeyed north of Fort Flame to an unnamed island where the wreckage of a flying ship was discovered. From a journal that Dethingeller was able to recover, he learned that the ship had been captained by Eartharran Neirdre from Evermeet and that it had crashed after battle with a wing of dragons. The journal contained sketches Eartharran Neirdre had made of statues from a floating city that had been abandoned. These statues depicted a race that had both draconic and avian features which Neirdre speculated either belonged to a draconic race that had evolved these features or possibly a race that was a common ancestor to both the dragons and aearee. The city was said to have been protected by a wing of dragons.
