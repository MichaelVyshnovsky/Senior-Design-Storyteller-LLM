        "mainbody": "Olger Redaxe was king of the island of Gundarlun in the Trackless Sea in the mid-14 DR.\nRedaxe owned and oversaw a brilliant palace, but it had been significantly weathered by hundreds of years of mighty storms that were typical of the region. As well as a magnificent palace, the city of Gundbarg, Redaxe commanded six warships.\nCirca 1358 DR, the rulers daughter, Jagaerda, went missing. She was found by the Heroes of Ascore-to-be and taken back to her father, who rewarded them with an enchanted shield. The heroes explained their mission to the king, and he informed them that the foes and artifacts they sought might be located nearby Purple Rocks. The knowledgeable monarch gave the adventurers a rundown of the history of the Kraken Society and their involvement with the islands of Trisk and Utheraal."
