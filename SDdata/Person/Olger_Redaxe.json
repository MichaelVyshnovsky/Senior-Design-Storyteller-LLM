        "Description": "Redaxe owned and oversaw a brilliant palace, but it had been significantly weathered by hundreds of years of mighty storms that were typical of the region. As well as a magnificent palace, the city of [[Gundbarg]], Redaxe commanded six warships.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], the ruler's daughter, [[Jagaerda]], went missing. She was found by the [[Heroes of Ascore]]-to-be and taken back to her father, who rewarded them with an enchanted [[shield]]. The heroes explained their mission to the king, and he informed them that the foes and artifacts they sought might be located nearby [[Purple Rocks]]. The knowledgeable monarch gave the adventurers a rundown of the history of the [[Kraken Society]] and their involvement with the islands of [[Trisk]] and [[Utheraal]]."
