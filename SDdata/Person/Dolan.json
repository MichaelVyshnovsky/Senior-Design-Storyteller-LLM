        "mainbody": "Dolan was a no-good trapper, brother to Doogal and Digby, from the town of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale in the late 13 century DR.\nDolan was a human male with light skin and light chestnut hair. He was somewhat dim-witted and had some sadistic tendencies. Just like his brothers, Dolan overindulged in drinking \"fire water\" but was often cut off because when drunk, he was a \"crazy bas-tard.\"\nHe wore a set of simple leather armor and carried a shortsword.\nIn the , three new residents arrived in Lonelywood â€“ three trappers who did not abide by the local ranger-protectors rules. To Emmerich Hawks disdain, the brothers set out to trap forest beasts in the Lonely Wood without any regard for the damage they were doing to the forest. Digby and his brothers only cared about skinning and selling as many rabbit, elk, and even bears, as possible. Emmerich Hawk attempted to dissuade the trappers from their harmful practices, but the brothers considered the ranger to be just a crybaby who loved animals a bit too much. Once, Dolans traps ensnared Doogal. Dolan found it hilarious. Doogal did not."
