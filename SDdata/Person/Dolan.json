        "mainbody": "'''Dolan''' was a no-good trapper, brother to [[Doogal]] and [[Digby]], from the town of [[Lonelywood]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''I likes the way rabbits scream. AIIIEEEEEEEE!''|[[Dolan]]}}",
        "Description": "Dolan was a [[human]] male with light skin and light chestnut hair. He was somewhat dim-witted and had some sadistic tendencies. Just like his brothers, Dolan overindulged in drinking \"fire water\" but was often cut off because when drunk, he was a \"crazy bas-tard.\"",
        "Possessions": "He wore a set of simple [[leather armor]] and carried a [[shortsword]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, three new residents arrived in Lonelywood â€“ three trappers who did not abide by the local ranger-protector's rules. To [[Emmerich Hawk]]'s disdain, the brothers set out to trap forest beasts in the [[Lonely Wood]] without any regard for the damage they were doing to the forest. Digby and his brothers only cared about skinning and selling as many [[rabbit]], [[elk]], and even [[bear]]s, as possible. Emmerich Hawk attempted to dissuade the trappers from their harmful practices, but the brothers considered the ranger to be just a crybaby who loved animals a bit too much. Once, Dolan's traps ensnared Doogal. Dolan found it hilarious. Doogal did not."
