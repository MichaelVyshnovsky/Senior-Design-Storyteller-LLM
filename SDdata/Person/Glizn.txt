'''Glizn''' was a [[quasit]] in [[Sshamath]].

==History==
In [[1377 DR]], Glizn was the quasit that [[Piri]], an apprentice in the [[College of Mages]] and [[acolyte of the skin]], bonded to himself using an ancient [[Ritual of Bonding]] rediscovered by [[Q'arlynd Melarn]].

In [[1379 DR]], Glizn managed to gain control of Piri and instigated him into a duel with his fellow [[Eldrinn Elpragh]]. Glizn's plot was to kill Eldrinn and remove a possible rival for Piri. Q'arlynd cast a spell to send Glizn back to the [[Abyss]] but Piri's body also disappeared. 

Later, it was discovered that Glizn had gained control of Piri's body. He was summoned by Streea'Valsharess [[Zolond]], who asked him about Master Q'arlynd.
