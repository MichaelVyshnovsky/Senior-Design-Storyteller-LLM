        "mainbody": "'''Jhuvik''', usually known as '''Jhuvik of the Seven Gems''', was an elven thief and cleric of [[Mystra]] in [[Milvarune]], and a senior member of the [[Moonstars]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Jhuvik venerated [[Khelben Arunsun]] and [[Laeral Silverhand]] for their status as [[Chosen of Mystra]] but he rarely spoke about this. His personal thief's code was to steal magic items and knowledge from people that abused the [[Magic|Art]] and give it to Mystra's faithful.",
        "History": "Jhuvik lived in [[Milvarune]], [[Thesk]]. His main exploit, from which he received his nickname, was stealing seven large [[gem]]s from the headdress of a [[Thayan]] [[zulkir]] while it was still being worn.\n\nAt one point Jhuvik was recruited into the Moonstars."
