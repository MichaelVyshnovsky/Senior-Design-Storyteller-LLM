'''Milo''' was a new recruit of the [[Shadow Thieves]] who resided in the stronghold within [[Undermountain]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime in early [[1370 DR]], Shadow Thieves guild regained pretense in [[Waterdeep]] via a hidden stronghold in the top levels of Undermountain. The guild's activities included recruitment, and Milo was one of the young halflings that joined. Missing a cold personality and assassin skills, he was stationed to work in the hideout's kitchen, where he proved himself adequate in cooking the Undermountain's easiest meat - [[rat]]s, both average and [[giant rat|giant]]. Rat stew was his speciality.

When the guild's pretense was discovered by [[Khelben Arunsun]], he sent a lone hero he recently recruited as his agent to Waterdeep's mega-dungeon. The adventurer discovered the stronghold's location and eventually infiltrated the thieves' lair, slaying the Guild Master. Being not much of a fighter, Milo pleaded for his life and offered the lone hero his rat stew and free passage in exchange for his life.
