'''Kristoffen''' was the [[dragonborn]] captain of the ''[[Ice Floe]]'' in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Kristoffen, a white dragonborn, was cold, calculated, and solemn.

==Activities==
Kristoffen routinely cruised the [[Sea of Swords]], hauling goods for merchants as well as passengers. His ship, a [[galley]] called ''Ice Floe'', was specifically equipped for the frigid seas of the far north.

==Relationships==
Kristoffen was friends with [[Valdi Estapaar]], a member of the [[Leilon]] town council. He was secretly a member of the [[Cult of Talos]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], the Leilon town council was looking to hire a ship to transport a group of [[adventurers]] to the [[Thunder Cliff Caves]]. The caves at the foot of the [[Thunder Cliffs]] were used as a hideout by the Cult of Talos, which had previously attacked Leilon, and were only accessible by sea. Kristoffen tried to use his friendship with councilor [[Valdi Estapaar]] to get the job but had to compete for it with [[Stands in Tar]], the [[tabaxi]] captain of the ''[[Dancing Delight]]''. Secretly, he himself was a follower of [[Talos]]. However, Kristoffen couldn't stop the adventurers from defeating the cultists in the caves.
