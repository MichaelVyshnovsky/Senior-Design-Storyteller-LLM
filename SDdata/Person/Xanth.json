        "mainbody": "Xanth was a centaur who made his home in the southern reaches of Neverwinter Wood in the late 15 century DR.\nWhen the white dragon Cryovain arrived in the Sword Mountains in the late 15 century DR, he drove the orcs from Icespire Hold, and many sought refuge with the anchorites of Talos at the Circle of Thunder in Neverwinter Wood. The newly arrived orcs drove Xanth from his home, and he fled west toward the High Road to seek adventurers who would help him to strike back at the orcs. He ended up sheltering in the hills near the Dragon Barrow, where he observed that the location was haunted by will-o-wisps and decided to avoid the area."
