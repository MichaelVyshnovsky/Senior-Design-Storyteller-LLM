        "History": "When the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] arrived in the [[Sword Mountains]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, he drove the [[orc]]s from [[Icespire Hold]], and many sought refuge with the [[anchorites of Talos]] at the [[Circle of Thunder]] in Neverwinter Wood. The newly arrived orcs drove Xanth from his home, and he fled west toward the [[High Road]] to seek [[adventurer]]s who would help him to strike back at the orcs. He ended up sheltering in the hills near the [[Dragon Barrow]], where he observed that the location was haunted by [[will-o'-wisp]]s and decided to avoid the area."
