Berent Thallowwood was a soldier of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
He was a guard in Castle Obarskyr.
When Rorskryn Mreldrake fled Castle Obarskyr through a portal to the Kings Tower in Marsember, transformed into a woman, he was spotted at the portal by the War Wizard Ellard Gauntur, whod been deployed to capture him. Ellard figured out that was Mreldrake transformed from a stain on his clothes, and pursued. Two sentries were deployed by the War Wizard Ellard Gauntur on the Marsember side of the portal Berent Thallowwood and Mandron Saldar, so that Rorskryn could not return easily.
While the two sentries speculated, the vampire archmage Manshoon sent after them the death knight Targrael she quickly slew Berent without him even noticing.
