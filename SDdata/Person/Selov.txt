'''Selov''' was an innkeep and former [[wizard]] inhabiting the village of [[Urling]] in [[Rashemen]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}. 

==Activities==
Selov owned [[the Green Chapel]] [[inn]]. He warned his guests that trespassing into the nearby [[Urlingwood]] was punishable by death. Selov was once a powerful wizard and former [[Vremyonni]] who lost all of his powers while testing a "mage-negating" [[spell]] designed to be used against the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]]. The [[Wychlaran]] trusted the former wizard and placed protective spells upon him that would wipe any memories he retained related to the Old Ones.
