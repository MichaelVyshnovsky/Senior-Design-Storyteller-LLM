        "Description": "Alastar wore fine clothes and was balding. While in Chult, Alastar had gained a significant amount of weight and a tan. He also sweated profusely. \n\nHe had once been a [[cleric]] of [[Waukeen]]{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|15}}",
        "Personality": "{{Fq\n| text = Fetch me that pitcher of cool water, please.\n| source =  Alastar Bol\n}}\nAlastar was very intelligent and wise. He frequently gave advice and expected it to be followed, else he grew irritated.{{Cite adventurers league/Putting the Dead to Rest|4}}\n\nHe was ill-suited to the Chultan climate and hated his posting there, which he found to be hot and boring, and so he often complained and wanted to receive a promotion with a posting to a different location. He had a habit of over-eating, especially out of boredom.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|21}} He enjoyed sweets, and would use them instead of miniatures when planning tactics on his [[map]]s.",

He was known to host lavish feasts. \n\nVirtually everything he did was with the hope that it would make a good enough impression on his superiors to allow him to leave Chult. To aid in the fight against the [[undead]] that rampaged through the jungle, we was known to distribute ''[[holy water]]'' to Order agents heading into the jungle.\n\nHe was known to bet on [[dinosaur]] races in Port Nyanzaru, and his favorite racer was [[Mountain Thunder]]. On especially hot days, he did not bother to attend races in person, and instead sent his agents to place bets on his behalf.{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|3}}",
        "Relationships": "Alastor had a number of subordinates, which included [[Derio]], [[Radwan Goldlust]], and [[Gordo|Gordo the Just]].\n\nHe occasionally cooperated with representatives from other factions within Port Nyanzaru, such as when several of them elected to hire the mercenary [[Pozzanna Lordeaux]] to secure a stronghold within the Chultan jungle{{Cite adventurers league/Over the Edge|4}} or when they rallied behind [[Hawkdriver Mazugulak]] to drive back an undead attack on the city.{{Cite adventurers league/Rotting Roots|3}} \n\nHe was an ally to the [[Port Nyanzaru#Merchant Princes|merchant prince]]s, notably [[Ekene-Afa]]{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|24}} and [[Kwayothé]].",
