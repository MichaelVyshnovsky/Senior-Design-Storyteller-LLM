        "mainbody": "'''Elegul Another''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Tymora]] in [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Personality": "Elegul was a quintessential priest of Tymora. He liked jokes, partook in dares, and was overall quite a reckless person. While he was kind enough to help others, including healing, it had its limits for he believed over-reliance on him led to a life where chance had not influence for his taste.\n\nElegul also believed that decisions about how to spend money should be left to his church and not to the individual.\n\nElegul believed people should not use [[magic item]]s, because he believed using them was to take out the component of chance and thus turning away from his [[deity]].",
        "Abilities": "Elegul was a Wandering Fortune, an adventuring priest of Tymora. He was adept at combat with either the [[mace]] or a [[morning star]]. As a [[cleric]], he could also cast spells and he generally asked for ''[[bless]]'', ''[[cure disease]]'', ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[favor of Tymora]]'', ''[[find traps]]'', ''[[flame blade]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', and ''[[produce flame]]'' [[spell]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Elegul once got his hand on a magic item called ''[[Halaster's teleport ring]]''. He used it and lost all of his possessions including the ring but for his [[holy symbol]].",
        "Relationships": "To prevent others from relying on him, or more precisely on the powers Tymora supplied, instead of facing danger, he kept himself from becoming a long-time part of an adventurer party.\n\nHe was considered a quintessential follower of Tymora and the deity viewed it the same way to the point that she was willing to personally help him in danger.",
        "History": "In [[1371 DR]], while in [[Undermountain]], Elegul used a ''Halaster's teleport ring'', lost all of his possessions, and got caught by two [[ettin]]s called [[Huorgh]] and [[Uluth]].\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], Elegul managed to get out of Undermountain. Since then, he limited his work to [[Waterdeep]] and immediate surface areas."
