Borenorak was a treasure hunter and cleric of Icewind Dale in the mid–14 century DR. He may have joined the companions in their journey to Menzoberranzan.
He could be found by adventurers deep in the underground tunnels of the plains of Icewind Dale, looting the area for silver and rare gems. Borenorak was once controlled by an aboleth, and thus suffered from "Aboleth disease". This caused his skin to become marked by conspicuous veins.
