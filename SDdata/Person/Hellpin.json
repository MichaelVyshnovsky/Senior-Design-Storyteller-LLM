Taking an offense to this beating, Hellpin went on to attack Righteous Tad with his dogs one foggy night, losing more than half of them in the process. He then plucked Peacekeeper from Tads corpse, keeping it as a trophy within his safehouse as a warning to anyone else who might think to cross him."
