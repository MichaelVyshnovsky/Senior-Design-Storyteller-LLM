        "Possessions": "Hellpin owned a number of [[dog]]s.",
        "History": "One day while at the tavern owned by [[Tad|Righteous Tad]], Hellpin got into a brawl and he was one of many that ended up being hit by the owner's special [[enchanted]] weapon, ''[[Peacekeeper]]''. Taking an offense to this beating, Hellpin went on to attack Righteous Tad with his dogs one foggy night, losing more than half of them in the process. He then plucked ''Peacekeeper'' from Tad's corpse, keeping it as a trophy within his safehouse as a warning to anyone else who might think to cross him."
