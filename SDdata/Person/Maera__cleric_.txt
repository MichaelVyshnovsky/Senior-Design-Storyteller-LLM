Maera was a cleric of Sel√ªne, serving under High Initiate Courynna Jacerryl with sixteen others.
She and her fellows once performed a "night stalk" ceremony in honor of the goddess, who was pleased and produced moonfire. The glowing substance touched Maeras hands, and Courynna suggested the goddess had something special planned for her.
