'''Maera''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Selûne]], serving under High Initiate [[Courynna Jacerryl]] with sixteen others.

She and her fellows once performed a "night stalk" ceremony in honor of the goddess, who was pleased and produced ''[[Moonfire (substance)|moonfire]]''. The glowing substance touched Maera's hands, and Courynna suggested the goddess had something special planned for her.
