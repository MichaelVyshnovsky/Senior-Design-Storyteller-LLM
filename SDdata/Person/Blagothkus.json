        "mainbody": "'''Blagothkus''' was the [[cloud giant]] ruler of [[Skyreach Castle]].",
        "Personality": "Blagothkus was a survivor of the [[giant]] empires of the past, and his main dream was to somehow go back to those glorious times. Using this motivation, the [[Cult of the Dragon]] convinced him that they were reestablishing a time when only giants and [[dragon]]s would rule, though his commitment to that alliance was borne more out of a desire to spur giant-kind to action.",
        "History": "Blagothkus was a very old cloud giant lord in command of the [[Cloud palace|floating]] Skyreach Castle. In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], he allied with the Cult of the Dragon, dreaming to go back to the age when giants and dragons [[Thousand Year War|fought for the dominion of the world]]. The Cult used his castle as one of their main headquarters. When the Cult tried to bring [[Tiamat]] back to the [[Prime Material Plane]] and let [[chromatic dragon]]s run rampant throughout the [[Sword Coast]], Blagothkus and his allies collected there all the treasures destined for the hoard of the Dragon Queen.\n\nPrior to the shattering of the [[Ordning]], Blagothkus and his son [[Eigeron]] traveled to the [[Eye of the All-Father]] to consult the oracle there. Not liking what the oracle told Blagothkus, he slew his son and retreated to his castle to mourn. His son rose as a [[ghost]] wishing for vengeance on his father.\n\nEventually, a band of [[adventurer]]s boarded the castle and may have killed Blagothkus."
