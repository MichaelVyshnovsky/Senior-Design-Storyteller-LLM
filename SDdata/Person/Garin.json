        "History": "In 1384 DR, Garin was assigned by his friend and superior [[Micus]] to act as the jailor of [[Kaanyr Vhok]], who had infiltrated the [[House of the Triad]]. However, [[Aliisza]] and [[Tauran]] deceived Garin and freed Kaanyr, believing that they needed his help to capture the more dangerous [[Zasian Menz]], also an infiltrator. For this, Garin was questioned by his superiors.\n\nWhen the [[Spellplague]] hit, Garin was one of the commanders of the [[celestial]] armies that tried to repel the evil outsiders that arrived in [[Celestia]]."
