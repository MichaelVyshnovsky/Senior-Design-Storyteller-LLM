However, Aliisza and Tauran deceived Garin and freed Kaanyr, believing that they needed his help to capture the more dangerous Zasian Menz, also an infiltrator. For this, Garin was questioned by his superiors.\nWhen the Spellplague hit, Garin was one of the commanders of the celestial armies that tried to repel the evil outsiders that arrived in Celestia."
