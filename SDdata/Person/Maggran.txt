{{Quote|Rawr!|Maggran, transforming into a bear.}}

==Description==
The powerful druid had [[tattoo]]s across his right arm, on his chin, and around his eyes.

==Abilities==
Magran was capable of ''[[wild shaping]]'' into the form of a mighty bear.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1492}}, [[tiefling]]s exiled from the city of [[Elturel]] were granted refuge at the Emerald Grove by [[archdruid]] [[Halsin]]. During their stay, a child by the name of [[Arabella]] attempted to steal the ''[[idol of Silvanus]]'' from its altar within the grove. When the child's parents rushed into the grove to try and save her from judgement, Maggran and two fellow druids were forced to intervene.
