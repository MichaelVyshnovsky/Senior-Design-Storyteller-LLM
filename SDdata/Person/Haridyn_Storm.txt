Haridyn Storm was a roguish human adventurer and member of the Emerald Swords company. She specialised in skulduggery and assassination.
She was cruel, calculating and efficient in her work, which was usually the dirtiest business of the group.
Haridyn wore a leather jerkin, and her main tool of the trade was an enchanted +4 shortsword. She wore a +4 cloak of protection, a +3 ring of protection, and an amulet of nondetection, and carried dust of disappearance and two +3 daggers of venom for special occasions.
In 1369 DR, Haridyn and the Emerald Swords were guests at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail. They conspired to kidnap Lord Partic Thistle and hand him over to Zhentil Keep for questioning, and had Xixis the doppelganger impersonate Lord Thistle to allow them to escape without suspicion. When Xixis risked carelessly ruining the plan, Gandegar Armstrong had Haridyn kill Xixis with a dagger of venom, so that the Lords murder would cover up his kidnapping. Despite their best attempts at diversion, the Emerald Swords were caught and Lord Thistle rescued. For their murder and kidnapping, they risked exile or execution for their crimes.
