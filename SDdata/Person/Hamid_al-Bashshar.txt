'''Hamid al-Bashshar''' was one of the newest members of the [[Corsair Council]] of [[Hawa]] by [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==History==
Hamid was once a member of the [[Dutiful Mamluk Society]]. After his village was nearly destroyed by ravagers and he was taken prisoner, Hamid managed to escape and traveled to the [[Corsair Domains]], where he begged to join the corsairs to aid in the fight against his former captors. His desire to remove his tattoos and successfully passing a ''[[detect lie]]'' spell convinced the Corsair Council that he was being truthful. He was given a place on [[Akura al-Hiyali]]'s ship. His keen intellect and hatred for the mamluks showed the Council that Hamid would be more useful to them if provided command of his own ship.

==Description==
Facial scars marred Hamid's visage, courtesy of removing the tattoos he was given during his time as a [[mamluk]] for the Dutiful. He had wavy black hair and hazel eyes and was once considered handsome. In order to hide his scars, Hamid always wore a veil.

==Abilities==
Hamid was a natural actor.

==Activities==
Secretly, Hamid was a spy for the Dutiful. He worked hard to help other spies infiltrate Hawa and waited for the perfect opportunity to flee back to [[Qudra]] and report to his real masters. 

==Possessions==
The mamluks of the Dutiful gave Hamid an ''[[amulet of proof against detection and location]]'' and two ''[[philter of glibness|philters of glibness]]'' to help on his spying mission.

==Relationships==
Though he spied for the mamluks, Hamid came to like many of the [[corsair]]s he met in Hawa. Only a direct attack against Qudra would prompt him to turn his back on his new friends.
