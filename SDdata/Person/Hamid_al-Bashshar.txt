Hamid al-Bashshar was one of the newest members of the Corsair Council of Hawa by 1367 DR.
Hamid was once a member of the Dutiful Mamluk Society. After his village was nearly destroyed by ravagers and he was taken prisoner, Hamid managed to escape and traveled to the Corsair Domains, where he begged to join the corsairs to aid in the fight against his former captors. His desire to remove his tattoos and successfully passing a detect lie spell convinced the Corsair Council that he was being truthful. He was given a place on Akura al-Hiyalis ship. His keen intellect and hatred for the mamluks showed the Council that Hamid would be more useful to them if provided command of his own ship.
Facial scars marred Hamids visage, courtesy of removing the tattoos he was given during his time as a mamluk for the Dutiful. He had wavy black hair and hazel eyes and was once considered handsome. In order to hide his scars, Hamid always wore a veil.
Hamid was a natural actor.
Secretly, Hamid was a spy for the Dutiful. He worked hard to help other spies infiltrate Hawa and waited for the perfect opportunity to flee back to Qudra and report to his real masters. 
The mamluks of the Dutiful gave Hamid an amulet of proof against detection and location and two philters of glibness to help on his spying mission.
Though he spied for the mamluks, Hamid came to like many of the corsairs he met in Hawa. Only a direct attack against Qudra would prompt him to turn his back on his new friends.
