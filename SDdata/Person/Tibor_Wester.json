        "mainbody": "Tibor Wester was a businessperson who lived on the Sword Coast North during the late 15 century DR.\nHe was a spineless man who only looked out for himself and his interests.\nIn the 1490s DR, Tibor established a logging camp in the Neverwinter Wood on the southern bank of the river where employed local woodsmen to harvest trees and send them downriver to Neverwinter. He purchased supplies from Barthens Provisions in Phandalin rather than in Neverwinter to avoid paying the latter’s “devastation taxes”,  and he often employed adventurers as escorts to this cargo.\nTibor had one known sibling, his half-brother Harbin Wester, who was the Townmaster of Phandalin and helped to organize shipments of supplies to his camp.\nSome time after the , Tibors camp was harried by ankhegs that were called forth by anchorites of Talos. The Talosian devotees resented the fact that Tibor and his operations intruded on their woodland home."
