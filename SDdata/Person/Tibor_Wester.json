        "mainbody": "'''Tibor Wester''' was a businessperson who lived on the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "He was a spineless man who only looked out for himself and his interests.",
        "Activities": "In the 1490s [[DR]], Tibor established a [[Tibor Wester's loggers' camp|logging camp]] in the [[Neverwinter Wood]] on the southern bank of the [[Neverwinter River|river]] where employed local woodsmen to harvest trees and send them downriver to [[Neverwinter]]. He purchased supplies from [[Barthen's Provisions]] in [[Phandalin]] rather than in Neverwinter to avoid paying the latter’s “devastation taxes”,  and he often employed [[adventurer]]s as escorts to this cargo.",
        "Relationships": "Tibor had one known sibling, his half-brother [[Harbin Wester]], who was the Townmaster of Phandalin and helped to organize shipments of supplies to his camp.",
        "History": "Some time after the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, Tibor's camp was harried by [[ankheg]]s that were called forth by [[anchorites of Talos]]. The Talosian devotees resented the fact that Tibor and his operations intruded on their woodland home."
