Lerek Dashlynd was an agent who represented the interests of certain wealthy individuals from Waterdeep in the city of Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the late 15 century DR.
He was a spy for the Lords Alliance.
When he acquired something for his benefactors, he hired a cleric to confirm the authenticity of the item by casting augury.
During the events of the death curse, Lerek was tasked with acquiring an accurate map of Chult showing the location of two important ruins Nangalore and Orolunga. He was able to offer an entire sailing ship as compensation for such a map.
