'''Deogol Fengrath''' was a [[wizard]] of the [[Fengrath]] family and the ruling [[Gauntlet (title)|Gauntlet]] of the village of [[Shining Falls (village)|Shining Falls]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Home==
He lived in the [[Granite Tower (Shining Falls)|Granite Tower]] in the center of Shining Falls with his family and guards, who tended also to be family, as well as his [[construct]]s, including at least one [[shield guardian]].

==Activities==
Deogol was nominally the ruler of Shining Falls, but he did so with a light hand. So light, in fact, that he preferred to leave the day-to-day running of things to Sheriff [[Vendal Viccstray]]. Instead, he concentrated on his crafts and [[magic]] within the walls of the Granite Tower.

One particular project was discovering the [[Splendarrmornn|dwarven complex]] thought to lie behind the [[Shining Falls]], after which the village was named. He tried to hire [[adventurer]]s for the task and enlisted [[Blaz Merrymar]] to aid him. Most in the village thought this foolish and a wasted effort.

==Relations==
Deogol was the great grandson of [[Walenburh Fengrath]], the founder of Shining Falls.

==Rumors & Legends==
He was reputed to be quite a powerful wizard, owing to his possession of at least one shield guardian.

One fellow in the village claimed to have seen skulking inside the keep an unusual [[dwarf]]-like creature with pale skin, bulbous eyes that lacked both pupils and irises, and ugly face muttered insanely. However, Deogol's guards were unsurprised and the witness believed Deogol had summoned it through magic.

==History==
Some time after [[Shieldmeet]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Deogol went missing for at least a month, his fate and whereabouts unknown. Around the same time, a grim band of adventurers passed through Shining Falls on their way to the [[Fallen Lands]]. Any connection between them is unknown.<ref><ref group="note">The reason for Deogol Fengrath's disappearance is not covered within the remaining [[Legacy of the Green Regent]] materials. It may be in the subsequent module, the unreleased "[[Into the Fallen Lands]]".
