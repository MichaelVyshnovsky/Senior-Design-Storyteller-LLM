'''Uldreth Korroth''' was a [[Zulkir]] of [[Evocation]] sometime ''circa'' late [[1300 DR]].

==Description==
Uldreth was an aggressive, lewd obese Thayan [[human]] male. Around his fellow zulkirs, he was a convivial individual and a fast friend to the members of the Council. However, tharchions knew Uldreth as a cruel and ruthless man who was not above lies and trickery.

==Abilities==
This zulkir was famous for having many-layers backup contingency plans and [[spell]]s prepared at all times.

==History==
Uldreth Korroth claimed the title of the Zullkir of Evocation sometime before the late {{YearlinkName|1300}}. He was listed among several zulkirs that became widely known after being identified and described in the [[book]] called ''[[Twelve Winters Under the Lash]]'', penned by an anonymous slave and smuggled out of Thay sometime in late 1300 DR. Uldreth considered people of lower social status to be lowly creatures, as such, his rule was splattered with many displays of hands-on "spectacular butchery."
