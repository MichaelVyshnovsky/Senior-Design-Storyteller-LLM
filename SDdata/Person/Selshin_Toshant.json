        "mainbody": "'''Selshin Toshant''' was an ex-pirate and the leader of the town of [[Alphar]] of [[Alphar Isle]] in the [[Pirate Isles]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Selshin was 40 years old in [[1359 DR]].",
        "Activities": "As leader of Alphar, Selshin ran a government separate from the influence of any pirate captains. In fact, he made an effort to \"clean up\" Alphar's harbor, tried to ban wanted pirates, and strove to develop trade relationships with [[Impiltur]], [[Procampur]], and [[Sembia]]. However, his trade efforts met with little success as the surrounding nations were not eager to establish such bonds with a port that had close ties to pirates and, at home, the folk of Alphar held tight to their pirate traditions and opposed Selshin's efforts. There was a risk that if he pushed too far, he would be removed from power before long."
