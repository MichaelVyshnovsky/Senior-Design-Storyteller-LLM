Ryndalla Cuttail was a wererat of the Riverside Rats gang, who dwelt in the Wheloon Prison of Cormyr during the late 15 century DR.
As a wererat, Ryndalla had white-gray fur.
Ryndalla lived in Wheloon Prison with her gang of fellow wererats, and they were forced from their hideout by the Night Brigade under Storna Harnwood, who turned it into a Temple of Shar. After narrowly escaping from the clutches of Agarta the Breaker and her arena, Ryndalla helped organize a counterattack with the surviving Rats against the Battlemasters Arenas. She sent a team guided in by Martildae in order to rescue any captive Riverside Rats, resulting in a deadly confrontation with Agarta in her own arena.
