Jeveldra Shieldwinter was one of the six orphaned wards of Muranee Crownlinden, the proprietor of Muranees Old Treasures store in Hultail in the late 15 century DR.
By the late 15 century DR, Jeveldra was an orphaned youth from Suzail, the capital city of Cormyr, taken in by Muranee Crownlinden to help her run the used goods store. Jeveldra and her five fellow adopted siblings all lived inside the shop, with their beds hoisted from the attic after the store closed. Perhaps the most competent among them, Jeveldra and her sisters cooked, cleaned, and helped with the shops business.
