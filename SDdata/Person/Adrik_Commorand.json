While part of that caravan, he helped repel a [[Red Wizard]] patrol.\n\nAfter the caravan reached [[Emmech]], he took a commission with [[Raidon Kane]], a half-elf monk and his fellow guard in the caravan. Though he did not have much gold, the monk had enough to afford one brother alone for two tendays; Adrik was also interested in visiting the Yuirwood. His brother Erik remained in Emmech, looking for a ship to take the two brothers across the Sea of Fallen Stars.{{cite book/Stardeep|132-134|11}}\n\nAdrik and Raidon joined the force in Relkath's foot going into the offensive against Stardeep. Even though the force was defeated, the two of them lingered.{{cite book/Stardeep|194-199|18}}\n\nWhen they came across Moonveil Citadel, they were attacked by a summoned [[fire elemental]] and its [[nilshai]] masters. He was poisoned; Kiril took them to visit the Edgewarden in order to find healing. Unfortunately, the edgewarden could only slow the poison down, not stop it.{{cite book/Stardeep|249-256|27}} He died of his wounds not long after.{{cite book/Stardeep|270|26}}"
