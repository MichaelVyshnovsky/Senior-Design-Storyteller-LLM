Oksakex was a vampiric ixzan cleric and a member of theÂ Xendreth, the ruling council of Malydren, in 1370 DR.
Oksakex hoped to become a greater vampiric ixzan and approached Phiaqiv on more than one occasion asking for a transformation. He always refused but never told of her ambitions to Zekaqux.
Oksakex regularly fell into holy trances, and these left her with uncontrollable shaking for several hours. Her spell came mostly from the school of divination
Oksakex was the second only to Zekaqux in the clergy of Ilxendren.
