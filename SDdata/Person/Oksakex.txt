'''Oksakex''' was a [[vampire|vampiric]] [[ixzan]] [[cleric]] and a member of theÂ [[Xendreth]], the ruling council of [[Malydren]], in [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
Oksakex hoped to become a greater vampiric ixzan and approached [[Phiaqiv]] on more than one occasion asking for a transformation. He always refused but never told of her ambitions to [[Zekaqux]].

==Abilities==
Oksakex regularly fell into holy trances, and these left her with uncontrollable shaking for several hours. Her [[spell]] came mostly from the school of [[divination]]

==History==
Oksakex was the second only to Zekaqux in the clergy of [[Ilxendren]].
