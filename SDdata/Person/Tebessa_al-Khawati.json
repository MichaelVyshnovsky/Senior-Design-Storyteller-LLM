        "mainbody": "Tebessa al-Khawati was a leader among the desert centaurs in the Burning Lands near Moradask in 1367 DR.\nTebessa kept her hair short and rarely combed it. Her face was weathered from long exposure to the sun, framing her fiery green eyes. Though she lead the hard life of a desert nomad, Tebessa looked far younger than her 80 years.\nThe lower half of her body resembled that of a stout pony with the slim legs of a gazelle.\nTebessa was blunt and honest. As such she was easily deceived. She preferred swift action to careful planning.\nTebessa was the leader of the Khawati Clan in 1367 DR. As a natural warrior and hunter, she preferred to leave the heavy thinking to the clans priestess Narur al-Khawati.\nTebessa was captured by Shorn cultists one night while bathing alone at an oasis near Moradusk. Infuriated by her dark curly hair, the cults leader decided to have her entire body shaved, including her precious warriors braid. Tebessa was able to escape with the aid of her sister, but not before her warriors braid was removed. Tebessa never forgave the Shorn for the violation, and vowed to see them destroyed.\nTebessa carried a magical battleaxe named windbiter, a ring of protection, a potion of hill giant strength, a composite longbow, and several valuable gems. She carried her gear on an ornate leather harness worn on her upper body.\nTebessa was the younger sister of the clans priestess Narur."
