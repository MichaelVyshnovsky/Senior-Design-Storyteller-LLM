'''Yulimtul''' was an officer of the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenary company during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1364 DR]], Yulimtul, along with [[Scar]], [[Bellan]], [[Desedrak]], and over 500 Fist members sailed out from [[Faerûn]] on an expedition in search of the legendary land of [[Anchorome]]. While they were beset by disease and storms, they safely landed in the port city of [[Helmsport]] in [[Maztica]]. 

While in the safety of the [[Amn]]ian colony, the group split, with Yulimtul, Desedrak, and over 200 Fist mercenaries traveling overland across the continent to the northwest, in search of the legendary [[Maztica]]n [[City of Gold (Maztica)|City of Gold]]. However, the explorers completely disappeared and were never heard from again.
