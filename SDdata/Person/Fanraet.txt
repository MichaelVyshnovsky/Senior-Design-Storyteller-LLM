Overseer '''Fanraet''' was one of the leaders of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1369 DR]].

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], Fanraet oversaw the excavations and research of the ruins of the Room of Words in [[Onaglym]] of [[Myth Drannor]]. Lieutenant [[Iolrak]] was directly reporting to the Overseer of the mission's progress. Even though there was not much progress in the recovery of the ''Word of Oblivion'', his cultists were able to collect many other ''glyphs'' and ''words of power'' that opened previously sealed areas within the [[Dwarven Dungeons]], [[Elven Catacombs]], and other parts of Myth Drannor.

However, for his failures, Overseer Fanraet was beheaded by Grand Overseer [[Vidorus]] as per [[Kya Mordrayn]]'s orders. The unlucky overseer's head was sent as a dire warning to Overseer [[Sinod]].
