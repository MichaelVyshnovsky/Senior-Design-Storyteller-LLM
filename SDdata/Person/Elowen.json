        "mainbody": "lowen was a Nentyar hunter operating in the Forest of Lethyr in . She was a part of Araluens party when she went to confront the Rotting Man that year.\nElowen clad herself in warriors garb, mostly brown and green leathers. Her hair hid her ears her build was thin and elongated.\nShe was strongly appreciative of music, even very foreign one like that of Gunggari Ulmarra. Also, she really liked swords.\nElowen was quite familiar with the paths around the Forest of Lethyr, and even with parts of the Rawlinswood like the Arches of Xenosi.\nThe Nentyarch bestowed Dymondheart upon Elowen before sending her on the quest to confront the Rotting Man together with Araluen. Before that time, she wielded a leaf-shaped blade.\nAs a Nentyar hunter, Elowen ranged freely throughout the Forest of Lethyr. She was, however, quite remiss with her paperwork in , she had gone for about two years without reporting back to the Circle of Leth.\nHer fellow Nentyar hunter Fallon bore some sort of grudge against her. She was friends with the Deep Imaskari wizard Ususi Manaallin. She slowly became friends with Marrec and Gunggari Ulmarra over the course of their time together.\nOn the spring of 1373 DR, Elowen came across Araluen, at the moment known as Ash, in Fullpoint after the village was attacked by blightspawned volodni. Together with the Gunggari Ulmarra and the priest Marrec, she managed to save Ash from her kidnappers. Learning from Ususi that the Mucklestones were imperiled, they headed there to check up on Briartan there, they fought the Talontar blightlord Gameliel and rescued Briartan, who was his captive.\nPer Briartans advice, they headed for Yeshelmaar, where she gave a debriefing regarding the situation to the Circle of Leth. After the group spoke with the Nentyarch, he bestowed Dymondheart on her, and bade her accompany Marrec and Ash, or Araluen, on their quest to confront the Rotting Man. However, when her fellow Nentyar hunter, Fallon, kidnapped Ash, they were forced to give chase before being able to complete their preparations. They chased Fallon across the Celestial Nadir, and were ambushed by Anammelech on exiting it. After the second blightlords defeat, they proceeded through thee tunnels of Under-Tharos, and were pressed into a fight between two demons the Queen Abiding and Eschar. Successfully prying off the Queen Abidings command token from Eschar, they emerged in the Rawlinswood close to Dun-Tharos, where they soon came across a third blightlord, Damanda after the fight, they caught up with a dying Fallon and finally recovered Araluen.\nThey challenged the Rotting Man soon after during the fight, Elowen personally destroyed Damanda. After the Rotting Man ordered the Step-Daughter of Talona to fight them, Elowen was quickly knocked out by the rampaging abomination. She survived the fight, however, and judged that she had made new friends during the quest."
