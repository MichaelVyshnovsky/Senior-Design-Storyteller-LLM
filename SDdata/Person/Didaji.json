        "mainbody": "Sheikh '''Didaji''' was a leader of one of the [[Bedine]] tribes that lived in [[Anauroch]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Pass the word to dismount and come forward with lance ands word. We must pry these lizards from their dens.|Didaji, to his fellow sheikhs before the [[Battle of the Fissures]].}}",
        "Description": "He was a rather tall man, with sunken, angular features. Due to the fact the men of his tribe covered their faces rather than the women, Didaji wore a scarf around his face that he wore along with the typical [[turban]].",
        "Relationships": "Uncharacteristically of a Bedine sheikh, Didaji was wholly supportive of the sorceress [[Ruha]] in the use of her arcane powers. Unlike others he felt it was a blessing from the gods, rather than a curse.",
        "History": "Didaji and his tribe's warriors were among those present during the final battles between the Bedine people and the [[Zhentilar]] army that took place in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}. They helped route the [[asabi]] mercenaries from their tunnel system in the south of the [[Wall of Fallen Djinn]] mountain range in the [[Battle of the Fissures]], and served as a reserve force alongside the [[Raz'hadi]] during the siege of [[Orofin]]."
