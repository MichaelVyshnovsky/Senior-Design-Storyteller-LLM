Once, circa [[1338 DR]], he served in a mining expedition with Belwar and Belwar's new friend, the [[drow]] [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. His meeting with Drizzt changed Brickers' mind about outsiders. From that time on, he helped to improve relations with surface dwellers, even inviting some visiting [[shield dwarves]] to join mining expeditions.\n\nBrickers was one of the most senior burrow wardens active in 1370 DR.",
        "Personality": "At first, Brickers was very close-minded, always suspecting the worst of outsiders. After he met Drizzt, he become more open."
