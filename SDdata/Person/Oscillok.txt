Oscillok () was a Thayan knight who served Zulkir Ethra Dralas of the Red Wizards of Thay during the late 15 century DR.
As a Thayan knight, Oscillok wore plate mail and wielded a glaive, and carried several scrolls and potions, including a potion of flying.  
On his head, he bore a tattoo that magically bonded him with a Zulkir, meaning that he could accept injuries intended for her.
He also possessed a locket containing a drawing of his wife and daughter.
Although a servant of the Red Wizards, Oscillok was ultimately more devoted to his friends and family than to his duties.
Following the events of the Death Curse in the late 15 century DR, Oscillok accompanied the Zulkir to whom he was bonded, Ethra Dralas, to Chult as one of eight Thayan knights in her entourage. Their mission was to enter the Maze of Ubtao and release Dendar the Night Serpent, although many of the mission details were not shared with Oscillok.
Once inside the Maze, Oscillok became separated from the rest of the Thayans when he came across a painting of a su-monster that was actually a trap. His mind was psychically invaded by feelings of deep, paralyzing despair and a conviction that he would be forever trapped in the Maze and unable to see his family again. This left him in a numb state, unable to respond to the world around him and unable to do anything but lie down and cry into his locket containing the drawing of his wife and daughter.
