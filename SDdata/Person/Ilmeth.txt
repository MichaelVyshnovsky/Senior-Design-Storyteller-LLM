Ilmeth was the grim, yet fair Lord of Essembra. He was somewhat obsessed with commanding Battledales army known as the Lords Men. Lord Ilmeth barely tolerated adventurers in his presence, so long as they remained out of his way.
War-Chancellor Ilmeth was an accomplished warrior. He inherited the lordship of Essembra in 1351 DR.
Disputes and justice were traditionally resolved by the lord of Essembra. Ilmeth disliked this duty, but tried to be as fair as possible.
