'''Belmer''' of the Six Thunders was a local archwizard of [[Calimshan]]. As of {{yearlink|709}}, he was working as a "firestop" mage on a roadside inn, "The Vizier Vanquished". He was the last one to die in the Night of Fourteen Magisters.

==Personality==
Belmer was competent but cruel.

==Relationships==
Though Turnock Draether had to pretty much trick him to be accepted as an apprentice, the young man soon came to hate him. Belmer, for his part, did not seem to trust him.

==Abilities==
Belmer's "six thunders" were battle spells. He knew a spell that created a magical tattoo, through which he could deal out an agonizing death to the person so tattooed.

==History==
Belmer took on Turnock Draether as an apprentice after the latter helped him home in [[Zazesspur]] during a night in which he got too drunk to even walk on his own, though this was also because Belmer was rising in power and influence, and so needed an apprentice to carry out some of the tasks. However, he put a tattoo on Turnock that would kill him painfully if he ever betrayed him.

During the [[Night of Fourteen Magisters]], Belmer had a commission as the "firestop" mage of the [[Vizier Vanquished]] inn in northern [[Calimshan]]. After waking up, he quickly slew [[Illinge Hardraw]] with a spell from afar, while looking into a ''[[crystal ball]]'', and soon gained the office of the [[Magister]]. After this act, he was quickly slain by his apprentice, [[Turnock Draether]], who split his skull with an axe.
