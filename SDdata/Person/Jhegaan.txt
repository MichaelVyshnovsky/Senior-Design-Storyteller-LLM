Jhegaan the Maestro was an employee of Auroras Emporium in 1370 DR.
Jhegaan adventured with Aurora across much of Faer√ªn, from Icewind Dale to Chult, from the Sword Coast to the fringes of Kara-Tur. When Aurora started her business, Jhegaan agreed to work with her and found that he was good at it too.
Once, he and Aurora had been lovers, but they remained very close friends.
