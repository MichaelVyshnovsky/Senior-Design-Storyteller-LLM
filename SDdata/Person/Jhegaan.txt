'''Jhegaan the Maestro''' was an employee of [[Aurora's Emporium]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Jhegaan adventured with [[Aurora]] across much of [[Faer√ªn]], from [[Icewind Dale]] to [[Chult]], from the [[Sword Coast]] to the fringes of [[Kara-Tur]]. When Aurora started her business, Jhegaan agreed to work with her and found that he was good at it too.

Once, he and Aurora had been lovers, but they remained very close friends.
