He was a member of the Cult of the Dragon and an acquaintance of Symgharyl Maruel.\nIn 1357 DR, Symgharyl Maruel, having trouble dealing with the spellfire of Shandril Shessair, enlisted the help of Aghazstamn, promising him part of the treasure of Rauglothgor. She rode the blue dracolich into battle but Aghazstamn was destroyed by Elminster, through a reflected meteor swarm, together with her when she tried to slay the group with the spell."
