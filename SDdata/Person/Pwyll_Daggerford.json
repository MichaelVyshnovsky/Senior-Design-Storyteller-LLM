        "mainbody": "'''Duke Pwyll \"Greatshout\" Daggerford''' was the ruler of the duchy of [[Daggerford]] circa the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He defended his people during the [[Second Dragonspear War]] of [[1366 DR]], having become duke after his father's death in the [[First Dragonspear War]] seven years prior.<ref group=\"note\">[[The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier]] states that [[Pryden Daggerford|Duke Pryden]] died while fighting the \"forces of Dragonspear Castle\". This is believed to occur during the [[First Dragonspear War]] as Pwyll is already duke at the beginning of the [[Second Dragonspear War]], according to [[Hordes of Dragonspear]].\n\n{{quote|''Duke Pwyll Greatshout was almost the definition of \"benevolent\" ruler\". A former adventurer with some fighting ability, and yet in the end, better suited to bureaucracy than dragon-slaying. He was always popular with the people here, and was trusted to represent them well at council.''|[[Astriel Shalyn]]}}",
        "Possessions": "Among the duke's possessions was Daggerford's [[sword]]–of–state, ''[[Lawflame]]''. This ''[[flame tongue]]'' blade dated back to the town's first duke.",
        "Relationships": "Duke Pwyll was served well by his court [[wizard]] [[Gwydion pen Dafwyd]], Gwydion's apprentice (and Pwyll's sister) [[Bronwyn Caradoon|Bronwyn]], and his commander of the [[Army of Daggerford|Daggerford armed forces]], [[Llewellyn Longhand|Lord Llewellyn Longhand]].",
        "Activities": "He spent much of his time out of town hunting or exploring new opportunities and ways to make better the lives of his people. He often visited the [[Happy Cow]] tavern to mingle and talk to his subjects as well as to stay on top of Daggerford's rumor mill. There he often interacted with the establishment's manager [[Demetira Landscraper]], who later accompanied him on the faithful [[boar]] hunt.",
        "History": "Pwyll Daggerford was born around the {{YearlinkName|1322}}.\n\nAs a young man, Pwyll lived the life of a daring adventurer. That came to an end at the age of 25 when his brother [[Merovy Daggerford|Merovy]] died adventuring along the [[Unicorn Run]]. Pwyll's father [[Pryden Daggerford|Duke Pryden]] bid his son return home to Daggerford in order to learn how to properly rule their people. While he protested in spirit, Pwyll knew his true duty was to his people and not his own lifestyle.\n\nDuke Pryden fell in battle while fighting the armies of [[Dragonspear Castle]] during the First Dragonspear War, in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}. Pwyll succeeded him as duke and took command throughout the rest of the campaign. During the sacking of the castle itself, Pwyll found and readily drank from an unidentified [[potion]]. It gave him the ability to vocalize a \"great shout\" that blew foes away in battle.\n\nWhen the forces of the Dragonspear Castle began a [[Second Dragonspear War|second war]] in the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, Duke Pwyll raised the militia of Daggerford and locked down the town in order to keep it well-defended. This time, the armed forces of Daggerford were led by [[Dauravyn Redbeard]] and a band of adventurers, rather than their reigning duke.\n\nPwyll \"Greatshout\" met his perceived demise in [[1372 DR]] when he was presumed killed by a wild boar during a hunt. Daggerford mourned the death of the city's leader even though many found the circumstances surrounding his death highly suspicious. Shortly after, a wealthy merchant and a member of the city council [[Matagar Bugo]] proclaimed himself the new Duke. During Matagar's short reign, a group of adventurers alongside [[Astriel Shalyn]]''', '''an agent of the [[Lords of Waterdeep]], discovered a [[Zhentarim]] plot to instate a puppet ruler and take over Daggerford. Pwyll and his sister Bronwyn were kept alive in the mines of [[Illefarn]], guarded by Zhent slavers and the corrupt [[Griffons Mercenary Company]]. Astriel's adventures managed to rescue the Duke and his sister and aid the city against the united forces of the Zhentarim and [[Gorgomorz]]. Matagar Bugo's short dukedom came to an abrupt end in Gorgomorz' hellfire, and Pwyll Daggerford returned to his position as Duke of Daggerford.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Duke Pwyll claimed to be a descendant of [[Tyndal]], the young boy that slew six [[Lizardfolk|lizard men]] in Daggerford's founding story."
