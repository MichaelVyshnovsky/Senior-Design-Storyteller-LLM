Riviar Darkwind was the second-in-command of the Zhentarim military forces of Darkhold and the leader of the elite Storm Watch company in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Riviar disliked wizards (even Sememmon, though she kept this secret in her heart). She became attracted to Dag Zoreth and hoped he would gain preeminence against the wizards of Darkhold.
