'''Bacao Foo''' was a merchant in [[Suijeng]] in [[Shou Lung]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Bacao Foo was a friendly merchant who sat in restaurants waiting for the start of the [[Komite]]. He had made a plan to capitalize on the hungry crowds in the city, selling fresh meat from a herd of cattle that had been driven from [[Janshi]] in the south by his cattlemen and slaughtered afterward. He offered anyone a chance to invest in his business, requesting they pay in advance 6 [[ch'ien]] per cow; this was three times the normal price but with a guarantee to receive double in return.
