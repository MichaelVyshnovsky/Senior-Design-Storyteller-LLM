        "mainbody": "Rhenovia Swiftthorn was a fighter from the monastery of Palevashâ€Ž, active in the 14 century DR.\nBy the age of eighteen, Rhenovia proved herself to be a strong and rock-worn woman. She was as tough as the Koryaz Mountains from where she hailed from. Early on, she learned that if you do not stand up for important things, they never happen. Motivated by that philosophy, Rhenovia attempted to organize the women of Palevash into a political force to be reckoned with. However, the work was thwarted. She was defeated and banished from Palevash. As she moved on with her life and stepped into the role of an adventurer, her main goal was to find an intelligent, obedient, and beautiful male to take care of her home and produce a new generation of strong Swiftthorn girls.\nSometime in the 14 century DR, Rhenovia Swiftthorn was among the ambitious fortune seekers who were interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths."
