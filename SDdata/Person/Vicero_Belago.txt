}}'''Vicero Belago''' was an [[alchemist]] who conducted his work at the [[Edificant Library]] in the early 1360s [[DR]].

==Description==
The resident alchemist was known to produce several volatile potions, leading to his laboratory blowing up on occasion. A prime example of this is when the [[Chaos Curse]] was let loose upon the library, which led to the destruction of the workplace.

==Abilities==
The skilled alchemist concocted several [[oil]]s, especially the ''[[oil of impact]]'', a destructive substance often used to coat [[crossbow]] [[bolt]]s.

==Relationships==
Vicero was [[Cadderly Bonaduce]]'s friend, and believed him a hero. He often undertook a few privately funded tasks for Cadderly, mainly brewing expensive oils.

==History==
In [[1362 DR]], after Cadderly had defeated his arch-nemesis and father, [[Aballister Bonaduce]], Dean [[Thobicus]] angrily demanded Belago to see him. The alchemist readily made his way to see the dean, who berated him. Thobicus, who was involved in a power struggle with Vicero's friend Cadderly, did not trust him. The dean enacted his powers upon the wiry alchemist; Vicero stiffened and fell back out of the room.The wiry alchemist then fled to Carradoon.

Belago later appeared in the library, where he met up with Cadderly and his companions. Belago offered Cadderly further ''[[oil of impact|oils of impact]]'', but was very anxious and scared of the idea of dealing with the [[undead]] in the library, to the point of physically trembling. When asked if he wished to leave it to the others, the alchemist gained resolve and became a great help to the companions.
