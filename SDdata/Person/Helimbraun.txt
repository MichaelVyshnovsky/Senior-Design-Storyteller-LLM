'''Helimbraun''' was one of the leading [[Lords of Imphras II]] who governed the kingdom of [[Impiltur]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He had a strong voice within the council, often deciding what "was best" for the realm along with hes fellow outspoken lords [[Limbrar]] and [[Oriseus]].

==Description==
Shortly before the young [[Imbrar II|Crown prince Imbrar II]] was to come of age and claim the throne as king of the nation, in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Helimbraun suddenly became extremely fervent in his aim to "root all evil" from the realm. He suggested his fellow councilors were lacking in morality and admonished them for expressing tolerance in the face of matters he deemed unacceptable.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}

==Relationships==
Although the Lords of Imphras often disagreed with one another, Limbrar, Oriseus and Helimbraun served as their ''de facto'' leaders for many years during the reign of [[Sambryl|Queen-regent Sambryl]].

Helimbraun's sudden, newfound zeal was strongly opposed by his former ally Limbrar. The latter attributed this attitude to the breakdown of the relationship between the formerly united triumvirate that guided the council of lords.
