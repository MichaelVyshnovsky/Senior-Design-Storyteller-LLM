        "mainbody": "Kinnuki was the ancient Reghedmen barbarian prince that resided alone in the Sea of Moving Ice, trading knucklehead trout and animal furs with his few contacts from the Ten Towns, Icewind Dale circa 1369 DR.\nKinnuki was a hulking giant of a man,  tall and weighed . In his old age, his skin showed the papery-thin quality, stretched loose on his muscled body. His skin was tanned from constant exposure to the bright arctic sun and darkened even more so with age spots. His once blond, gray hair was kept long and braided.\nHis garb consisted of polar bear pelts and skins, with the animals skull and upper jaw worn as a headpiece. The furs provided him with warmth and camouflage on the blinding white of the arctic.\nKinnuki had an intimidating presence thanks to his size and outfit, but he was a kind soul, to almost selfless levels, and quick to help strangers.\nKinnuki was an expert at survival, he lived off hunting and foraging in the harshest areas of the Sea of Moving Ice. He was proficient in fishing, using his spear and ax for both, hunting and battling. He possessed expansive knowledge of his peoples culture and history. He did not speak common.\nKinnuki did not own much after his tribes demise. His enormous magical +2 great axes handle was covered with intricately engraved designs, and the head was carved out of obsidian. Both the axe and his magical +1 12-ft. hunting spear were trapped to his muscular back.\nHis wrists were armored with bracers of defense, and he wore a ring of elemental command, that allowed the barbarian prince to move through the ice and acted as the ring of warmth, protecting him from the elements.\nA silver pendant decorated with an image of a bear battling an elk. hung around his neck. It was another magical item in Kinnukis possession, it allowed the barbarian to detect animals in a 120-ft. radius.\nThe only item he considered absolutely priceless was the intricately detailed carving of a woman. The figurine was yellowed with age but appeared life-like almost like a tiny living sprite. The figurine depicted his daughter Jukini.\nKinnuki used to have a tribe, a loving mate Mathilda, and a daughter Jukini. All were gone and the barbarian prince decided to live in solitude.\nThe barbarian was friends with both Regis and Drizzt DoUrden, the heroes of Icewind Dale. They often traded and encountered each other in the regions wilderness.\nCirca 1269 DR, a necromancer from Luskan arrived at Icewind Dale on his quest to discover eternal life away from the prying eyes of fellow mages. His name was Damien Morienus, his wife - Mathilda. He used the holy sight of Kinnukis tribe to mold rocks into the Accursed Tower where he was performing his evil experiments. The display of his power led Kinnukis tribe to worship his as an earth god.\nThe necromancer used local and sick tribesmen to experiment on, while Reghedmen were too scared of the \"gods\" powers to intervene. Eventually, Kinnuki grew infuriated with the necromancers activities and he decided to confront the wizard. Instead, he met Mathilda, who realized how evil and absent her husband has become. They fell in love and eventually had a daughter, Jukini. Mathilda was a kind and caring and compassionate person who aided Kinukis tribe with her healing skills.\nThe lovers fled from Damiens wrath. The necromancer did not feel love for his wife, only felt insulted because of losing something that belonged to him. Enraged Damien summoned demons and sent them to avenge his pride. The demons were pursuing the barbarians for a long while, eventually, they decided to use their hellfire to melt the tundra. This event came to be known as the Great Thaw. Kinnukis tribe and Mathilda perished in the disaster when the ice broke from under the camps feet. Leaving the barbarian prince with no kin, only his daughter Jukini survived the Thaw but she suffered terribly in the freezing waters. She died a few days later from severe fever.\nAt some point, Kinnuki came to know a halfling from Lonelywood named Regis. The barbarian found Regis frozen and lost amid the snow and nursed him back to health. This is when Regis was taught the ancient Reghedmen bone carving techniques. After that encounter, Regis started regularly trading with Kinnuki as he had always could find the biggest knucklehead trouts.\nBy 1369 DR Kinnuki decided to live the rest of his life on the ice of the Sea of Moving Ice. One day he received a visit from a group of adventurers on the search for the Accursed Tower. They were able to find Kinnuki with the help of the drow ranger Drizzt DoUrden, Regis friend. The drow translated for the adventurers Kinnukis story of the necromancer and his lost tower. Kinnuki accompanied the heroes hack to Drizzts camp - the Lone Tree, protected them from the wildlife, and while in the camp overnight, fed them a good meal of caribou venison and fish"
