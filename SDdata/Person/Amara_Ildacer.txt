Amara Ildacer was the second-in-command of the NVaelahr of Myth Drannor during the Weeping War.
Amara was born in 8 DR as a member of the Audark clan.
Amara at one point joined the Harpers in Twilight. In 711 DR, Amara and Aolis Ildacer, after a meeting with the Grand Mage Ualair, Arms-Major Kelvhan Olortynnal, and Councilor Phraan Audark, decided to create the NVaelahr, a covert army.
In 712 DR, Aolis devised and supported the Spiders Truce, a secret alliance with the drow of House Dhuurniv in exchange for the drows possession of the Twisted Tower of Ashaba. Despite being viewed as traitors, the allied Dhuurniv–NVaelahr troops fought very well against the Army of Darkness. In Midwinter–Alturiak 1 of 713 DR, Aolis fell alongside Matron Mother Laele Dhuurniv, and the Spider Truce was ended. In that battle, Laele killed Aolis from behind but afterward was quickly killed by Amara.
As the new leader of the NVaelahr, she continued to fight, despite no longer being permitted dealings with Myth Drannors army for NVaelahrs bad reputation.
Amara survived the citys fall and died in 821 DR.
Amara and her husband Aolis were both able AkhFaer officers.
Only Amara and her husband knew the identities of the Councilors that supported the NVaelahr.
