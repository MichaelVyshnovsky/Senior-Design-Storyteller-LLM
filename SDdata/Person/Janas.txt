'''Janas''' was one of the [[Blades of the Old Man]] as of {{yearlink|1374}}. He possessed a [[short sword]] and a ''[[Topsider's Crutch]]'', given unto him by [[Talieth]] as part of his induction in {{yearlink|1371}}, which meant he got guard duty far too often. He was afraid of [[Sauk]], remembering what he had done to [[Chiganis]]. According to [[Ferluk]], he was a [[Nar]]. He joined Talieth's conspiracy to kill the [[Old Man of the Mountain]] a few months before his death. On the night of [[Tarsakh 25]], he was on guard duty at the [[Fortress of the Old Man]]; after distracting him with his [[treeclaw lizard]], [[Perch]], the [[ranger]] [[Berun]] killed him while making his way in.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||29}}
