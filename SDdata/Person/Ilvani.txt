'''Ilvani''' was the witch of [[Ikemmu]] in the [[Shadowfell]] and the twin sister of [[Natan]], the former high priest of Ikemmu.  In [[1479 DR]], Ilvani was sent on an expedition to scout an area of the Shadowfell north of Ikemmu.  Her party was captured by a [[shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] enclave and most of the members were tortured to death.  Ilvani survived her imprisonment and was rescued by a group lead by the Ikemmu warrior [[Vedoran]].	

A young Shadar-kai in the rescue party named [[Ashok]] was falsely accused of conspiring against Ikemmu by Vedoran.  Ilvani destroyed a crucial piece of evidence against Ashok although Ashok was still imprisoned.

In [[1480 DR]], Ilvani began having disturbing visions.  In some of the visions, the ghost of a [[Rashemen|Rashemi]] witch appeared to her.  The visions continued to worsen and whenever Ilvani was near shadow creatures they would go berserk.{{Cite digital book/The Darker Road}}

Along with Ashok, [[Cree]] and [[Skagi]], Ilvani traveled with a caravan led by [[Tatigan Carrlock]] to Rashemen to seek the source of the visions.  The visions were caused by the spirit of a witch named [[Yaraella]] who had been murdered by [[Sree]],a [[Witches of Rashemen|Wychlaren]].  Ilvani confronted Sree and put Yaraella's spirit to rest which ended the hauntings.  She agreed to remain in Rashemen for a while to help train Yaraella's daughter.{{Cite digital book/The Darker Road}}

==Mental State==
Ilvani is nearly insane although she has occasional moments of lucidity.  Her imprisonment and torture appear to have worsened her mental condition.  After Yaraella's spirit was put to rest her mental condition improved remarkably.{{Cite digital book/The Darker Road}}

==Appearance==
Ilvani has pale red hair and is very thin.
