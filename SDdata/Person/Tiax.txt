'''Tiax''' was a wandering [[cleric]] of [[Cyric]] who wandered [[west Faer√ªn]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{Quote|When Tiax rules, the stones of this city shall build his castle.|Tiax}}

==Personality==
Not nearly as mad as his god, but insane nonetheless, Tiax claimed that Cyric had granted him visions of world domination. He made it his life's mission to fulfill those visions by attempting to create a worldwide theocracy in Cyric's name. Tiax was not very successful in this endeavor, but it did not stop him from reminding everyone whom he met of his goal. Over and over again.

He always referred to himself by name and spoke in the third person perspective.

==Abilities==
Tiax had the innate ability to summon [[ghast]]s.

==History==
In the late 1360s DR, Tiax was proselytizing in the streets of [[Baldur's Gate]].

Some time later Tiax took a job with several other adventurers tasked with escorting a bride-in-waiting and her rather large dowry, to the home of her groom in [[Amn]]. With him were the noble [[paladin]] [[Ajantis Ilvastarr|Ajantis]], the warrior [[Shar-Teel Dosan]], the [[ranger]] [[Kivan]], and [[Eldoth Kron]]. Unfortunately it appeared that during a fight with [[hobgoblin]]s Tiax was utterly destroyed by some [[magic]]al blast.{{Cite comic/Baldur's Gate}}<ref group="note">In the ''Baldur's Gate'' comic, Tiax only has one line but it seems out-of-character for his personality.

He got better, though, and traveled south to [[Amn]], where he was subsequently captured by the [[Cowled Wizards]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. He was imprisoned within the island asylum of [[Spellhold]] for being a "deviant" spellcaster.
