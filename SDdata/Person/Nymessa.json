The refugees came under the leadership of the exiled Hellrider known as Zevlor. The group traveled west towards the sprawling metropolis of Baldurs Gate, and eventually took refuge at the Emerald Grove after goblin bands harried their march along the road.\nAfter settling into the Emerald Grove the githyanki known as Laezel stumbled into a trap just outside the sanctuarys walls, and was soon discovered by Nymessa and her companion Damays. Nymessa exclaimed that the \"thing\" was dangerous, and that they should just let goblins come and kill her. Damays believed that it might be possible for Laezel to escape."
