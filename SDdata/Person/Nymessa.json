        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Nymessa and all the other tieflings within were exiled from Elturel following [[the Descent|the city's brief descent]] into the [[Nine Hells]]. The refugees came under the leadership of the exiled [[Hellrider]] known as [[Zevlor]]. The group traveled west towards the sprawling metropolis of [[Baldur's Gate]], and eventually took refuge at the [[Emerald Grove]] after [[goblin]] bands harried their march along the road.\n\nAfter settling into the Emerald Grove the [[githyanki]] known as [[Lae'zel]] stumbled into a trap just outside the sanctuary's walls, and was soon discovered by Nymessa and her companion [[Damays]]. Nymessa exclaimed that the \"thing\" was dangerous, and that they should just let [[goblin]]s come and kill her. Damays believed that it might be possible for Lae'zel to escape."
