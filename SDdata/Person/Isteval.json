        "Possessions": "When in public, Isteval was rarely seen without his ''+1 [[plate mail]]'' and his ''+1 [[greatsword]]''.

        "History": "Isteval's place of birth was the Cormyrian town of [[Eveningstar]]. He joined the [[Purple Dragons]] while still a teenager, and was noted for his impeccable character. His desire to bring justice and defend his country brought him into conflict with many enemies in various locations. He fought against the vicious [[orc]] bands of the [[Stonelands]], dispatched [[Zhentarim]] agents along the western frontier, and made a valiant stand in [[Thunder Gap]] against [[Sembian]] raiders.\n\nLater, he led at least three groups of adventurers on missions in an effort to bring justice and goodness, and spread Cormyr's influence. The first company of adventurers went to the [[Western Heartlands]]. The second followed Isteval to battle corruption around the [[Moonsea]].\n\nAround [[1471 DR]] into the [[Vilhon Wilds]] and the [[Winterwood]]. During this time, Isteval and the rest of his company entered the lair of the [[dracolich]], [[Dretchroyaster]], to retrieve the ''[[Diamond Staff of Chomylla]]''. Here, Isteval battled a [[black dragon]] within the adjacent caverns. Some time later, Isteval wounded his leg in battle against a [[green dragon]]. The wound resisted magical healing and he walked with a cane afterwards.\n\nSir Isteval lived out his retirement in Daggerford until he felt that others needed to follow the shining example that was his homeland, so he gathered individuals with the same ideals and set forth to combat evil and chaos once more.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = \"Against Tiamat, we either stand together or fall alone.
