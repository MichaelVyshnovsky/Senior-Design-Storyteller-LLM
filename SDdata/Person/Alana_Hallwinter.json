        "mainbody": "Alana Hallwinter was a resident of Phandalin in the late 15 century DR. She was the adopted daughter of Sildar Hallwinter.\nShe was a capable miner who wore ribbons in her hair.\nAlana was a smart but foolhardy girl. She was said to be obsessed with stories of fine ladies and was a fan of pretty things like ribbons and flowers.\nShe was close friends with a trio of dwarves and fellow teenagers named Nedd Angelite, Sasha Flint, and Grace Hardstone.\nHer father, Sildar, was very protective of her and did not trust her to track or travel alone in the woods. Even so, he permitted her to travel unsupervised as far afield from Phandalin as Swallow Lake to swim with her friends.\nWhen she was a teenager in the 1490s DR, she became concerned when her three dwarven friends&mdashNedd, Sasha, and Grace&mdashdisappeared into the Crooked Forest while seeking proof of some of the things they had read about in the newly-published Volos Guide to Monsters. She decided to go look for them, but did not tell her father. Instead, she told him that she was meeting with her friends to go swimming, and left a note explaining her true intentions for him to find later. When he discovered it, he feared that the teens disappearance could start a panic, and so he concealed the information from the townsfolk and from his fellow members of the Town Council of Phandalin. Feeling like he was unable to go after her without alerting the town to the disappearances, he instead sought out adventurers and offered to reward them not only for finding his daughter, but for their discretion.\nMeanwhile, Alana had met with the same fate as her friends in the Crooked Forest she was captured by gnolls, who blindfolded her and took her to their camp. Although bleeding and terrified, Alana managed to remove her blindfold and sneakily leave a trail for any rescuers to follow by tying ten of her ribbons onto branches as her captors carried her deeper into the forest and higher into the trees. During this episode, she caught a glimpse of Gavmogon, although did not realize what it was."
