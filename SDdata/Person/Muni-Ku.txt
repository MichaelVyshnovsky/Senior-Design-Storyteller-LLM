Muni-Ku was a elder storyteller in Wa around 1357 DR.
Once Muni-Ku was a cook in service of of the daimyo of Tifuido like her mother and her grandmother. One day she noticed that the head cook had prepared a soup for the daimyo accidentally using poisoned mushrooms. Nodoby believed to Muni-Ku that as last resort ate herself the soup, saving the daimyo and condemning herself. In the hour of her death Muni-Ku was visited by the dwarf god Suku-nabiko that thank to a ghostly mouth insured in her mouth saved her, also granting to Muni-Ku a great knowledge of world. From that day Muni-Ku traveled across all of Wa, telling stories and legends. At 80 years of age she continued her travels in perfect health, though nobody truly understood from where Muni-ku had gained her health and knowledge.
