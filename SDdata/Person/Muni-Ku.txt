'''Muni-Ku''' was a elder storyteller in [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Once Muni-Ku was a cook in service of of the [[daimyo]] of [[Tifuido]] like her mother and her grandmother. One day she noticed that the head cook had prepared a [[soup]] for the daimyo accidentally using [[poison]]ed [[mushroom]]s. Nodoby believed to Muni-Ku that as last resort ate herself the soup, saving the daimyo and condemning herself. In the hour of her death Muni-Ku was visited by the dwarf god [[Suku-nabiko]] that thank to a ghostly mouth insured in her mouth saved her, also granting to Muni-Ku a great knowledge of world. From that day Muni-Ku traveled across all of Wa, telling stories and legends. At 80 years of age she continued her travels in perfect health, though nobody truly understood from where Muni-ku had gained her health and knowledge.
