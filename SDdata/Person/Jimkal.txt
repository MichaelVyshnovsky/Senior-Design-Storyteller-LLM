Jimkal was a drow mage of legends and stories who lived in Menzoberranzan ages before the late 14 century DR.
According to the tales common in the City of Spiders, Jimkal was a male from one of the houses of Menzoberranzan who was forced into exile after his house fell victim to another ambitious drow family. Down on his luck and with nothing in his possessions, Jimkal pleaded with the ruling matron mothers of Menzoberranzan for a simple pair of boots to protect his feed during the long travel across the Underdark. The cruel matrons granted the mage his request but also transformed his body into that of a drider to render him unable to wear these boots. Were the story truthful or not, a unique pair of enchanted boots called Jimkals boots existed and was said to be footwear given to Jimkal by the matron mothers.
