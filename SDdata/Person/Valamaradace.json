        "mainbody": "'''Valamaradace''', the [[Dragon]] Queen of [[Silverymoon]], was an ancient [[gold dragon]] who inhabited the ''Floating Mountain'', an enormous hollow rock that hovered above the woods east and south of [[Everlund]].",
        "Description": "As a dragon, Valamaradace was longer than most gold dragons of her age, but she had substantially less mass and was more serpentine in build. Her claws were long and narrow, looking almost like humanoid fingers.\n\nValamaradace frequently disguised herself as '''Tagarda''', a small female [[human]] with [[elven]] looks and some magical skill. She also adopted many other different disguises.",
        "Personality": "Valamaradace was kind and emphatic. She made constant efforts to understand and accommodate the needs of everyone she met and, for that reason, she had a clearer understanding of other races than most dragons.\n\nShe also loved acting and showed a great sense of humor when in disguise.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], Valamaradace's personality changed radically, as she became more interested in hunting down [[evil]] creatures than to protect her subjects, from whom she grew more detached over the years.",
        "Abilities": "The Dragon Queen had considerable skill in [[magic]]. She knew a substantial number of [[spell]]s.",
        "Possessions": "The ancient dragon possessed a powerful artifact known as the ''[[Crown of the Mountain]]'', which provided considerable protection against the elements and gave access to many spells. She knew only how to partially access its powers.\n\nIt was also said that her [[spellbook]]s held every [[ritual]] known to mortals.",
        "Activities": "[[File:Valamaradace 2e.png|thumb|''Valamaradace's favorite guises were of [[elf|elven]] or [[human]] maidens.'']]\nValamaradace claimed the entire region of the [[Moonwood]] as her domain, as well as encompassing [[Sundabar]], [[Turlang]], and the encompassed region north of the [[Dessarin]] between the [[Lost Peaks]] and [[Flint Rock]].\n\nThe Dragon Queen treated her domain as a garden. She used her acting skills to help others and to give the impression that many different people other than herself and her consort patrolled her domain for evil creatures and attacked predators.\n\nTheir lair was an enormous elliptic floating rock known as the ''Floating Mountain'', which Valamaradace and her consort called Softwing.",
        "Relationships": "Valamaradace's consort was the [[silver dragon]] [[wyrm]] [[Deszeldaryndun Silverwing]].",
        "History": "Valamaradace inherited the title of Dragon Queen and Softwing from the [[red dragon]] [[Mairogra]] in [[826 DR]] after the latter's death at the hands of adventurers. Mairogra bestowed upon Valamaradace the title in her last hours of life in gratitude for Valamaradace's compassion in easing the pain from her mortal wounds.\n\nDuring the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]], Valamaradace and Deszeldaryndun were driven to attack each other due to the ensuing madness. They were stopped from killing each other by [[Alustriel Silverhand]] and pledged to watch over the [[Silver Marches]] in gratitude. Alustriel also secretly named Valamaradace as her heir.\n\nAfter the Spellplague, Valamaradace grew apart from Deszeldaryndun, as their interests diverged. They took different paths, although they helped each other on occasion. After Alustriel was declared dead, and considering her descendants not worthy of her help, Valamaradace focused on her new quest to rid the world of evil."
