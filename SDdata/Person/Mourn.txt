'''Mourn''' was a [[drow]] assassin in [[Evermeet]] in [[1367 DR]].
  
==History==
Mourn was a member of a drow House destroyed in one of the typical drow civil wars. He was spared when he agreed to give up his name and work as an assassin for other Houses. He worked very well, killing drow renegades and enemies of the drow and becoming a very efficient killing machine.

In 1367 DR, Mourn was tasked with the mission to kill [[Karsel'lyn Lylyl-Lytherraias]] in order to stop her proposal of a drow participation in the [[Retreat]]. He arrived on the isle unknown to everyone and was waiting for the right time for action.
