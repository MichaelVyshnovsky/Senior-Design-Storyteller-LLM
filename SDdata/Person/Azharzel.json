        "mainbody": "zharzel was a blue dragon dracolich.\nAt one point, a former high-ranking member of the Waterclock Guild and secret member of the Cult of the Dragon named Romani Monini secreted Azharzel in the Waterclock Guilds Crypts along with the ritual to create a dracolich. Circa , both the Dragon Cultists and the Thayan minions of Valindra Shadowmantle searched for the dragon. Though the Cult of the Dragon breached the crypt first, Valindra killed them and took both the dragon and the ritual, which she promptly used to turn Azharzel into a dracolich.\nSoon after Azharzel became a dracolich, he was destroyed at Castle Never by the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge."
