        "mainbody": "Aeso was a junior Selûnite priest at Moonshadow Hall in Yhaunn during the late 14 century DR.\nIn the year 1373 DR, Aeso served at Moonshadow Hall under High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar and Moonmistress-Designate Feena Archwood. After Feena infected Dhauna with lycanthropy and fled Yhaunn, Aeso joined a party of Selûnites who pursued her, along with the senior priests Mifano and Velsinore. Led on a false trail by fellow priestess Julith Harkspur and the renegade Sharran Keph Thingoleir, the Selûnite party captured the rogue pair instead. Upon realizing that they had found a Sharran agent, Aeso was overcome with loathing and struck Keph in the face with his elbow, with Mifano admonishing him for it."
