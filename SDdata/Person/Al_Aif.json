        "mainbody": "'''Al'Aif''' was a warrior [[Mtair Dhafir]] tribe during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|The invaders will make drudges of our [[camel]]s and slaves of our warriors. I would rather die with my enemy's blood on my blade.|Al'Aif on acquiescing to the [[Zhentarim]].}}",
        "Description": "He was considered to be the most fearsome Mtairi warrior during his time. His face bore a scar brought on by the slash of a dagger as well as four claw marks that were left by a [[lion]].",
        "Personality": "Al'Aif was a man of honor that believe that people should honor the traditional ways of the Bedine. He was particularly distrustful of all forms of magic.",
        "Relationships": "Al'Aif garnered great trust and respect from Sheikh [[Sabkhat]], leader of the Mtairi people.",
        "History": "{{Quote|I do what I do for reasons of my own. I never intended to let Sheikh Sabkhat send you–or anyone else–to the Zhentarim.|Al'Aif, upon releasing those framed for Zarud's murder.}}\n\nThe stalwart warrior was distrusting of the [[Zhent]] warrior [[Zarud]], when he appealed to Sheikh Sabkhat for an alliance in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}. When it was revealed that Zarud and his [[Yhekal|assistant]] had used magic in their talks, Al'Aif broke the tradition of hospitality and took his ''[[jambiya]]'' to Zarud's throat. Al'Aif and the sheikh's daughter [[Ruha]] managed to talk some sense into Sabkhat, and the agreement was not formalized nor anyone physically harmed. Al'Aif disagreed with the sheikh's decision not to strike back against the invaders.\n\nThat night Zarud was killed by the [[Harper]] agent [[Lander]], his throat slit in the same manner that Al'Aif previously threatened. All signs of the Zhent's death pointed to Ruha and her brother-in-law [[Kadumi]] of the [[Qahtan]]i. Sheikh Sabkhat arranged for both of them along with Lander to be bound and confined to a single tent until they were to be given over to the Zhentarim as compensation. Al'Aif freed the pair, took the blame for Zarud's death, and gave them supplies to make their escape from the Mtairi camp."
