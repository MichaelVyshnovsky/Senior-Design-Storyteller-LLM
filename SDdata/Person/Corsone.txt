Corsone was a member of the Shadow Druids who lived on the Sword Coast during the midâ€“14 century DR.
The druid was not above using deceit and murder to achieve his goals.
Like other Shadow Druids, he believed the best way to fight the encroachment of civilization was by might and force.
Corsone was an associate of the Malarite druid Osmadi, who maintained a shrine in the forest of Larswood. In fact, he saw his "friend" and his druidic allies as weak, believing them to stand in the way of the progress sought by the Shadow Druids.
In the , Corsone poisoned Osmadi, causing him to go mad and slay his fellow druids. He concocted a story about how the group was attacked by bandits.
