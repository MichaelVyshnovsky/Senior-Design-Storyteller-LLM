        "mainbody": "'''Ghaelya''' was a [[watersoul genasi]] from [[Airspur]].  She was born into a wealthy family and had a twin sister.  Unlike the other members of her family who manifested fire, she manifested the element of water.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], Ghaelya's sister, Tessaeril, became involved with a cult known as [[The Choir]].  The cult later kidnapped Tessaeril and took her to their shrine in [[Tohrepur]].  Ghaelya hired a [[half-elf]] named [[Brindani]] to guide her to Tohrepur and he enlisted the help of an old mercenary friend named [[Uthalion]] and his companion [[Vaasurri]] who lived in the [[Spur Forest]].  The four traveled to Tohrepur where they slew [[Khault|Lord Kahult]], the leader of The Choir.  Unfortunately, Tessaeril had been transformed into an [[aberration]] by a [[Spellplague]] changed [[sirine]] and Ghaelya was forced to kill her sister to end her suffering.",
