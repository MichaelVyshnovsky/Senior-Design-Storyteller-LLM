'''Alhazmabad''' was a [[copper dragon]] who lived on the temporally challenged island of [[Lurath]] in the [[Pirate Isles]].

==Activities==
The island of Lurath contained several time-piercing portals leading to a distant past when the Pirate Isles were a mountain range. Alhazmabad was the ruler of this time-lost realm. He was aware of the time portals, but could do nothing to close them, nor could he pass through them.
