        "mainbody": "'''Knellict''' was the [[archmage]] of [[Vaasa]], an advisor to [[Zhengyi]] the Witch King, and later a member of the [[Citadel of Assassins]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "He was usually brooding and quiet, and seemed emotionless.",
        "History": "Though his true age and origins were unknown, Knellict was generally assumed to be over two or three centuries old as of the mid–1300s [[DR]].\n\nFor several decades, Knellict was an advisor to the king of Vaasa. But the king feared Knellict's power and tried to have him assassinated. The archmage survived, and so did the assassins—albeit ''[[polymorph]]ed'' into [[cockroach]]es.\n\nAfter the attempt on his life, Knellect left service to the king and became the principle advisor to Zhengyi himself. However, even the Witch King feared him and so transferred him to the [[Citadel of Assassins]] to serve the [[Grandfather of Assassins]] instead. In this capacity, Knellict was part of the bandit army sent against [[Bloodstone Village]] as part of Zhengyi's war between Vaasa and [[Damara]].\n\nAfter Zhengyi's fall at the hands of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and party, Knellict remained with the Citadel of Assassins, where he was second only to [[Timoshenko]]. In some ways, Knellict was the real power within the Citadel since Timoshenko generally followed all of Knellict's advice, such as forming ties to the [[Tightpurse]] thieves guild in [[Heliogabalus]], and Knellict had free reign to do as he pleased.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the Citadel of Assassins was once again brought under the influence of another power. This time it was the mercenary band, [[Bregan D'aerthe]] from [[Menzoberranzan]]. With minimal effort [[Jarlaxle]] and the powerful [[psionicist]], [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]], subdued Knellict and persuaded him to swear loyalty to Bregan D'aerthe. Quietly raging inside, Knellict agreed to Jarlaxle's demands...for now.<ref>"
