'''Nya''' was a [[half-elven]] [[necromancer]] wizard from the town of [[Port Llast]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|It seems the shepherd has sent his Luskan dogs to do his bidding. You'll find I am no helpless sheep! If you are loyal to Rynn Shepherde, there is nothing to discuss.|Nya the Necromancer of Port Llast}}

==Description==
Nya was a comely young woman with closely buzzed hair. She had pale skin and gaunt cheeks. Her eyes betrayed the suffering the woman endured in the past.

==Possessions==
The [[tome]] in which Nya kept her necromantic magic was a big book wrapped in leather and decorated with small animal bones. It contained descriptions of many necromantic rituals. Some of the rituals inside included necessary steps in creating a ''[[phylactery]]'' to trap a soul in and live forever. Another ritual of note detailed a way of releasing a soul trapped inside a ''phylactery'' and restoring the magical prison or a vessel.

Nya also carried a number of [[scrolls]], including ''[[create undead]]'', ''[[raise dead]]'', ''[[false life]]'', and ''[[detect undead]]''.

==History==
[[File:Nya's stall.png|thumb|''Nya's stall in Port Llast.''|330x330px]]
During the [[Shadow War]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Nya made a living by running a herbalist's stall in the market of Port Llast. She was always busy, too busy even to tidy up her goods. After the village of [[Ember]] was put to the [[torch]] by [[Luskan]], Nya provided the adventurer known as [[Kalach-Cha]] with [[wyrmsage]] extract, a substance that ensured the slaughtered villagers would not return as the undead.

In the years that followed the Shadow War, Port Llast's neighbor – the city of Luskan, saw an opportunity in a weakened state of [[Neverwinter]], its economy still recovering from the two recent wars. Luskan sent a force to claim the port city. This prompted the undead of Gothaladreum to rise and walk the streets of Port Llast every night.

Nya, who possessed some necromantic knowledge, took drastic measures in an attempt to get rid of the usurpers. She ventured into Port Last's graveyard – [[Gothaladreum]] and used her necromantic magic to disturb and raise the spirits and bodies of the dead. She hoped to drive the invaders out by any means, even if they were less than savory. When a band of adventurers arrived in town in order to deal with the unrest, they trashed the necromancer and confronted her. Subsequently, they were faced with a choice: secure [[ghost]]ly Lord [[Adreum VI]] and his undead servants' help against the Luskanites, or side with the necromancer and her enslaving of the undead. One way or another, the Luskanite occupation ended, but it was unknown if Nya aided the adventurers, was convinced to abandon necromancy, or was killed in the process as [[Rynn Shepherde]] of Luskan wanted her executed.
