'''Ri'ola'kirk''' was the protege of the eadar of [[As'arem]].

==History==
His father was killed during the [[Twelfth Serôs War]] in a battle to protect the [[Ys'ivis]] hatcheries.

As the only heir of the eadar [[Ri'ola'con]] following the war, Ri'ola'kirk had to abandon his life as a [[ranger]] in order to be instructed by the old shalarin. However, he was often distracted by his affection for the young shalarin [[dukar]] [[Ka'ioa'Tara]] and his hunts in new waters with [[triton]]s and dukars.

==Relationships==
Ri'ola'kirk was in his younger years in [[Os'dahr]] a friend of the new young queen of [[Es'roch]] [[Ri'ena'wyn]].
