{{quote|''This place is strange... but sturdy! I had not thought the Maze would lead me here – but a pleasant surprise it is!''|Umoja on traveling to the [[Crossroad Keep]]}}

==Personality==
Umoja viewed life as a maze, constantly looking for the best path through it. Many considered him strange and cryptic, yet confident.

==Possessions==
The druid carried a unique [[enchanted]] [[sickle]] – ''[[Umoja's Harvester]]'', and a set of magic [[Umoja's armor|hide armor]].

==Activities==
[[Dinosaur]]s were known as Ubtao's Children, and as a devote follower, Umoja always attempted to calm those that tried to attack the people he traveled with rather than fighting them. His [[animal companion]] was [[deinonychus]] named [[Yushai]]. Umoja treated the beast with gentle care and affection.

==History==
Unlike many other Tabaxi druids of Ubtao who rarely ventured far from their home city of [[Mezro]], Umoja found himself guided by his deity's will to the neighboring nation of [[Samarach]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. Ubtao's visions were targeting the new interloper deity [[Zehir]], rising along with his [[yuan-ti]] minions. For a while after his arrival, the Tabaxi was able to gain entry to the city of [[Samargol]], where he waited for the god's further guidance while he made a living through divine healing magics.
