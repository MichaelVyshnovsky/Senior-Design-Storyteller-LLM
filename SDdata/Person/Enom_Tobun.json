        "mainbody": "Enom Tobun was a teamster just before the Tyranny of Dragons.\nEnom loved telling stories, not caring for the truthfulness of them. If someone question this, he grew resentful and vindictive. On the other hand, he was a wonderful traveling companion.\nEnom had driven caravans across all Faerun, from Waterdeep to Calimport and from Baldurs Gate to Hillsfar.\nAt the start of the Tyranny of Dragons in 1489, Enom acted as teamster to a great caravan, which unknown to him was full of Cult of the Dragon agents transporting treasures for the Hoard of the Dragon Queen."
