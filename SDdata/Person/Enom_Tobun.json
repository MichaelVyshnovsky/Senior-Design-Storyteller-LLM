        "History": "Enom had driven caravans across all [[Faerun]], from [[Waterdeep]] to [[Calimport]] and from [[Baldur's Gate]] to [[Hillsfar]].\n\nAt the start of the [[Tyranny of Dragons]] in [[1489 DR|1489]], Enom acted as teamster to a great caravan, which unknown to him was full of [[Cult of the Dragon]] agents transporting treasures for the [[Hoard of the Dragon Queen]]."
