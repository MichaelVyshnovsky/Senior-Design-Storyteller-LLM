        "mainbody": "Colderan Morn was a male human wizard and once a tyrannical Mage-lord of Daggerdale. He was also the great-grandfather of the famous Randal Morn.\nColderan was a rather corpulent man who dressed in rich clothing and his short, chubby fingers would often hold a staff.\nAlthough infamous for his tyrannical rule, Colderan had a strong romantic streak, often showering bards with gold in exchange for tales of tragic love or hard-won romance. He was also a sucker for pretty women.\nThe wealth of Colderan from plundering dwarves and taxing his populace was uncounted but he was noted for a few unique items of his own making. His ring of thorns granted him numerous powers over plants and could be recharged, though only Colderan knew how.\nIn 1267 DR, many years before Randal Morn reclaimed Daggerdale from the Zhentarim, Colderan ruled the dale with an iron fist. Colderan battled and eventually slew Elshar Kurl, the chief priest and Dorn the Grim, the clan leader in Eagles Eyrie while the rest of their clan escaped to Tethyamar. This deed caused the Brightblade dwarves to refuse to give any aid to the decendants of the Morn family, including Randal Morn.\nSome time later, Colderans wife Belesaria lost her life to poison, which he blamed on the dwarves til his dying days. However the truth of the matter is that it was his drow allies who poisoned her, unbeknownst to him.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryMembers of the Morn family\nCategoryInhabitants of Constables Tower\nCategoryInhabitants of Dagger Falls\nCategoryInhabitants of Daggerdale\nCategoryInhabitants of the Dalelands\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryRulers\nCategoryInhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands\nsp5hnh8gjjplqud8t4p8ic8pvrj44u0"
