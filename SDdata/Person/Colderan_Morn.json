        "mainbody": "'''Colderan Morn''' was a male [[human]] [[wizard]] and once a tyrannical Mage-lord of [[Daggerdale]]. He was also the great-grandfather of the famous [[Randal Morn]].",
        "Description": "Colderan was a rather corpulent man who dressed in rich clothing and his short, chubby fingers would often hold a [[staff]].",
        "Personality": "Although infamous for his tyrannical rule, Colderan had a strong romantic streak, often showering [[bards]] with [[gold]] in exchange for tales of tragic love or hard-won romance. He was also a sucker for pretty women.",
        "Possessions": "The wealth of Colderan from plundering [[dwarves]] and taxing his populace was uncounted but he was noted for a few unique items of his own making. His ''[[ring of thorns]]'' granted him numerous powers over plants and could be recharged, though only Colderan knew how.",
        "History": "In [[1267 DR]], many years before Randal Morn reclaimed Daggerdale from the [[Zhentarim]], Colderan ruled the dale with an iron fist. Colderan battled and eventually slew [[Elshar Kurl]], the chief priest and [[Dorn the Grim]], the clan leader in [[Eagles' Eyrie]] while the rest of their clan escaped to [[Tethyamar]]. This deed caused the Brightblade dwarves to refuse to give any aid to the decendants of the [[Morn]] family, including Randal Morn.\n\nSome time later, Colderan's wife Belesaria lost her life to poison, which he blamed on the dwarves til his dying days. However the truth of the matter is that it was his [[drow]] allies who poisoned her, unbeknownst to him.",
