        "mainbody": "Zupar was an assassin and an agent of the Night Parade who was a part of the groups cell in Arabel, tasked with exiting revenue on Lady Lord Myrmeen Lhal in the late-14 century DR.\nZupar appeared akin to a bloated brain that strode on four twig-like legs in his true heinous form. The top of the brain had a tentacle appendage that resembled a whip. Zupars favorite disguise was a halfling, to which the aberrant monster occasionally forgot to add the usual hin feet hair. In both forms, Zupar was a  tall creature.\nLike other members of the Night Parade, Zupar was a shapechanger. He lacked physical strength, but it was remedied by his skills in magic and cunning intelligence. Zupars gift was the ability to transmute up to 100 square feet of wood or stone into water.\nZupar was a part of the Night Parades clandestine cell established in the city of Arabel about a decade before the . When the Lady Lord of Arabel–Myrmeen Lhal, clashed and demolished the Night Parades operations in Calimshan, in the , the aberrant creatures vowed vengeance. Myrmeen made the organization vulnerable and alerted king Azoun Obarskyr IV and the Harpers of the evils orchestrated by the Night Parade. Zupar, and several other members of the cabal, led by Lord Tempos, placed an artifact that could open gates to the Demiplane of Nightmares atop Nyaril family trade warehouse and magically summoned thunderstorms for two weeks to power the device up. Once it was activated, the army of the Night Parader was to flood and take over the city, slaying Myrmeen, her daughter Krystin Lhal, and a survivor of the Calimshan fiasco – warrior named Ord.\nThe Night Parade started murdering Arabels wizards to ensure the plan was not interrupted. Zupar ofter accompanied his fellow monstrosity Brokus, riding on its back into the assassinations. Together, the two successfully assassinated Epicot as Zupar transformed a wall in the wizards home into water, and Brokus swiftly murdered the man. The second assignation of Zupars was Myschanta Halarra. The sorceress was slain but her body was transported to Silverymoon via the contingency spell to be resurrected later. Myschanta was not easy prey. She was killed but not before landing a scorching ray of magical flames on Zupar with a wand of fire. With the wizard dead, the wand was claimed by Zupar.\nThe plot on Myrmeens life was thwarted by a band of adventurers who entered Arabel on 21 of Flamerule, 1360 DR. The group was tasked with the investigation into mysterious deaths, and eventually led to the Night Parades warehouse, just as the group was getting ready to open a fully-charged gate into their home plane. Myrmeen Lhal, a small squad of her guard, and the heroes stormed the warehouse, slaying the creatures of the Night Parade. Zupars final fate remained unclear."
