Ilgrim Marduth was the lord marshall of the Marsember Watch during the late 15 century DR.
During his time with the Watch, Ilgrim was seemingly at odds with the stalwart Taggar Kenric, who believed it his duty to stop the dishonesty that ran do rampant in the organization.
Ilgrim ascended to the rank of Lord Marshall a mere tenday after Kenrics death.
