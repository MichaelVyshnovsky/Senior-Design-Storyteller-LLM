'''Azuth''' was the beloved pet [[goat]] of an eccentric nobleman named [[Pelp Cadari]] who lived some years before [[1281 DR]].

==History==
Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Azuth the goat belonged to Pelp Cadari, known for his eccentricities and wild mood swings. After the nobleman's death, he left Azuth his favorite dining "utensil" – a custom-ordered [[enchanted]] [[halberd]] called the ''[[Long Cleaver]]''. The weapon was commissioned for a small sum of 40,000 [[gold]] [[coin|pieces]] and was exclusively used by Pelp Cadari to cut poultry at dinner. Because Azuth was a goat, the halberd reminded unused until Azuth's untimely demise.
