'''Darreth''' was a prisoner at the [[Temple of Elemental Evil]] under [[Tyar-Besil]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==History==
Darreth lived in [[Womford]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]]. In [[1491 DR]], he was captured by elemental cultists who took him to the altar of the Temple of Elemental Evil in order to use him as a sacrifice. However, some adventurers infiltrated the temple and freed him.
