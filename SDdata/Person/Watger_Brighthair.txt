Watger Brighthair was a chief priest of Oghma at the House of Knowledge in Neverwinter in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Watger was guided in the ways of priesthood by Salyndra Shaern and worked alongside the priestess to foster peace between the humans and elves of Neverwinter. He also taught her much about the wisdom of humans.
Watger was known to offer free teaching sessions in the House of Knowledge to anyone who was willing to learn about the Oghma faith.
