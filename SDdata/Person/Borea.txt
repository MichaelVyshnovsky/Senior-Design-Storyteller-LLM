'''Borea''' was a powerful [[sorceress]] from deep [[North Faerûn]] whose fearsome powers of freezing cold coursed through her veins.

==History==
Sometime before [[1369 DR]], Borea ventured into the city of [[Myth Drannor]] to never be seen again. Even though mysteriously disappeared, Borea's reputation remained a known story. [[Faeril]] and [[Beriand]], worshipers of [[Mystra]], the goddess of magic, knew of the sorceress and claimed that a single drop of her blood could turn a dozen able-bodied men into frozen statues.

A unique powerful [[enchanted]] [[dagger]], effectively a shard of magical ice, was known as ''[[Borea's Blood]]'' and was highly sought after by merchants who knew of Borea's story. The dagger's powers could spread deep freeing walls of ice if left unchecked. Eventually, the dagger was the weapon that ended the evil reign of [[Kya Mordrayn]] of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in 1369 DR.
