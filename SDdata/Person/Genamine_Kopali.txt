Genamine Kopali was the Guild Kingpin of the Seatower district in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR.
Genamine Kopali was an assassin by trade and she ran a similar group of neer-do-wells in the Seatower district. Her gang included a number of druids, who ensured the Guilds facilities were running and controlled a number of defensive beasts, such as shambling mounds, used to purify the Gates water.
Mortlock Vanthampur personally sent Genamine coin in exchange for information of happenings in the sewers of Baldurs Gate.
When the Guild faced a dangerous upstart crime lord, the Stone Lord, who was secretly allied with the Cult of the Absolute, the new kingpin gradually attacked and took over the Guilds territory. By the time the Absolute crisis of the  was raging in the Gate, Genamine Kopali and her Sewerkeepers were all slain and their headquarters was put to the torch. Genamines body was not recovered according to the Guilds reports. Presumably, the Sewerkeepers were killed by the Stone Lords men, however, it was also likely they were slaughtered by Orin the Red and her Bhaalists who used the sewers as their hunting ground.
