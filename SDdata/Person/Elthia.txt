'''Elthia''' was a princess of the city of [[Chessagol]] (later called [[Tsurlagol]]) in [[the Vast]], and later princess and queen of the kingdom of [[Impiltur]] in the 7th century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|88â€“89}}

==History==
Around the early 7th century [[DR]], Chessagol had recently come under the rule of King [[Lamoth]] and his newly royal family, though they were not considered legitimate. Lamoth sought to bolster the legitimacy of his line by marrying his children, Elthia among them, to royal families around the [[Inner Sea]], often by sending them to visit their royal courts.

Finally, Lamoth successfully arranged a marriage between Elthia and Prince [[Bellodar III]] of Impiltur. Elthia went to [[Lyrabar]] in Impiltur, accompanied by her dowry, which included the sword ''[[Galathos]]''.

Bellodar became king of Impiltur, and Elthia queen, in the [[642 DR|Year of Sifting Sands, 642 DR]]. ''Galathos'' eventually became the traditional sword of the princes of Impiltur.

==Relations==
Princess Elthia was the daughter of King Lamoth, who had five other daughters and eight sons. She married Bellodar III of Impiltur.
