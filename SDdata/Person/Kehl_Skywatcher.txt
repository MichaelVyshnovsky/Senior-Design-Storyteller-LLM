'''Kehl Skywatcher''' was an [[Iliyanbruen]] [[elf]] who lived in [[New Sharandar]] in the [[Feywild]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Template:Cite game/Neverwinter: Fury of the Feywild}}
{{Quote|As we fight back against Malabog's armies, we must also resist his desecration of our land.|Kehl, on the efforts of her people in the Feywild.}}

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[fomorian]] ruler [[Malabog|King Malabog]] began a campaign of conquest against the elves of New Sharandar that devastated large swaths of land in the Feywild. In response, Kehl led several missions to counteract the malignant effects caused by the fomorian witches in Malabog's army.

With the help of New Sharandar's [[druid]]s, she developed an [[dispersal agent|alchemical concoction]] that dissipated the toxic clouds that rose over the waters of the [[Horrid Mire]] and helped rescue the elven scouts that were trapped within. She also led the efforts to eradicate the [[witchcap toadstool]]s that the same coven of witches planted throughout the [[dark fey enclave]].
