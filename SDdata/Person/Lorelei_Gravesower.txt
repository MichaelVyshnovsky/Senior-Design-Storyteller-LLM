Lorelei Gravesower was a female half-elf cleric of Kelemvor who tended the Kelemvors Garden cemetery in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr in the late 1360s DR.
Lorelei became caretaker of the graveyard in the late 1360s DR, and renamed it from the "Thunderstone Cemetery".This was likely in 1368 DR after Kelemvors ascension as god of death.
Living out of a small house on the grounds of the cemetery, Loreleis task was to provide counselling and advice to the grieving and conduct maintenance on the cemetery.
A scurrilous rumor told that a woman dwelling in a hut beside the cemetery (perhaps Lorelei herself) would sell her favors to a man for a night, but this was a lie.
