Yusuf bin Ayyub was the leader of the Loyalists within the fortress of Sarahin in 1367 DR.
Paranoid that everyone was jealous of his position within Sarahin, Yusuf was accompanied by three werelion bodyguards at all times. His lack of confidence prompted him to be curt with others.
Yusuf made careful plans and preparations to assume power when the Shadow Caliph died.
It was rumored that Yusuf had become intimate with Jamila al-Zahab, one of his werelion bodyguards.
Yusuf owned a magical scimitar, a ring of protection, and a ring of invisibility.
