'''Roalgan''' was the leader of the [[Shields of the Highland]] adventuring company in [[1370 DR]].

==Description==
Roalgan was a very large man with long red hair and a heavy beard. He wore [[chainmail]].

==Personality==
Roalgan kept an emotionless expression in the midst of grief.

==History==
Roalgan hailed from one of the villages near the [[Forest of Mir]] like all his companions.

On [[Uktar 8]], 1370 DR, the Shields of the Highland lost two of their members while guarding a caravan. Unexpected cold weather led to snow, and a band of fourteen [[gnoll]]s were able to track them and attack them, killing two of them during the ensuing battle.

At dusk two days later, Roalgan and the other three survivors went to the [[Blue Badger Inn]] in the village of [[Toralth]] to grieve their loss.

Later that night, three [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Bapar Ghalmrin]], [[Odak Truesteel]], and [[Soram Battlebellow]], entered the tavern seeking the ''[[Sondarr Scepter]]'' and interrupting the ballad that Fylson was singing for Dumax. This greatly angered the Shields of the Highland. When [[Bramas Thorntree]], another patron, accused some of the other patrons of stealing the ''scepter'', Roalgan's companions got up from their chairs and began throwing their beer [[mug]]s and swinging their chairs. One mug struck the dwarf leader Bapar, and a tavern brawl was started when Soram stepped up to defend his prince. Bramas and his companions, the [[Company of the Anvil]] used this as an opportunity to escape with the ''scepter''.
