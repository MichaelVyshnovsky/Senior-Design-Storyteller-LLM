Phylanna was a Gondar priestess that served the Wonderbringer at his temple in Tilverton during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Phylanna was a beautiful woman with intense, passionate eyes and flaming red hair. While carrying out her priestly duties she wore a distinctive silk gown that featured steel shoulder pauldrons.
She served at the Tilverton temple alongside her fellow priest Rull.
During the Time of Troubles in the , Phylanna spent a passionate night with the mercenary Kelemvor Lyonsbane. The morning after, she was dazed by the jackalwere Torrence, who attempted to lure out Kelemvors lycanthropic panther form. Phylanna was aghast at Kelemvors eventual transformation, telling her once-lover he was accursed and should leave Tilverton for good.
Before Kelemvor left the city, Phylanna told a group of the Gondar faithful that he was a "monster" that had to be killed to earn back the divine presence of Gond.
