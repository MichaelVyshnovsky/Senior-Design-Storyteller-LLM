        "mainbody": "'''Tomalass Blountrae''' was a rich merchant who had a seat on the [[Council of Lords (Ravens Bluff)|Council of Lords]] in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He earned his wealth in shipping, by buying space on cargo ships, arranging for cargo exchanges, and conveying the more high-demand goods to areas that were experiencing shortages.",
        "Description": "Known for his even-keeled personality and calculating demeanor, Tomalass Blountrae was skilled at assessing potential profits and losses from any given business opportunity or financial situation.",
        "History": "After decades in the shipping business, Blountrae used his vast fortune to dominate the sail and canvas-work trades throughout the [[Dragon Reach]]. Around the year [[1370 DR]], he began to purchase a large amount of land around the roads that led into nearby [[Tantras]]. Many in the Bluff, including some of his fellow merchants, believed he had sights on the city itself, though they didn't know to what end."
