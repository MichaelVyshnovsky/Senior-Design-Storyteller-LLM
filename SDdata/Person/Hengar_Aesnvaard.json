        "History": "Hengar was born into the [[Tribe of the Elk]]. He always idolized [[Wulfgar]] of the [[Companions of the Hall]].\n\nWhen the [[Chosen]] of [[Auril]], [[Hedrun Arnsfirth]], began menacing the Elk Tribe, Hengar thought he needed to do something. He secretly departed for [[Ten Towns]] to ask for help. After arriving in [[Bryn Shander]], Hengar hoped to meet with the authorities but at the same time the Auril cultists identified him as a good sacrifice. The Auril cultist [[Brinna Alcott]] accused him of robbery and Hengar was arrested and sentenced to death by exposure to the cold."
