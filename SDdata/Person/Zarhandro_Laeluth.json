        "mainbody": "'''Zarhandro Laeluth''' was one of the eight members of the [[First Zulkirate]] and the [[Zulkir]] of [[Enchantment]] in 11{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Zarhandro was a jolly rotund hedonist Thayan [[human]] man who made deception his game. He was trusted by few and feared my most all. The zulkir's lies were aimed at everyone, including the fellow members of the First Zulkirate. He delighted in successful lies, schemes, revenges and cackled with malicious glee when his planes came to fruition. Zarhandro had fondness for long feasts of exotic foods.",
        "History": "Zarhandro Laeluth became the first member of the [[Council of Zulkirs]] from the [[school of magic|school of enchantment magic]] in the autumn of the {{YearlinkName|1030}}. The council was assembled under the [[diviner]] [[lich]] [[Ythazz Buvaar]]. The title allowed Zarhandro to select the [[tharchion]]s and gave him absolute control over a sliver of [[Thay]]. The zulkir routinely used doubles to convince everyone he was in several places at the same time. He ruled his tharchions with fear as he slew a number of them throughout the career.\n\nThe wizard's reign as the Zullkir of Enchantment came to an end some time before the late {{YearlinkName|1300}}."
