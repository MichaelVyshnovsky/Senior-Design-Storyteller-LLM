Zinnirit Yauntyrr was the former house wizard of House Yauntyrr of Eryndlyn.
Zinnirit was aged. He normally wore spiky armor. He had red-orange eyes and his breath smelled of cinnamon and pipeweed. He was a powerful spellcaster and teleporter.
Zinnirit was the house wizard of House Yauntyrr in Eryndlyn until its fall circa 1362 DR. While house wizard, he gave lessons, magical and otherwise, to Danifae Yauntyrr, a noble daughter of the house.
After his houses destruction, he fled to Sschindylryn, where he obtained a gatehouse with three portals, which he protected with zombies.
In 1373 DR, Zinnirit was approached by Danifae, who had been taken as a battle captive by Halisstra Melarn of Ched Nasad. Danifae had had a binding placed on her, which she had Zinnirit remove. She then killed him and took his ring of teleportation, which had originally belonged to her mother.
