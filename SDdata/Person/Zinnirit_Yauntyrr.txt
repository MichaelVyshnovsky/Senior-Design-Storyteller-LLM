'''Zinnirit Yauntyrr''' was the former house wizard of [[House Yauntyrr]] of [[Eryndlyn]].

==Description==
Zinnirit was aged. He normally wore spiky armor. He had red-orange eyes and his breath smelled of [[cinnamon]] and pipeweed. He was a powerful spellcaster and [[teleport]]er.

==History==
Zinnirit was the house wizard of House Yauntyrr in Eryndlyn until its fall ''circa'' [[1362 DR]]. While house wizard, he gave lessons, magical and otherwise, to [[Danifae Yauntyrr]], a noble daughter of the house.

After his house's destruction, he fled to [[Sschindylryn]], where he obtained a gatehouse with three [[portal]]s, which he protected with [[zombie]]s.

In [[1373 DR]], Zinnirit was approached by Danifae, who had been taken as a battle captive by [[Halisstra Melarn]] of [[Ched Nasad]]. Danifae had had a ''[[binding]]'' placed on her, which she had Zinnirit remove. She then killed him and took his ''ring of [[teleport|teleportation]]'', which had originally belonged to her mother.
