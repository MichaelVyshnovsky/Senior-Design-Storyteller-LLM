Torst Habilar was one of the Merchant Princes of Alagh√¥n in Turmish who lived in the 1100s DR.
Torst Habilar built his merchant empire and rose to prominence in the early 12 century DR, during the time when Merchant Princes fought to claim rulership of the nation of Turmish. Habilar built his grand mansion in the town of Centaur Bridge. By the late-14 century DR, Torsts home was gone, swept away by some unknown event or consumed by some forgotten fire, becoming known as the vanished mansion of Centaur Bridge. Many legends claimed that treasures of Torst Habilars mercantile empire could be found in the vanished mansions cellars exotic coins, trade bars, gems, and antique statuary from the wars of Unther and Mulhorand.
