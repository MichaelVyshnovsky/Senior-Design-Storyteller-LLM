        "mainbody": "Juniper was an owlbear that lived in the Feywild realm of Thither in the domain of Prismeer.\nJuniper was highly motivated by food. She much more preferred meat to berries.\nThe boss of Junipers chariot harness was embossed with an engraving of a juniper branch.\nthumb|right|350px|Juniper, sitting very still, with her flaxen-haired elf companion.\nThe mighty owlbear traveled across Thither with her companion, an elven man. Juniper pulled a finely-crafted chariot atop which her companion rode.\nAt some point, Juniper was tricked by a human woman and a harengon to transport them aboard her chariot. Juniper chased after a morsel of food they used to entice her and ran full speed across the plains of Thither. Unfortunately, their joyride came to an abrupt end when Juniper crashed into the sprite community of Honeyhollow Fortress. Juniper was left a bit dazed, while the joyriders were taken captive by the resident sprites.\nSome time later, Junipers elf companion went missing. He was believed to have been abducted by the jabberwock that laired deep within the Palace of Hearts Desire."
