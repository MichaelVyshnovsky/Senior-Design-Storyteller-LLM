        "History": "At some point, Juniper was tricked by a [[Billi Sharpe|human woman]] and a [[Clipper|harengon]] to transport them aboard her chariot. Juniper chased after a morsel of food they used to entice her and ran full speed across the plains of Thither. Unfortunately, their joyride came to an abrupt end when Juniper crashed into the [[sprite]] community of [[Honeyhollow Fortress]]. Juniper was left a bit dazed, while the joyriders were taken captive by the resident sprites.\n\nSome time later, Juniper's elf companion went missing. He was believed to have been abducted by the [[jabberwock]] that laired deep within the [[Palace of Heart's Desire]]."
