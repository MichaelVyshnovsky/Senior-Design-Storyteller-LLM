'''Markul''' was a regular patron of the [[Beached Leviathan]], one of the most popular taverns of [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/193/Tavern Profile:The Beached Leviathan|59}}

==Activities==
Markul was known as the "lookout" of the Beached Leviathan because he bid his time watchful of all that happened in the tavern. As he was aware of many goings-on of the Beached Leviathan, some patrons preferred to bribe him to buy his silence. Nobody dared to call him "the lookout" at his face, and usually only the staff members used that nickname to refer to him, always in low tones.

People was unaware that Markul was actually one of the richer persons in Neverwinter, and the patron of many of the seedier business that took place in the tavern.
