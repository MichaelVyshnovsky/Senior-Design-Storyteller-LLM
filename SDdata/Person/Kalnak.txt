Kalnak was the leader of the Jaguar Knights of Nexal.
In 1361 DR, Kalnak was chosen by Naltecona to lead an ambush against the Golden Legion at Palul.
Following the plan, Kalnak welcomed the Golden Legion to Palul and offering a great party, while secretly his elite army waited hidden. However, the mage Darien discovered the plan thanks to her magic and informed Cordell, who was at Kalnaks side.
