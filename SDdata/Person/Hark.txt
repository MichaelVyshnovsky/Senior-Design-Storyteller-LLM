Hark was the leader of a group of goblins sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Hark and his fellow goblins lived in the Ardeep Forest. In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR the elves managed to expel them from the forest.
Hark relocated the goblins to a cave near the Nightstone village. Thanks to the cloud giants bombardment, Hark managed to capture the fleeing villagers.
Hark was a reasonable person. He always preferred to bargain than fight.
