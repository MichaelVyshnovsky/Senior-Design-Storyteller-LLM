        "mainbody": "Wesclodat the Aged was a human Deneiran priest of unknown origins.\nIn his old age, Wesclodat retained only thin whisps of long, white hair, and a similar beard. His robe was dyed deep blue.\nWesclodat kept a regular schedule, even as he grew old.\nAmong his possessions was a robe of blending.\nNone of Wesclodats peers knew his origins, but some elders claimed he had once followed a different god, swapping to Deneir as the result of a trade between the two deities."
