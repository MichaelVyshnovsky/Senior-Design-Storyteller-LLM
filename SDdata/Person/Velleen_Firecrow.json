        "Description": "Velleen Firecrow was a red-haired [[Elf|elven]] woman. She wore a brooch with a [[Talos]] symbol on it.",
        "Activities": "Velleen Firecrow worked with a crew of [[kobold]]s, running deliveries for the [[Lionshield Coster]]'s [[Lionshield Coster (Phandalin)|Phandalin outpost]] and managing trade in the region surrounding the town.

        "Relationships": "Velleen Firecrow kept her apocalyptic religious beliefs and her membership in the Cult of Talos a secret from her employer, Linene Graywind. Her cadre of kobolds appeared to admire her and were very loyal to her.",
        "History": "''Circa '' [[1491 DR]], following the attacks by the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] in the surrounding region, Linene Greywind hired Velleen Firecrow as her new assistant and courier for the Lionshield Coster trading post in Phandalin. Velleen and her crew of kobolds were secretly spies for the evil Cult of Talos.\n\nWhen the [[Shrine of Luck]] in town was left unattended for some time, Velleen used the opportunity to ransack it. She also befriended [[Thistle (clerk)|Thistle]], a clerc working at [[Barthen's Provisions]], and unsuccessfully attempted to convert him to the Cult of Talos.\n\nAt some point, a group of [[adventurers]] from [[Leilon]], who had previously thwarted the plans of the Talos followers, arrived in Phandalin to pick up supplies for Leilon. Before they could leave town, Velleen and her kobolds confronted them. At the same time, [[Argus Skeel]], a spy for the rivaling [[Cult of Myrkul]], confronted the adventurers with his [[ghoul]]s, resulting in a three-sided battle."
