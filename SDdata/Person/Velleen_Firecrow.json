        "mainbody": "Velleen Firecrow worked as an assistant and courier for Linene Graywind in Phandalin in the late 15 century DR. She was secretly a spy for the Cult of Talos.\nVelleen Firecrow was a red-haired elven woman. She wore a brooch with a Talos symbol on it.\nVelleen Firecrow worked with a crew of kobolds, running deliveries for the Lionshield Costers Phandalin outpost and managing trade in the region surrounding the town. At the same time, she spied on what was happening in Phandalin for the Talos cultists.\nVelleen Firecrow kept her apocalyptic religious beliefs and her membership in the Cult of Talos a secret from her employer, Linene Graywind. Her cadre of kobolds appeared to admire her and were very loyal to her.\nCirca  1491 DR, following the attacks by the white dragon Cryovain in the surrounding region, Linene Greywind hired Velleen Firecrow as her new assistant and courier for the Lionshield Coster trading post in Phandalin. Velleen and her crew of kobolds were secretly spies for the evil Cult of Talos.\nWhen the Shrine of Luck in town was left unattended for some time, Velleen used the opportunity to ransack it. She also befriended Thistle, a clerc working at Barthens Provisions, and unsuccessfully attempted to convert him to the Cult of Talos.\nAt some point, a group of adventurers from Leilon, who had previously thwarted the plans of the Talos followers, arrived in Phandalin to pick up supplies for Leilon. Before they could leave town, Velleen and her kobolds confronted them. At the same time, Argus Skeel, a spy for the rivaling Cult of Myrkul, confronted the adventurers with his ghouls, resulting in a three-sided battle."
