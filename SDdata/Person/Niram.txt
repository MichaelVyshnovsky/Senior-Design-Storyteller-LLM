Niram was a Zealot of the Absolute, stationed in the Moonrise Towers during the late 15 century DR.
Niram wore the uniform armor of a Zealot of the Absolute – a fur-cloaked night-blue armored garb and a metal helmet. He had a lighter skin tone, and his face was heavily decorated with tattoos. He had a friendly demeanor towards his fellow cultists, with whom he shared drinks.
In the , Niram was among those who joined the new religion that sprang in the Western Heartlands. Niram abandoned his Lolthite faith in favor of the Absolute. He was stationed within the Moonrise Towers – the fortress controlled by the Absolutes warlord – General Ketheric Thorm. Zealot Niram stood guard of the Towers throne room. Like many other members of the cult, Zealot Nirams fate remained unknown as he couldve perished in battle when the High Harper Jaheira and her True Soul allies stormed the Moonrise.
