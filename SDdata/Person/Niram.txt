'''Niram''' was a Zealot of [[the Absolute]], stationed in the [[Moonrise Towers]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Niram wore the uniform [[armor]] of a Zealot of the Absolute – a fur-cloaked night-blue armored garb and a metal [[helmet]]. He had a lighter skin tone, and his face was heavily decorated with [[tattoo]]s. He had a friendly demeanor towards his fellow cultists, with whom he shared drinks.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Niram was among those who joined the new religion that sprang in the [[Western Heartlands]]. Niram abandoned his [[Lolthite]] faith in favor of the Absolute. He was stationed within the Moonrise Towers – the fortress controlled by the Absolute's warlord – General [[Ketheric Thorm]]. Zealot Niram stood guard of the Towers' throne room. Like many other members of the cult, Zealot Niram's fate remained unknown as he could've perished in battle when the [[High Harper]] [[Jaheira]] and her [[True Soul]] allies stormed the Moonrise.
