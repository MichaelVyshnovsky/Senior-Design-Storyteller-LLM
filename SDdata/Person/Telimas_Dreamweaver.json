        "mainbody": "Telimas Dreamweaver was the elderly founder, and patriarch, of the gnomish town of Stormpemhauder in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR.\nTelimas dressed in multicolored robes and carried with him an ornate pipe, a +1 staff, and a +2 ring of protection.\nMany years before the Year of the Gauntlet, Telimas had a vision of an army of spiders marching across Faer√ªn, being led by a dark-skinned female elf who wore a glittering silver crown. He took this intuitive dream and led the gnomes living throughout the trees to form a trading post within the forest. They began to trade with the Dalesmen and specialized in the sale of spider-related goods."
