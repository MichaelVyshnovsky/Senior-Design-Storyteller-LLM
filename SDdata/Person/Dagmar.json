An omen said that Ygraine would bring back the ancient magic of the Shapechange and thus it was decided she must marry Wedigar, the only man gifted with that power.\nAs they grew up together, Dagmar had become envious of her sister and so decided to eliminate her. In 1360 DR, she allied with the Kraken Society and they kidnapped Ygraine, who was kept prisoner in Ascarle.\nAfter the disappearance of Ygraine, it was decided that Dagmar instead would marry Wedigar, becoming his second wife. In 1361 DR, Dagmar went to Holgerstead to marry Wedigar but Ulf sent with her the drow wizard Liriel Baenre, who was at that time his apprentice.\nLieriel managed to unveil the betrayal of Dagmar, who had sold her people out to the Krakenar. \nCategoryHumans\nCategoryNorthlanders\nCategoryInhabitants of Ruathym\nCategoryInhabitants of the Trackless Sea\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nd1xiz80dbpkq9re6b4snmx2xrgo19tz"
