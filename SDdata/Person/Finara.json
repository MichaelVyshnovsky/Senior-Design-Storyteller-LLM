There, she joined Hadyn and Raidon Kane at some point in {{yearlink|1396}} in a trip into the Spellscarred Land, where she brought her burro.\n\nThey followed the [[Pilgrim's Path]] across the [[Granite Vortex]], deciding to cross the bridge that led through it. When Hadyn was slain by the spellscarred land, she decided not to finish the trip, and went back with her burro; only Raidon Kane persevered. By {{yearlink|1479}}, she had made it back to Ormpetarr, where she opened an inn, Finara's."
