Okasha was a Wanese captain temporary in Akari in 1357 DR.
Okasha was a sea captain merchant from Wa. He had dealings with Tu Lung agents. In 1357 DR, his ship was damaged in a storm near the Prioto islands and he temporary stopped at Akari for repairs. However, the Shou governor Ko Lei Kho sold him iron bolts and fasteners for repairs at a very high price.
Okasha despised Governor Ko, considering him a tyrannical little tin demigod who thought only of profit.
