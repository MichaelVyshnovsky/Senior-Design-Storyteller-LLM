        "mainbody": "'''Antasillix''' was a [[fiendish]] [[green dragon]] living in [[Unther]] in the 1370s [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Antasillix protected the [[Pit of Many Colors]] from all the enemies of [[Tiamat]], especially enemy sects.",
        "History": "Antasillix was living like a normal green dragon when he was summoned by Tiamat. The goddess ordered him to find a cleric that was near the Pit of Many Colors, an abandoned bathhouse in the ruined city of [[Unthalass]] in Unther, and, after the cleric left the city, to attack and killed the cleric. Antasillix worked well and during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]], Tiamat summoned him to her lair in the [[Nine Hells]]. After the end of the Rage, he came back infused with infernal energies. He followed some [[wyvern]]s but had only some bad encounters.",
        "Personality": "Antasillix was still young and knew little about [[dragonkin]]. Although his study of wyverns ended badly, he was still curious. He hated all non-Tiamatan clerics, especially those of [[Gilgeam]].",
        "Relationship": "Antasillix had some contacts with [[Kolchis]] of the [[Altar of the Scales]] and performed some mission for the cleric in exchange for treasures."
