|Bah! This will end poorly, if you ask me. I can see it now. Scores of adventurers marching into the Storm Horns, dying useless deaths because they don't know their way around the mountains.
|Eldovar}}
==Description==
Eldovar had light skin and long black hair. He wore rugged and practical clothing and carried a [[walking stick]] as he traversed the wilderness.

==Personality==
He had a rather poor opinion of [[adventurer]]s, and prided himself on his specialized wilderness knowledge and professionalism.

==History==
Around the mid-1480s [[DR]], Eldovar offered his services as a guide to people in the Storm Horns, but strongly preferred people who had proven themselves competent already. He was willing to take completely clueless people, but it required a significant payment for his time and effort.
