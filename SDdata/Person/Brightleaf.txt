Brightleaf was a treant in Cormanthor in the late 15 century DR.
Brightleaf regularly reported forest news to Serinia of Elventree.
He succumbed to the madness of the demon lord Grazzt until some adventurers (members of the Emerald Enclave hired by Elanil Elassidil to bring peace to the spirit of her ancestor Meira Faerenduil) confronted him.
In his madness, Brightleaf considered himself a god. He was wary of strangers but not hostile at first. He spoke metaphorically and painfully slowly in a rich bass tone, but almost never reached a point.
Brightleaf was an ally of the Emerald Enclave and had dealings with Serinia.
