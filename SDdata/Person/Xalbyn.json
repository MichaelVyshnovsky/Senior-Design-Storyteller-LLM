        "mainbody": "'''Xalbyn''' was a [[drow]] [[rogue]] and warrior who belonged to [[Bregan D'aerthe]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "He was quick-witted, and admired fellow warriors of similar cunning. Anyone who managed to get on his good side was offered the protection of his camp.",
        "Possessions": "Xalbyn used a ''[[hat of disguise]]'' to hide his drow heritage while on assignment in [[Neverwinter]].{{Cite dungeon/193/Shards of Selûne|19}}",
        "Activities": "Xalbyn was leader of a group of Bregan D'aerthe agents in Neverwinter who operated out of an encampment in the ruins of [[Castle Never]] beginning in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.{{Cite dungeon/193/Shards of Selûne|12}}",
        "Relationships": "In theory, Xalbyn reported directly to [[Jarlaxle]], however the fickle [[mercenary]] leader was seldom available, and so he more frequently reported to Jarlaxle's second-in-command, [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]]. Kimmuriel did not fully trust him, however, and so among the other Bregan D'aerthe operatives at Xalbyn's camp was [[Aerlyse]], who had been tasked with spying on him.",
        "History": "In 1479 DR, Jarlaxle tasked Xalbyn with operating an encampment located within a courtyard of the ruined and haunted Castle Never. This campsite had sometimes been used by Jarlaxle and [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] during the preceding decades, and they had occasionally attracted a few fans wishing to learn from them. However, interest in the camp had suddenly exploded, leading to a half-dozen youthful thrill seekers who convened at the formerly secret camp without the two famous drow. On their own, they trained with each other in hopes of one day apprenticing to the drow or exploring the depths of the castle. This came to Jarlaxle's attention after a few months, at which point he sent a group of his agents&mdash;led by Xalbyn&mdash;to monitor and help maintain the camp. Jarlaxle's goal was to figure out a way to turn the enthusiastic youths into assets, hopefully to extract information about Neverwinter from them, and at the very least to have them maintain the convenient campsite for him at no cost.\n\nWhen the ''[[shards of Selûne]]'' fell upon Neverwinter, Xalbyn observed one that fell near [[Blacklake]], causing a commotion. He also observed that this was soon followed by a contingent of undead sneaking out of the Castle Never crypts to head to the docks. He reported this to Jarlaxle, who surmised that Thay was seeking that same shard."
