Dame [[Jenilynn Leyland]], a [[Knight]] of the [[Right Hand of Tyr]], and Sir [[Sarren Nightstalker]], a [[Knight of the Griffon]], were united in a social gala that was reported on the pages of the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]''. Squire Selphiras Elvenstar was one of the bride's attendants during the ceremony. It was reported that the wedding was scheduled for an earlier date, but Jenilynn Leyland was delayed due to her mission to the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] and being transformed into a [[Unicorn]]."
