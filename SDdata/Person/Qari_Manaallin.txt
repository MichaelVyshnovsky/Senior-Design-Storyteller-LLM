'''Qari Manaalin''' was a woman of [[Deep Imaskar]] and the sister of the [[adventurer]], and later Empress of [[High Imaskar]], [[Ususi Manaallin]]. Thought at first to be twins, they were actually duplicates from competing timelines. Blind from birth, Qari possessed the gift of piercing any darkness, which she gave to her sister Ususi so that she could defeat [[Pandorym]] on [[Tarsakh 19]] of {{yearlink|1374}}.

==Abilities==
Until [[Tarsakh]] of 1374 DR, despite her blindness, Qari had the ability to pierce any darkness. Being mute, she shared a psychic link to only her sister, which allowed them to communicate; after the death of her parents, however, she only ever shared dreams through it.

==History==
When Pandorym was first summoned and sealed in {{yearlink|-2488}}, it foresaw the influence of Ususi Manaallin in the future, and extended its influence forward in time to make her afraid of the dark, thus making her less likely to successfully seal it. Its temporal meddling, however, accidentally created two competing timelines: in one of those, Ususi was born with the ability to pierce any darkness, and in another, she was born with dread of the darkness. These timelines came to coexist, and thus, both Ususis were born into the same timeline, as twin sisters.{{cite book/Darkvision|289-291|29}} This other Ususi, Qari, was born blind and mute, only capable of communicating psychically, which she did only with her sister Ususi.{{cite book/Darkvision|89-90}} However, after the death of their parents in an accident, Qari did not communicate with her sister again, only sharing dreams, and even then, only until Ususi left Deep Imaskar.

As children, Qari often had the same nightmare as her sister Ususi, in which an unending darkness attacked them. Whenever they woke from the dream, they always found that all light sources in their vicinity were quenched.{{cite book/Darkvision|8-9|2}}{{cite book/Darkvision|129-131|13}} As children, they realized at some point the darkness would come from them.{{cite book/Darkvision|287|29}} Such dreams disturbed both to the point of ruining their sleep, or even making them afraid to sleep, for a long time as adults.{{cite book/Darkvision|158|17}}

Before leaving Deep Imaskar, Ususi had secured special care and isolation for her sister, at a steep price; very few people, including Ususi herself and the Lord Apprehender (who was sworn to secrecy on the subject) knew where she was kept. The [[Imaskari vengeance taker]] [[Iahn Qoyllor]] attempted to interrogate Qari before setting off to hunt down her sister, Ususi; he was incapable of getting her to communicate.{{cite book/Darkvision|89-90}}

Her sister still felt concern for her; during its siege of Deep Imaskar, the elder evil Pandorym attempted to persuade Ususi into desisting from sealing it by threatening her;{{cite book/Darkvision|248|26}} Qari remained in Deep Imaskar during Pandorym's siege of the city in 1374 DR.{{cite book/Darkvision|284|29}} She psychically reached out to Ususi when the latter was in the [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]], after Pandorym's darkness finally caught her: she explained to her sister that they were the same person from different timelines, and gifted her with her own percipience, her ability to pierce any darkness.{{cite book/Darkvision|289-291|29}} After Pandorym was sealed, Ususi planned on visiting Qari again, and if possible, return her percipience to her.{{cite book/Darkvision|316-317|29}}
