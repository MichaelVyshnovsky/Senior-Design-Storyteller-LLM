From 1364 DR, Nameless was the familiar of Tsarra Chaadren, who became the second Blackstaff."after ten years of bonding". 
The Spellplague merged Nameless and Tsarras husband, the human Raergar, forming the Nameless Haunt. The location where they were merged was on the eastern side of Mount Waterdeep. Their merging created a permanent cats head mark on the cobblestones, which remained no matter how many times they were replaced.
