'''Bronwyn Daggerford''' was Duke [[Pwyll Greatshout]]'s sister and a court [[wizard]] in [[Daggerford]].

==History==
Bronwyn was the sister of [[Pwyll Greatshout]]. When she learned that Pwyll had been designated as the heir of Daggerford's duchy by their father [[Pryden Daggerford]], Bronwyn decided to learn the magical arts under the court magician [[Gwydion pen Dafwyd]]. Around [[1362 DR]], Bronwyn went to adventure for almost two years with the adventuring party the [[Iron Edge]].

When she came back, she was considerably more experienced as a wizard and more wealthy.

In [[1370 DR]], Bronwyn managed the magical duties of the court and trained militiamen in magic.

In [[1372 DR]] both Bronwyn and her brother were missing or presumed dead, while a wealthy merchant and a member of the city council [[Matagar Bugo]] proclaimed himself the new Duke. [[Astriel Shalyn]], an agent of theÂ [[Lords of Waterdeep]], discovered [[Zhentarim]]'s plot to instate a puppet ruler, and take over Daggerford, and for that to succeed the duke and his sister needed to disappear. Matagar Bugo claimed Bronwyn was taken hostage by [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]. In reality, the siblings were kept alive in the mines of [[Illefarn]], guarded by Zhent-controlled [[Griffons Mercenary Company]]. Astriel's activities led to the Duke and Bronwyn's rescue. The city stood against the united forces of Zhentarim and [[Gorgomorz]], the Devil of Daggerford, who had a personal vendetta with the Daggerford's ducal family. The city stood victorious and Pwyll Greatshout and Bronwyn Daggerford were back on the throne.
