        "mainbody": "Sesssth was the leader of a tribe of lizardfolk in the Marsh of Chelimber.\nThe king lived in a great stone fort, and ruled over other lizardmen. He fought with a spiked club and a buckler.\nIn 1374 DR, the three adventurers Kromlech Bruenghor, Vahn, and Adrianna arrived in the Marsh of Chelimber. A shaman, Sleyvas, told them that a great Onyx Tower had appeared in the marsh, and that its owner was causing the local lizardfolk to rally. He said that, in order to scatter the tribes, they had to break its spine. This referred to Sesssth, who led the lizardmen. The three heroes agreed to take him down.\nWhen the trio entered the fort, Sesssth accused them of trespassing and, after a threat, the two sides engaged in combat. The king was slain."
