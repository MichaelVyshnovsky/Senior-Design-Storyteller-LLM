'''Nuli Barbarak''' was the [[half-dwarven]] wife of [[Ivus Barbarak]], with whom she ran the [[Holdfast Inn]] of [[Liam's Hold]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Nuli Barbarak appeared to be as short as a [[dwarf]]; this height she owed to her mother, who was a [[human]] of shorter stature. She had a tough stout body and long dark hair. Nuli was efficient and strict.

==History==
At a young age, Nuli Barbarak's father left his child and her mother to fend for themselves in life. The dwarf preferred the life of searching for [[gemstone]]s to family life. She had a tough life with a single parent, and in adulthood, she often thought of her father, but the thought always put Nuli in a foul mood. After Nuli married Ivus Barbarak, the couple spent their time running the popular inn in Liam's Hold. Nuli worked in the kitchen and dealt with orders and inventory, while Ivus greeted the guests and served them libations and meals.

In [[1372 DR]], Nuli Barbarak prepared a [[barrel]] of the inn's best [[ale]] to be delivered to [[Rab Bitnez]]'s home for a party. The [[Hero of Daggerford]] volunteered to make a delivery, knowing how busy the innkeepers were.
