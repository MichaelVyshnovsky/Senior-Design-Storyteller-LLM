'''Runara''' was an [[dragon aging|adult]] [[bronze dragon]] who led the monastery of [[Dragon's Rest]] on [[Stormwreck Isle]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Runara often took a female [[human]] form while interacting with those outside the monastery. In this form, she had dark, weathered skin, white hair, and kind hazel eyes.

==Personality==
Runara was dedicated fully to the cause of peace, refusing to fight battles, even on the behalf of others. Above all, she sought to bring about peace between [[chromatic dragon|chromatic]] and [[metallic dragon]]s, though she settled on guiding souls whose lives had been shaped by violence. She was quite secretive about her true nature, only revealing it to the few people who lived in the monastery.

She was dedicated to the god [[Bahamut]] and tended to his temple within Dragon's Rest.
