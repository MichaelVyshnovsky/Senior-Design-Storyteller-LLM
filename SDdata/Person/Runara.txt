Runara was an adult bronze dragon who led the monastery of Dragons Rest on Stormwreck Isle in the late 15 century DR.
Runara often took a female human form while interacting with those outside the monastery. In this form, she had dark, weathered skin, white hair, and kind hazel eyes.
Runara was dedicated fully to the cause of peace, refusing to fight battles, even on the behalf of others. Above all, she sought to bring about peace between chromatic and metallic dragons, though she settled on guiding souls whose lives had been shaped by violence. She was quite secretive about her true nature, only revealing it to the few people who lived in the monastery.
She was dedicated to the god Bahamut and tended to his temple within Dragons Rest.
