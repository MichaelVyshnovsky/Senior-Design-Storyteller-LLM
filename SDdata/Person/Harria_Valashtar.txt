Harria Valashtar was one of the co-leaders of the Undertakers in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Harria and her fiance Uktarl Krannoc led a group of failed actors that settled in the Dungeon Level of Undermountain where they posed as vampires and preyed upon gullible adventurers.
In 1492 DR, the relationship between Harria and Uktarl was broken and the two started plotting to kill the other and become the only leader of the gang. Harria acquired a flesh golem and was on the verge of winning the conflict.
Harria considered herself the best actress and singer in Toril despite the opinions of the others. She was greedy, treacherous, and vindictive.
Once Harria loved Uktarl, but no more. A flesh golem mistook her as its creator and followed her orders, however she couldnt control the golem when it went berserk.
