'''Harria Valashtar''' was one of the co-leaders of the [[Undertakers]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
Harria and her fiance [[Uktarl Krannoc]] led a group of failed actors that settled in the [[Dungeon Level]] of Undermountain where they posed as [[vampire]]s and preyed upon gullible adventurers.

In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} the relationship between Harria and Uktarl was broken and the two started plotting to kill the other and become the only leader of the gang. Harria acquired a [[flesh golem]] and was on the verge of winning the conflict.

==Personality==
Harria considered herself the best actress and singer in [[Toril]] despite the opinions of the others. She was greedy, treacherous, and vindictive.

==Relationship==
Once Harria loved Uktarl, but no more. A flesh golem mistook her as its creator and followed her orders, however she couldn't control the golem when it went berserk.
