'''Candoria''' was a gang leader in [[Nexal]].

==History==
Candoria was one of the renegades living in the [[human]] quarter of Nexal in [[1362 DR]]. He led gang of [[thieves]].

That year, he was paid to discourage people from investigating the recently captured [[Tabaxi]]. For this, he and his men may have attacked [[Golotl]] and an adventuring party hired by [[Drakosa]] to find the [[Cloak of One Plume]].
