        "mainbody": "Jafar el Uabar was the Nirdey of Volothamp for the Rundeen in 1370 DR.\nJafar grew up in Volothamp with his uncle Tulmon, a wealthy pearl diver. Recently, his uncle estranged him after a disagreement about the family business, so Jafar joined with the Rundeen in order to maintain his lifestyle. He acted as mediator between merchants and smugglers and often worked with Syan al Derak of the Knights of the Shield. Jafar greatly disliked the \"Gem Caleph\" Adnan el Huzal, ruler of the Pearl Divers Guild and would do anything to ruin him. He saw this as a method to reconcile with his uncle and started considering even the use of assassins in order to accomplished the goal."
