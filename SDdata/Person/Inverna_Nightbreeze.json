        "mainbody": "nverna Nightbreeze was a moon elf warrior who lived in the Sword Coast North during the late 15 century DR.\nShe had a distinct scar on her cheek, given to her by an orcish javelin.\nInverna had the firm belief that all people possessed an inherent dignity with which they should be treated. She also believed that orcs were not people, and that all of Toril should be rid of their presence.\nShe was wary of just about everyone she met, and seldom spoke at great length. Despite her quiet nature, Inverna had a sharp and sarcastic wit.\nNot one to admit being in the wrong, Inverna was quite stubborn at times."
