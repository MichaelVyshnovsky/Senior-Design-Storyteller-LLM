        "Description": "Ivrin was a tall, aging [[human]] male with a gaunt complexion. He often felt aches in his old bones and was seen leaning heavily on his trusted [[staff]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Wild Pastures west of [[Liam's Hold]] hamlet began experiencing uncanny disappearances of cattle, sometimes in the middle of the day. On one particularly rainy day, Ivrin the Shepherd witnessed one of his favorite [[cow]]s, [[Betty]], disappear. Before the bovine \"went poof,\" as the shepherd described it, Ivrin heard strange giggling. The cattle disappearances alarmed the inhabitants of Liam's Hold and reached the worried ears of [[Daggerford]]'s guard. The city asked the adventurer lair known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]] to investigate. Ivrin was one of the shepherds the adventurer interviews as a part of his investigation. The disappearances were revealed to be a band of [[goblin]]s armed with a magic brew who served the [[devil]] [[Gorgomorz]]. Betty, however, could not be rescued from her dire fate."
