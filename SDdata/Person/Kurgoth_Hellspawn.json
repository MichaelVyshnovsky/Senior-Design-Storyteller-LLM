Although the drow of Maerimydra suffered from [[Silence of Lolth|Lolth's Silence]], leading his army of [[ogre]]s, fire giants and [[demon]]s to victory is an impressive feat nonetheless.",
        "Description": "Whilst other fire giants have fire colored hair or beards, Kurgoth's was literally made of fire with smouldering eyes to match. Outfitted with coal-black full plate armour and enormous bat-like wings, Kurgoth strikes an imposing figure.",
        "Possessions": "Kurgoth carried an enormous [[flaming]] [[greatsword]].",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]] the [[Archmage]] of [[Maerimydra]], [[Duneth Wharreil]], devised a plan to overthrow the ruling [[clerics]] in the wake of [[Lolth]]'s withdrawal. On [[Elient 3]], Duneth contacted Kurgoth and 20 days later Kurgoth attacked the city with his army swiftly taking the beleaguered city. Unfortuantely for both parties a complication arose, one that was fatal for Kurgoths partner Duneth. A cult to the drow Goddess [[Kiaransalee]], led by [[Irae T'sarran]], slew the Lolthites of [[House Chumavh]] and took up residence in [[Castle Maerimydra]]. Kurgoth set up a base in the [[Coliseum (Maerimydra)|Coliseum]] and his forces then entered into a protracted siege of Castle Maerimydra unable to break its potent defences whilst Irae and her followers lacked the numbers to sally forth. Especially as a good portion of his forces still resided back in the [[Mines of Tethyamar]] and the outlying [[Deep Wastes]]."
