'''Teebs''' was a [[dwarf]] [[Harper]] who followed the Harper hero [[Jaheira]] to the [[Shadow-cursed lands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''Nice to see the dark's spitting out more than shadows. Welcome.''|Teebs}}

==Description==
Teebs was a bearded dwarvish man with olive skin and brown hair. He was adorned in a heavy [[splint mail]] and carried a [[spear]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Jaheira was alerted of the mysterious return of [[Ketheric Thorm]], now a leader of a cultist army that worshiped [[The Absolute]]. Harper Teebs was one of the agents who accompanied Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed lands surrounding the [[Moonrise Towers]] â€“ General Thorm's seat of power.

When a group of [[True Soul]]s arrived at the [[Last Light Inn]], which Harpers claimed as a temporary base, Teebs was among those present for the events that followed. It was unknown if Harper Teebs survived the war with the Absolute. The accords of the events varied. Some claimed he might've perished after the Last Light Inn was consumed by the darkness or survived with the rest, storming the Moonrise Towers to end General Thorm's reign.
