        "History": "Around [[1384 DR]], Matharic was a drow bandit who preyed on the [[Luruar]] region. During this raids, he acquired the [[Wand of Tir'Lien]], an [[artifact]].\n\nAfterward, he and his minions attacked the Northdark area around [[Citadel Adbar]] but the [[dwarves]] managed to destroy the entirety of Matharic's band. However, after his death, Matharic rose as a wraith and continued to haunt his lair.\n\nIn 1484 DR, just after the start of the [[War of the Silver Marches]], the [[dwarf]] mystic [[Axelcrantz]] sensed he needed the Wand so he hired a particular adventuring party to recover it. The adventurers managed to destroyed Matharic and recover the magic item."
