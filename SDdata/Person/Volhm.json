Several other arcanists, and even archwizards, paid a visit to her to acquire it. Having an interest in elven culture and expanding her repertoire of spells, she would only trade knowledge of how to cast lightning bolt in exchange for elven antiques or spells she had no knowledge of.\nVolhm was born in . Three years after she invented her final spell, her lightning bolt spell still proved very popular. For this reason, she was sought out by Jarm, a rival arcanist. The two engaged in a spell duel to the death in , Volhm was beaten, and Jarm claimed victory. In response, her chaotic students attacked the victor, but all of them were slain by the adroit Jarm."
