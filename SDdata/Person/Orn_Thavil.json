        "mainbody": "Orn Thavil was a human male priest of Tymora who dwelt in the city of Procampur in the Vast.\nBy 1357 DR, Orn Thavil served as High Priest of the Ladys Happy Hall temple of Tymora in the Temple District of Procampur.\nIn the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR,  dined at a banquet hosted by Duke Jozul Piniago of Procampur, and was sat beside the lama Koja of Khazari. He considered the Tuigan to be \"savages\" and discussed the problems of using printing presses to copy magical prayerbooks.The Hierarch here is unnamed, but the title implies that he is head of his church, who at the time was likely Orn Thavil. Koja only guesses that this Hierarch is from the temple of Tymora.\nThavil was still high priest of the temple as of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR.\nThe Hierarch was a very old man, thin and with a long, wispy white beard.\nThavil was High Priest of the Ladys Happy Hall temple of Tymora. In this capacity, he led 24 subordinate priests and 16 lay-followers."
