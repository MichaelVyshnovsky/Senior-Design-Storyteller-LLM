        "mainbody": "'''Orn Thavil''' was a [[human]] male [[priest]] of [[Tymora]] who dwelt in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]].",
        "History": "By [[1357 DR]], Orn Thavil served as High Priest of the [[Lady's Happy Hall]] temple of Tymora in the Temple District of Procampur.\n\nIn the [[1362 DR|Year of the Helm, 1362 DR]],  dined at a banquet hosted by Duke [[Jozul Piniago]] of Procampur, and was sat beside the [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]] [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]]. He considered the [[Tuigan]] to be \"savages\" and discussed the problems of using [[printing press]]es to copy magical prayerbooks.<ref group=\"note\">The Hierarch here is unnamed, but the title implies that he is head of his church, who at the time was likely Orn Thavil. Koja only guesses that this Hierarch is from the temple of Tymora.\n\nThavil was still high priest of the temple as of the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]].",
        "Description": "The Hierarch was a very old man, thin and with a long, wispy white beard.",
        "Activities": "Thavil was High Priest of the Lady's Happy Hall temple of Tymora. In this capacity, he led 24 subordinate priests and 16 lay-followers."
