        "History": "In [[1480 DR]], [[Manshoon]] decided he needed him in order to uncover the killer inside [[Castle Irlingstar]]. Therefore, thanks to a distraction provided by some [[eyeball]]s, Manshoon managed to dominate Everwood's mind and send him on the hunt.\n\nHowever, his first duty for Manshoon was to eliminate the War Wizard [[Malver Tulbard]], who was investigating [[Sraunter]]. He tried to kill Malver at [[Gocklin's]] dining place, but the intervention of Lord [[Tauntshaw]] saved Malver's life.\n\nLater, Manshoon decided to use Ondrath as his main body. However, Ondrath died when [[Elminster Aumar]], after regaining his true body, destroyed Manshoon for the final time."
