"Silhouette" was a mysterious artificer and partner of the famous musician Evani from Waterdeep, active circa 1372 DR.
"Silhouette" was Evanis close friend who partnered with her in creating the intimidating and eccentric mechanism - the Fantabuliser. Unlike "Silhouette", Evani loved performing and traveled with the musical device, giving performances to adoring crowds.
