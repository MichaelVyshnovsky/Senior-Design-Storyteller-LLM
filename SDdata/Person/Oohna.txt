{{quote|Don't tell me you're the one who rented out the whole upper floor! I hear the beds have been... well used.|"Ears" Oohna}}

==Description==
Oohna was a [[wood elven]] woman with brown skin, hazel eyes, and long, straight brown hair gathered in a ponytail. Her haughty demeanor and quality clothes suggested Oohna to be a woman of means.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, "Ears" Oohna was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. She could often be found dining whilst sharing a table with a [[gnome|gnomish]] friend named [[Wrilda Gemfinder]]. Oohna was surprised to find out a band of [[adventurer]]s rented out the entirety of Elfsong's upper floor after the infamous murder of Duke [[Belynne Stelmane]]. She half-jokingly suggested that the group might awaken the tavern's singing [[ghost]].
