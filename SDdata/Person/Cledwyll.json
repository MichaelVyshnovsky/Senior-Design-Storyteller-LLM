Cledwylls Selûne was almost  tall and  around. The sculpture was graceful and scantily clad the womans position was arched with arms raised up over her head in a circle, her lips slightly parted, with her eyes closed as if waiting for a surprise. The statue eventually came to be stored in Drone Wyvernspurs laboratory in the Redstone Castle in the mid–14 century DR, wrapped in red velvet and twine. Drone described Cledwylls Selûne as ample, while the familys stern matriarch Dorath Wyvernspur called the statue scandalous. After his supposed death, Drone sent Cledwylls Selûne, the patron goddess of the family, to his nephew Giogioni Wyvernspur as a hint at the familys history.\nShortly before the , another one of Cledwylls originals was purchased by Jannaxil Serpentil of Waterdeep. The purchase was detailed in his account book, which was stolen by Harpers Danilo Thann and Arilyn Moonblade."
