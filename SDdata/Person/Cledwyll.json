        "mainbody": "'''Cledwyll''' was a renowned [[Cormyte]] sculptor who lived sometime during the 10{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''The boy has money, all right. And taste, too. I do believe that's an original Cledwyll. Overly endowed and scantily clad. Yes, definitely a Cledwyll. How extraordinary.''|Olive Ruskettle}}",
        "History": "Cledwyll's original art was worth a fortune and had a very distinct style.\n\nOne of his pieces, a curvaceous sculpture of the goddess [[Selûne]] caved out of black stone, was personally gifted by Cledwyll to the founder of the noble [[House Wyvernspur]] of Cormyr, [[Paton Wyvernspur]], sometime before the Lord's death in the {{YearlinkName|976}}. Cledwyll's Selûne was almost {{SI|2'|'\"|long=yes}} tall and {{SI|0'8|'\"|long=yes}} around. The sculpture was graceful and scantily clad; the woman's position was arched with arms raised up over her head in a circle, her lips slightly parted, with her eyes closed as if waiting for a surprise. The statue eventually came to be stored in [[Drone Wyvernspur]]'s laboratory in the [[Redstone Castle]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], wrapped in red [[velvet]] and twine. Drone described Cledwyll's Selûne as ample, while the family's stern matriarch [[Dorath Wyvernspur]] called the statue scandalous. After his supposed death, Drone sent Cledwyll's Selûne, the patron goddess of the family, to his nephew [[Giogioni Wyvernspur]] as a hint at the family's history.\n\nShortly before the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, another one of Cledwyll's originals was purchased by [[Jannaxil Serpentil]] of [[Waterdeep]]. The purchase was detailed in his account book, which was stolen by Harpers [[Danilo Thann]] and [[Arilyn Moonblade]]."
