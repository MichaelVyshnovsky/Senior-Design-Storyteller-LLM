Maerklos, known as Stormherald"Stormherald" is a rank amongst the clergy of Talos, as mentioned on page 156 of Faiths & Avatars, so its possible that Maerklos actually held that rank, or that the rank was named for Maerkloss nickname. and The Rending Storm, was a legendary warrior-priest of Talos the Destroyer active early in the history of the Talassan church.
He was a man of ferocious nature.
Considered to be the first and the greatest of the Storm Lords warrior-priests, Maerklos was renowned for summoning storms, obliterating whole cities, and looting their wealth, all in devotion to his god.
But one of his greatest acts was creation—that of the Sword of Storms, an artifact of great destructive power. Maerklos worked with over a dozen wizards in its forging and enchanting. The sword was later lost, long before the mid–14 century DR, but thought to be somewhere in Alaghôn, Turmish.
