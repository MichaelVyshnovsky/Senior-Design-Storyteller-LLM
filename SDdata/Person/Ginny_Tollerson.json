        "mainbody": "'''Ginny Tollerson''' was a happy [[human]] citizen of [[Daggerford]] who loved the city so much she took on herself the role of an unofficial one-woman-tourist center for the visitors and new arrivals ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Ginny Tollerson was a happy-go-lucky woman who gladly chatted up new arrivals to [[Daggerford]] and eagerly dispensed directions and information about her city.\n\nShe did not like the fancy inn called [[Chateau Elite]] as it was too upper-crusty for her taste.",
        "History": "Ginny Tollerson was born in Daggerford and happily lived her whole life there.\n\nIn 1372 DR, Ginny greeted the newly arrived adventurers, soon to become the heroes of Daggerford. She directed them to the city's two temples, the marketplace, and recommended the [[Happy Cow]] inn over the shady and unruly [[Black Stone Inn]] that even the city guards stopped keeping tabs on the seedy establishment and its owner [[Gildamesh]]."
