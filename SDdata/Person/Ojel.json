        "mainbody": "jel was one of the frost giants that was held prisoner in the Darkmoon temple led by Dran Draggore.\nThe frost giant inhabited the crimson tower of Temple Darkmoon in 1358 DR. He appeared to have gone mad, having been partially turned into a tree.\nThe lunatic frost giant seemed to be one of the experiments of Dran Draggore, the evil high priest of Darkmoon. In a neighboring room, another of his kin was kept, who was also shrunk down to human-like size. He warned of Drans evils and cowardice, and then turned to stone. Ojel, who was trapped by an unknown force, was encountered by the Heroes of Waterdeep. The giant gave them coins, which acted as keys to further progress through the tower."
