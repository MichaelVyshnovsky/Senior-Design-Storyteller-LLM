        "Description": "The frost giant inhabited the crimson tower of Temple Darkmoon in [[1358 DR]]. He appeared to have gone mad, having been partially turned into a tree.",
        "History": "The lunatic frost giant seemed to be one of the experiments of Dran Draggore, the evil high priest of Darkmoon. In a neighboring room, another of his kin was kept, who was also shrunk down to [[human]]-like size. He warned of Dran's evils and cowardice, and then turned to stone. Ojel, who was trapped by an unknown force, was encountered by the [[Heroes of Waterdeep]]. The giant gave them coins, which acted as keys to further progress through the tower."
