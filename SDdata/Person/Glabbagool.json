        "Personality": "The arrival of the [[demon lord]] [[Juiblex]] in the [[Underdark]] somehow granted Glabbagool sentience. It wanted to avoid fighting, however, and was genuinely curious about the world and the people that inhabited it.",
        "History": "Glabbagool was a gelatinous cube in the Oozing Temple. When [[Juiblex]] arrived in the Underdark, it was granted sentience. It may have met and befriended a party of adventurers escaping the [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]], even offering to travel with them or gift them a magical [[mace]] located within its oozing form."
