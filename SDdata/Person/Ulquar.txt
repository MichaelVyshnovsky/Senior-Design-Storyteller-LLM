Ulquar was a jackalwere priest of Malar in Undermountain in 1479 DR.
In 1479 DR, Ulquar heard about a room sacred to Selûne inside Undermountain where the lycanthropy curse was suppressed. Seeing this as an abomination, Ulquar went to take control of the place and re-educate in Malars ways all the lycanthropes he found there.
Arriving in the room, posing as an elf cleric of Malar, he managed to convince two human werewolves, Josephus Blaze and Mizah Sheloran, to embrace their bestial side.
