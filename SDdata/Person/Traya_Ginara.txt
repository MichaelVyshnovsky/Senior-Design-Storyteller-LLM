'''Traya Ginara''' was a female apprentice at [[Blackstaff Tower]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

==Personality==
Traya was shy, so much so that it meant she rarely spoke to strangers.

==Relationships==
Traya was taught by future-[[Blackstaff]] [[Tsarra Chaadren]].

She was known to have an infatuation for her fellow student [[Lhoris]].

==History==
On [[Uktar 28|28 Uktar]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Traya was a member of a group of eight apprentices, including her teacher, who spent an overnight hunting trip in the [[Pellamcopse Woods]]. She was not very useful at helping hunt, but she managed to collect a number of berries instead. On the return trip to [[Waterdeep]], she was carrying a large basket of [[herb]]s, when they all passed a [[thief]] named [[Raegar Stoneblade]], who had been secretly stalking them. To avoid suspicion, he pretended to be bathing himself in a barrel of cold rain water, which confused Traya, and he flirted with her and her teacher. The ruse appeared to work, as the group were unaware of his significance at the time.
