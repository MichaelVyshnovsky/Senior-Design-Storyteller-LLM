'''Kroyce Tefoco''' was the spouse of [[Oliver Tefoco]], the proprietor of the [[Beehive Goods and Wares]] general store in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Oliver and Kroyce had a number of children. The oldest of them was [[Bubbles Tefoco]], who lived in the [[Stonyeyes]] district of the Gate with her family and the newborn [[Dorimara]]. Another older sibling was [[Dariel Tefoco]] who served the [[Flaming Fist]] in the Gate. [[Thegglis Tefoco|Thegglis]] and [[Crowell Tefoco]] were traveling caravan guards, and the youngest of the bunch, [[Maggie Tefoco|Maggie]], [[Hemjax Tefoco|Hemjax]], and others, still lived with Oliver and Kroyce as of the late 15{{th}} century DR. Oliver's and Kroyce's kids, [[Blunce Tetoco]] and [[Harvel Tefoco]] were amongst the most recently approved applicants to join the Flaming Fist in [[1492 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] threatened Baldur's Gate's safety, Kroyce took Hemjax, Maggie, and other youngest kids to the town of [[Beregost]], to live with Uncle [[Sternwell]], away from the threat of war. Oliver was left behind to run the shop, to Kroyce's dismay, who wrote letters with the updates on the family and Beregost folk's thoughts on the cult. .
