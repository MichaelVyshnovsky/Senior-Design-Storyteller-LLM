        "mainbody": "'''Belim''' was a count and later king in [[Golconda]] in [[Turmish]] in [[1358 DR]].",
        "History": "In [[1355 DR]] the self-styled king of [[Muktar]] started a war against Golconda. In 1358, during a king war council, the spymaster [[Boubakar]] reported that one of his men had discovered that the battle plans of [[Hetep]] were hidden in the small keep of [[Fort Blood]]. Belim did not trust Boubakar's words. However, convinced by Boubakar's argumentations, and despite Belim's objections, King [[Samakay]] hired an adventuring party well-known to him to resolve the matter.\n\nBelim had no intention to change his mind and led a small army of his retainers to attack the adventurers before they arrived at Fort Blood. His plan was to capture them and them to his castle.\n\nAfter the death of king Samakay Belim was one of the two only possible candidates to the throne since Belim died without producing an heir. The other candidate was Baron [[Asakia]]. Neither Belim nor Asakia had the necessary support of three-quarters of the noble heads of household to be elected and Belim refused any compromises.\n\nAfter the adventurers defeated Muktar's troops at the [[Battle of the Wilma Pass]], Belim was crowned king thanks to the retirement of Asakia from the competition. He ordered that all foreigners must leave Golconda, including the victorious adventurers.",
        "Personality": "Belim was truly an obstinate and headstrong individual.",
        "Relationship": "Belim had a tenuous blood relation to the royal family dating from [[958 DR]]."
