        "mainbody": "The '''Unseeing Eye''' was a [[beholder]] who proclaimed himself a [[god]] and formed the [[Cult of the Eyeless]].",
        "Description": "The beholder demanded that his disciples achieve a high level of wisdom, and thus must remove their eyes. Only after removing their \"unholy\" eyes during a sacred initiation were they accepted into his service. Those who lacked the stamina, by not surviving the initiation, would be thrown into a pit of those who were \"faithless\". His \"holy grounds\" were the sewers of Athkatla.",
        "History": "The Unseeing Eye and its Blinded Acolytes first were known to operate out of the city of [[Berdusk]] in the [[Sunset Vale]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}. The Unseen Eye along with its followers were allegedly destroyed by [[Thom Wainwright]], a hero in service of the [[Church of Helm]]. However, the elder orb resurfaced in [[Amnian]] city of [[Athkatla]], becoming an established cult by the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.\n\nThe elder orb desired a valuable item, the [[planar rift device]], beneath the reaches of Athkatla. Upon melding the two parts of the artifact, [[Gorion's Ward]] may have slain the beholder in the [[Pit of the Faithless]].",
