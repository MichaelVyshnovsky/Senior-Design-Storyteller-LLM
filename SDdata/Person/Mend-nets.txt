'''Mend-nets''' was a warrior of the [[Ice Hunters]] tribe that made their home on [[Oyaviggaton]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was a rather untrusting individual that held a distinct distaste for the monstrous creatures that laired within his tribe's icy island-home. He detested the [[kobold]]s that laired within the isle's cave network, loathed its community of revolting [[ice toad]]s, and became completely frightened by its ravenous [[ice troll]] denizens.

==History==
Sometime during or before the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Mend-nets became infected with some sort of disease. He was segregated from the rest of his tribes in the monster-filled caves that wound throughout Oyaviggaton,
