Nimos Palantor was a male human fighter and a member of the Zhentarim. He was the leader of the Grey Feathers, an archery troop based in Darkhold.
Nimos had brown hair and a thin mustache. He wore his splint mail and a bright green cape over his broad-shouldered frame.
Nimos was a born hunter who believed in the thrill of the chase.
Nimos did not like nor trust his fellow captains in Darkhold. It may have been because their commander, the Pereghost, allowed him certain privileges when it came to picking his archers from amongst any of the units of Darkhold, or because he was granted requests such as unlimited arrow supplies and even an order of arquebuses. He even had an arrangement with The Three to eliminate one of his fellow captains, Riviar Darkwind, if anything should happen to Pereghost if he did not shoot Riviar himself first.
Nimos had a magical short sword and magical splint mail as well as his longbow and his green cape which bore his personal symbol - a hunters horn.
