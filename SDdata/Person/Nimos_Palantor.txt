'''Nimos Palantor''' was a male [[human]] [[fighter]] and a member of the [[Zhentarim]]. He was the leader of the [[Grey Feathers]], an archery troop based in [[Darkhold]].

==Description==
Nimos had brown hair and a thin mustache. He wore his splint mail and a bright green cape over his broad-shouldered frame.

==Personality==
Nimos was a born hunter who believed in the thrill of the chase.

==Relationships==
Nimos did not like nor trust his fellow captains in Darkhold. It may have been because their commander, the [[Pereghost]], allowed him certain privilege's when it came to picking his archers from amongst any of the units of Darkhold, or because he was granted requests such as unlimited arrow supplies and even an order of [[arquebus|arquebuses]]. He even had an arrangement with [[The Three]] to eliminate one of his fellow captains, [[Riviar Darkwind]], if anything should happen to Pereghost if he did not shoot Riviar himself first.

==Possessions==
Nimos had a magical [[short sword]] and magical [[splint mail]] as well as his longbow and his green cape which bore his personal symbol - a hunter's horn.
