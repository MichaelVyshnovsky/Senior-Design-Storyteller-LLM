'''Viticun''' was a sage and [[Red Wizard]] in [[Eltabbar]] in [[1358 DR]]. His area of expertise was the understanding of [[magic]] and its relationship to the [[Inner Planes]] and [[Outer Planes]] and nobody knew more than him about this. He worked only for fellow Red Wizards. A story told that the [[Simbul]] visited him in magical disguise and stole a great secret.

==Personality==
Viticun did not care for politics and conquest.
