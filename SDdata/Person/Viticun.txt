Viticun was a sage and Red Wizard in Eltabbar in 1358 DR. His area of expertise was the understanding of magic and its relationship to the Inner Planes and Outer Planes and nobody knew more than him about this. He worked only for fellow Red Wizards. A story told that the Simbul visited him in magical disguise and stole a great secret.
Viticun did not care for politics and conquest.
