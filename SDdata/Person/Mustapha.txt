Mustapha was human physician inhabiting Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Mustapha was a secretive individual.
Mustapha was once a prominent healer known throughout Golden Huzuz. Due to financial ruin, he spent his twilight years roaming the bazaars and less savory areas of Huzuz, offering his services to any in need.
Mustapha abandoned his wife Bassorah one night after she used his money to host a lavish party.
