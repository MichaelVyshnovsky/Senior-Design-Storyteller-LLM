'''Agrath Dundai''' was the proprietor of the [[Watchful Turtle]] warehouses in [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] by [[1366 DR]] and through [[1370 DR]].

He was a bearded old man possessed of a wry humor. He told many tales about Loudwater and the surrounding lands. For example, he spread the rumor that there was a crypt beneath the [[High Lord's Hall]], supposedly haunted by undead, namely the remnants of former High Lords of Loudwater, and that some of them had experimented with dark [[magic]].
