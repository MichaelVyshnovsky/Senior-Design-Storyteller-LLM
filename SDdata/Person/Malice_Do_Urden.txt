Malice DoUrden was matron mother of House DoUrden of Menzoberranzan until her death. She was a strong high priestess of Lolth, although her fall was in losing the favor of Lolth.
Malice was slender and deceptively small, around 5 ft (1.5 m), but she was very strong. Her eyes appeared red in the infrared spectrum, like most drows, but appeared deep green in the light. Despite already being almost 5 centuries old, her appearance was still as youthful and lithe as when she was only one hundred years old. That changed when she had to maintain the Zin-carla functional, which drained much of her mental strength and diminished her physical body, progressively resembling Matron Baenre.
Malices amorous exploits with the males of House DoUrden (and many others) were legendary in Menzoberranzan.
Matron Mother Malice owned a strange and unique rod of reincarnation, gifted to her during the House DoUrdens good graces in the eyes of Lolth. The scepter possessed the abilities of a regular rod of resurrection, but also could instantly destroy a creature, rebirthing them as a completely random new being of the same power level. The knowledge of the item was lost with Malices death as she kept the rods existence a secret.

Malice was the daughter of Vartha DoUrden, the former matron mother of House DoUrden. Vartha was murdered by Malice through a spell of poisoning when Malice was about 100 years old (around the 11 century DR). Nobody asked questions and thus Malice ascended to the head of House DoUrden, where she ruled successfully for four centuries.
In 1297 DR, Malice used the agony of childbirth to increase her clerical power in an attack against House DeVir, which was destroyed. The baby, Drizzt DoUrden, was to be sacrificed as the third living son, but Dinin DoUrdens assassination of elderboy Nalfein DoUrden fulfilled that sacrifice and Drizzt was permitted to live.
In 1338 DR, House DoUrden and Matron Malice first fell out of the favor of Lolth when a member of her house displeased Lolth. Malice scried a scene between Drizzt and his father Zaknafein DoUrden and discovered that Drizzt refused to kill (and indeed saved) an elven child during a surface raid, thus drawing Lolths wrath. Malice planned to sacrifice Drizzt, but Zaknafein offered himself up instead. Drizzt subsequently killed Masoj Hunett and Alton DeVir, triggering a decade war between House DoUrden and House Hunett, and departed the city altogether.
Malice never regained Lolths favor after Drizzts actions. Ten years later, in 1338 DR, the two houses finally ended their covert war when House Hunett attacked and were defeated by House DoUrden. Yvonnel Baenre forced Malice to "adopt" SiNafay Hunett as Shinayne DoUrden, her eldest "daughter" recently returned home. Malice detested her and at the last moment sacrificed her instead of Rizzen to Lolth as an offering for Zin-carla, a "spirit-wraith" which was normally allowed only under Lolths highest favor but was granted to Malice as a last-ditch effort to find and kill Drizzt. When Zin-carla (which was Zaknafein DoUrden resurrected and controlled by Malice) found Drizzt, Malice lost control of it for a moment, which was enough time for Zaknafein to kill himself instead of allowing his body to kill Drizzt. This caused Malice to forever lose the favor of Lolth and to be killed by Briza, in one last desperate — and futile — attempt to regain Lolths favor for House DoUrden. The house was defeated by House Baenre in 1339 DR.
Malice was very good at making salves and unguents.
Malice was the mother of Briza, Nalfein, Dinin, Vierna, Maya, and Drizzt. Briza was born when Malice was about 100 years old. She was sired by Uthegentel DelArmgo. Nalfein was born soon before or after her. The father of Vierna and Drizzt was Zaknafein DoUrden, Malices on-and-off lover, while the father of Dinin and Maya was Rizzen DoUrden, the patron of House DoUrden.
Malice hated Zaknafein as much as she desired him. She permitted him to live despite his express disregard for Lolth.
