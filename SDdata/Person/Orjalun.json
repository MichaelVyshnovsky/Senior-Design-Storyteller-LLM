        "mainbody": "Orjalun was the kind and just High Mage of Silverymoon during the citys early days. He was one of the most polite and cultured wizards ever known. Prior to being High Mage, he was Keeper of the Vault of the Sages.  \nWhen Orjalun left his post, the city was entrusted to his treacherous apprentice. It was speculated that he sought his death or a quiet life of solitude. While he was believed to be dead, there were rumors of a mage befitting Orjaluns characteristics seeking a tome called the Arbatel."
