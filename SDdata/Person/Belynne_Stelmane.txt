Duke '''Belynne Stelmane''' was one of the members of the [[Council of Four]], the governing body of [[Baldur's Gate]], during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was a shrewd businessperson who also was a member of the [[Baldurian]] branch of the [[Knights of the Shield]], a secret cadre of merchants and information brokers.

==Description==
Belynne had a bold and creative mind for commerce and finances and was long-regarded as a fierce politician. In her later years, however, she was rather uninspired in the aspects of her life outside of business.

For most of her life, Belynne was considered a handsome woman who walked with impeccable grace. After her injury, she was left partially paralyzed, suffering both physical ailments as well as slurred speech.

==History==
[[File:Gazette Stelmanes murder.png|thumb|''Belynne Stelmane's dead body, found on the second floor of the [[Elfsong Tavern]].''|330x330px]]
Sometime prior to the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Duke Stelmane suffered a debilitating stroke brought on by the assault of a [[The Emperor|mind flayer]]. She was left in a coma for several days while she and the [[aberration]] engaged in a psychic battle for control of her mind. Though she was able to conduct business for the Knights of the Shield for some time, she continued to struggle to merely control her body and mind for over a decade, well into the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.

During the rise of the [[the Absolute]] that same year, she was murdered by [[Church of Bhaal|Bhaalists]] in the [[Elfsong Tavern]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]. She was paralyzed with [[crawler mucus]] and stabbed thirty six times, with the cause of death being bloodless. Her hand was cut off and her body framed as a plot by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] to instill fear in the city. The deceased Duke's funeral was delayed until the death investigation was complete.
