Duke Belynne Stelmane was one of the members of the Council of Four, the governing body of Baldurs Gate, during the late 15 century DR. She was a shrewd businessperson who also was a member of the Baldurian branch of the Knights of the Shield, a secret cadre of merchants and information brokers.
Belynne had a bold and creative mind for commerce and finances and was long-regarded as a fierce politician. In her later years, however, she was rather uninspired in the aspects of her life outside of business.
For most of her life, Belynne was considered a handsome woman who walked with impeccable grace. After her injury, she was left partially paralyzed, suffering both physical ailments as well as slurred speech.
