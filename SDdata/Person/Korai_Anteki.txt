'''Korai Anteki''' was a [[machi-yakko]] leader in [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Anteki was the son of [[Korai Urushi]], a modest rice merchant in [[Iiso]]. However, when Anteki was young, customers mysteriously stopped going to his father's shop. Ruined, Urushi sold his business to [[Osahichiro Yoto]], Iiso's largest rice trader.

Anteki became convinced that the ruining of his father's business was a government plot and joined a machi-yakko group. In time, he became the leader of the group thanks to his skills and started a private war against the local businessmen, especially Yoto.
