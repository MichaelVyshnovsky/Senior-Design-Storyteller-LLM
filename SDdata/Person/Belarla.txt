'''Belarla''' was a [[pleasure queen]] in [[Zhentil Keep]] as of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], and also a [[Harper]].

==Personality==
She knew all the dirty jokes in the business.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|301-302|19}}

==Relationships==
She was never far from [[Oelaerone]], and she knew [[Mirt]].

==History==
Belarla's work as a Harper and a pleasure queen of Zhentil Keep continued until the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, when Mirt called upon her to aid [[Shandril Shessair]] after her first assault on the [[Citadel of the Raven]]. They followed her afterwards when she set out to attack the [[Wizards' Tower]].{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|287-295|18}}

Myrintara later transported them to the [[Lonesome Tankard]] in [[Eveningstar]].{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|297-300|18}} There, she argued in favor of Shandril striking again at the Zhents, rather that fleeing to [[Silverymoon]].{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|304-305|19}} During the tussle with the forces of [[Fzoul Chembryl]] at the Wizards' Tower, Belarla was struck senseless early, taking her out of the fight.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|312-314|20}} She survived the fight, however, and was healed by a kiss from Shandril and her ''[[spellfire]]'', getting well enough to leave on her own power soon after.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|323-325|20}}

Later that year, Belarla was drinking with Mirt when he and Asper were called magically to the aid of Shandril in the moments leading up to her death.{{cite web/Hand of Fire}}Belarla is not present in the depiction of the events in the book; the web excerpts are taken to be corrections.
