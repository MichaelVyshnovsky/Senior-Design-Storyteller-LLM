        "mainbody": "'''Sweor Tobregdan''' was the second mate of the [[hammership]], the ''[[Probe]]''.",
        "Relationships": "As second mate, Sweor served directly below [[Aelfred Silverhorn]] in the hierarchy of command\n\nAlong with Aelfred and the [[elven]] [[wizard|mage]] [[Vallus Leafbower]], Sweor was one of the only three crewmembers of the ''Probe'' with whom [[Teldin Moore]]—future Cloakmaster—felt comfortable carrying on a long conversation.",
        "History": "Formerly a mercenary, Sweor joined the crew of the ''Probe'' to escape execution or assassination.\n\nOn the journey from [[Krynn]] to [[Toril]], while in the [[Phlogiston|flow]], the ''Probe'' was attacked by a [[neogi deathspider]]. Before the battle, Aelfred assigned Sweor to lead the defense of the hammership's aftcastle. After taking heavy damage from projectiles, the hammership was crippled, grappled, and boarded. As slaves poured onto the deck, Sweor recklessly leapt from the aftcastle ladder into the horde, easily dispatching four of the invading [[human]]s quickly with his blade."
