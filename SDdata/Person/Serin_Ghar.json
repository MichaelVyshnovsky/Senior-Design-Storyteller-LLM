        "mainbody": "Grand Admiral Serin Ghar was commander of the Evermeet Fleet and leader of the entire Elven Imperial Navy.\nIn the later half of the thirteenth century DR, Serin Ghar&mdashwho was always called by both names&mdashwas a middle-aged elf of great beauty. She was especially popular among the elven youth of Evermeet.\nExtremely famous on the island of Evermeet, Serin Ghar was considered the epitome of honor and loyalty. She was quick to make decisions yet slow to get angry.\nSerin Ghars flagship was an elven Armada, which carried on board the most highly advanced weapons of the Elven Fleet. Her vessel was armed with 21 heavy weapons around the year 1364 DR.\nAs Grand Admiral, Serin Ghar headed the Council of Admirals, which met on the hidden space station Lionheart. In addition to sitting at the top of the hierarchy of the Imperial Fleet and controlling its every aspect, she was also in charge of administering the Evermeet blockade, including every non-private spelljamming craft of Evermeet. She was advised by a Cabinet of senior-ranking elves, who kept her up-to-date on happenings in space.\nSerin Ghar became Grand Admiral sometime after 1362 DR and the beginning of the Second Unhuman War.\nCategoryAdmirals\nCategoryInhabitants of Evermeet\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of Realmspace\nCategoryMembers of the Elven Imperial Navy\nCategoryRangers\nCategoryElves\nbpfn63ugqdgz9wi927dmh7oxi0l2mae"
