'''Verillius Receptor''' was a High Inquisitor who served [[Zariel]], the Archduchess of [[Avernus]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Verillius often took on disguises and false shapes when she was traveling on her hellish mistress's orders. Her true form was unknown, but it was said she was a gargantuan creature, mind-scarring to behold.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Verillius was officially entitled to visit the [[House of Hope (Avernus)|House of Hope]] and audit the collection of [[artifact]]s displayed in [[Raphael]]'s library. The very same collection contained the ''[[Orphic Hammer]]'' that may have been stolen from the Nine Hells by the [[Absolute Adversaries]].
