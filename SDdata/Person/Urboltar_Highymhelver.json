        "mainbody": "Urboltar Highmyelver was the Magister from  to . He was driven insane by his scrying.\nHe was a nondescript man of middling height.\nUrboltar was ambitious and ruthless. By the end of his tenure, however, he was consumed by madness.\nHe cast the spellseeking worm that led him to Tsjancy Yildree. He never gained the power to compel anyone to do anything, though he sought it.\nAt the time of slaying the previous Magister, Urboltar schemed to control Faer√ºn by compelling hordes of orcs to destroy whatever stood in his way.\nBefore his schemes could come to fruition, however, he came into possession of an enchanted full-body mirror. The visions in the mirror, those of three black cloaked figures with flowing, changing, elongated limbs, haunted him for the rest of his days, rendering all his nights sleepless. He was wracked by hallucinations and rendered an erratic, irresponsive, dangerous wreck. He murmured when found by Tyvbolt Arsurath and screamed, but did not fight back.\nThe nature of his visions was a subject of debate, alternatively interpreted as malaugrym, Imaskari mages trapped in the mirror, or others.\nUrboltar and the consequences of his scrying were remembered in the popular ballad, Ever is Weather."
