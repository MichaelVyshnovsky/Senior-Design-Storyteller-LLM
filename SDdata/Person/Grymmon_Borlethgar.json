Grymmon stood well over  tall. He was 80 years old circa the .\nAs Olembarlar, Grymmon was the head of Tulmons armed forces—the Stone Spears.\nHe wore a splendid suit of plate armor and wielded a massive two-handed sword.\nMany in Tulmon believed Grymmon was sustained to his advanced years by aid from Torm or Tempus, but the truth was that his armor could fully heal him every few days as needed. Grymmon used this power when uninjured to rejeuvenate his body to that of a younger man."
