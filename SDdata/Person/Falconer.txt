Falconer was an unusual dwarf in peace with nature. He worshiped [[Chauntea]] and was able to communicate with animals, which always filled his house.

His home was located in central of Daggerford along [[Fields Lane]] and [[Farmer's Road]] next to the market.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
