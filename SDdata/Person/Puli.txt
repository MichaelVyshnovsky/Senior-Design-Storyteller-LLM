Tracker '''Puli''' was a [[goblin]]  [[Cult of the Absolute|cultist]] of [[the Absolute]] who served her goddess at the [[Shattered Sanctum]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Hey...hey! You ain't roundin' me up for no raid. No Way. I'm drinkin'!|Aggy.}}

==Description==
Puli had yellow-brown skin and light brown hair. She wore stitched leather clothing and decorated her skin with pink body paint.

==Personality==
By all accounts, Puli would much rather be drinking and celebrating, rather than out on actual raids.

==Possessions==
In battle, she fought with a crude wooden [[bow]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, cultists of the Absolute let a terrible raid upon  the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn. After their victory, they celebrated with a grand feast—complete with lots of [[ale]]—back at the Shattered Sanctum. It was not quite clear if Puli participated in the raid, but she was an enthusiastic reveler at the feast.
