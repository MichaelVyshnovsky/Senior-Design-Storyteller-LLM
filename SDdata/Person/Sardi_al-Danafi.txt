Sardi al-Danafi was an inhabitant of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Sardi was a fair man, though the occasional bribe padded his pockets.
Sardi was the harbormaster of the Trade Harbor in Huzuz. He answered to Keyfa al-Parid.
He insured that any ships carrying goods for his family were docked quickly at the best locations in the harbor. 
He was the youngest scion of the House of Al-Danafi.
