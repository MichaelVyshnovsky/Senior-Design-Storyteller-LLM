'''Falaster Fisk''' ({{Pronounce|FAL|ass|ter|refs=}}) was a spy during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Falaster and [[Sylvira Savikas]] of [[Candlekeep]] were  good friends.

==History==
At some point Falaster accompanied Sylvira to recruit the learned [[sage]] [[Shandeir]] to help translate the ''[[tome of Zariel]]''. They worked on behalf of [[Thavius Kreeg]], who sought a solution to help [[Elturel]] and problem with the [[undead]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 2|9-11}} While [[Hesperornis|their ship]] was destroyed by the [[red dragon]] [[Hoondarrh]] at the isle of [[Mintarn]], Falaster managed to survive.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 2|12-14}}

Some time later in the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} Falaster was hired by the sage Sylvira again to investigate the whereabouts of Thavius Kreeg, fearing that he had been corrupted by an [[archdevil]]. Falaster correctly deduced that the cleric was shielded by the Baldurian [[Vanthampur]] family but was captured during a reconnaissance inside their [[Vanthampur Villa|estate]] in the [[Upper City]].
