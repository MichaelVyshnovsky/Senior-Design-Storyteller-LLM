        "mainbody": "Frulam Mondath was a member of the reformed Cult of the Dragon of Severin Silrajin, holding the rank of Wearer of the Purple.\nMondath considered Langdedrosa Cyanwrath her right-hand, and often kept the half-dragon at her side.\nShe was the leader of the Cult army in the assault on Greenest, and Langdedrosa Cyanwrath usually followed her directives. At the Cults camp near the city, Frulam deferred to the half-dragon Rezmir, who was her superior.\nWhen adventurers raided the camp, Frulam fought them but was easily defeated and captured. She hesitantly told the adventurers what she knew about the Cults plan to summon Tiamat, which was minimal.\nLater, Frulam was held captive by the Harpers for trial."
