'''Nevessam''' was a [[necromancer]] of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]] in the city of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Personality==
Nevessam preferred direct confrontation and combat to subterfuge and diplomacy, however, if the enemies of the Cult were to surrender, he accepted it albeit reluctantly.

==Abilities==
Adept at combat spellcasting, Nevessam attempted to affect his enemies with the ''[[slow]]'' spell first, and then showering them with offensive magics at his disposal.

==History==
During the Cult of the Dragon's occupation of Myth Drannor in 1369 DR, Nevessam was tasked by commander [[Shamoor]] to find a way to unseal the [[Crypt of Rothilion]]. When a word came that a group of adventurers was making way through the Cult's forces in the [[Polyandrium]], Nevessam tracked their efforts to [[Lyssic's Crypt]]. He knew that the adventurers were successful in retrieving the ''rune of stars'' one of many ancient arcane locks placed on locations of the abandoned city. Nevessam and four of his sentries ambushed the adventurers and disarmed them. Taking hold of their discoveries, Nevessam escorted them to the entrance to the Crypt of Rothilion. The Cult had a way of entering the tomb thanks to the unwilling help of the adventurers. Unfortunately for the necromancer, his fellow cultists fled in sight of the impressive unsealing magic, leaving Nevessam alone, in the company of the captured adventurers. Even though Nevessam attempted to escape, he was captured and in order to survive, he revealed the plans of the Cult of the Dragon for the "contingent ceremony" that involved [[dracolich]] [[Pelendralaar]]'s ''[[phylactery]]'' and the ''[[pool of radiance]]''.
