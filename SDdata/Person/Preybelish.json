        "mainbody": "reybelish was a mysterious and reclusive dark naga amulet collector who resided in the Dwarven Dungeons under Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR.\nPreybelish was a  long dark sage whose longed coiling body was adorned by numerous necklaces, amulets, and periapts, his entire collection.\nPreybelish was not overly aggressive, his main passion was obsessive amulet collecting, and the dark naga was willing to negotiate with warm-bloods to expand the collection. Nevertheless, Preybelish did not tolerate insults and retaliated against anyone who dared to insult the naga.\nPreybelish did not like to talk about himself and claimed that his story was a tragic one. The dark naga seemingly preferred brooding in the darkness contemplating his mistakes, and passing adventurers with precious necklaces were his glimmer of joy.\nLike other dark nagas, Preybelish was a powerful opponent. The creature was fiercely intelligent and an adept spellcaster. Preybelish also had the ability to spit poison. The dark naga was immune to poison and resistant to charm.\nPreybelish possessed an uncanny ability to read his opponents thoughts, often using the gift cunningly against the nagas enemies.\nPreybelishs amulet collection consisted of a +5 necklace of protection,  a +2 amulet of protection, a 1+ amulet of protection from paralysis, and a medallion of defense.\nIn 1369 DR, the group of adventurers sent by Elminster to stop the Pools of Radiance resurgence in Myth Drannor was warned of Preybelish by Faeril and the healer Beriand sheltering on the ruins surface. The dark naga was sheltering in the Dwarven Dungeons, on what used to be the Avenue of Smiths behind a magically sealed door. The creatures lair was filled with magical darkness that served to disorient possible enemies.\nPreybelish was looking to acquire magical amulets that were scattered around the Dwarven Dungeons, namely a bloodstone amulet, Onglores amulet of war, Theodores token of luck, and Tyrs locket of justice."
