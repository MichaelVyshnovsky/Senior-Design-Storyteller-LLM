        "History": "Kachin led the most powerful temple in [[Ulatos]]. In 1361 DR, he discovered that the young slave [[Erixitl]] would be decisive in the plan for the return of his god. He went to [[Kultaka]] and bought her from her master, transporting her to Payit with the idea of making Erixitl a high priestess.\n\nKachin taught her all about the faith of Qotal, but because of the plots of the worshipers of [[Zaltec]] she was instead decisive in starting the war between the [[Golden Legion]] and the [[Payit (ethnicity)|Payits]].\n\nMeanwhile, Kachin and Erixitl befriended the young stranger [[Halloran]] but some time after they were attacked by one of the [[Ancient Ones]], [[Spirali]]. They managed to kill him only thanks to the arrival of the [[Nexalan]] [[Eagle Knights (Maztica)|Eagle Knight]] [[Poshtli]] but it was too late for Kachin."
