'''Qarbo''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Personality==
Qarbo was cruel and more than a little manic in his demeanor. He liked to grin slyly at strangers, as if enjoying an inside joke.

==Activities==
Qarbo ran all the day-to day activities of the cult inside the monastery.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], [[Hellenrae]], Qarbo, and their minions disguised themselves as monks occupying the [[Sacred Stone Monastery]]. Soon after, however, some adventurers infiltrated the monastery and in the end confronted and defeated Qarbo.
