'''Issem''' was a [[vampire]] in the [[Doomvault]] dungeon in [[1486 DR]].

==History==
Issem was a vampire who, in ancient times, was cursed to be bound to the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] and specifically to the [[Doomvault]] dungeon.

In 1486 DR, he was in charge of the main upper level, also guarding the prisoner [[Shalendra Floshin]].

==Personality==
In truth, Issem hated the Red Wizards and it was only the curse that obliged him to work for them. Thus, adventurers could potentially persuade him to help them ruin the Red Wizards' plans.
