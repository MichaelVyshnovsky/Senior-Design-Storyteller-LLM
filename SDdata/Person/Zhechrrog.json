        "History": "In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, Zhechrrog's Stone Knives tribe discovered the shipwreck of the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' on [[Omgar's Teeth]]. The vessel belonged to [[Sa'Sani]] of [[Samargol]] and her trade company. The surviving crew members, including Captain [[Lastri Kassireh]] and her First Mate [[Kadjin]] were captured, while many other injured sailors were slaughtered and used as food. When Sa'Sani sent a band of adventurers to free the [[halfling]] captain, Zhechrrog pleaded with the heroes for her life, lying in broken [[Common]] about the evil [[Shattered Spear tribe]] forcing her tribe from [[Samarlogh]] and the tribe starving. Lastri Kassireh was the last surviving sailor, and she quickly revealed the Chieftan's lies and how the goblins ate First Mate Kadjin. When Chieftain Zhechrrog's lies were exposed, she proudly proclaimed war and attacked the adventurers, ending up slain."
