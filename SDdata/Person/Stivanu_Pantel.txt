Stivanu Pantel was a bloodforge mage in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648–657 DR).
Stivanu was a hedonist and obsessed with games of every kind and wasted a lot of time in the Puzzle Palace, forgetting work, home, and friends. The leader of the Legendary Campaign decided to force Stivanu out and face reality, with the two waging a bloodforge battle there.
