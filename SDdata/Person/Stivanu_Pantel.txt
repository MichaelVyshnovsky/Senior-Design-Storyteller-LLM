'''Stivanu Pantel''' was a [[bloodforge]] mage in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

Stivanu was a hedonist and obsessed with games of every kind and wasted a lot of time in the [[Puzzle Palace]], forgetting work, home, and friends. The leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] decided to force Stivanu out and face reality, with the two waging a bloodforge battle there.
