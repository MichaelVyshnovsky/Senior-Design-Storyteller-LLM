        "mainbody": "'''Elegis''' was a [[tiefling]] from the [[Western Heartlands]] that was forced to flee from [[Elturel]] along with her kin during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|If I see a [[goblin]], I'm closing this gate â€” whether you're inside or not.|Elegis, to one of the [[True Soul]]s.}}",
        "Personality": "Due to the traumas she faced on the road as a refugee, Elegis developed a significant fear of [[goblin]]s and goblinkind.",
        "History": "Following [[the Descent]] of Elturel in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, where the city was briefly pulled down to the [[Nine Hells]], all the tieflings in the city were expelled due to the mistaken belief they were somehow associated with the catastrophe. Elegis joined the group led by [[Zevlor]] one of the city's famed [[Hellriders]], and journeyed with them west towards [[Baldur's Gate]].\n\nWhen the group was forced to take shelter with the [[druid]]s of the [[Emerald Grove]] due to increased [[goblinoid]] attacks across the region, Elegis took post at the great portcullis that shielded the grove and its cave network from the surrounding lands."
