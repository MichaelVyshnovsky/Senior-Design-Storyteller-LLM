'''Minnen''' was an old chamberlain in [[Sembia]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Minnen was the chamberlain of Overmaster [[Kendrick Selkirk]].

==Personality==
Minnen showed himself to be totally loyal to his master, even after his death.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Kendrick was poisoned by [[Rivalen Tanthul]] of [[Thultanthar]]. After discovering the dead body, Minnen called Countess [[Mirabeta Selkirk]] in order to inform the family and asked the [[Church of Tyr]] to organize the funeral, as wished by Kendrick. Mirabeta convinced Minnen of the necessity to examine Kendrick's body in order to avoid suspicions of assassination, and Minnen informed Mirabeta that, as a devout follower of [[Tyr]], Kendrick wrote in his testament to forbid his [[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]] because it was against his god's will.
