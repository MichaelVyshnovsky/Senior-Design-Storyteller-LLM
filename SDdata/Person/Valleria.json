Chanragoupta intended to have the thief hanged at the next dawn, but instead Cadogen escaped his bonds, Valleria fell in love with him, and the pair fled together. To cover their tracks, they pretended that Valleria had been kidnapped and held for ransom, resulting in Chanragoupta paying the full 20,000 gp ransom to no result. Valleria never returned and Chanragoupta feared her to be dead, though he maintained a standing 5,000 gp reward for her safe return. Unbeknownst to him, Valleria and Cadogen had married and had two children together, with Cadogen even becoming a respected constable at Constabulary Branch Three in Eileanar, the same city as Chanragouptas Exotic."
