'''Kromm Kadar''' was a silent blacksmith in [[High Dale]].

==History==
Kromm was once a [[Zhentilar]] warrior before he settled in High Dale as blacksmith but always collaborated with the [[Zhent]]s. When in [[1358 DR]], a secret [[Zhent]] occupation army occupied the dale, the wizard [[Angruin Myrvult]] killed a member of the [[ Council of the High Dale]] spying for [[Sembia]] and placed Kromm in the empty seat.
