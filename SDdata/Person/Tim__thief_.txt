Tim was a halfling thief and slave of Baeloth Barrityl.
The halfling was proficient at using daggers, as well as a shortbow and arrows. Tim wore leather armor, could set traps, and poisoned his weapons. He was the only evil member of his party, which also contained a gnoll, Bort.
Tim and his party were taken from a "shabby saloon" to the Black Pits. They were killed by the Champion of Baeloths Pits and their party in the Black Pits arena.
