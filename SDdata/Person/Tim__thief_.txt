'''Tim''' was a [[halfling]] [[thief]] and [[slave]] of [[Baeloth Barrityl]].

==Description==
The halfling was proficient at using [[dagger]]s, as well as a [[shortbow]] and [[arrows]]. Tim wore [[leather armor]], could set traps, and [[poison]]ed his weapons. He was the only [[evil]] member of his party, which also contained a [[gnoll]], [[Bort]].

==History==
Tim and his party were taken from a "shabby saloon" to the [[Black Pits]]. They were killed by the [[Champion of Baeloth's Pits]] and their party in the Black Pits arena.
