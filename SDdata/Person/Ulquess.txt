'''Ulquess''' was a [[mind flayer]] ambassador from [[Skullport]] in the [[hobgoblin]] settlement in the [[Sargauth Level]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} under orders of the [[Xanathar]], Ulquess served as a diplomatic delegate to the hobgoblin warlord [[Azrok]]. However, its true objective was spying and so it implanted some [[intellect devourer]]s in some [[goblin]] members of Azrok's court.

Thank to these spies, Ulquess discovered the secret of Azrok's blindness and the recent theft of his magical dagger by some [[duergar]] thieves of [[Clan Ironeye]]. Using its infiltrators, the mind flayer spread the truth about Azrok's condition.

==Activities==
Ulquess continued its plot to spread intellect devourers among the [[goblin]]s of the settlement.

==Relationship==
Ulquess had a pet [[beholder]] [[zombie]] but was forced to abandon it in a cave because Azrok disliked it.
