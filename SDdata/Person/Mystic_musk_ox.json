        "mainbody": "The mystic musk ox was a magical, legendary muskox that laired within the maze of King Mertwig in the Vast.\nAny intruder this musk ox attacked in its maze lair would shortly thereafter be teleported outside of it. The creature was also somehow connected to an onyx figurine of a muskox belonging to the royal family, which would grant whoever wielded it protection from the muskox.\nHow the mystic musk ox came to be or how it came to lair within Mertwigs Maze was a mystery."
