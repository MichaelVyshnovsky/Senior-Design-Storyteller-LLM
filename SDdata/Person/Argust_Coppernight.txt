'''Argust Coppernight''' was a [[dwarf]] in [[Undermountain]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
In 1479 DR, he went into Undermountain in search of locations for mining. However, he was captured by the [[goblin]] and [[kobold]] followers of the mad [[half-elf]] mercenary [[Zarr]]. Zarr plucked out the dwarf's eyes for giving him an insolent look. Argust remained shocked and distraught, refusing to move.
