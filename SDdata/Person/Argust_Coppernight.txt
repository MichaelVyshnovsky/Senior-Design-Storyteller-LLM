Argust Coppernight was a dwarf in Undermountain in 1479 DR.
In 1479 DR, he went into Undermountain in search of locations for mining. However, he was captured by the goblin and kobold followers of the mad half-elf mercenary Zarr. Zarr plucked out the dwarfs eyes for giving him an insolent look. Argust remained shocked and distraught, refusing to move.
