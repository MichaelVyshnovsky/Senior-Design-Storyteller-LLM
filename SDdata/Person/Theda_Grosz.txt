{{quote|''Stop crowding me. I'll miss the patrol.''|Theda Grosz}}

==Description==
Theda Grosz was a small [[hin]] woman with short blonde bob haircut, blue eyes, and pale skin.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Theda Grosz could often be found in the Lower City, not far from the [[Blushing Mermaid]] with her [[human]] friend, [[Fast Neddio]]. Together, they spent their days productively â€“ drooling and lusting over passing [[Flaming Fist]] mercenary patrols. Theda was convinced one of the patrolmen, a woman who was not named, made eyes at her.
