'''Andred Kuroone''' was a merchant from the city of [[Zazesspur]] in [[Tethyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Andred was a tall [[human]] man with thick long locks of hair and well-groomed beard and mustache.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Andred made a living my trading in [[thael leaf]] – [[pipeweed]] flavoring, [[herb]]s, [[spice]]s, and dried foods and fruits, such as [[apricot]]s. Some of his clients were found in [[Triboar]] and [[Scornubel]], including [[Lurandural Veltree]] of Scornubel's merchants' guild – [[The Halanthor]]. [[Orstrar Galannavruk]] was his business associate and the main "coin mountain" behind the enterprise, who prepared quality pipeweed mixes for prospect customers, leaving negotiations to more charismatic Andred.
