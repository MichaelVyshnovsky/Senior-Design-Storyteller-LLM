        "mainbody": "'''Arphoind Bleth''' was the child of [[Mondar Bleth]] and his wife, born in [[8 DR]] or [[10 DR]]. <ref group=\"note\">On p. 125 of ''[[Cormyr: A Novel]]'' (paperback, 1998), it is stated that, as of [[16 DR]], Arphoind is \"a strapling of all of eight winters\" (in other words, eight years old), giving a date of birth of [[8 DR]]. On p. 144 of the same book, it is stated that, as of [[26 DR]], Arphoind is \"now sixteen\" which would require his birth to have occurred in [[10 DR]]. Sixteen in [[26 DR]] is more likely because [[Mondar Bleth]] arrived in [[10 DR]] and [[Ondeth Obarskyr]] was present for Arphoind's birth. Arphoind was the first man knighted by [[Faerlthann]].",
        "Relatives": "Arphoind's father was [[Mondar Bleth]]. He was the youngest sibling, his mother having died whilst giving birth.\n\nOver 1300 years later, another member of the Bleth family was given the name Arphoind. [[Arphoind Bleth II]] eventually became the head of the merchant family.{{Cite dragon annual/2000/After the Dragon: The Kingdom of Cormyr Today|65}}"
