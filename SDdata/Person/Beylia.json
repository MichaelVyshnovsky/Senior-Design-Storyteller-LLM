Before that, she led a slavers life in Westgates criminal underbelly known as the Undergate. She served Kajeel, the so-called psion Master of Undergate, but abandoned her old life to serve the Morninglord. She retained a special token that allowed individuals passage to Kajeel through a guarded gate in Undergate. She was afraid of revealing that in front of her superiors at the Morningstar Haven, as she was supposed to dispose of the token by their orders when she joined. It was believed that she parted with the token one way or another, giving it to an adventurer who sought to discover the secrets of a cursed mask associated with the Night Masks in 1374 DR."
