        "mainbody": "'''Corthas Muhleer''' was an infamous [[mage]] who was perhaps the person known for holding the title of [[Magister]] for the shortest period of time in history. Corthas held the tile for less than a full day in [[246 DR]], perhaps not even long enough for his soul to be treated as a Magister by [[Mystra]] in the [[afterlife]].",
        "Personality": "Corthas was ruthless in his approach to \"ruling the world.\"",
        "History": "Though he was able to slay his predecessor, [[Brymmyn Thorl]], Corthas exhausted his physical and magical strength during the duel. He fell into a deep sleep within Brymmyn's castle after the duel, waking to find that a rogue [[wizard]] had stumbled into the stronghold while he was recovering. Through blind luck, the intruding wizard, [[Galeerie Mulurkrath]], had accidentally stumbled through the dangerous traps scattered throughout the keep. Galeerie was ascending a stairway when Corthas came running down from the opposite end. Galeerie picked up a sword he found on the steps and slew Corthas where he stood, giggling along the way."
