Bonnie Charlee was a sailor in the late 15 century DR.
Bonnie was the first mate onboard the swift ship Joens Heirloom under Captain Calico Grimm.
In the , the Joens Heirloom  was designated as the flagship of the Luskan navy under Bregan Daerthe in a fight against the fleet of Brevindon Margaster. Bonnie discussed with Captain Calico, Kimmuriel Oblodra, and Wulfgar how to better fight the Margaster fleet. During the battle, however, the Heirloom was sunk and Bonnie escaped in a lifeboat together with Kimmuriel and Wulfgar.
Thanks to Wulfgar, Bonnie made it to Closeguard Island and was welcomed among the resistance against the Margasters.
After the Margaster takeover of Luskan, Bonnie acted as a spy for Bregan Daerthe and reported the news to Dabnay Trarach, Beniago, Braelin Janquay, and Wulfgar.
