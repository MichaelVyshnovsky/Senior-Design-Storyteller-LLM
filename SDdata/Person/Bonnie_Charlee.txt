'''Bonnie Charlee''' was a sailor in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Bonnie was the first mate onboard the swift ship ''[[Joen's Heirloom]]'' under Captain [[Calico Grimm]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1488}}, the ''Joen's Heirloom''  was designated as the flagship of the [[Luskan]] navy under [[Bregan D'aerthe]] in a fight against the fleet of [[Brevindon Margaster]]. Bonnie discussed with Captain Calico, [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]], and [[Wulfgar]] how to better fight the [[Margaster]] fleet. During the battle, however, the ''Heirloom'' was sunk and Bonnie escaped in a lifeboat together with Kimmuriel and Wulfgar.

Thanks to Wulfgar, Bonnie made it to [[Closeguard Island]] and was welcomed among the resistance against the Margasters.

After the Margaster takeover of Luskan, Bonnie acted as a spy for Bregan D'aerthe and reported the news to [[Dab'nay Tr'arach]], [[Beniago]], [[Braelin Janquay]], and Wulfgar.
