        "mainbody": "'''Kahim el Tunril''' was an armorer who ran the business [[Shields Italazar]] in [[Calimport]], [[Calimshan]], around the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].",
        "Description": "Although he was a slim man who appeared better suited to a life of scholarship and study, Kahim possessed a great, wiry strength.",
        "Personality": "Kahim's ambition was to elevate his armorsmithing skills to match those of [[elf|elven]] artisans, and he spent a great deal of effort toward this goal. He was intrigued by unique armor pieces that taught him something new, such as elven or [[Kozakura]]n pieces, and would always make a personal copy for himself to use as a model. His most prized possession was a suit of [[elven chain mail]], which was left for him to copy by a customer who never returned.",
        "Activities": "Kahim was well known for his great skill as an armorer, which meant he and his staff spent most of their time filling orders for the guards of various [[pasha]]s. However, an especially intriguing challenge could easily grab his focus. Kahim was a regular patron of the [[Jet Jambiya]], where he was known to best many larger foes in arm-wrestling matches."
