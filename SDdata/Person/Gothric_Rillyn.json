        "mainbody": "Gothric Rillyn was an unsavory member of the noble patriar Rillyn family of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nGothric was a sarcastic and foppish man. He had light skin and blonde hair. His mustache and hair were primed and styled to match his frilly finery.\nIn the , Gothric Rillyn crossed the wrong man. He filched something of value from the new crime boss of Baldurs Gate, the man known as the Stone Lord. By extension, Gothric angered the Cult of the Absolute that had indoctrinated the Stone Lord and he ended up being buried alive in the Lower City Graveyard. The headstone that marked his grave was defaced with \"Rotting place of Gothric Rillyn.\" He shared a coffin with some unfortunate, disturbed dead who was buried with an enchanted +1 rapier, and a magical pike. Gothric may have survived the burial with Tymoras blessing as the group known as the Absolute Adversaries couldve come across the buried man who was making a bit too much noise for a dead body."
