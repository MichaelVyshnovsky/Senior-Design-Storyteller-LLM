        "mainbody": "'''Gothric Rillyn''' was an unsavory member of the noble [[patriar]] [[Rillyn]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Stone Lord he calls himself. More like Stone Shite.''|Gothric Rillyn}}",
        "Description": "Gothric was a sarcastic and foppish man. He had light skin and blonde hair. His mustache and hair were primed and styled to match his frilly finery.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Gothric Rillyn crossed the wrong man. He filched something of value from the new crime boss of Baldur's Gate, the man known as the [[Stone Lord]]. By extension, Gothric angered the [[Cult of the Absolute]] that had indoctrinated the Stone Lord and he ended up being buried alive in the [[Lower City Graveyard]]. The headstone that marked his grave was defaced with: \"Rotting place of Gothric Rillyn.\" He shared a coffin with some unfortunate, disturbed dead who was buried with an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[rapier]], and a ''[[magical pike]]''. Gothric may have survived the burial with [[Tymora]]'s blessing as the group known as the [[Absolute Adversaries]] could've come across the buried man who was making a bit too much noise for a dead body."
