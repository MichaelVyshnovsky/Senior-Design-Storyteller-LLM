High Harvestmistress '''Glamerie Windbough''' was a [[human]] [[cleric]] of [[Chauntea]] and the high priestess of the [[House of Plenty]] temple in [[Shadowdale]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She spoke for the farmers of the dale.

==Personality==
Glamerie was introspective and untroubled by stresses and issues around her. As part of her Chauntean faith, she viewed all things as passing in cycles like the seasons of the year, even the Zhentarim occupation.

==Activities==
Glamerie readily and freely gave advice on gardening, and she would bestow healing, albeit for a fee. However, she considered resurrection as being against the cycles of nature, as death gave rise to life in the same manner as composting dead plants to help new ones grow. Hence, she saved ''[[raise dead]]'' [[spell]]s for only the most vital needs, such as for those in direct service to Chauntea or the [[church of Chauntea|church]], those who protected the dale and its woods, or for heroes who really could rid Shadowdale of the Zhents.

During the occupation in 1375, she focused on handling the protests of the fearful and angry folk of Shadowdale and trying to reassure them. She also spoke often with the Zhentarim commanders in an effort to alleviate the stresses of the occupation. Some see her as a collaborator, while others believed she was endeavoring to preserve the dale and its people until the occupation was finally ended.

==Relationships==
''Circa'' [[1358 DR]] through [[1367 DR]], she led 16 priests and priestesses, including two senior assistants, and 36 lay followers at the temple, though there were only 30 lay followers during the occupation.

Glamerie had good relations with Lady [[Immithra Shrae|Shrae]] of the Goddess, high priestess of the [[Bounty of the Goddess]] temple in [[Voonlar]]. ''Circa'' 1367 DR, they worked together on both religious and secular matters, and Glamerie even discreetly alerted Shrae to upcoming assaults on Voonlar by groups based in Shadowdale, so Shrae could prepare and provide support to them without her tipping her hand.<ref>
