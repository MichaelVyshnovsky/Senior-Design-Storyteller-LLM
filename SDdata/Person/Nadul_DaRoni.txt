'''Nadul DaRoni''' was a [[Gnome|gnomish]] artist and inventor who lived as a hermit near [[High Horn]]. He was undoubtedly a genius, but also quite possibly a madman (which may be one of the factors involved in his natural ingenuity).

Some of these inventions were not always foolproof and some were quite risky to use. His [[furnace wagon]], for instance, had a one-in-ten chance of spontaneously combusting per hour of constant use.

He sketched portraits on commission and had drawn [[Elminster]], [[Azoun IV]], and [[Aurora]] (a copy of whose portrait appeared on the cover of her [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue|catalogue]]). If someone sent him their name and location, he would eventually come and find them.<ref>
