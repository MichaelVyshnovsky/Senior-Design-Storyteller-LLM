Nadul DaRoni was a gnomish artist and inventor who lived as a hermit near High Horn. He was undoubtedly a genius, but also quite possibly a madman (which may be one of the factors involved in his natural ingenuity).
Some of these inventions were not always foolproof and some were quite risky to use. His furnace wagon, for instance, had a one-in-ten chance of spontaneously combusting per hour of constant use.
He sketched portraits on commission and had drawn Elminster, Azoun IV, and Aurora (a copy of whose portrait appeared on the cover of her catalogue). If someone sent him their name and location, he would eventually come and find them.
