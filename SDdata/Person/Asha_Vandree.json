        "mainbody": "sha Vandree was a drow priestess of Lolth in the late 15 century DR.\nAsha was ambitious enough to dream of ruling the outpost, but not so courageous as to openly challenge Ilvara Mizzrym, also knowing that for a permanent assignment she needed to also impress her superiors in Menzoberranzan.\nAsha initially considered Ilvara Mizzrym as a model to imitate, but changed her mind after the senior priestess discarded Jorlan Duskryn without hesitation.\nAsha was a drow of Menzoberranzan and a member of House Vandree, living in the Velkynvelve outpost, acting as a junior priestess and second-in-command to Ilvara."
