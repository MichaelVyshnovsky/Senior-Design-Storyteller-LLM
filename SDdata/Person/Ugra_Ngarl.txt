}}'''King Ugra Ngarl''' was an [[orc]] of the [[Skortchclaw]] tribe in the [[Spine of the World]] region of [[Faer√ªn]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Activites==
Around this time, he forced [[goblin]] slaves to mine for [[mithral]] underneath [[Fortress Eyegad]] which was previously a [[dwarf|dwarven]] fortress. The mithral was being sold to a buyer in the [[High Forest]].
