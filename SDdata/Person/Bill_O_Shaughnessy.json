        "mainbody": "Bill OShaughnessy, also known as the dreaded pirate captain Black Bill at sea, was a knavish mariner that often had shore leaves in Daggerfords Black Stone Inn circa 1372 DR.\nBlack Bill OShaughnessy was a barrel-shaped tough and gruff looking older human male with graying hair. His arms were decorated with many mariner tattoos.\nBill OShaughnessy was born in a nice well-off home and never struggled with money nor food. In his early years he was a merchant sailor and a member of Daggerfords Mariners Alliance. He often remembered his maiden sea voyage with nostalgic tears in his eyes. During one of his early journeys as a member of the Alliance, Bills vessel was caught in a violent storm, and to make things worse, attacked by a vicious kraken. The ships captain was the first to be snatched by the krakens tentacles. Left commandoes, the sailors panicked. Bill remembered stories of his sea-fairing grandpa and took command, telling his crewmen to arm their slings with lamp oil. The fiery ballistas lit the sea beast on fire, scaring the sod away and saving the vessel. That adventure prompted Bills rapid promotion to the captain of the ship. Under Bills command, they severed their tied with the Mariners Alliance and became lawless \"freelancers\", as such, Bill took on a new name, Black Bill.\nAround 1372 DR, Black Bill frequented the Black Stone Inn in Daggerford."
