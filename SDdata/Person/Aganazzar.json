Here, he tutored students, in particular [[Aubayreer]] until [[479 DR]], when the student left to continue his research in [[Myth Drannor]].\n\nThe four founders went on to form an alliance of mages known as the Covenant to promote peace among the kingdoms of the [[North]], as well as to prepare them against conflicts with [[orc]]s. In [[1081 DR]], the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] attacked the School of Wizardry and killed Aganazzar.",
            "Legacy": "Some time after the death of Aganazzar, the Red Wizards got their hands on the tome detailing the spell he created. From then on, the spell became used all over [[Faer√ªn]], from novices to masters."
