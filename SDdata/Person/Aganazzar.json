        "mainbody": "Aganazzar, or Aganazzar of Neverwinter, sometimes spelled Agannazar, was a renowned wizard of The Covenant and founder of Neverwinters School of Wizardry. \nThe powerful wizard was credited for his creation of the well-known evocation spell Aganazzars scorcher. The fire spell was inscribed on the first page of the Tome of the Covenant, and was distributed to his apprentices.\nAganazzar also created the less well-known Aganazzars amanuensis and Aganazzars hurlgate spells.\nHe was said to be patient and spent countless hours teaching students about the nature of the Weave.\nThe School of Wizardry was founded in 457 DR by Aganazzar along with his fellow magic enthusiasts Ilyykur, Presper, and Grimwald. Here, he tutored students, in particular Aubayreer until 479 DR, when the student left to continue his research in Myth Drannor.\nThe four founders went on to form an alliance of mages known as the Covenant to promote peace among the kingdoms of the North, as well as to prepare them against conflicts with orcs. In 1081 DR, the Red Wizards of Thay attacked the School of Wizardry and killed Aganazzar.\nSome time after the death of Aganazzar, the Red Wizards got their hands on the tome detailing the spell he created. From then on, the spell became used all over Faer√ªn, from novices to masters."
