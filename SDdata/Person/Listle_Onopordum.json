She stole a powerful magical ruby pendant made by gnome illusionists that granted her life. Then she escaped, rescuing Sifahirs prisoners as she left.\nLater in life, she became an illusionist herself and went to the city of Phlan and apprenticed to the wizard Shal Desanea. Later she joined her friend and later husband Kern Desenea on his quest to retrieve the Hammer of Tyr taken by the dark god Bane. With her fellow Heroes of Phlan, she was instrumental in destroying the Pool of Twilight that was terrorizing the city. In the process, Kern healed Listle, and by Tyrs grace, brought her full life.\nHer husband Kern was one of the paladins from Phlan attending the wedding ceremony for the Open Lord Piergeiron the Paladinson of Waterdeep in 1371 DR. The wedding was a disaster that resulted in the brides abduction. The attending paladin heroes were recruited by Khelben Arunsun to be a part of the rescue mission. Both Listle and Evaine wanted to join their husbands on the adventure, but time was essential and traveling to Waterdeep wouldve taken days. The women stayed behind wishing their partners the blessings of Tyr.\nShe became the wife of Kern Desanea.\nListle was friends with Evaine, the magic-user wife of Miltiades. The women bonded over their husbands close friendship and camaraderie as paladins of Tyr.\nListle was a fun-loving, spirited, and upbeat woman with a streak of fiery temper. She used to mercilessly make fun of her husband, thanks to his student, young Harloon, who followed the paladin around showering him with admiration like a puppy dog."
