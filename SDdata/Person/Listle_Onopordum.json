        "mainbody": "'''Listle Onopordum''' was a [[Living spell|living]] [[illusion]] [[spell]]<ref group=\"note\" name=\"livingspell\">While the living spell was created long after Listle's appearances, she fits perfectly the lore established for their creation, so this article assumes her to be one. turned [[elf]] [[illusionist]] living in [[Phlan]] in the [[Moonsea]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Listle was originally a simple illusion spell created by the evil elf mage [[Sifahir]] to guard his treasure, but somehow, either by its magical power or some spontaneous change, she became self-aware and gained a sense of morality. She stole a powerful magical ruby pendant made by [[gnome]] illusionists that granted her life. Then she escaped, rescuing Sifahir's prisoners as she left.\n\nLater in life, she became an illusionist herself and went to the city of Phlan and apprenticed to the wizard [[Shal Desanea]]. Later she joined her friend and later husband Kern Desenea on his quest to retrieve the [[Hammer of Tyr]] taken by the dark god [[Bane]]. With her fellow Heroes of Phlan, she was instrumental in destroying the Pool of Twilight that was terrorizing the city. In the process, Kern healed Listle, and by [[Tyr]]'s grace, brought her full life.\n\nHer husband Kern was one of the paladins from Phlan attending the wedding ceremony for the [[Open Lord]] [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] of [[Waterdeep]] in [[1371 DR]]. The wedding was a disaster that resulted in the [[Eidola|bride's]] abduction. The attending paladin heroes were recruited by [[Khelben Arunsun]] to be a part of the rescue mission. Both Listle and Evaine wanted to join their husbands on the adventure, but time was essential and traveling to Waterdeep would've taken days. The women stayed behind wishing their partners the blessings of Tyr.",
        "Relations": "She became the wife of Kern Desanea.\n\nListle was friends with [[Evaine]], the magic-user wife of [[Miltiades]]. The women bonded over their husbands' close friendship and camaraderie as paladins of Tyr.",
        "Personality": "Listle was a fun-loving, spirited, and upbeat woman with a streak of fiery temper. She used to mercilessly make fun of her husband, thanks to his student, young [[Harloon]], who followed the [[paladin]] around showering him with admiration like a puppy dog."
