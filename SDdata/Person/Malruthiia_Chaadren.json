        "Background": "Malruthiia was born in the [[Neverwinter Woods]], an illegitimate child. Despite her heritage as an [[Ilbaereth]], she was exiled upon reaching adulthood and set out to make her own way. She met [[Taalmuth Chaadren]] in [[Waterdeep]], a rival hunter, and the couple married in [[1337 DR]].\n\nThe couple became guides for hunting trips and parties around Waterdeep.\n\nWhile on a hunt in the [[Ardeep Forest]] in [[1357 DR]], Taalmuth became involved in a spell battle against a suspected [[lich]] (the true identity of the assailant was not known) and was killed. His entire body was burned by a ''[[fireball]]'' spell, and there were charred areas on nearby trees, destroyed [[skeleton]]s, a pile of stones from an arcane ritual, and a scrap of maroon cloth, which all pointed to a lich as the culprit.\n\nAfter her husband's death, Malruthiia used her connections to gain her daughter Tsarra an apprenticeship at [[Blackstaff Tower]].\n\nMalruthiia was killed in [[1358 DR]], protecting the [[Elfstone Tavern]] and her half-sister [[Yaereene Ilbaereth]] when [[Myrkul]]'s undead horde attacked Waterdeep.",
