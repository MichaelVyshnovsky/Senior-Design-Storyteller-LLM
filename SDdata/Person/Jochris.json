Seeing his students being hurt by Qara, Jochris summoned [[Sydney Natale]] to his quarters, as he wanted revenge on Qara. After a while, Jochris gave Sydney some thread from Qara's robe and some of her hair, as well as his blood, to power a ritual. Sydney summoned an [[animus elemental]], which would track Qara and attack her.<ref>"
