Kossaandar was a shadowslain Blackscale lizardfolk fighter and warchief of the Shadowscale tribe in the Shadow Swamp in the Plane of Shadow in the early 1370s DR. 
Kossaandar was formerly of the Blackscale tribe in the Vast Swamp before being taken and made into a Shadowscale. He became a loyal follower of Ketsarra Shadowscale and served as her warchief.
In early Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, adventurers in service to Mystra presumably destroyed Kossaandar as they dealt with the Shadowscales and their Sharran allies. After his defeat, the remaining Shadowscales scattered across the Shadow Swamp, a tribe no more.
In Ketsarras absence, Kossaandar led the Shadowscales at their warren in the Shadow Swamp. He held court from the so-called Great Warren and dwelled in the chiefs den with its riches. He was advised by the banelar Isti-Zar, whod been sent to the warren by Despayr.
Being a Blackscale, Kossaandar was a hulking great lizard-man as big as an ogre and powerfully muscled. As a shadowslain, shadows clung about his torso and limbs.
Kossaandar had the powers of a Blackscale and of a shadowslain undead and was a powerful master of the greatsword.
Kossaandar was fierce and utterly loyal to Ketsarra.
Kossaandar wielded a +1 greatsword, wore a breastplate, and carried five javelins.
