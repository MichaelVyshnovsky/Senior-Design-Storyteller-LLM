Lord '''Harlshoon''' was a warrior and former commander of Zhentil troops who ascended to become the first Lord of [[Zhentil Keep]].

==Relatives==
Harlshoon had two sons: [[Asmuth]] and [[Manshoon]].

==Background==
Harlshoon's chief rival was the mage [[Calkontor]]. In [[1258 DR]], while the sons of Harlshoon and Calkontor were away from home, Calkontor poisoned Harlshoon and taunted him. Harlshoon was able to throw a chair at Calkontor, throwing him out of a window to his death. Harlshoon died from the poison soon after.
