Lord Harlshoon was a warrior and former commander of Zhentil troops who ascended to become the first Lord of Zhentil Keep.
Harlshoon had two sons Asmuth and Manshoon.
Harlshoons chief rival was the mage Calkontor. In 1258 DR, while the sons of Harlshoon and Calkontor were away from home, Calkontor poisoned Harlshoon and taunted him. Harlshoon was able to throw a chair at Calkontor, throwing him out of a window to his death. Harlshoon died from the poison soon after.
