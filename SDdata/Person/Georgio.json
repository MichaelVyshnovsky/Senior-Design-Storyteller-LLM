        "mainbody": "Georgio was the owner and proprietor of the Golden Goblet Inn in the town of Mossbridges in the late 14 century DR.\nGeorgio was a generous, pleasant, and somewhat handsome man of dark complexion. He had black hair and dark skin.\nGeorgio was familiar with the retired half-orc fighter Chester Hearth and his moorhound, who occasionally visited the Goblet. Georgio also found it notable that the orc always paid with gemstones, rather than with coin.\nThe town of Mossbridges began growing after The Three Women War in the Vast. A new inn opened in the late 14 century DR, Georgios Golden Goblet Inn on the towns main street. It quickly became a local favorite. The owner himself could always be found filling drinks from behind the bar and happily entertaining guests at their tables with tales and spilling local rumors."
