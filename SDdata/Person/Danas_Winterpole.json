She was also a well-known supporter of Dagult Neverembers rule in Neverwinter.\nAround 1479 DR, Danas was brutally killed in her shop, when a plaguechanged aboleth of the Abolethic Sovereignty began to mind-control the citizens of Neverwinter to kill each other. Although she was not the first victim of the aboleth, her suspicious death was what warned the Neverwinter Guard that those killings were something far more sinister than just random murders."
