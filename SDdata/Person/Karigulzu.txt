'''Karigulzu''' was the nominal ruler of [[Red Haven]] in [[Unther]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Karigulzu was sent as a sacrificial lamb to the  most dangerous town of Unther.

==Personality==
Karigulzu believed himself to be smarter than he truly was. He believed that one day he would be the most powerful man in the land but was too stupid to betray the god-king [[Gilgeam]].
