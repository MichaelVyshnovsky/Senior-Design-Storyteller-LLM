Grandmother Ash was an awakened tree in the Vilhon Wilds. She was brought to life and given spell-scarred powers following the events of the Spellplague of 1385 DR.
Grandmother Ash was a fantastically tall tree at the base of the Pilgrims Path, with her topmost branches crowned with a canopy of blue fire. She was surrounded by a field of exposed roots stretching visibly for a mile around her, slowly twining and churning. Her bole was more like a cliff face than an ash trunk. Each leaf on Grandmother Ashs canopy gleamed like a tongue of sapphire flame.
When touched, the trees grayish bark felt warm and comfortingly pleasant.
Grandmother Ashs abilities allowed her to construct a female form made of bark, leaves, stem, and bough, with hands of the knotted root. Thick strands of moss made up her hair and her eyes bore the same blue flames as the trees canopy. Her "skin" was grayish bark of an ash tree and her voice was vibrant with the music of a major chord.
Grandmother Ash was able to communicate with a creature touching her bark via emotional feedback and sensations.
The Spellplague gave her an ability to create temporary simulacrums made of plant matter for ease of communications with creatures passing by. After some time, Grandmother Ash learned to imitate humanoid body language. She was able to move and manifest said form as far as her roots went in the Vilhon Wilds.
By 1396 DR Grandmother Ash has developed both reputation and love for adventures. Herself being bound to the spellscarred Vilhon Wilds she aided countless pilgrims through the perilous territory in exchange for tales of their adventures and heroics. When she met a shou monk Raidon Kane she gladly agreed to help him in his search for a magical blade called Angul. This quest led to a confrontation with Grandmother Ashs enemy that came to Toril from another world - Chalk Destrier.
