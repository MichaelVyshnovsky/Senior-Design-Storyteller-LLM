'''Scorlworyx''' was a [[red dragon]] in the [[Dragonspire Mountains]] in [[1489 DR]].

==History==
One day, she heard that the neighboring [[Circle of the Scale]] had claimed that, thanks to a scale of [[Tiamat]] herself, they could dominate all dragons. Enraged, Scorlworyx attacked the Circle and killed most of the members, bar their leader [[Skovac]], who sealed himself in the temple with the relic.{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|5-6}}

In order to gain her aid, in 1489 DR, [[Tibeem]] and [[Spernik]], agents of the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]], tried to recover the sacred scale.{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|11}}

Around [[1492 DR]] Scorlworyx was intrigued by the new [[Pool of Radiance]] but was tricked by some adventurers.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|161}}
