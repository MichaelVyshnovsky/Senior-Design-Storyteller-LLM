Scorlworyx was a red dragon in the Dragonspire Mountains in 1489 DR.
One day, she heard that the neighboring Circle of the Scale had claimed that, thanks to a scale of Tiamat herself, they could dominate all dragons. Enraged, Scorlworyx attacked the Circle and killed most of the members, bar their leader Skovac, who sealed himself in the temple with the relic.
In order to gain her aid, in 1489 DR, Tibeem and Spernik, agents of the reformed Cult of the Dragon, tried to recover the sacred scale.
Around 1492 DR Scorlworyx was intrigued by the new Pool of Radiance but was tricked by some adventurers.
