Dhalgrave was the leader of the malaugrym in 1358 DR.
As Shadowmaster, Dhalgrave had mastery over the Shadowcrown and the Doomstars, two powerful artifacts given by Malaug himself to the leader of his kin. He had always with him his bodyguard Malator.
In 1357 DR, Dhalgrave noticed the hunt for Shandril Shessair.
In 1358 DR, Dhalgrave knew he was dying so he needed to choose a replacement as Shadowmaster Supreme. When Lady Saharel, one of the only two beings besides Dhalgrave who knew how to wield, empower, or destroy the Crown and Stars of Malaug, died defending Elminster Aumar, Dhalgrave ordered a hunt upon Elminster, the other remaining being. He declared the killer of the Old Mage would be the next Shadowmaster Supreme.
After it was discovered that the Simbul was hidden among a large malaugryms party that was attacking El, causing the death of most of them, Dhalgrave ordered to close the gate to Toril until decided what do with this new foe.
Some time later Dhalgrave disappeared. 
However after the Rangers Three and their companions attacked the Castle of Shadows, killing Argast, Amdramnar and Lorgyn Dhalgrave resurfaced, explaining to have hid in a secret grotto inside the castle all the time, waiting for the right occasion. However when he proclaimed his evil plans and tried to kill the humans his cloak attacked and killed him with blue fire, being for truth Elminster in disguise.
