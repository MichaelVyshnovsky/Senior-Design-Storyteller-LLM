'''Dhalgrave''' was the leader of the [[malaugrym]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Activities==
As [[Shadowmaster]], Dhalgrave had mastery over the [[Shadowcrown]] and the [[Doomstars]], two powerful [[artifact]]s given by [[Malaug]] himself to the leader of his kin. He had always with him his bodyguard [[Malator]].

==History==
In [[1357 DR]], Dhalgrave noticed the hunt for [[Shandril Shessair]].

In [[1358 DR]], Dhalgrave knew he was dying so he needed to choose a replacement as Shadowmaster Supreme. When Lady [[Saharel]], one of the only two beings besides Dhalgrave who knew how to wield, empower, or destroy the Crown and Stars of Malaug, died defending [[Elminster Aumar]], Dhalgrave ordered a hunt upon Elminster, the other remaining being. He declared the killer of the Old Mage would be the next Shadowmaster Supreme.

After it was discovered that the [[Simbul]] was hidden among a large malaugrym's party that was attacking El, causing the death of most of them, Dhalgrave ordered to close the [[gate]] to [[Toril]] until decided what do with this new foe.

Some time later Dhalgrave disappeared. 

However after the [[Rangers Three]] and their companions attacked the [[Castle of Shadows]], killing [[Argast]], [[Amdramnar]] and [[Lorgyn]] Dhalgrave resurfaced, explaining to have hid in a secret grotto inside the castle all the time, waiting for the right occasion. However when he proclaimed his evil plans and tried to kill the [[humans]] his cloak attacked and killed him with [[blue fire]], being for truth Elminster in disguise.
