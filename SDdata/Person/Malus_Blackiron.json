        "mainbody": "'''Malus Blackiron''' was a [[duergar]] [[specter]] priest of [[Deep Duerra]] and a member of [[Clan Blackiron]] at the small duergar settlement of [[Fort Iron]] in the [[Underdark]] under [[Mulmaster]] in the [[Moonsea]].",
        "History": "Over time, most of Malus's fellow duergar went mad as a result of the influence of the [[Seed of Fel Earth]], a sentient stone part of [[Ogr√©moch]]. Malus's cleric powers protected him but, circa [[1486 DR]], the seed directed against him a [[purple worm]] and in the battle they slew each other. Malus however rose again as a specter.\n\nHe remained in the mine until [[1491 DR]], when an adventuring party hired by [[Leleanor]] to explore the mine found and defeated him.",
        "Personality": "As a specter, Malus had a mental connection to the seed that tormented him. He felt as though he was a germ trapped inside a great restless beast and he felt all of its pain. He frequently rambled his lamentations and was prone to violent outbursts."
