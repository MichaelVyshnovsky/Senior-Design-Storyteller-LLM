        "mainbody": "Morus Brokengulf II was a paladin of the Knights of Samular in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.\nMorus II was, from the age of 16, a devoted paladin and Tyrran zealot, even cutting off his right hand in sacrifice to Tyr and soon joining the Knights of Samular.\nAfter a long time hunting evil throughout the Sword Coast, the death of Lord Morus Brokengulf I forced Morus II to become the next patriarch of the Brokengulf family. However, after some months of work, Morus II was greatly frustrated and turned over day-to-day operations of the family business to fellow Knight Gareth Cormaeril, and again set out to fight evil.\nMorus II sometimes returned to the city but spent most of his time fighting monsters and hunting Claugiyliamatar, the old enemy of his family."
