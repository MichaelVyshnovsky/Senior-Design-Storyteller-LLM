'''Nalos of Pumanath''' was the [[triton]] centurion of the sixth squad of [[Abydos]] and a member of the [[Nantarn Council]].

==Personality==
Initially during the [[Twelfth Serôs War]], Nalos was skeptical about his mission and his position but, by [[1370 DR]], he had come to appreciate the shallow waters. His only concern was his brother's situation after the latter's acquisition of ''[[Claw of Xynakt]]''; however, his contacts among the [[dukar]]s reassured Nalos.

==Activities==
Monthly Nalos reported to his emperor via [[hippocampus]] courier on the progress of the Council.
