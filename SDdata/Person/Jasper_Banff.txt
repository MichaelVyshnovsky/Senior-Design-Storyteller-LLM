'''Jasper Banff''' was a [[priest]] of [[Tempus]] who lived within the deity's temple located in the [[Cloud Peaks|Cloud Peak Mountains]].

==History==
When the [[avatar]] of Tempus appeared in far-off [[Battledale]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], Jasper and some of his fellow comrades heeded the call of their deity. They left the safety of their home in [[Amn]] for the [[Dalelands]] far to the east.

When they returned to their temple nearly a decade later, in the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], they found their brethren were slain and the holy site taken over by [[Gamaz]] and other [[monk]]s of the [[Order of the Dark Moon]]. Before he could escape from the worshipers of [[Shar]], Jasper was imprisoned behind a cage that was magically sealed and could only be opened by answering a riddle.
