Gretchen Titchwillow was a wandering halfling druid in the late 15 century DR.
Gretchen had a love for the tranquility of nature, and a dislike for busy cities.
A capable druid, Gretchen could wild shape into a number of animal forms, including badger, mouse, owl, and tortoise.
Gretchen found her vocation as a druid in a grove of willow trees near Waterdeep. She visited often, content to enjoy the silence of the woods. One day, the willow trees began speaking to her. They took her under their boughs, telling her stories and teaching her many willow-secrets over the course of a full year. At years end she was given a huge gem that allowed her to commune with the willows always, and was sent off to wander under the wise guidance of the trees. Eventually she was tasked with traveling to the city of Baldurs Gate to put down an evil presence and plant a willow tree.
