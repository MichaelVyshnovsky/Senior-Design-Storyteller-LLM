'''Saradreza Oussmtor''' was a high priestess of [[Eilistraee]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
  
==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Saradreza led a group of [[Sword Dancer of Eilistraee|Sword Dancers]] to join the battle for the liberation of [[Maerimydra]] and the banishment of the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]]. She saw this event as a chance to rally drow with no interest in remaining under the shackles of [[Lolth]]'s tyranny, and spread [[Church of Eilistraee#Dogma and Beliefs|Eilistraee's message]].

In [[Sporedome]], Saradreza and her fellows joined in the planning of the assault on Maerimydra.{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|11}}

The alliance would eventually succeed, banishing Graz'zt and freeing Maerimydra from its former occupants. After the victory, Saradreza and the other followers of Eilistraee settled within the city alongside many of the representatives of the other factions that had taken part in the battle. The dark dancers hoped to use the new position to heal the relationships between the drow of the [[Moonsea]] and the other races of the area.{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|48}}
