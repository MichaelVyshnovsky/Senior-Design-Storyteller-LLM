Saradreza Oussmtor was a high priestess of Eilistraee in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1486 DR, Saradreza led a group of Sword Dancers to join the battle for the liberation of Maerimydra and the banishment of the demon lord Grazzt. She saw this event as a chance to rally drow with no interest in remaining under the shackles of Lolths tyranny, and spread Eilistraees message.
In Sporedome, Saradreza and her fellows joined in the planning of the assault on Maerimydra.
The alliance would eventually succeed, banishing Grazzt and freeing Maerimydra from its former occupants. After the victory, Saradreza and the other followers of Eilistraee settled within the city alongside many of the representatives of the other factions that had taken part in the battle. The dark dancers hoped to use the new position to heal the relationships between the drow of the Moonsea and the other races of the area.
Saradreza was charismatic and warmhearted.
