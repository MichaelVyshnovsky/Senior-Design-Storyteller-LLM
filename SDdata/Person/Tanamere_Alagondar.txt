Lady Tanamere Alagondar was a royal scion of the Alagondar family in Neverwinter in the late 14 century DR.
Not much is known about Lady Tanamere Alagondar, but she lived sometime in the late 14 century DR following Nasher Alagondars ascension to King of Neverwinter. She was famous for wielding a dragon slayer longsword. It was said that she and two parties of adventurers fought and killed a green dragon named Azdraka that terrorized the High Road.
After being mortally wounded in the battle, her dying wish was that she and her fallen compatriots were buried with the corpse of Azdraka in a barrow near where the dragon fell. The barrow was created in the shape of a dragon in flight, and thus came to be known as Dragon Barrow.
According to legend, her magical longsword was buried with her.
