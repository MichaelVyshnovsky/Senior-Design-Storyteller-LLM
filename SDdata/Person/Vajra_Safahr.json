        "mainbody": "'''Vajra Safahr''' ({{Pronounce|VAJ|rah|_|sah|FAR|refs=}}) was the seventh [[Blackstaff]] of [[Waterdeep]], a title she ascended to in [[1479 DR]] when her mentor and lover, [[Samark Dhanzscul]], was killed. She was quite young when she became the Blackstaff, and was the youngest Blackstaff in Waterdeep's history.",
        "Description": "Vajra was diminutive, standing under {{SI|5|ft|c|long=yes}},{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230628202441/https://twitter.com/StevenESchend/status/1674134481840529408?cxt=HHwWgICzhZ-c3LsuAAAA|title=Howdy and welcome to a quick \"Steven clarifies something he wrote long ago\"|accessdate=28-06-2023| date=28-06-2023}} with olive skin, short black hair, and brown eyes. However, for a time, she had the ability to change her eye color, and the color switched depending on which of the six previous Blackstaffs controlled her body at any given time.",
        "Personality": "Vajra loved an intriguing [[arcane]] challenge. She was patient and known to pursue multiple plans at once, often requiring her to get her rivals to act in her best interests instead of their own. she soon learned to ignore those doubts and to dismiss the envies of those who were skeptical of her role.",
        "Activities": "She was focused on turning Waterdeep, and specifically her [[Blackstaff Academy]], into the center of [[magical]] study in [[Faerûn]]. She would wander the libraries and laboratories of [[Blackstaff Tower]] under magical silence so as not to disturb the other wizards, save for when she made a sudden appearance to aid them in their studies. She allowed her best students access to her own personal [[spellbook]], and was said to even allow some of them to add their own creations to it.",
        "Abilities": "Though having become the Blackstaff at a young age, Vajra was a skilled wizard, even capable of casting a lone spell while entirely [[paralyze|paralyzed]], and thus incapable of performing verbal incantations or hand-gestures. The effect of this spell was to fire forth a few rays of amber-colored energy from her eyes.",
        "Possessions": "[[File:Vajra signature work WoW.png|thumb|''Vajra's signature spellbook.'']]Vajra wielded the fabled [[Blackstaff (staff)|Blackstaff]], which was silver shod and towered over her head by several feet.\n\nShe was known to carry with her a wide array of magic items, including a ''[[brooch of shielding]]'', a ''[[ring of mind shielding]]'', a ''[[quill of memory]]'', a ''[[crown of scholarship]]'', and&mdash;when she needed them&mdash;a ''[[rod of rulership]]'', a ''[[staff of power]]'', a ''[[tentacle rod]]'', and a ''[[graystaff]]''. She wore a pair of [[enchanted]] boots of her own design known as the ''[[Pillars of Knowledge]]''. She was also said to possess a ''[[badge of the Watch]]'', which she would use to send the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] to interrupt potential crises before they turned into emergencies.\n\nDuring [[Laeral Silverhand]]'s tenure as [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep, the senior wizard was said to have bestowed upon Vajra two unique items of her own creation: the ''[[rod of favorable inclination]]'' and the ''[[seal of insight]]''.",
        "History": {
            "Early years": "Vajra was born in [[Tethyr]] to [[paladin]] [[Tamik al Safahr|Tamik yn Tamik al Safahr]] and [[Parama|Parama yr Manshaka]]. She had several older siblings, but she was the only one born with [[sorcerer|sorcerous]] talent. She grew up at [[Sheshyr House]] in Tethyr, the family home. \n\nWhen Vajra was fourteen, her father and her aunt died in defense of [[Darromar]], which was attacked by assassins. She turned away from sorcery and towards wizardry, since it was what was able to save Queen [[Cyriana (queen)|Cyriana]] and King [[Errilam (king)|Errilam]]. She was apprenticed to [[Mynda Gyrfalcon-Thann]] and Princess [[Zandra]], Court Vizeras of her homeland.\n\nShe came to Waterdeep in order to learn foreign magic for a brief time (a requirement for her course of study) around [[1476 DR]]. However, she fell in love with [[Samark Dhanzscul]], the Blackstaff, and remained in the city much longer than planned.",
            "Blackstaff": "[[File:Vajra idle.webp|thumb|Vajra Safahr and her ''[[Blackstaff (staff)|Blackstaff]]''|295x295px]]\nSamark made Vajra the heir to the Blackstaff, but he was killed by [[Khondar Naomal|Khondar]] and [[Centiv Naomal]] in [[1479 DR]] before she was fully prepared to assume the role of Blackstaff. Much of the power of the Blackstaff flowed into Vajra on Samark's death, but because she hadn't undergone the proper preparation, she was left semi-conscious and delusional.\n\nKhondar took Vajra to a secret lair beneath a house he had bought from the Open Lord [[Dagult Neverember]] and attempted to torture the secrets of the Blackstaff out of her. While traveling through the sewers on an unrelated task, [[Laraelra Harsard]] and [[Meloon Wardragon]] passed close to Khondar's hideout and heard Vajra's screams. Laraelra tracked down ownership of the house to [[Renaer Neverember]] and confronted him about the noises she had heard in the basement. Larealra, Meloon, Renaer, and several of his friends entered the residence and poked around in the basement, finding nothing unusual. While they were inside the house, Khondar and his son, in the guise of Samark, entered and confronted Renaer, showing him the deed to the home and kicking the group out of the residence. Laraelra knew something strange was going on, because \"Samark\" and Khondar were acting like old friends even though they were known to hate each other.\n\nRenaer and friends returned through the sewers and found the secret sublevel dungeon in which Vajra was imprisoned. They rescued Vajra and took her back to the Neverember mansion. When Khondar realized that Renaer had helped Vajra to escape, he framed Renaer and associates for Vajra's \"murder\". The [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] tracked Renaer and crew to the Neverember estate, and the group used a secret rooftop gate to travel to an old family mansion called [[Varadras]] outside Waterdeep. Vajra was still only occasionally lucid, as the consciousnesses of previous Blackstaffs fought for control of her mind. After a few days, they returned to Waterdeep and entered [[Blackstaff Tower]].\n\nIn the tower, she was tested by the previous Blackstaffs and was allowed to officially assume the role of Blackstaff. Vajra, now fully in control of her abilities, sent [[spectral hound]]s to stop Khondar from entering the tower. The hounds rent Khondar to shreds, and his animated [[skeleton]] was left as a warning to anyone foolish enough to attempt entry.\n\nAfter Khondar was defeated, Vajra consented to Renaer's plan to revive a group to replace the [[Moonstars]] with the stipulation that the group serve as her friends, not her servants.\n[[File:Vajra Safahr wow.png|thumb|''Vajra Safahr, holding the [[Blackstaff (staff)|Blackstaff]], a [[spellbook]], and wearing her arcane [[robe]]s.'']]\n\nLater, in the [[1491 DR|Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR]], Vajra was increasingly worried. The [[Lords of Waterdeep]] had just elected Laeral Silverhand as the new Open Lord, and Laeral's reputation and mere presence stirred up feelings of inadequacy in Vajra. She had also underestimated the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s threat and power, and [[Tiamat]]'s near triumph in her schemes. In an effort to prove herself, Vajra began to seek the meaning of the current year's name, the reason that [[giant]]s were becoming alarmingly more active in [[Faerûn]], and what was causing many [[Underdark]] races to seek refuge in [[Skullport]]."
