'''Daerigrol Halindcleave''' was a roving sharpener of [[knives]] and other tools in the town of [[Thunderstone]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Daerigrol typically carried around two [[sickle]]s and wore an ankle-length, leather [[apron]] that was quite dirty and scorched.

==Activities==
Almost every mid-morn and mid-afternoon, Daerigrol would wander the streets of Thunderstone growling old songs to himself, periodically clashing his sickles together above his head.

He typically charged a [[copper piece]] to have three [[knives]] sharpened or one "good one." This meant [[axe]]s, cook's [[cleaver]]s, face-razors, [[sword]]s, or other vital blades.

==Relationships==
Daerigrol had a number of sons that were skilled at installing and repairing [[hinge]]s or latches.
