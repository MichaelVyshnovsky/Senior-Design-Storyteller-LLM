Daerigrol Halindcleave was a roving sharpener of knives and other tools in the town of Thunderstone in the 14 century DR.
Daerigrol typically carried around two sickles and wore an ankle-length, leather apron that was quite dirty and scorched.
Almost every mid-morn and mid-afternoon, Daerigrol would wander the streets of Thunderstone growling old songs to himself, periodically clashing his sickles together above his head.
He typically charged a copper piece to have three knives sharpened or one "good one." This meant axes, cooks cleavers, face-razors, swords, or other vital blades.
Daerigrol had a number of sons that were skilled at installing and repairing hinges or latches.
