'''Vescaras Ammakyl''' was a [[half-elf]] [[Harper]] agent of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Vescaras was a noble of [[Waterdeep]]. He used his position in [[House Ammakyl]]'s business to run a network of spies.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1486}}, Vescaras learned from one of his spies of a smuggling ring trafficking [[gem]]s, [[weapon]]s, and people from [[Vaasa]] to [[Sembia]]. He and his fellow [[Khochen]] went on a mission to [[Westgate]] to collect clues about it. During the mission, they destroyed a caravan of [[shadovar]] trading with [[drow]] in the [[Dalelands]].

Afterward, they went to [[Waterdeep]] to make a report to [[Dahl Peredur]] and [[Tam Zawad]].

Later, he and Khochen were chosen to help, and survey, [[Mehen]] in his research into the missing [[Farideh]], whom Vescaras believed to be a [[shadovar]] agent.

==Relationships==
He disliked [[Dahl Peredur]], who believed this was due to his flirting with Vescaras's sister [[Jadzia Ammakyl]]. In fact, it was only due to Dahl's abrasive personality. Behind Dahlâ€™s back, he actually spoke fondly of the Oghmanite paladin, and considered him a valued asset to the Harpers, something he admitted to Farideh when Dahl had to leave Cormyr suddenly due to his family being endangered. His fellow agent Khochen once claimed to have had a sexual affair with him, but this ultimately turned out of be false.
