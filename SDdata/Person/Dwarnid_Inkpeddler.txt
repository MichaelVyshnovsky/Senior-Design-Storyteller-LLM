Dwarnid Inkpeddler was a dwarf tattooer in Skullport.
In his youth, Dwarnid was the personal slave of Zulkir Druxus Rhym. Noticing his latent talent in painting, Druxus encouraged the young dwarf and soon Dwarnid flourished. At this point, Druxus taught him the arts of the tattoo. Dwarnid in time became the most talented tattooer in Thay, creating wonderful artworks. Finally, he decided to escape and go to Skullport, which Dwarnid knew was too far for Druxuss agents. Here, he opened a tattoo shop and became famous in the city.
