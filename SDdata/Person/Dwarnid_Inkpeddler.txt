'''Dwarnid Inkpeddler''' was a [[dwarf]] tattooer in [[Skullport]].

==History==
In his youth, Dwarnid was the personal slave of [[Zulkir]] [[Druxus Rhym]]. Noticing his latent talent in painting, Druxus encouraged the young dwarf and soon Dwarnid flourished. At this point, Druxus taught him the arts of the tattoo. Dwarnid in time became the most talented tattooer in [[Thay]], creating wonderful artworks. Finally, he decided to escape and go to Skullport, which Dwarnid knew was too far for Druxus's agents. Here, he opened a tattoo shop and became famous in the city.
