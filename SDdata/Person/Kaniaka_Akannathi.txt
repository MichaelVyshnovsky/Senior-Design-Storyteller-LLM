Kaniaka Stormcrow Akannathi was an elderly matron of the Akannathi clan of goliaths that lived within Skytower Shelter in the Spine of the World mountains during the late 15 century DR.
In her elderly years Kaniaka was afflicted with blindness. She also had a keen sense of hearing, and could easily distinguish sounds made from individuals smaller than her fellow goliaths.
Kaniaka lived with her son Harad, and his husband Arn, the chieftain of their clan. Her words held great influence over the chief and their fellow clanmates.
She kept a domesticated crag cat within their familial cave, which served as a companion and protector.
