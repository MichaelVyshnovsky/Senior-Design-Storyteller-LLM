Fennor was a Reghedmen barbarian lout of Icewind Dale in the late 15 century DR.
He wore leathers and furs.
In the late 1490s DR, Fennor, Gurt, and Rond were in Targos loading supplies onto a dog-pulled sled when Fennor spotted the Uthgardt Elk tribe barbarian Holga Kilgore and, from her tribal markings mistook her for a member of the Reghedmen Tribe of the Elk.The Honor Among Thieves novelization appears to mistake the Uthgardt Elk tribe of the Savage Frontier with the Reghedmen Tribe of the Elk of Icewind Dale. This article presumes it is Fennor who is mistaken, as he seems like the sort who would be. Coincidentally, Fennor shares a name with a female member of the Uthgardt Elk tribe, suggesting they were intended to be the same. Rond knew Holga had been banished from her tribe from marrying a "Southlander", so Fennor said she should cover her markings to avoid angering the Tribe of the Elk. Soon, the gang were throwing mud and jeers at her, but Holga ignored them and left.
