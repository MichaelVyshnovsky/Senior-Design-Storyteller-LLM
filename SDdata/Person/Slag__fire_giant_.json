        "mainbody": "Slag was a fire giant of the Greypeak Mountains in the Savage Frontier who served in the army of Hellgate Keep in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nSlag was large and powerful, even among other fire giants.\nSlag owned a potion of cloud giant control, as well as a ring of spell turning. He had a pet gorgon named George. He carried boulders to throw at his enemies.\nSlag used his domineering nature to become a leader of all the giants who lived in the Greypeak Mountains. In his youth, he got into a disagreement with a young cloud giant, whose parents retaliated by throwing him out of his leadership position. Slag attempted to get revenge by forcing an alchemist into brewing a potion of cloud giant control for him, but the cloud giants left before he could use it.\nSlag also killed a young red dragon, from whose hoard he took a ring of spell turning. He defeated a party of human adventurers by throwing rocks at them, and claimed their gorgon, who became his pet named George.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Slag worked under the lich Pomerian (who in turn served Grintharke of Hellgate Keep). Slag fought without George in a clash between Pomerians army and forces from Loudwater led by Nanathlor Greysword, east of Loudwater. Later, when the Pipes of Doom had been stolen from Pomerian by some korreds, Slag was sent along with Lilliana, Dammek and Dammon to recover them from the Korreds camp."
