        "History": "Shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Korliss, a [[Waterdhavian]] [[wizard]], received a call of the new and growing Cult. She followed the calling to the [[Moonrise Towers]] in the [[Western Heartlands]], the Cult of the Absolute's heart, where she received the favor of the Cult's leader, [[Ketheric Thorm]] and became a [[True Soul]] through the Cult's [[illithid]] tadpole infection.\n\nNow seeing the Cult fully, Korliss was sent into the [[shadow-cursed lands]] to find the closest non-Absolutist heretics. However, she was unprotected from the grave dangers of the Cult and was pursued by ravenous [[shadow mastiff]]s to the edge of ruined [[Reithwin]]. She managed to scare the mastiffs and their alpha with fire and erected a field of magical light to keep them at bay. However, she still did not survive, dying of unslaked hunger and unquenched thirst."
