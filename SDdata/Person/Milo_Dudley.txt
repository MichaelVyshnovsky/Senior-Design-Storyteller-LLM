'''Milo Dudley''' was the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] bartender of the [[Dragon's Jaws]] tavern and inn in [[Suzail]].

==Personality==
Milo was a friend to everyone who came through the doors. He was very observant and quick to notice anyone in need, offering to help in anyway he could, often before a patron even had recognized the need&mdash;whether it was simply a refill or something more serious like a need for a bodyguard.
