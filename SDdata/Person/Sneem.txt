'''Sneem''' was a [[goblin]] sharp-eye that pledged his allegiance to the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''All this killin' ... for the Absolute!''|Sneem the Goblin}}

==Description==
Sneem had hay-colored hair he gathered in a ponytail, and his face bore smudges of war paint. The goblin wore roughly-stitched leathers and was armed with a goblin [[shortbow]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Sneem became indoctrinated into the worship of [[the Absolute]], and he joined the cultist army led by the [[drow]] [[paladin]] named [[Minthara Baenre]]. Along with other humanoids of the army, Sneem stayed in the ruined temple of [[Selûne]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] and later participated in an attack on the nearby [[Emerald Grove]] that sheltered a group of [[tiefling]] refugees from [[Elturel]]. The outcome of the conflict and Sneem's fate remained unrecorded.
