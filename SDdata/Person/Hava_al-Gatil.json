        "mainbody": "Caliph Hava al-Gatil was the ruler of Halwa in 1367 DR.\nHavas main interest appeared to be his memoirs. He spent the vast majority of his time cloistered with his favorite scribes, writing of his personal exploits from adventures past.\nThe caliph left the responsibility of running Halwa to his trusted Chief Vizier, Zarad.\nHava was a skilled askar in his youth. He enjoyed adventuring before the death of his father forced him to assume the role of caliph.\nHava had three daughters—Sikayah, Rajiyah, and Mahabbiyah—who were triplets nearing maturity in 1367."
