'''Emana Gortho''' was a cleric of [[Cyric]] in [[Hill's Edge]] in [[1359 DR]].

==Activities==
Emana managed the [[Fist of the Future]], a temple of Cyric. Secretly, she was gathering an army to conquer the city. Emana was experimenting with [[wild magic]] and sought any adventurers who'd escaped alive from the nearby [[Netherese]] ruins in the hopes of learning new [[spell]]s.

==Personality==
Emana was a careful plotter. She had recruited street thugs and fanatic zealots of Cyric for her army but was always careful to not alert the local [[Harpers]] and worshipers of [[Lliira]]. She dreamed of attracting the attention of her god and maybe even become his consort.
