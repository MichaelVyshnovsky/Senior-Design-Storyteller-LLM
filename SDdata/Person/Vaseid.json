        "mainbody": "'''Dawnmaster Vaseid''' was one of four devote leaders of the [[Rosymorn Monastery]] in the [[Western Heartlands]], who died before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] and the monastery's fall to the [[githyanki]] invaders.",
        "Description": "[[Dawnmaster]] Vaseid's stained glass depiction showed a humanoid with light skin, a full beard, and [[Lathanderian]] garb with a bright-colored [[cloak]]. The depiction was shown wielding a masterfully crafted ceremonial [[axe]].",
        "History": "Dawnmaster Vaseid was among four high-ranking members of the church who were interred in the Rosymorn Monastery sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The other three were [[Seed]], [[Stockhold]], and [[Welkinglory]]. All four had their sarcophagi arranged around the circular stained glass mosaic that bore their likeness while atop the pedestals laid each of their ceremonial weapons – masterfully crafted [[enchanted]] ''+1'' items that were among those great works that attracted pilgrims from across [[Faerûn]], Lathanderian and members of other faiths alike."
