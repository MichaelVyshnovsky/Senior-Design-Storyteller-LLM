        "mainbody": "'''Hank''', or '''the Ranger''', was a [[ranger]] and an [[adventurer]] from [[Earth]] and [[the Realm]] ([[Forgotten Realms|no relation]]). He was a companion of the [[monk]] [[Diana]], the [[barbarian]] [[Bobby]], the [[fighter]] [[Eric]], the [[wizard]] [[Presto]], and the [[rogue]] [[Sheila]].{{Cite comic/Saturday Morning Adventures 1}}",
        "Personality": "Hank was reliable and had good self-discipline. Being the oldest member of the band, he naturally took a leadership role because his friends respected his judgment, without him being bossy or arrogant. He feared that if he lost their respect, he would lose their friendship too.",
        "Possessions": "Hank fought with an ''[[energy bow]]'' that fired bolts of energy",
        "Abilities": "A talented ranger and archer, Hank could shoot at close range, in rapid succession, or multiple arrows at a time. He had a high constitution.",
        "History": {
            "The Victims of Tiamat": "Living long before the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], he was among a band of young adventurers who were all trying to find a way back to their distant home. However, it was said they were all slain horribly by [[Tiamat]], together with their miniature unicorn. By [[1369 DR]], the [[Adventurer Mart]] in [[Athkatla]], [[Amn]], displayed paintings of Hank and Bobby.",
            "The Grand Tour of the Realms": "In the 1360s DR, Hank and his friends journeyed to the town of [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]] in [[Faerûn]] so that Presto could ask the great sage [[Elminster]] to take him on as an apprentice. While drinking in the [[Old Skull Inn]], they spotted Elminster arrive. Though Presto had lost his nerve, Hank stood beside him to declare his friend's suitability.{{Cite comic/Forgotten Realms: The Grand Tour}}\n\nThus, Elminster whisked Presto away on a whirlwind tour of the Realms, and he came back traumatized and beaten and decided it best not to be his apprentice. Nevertheless, Presto had ideas for future adventures with his friends.\n\nAt this time, now in middle age, the ranger looked somewhat different. His hair was more ginger than blonde, and he wore a studded light-blue mantle, instead of his typical [[studded leather armor]]. He appeared to enjoy drinking [[ale]].",
            "The High Sun Games": "In the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Hank and his friends, all adults now and without unicorn, were one of six teams competing in the [[High Sun Games]] in the newly built [[Neverwinter arena|arena]] in [[Neverwinter]]. They evaded the [[displacer beast]] and even got to the center of the maze and safely inside the sanctuary cage at the end, winning that round. However, the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Sofina]] used the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'' above the arena soon after, so their fate is unknown.<ref>{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}<ref group=\"note\">After reaching the cage, the cartoon characters are not seen again. The ''beckoning death'' smoke later engulfs their position in the arena, but it is likely they left before this. Their purpose for competing is also unknown, but they may also have been trying to stop Forge and Sofina.",
            "Went to Waterdeep": "Aged only 15, Hank and friends were camping in a forest one night when the Dungeon Master arrived to check on them, soon abandoning them again with promises of finding snacks, such as the spicy fried [[potato]]es they liked. Hank grew annoyed at this and their lack of progress on getting back to Earth; he had a new plan, but the others were tired and were accepting their new life. But then [[drider]]s and [[darkmantle]]s ambushed them, and they fought their way out and into a mysterious ''[[portal]]'' that opened. It dumped them from a height into the streets of [[Waterdeep]], now in daytime and autumn. They were met by a girl who was pleased her spell had worked.\n{{Sectstub}}"
