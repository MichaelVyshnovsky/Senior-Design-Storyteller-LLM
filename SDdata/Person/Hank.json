        "mainbody": "Hank, or the Ranger, was a ranger and an adventurer from Earth and the Realm (no relation). He was a companion of the monk Diana, the barbarian Bobby, the fighter Eric, the wizard Presto, and the rogue Sheila.\nHank was reliable and had good self-discipline. Being the oldest member of the band, he naturally took a leadership role because his friends respected his judgment, without him being bossy or arrogant. He feared that if he lost their respect, he would lose their friendship too.\nHank fought with an energy bow that fired bolts of energy\nA talented ranger and archer, Hank could shoot at close range, in rapid succession, or multiple arrows at a time. He had a high constitution.\nHank and his friends were originally from Earth, and later in some place they called \"the Forgotten Realms\", evidently not knowing the difference. Aided by a mysterious entity known as the Dungeon Master, they battled monsters sent at them by the villainous Venger and tried to defeat him for good while struggling to find a way home.\nLiving long before the mid-to-late 14 century DR, he was among a band of young adventurers who were all trying to find a way back to their distant home. However, it was said they were all slain horribly by Tiamat, together with their miniature unicorn. By 1369 DR, the Adventurer Mart in Athkatla, Amn, displayed paintings of Hank and Bobby.\nIn the 1360s DR, Hank and his friends journeyed to the town of Shadowdale in Faer√ªn so that Presto could ask the great sage Elminster to take him on as an apprentice. While drinking in the Old Skull Inn, they spotted Elminster arrive. Though Presto had lost his nerve, Hank stood beside him to declare his friends suitability.\nThus, Elminster whisked Presto away on a whirlwind tour of the Realms, and he came back traumatized and beaten and decided it best not to be his apprentice. Nevertheless, Presto had ideas for future adventures with his friends.\nAt this time, now in middle age, the ranger looked somewhat different. His hair was more ginger than blonde, and he wore a studded light-blue mantle, instead of his typical studded leather armor. He appeared to enjoy drinking ale.\nIn the late 1490s DR, Hank and his friends, all adults now and without unicorn, were one of six teams competing in the High Sun Games in the newly built arena in Neverwinter. They evaded the displacer beast and even got to the center of the maze and safely inside the sanctuary cage at the end, winning that round. However, the Red Wizard of Thay Sofina used the horn of beckoning death above the arena soon after, so their fate is unknown.After reaching the cage, the cartoon characters are not seen again. The beckoning death smoke later engulfs their position in the arena, but it is likely they left before this. Their purpose for competing is also unknown, but they may also have been trying to stop Forge and Sofina.\nAged only 15, Hank and friends were camping in a forest one night when the Dungeon Master arrived to check on them, soon abandoning them again with promises of finding snacks, such as the spicy fried potatoes they liked. Hank grew annoyed at this and their lack of progress on getting back to Earth he had a new plan, but the others were tired and were accepting their new life. But then driders and darkmantles ambushed them, and they fought their way out and into a mysterious portal that opened. It dumped them from a height into the streets of Waterdeep, now in daytime and autumn. They were met by a girl who was pleased her spell had worked."
