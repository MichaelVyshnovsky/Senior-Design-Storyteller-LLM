'''Aesperus''', also known as the '''King in Copper''', was a [[lich]] [[wizard]] dwelling near the city of [[Hulburg]] on the [[Moonsea]]. Aesperus was known as "the King in Copper" because of the enchanted copper bands he wore on his body.

==History==
Aesperus was a human [[necromancer]] and former ruler of the short-lived kingdom of [[Thentur]] ''circa'' [[1050 DR]]. He was deposed in a rebellion led by [[Lathander]]'s clergy and his own kinsman, [[Rivan Hulmaster]]. Upon his death, Aesperus transformed into a [[lich]] and held dominion over the undead in eastern [[Thar]].

By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, a different tale of his origin had spread. This story claimed that Aesperus was a wizard fighting in defense of [[Hulburg]] in its earliest days. During a battle, he was knocked unconscious and buried alive beneath a pile of corpses. He was eventually interred in the [[Vault of the Dead (Hulburg)|Vault of the Dead]] beneath the city, as part of a mass burial. But Aesperus had survived, after a fashion: he had become a lich and was driven insane.

Aesperus dwelled in a subterranean chamber in the Vault for several centuries. By [[1368 DR]], he plotted his vengeance against the surface world, aiming to animate the thousands of corpses in the Vault and send the [[undead]] horde to march across the northern coast of the Moonsea and slaughter and destroy everything in their path. Instead, he would end up striking a bargain with [[Angar Hulmaster]] to ensure that the city's dead remained exclusively his domain, and in exchange he would bring no harm to Hulburg.

A century later, in [[1479 DR]], Aesperus was seeking his old [[spellbook]], the ''[[Infiernadex]]''.
