'''Cassandra Thann''' was the powerful matriarch of the [[Thann]] clan. She was the daughter of [[Zelphar Arunsun]], wife of [[Rhammas Thann]], and mother of [[Danilo Thann]].

==Personality==
Cassandra was intellectual and well-versed in politics and history of Waterdeep. She almost single-handedly rebuilt the family's fortunes after the family abandoned the slave trade. She was a skilled musician.

==Relationships==
Cassandra was the daughter of Zelphar Arunsun and his first wife, a [[half-elf]]. She kept her elven heritage a closely-guarded secret.

The matriarch had nine children with Rhammas - [[Dartek Thann|Dertek]], [[Eldaun Thann|Eldaun]], [[Randor Thann|Randor]], [[Zelphar Thann|Zelphar]], [[Harmon Thann|Harmon]], [[Ildaera Thann|Ildaera]], [[Synthea Thann|Synthea]], [[Danilo Thann|Danilo]], and [[Judith Thann|Judith]] - and thirteen grandchildren. [[Khelben Arunsun the Younger|Khelben "Ravencloak" Arunsun]] was her younger half-brother; she sometimes suspected but did not know that he had been replaced by [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]].
