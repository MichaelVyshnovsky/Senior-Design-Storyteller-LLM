Cassandra Thann was the powerful matriarch of the Thann clan. She was the daughter of Zelphar Arunsun, wife of Rhammas Thann, and mother of Danilo Thann.
Cassandra was intellectual and well-versed in politics and history of Waterdeep. She almost single-handedly rebuilt the familys fortunes after the family abandoned the slave trade. She was a skilled musician.
Cassandra was the daughter of Zelphar Arunsun and his first wife, a half-elf. She kept her elven heritage a closely-guarded secret.
The matriarch had nine children with Rhammas - Dertek, Eldaun, Randor, Zelphar, Harmon, Ildaera, Synthea, Danilo, and Judith - and thirteen grandchildren. Khelben "Ravencloak" Arunsun was her younger half-brother she sometimes suspected but did not know that he had been replaced by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun.
