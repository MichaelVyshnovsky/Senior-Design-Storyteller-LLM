        "mainbody": "Berun, once known as Kheil, was one of the Blades of the Old Man, an order of assassins from Sentinelspire. After his death, he was resurrected by Chereth, and retrained as a druid servant of Silvanus.\nIn  he was taller than most of the men in the steppes, with lean and hard features, seasoned with wind and sun. He had a single, long braid.\nPer Talieth, as related by Valmir, Kheil was not much of a talker. Talieth, too, confirmed that Kheil killed for coin and often for much less, as he enjoyed killing very much.\nAs Berun, he seemed seemed to present none of those qualities.\nKheil was a top-level assassin, the best amongst the Blades of the Old Man. While disabling Sauk and his assassins, Berun had cast summon swarm. He had also unlocked the powers of Eraellen after his master, Chereth, revived him. Even as Kheil, Berun was quite cognizant of eastern spices.\nBerun had a rune-carved bow of yew, and one of his arrows was threaded with poisonous blue hemlock thread. After the Jalesh Rudra of 1374 DR, he also carried a stone hammer, likely enchanted, and a starstone shedding a blue-green glow.\nKheil was originally an orphan from Elversult before Alaodin took him in and trained him as an assassin. While in Sentinelspire, Kheil became close with the hunter Sauk, and became a lover of the Old Mans daughter, Lady Talieth. Per Sauk, Kheil was used for sending a message with the kill, rather than attempting a stealthy slaying, for he was a cold-blooded killer. Talieth confirmed this, attesting to Kheils bloodthirst. and had feelings for him even a decade later.\nOn Mirtul 2 of , Kheil was sent to slay Chereth of the Masters of the Yuirwood\nThe two parted ways after , after a fight against raiders from the Ganathwood. These raiders had struck a farm, killing all but a boy, Lewan, who became Beruns apprentice in turn. The leader of the party was his old friend, Sauk, who sought his help in slaying the Old Man of the Mountain, lying to Berun that his master, Chereth, was being tortured by Alaodin. Though Berun was sympathetic to their plight, he wouldve preferred to come back in force with a number of druids. That was a nonstarter for the assassins, who valued the secrecy of their home. They rebuffed his offer to accompany them if they released Lewan, preferring to keep him as a captive for leverage.\nBerun eventually found an opportunity to escape when Sauk split his party, looking to hunt some yaqubi he expected to carry gold from a recent sale. While buried under the earth and unconscious, he had a vision of his master, Chereth, calling for his help. The earth released him in time for the Jalesh Rudra of Tarsakh 19 he regained some of his strength with the aid of Perch. Lebeth came to him in the evening, and they performed the ceremony of the Jalesh Rudra together. She left him supplies in the morning, including an enchanted stone hammer and a new starstone.\nHe immediately departed for Sentinelspire, hoping to rescue Chereth and Lewan. He arrived on Tarsakh 25, and made his way through a number of assassins.> Once inside, managed to fight off Sauk before killoren stopped him in behalf of the Old Man of the Mountain. When he entered the Tower of the Sun, he met with his old master, Chereth, who had been impersonating Alaodin. Chereth intended the destruction of civilization across Faer√ªn with a supervolcanic explosion in Sentinelspire, only needing yet Eraellen to do this. Unable to abide this, Berun chose to oppose his old master one final time. The two fought for a long time, but it was only the timely interventions of Sauk, Talieth, and Lewan that stopped Chereth, at the cost of Beruns life."
