Bort was a barbarian gnoll and slave of Baeloth Barrityl.
Unlike most gnolls, Bort was neither chaotic nor evil, but was instead lawful and neutrally aligned. His adventuring party consisted of several of the goodly races, from halflings to humans. The barbarian fought with a halberd, and wore leather armor. He also carried a potion of healing.
Bort and his party were taken from a "shabby saloon" to the Black Pits. They were killed by the Champion of Baeloths Pits and their party in the Black Pits arena.
