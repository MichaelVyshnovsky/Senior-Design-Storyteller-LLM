Phelandern Ghemelt was the Magister for four months in .
He was described as "darkly handsome".
Phelandern sneered much, and he was fond of sarcasm.
After being offered the office of the Magister, Phelandern decided to try and manipulate other factions of mages, such as the Red Wizards of Thay, the Arcane Brotherhood, or the Twisted Rune, into stalemates, so they could not focus their force on him. He also had plans to draw them into an attack on Halruaa, which he hoped to observe or even use as cover to steal some of their magic. He also coveted a number of fabled orbs of power, supposedly owned by Alair Nalabukhar, of the Calishite Nalabukharn family.
Before he could get much of his schemes into motion, however, he was overwhelmed by challengers from Calimshan and Thay, destroying first his tower in wave attacks, and then a number of manors he seized. He was finally torn apart over the Shining Sea, near an island home of his, by Veldribold of Calimport, who died too soon after to inherit the mantle of the Magister.
Phelandern actually knew only rumors of the orbs of power he coveted.
