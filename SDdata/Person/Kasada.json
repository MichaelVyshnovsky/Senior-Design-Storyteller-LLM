With this sacred symbol, he ascended the throne as the second emperor and ushered in a new era. Afraid to name the new age after himself, Kasada ordained that the new time period would be called the era of [[Koyo]].\n\nThe southern tribes of [[korobokuru]] supported Kasada's rule, but there was still conflict against the northern korobokru tibes.\n\nThe descendants of Kasada maintained the dynasty through at least two eras, including the era of [[Kuni]]. This was the {{YearlinkName|-417}}."
