        "Description": "Glomp had orange skin and orange eyes. He was dressed in crude [[leather armor]] and a leather [[helmet]].",
        "Possessions": "Some of the more notable loot in Glomp's possessions included [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[greatsword]], [[greatclub]], [[war pick]], and [[longbow]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a raiding gang of the Absolute cultists made home in the ruined temple to Selûne. When the order came from the Absolute to move to the [[Moonrise Towers]] and later – to march for [[Baldur's Gate]], Glomp the Looter was commanded to stay behind to collect anything of value left behind by the cultist army. The goblin was a greedy creature and was willing to sell and trade for any of the loot he collected from the Shattered Sanctum."
