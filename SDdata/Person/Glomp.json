When the order came from the Absolute to move to the Moonrise Towers and later – to march for Baldurs Gate, Glomp the Looter was commanded to stay behind to collect anything of value left behind by the cultist army. The goblin was a greedy creature and was willing to sell and trade for any of the loot he collected from the Shattered Sanctum."
