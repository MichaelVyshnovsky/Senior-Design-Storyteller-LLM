==History==
Sometime around the [[Darkening]], Laerion'vyr controlled a sizable group of drow, including [[drider]]s, lesser priestesses, a [[draegloth]] bodyguard, and a cadre of ritualists led by [[Vur'din]] that summoned a number of [[slaad]]i allies, including the powerful [[gray slaad]] [[Il'tharis the Terrible]]. The drow had a contentious relationship with a nearby group of subterranean [[lizardfolk]], and their presence may have been discovered by [[adventurer]]s that plumbed the adjacent [[Netherese tomb (Stonelands)|Netherese tomb]] and confronting the [[red dragon]] [[Daeronnax]].
