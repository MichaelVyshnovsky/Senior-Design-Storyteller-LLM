'''Windove''' was a powerful white [[horse|stallion]] named after his speed by [[Akabar Bel Akash]] ''circa'' [[1357 DR]].

==History==
In [[1357 DR]], Akabar Bel Akash purchased Windove, [[Lightning (horse)|Lightning]], [[Lady Killer]], and [[High Roll (pony)|High Roll]] from [[Dimswart Manor]] in [[Cormyr]].

Windove loyally served Akabar, taking him to [[Suzail]], the [[Shadow Gap]], [[Shadowdale]], and [[Yulash]], where the heroes were forced to abandon their mounts while pursuing the Abomination of [[Moander]] through [[Cormanthor]].
