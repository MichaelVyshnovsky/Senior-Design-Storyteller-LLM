Tor Millows was a male human on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR. He was a priest of Ilmater.
In 1374 DR, Tor went to Fort Locke to heal people who were robbed by bandits. However, he was robbed and his symbol of Ilmater was taken away. He managed to get to the fort, but requested the Kalach-Cha to find and bring the symbol back. The symbol was located inside the bandits camp. If retrieved, Tor would comment on the Kalach-Chas approach on dealing with the bandit leader. Rgardless, Torn was able to heal the Kalach-Cha and their companions.
