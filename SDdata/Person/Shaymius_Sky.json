        "mainbody": "Shaymius Sky was an accomplished adventurer and later swordmaster to the noble Thann family of Waterdeep.\nShaymius was mostly blind by 1361 DR.\nAfter Shaymius left his adventuring life, Lady Cassandra Thann was eager to have Shaymius train her firstborn son so he might achieve the same glories. Unfortunately, Shaymius often went out to get drunk to relive his past adventures. He often brawled, frequently landing himself in a cell. It became too expensive to pay his bail every time.\nDanilo Thann, apparently quite fond of him, persuaded his mother to have him run a horse stable and guesthouse outside of the city of Waterdeep. He also convinced Shaymius to to see it as a noble retirement rather than banishment."
