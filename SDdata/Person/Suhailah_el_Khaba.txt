'''Suhailah el Khaba''', better known as '''The Black Lamia''', was an infamous mercenary from the city of [[Calimport]] sometime before the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Suhailah el Khaba's career ended mysteriously, some years before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}. There were many unreliable stories about the Black Lamia's last adventure. Some said she was locked away in the depths of the earth after murdering a vengeful [[mage]]'s niece, while others repeated a more romantic story of how Suhailah fell in love with a noble from the land of the [[Red Wizards]] – [[Thay]], and later was forced into hiding. Even though her final fate remained unrecorded, Suhailah el Khaba was gone, leaving behind numerous various items she used in her career. All ended up scattered across [[Faerûn]] by [[1312 DR]], including a powerful [[enchanted]] [[throwing dagger]] called ''[[Lamia's Tongue]]''.
