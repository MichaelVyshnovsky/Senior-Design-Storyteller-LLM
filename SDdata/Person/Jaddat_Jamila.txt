Jaddat Jamila was the human ruler of Madinat al-Mumin in the Steaming Isles in 1367 DR.
Jaddat Jamila was an aged woman. She was very lean and had gray hair. Jaddat never wore jewelry of any kind, believing it to be a sign of vanity.
She spent most of her time discussing town matters with citizens since Madinat al-Mumin did not have a formal court.
Jaddat owned a mahogany cane that she used as a walking aid.
Jaddat was a direct descendant of Jamila bint-Susan the Virtuous. She was married to Jadd Alai.
