His duty was to act as a brewer and cook for both the monastery and the Guest House. Secretly, he was also a member of the Cult of Howling Hatred.\nGlavel was one of the cultists who infiltrated the monastery in 1491 DR. When the adventurers arrived at the monastery, they confronted Glavel.\nGlavel was the lover of Olara, a fellow cultist.\nGlavel at heart was a selfish sociopath. He joined the Howling Hatred only because they encouraged his hobbies. Glavel was a very good liar and would quickly change sides if his life was in danger."
