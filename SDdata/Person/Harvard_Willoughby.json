He was a snappy dresser, wearing a mages robe, a wide-brimmed hat, and a monocle.\nIn the , Harvard Willoughby hosted a stand-up comedy competition called the \"Laff Riot.\" Together with his young son, Belford Willoughby, who was Harvards less-than-enthused announcer, the duo occupied Elfsongs side room with a stage and a piano. Harvard would challenge guests to a stand-up competition of jokes in which the winner would be the one who causes the most cheering and applause. Harvard was the usual winner of the show, as the public seemed to enjoy the mans copious puns. He joked about drow comedian who used Tashas hideous laughter on the attendees and that drow didnt need torches as they had darkvision. His other jokes included references to his wife who cheated on him with a mage who could cast mage hand all night long and that she ran away from him with a fiend, \"fiend-zoning\" the man. Harvard discouraged jokes about religion and appreciated good porcine humor."
