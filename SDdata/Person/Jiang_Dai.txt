'''Jiang Dai''' was a [[ghost]]ly [[kensai]] lieutenant who served [[Nan Kung Chi]] in the [[Crypt of Durkon]] in [[Kara-Tur]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Dai wore a sturdy set of [[enchanted]] ''+2'' [[leather armor]] and wielded magic ''+1'' [[wakizashi]] and a ''+1'' [[katana]].

==History==
Jiang Dai died many moons before the late 14{{th}} century DR. In life, he was a [[human]] kensai warrior and one of six trusted lieutenants who served Nan Kung Chi. He continued to do the same long after death. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the crypt faced an [[illithid]] incursion led by [[Goxxa]] the [[alhoon]]. The mind flayers consumed ancient preserved minds of the crypt's dead and sought the ''[[Claw of the Black Leopard]]''. At the same time, a [[vampire]] [[thief]] named [[Hexxat]] arrived at the tomb on the behest of her master [[Larloch]], who sought the tomb's magical treasure. A ghostly [[monk]] named [[Ki Chin Sang]] stood guard of Nan Kung Chi's tomb and demanded anyone seeking entrance to defeat six of Nan Kung Chi's trusted undead lieutenants who all were interred together. When Hexxat and her allies challenged the lieutenants to battle, Jiang Dai was joined by [[Weimin Min]], [[Yi Niu]], [[Borok-Tosst]], and [[Ming-hua Dai]], and, presumably, was defeated.
