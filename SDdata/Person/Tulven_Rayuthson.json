        "Personality": "He was said to be proud and sadistic.",
        "History": "Tulven became Warlord in the {{YearlinkName|982}}, upon the death of his father, Warlord [[Rayuth]]. He was a sufficiently despicable ruler that the likes of War Captain [[Aeroth of Silverymoon|Aeroth]], a hero and champion of the city, left Silverymoon to live elsewhere.\n\nBecause of his abuses of power, in the {{YearlinkName|990}}, Tulven was stripped of his position by the [[High Mage (Silverymoon)|High Mage]] of Silverymoon, [[Nunivytt Threskaal]]. In order to prevent a similar incident from occurring, Nunivytt declared that the position of Warlord would only be granted during times of great need."
