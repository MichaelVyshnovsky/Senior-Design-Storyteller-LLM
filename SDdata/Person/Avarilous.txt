In the , Avarilous acted as an agent of Ulgarth. In Tharkar, he disrupted plots around a treaty between Doegan and Konigheim, in order to maintain a political stalemate in the Five Kingdoms.
In Kythorn of the , Avarilous was in the Anauroch desert. He had accepted a job from the Bedine Sheik Omar Lhassa Bin-Daar to disrupt Zhentarim excavation of ruins around Hlondath, and prevent them from allying with the newly returned Shadovar.
Avarilous was well known enough that Sheik Bin-Daar sought him out specifically. The sheik knew him as a "dealer in information and stolen goods," who "travels the lands, meddling in the affairs of people whom he does not know," and that Avarilous might not be his real name.
Sheik Bin-Daar knew that Avarilous was not from Calimport as claimed. He had heard of exploits from "Icewind Dale to the jungles of Chult, from the Utter East to the Sword Coast," and that Avarilous had worked for "the fallen Azoun of Cormyr, for the rulers of far Ulgarth, and for the Red Wizards of Thay."
