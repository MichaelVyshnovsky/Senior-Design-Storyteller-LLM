'''Avarilous''' was a mercenary spy who posed as a merchant and was active across [[Faerûn]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Avarilous acted as an agent of [[Ulgarth]]. In [[Tharkar]], he disrupted plots around a treaty between [[Doegan]] and [[Konigheim]], in order to maintain a political stalemate in the [[Five Kingdoms]].

In [[Kythorn]] of the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, Avarilous was in the [[Anauroch]] desert. He had accepted a job from the [[Bedine]] Sheik [[Omar Lhassa Bin-Daar]] to disrupt [[Zhentarim]] excavation of ruins around [[Hlondath]], and prevent them from allying with the newly returned [[Shadovar]].

==Rumors==
Avarilous was well known enough that Sheik Bin-Daar sought him out specifically. The sheik knew him as a "dealer in information and stolen goods," who "travels the lands, meddling in the affairs of people whom he does not know," and that Avarilous might not be his real name.

Sheik Bin-Daar knew that Avarilous was not from [[Calimport]] as claimed. He had heard of exploits from "[[Icewind Dale]] to the jungles of [[Chult]], from the [[Utter East]] to the [[Sword Coast]]," and that Avarilous had worked for "the fallen [[Azoun IV|Azoun]] of [[Cormyr]], for the rulers of far Ulgarth, and for the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]]."
