'''Pretti''' was a [[cat]] that lived in [[Arabel]] with its person during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When the [[Faerûnian pantheon|gods of the Realms]] took [[avatar|mortal form]] on [[Faerûn]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the eccentric old man that lived with Pretti fervently told everyone the cat was the embodiment of [[Oghma]], the Lord of All Knowledge. While no one in town believed the old fool, Pretti's opinion on the matter was unknown.
