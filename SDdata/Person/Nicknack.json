        "mainbody": "'''Nicknack''' was an [[ettin]] [[druid]] with two identical heads.",
        "Description": "Although below average height for an ettin at {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}}, Nicknack looked strong and intimidating. Unusually for his kind, his two heads looked identical.\n\nNicknack was well-groomed: his skin was rosy pink, he had cleanly manicured fingernails, and his hair was tidily curled and combed. He generally wore a brown [[robe]] with [[sandal]]s.",
        "Personality": "While his heads looked identical, the two had distinct personalities, especially after the effects of a ''[[helm of opposite alignment]]'', which rendered Nick [[lawful good]] while Nack remained [[chaotic evil]]. Even after fighting off the effects of the ''helm'' and gaining a shared [[neutral]] alignment, Nick retained a lawful bent, while Nack leaned somewhat chaotic.",
        "Abilities": "In his capability as a druid, Nicknack usually used the spells ''[[animal friendship]]'', ''[[augury]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[entangle]]'', ''[[goodberry]]'', ''[[locate animals or plants]]'', and ''[[speak with animals]]''.",
        "Possessions": "On his right head, Nicknack wore an expended [[silver]] ''helm of opposite alignment'', which was styled like a [[dragon]]'s skull. On his left, he wore a used-up ''[[gem of insight]]'', which appeared as a large human-fist-sized [[emerald]], embedded in a golden [[circlet]]. He wielded a pair of gigantic [[scimitar]]s.\n\nNicknack also had a ''[[figurine of wondrous power]]'', which turned into a white [[marble]] [[elephant]] named [[Raj]].",
        "History": "At a young age, Nicknack conquered an [[orc]] tribe by slaying its chieftain. Over the next five years of his life, he led his subjects on a reign of terror over the region surrounding the orcs' tribal home. His campaign came to an end when a more powerful [[human]] army destroyed the tribe, leading Nicknack to wander [[Faerûn]] as a lone [[adventurer]].\n\nOn one of his adventures, Nicknack slew a [[red dragon]]. Looking through the dragon's hoard of treasure, he unwittingly donned a ''helm of opposite alignment'', which, coupled with the ettin's unusual symmetry and the ''gem of insight'' he happened to be holding at the time, caused the ettin's heads to have opposing alignments. This division between good and evil nearly drove Nicknack to madness, and as the ettin was flailing around in a forest, he was discovered by a druid named [[Gallan]].\n\nWith Gallan's help, Nicknack was able to restore balance between his heads, shifting to a neutral alignment. The druid, sensing the ettin's intelligence and wisdom, proceeded to teach Nicknack the principles of the druidic faith, as well as reading and writing. With his newfound skills, Nicknack became an avid reader of books about philosophy, religion, and morality.\n\nAs his skills as a druid and philosopher grew, Nicknack converted to the [[Silvanus|Silvanite]] faith. When his mentor died, the ettin took to wandering Faerûn once more. In this chapter of his travels, he came into the possession of a marble elephant ''figurine of wondrous power'', which became his mount of choice.\n\nAt some point, Nicknack became an advisor to the mayor of [[Ravens Bluff]], [[Charles Oliver O'Kane]]."
