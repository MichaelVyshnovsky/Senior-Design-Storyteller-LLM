        "mainbody": "'''Whiptail''' was a [[lizardfolk]] member of the [[Muckmarsh]] tribe in [[Twilight Marsh]] near [[Phlan]] in [[1489 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Whiptail was very resolute but believed heavily in superstitions. She spoke to her weapons, especially her chosen [[dagger]]. She would not explain to anyone why that weapon was so important to her.",
        "History": "In 1489 DR, Whiptail acted as an escort for her chieftain [[Bogclaw]] and shaman [[Scalesneer]] to a meeting with adventurers. However, they were attacked by a group of [[will-o'-wisp]]s and Whiptail was one of the few survivors. She was chosen to guide the adventurers to the lair of [[Throstulgrael]]."
