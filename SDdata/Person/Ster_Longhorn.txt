'''Ster Longhorn''' was a [[minotaur]] chieftain inside [[Undermountain]] in [[1375 DR]].

==Activities==
Ster lead his tribe inside the Maze level of the dungeon. He was allied with the [[drow]] of [[House Tanor'Thal]] in their war with the [[doppelganger]]s. He led his tribe in fishing, herding [[roth√©]], and occasionally mining raw crystals from a nearby glowing cave.

==History==
Ster gained control of the tribe after his father became weak. From that point, however, he was busy defending his tribe against all aggressors.

==Personality==
Ster was smarter than most of his fellows, despite being cruel and murderous like them. He believed he had to prove himself worthy of the title of chieftain by fighting strong opponents. Ster used his magic ''[[Kyo crystal]]s'' only if the enemy first used magic powers.
