Eight years later in the ''The Book of Chaos'', part of the ''[[Planes of Chaos (boxed set)|Planes of Chaos]]'' boxset, Utgard-Loki was identified as being a [[mountain giant]]. However, the later Realms source ''[[Three Coins in a Well]]'' refers to Utgard-Loki as being both a son of Thrym (god of frost giants) and as being the uncle to a frost giant jarl, which would indicate that he himself is a frost giant. Though organized play content is considered a lower tier of canon, it being a Realms source takes precedence, thus Utgard-Loki is considered to be a frost giant.

'''Utgard-Loki''' was the [[frost giant]] ruler of [[Jotunheim]]'s major city of [[Utgard]],{{Cite dragon/110/For Better or Norse: I|22}}{{Cite dragon/90/Plane Facts on Gladsheim|37}}<ref group="note" name="race" /> a son of the [[Giant pantheon|giant god]] [[Thrym]], and one of the most powerful giant spellcasters in that layer of [[Ysgard]].

==Activities==
Utgard-Loki kept the council of jarls that ruled under him in Utgard in-line through a combination of sheer force of will. and cunning wit, rather than the tactic of mere brute strength that many other frost giants relied upon. Through his prowess as both a [[cleric]] and [[illusionist]], he used a combination of [[divine magic|divine]] and [[arcane magic]] to protect his city, making it heavily defended and camouflaged.

==Relationships==
Among the philosophical planar factions, Utgard-Loki was aligned with the [[Fated]].

==History==
Utgard-Loki's magical prowess was so great that over the years he had on more than one occasion beaten members of the [[Norse pantheon]] in conflicts,{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|3}} one of whom was the frost giant [[Habrok Icecaster]], who would come to sit as one of his many jarls in Utgard.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|16-17}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] on the world of [[Toril]] traveled to Ysgard in search of the legendary [[Well of Mimir]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2}} While passing through the layer of Jotunheim they encountered Utgard-Loki's nephew Habrok, out hunting with six friends, who told them of his uncle's power and greatness. They also encountered [[Torheim]], a [[proxy]] of the Norse god Thor, who expressed wanting their help in a later scheme he was devising to utterly embarrass Utgard-Loki<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|23}} and offered them a coin to give to the Well of Mimir's guardian if they could slay one of Utgard-Loki's nephews.
