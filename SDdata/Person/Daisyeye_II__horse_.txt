Daisyeye II was a horse owned by Giogioni Wyvernspur of Immersea, briefly borrowed by a hero-sellsword Alias.
After Daisyeye IIs namesake horse was devoured by an ancient red dragon Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco, Giogioni Wyvernspur acquired the replacement mare on his way from Teziir to Westgate. Giogi came to a habit of often talking to his new friend Daisyeye II. On his approach to Westgate, the young Wyvernspur witnessed his old "friend", dragon Mist, fly through a gate in the sky and later perish in an immense explosion in her battle with the Abomination of Moander.
The explosion scared Daisyeye II and she galloped down the road only to run into Alias. The hero borrowed Daisyeye II from Giogi, the young Wyvernspur did not protest much in fear of the woman who almost killed him once. The nobleman sheepishly asked alias to drop the horse off at the Jolly Warrior Inn, she promised him she would. And she did. Daisyeye II was reunited with her master and later accompanied him to his home in Immersea.
