}}'''Daisyeye II''' was a [[horse]] owned by [[Giogioni Wyvernspur]] of [[Immersea]], briefly borrowed by a hero-sellsword [[Alias]].

{{quote|''"Now this," he informed the horse he now rode, Daisyeye II, "has been a much more pleasant experience than my last trip on horseback. That ended, you see, with the death of your namesake, the first [[Daisyeye (horse)|Daisyeye]], followed by a singularly unpleasant interview with a [[dragon]] - an incident that will stick in my mind as long as, if not longer than, the nasty affair of losing [[Dorath Wyvernspur|Aunt Dorath]]'s pet [[land urchin]]."''|Giogioni Wyvernspur}}

==History==
After Daisyeye II's namesake horse was devoured by an ancient [[red dragon]] [[Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco]], Giogioni Wyvernspur acquired the replacement mare on his way from [[Teziir]] to [[Westgate]]. Giogi came to a habit of often talking to his new friend Daisyeye II. On his approach to Westgate, the young Wyvernspur witnessed his old "friend", dragon Mist, fly through a ''gate'' in the sky and later perish in an immense explosion in her battle with the Abomination of [[Moander]].

The explosion scared Daisyeye II and she galloped down the road only to run into [[Alias]]. The hero borrowed Daisyeye II from Giogi, the young Wyvernspur did not protest much in fear of the woman who almost killed him once. The nobleman sheepishly asked alias to drop the horse off at the [[Jolly Warrior Inn]], she promised him she would. And she did. Daisyeye II was reunited with her master and later accompanied him to his home in Immersea.
