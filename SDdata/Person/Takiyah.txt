Takiyah was a Shadow Druid who lived in the Cloak Wood forest during the mid–14 century DR.
He believed that most people who merely appreciated nature without taking up arms to protect it from intruders were naive and deserved to be "purged" from Faerûn.
He was a contemporary of the druid Faldorn, both of whom served under archdruid Amarande.
