        "mainbody": "Gondegal himself was never captured. His condition and whereabouts remained a mystery in the Realms, but remained much discussed in taverns through the mid-1350s to the mid-1360s DR, usually when caravans went missing anywhere from High Dale to as far as [[Impiltur]] or when brigands seemed more active than normal. Many assumed he still lived, and linked all kinds of actions to him. A popular story ''circa'' [[1356 DR]] was that he survived as an outlaw king, holding court in the wilderness some place with twenty-or-so zealously loyal followers. This Gondegal was thought to be careful and ruthless, and of course killing all witnesses to his attacks to stop word about him spreading.\n\nWhen small yet dangerous monsters were apparently being regularly unleashed to plague the countryside and cities of Cormyr, rumor mills naturally supposed it was the work of a mage companion of Gondegal, among others. The worst, and wildest, supposed an alliance of [[Zhentil Keep]] and [[Thay]] working to weaken Cormyr and hiring Gondegal's outlaw band to act as bodyguards for their wizards.{{Cite polyhedron/68/The Everwinking Eye: Goodbye, Mulmaster|28}}\n\nIn one odd incident in the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, a large but dilapidated ship entering the [[Lake of Dragons]] was attacked by pirates while in the Neck. When its captain emerged to fight, one of the pirates declared him to be Gondegal himself, momentarily halting the battle with everyone's surprise. That the man had hair as red as a [[dwarf]]'s, rather than Gondegal's well-known gray, and promptly fled by diving overboard rather than fighting mattered not a whit to the tale. The pirates overwhelmed the sailors two-to-one, captured the sailors, and seized a cargo of goblin-made [[sword]]s and other weapons; since goblins fought in Gondegal's army, this was also seen as evidence of the Lost King equipping a new army. Questioned by the pirates, some of the sailors claimed they knew the captain was Gondegal, though not where he was based, but that he was going to [[Westgate]]. They even threw in a story of a great treasure to fund his new army, and added the first officer was in the captain's trust and knew its location. The first officer was also questioned, but he too escaped, taking any truth with him.\n\nThrough the mid-to-late 1360s DR, rumors told of small groups still loyal to Gondegal or sympathetic to his cause, usually placing them where no such group was to be found. Yet there was one—Lord Vorik Aris survived the war without blame and in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, plotted a new rebellion, believing he could avoid Gondegal's errors. They were defeated by adventurers and the [[ghost]]s of the Starburst Swords, who'd been barred from the afterlife by [[Torm]], god of duty, but now had their chance for redemption. Meanwhile, the cooperation of [[kobold]]s and [[troglodytes]] on ambushes in the [[Hullack Forest]], who were not usually known to work together, was attributed to some charismatic, outsider; naturally, Gondegal was put forward as the most likely candidate for his hypothetical leader.<ref> During the [[abraxus affair]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, wild rumors placed Gondegal in Marsember and High Horn and behind the attack on Azoun, but by now such tales were ridiculed.<ref> Even the black king piece in the game of [[chess (game)|chess]] was sometimes termed \"Gondegal\".<ref>\n\nIn the late 1370s DR, a gang of brigands called the [[Sons of Gondegal]] and carrying his wolf's-head standard had started harassing caravans and farms between Arabel and the [[Shadow Gap]]. They'd escaped capture by [[1379 DR]] and it's unknown what connection they had to their namesake.{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|48,51}}\n\n===Into the Mists===\n[[File:Gondegal 2.png|thumb|250px|''A portrait of Gondegal, as he was adventuring in the Demiplane of Dread.'']]\nBut Gondegal's ultimate fate was very different to what people believed. There are two versions. In one, he eventually came into the [[Buried Realms]] of the [[Underdark]] beneath [[Anauroch]] and there stumbled between two [[menhir|standing stones]] (possibly a [[portal]]) wreathed in mist. In the other, after many days of flight from his pursuers, he stumbled alone into an area of marsh under a thick fog.While ''Anauroch'' has Gondegal pass between two menhirs in the Underdark, ''Realm of Terror'' only has him go into thick fog somewhere, while ''Champions of the Mist'' adds the detail of a marsh, making these accounts appear contradictory. The [[mist dragon]] [[Thalagyrt]], \"Old Lord Memory\", was reputed to know the true fate of Gondegal.<ref>{{Cite dragon/255/Wyrms of the North: Thalagyrt|94}}<ref>{{ Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Thalagyrt, \"Old Lord Memory\"}} And the paladin Knightengale tracked him down—perhaps the only person to do so—and suffered the same fate, as she too was swallowed by the Mists. She continued to hunt Gondegal.\n\nGondegal found himself in the realm of Falkovnia. Initially, he was attracted to the military dictatorship of Lord Vlad Drakov—himself also a mercenary warlord transplanted here from [[Krynn|another world]]<ref>—finding it familiar and well suited. Although he did not like Drakov's horrific punishments, Gondegal understood its ruler's adherence to military discipline. But, as he learned more, he eventually realized the evil in the lands and grew sickened and wearied of its cruel oppression and taint. So he departed to explore this new land and make his fortune, having various adventures along the way. By the year 735 on the Barovian calendar, he was still surviving in Ravenloft on his wits and courage, not magic, and he'd suffered no ill effects from being on the Demiplane of Dread.\n\nBut Gondegal later returned to Falkovnia, older and wiser now, intent on being a liberator rather than a conqueror. He sought to unite the people under him, depose Drakov, and seize control of Falkovnia. Realizing his haste had been his undoing in Cormyr, Gondegal was slow and careful this time. Yet again he failed. Drakov's forces crushed his coup in the cradle, broke his organization, and destroyed his allies. But once again Gondegal escaped capture and was hunted by armies.\n\nHe fled to neighboring Darkon, seeking refuge in the realm that had long opposed Drakov, and tried to make contact with its lord. He didn't make it anywhere near—three [[vampire]]s beset him, overwhelmed even his swordsmanship, and drunk deep of his life. Blacking out, Gondegal thought he had finally met his doom.\n\n===Out of the Shadows===\nBut fate or the Mists had other ideas. Somehow, Gondegal was rescued by Helna Vladinova, a great Knight of the Shadows and member of the Circle. Some days later, Gondegal awoke, wounded and weak, in the care of her squire, but it took many months for him to recover his health. In that time, he spoke often with Helna, coming to realize his life was on the wrong course and understanding the vital work the Circle did. By the end, he elected to join the Circle and become a Knight of the Shadows himself.\n\nOver the following years, Gondegal grew in wisdom and experience, and recovered the strength he'd lost to the vampires. He was a changed man and had gained a true calling. He dedicated himself to the liberation of the Falkovnians, not as a means to his achieving his own power, but for their own sake, and he vowed to fight against Drakov until one or both of them were dead. Working against Lord Drakov and his forces, he aided those he found in need in Falkovnia, hired adventurers to help him in missions, and mentored junior Knights of the Shadows. Once a year, he made a pilgrimage to Avonleigh to meet with fellow members of the Circle.\n\nBy 751 on the Barovian calendar, Gondegal was white-haired and leading an armed resistance in Falkovnia against Drakov's tyranny, and with some success. With excellent hit-and-run attacks, a force of kobolds under his command forced Drakov's troops from a region in central Falkovnia. However, Drakov was no stranger to such skilled opposition.\n\nFor his dedication, Gondegal had earned the respect and admiration of his fellows in the Circle. In 751, he even undertook the ceremony of Final Ascension to become leader of the Circle himself. No more was he a mercenary, a rebel, a conqueror, a king, or a bandit, now he was a champion. \n\nSome time before the late 15{{th}} century DR, a story had gone around [[Faerûn]] that Gondegal eventually emerged from the mists, and did something of great import.<ref>",
        "History": {
            "Preparation": "Who Gondegal had been or where he had come from, no one else knew. He was a complete unknown to Cormyrean authorities by the start of 1352 DR. Duke [[Bhereu]] later speculated he'd once been a professional soldier somewhere, given his familiarity with siege-craft. Whatever he was, it seemed Gondegal desired to be king, but the only course open to him was to seize land by strength of arms and become king by his own hand. And so he went ahead and did it.\n\nBasing himself out of the Cormyrean city of Arabel, Gondegal recruited mercenaries from throughout Cormyr and the [[Goblin Marches]] and the [[Stonelands]]. A good number of them were [[goblin]]s and other [[demihuman]]s. Chief among his allies and supporters were the saddler [[Arth Tembroar]], the herbalist [[Azunt Haelcloak]], and the clothier turned thief [[Culdath]], a.k.a. Bresk Thrattul, all of Arabel, as well as [[Baerendros|Baerendros the Blade]], a Sembian hiresword wanted for robberies and killings. He was secretly supported by a little-known minor nobleman, Lord [[Vorik Aris]]. He raised his army in just a fortnight. To pay them for their service, he said they could have whatever loot they could lay hands on as they went. To his commanders, he promised noble titles and land concessions. But first they would have to carve their kingdom out of the heart of Cormyr.\n\nMeanwhile, Cormyr's young king, [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], was disinclined to deal with issues of the realm outside the capital city of [[Suzail]].",
            "Initial Success": "Then, with his army bought but not paid for and carrying his banners, Gondegal launched guerilla-style raids throughout Cormyr. They ranged as far north as the [[Desertsedge Mountains]] and [[Tilver's Gap]] and other mountain passes, and captured [[Tilverton]]. They crossed the [[Wyvernwater]] and captured [[Immersea]] in the south and [[Wheloon]], [[Hultail]], and [[Wheloon]] in the east, and crossed the [[Eastern Plains]] to the edge of the [[Vast Swamp]]. They went west to [[Eveningstar]], raided the surrounding farms, and briefly laid siege to the town but could not take it. One of their bases was the former bandit stronghold of [[Wyvernhunt Keep]] in the foothills of the [[Storm Horns]] beside the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]].<ref>\n\n{{fq\n| text   = …The raiders struck swiftly, before our feeble militia could even be mustered. We know them as Gondegal's men. How can he dare try to claim kingship of Cormyr, yet allow his forces to treat us so?\n| source = From the journal of one of the dead of Darkenshield\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nGondegal and his mercenary soldiers proved capable and more agile than Cormyr's standing army, the [[Purple Dragons]], able to move swiftly, react faster, and strike without warning. Meanwhile, the majority of Cormyr's army had been stationed in [[High Horn]], ready for an external threat, not an internal one, and hence struggled to muster sufficient forces that could challenge Gondegal. A journal recovered from the ruins fifteen years later recounted how the militia were taken by surprise and the farmers fought back with agricultural tools before barricading themselves in their hall, and there distributing a painless [[poison]] to the young and old before fighting to the death. Meanwhile, wandering [[troll]]s wiped out the Starburst Swords, and they were recorded as missing. Intelligent monsters such as these had seized the opportunity to spread their own chaos.\n\nIn another battle, Gondegal's forces slaughtered much of a knightly order. One of the survivors, the [[paladin]] known as [[Knightengale]], named herself his arch-nemesis and would pursue him.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|462|Knightengale}}\n\nWith every victory or escape, Gondegal's legend grew and new supporters gathered to his cause. In this way, Gondegal enjoyed much early success and rapidly gained control of most of northern Cormyr. Styling himself \"the Lost King\", he made certain claims of a lineage to the royal bloodline of some fallen realm and a desire to reestablish his rightful kingdom; some folk who thought wistfully of these lost realms were sympathetic to his cause. His crown was thought to be looted from a Sembian tomb but he dared anyone to try to take it from him.",
            "Reaction and Retreat": "{{fq\n| text   = Gondegal's reach was longer than his blade.\n| source = A common saying in Arabel in the years after the war\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nBut for all his skill as a warrior and general, Gondegal had proved poor as a king. At least one of Gondegal's pay-ships, loaded with looted [[gold]], sank in the murky waters around [[Marsember]], still lost by [[1367 DR]].<ref><ref>\n\nSecond, Gondegal had not yet dealt with the Purple Dragons. Once they regrouped and formed a cohesive unit, they would retaliate in significant force. It would be the first time they were required to put down an insurrection.<ref> Even common farmers quickly volunteered to join the Purple Dragons in the face of Gondegal's threat.<ref> Meanwhile, the surviving defenders of Tilverton quickly retook their city. \n\nAnd third, the Cormyrean crown would summon reinforcements from neighboring lands. Gondegal had disrupted the local balance of power and disturbed or even assaulted the other realms, and seized more territory than he could keep from them. As a result, Tilverton, Sembia, [[Daggerdale]] and others of the [[Dalelands]] were willing to ally to aid Cormyr in bringing down the rogue conqueror. They were supplemented by adventuring bands, mercenaries, and Cormyr's own militias and [[War Wizards]], and particularly the forces of lords of lands claimed by Gondegal.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = We therefore declare this Gondegal to be an outlaw, and his life to be forfeit on sight for the murders he has visited upon the fair folk of Cormyr.\n| source = From the missive by Alaphondar, the Sage Royal\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nThe Cormyrean authorities also made sure to disprove Gondegal's claims of a right to rule. Agents researched his genealogy in court and temple documents, but turned up no evidence of any noble or royal bloodline. They even interviewed [[elves]], [[dwarves]] and even [[dragon]]s of sufficient and familiarity, and with the participation of the independent and unbiased [[High Heralds]], but they knew naught of it either. Thus, [[Alaphondar]], the Sage Royal, issued a missive dated [[Ches 11]] to the so-called \"signet list\" of senior Crown servants. In it, he refuted Gondegal's claims, though omitted repeating what they actually were, perhaps deliberately, and condemning the bloody warmongering even if they should turn out to be true. It went onto declare Gondegal to be killed on sight and his key followers Arth Tembroar, Azunt Haelcloak, Baerendros the Blade, and Culdath to be outlaws, wanted dead or alive. A similar royal proclamation followed, even as the Purple Dragons mustered for war.\n\nThus, after regrouping and enlisting the support of its neighbors, the Purple Dragons and a combined allied force brought the fight to Gondegal. They marched simultaneously out of High Horn, Thunder Gap, Tilverton, and [[High Dale]]. One force of troops was led by Azoun himself, in his first military command as king.\n\nBut entering the occupied lands, they found scenes of desolation and despair.\n\nMeanwhile, in the third week of [[Eleasis]], Gondegal returned to oft-rebellious Arabel and inspired the people to revolt, and successfully. The [[Indesm]], [[Immerdusk]], and other minor noble houses supported Gondegal, while the loyalist [[Marliir]]s were put under house arrest.",
            "Downfall": "{{fq\n| text   = He's worked wonders in a handful of days. All three gates have been fortified, and he's built outrider towers to cut off blind spots along the walls. Guard patrols have been doubled, water taken in from rivers in every jug and cask for miles around, and ballistae have been spotted in the major towers! This is no uprising of frustrated merchants; this foe knows his business.\n| source = Duke Bhereu's assessment of Arabel's defenses\n| float  = \n}}\nKing Azoun IV led his Purple Dragons on the march to Arabel. He expected to face the so-called King Gondegal in massed battle or a lengthy siege of his stronghold. \n\nBut Gondegal had already escaped justice, having disappeared in the middle of the last night of his reign or even one or two days previously. The mercenaries had been abandoned, left to look after themselves, and they had no wish to fight and die for Arabel without any gold.\n\nThus, on the morn of the eighth day, the gates were flung open to the Cormyrean army and they entered Arabel with no battle or bloodshed at all.\n\nMeanwhile, Gondegal made it out of Cormyr and was reported to have fled north and then east through [[Teshwave]], but after this only contradicting rumors and tales gave his whereabouts.",
            "The Fear of Cormyr": "Although Gondegal's kingdom was short-lived, it played a significant role in defining the Kingdom of Cormyr thereafter. Gondegal's rebellion forced Azoun IV to pay attention to matters beyond Suzail and take action, He also began to strictly enforce [[Laws of Cormyr|laws]] requiring groups of five or more armed adventurers to have a royal charter to operate, in order to limit future rebellions.<ref>\n\nArabel received an especially large Purple Dragons garrison, for fear of the return of Gondegal, his offspring, or his imitators, as well to guard against rebellion and future attacks.

He was an adventure-seeker and would try just about anything, but was neither reckless nor foolish, and would not take on a fool's errand or a mission doomed to failure. He had such an enormous confidence and self-assurance that he appeared arrogant and domineering. \n\nBy the time he was a Knight of the Shadows and head of the Circle, Gondegal was a seasoned campaigner, a born leader, a veteran of countless battles, his mettle tested and proven, and he knew it and he showed it. But he had total dedication to the Circle and the cause of good in the Demiplane of Dread, and would never willingly abandon his duty. Having found his true calling gave him much inner strength to see him through his quest, though it might be foolish or doomed. He retained his love of adventure and battle, and preferred action to diplomacy or posturing, though he only attacked foes who truly deserved it and he had acquired a sense of mercy he'd not had in his early days.\n\nHe'd also come to enjoy being seen as a hero. Once, Gondegal had been content with the respect and admiration of his followers and the fear and hate of his foes and ordinary folk. But as a Knight of the Shadows, he appreciated the praise of the ordinary Falkovnians for his efforts to help them. They saw him as a protector of the oppressed and weak, and overlooked his seeming arrogance.",
        "Description": "Appearing to be in his forties, though his precise age was uncertain, Gondegal was a large and muscular man, standing over {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall. He had gray that he let grow long and hang loose and a long mustache that drooped below his jaw. His self-assurance was clear to all who beheld him.\n\nHis badge and his family's ancestral mark was the head of a [[grey wolf]] with red eyes, viewed face on.",
        "Possessions": "Gondegal typically wore a suit of [[chain mail]] but upon becoming a Knight of the Shadows he adopted the order's special black [[plate mail]] and black and yellow [[cape]], which had an eclipsed-sun clasp.\n\nHe always had a sword at hand. His main weapon was ''[[Scourge (sword)|Scourge]]'', an enchanted sword that was potent against [[lycanthrope]]s and [[shapechanger]]s—this of course proved very useful in Ravenloft.\n\n[[File:Gondegal appearance.png|thumb|right|250px|''Gondegal in battle armors granted by his magical rings.'']]\nDuring the rebellion in Cormyr, Gondegal was the owner of a number of magical rings, which changed his appearance or that of his armor.<ref group=\"note\">The artwork in ''The Grand History of the Realms'' is repurposed from many previous sourcebooks, often erroneously. Gondegal's art on page 141, shown here, is a selection of armors from ''[[Planar Handbook]]'': Mechanus gear, hooked armor, and sectioned armor. As such, it should be considered an example or suggestion, rather than representative of Gondegal. Naturally, they don't show his wolf's head crest. It is unknown what these rings are or what these do.\n\nApart from his sword, whatever [[magical item]]s that Gondegal had brought with him from Toril to the Demiplane of Dread were eventually depleted or lost.",
        "Abilities": "An extremely skilled [[fighter]], Gondegal was a specialist in both the [[longsword]] and two-handed [[broadsword]], Only occasionally did he use magical protections.\n\nSuch was his determination and desire to avenge injustice in Falkovnia, Gondegal was more resilient in battle with tyrants like Lord Drakov. He was deeply familiar with the tactics and twisted law and order of Drakov and his forces, usually knowing just what they'd do next with a gut feeling.\n\nBeing a Knight of the Shadows, Gondegal could cast the spells of a [[paladin]], such as ''[[cure serious wounds]]'' and ''[[protection from evil 10' radius]]'', but he could not [[turn undead]]."
