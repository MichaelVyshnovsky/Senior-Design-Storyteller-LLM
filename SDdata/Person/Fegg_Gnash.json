        "mainbody": "'''Fegg Gnash''' was a [[bloodforge]] commander who operated out of the [[Realm of Fire]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).\n\nFrom this domain, Fegg Gnash raided the surface lands, forcing peasants to flee their homes in fear of the rumblings in the earth. Coming across a group of refugees, the commander of the [[Legendary Campaign]] (which sought to unify the wartorn Utter East through conquest) ventured into the Realm of Fire to put a stop to it in a [[bloodforge]] battle."
