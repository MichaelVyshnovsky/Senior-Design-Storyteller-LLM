'''Arthagast Ulbrinter''' was one of the [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lord]]s of [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was slain by agents of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], an act that drew the wrath of his wife [[Remallia Haventree]] and her allies from among the powers of the [[Western Heartlands]].{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons (comic)|Chp.5|Panel 9}}

==Relationships==
Lord Ulbrinter was married to Lady [[Remallia Haventree]] an agent of the [[Harpers]]. Together they had two [[half-elven]] children, a boy [[Arthius]], and daughter [[Serenore]].{{Cite adventurers league/Uprising|5}}<ref group="note">While not explicitly stated, the inclusion of [[half-elven]] children [[Arthius]] and [[Serenore]] in a family portrait with mother [[Remallia Haventree]] and Arthagast highly suggest he is their father.
