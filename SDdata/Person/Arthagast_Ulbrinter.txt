Arthagast Ulbrinter was one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR. He was slain by agents of the Cult of the Dragon, an act that drew the wrath of his wife Remallia Haventree and her allies from among the powers of the Western Heartlands.
Lord Ulbrinter was married to Lady Remallia Haventree an agent of the Harpers. Together they had two half-elven children, a boy Arthius, and daughter Serenore.While not explicitly stated, the inclusion of half-elven children Arthius and Serenore in a family portrait with mother Remallia Haventree and Arthagast highly suggest he is their father.
Some time during the 1480s DR, the White Dragon Mask was taken by the Zhentarim agent Ratshadow from Neverwinter and stashed at the Ulbrinter villa in Waterdeep. Agents of the Cult of the Dragon abducted Lord Ulbrinter from his home, stole the dragon mask, and assassinated the Masked Lord. Arthagasts death left his wife Lady Haventree a widow.
