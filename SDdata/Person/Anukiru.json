        "mainbody": "'''Anukiru''' was a famed swordsmith from [[Kozakura]], who lived many years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Anukiru made a name for himself by being a master weapon maker. His fame stretched across the entire Kozakura. The swordsmith's fame earned him a sword commission from the [[Shogun]] of the time, who wanted a grand sword that would symbolize his reign. Anukiru eventually finished his masterpiece â€“ ''[[Steel Blossom]]''. The swordsmith immediately fell in love with his creation and refused to hand it over to the Shogun. Infuriated, the Shogun beheaded Anukiru with ''Steel Blossom''. However, the Shogun's life was soon violently cut short, while Anukiru's name lived on, still remembered in the late 14{{th}} century DR, thanks to ''Steel Blossom''."
