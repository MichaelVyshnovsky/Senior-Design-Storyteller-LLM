        "mainbody": "Barrow was a male human burglar active in Daggerford circa 1372 DR.\nBarrow was a tall and lean male wrapped in tight dark leather armor.\nLike his partner, Barrow was prone to murder. He and Parker often shared the sadistic pleasure of prolonging suffering of their victims. He was partial to skinning their victims alive.\nBarrow performed burglary jobs alongside his lover and partner Parker.\nBarrow used his enchanted +1 rapier in battle and came equipped with various trap-making kits such as tangle and spike trap kits. He carried a vial of spider venom of average strength used to coat his weapon, two vials of black armor dye, and a greenstone.\nIn 1372 DR, Barrow and Parker broke into a wealthy artists cottage in Daggerford. The building was boded up for the season but the front door of it was left callously unlocked by the burglarizing duo who started with the owners wine cellar."
