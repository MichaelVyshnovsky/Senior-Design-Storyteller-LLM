        "mainbody": "'''Barrow''' was a male [[human]] burglar active in [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "Barrow was a tall and lean male wrapped in tight dark leather armor.",
        "Personality": "Like his partner, Barrow was prone to murder. He and Parker often shared the sadistic pleasure of prolonging suffering of their victims. He was partial to skinning their victims alive.",
        "Relationships": "Barrow performed burglary jobs alongside his lover and partner [[Parker (bandit)|Parker]].",
        "Possessions": "Barrow used his enchanted ''+1'' [[rapier]] in battle and came equipped with various trap-making kits such as tangle and spike trap kits. He carried a vial of [[spider]] venom of average strength used to coat his weapon, two vials of black armor dye, and a [[greenstone]].",
        "History": "In 1372 DR, Barrow and Parker broke into a wealthy artist's cottage in Daggerford. The building was boded up for the season but the front door of it was left callously unlocked by the burglarizing duo who started with the owner's [[wine]] cellar."
