        "mainbody": "Alan Alyth was the proprietor of the Elfsong Tavern during the mid-to-late 15 century DR.\nThe aged barkeep was rather attractive and youthful-looking, despite his age, due to his half-elven heritage on his mothers side.\nIn addition to running the Elfsong, Alan made his living as a moneylender. Despite the many adventurers that came into the tavern, Alan rarely lent them money, preferring to offer them a free drink in exchange for their peaceful patronage."
