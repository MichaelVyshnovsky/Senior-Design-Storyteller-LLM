'''Itchy''' was one of two [[crawling claw]] [[undead]] pets kept by [[Lucretious]], the proprietress of of the [[Circus of the Last Days]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Itchy was an amputated reanimated hand of a [[humanoid]] creature. It had pale skin, and its fingers were decorated with many [[ring]]s.

==Abilities==
Like other crawling claws, Itchy had the usual strengths and vulnerabilities of an undead creature. It was unaffected by [[poison]] and possessed a ''[[blindsight]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Itchy and another fellow crawling claw named [[Scratchy]] could be found in Lucretious's tent at the back end of the area in [[Rivington]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], where the Circus of the Last Days performed for a short period of time, before moving on across the planes.
