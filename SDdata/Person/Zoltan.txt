'''Zoltan''' was a young man who worked for the [[Hostlers and Stablehands Guild]] of [[Zazesspur]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Zoltan wore blue and green colors, to signify his membership with the Hostlers and Stablehands Guild.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, Zoltan found the young woman [[Scab]] sleeping in the straw of a stable. He began to grope her. Upon waking, her magic set Zoltan's clothes and hair on fire. He rushed to the nearest [[horse]] trough to douse the sparks, where he was found by [[Zaranda Star]]. A mob began to form, and Zaranda questioned them all about what had happened.
