        "mainbody": "Quelzur Naisen was a member of the Red Wizards of Thay and a pirate in 1359 DR.\nQuelzur was a talented wizard but frequently came into conflict with his superiors and was not prone to making friends. So, when he offended the powerful zulkir Szass Tam, Quelzur decided to go into voluntary exile instead of risking becoming one of Tams zombies.\nQuickly, he turned to piracy and became a very able pirate thanks to his censer for summoning air elementals, which transformed his ship into one of the most maneuverable vessels on the Inner Sea.\nQuelzur maintained the typical mentality of a Red Wizard, in which wizards were superior to any non-wizard. He lorded over his crew like a godling. He still dressed like a Red Wizard."
