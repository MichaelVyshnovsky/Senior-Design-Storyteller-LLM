This was just a superficial gaffe however, as he actually served as Wei Dao's secret messenger, bringing her information for her spies outside the palace.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, Abazm managed to secure a meeting the novice [[Harpers]] agent [[Ruha]], her ally [[Fowler]] who posed as her [[Bedine]] bodyguard, and the Shou royals of the Ginger Palace."
