Isair was a cambion wizard who lead the Legion of the Chimera, along with his sister Madae, during the early 14th century DR.
Isair was described to be a twisted sorcerer with as much power as any master of the Host Tower of the Arcane.
Being half-elf and half-devil, Isair had typical elven and devilish characteristics. He was about six and a half feet tall, and stood on two legs. He had dark red skin, broad, leathery wings, twisted legs, and a tail. Isair was a powerful wizard with fighter training, and fought off his enemies with two large scimitars.
Little of Isairs equipment was known. Upon his defeat, his body was dragged into the Limbo Plane, and his equipment with him. It was most likely that Isair carried a greater version of Iyachtu Xvims scimitar.
Isair and his twin sister, Madae, were born in the a small house, to the west of Kuldahars watchtower, in 1282 DR. With the archdruid Iselores help, they were born to an elf, Ilmadia, who had become pregnant with the devil, Belhifet. He was named after Iselores father. To his mothers surprise, he was born with twisted legs. After the villages revolted against them, he and his sister escaped to Luskan. Here, they made contact with Luskans Arcane Brotherhood, and became emissaries to the Abyssal Plane.
The twins met their father upon their maturity and fought for him in the Nine Hells, but still received discrimination. Therefore, the two returned to Faer√ªn. Isair and his sister were disgusted about they way they were treated for being half-breeds. Due to this, he and Madae went to form the Legion of the Chimera circa 1306 DR, their motivation being equality for half-breeds. After they were disrespected by the Ten Towns, Isair did not find it endearing, and sent his armies out to war.
Later in 1312 DR, he and Madae were confronted by an adventuring band and fought them in a raging battle. After their stronghold, Severed Hand, collapsed, he was dragged into the plane of Limbo, and had not been reported back since.
