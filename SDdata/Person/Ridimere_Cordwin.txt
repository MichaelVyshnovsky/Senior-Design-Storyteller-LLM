'''Ridimere Cordwin''' was the oldest son of General [[Vandemar Cordwin]], an influential [[Arrabar]]ran [[priest]] of [[Tempus]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, [[Glisena Foesmasher]], the daughter of Baron [[Thuragar Foesmasher]] of [[Sespech]] refused Ridimere Cordwin's advances. Since then, the man's father, Vandemar Cordwin, sought revenge against Baron. Whether this was caused by the failed courting, was unclear. However, that did not stop gossips and rumors on the topic.
