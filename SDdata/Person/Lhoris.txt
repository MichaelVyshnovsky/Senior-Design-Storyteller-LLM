'''Lhoris''' was a fiery-tempered [[human]] from [[Fireshear]] who was an apprentice of [[Blackstaff Tower]].

==Description==
Lhoris had flaming red hair. At the age of fifteen years, he was not very muscly.

==Personality==
When Lhoris grew angry—which was frequent—his skin color almost matched that of his hair. His peers even referred to him as "the angry one".

==Relationships==
Lhoris was schooled by senior apprentice [[Tsarra Chaadren]].

Fellow apprentice [[Traya Ginara]] appeared to have had a crush on him.

==History==
Originally from [[Fireshear]], Lhoris was brought to the Blackstaff Tower at the age of ten years. Tsarra was curious as to the source of his anger but waited to look deeper into the matter. In the interim, she attempted to steer his abilities in [[Sorcerer|sorcery]] and [[wizard]]ry away from any magic that his temper could use to cause harm.

On [[Uktar 28|28 Uktar]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, when Lhorik was 15 years old, he was a member of a group of eight apprentices, including his teacher, who spent an overnight hunting trip in the [[Pellamcopse Woods]]. He lacked the strength to move the [[doe]] that Tsarra had shot alone and his peer [[Trehgan]] assisted him.

When they arrived back at the tower, he was one of four tasked with butchering the game that they had taken and was in the kitchens when an explosion destroyed one of the walls of the tower.
