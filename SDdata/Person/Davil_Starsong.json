        "mainbody": "Davil Starsong () was a sun elf agent of the Zhentarim, operating within the city of Waterdeep during the late 15 century DR. He was known to keep a room at the Yawning Portal, conducting all his business in the taproom.\nDavil Starsong was naturally capable of finding profitable business deals and making friends, which was ideal for his position within the Black Network. Being a sun elf, he had a natural aptitude for arcane magic, making him a fine bard, along with having the patience of someone who might live ten times longer than even his most fortunate friends. Unlike other sun elves, he was not aloof nor pretentious. He always traded with grace and aplomb even when drunk.\nDavil was a member of the Doom Raiders adventuring company. He and his former companions composed the leadership of the Zhentarim of Waterdeep.\nHe used an elven lute as a spellcasting focus.\nDavil was once an adventurer but together with his adventuring companions he decided to join the Zhentarim. In the year 1489 DR, they were directed to establish a Zhent foothold in Waterdeep.\nIn 1492 DR, Davil was seen riding a carriage with a half-orc bodyguard, in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep. It was said he could put people he favored into contact with other acquaintances from the Zhentarim, who in turn provided profitable loans, sold magic, weapons, mercenaries, and even arranged assassinations."
