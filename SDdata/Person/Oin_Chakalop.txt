OinChakalop was an illithid, member of a group of aberrations who ran the notorious Black Market, hidden in the mountains to the east from Samargol in the jungle nation of Samarach circa 1374 DR.
In appearance, OinChakalop was a standard mind flayer. The creatures behavior, however, was quite strange. OinChakalop constantly twitched and made odd garbled noises that did not appear to be a language but rather insane mutterings and groans of an aberrant creature.
Sometime before the , OinChakalop was a highly respected seer and a prophet among his kin until one of his psychic travels took the mind flayer too far. OinChakalop found himself touching the mind of a mad god. Many speculated that the mad god was Cyric himself. The contact shattered OinChakalops aberrant mind, leaving him incapable of speech. His fellow illithid Zhiir took the ex-seer under his wing to work as a servant in the Black Market of Samarach.
