        "mainbody": "norrel Talbot was the leader of the Company of the Lynx, an adventuring group that operated throughout Cormyr during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nIn the , Talbot heard an interesting tale that he believed would bring great riches to himself and his fellow adventurers. According to a lone individual, a great and ancient wyrm had devoured every diplomat and travelers that was part of a foreign envoy headed for Cormyr, during their travel across the Anauroch, along with important documents that were en route to King Azoun IV. The elder dragon was then itself slain while in the Forest Country, and its massive corpse remained along the banks of the Wyvernwater.\nWhile it was a messy job, Talbot and his men recovered the documents in the dragons innards, but discovered they were protected within magically-sealed pouches. When the companys spellcasters, Bartholeme and Parys Guin refused to use their magic to open the pouches, Talbot hired the solitary magic-user Midnight to do so, but lied about the fact they contained the true names of many prominent Red Wizards of far off Thay.\nWhile Talbot struggled to bring Midnight on as a permanent member of their group, or kill her to keep their secret, his decision was made when the young woman stole the documents and attempted to flee with them in the middle of the night. Talbot led the company in a brief pursuit, but ultimately sealed their fate and forfeit their lives upon getting close to Midnight. The young woman prayed to the goddess of magic for help, and Mystra struck down the entire company with blue fire, killing Talbot and his men, but sparing her faithful Midnight."
