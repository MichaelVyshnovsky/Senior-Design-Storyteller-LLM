Tegan was an escaped slave in the Deep Wastes in the late 15 century DR.
Tegan and her brother Drystan were two farmers in the Dalelands until, circa 1481 DR, they were captured in an orc raid. They were sold to the yugoloth Maram il Vass as a slave in its lair in the Deep Wastes. Circa 1486 DR, they managed to escape but were in very poor condition until they met an adventuring party that saved Tegan.
Tegan had a desperate need for help but her time with a yugoloth caused her to not trust anyone. Tegan was proud and stubborn.
