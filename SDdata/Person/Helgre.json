        "mainbody": "'''Helgre''' served as the first mate on the ''[[Orcsblood]]'', a pirate ship that terrorized the [[Moonsea]] in the mid–15th century [[DR]].\n\nShe managed to escape when the ''Orcsblood'' was attacked and destroyed by [[Deva (aasimar)|devas]] in [[1460 DR]].\n\nHelgre correctly reasoned that two shipmates, [[Gareth Jadaren]] and [[Ivor Beguine]], who had recently jumped ship, were the ones responsible for betraying the ''Orcsblood'''s location to the devas. She dedicated the following months to tracking down Gareth and Ivor and found them near [[Erlkazar]] in [[1461 DR]]. Rather than attempt to kill the two men, she slew Ivor's lover, [[Jandi M'baren]], and staged the crime so that it appeared Gareth was responsible.\n\nAt some point after [[1461 DR]], Helgre became a [[vampire]]. She participated in the assault on [[Jadaren Hold]] in [[1600 DR]] but was killed by the deva [[Lakini]].",
