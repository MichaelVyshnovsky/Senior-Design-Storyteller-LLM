Picked one off yesterday, myself. Shot her through the throat. That should've killed her, buy...she kept gasping.}}",

        "History": "After [[the Descent]] of Elturel into [[Avernus]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Rikka and the exiled Elturian tieflings led by [[Zevlor]] traveled west towards the great metropolis of [[Baldur's Gate]]. They were granted temporary refuge at Emerald Grove for some time, due to increased [[goblin]] attacks in the region.\n\nRikka was forced to kill for the first time defending the grove. Even though she killed a goblin that would likely cause her or her companions harm, Rikka was quite troubled about the whole ordeal."
