Jules Verne was a mysterious author from another world, whose name was considered to be rather strange by Faer√ªnian standards.
During his lifetime, this author wrote a number of works. The most notable of these was 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, as multiple copies of it somehow made their way to the world of Toril. Many of these were found on the Nelanther Isles, in the pirate-ridden Spindrift Town, around 1372 DR.
