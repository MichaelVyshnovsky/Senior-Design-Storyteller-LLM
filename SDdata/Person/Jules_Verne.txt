'''Jules Verne''' was a mysterious author from [[earth|another world]], whose name was considered to be rather strange by [[Faer√ªn]]ian standards.

==History==
During his lifetime, this author wrote a number of works.{{Cite dragon/235/The Dragon's Bestiary: Monsters of the Lower Deep|43}}{{Cite dragon/277/The Age of Steam|47}} The most notable of these was ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'', as multiple copies of it somehow made their way to the world of [[Toril]]. Many of these were found on the [[Nelanther Isles]], in the pirate-ridden [[Spindrift Town]], around [[1372 DR]].
