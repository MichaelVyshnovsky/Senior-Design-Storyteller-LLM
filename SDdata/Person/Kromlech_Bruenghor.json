        "mainbody": "Kromlech was a shield dwarf warrior and adventurer in the late 14 century DR. He helped topple the Dark Alliance alongside fellow adventurers Adrianna and Vahn.\nHe was gruff and held strong opinions.\nHe was a strong and sturdy warrior in melee combat.\nBorn and raised in the town of Easting in the Sunset Mountains, Kromlech was the youngest of his clan when he left to become an adventurer.\nOn arriving in the city of Baldurs Gate, Kromlech was waylaid and robbed by thieves almost immediately. His first instinct was to track down the ones who robbed him and seek vengeance. Kromlech teamed up with Vahn, a human arcane archer, and Adrianna, a moon elf sorceress, to get his gold back. After foiling various attempts by the thieves guild to weaken Baldurs Gate, Kromlech and his friends were recruited into the Harpers. The Harpers told them where the guilds base was and sent them there. Once the guild was destroyed, the trio killed Karne, the thief responsible (though they later learned Karne had faked his death). The trio then fought against the guild leader, the beholder Xantam. Xantam came to Baldurs Gate through a shadow gate that led to the Sunset Mountains.\nAt the behest of the Harper agent Jherek, the trio traveled to the Sunset Mountains. In the mountains, the trio settled the three primary problems affecting Kromlechs home town of Easting mountain creatures like ogres and gnolls, drow from Menzoberranzan, and the ice dragon Ciraxis. Ciraxis almost killed the trio, but they killed him and advanced on to the Marsh of Chelimber. In the Marsh, the trio met Sleyvas, the only one of the lizardfolk not worshiping a strange tower called the Onyx Tower. After defeating the lizardfolk and their leader, Sleyvas sent the trio into the Onyx Tower. The trio then freed the ghost of the Elfsong Tavern by killing Eldrith the Betrayer.\nThis temporarily saved Baldurs Gate, as the city had been the focus of Eldriths plan for domination. However, it transpired that Eldriths designs against the city had only been part of a larger plot, a fact brought home to Adrianna and her companions when they escaped the crumbling tower only to fall into the hands of Mordoc SeLanmere after passing through the final shadow gate.\nThe trio was imprisoned in the Keep of Pale Night and interrogated by Mordocs servant, Xanhast. Mordoc decided not to kill them, however, and they survived in imprisonment until another group of adventurers broke into the keep and gained an opportunity to rescue Adrianna and the others. Kromlech was then given his magical axe back by Borador Goldhand. After being rescued by Dorn Redbear, Vhaidra Uoswiir, Ysuran Auondril, Borador Goldhand, Allessia Faithhammer, the Harper Jherek and the Zhentarim agent Karne (who had decided to fight against Mordoc after realizing the Zhentarim could no longer get the Onyx Tower), Kromlech, Vahn, and Adrianna then joined the battle against Mordoc in the Keep of Pale Night and against Mordocs servants in Baldurs Gate. Kromlech then helped in killing his former captor in the Onyx Tower, which crumbled for a final time."
