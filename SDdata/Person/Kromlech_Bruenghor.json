        "mainbody": "'''Kromlech''' was a [[shield dwarf]] warrior and [[adventurer]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He helped topple the [[Dark Alliance]] alongside fellow adventurers [[Adrianna]] and [[Vahn]].",
        "Personality": "He was gruff and held strong opinions.",
        "Abilities": "He was a strong and sturdy warrior in melee combat.",
        "History": {
            "Fight Against the Thieves": "On arriving in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], Kromlech was waylaid and robbed by thieves almost immediately. His first instinct was to track down the ones who robbed him and seek vengeance. Kromlech teamed up with Vahn, a [[human]] [[arcane archer]], and Adrianna, a [[moon elf]] [[sorceress]], to get his [[gold]] back. After foiling various attempts by the thieves guild to weaken Baldur's Gate, Kromlech and his friends were recruited into the [[Harpers]]. The Harpers told them where the guild's base was and sent them there. Once the guild was destroyed, the trio killed [[Karne]], the thief responsible (though they later learned Karne had faked his death). The trio then fought against the guild leader, the [[beholder]] [[Xantam]]. Xantam came to Baldur's Gate through a shadow gate that led to the Sunset Mountains.",
            "Fight Against the Betrayer": "At the behest of the Harper agent [[Jherek]], the trio traveled to the Sunset Mountains. In the mountains, the trio settled the three primary problems affecting Kromlech's home town of Easting: mountain creatures like [[ogres]] and [[gnolls]], [[drow]] from [[Menzoberranzan]], and the [[ice dragon]] [[Ciraxis]]. Ciraxis almost killed the trio, but they killed him and advanced on to the [[Marsh of Chelimber]]. In the Marsh, the trio met [[Sleyvas]], the only one of the [[lizardfolk]] not worshiping a strange tower called the [[Onyx Tower]]. After defeating the lizardfolk and their leader, Sleyvas sent the trio into the Onyx Tower. The trio then freed the ghost of the [[Elfsong Tavern]] by killing [[Eldrith the Betrayer]].\n\nThis temporarily saved Baldur's Gate, as the city had been the focus of Eldrith's plan for domination. However, it transpired that Eldrith's designs against the city had only been part of a larger plot, a fact brought home to Adrianna and her companions when they escaped the crumbling tower only to fall into the hands of [[Mordoc SeLanmere]] after passing through the final shadow gate.",
            "Fight Against the Vampires": "The trio was imprisoned in the [[Keep of Pale Night]] and interrogated by Mordoc's servant, [[Xanhast]]. Mordoc decided not to kill them, however, and they survived in imprisonment until another group of adventurers broke into the keep and gained an opportunity to rescue Adrianna and the others. Kromlech was then given his magical axe back by [[Borador Goldhand]]. After being rescued by [[Dorn Redbear]], [[Vhaidra Uoswiir]], [[Ysuran Auondril]], [[Borador Goldhand]], [[Allessia Faithhammer]], the Harper Jherek and the [[Zhentarim]] agent Karne (who had decided to fight against Mordoc after realizing the Zhentarim could no longer get the Onyx Tower), Kromlech, Vahn, and Adrianna then joined the battle against Mordoc in the Keep of Pale Night and against Mordoc's servants in Baldur's Gate. Kromlech then helped in killing his former captor in the Onyx Tower, which crumbled for a final time."
