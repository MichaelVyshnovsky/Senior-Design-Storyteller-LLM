Lieutenant '''Karvan Hur''' was the ranking officer of the contingent of guards stationed at the [[Thayan enclave (Proskur)|Thayan enclave]] within the city of [[Proskur]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. While he and his men were technically subordinate to the enclave's [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]] and their handful of [[Thayan knight]]s, they were largely ignored by these groups.

==Activities==
Karven led a group of 36 guards, who were divided into five six-man squads, most of whom were [[Thay]]an. Amongst them were a few foreign-born mercenaries, though they were closely observed by their superiors.

Amongst his guards stationed throughout the enclave, Lieutenant Hur kept at least one [[wizard]] stationed at the front gate, armed with either a ''[[wand of detect magic]]'' or ''[[wand of detect thoughts]]'' to glean more insight into those who entered within.
