'''Connel Greylore''' was a skilled archer that served as a sentry and leader of the armed forces of [[Shadowdale]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When the [[Zhentilar]] army marched upon [[Shadowdale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Connel led the sentries that took roost in the trees beyond [[Krag Pool]]. In the opening exchanges of the [[Second battle of Shadowdale|battle that would follow]], Connel and his arches rained volleys of arrows upon the first Zhent soldiers that stepped foot within their range, maneuvering others into wooden stake traps they had erected.

This success was quick-lived however, as Connel was taken down by a volley of arrows launched by Zhent archers in response.
