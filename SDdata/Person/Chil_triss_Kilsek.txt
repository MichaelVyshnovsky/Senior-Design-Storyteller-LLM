'''Chil'triss Kilsek''' was the leader of a group of [[drider]]s.

==History==
Chil'triss was once a priestess of [[Lolth]] of [[House Kilsek]] before she was cursed to become a drider.

In time, she became the leader of a large group of driders living in the [[Underdark]] under the [[Misty Forest]].

In [[1375 DR]], Chil'triss and her fellows were recruited into the [[Selvetargtlin]] by the [[judicator]] [[Dhairn]].
