        "Combat": "The baron fought with three main weapons: a [[quarterstaff]], a [[spear]] and a [[crossbow]]. The crossbow was loaded with [[poison]]ous ''[[bolt of biting|bolts of biting]]''.",
        "History": "Old sahuagin tales told of outsiders who would decide the fate of the [[City of Caverns]]. [[Gorion's Ward]] may have arrived in the city with his adventuring party, and the baron advised his monarch to kill them."
