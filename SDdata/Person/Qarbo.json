        "mainbody": "Qarbo was a member of the Cult of the Black Earth during the Elemental Evil crisis.\nQarbo was cruel and more than a little manic in his demeanor. He liked to grin slyly at strangers, as if enjoying an inside joke.\nQarbo ran all the day-to day activities of the cult inside the monastery.\nIn 1491 DR, Hellenrae, Qarbo, and their minions disguised themselves as monks occupying the Sacred Stone Monastery. Soon after, however, some adventurers infiltrated the monastery and in the end confronted and defeated Qarbo."
