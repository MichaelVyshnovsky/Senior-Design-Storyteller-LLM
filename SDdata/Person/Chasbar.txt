Chasbar was one of the Sardonyx Knights of Grumbar who was attempting to wrestle the ownership of the temple of Myrkul in Undermountain from the dead gods clerics and wizards in 1370 DR.
In 1370 DR, Chasbar and a few of his fellow Sardonyx Knights attempted to take over the temple of Myrkul and partially succeeded in the task. One of the gargoyles that was serving Grumbar, was placed as a sentinel inside the disputed temple. The gargoyle, Mikreava was guarding the shrine of Grumbar set there by the Sardonyx Knights, but eventually decided against serving the elemental god and focused on its eating habits that included humanoids and the servants of Grumbar. Ultimately, the temple was visited by an agent of Khelben Arunsun, tasked with finding the Black Wand of Myrkul. The adventurer met both Chasbar and Mikreava, with both individuals asking the hero to kill the other one.
