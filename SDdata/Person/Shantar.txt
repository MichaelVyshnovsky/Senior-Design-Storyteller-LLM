'''Shantar''' was an aerial scout and [[hippogriff]] rider that was active during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He had a rather long face and at times kept up a days-old beard.

==Possessions==
He wore a ring that granted him the benefit of ''[[sending]]'' magic once per day.

==History==
In the final days of [[Nightal]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Shantar along with a dozen or so other aerial riders volunteered to serve as scouts for [[Khelben Arunsun]] when the threat of the [[phaerimm]] arose in lands near [[Evereska]]. Using ''[[invisibility]]'' magic, Shantar his hippogriff mount monitored the activities of the phaerimm and their army of [[bugbear]]s, [[mind flayer]]s and other horrific beasts.

As battle broke out at the edge of the moor between the monstrous army and [[elven]] warriors from [[Evermeet]] send to aid Evereska. Shantar led the scouts on an aerial support mission, transporting [[Naneatha Suaril]] and her [[Selûnite]] clerics atop their flying mounts to support the elves' rear guard. The maneuver was a successful one and granted the elven soldiers some reprieve, until a miscalculation by Evermeet's commander [[Laerm Ryence]] caused the elves to be overtaken by the mind flayers and a fearsome phaerimm. He called for Khelben's help in his mind, alerting the [[chosen]] of [[Mystra]] to the turning tide on the battlefield.
