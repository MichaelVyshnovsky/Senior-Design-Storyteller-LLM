        "mainbody": "'''Aarin Gend''' of [[Neverwinter]] was [[Nasher Alagondar|Lord Nasher]]'s personal spymaster in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite game/Neverwinter Nights}}",
        "Description": "He was a strongly built human man with dark skin and hair.",
        "History": "Aarin was born as a slave in [[Calimshan]] but escaped that life by killing his former master and avenging his mother's death, though he later admitted to being ashamed of the act. He went on to work for a pirate named [[Randall the Red]] on the [[Sword Coast]], where he gained skills and information. Lord Nasher imprisoned Aarin after killing Randall but Aarin was soon given a chance to make up for his past mistakes.\n\nAarin later worked undercover in a thieves guild in order to get close to and kill the leader, [[Calliara]]. However, he had fallen in love with her and gave her an ultimatum: to leave the thieves guild and criminal life, and potentially run away together, or die at his hand under the command of the justice system. Neither of them backed down so a fight ensued and Calliara was killed in the process. Aarin continued to work for Lord Nasher and Neverwinter and aided both greatly.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Aerin played a role in protecting Neverwinter through the outbreak of the [[Wailing Death]], the [[Cult of the Eye]]'s plots, and an attack from [[Luskan]].",
        "Relationships": "[[File:NWN concept Aarin Gend.png|thumb|250px|right|]]\nAarin was an ally to [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]] and did his best to find her when she was missing before ultimately discovering her betrayal and fighting against her. He also worked closely under Lord Nasher.",
        "Personality": "As spymaster, he was determined and ambitious to succeed despite the consequences whilst he kept a calm, and at times witty, exterior. He also struggled with his loyalties and worried deeply about repeating a situation where he would have to choose between his work for Lord Nasher and his heart, but ultimately he always chose the greater good for Neverwinter.",
        "Abilities": "As a [[rogue]], Aarin had high persuasive abilities, skill with a blade, and great stealthiness. He also could forge documents.\n\nDuring his time in Neverwinter, he showed skills in leadership and assisted in saving the city and its inhabitants.",
        "Possessions": "He owned an amulet that he might have given away as a sign of his love for the recipient."
