Darryl Orcslayer was a successful adventurer inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
As a reward for his martial services for slaying a bunch of orcs that raided Daggerford, Darryl was gifted a warehouse which converted into a tavern called the Lady Luck Tavern. His son Owenden inherited the tavern upon his death.
