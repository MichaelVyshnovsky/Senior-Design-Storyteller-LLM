Ausuriel, also known as the Blind Goat or simply Clyde, was a deva that acted as the patron angel of lost children. She held the role of Herald of Shiallia, the goddess of fertility and exarch of Mielikki. She came down to Faerûn numerous times throughout the late 15 century DR, appearing in the lands of the Moonsea and the nation of Elturgard.
Much of the time, Ausuriel took the form of small black goat with milky eyes. with dark wings, and gnome-like features.
On the Prime Material plane, Ausuriel dedicated herself to guiding and protecting young children that were touched by the divine. Whether that divinity was benevolent or malign, Shiallas angel dedicated herself to sheltering them, while they carried out their gods will in the Realms.
For quite some time, Ausuriel took on her goat form and traveled with Elisande, a young girl whom she watched over. According to Elisande, her goat would speak to her, sharing cryptic portents, at least one involving the "Dark Man". Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was in fact the chosen of the imprisoned god Cyric. 
For a time during 1480s DR, Ausuriel lived as a blind goat in a small village on an isle not too far from Phlan.
Elisande and Ausuriel later moved to Phlan, and remained there for a time, until the Cult of the Dragon took the city in a bloody coup. The pair escaped from Phlan, and found a place to stay at Fort Iron in the Underdark, near Mulmaster.
Elisande and Ausuriel traveled across the Moonsea together. They briefly attended a celebration for Mielikki in the village of Elventree circa 1486 DR, and even traveled back to the Underdark, near the village of the Stop. 
Later in Sporedome, the pair joined in on the planning of an assault on the drow city of Maerimydra. In fact, Elisande joined a group of adventurers in their attack on the fortress, all the way to the Undying Temple. It was there that the pair helped prevent the Dark Prince Grazzt from resisting a magical trap set up by Vizeran DeVir and Gromph Baenre that would trap the recently released demon lords. It was there in the temple that Grazzt revealed Ausuriels true identity, just before Elisande gleefully stabbed the demon lord in the chest.
In the , Ausuriel once again took the form of a goat, now named Clyde, to join another of the gods chosen, Dara the young priestess of Ilmater. Ausuriel and the planetar Rinzel―who took the form of an elderly herder named Ghorin―accompanied Dara on her divine quest in the Realms.
After the city of Elturel was pulled down to the Nine Hells, Dara, Ghorin, and Clyde (but mostly Dara) rallied a group of adventurers to save any innocents imperiled by the destruction. They helped the unfortunate Elturgardians join a refugee caravan to safety in the nearby city of Baldurs Gate.
Once in Baldurs Gate, the trio went missing and the refugees they had saved became threatened by Gharizol, a barbed devil who had been summoned to the city by a group of cultists. Daras adventurer friends managed to defeat the devil and save the refugees, some of whom it was revealed were descendants of Elturels famous cavalry, the Hellriders. Ausuriel and Rinsel then appeared with Dara, and revealed their true identities to the adventures. The angels wanted find heroes brave enough to accompany Dara and her divine quest, to find the lost souls of Hellriders that perished during the Ride into the Hells and free them from imprisonment in Avernus.
