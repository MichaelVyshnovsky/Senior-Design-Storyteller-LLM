        "mainbody": "[[Cordell]] was a great general who conquered much of [[Maztica]] for [[Amn]].  He formed the [[Golden Legion]] as a consolidation of his previous adventuring companies.

            "Pirate war": "Cordell's Golden Legion defeated a pirate army led by [[Akbet-Khrul]] in a great battle within [[Amn]].  The victory re-opened trade routes between [[Amn]] and other cities on the [[Sword Coast]].",
            "Maztican Expedition": "Cordell's legion won the gratitude of the [[Council of Six]] and sponsorship for their now legendary expedition to Maztica.   Cordell's original goal was to reach [[Kara-Tur]] by sailing westward across the [[Trackless Sea]].  The barbarian Horde blocked the overland route to Kara-Tur and Amn needed to find an alternative trade route.  Cordell's fleet set sail for Kara-Tur in [[1361 DR]] with 15 ships and 500 legionnaires.  After approximately forty days at sea they made landfall on the outer islands of Maztica where they encountered primitive natives.  Several days later, they landed on the Maztican mainland in [[Payit]] and began exploring the jungle."

At same time Cordell faced challenges from the new settlement of [[New Waterdeep]] and from his newest \"assistant\" from Amn, the Council's Third Grand Assessor [[Darius Bormul VI]].\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], a [[Jaguar Knights|Jaguar Knight]] wielding forged-metal claws like a [[Malar]]-priest attacked Cordell in his bedroom trying to kill him. The assassin failed, but managed to escape without a trace.",
