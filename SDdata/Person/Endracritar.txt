'''Endracritar''' was a [[Dragon aging|young]] male [[green dragon]] from the [[High Forest]] near [[Loudwater]] that was killed in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by forces from [[Waterdeep]] after he entered [[Kryptgarden Forest]].

==Personality==
Endracritar was young and bold, thinking he could challenge and defeat the ancient green dragon [[Claugiyliamatar]] who laired in Kryptgarden Forest. In truth, he was growing uneasy about [[Zhentarim]] activity around Loudwater and becoming alarmed at the might of the forces residing at [[Hellgate Keep]] in the northern part of the High Forest.

==History==
At some point after the {{YearlinkName|1303}},{{Cite dragon/233/Wyrms of the North: Claugiyliamatar|34}} but well before [[1372 DR]], Endracritar prepared spells and made plans to kill or drive out Old Gnawbone from her lair in [[Deeping Cave]]. He didn't realize that Claugiyliamatar had been watching him through her [[scrying]] crystal for a long time and had divined his plan. She deftly manipulated events whereby she swindled Lord [[Saerlin Brokengulf]] of the Waterdhavian nobility out of most of the family's wealth and then destroyed the [[Brokengulf]] villa in the city, crippling Lord Saerlin and killing three of his sisters&mdash;a very bold attack inside the city proper. When the expected retributive strike force arrived in Kryptgarden Forest looking for a green dragon to slay, they encountered Endracritar as he sought to probe Claugiyliamatar's defenses. The young dragon was no match for the might and magic of Waterdeep and he was slain while Old Gnawbone watched from the far side of the [[Sword Mountains]].
