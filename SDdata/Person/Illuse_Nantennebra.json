        "mainbody": "Illuse Nantennebra, affectionately called Mother or Mother Nantennebra by the locals, was the innkeeper and beloved cook from the small fishing village of Jhaansciim of Tethyr in the late 14 century DR.\nMother Nantennebra ran the only inn in her village of Jhaansciim that stood along the Firedrake Road on the Dragons Neck Peninsula. The Wallside inn was famed for Illuses secret family recipe of the Nantennebra spicy fish stew, a murky brown unappealing stew of divine taste. Her cooking was beloved by locals as all mouths in the village were happy to eat Mother Nantennebras thick oily slop. The fame of the strange stew also brought visitors from afar to taste the rustic dish.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Mother Nantennebra happily filled pots people brought with them but sternly refused to sell more than a potful of it per client. Many merchants and travelers tried to convince the woman to sell the recipe, sell the stew in bigger batches, or even relocate to a bigger city as she could be making a wealthy living by selling the stew. She refused every single time, happy with her little inn business in Jhaansciim."
