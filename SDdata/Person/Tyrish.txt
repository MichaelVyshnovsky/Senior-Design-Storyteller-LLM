'''Tyrish''' was a legendary [[Pharaoh]] from the days of [[Mulhorandi]] antiquity.

==History==
Tyrish was considered ancient many [[human]] generations before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The legends of Tyrish talked about the Pharaoh possibly possessing divine powers. Ancient female slaves were said to pray to Tyrish during the full moon after giving birth to daughters. Legends claimed that if their prayers were heard, Tyrish sent them a magic [[stiletto]], later known as ''[[Winged Blight]]''. The knife was used to mutilate the women's daughters in order to save them from being perceived as valued by slavers, eventually leading to the girls' freedom. With each child cut, ''Winged Blight'' grew slightly bigger.

The authenticity of these stories was unknown; however, by the early 14{{th}} century DR, ''Winged Blight'' was to the size of a massive [[greatsword]].
