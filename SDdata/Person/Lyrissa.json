        "mainbody": "'''Lyrissa''' was a [[Faer√ªn]]ian female [[adventurer]] an member of the [[Iron Maidens]] adventuring company in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Lyrissa was a slim [[human]] that stood {{SI|5'3\"|ft-in|long=yes}} tall and weighed around {{SI|103|lb|k}}. She sported tanned skin and brunette hair. She usually dressed in loose robe, over a [[tunic]] and tight [[breeches]].",
        "Personality": "Lyrissa was quite a talkative and volatile woman, often prone to spending excessively. She was also quite skilled at lying and could mimic practically any voice.",
        "Possessions": "She carried a [[backpack]] full of a variety of disguises, as well as ''[[leather armor]] +1'', a ''[[short sword]] +3'', a ''[[ring of invisibility]]'', and a ''[[potion of healing]]''.",
        "History": "Lyrissa was born into a noble family. Later in life, she ran away from home when her parents tried to force her into an arranged marriage and took up the life of a [[thief]]. She became quite adept at making a living thieving, at one point adventuring with a [[fighter]] by the name of [[Kiera]]. Later, that same fighter would call her up to join five other women in forming the adventuring company Iron Maidens. Over time she and the rest of the company became enemies of [[Fzoul Chembryl]].\n\nOne day a rich merchant hired the Iron Maidens for a mission, that turned out to be a set-up orchestrated by agents of Fzoul. All but Kiera and Lyrissa were killed in the process, the two having escaped the trap, and Lyrissa having taken a [[gold]]en necklace with a [[diamond]] in its center from Fzoul's treasury that was worth around 12,000 [[gold piece]]s. Later they exacted revenge upon the merchant, Kiera killing him. From then on, Lyrissa tried to shy away from her thieving ways and take up the ways of a fighter. She also held on to the necklace she had stolen, worried that fencing it would give Fzoul a clue to their whereabouts."
