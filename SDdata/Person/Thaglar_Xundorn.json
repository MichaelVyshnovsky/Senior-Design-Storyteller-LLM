        "mainbody": "Thaglar Xundorn was a duergar smith in Skullport and Laird of Sargauthan Hold.\nThaglars title, bestowed on his father by the Deep King of Gracklstugh, granted him the loyalty of most of Skullports duergar, especially those of Clan Xundorn.\nAround 1370 DR, Thaglar was the proprietor of the only forge in the Port of Shadow and the lead authority among the duergar. One of their objectives was to check rumors of a mithral vein under Sargauth Enclave.\nIn 1375 DR Thaglar was busy opposing the concurrence of Murkstoness products.\nHe was still in operation during the early 1490s DR."
