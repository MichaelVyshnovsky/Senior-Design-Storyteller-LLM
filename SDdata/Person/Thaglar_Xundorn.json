        "History": "Around [[1370 DR]], Thaglar was the proprietor of the only forge in the Port of Shadow and the lead authority among the duergar. One of their objectives was to check rumors of a [[mithral]] vein under [[Sargauth Enclave]].\n\nIn [[1375 DR]] Thaglar was busy opposing the concurrence of [[Murkstones]]'s products.\n\nHe was still in operation during the early 1490s [[DR]]."
