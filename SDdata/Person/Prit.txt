Prit was a gnome who tunneled within the walls of the Pyramid of Amun-Re.
He looked squirrely, and always had a spoon in hand.
Prit was somewhat simple, and spoke with a lisp. He knew little more than the unsung history of spoons in architecture.
Besides having somehow survived for years within the tomb while digging through its walls with a spoon, Prit did not display any other abilities.
Prit carried a spoon he used both for digging and in combat.
Prit used to tap his spoon through walls, always in sets of three. He answered taps across the wall with similar signals. He had managed to encounter "a big statue guarding a small treasure", actually the clay golem guarding the heart of Munafik.
By , Prit may have encountered the adventurers that had released Khalitharius, after years of tunneling within the pyramid.
