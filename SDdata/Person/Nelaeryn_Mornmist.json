        "mainbody": "elaeryn Mornmist was an inhabitant of Myth Drannor in the 3 century DR.\nDuring the laying of the Mythal, Nelaeryn Mornmist was using a scrying globe and reading papers, with his wife close by. He was one of the first to feel the effects of the mythal, and suffered from backlash when Uldreiyn Starym attacked its creators while they were working. However, the mythal ultimately stabilized, and Nelaeryn was one of the first to use it in order to fly and dance in the air with his servants."
