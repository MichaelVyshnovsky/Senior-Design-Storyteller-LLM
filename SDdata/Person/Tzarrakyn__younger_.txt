Tzarrakyn, who was nicknamed the Younger because of his famous father, was an adventurer active during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
After his grandparents died of a winter fever, a teenaged Tzarrakyn worked for the Waterdeep City Watch, polishing boots and performing similar tasks in exchange for room and board.
His father was Tzarrakyn of the Company of Crazed Venturers. His mother, Dartheema, died giving birth to him and he was raised by her parents.
