        "mainbody": "Bradlie Tagart was an inept Director of the Special Advisory Council Guard of Ravens Bluff in the mid–14 century DR.\nAt the age of fifty-six, Director Tagart was a  tall human man who weighed . He had brown hair silvered with age and a wrinkled face.\nBradlie was trained in handling daggers, short swords, clubs, short bows, and knives. In addition to weapon proficiency, Director Tagart was a skilled gambler, runner, and knew the Common tongue.\nDirector Tagart always wore a set of ugly but enchanted +1 leathers.\nBy the mid–14 century DR, Bradlie Tagart had already spent most of his life in government. He was a master of filling forms and buttering up the right high-ranking officials. Perhaps to no surprise, Director Tagarts career was not aimed at bettering the lives of the common folk and citizens of Ravens Bluff but instead at political power and personal status, earning him some enemies among fellow officials and bureaucrats. Historically, the man always came out on top thanks to luck and political favors however, with age, Bradlie developed a sense of paranoia and a certain level of arrogance, accompanied by a slight case of being addled, prone to mood swings, and drastic actions."
