        "mainbody": "'''Bradlie Tagart''' was an inept Director of the [[Special Advisory Council Guard]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "At the age of fifty-six, Director Tagart was a {{SIAdj|5'10|'\"|long=yes}} tall [[human]] man who weighed {{SI|165|lb|k|long=yes}}. He had brown hair silvered with age and a wrinkled face.",
        "Abilities": "Bradlie was trained in handling [[dagger]]s, [[short sword]]s, [[club]]s, [[short bow]]s, and [[knives]]. In addition to weapon proficiency, Director Tagart was a skilled gambler, runner, and knew the [[Common tongue]].",
        "Possessions": "Director Tagart always wore a set of ugly but [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[Leather armor|leathers]].",
        "History": "By the mid–14{{th}} century DR, Bradlie Tagart had already spent most of his life in government. He was a master of filling forms and buttering up the right high-ranking officials. Perhaps to no surprise, Director Tagart's career was not aimed at bettering the lives of the common folk and citizens of Ravens Bluff but instead at political power and personal status, earning him some enemies among fellow officials and bureaucrats. Historically, the man always came out on top thanks to luck and political favors; however, with age, Bradlie developed a sense of paranoia and a certain level of arrogance, accompanied by a slight case of being addled, prone to mood swings, and drastic actions."
