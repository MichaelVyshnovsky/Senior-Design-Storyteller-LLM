        "mainbody": "'''Uncrimmon''' was a mysterious proprietor of the expensive curio shop, [[Uncrimmon's Trophies & Sundries]], in [[Mosstone]], [[Tethyr]].",
        "Abilities": "Uncrimmon was a secretive beholder that possessed powerful arcane magics. The creature was never seen in the open. Instead, it operated through a floating [[human]] eyeball and a floating severed human hand. The aberration could talk, hear, and see through the ensorcelled organ, freely moving it around his store. Uncrimmon used the floating hand to help [[Ardreth Ulnshoor]] run the store. The hand could carry, grab, strangle, and hold objects. It was able to wield weapons clumsily but was very apt with small and sharp blades that beholder preferred. Additionally, the mysterious store owner was able to cash his powerful magics through the floating hand.",
        "Possessions": "The eye tyrant owned the store and everything inside. Every human skeleton, every pickled [[bat]], every [[poison]]. This enterprise was protected by the storekeep, Ardreth Ulnshoor, secretly a [[doppelganger]] who served the many-eyed aberration seemingly out of fear. The beholder's store also had two fearsome [[helmed horror]]s who floated after customers with their [[sword]]s drawn in case of trouble. Like other of his kin, Uncrimmon was paranoid and greedy, so he enchanted the store itself to reflect magics and produce powerful spells to protect the eye tyrant's business and overly-priced stock.",
        "History": "Uncrimmon's Trophies & Sundries and its strange owner's ages were unknown. However, the beholder was well established in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. [[Volothamp Geddarm]] was able to uncover the store owner's identity and theorized that Uncrimmon used his store to keep an eye on adventurers, [[wizard]]s, and traveling [[cleric]]s for some unknown and sinister party."
