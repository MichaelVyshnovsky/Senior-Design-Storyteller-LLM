'''Bonehammer''' was a henchman, or perhaps pet, to the [[Talontar blightlord]] [[Damanda]] in {{yearlink|1373}}. He was a pale giant clad only in tattooed grotesque scenes of depravity, who sometimes spewed poems.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|215-217|22}}{{cite book/Lady of Poison|244-246|26}} He fought on his mistress' side when [[Marrec]]'s party caught up to her, though both vampires fled the fight when it turned against them.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|254-258|26}} Bonehammer was ultimately speared by a shaft of natural sunlight while fighting [[Gunggari Ulmarra]] at his mistress' hideout.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|266-267|28}}
