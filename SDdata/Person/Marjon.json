        "mainbody": "Marjon was a half-dragon son of the dracolich allied with the Cult of the Dragon, Pelendralaar, circa 1369 DR.\nMarjon was a mountain of a man,  tall. His appearance could be considered to be vaguely reptilian, with elongated facial features, and large draconic teeth. His skin was of unmistakable red hue and hands ended with long black hooked claws.\nMarjon had a foul temper, the result of his red dragon lineage. He often blew up steam by incinerating things within his chambers. His draconic appetite was a strain on human kitchens of the Cult, and his overall attitude was unpleasant and confrontational.\nDespite his personality flaws, Marjon was brave and smart. He often enjoyed brawls, which he always won. However if faced with infiltrators within the cult who could overpower him, the half-dragon did not hesitate to order fellow cultists to join the battle or call for aid.\nLike other half-dragons, Marjon could produce a devastating cone of fire from his mouth once a day, his red dragon breath weapon. He could see in areas of low-light and areas of total darkness, out to a distance of . He was completely unaffected by sleep, paralysis, and fire magic spells.\nMarjon was a strong athlete, proficient in jumping, climbing, swimming, and horseback riding. He was well-trained in the use of longswords.\nMarjons prized possession was his spectral blade, an enchanted longsword. He was often clad in full plate armor and carried an enchanted +2 shield. Additionally, he carried two potion of cure serious wounds.\nMarjon actively disapproved of Pelendralaars decision of becoming undead.\nIn 1369 DR, Kya Mordrayn and Marjons father, Pelendralaar, led the Cult of the Dragon to occupy the ruined city of Myth Drannor. The cultists intended on using raw magical power of the pool of radiance under the Castle Cormanthor to infect the cities in the Moonsea with the pools corrupting soul-consuming magic. During that period of time, Marjon occupied one of the Castle Cormanthors subterranean officers chambers. His room was quite spartan, only holding a metal-flame bed and a metal chair. The rest of the rooms furniture was incinerated by its moody occupant, judging by the abundant ash.\nIn the Cults hierarchy, Marjon reported directly to its higher-ups, namely Ellis commanded the half-dragons daily activities and Shamoor directed his special tasks and missions.\nSoon after the resurrection of the corrupted pools, two independent groups of heroes found themselves opposing the cult. One of the groups managed to infiltrate Castle Cormanthor and destroy Pelendralaars phylactery, allowing the other group, the Veiled Ones, to slay Marjons father and defeat Kya Mordrayn. Marjon was very likely to have survived the events of Myth Drannor."
