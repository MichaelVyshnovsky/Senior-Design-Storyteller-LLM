'''Chaotic Eva''', also known as '''Mother''', was a drag queen famous for performing at the [[Pink Flumph]] theater in [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She was a celebrated and game performer who inspired others to pursue careers as drag queens, and it was for this that she earned the nickname "Mother".

==Activities==
She was known to put on two shows a day, if not three on occasion. In her efforts to avoid being either hungry or sober while on stage, she invented a concoction of [[tomato]], [[vodka]], [[oyster]], and [[spice]]s. The drink was subsequently sold to the public at the Pink Flumph, and while some were hesitant to try it, most who did enjoyed it.

==Relationships==
Among the drag queens she had inspired&mdash;her "children"&mdash;were [[Gary Ooze]], [[Halflina]], and [[Misty Step (person)|Misty Step]].
