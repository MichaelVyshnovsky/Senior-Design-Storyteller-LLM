'''Truffles''' was the prized [[boar]] that belonged to [[Josef]] the Farmer from the [[Eastern Farmlands]] of [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Truffles was a large [[dire boar]].

==History==
In 1372 DR, Truffles was ambushed and torn apart by a pack of hungry [[wolves]] in the orchards of the Eastern Farmlands. The pig stood no change against wild beasts even with the boar being quite monstrous in size. Joe the Farmer was upset as he planned on collecting fine [[coin]] for the pig at the markets of Daggerford.
