        "mainbody": "'''Palasiraks''' was a [[red dragon]] daughter of the [[dracolich]] allied with the [[Cult of the Dragon]], [[Pelendralaar]], ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "In her youth, while she dwelt with her [[undead]] father in Myth Drannor, Palasiraks was {{SI|17'|'\"|long=yes}} long.",
        "Personality": "Palasiraks had a cunning personality, valuing survival over mindless aggression. She was a capable diplomat, and a good liar. Her eyes glistened with malice.",
        "Abilities": "Like other red dragons, Palasiraks was a flying creature. She utilized her mighty jaws, claws, and her tail in close combat. Her ''[[fire breath]]'' had a {{SI|40'|'\"|long=yes}} range and she could see in the dark as far as {{SI|60'|'\"|long=yes}}. She also possessed [[blindsight]] of {{SI|200'|'\"|long=yes}}, keen senses, and like her kin, she was immune to ''fire'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[Paralyze|paralysis]]'' spells and effects.",
        "History": "In 1369 DR, [[Kya Mordrayn]] and Palasiraks's and Marjon's father, Pelendralaar, led the Cult of the Dragon to occupy the ruined city of [[Myth Drannor]]. The cultists intended on using the raw magical power of the ''[[pool of radiance]]'' under the [[Castle Cormanthor]] to infect the cities in the Moonsea with the ''pool's'' corrupting soul-consuming magic and empower the dracolich by submerging him into the ''pool's'' depths.\n\nPalasiraks followed her father into Myth Drannor, and she laired in the [[Elven Catacombs]] connected to the subterranean levels of Castle Cormanthor. She could often be found not far from the chamber where the ''pool of radiance'' was located, and Pelendralaar's ''phylactery'' was kept, standing guard in front of her father's underground lair.\n\nSoon after the resurrections of the corrupted ''pools'', two independent groups of heroes found themselves opposing the cult. One of the groups managed to infiltrate Castle Cormanthor and destroy Pelendralaar's ''[[phylactery]]'', allowing the other group, the [[Veiled Ones]], to slay Palasiraks's father and defeat Kya Mordrayn. Palasiraks was alerted by the sounds of struggle echoing through the catacombs and peeked into the ''pool'' chamber. The young dragon hissed at the intruding adventurers, promising them Pelendralaar's vengeance and left conflict unscathed.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "It was rumored that following the destruction of her undead father, Palasiraks embarked on a quest to find and slay the adventurers that were instrumental in the fall of Pelendralaar. The Veiled Ones and the adventurers that passed through the ''[[gate]]'' in [[Darnarest's tower]] were the targets of her hunt."
