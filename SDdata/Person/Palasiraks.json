        "mainbody": "Palasiraks was a red dragon daughter of the dracolich allied with the Cult of the Dragon, Pelendralaar, circa 1369 DR.\nIn her youth, while she dwelt with her undead father in Myth Drannor, Palasiraks was  long.\nPalasiraks had a cunning personality, valuing survival over mindless aggression. She was a capable diplomat, and a good liar. Her eyes glistened with malice.\nLike other red dragons, Palasiraks was a flying creature. She utilized her mighty jaws, claws, and her tail in close combat. Her fire breath had a  range and she could see in the dark as far as . She also possessed blindsight of , keen senses, and like her kin, she was immune to fire, sleep, paralysis spells and effects.\nIn 1369 DR, Kya Mordrayn and Palasirakss and Marjons father, Pelendralaar, led the Cult of the Dragon to occupy the ruined city of Myth Drannor. The cultists intended on using the raw magical power of the pool of radiance under the Castle Cormanthor to infect the cities in the Moonsea with the pools corrupting soul-consuming magic and empower the dracolich by submerging him into the pools depths.\nPalasiraks followed her father into Myth Drannor, and she laired in the Elven Catacombs connected to the subterranean levels of Castle Cormanthor. She could often be found not far from the chamber where the pool of radiance was located, and Pelendralaars phylactery was kept, standing guard in front of her fathers underground lair.\nSoon after the resurrections of the corrupted pools, two independent groups of heroes found themselves opposing the cult. One of the groups managed to infiltrate Castle Cormanthor and destroy Pelendralaars phylactery, allowing the other group, the Veiled Ones, to slay Palasirakss father and defeat Kya Mordrayn. Palasiraks was alerted by the sounds of struggle echoing through the catacombs and peeked into the pool chamber. The young dragon hissed at the intruding adventurers, promising them Pelendralaars vengeance and left conflict unscathed.\nIt was rumored that following the destruction of her undead father, Palasiraks embarked on a quest to find and slay the adventurers that were instrumental in the fall of Pelendralaar. The Veiled Ones and the adventurers that passed through the gate in Darnarests tower were the targets of her hunt."
