        "mainbody": "'''Ira''' was a troubled woman who was deceived by the [[clerics]] of [[Darkmoon|Temple Darkmoon]] in [[1358 DR]].",
        "Description": "Ira wore a full suit of [[armor]], as well as a thin blue headband. She had curly brown hair, and dark brown eyes.",
        "History": "The night before the [[Heroes of Waterdeep]] entered the Darkmoon temple, Ira and her sister [[Calandra]] made camp in the forest close by. When she awoke the next morning, her sister had gone missing. There were signs of struggle near her bed, but there were strangely no tracks. After this, she asked the temple's greeter, [[Nadia]], for help. Nadia completely fooled the woman into thinking Darkmoon and its clerics were good-willed. In fact, Calandra had been taken further into the evil temple.\n\nIra feared for the worse, and began looking around for her sister. The Heroes of Waterdeep may have found Ira in the corner of the entry hall of Darkmoon, and she told them about her woes. She said to them, that if they found her sister, to guide her to Darkmoon where Nadia would look after her. She then exited the temple to continue her search."
