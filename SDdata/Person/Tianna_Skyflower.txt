Princess '''Tianna Skyflower''' was a [[half-elf]] who led a band of raiders from the [[Half-Elven Renegades]] of the [[High Forest]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Self-styled as a "princess", she also became the high priestess of the very small worship of [[Karsus]].

==Description==
Tianna was a dusky-skinned and dark-haired half-[[moon elf]] with a blaze of pure white hair across the crown of her head. She possessed a magic item known as the ''[[Ring of Five Visages]]'', which altered her features with [[illusion]] magic so few who met her ever saw her true appearance.

==Personality==
Tianna was said to have demanded to be addressed only as "Princess".

==Activities==
Tianna routinely performed banditry around the High Forest, originally basing her operations in the [[Dire Wood]].{{Cite polyhedron/104/Forgotten Deities: Karsus|4}}

==History==
Tianna was a descendent of the various peoples who inhabited the inner High Forest, including [[Eaerlann]]i moon elves, [[Netherese]] [[human]]s of [[Karse]], and [[drow]]. She became a prominent leader among these brigands and a follower of [[Malar]], and led her party on many raids against opportune targets around the High Forest

Around the [[Time of Troubles]], Tianna became the high priest of Karsus and led a revival of his worship among the half-elves of the Dire Wood, taking control of the small surviving priesthood.
