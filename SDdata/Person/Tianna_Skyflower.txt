Princess Tianna Skyflower was a half-elf who led a band of raiders from the Half-Elven Renegades of the High Forest in the 14 century DR. Self-styled as a "princess", she also became the high priestess of the very small worship of Karsus.
Tianna was a dusky-skinned and dark-haired half-moon elf with a blaze of pure white hair across the crown of her head. She possessed a magic item known as the Ring of Five Visages, which altered her features with illusion magic so few who met her ever saw her true appearance.
Tianna was said to have demanded to be addressed only as "Princess".
Tianna routinely performed banditry around the High Forest, originally basing her operations in the Dire Wood.
Tianna was a descendent of the various peoples who inhabited the inner High Forest, including Eaerlanni moon elves, Netherese humans of Karse, and drow. She became a prominent leader among these brigands and a follower of Malar, and led her party on many raids against opportune targets around the High Forest
Around the Time of Troubles, Tianna became the high priest of Karsus and led a revival of his worship among the half-elves of the Dire Wood, taking control of the small surviving priesthood.
