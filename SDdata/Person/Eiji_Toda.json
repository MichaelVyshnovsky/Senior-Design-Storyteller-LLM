        "mainbody": "'''Eiji Toda''' was a head of the [[Toda]] clan and a [[daimyo]] of [[Aru Province]] in [[Wa]] during the 1600s on the [[Wa Calendar]].",
        "History": "He was the son of [[Sousuke Toda]], who became daimyo in [[1210 DR|Wa Year 1628 (1210 DR)]] and governed well for almost ten years.\n\nWhen Sousuke died in a hunting accident, Eiji succeeded him, having only just reached his age of majority at barely 17 years old. He was eager to do well but inexperienced. This became clear when the following three years saw resurgent bandits devastate the [[pilgrim]] trains to [[Aru]]. However, the shogun [[Takahiro]] forgave Eiji because of his age and inexperience.\n\nThen, in [[1222 DR|1640 (1222 DR)]], a foreign raiding party (possibly from [[Shou Lung]]) made it through the daimyo's defenses to Aru's outskirts and razed part of the ''Eta'' District. This failure was too great and Eiji was removed from office, with the daimyate passed back to the [[Matsutomo]]s.\n\nEiji died without an heir, so the Toda line of Aru died with him."
