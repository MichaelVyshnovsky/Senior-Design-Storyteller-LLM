        "mainbody": "Eiji Toda was a head of the Toda clan and a daimyo of Aru Province in Wa during the 1600s on the Wa Calendar.\nHe was the son of Sousuke Toda, who became daimyo in Wa Year 1628 (1210 DR) and governed well for almost ten years.\nWhen Sousuke died in a hunting accident, Eiji succeeded him, having only just reached his age of majority at barely 17 years old. He was eager to do well but inexperienced. This became clear when the following three years saw resurgent bandits devastate the pilgrim trains to Aru. However, the shogun Takahiro forgave Eiji because of his age and inexperience.\nThen, in 1640 (1222 DR), a foreign raiding party (possibly from Shou Lung) made it through the daimyos defenses to Arus outskirts and razed part of the Eta District. This failure was too great and Eiji was removed from office, with the daimyate passed back to the Matsutomos.\nEiji died without an heir, so the Toda line of Aru died with him."
