'''Aolis Ildacer''' was the commander of the [[N'Vaelahr]] during the [[Weeping War|Fall of Myth Drannor]].

==History==
Aolis born in {{Yearlink|-90}}.

In [[711 DR]], Aolis and his wife [[Amara Ildacer]], both able [[Akh'Faer]] officers, after a meeting with the Grand Mage [[Ualair]], Arms-Major [[Kelvhan Olortynnal]], and Councilor [[Phraan Audark]], decided to create the [[N'Vaelahr]], a covert army.

In [[712 DR]], Aolis devised and supported the [[Spider's Truce]], a secret alliance with the [[drow]] of [[House Dhuurniv]] in exchange for the drow's possession of the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]]. Despite being viewed as traitors, the allied Dhuurniv–N'Vaelahr troops fought very well against the [[Army of Darkness]].

However, in [[Midwinter]]–[[Alturiak 1]] of [[713 DR]], Aolis fell alongside Matron Mother [[Laele Dhuurniv]], and the Spider Truce was ended. In that battle, Laele killed Aolis from behind but afterward was quickly killed by Amara Ildacer.

==Relationship==
Only Aolis and his wife knew the identities of the Councilors that supported the N'Vaelahr.

==Possessions==
Aolis gave to all his agents a ''[[kiira N'Vaelahr]]'' that bound the agent to Aolis and permitted telepathic communication to Aolis or Amara.
