        "mainbody": "Samanthiss was a medusa, or greater medusa by some accounts, who practiced wizardry and ran the Morden Winery in the Vast, alongside Vorlon, her maedar mate, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nLike other medusae, Samanthiss had a monstrous appearance and a head full of living snake hair.\nSamanthiss was a highly intelligent medusa and was considered an oddity among her kin. She lacked the vicious malice common among the medusae and preferred a studious lifestyle. Samanthiss happily stayed in seclusion from others and dedicated her time to magic and winemaking.\nAs a medusa, Samanthiss possessed a deadly petrifying gaze, and her serpentine snake hair had a venomous bite. She also used the same medusa poison to coat her arrows. As a mage, Samanthiss was a competent spellcaster and had access to a number of spells collected in the spellbooks she stored in the winery cellar. All of Samanthisss books were penned in an arcane language, unknown to those unfamiliar with such magics. The medusa knew how to sling spells from the fourth circle of magic and had such spells as feeblemind, phantasmal killer, vampiric touch, lightning bolt, and mirror image memorized, among others.\nTogether with her mate, Samanthiss could work magics that grew plants, trees, and henges and could summon and entrap various guardian plant creatures and beasts. Some of the creatures under the medusas command were local crows and her huge crow familiar called Stoner, who kept its attentive eye on the winery from high up in the air. The duo also kept two stray dogs who found a home at the winery, Merlot and Wander, as well as a collection of bloodthorns, thornslingers, and serpent vine snakes.\nSamanthisss most prized possessions were her spellbooks, priced at 4,000 gp if sold to such interested parties as Ravens Bluffs Wizards Guild.\nAlongside her husband, Vorlon, Samanthiss committed her life to studying and improving the art of winemakingâ€”something the couple found a passion in. Arcane magic was another passion of the medusa. She spent her days in the cellars underneath the winery, where she established a study, researching magic and creating variations of existing spells.\nSamanthiss and Vorlon hailed from the Cold Lands and the Bloodstone Lands. Vorlon suffered a loss of family at the hands of some adventurers early in his life, sending him onto a nomadic traveling life. Eventually, he came across Samanthiss, and the two became mates. Vorlon felt a strong familial affection and protectiveness for his mate because of the trauma and loss he suffered. Keeping them both alive was his goal in life.\nA couple of years after the , Samanthiss and Vorlon came across a newly rebuilt winery just outside of Dragon Falls in the Vast. The winery was run by a priest of Chauntea named Larn. Vorlon, a follower of the Earthmother himself, and Samanthiss were both impressed with the grapevines and the winerys well-maintained condition. Samanthiss took an opportunity to petrify Larn, allowing Vorlon to take over the priests identity. The couple continued running the winery for the following decade. Vorlon showed remorse over Larns fate but came to love winemaking. Larns stone body was kept in good condition for if the medusas ever needed food.\nVorlon and Samanthiss discovered a set of Books of the Master Winemaker that taught them everything they needed to know to produce quality wine. Samanthiss found the winerys extensive cellars and used them to house her study, where the medusa could hone her skill by day while hiding her monstrous appearance and caring for the grapevine by night. The new owners quickly mastered winemaking and began producing a variety of good-tasting wine, much more than they could ever hope to consume themselves.\nHowever, the winerys rightful owner, Shauna Morden of Ravens Bluff, discovered its existence after her father Charles Mordens death circa the . She renovated and reopened the Tavern of the Garden and was interested in using a family-owned winery. The young woman hired a group of capable adventurers of the Living City to investigate the presumably abandoned winery and its condition and establish a dialogue or partnership with its keepers, if there were any.\nWhen the adventurers reached Dragon Falls, they met the proprietor of the local Tavern of the Flagon Dragon and found out that the winery was supplying the establishment with cheap but quality wine and that the hermits who ran the winery had few other interactions with the locals. The group also met a local hero and druid defender, Keldar of the Forest, who knew of Samanthisss nature but did not consider the medusa and maedar to be disruptive to the natural balance and let them be. Subsequently, adventurers established a dialogue with the medusae, despite Vorlons misguided attempt to let the adventurers perish in a harpy encounter. Subsequently, the Morden Winery was returned to the Morden family, and, by some accounts, the maedar vintner was allowed to run the business by others, the medusas were slain. Larn was believed to have been released from the decade of being a statue. In one account of the events, Samanthiss and her mate were so grateful for the adventurers understanding they eagerly met with Shauna Morden and, when they were satisfied with the agreement that would let them work the winery in peace, they gifted the adventurers with copies of the Books of the Master Winemaker, as well as several other precious enchanted items and exotic precious wines."
