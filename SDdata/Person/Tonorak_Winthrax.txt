Tonorak Winthrax was a high priest of Helm in the Vilhon Reach in 1370 DR.
Tonorak gained renown when, around 1361 DR, he spoke against sending missionaries to Maztica, saying the duty of true followers of Helm was to guard and protect, no to go and fight in far lands.
In later years, Tonorak gained prominence inside the church of Helm in the Vilhon Reach, despite not being the regional leader.
