        "mainbody": "Halagothra was a healer and revered citizen of Tarmalune, who lived in the Great Port as of 1479 DR.\nIn her youth, Halagothra was considered an \"spitfire of a girl.\" As of 1479 DR, Halagothra was described as a wrinkled, crotchety old woman.\nHalagothra had healing powers similar to those of a priest, although none in the Windrise Ports, not even herself, knew the source of her abilities.\nFor this reason Halagothra was revered by the citizens of Tarmalune, to the point of killing anyone who tried to harm her on the spot. \nFor her services, Halagothra sometimes accepted payment in coin, but most of the time she demanded services (usually asking people to do something good for Tarmalune) instead.\nIn her youth, Halagothra was a cook and kitchen washing-maid in Tarmalune. One day she met a sailor from Ramekho, Rathloff, both fell in love and married. However, the day she bore him a son, Halagothra abandoned her family and returned to live alone in Tarmalune.\nA few years before 1479 DR, agents of Gauwervyndhal were sent to Tarmalune to kidnap her, however Halagothra was rescued thanks to the efforts of the Vigilant order. The mercenary Rathgar Malynd gave her a secure house and provided for personal guards to watch over her after this event.\nIn 1479 DR, Halagothra contacted a band of adventurers and asked them to stop the evil spellcaster Lekaral, who was conducting a foul ritual in Tarmalune. This eventually led to the destruction of the Cult of Reborn Flame.\nIn 1480 DR, after the adventurers and their companion Myrelas faced Pyrultimus, and were defeated and cursed with madness, they returned to Tarmalune seeking her help, but Halagothra was unable to help them. She then instructed them to enter the Raging Flame in order to cure themselves of their madness.\nAfter Rathloff went missing, Halagothra took care of Glindarra, her granddaughter."
