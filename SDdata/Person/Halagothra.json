        "mainbody": "'''Halagothra''' was a healer and revered citizen of [[Tarmalune]], who lived in the Great Port as of [[1479 DR]].",
        "Description": "In her youth, Halagothra was considered an \"spitfire of a girl.\" As of 1479 DR, Halagothra was described as a wrinkled, crotchety old woman.",
        "Activities": "Halagothra had healing powers similar to those of a [[priest]], although none in the [[Windrise Ports]], not even herself, knew the source of her abilities.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Pyrophobia|39}}\n\nFor this reason Halagothra was revered by the citizens of Tarmalune, to the point of killing anyone who tried to harm her on the spot. \n\nFor her services, Halagothra sometimes accepted payment in coin, but most of the time she demanded services (usually asking people to do something good for Tarmalune) instead.",
        "History": "In her youth, Halagothra was a cook and kitchen washing-maid in Tarmalune. One day she met a sailor from [[Ramekho]], [[Rathloff]], both fell in love and married. However, the day she bore him a son, Halagothra abandoned her family and returned to live alone in Tarmalune.\n\nA few years before 1479 DR, agents of [[Gauwervyndhal]] were sent to Tarmalune to kidnap her, however Halagothra was rescued thanks to the efforts of the [[Vigilant]] order. The mercenary [[Rathgar Malynd]] gave her a secure house and provided for personal guards to watch over her after this event.\n\nIn 1479 DR, Halagothra contacted a band of [[adventurer]]s and asked them to stop the [[evil]] [[spellcaster]] [[Lekaral]], who was conducting a foul [[ritual]] in Tarmalune.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stirring the Embers|5}} This eventually led to the destruction of the [[Cult of Reborn Flame]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Quench the Fire of the Raging God|40-48}}\n\nIn [[1480 DR]], after the adventurers and their companion [[Myrelas]] faced [[Inar Venenellin|Pyrultimus]], and were defeated and cursed with madness, they returned to Tarmalune seeking her help, but Halagothra was unable to help them.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Pyrophobia|14-17}} She then instructed them to enter the [[Achazar|Raging Flame]] in order to cure themselves of their madness.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Pyrophobia|21}}\n\nAfter Rathloff went missing, Halagothra took care of [[Glindarra]], her granddaughter.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Quench the Fire of the Raging God|34-36}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/Quench the Fire of the Raging God|48}}"
