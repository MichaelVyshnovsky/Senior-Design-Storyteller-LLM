        "mainbody": "'''Grypht''' was a [[saurial]] [[mage]] from the same tribe as [[Dragonbait]].\nHe was larger than other saurials and resembled an anthropomorphic [[triceratops]].\n\nAfter most of his tribe were possessed by [[Moander]], he traveled from his own dimension to [[Toril]], using a transference spell to take the place of [[Elminster]]. This placed him at the center of [[Finder]]'s trial. He was attacked by [[Kyre]], who was also possessed by Moander, and trapped in a [[soul gem]]. When Kyre tried and failed to capture [[Akabar]], the latter freed Grypht from the soul gem, believing it might house Elminster. Akabar was knocked unconscious during the fight. Grypht fled with Akabar for his own protection.\n\nHowever, [[Breck Orcsbane]] was convinced that Grypht was a monster who'd murdered Kyre. A party including Breck and Dragonbait tracked down Grypht and he was nearly killed before Breck accepted that he was not a [[demon]].\n\nGrypht then played an important subsidiary role in the battle against Moander, using magic to create walls of spells and free other saurials from possession.\n\nAfter Moander's death, Grypht remained with his tribe in the [[Lost Vale]]."
