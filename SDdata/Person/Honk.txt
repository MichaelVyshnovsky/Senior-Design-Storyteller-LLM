{{Quote|''Jablooda!''|Tender Honk}}

==Description==
Tender Honk was a gruff and unfriendly [[half-orcish]] man with a shaggy mop of brown hair. He offered sub-par service to the tavern's guests.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Tender [[Henk]] ran The Singing Lute, a tiny waterside tavern that overlooked the [[Counting House]] and the city's [[Gray Harbor]]. Honk, a fellow half-orc who had a similar appearance and attitude to Henk's, was known to tend to The Singing Lute when Henk was indisposed. Their similarities implied a blood relation. Honk insisted that Henk played his [[lute]] in the kitchen during the off hours.
