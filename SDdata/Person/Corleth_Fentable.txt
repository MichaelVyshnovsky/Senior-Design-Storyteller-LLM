'''Corleth Fentable''' was an official in [[Suzail]].

==Activities==
Corleth was an understeward in [[Cormyr]]'s government.

==History==
Around [[1479 DR]], he was held in thrall by [[Manshoon]]. Together with the [[War Wizard of Cormyr]] [[Rorskryn Mreldrake]], Corleth was summoned by Manshoon to the shop of [[Immaero Sraunter]] to receive his orders.

Later at the start of the [[Council of the Dragon]] profiting of a moment of chaos the [[ghost]] of [[Alusair Obarskyr]] possessed his body.

Next time Manshoon checked Fentable's mind he found in total disarray and decided to abandon him but meantime discovered [[Elminster Aumar]] alive.

Later he regained his mind and went to check the battle at the house of [[Larak Dardulkyn]]. There he briefly met [[Mirt]].

In [[1480 DR]] Manshoon compelled the disgraced suspected traitor Palace Understeward to flee the palace and put Corleth in the basement of the Srauner's shop [[polymorph]]ed as a mind-wiped woman in order to use him as substitute body in time of need.

At last Elminster found Manshoon and accidentally destroyed Corleth's body in the battle.
