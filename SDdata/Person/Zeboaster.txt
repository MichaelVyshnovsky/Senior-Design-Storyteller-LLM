'''Zeboaster the Blunt''' was a [[sage]] who hailed from [[Ordulin]] in [[Sembia]] in the 1350s [[DR]].

==Personality==
Zeboaster had a distinguished and effete nature, notorious for his sarcasm, wit, and overly honest comments.

==Skills==
His particular specialty was [[human]] history and theology around the [[Dragonreach]].

==Description==
He perfumed his beard.

==History==
Zeboaster argued that stiff-necked chivalry was an anachronistic relic of a simpler and more primitive time and the traditional [[knight]] or [[cavalier]] was obsolete. He did so in the royal court of King [[Azoun IV]] of [[Cormyr]], noted cavalier. Zeboaster soon went back on the road.

Zeboaster once named the god of suffering [[Ilmater]] "the Stupid God"

He called the [[zulkir]]s of [[Thay]] the "Dumb Wizards of Thay" after they failed to conquer [[Rashemen]].

Zeboaster once attempted a prank in the presence of [[Vangerdahast]] of [[Cormyr]] by falsifying a mage's sigil, and brought upon himself the ''[[Trifold Curse of Mystra]]''. A glowing apparition followed him about for some time, pointing and accusing "Falsely done!" which rather spoiled dinner parties he attended.<ref>

Zeboaster nicknamed the [[Council of Seven Burghers]] of [[Harrowdale]] the "Council of Seven Stones" after its members paid no attention to his suggestions to put a little life in the town.<ref>

After the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], Zeboaster described the transition of the followers of the god of the dead [[Myrkul]] to the new [[Cyric]] as "merely changing the name on the letterhead and putting a purple sunburst around the skull outside the temples." The Myrkulytes called him "Zeboaster the Still Aliveâ€”For Now".<ref>

Zeboaster, perhaps predictably, went missing in late 1358 DR. He had actually gone into hiding.
