Zeboaster the Blunt was a sage who hailed from Ordulin in Sembia in the 1350s DR.
Zeboaster had a distinguished and effete nature, notorious for his sarcasm, wit, and overly honest comments.
His particular specialty was human history and theology around the Dragonreach.
He perfumed his beard.
Zeboaster argued that stiff-necked chivalry was an anachronistic relic of a simpler and more primitive time and the traditional knight or cavalier was obsolete. He did so in the royal court of King Azoun IV of Cormyr, noted cavalier. Zeboaster soon went back on the road.
Zeboaster once named the god of suffering Ilmater "the Stupid God"
He called the zulkirs of Thay the "Dumb Wizards of Thay" after they failed to conquer Rashemen.
Zeboaster once attempted a prank in the presence of Vangerdahast of Cormyr by falsifying a mages sigil, and brought upon himself the Trifold Curse of Mystra. A glowing apparition followed him about for some time, pointing and accusing "Falsely done!" which rather spoiled dinner parties he attended.
Zeboaster nicknamed the Council of Seven Burghers of Harrowdale the "Council of Seven Stones" after its members paid no attention to his suggestions to put a little life in the town.
After the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, Zeboaster described the transition of the followers of the god of the dead Myrkul to the new Cyric as "merely changing the name on the letterhead and putting a purple sunburst around the skull outside the temples." The Myrkulytes called him "Zeboaster the Still Aliveâ€”For Now".
Zeboaster, perhaps predictably, went missing in late 1358 DR. He had actually gone into hiding.
