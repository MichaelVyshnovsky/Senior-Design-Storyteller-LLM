Anithlynn was a mystic of the Earthmother and a shopkeeper in Skullport.
Anithlynn was born with Briglynn and Kaitlynn on board a Moonshae Isles ship to a mystic of the Earthmother, Celya, who lost most of her energy in childbirth. The triplets were taught from birth the mysteries of mystics. By their thirteenth birthday, Celya had died.
Anithlynn managed with her sisters the Sisters Three Waxworks. She was the master of potions.
Anithlynn was the most cunning of the triplets and the least predictable. She was selfish and ambitious, living strong passions and hatreds. She sometimes manipulated her sisters, but genuinely loved them.
