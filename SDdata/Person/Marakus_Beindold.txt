'''Marakus Beindold''' was a [[Master Merchant]] of the village of [[Hlintar]] in [[the Vast]] in the 13th century [[DR]].

==History==
Around the midâ€“13th century [[DR]],<ref group="note">The [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)|''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting: A Grand Tour of the Realms'' (2nd edition, revised)]] states this occurred "well over a hundred winters" before [[1367 DR]], implying a date before [[1267 DR]], while ''[[The City of Ravens Bluff]]'' says only "almost a hundred winters" before [[1370 DR]], implying a date after [[1270 DR]]. Marakus Beindold was Master Merchant of the village of Hlintar when he sought to annex the hills east of the town, and thereby expand Hlintar's farmland and enrich himself. However, these lands were traditionally occupied by the local [[dwarves]]. Therefore, Beindold invited the leaders of the dwarven communities to the [[Hornmoot]] trading festival, welcomed them as guests, and put on a feast for them. However, the [[wine]] was drugged, and Beindold had hired mercenaries to forcibly occupy the village before the dwarves arrived. He had the dwarves brutally murdered in their beds as they slept.

A few dwarves escaped, however, and a tenday later they returned, avoided Beindold's guards, and caught him in his own bedchamber to return his hospitality. With their hammers, they broke every single bone and joint in his body.

Beindold was discovered the next morning, hideously beaten and crippled in a pool of his own blood. He survived the experience, but only just, and a number of local [[cleric]]s worked hard and at great financial cost to save him.

Every dwarven native of Hlintar left the village and never returned, and no other dwarf visited there again by [[1370 DR]]. They boycotted all trade with Hlintar.

The [[Beindold's Busted Bones]] inn was named for the grisly event.

==Personality==
Marakus Beindold was corrupt, greedy, ambitious, and evil.
