        "mainbody": "'''Angaar,''' son of [[Raag]], was a [[Reghedmen]] [[warrior]] of the [[Tribe of the Wolf]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]], who joined the [[Tribe of the Great Wyrm]] under the leadership of reanimated King [[Wylfdene]] to wage war on the [[Ten-Towns]].\n\n{{Quote|''So, the spineless fishmongers want peace, do they? Hmph. If they had any backbone, they'd stand before Wylfdene themselves. Instead, they send a stranger...''|Angaar of the [[Tribe of the Great Wyrm]]}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, [[Icasaracht]], an ancient [[undead]] [[dragon]], reanimated the course of a great [[barbarian]] leader, Wylfdene Wylfdene and Icasaracht raised a great army to conquer Icewind Dale and destroy the settlements of the Ten Towns. The new tribe was named the [[Tribe of the Great Wyrm]] and assembled members of other tribes of the north.\n\nWhen Wylfdene's Tribe of the Great Wyrm moved south towards [[Kelvin's Cairn]] and set up a war camp near [[Lonelywood]], the speakers of Ten Towns saw the looming war â€“ a familiar sight and hired an assassin to pose as a Ten Towns representative. Angaar was the camp guard who stood watch of the main gate. He went to the \"representative\" and witnessed what would soon occur. The assassin was discovered, tortured, and murdered during a meeting with Wylfdene, his head placed on a [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] as a warning, and the security was tightened. Angaar witnessed the meeting and torture, and it unnerved him. He believed that under torture, the representative of the Ten Towns would've confessed to anything just to end the suffering. When the [[Heroes of Icewind Dale]] were summoned to aid the Ten Towns, Angaar coldly greeted the heroes and accompanied them to the camp in their attempt to negotiate. The meeting ended poorly, and Wylfdene ordered them to be executed, and Angaar was to see it done along with six other Reghedmen. It was unknown if the heroes and Angaar battled eachother, resulting in his death, or if they negotiated their way out of the cruel order. However, one thing was sure: Angaar told the heroes of where Wylfdene's [[shaman]] was exiled to, the [[Burial Isle]], stating that eventually, [[Hjollder]] would either starve to death or die of cold."
