'''Thunderstorm''' was a [[human]] warrior who wandered the Realms as a nomad mercenary in the mid–14th century [[DR]].Thunderstorm is called a "nomad mercenary", but it is unclear if "nomad" simply describes his travels or if it means he hails from a nomad tribe.

==History==
Thunderstorm was orphaned when he was a young child and had been on his own since his teenage years.

By [[1356 DR]], he traveled [[Faerûn]], seeking battles to fight in and what rewards he could win. He survived many battles to become a veteran warrior by the 1360s [[DR]].

In the [[1385 DR|Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR]], riding his horse, Thunderstorm fled the onrushing effects of the [[Spellplague]], alongside several wild animals.<ref>

==Skills==
His great agility helped him defend himself.

==Possessions==
He fought with a ''[[longsword]] +3'', a [[shield]], and a ''[[javelin of lightning]]'', and wore a ''[[girdle of stone giant strength]]''. He commonly rode a [[horse]].
