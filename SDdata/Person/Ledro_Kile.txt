'''Ledro Kile''' was an [[elf]] [[mage]] and apprentice to [[Briella Farthing]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who died while on an expedition in the [[Shining Sea]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|20}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|21}} sometime around the month of [[Flamerule]], a group of eccentric entertainers, entrepreneurs, and scientists embarked upon a colonizing expedition to an island they discovered in the Shining Sea off the coast of [[Chult]], which they dubbed the "[[Forgotten Island]]". Led by a charismatic [[Waukeenar]] [[priest]] named [[Devlin (Ravens Bluff)|Devlin]], they sought to create a tourist attraction on the isle that would attract people from all across the Realms.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2,4}} Three months later, things began to go awry for the expedition.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2}}

On [[Marpenoth 11]], five [[velociraptor]]s infected with [[olive slime]]s attacked the camp's messhall. The group managed to slay them all, but not without the [[fighter]] [[Argus]] dying and the fighter [[Mallus]] becoming injured.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|22}}

Over the course of the next three days, the group became infected with olive slimes due to close proximity with Mallus, who had contracted an infection from the velociraptors.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|7}} Ledro Kile was seemingly the first to succumb to the infection, as on [[Marpenoth 17]] he was observed by Devlin eating raw a [[dinosaur]] in the center of camp alongside Mallus.

On the night of the third day, [[Marpenoth 19]],{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|7}} Finding bits of olive slime on all of their bodies, Devlin worked to scrape the [[ooze]] off them. He burned the scrapings in a wicker basket and then proceeded to burn the bodies of everyone inside the barracks. Before hanging himself the next day, Ledro Kile's name and the names of the rest of the expedition crew would be recorded by Devlin in the last entry of his diary.

Two days later, [[Marpenoth 22]],{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|8}}
