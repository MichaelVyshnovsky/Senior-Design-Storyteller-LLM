'''Meryl Vyrmoth''' was the [[halfling]] cook of [[Qilué Veladorn]] at the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]].
 
==History==
Meryl had been Qilué's cook for decades and knew well all the inhabitants of the Promenade.

In [[1379 DR]], he spoke with [[Cavatina Xarann]], expressing his worries about Qilué's mental health, because the lady had acted very strangely in recent times. However, soon after, Cavatina understood that Meryl had been replaced by a [[dretch]] and raised the alarm.
 
Later the real Meryl was found unharmed.
