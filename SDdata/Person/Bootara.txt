'''Bootara''' was a [[wind spirit]] who resided on the [[Fire Mountain]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century DR, the tribes of the Living Jungle, as well as the [[Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba]], believed that Bootara was responsible for black clouds being stirred around the Fire Mountain, and bringing forth the storms. Like other spirits of Malatra, Bootara was an [[elemental]] creature of unknown age.
