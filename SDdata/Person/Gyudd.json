        "mainbody": "Gyudd was a master brewer in Skullport.\nGyudd had been haunted by the Melairkyn ghosts in his dreams for most of his life. Shaken and overwhelmed by the responsibility, he started to drink heavily, and this quieted the ghosts.\nGyudd typically wore a leather apron over a short-sleeved tunic and rough breeches. He also owned a pair of enchanted hob-nailed boots, passed down to him by his great-grandfather on the mans deathbed, that functioned similarly to a pair of boots of the north. He rarely walked around heavily armed, instead preferring to have a dagger or knife tucked away in his belt for emergencies.\nGyudd ran Gyudds Distillery. In his free time, he was always in a bar drinking.\nGuydd was the last member of the Melairkyn dwarves and a direct descendant of King Melair IV.\nGyudd arrived in Skullport circa 1310 DR and soon started his brewery and distillery. However, some time after the Melairkyn ghosts started to appear, Gyudd tried to silence them by becoming more and more drunk.\nIn 1375 DR Gyudds dreams became too strong after the earthquake following the Halasters death. He sold his business and hired an adventuring party to accompany him to the Belkrams Fall citadel inside Undermountain.\nHe was still in operation as successful brewer during the early 1490s DR."
