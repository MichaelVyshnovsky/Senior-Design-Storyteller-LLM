Dolare was a priestess of Mystra active in the Thayan city of Bezantur in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She oversaw the operations of the secret Temple of Mystra in the city, and was responsible for ensuring that the temples existence was kept secret from its enemies. She personally maintained the wards that kept the temple hidden and safe.
Dolare was an enemy of the Red Wizards who ruled Bezantur and who had outlawed worship of Mystra and other gods of magic in a bid to jealously guard their magical secrets. By extension, she was a friend to the Red Wizards enemies, and provided refuge within her temple to dissidents, escaped slaves, and Harpers.
