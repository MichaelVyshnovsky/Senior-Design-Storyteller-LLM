'''Dolare''' was a [[priestess]] of [[Mystra]] active in the [[Thayan]] city of [[Bezantur]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
She oversaw the operations of the secret [[Temple of Mystra (Bezantur)|Temple of Mystra]] in the city, and was responsible for ensuring that the temple's existence was kept secret from its enemies. She personally maintained the [[ward]]s that kept the temple hidden and safe.

==Relationships==
Dolare was an enemy of the [[Red Wizards]] who ruled Bezantur and who had outlawed worship of Mystra and other [[gods]] of [[magic]] in a bid to jealously guard their magical secrets. By extension, she was a friend to the Red Wizards' enemies, and provided refuge within her temple to dissidents, escaped slaves, and [[Harpers]].
