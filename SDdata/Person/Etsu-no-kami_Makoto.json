Yasutoki held a small [[shoen]] until a plot in the provincial capital of [[Tamanokuni]] forced the [[shugo-daimyo]] to banish all the family and Yasutoki's position went to [[Inoue Kanemori]] of the [[Inoue clan]].\n\nIn 1357 DR, Yasutoki died and Makoto with his friend [[Saisho]] went back to Miyama in search of adventure."
