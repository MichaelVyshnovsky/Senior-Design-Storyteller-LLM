Only one last test remained between the trio and the full membership - the Knights Trial. The trio of squires was sent to the Lonely Barrens of the Delimbiyr Vale, to slay the feared beast - the Mighty Rat of Cunning Demeanor. When the squires entered the beasts lair, the intelligent and cunning rat lured them to the \"dining room\" inside its cavern and sent a swarm of hungry vermin to devour the young knights.\nThe trio escaped certain death with the experience leaving them traumatized, terrified, and panicked. Launfals grim face was streaked with tears and. By a stroke of luck the Hero of Daggerford happened upon the distraught knights-to-be and agreed to help slaying the horrific creature. The Hero was successful in ridding the land of MRCDs ferocious swarm. However, the rat was not slain. Instead, the creature was convinced to surrender itself to the squires and be taken to Waterdeep as a prisoner. When the Hero brought the sentient vermin out, wrapped in a piece of cloth, Launfal was calmed by the rats cuteness.\nSquires thanked the Hero, and departed the Lonely Barrens in anticipation of being knighted and treated as brave heroes."
