'''Staernel Thonok''' was a well-known founder of the wealthy [[Thonok]] family of [[Amn]], who lived many years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Staernel came to prominence for his impressive business acumen, mercantile intelligence, and infamous dabbling in the art of necromancy. During the family's rise to power, Staernel Thonok was the builder of the family's fine estate, [[Staerngates]], in [[Purskul]]. The family founder's life was believed to had been ended by some unknown necromantic magics, while some claimed that the research granted Staernel undeath. Purskul's rumor mill claimed that, as of the late 14{{th}} century DR, Staernel Thonok was still haunting subterranean granary passages under the town in the form of a terrifying undead "thing." Even though many thought it to be just a tale, the creature's existence was confirmed to be true by [[Elminster]].
