Morningdawn was an archdruid in the service of the Emerald Enclave in the late 15 century DR.
Morningdawn sensed a menace approaching and went to Protectors Enclave in Neverwinter to erect the Tree of Elemental Balance in order to protect the city. She also asked the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to help Minsc investigate the Ebon Downs, where she sensed evil at work (in fact the Cult of the Black Earth and the Cult of the Crushing Wave).
