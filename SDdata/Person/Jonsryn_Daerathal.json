        "mainbody": "'''Jonsryn Daerathal''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|887}} to 902 DR.",
        "Description": "Jonsryn was described as handsome.",
        "Personality": "He was debauched and cold-blooded.",
        "Possessions": "Jonsryn cached all the magic he found, except for an array of ''[[healing potion]]s'' at his belt and a single wand or scepter, which changed over time as he found better equipment.",
        "History": "Before becoming the [[Magister]] Jonsryn Daerathal was a debauched man best known for hunting sorcerous rivals, and for other indiscriminate assassinations of mages, which spared neither senior court mages nor fledglings: he often resorted to poison, or to crushing them with translocated boulders in their sleep. He moved continuously throughout his career, and the killings did not stop nor slow down during his tenure as the Magister, which earned him the ire of [[Mystra]]. Despite her sending him nightmares of an afterlife where fiends would eat his limbs again and again, from which he often woke up screaming, he never slowed down until his death in {{yearlink|902}}, when he was vaporized by [[Taline Telgara]]. He smiled as he died.",
        "Rumors": "The origins of Jonsryn Daerathal were unknown, with some sages claiming he was from [[Nimbral]] and others that he was a highborn [[Mulhorandi]] that was enslaved in [[Calimshan]]."
