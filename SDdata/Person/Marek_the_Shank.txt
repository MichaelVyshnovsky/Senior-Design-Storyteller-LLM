'''Marek the Shank''' was a [[hobgoblin]] of [[Ship Rethnor]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in [[1485 DR]].

==Possessions==
Dressed in [[studded leather]], Marek used a [[longsword]] and [[shield]], or wielded  a [[shortbow]] in battle.

==History==
Marek was a hobgoblin [[fighter]] member of Ship Rethnor in [[Luskan]]. He and his friend [[Slim]] were the main leaders of the Rethnor men that followed [[Vaelish Gant]] in Icewind Dale. They started a protection racket in [[Bryn Shander]] and supported Vaelish in his political plot.

In [[Eleint 20]], they stole [[silver]] weapons ordered by the [[Harper]] [[Aarun]] from [[Dunavan]]'s warehouse. On [[Highharvestide]], Silm and Marek kidnapped the Speaker of Bryn Shander, [[Duvessa Shane]], on the day of an election and Vaelish proposed himself as a substitute while pretending to be reluctant.
