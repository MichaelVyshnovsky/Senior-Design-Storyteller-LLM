A low-ranking member of the Guard of the city of Tantras in the Vast was a man-at-arms. It is not clear what name to give a member of the Guard of this level. The term "man-at-arms" has been adopted based on the description in the Tantras adventure module. The term "warrior" is similarly possible from both the module and the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (2nd edition).
Regular soldiers of the Guard were outfitted in blue oiled plate mail armor emblazoned with the coat of arms of Tantras three silver stars over a silver breaking wave on a field of royal blue, called the "blue and silver". They carried spears, short swords, and daggers. Some, crossbowmen, could carry light crossbows.
These soldiers patrolled in units of fourteen, led by a sergeant.
