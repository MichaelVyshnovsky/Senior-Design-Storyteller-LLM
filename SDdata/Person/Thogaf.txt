Thogaf was a human wizard who found himself imprisoned in the Fortress of the Five Vultures in Calaunt.
Thogaf was a tan-skinned man with long, brown hair, dressed in a green shirt. He had blue eyes, and slightly elongated ears.
Among Thogafs possessions were two ioun stones one deep red that made him more dexterous, and one dusty rose that offered him slight protection.
Whilst imprisoned in the dungeons of the Fortress of the Five Vultures, Thogaf befriended an ancient wizard named Yrlamar. Bereft of his spellbook, Yrlamar was unable to escape, but he was still able to school Thogaf in the field of magic.
