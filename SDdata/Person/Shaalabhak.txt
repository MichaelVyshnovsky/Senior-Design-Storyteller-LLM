Shaalabhak was a illithid in the Plane of Shadow in 1374 DR. 
Shaalabhak was a mind flayer that out of nowhere appeared in Vast Swamp offering its service to Despayr in his plot. Even since Shaalabhak served the Sharran dragon loyally but its motivation remained a mystery, sure it had no devotion to Shar or other gods. Its main interest seem to observe the creation of the tear in the Weave. In truth it regularly reported the progress to its fellows in Toril using it plane shift ability. Possibly it was defeated by an adventurers party.
