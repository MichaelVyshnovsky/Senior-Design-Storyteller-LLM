'''Shaalabhak''' was a [[illithid]] in the [[Plane of Shadow]] in [[1374 DR]]. 

==History==
Shaalabhak was a mind flayer that out of nowhere appeared in [[Vast Swamp]] offering its service to [[Despayr]] in his plot. Even since Shaalabhak served the Sharran dragon loyally but its motivation remained a mystery, sure it had no devotion to [[Shar]] or other gods. Its main interest seem to observe the creation of the tear in the [[Weave]]. In truth it regularly reported the progress to its fellows in [[Toril]] using it ''[[plane shift]]'' ability. Possibly it was defeated by an adventurers party.
