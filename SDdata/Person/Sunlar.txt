Sunlar was the high priest of Mystras temple in Deepingdale during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He was a strikingly handsome man, with strong features. He had wavy brown hair and blue-white eyes that gave off an otherworldly impression.
At some point, Sunlar took notable interest in one of his temples students named Midnight and personally oversaw her instruction in the arcane arts.
