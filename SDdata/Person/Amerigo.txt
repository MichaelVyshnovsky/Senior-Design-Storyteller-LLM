Amerigo was a human soldier in the Golden Legion during their invasion of Maztica
Amerigo had tan skin and a thin, black beard. He wore a heavy leather cape over his clothes, and a plumed Amnian helmet atop his head.
He had no qualms about conquering Maztica, and went about his work with a strong sense of duty and loyalty, which in turn earned him many loyal friends. Amerigo was rather ambitious, and worked hard hoping to gain promotions.
In addition to a series of polearms, Amerigo owned a suit of leather armor and a ring of protection.
