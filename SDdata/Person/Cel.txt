'''Cel''' was a fisherman in the [[Kabel's Hill]] community in [[Quivering Forest]] in [[1489 DR]].

==Personality==
The fisherman was a taciturn but not rude person. He always gave the shortest answer possible, so sometimes others needed time to understand his responses.

==Activities==
He worked as fisherman or in transporting villagers' goods up and down the river. If he had passengers, he also acted as a boatman to [[Sorcerer's Isle]].
