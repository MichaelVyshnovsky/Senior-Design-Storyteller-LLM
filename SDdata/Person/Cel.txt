Cel was a fisherman in the Kabels Hill community in Quivering Forest in 1489 DR.
The fisherman was a taciturn but not rude person. He always gave the shortest answer possible, so sometimes others needed time to understand his responses.
He worked as fisherman or in transporting villagers goods up and down the river. If he had passengers, he also acted as a boatman to Sorcerers Isle.
