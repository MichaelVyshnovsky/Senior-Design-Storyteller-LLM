        "mainbody": "'''Kestutis''' was a [[human]] [[knight]] that lived on [[Tuern]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Kestutis was an aged man with medium-long blond hair and blue eyes.",
        "Possessions": "The knight owned the unique ''[[armor of the glacier]]'' armor set, which he wore during his service.",
        "History": "In his prime, he was a knight in service to the Kings of [[Gundarlun]] and [[Tuern]], known islands in the [[Frozenfar]]. Kestutis made the bold move of advancing into the territory of the local [[fire giant]]s. He risked his life to enter the blazing volcanic vents and pin down the location of the fire giants that terrorized all of [[Uttersea]]. For his grand service, his monarch bestowed upon him an ancient fortress nearby.\n\nHowever, in [[1358 DR]], the knight was captured by a group of pirates. He was gagged and thrown into the corner of a room in his fort. The bound Kestutis was later found and rescued by the future [[Heroes of Ascore]], and they told the equally heroic knight of their mission. He praised them for their valor and prowess, and thanked them for risking their lives for the people of the [[North]], as he once did. Kestutis bestowed upon the heroes the ''armor of the glacier'', an enchanted armor set that provided great protection against [[fire]] and fire-based creatures."
