In 1369 DR, Lhaeo, scribe to Elminster of Shadowdale, hired them to to rescue the missing Randal Morn. First, they searched inside the tomb of Shraevyn but found only undead, Zhentarim, and a note from Randal that directed the Company to the Spiderhaunt Wood. Meanwhile, they managed to recover the Sword of the Dales. However, in Spiderhant, Temeron found no trails to Randal Morn. At last, a large group of undead attacked them and only Temeron survived.\nHowever, poisoned, Temeron was on the verge of death when he met another adventuring party at the point where the Arachnid Pathway broke free of Spiderhaunt. He gave to them the sword and the mission and finally died."
