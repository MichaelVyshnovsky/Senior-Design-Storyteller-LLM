        "mainbody": "'''Isyan Kiy'sisnos''' was a [[moon elf]] [[bladesinger]] of the city of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was a [[Scion of the Green Regent]] and the [[Gauntlet (title)|Gauntlet of the Western Marches]], with the duty of commanding the [[Loudwater Guard]] and defending Loudwater's territory to the west, and as such was based at [[High Lord's Hall]] and in the [[Western Tower]].<ref><ref group=\"note\" name=\"gender\">Isyan's gender is ambiguous, with masculine and feminine pronouns used interchangeably, even within the same sentences, though the latter pronouns are more common and the description is otherwise typically feminine. This inconsistency may be in error, possibly being a remnant of incomplete revisions. Regardless, this article will try to preserve this variation.",
        "History": "Isyan was a minor noble of one of Loudwater's ancient elven houses. A member of the Loudwater Guard, Isyan had dealings with the bandits known as the [[Half-Elven Renegades]] for many years and knew well of them.\n\nAt the ceremony for the choosing of the [[Green Regent]] on [[Shieldmeet]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Isyan was among the volunteers and was accepted as a Scion.{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/What is the Green Regent}}\n\nIsyan later replacedThough Jaida was introduced as Gauntlet in the ''Extermination'' and ''Gray Hunt'' adventures, she was replaced by Isyan in ''Nurture and Nature'' with no explanation for the change. While some adventure modules in ''Legacy of the Green Regent'' are missing, ''Nurture and Nature'' is likely Isyan's first intended appearance. in [[Eleasis]]/[[Eleint]] of that year. At only around 140 years in age, she was surprisingly young for such a role. Isyan soon after began an inspection of the city's defenses, such as by checking for rot in the wooden palisade and for erosion of the earthen embankment.",
        "Personality": "Although a moon elf by blood, Isyan was a lot like a [[sun elf]] in nature. He was aloof, cool, and haughty; impeccable in manner; and dedicated to duty. This included championing [[Mielikki]] as a Scion of the Green Regent, which was a role she took seriously even while being a faithful follower of [[Corellon Larethian]].\n\nIsyan had little patience for fools and spoke his mind freely and directly, being unafraid to voice criticisms and suspicions in public. The only friendliness shown to strangers was to fellow Scions. While she did not like [[orc]]s, after the [[Gray Migrations]] and the High Lord's [[Decree of Reception]], she gradually came to accept the [[High Forest orc]]s' presence in Loudwater and their right to exist, though he remained uncomfortable with them as allies and neighbors.",
        "Description": "Isyan was strikingly beautiful, with an athletic and feminine figure, and moved with precision and balance reminiscent of a dancer, or rather, a capable warrior. Isyan had dark hair, grown long and bound in the back with fine [[silver]] cords. While a Scion of the Green Regent, Isyan bore the holy symbol of Mielikki upon her brow, glowing emerald.",
        "Possessions": "Isyan wore a well-fitted suit of ''[[elven chain]]''."
