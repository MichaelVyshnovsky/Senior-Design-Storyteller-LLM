Melori Ostur () was a sergeant of the City Watch.
Around 1491 DR, Melori led a City Watch patrol that arrived at the Wave and Wink dance hall after an arson attack on Zora Tiega Gos. He immediately arrested Kata Brizik and forcibly shut the Wave and Wink down.
Melori was willing to arrest a woman without investigating, just to show off to nobles and impress his superiors in the watch.
