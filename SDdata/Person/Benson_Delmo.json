        "mainbody": "'''Benson Delmo''' was the mayor of [[Maldobar]] in [[1340 DR]].",
        "Description": "Delmo was \"obese\" and cheerful.",
        "History": "In [[1340 DR]], Mayor Benson Delmo and several other residents of [[Maldobar]] arrived at the [[Thistledown (family)|Thistledown]] house, where Bartholomew Thistledown's children told them of their encounter with the [[drow]] [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. The local hunter, [[Roddy McGristle]], cast skepticism over [[Connor Thistledown]]'s claim and insisted on leading a search party to verify it. Despite calls to summon a [[ranger]], Delmo put off the request, believing it to be too premature. Sure enough, McGristle encountered the drow and was scarred in the attempt, giving Delmo no other option but to send a missive to Sundabar.\n\nA few days later, the Thistledown family of Maldobar was found murdered. It was believed that Drizzt had done the deed (when in fact [[Ulgulu]] had done it). Though McGristle desired to go after Drizzt immediately, Delmo was concerned that the drow's presence was the sign of a larger war band, and negotiated a reward of 2,000 [[gold piece]]s for the head of the drow. He also convinced McGristle to wait for [[Dove Falconhand]]'s party to arrive from [[Sundabar]] before initiating pursuit."
