'''Galen''' was a male [[human]] who visited the village of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Galen was a traveling merchant who bought and sold things along the [[Sword Coast]]. He had regular clients, among them being [[Daeghun Farlong]]. During the Harvest Fair in West Harbor in [[1374 DR]], Galen delivered a [[bow]] to Daeghun, in exchange for the furs Daeghun hunted. He also part of the Fair's Knave's Challenge. Eventually, Galen made it to the [[Weeping Willow]] inn. However, he and his bodyguards had to fight [[bladeling]]s and [[duergar]] that attacked the villagers. Eventually, he was mugged by the same bodyguards, who demanded a bigger payment.
