'''SiNafay Hun'ett''' was the Matron Mother of [[House Hun'ett]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Thinking [[House Do'Urden]] posed a threat, she attacked it with the help of [[Bregan D'aerthe]] in the {{YearlinkName|1328}}. But with [[Jarlaxle]]'s betrayal, her house was defeated and punished by the ruling council of [[Menzoberranzan]].

After that, Matron Hun'ett became a member of House Do'Urden under a new name, '''Shi'nayne Do'Urden'''.

She was later tricked and sacrificed to [[Lolth]] by Matron [[Malice Do'Urden]] for the [[Zin-carla]] ritual to resurrect [[Zaknafein Do'Urden|Zaknafein]] in the {{YearlinkName|1338}}.

==Description==
She was particularly diminutive, even by drow standards, standing just over four feet tall.
