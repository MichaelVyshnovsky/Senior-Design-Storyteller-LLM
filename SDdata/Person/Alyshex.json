        "mainbody": "Alyshex was a half-orc merchant who operated out of Airspur, in Akan√ªl, in the late 15 century DR. \nAlyshex was described as a beautiful half-orc.\nAlyshex was querulous and unscrupulous, but she was also intelligent. She was willing to do anything to get her way and she only looked out for herself.\nAlyshex was a direct descendant of Khrulis, the last ruler of ancient Airspur.\nAlyshex was a weapons merchant who lived in Airspur as of 1479 DR. While she didnt act openly against the government of Airspur, she was threat for them, as she was always looking for opportunities to usurp power.\nWhile she was capable of defending herself, she preferred to employ easily influenced adventurers or local thugs to achieve her goals."
