He famously led his fellow Dalesmen during the [[Second battle of Shadowdale]], fighting alongside the renowned [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]] against the conquering army of the [[Zhentilar]] led by the mortal [[avatar]] of the god [[Bane]].",
        "Description": "He had notable light skin and dirty blonde hair.",
        "History": "Bishop led the vanguard of the Dales' forces during the battle of [[Shadowdale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. He and his men faced overwhelming odds, and became trapped between two battalions of Zhentilar forces. \n\nWhen the hero Kelemvor Lyonsbane was busy fighting [[Ronglath Knightsbridge]], Bishop saved his life by deflecting a Zhent dagger aimed directly at him. The two warriors fought alongside one another for some time, wading through the Zhent soldiers as their odds of victory seemed more and more insurmountable. They led their men through chaotic battle long enough to endure however, when the [[Riders of Mistledale]] and [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] adventuring band arrived as reinforcements."
