'''Flamewind''' was a fast horse in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Originally belonging to [[Belgon Bradaskor]] of [[Scornubel]], it was given to [[Sharantyr]] in {{yearlink|1357}}.

==Personality==
Though it recoiled at the smell of blood, it was well-trained and didn't bolt.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|182-183|11}}

==Abilities==
The horse was fast and hearty, a princely gift.

==History==
After [[Sharantyr]] broke into [[Belgon Bradaskor]]'s hideout and extracted information from him, he offered her a horse. Belgon commanded [[Tornar]] to fetch her Flamewind, his best horse; the animal served [[Sharantyr]] on her pursuit of [[Orthil Voldovan]]'s caravan, looking to reach [[Shandril Shessair]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|148-150|9}}

Unfortunately, the horse weakened and fell before reaching [[Triel]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|256|15}} Sharantyr left the horse behind, traveling alone on foot.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|292|17}}
