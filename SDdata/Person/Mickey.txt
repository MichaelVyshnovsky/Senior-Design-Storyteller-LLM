Mickey was a fiendish flesh golem created by the night hag Mad Maggie, and a member of her Knucklebones Gang in Avernus.
The fiendish construct was described as being endearing but rather foolish.
Mickey was formed from various devil, yugoloth, and demon body parts. He was particularly large and was often dragged on a leash by Mad Maggie.This description is based on the artwork on page 82 of Baldurs Gate Descent into Avernus 
As of the , Mickey had a piece of bone devil buried in his leg. Since he was unable to speak, he only grunted in pain when he walked or periodically hopped around in a little dance. 
Mickey was subservient to his creator Mad Maggie. He was often ridiculed by the redcaps and madcaps in the Knucklebones Gang.
