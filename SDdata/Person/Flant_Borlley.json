        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the city of Baldur's Gate was threatened by the encroaching army of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. The crisis flooded the city with refugees, elevating tensions among its citizens and allowing a new power to take rulership of the city â€“ [[Lord Gortash]]. Flant Borlley eagerly consumed the new lord's propaganda from the curbside preachers and from the pages of the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette.'' [[Augur Harxkellan]] was a Gortash loyalist whose words attracted Flant's attention as he worshiped Enver Gortash, thinking him to be an underappreciated genius."
