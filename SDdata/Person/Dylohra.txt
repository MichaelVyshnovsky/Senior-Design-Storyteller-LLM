Dylohra () was a half-elf waitress in Mulmaster in 1491 DR.
Dylohra was the oldest of her sisters and felt responsible for them.
Dylohra and her family lived near Zhentil Keep, where her father worked for the Zhentarim. After that citys destruction, they transferred to Mulmaster, where she began working as a maid and her father as a mason.
In 1491 DR, she became worried about her youngest sister, Lyrene, who desperately wanted to join the Zhentarim like their ancestors, and disappeared. Dylohra asked for the help of an adventuring party she met at one of the parties held in her employers house.
In 1491 DR, Dylohra worked at the Astrid Saj estate.
