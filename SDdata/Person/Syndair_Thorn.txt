Syndair Thorn was a wizard who lived in the village of Eveningstar during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Aside from Lord Tessaril Winter, Syndair was the only known spellcaster living in Eveningstar. She mostly used her magic to entertain or tutor young students of the art. She was also a weaver and dressmaker.
