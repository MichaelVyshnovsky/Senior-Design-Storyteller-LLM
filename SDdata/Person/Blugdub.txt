Blugdub was an orog leader in Blingdenstone.
In 1478 DR, Blugdub, like Ashkabbar, led a group of orcs into a section of Blingdenstone. They too started raiding the deep gnome settlers led by Kargien Dissengulp. Finally, in 1479 DR, an adventuring party hired by Kargien defeated Blugdub and Ashkabbar and forced the orcs to abandon the city.
