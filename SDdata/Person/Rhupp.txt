Rhupp was a half-orc in Winter Edge in 1484 DR.
Rhupp was born to Muhrella, an orc of the Broken Arrow tribe, and Uvaan, a human forester from Winter Edge. Rhupps parents died early but Muhrella, before she died, managed to teach Rhupp all about orc traditions.
Just after the start of the Darkening, Goodwife Winnstrom hired an adventuring party to take Rhupp to the Dark Arrow Keep in hopes of stopping the war.
