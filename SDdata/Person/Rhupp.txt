'''Rhupp''' was a [[half-orc]] in [[Winter Edge]] in [[1484 DR]].
  
==History==
Rhupp was born to [[Muhrella]], an [[orc]] of the [[Broken Arrow]] tribe, and [[Uvaan]], a [[human]] forester from Winter Edge. Rhupp's parents died early but Muhrella, before she died, managed to teach Rhupp all about orc traditions.

Just after the start of the [[Darkening]], [[Goodwife Winnstrom]] hired an adventuring party to take Rhupp to the [[Dark Arrow Keep]] in hopes of stopping the war.
