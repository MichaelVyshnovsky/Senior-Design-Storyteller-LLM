'''Master Hu Li''' was a great artificer of [[Kara-Tur]], who was little known in [[Faerûn]] of the mid–14th century [[DR]].

Hu Li fashioned the magical [[katana]]s known as ''[[Master Li's Way]]''. These swords, bearing the maker's mark of Master Hu Li, turned up in [[northwest Faerûn]] in the 1360s DR.
