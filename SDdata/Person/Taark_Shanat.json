        "mainbody": "'''Taark Shanat''', known as '''the Crusader''', was a [[dwarf]] and the founder of the kingdom of [[Shanatar]].",
        "History": "Around {{Yearlink|-11000}}, Taark and his eight sons left [[Bhaerynden]], leading a great migration of dwarves journeying westward, and sought to establish a new kingdom. These emigrants eventually took the name \"[[shield dwarves]]\".\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-10800}}, the [[Cloaker Wars]] broke out, in which Taark and his dwarves came up against the inhabitants of [[Rringlor Noroth]]. Taark slew four [[blue dragon]]s in the [[Rift of Dhalnadar]] and the dwarves were victorious.\n\nThe skulls of the four blue dragons were brought together by a deity, probably [[Dumathoin]], to form the [[Wyrmskull Throne]], and the site was renamed [[Brightaxe Hall]], founding the kingdom of [[Alatorin]] and this is what shield dwarves consider to mark the [[First Great Age of Shanatar]]. They founded the great empire of Shanatar beneath the lands that would later be known as [[Amn]], [[Tethyr]], [[Calimshan]], and the [[Lake of Steam (region)|Lake of Steam]]."
