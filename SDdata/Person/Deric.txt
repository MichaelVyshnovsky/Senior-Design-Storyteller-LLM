'''Deric''', sometimes called '''Deric of the Ffolk''', was a chieftain of the [[Ffolk]] people of the [[Moonshae Isles]] and the first King of [[Corwell]] in the mid&ndash;2{{nd}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|32}}

==Relationships==
Deric was the son of the "First Mother", [[Gwynneth (person)|Gwynneth]], and of her consort, [[Taylor]], who led the first [[Talfir]]ic settlers to the Moonshaes. Deric was the last in their line, which would come to be called the [[First Dynasty of the Moonshaes]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|25}}

==History==
Five years after his father's death against the [[Llewyrr]] [[elves]], Deric's successes in battle allowed him to unite the Ffolk in the south of the isle of [[Gwynneth]]. He formed them into the new Kingdom of Corwell in the {{YearlinkName|149}}.

In the {{YearlinkName|154}}, King Deric and King [[Kaminas]] of [[Synnoria]] established a peace agreement between the Ffolk and the Llewyrr at the elven capital of [[Chysalis]].

Deric ruled for twenty-two years before he died of natural causes in the {{YearlinkName|171}}. He left no heir, and so Corwell descended into civil war until they were reunited by [[Callidyrr Hugh]] six years later.
