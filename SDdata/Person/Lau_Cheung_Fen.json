        "mainbody": "'''Lau Cheung Fen''' was a [[Shou]] merchant and an important dignitary from [[Shou Lung]] who traveled with the merchant captain [[Ran Ai Yu]] on her vessel the ''[[Jie Zuo]]'' to [[Faerûn]] in the mid-1360s DR.<ref> He was a crane [[Hengeyokai]] who usually disguised himself as a human.",
        "History": "He accompanied Ran Ai Yu when she arrived in [[Innarlith]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] in [[1365 DR]]. There he met [[Ivar Devorast]], a [[Cormyrean]] engineer tasked by the city-state with building a canal that would connect the Lake of Steam to the [[Nagaflow]]. Lau visited the canal site, and acted on behalf of the Shou merchant fleet to give his support for the endeavor. He met [[Phyrea]], the daughter of Senator [[Inthelph]] at the site, and she tried to convince him that Devorast wasn't up to the task, although he claimed to have heard contrary reports about Devorast. He was interested in buying porcelain ships like the ''Jie Zuo'' from Ivar Devorast when he discovered that Devorast had been its builder, but he was shocked to discover that Devorast only built one and would never build another one.<ref>\n\nHe was present in Innarlith in [[1374 DR]] when Ransar [[Pristoleph]] was fighting a civil war against a faction of senators who were seeking to overthrow him. He helped Pristoleph in the war, by defeating and capturing the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]], [[Marek Rymüt]].<ref>"
