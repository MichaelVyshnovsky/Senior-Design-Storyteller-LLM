Alciati was a Netherese thief and playwright who wrote many famous theatrical works during the final years of Netheril.
He told tales involving shadowy, unseemly protagonists that proved to be righteous and good in the end. These plays were very popular, and were regularly performed by the League of Noted Singers and Performers.
