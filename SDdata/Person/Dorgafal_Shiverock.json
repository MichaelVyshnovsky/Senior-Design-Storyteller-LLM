        "mainbody": "'''Dorgafal Shiverock''' was a [[gnome]] [[bard]] and agent of the [[Guardians of the Weave]] as of the year [[1374 DR]]. He took on many responsibilites within the organization, serving as both their lorekeeper and judicious interviewer.",
        "Description": "Average-sized for a [[rock gnome]], Dorgafal had tan skin, remarkably blue eyes and a shock of red hair. He typically wore comfortable, leather clothes which were accentuated by a striking ''[[mithral]] [[chain shirt]]''.\n\nExuberant and animated with his gestures, Dorgafal had a wide vocal range which he used in full effect while conversing with others, or alone reciting lines. This often had others looking at him as though he were quite mad, when in fact he had a keen mind. He was a great judge of character, adept at determining when someone was anything but completely sincere with enough sense to not let on that he was aware.\n\nHe was also a skilled healer with a knack for getting in and and out of dangerous locations.",
        "Relationships": "Dorgafal's cousin was a [[priest]] of [[Baravar Cloakshadow]], and the main liaison between the Guardians and Baravar's faithful among the gnome community.\n\nHe had many contacts throughout the lands and was allied with spies who had infiltrated the lower ranks of the Zhentarim. As such he was often privy to some of their activities and movements.",
        "Possessions": "Along with his ''mithral shirt'', Dorgafal was known to wear a +2 ''[[cloak of charisma]]'' and carried a ''[[Fochlucan bandore]]''.",
        "History": "Dorgafal was born and raised in [[Shadowdale]], where he first developed a love of storytelling. In his youth he studied to be an orator and thespian before traveling across [[West Faerûn|western Faerûn]] as an adult, where amassed a vast collection of stories and rumors about the happenings in the Realms. During his travels he managed to involve himself in the schemes of both [[Zhentarim]] agents and zealots of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], interfering with their goals to the point where both groups made attempts on his life. \n\nSome time later he allied himself with the Guardians of the Weave, looking for an opportunity to trade information with the vagabonds of Faerûn and stick it to the cultists and [[Zhent]] arcanists."
