        "mainbody": "'''Lif''' was a [[poltergeist]] that haunted [[Trollskull Manor]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Lif was a [[half-elf]] barkeeper who even after his death couldn't abandon his old tavern on [[Trollskull Alley]] and tried to scare away all new owners. In {{Yearlink|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} [[Volothamp Geddarm]] acquired the place at a low price and later formally gave it to some adventurers whom he had hired to save [[Floon Blagmaar]].",
        "Personality": "Lif's life was his work. If a new owner opened another tavern inside [[Trollskull Manor]], he could gradually become quite accommodating to them."
