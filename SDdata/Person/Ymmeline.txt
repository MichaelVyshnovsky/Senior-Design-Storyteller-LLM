Ymmeline () was a Zhentarim agent based in the village of The Stop in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Ymmeline resided at the inn and tavern called the Plodding Plow.
She was sighted concealing her appearance by wearing a hood.
Circa 1486 DR, Ymmeline may have encountered some adventurers affiliated the Zhentarim at The Stop. Meeting with them in secret, she would order them to capture alive some rust monsters that had mysteriously disappeared in the area while being hunted by a Zhentarim ally.
