He allied with Heafstaag and the traitor [[DeBernezan]] to unite all the tribes in an attack against the [[Ten Towns]] in [[1351 DR]].\n\nHowever, thanks to the scouting of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], the men of [[Icewind Dale]] were ready for the battle. Beorg was killed in the fighting. His tribe suffered the most deaths and soon lost much of its influence, becoming a minor tribe.<ref>"
