He allied with Heafstaag and the traitor DeBernezan to unite all the tribes in an attack against the Ten Towns in 1351 DR.\nHowever, thanks to the scouting of Drizzt DoUrden, the men of Icewind Dale were ready for the battle. Beorg was killed in the fighting. His tribe suffered the most deaths and soon lost much of its influence, becoming a minor tribe."
