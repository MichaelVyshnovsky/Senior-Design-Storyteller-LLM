'''Auntie Ethel''' was an [[green hag|old woman]] that dwelled within a [[Riverside Teahouse|quaint little teahouse]] in the [[Sunlit Wetlands]] of the [[Western Heartlands]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Hello, petal. Just relax. See the world with fresh eyes. And let your dear old Auntie Ethel look after you.|Ethel's voice to those donning one of her [[whispering mask|masks]].}}

==Description==
By all outward appearances, Ethel was a kind elderly woman that went out of her way to help others. She presented herself as frail and vulnerable and spoke with a soothing tone that quickly garnered the trust of others.

==Personality==
{{Quote|But let it not be said that Auntie Ethel doesn't honor her debts.}}

Ethel's sweet and "generous" persona was merely a guise to pursue her own selfish aims, which she furthered by manipulation, outright lies, and various forms of torture. She was thoroughly evil in how she used others, exploiting their greatest desires or fears for her own gain.

She absolutely detested and would not have anything to do with [[shadow magic]], particularly that associated with the returned empire of [[Netheril]]. It was one of the few topics that caused her to forego her usual honeyed words for bodily-function-themed vulgarities.

==Abilities==
Auntie Ethel was a powerful [[spellcaster]] armed with many powers and spells to confuse and mislead anyone that dared oppose her in battle. She could create [[illusion|illusory]] clones of herself, take on and imbue her clones with the likeness of others, and outright ''[[invisibility|turn invisible]]'' if she felt truly threatened.

==Possessions==
{{Quote|I've collected some...interesting bits 'n' bobs over the years.}}

Over the years Ethel amassed a collection of magical [[implement]]s, including the powerful staff of rotting wood and live worms called the ''[[staff of crones]]'',  that was capable of ''[[ray of sickness|inflicting sickness]]'' in others at will, an [[elven]] [[quarterstaff|staff]] called ''[[Corellon's Grace]]'', and a specially-crafted [[wand]] of her own making called ''[[Bitter Divorce]]'', which allowed the hag to ''[[raise dead|raise]]'' one specific individual.

Using the [[hag eye|extracted eye]] of one of her many victims, Ether created a ''[[ever-seeing eye|twisted amulet]]'' that offered her ''[[protection from evil and good|protection against righteous and immoral]]'' beings alike.

True to her disguise as an apothecary, Ethel maintained a vast collection of mysterious brews and draughts in her lair, with names like ''[[A Mother's Loathing]]'', ''[[Broken Promises]]'', ''[[Butterflies in the Stomach]]'', ''[[Faltering Will]]'', ''[[Heart of Stone (potion)|Heart of Stone]]'', ''[[Insanity's Kiss]]'', ''[[Lost Time]]'', ''[[Lover's Avarice]]'', ''[[Missing Pets]]'', and ''[[Wilted Dreams]]''.

==Activities==

[[File:Ethel_lair.png|thumb|right|250px|Auntie Ethel, within her cavernous lair.]]
Auntie Ethel spent much of her time in her lair, working on sick experiments or other horrific acts to further her own goals. When she was out in disguise amongst the folks of the Realms, Ethel was seeking out victims to target for her depraved covenants. While these deals seldom worked in the favor of those that dealt with Ethel, she always upheld her end of the bargain, often in some manner twisting the words of the agreement.

She dwelled made her lair and laboratory within an underground cave deep beneath the swamp. It was accessible by a twisting passageway beneath a decrepit old shack, that Ethel made to appear as a cozy little teahouse. She used [[illusion]] magic to obscure the appearance of the swamp itself, making it look as a lovely picnic destination with adorable [[sheep]], while it was in fact a putrid bog with poisonous plans overrun with her personal [[redcap]] minions.

==Relationships==
Ethel's lair was inhabited by many of those she had manipulated, debilitated or outright abducted. Among them were the [[elf]] [[Lorin]], she made to always see others as horrific [[illusion]]s, a [[petrified]] [[dwarf]] [[Efrin Hammerborn]], whom she secretly infected with Ladaguer's Bite, the beheaded [[Magron]], and the vain [[Calim]], whose likeness was trapped within a [[mirror]].

==History==
At some point, two [[paladin]]s and a divine [[cleric]] attempted to storm Auntie Ethel's lair. While their final fate was unknown, their last known deeds were screaming in pure terror.

For a time during the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Ethel traveled with the community of [[tiefling]]s that had been exiled from [[Elturel]] following [[the Descent]] of the city into [[Avernus]], working as an apothecary and [[potion]]-maker. At some point she offered some unknown potion to the guard [[Pandirna]], leaving her immobilized for a short time.

Around that same time, Ethel made a deal with a woman named [[Mayrina]], offering to bring her husband [[Connor Vinderblad|Connor]] back from the dead in exchange for her unborn baby. She kept Mayrina within her hut in the middle of a swamp until the baby was born, offering promises that she would provide a better life for the child than the poor woman ever could. While returning to her lair in her [[human]] form, Ethel was confronted by Mayrina's brothers [[Johl]] and [[Demir]].
