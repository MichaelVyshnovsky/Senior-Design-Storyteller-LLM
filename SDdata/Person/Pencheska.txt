Pencheska was a succubus in the Doomvault dungeon in 1486 DR.
Pencheska was a succubus summoned by a lich named Tarul Var of the Red Wizards of Thay, who quickly enslaved her.
In 1485 DR, under Taruls orders, she caused chaos in Daggerford by posing as the human courtesan Natyssa.
Adventures ultimately unveiled her. Afterward, Pencheska was relocated to the lichs rooms in the Doomvault dungeon waiting for new orders from her master.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, she conspired with Baroness Wynne Cromm to capture Morwen Daggerford, the duchess of Daggerford. While duchess Morwen was imprisoned in Cromms Hold, Pencheska posed as the duchess in Daggerford.
Pencheska was unhappy with her situation as a slave of Tarul. She did not immediately attack the lichs enemies.
