'''Pencheska''' was a [[succubus]] in the [[Doomvault]] dungeon in [[1486 DR]].

==History==
Pencheska was a succubus summoned by a [[lich]] named [[Tarul Var]] of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], who quickly enslaved her.

In 1485 DR, under Tarul's orders, she caused chaos in [[Daggerford]] by posing as the [[human]] courtesan '''Natyssa'''.
Adventures ultimately unveiled her. Afterward, Pencheska was relocated to the lich's rooms in the Doomvault dungeon waiting for new orders from her master.

In the late 1480's or early 1490's DR, she conspired with Baroness [[Wynne Cromm]] to capture [[Morwen Daggerford]], the duchess of Daggerford. While duchess Morwen was imprisoned in [[Cromm's Hold]], Pencheska posed as the duchess in Daggerford.<ref>

==Personality==
Pencheska was unhappy with her situation as a slave of Tarul. She did not immediately attack the lich's enemies.
