        "mainbody": "Thallon Geiros was a Tyrran high priest in the city-state of Saelmur, in the Land of the Lions region of south Faer√ªn, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThallon served as the high priest of Saelmurs local temple of Tyr, the Hall of High Justice. And like Saelmurs other religious leaders, he also served as a member of the city-states governing council, the Councilium of Prelates.\nAround the 1350s DR, Thallon lost one of their eyes in a battle against a Banite priest.\nTwo decades later in 1370 DR, Thallon was of the same mind as his fellow Prelate Athelstan Meiados when it came to the Knights of the Black Gauntlet, an order of Banite crusaders that had conquered the nearby cities of Mintar and Kzelter in 1362 DR and 1370 DR respectively. The two believed that the Knights forces waging war with Saelmur was inevitable, but unlike Athelstan he had no desire to rush into war with them. Thallon felt that without outside aid the Saelmurrans had no chance of standing against the Banites. He hoped to gain the aid of Tethyr and the Ala-min tribe in this endeavor, with the latter being seen as a good counter to the heavy cavalry of the Knights."
