'''Jonstral Haerdrun''' was an enigmatic instrument-maker who lived within the city of [[Sundabar]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. In addition to running his own shop, called [[Lutery|the Lutery]], Jonstal was a skilled musician in his own right, though he refused to perform for others, or teach anyone his skill.

==History==
Though he was renowned for his skill at his craft, not much was known about Jonstral among the people of Sundabar. Rumors circulated about his homeland, whether it was [[Neverwinter]] or far to [[East Faerûn|the east]] in [[Rashemen]].

==Description==
Jonstral had a slight build, very pale white skin, and long, unruly black hair he would wear in a long pony tail.

==Activities==
Being a skilled carpenter and wood-worker, Jonstal would often hire some guards and embark on long forays into the forests of [[the North]] to hunt down just the right trees whose wood would be perfect for his crafted instruments. Over the course of these trips he had fought his way out of several [[orc]] ambushes.
