'''Pern''' was a male [[human]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the 1350s [[DR]]. He was a member of Waterdeep's [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]].

One day in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], a huntsman informed the City Guard of a magical tower erected within a single day, a full day's hard ride north of Waterdeep's [[Trollwall]]. A City Guard patrol, led by a captain and including Pern, investigated and attempted to scale the tower. [[Imgig Zu]], master of the tower, animated his [[gargoyle]] minions to attack the guardsmen.{{Cite comic/The Gathering}}
