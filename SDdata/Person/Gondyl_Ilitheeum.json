He plotted to subtly infiltrate the city with more of his fellows and one day rule the town.\nOnce Gondyl was part of a druuth in Gauntlgrym together with Semmonemily and under orders of the mind flayer Nalynaul. Only Gondyl and Semmonemily survived after Nalynaul escaped the illithid community in order to become an alhoon."
