        "History": "{{quote|I think Erika knows. She must be prevented from interfering in the process... I found the cleric's book in her chambers yesterday... she may have found a way to stop me.|Text in Gunter Weiss' notes}}\nWhile she was alive, Erika lived with Gunter Weiss, an old [[wizard]] who slowly grew more obsessed with getting her to love him. However, she became disturbed by the knowledge of his experiments with eternal life and [[necromancy]], until, when he finally made his attempt at gaining eternal life, she disturbed it, ruining the spell. According to Weiss's notes, she acquired a book from a [[cleric]] prior to that point. After disturbing the ritual, she died trapped in the house at a later date.\n\n{{quote|They say Gunter's dead, but I don't believe it. I can feel him. He is still with us. I must confess I did a terrible thing. I stole the silver heart from the hands of his corpse which lay in the crypt. I know not what it was for, only that it was vital to his dark plan. Oh no! Somebody is coming!|Erika's apparition}}\nIn the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], adventurers may have arrived at [[Harrow Hill]] and discovered the silver heart that Erika stole, in plain sight in the library. They may also have discovered her picture in her bedroom; if disturbed, it animated and spoke, revealing that the silver heart was something she knew was important to Gunter's plans. Fastened to the back of her portrait, there was a brass key, leading to the secret crypt where Gunter Weiss's ritual took place."
