        "mainbody": "'''Jorun Tamewater''' was an elderly but strong [[dwarf|dwarven]] shipwright and engineer who worked in [[Targos]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Aye, I still have some rock and fire in me yet. When I caught them trying to set fire to me '''ship''', me eyes filled with blood – I've spent too long carving her hull to let it be touched by [[goblin]] filth.''|Jorun Tamewater}}",
        "Description": "Jorun was a pale-skinned dwarf. He wore a set of [[leather armor]] and was armed with a [[warhammer]].",
        "Possessions": "Jorun Tamewater's home stood at the bottom of the cliffs to the south-west of the docks. At the time of the goblin attack, the dwarf rigged one of his chests with a ''[[stinking cloud]]'' for any unwitting thieves.",
        "Relationships": "Jorun had a strained and argumentative relationship with [[Lumbar Grundwall]], a lumber merchant in Targos. After a fight in 1312 DR, the two stopped talking with each other.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the town of Targos was besieged by a goblin army that served the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. As an engineer, Jorun Tamewater and his son [[Olap Tamewater|Olap]] constructed a crane to transport lumber up the cliff from Targos' docks to the outskirts of the town for defensive palisades. In addition to being imported from [[Lonelywood]] and stripped from wooden buildings, some of the lumber came from the ships Jorun had built. When goblins commenced a surprise attack on the docks, Jorun Tamewater caught several \"rock-crawlers\" trying to set fire to his ships in the harbor. Furious, the dwarf attacked the invaders and caved numerous goblin skulls in.\n\nShortly after, a group of adventurers from [[Luskan]] met the shipbuilder, who shared an important observation – the goblins did not jump the palisades and carried [[pickaxe]]s, indicating that they had found a way into Targos through an underground passage."
