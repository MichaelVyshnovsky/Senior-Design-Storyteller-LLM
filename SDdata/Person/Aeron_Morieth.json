        "History": "In [[1367 DR]], Aeron Morieth became the Stormwalker of [[Maerchwood]].\n\nAfter the destruction of [[Cimbar]]'s College of Wizardry in [[1370 DR]], Aeron managed to depose the ruling [[Sceptanar]] of [[Chessenta]] and assumed the title. However, Aeron only held this post for a few months before handing it to [[Melisanda]] of [[Arrabar]] before moving to the Maerchwood.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]] he had attracted the attention of [[Shar]], who expressly forbade her devotees from approaching him in any way, although they were to maintain their surveillance."
