Zaroum Al-Saryak () was the captain of the pirate ship The Emerald Eye in the late 15 century DR.
He was missing his left eye and had an "x-shaped" scar on his face.
Zaroum was a calculating and ruthless individual. He regularly keel-hauled or even beheaded those in his service that he found displeasing.
He had a particular affinity for gem stones.
True to his tastes, Zaroums coat and his scimitar featured brilliant gems in their decoration. He even had a large gem embedded into his left eye socket. While it did not work for anyone else, this gem allowed Zaroum to see spectral routes that led him to greater caches of treasure.
Zaroums first mate was the Calishite berserker Voltan.
He regularly communication with Liara Portyr, the Commander of Fort Beluarian, by means of a sending stone.
