gnome
Tamith Timekeep was one of the gnome engineers that worked at the logging camp by the Lantan-Samarach portal in the jungles of Samarlogh in the late 14 century DR.
Tamith had long chestnut hair and green facial markings.
By the , Tamith Timekeep was among the gnomes who staffed the illegal logging operation in Samarlogh. She was a talented engineer and created an improved logging machine design. Her fellow engineer Leva saw the schematics and wanted to claim it as his own, along with the bonus pay from the employer. Leva pretended to be enamored with lonely Tamith and lured her to the jungles and killed her. Leva lied to Dall Nickleplate and other gnomes, blaming Tamiths death on a dinosaur attack. Her body was burned and buried outside the logging camp, and Tamiths death turned her spirit into a ghost longing to bring the murderer to justice.
When a group of adventurers hired by merchant SaSani of Samargol arrived at the Lantan-Samarach portal, they helped the gnomes in dealing with several incidents, including the poisoning of the camps main engineer. They came across Tams disoriented ghost and followed the undeads directions to her charred body with a distinct melted necklace. When Tamith Timekeeps body was presented to Dall Nickleplate, he immediately recognized the jewelry and realized Levas guilt. As Leva was being interrogated, Tamiths angry spirit attacked and killed the murderer. Her spirit found peace, as Dall sent both bodies back to Lantan for burial.
