'''Tamith Timekeep''' was one of the [[gnome]] engineers that worked at the logging camp by the ''[[Lantan-Samarach portal]]'' in the jungles of [[Samarlogh]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Tamith had long chestnut hair and green facial markings.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Tamith Timekeep was among the gnomes who staffed the illegal logging operation in Samarlogh. She was a talented engineer and created an improved logging machine design. Her fellow engineer [[Leva]] saw the schematics and wanted to claim it as his own, along with the bonus pay from the employer. Leva pretended to be enamored with lonely Tamith and lured her to the jungles and killed her. Leva lied to [[Dall Nickleplate]] and other gnomes, blaming Tamith's death on a [[dinosaur]] attack. Her body was burned and buried outside the logging camp, and Tamith's death turned her spirit into a [[ghost]] longing to bring the murderer to justice.

When a group of adventurers hired by merchant [[Sa'Sani]] of [[Samargol]] arrived at the ''Lantan-Samarach portal'', they helped the gnomes in dealing with several incidents, including the poisoning of the camp's main engineer. They came across Tam's disoriented ghost and followed the undead's directions to her charred body with a distinct melted necklace. When Tamith Timekeep's body was presented to Dall Nickleplate, he immediately recognized the jewelry and realized Leva's guilt. As Leva was being interrogated, Tamith's angry spirit attacked and killed the murderer. Her spirit found peace, as Dall sent both bodies back to [[Lantan]] for burial.
