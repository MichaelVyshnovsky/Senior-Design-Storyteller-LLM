A year later, a young priest of Earth Mother came across the abandoned winery, restoring it and resuming wine production. During that time, he befriended a duo of ancient fun-loving satyrs, Quellonis and Harmon, who were regular guests of Larns, tasting new wines, singing songs, and playing music late into the night.\nSoon after, the medusa mage named Samanthiss and her consort – maedar Vorlon, found the winery and decided to take over. Larn was petrified by the medusa, while Vorlon assumed the assumed identity of the vintner. The couple continued operating the winery for the following decade. Vorlon showed remorse over Larns fate but came to love winemaking. Larns stone body was kept in good condition if the medusas ever needed food.\nThe winerys rightful owner, Shauna Morden of Ravens Bluff discovered its existence after her fathers death circa the  and hired a group of capable adventurers of the Living City to investigate the winerys condition and establish a dialogue and partnership with its managers if there were any. Subsequently, the Morden Winery was returned to the Morden family, and, by some accounts, the maedar vintner was allowed to run the business by others, the medusas were slain. Larn was believed to had been released from the decade of being petrified, either with some help from outside forces or as a sign of good will from Vorlon. Were lard given freedom, he was ready to reward his saviors with his enchanted medallion of proof – a precious trinket that changed its appearance depending on its owners faith or divine patronage."
