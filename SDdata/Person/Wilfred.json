He was the first to meet a new adventurer arriving in the city. He led the adventurer to Lt. Josef Linkletters camp and later fought beside the adventurer against the undead during the Battle of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge. He was killed by Valindra herself during the battle.\nAn small shrine was built in the place of his death, as the people of Neverwinter never forgot about his sacrifice to save the city from the undead."
