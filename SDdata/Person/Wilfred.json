He was the first to meet a new [[adventurer]] arriving in the city. He led the adventurer to Lt. [[Josef Linkletter]]'s camp and later fought beside the adventurer against the undead during [[the Battle of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]]. He was killed by Valindra herself during the battle.",
        "Legacy": "An small shrine was built in the place of his death, as the people of Neverwinter never forgot about his sacrifice to save the city from the undead."
