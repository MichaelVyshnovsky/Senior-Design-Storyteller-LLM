'''Uluryk Malogh''' was a notorious violent [[thief]] who inhabited the city of [[Waterdeep]] sometime before the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Uluryk murdered the heads of two noble houses and taunted their relatives, and also boasted of his association with Waterdeep's banished [[thieves' guild]]. Wishing to tie off a loose end, agents of the guild were sent to Waterdeep and eventually cornered Uluryk in an alley in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]], where they slew him with poisoned [[arrow]]s. The alley where he died was later named [[Catchthief Alley]] because of this event.
