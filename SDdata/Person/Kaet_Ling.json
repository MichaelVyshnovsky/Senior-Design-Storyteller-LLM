One such material that skyrocketed in price was saltpeter. Kaet sought to purchase a shipment of barreled saltpeter from the dwarvish trader Djingo and participated in a bidding war against Smiley Gheef and Pheebs Splayfoot. Djingo charged at least 500 gold pieces per barrel, a high price as he knew that once Baldurs Gate was besieged, hed easily sell it for double that amount to the foundry. Smiley Gheef offered 700 gp per barrel, but the bidding ward ended abruptly when Kaet Ling offered to pay 1,000 gp per barrel, in cash, no notes."
