        "mainbody": "'''Kaet Ling''' was a ruthless businesswoman from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''My father always told me, \"Kaet, commerce is like warfare. Fight for it like your life's at stake.\"''|Kaet Ling}}",
        "Description": "Kaet Ling was a [[human]] woman with hazel eyes, reddish-brown hair gathered in a bun, and sun-kissed golden skin.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the city of Baldur's Gate shuddered under the [[Absolute crisis]], certain goods started to become rare and expensive. One such material that skyrocketed in price was [[saltpeter]]. Kaet sought to purchase a shipment of barreled saltpeter from the [[dwarf|dwarvish]] trader [[Djingo]] and participated in a bidding war against [[Smiley Gheef]] and [[Pheebs Splayfoot]]. Djingo charged at least 500 [[gold]] [[coin|pieces]] per barrel, a high price as he knew that once Baldur's Gate was besieged, he'd easily sell it for double that amount to the foundry. Smiley Gheef offered 700 gp per barrel, but the bidding ward ended abruptly when Kaet Ling offered to pay 1,000 gp per barrel, in cash, no notes."
