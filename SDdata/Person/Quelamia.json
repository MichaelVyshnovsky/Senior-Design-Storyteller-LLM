        "mainbody": "Quelamia was an eladrin mage and the most powerful wizard in the employ of House Serrat of Delzimmer in the late 15 century DR. She was so important to the familys business that she was given a percentage of profits, something no other employee received.\nQuelamia had blond hair and blue pupil-less eyes.\nQuelamia was originally from the Feywild although it is unknown when she first came to Toril. At some point in her life, she was a war wizard but gave up the profession for more peaceful pursuits decades before 1479 DR.\nIn 1364 DR, the evil yuan-ti god Zehir appeared to Quelamia and enlisted her aid. In exchange for aiding Zaltys Serrat in her quest to free her birth clan from enslavement by derro, Zehir agreed to help destroy the derros portal to the Far Realm. Because Quelamia, as an eladrin, was part of the natural world, she considered the Far Realm to be the antithesis of everything she believed in and thought temporarily allying with an evil god was the lesser evil.\nIn 1479 DR, Zaltys learned that her original clan had been abducted rather than killed by derro and she adventured into the Underdark to free them. Quelamia refused to join the rescue party organized by Alaia Serrat because she had many enemies in the Feydark who would sense her presence in Torils Underdark and would attack the group. She did, however, provide Zaltys and her cousin Julen a number of magic items, including leather armor made from a shadow snake."
