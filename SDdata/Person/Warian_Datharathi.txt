Warian Datharathi was a member of the Datharathi chaka of Vaelan in Durpar. He became the first plangent prototype in , and then left Durpar to see the world.
Warians parents died in an accident and the young man never developed a taste for the politics endemic to his familys position. He allowed his grandfather, Shaddon Datharathi, to create a prosthetic for him he was so thankful that he temporarily considered setting aside his plans of traveling. However, his sister Eined Datharathi recommended he see the world.
On arrival, he spent two days in town before meeting his family. In that time he came across his uncle Zeltaebar Datharathi while trying to visit his sister Eined, who was missing. He noticed the wrongness of the situation, and while traveling to his grandfathers workshop with Sevaera Datharathi, he found Zeltaebar had stowed away on the ship. His uncle had made similar observations as to the behavior of his siblings, Sevaera and Xaemar Datharathi.
His visit to his grandfather turned sour quickly, as the latter would not let Warian keep his present prosthetics. Only Zeltaebars timely, stealthy intervention with a crowbar to Shaddons head, along with Eineds arrival, provided sufficient breathing room for them to escape, though Sevaera attempted to stop them, possessed by Pandorym. They had no choice but to flee into the Celestial Nadir, where they were saved from a possessed Sevaera by Ususi Manaallin and Iahn Qoyllor. From them, he learned of Pandorym, and of Eineds death.
Warian was part of the fight with Pandoryms forces not much later that night, leading to the elder evils final sealing on Tarsakh 19.
