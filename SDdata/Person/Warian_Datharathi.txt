'''Warian Datharathi''' was a member of the [[Datharathi]] chaka of [[Vaelan]] in [[Durpar]]. He became the first [[plangent]] prototype in {{yearlink|1367}}, and then left Durpar to see the world.{{cite book/Darkvision|30}}

==History==
Warian's parents died in an accident and the young man never developed a taste for the politics endemic to his family's position.{{cite book/Darkvision||7}} He allowed his grandfather, [[Shaddon Datharathi]], to create a [[prosthetic]] for him; he was so thankful that he temporarily considered setting aside his plans of traveling. However, his sister [[Eined Datharathi]] recommended he see the world.{{cite book/Darkvision||3}}

On arrival, he spent two days in town before meeting his family. In that time he came across his uncle [[Zeltaebar Datharathi]] while trying to visit his sister Eined, who was missing.{{cite book/Darkvision||10}} He noticed the wrongness of the situation, and while traveling to his grandfather's workshop with [[Sevaera Datharathi]], he found Zeltaebar had stowed away on the ship. His uncle had made similar observations as to the behavior of his siblings, Sevaera and [[Xaemar Datharathi]].{{cite book/Darkvision||15}}

His visit to his grandfather turned sour quickly, as the latter would not let Warian keep his present prosthetics. Only Zeltaebar's timely, stealthy intervention with a crowbar to Shaddon's head, along with Eined's arrival, provided sufficient breathing room for them to escape, though Sevaera attempted to stop them, possessed by Pandorym.{{cite book/Darkvision|21}} They had no choice but to flee into the [[Celestial Nadir]], where they were saved from a possessed Sevaera{{cite book/Darkvision||22}} by [[Ususi Manaallin]] and [[Iahn Qoyllor]]. From them, he learned of Pandorym, and of Eined's death.{{cite book/Darkvision||23}}

Warian was part of the fight with Pandorym's forces not much later that night, leading to the elder evil's final sealing on [[Tarsakh 19]].{{cite book/Darkvision||28-30}}{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|155}}
