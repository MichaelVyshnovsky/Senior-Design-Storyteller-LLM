Instead of pursuing the family trade, he used all his money in the development of a new tavern. He was stingy in paying some types of expenses and skimped on amenities, but too free with his money on flashy things.\nEmmek hated dealing with the League of Skinners and Tanners. In the past, he had had dealings with the Shard Shunners, a gang of halfling wererats.\nFrewns family originated in Neverwinter but relocated to Waterdeep after the Ruining of 1451 DR. Frewns father worked in a tanning business in the Trades Ward of the city. After the death of his parents, Emmeks sister took care of the family business.\nIn the , Emmek wanted to open a tavern and tried to buy the Trollskull Manor, but was outbid by Volothamp Geddarm. Instead, he opened a pub nearby in Trollskull Alley but got into trouble with the Carpenters, Roofers and Plasterers Guild for not asking their assistance and offended a member of the Cellarers and Plumbers Guild. Emmek made it his goal to be the most successful tavern owner in the North Ward and had no scruples when it came to ruining his competitors businesses."
