        "mainbody": "ib the Miser, formerly Meryl Caberstock, was a landlord of Waterdeep later found in Prismeer, a Domain of Delight in the Feywild in the late 15 century DR.\nIn his previous life, he was a landlord who purchased condemned buildings and rented them to tenants for exorbitant prices. Some of his victims, later apparitions haunting him, were a grubby child, a haggard coachman, a sad long-faced lady, and even a skinny girl with an eye-patch.\nThe hag Granny Skabatha Nightshade later had him spin gold into items in a cave in Thither.\nHe was a thin old man, dressed in worn fancy clothing and a housecoat. He would wear a blindfold so as to never see the shadows of the people he had wronged in his past life in Waterdeep.\nNib the Miser was scared by even the smallest shadow or movement as he dreaded the terrible things he had done in his past life. Nib would never leave his cave because he believed that spinning his wheel would end his terrible curse.\nNib had the ability to turn gold coins into all sorts of magical and mundane items. Among many magical items Nib was able to weave with relative ease included an amulet of proof against detection and location, a bag of holding, boots of elvenkind, bracers of archery, a cloak of protection, gloves of thievery, a wand of secrets, and a tiny hourglass that replicated the abilities of an air elemental gem. Nib could also knit and weave a mundane item not exceeding 1,000 gold pieces.\nIn Nibs small cave he had, among his small amount of basic needs a pile of 27,213 gold pieces and a spinning wheel that he could use to spin the gold into gifts for anyone who stumbled into his adobe.\nNib would spend all day sitting at his spinning wheel in his cave, weaving magical gifts for anyone who would come upon his dwelling.\nWhile watching Nib work at his spinning wheel, spooky shadows would appear to lurk behind him. These phantoms would resemble the many different people he had hurt, wronged, or abused in Waterdeep. It was said that whoever stole any of the gold from Nibs cave would be cursed in a similar way by terrifying apparitions."
