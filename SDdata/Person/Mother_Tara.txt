Mother Tara was a cheery halfling from the Vilhon Reach, who owned Mother Taras Festhall in Shadowdale.
Tara had dark curly hair which was graying.
She held the deed on a house next to her festhall known as Manes Manor, and would rent the place out to adventurers or other large parties. In all her operations, Mother Tara managed aboveboard and honest establishments, keeping her reputation intact.
Around 1374 DR, the Zhentarim took control of Shadowdale and all establishments, including Taras festhall and manor.
