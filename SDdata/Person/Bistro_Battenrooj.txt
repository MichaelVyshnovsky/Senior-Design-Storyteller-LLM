Bistro Battenrooj was the traveling companion of Bahooha Shortsleeves in Impiltur in 1359 DR.
Bistro proclaimed himself a monk despite having no training as one. However, thanks to his illusion powers, he managed to look like one.
Nobody knew if Bistro truly believed himself to be a monk or maintained the facade for the thrill of the challenge, despite many suspecting the latter option.
