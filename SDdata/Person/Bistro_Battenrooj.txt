'''Bistro Battenrooj''' was the traveling companion of [[Bahooha Shortsleeves]] in [[Impiltur]] in [[1359 DR]].

==Activities==
Bistro proclaimed himself a monk despite having no training as one. However, thanks to his [[illusion]] powers, he managed to look like one.

==Personality==
Nobody knew if Bistro truly believed himself to be a monk or maintained the facade for the thrill of the challenge, despite many suspecting the latter option.
