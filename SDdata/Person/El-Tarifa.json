        "Overview": "When the city of Phoenix was abandoned, the [[cleric]] [[Chininsk Ambar]] decided to stay to the last moment. Chininsk Ambar's majordomo was an aerial servant named El-Tarifa who dwelled within a brass lamp. The servant continued to look after the home, even for a millenium after his master's death.\n\nIn {{yearlink|1356}}, El-Tarifa fought with a group of adventurers who accidentally released him from his lamp while ransacking the place. The servant was badly wounded, and returned to his lamp. He may have later encountered the band of adventurers who had released [[Khalitharius]] only weeks before. if so, they may have agreed to help him clean up, which he was too tired to do. In response, El-Tarifa may have explained to them the follies of Chininsk Ambar's reading room and offered to perform one act of kindness for them."
