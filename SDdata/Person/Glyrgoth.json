        "Possessions": "Among the riches in Glyrgoth's hoard was a beautiful [[porcelain]] figurine of a [[boar]].",
        "Activities": "Glyrgoth amassed a hoard of riches, thanks to the efforts of the [[Pale Claw]] bandit gang. The bandits took control over the town of [[Womford]] for a time,<ref group=\"note\">The name of the town is not mentioned in the story; however, it was confirmed as Womford by author [[Jeremy Lambert]] [https://www.instagram.com/p/CkOzi0HSKOd in his instagram post]. offering \"protection\" in exchange for much of the peoples' hard-earned coin.",
        "Relationships": "While the mighty dracolich was the true overlord of the Pale Claw bandits, there existed another figurehead of the gang: the so-called Bandit King [[Grunnald]]. Grunnald tried to act as intermediary between his fellow townspeople in Womford and the gang, but was relegated to a strawman puppet of Glyrgoth.",
        "History": "[[File:Edgin and Kira loot.png|thumb|right|300px|''Thieves making away with much of Glyrgoth's treasure.'']]\nSometime in the 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} the adventurers [[Simon Aumar]], [[Holga Kilgore]], [[Edgin Darvis]], and [[Thelvyn Kip]] broke into Glyrgoth's lair, and attempted to take back the stolen riches for the people of Womford. The adventurers were partially successful: they managed to remove a significant portion of the riches from Glyrgoth's lair, but were forced to abandon much of it when the great dracolich confronted them face-fo-face. The thieving adventurers managed to escape with their lives, but Glyrgoth swore revenge on them."
