'''Ulthas Orgolath''', who was also called '''Ulthas the Darkwing''', was the first [[Nentyarch]] of [[Narfell]] at the beginning of the [[Orgolath Dynasty]] in {{Yearlink|-633}}.

==Activities==
Ulthas and his twin brother [[Ulthar Orgolath|Ulthar]] eradicated the [[Crell Dynasty]] when they slew Nentyarch [[Belevan Crell|Belevan the Unliving]]. Ulthas assumed the title over his brother and held it until his death in {{Yearlink|-623}} when he fell in battle while leading an invasion of [[Unther]] and [[Mulhorand]].

==Relationships==
Ulthas' mother, [[Ayanna Orgolath]], gave herself willingly to the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]]. Ulthas' and his brother's [[half-fiend]] blood was a result of this union.
