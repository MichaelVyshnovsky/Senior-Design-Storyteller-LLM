        "mainbody": "'''Sayeed''' was a [[spellscar]]ed agent of [[Mephistopheles]] in [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "History": "Zeehad and Sayeed fought in [[The Twilight War]] in [[1374 DR]], where they were captured by [[Abelar Corrinthal]]'s troops.  As he could not travel with prisoners, Corrinthal ordered that the defeated soldiers, including Sayeed and Zeeahd, were to have the thumb removed from their sword hand and be released.  Sayeed spent years teaching himself to fight with his left hand.\n\nThe brothers were later plaguechanged when the Blue Fire struck the ship on which they were sailing.  Zeeahd's body was ruined, but Sayeed's was perfected, granting him functional immortality at the cost of anhedonia. Upon being killed by the Spellplague, Zeeahd's soul was tormented in Cania and eventually formed a pact with Mephistopheles: they would find the son of Erevis Cale in exchange for a cure to the transformations wrought by the Spellplague.\n\nIn [[1484 DR]], Sayeed and his brother [[Zeeahd]] went in search of the [[Abbey of the Rose]] in order to capture [[Vasen Cale]].\n\nUpon arriving in the Sembian village of [[Fairelm]], they discovered that the local peddler [[Minser]] had just visited the Abbey. Zeeahd unleashed his pack of [[spined devil]]s to slaughter all inhabitants but Minser and [[Elle]], who had spoken against the discourtesy of the brothers.  Minser was beaten and threatened into guiding them to the Abbey.  Zeeahd's own curse required him to regularly purge himself of corruption by vomiting it into an unwilling vessel, for which purpose he intended to use Elle.  Elle's husband, Gerak, arrived and attempted to kill Zeeahd but was prevented from doing so by Sayeed, who knocked the man unconscious and left him with his dying wife.\n\nSayeed and Zeeahd invaded the Abbey. Sayeed dueled with [[Vasen Cale]] and his two companions, Orsin and Gerak.  Sayeed was defeated, though he survived several wounds that would have been fatal if not for his functional immortality.\n\nWith the completion of the pact with Mephistopheles, Zeeahd was transformed into a bone devil.  This was the \"cure\" for the brothers' curses which Mephistopheles had promised, a deceit which drove Sayeed to despair.  Later, he tried to save the [[bone devil]] that had been Zeeahd from [[Rivalen Tanthul]]. Intrigued by Sayeed's bitterness, Rivalen offered Sayeed death in exchange for a service to [[Shar]].  Without his brother, any hope of a cure, or a life worth living, Sayeed agreed.  To cement his despair, Rivalen had him kill the bone devil into which his brother Zeeahd had transformed.\n\nLater, during the summoning of the [[Shadowstorm]], Rivalen used Sayeed as a vessel by which to translate the divine language of ''[[The Leaves of One Night]]''. The pages of The Leaves poured into Sayeed's mouth, and the translation appeared inked into his back.  Rivalen later compelled Vasen Cale to read these words.  Partway through the reading, Vasen broke the compulsion and erased the text from Sayeed by channeling the light of Amaunator.  Sayeed passed away as the writing faded, granting him the release that he had so desperately wanted.",
        "Powers": "Sayeed's spellscar perfected his body so that he had no need to drink, eat, or sleep. However, it completely removed the pleasure of any physical sensation.  When his curse allowed him to feel anything at all, it was inevitably something foul.  He was incapable of dying and regenerated any wound, regardless of severity.  He resembled an automaton more than a man.\n\nIn addition to his immortality, Sayeed was an expert combatant, fighting with an enchanted single-edged sword and shield.  He was described as being exceptionally large and strong."
