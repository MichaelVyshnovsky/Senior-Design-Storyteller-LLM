==Abilities==
{{quote|I am, but with Selûne's guidance, I learned how to control the beast long ago – I only let it loose again when my family was threatened. Unfortunately I was unable to stop what befell us, as neither elf nor wolf.|Arnell Hallowleaf}}
He had the ability to transform into the form of a [[wolf]], a power not entirely uncommon among the Selûnite faithful.

==Relationships==
Arnell was married to the [[human]] woman [[Emmeline Hallowleaf|Emmeline]]. Together they had a single daughter, [[Jenevelle Hallowleaf|Jenevelle]], who was taken from Selûne's grace by the faithful of [[Shar]].

==History==
Around the [[1462 DR|Year of the Elves' Weeping, 1462 DR]], Jenevelle was left alone in the woods at night and directed to find her way home, as was tradition among the Selûnite faithful's soon-to-be-adult children. Unfortunately, a group of [[Sharran]] priestesses led by Mother Superior [[Viconia DeVir]] plotted to abduct the child during the rite and utilize her for their own ends. Arnell Hallowleaf learned of the Sharrans' plan, took on his wolf form and tried to rescue his daughter. He was too late however, and Viconia and Shar's servants abducted Jenevelle.

The couple were taken to the same Sharran church as their daughter, called [[Cloister of Sombre Embrace]]. During their imprisonment, they saw their daughter Jenevelle, now renamed Shadowheart, and other Sharran neophytes being brainwashed into worshiping the Lady of Loss. They were made the subjects of their own daughter's training in torture and they had to watch their daughter's memory and personality being erased over and over. The Sharrans also cursed their daughter with a bond of torment between the parents and her. Despite being imprisoned and tortured for years, the couple still hoped to see their daughter to become herself again.

They were intended to be the last stage of Shadowheart's full conversion to the Lady of Loss: to kill her own parents in veneration of Shar. She was intended to become Shar's new [[Chosen]] and reform the order of [[Dark Justiciars]] from the [[Gauntlet of Shar]].

As the [[Absolute crisis]] shook [[Baldur's Gate]], Shadowheart may have discovered her true nature, which led her to confront the dark goddess. Shadowheart could choose to abandon Shar for Selûne and give her long-suffering parents and herself freedom by ending Emmeline's and Arnell's lives, or choose to save her parents and bravely bear the curse.
