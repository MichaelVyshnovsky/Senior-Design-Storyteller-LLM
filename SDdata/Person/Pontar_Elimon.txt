Pontar Elimon was a sage in Arrabar around the year 1370 DR. He was known for his tedious, and overly cautious personality.
Pontar sold information to anyone who paid him. He was protected by the Zhentarim and in exchange he acted as a spy for them in the area. Despite exceptional circumstances, he has cheated death on more than a few occasions.
Among Pontars possessions were a cloak of the bat, and rings of mind shielding and shooting stars.
