Oldyle Belark was the patriarch of the Belark family in Delzimmer until at least the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR. The Belarks were one of four powerful merchant families that were the de facto rulers of Delzimmer.
Oldyle was an extremely corpulent man with bowed legs and long arms. His hair was black in his youth and he had the family nose, a large, hooked beak of flesh. Because the livery of their personal security force was mostly colored crimson, Oldyle and his family rarely wore this color, except possibly for weddings and funerals.
Oldyle was aggressive and snobbish, but could put his pride temporarily aside and act like a dim-witted brute (the impression that outsiders frequently took on first sight) in order to glean information about possible allies or adversaries in business.
