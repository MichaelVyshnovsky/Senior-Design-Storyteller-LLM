'''Oldyle Belark''' was the patriarch of the [[Belark]] family in [[Delzimmer]] until at least the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]]. The Belarks were one of four powerful merchant families that were the ''de facto'' rulers of Delzimmer.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|42}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 35: A First Glance at Delzimmer}}

==Description==
Oldyle was an extremely corpulent man with bowed legs and long arms. His hair was black in his youth and he had the family nose, a large, hooked beak of flesh. Because the livery of their personal security force was mostly colored crimson, Oldyle and his family rarely wore this color, except possibly for weddings and funerals.

==Personality==
Oldyle was aggressive and snobbish, but could put his pride temporarily aside and act like a dim-witted brute (the impression that outsiders frequently took on first sight) in order to glean information about possible allies or adversaries in business.
