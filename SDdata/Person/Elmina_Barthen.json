The reason for this is unknown.\nBarthen had a kindly manner.\nBarthen employed two local lads, Ander and Thistle,\nBarthen had a good business relationship with Phandalins Townmaster, Harbin Wester, and helped Harbin and his half-brother, Tibor Wester, to circumvent Neverwinter taxes by transporting supplies to the latters logging business.\nIn 1491 DR, Barthen and other townsfolk of Phandalin were constantly harassed by the Redbrands, which made local trade more difficult. She was willing to share information with anybody who wished to sort the Redbrands out.\nDuring this time, a dwarf explorer and friend of Barthen named Gundren Rockseeker believed he had located the Wave Echo Cave. Elmina was excited by the potential discovery, and agreed to help supply Gundren and his brothers, Nundro and Tharden. Gundren had hired a new group of adventurers to bring a wagon full of equipment from Neverwinter to Barthens Provisions, for which Barthen would agree to handover 10 gp each. Gundren let Barthen know that he would meet her at the store before the adventurers, however Gundren never arrived and his brothers both failed to show up to receive their resupplies. This led Barthen to worry.\nBy 1496 DR, Barthen had closed Barthens Provisions and moved on from Phandalin."
