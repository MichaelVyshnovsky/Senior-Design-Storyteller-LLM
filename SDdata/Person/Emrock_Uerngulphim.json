        "mainbody": "'''Emrock Uerngulphim''' was a merchant in [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].",
        "Relationship": "Emrock always had with him his [[mantari]] companion [[Vleem]]. Unknown to many, he was a friend to King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]], and [[Alusair Obarskyr]]. One of his lovers was [[Jhaele Silvermane]] of [[Old Skull Inn]] in [[Shadowdale]].",
        "History": "Emrock was born in [[Mirabar]] and explored the [[North]] with his prospector parents until they were killed by [[orc]]s. Then he went south, starting a career as a thief and caravan guard. During this time, he saw many places, like the borders of [[Thay]], [[Calimshan]], [[Sword Coast]], and the [[Frozenfar]].\n\nIn time, he became a caravan master but still thieved until some angry acquaintances started to hunt for him. After a very long hunt, his pursers abandoned Emrock in a peak inside orc territory, believing he would never come back alive. Instead, there Emrock met and befriended Vleem. They remained together for twelve years.",
        "Activities": "Emrock was an able trader and gambler but by 1370 DR he mostly worked as a messenger. He often used Myth Drannor as a hideout but had a secret lair in [[the Vast]] and one other near [[Sundabar]]. Often he and his flying companion saved adventurers trapped in Myth Drannor."
