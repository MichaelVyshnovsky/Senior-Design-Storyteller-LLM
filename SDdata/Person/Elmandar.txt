'''Elmandar''' was an [[elf]] or [[half-elf]] [[mage]] and noted [[astronomy|astronomer]] in the city of [[Bral]] on the [[Rock of Bral]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the proprietor of Elmandar's Star Charts.

==Activities==
Servicing the strong demand from [[spelljammer]] navigators for highly accurate [[star chart]]s, Elmandar drew and sold charts of guaranteed accuracy that fetched prices of 300â€“800 [[gp]] each. Furthermore, Elmander had a small staff of his own navigators and cartographers who would join the crews of [[tradesmen]] spelljammers in order to check and update charts during flights. Moreover, Elmandar charts could be brought back at any time to be updated, free of charge.

Elmandar's Star Charts was found in the [[Middle City]] of Bral on Cuttle Street overlooking the edge of the Rock, near the [[Wallis Tannery]].<ref>

==Relationships==
A former student and employee of Elmandar's was [[Teledir Sunstrider]], who established the rival business [[Nautical Charts of Bral]].

==History==
A former [[adventurer]], and the helmsman aboard a [[spelljammer]] [[galleon]] called the ''[[Eclipse]]'', Elmandar retired from that life and started a more rewarding career in surveying and charting.

==Possessions==
Elmandar kept a model of the ''Eclipse'' in his observatory. He also had a [[cat]].
