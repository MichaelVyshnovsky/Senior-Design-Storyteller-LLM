Elmandar was an elf or half-elf mage and noted astronomer in the city of Bral on the Rock of Bral in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was the proprietor of Elmandars Star Charts.
Servicing the strong demand from spelljammer navigators for highly accurate star charts, Elmandar drew and sold charts of guaranteed accuracy that fetched prices of 300â€“800 gp each. Furthermore, Elmander had a small staff of his own navigators and cartographers who would join the crews of tradesmen spelljammers in order to check and update charts during flights. Moreover, Elmandar charts could be brought back at any time to be updated, free of charge.
Elmandars Star Charts was found in the Middle City of Bral on Cuttle Street overlooking the edge of the Rock, near the Wallis Tannery.
A former student and employee of Elmandars was Teledir Sunstrider, who established the rival business Nautical Charts of Bral.
A former adventurer, and the helmsman aboard a spelljammer galleon called the Eclipse, Elmandar retired from that life and started a more rewarding career in surveying and charting.
Elmandar kept a model of the Eclipse in his observatory. He also had a cat.
