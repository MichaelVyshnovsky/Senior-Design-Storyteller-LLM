        "mainbody": "High Lord Abbot Grigor Khazaar was the head of the Abbey of the Blinding Truth in the city of Westgate during the late 14 century DR. He was a militant cleric of Tyr who led his clergy of priests, monks, and paladins in a campaign against the criminal guild known as the Night Masks.\nThe high priests rhetoric struck a chord with Westgates conservative Seirkas Urdo, and the two met fairly often, either at private dinners or after service within the temples chapel.\nThe Night Masks had Lady Thistle Thalavar spy upon Khazaar, and report his activities to the guilds master, Orbakh (who was in fact a clone of the dark mage Manshoon). The Night King considered ordering the murder of the Tyrran priest, but believed his martyrdom would attract more followers of the Just Deity to his city.\nIn 1372 DR, shortly after the founding of the abbey, High Lord Abbot Khazaar appealed to the citys noble council, in an effort to rid the city of its lawless thieves and assassins."
