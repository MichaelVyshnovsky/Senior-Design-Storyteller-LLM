Nordom Whistleklik, also known as the backwards modron, was a quadrone that took part in the construction of the Rubikon, a modron-made dungeon in Limbo. Due to the chaotic energies of the plane, Nordom went rogue.
Nordom had a green face with wide, elliptical eyes. Unlike most quadrones, Nordom had a second pair of arms instead of wings. Additionally, he had a lens welded to his body, which would drop over his right eye and function like a scope.
He had the ability to see "cracks in the Multiverse" as he described them, which were in fact were portals. He displayed a lot of confusion and questioning regarding his own identity and individuality, as well as the world around him, seemingly unable to understand it in any way, especially before leaving the Rubikon. However, despite his rogue nature, he still felt the urge to follow orders and leadership. 
Nordom wielded a pair of gear spirits that were shaped and functioned like crossbows.
Nordoms last remembered directive before he went rogue was that he was to assist in constructing the Rubikon, which was an artificial dungeon created in the Plane of Limbo by modrons to study what attracts adventures to dungeons. The chaotic energies of the plane however, twisted all constructs within the Rubikon, resulting in the Evil Wizard Construct (designed as the "final boss" of the challenge) turning against its creators and ignoring directives. Because of this, Nordoms overseer, the Creative Director, attempted to destroy the Evil Wizard, but was ultimately defeated. The loss of his leader, combined with the energy of limbo seeping into him, left him in a confused, directionless state, which resulted in him splitting off from the energies of Mechanus and becoming stuck in the Rubikon. He started having first signs of a personality, as he removed his wings and changed them into an extra pair of arms, as he suspected that he "did not like them". 
In the year , the final incarnation of The Nameless One and Morte visited the Rubikon via a portal located inside a Modron-shaped artifact. When they located the confused construct, Morte described it as a "backwards modron", from which Nordom extrapolated his name. Doing so broke him out of the loop he was stuck in, trying to repeatedly understand his identity. Afterwards, The Nameless One proposed himself as a replacement for the Director. Nordom happily accepted him as his new leader, and strove to assist him in his quest.
When a Great Modron March passed through Waterdeep somewhere in the late 15 century DR, Nordom attempted to assist the defense of the city, but inadvertently empowered the invading modrons with the lightning crossbow bolts he used as ammunition.
After the march, Nordom remained in Waterdeep, even taking part in a mission to protect one of the Lords of Waterdeep from an assassination attempt. Due to his resemblance to his non-rogue kin, he was unpopular with Waterdhavians affected by the march.
