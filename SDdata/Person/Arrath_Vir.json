        "mainbody": "ath was a dwarven monk who lived in Waterdeep in the late 1470s DR.  Raths true name was Arrath Vir but he was known to nearly everyone simply as Rath.  He despised dwarven culture and turned his back on his people and his gods.\nRath wore his face clean shaven which was very unusual for a dwarf and often caused other dwarves to challenge him.  He was very handsome for a dwarf and fastidious about his appearance. One side of his face was severely burned by Ilira Nathalan but Rath had it partially healed. Rath wore a heavy black robe at all times.\nRath was an expert at unarmed combat and was able to move with preternatural speed and grace. He carried a light blade of masterwork quality, which he refused to use against all but the most worthy of opponents.\nRath left his clan at an early age and trained at a monastery deep under a mountain.  Once he learned all he could he slew his masters and traveled to Waterdeep where he began working as an agent for Lilten, the high priest of Beshaba. In 1479 DR, at Liltens request, he killed a high ranking priestess of Sune named Lorien Dawnbringer, in her chambers but was seriously wounded by Loriens friend Ilira Nathalan. Shortly thereafter, Lilten hired him to kidnap a powerful young wizard named Myrin. Rath was successful in his mission but gave Kalen Dren clues to his location because he wanted to duel the young paladin. Kalen was able to defeat Rath by knocking him off a roof but spared Raths life by turning him over to the city watch. Rath served time in the Waterdeep dungeon. Later he was one of the inmates of Helms Hold in Neverwinter. He spent his time meditating to atone his sins."
