'''Imphras Heltharn I''', known as '''Imphras the Great''', was the eighth Paladin-King of [[Impiltur]] and the first ruler of the [[Heltharn Dynasty]].

==Relationships==
Imphras Heltharn was a descendant of a line of [[paladin]]s who were related to the [[Durlarven Dynasty]] by marriage, through one of the sisters of King [[Bellodar III]].

Imphras married the [[sorceress]] [[Sambral]], with whom he had fought against the [[hobgoblin]] horde. They had two children, a son, [[Imbrar I|Imbrar]], and a daughter, [[Ilmara]]. Both would later sit on the throne.

==Possessions==
Imphras was in possession of a legacy of old treasures, including the ''[[Crown of Narfell]]'' and over 100 magical swords.

==History==
Imphras I was born in [[1063 DR]].

After the battle, a dying Soargar revealed the location of a secret stash of treasures from the previous dynasty, which he left to Imphras.

Two years later, after much diplomacy among the city-states,

Imphras had a tower constructed in [[Filur]] to serve as his royal palace.

In [[1110 DR]], King Imphras allied his army with that of [[Thesk]] to defend [[Phent]] against the invading forces of [[Thay]]. Imphras was victorious, and the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]] were defeated.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|70}}

Imphras died in [[1122 DR]], shortly after the death of his wife.
