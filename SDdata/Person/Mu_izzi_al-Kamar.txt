'''Mu'izzi al-Kamar''' was the head of the [[House of Al-Kamari]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
As of 1367, Mu'izzi had been the head of the family for two decades.

==Rumors and Legends==
Unbeknownst to his family, Mu'izzi was possessed by a high priest of the [[yak-man|yak-men]] called the [[Unspeakable]].

==History==
During the mid-1340's [[DR]], Mu'izzi undertook an expedition to discover a new trade route through the [[Haunted Lands]] to [[Utaqa]]. This trip forever changed his life. The caravan was scattered by a violent sandstorm and Mu'izzi was captured by a pair of [[dao]] slaves who delivered the patriarch into the hands of the [[yikaria|yikarians]]. The leader of that group of yikarians, a powerful creature named the Unspeakable possessed Mu'izzi's mind and body, controlling the patriarch for decades. Mu'izzi could still see and hear through his body, but was unable to do anything about the possession. The ordeal eventually drove him insane.
