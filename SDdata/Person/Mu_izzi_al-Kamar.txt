Muizzi al-Kamar was the head of the House of Al-Kamari in 1367 DR.
As of 1367, Muizzi had been the head of the family for two decades.
Unbeknownst to his family, Muizzi was possessed by a high priest of the yak-men called the Unspeakable.
During the mid-1340s DR, Muizzi undertook an expedition to discover a new trade route through the Haunted Lands to Utaqa. This trip forever changed his life. The caravan was scattered by a violent sandstorm and Muizzi was captured by a pair of dao slaves who delivered the patriarch into the hands of the yikarians. The leader of that group of yikarians, a powerful creature named the Unspeakable possessed Muizzis mind and body, controlling the patriarch for decades. Muizzi could still see and hear through his body, but was unable to do anything about the possession. The ordeal eventually drove him insane.
