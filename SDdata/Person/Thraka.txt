'''Thraka''' was a [[half-orc]] mercenary in [[Sildëyuir]] in [[1372 DR]].
 
==History==
Thraka was an orc mercenary captain. He was recruited by the [[nilshai]] sorcerer [[Tolg'byri]] to conquer the [[Night Realm]] from [[Mourel Duskwalker]]. He became the second-in-command of the mercenary army after [[Savera]] took control of the group and [[Guerik]] went mad.

==Activities==
Thraka posed as the mercenary leader while Savera suggested to him what to say using [[telepathy]].

==Personality==
Thraka was very nervous about his current situation. He was very scared of Savera but was [[Dominate person|dominated]] by her and followed her orders without questions.
