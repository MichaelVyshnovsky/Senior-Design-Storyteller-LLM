Thraka was a half-orc mercenary in SildÃ«yuir in 1372 DR.
Thraka was an orc mercenary captain. He was recruited by the nilshai sorcerer Tolgbyri to conquer the Night Realm from Mourel Duskwalker. He became the second-in-command of the mercenary army after Savera took control of the group and Guerik went mad.
Thraka posed as the mercenary leader while Savera suggested to him what to say using telepathy.
Thraka was very nervous about his current situation. He was very scared of Savera but was dominated by her and followed her orders without questions.
