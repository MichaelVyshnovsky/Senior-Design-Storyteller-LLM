Azhaq was a silver dragon paladin of Xymor (Bahamut) and the barb of the Talons of Justice after the Rage of Dragons of 1373 DR.
In 1373 DR, Azhaq and his fellow Moonwing were sent to capture the rebellious song dragon Karasendrieth, but were defeated by Dorn Graybrooks team. 
Because of his failure, Lareth, corrupted by the Rage, tried to kill him, but the gold dragon Llimark saved his life in the last minute.
After the metallic dragons changed their minds and decided to join the fight against Sammaster, Azhaq helped break the chromatic dragons siege of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose.
After the metallic dragons changed their minds and decided to join the fight against Sammaster, Azhaq along his fellow Talons were sent to attack Sammasters citadel. In the final battle, most of the Talons of Justice died, including their leader, Havarlan. 
After the Rage, Azhaq tasked himself with rebuilding the Talons of Justice, stronger than before, eventually ascending to the rank of leader of the order. He re-structured the order, allowing gold and bronze dragons, as well as gold and silver half-dragons, to join the order to bolster its numbers.
He also worked alongside the gold dragons Larendrammagar and Tamarand in some missions. Their last mission was to help the Talons locate a former member of the order who had become a rebel, the dragon Arendelonthos.
