Lady '''Arilain''' was a [[Netherese]] [[archwizard]] that lived during the [[Shadowed Age]].

==History==
The female [[arcanist]] controlled the [[Opus]] [[Netherese enclave|enclave]], a great flying city in the empire of [[Netheril]]. In {{YearlinkConvert|3518|NY}}, the talented archwizard discovered that the great [[Karsus]] was developing a new extremely powerful [[spell]]. The spellcasters of Opus managed to divine the effects of this spell, which would become known as ''[[Karsus's avatar]]''. Arilain warned the other arcanists of Opus, but personally set out to approach Karsus himself. However, after meeting with Karsus, she was never heard of again.
