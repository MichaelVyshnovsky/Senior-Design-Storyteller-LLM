        "History": "In [[1361 DR]], Chical tried to convince [[Poshtli]], a fellow Eagle Knight and nephew of [[Naltecona]], to abandon his fellows [[Halloran]] and [[Erixitl]] to their fates.\n\nLater, alongside the [[Jaguar Knights|Jaguar Knight]] [[Kalnak]], Chical was chosen by [[Naltecona]] to lead an ambush against the [[Golden Legion]] at [[Palul]], despite Chical's objection that this was not an honorable plan.\n\nTogether, Chical and Kalnak welcomed the strangers while secretly their elite army waited in hiding. However, the [[mage]] [[Darien]] discovered the plan thanks to her magic and informed [[Cordell]], who was at Kalnak's side. Quickly, Cordell surprised and killed Kalnak.\n\nChical, however, survived the defeat and quickly went back to Nexal in [[eagle]] form to report the failure to Naltecona. After this defeat, the Nexalan ruler changed his mind and proclaimed the strangers as gods, ordering Chical to dismiss the army.\n\nWhen Naltecona was imprisoned by the legionaries, Chical tried to lead a platoon to liberate him but was dismissed by Naltecona himself.\n\nLater, he appealed to Poshti, by then the regent, to try again but with no success.\n\nDuring the [[Night of Wailing]], he discussed with [[Hoxitl]] their battle plan to slay all the strangers.\n\nHe survived the transformation of the [[Viperhands]] into monsters and became the unofficial leader of the [[Nexalan]] survivors."
