'''Giddeon the Believer''' was a [[mage]] philosopher and the creator of the [[enchanted]] ''[[kinetic spear]]'', who lived sometime in the late 10{{th}} and early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Giddeon was a renowned researcher and philosopher of the natural arcane magic currents who developed a theory that stated that the world had natural "currents" of magical energy, and one could tap into these "currents." According to Giddeon's teachings, once a wizard could understand the "currents," they could use the flow of energy and draw from it via certain [[spell]]s or focus devices. It was believed that Giddeon the Believer perished in a massive laboratory explosion of the {{YearlinkName|1010}}, with only several items surviving. His ''kinetic spear'' was one of these items, created to tap into the world's natural magic currents and channel them into explosive force.
