'''Umbralax''' was a [[shadow dragon|shadow]] [[dracolich]] that dwelled within the [[Darklands (shadowfell)|Darklands]] of the [[Plane of Shadow]].{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|14}}

==History==
When the [[Faer√ªn]]ian village of [[Hespheira]] was transported to the Plane of Shadow in the {{YearlinkName|1024}}, members of the [[Brotherhood of Light]] travelled the planes in pursuit. Umbralax encountered the holy warriors in its domain, and slew many of their numbers before they escaped with Hespheira's villagers.

Umbralax bided its time for over a century, before traveling to the [[Prime Material plane]] with an army of [[wraith]]s. The dracolich waited in the returned ruins of Hespheira, drawing the [[Lathander]]ite champions known as the [[Order of the Aster]] into a fight that came to be known as the [[Battle of Hespheira]]. While Umbralax was defeated and his army scattered, his [[phylactery]] remained and the ''[[portal]]'' to his home on the Plane of Shadow remained open for some time.
