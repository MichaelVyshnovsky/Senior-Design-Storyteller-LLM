        "mainbody": "'''Lulaku''' was a [[hunting spider katanga]] who served the [[Mother of a Thousand Young]] within the [[Fire Mountain]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Lulaku was a [[spider katanga]] who wielded [[dagger]]s in combat.",
        "Abilities": "When faced to battle, Lulaku promptly tried to have her daggers [[enchanted]] by [[Fusamu]], a spider katanga [[sorceress]]. When faced with overwhelming odds, Lulaku was likely to try and escape with her life.",
        "Possessions": "Lulaku was armed with bone daggers, a [[longspear]], but her [[poison|venom]]ous bite was the katanga's most dangerous weapon.",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Tribe of the Wise Ones]] became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded [[spider katanga]], the Mother of a Thousand Young, was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Lulaku was posted to guard a stockade of captured heroes of the Living Jungle, enemies of the Mother of a Thousand Young. She was accompanied by [[Turanu]] and Fusamu. The spider katanga were guarding several [[Nubari]] [[human]]s and [[lizardfolk]]. Lulaku was loyal to [[Talunuku]], a spider katanga who was secretly responsible for the poison and sought to become the new Mother of a Thousand Young.\n\nLulaku's fate was unknown; however, she and other guards were faced with heroes of the Living Jungle that were sent to rescue the prisoners and stop the Mother of a Thousand Young, likely resulting in her death."
