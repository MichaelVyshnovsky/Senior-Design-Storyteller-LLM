        "mainbody": "'''Olgerd''' was a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[fighter]] who lived in [[Neverwinter]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "He maintained the belief that each person at the [[Neverwinter Academy]] had to prove their value, and he required the same from the [[Hero of Neverwinter]].",
        "History": "Long before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Olgerd came to study at the Neverwinter Academy so that he could become a member of the [[Neverwinter Militia]]. Following his graduation from the Academy, he dedicated nearly 140 years to serving in the Militia until age caught up with him. He had no family. Reluctant to retire, he was appointed as the Academy's quartermaster.\n\nIn the 1372 DR, as the quartermaster, he gave the Hero of Neverwinter the equipment required for a student of the Academy. Olgerd also shared rumors regarding the deadly disease known as the [[Wailing Death]]. After his shift he wanted to look at the famous [[Aribeth de Tylmarande|Lady Aribeth]] who had come to the Academy and get her blessing. He was killed later that day in the attack on the Academy."
