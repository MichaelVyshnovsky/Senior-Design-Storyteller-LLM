Orstrar Galannavruk was a merchant from the city of Zazesspur in Tethyr who worked alongside Andred Kuroone in the late 15 century DR.
Orstrar was a long-haired human man with a bushy beard who generally left negotiation and haggling to his more charismatic partner.
In the late 15 century DR, Orstrar and Andred made a living by trading in thael leaf (a type of pipeweed flavoring), herbs, and spices, as well as dried foods and fruits, such as apricots. Orstrar was the coin behind the enterprise. Some of their customers were found in Triboar and Scornubel and included Lurandural Veltree of Scornubels merchants guild, the Halanthor. When dealing with the High Holy House of Coinâ€Ž, Orstrar prepared a taste test for the clients of thael leaf in a chase-decorated globe incense burner, while Andred Kuroone negotiated the price and advertised the goods.
