Chezzaran was a blue dragon who lived in the ruined dwarven city of Ascore during the 15 century DR.
Along with its sibling Anaxaster, Chezzaran made its lair within one of the demolished dwarven stone ships that were found in the ruins of the city.
Chezzaran and Anaxaster were sired by the ancient blue dragon Iymrith. The two younger dragons spent much of their time sparring over the skies of Anauroch.
