Ghalhunt stayed to guard Marlin, and lit the fire in the lodge out of his own initiative, without prompting. He afterwards went out to get more firewood however, almost instantly he crossed the threshold, he was decapitated, and his head thrown at the fireplace by a blueflame ghost under the control of the sorceress Cymmarra, the Lady of Ghosts.\nHis head was completely burnt by the time Marlins other two bullyblades came back to the house."
