'''Dryfle Doon''' was a [[gold dwarf]] commoner, displaced by [[The Absolute]], and as a refugee, sought shelter in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''I didn't think there'd be so many inns here - we're spoilt for choice.''|Giftu Hudd}}

==Description==
Dryfle was a gold dwarf with a rosy complexion, light brown hair, and brown eyes. She wore a simple [[leather armor]] and a leather circlet.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, an army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Dryfle Doon and brothers [[Giftu Hudd|Giftu]] and [[Hasmet Hudd]] fled from the Absolutists for over a [[tenday]], and eventually found their way to the city walls and were allowed to enter the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]], unlike many other refugees who were refused entrance due to lack of [[coin]] or paperwork. Dryfle was impressed with a number of inns in the Lower City, happy to have options and coin to afford lodgings.
