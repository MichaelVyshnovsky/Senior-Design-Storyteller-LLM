Valmorba was the undertaker and mortician of the Lower City Mortuary in the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Valmorba was a human woman of advanced age. She had gray eyes and hair bleached with time, gathered in a bun. She spoke in a kind, compassionate, and soft voice. As a gravekeeper, she did not tolerate anyone desecrating her cemetery, and her kind heart did not like killing, even if it were kobold graverobbers who were killed. Valmorba kept a diary written in an archaic and beautiful script.
Valmorbas faith allowed her to use the shield of faith clerical spell.
Valmorbas mortuary was established in the  and offered coffins, funerals, ceremonies, and embalming to the residents of the Gate. By the , when the strife of serial murders committed by the Cult of Bhaal and the looming war with the Cult of the Absolute, Valmorbas mortuary was overwhelmed. The old woman struggled with procuring and having the coffins built in time. One of the children buried by Valmorba was Ayana, daughter of Fiona. The mother thanked the mortician for going above and beyond for the dead child and burying her teddy bear along with Ayana. Valmorba was known to waive fees when possible for the poor, especially parents burying their children. One of the children was a "water baby," a child who loved the sea. Valmorba prepared the childs body using weavemoss and styled her hair with chuttlers oil.
