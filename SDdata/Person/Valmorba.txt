'''Valmorba''' was the undertaker and mortician of the [[Lower City Mortuary]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|I've never felt a deep connection to the gods - that is the Mortarch's purview, not mine. But moments like today give me purpose. As a gravekeeper, I provide comfort in grief. Beauty in death. Peace in sorrow. I only wish I did not have to do it so often.|Excerpt from Valmorba's journal}}

==Description==
Valmorba was a [[human]] woman of advanced age. She had gray eyes and hair bleached with time, gathered in a bun. She spoke in a kind, compassionate, and soft voice. As a gravekeeper, she did not tolerate anyone desecrating her cemetery, and her kind heart did not like killing, even if it were [[kobold]] graverobbers who were killed. Valmorba kept a diary written in an archaic and beautiful script.

==Abilities==
Valmorba's faith allowed her to use the ''[[shield of faith]]'' [[cleric]]al [[spell]].

==History==
Valmorba's mortuary was established in the {{YearlinkName|1486}} and offered coffins, funerals, ceremonies, and embalming to the residents of the Gate. By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when the strife of serial murders committed by the [[Cult of Bhaal]] and the looming war with the [[Cult of the Absolute]], Valmorba's mortuary was overwhelmed. The old woman struggled with procuring and having the coffins built in time. One of the children buried by Valmorba was [[Ayana (Baldur's Gate)|Ayana]], daughter of [[Fiona]]. The mother thanked the mortician for going above and beyond for the dead child and burying her [[teddy bear]] along with Ayana. Valmorba was known to waive fees when possible for the poor, especially parents burying their children. One of the children was a "water baby," a child who loved the sea. Valmorba prepared the child's body using [[weavemoss]] and styled her hair with [[chuttler's oil]].
