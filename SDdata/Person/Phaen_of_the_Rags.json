        "mainbody": "'''Phaen of the Rags''' was a lowly [[wizard]] of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] and an ally of the [[Legion of the Chimera]], active in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Phaen? Ah, yes, Phaen. We met him in Luskan. He serves other interests, but takes Targos' coin. He is death's friend in this place. He hired us, [[Black Geoffrey|Geoffrey]], [[Kickshaw]], and [[Blanchard Pike|Blanchard]], to escort him here, and we have done that, and now the rest suckle on Targos' breast, drawing gold from goblin fear. Foolishness...If you speak to him, keep your [[sword]] close. His loyalties are... peculiar ones.''|[[Koluhm Bonecutter]] of [[Myrkul]]}}",
        "History": "Phaen claimed that he had committed some fatal mistake – the details of which he never shared with anyone – and as a result was cast out of the Arcane Brotherhood. He lost his [[robe]], and he began wearing a ''[[Phaen's robe of rags|robe of rags]]'', helping him appear poor and nonthreatening. At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Phaen allied himself with the Legion of the Chimera that menaced the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]]. While still in Luskan, Phaen of the Rags met a band of \"adventurers\" from [[Cormyr]], the [[Iron Collar Band]], who had fled the the law in the Forest Kingdom. He promised the band easy coin that could be made in [[Targos]], a town besieged by [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s of the Legion of the Chimera.\n\nPhaen and the Iron Collar Band entered the employ of the Speaker of Targos, Lord [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]]. In secret from his traveling companions and the new employer, Phaen aided the Legion in smuggling goblin marauders into Targos by magical means. The invaders caused death and chaos but eventually were slain by a recently arrived band of adventurers from Luskan, later called the [[goblin slayers of Targos]].\n\nAfter recovering an expended [[scroll]] of magical transportation from a goblin sapper named [[Rukwurm]], the goblin slayers tracked the vellum sheet to Phaen at the makeshift barracks where he was staying. He attempted to lie through his teeth to the group, but eventually abandoned the charade and attacked them with the aid of another band of goblins he conjured. Phaen did not survive the confrontation, and Lord Ulbrec rewarded Targos's new allies for exposing the saboteur.\n\nLater events cast doubt on his story of expulsion from the Brotherhood. [[Harshom|Beastmaster Harshom]], who heavily implied that he was a current member of the Brotherhood, claimed that Phaen answered to him."
