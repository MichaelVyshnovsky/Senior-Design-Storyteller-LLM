        "mainbody": "Kyristan, also known as the Dead King, was a planewalking lich and author of magical tomes. His works included Kyristans Mysteries and Studies in Death.\nKyristan was born on a world other than Toril.\nAt some point, Kyristan joined the wizards guild of fellow planewalker Dar Malson, situated in the town of Northbank.This non-Torilian Northbank is described in Wizards Challenge and is separate from the Northbank in Silverymoon. Due to his expertise and power, he was able to ascend the ranks and become guildmaster in a short amount of time. His leadership was successful, but his power and magical prowess eventually led him to the path of lichdom.\nIn his studies, Kyristan invented several spells and, by experimenting on fellow guild members, first created what he called spectral wizards, a new kind of undead.\nAfter successfully turning himself into a lich, Kyristans ambitions shifted towards the creation of an army of undead. Around the , his plot to change a large group of wizards into spectral wizards was foiled, in part by Dar Malson.\nAround the , Kyristans Mysteries was stolen from the Lark in Suzail. The thief was found dead and questioned by the mage, confiding that he stole the book on orders from a \"wealthy and handsome man\". The Lark theorized that this employer was Kyristan himself, and that the thief successfully returned the book to its author, but other sages contested that both Kyristans and the books whereabouts were unknown at that point in time.\nKyristans personal sigil resembled the symbol of the Doomguard, suggesting he mightve been a member of the faction at one point.\n*Kyristans spells"
