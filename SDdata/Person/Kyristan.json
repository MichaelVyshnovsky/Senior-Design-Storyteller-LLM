        "mainbody": "'''Kyristan''', also known as the '''Dead King''', was a [[planewalking]] [[lich]] and author of magical tomes. His works included ''[[Kyristan's Mysteries]]'' and ''[[Studies in Death]]''.",
        "History": "Kyristan was born on a world other than [[Toril]].\n\nAt some point, Kyristan joined the wizard's guild of fellow planewalker [[Dar Malson]], situated in the town of Northbank.<ref group=\"note\">This non-Torilian Northbank is described in ''[[Wizard's Challenge]]'' and is separate from the [[Northbank]] in [[Silverymoon]]. Due to his expertise and power, he was able to ascend the ranks and become guildmaster in a short amount of time. His leadership was successful, but his power and magical prowess eventually led him to the path of lichdom.\n\nIn his studies, Kyristan invented several spells and, by experimenting on fellow guild members, first created what he called [[spectral wizard]]s, a new kind of [[undead]].\n\nAfter successfully turning himself into a lich, Kyristan's ambitions shifted towards the creation of an army of undead. Around the {{YearlinkName|1289}}, his plot to change a large group of wizards into spectral wizards was foiled, in part by Dar Malson.\n\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1354}}, ''Kyristan's Mysteries'' was stolen from the [[Lark]] in [[Suzail]]. The thief was found dead and questioned by the mage, confiding that he stole the book on orders from a \"wealthy and handsome man\". The Lark theorized that this employer was Kyristan himself, and that the thief successfully returned the book to its author, but other sages contested that both Kyristan's and the book's whereabouts were unknown at that point in time.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Kyristan's personal sigil resembled the symbol of the [[Doomguard]], suggesting he might've been a member of the faction at one point.",
