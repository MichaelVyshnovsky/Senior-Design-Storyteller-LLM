        "mainbody": "'''Yornar the Tracker''' was a legendary [[ranger]] of [[the North]] in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]]. One of the faithful of [[Mielikki]], he was gifted by the Lady of the Forest with the holy [[spellbook]] that came to carry his name—''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]''.",
        "Description": "He was said to be a giant of a man, gaunt and bearded.",
        "Activities": "Yornar roamed the eastern backlands of the [[Sword Coast North]] and as far as the [[Silver Marches]], only rarely setting foot within the cities of [[Everlund]], [[Neverwinter]], and [[Silverymoon]]. Yet he was well known to the foresters, trappers, and prospectors who journeyed these lands. He had a reputation for emerging from a storm or the dark of night, giving aid to travelers in need, and departing without even a goodbye, all with only a smile and few if any words spoken if he could help it.\n\nHe devoted much of his time to casting minor [[spell]]s that would provide shelters and food for [[bear]]s and [[snail]]s within the woodlands.",
        "History": {
            "Legacy": "Mielikki's book would be passed on again and again down through the centuries. As Yornar was the first to carry it, it was named for him thereafter—''Yornar's Trail Companion''.\n\nOne other [[magic item]] would be named for him: the very similar ''[[Yornar's crescent]]''.<ref>"
