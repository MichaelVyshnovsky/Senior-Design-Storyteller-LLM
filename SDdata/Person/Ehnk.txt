'''Ehnk''' was a shaman of [[Gruumsh]] and leader of the [[Crooked Path]] tribe in [[Many-Arrows]] in [[1484 DR]].
 
==Activities==
Ehnk took care of the [[Dark Arrow Keep|Pit]] arena.
 
==History==
Just after the start of the [[Darkening]], Ehnk, being a total pragmatic, tried to identify the winning side in a war between [[Luruar]] and [[orc]]s and [[drow]] in order to join the winning side. At last, he decided to settled his position by fighting in the Pit instead.
