Ehnk was a shaman of Gruumsh and leader of the Crooked Path tribe in Many-Arrows in 1484 DR.
Ehnk took care of the Pit arena.
Just after the start of the Darkening, Ehnk, being a total pragmatic, tried to identify the winning side in a war between Luruar and orcs and drow in order to join the winning side. At last, he decided to settled his position by fighting in the Pit instead.
