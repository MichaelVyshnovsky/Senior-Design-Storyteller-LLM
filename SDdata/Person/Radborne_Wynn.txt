Radborne Wynn was earl of the Storming Gorge in Hartsvale in the late 14 century DR.
Rayborne Wynn was a stout man who bore himself impressively yet had a wild look. Near the end of his life, Earl Wynn had long gray hair and a beard. He often wore a cloak made from the silvered fur of stoats,
In addition to ruling over the lands of the Stroming Gorge in the north,
Earl Wynn rode upon a gray stallion.
The silver mines that supported the economy of Hartsvale were mined by the serfs of Earl Wynn.
Earl Wynns family first discovered silver in the Gorge of the Silver Wyrm hundreds of years before his birth.
In 1369 DR, during the war with giants that occurred during the time that Queen Brianna Burdun rose to power, Earl Wynn was slain while trying to prevent the queens kidnapping by firbolgs. His chest was crushed when he was stepped on by a wounded and thrashing Galgadayle, who had been injured by the young Avner.
