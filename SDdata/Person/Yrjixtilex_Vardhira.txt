'''Yrjixtilex Vardhira''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Tymanther]] and the matriarch of [[Clan Yrjixtilex]] in [[1486 DR]]. She was a direct descendant of [[Esham-Ana]].

==Description==
Vardhira had coppery-tinged scales with a silvery-gray patina.

==History==
In 1486 DR, Vardhira got involved in an investigation into a series of murders in [[Djerad Thymar]], when a city guard member of Clan Yrjixtilex was killed by a [[maurezhi]] servant of the [[God]]-King [[Gilgeam]].

In the wake of the [[first Tymanther-Unther War]], Vardhira allied with other clan elders, such as [[Verthisathurgiesh Anala]] and [[Fenkenkabradon Ishkhanak]], to put forward [[Yrjixtilex Kallan]] as a candidate for the [[Vanquisher]] title, in the hopes of raising her clan's status, and to outmaneuver [[Clan Kepeshkmolik]].
