Fuladayah bint Bulad was the daughter of the famed weaponsmith Bulad the Steelmaker. She inhabited Hiyal around 1367 DR.
Fuladayah found her father dead with a dagger in his neck. The authorities ruled his death an accident, but she remained convinced someone with powerful friends at court was behind his death.
Luckily, Fuladayah possessed her fathers smithing skills, allowing the House of Bulad mark upon their weaponry to still mean something after the death of her father.
