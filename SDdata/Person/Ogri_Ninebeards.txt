Ogri was a dwarf with a red beard.
As a member of the loosely organized Swords of Leilon, Ogri protected Leilon until its fall in 1385 DR.
In the 14 century DR, Ogri Ninebeards was an adventurer in the region around Leilon. Together with Aubrey Silverspun and Augusta Krul, the other two members of the Swords of Leilon, Ogri protected Leilon before its fall. The Spellplague of 1385 DR broke the magical wards of the High Tower of Thalivar and released all of the monsters within, who then and rampaged through the village. The Swords battled to cover the townsfolks escape. They died, becoming bound to Leilons ruins as ghosts.
By the early 1490s DR, great strides had been made to rebuild both Leilon and the High Tower of Thalivar. Ogri and his companions kept a close eye on the towns reconstruction, hoping that the repaired tower would not cause another calamity. The Swords of Leilon helped defend Leilon during the Battle of Leilon, a three-way battle in which Leilon was besieged by both the Cult of Talos and the Cult of Myrkul. Together with a group of adventurers, they fought against the Ebondeath who had possessed the ancient green dragon Claugiyliamatar.
