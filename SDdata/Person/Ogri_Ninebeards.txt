'''Ogri Ninebeards''' was a member of the [[Swords of Leilon]], a group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] based in [[Leilon]], in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. After his death, Ogri's [[ghost]] remained bound to [[Leilon]] until the late 15{{th}} century DR.

==Description==
Ogri was a [[dwarf]] with a red beard.

==Activities==
As a member of the loosely organized Swords of Leilon, Ogri protected Leilon until its fall in [[1385 DR]].

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century DR, Ogri Ninebeards was an adventurer in the region around Leilon. Together with [[Aubrey Silverspun]] and [[Augusta Krul]], the other two members of the Swords of Leilon, Ogri protected Leilon before its fall. The [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]] broke the magical wards of the [[High Tower of Thalivar]] and released all of the monsters within, who then and rampaged through the village. The Swords battled to cover the townsfolk's escape. They died, becoming bound to Leilon's ruins as ghosts.

By the early 1490s DR, great strides had been made to rebuild both Leilon and the High Tower of Thalivar. Ogri and his companions kept a close eye on the town's reconstruction, hoping that the repaired tower would not cause another calamity. The Swords of Leilon helped defend Leilon during the [[Battle of Leilon]], a three-way battle in which Leilon was besieged by both the [[Cult of Talos]] and the [[Cult of Myrkul]]. Together with a group of adventurers, they fought against the [[Chardansearavitriol|Ebondeath]] who had possessed the ancient [[green dragon]] [[Claugiyliamatar]].
