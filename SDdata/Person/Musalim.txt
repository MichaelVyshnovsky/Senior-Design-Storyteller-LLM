'''Musalim''' was one of the [[D'tarig]] people that lived in the desert of [[Anauroch]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Those who attack should take the plunder, not leave it to tempt us. Who razes an entire camp and steals nothing but the camels?|Musalim, on the temptation of scavenging from the dead.}}

==Description==
Like other D'tarig, Musalim was rather diminutive in size, standing about {{SI|4|ft}} tall with a slender build. 

==Personality==
He was rather subservient to others, readily deferring to others and calling them "Lord", despite their protest. 

==Relationships==
Musalim served as the assistant to [[Bhadla]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Musalim and Bhadla served as a guide for the [[Harper]] agent [[Lander]], After a sandstorm separated Lander from the two D'tarig, Musalim went missing, presumably having ridden into an [[asabi]] ambush and been slain by one of the reptilian beasts.
