Musalim was one of the Dtarig people that lived in the desert of Anauroch during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Like other Dtarig, Musalim was rather diminutive in size, standing about  tall with a slender build. 
He was rather subservient to others, readily deferring to others and calling them "Lord", despite their protest. 
Musalim served as the assistant to Bhadla.
In the , Musalim and Bhadla served as a guide for the Harper agent Lander, After a sandstorm separated Lander from the two Dtarig, Musalim went missing, presumably having ridden into an asabi ambush and been slain by one of the reptilian beasts.
