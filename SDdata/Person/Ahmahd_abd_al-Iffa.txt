General Ahmahd abd al-Iffa directed the mamluks of the Honored Mamluk Society in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Ahmahd was a burly eunuch. He grew rather soft after going years without seeing real combat.
Ahmahd was in charge of the security of the Royal Harim of the Grand Caliph. He directed a legion of fanatical eunuchs of the Honored mamluk society. He reported to Preani Qin.
Ahmahd had a weakness for sweets, a fact that many of the Grand Caliphs wives took advantage of if they wanted to sneak men into the harem.
