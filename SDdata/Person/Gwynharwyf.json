        "mainbody": "Demogorgon once allied with Ilsidahur of the barlguras to re-open the portal known as the Shining Vortex of Mesnar from the Abyssal forest of Morathkian to Arborea. Through it, the two demon lords led an army in revenge against the eladrins ancient invasion of the Abyss. Gwynharwyfs armies pushed the fiendish forces back to the Abyss, but in order to seal the portal, she had to sacrifice herself and remained trapped there. Gwynharwyf was taken prisoner, but the two demon lords could not agree on the best way to torture and kill the bralani princess, and Morwel came with a force of her own to free her cherished consort from their grasp. Ilsidahur lost his right hand during the rescue."
