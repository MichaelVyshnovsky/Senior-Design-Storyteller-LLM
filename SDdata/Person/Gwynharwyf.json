        "Description": "Gwynharwyf appeared [[elf]]-like with wild, silver-white hair, tanned skin, and eyes the color of [[jade]]. She was somewhat short and stocky as were most bralani.",
        "Abilities": "Gwynharwyf was a barbarian warrior unrivaled in her ferocity in battle. She never tired, even after exerting herself in a fit of rage, and no one could succeed in flanking her. She had an uncanny ability to dodge dangers before most would even be able to sense them. \n\nAs a bralani eladrin, Gwynharwyf could take the form of a whirlwind of sparkling, stinging sand. She had all the inherent magical powers of her kind, including the ability to see in [[Darkvision|darkness]] and [[Low-light vision|low light]], strong resistance to magic spells, several immunities, and many [[spell]]-like powers. She could only be harmed by the most powerful of mundane weapons, but she could be injured by [[cold iron]] or weapons wielded by truly evil beings. Additionally, Gwynharwyf's beautiful voice had all the powers of [[bard]]ic magic.\n\nShe was at all times surrounded by a magical aura of goodness and light that [[Magic circle against evil|resisted evil]] and [[Lesser globe of invulnerability|protected against weaker magical spells and effects]].\n\nGwynharwyf could magically speak and understand any [[Tongues|tongue]].",

        "Activities": "When not attending to Queen Morwel's needs, Gwynharwyf was found leading armies of champions into battle against [[fiend]]ish forces.\n\nGwynharwyf did not make a permanent abode but could be found wandering the elven realm of [[Arvandor]] or the [[Gates of the Moon]].",
        "Relationships": "Queen Morwel showed great affection for Gwynharwyf and relied heavily on her advice. Gwynharwyf herself was served by a bralani champion named Sirocco, who was charming and mischievous in his behavior but fully loyal to her.\n\nThe [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]] considered Gwynharwyf to be one of his greatest enemies.{{Cite dungeon/149/Enemies of My Enemy|42}} [[Kostchtchie]] hated her so much that when his cult captured women to use as sacrificial victims; they dyed their hair silver, dressed them like Gwynharwyf, and strapped scimitars to their hands before slaughtering them.{{Cite dragon/345/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Kostchtchie: Prince of Wrath|26}}",

Hearing tales of the undying mortal [[Kostchtchie]] and his murderous rages, Gwynharwyf led a great army against him and his tribe but could not defeat them. Fortunately, she discovered the black diamond that stored his hateful soul, inside a series of nested skulls, and crushed it. With that act, his soul returned to his body, and, consumed with rage, he slaughtered his own army until even he was exhausted. Unable to defend himself, Gwynharwyf then stepped in and slew Kostchtchie, sending him to the Abyss.
