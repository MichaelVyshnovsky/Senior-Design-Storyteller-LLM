Vlakverdling was a svirfneblin prisoner of the derro who dwelt in the dwarven mines of Icewind Dale in the midâ€“14 century DR. He may have joined a party of adventurers in their journey to Menzoberranzan.
The deep gnome could be found in the Temple of Dumathoin deep beneath Icewind Dale, which was populated by derro. Vlakverdling was an offering "present" from the drow to the derro to cement their pact. 
A slow-acting poison coursed through the deep gnomes veins, which could be cured only through the use of a fungus grown by the myconids.
