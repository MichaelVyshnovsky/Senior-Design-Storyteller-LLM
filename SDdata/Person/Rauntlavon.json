        "mainbody": "'''Rauntlavon''' was an apprentice [[mage]] to [[Iyriklaunavan]] in the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Rauntlavon was young, and almost certainly a teenager.",
        "Personality": "Feeling attracted to Ladylord [[Nuressa]], he wished he was older, stronger, and better-looking than what he was. As such, he had a certain admiration for his master Iyriklaunavan's elven grace and gruff manner.",
        "Abilities": "His skills at magic were enough to help steady his master's spells.",
        "Relationships": "He studied sorcery under Iyriklaunavan, whom he admired.",
        "History": "During the chaos of [[the Art]] in {{yearlinkName|767}}, Rauntlavon helped his master steady a ''farscrying'' spell; the result was only catastrophic enough to scare the Ladylord [[Nuressa]], one of the four Lords of the Castle, into coming. There was much talk, and Rauntlavon learned that Ladylord Nuressa had been a slave, and that the four Lords of the Castle had found the deed to it once one of them slept in a shrine to [[Mystra]] after gambling away all their coin and trying to steal some of it back. More importantly, he learned that his master had seen [[Azuth]] battling off mages and staring at a ghostly sorceress trying to kill a [[Chosen of Mystra]] who was known to the Four Lords of the Castle, for they'd disturbed the tomb where he'd been held in stasis. He was also made aware that if he blabbed about any of those things he'd need to find a new home. In turn, he told the two Lords that the castle had been built with magic, and would be in danger if the chaos of the Art grew any more dire."
