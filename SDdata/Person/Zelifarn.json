        "Personality": "Zelifarn was very friendly towards strangers, as well as curious and inquisitive. He was eager to add treasure to his hoard, but did not hesitate to offer some of his treasure in exchange for information about his surroundings.",
        "History": "Zelifarn had moved to the harbor in the late 15{{th}} century DR. As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} he spent most of his time searching shipwrecks at the bottom of the harbor in search for treasure. He stashed all his findings in a secret underwater cave.\n\nThe dragon's presence did not go unnoticed by sailors traveling through the harbor. In the interest of keeping the harbor safe, a group of [[Gray Hands]] was dispatched by [[Vajra Safahr]] to learn about Zelifarn's true intentions and make sure that he did not represent a threat to the city."
