Hagarl was a doppelganger who assumed the form of a human boy in order to feast on the inhabitants of Beliard.
Preying on the weak, Hagarl killed horses, dogs, and the weakest travelers journeying through Beliard. He dumped their bodies in a "kill pit," which was located at the north end of Beliards garbage dump. Hagarl would bury the remains under hordes of trash, for later feedings.
Around 1365 DR, Hagarl worked as a stablehand at Halamars Horses and killed at least four spice merchants.
