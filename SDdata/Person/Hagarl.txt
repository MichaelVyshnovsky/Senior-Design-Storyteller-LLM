'''Hagarl''' was a [[doppelganger]] who assumed the form of a [[human]] boy in order to feast on the inhabitants of [[Beliard]].

==Personality==
Preying on the weak, Hagarl killed [[horse]]s, [[dog]]s, and the weakest travelers journeying through Beliard. He dumped their bodies in a "kill pit," which was located at the north end of Beliard's garbage dump. Hagarl would bury the remains under hordes of trash, for later feedings.

==History==
Around [[1365 DR]], Hagarl worked as a stablehand at [[Halamar's Horses]] and killed at least four spice merchants.
