Rannigan was an investigator of the Neverwinter Guard who lived in Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR.
He was an associate of Loravyre Impkith, a tiefling wizard and fellow member of the Neverwinter Guard.
In the , Rannigan recruited tiefling adventurers in the Blacklake District of the city to carry out some missions in opposition to the Ashmadai, such as getting proof of affiliation from disguised cultists. He also wanted to warn the violent Nashers branch of the Sons of Alagondar against the devil-worshipers, as he believed the Ashmadai were a much graver threat to the city. To this end, he had the adventurer put up warning posters.
Some time later, Rannigan traveled east to Helms Hold to continue his investigation against the Ashmadai cult, but remained stuck outside the citys gates during the Siege of Helms Hold. Working alongside Brother Satarin, he discovered that some of the pact blades used by the Ashmadai warlocks were not pacted to the archdevil Asmodeus.
