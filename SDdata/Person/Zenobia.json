        "mainbody": "Zenobia was a dwarf fighter from the world of Oerth who, along with her companions, was sent to Toril after angering an evil mage.\nZenobia had long, braided blonde hair, and a substantial blonde beard. She was clad in chain mail, and wore a voluminous dark red cloak.\nShe owned a pair of gauntlets of ogre power, which magically enhanced her strength, and allowed her to carry twin warhammers in combat.\nAlong with her similarly transported companions, Zenobia worked as an adventurer in the name of goodness. She hoped to grow powerful enough to return home to Oerth."
