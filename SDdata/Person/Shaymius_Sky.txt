'''Shaymius Sky''' was an accomplished adventurer and later swordmaster to the noble [[Thann]] family of [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
Shaymius was mostly blind by [[1361 DR]].

==History==
After Shaymius left his adventuring life, Lady [[Cassandra Thann]] was eager to have Shaymius train her firstborn son so he might achieve the same glories. Unfortunately, Shaymius often went out to get drunk to relive his past adventures. He often brawled, frequently landing himself in a cell. It became too expensive to pay his bail every time.

[[Danilo Thann]], apparently quite fond of him, persuaded his mother to have him run a horse stable and guesthouse outside of the city of Waterdeep. He also convinced Shaymius to to see it as a noble retirement rather than banishment.
