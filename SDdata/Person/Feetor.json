        "mainbody": "Feetor was a malodorous mud mephit who made his home in the Marsh of Chelimber in the late 15 century DR. \nFeetor was fat for a mephit. The mud that he was made of stank awfully, so much so that it would damage those in his immediate vicinity. When he moved suddenly, his body would fling the foul mud around.\nFeetor was unintelligent, but helpful. He was also a coward, and quickly surrendered to the most powerful creature he saw. He was particularly afraid of the water weird that laired in the Marsh of Chelimber.\nFeetor was knowledgeable about the inhabitants of the Marsh, including Mama Manyknuckles and her ogres.\nFeetor was not very good at hiding.\nFeetor was bullied by the ogres that lived in the Marsh of Chelimber, and so he stayed away from them.\nWhen, in the 1480s DR, Raggnar Redtooth sent adventurers to the Marsh of Chelimber to investigate hobgoblins also sent there by Bad Fruul, the adventurers found the hobgoblins had been killed by the water weird that laired there. Feetor appeared to watch from a distance as the adventurers fought the water weird. When they defeated it, he eagerly introduced himself and subserviently gave them information to help them navigate the Marsh."
