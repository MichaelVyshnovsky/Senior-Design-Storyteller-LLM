        "Description": "Nezznar wore a long purple [[cloak]] with a red interior, and wielded a black quarterstaff known as a ''[[spider staff]]''.\n\nHe was quite intelligent and curious, and had knowledge of the arcane arts. The drow did not break into a combat at any given opportunity, but preferred to first study and understand the motives of potential foes. He would, though, betray his enemies after they had exhausted their usefulness. Nezznar was a skilled wizard, and focused on different schools of magic, from [[evocation]] to [[illusion]] to [[abjuration]].\n\nThe ambitious drow had many spies reaching all the way to [[Neverwinter]], as well as several [[giant spider]]s, which acted as guards.",
        "Possessions": "Nezznar owned a ''spider staff'', which was a [[quarterstaff]] that could [[poison]] foes. He also carried a ''[[potion of healing]]'', a key to a cell, several pieces of coin, nine [[gem]]stones, and a slab of [[electrum]] crafted in the shape of a [[mug]] of dwarven [[ale]]. The drow also claimed the dwarven temple to [[Dumathoin]] as his personal quarters during the exploration of Wave Echo Cave.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} the drow promised a share to [[Iarno Albrek]] of the [[Lords' Alliance]] in exchange for his loyalty and aid. Nezznar was the true leader of the [[Redbrands]], controlling them (as well as the [[Cragmaw tribe]] of [[goblinoid]]s) in the hopes of finding Wave Echo Cave and unlocking its secrets (while also keeping it a secret for himself).\n\nAfter finding the mine, Nezznar came across two of the [[Rockseeker]] brothers, [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] and [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]]. He slew Tharden, but kept Nundro as a hostage, as he thought the dwarf knew more than the he was letting on. From then on, he focused on getting to the legendary forge, but was set back by hordes of undead, and rooms full of [[poison]]ous [[fungi]]."
