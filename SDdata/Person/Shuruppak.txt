Lord Shuruppak, or "the Reaper", was the once-Chosen of Gilgeam and the deitys deadly right hand. After Gilgeam was slain, Shuruppak became a wandering murderer, killing many in the name of Unther. 
Shuruppak dressed in black robes and concealed the top half of his face in an infamous red half-mask in the shape of a skull he skillfully wielded a wickedly sharp greatsword.
In Shuruppaks mind, he truly was "the Reaper", a moniker he attained while serving Gilgeam.
Shuruppak wore a unique set of full plate mail that was bestowed upon him by Gilgeam himself.
During Shuruppraks long service to Gilgeam he only failed him once. After being ordered to bring in the Enclave, a powerful cabal of wizards based in the Greenfields, Shuruppak managed to kill several of their members before being driven back.
In the , Shuruppak tried to quell rioting in Messemprar by taking hostages and staging public executions of them.
During the Time of Troubles, in the , Shuruppaks god Gilgeam was slain by Tiamat. With Gilgeams death, Shuruppak was stripped of his Chosen status and lost what remained of his sanity, going rogue.
By the , Shuruppak still wandered throughout Unther slaying all he perceived as enemies of himself or Unther. Both the Church of Tiamat and the Red Wizards of Thay were actively trying to recruit him at this time.
The last sighting of Shuruppak was on Midsummer of the .
