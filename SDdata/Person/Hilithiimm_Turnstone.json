        "mainbody": "Hilithiimm Turnstone was the master of the Cellarers & Plumbers Guild in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.\nHe had the trust of the Lords of Waterdeep, of the City Watch, and of the nobility of Waterdeep. His family was renowned for their discretion about the citys secrets.\nHilithiimm had managed the Plumbers Guild efficiently for many years. Hilithiimm hoped one day to transfer his position to his son Jhalossan Turnstone. However, unknown to anyone, he was mentally enslaved by NexilVendyliq, one of the aboleths of the Savants of the Dark Tide. It permitted Hilithiimm to act normally but had him steer Cellarers away from the aboleth-controlled portions of the sewers and to visit it regularly to renew the enslavement."
