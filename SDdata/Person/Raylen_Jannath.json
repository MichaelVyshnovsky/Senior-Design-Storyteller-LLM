        "mainbody": "Lord '''Raylen Jannath''' was a member of the [[Parliament of Peers]] from the noble [[patriar]] [[Jannath (family)|Jannath]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|Baldur's Gate was due for a shake-up.|Lord Raylen Jannath}}",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lord Raylen Jannath was already a member of the Parliament of Peers. When the [[Absolute crisis]] arrived to the Gate, Raylen was noted by the [[Cult of Bane]] as one of the eight top patriars of the Parliament, vulnerable to bribery, blackmail, or direct threats. Raylen Jannath was a prime target for the cult's extortion thanks to the Jannath family's profitable mining operations. The Banites planned on exposing Lord Jannath's affair with a \"rent [[goblin]]\" in the [[Little Calimshan]] neighborhood of the Gate. The plan included a rumormongering publication of ''[[Baldur's Mouth]]'' from under [[Ettvard Needle]] pen that would include details of the affair that would be meaningful to the patriar, following by an anonymous note left in his bedroom.\n\nShortly before the armies of the the Absolute attacked the Gate, Lord Raylen Jannath voted in support of crowning lowborn Lord [[Enver Gortash]] as the city's Archduke. Raylen was present for Gortash's coronation that took place in the audience hall of [[Wyrm's Rock]]. Following the coronation, he proudly proclaimed his support for Gortash' accession, stating the new Archduke was a strong leader and the Gate needed a political shake-up. In a conversation with Lord [[Myer Ravenshade]], Raylen voiced his approval of the [[steel watcher]]s as they provided protection for the trade routes of the Gante and not the Baldurians."
