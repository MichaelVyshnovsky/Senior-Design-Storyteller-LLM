'''Shuushar the Awakaned''' was a [[kuo-toa]] hermit and mystic who was captured by the [[drow]] during the late 1480s [[DR]].

==Personality==
Shuushar was a calm and peaceful presence. Despite his people's propensity for madness, his years of seclusion and meditation had, in his words, cleared him of that legacy. He was also a complete pacifist. He didn't fight or cause harm to any other creature, even refusing to defend himself or others.

==History==
Shuushar was a monk who hailed from [[Sloobludop]] but wandered the [[Underdark]] for many years in order to fulfill his training. 

During the late 1480s DR, Shuushar had attained enlightenment and decided to return to Sloobludop to teach his fellows, but was instead captured by [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]].
