        "mainbody": "orthel August was a bard who was known for offering significant sums of gold to adventurers and crafting songs about their exploits during the midâ€“14 century DR. He refused to travel and experience the world on his own, owing to the inherent danger that could be encountered on the road.\nForthel became a bard for the easy nature of the work and the inherent impressiveness and prestige that accompanied the profession, particularly among the wealthy and Upper City women of Baldurs Gate.\nIn the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, Forthel encountered Gorions Ward and their party. He offered them 200 gp for a story, about which he could write a song to woo the women he so desperately sought."
