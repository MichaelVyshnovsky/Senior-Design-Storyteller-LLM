        "Activities": "While retired, he became a regular at [[The Goose of Doom]], a tavern.",
        "History": "After the massacre at the [[Council of the Dragon]] in late [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Brorn Roril ran into The Goose of Doom to proclaim the Obarskyrs dead, and civil war as having begun. As the Obarskyrs were alive, he was mistaken in so doing.There is no reason given for this behavior on his part; it can be assumed, however, that [[Manshoon]], trying to create a civil war at the time, either misinformed or controlled him."
