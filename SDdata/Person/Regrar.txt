'''Regrar''' was a [[Purple Dragon Knight]] in [[Azoun IV]]'s personal retinue during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
In Azoun's personal retinue, he served with others including [[Daervin]] and [[Forold]].

==History==
Regrar was leading the effort to dig a grave for [[Daervin]] in a gorge near [[Eveningstar]] during King Azoun IV's visit to [[Tessaril Winter]], after Highknight Daervin was slain by a [[malaugrym]]. While digging, he extensively discussed the subject of Tessaril's exact relationship to the king, explaining to his fellow Highknights that Lord Tessaril was close personally with Azoun, and that he was certain of her loyalty. He later spotted that he was being [[scrying|scried]] on by [[Hlael Toraunt]] and [[Korthauvar Hammantle]], and warned his fellow knights to fetch a War Wizard.
