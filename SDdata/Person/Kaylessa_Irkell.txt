Kaylessa Irkell was the owner of the Swinging Sword tavern in Red Larch during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Kaylessa was the fortyish matriarch of her family and a pleasant, sturdy woman. She was increasingly worried about strange phenomena in Red Larch and brought up her concerns with any likely adventurers who stopped by.
Kaylessa managed the Swinging Sword tavern.
In 1491 DR, Kaylessa told some adventurers hired to find a diplomatic caravan missing near the city her suspicions about something dark in the village.
