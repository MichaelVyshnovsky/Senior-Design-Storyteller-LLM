Over the next decade, they claimed to have killed more than twenty vampires in the North. Unfortunately, fighting such creatures took its toll on the group and by 1371 DR Corinna and Jandar were the only two members who remained alive.\nThe two returned to Waterdeep and joined the Order of the Aster, where Corinna listened for rumors of vampires in the area and gave advice to adventurers who expected to fight such in the near future."
