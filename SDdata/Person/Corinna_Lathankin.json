        "mainbody": "'''Corinna Lathankin''' was a [[half-elf|half–]][[moon elf]] vampire-slayer in the [[Order of the Aster]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Corinna was short and skinny with a soft face that easily concealed the fact that she was a powerful spellcaster.",
        "Personality": "Corinna was an intense woman with a lot of energy and a loud, commanding voice.",
        "History": "Born the illegitimate daughter of [[Bhaedulph Gost]], he abandoned her at the door of the [[Spires of the Morning]] temple. From an early age, she showed strong piety toward [[Lathander]] and an almost equally strong hatred of [[vampire]]s.\n\nShe became an apprentice in [[Magic#Arcane magic|arcane magic]] to [[Olanhar Wands]] and later discovered the truth of her parentage. Her father dead, she reconnected with her half-brother [[Djarrus Gost]] and married a fellow moon elf [[wizard]] named [[Jandar Ilbaereth]].\n\nFueled by Corinna's fervor and financed by her brother Djarrus, Corinna and Jandar formed the [[Foes of the Fang]] adventuring company in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}. Over the next decade, they claimed to have killed more than twenty [[vampires]] in the [[North]]. Unfortunately, fighting such creatures took its toll on the group and by [[1371 DR]] Corinna and Jandar were the only two members who remained alive.\n\nThe two returned to Waterdeep and joined the Order of the Aster, where Corinna listened for rumors of vampires in the area and gave advice to adventurers who expected to fight such in the near future."
