Dell Tannerson was a nephew of Rafferty Tannerson. Together, they regularly braved the elements traveling with caravans between Luskan and the Ten Towns in the late 1360s DR.
Dell was a tall, brown-haired teenager.
Dell was a very open, trusting, and outgoing kid, to the annoyance of others. He was bursting with friendliness and curiosity, often bombarding adventurers with questions without letting them insert a word into the conversation. Dell loved hearing stories told by the adventurers and caravaneers he believed and loved every tall tale he heard, however exaggerated they mightve been.
The boys uncle was teaching Dell everything he needed to know about being a teamster for the caravans traveling between Luskan and the Ten Towns.
Dell and Rafferty showed affection towards each other, even though the gruff uncle hoped to keep Dells mind on his training, and not getting "all mixed up with dragons and fairies".
In 1369 DR, Dell traveled with his uncle in a caravan from Luskan to Targos, hired by Boswell Peddywinkle (secretly Celerum the Black, a member of the Arcane Brotherhood). Together with the disguised mage and his hired group of adventurers, they came across a destroyed and plundered caravan, discovered by Dell, which led to an encounter with a goblin marauder tribe.
After the group reached the Ten Towns, Dell asked the adventurers to join them on their search for the mysterious Accursed Tower, unbeknownst to his uncle.
