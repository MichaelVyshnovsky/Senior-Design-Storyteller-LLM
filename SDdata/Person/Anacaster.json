        "mainbody": "Anacaster was a skilled wizard inhabiting Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, centuries before the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nAnacaster was famous for his use of magical gates placed within Waterdeep, specifically within the City of the Dead. One such gate found within the Mariners Rest tomb led to a plane with an infinite number of burial plots that sat next to a placid lake. He left similar gates within the Hall of Heroes, Merchants Rest, and the House of the Homeless."
