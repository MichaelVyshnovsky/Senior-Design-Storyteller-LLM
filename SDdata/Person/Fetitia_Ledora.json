        "mainbody": "etitia Ledora was a half-elven incantatrix who founded the Sorority of the Silver Fire, alongside Yhelfanna the Masked, in her quest for revenge against the Cult of the Dragon.  \nAt some point circa 975 DR, a terrifying dracolich threatened the destruction of Fetitias home, the city of Everlund. This urged the woman to locate the origin of such an abomination, an adventure that took her all the way to Sembia, far to the southeast, where the Cult of the Dragon hid its temples.\nBefore she could fully put her plan into action, however, Fetitia found that she was not the only woman the Followers of the Scaly Way had upset already, they were embroiled in a tense combat against Yhelfanna the Masked, a capable witch of Rashemen. Moving quickly to join her, the two became fast friends and, through their combined might, managed not only to foil a cell of Cultists but also end a pair of dracoliches that the Cult had hurriedly brought forth. Ultimately, the two women even destroyed a copy of the Tome of the Dragon that the Cult had been keeping there.\nFrom there, in the , Fetitia and Yhelfanna decided to maintain their joint efforts. This union would go on to be known as the Sorority of the Silver Fire, a group that, like their founders, dedicated itself to the pursuit and elimination of Sammasters corruptive Tome and his terrible dracoliches.\nCertain rumors spoke of Fetitias parentage as being none other than Alustriel Silverhand."
