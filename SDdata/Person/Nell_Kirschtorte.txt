Nell Kirschtorte was a kindly baker who ran her pastry business - Nells Pie Shop, out of her home in Liams Hold circa 1372 DR.
Nell was a pleasant and plump middle-aged woman with chestnut hair, always covered in flour. She preferred to wear light blue robes when running her business.
Nell was not rich and could not afford to rent a space so she spent long hours baking and selling her goods from her humble home. She baked bread but her specialty were cherry pies, filled to the brim with elderflower wine drenched red and black cherries, fruit-stuffed eccles cakes, and toffee apples.
In 1372 DR, Nell lived with her young daughter Jemmy Kirschtorte and her pet bat Mr. Barnabus. That year, Nells daughter became besieged by bad dreams. And after investigation by the Hero of Daggerford it was revealed the family was stalked by a drow vampire Sieronius Dethick. The girls nightmares came from the vampire searching for a bride to escape his trapping curse underneath Liams Hold. When the vampire realized Jemmy was a child, he turned his eyes on Nell Kirschtorte. Thankfully, Jemmy was an emerging sorceress and could talk to her bat pet. Mr. Barnabus felt the coming of the creature of the night and woke Jemmy up. When Sieronius arrived to Nells Pie Shop in his mist form, he realized that the family was not asleep and left them alone, turning his attention to Xanda Pennywell, a seamstress from the same hamlet.
Following the resolution of the vampire situation, Nell Kirschtorte became aware of her daughters sorcerous talents but was unsure how to deal with it.
