Chief '''Fedduk''' was the [[hill giant]] leader of the [[Skullgnasher]] tribe in southern [[Amn]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Fedduk was quite clever for a hill giant, and was about as smart as the typical [[human]]. He used this genius to organize and direct his forces reasonably effectively in his protracted war in the [[Tejarn Hills]].

==Possessions==
The chief had a special suit of giant-sized [[plate armor]] that was made by captured [[dwarf]] blacksmiths.

==History==
Fedduk began working with the [[ogre magi]] [[Sothillis]] and [[Cyrvisnea]] in the 1350s DR as part of their plan to conquer southern Amn, and unified three different tribes in the [[Small Teeth]] into the federated tribe of the Skullgnashers. Around [[1356 DR]] they suddenly began attacking [[Hillfort Torbold]] and menacing the surrounding region, while using the eastern Small Teeth as their secure base of operations. Counterattacks by the [[Council Army]] were largely ineffective, as Fedduk and his giants were far more familiar with the hills and mountains and had many hidden caves and hideouts to use.

The situation reversed when Major [[Tharundar Olehm (soldier)|Tharundar Olehm]] won the command of Torbold in [[1358 DR]] and set about training and commanding the garrison. With his expertise, the Amnian forces managed to gradually outmatch Fedduk's efforts, and by [[1370 DR]] the giants were pushed back into the Small Teeth. While Torbold had been concerned with the endless skirmishes with the giants, Sothillis' army had been built up and the [[Sothillisian War]] erupted, with the Skullgnashers leading the first attack on [[Hillfort Ishla]] and then to Esmeltaran.
