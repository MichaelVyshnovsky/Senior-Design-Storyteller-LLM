        "mainbody": "'''Raerboth''' was the 33rd [[Obarskyr]] monarch and a king of [[Cormyr]]. He was the only legitimate son of King [[Ulbaeram Obarskyr|King Ulbaeram]]. Like so many of his kin, he was killed by his aunt [[Gorauna]]. His son, [[Baerildo Obarskyr|Baerildo]] was next in line for the throne, but Baerildo was also killed by Gorauna while still an infant, and so Raerboth's half brother [[Belmuth Obarskyr|Belmuth \"the Bastard\"]] next took the throne."
