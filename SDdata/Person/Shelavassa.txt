Shelavassa was a very pragmatic individual, willing to give up whatever she needed to in order to avoid bigger troubles.
Shelavassa led a cell of the Cult of the Crushing Wave in Moonsea, with Karsev as her right-hand.
Around 1491 DR, she discovered an elemental node at the ruined Fort Dalton and planned to create a devastation orb to unleash over Mulmaster. In order to complete the ritual, she ordered her minions to capture the aquatic elf prince Ulatha Mesavir in order to use him as a sacrifice. However, Shelavassa was confronted and defeated by an adventuring party hired to destroy the cultist group for their bandit activities near River Lis.
