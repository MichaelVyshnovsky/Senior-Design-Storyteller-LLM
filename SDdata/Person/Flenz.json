        "mainbody": "Flenz was a half-orc worshiper of Talos and a member of the anchorites of Talos in the late 15 century DR. Along with fellow anchorites Narux and Yargath, Flenz was responsible for overseeing rituals dedicated to Talos, god of storms, at the Circle of Thunder in southern Neverwinter Wood.\nAs an anchorite of Talos, Flenz was a shapechanger who could adopt the form of a boar, and was blessed by his god with powerful spells, including the ability to cast lightning bolt.\nFlenz lived in a modest cave beneath the Circle of Thunder. The entrance faced the northwest, and was marked by a crude carving of a stick figure being pursued by a boar. His only possession of value was a potion of invulnerability, which he kept buried in his cave.\nFlenz and his fellow anchorites conducted rituals at the Circle of Thunder in order to invoke Talos, to create storms, and to summon Gorthok, a primal spirit known as the \"Thunder Boar.\" These rituals often entailed blood sacrifices of animals or humanoids, followed by dancing around the victims corpse. During these dances, Flenz would wear a rotted boars head as a mask."
