        "mainbody": "'''Flenz''' was a [[half-orc]] worshiper of [[Talos]] and a member of the [[anchorites of Talos]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Along with fellow anchorites [[Narux]] and [[Yargath]], Flenz was responsible for overseeing rituals dedicated to [[Talos]], god of storms, at the [[Circle of Thunder]] in southern [[Neverwinter Wood]].",
        "Abilities": "As an anchorite of Talos, Flenz was a [[shapechanger]] who could adopt the form of a [[boar]], and was blessed by his god with powerful [[spell]]s, including the ability to cast ''[[lightning bolt]]''.",
        "Possessions": "Flenz lived in a modest cave beneath the Circle of Thunder. The entrance faced the northwest, and was marked by a crude carving of a stick figure being pursued by a boar. His only possession of value was a ''[[potion of invulnerability]]'', which he kept buried in his cave.",
        "Activities": "Flenz and his fellow anchorites conducted rituals at the Circle of Thunder in order to invoke Talos, to create storms, and to summon [[Gorthok]], a [[primal spirit]] known as the \"Thunder Boar.\" These rituals often entailed blood sacrifices of [[animal]]s or [[humanoid]]s, followed by dancing around the victim's corpse. During these dances, Flenz would wear a rotted boar's head as a mask."
