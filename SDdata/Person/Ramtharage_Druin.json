        "mainbody": "'''Ramtharage Druin''' was a priest of [[Eldath]] in the [[Misty Forest]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "On [[Kythorn 19]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, just after the start of the [[Time of Troubles]], Ramtharage imprisoned a trio of [[ranger]]s of [[Mielikki]], accusing them of desecrating the shrine to Eldath, [[Eldath's Water]], which had been destroyed the night before. However, [[Elminster]] arrived to intercede for the rangers. Ramtharage did not listen to their reasons, so Elminster apparently called the [[avatar]]s of both Eldath and Mielikki to his side. They declared they were sisters and friends. Ramthar was utterly shocked by meeting the two goddesses and released the rangers."
