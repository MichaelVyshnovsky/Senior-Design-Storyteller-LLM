        "mainbody": "Ramtharage Druin was a priest of Eldath in the Misty Forest in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nOn Kythorn 19 in the , just after the start of the Time of Troubles, Ramtharage imprisoned a trio of rangers of Mielikki, accusing them of desecrating the shrine to Eldath, Eldaths Water, which had been destroyed the night before. However, Elminster arrived to intercede for the rangers. Ramtharage did not listen to their reasons, so Elminster apparently called the avatars of both Eldath and Mielikki to his side. They declared they were sisters and friends. Ramthar was utterly shocked by meeting the two goddesses and released the rangers."
