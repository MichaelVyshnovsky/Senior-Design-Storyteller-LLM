'''Reldra Wyntersar''' was a socialite in [[Waterdeep]] in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was scorned by three noble lovers, whom she later attempted to murder.

==History==
Reldra was an up-and-coming young socialite. She was a beauty to look upon, and quite popular. Over time, she was taken as a lover by three noblemen, [[Neldror Artemel]], [[Larondras Brokengulf]], and [[Elglor Eagleshield]]. All three men promised her marriage and the wealth and prestige that would go with such a union. All three men reneged on their promise, and violently threw her out of their homes, telling the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] that she was a thief, which effectively cast her out of high society.

Decades later, in the summer of [[1271 DR]], Reldra managed to get hired as a servant at the [[Artemel Villa]]. All three of her former paramours were at the villa, and Reldra saw her chance at revenge. She slipped a paralytic agent into their drinks, then, after informing them of who she was and reminding them of what they'd done to her, she tipped their chairs over the edge of an upstairs gallery, killing Elglor and Neldror, and permanently maiming Larondras. She managed to kill several servants and guards, yelling "Marry me!" over and over again, before she was eventually slain.

===Legacy===
Waterdeep's nobility tried and failed to keep the incident a secret. It became the city's hottest topic of gossip for the following week.

Over two hundred years later, the phrase "Marry me!" was still uttered by Waterdhavian nobility as a warning of what could happen if they mistreated those of lesser station.
