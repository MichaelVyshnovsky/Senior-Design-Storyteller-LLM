        "mainbody": "Aptem Mews was a human Cormyrean Wizard of War during the mid-1480s DR.\nAptem had tanned skin and short white hair.\nDuring the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, Aptem was deployed to Eveningstar to aid the war effort there. One of his duties was interviewing the elven ex-slave Mirini Elemys, who had broken free on her own accord and reached Eveningstar. Aptem learned a great deal about the inner workings of the drow from her, especially that of House Avithoul, the premier slavers of Sschindylryn. Together, they created a plan to raid and sabotage Avithoul with a slave revolt, using Aptems illusion magic to sneak Cormyrean agents in disguised as slaves."
