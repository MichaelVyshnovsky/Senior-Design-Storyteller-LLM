One of his duties was interviewing the [[elf|elven]] ex-slave [[Mirini Elemys]], who had broken free on her own accord and reached Eveningstar. Aptem learned a great deal about the inner workings of the drow from her, especially that of [[House Avithoul]], the premier slavers of Sschindylryn. Together, they created a plan to raid and sabotage Avithoul with a slave revolt, using Aptem's [[illusion]] magic to sneak Cormyrean agents in disguised as slaves."
