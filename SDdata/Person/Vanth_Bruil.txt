Vanth Bruil was the Lord of House Bruil and one of the seven councilors that ruled Melvaunt in 1374 DR.
At one point, he nominated as heir his bastard grandson Argens Bruil instead of his oldest son Halmuth Bruil, Lord of Keys.
In 1374 DR, Vanths heir Argens Bruil went on adventures with some friends and disappeared. Lord Bruil agreed to speak with the adventuring party hired by Lord Woarsten Nanther to find the boys.
Vanth had a very bad relationship with his son Halmuth and they hated each other.
