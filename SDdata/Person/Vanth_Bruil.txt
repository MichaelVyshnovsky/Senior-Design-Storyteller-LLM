'''Vanth Bruil''' was the Lord of [[House Bruil]] and one of the seven councilors that ruled [[Melvaunt]] in [[1374 DR]].

==History==
At one point, he nominated as heir his bastard grandson [[Argens Bruil]] instead of his oldest son [[Halmuth Bruil]], Lord of Keys.

In 1374 DR, Vanth's heir [[Argens Bruil]] went on adventures with some friends and disappeared. Lord Bruil agreed to speak with the adventuring party hired by Lord [[Woarsten Nanther]] to find the boys.

==Relationship==
Vanth had a very bad relationship with his son Halmuth and they hated each other.
