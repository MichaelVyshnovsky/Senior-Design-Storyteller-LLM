'''Lashan Aumersair''' was the ruler of [[Scardale]] until he attempted a war of conquest in the [[1356 DR|Year of the Worm, 1356 DR]], to unite the [[Dalelands]] under his rule.

==History==
A direct descendant of [[Elminster]] (the Aumersair name was a corruption of "Aumar's heir"), Lashan was descended from a long line of [[Purple Dragons]] and [[Harpers]].<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2014)/Aumersair}}
After his defeat in 1356, he ventured into the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] where he fell in battle against the [[lich]] [[Azimer]]{{Cite dragon/95/Into the Forgotten Realms}}, who transformed him into a [[Larva]] and imprisoned him beneath the earth.
Sometime later, a [[night hag]] in service of [[Shar]] freed him, and when the Sharran decided to conquer [[Shadowdale]] in the [[1375 DR|Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR]], Shar elevated Lashan to a [[nycaloth]] to use him in the conquest.
