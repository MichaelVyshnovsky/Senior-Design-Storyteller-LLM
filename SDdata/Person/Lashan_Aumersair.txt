Lashan Aumersair was the ruler of Scardale until he attempted a war of conquest in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR, to unite the Dalelands under his rule.
A direct descendant of Elminster (the Aumersair name was a corruption of "Aumars heir"), Lashan was descended from a long line of Purple Dragons and Harpers.
After his defeat in 1356, he ventured into the ruins of Myth Drannor where he fell in battle against the lich Azimer, who transformed him into a Larva and imprisoned him beneath the earth.
Sometime later, a night hag in service of Shar freed him, and when the Sharran decided to conquer Shadowdale in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR, Shar elevated Lashan to a nycaloth to use him in the conquest.
