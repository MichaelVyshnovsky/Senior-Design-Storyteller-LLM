Felbris was a beholder who made his home in Gauntlgrym on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR.
Felbris had dark brown skin. Its central eye had a green sclera, blue iris, and black pupil. The eyestalks had white scleras, blue irises, and black pupils.
Felbris invaded Gauntlgrym in the late 15 century DR and took control of it from the dwarves living there. Some time later, Felbris fell asleep. While having nightmares, its reality-warping powers manifested and with its nightmares it began to unravel Gauntlygrym.
After invading Gauntlgrym, four adventurers ventured into Gauntlgrym to kill the sleeping beholder. It awoke and a fight ensued, likely leading to the beholders death.
