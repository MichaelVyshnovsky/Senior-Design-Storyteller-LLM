'''Faren Starlight''' was a [[Zhentarim]] [[enchanter]] who was the "keeper" of the [[black dragon]] [[Harondalbar]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Faren was a very attractive woman of average height. She had long black hair and emerald green eyes. Her skin was pale to the point of giving her a near ethereal appearance.

==Activities==
Faren excelled at her role since Harondalbar was somewhat fascinated with her. Given the dragon's often stubborn nature and refusal to rouse to confront any non-Zhentarim caravans moving through [[Yellow Snake Pass]], Faren often resorted to creating her own [[illusion]]s of Harondalbar to warn off unwanted traffic.

==Possessions==
Faren carried a ''[[staff of power]]'', ''[[bracers of defense]]'', a ''[[brooch of shielding]]'', and a pair of ''[[winged boots]]''.

==Abilities==
She usually had the following [[spell]]s memorized – ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[shocking grasp]]'', ''[[spider climb]]'', ''[[phantasmal force]]'', ''[[alter self]]'', ''[[bind]]'', ''[[deafness]]'', ''[[fog cloud]]'', ''[[insatiable thirst]]'', ''[[summon swarm]]'', ''[[Melf's acid arrow]]'', ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter]]'', ''[[explosive runes]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[spectral force]]'', and ''[[suggestion]]''.

==Relationships==
Faren was an apprentice of both [[Manshoon]] and [[Sememmon]].
