'''Adrielle''' was a devoted [[cleric]] of [[Helm]] and a member of the [[Anti-Hag Support Group]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''An intruder? These people are under my protection, I'll not let you harm them! Hearken to my words, wicked creature. Return to the pit of evil from whence you came!''|Adrielle}}

==Description==
Adrielle was a young [[human]] woman with light skin, light brown eyes, and light brown hair. She wore a [[splint mail]] adorned with a [[paladin]]'s tabard.

==Possessions==
She owned a ''[[fey semblance amulet]]''. Adrielle also kept a diary written in elegant script, with each page decorated by a hand-drawn [[gauntlet]] with a watchful eye in its center.

==Abilities==
As a cleric of Helm, Adrielle could cast [[spell]]s from the [[war domain]]. She could channel the divinity of her faith to land guided strikes that were hard to miss their mark and receive the ''war god's blessing'' that guided her allies' attacks toward their targets. She was trained in wielding a [[mace]] and a [[shield]] and was a tenacious fighter.

==History==
At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Adrielle encountered an [[annis]]. That fateful meeting left her broken, desperate, a coward, and a drunkard. When Adrielle came to Baldur's Gate, she thought herself not worthy of Helm's favor. Eventually, however, the cleric met other victims of [[hag]]s, including [[Jatlo]], [[Kled]], and, possibly, were they to survive their encounters with [[Auntie Ethel]], [[Hydrangea Wubb]], [[Mayrina]], and her [[zombified]] husband [[Connor Vinderblad]]. This group, which later became known as the Anti-Hag Support Group, helped Adrielle remember the tenets of her fate, take on the priest's mantle again, and saved her life. In return, she became the group's protector and healer.

Soon after, the [[green hag]] Auntie Ethel discovered the group that worked actively to find a way to thwart evil hag schemes and save girls consumed by the creatures. It was revealed, to Adrielle's shock, that Jatlo was not a [[dragonborn]] survivor but a shapeshifted [[red cap]] servant of the green hag. Secretly, Jatlo had smuggled an ''[[effigy]]'' into the Anti-Hag Support Group's hideout, old [[Garlow]]'s home in the [[Lower City]]. That ''effigy'' affected Mayrina, turning her into a [[sheep]]. Adrielle swore to protect the group and her friends and thought this betrayal was a great failure. She decided that if harm came to Mayrina and she would perish, Adrielle would soon follow her friend into the afterlife.
