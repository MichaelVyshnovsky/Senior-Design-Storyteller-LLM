Kangaxx was a powerful demilich residing in Athkatla.
Kangaxx was an intensely evil man even prior to undeath.
A group of Netheril mages defeated Kangaxx at some point after he became a demilich. Unable to fully destroy him, they were forced to become liches themselves in order to imprison him.
In 1369 DR, Gorions Ward encountered the imprisoned demilich, who tricked the Ward into freeing him. In the ensuing battle, Gorions Ward emerged as the victor.
