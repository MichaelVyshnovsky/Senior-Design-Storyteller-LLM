Amratha Shuldeiroun was the senior chatelaine of the Sign of the Shield inn located in Voonlar circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
__NOTOC__
Amratha was a petite woman with beautiful, angular features and red hair.
Amratha swirled about the inn seeing that all the guests needs were met or even anticipated. She had a no-nonsense attitude and a sharp tongue but did not stoop to using vulgarities rather, she cajoled with wit or sarcasm as the situation warranted.
At some point in her life she received basic training as a fighter.
As the senior chatelaine, she ruled the day shift, talking to the guests and directing the staff on how best to serve them.
She was essentially second in command after Mester Rauvaraudo, the majordomo of the Sign of the Shield. She and her night-shift counterpart, Maeragra Duskwinter, were similar in hair color, stature, appearance, and demeanor, but were unrelated.
