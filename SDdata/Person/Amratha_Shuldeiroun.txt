'''Amratha Shuldeiroun''' was the senior chatelaine of the [[Sign of the Shield]] inn located in [[Voonlar]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].
__NOTOC__
==Description==
Amratha was a petite woman with beautiful, angular features and red hair.

==Personality==
Amratha swirled about the inn seeing that all the guests' needs were met or even anticipated. She had a no-nonsense attitude and a sharp tongue but did not stoop to using vulgarities; rather, she cajoled with wit or sarcasm as the situation warranted.

| text    = Her wit is like a whip, and her sarcasm can etch glass and blister up blushes.
}}

==Abilities==
At some point in her life she received basic training as a fighter.

==Activities==
As the senior chatelaine, she ruled the day shift, talking to the guests and directing the staff on how best to serve them.

==Relationships==
She was essentially second in command after [[Mester Rauvaraudo]], the majordomo of the Sign of the Shield. She and her night-shift counterpart, [[Maeragra Duskwinter]], were similar in hair color, stature, appearance, and demeanor, but were unrelated.
