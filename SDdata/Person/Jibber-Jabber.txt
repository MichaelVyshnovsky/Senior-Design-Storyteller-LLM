Jibber-Jabber was an ettin in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Jibber-Jabber resided in a cave in the Twisted Caverns. He had a comfortable home and all the food he needed.
In 1492 DR, Jibber-Jabber noticed the arrival of the drow of House Auvryndar nearby and the strange movements of nearby kuo-toa and troglodytes.
Jibber-Jabber was an unusual ettin in that both of his heads got along well, probably thanks to his good living conditions.
Jibber-Jabber was friends with the Alchemist, who provided the ettin with a potion that made mead out of barrelstalk mushrooms.
