'''Jibber-Jabber''' was an [[ettin]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Activities==
Jibber-Jabber resided in a cave in the [[Twisted Caverns]]. He had a comfortable home and all the food he needed.

==History==
In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Jibber-Jabber noticed the arrival of the [[drow]] of [[House Auvryndar]] nearby and the strange movements of nearby [[kuo-toa]] and [[troglodyte]]s.

==Personality==
Jibber-Jabber was an unusual ettin in that both of his heads got along well, probably thanks to his good living conditions.

==Relationship==
Jibber-Jabber was friends with [[the Alchemist]], who provided the ettin with a potion that made mead out of [[Barrelstalk|barrelstalk mushrooms]].
