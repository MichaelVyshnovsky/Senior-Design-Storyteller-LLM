Kixitiloc was an adventurer in Maztica.
Kixitiloc lived in a small Payit village that was destroyed during a battle against another village. Kixitiloc was taken as a slave.
In 1361 DR, he arrived in Ulatos the same day as Cordells forces arrived. He soon became a slave of the Golden Legion. Being a troublemaker, however, he was sold many times until he arrived in Lord Drakosas plantation. He hoped to improve himself to attain a better life.
Kixitiloc was a taciturn man with a bad temperament. He desperately wanted to be free but at heart he dreamed of becoming a master with his own land and slaves.
