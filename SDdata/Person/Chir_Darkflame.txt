Chir Darkflame was an upbeat svirfneblin wizard from Underdark, active in Samarach in the late-14 sentry DR.
Chir was a hyper, cheerful, and easily excitable wizard who worshiped Beshaba, the Lady of Misfortune. Her upbeat outlook, and unnerving glee were not shaken even when captured by illithid slavers in Samarach. Her glee was likely fueled by misfortune of others.
Among more exotic possessions, Chir Darkflame wore a set of enchanted robes that could create magical darkness, and magic ring that expanded her mind allowing for additional spells to be memorized every day.
In the , Chir Darkflame was ambushed by a group of deep gnome law enforcement attempting to arrest her for unlawfully and inhumanly experimenting on sylphs. During the arrest, the entire group was captured by mind flayer slavers who ran a black market in the mountains east of the city of Samargol. Despite being kept there as a slave and source of delicious brains, Chir seemed to not be phased by the misfortune, yet she was eager to join a group of adventurers were they ever to release the captured deep gnomes.
