'''Roldro Tattershar''' was a [[bard]] and [[Harper]] operating in [[Suzail]] and [[Marsember]] in [[Cormyr]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Roldro wore gray, dusty, and faded leathers during undercover stints, and he had a "villainous" fake mustache to go with it. Normally, he was dressed in flamboyantly florid tones.

==Relationships==
He had been a guest of Lady [[Joysil Ambrur]]. They were close enough that he called her by a different name, "Ammaratha", and knew enough to give her room when he believed she'd transform into a dragon.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, Roldro Tattershar was drinking at [[the Green Wyvern]] in Suzail when two men teleported in front of him. Those men, the [[Red Wizard]] [[Harnrim Starangh]] and [[War Wizard]] [[Huldyl Rauthur]], discussed briefly the plans of [[Vangerdahast]], the then-retired [[Royal Mage]] of Cormyr, to bind [[dragon]]s to service. They teleported away shortly after; as they planned, Roldro overheard them and immediately used a ''[[portal]]'' hidden in the tavern to head over to Marsember and share this information with Lady Joysil Ambrur, with the nefarious intent of "stirring the cauldron".

Once at the residence of the lady, he was stopped, first by the guard [[Melarvyn]], and then by the steward, [[Elward]]. Both refused him entry; removing his mustache, he threatened Elward to tell the watch about a certain Elward of [[Westgate]]. The man relented; when Roldro finally was face-to-face with Lady Joysil, she instructed Elward to move as far back as the southern pond. Roldro knew her by the name of Ammaratha; he gave her space, taking several steps back, as he revealed to her that he'd overheard two [[War Wizards]] of Cormyr revealing that Vangerdahast was binding dragons. This turned out to be the right move, as she immediately turned into her natural form as a [[song dragon]] and flew straight through the ceiling.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|298-303|18}}

He took a chest of jewels as a down-payment, and departed through a secret passage, anticipating the steward would be furious.
