'''Rabgar''' was a [[sage]] who wandered the forests and plains of [[Faer√ªn]] ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].

==Description==
The sage wore white rags that matched his unkempt hair and beard, and had a green pouch containing [[herb]]s around his neck. The old man hobbled as he walked, and had a raspy voice.

==History==
In 1358 DR, he came across the [[Heroes of Ascore]], and was able to discern their situation. Rabgar told them about the [[evil]] forces they would have to face in the near future, and bolstered their resolve. He advised them to seek out three dungeons, and speak to the [[dwarves]] of the land, which would lead to great strength and secrets.
