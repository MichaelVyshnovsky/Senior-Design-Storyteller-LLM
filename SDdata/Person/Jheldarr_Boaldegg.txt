'''Jheldarr "Stormrunner" Boaldegg''' was an old sea dog and the First Mariner of the [[Master Mariners' Guild]] in [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' [[1377 DR]].

==Description==
The old seaman had a fleecy white and shaggy beard and eyebrows that covered his red and scarred face. He often carried around a battered tobacco pipe.

==Personality==
Jheldarr was stern and weathered. He was not above murder and committing crimes if they were beneficial to the guild's success. He and his guild had a bad reputation among other businessmen of Waterdeep.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{DDTS}}, "Stormrunner" attended the wedding of the Open Lord of Waterdeep [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] and [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]]. The wedding was to take away from [[Master Mariners' Guild]]'s business via a trade agreement between Waterdeep the [[Boareskyr]] family. The Mariners led by Jheldarr plotted to disrupt the event; the guild members set a crossbow trap to fire at the husband and wife during the ceremony. The plan was foiled by a young noble [[Kastonoph Nesher]], one of the Mariners named [[Terrance Decamber]] was killed, and one female conspirator was apprehended, but "Stormrunner" himself avoided personal involvement.
