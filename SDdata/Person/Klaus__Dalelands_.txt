Klaus was an adventuring cleric in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
During his time in Harrow Hill, Klaus was injured, but forbidden from healing himself. He had a number of spells prepared, including cure light wounds, know alignment, light, slow poison.
He had a mace and chain mail. He also carried a stone of good luck that boosted even his attempts at turning undead, and an enchanted candle that provided him with a circle of protection.
Before being trapped in Harrow Hill, Klaus was part of a group. They abandoned him to escape the mansion.
At some point the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Klaus was part of a temple with high priests, who gifted him an enchanted candle.
Klaus later went traveling with a group of adventurers across the Dalelands. When a fog blanketed the land, Gunter Weiss trapped them in his house. When he asked them to surrender one of their own in exchange for passage, Klaus was chosen. Though he remained inside the house, his enchanted candle protected him.
Six days layer, more travelers chanced upon the house. Having no fight left in him, should more adventurers chance upon him, Klaus did not offer to fight alongside them. He merely shared what he overheard from the spirits in the house, including his knowledge of Erika and Gunters hidden crypt and silver heart. He also mentioned his companions had become lost souls for betraying him.
