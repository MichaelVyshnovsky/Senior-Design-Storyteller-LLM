'''Vanar Freth''' was a [[drow]] [[wizard]] of [[House Freth]] who dwelled within [[Spiderwatch Keep]], deep within the bowels of the dungeon-complex known as [[Undermountain]].

==History==
In the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], Vanar and two of his fellow drow infiltrated the domain of [[Arcturiadoom]]. They sought to steal powerful magic and aid their house's conquest of the deeper levels of Undermountain. During his excursion, Vanar was accompanied by a [[shadow demon]] he had summoned.
