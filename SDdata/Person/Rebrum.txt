}}'''Rebrum''' was a travelling merchant from [[Sheirtalar]] in [[Lapaliiya]].

==History==
Around [[1210 DR]], Rebrum wrote the ''[[Life of Rebrum]]'', a bawdy autobiography that was frequently copied. In it, among other things, Rebrum wrote of the "[[Eleave]]" trade-fair in [[Vaerndoun]] in the [[Underdark]]. Here, Rebrum mentioned a group of [[drow]] traders, sent by their matrons, who attempted to barter the ''[[Chanting Chain]]'', a holy relic of [[Talos]] the Destroyer, to another group of drow from a distant city.
