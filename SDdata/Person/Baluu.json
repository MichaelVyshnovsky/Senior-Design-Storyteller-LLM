        "mainbody": "Baluu was a pangolin katanga sorcerer from the jungles of the Malatran Plateau active in the late 14 century DR.\nBaluu was a reluctant hero, pessimistic and cowardly by nature.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the Tribe of the Wise Ones became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded spider katanga, the Mother of a Thousand Young was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Baluu was assigned to travel with a group of experienced heroes of the jungle despite him being significantly less powerful than those in the group. Baluus band was heading into the spider katanga caverns, past the living quarters, and straight into the most dangerous part of the lair â€“ the nest to face the Mother.\nIt was unknown if Baluu survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the Village of the Wise Ones for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and natures healing."
