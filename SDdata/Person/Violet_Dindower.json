She dressed in a low-cut brown tunic, and wore several pieces of jewelry.\nShe truly enjoyed her line of work. In addition to granting her a decent income, it provided her with enough risks to \"keep life spicy.\"\nViolet carried five packets of dust of disappearance,\nShe also owned a short sword +1, and a suit of leather armor +2.\nViolet was dissatisfied with trying to eke out a living in Waterdeep. When a spelljammer stopped for repairs in the city, Violet jumped at the chance to sign on as a cook.\nHer stealthy eliminations of unwanted guests endeared Violet to the ships captain on many occasions."
