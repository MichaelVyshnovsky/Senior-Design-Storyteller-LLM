        "mainbody": "'''Dabnay Tr'arach''' was a novice priestess of [[Lolth]] of [[House Tr'arach]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Dab'nay had short white hair, red lips, and high cheekbones.<ref>",
        "History": "Dab'nay hailed from House Tr'arach, a small house.\n\nIn [[1018 DR]], Dab'nay was studying at [[Arach-Tinilith]].\n\nAfter a completely failed attack on [[House Simfray]], Dab'nay was with her mother, the Matron Mother [[Hauzz Tr'arach]], who complained to [[Horroodissomoth Xorlarrin]] about the failure.\n\nLater, she covertly helped [[Zaknafein]] to enter House Tr'arach's complex to kill her mother. However, after the death of Hauzz, Zaknafein informed her that, contrary to the pact she had with [[Jarlaxle]], House Tr'arach was no more and her only chance of survival was to join [[Bregan D'aerthe]].\n\nThus, by [[1118 DR]] she had joined Jarlaxle and that year Dab'nay helped Zak to ambush [[Arathis Hune]]. In truth, she was playing a deadly game with Matron [[Soulez Armgo]] of [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]] to increase her power; Matron Soulez offered Dab'nay a place in her House in exchange for the death of Zaknafein.\n\nIn [[1119 DR]], she conspired with Arathis and Matron Soulez to kill Zak; the assassin and the weapon master were both called to an isolated spot and there were attacked by a [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]] war party led by [[Uthegentel Del'Armgo]]. They partnered and managed to kill most of the Armgo warriors, but not Uthegentel, when suddenly Arathis and Dab'nay attacked Zaknafein. Zaknafein however had cleverly expected the betrayal and finally managed to kill the assassin but spare Dab'nay. Despite all this, Mother Soulez was satisfied with the result and rewarded Dab'any by admitting her into House Armgo.\n\nIn [[1296 DR]], she was again in Bregan D'aerthe, as one of the few woman in the group and the only priestess. That year she discussed with Jarlaxle about the proposed job from [[Masoj Hun'ett]].\n\nIn [[1488 DR]], Dab'nay was still one of the few women in Bregan D'aerthe and was based in [[Luskan]]. She plotted with [[Beniago]], [[Braelin Janquay]], and [[Wulfgar]] on how regain control of Luskan after the [[Margaster]] takeover; for this they listened to the news reported by [[Bonnie Charlee]].\n\nIn [[1490 DR]], Dab'nay traveled with Jarlaxle and aided him, along with Artemis and Zaknafein, in an attack on the ship of Captain [[Arrongo]], the ''[[Pelican]]''.<ref>",
        "Relationships": "By 1118 DR, Dab'nay had had a liaison with Zaknafein. In [[1318 DR]], they resumed their affair. She was very close to her brother Duvon."
