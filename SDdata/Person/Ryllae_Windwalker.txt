Ryllae Windwalker was the commander of Evermeets navy in 1367 DR.
Ryllae was often away from the isle leading patrols of the surrounding sea with her flagship, the Dolphin, and other vessels. However, sometimes she sailed alone beyond the Wave Rocks, coming near Moray and Gwynneth.
Ryllae truly loved the sea and was very restless. Nobody knew what she sought when she sailed, even herself. Ryllae was very outspoken and free with her emotions despite her sun elf heritage. She was a very able wizard, warrior, and sailor.
Some said Ryllae had aquatic elf blood.
Ryllae had many sea elf friends and had good dealings with their ruler.
