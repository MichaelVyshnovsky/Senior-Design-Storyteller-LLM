The sorceresses later convened on the sky over the palace and some balefire, where she pointed out which Houses had to be watched for, expecting they would respond violently to the recent events such as the naming of a [[human]], Elminster, as armathor.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|238|12}} She then took part in the protection of [[Mythanthor]], getting first assigned to making a web of spells that listened for anyone speaking of him.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|289-290|15}}\n\nIn {{yearlink|261}} she helped defend [[Eltargrim]] after [[Llombaerth Starym]] and his army attempted to overthrow the Coronal, and then carried the arrows from Starym's army into the chamber where they wove the ''[[Mythal]]''.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|357|Epilogue}} She remained at the ready, as a witness when [[Symrustar Auglamyr]] helped fight [[Uldreiyn Starym]], and almost struck her down too.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|373|Epilogue}}"
