'''Zeldan''' was a merchant in the city of [[Waterdeep]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Zeldan was rather short in stature.

==Activities==
Zeldan was a smoker and a devout worshiper of [[Gond]].

==History==
For much of his time living in Waterdeep, Zeldan funded the construction of townhomes and warehouses around what would come to be named [[Zeldan's Alley]]. Under the cover of these construction projects, Zeldan spent much of his fortune sponsoring [[priest]]s of the [[Church of Gond]], who traveled to Waterdeep to build and install various experimental devices in the alley.

''Circa'' [[1337 DR]], Zeldan met his end when a [[construct]] meant to gently raise him so he could paint a wall had instead smashed him through it.
