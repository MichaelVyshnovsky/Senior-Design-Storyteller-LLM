'''Shan Nikkoleth''' was a [[death knight]] commander of the varied armies of [[undead]], [[cambion]]s, and [[demon]]s in [[Hellgate Keep]].

==Activities==
For his lord [[Grintharke]], this powerful death knight led and directed many patrols. Many of these patrols scoured the wilderness for treasure for their master and the Keep. Due to this, Hellgate Keep became a house for the treasures of many lost realms.

Much like his master, Shan was reputed to have an other worldly origin.
