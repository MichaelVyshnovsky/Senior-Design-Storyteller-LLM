Shan Nikkoleth was a death knight commander of the varied armies of undead, cambions, and demons in Hellgate Keep.
For his lord Grintharke, this powerful death knight led and directed many patrols. Many of these patrols scoured the wilderness for treasure for their master and the Keep. Due to this, Hellgate Keep became a house for the treasures of many lost realms.
Much like his master, Shan was reputed to have an other worldly origin.
