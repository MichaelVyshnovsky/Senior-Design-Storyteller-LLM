        "mainbody": "'''Baralen the Black''' was an infamous pirate who once kidnapped the daughter of [[Lord Tygarian]].",
        "History": "Sometime before [[1372 DR]], Baralen managed to capture and hold hostage Lord Tygarian's daughter. The pirate's ransom was paid with a set of [[enchanted]] ''[[light armor]]'', ''[[Fencer's Grace]]''. However, Baralen refused to release his prisoner anyway. When Lord Tygarian's daughter found out, she flew into blind rage and killed her kidnapper with a single strike. She took the ransom armor and used it to become a pirate herself."
