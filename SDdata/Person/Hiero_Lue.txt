'''Hiero Lue''' was a [[bard]] member of the [[Dead Eyes]], a criminal group from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] that named itself for the grim trophies they collected from the enemies in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|When I told sis she promised I can kill him once the job is done, which makes sense I 'spose - she's the boss for a reason. I'll just have to sharpen my blades in the meantime. I'm gonna start with that tongue of his, I reckon...|[[Maggie Ni Chuirc]]}}

==Description==
Hiero was a [[dwarf|dwarvish]] man with a stern face and a bulbous nose. He had a light skin tone and small dark eyes. The dwarf had well-styled hair dyed blonde, a trimmed beard, and a mustache of light mousy brown color. He wore the flashy green garb of a bar and wielded a simple [[rapier]] or a [[hand crossbow]] in combat. His instrument of choice was a [[lute]].

==Abilities==
The bard's favorite [[spell]]s included ''[[cloud of daggers]]'', ''[[hypnotic pattern]]'', and ''[[cure wounds]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Dead Eyes set out to perform a job that would end up setting the gang against [[the Guild]] and its leader, [[Ninefingers]]. The Guild did not take competition lightly and sent thugs to take care of the Dead Eyes. The band survived and relocated to a new lair. Unbeknownst to [[Aideen Ni Chuirc]] â€“ the gang's leader, one of her men was a traitor. Hiero Lue uncovered the secret stash where Aideen hid the loot, including the Guild's [[coin]], and sent a note to Ninefingers, informing the Guild of the Dead Eyes' lair and the hidden stash's location. Hiero asked Ninefingers to strike at the hideout swiftly as [[Maggie Ni Chuirc]], the leader's sister, was furious when she discovered Hiero found out her sister's secret. Maggie wanted to kill the bard but reported him to Aideen, who, in turn, stated that once the job was done, she would end the treacherous bard herself. Maggie did not like the idea of keeping the bard alive that long but conceded that her sister knew better as the group's leader. It was unknown if Hiero Lue and the Dead Eyes survived an attack from the Guild or other eager adventurers of Baldur's Gate.
