'''Othur Roonsundyr''' was a reclusive [[wizard]] in [[Skullport]].

==Personality==
Othur was the most militant recluse in the [[North]]. He did not like people, seeming to find no joy in anything that he or anyone else created. His soft side was touched only by the art and poetry of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Activities==
Othur's fields of study were runes, symbols, and ward magic. He was the greatest expert in Skullport about them, and one of the major scholars in these topics outside [[Candlekeep]].
