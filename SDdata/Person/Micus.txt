'''Micus''' was an [[astral deva]] servant of [[Tyr]]. He was a high-ranking member of the Court of Tyr and one of [[Tauran]]'s closest friends.

==Description==
Micus had close-cropped dark hair.

==History==
In [[1373 DR]], Micus and Tauran captured [[Kashada|Kashada the Nightwraith]] in [[Sundabar]] and imprisoned her in a permanently glowing sphere.

In [[1385 DR]], when [[Mystra]] was killed, magical forces melded Micus with the [[Half-dragon|draconic]] [[hobgoblin]] [[Myshik Morueme]], turning them into a [[dragon]]-[[hobgoblin]]-[[deva]] abomination. When [[Kaanyr Vhok]] joined forces with Vhissilka, she gave Vhok a metal cuff to wear that [[Dominate person|dominated]] Micus-Myshik; Vhok subsequently used him to taunt Tauran. Micus-Myshik was then slain by [[Kael]], a knight of [[Torm]], after the [[drow]] wizard [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] was able to trap him in a spell.
