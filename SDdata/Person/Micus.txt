Micus was an astral deva servant of Tyr. He was a high-ranking member of the Court of Tyr and one of Taurans closest friends.
Micus had close-cropped dark hair.
In 1373 DR, Micus and Tauran captured Kashada the Nightwraith in Sundabar and imprisoned her in a permanently glowing sphere.
In 1385 DR, when Mystra was killed, magical forces melded Micus with the draconic hobgoblin Myshik Morueme, turning them into a dragon-hobgoblin-deva abomination. When Kaanyr Vhok joined forces with Vhissilka, she gave Vhok a metal cuff to wear that dominated Micus-Myshik Vhok subsequently used him to taunt Tauran. Micus-Myshik was then slain by Kael, a knight of Torm, after the drow wizard Pharaun Mizzrym was able to trap him in a spell.
