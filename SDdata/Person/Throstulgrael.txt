'''Throstulgrael''', or '''"Velvet"''', was a [[dragon aging|young]] male [[black dragon]] who laired in the [[Flooded Forest]] in the lands of the [[Moonsea]] and [[the Vast]] in [[north Faerûn]].

==History==
By [[1369 DR]], Velvet was waging a feud with the much older [[green dragon]] [[Jaerathindryl|Malachite]], who lived in the forests south of [[Mulmaster]]. Velvet sought to move in on Malachite's territory.

Velvet still lived by [[1374 DR]].

In [[1489 DR]], Throstulgrael tried to enslave the [[lizardfolk]] tribes of [[Twilight Marsh]] near [[Phlan]],{{Cite adventurers league/Drums in the Marsh|5}} but his plot was ruined by some adventurers.{{Cite adventurers league/Drums in the Marsh|17}} The black dragon also captured the skilled drow assassin [[Yusten Karas]], who was forced to work for him. Later that year, he was confronted by an adventuring party sent to recover some items from the dragon's lair but when he seemed to have been killed, he mysteriously resurrected as a [[dracolich]] and flew away.{{Cite adventurers league/Raiders of the Twilight Marsh|21}}

==Allies==
In the 14th century, Velvet was supported by a [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell based near either [[Calaunt]] or [[Kurth (town)|Kurth]]. Though not particularly large or powerful, the cell was well organized and its members were close-knit. They feuded with Malachite's own Cult cell.

==Relationship==
In Twilight Marsh, he had one [[half-dragon]] son: [[Graxxygak]].{{Cite adventurers league/Raiders of the Twilight Marsh}}
