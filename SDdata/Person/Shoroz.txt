==Description==
Shoroz was quite tall but was stooped over.

==Activities==
Shoroz believed wholeheartedly in the caliph's vision for Hilm and worked diligently to help his vision become reality. He would often use his magic to disguise both himself and the caliph so they could walk among the common people of Hilm to discover their true interests and needs.
