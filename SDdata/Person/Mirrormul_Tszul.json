        "mainbody": "Mirrormul Tszul was a human sage in the city of Waterdeep around 1368 DR. His expertise was centered around the biology and languages of both humans and giants, though he also had a minor specialty in demihuman languages.\nMirrormul was a very energetic, excitable yet nervous man. He was known to speak at a breakneck pace, even when calm. His excitable energy was quite visible whenever someone inquired with a task or question, as his emotions always got swept up in the chance to tackle an intellectual challenge.\nMirrormul was a devout worshiper of Silvanus. As such, he never hesitated to accept requests for aid from the gods priests."
