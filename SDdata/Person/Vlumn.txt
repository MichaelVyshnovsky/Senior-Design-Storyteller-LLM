'''Vlumn''' was a [[wizard]] operating in the [[High Ice]] of [[north Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Vlumn was engaged in some sort of scheme to create [[ice golem]]s the size of mountains..

==History==
Late in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, [[Elminster]] related to [[Storm Silverhand]] that he was prevented from helping protect [[Shandril Shessair]] (who was at that moment fighting at [[Irondrake Rock]]) by the urgency of stopping, amongst other things, the schemes of Vlumn for the creation of unfathomably large ice golems.
