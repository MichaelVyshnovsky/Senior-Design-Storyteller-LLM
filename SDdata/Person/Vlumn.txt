Vlumn was a wizard operating in the High Ice of north Faerûn in the mid–14 century DR.
Vlumn was engaged in some sort of scheme to create ice golems the size of mountains..
Late in the , Elminster related to Storm Silverhand that he was prevented from helping protect Shandril Shessair (who was at that moment fighting at Irondrake Rock) by the urgency of stopping, amongst other things, the schemes of Vlumn for the creation of unfathomably large ice golems.
