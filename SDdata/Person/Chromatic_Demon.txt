The Chromatic Demon was a tanarri imprisoned in Watchers Keep in Amn.
He was forced into Helms service to secure the Imprisoned One in the keep. He guarded a level of the dungeon imprisoned in a magical cage, and only he had the key for the next level. Eventually, the demon met Gorions Ward and convinced him to release him in exchange for the key. But when Gorions Ward collected all the items to free the Chromatic Demon, the demon tried to kill Gorions Ward but was instead killed himself.
