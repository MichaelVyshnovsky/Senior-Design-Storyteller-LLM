'''Flaev Linnacker''' was a member of the [[Linnacker]] [[patriar]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Flaev Linnacker was found dead, alongside the bodies of [[Ulis Oberon]] and [[Malghar Caldwel]], within the territory controlled by [[the Guild]] and guarded by its thugs, near the entrance to the Guildhall in the [[Lower City]]. All three patriars were nothing but charred remains. Nearby, Flaev's possessions revealed the reason for his murder â€“ unpaid debts to the Guild. The patriar's bakery claimed to have no income due to lockdowns and offered the collectors to be paid with [[Calimshan Knots]].
