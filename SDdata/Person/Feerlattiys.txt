'''Feerlattiys''' was a [[sahuagin]] captain of the [[City of Caverns]] in the late 1360s [[DR]].

==Description==
The captain was curious about, and intrigued by, those other than his own kind.

==Combat==
Feerlattiys was skilled with the [[spear]] and the [[crossbow]]. He utilized different types of [[bolt]]s, from ''[[paralytic bolt|paralytic]]'' to ''[[biting bolt|biting]]'' ''[[bolt]]s''.

==History==
When outsiders reached the City of Caverns in [[1369 DR]], the captain and High Priestess [[Senityili]] greeted them. At first, they could not understand, so the priestess called upon [[Sekolah]] to grant them understanding of their language. The curious captain asked the priestess if the foreigners could understand them, and if they were potentially dangerous. He trusted in the high priestess, and believed that [[Gorion's Ward]] was the chosen of Sekolah's prophecy. The captain supported the rebel cause of Prince [[Villynaty]].
