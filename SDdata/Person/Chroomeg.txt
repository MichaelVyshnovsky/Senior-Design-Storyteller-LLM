Chroomeg () was a tavern owner in Mulmaster.
The tavern owner was a gregarious and affable man with hints of orc blood in his veins.
Chroomeg managed the Oxpit Tavern in a lower part of the city.
While managing a good tavern, in 1491 DR, Chroomeg had trouble with some vandals. During a party at Astrid Sajs estate, he decided to hire an adventuring party to solve the matter.
