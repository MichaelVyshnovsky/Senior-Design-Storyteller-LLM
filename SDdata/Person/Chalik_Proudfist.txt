==Abilities==
Chalik received prophetic visions that guided her actions and those of her tribe. 

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Chalik and the Proudfists served [[Vansi Bloodscar]] in the [[Many-Arrows]] occupation of the [[Neverwinter/River District|River District]] of [[Neverwinter]] and fought against the [[Neverwinter Guard]]. When a [[half-elf]] adventurer sought to prove their worth to the Proudfists in an effort to persuade them to change sides, Chalik claimed to have already had a vision of them and believed they would help guide the Proudfists on a journey that would bring them prosperity beyond what they ever thought possible. Already trusting the adventurer, she had them inform Captain [[Janros]] of their change of loyalties.
