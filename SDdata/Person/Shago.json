        "mainbody": "'''Shago''' ({{Pronounce|SHAW|go|refs=}}) was a [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] man working as a guide out of [[Fort Beluarian]], [[Chult]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Chult is full of wonders and Shago knows the way!|Shago}}",
        "Description": "He was quite large, standing at {{SI|6'3|'\"}} and {{SI|220|lbs|k}}. He had rippling muscles and a winning smile.",
        "Personality": "Shago was boastful, describing himself as having \"the heart of a [[tyrannosaurus]]\" and to be unafraid of hard work or danger. He claimed to be proficient in fighting, foraging, [[canoe]]ing, camping, and whatever else a client might need from a guide.",
        "Activities": "Shago often worked as a jungle guide for [[Flaming Fist]] excursions seeking to clear [[undead]] from the Chultan jungles despite an intense personal fear about being turned into a [[zombie]] or [[ghoul]]. However, he believed that the Flaming Fist represented Chult's best hope for being rid of the undead that plagued them.\n\nWhen hired by other parties, he presented himself as a true independent guide despite his sympathies lying with the Flaming Fist.",
        "Relationships": "He sought to make an impression with the Flaming Fist's Commander [[Liara Portyr]], and hoped to gain admittance into the military organization.\n\nShago's mother was the [[noble]] merchant prince [[Zhanthi]] of Port Nyanzaru, who recruited him to act as a spy to relay information he gleaned from Fort Beluarian. However Shago remained devoted to the Flaming Fist, and only offered middling information to her.\n\nShago's death was sought by his mother's rival, the merchant prince [[Kwayoth√©]], who considered hiring [[adventurer]]s to kill him.",
        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Shago claimed to have been to such places within the Chultan jungle as [[Kir Sabal]], [[Firefinger]], and the [[Peaks of Flame]]."
