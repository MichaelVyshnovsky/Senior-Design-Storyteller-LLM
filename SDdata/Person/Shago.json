        "mainbody": "Shago () was a Chultan man working as a guide out of Fort Beluarian, Chult in the late 15 century DR.\nHe was quite large, standing at  and . He had rippling muscles and a winning smile.\nShago was boastful, describing himself as having \"the heart of a tyrannosaurus\" and to be unafraid of hard work or danger. He claimed to be proficient in fighting, foraging, canoeing, camping, and whatever else a client might need from a guide.\nShago often worked as a jungle guide for Flaming Fist excursions seeking to clear undead from the Chultan jungles despite an intense personal fear about being turned into a zombie or ghoul. However, he believed that the Flaming Fist represented Chults best hope for being rid of the undead that plagued them.\nWhen hired by other parties, he presented himself as a true independent guide despite his sympathies lying with the Flaming Fist.\nHe sought to make an impression with the Flaming Fists Commander Liara Portyr, and hoped to gain admittance into the military organization.\nShagos mother was the noble merchant prince Zhanthi of Port Nyanzaru, who recruited him to act as a spy to relay information he gleaned from Fort Beluarian. However Shago remained devoted to the Flaming Fist, and only offered middling information to her.\nShagos death was sought by his mothers rival, the merchant prince Kwayoth√©, who considered hiring adventurers to kill him.\nBy the late 15 century DR, Shago claimed to have been to such places within the Chultan jungle as Kir Sabal, Firefinger, and the Peaks of Flame."
