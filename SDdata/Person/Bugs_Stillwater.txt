Bugs Stillwater was a member of The Guild from the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
In the , Bugs Stillwater was among the members of the Guild who noticed strange shifting shadows in the darkness around the Guildhall. Bugs claimed that he had nothing to drink that night and that the shadow changed shape. Presumably, the shadow was one of the many murderous doppelgangers of Bhaal, spying on the The Guild.
During that year, Bugs was also a customer of Bonecloaks Apothecary in the Lower City. He made the error of taking medical advice from the Baldurs Mouth Gazette. On the broadsheets advice, the spellcaster had been taking a concoction of healing potions and sherry daily for nine months to help with his spells. However, Bugs noticed that the treatments stopped working, and he was afraid of increasing the dosage after witnessing the grim fate of Aunt Balmyre. He wrote a letter to the Bonecloaks Apothecary, asking for a new treatment or advice to deal with the returned spells.
