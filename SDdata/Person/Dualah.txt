'''Dualah''' was a female [[human]] cleric of [[Umberlee]] in [[Hillsfar]] in [[1367 DR]].

Lord [[Maalthiir]] seemed interested in her However, Dualah was a follower of [[Mordak Brelliar]], Maalthiir's apprentice, who tried to use this to his advantage, to gain information on Maalthiir. Dualah knew nothing about these plots.
