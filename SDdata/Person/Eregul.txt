Eregul (Pronounce|ER|eh|GULL|refs=
Eregul was tall with black hair and a beard. He also had hard, dark eyes.
Eregul was a cautious and scheming individual who spoke with a drawling voice peppered with sardonic mannerisms. He was always in search of the best opportunities to rise in rank. He greatly disliked Orgauth for his eternal smile.
Eregul had a loyal foulwing steed named Zvopua.
Eregul joined the Zhentarim as an independent ally of Manshoon in order to gain power and influence. His long-term plan was to supplant Thagdal as master of the Tower of the Art in Zhentil Keep and obtain a place in the Lords Council. He wandered Cormyr, Sembia and the Dalelands. In 1370 DR, however, Eregul was in Darkhold to take command of the Zhent wizards there.
In 1375 DR, Eregul was the most high-ranking Zhent wizard in the Zhentarim Occupation Army in Shadowdale.
During the fighting in the dale, he led a supply caravan arriving from Voonlar. However, some adventurers and Dalesfolk ambushed the caravan and during the fighting Eregul was killed.
