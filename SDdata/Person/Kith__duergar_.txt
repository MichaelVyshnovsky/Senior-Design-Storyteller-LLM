Stonemason '''Kith''' was a craftsman of [[Clan Flameshade]] that took up residence in [[Grymforge]] for a time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{Quote|Incredible—an entire history, risen from dirt and debris!|Stonemason Kith.}}

==Personality==
Kith was a compassionate [[dwarf]]—at least compared to other [[duergar]] from his clan—that was wholly dedicated to his craft as a stone mason.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the duergar of Clan Flameshade began an excavation of Grymforge with the aim of staking claim on an [[adamantine forge]]. While his fellow clansman followed the orders [[Nere]] and the [[cult of the Absolute]], Kith spent his time studying the ruined architecture of the underground fortress, hoping to learn more about its history and downfall.
