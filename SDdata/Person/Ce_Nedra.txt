'''Ce'Nedra''' was a powerful and villainous [[wizard|sorceress]] who menaced the [[dwarves]] of [[Citadel Felbarr]] sometime before [[1054 DR]].<ref group="note">The book references the Ma'atar Oasis and the [[Bedine]] tribe that lived there. In Issue 1, the oasis and the Bedine are wiped out, placing the events of the comic series some time before 1360 DR, when the [[Zhentarim]] artificially re-created the oasis and established a hold there. The flashback takes place sometime before [[1054 DR]], before the dwarves abandoned Citadel Felbarr.

==Description==
Ce'Nedra had slender athletic physique. She had waist-long red hair and facial tattoos in the shape of three tears under her left eye. The sorceress wore a voluminous black-and-green hooded [[cloak]] and long thigh-high boots. She preferred to wear light and revealing green robes, decorative chest guard, and copious rings and bracelets on both hands. Her left leg was decorated with a tattoo of a [[spider]].

==Personality==
Ce'Nedra had a cocky and vicious personality.

==Abilities==
[[File:Ce'Nedra's sand golem.jpg|thumb|''Ce'Nedra in her sand golem shape.''|340x340px]]
The sorceress was a talented arcane spellcaster. Her magic was dangerous and destructive. Among the spells she possessed were ''[[fly]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', and many others. She could ''[[polymorph]]'' herself into a powerful and deadly [[sand golem]].

She also was skilled in acrobatics.

==Possessions==
''[[Ce'Nedra's medallion]]'' was a powerful [[enchanted]] [[amulet]] that belonged to the sorceress. The item possessed magics that enhanced the owner's spellcasting abilities, and allowed non-wizards to tap into its powers when their lives were in danger.

She was known to carry vials of [[acid]].

==History==
Sometime before 1054 DR, Ce'Nedra rained death and destruction on the small dwarven village of [[Stonejewel]], located at the entrance to the [[Stronghold of Uziul]] in Citadel Felbarr. The woman cast ''fireballs'' and ''lightning bolts'' on the dwarves. But one of the warriors stood against the sorceressâ€”[[Arokin Steelarm]]. He lunged at her and managed to snatch ''Ce'Nedra's medallion'' off her neck before being defeated and left for dead. Unbeknownst to her, Arokin survived and set out to stop the evil creature.

Some time later, before [[1360 DR]], Ce'Nedra sought to gain the power hidden deep within the mysteriously manifested [[great pyramid]] of [[Anauroch]]. In order to gain access to the ancient structure, she took shape of a sand golem and slaughtered the [[Bedine]] tribe that resided in the Oasis of [[Ma'atar]]. She slew the leader's son - [[Rahmed]], the leader's wife, and tortured the old man, leaving him crucified, slowly dying in the Anauroch's sun.

Even though not much was known of the outcome of Ce'Nedra's quest, she gained entrance to the guarded chambers within the great pyramid while being pursued by adventurers Arokin Steelarm, [[Aileen (Anauroch)|Aileen]], [[Gwidre]], and [[Farad'n]] - the son of the Bedine tribe leader the sorceress tortured to death.
