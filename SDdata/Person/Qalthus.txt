Qalthus was a Shadovar shadar-kai mage involved in&mdashand later outcast from&mdashthe Netherese effort to restore the fallen enclave of Xinlenal in the late 15 century DR.
He was driven by rage
He was a dedicated and tireless researcher.
He was outcast by the Netherese after the labor foreman at Xinlenal, Korvina, blamed him for her mistakes in order to save face with Prince Clariburnus Tanthul.
Qalthus was then recruited to aid a cult of fire-worshipers led by Gommoth in their disorderly efforts to trigger a second awakening of Maegera and another eruption of Mount Hotenow.
In the decades following the eruption of Mount Hotenow, Qalthus was a high-ranking member of the Shadovar team excavating Xinlenal. When fellow shadar-kai mage Korvina accidentally caused the fallen citys mythallar to weaken, she pinned the blame on Qalthus, who was expelled and became an outcast.
By , Qalthus had become the newest member of a cult composed mostly of fire creatures and elementals based within Mount Hotenow, and led their efforts to cause an eruption. While he had not figured out how to make this happen, he was confident that his endless research and experimentation would eventually lead him to discover a ritual powerful enough to awaken the volcano. His fanatical devotion to the cult was driven by his personal grievances and desire to rain fire upon Xinlenal.
