        "History": "Esclarotta was the wife of Blagothkus before she died. Somehow, he managed to resurrect her spirit and used her to manage the flying [[Skyreach Castle]].\n\nIf Blagothkus died for any reason, then he would replace Esclarotta as the spirit powering the castle. Presumably she would then go to the [[afterlife]].",
        "Personality": "Esclarotta greatly disliked all those cultists, [[dragon]]s, and [[kobold]]s inside her castle, but loved her husband too much to act."
