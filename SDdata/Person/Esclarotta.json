Somehow, he managed to resurrect her spirit and used her to manage the flying Skyreach Castle.\nIf Blagothkus died for any reason, then he would replace Esclarotta as the spirit powering the castle. Presumably she would then go to the afterlife.\nEsclarotta greatly disliked all those cultists, dragons, and kobolds inside her castle, but loved her husband too much to act."
