'''Augusta Krul''' was a member of the [[Swords of Leilon]], a group of [[adventurers]] based in [[Leilon]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. After her death, Augusta's [[ghost]] remained bound to [[Leilon]] until the late 15{{th}} century DR.

==Description==
Augusta was a dark-skinned [[Turmish]] warrior woman. She wore [[chainmail]] armor.

==Activities==
As a member of the loosely organized Swords of Leilon, Augusta protected Leilon until its fall in 1385 DR.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century DR, Augusta Krul was an adventurer in the region around Leilon. Together with [[Aubrey Silverspun]] and [[Ogri Ninebeards]], the other two members of the Swords of Leilon, Augusta protected Leilon before its fall. The [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]] broke the magical wards of the [[High Tower of Thalivar]] and released all of the monsters within, who then killed the tower's [[wizard]], [[Thalivar]], and rampaged through the village. The Swords battled to cover the townsfolk's escape. They died, becoming bound to Leilon's ruins as ghosts.

By the early 1490s DR, great strides had been made to rebuild both Leilon and the High Tower of Thalivar. Augusta kept a close eye on the town's reconstruction, hoping that the repaired tower would not cause another calamity. When Thalivar's ghost began haunting the tower, Augusta watched over a group of adventurers who laid the ghost to rest.

Augusta and the other Swords of Leilon helped defend Leilon during the [[Battle of Leilon]], a three-way battle in which Leilon was besieged by both the [[Cult of Talos]] and the [[Cult of Myrkul]]. Together with a group of adventurers, they fought against [[Chardansearavitriol|Ebondeath]], who had possessed the ancient [[green dragon]] [[Claugiyliamatar]].
