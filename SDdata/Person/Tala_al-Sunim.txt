Tala al-Sunim was a tax collector who worked at the Gulf Gate in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Though passed 60 years of age, Tala was as sharp as she was in her youth.
Tala had a positive reputation for fairness, except when dealing with sly caravan masters who tried to trick her simply because she was an old woman.
