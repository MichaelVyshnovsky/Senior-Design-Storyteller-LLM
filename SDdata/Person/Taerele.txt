'''Taerele''' was a reclusive [[Chosen of Mystra]] who made home somewhere in the [[East Faerûn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
One of the two rarely seen Chosen, Taerele was a hermit who had no interest in interacting with [[human]]s or any other civilizations. Instead, she spent her life learning to and repairing ''[[the Weave]]'' as well as mastering its manipulation.
