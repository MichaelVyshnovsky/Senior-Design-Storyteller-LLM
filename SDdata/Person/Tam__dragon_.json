        "Relationships": "Tam was a moody creature and terrified the drow who were providing her with meat.",
        "History": "Sometime before [[1370 DR]], the red dragon Tam was convinced to join forces with Azurna. She made a lair in a vast domed hall in Azurna's drow stronghold alongside her several hatchlings. The red wyrmlings were trained by [[drow]] to become their most powerful weapon against the City of Splendors. [[Sirian Flametongue]] was one of the young red dragons spawned by Tam and who willingly joined with Azurna's forces only to be slain by [[Khelbenite]] in [[Eleint]] of 1370 DR."
