'''Xet''' was [[Thormud Horn]]'s familiar. It resembled a [[dragonet]] carved out of [[opal]].{{cite book/Darkvision|29-30}} It was given away to [[Kiril Duskmourn]] in {{yearlink|1374}}.

==Description==
Xet resembled a small dragonet made of [[opal]]. Its cry was like a [[chime]].

==Personality==
Though it resembled a dragon, it distinctly lacked the courage of one.{{cite book/Darkvision|79}}{{cite book/Darkvision|262}}{{cite book/Stardeep|109}} It was, however, capable of higher reasoning and of concern for its masters, as it showed when it brought Kiril Duskmourn a fur while she was passed out on a street.{{cite book/Stardeep|56}}

At times, it got annoyingly underfoot.{{cite book/Darkvision|209}}

==Abilities==
Xet could fly, and it was surprisingly ornery for its size.{{cite book/Stardeep|218}}{{cite book/Stardeep|306}} It often served as an adequate warning system, crying when it noticed something wrong.{{cite book/Darkvision|74}}{{cite book/Stardeep|112}} In a pinch, it could use its sharp claws to make a nuisance of itself.{{cite book/Stardeep|288}} It could also remember paths, and serve as a light source,{{cite book/Darkvision|230}} though it was quite dim for this purpose.{{cite book/Darkvision|257}}

[[Thormud Horn]] used the creature to fetch objects, and also as a paperweight.{{cite book/Darkvision|80-81}}

==Relationships==
Xet served as [[Thormud Horn]]'s familiar. However, after [[Tarsakh 19]] of {{yearlink|1374}}, it was eventually gifted to [[Kiril Duskmourn]].

==History==
Xet was created prior to 1374 DR. It accompanied its master throughout his quest that year, parting with him only when sent to aid Kiril Duskmourn and [[Prince Monolith]] in the [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]]. While inside the palace, it helped warn the adventurer and the elemental against threats they missed. After their business in the Palace was concluded, Thormud eventually gifted the dragonet to Kiril once she decided to return to Stardeep.

While in the keeping of Kiril, Xet acted occassionally as a caretaker, covering her with a warm fur (of unknown procedence) while she was passed out on the street, reeling in withdrawal from the missing influence of her sword, ''[[Angul]]''. The dragonet also served as a warning system for her on occassion, and attacked some of her enemies, to limited effect.

It accompanied the geomancer and Kiril when they headed for [[Laerakond|Returned Abeir]].{{cite book/Plague of Spells|250}}
