        "mainbody": "'''Tarhun Mnemonis''' was a butler in the employ at [[Lady Jannath's Estate]] in the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Tarhun Mnemonis, butler to Lady Jannath - esteemed patron of the arts. At least, I am most of the time...''|Tarhun Mnemonis}}",
        "Description": "Tarhun was a [[dragonborn]] man with pale tan hide and fiery red eyes. He wore an attendant's finery and wore a fanciful top hat.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Tarhun Mnemonis and Chamberlain [[Mercer]] were two of the most trusted servants of Lady [[Firelia Jannath]] of Baldur's Gate. When the Lady's estate became haunted by Firelia's new husband's ex lover, all of the estate's servants were dismissed, including [[Bailey]], [[Furbleston]], [[Cyrilla]], [[Jooli]], [[Phubbs]], and Chef [[Marjoram (chef)|Marjoram]]. All but Tarhun were placed on temporary leave with the pay of half-wages and allowance to seek temporary employment elsewhere. Butler Mnemonis, however, remained positioned at the estate's doors, turning away guests, collecting the wedding gifts and best wishes on Lady Jannath's behalf, and ensuring everyone that she was spending time with her new husband and nothing else. Tarhun's loyalty prevented him from informing anyone of the true reasoning for the Lady not accepting guests. For the same reason, he would let some eager adventurers in who were insistent on investigating the strange happenings, calming that he was on holiday, like the rest of the staff."
