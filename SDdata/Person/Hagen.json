        "mainbody": "'''Hagen''' was a merchant of [[Neverwinter]] in the 1370s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Since bandits and thugs threatened him to give away gold for them, Hagen lost his trust with the [[Neverwinter Watch]]. If the [[Kalach-Cha]] sided with the Watch to dispose of the thieves, Hagen repaired his standing with the Watch. If the Kalach-Cha sided with the thieves, Hagen would still give away the gold. However, he would reappear in front of [[Caleb]] and have the Watchmen attack him and the Kalach-Cha."
