'''Amarande''' was the [[archdruid|Shadow Archdruid]] the [[Shadow Druids]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He believed that members of his order should inspire dread and subservience in anyone they encountered. He was under no illusion that civilization and nature could exist in harmony with one another.

==Possessions==
Amarande wielded the unique club crafted from the woods of the [[High Forest]], the ''[[Mighty Oak]]''.

==Relationships==
Amarande thought highly of his fellow Shadow Druid [[Faldorn]], seeing her rage as an attribute that could greatly benefit their cause.

Both Amarande and [[Seniyad]] were two of the region's three archdruids, but were polar opposites in their goals and the means by which they sought to achieve them. Amarande thought Seniyad and his followers to be foolish pacifists who were too naive to truly serve nature.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Amarande sought to topple the forces of the [[Iron Throne]] within the [[Cloak Wood]]. He believed the [[Cloak Wood mine|mine]] they established within the forest a few years earlier was a complete affront to nature.
