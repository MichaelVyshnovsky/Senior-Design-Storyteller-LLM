        "mainbody": "Lokelis Brightburn was a white dragon that laired within the Storm Horns, her frozen cave connected to the infamous Haunted Halls near the village of Eveningstar in Cormyr in the 15 century DR.\nIn the 15 century DR, the tunnel that connected Lokeliss lair with the Haunted Halls collapsed, preventing a band of adventurers from the world of Eberron from entering it. After the cave in was cleared out, the group attempted to either steal the dragons egg without disturbing elementals and mephits who shared the lair with Lokelis. It was unknown if the dragon ended up defending her lair and being slain by adventurers, or if they made out with the egg and she collapsed the tunnels behind them once again securing the lair."
