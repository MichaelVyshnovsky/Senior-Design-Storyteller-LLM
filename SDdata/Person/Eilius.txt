Eilius was an individual reporting indirectly to the High Imperceptor of Bane in the mid-14 century DR.
In late mid-, Kuldus related unto the High Imperceptor of Bane that, per Eilius report, Manshoon remained absent from the city since his abrupt mid-meeting departure. Though it hadnt been compiled unto a report yet, he had added that Fzoul sought the beholders, the other lords sought Manshoon, and intrigue was high.
