'''Eilius''' was an individual reporting indirectly to the [[High Imperceptor of Bane]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In late mid-{{yearlink|1357}}, [[Kuldus]] related unto the High Imperceptor of Bane that, per [[Eilius]]' report, Manshoon remained absent from the city since his abrupt mid-meeting departure. Though it hadn't been compiled unto a report yet, he had added that Fzoul sought the beholders, the other lords sought [[Manshoon]], and intrigue was high.
