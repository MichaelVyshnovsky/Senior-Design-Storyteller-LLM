'''Eranar Whittlestone''' was an inhabitant of [[Alaghôn]], the capital of [[Turmish]], who offered his guest house as lodgings in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
As per Turmishian tradition, inhabitants of the nation offered their guest houses as lodgings to travelers and adventurers, trusting them not to steal or vandalize, and only requested guests to refill used supplies, chop wood up, and clean after themselves. Eranar left a pleasant note on his guest house welcoming visitors. One of Eranar's guests was [[Adamar Session]], Bard of Starmantle, and his adventuring companions. They happily used the lodgings during Adamar's ten-year trek across the [[Vilhon Reach]].
