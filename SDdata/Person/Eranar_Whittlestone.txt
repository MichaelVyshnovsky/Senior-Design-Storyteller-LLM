Eranar Whittlestone was an inhabitant of Alagh√¥n, the capital of Turmish, who offered his guest house as lodgings in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
As per Turmishian tradition, inhabitants of the nation offered their guest houses as lodgings to travelers and adventurers, trusting them not to steal or vandalize, and only requested guests to refill used supplies, chop wood up, and clean after themselves. Eranar left a pleasant note on his guest house welcoming visitors. One of Eranars guests was Adamar Session, Bard of Starmantle, and his adventuring companions. They happily used the lodgings during Adamars ten-year trek across the Vilhon Reach.
