'''Garendor''' was a sage of [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, alongside [[Loagranboydar]], [[Orkrash]], [[Wyshbryn]], and [[Argrant]], Garendor had been given the task of investigating the secret records of noble family trees. The [[War Wizard]] Glathra Barcantle sought to make use of their knowledge to find out who had sent a [[blueflame ghost]] against the Crown. However, when Glathra and [[Vainrence]] went to meet with them, they found them to have been reduced to piles of ash, with magic still hanging about their remains.
