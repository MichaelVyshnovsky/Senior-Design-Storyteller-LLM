        "Description": "Elthira was a zealous [[human]] woman with dark freckled skin and brown eyes. She wore a uniform of the Flaming Fist â€“ a [[helmet]], a set of [[chainmail]], and a [[tabard]] adorned with the Flaming Fist insignia. She wielded a massive [[halberd]] in battle.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Fist Elthira Gossen was tasked with patrolling the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], near the [[Basilisk Gate]]. Her zealous attempts to protect the city from the agents of the encroaching army of [[Absolutist]]s led to harassment common folk who happened to strike suspicion in the Fist. Some of the people harassed by Elthira were [[Drongo Bixworth]] and his husband, [[Florean Bixworth]], who were detained and interrogated for the crime of loitering."
