'''Japhoca''' was a [[Rashemi]] grub cook in the caravan which [[Raidon Kane]] joined in Winter of {{yearlink|1375}}. Hard-bitten and blond-haired, she was clear she did not like him from the start. He assumed it was because he was a [[Shou]], but when she refused a cup of tea from him, she grunted that she did not treat with half-bloods.{{cite book/Stardeep|83|9}}

When he bid her farewell, she made a rude hand gesture.{{cite book/Stardeep|124|11}}
