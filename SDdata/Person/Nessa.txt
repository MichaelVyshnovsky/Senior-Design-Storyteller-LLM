'''Nessa''' the Cow was [[Dreppin]]'s favorite animal who loved in the library citadel of [[Candlekeep]] ''circa'' [[1368 DR]].

{{quote|Well, I found that potion for Dreppin's cow. I just hope it's what he thinks it is and not a ''[[potion of fire breath]]'' or something...|[[Abdel Adrian]]'s journal excerpt.}}

==History==
In 1368 DR, Nessa the Cow woke up feeling under the weather and her owner wanted a [[potion]] of ''[[antidote]]'' retrieved from his buddy [[Hull]] in order to cure the bovine affliction. Hull had several of these epotions as he used them to cure his morning morning [[hangover]]s.
