        "mainbody": "'''Charvon''' was a soldier and commander among the [[centaur]]s of [[Guard (village)|Guard]] in [[Bloodstone Barony]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "When [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and his party first arrived in [[Bloodstone Pass]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Charvon was the commander of Guard's cavalry \"legion,\" a force of 160 centaurs armed with [[club]]s. The legion gladly fought alongside Dragonsbane and the forces of [[Bloodstone Village]] to repel an invasion of the Pass by the [[Duchy of Arcata]] in the first battle of the [[Bloodstone Wars]], but subsequently expected a share of the wealth flowing from [[Bloodstone Mines]] before joining his campaign southward. This was despite Charvon's inability or unwillingness to help liberate the mines during the prior winter."
