'''Kellen''' was a trusted sailor aboard the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'', a ship that traveled between the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Chultan Peninsula]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

==History==
In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, Captain [[Lastri Kassireh]] and the ''Vigilant'' sailed from the [[Sword Coast]] to the [[Chult]]an nation of Samarach. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled; freshwater [[barrel]]s ruptured; one of the crew, a sailor, got drunk and drowned; a famous writer aboard the ship, [[Volothamp Geddarm]], almost got poisoned as his poisoned soup took the life of [[Joquin]]; and a fellow sailor, [[Rienur]], noticed new [[rope]]s becoming strangely frayed.

The bad luck was a sabotage by a [[yuan-ti]] spy aboard. Kellen likely fell victim to the snake man's plans. The sailor was thought to have gotten drunk and plummeted over the ship's sides into the [[Trackless Sea]]. He drowned before anyone could notice.
