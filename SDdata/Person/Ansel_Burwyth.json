        "History": "Ansel was hired in [[326 DR]], along with many other mages, by the ruling bodies of [[Tashalar]] to rid them of [[Magister]] [[Onsilur Maerdrathom]] who had become quite a nuisance to their way of life. Ansel succeeded where others who came before him failed. He was able to trap the soul of Onsilur within a ''[[tel'kiira]]''. Lured by the riches left for the taking in Onsilur's [[Liongirt Tower|tower]], Ansel hid the ''kiira'' and entered the tower, only to be killed by the wide array of magical traps Onsilur had in place."
