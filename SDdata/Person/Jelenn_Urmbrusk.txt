Jelenn Urmbrusk () was a moneylender and one of the Lords of Waterdeep during the late 15 century DR.
Jelenn was a proud woman and she feared political scandals. If someone truly helped her, she could become a trusted ally, but anyone that tried to menace her attracted her wrath.
Jelenn was cloistered in her villa or attending her duties as Lord when she was not dealing with her creditors.
In her work as a moneylender, Jelenn had some financial troubles and her customers abandoned her. In desperation and fearing a political scandal, she secretly asked for a large sum of money from the Zhentarim.
In 1492 DR, Manshoon blackmailed Jelenn and forced her to use her political power to cover the activities of the Zhentarim loyal to Manshoon.
