        "mainbody": "Beldabar Yarryn was an innkeeper in Yartar in 1370 DR.\nOnce Beldabar was an adventurer, a member of the Hawks of the North. One day, the Hawks decided to raid Hellgate Keep. Of sixteen members, only three, including Beldabar, survived.\nThey went to Yartar, where they started to run a inn together. Later, the other two went off to adventure again, only to be quickly slaughtered by vengeful agents of Hellgate Keep. Only Beldabar remained alive, thanks to his magical protections in the inn."
