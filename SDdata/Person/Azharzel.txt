'''Azharzel''' was a [[blue dragon]] [[dracolich]].

==History==
At one point, a former high-ranking member of the [[Waterclock Guild]] and secret member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] named [[Romani Monini]] secreted Azharzel in the [[Waterclock Guild's Crypts]] along with the [[Rite of the Dracolich|ritual]] to create a dracolich. ''Circa'' {{Yearlink|1479}}, both the Dragon Cultists and the [[Thayan]] minions of [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] searched for the dragon. Though the Cult of the Dragon breached the crypt first, Valindra killed them and took both the dragon and the ritual, which she promptly used to turn Azharzel into a dracolich.

Soon after Azharzel became a dracolich, he was destroyed at [[Castle Never]] by the [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]].
