        "mainbody": "Krektesh was a dragonborn elder and leader of the Inquest in the Abeiran city of Xorvintroth. After their deaths, Krektesh and their fellows enjoyed second lives as their consciousnesses were preserved as spectral echoes in the Astral Plane.\nKrektesh wore a set of robes adorned with imagery of celestial bodies and symbols associated with the arcane. They wore a necklace upon which sat a large metallic medallion with the image of crown of green crystals.\nWhile in the Astral Plane, Krektesh and the other Inquest elders wore crowns that hovered above their heads, which resembled those on their medallions. These crowns allowed them to avoid the eternal gaze of roaming astral dreadnoughts.\nAlong with their fellow elders, Krekteshs consciousness was transferred to a brain in a jar after their death. While researching the forces of the Far Realm, their minds became trapped in the Astral Plane. Some time later, they arranged for their physical remains and still-living brains to be transported elsewhere in Xorvintroth. \nWhile Krektesh remained in the Astral Plane, a being known as the Emissary of the Nine Eyes showed them a green planet that could serve as a new home for Abeiran dragonborn. This new world would allow them to live free from constant war. The Inquest began construction on the bridge of stars, so the dragonborn could travel to that new viridian planet. Unfortunately, their work would never be completed. \nSome time around the , the living brains of three dragonborn elders—Krektesh, Lirith, and Ukthet―were uncovered by adventurers in the ruins of Xorvintroth. Surprised by encountering new beings, the elders were unaware of their surroundings and expressed concern for the fourth Inquest elder, Graoul."
