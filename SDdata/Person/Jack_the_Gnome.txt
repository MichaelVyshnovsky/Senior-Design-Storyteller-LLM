'''Jack the Gnome''' was a [[gnome]] [[wizard]] of the [[Silver Marches]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Jack had lived in the [[Underdark]] for centuries and was at one time a student of [[illithid]]s and [[demon]]s in his search for greater magical knowledge. The illithids in particular taught him to escape the bounds of the corporeal and of the mortal.

Sometime in the mid-to-late 1200s [[DR]], Jack had made some undetailed slight against Lady [[Alustriel]] of [[Silverymoon]], which instilled a deep fear in the often-arrogant gnome.

During the war started by [[Obould]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, after spotting the Lady of Silverymoon, he pleaded with his host to flee, claiming that she would recognize him and use all her might to destroy him.

Jack the Gnome was slain by [[Drizzt Do'Urden]].

==Activities==
Apparently, Jack was highly skilled at shape-changing. He often took the form of a winged snake to carry on his mischief and manipulations of the shamans of the half-[[orc]], half-[[ogre]] tribe [[Clan Karuck]], who resided beneath the [[Spine of the World]] in the upper reaches of the Underdark.

==Possessions==
Jack's [[enchanted]] [[silk]] wizard [[robe]] was a magical robe that couldn't be soiled or dirtied in any way. It was taken from Jack's corpse by Drizzt as loot and given to [[Catti-brie]].{{cite book/The Orc King/MMP|384}}
