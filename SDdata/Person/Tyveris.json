        "mainbody": "Tyveris was a loremaster of Oghma in the 14 century DR. He was also part of the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon.\nHis skin was a dark coppery color, he had black eyes and used a pair of gold wire spectacles. He had a low booming voice, he stood 6 feet tall and took considerably more space than Caledan. He had monumental shoulders, thickly muscled arms and chest, and wore a brown robe.\nTyveris was calm and gentle.\nHe could cast some spells.\nTyveris was originally from Chult. Merchants from Waterdeep came to Chult often hired young Tabaxi who would come with them and become mercenaries. He and his sister, Tali, went with a group of merchants and left Chult behind. Half the Tabaxi hired by the merchants died of sickness on the voyage to the Sword Coast, including Tyveriss sister. Tyveris vowed to take up the sword and become the greatest warrior and make his sister proud.\nTyveris and the other Chultans were enslaved by a Calimshite wizard for many years. The Harpers—and Caledan Caldorien—managed to free them from the wizard. That was when he joined the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon.\nAfter the Fellowship disbanded, Tyveris found that he was following the ideals of Caledan, he realized that he did not enjoy killing, he needed to find his own purpose, and gave up the sword in 1357 DR. That is when he found the Abbey of Everard. The Loremasters of Oghma allowed Tyveris to work for them. Abbess Melisende taught him how to read. In 1358 DR he joined the order and became a loremaster.\nAfter freeing Iriaebor of Ravendass rule in 1363 DR, Tyveris worked as an advisor to Lord Bron in reestablishing the city."
