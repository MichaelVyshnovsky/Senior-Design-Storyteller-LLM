        "mainbody": "Bandik was the villagemaster of the guilders in the Garden of the Cursed. He was bamboozled by the charlatan Trifakas, thus leading the guilders to do his bidding.\nWhen the adventurers who carried the Star Gems of Martek arrived at the Garden of the Cursed, they may have accepted Pawnis invitation to the guilders village. If so, Bandik may arrived shortly after, instructed by Trifakas to find out if they carried the Star Gems. He or the guilders may have attempted to steal these gems if so, Bandik may have been the one to explain the guilder religion to the adventurers.\nBandik may have been told to acquire the Star Gems by Trifakas. If so, he may have done anything he had to do to acquire them. He may have remained loyal to Trifakas, unless he came to believe the wizard violated one of the guilders sacred laws."
