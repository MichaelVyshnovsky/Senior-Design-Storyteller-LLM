        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Teclel was known as an extraordinarily indulgent man who created tailored clothes of the same luxurious quality. Despite his skill, Teclel's love for lavish lifestyle prohibited him from opening his own business. Instead of running a shop, Teclel offered his services to protectors and adventurers from Neverwinter."
