Zima al-Hatik was a sage who lived in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Zima was a cranky old man.
Zima was the proprietor of a rare book shop. Though he only made one appointment per night, he would meet with anyone at anytime if they had a rare book to sell.
He charged 10 dinar for an appointment. The steep price helped eliminate foolish customers wasting his precious time.
Zima owned a pair of magical spectacles that he acquired from a Lantan merchant. The spectacles allowed him to glance at any page of a book and instantly commit it to memory. These wondrous spectacles gave Zima a degree of specialization in a huge variety of sage topics.
