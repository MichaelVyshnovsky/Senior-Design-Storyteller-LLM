'''Draac Xorlarrin''' was a member of [[House Xorlarrin]] and an ally of the [[fire giant]] Duke [[Zalto]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
Once Draac lived in [[Q'Xorlarrin]].

In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], House Xorlarrin allied with the leader of the fire giants, Duke Zalto. Under Zalto's orders, Draac, together with his younger cousin [[Taal Xorlarrin]], led an expedition back to [[Gauntlgrym]] using secret tunnels in order to capture the [[primordial]] [[Maegera]] inside an [[iron flask]] and deliver it to Zalto in his fortress of [[Ironslag]].

==Personality==
Draac was a slippery individual. He did not want to die under any circumstance.
