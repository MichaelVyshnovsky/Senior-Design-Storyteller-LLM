Draac Xorlarrin was a member of House Xorlarrin and an ally of the fire giant Duke Zalto sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Once Draac lived in QXorlarrin.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, House Xorlarrin allied with the leader of the fire giants, Duke Zalto. Under Zaltos orders, Draac, together with his younger cousin Taal Xorlarrin, led an expedition back to Gauntlgrym using secret tunnels in order to capture the primordial Maegera inside an iron flask and deliver it to Zalto in his fortress of Ironslag.
Draac was a slippery individual. He did not want to die under any circumstance.
