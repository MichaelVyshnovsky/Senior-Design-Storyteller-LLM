'''Brinshaar''' was a [[human]] [[magic-user]] that lived in [[Neverwinter]].

==Description==
The [[mage]] had medium-length brown hair, deep green eyes, and wore a purple and gold [[scarf (clothing)|scarf]], as well as a green [[robe]]. He also wore several pieces of [[jewelry]]. Brinshaar was versed in fighting with [[dart]]s, as well as a [[quarterstaff]], and was very tough and robust for a mage.

==Personality==
The man seemed friendly, and considered himself an expert magic-user, but had bold intentions.

==History==
[[File:PrisonerLuskan.png|thumb|right|''Brinshaar as a prisoner.'']]
''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], Brinshaar made his way into the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] to steal a [[magic]] statuette. However, he was captured and tortured, and he claimed the Host Tower mages tried to use him to get information out about Lord [[Nasher]]'s [[magic]]al defenses. His captors chained him to a wall and instructed [[owlbear]]s to maim him. The [[Heroes of Ascore]]-to-be made their way to the tower, saved him from the pack of owlbears, and Brinshaar offered to join with the heroes, as well as giving them information on the statuettes they most desired.

Once they had made it out of the tower, the heroes were turned on by the seemingly friendly Brinshaar. He controlled a foursome of [[displacer beast]]s to try and wrestle back the statuette. However, the traitor was defeated by the heroes, and they kept their hold on the artifact.
