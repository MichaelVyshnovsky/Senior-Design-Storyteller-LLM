        "mainbody": "undro Rockseeker was a dwarf explorer in the late 15 century DR. He was the youngest of the three dwarf brothers who rediscovered Wave Echo Cave.\nNundro and his brothers planned to re-open the lost mine near Phandalin.\nAfter finding its location, the dwarf was captured by Nezznar circa 1491 DR, and thrown in a jail cell in Wave Echo Cave. Nezznar believed that the dwarf knew more information than he initially led on, so spared him. He was interrogated by his drow captor a couple of times per day. After his capture, a doppelganger would assume his form to add leverage to the demands of Nezznar.\nNundro was later freed, and together with Gundren Rockseeker, ran the mining operations at the cave.\nHe was the younger brother of both Tharden Rockseeker and Gundren Rockseeker."
