'''Mordant Decruew''' was an officer in the [[Zhentilar]] and one of the most-veteran soldiers that served under [[Ronglath Knightsbridge]] for a period during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Our enemies will not expect us to move against the forest until the morning. They will not expect us in [[Shadowdale]] until late the following day. We will take them by surprise.}}

==History==
Mordant rode alongside Commander Knightsbridge in the march through the [[Dalelands]] leading up to the [[Second battle of Shadowdale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. His confident and calm demeanor helped settle the nerves of some of Knightsbridge's other, less-experienced soldiers.
