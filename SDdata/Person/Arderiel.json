He was a devoted follower of his goddess, a talented fighter, and a capable mage.\nThe half-elf champion was armed with a long sword and a composite longbow. He was protected by an elfin chain and a helmet.\nArderiel was a trusted companion of Kallithrea Starbrow, a daughter of the Roadwarden Arelin Starbrow.\nIn the early 1360s DR, when Arderiel was 27 winters old, Arelin Starbrow perished in a treacherous monster ambush on the High Road. Her set of enchanted arms â€“ the symbol of the office, were lost to the monsters. Subsequently, Kallithrea Starbrow was tasked by her father in the recovery of the Shield of the Roadwarden in her stead, Kallithrea sent Arderiel, who was to join a group of caravan guards in the arms recovery.\nThe search of the Shield of the Roadwarden led the group to an ogre cave village in the Storm Horns. Arderiel witnessed image of Arelin Starbrow in a crystal ball, alive and well, and he immediately rushed to what he thought was the Roadwarden. The woman he found looked like the hero but in reality was just a trick of the mastermind behind the ogre and ogre magi alliance, a fiendish rakshasa who claimed the Shield of the Roadwarden. A second rakshasa joined the fray, but both were slain by the adventurers who claimed the enchanted item and returned it to Kallithrea Starbrow."
