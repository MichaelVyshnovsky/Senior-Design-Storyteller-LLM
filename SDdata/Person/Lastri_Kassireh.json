        "mainbody": "'''Lastri Kassireh''' was the Captain of the ship call the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''She is one of the few foreign captains allowed to land in the port of [[Samargol]]. She is of [[hin]] blood, and has a temper shorter than her height – but she is capable, or can at least summon the illusion of being such.''|[[Sa'Sani]]}}",
        "Description": "Lastri was a [[lightfoot halfling]] with short dark hair. She had a martial bearing and piercing stare that easily betrayed her commanding position.",
        "Personality": "Captain Kassireh had a cheerful and boisterous personality.",
        "Possessions": "Lastri was a lucky and nimble [[swashbuckler]] who wielded her [[enchanted]] ''[[Lastri's short rapier|rapier]]'' in battle and wore a set of magic ''[[Lastri's leather armor|leathers]]''.",
        "History": "In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, Captain Kassireh and the ''Vigilant'' sailed from the [[Sword Coast]] to the [[Chult]]an nation of [[Samarach]].  Onboard the ship were several passengers, including [[Volothamp Geddarm]] who traveled to meet with a wealthy [[yuan-ti]] merchant [[Sa'Sani]]. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled, freshwater barrels – ruptured, one of the crew – [[Kellen (sailor)|Kellen]] got drunk and drowned, Volo almost got poisoned, new ropes became frayed.\n\nClose to the shores of Samarach, the ship's ill luck culminated in a storm that destroyed the ''Vigilant'', tossing the broken vessel to the shores. Several members of Lastri's crew died in the shipwreck; however, the captain herself, along with the first mate [[Kadjin]], were captured by a gang of hungry [[Batiri]] [[goblin]]s.\n\nWith her livelihood gone and reputation tarnished, Lastri Kassireh abandoned her career as a captain and dedicated herself to finding what turned out to be a saboteur from the [[Cult of Zehir]]. She joined her fellow survivors, now Sa'Sani's hirelings in untangling the yuan-ti plot. During their adventures, Lastri angered her goddess and realized that her future laid in being a sellsword, and not venturing into the Bath Queen's domain."
