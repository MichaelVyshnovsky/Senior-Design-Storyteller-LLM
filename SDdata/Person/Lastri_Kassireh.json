She had a martial bearing and piercing stare that easily betrayed her commanding position.\nCaptain Kassireh had a cheerful and boisterous personality.\nLastri was a lucky and nimble swashbuckler who wielded her enchanted rapier in battle and wore a set of magic leathers.\nIn the , Captain Kassireh and the Vigilant sailed from the Sword Coast to the Chultan nation of Samarach.  Onboard the ship were several passengers, including Volothamp Geddarm who traveled to meet with a wealthy yuan-ti merchant SaSani. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled, freshwater barrels – ruptured, one of the crew – Kellen got drunk and drowned, Volo almost got poisoned, new ropes became frayed.\nClose to the shores of Samarach, the ships ill luck culminated in a storm that destroyed the Vigilant, tossing the broken vessel to the shores. Several members of Lastris crew died in the shipwreck however, the captain herself, along with the first mate Kadjin, were captured by a gang of hungry Batiri goblins.\nWith her livelihood gone and reputation tarnished, Lastri Kassireh abandoned her career as a captain and dedicated herself to finding what turned out to be a saboteur from the Cult of Zehir. She joined her fellow survivors, now SaSanis hirelings in untangling the yuan-ti plot. During their adventures, Lastri angered her goddess and realized that her future laid in being a sellsword, and not venturing into the Bath Queens domain."
