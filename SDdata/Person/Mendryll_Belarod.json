        "mainbody": "'''Mendryll Belarod''' was a young [[Half-elf|half-elven]] [[bard]] who traveled [[Faer√ªn]] widely in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], getting into misadventures and writing accounts of the people and places he encountered.",
        "Description": "Mendryll had long blonde hair and green eyes. He wore a perpetual smirk.",
        "Personality": "He was a gregarious and charming person, and got increasingly cocky and bold with the opportunity to show off. He was very flirtatious with women when given the chance.\n\nHe claimed to find [[Cormyr]] boring and limiting due to its stable and lawful nature, though it didn't stop him from enjoying himself there.",
        "Abilities": "{{Quote|For your entertainment I shall play a selection of songs that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and tremble in your seats. Naturally, accomplished bard that I am, I also take requests.|''Mendryll Belarod''}}\n\nDespite appearing a dandyish wastrel, he was a proficient swordsman and was perfectly capable of protecting himself.\n\nHis bardic abilities tended towards the defensive and utilitarian, to better assist his travels and keep himself alive.\n\nHe possessed the mundane yet specialized talents of being able to belch the Cormyrean Royal Anthem and impersonate famous people such as [[Elminster]] and [[Piergeiron Paladinson]].",
        "Possessions": "As a frequent traveler who found or made trouble wherever he went, Mendryll was well-prepared for dangerous situations. To keep himself alive, he used ''[[bracers of defense]]'', a powerful ''[[ring of protection]]'', a ''[[flame tongue]]'' [[longsword]], and a ''[[harp of charming]]''. He also had a ''[[Bucknard's everfull purse]]'', a regular [[harp]], and a [[riding horse]].",
        "History": "In [[1367 DR]], he wrote a travelogue detailing his exploration of the [[Moonsea]], repeatedly getting into trouble as he explored each city. He earned a potential enemy in [[Thentia]] when he unintentionally ruined the [[elf|elven]] maiden [[Elaesse Loridiel]]'s relationship with her [[unicorn]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, he appeared at King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|Azoun IV]]'s birthday party at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]] with, providing music and entertainment for the event. In the process of singing a shockingly song about two [[Sembite]]s, a [[dryad]], and a [[harpy]], he terribly offended a group of Sembite adventurers, the [[Stag Runners]], who ambushed him later that night.\n\nLater that year, he found himself in the [[Stonelands]] pursuing rumors involving the ''[[Four from Cormyr (item set)|Four from Cormyr]]'', [[Tower of Ruin]], and the [[Starburst Swords]]. Hoping to get some new tales out of it, he pointed a group of adventurers towards the likely locations with the promise of fabulous treasure. He then realised the scale and danger of the adventure he had just prompted, and brought along [[Rhyn Mournsoul]], who sought a tragic and hopefully painless death. Meeting the adventurers at the ruins of [[Darkenshield]], he fought alongside them against Lord [[Vorik Aris]]'s small army."
