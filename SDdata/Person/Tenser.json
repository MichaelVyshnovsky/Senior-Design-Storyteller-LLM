        "mainbody": "Tenser () was a legendary mage from Oerth who was known in the Realms, particularly for his spells.\nTenser was a notable wizard who made his mark upon the Realms, alongside Bigby, Elminster, the Simbul, Mordenkainen, and Khelben. and Tensers floating disk.\nSome of the many magical items possessed by Tenser included an amulet of proof against detection and location, a cloak of displacement, some dust of disappearance, a pearl of the sirines, a ring of human influence, a ring of protection +3, a ring of fire resistance, a staff of the magi, a staff of striking, a staff of thunder and lightning, and a wand of enemy detection.\nTenser wore a distinctive outfit when he was admitted into the Circle of Eight, part of which included the cloak of the Weave.\nTenser wore the enchanted item called the Hood of the Weave during the ceremony of being inducted into the Circle of Eight on the world of Oerth. The hood would eventually find its way to Toril, but following the ceremony, during the celebration, the fellow members of the Circle, Otiluke and Bigby pranked Tenser. However, thanks to the hood, they found their vodka glasses ensorcelled with a spell that transformed their earlobes into sassy pixies.\nDuring a heated spellcasting contest, Robillard and Harkle Harpell discussed Tenser. Harkle asked the pirate mage if he knew of Tenser, and Robillard answered that he did, describing Tenser as \"crazy\". Robillard pondered the implications of Harkles question, assuming that he would transform into a raging warrior as per Tensers transformation. After yelling \"Not the Tenser!\", Robillard rushed Harkle in a tackle before he could transform."
