        "History": "{{Quote\n|I could have done that with much more flair.\n|Robillard\n}}\n{{Quote\n|So could Tenser.\n|Harkle Harpell\n}}\n\nTenser wore the [[enchanted]] item called the ''[[Hood of the Weave]]'' during the ceremony of being inducted into the [[Circle of Eight]] on the world of Oerth. The hood would eventually find its way to Toril, but following the ceremony, during the celebration, the fellow members of the Circle, Otiluke and Bigby pranked Tenser. However, thanks to the hood, they found their [[vodka]] glasses ensorcelled with a spell that transformed their earlobes into sassy [[pixie]]s.\n\nDuring a heated spellcasting contest, [[Robillard]] and [[Harkle Harpell]] discussed Tenser. Harkle asked the pirate mage if he knew of Tenser, and Robillard answered that he did, describing Tenser as \"crazy\". Robillard pondered the implications of Harkle's question, assuming that he would transform into a raging warrior as per ''Tenser's transformation''. After yelling \"Not the Tenser!\", Robillard rushed Harkle in a tackle before he could transform."
