'''Slarkrethel''' was a huge [[kraken]] [[wizard]] and [[Chosen]] of [[Umberlee]], who also founded the [[Kraken Society]].

==Description==
Like his origins, Slarkrethel's appearance was disputed. The majority of sages described him as a giant squid, indeed, the giant squid was the symbol of the Kraken Society, however, later images of krakens were described as far less squid-like, with fins as well as tentacles, and recognizable faces.<ref> On one aspect, all could agree however, Slarkrethel was a leviathan of a creature, gargantuan in size.<ref><ref>

==Abilities==
As well as his immense size and strength, Slarkrethel was also a wizard of prodigious ability, easily the equal of the most powerful mortal archmages. As a Chosen of Umberlee, Slarkrethel was protected from [[divination]] magic and [[psionic]] powers of detection, as well as a magical effect similar to the spell [[Elminster's evasion]] and many more abilities besides.

==Possessions==
Slarkrethel was in possession of a multitude of magical items, many of them tailor made just for his personal use that duplicated magical effects usually found only in items designed for use on land.

==Activities==
Slarkrethel's ultimate goal was apotheosis, and he worked tirelessly to achieve divinity. However, he also ruled an enormous undersea kingdom in the northern [[Trackless Sea]].

Wherever he traveled, he was accompanied by a retinue of bodyguards consisting of [[wereshark]]s; [[nereid]]s; [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]]; [[Kapoacinth]]; [[Shark#Huge Sharks|dire sharks]]; four ''[[Charm monster|charmed]]'' [[Killer whale|orcas]]; and an [[eye of the deep]]. He was also attended to by a variety of ''charmed'' servants. Slarkrethel did not value the lives of his attendant creatures, and thought nothing of sending them to their deaths.

==Relationships==
Apart from his goddess, Slarkrethel only seemed to trust the lieutenants to whom he delegated the leadership of the Kraken Society. As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, these were [[Vestress|The Regent of Ascarle]]; [[Skum Lord|The Skum Lord]]; High Captain [[Rethnor]] of [[Luskan]]; [[Semmonemily]], a [[doppelganger]] posing as the head of the [[Hand of Yartar]] thieves guild; [[Selger|King Selger]] of the [[Purple Rocks]]; and Dread High Trident [[Meritid Archneie]], an ambitious [[Church of Umberlee|Umberlant]] priest.<ref>

==History==
Slarkrethel's origins are disputed. Some say the kraken was born in the {{YearlinkName|151}}. It wasn't until Slarkrethel found the submerged ruins of [[Ascarle]] in [[244 DR]] that he began building his undersea empire. There, he was inspired by legends of his ancestors' past, and his studies left him aspiring to godhood and to regain some of his race's former glory. Centuries later, he had extended his tentacles all over the [[Trackless Sea]], and created the web of informants and spies called the Kraken Society.

Others claim that Slarkrethel is ancient beyond reckoning. For tens of thousands of years the kraken has been searching tirelessly for long-lost paths to divine ascendancy, longing to rejoin its creators in the heavens. They say he was old when the giants and dragons waged war forty thousands years before the events of shattering of the giant Ordning. Slarkrethel lured exiles, outcasts, and lost souls to its organization with the promise of a better life. Ancient humans of the Purple Rocks would cast their young into the sea as part of a ritual to appease and worship Slarkrethel. Those offspring would resurface and return as adults with piscine deformities. At the end of their natural life span they would return to their fearsome master.

In the {{YearlinkName|834}}, Slarkrethel battled with [[Laeral Silverhand]] at [[Port Llast]] and managed to steal the [[Soaring Throne of the Witch Queen|magical throne]] of [[Stornanter]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/351/Volo's Guide: Lost Regalia of the North: The Toppled Thrones|75}}

Umberlee forsaw the return of her former lover [[Iakhovas]] in the near future, and so adopted Slarkrethel as her Chosen in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}.

Late in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Slarkrethel was credited with the destruction of the ''The Maiden's Defiance'', a [[galley]] hired by the [[Harpers]] to investigate Ascarle.<ref>

Some time after the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[dragon]] [[Iymrith]] contacted agents of the society for aid. Slarkrethel ordered its followers to go along with the dragon's plans, by slaying the [[storm giant]] Queen [[Neri]] and capturing King [[Hekaton]].
