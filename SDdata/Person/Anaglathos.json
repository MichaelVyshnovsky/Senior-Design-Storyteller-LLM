As a Lord of Turmish, he was a ruthless leader who charmed, intimidated, and destroyed all who stood against him. Like many other dragons, Anaglathos was an avaricious individual who claimed and hoarded the wealth of his kingdom.\nThe dragon Baurthaglos, also known as Anglaspark, was a child of Anaglathos. He laired in the Orsraun Mountains but didnt seem to have the same aspirations of rulership as his father.\nLord Sjorn Sendreth of Turmish drained his nations treasury in a fruitless War of 1220 against the dwarves of Ironfang and to replenish it, a call for adventurers and treasure hunters was put out. Turmish-sponsored treasure hunting parties were sent into the Orsraun Mountains, where Anaglathos, an ancient blue dragon, hid his hoard. In the ,The beginning of Anaglathoss rule as well as his arrival in Turmish sometimes is said to be in the appropriately named . This date is shown in Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition and Sea of Fallen Stars (sourcebook). However, 1242 DR is stated in The Vilhon Reach—the sourcebook dedicated to the region—and reinforced in the The Grand History of the Realms and other sources, and supported by the six-year rule mentioned in Dragons of Faerûn. Taken together, it may be that Anaglathos arrived in 1242 DR and formally assumed power in 1243 DR. the adventuring Company of the Sabred Tooth was guided through the mountainous perils by a local ranger Forier and his trusted animal companion, a wolf named Emerald. The band uncovered Anaglathoss lair and swiftly started collecting the treasures. Anaglathos remained out of sight, and despite his first instinct to unleash his deadly lightning breath on the intruders, he decided to use trickery. The wyrm slew Emerald and took its shape, accompanying happy adventurers back to Alaghôn and magically charming the Company of the Sabred Tooth. As they passed through Turmishan settlements, the dragon used magic to enthrall leaders and his draconic might to scare folk into submission.\nThe treasure-hunting troupe was granted an immediate audience with Lord Sendreth due to the immense wealth procured. Without wasting time, Anaglathos revealed his true form and swiftly disposed of the Lord of Turmish, claiming the title. This was how the Reign of the Wyrm began. Anaglathoss rule was characterized by swift deaths of any who opposed the new lord and collection of most of the nations treasures in the dragons hoard in Alaghôn. Lacking interest in commerce, trade rapidly declined in Turmish, leaving very little mercantile activities in the nation. And Turmishans were nothing but meals and playthings for the cruel despot. During his rule, Anaglathos lent dungeons of the palace to a lich-queen of Unther. The undead guest ended up outliving the blue-scaled tyrant.\nThe Reign of the Wyrm was cut short in the . A rebellion rose against the Anaglathos, and many members of the said rebellion were roasted on a stake. However, that act did not scare the rebels away and instead instigated the Night of Redemption. During that hot summer night that helmed the changing season, paladin Corwin Freas led a band of adventurers to face the blue dragon. Corwin and his bad emerged victorious, and Anaglathos met his demise. The grateful folk of Turmish crowned Lord Corwin Freas as the new ruler. His right was very short-lived, ending a year later, in , with the abolition of monarchy and establishment of the Assembly of Stars.\n*Anaglathoss reign became a learning experience for the dragons aspiring to rule. Aurgloroasa was cautioned by Anaglathoss failure from openly seizing Westgate by force, electing to scheme from the shadows."
