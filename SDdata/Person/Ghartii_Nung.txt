'''Ghartii Nung''' was a monstrous [[eel]] that dwelt in the [[Yellow Sea]] off the coast of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. It was reported to be 100 feet (30 meters) long.

The mighty eel was caught by the famous Koryoan fishermen of [[In'ani]] and [[Ansong]].<ref group="note">It is not clear whether the fishermen responsible came from In'ani or Ansong, or both settlements.
