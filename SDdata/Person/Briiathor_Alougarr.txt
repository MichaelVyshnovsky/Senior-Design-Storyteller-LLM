Briiathor Alougarr was the Lord Warder of Amphail and an unofficial member of Waterdeeps City Guard, though he was officially retired from that post.
Briiathor was completely loyal to Piergeiron the Paladinson. A man who disliked ceremony, Briiathor spoke quietly yet kept an eye on everything and regularly patrolled Amphail on foot at all hours of the day.
Briiathor had grey eyes and a closely trimmed beard.
Briiathor was an old battle-companion of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun. He knew Arunsun when they adventured in the Wheel of Blades adventuring company.
