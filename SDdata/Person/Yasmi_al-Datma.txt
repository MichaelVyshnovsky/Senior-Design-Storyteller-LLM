Yasmi al-Datma was one of many wives of the Grand Caliph Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir in Huzuz.
Yasmi was a slim, elven woman with wide, sky blue eyes.
Yasmi was quiet but intelligent.
She possessed skills in sorcery and had the ability to play the dulcimer.
When Khalil was occupied at night with his other wives, Yasmi and Tanya would often escape the palace by using Tanyas teleport spell.
Yasmi was married to the Grand Caliph in 1362 DR. Yasmi was quickly befriended by Tanya bint Perijan who realized the importance of having a sorcerer in the harem.
Before she married the Grand Caliph, Yasmi was a respected member of the Grand Viziers palace security force.
