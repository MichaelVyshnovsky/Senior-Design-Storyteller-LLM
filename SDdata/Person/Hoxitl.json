        "History": "In [[1361 DR]], under the orders of the [[Ancient Ones]], he ordered all his priests to find the young girl [[Erixitl]].\n\nWith the arrival of the [[Golden Legion]] in Nexal, Hoxitl conspired with the Ancient Ones in order to have Naltecona put to death and the Viperhands cult take control of the empire. Hoxitl continued to hunt for Erixitl, also obtaining the reluctant help of [[Shatil]], brother of Erixitl and a priest of Zaltec.\n\nThe vengeance of [[Lolth]] against the Ancient Ones, who were actually a group of [[drow]], ruined his plans. He was transformed into a [[troll]] duing the [[Night of Wailing]].\n\nDespite his transformation, Hoxitl remained a servant of Zaltec, albeit a reluctant one, and unleashed the Viperhands monsters upon the [[human]] survivors. In time, the transformation started to afflict his mind as well and Hoxitl became more and more bestial. He led the Viperhands armies in the Second Battle of [[Ulatos]] until, with the banishment of the avatar of Zaltec, all the monsters lost their will for battle and retreated to Nexal.\n\nAs of [[1362 DR]], Hoxitl still ruled the ruins of Nexal."
