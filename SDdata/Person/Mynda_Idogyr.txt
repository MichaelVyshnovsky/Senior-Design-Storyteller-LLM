'''Lady Mynda Idogyr''' was the wife of Lord [[Gamalon Idogyr]], the Count of [[Spellshire]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Activities==
Because Gamalon was often busy at [[Faerntarn]], the royal palace of [[Tethyr]], Mynda controlled much of the administration of Spellshire.

==Relationships==
Mynda met her future husband on her home on the [[Rock of Bral]] in the [[Tears of Selûne]], where she had grown up as a merchant's daughter. She ignored Gamalon for four years and thought he was odd-looking and boyish in appearance. Eventually, she warmed to his advances, and the two were happily married for 30 years and had a daughter named Lara.

Mynda had served as hostess on some of [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]] and his scribe [[Haedrak Rhindaun III|Lhaeo's]] visits to Bral, when she had lived there. She appreciated that he brought her gifts such as [[Calishite]] [[spices]], but she despised his pipe-smoking habit. Her daughter, Lara enjoyed listening to Lhaeo's many stories.

==History==
When the family moved to [[Toril]] to the lands of Gamalon's family, she had trouble adapting to the weather and the court intrigue in [[Faerûn]]. She did, however, enjoy her new courtly title and the benefits in livelihood that had come with that.

She was killed on [[Uktar 28]], [[1374 DR]], along with several others,
