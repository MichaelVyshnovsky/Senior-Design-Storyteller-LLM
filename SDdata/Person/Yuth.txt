==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Lady Yuth could be found selling her curios and [[enchanted]] wares at the [[Adventurer Mart]] in Athkatla's grand [[Waukeen's Promenade]]. Lady Yuth talked to customers whom she noticed searching for very specific merchandise, dealing in her schools from behind a bookshelf, away from prying eyes. She held little respect for the [[Cowled Wizards]] and thought them to be corrupt fools, like every other person in the position of power in Athkatla.
