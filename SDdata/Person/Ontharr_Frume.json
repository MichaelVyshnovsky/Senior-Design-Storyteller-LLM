        "mainbody": "Ontharr Frume was a paladin of the Order of the Gauntlet and their main delegate at the Council of Waterdeep.\nOntharr was boisterous and gregarious to a fault. His dedication to heroic justice created a connection with Sir Isteval however, Ontharr had difficulties linking the Isteval of legend to the real man in front of him.\nOntharr was one of the first to get involved in the Tyranny of Dragons issue. As a friend of Leosin Erlanthar, he provided support to the adventuring party that Leosin befriended in Greenest in their search for the Hoard of the Dragon Queen.\nWhen the threat of Severin Silrajins reformed Cult of the Dragon became a global one, Ontharr was chosen as the leading delegate at the Council of Waterdeep. Having met them before, he trusted the adventurers recruited to fight the Cult but had to balance his personal convictions with the will of his Order."
