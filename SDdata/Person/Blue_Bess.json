        "mainbody": "'''Blue Bess''' was a female miniature [[behir]] used for breeding at the [[Behir's Nest]] shop in [[Khaerbaal]] ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Blue Bess was considered a good breeding stock. In the spring of that year, she produced a new brood of three from mating with another miniature behir named [[Ethan]], under the watchful eye of [[artificer]] [[Justin]], the proprietor of the Behir's Nest. Blue Bess's spawn were kept in a series of shallow pools within the shop where the young creatures were groomed, fed with chopped-up [[fish]] and [[eel]]s, and allowed to lounge on sunning rocks until purchased. All three of Blue Bess's brood had only six legs, owing to their young age, and [[topaz]]-blue scales, which was a color popular among the mages of Khaerbaal.\n\nThe hero of the [[Battle of Akhlaur's Swamp]], [[Tzigone]], briefly worked at Behir's Nest, taking care of Blue Bess's brood in the spring of 1370 DR."
