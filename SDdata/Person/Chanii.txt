'''Chanii''' was a [[ch'i-lin]] member of the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]].

==Activities==
Chanii was one of the officers of the [[Qui sub-committee]] that governed the affairs of the animal population of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] under orders of the [[Ministry of Animal Affairs]] of the Celestial Bureaucracy.
Chanii oversaw the hairy animals. She ruled Qui during the [[Season of the Unicorn]]. She governed directing 30 baboons and 10 giant badgers, of which 10 baboons were always on patrol. She acted friendly with intruders at first.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], she summoned the [[General Tiger]] in order to expel [[Osari Minhiro]] and an adventuring party he had hired from Qui. He easily sent them into unconsciousness but insulted Chanii for asking for his help.
