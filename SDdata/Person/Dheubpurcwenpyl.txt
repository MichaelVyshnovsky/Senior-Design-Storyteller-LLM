'''Dheubpurcwenpyl''' was one of the most powerful [[deep dragon]]s in the [[Underdark]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Lair==
Her lair was in the [[Rift of Dhalnadar]], a great chasm south of the [[Marching Mountains]], famous for waterfalls and jungles. It lay at the center of [[Alatorin]] in [[Deep Shanatar]], and Dheubpurcwenpyl had in her hoard most of the lost treasures of [[Old Shanatar]].

==Reputation==
''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], she did not tolerate any challenges to her authority. Even the neighboring [[drow]] of [[Guallidurth]] had to go around her domain and revered her as ''Malla Harl Valsharess'', or "Honored Queen of the Depths". However, she shared the Rift of Dhalnadar with [[cloaker]]s and competed with them for prey, but any struggle between them would result in a pyrrhic victory at best, so they kept a delicate peace by [[1372 DR]].

Many mistook Dheubpurcwenpyl for a [[shadow dragon]], leading some scholars of draconic topics to believe that she knew a spell called ''[[shadow dragon (spell)|shadow dragon]]'' that transformed herself into a shadow being composed of [[shadowstuff]].
