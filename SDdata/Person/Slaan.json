        "mainbody": "'''Slaan''' was a [[lizardfolk]] [[barbarian]] of the [[Mere of Dead Men]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who encountered the [[Kalach-Cha]] near [[Highcliff Castle]] in the 1370s [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Slaan was built similarly to other lizardfolk in his tribe. He wore [[leather]] armor.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, while ''en route'' to sabotage ships in [[Highcliff]], Slaan and his forces were attacked by [[undead]] from Highcliff Castle. After his troops fled deeper into the castle, Slaan was left fighting the undead alone. While fighting, Slaan encountered the Kalach-Cha, who helped fight off the undead. There are three possibilities when it comes to his later fate. Either the Kalach-Cha killed him and looted his body for a [[map]] to the lizardfolk cave where the attacks on ships were planned or, in exchange for helping his soldiers, Slaan led the Kalach-Cha to his chieftain for peace talks. It is also possible that Slaan was slain at the peace talks.",
        "Possessions": "Slaan possessed two [[short sword]]s, which he dual-wielded in combat.",
        "Activities": "Because their territory was threatened, the lizardfolk near Highcliff started attacking ships from the village to scare off the villagers. Slaan was participating in these activities."
