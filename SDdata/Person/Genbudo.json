        "mainbody": "Genbudo was one of the most powerful wu jen in Kozakura in 1357 DR.\nGenbudo was a very troubling wu jen residing in Chimotoge. Many nobles and samurai sought his talents from his house near the city. However, he received all visitors concealed by a screen, so nobody had seen his face since he arrived in Chimotoge around 1293 DR. \nRumors said that Genbudo was in truth the infamous Goboro the Lame, who disappeared during the 12th century DR in a magic duel."
