'''Herab''' was the Captain of a smuggling vessel called ''[[Barracuda (ship)|Barracuda]]'', a member of the [[Zhentarim]] and a member of [[Daggerford]]'s [[Shoreside Shipping Consortium]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Captain Herab was a stern and striking woman with red hair. She carried herself with confidence of a competent opponent.

==Possessions==
The woman wielded a unique [[enchanted]] [[Herab's shortsword|short sword]] and a ''+2'' magic [[dagger]] in battle, and protected herself with a set of unique [[Captain Herab's leather armor|leather armor]]. Herab had two potions ready â€“ a ''[[potion of death armor]]'' and a ''[[potion of cure critical wounds]]''.

Captain Herab had a massive and expensive [[oak]] desk on board his ship, often cluttered with empty bottles, ledgers, and stained notebooks. The ship's main ledger was a small black book bound in [[oil]]ed [[leather]], in which were kept all the details on the ship's illicit activities.

Also, in captain's quarters, Herab kept a handful of ''[[acid arrow (item)|acid arrow]]s'' and a set of [[enchanted]] [[leather armor]] called ''[[Fencer's Grace]]''.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Herab and her crew became involved in Zhentarim's plot to take over the city of Daggerford. The ''Barracuda'' traveled alongside the [[Sword Coast]] from the city to a hidden cove on the [[Crab's Claw Coast]]. Her ship carried smuggled arms and armor for a swelling [[orc]] and [[tanarukk]] horde, all part of the nefarious Zhent ploy. The horde paid him hefty amounts of gold and able-bodied slaves. Luckily, the [[Hero of Daggerford]] investigated suspicious activities of the [[Mariners' Alliance]] and discovered the suspicious shipping activities of Herab's. The Hero followed up on the clues and discovered an [[orc]] hideout in the [[Wild Pastures]] south Daggerford. From there, the adventurers followed the clues to a hidden pirate cove filled with smuggled goods, and recently captured slaves, including [[Jerick]], a shepherd with whom the Hero of Daggerford had dealings recently. Captain Herab faced the Hero of Daggerford in battle, aided by a massive tanarukk leader and a loyal [[beast of Xvim]]. Despite her battle prowess, Herab was no match for the Hero, and the pirate Zhen was killed in battle. Her death returned to the Hero, their kidnapped friend, [[Talarenne]], and eventually led to the city's being safe from the Black Network takeover.
