        "mainbody": "'''George''' was a mean-spirited talking [[raven]] who served [[Sememmon]] of [[Darkhold]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Pleasant? If you define \"pleasant\" as \"looking forward to plucking the eyes out of your corpse,\" yeah...''|George}}",
        "Description": "George was a pitch-black raven. His personality was abrasive and aggressive. The [[bird]]'s colorful tongue constantly threatened those around him with violence and eating their corpses. George was not threatened by [[cat]]s and boasted that he would eat a cat's heart from the inside if he ever were to be swallowed. He was afraid of [[falcon]]s, visibly becoming nervous at a mere mention of these birds of prey. George also considered them to be \"sneaks and cheats.\"",
        "History": "George's true nature remained a mystery. Some time before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the bird became bound to serve [[wizard]] Sememmon for a set period of time. However, the wizard did not wish to reveal the reasons for George's servitude but did clarify that the raven was not a [[familiar]]. Despite the bird's foul attitude and abrupt manner, George served his master and the master's cause well.\n\nIn 1372 DR, George accompanied Sememmon and two other agents loyal to him – [[Beowen]] and [[Miyandra]], to the area surrounding the city of [[Daggerford]] that became the target of a [[Zhentarim]] takeover plot. Sememmon took on the guise of a [[Harper]] agent named [[Teygan]] and camped in a cavern outside of the city. When a group of adventurers emerged acting against the Zhent plot, Sememmon seized the opportunity and approached the person who would later be known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. The \"Harper\" invited the Hero to his hideout and fed the Hero intel, resulting in ruining [[Fzoul Chembryl]]'s attempts to claim Daggerford. The Hero of Daggerford met George at the \"Harper\" hideout and was not amused by the bird's attitude, eventually threatening the raven with the Hero's brother – a falconer."
