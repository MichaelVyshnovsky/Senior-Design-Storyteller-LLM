        "mainbody": "Limbrar was a monk of Ilmater who served as one of leaders of the Knights of Imphras II as well as a member of the Lords of Imphras II during the 14 century DR.\nFor many years, Limbrar and his fellow lords Helimbraun and Oriseus formed a strong triumvirate, often agreeing and deciding upon what they felt was best for the nation.\nHowever, as Lord Helimbraun became more zealous and fervent in his quest to \"root out evil\" from Impiltur, especially after the coronation of King Imbrar II, Limbrar became the most outspoken opponent of his friend and colleague."
