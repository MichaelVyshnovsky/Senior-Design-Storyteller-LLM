        "daterefs": "In the ebook version of ''Temptation'', the Realmslore section declares the events of the first part to happen in around five years starting 759 DR. In the first chapter, Nuressa, the warrior, tells Elminster they're in early [[Mirtul]]. If it is assumed that the events happened in at most five and a half years, as more than five and a half years becomes around six years, then the last events in Part 1 must happen at most during [[Uktar]] of 764 DR. Given Feldrin's warning during the coronation that the Lords of Laothkund are already planning an attack, this timeline seems plausible. Further development may yet alter the result.",
        "mainbody": "'''Klandaerlas Glymril''' was a [[wizard]] and the Master of [[Glymril Gard]] during the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].",

        "Possessions": "He carried at least one ''[[wand]]'' and was the owner of [[Glymril Gard]], a tower he raised from a ruin with his own magic.",
        "History": "Klandaerlas Glymril had at some point raised his fortress, Glymril Gard, from the ruins of an earlier fortress by using magic. He had also gathered a number of wyverns he kept under ongoing spell-thrall.\n\nOne night late in the {{yearlinkName|764}}, Klandaerlas Glymril noticed an [[Saeraede Lyonora|enigmatic entity]] that was attracting the attention of his guards, and came out of his tower with a wand to threaten it. The creature hardened into the shape of a woman, and then swept through him; he died with a scream before turning into a pyre. The tower collapsed nigh-instantly upon his passing."
