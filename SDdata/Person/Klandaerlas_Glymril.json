        "mainbody": "Klandaerlas Glymril was a wizard and the Master of Glymril Gard during the midâ€“8 century DR.\nHe liked it when the scene out his window was tranquil.\nDuring the night of his death, he wore a black robe.\nHe could place wyverns in spell-thrall, and had the ability to raise towers from ruins, though this bound them to his lifeforce.\nTwo of his guards were Halglond and Curthas. He also kept numerous wyverns in spell-thrall, which he kept rather on the edge of starvation.\nHe carried at least one wand and was the owner of Glymril Gard, a tower he raised from a ruin with his own magic.\nKlandaerlas Glymril had at some point raised his fortress, Glymril Gard, from the ruins of an earlier fortress by using magic. He had also gathered a number of wyverns he kept under ongoing spell-thrall.\nOne night late in the , Klandaerlas Glymril noticed an enigmatic entity that was attracting the attention of his guards, and came out of his tower with a wand to threaten it. The creature hardened into the shape of a woman, and then swept through him he died with a scream before turning into a pyre. The tower collapsed nigh-instantly upon his passing."
