Together, the women adventured and and tried to stay out of trouble despite Kylei Shadowhand's love of pickpocketing. One fateful night, they came across a site of a [[goblin]] ambush in a forest outside [[Silverymoon]]. Three fellow adventurers [[S'feria Ranul]], [[Oagla'ta]], and [[Nyzeil Nighthammer]] were fighting for their lives, and the trio of women rushed to help. The group dispatched bandits with natural ease, battling in synch, S'feria became enamored with the new allies' battle prowess and convinced them to join her adventuring band - the [[Sisters of the Blood Moon]].\n\nIn 1310 DR, S'feria Ranul received a letter – a plea for help from the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. Despite the promise of [[gold]] and fame, S'feria led her Sisters to the northern city, answering its pleas for help."
