Instead of killing the gnolls, Rulak devised a plan to drive the band to Daggerdale. He later offered his services to Daggerdales leaders to eliminate the gnolls.\nRulak was assembled by the mayor of Dagger Falls with the constable and an adventuring party hired by Kendar Morn for a meeting to decide the best option for dealing with the gnolls."
