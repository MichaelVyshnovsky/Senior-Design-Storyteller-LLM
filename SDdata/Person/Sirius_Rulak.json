He later offered his services to Daggerdale's leaders to eliminate the gnolls.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Blades for Daggerdale|4}}\n\nRulak was assembled by the mayor of [[Dagger Falls]] with the constable and an adventuring party hired by [[Kendar Morn]] for a meeting to decide the best option for dealing with the gnolls."
