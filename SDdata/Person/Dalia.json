        "Description": "Dalia was a gruff and heavily drinking woman.",
        "History": "In 1372 DR, Dalia met a shady [[halfling]] [[rogue]] [[Burnas Tellrot]] who told her of the fabled hero of the ''[[Peredus the Great]]'' ballad. He offered the sailor a deal, she was to descent into the well where the hero was believed to have perished, in the [[Western Farmlands]] of [[Daggerford]]. She was promised the \"treasure o' the gods\" for the recovery of Peredus' [[enchanted]] blade. Unknowingly to her, Burnas sent Dalia to her death as the cavern under the well was the home of a young [[black dragon]] [[Sulfurus]]. Dalia managed to sneak past the evil wyrm and found a way out of the cave through a tunnel that lead into the [[Lizard Marsh]]. She fought her way through the savage [[lizardfolk]] who dwelt in the marsh, and eventually, reached safety of Daggerford. She was last seen gettin drunk at the [[Happy Cow]] tavern after paying Burnas Tellrot back for his betrayal."
