==Description==
Screaming Wind had yellow fur with black spots. Her eyes were green. Although she was young, she was wise and an accomplished hunter.

==Personality==
Screaming Wind only spoke when she had something of importance to say, and those who knew her also knew to listen when she spoke. She preferred to stay out of large groups.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|26}}

If attacked without someone to protect, she preferred to flee.{{Cite adventurers league/A Walk in the Park|5}}

==Activities==
Screaming Wind lived in a small house at the south end of [[Port Nyanzaru/Malar's Throat|Malar's Throat]] in Port Nyanzaru. She sought to protect the people of Malar's Throat from various dangers of the jungle, and fought alongside Port Nyanzaru's [[Citizens' Brigade]] to this end. She could often be found near [[Ubtao's Jaws]] providing food to hungry children.

She would task her allies in the Emerald Enclave with things like helping her to collect bile from undead dinosaurs, which she hoped could be used to make a cure for the [[disease]]s that such monsters spread,{{Cite adventurers league/Rotting Roots|22}} or retrieving the heart of a long-dead [[yuan-ti]] [[Yuan-ti abomination|abomination]] to likewise contribute to a project meant to save lives.{{Cite adventurers league/In Search of Secrets|16}}

She served as an important contact in Port Nyanzaru for members of the Emerald Encalve.{{Cite adventurers league/A Walk in the Park|3}} Her fellow Emerald Enclave agents in the city included [[Brittlebeard]]{{Cite adventurers league/Over the Edge|13}} and [[Qawasha]].

She occasionally cooperated with representatives from other factions within Port Nyanzaru, such as when several of them elected to hire the mercenary [[Pozzanna Lordeaux]] to secure a stronghold within the Chultan jungle,{{Cite adventurers league/Over the Edge|4}} when they rallied behind [[Hawkdriver Mazugulak]] to drive back an [[undead]] attack on the city,{{Cite adventurers league/Rotting Roots|3}} or when they came together under [[Alastar Bol]] to send agents to investigate undead forces stemming from the ruined city of [[Matolo]].{{Cite adventurers league/Putting the Dead to Rest|4}}

She had a [[tressym|flying cat]] named [[MowMow]], who served as her messenger.

}}
During the events of the [[death curse]] around {{Yearlink|1490}},{{ToA-time}} Screaming Wind found herself fighting [[pterafolk]] that appeared in Malar's Throat and kidnapped locals, stealing them away to a section of jungle that was blighted by the presence of a part of the ''[[Dreamer's Amulet]]'' given to a group of [[grung]]s. 

She subsequently began investigating the use of a [[drug]] known as [[Wanderlost]] that was being used to poison [[dinosaur]]s in Port Nyanzaru's dinosaur races, and traced the supplier to the [[Satchel Shop]] in Malar's Throat.{{Cite adventurers league/A Walk in the Park|4}}

When an [[elf]] named [[Xalph Brylar]] appeared in Port Nyanzaru seeking his long-lost daughter, [[Dalnira Brylar]], Screaming Wind sought to aid him as Dalnira had been an [[adventurer]] hired by the Emerald Enclave for a sensitive job at the time of her disappearance.{{Cite adventurers league/A Lesson in Love|4}}

When Port Nyanzaru came under attack by the [[fiend]]ish forces of [[Idrianne Smoke]], Screaming Wind came to fear that the [[Port Nyanzaru#Merchant Princes|Merchant Prince]] [[Ifan Talro'a]] had betrayed the city, and sought to investigate his secret office in [[Port Nyanzaru/Tiryki Anchorage|Tiryki Anchorage]].
