'''Welwyn Tracegar''' was a [[War Wizards|War Wizard]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was somewhat invasive with personal space, but meant no unpleasantness.

==Relationships==
He held a dim view of [[Surgol Velard]], a fellow [[War Wizard]], and seemed to consider [[Glathra Barcantle]] unreasonable.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|139-140|15}}

==Possessions==
He carried a ''[[wand of sleep]]'', and a ''[[potion of healing]]''.

==Activities==
He was a War Wizard of [[Cormyr]].

==History==
In the original date of the [[Council of the Dragon]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Welwyn was among the many War Wizards tapped by [[Glathra Barcantle]] to combat the spread of poison gas in the [[Castle Obarskyr/Hall of Justice|Hall of Justice]] of [[Castle Obarskyr]], which ultimately delayed the Council.

During the Council, Welwyn Tracegar was amongst those that went into the Hall from the west doors to try and stop the King, [[Foril Obarskyr I]], from being murdered. He later commented to [[Joreld Nurennanthur]], while heading towards Glathra Barcantle to debrief, that he counted [[Obraerl Foulweather]] and [[Briarbroke (Lord)|Lord Briarbroke]] as no great loss. In their way to moot with Glathra, they completely missed [[Amarune Whitewave]] running around palace, and dismissed [[Mirt]] doing the same thing as probably nothing.

Glathra later commanded Tracegar and Nurennanthur to capture [[Storm Silverhand]] and Amarune, which they failed at, Tracegar in particular by getting a discharge from his ''[[wand of sleep]]'' reflected at him; his ward nullified it, but he didn't do much afterwards.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|148-149|16}} When, much later, Silverhand, Delcastle, and Whitewave were finally captured, Glathra had Tracegar take responsibility for taking them to the dungeons. Once there, he tried to have the prisoners unchained, considering those unnecessary, but couldn't get the lionar to budge in procedure. While talking to Storm, she wrestled him despite being chained, and allowed the ashes of the fugitive [[wizard]] [[Elminster Aumar]] to get inside him, puppeteering the man.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|243-247|26}}

Puppeteered by Elminster, Tracegar healed the prisoners, and ushered them out of the cell at wandpoint,{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|254-255|27}} This was done with the later approval of [[Ganrahast]], who bade Glathra not investigate once she noticed Tracegar had not only lost the prisoners, but gone missing.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|262|28}} Elminster left his body shortly after for that of [[Reldyk Applecrown]], with the help of [[Arclath Delcastle]] and the former Royal Magician, [[Vangerdahast]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|267-268|28}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Storm Silverhand and Amarune later attempted to leave Palace by pretending to be Glathra Barcantle and Storm Silverhand in spell-spun disguises. It worked.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|159|17}}
