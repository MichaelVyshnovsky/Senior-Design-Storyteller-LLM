Jadron the Fang was the ogre leader of the Teeth mercenary company in the 14 century DR.
Jadron was famed for his brutality and cruelty, and was feared and respected by his enemies and his own warriors.
He won many enemies and no allies in his blood-soaked career, and earned a personal vendetta from Nightshade of the Silent Rain.
His son Rarnok led some of his forces for him.
