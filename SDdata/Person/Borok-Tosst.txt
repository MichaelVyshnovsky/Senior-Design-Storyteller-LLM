'''Borok-Tosst''' was a [[ghost]]ly [[yuan-ti]] [[wizard slayer]] lieutenant who served [[Nan Kung Chi]] in the [[Crypt of Durkon]] in [[Kara-Tur]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
In life and in ghostly afterlife, Borok-Tosst wore an [[enchanted]] ''+2'' set of [[leather armor]] and wielded two magic blades: a ''+1'' [[wakizashi]] and a ''+1'' [[katana]].

==History==
Borok-Tosst died many moons before the late 14{{th}} century DR. In life, he was a wizard slayer and a serpent-tailed yuan-ti and one of six trusted lieutenants who served Nan Kung Chi. He continued to do the same long after death. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the crypt faced an [[illithid]] incursion led by [[Goxxa]] the [[alhoon]]. The mind flayers consumed the ancient preserved minds of the crypt's dead and sought the ''[[Claw of the Black Leopard]]''. At the same time, a [[vampire]] [[thief]] named [[Hexxat]] arrived at the tomb at the behest of her master [[Larloch]], who sought the tomb's magical treasure. A ghostly [[monk]] named [[Ki Chin Sang]] stood guard over Nan Kung Chi's tomb and demanded anyone seeking entrance to defeat six of Nan Kung Chi's trusted undead lieutenants, who all were interred together. When Hexxat and her allies challenged the lieutenants to battle, Borok-Tosst was joined by [[Weimin Min]], [[Yi Niu]], [[Ming-hua Dai]], and [[Jiang Dai]], and, presumably, was defeated.
