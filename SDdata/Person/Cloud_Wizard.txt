Cloud Wizard was a powerful wizard among the vile yak-folk of the World Pillar Mountains in 1367 DR.
In addition to being one of the most powerful wizards among the yikarians, Cloud Wizard was also a member of the Seven Sages and the appointed governor of the Fiends Wing province within the Land of the Yak-Men. He ruled from a cloud-island mountain peak.
Cloud Wizard helped educate young yikarians in the use of magic. He also created an impressive collection of magical trinkets that he presented to the Lotus Emperor during the yak-folks mid-winter festival.
Cloud Wizard was believed to have created the sinister marrash. Even if that was not true, he still had a close relationships with the dangerous archers.
