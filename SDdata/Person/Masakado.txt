Masakado was a tiger hengeyokai in Kozakura in 1358 DR.
Masakado was always fascinated by humans and lived among them. He joined Jinchin and acted as his henchman and spy until he was discovered and destroyed.
Masakado saw a reflection of himself in Jinchin and for this reason he was so loyal to him. He tried to act as a polite and well-mannered individual, but often his rage emerged. He had not yet decided whether to follow the path of humans or the path of beasts. At last, his conflict destroyed him.
A natural shapechanger, Masakado could assume human, cat-man, or tiger aspects at will. Mostly, he acted like a cat, having all kind of abilities associated with felines.
