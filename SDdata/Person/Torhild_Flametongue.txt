Torhild Flametongue was a dwarf who founded the realm of Besilmer in .
Torhild believed that the dwarven race would remain in a beleaguered state if they continued to live underground in mines, so he set out to create an overground farming realm, where dwarves could act as builders, inventors, and repairers. His realm came under constant attack from giants, trolls from the Evermoors, and wolves, but initially he managed to fight them back.
When fighting a hill giant in one-on-one combat at the Stone Bridge, Torhild was killed, which ultimately led to the downfall of Besilmer and its inhabitants fleeing to the Fallen Kingdom.
Torhild was rumored to be buried inside the Halls of the Hunting Axe, a magnificent complex in ruins by the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR. The Halls were littered with puzzles and traps to protect his favorite weapon, a legendary axe named Orcsplitter. Many tried to find the axe, but the Harpers tried to ensure it would remain untouched.
Torhild possessed a magical horn that could be used once every one hundred and one years to summon a powerful djinni named Ahtayir, a creature that would then complete any wish or task he was ordered. Later, the horn fell into the hands of the mad elf Queen of Air, Aerisi Kalinoth.
The mark of his rule was his cherished crown, a battle-helm now known as the Lost Crown of Besilmer.
