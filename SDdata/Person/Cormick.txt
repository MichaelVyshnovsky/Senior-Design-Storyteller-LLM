'''Cormick''' was a marshal in [[Neverwinter]]'s [[City Watch (Neverwinter)|City Watch]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Cormick was something of a local legend in the village of [[West Harbor]]. He was the first one to win all four tourneys during West Harbor's [[Harvest Festival]]. He was also a good friend of [[Lorne Starling]], until Cormick won the harvest brawl using a tactic that Lorne considered cheating.

After the Harvest Festival, Cormick left West Harbor for Neverwinter and joined the City Watch where he showed much promise. Occasionally, Cormick would travel to [[Fort Locke]] to make sure his friend [[Galen]] returned safely from his annual trip to West Harbor. It was during one of these visits that he met the [[Kalach-Cha]] and enlisted his aid to try to convince the substitute Commander [[Vallis]] to resume patrols along the roads in the [[Mere of Dead Men]].

Eventually, Cormick met the Kalach-Cha again, during the war with [[Moire]]'s thieves on Neverwinter's Docks, where he assumed a very rigorous approach to the matter, hoping to eradicate all corruption from the Watch. This was unlike Captain [[Brelaina]], who believed that occasionally turning a blind eye to City Watch members who took bribes from the gangs was better than having no Watch presence at all in the docks. 

===Gameplay===
Cormick was last seen in front of [[Aldanon]]'s house after being injured by thieves in a botched burglary. Depending on the Kalach-Cha's actions, Cormick either died from his injuries or survived the ordeal. If the Kalach-Cha refused to negotiate with the thieves, Cormick died as the thieves tried to make a run for it. If the Kalach-Cha decided to negotiate and was successful, then Cormick was taken to the [[Temple of Tyr]] to heal. After a few days, the Kalach-Cha heard that Cormick had gotten up and decided to go out and get some fresh air while he was on leave recovering from his injuries.
