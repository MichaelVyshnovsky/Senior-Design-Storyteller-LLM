His voice was deep and could be heard a great distance even over the clashing of a battlefield.\n\nKing Dhalmass Obarskyr's likeness was immortalized in a famous thought the realms statue called ''King Dhalmass Surveying the Realm''. The pompous image of the King was standing chest first with balled fists on his waist and his chin lifted high. There were several copies made and displayed across Cormyr.
