Dalanyrr was a young silver dragon that dwelled in the North during the late 15 century DR.
She respected the sacred spirit mounds of the Uthgardt barbarian tribes, and would not plunder them if requested.
Dalanyrr would offer her services to help adventurers, if they provided her some type of payment.
