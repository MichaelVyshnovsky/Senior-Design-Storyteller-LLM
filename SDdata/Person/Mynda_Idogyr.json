        "mainbody": "Lady Mynda Idogyr was the wife of Lord Gamalon Idogyr, the Count of Spellshire in Tethyr.\nBecause Gamalon was often busy at Faerntarn, the royal palace of Tethyr, Mynda controlled much of the administration of Spellshire.\nMynda met her future husband on her home on the Rock of Bral in the Tears of Selûne, where she had grown up as a merchants daughter. She ignored Gamalon for four years and thought he was odd-looking and boyish in appearance. Eventually, she warmed to his advances, and the two were happily married for 30 years and had a daughter named Lara.\nMynda had served as hostess on some of Elminster and his scribe Lhaeos visits to Bral, when she had lived there. She appreciated that he brought her gifts such as Calishite spices, but she despised his pipe-smoking habit. Her daughter, Lara enjoyed listening to Lhaeos many stories.\nWhen the family moved to Toril to the lands of Gamalons family, she had trouble adapting to the weather and the court intrigue in Faerûn. She did, however, enjoy her new courtly title and the benefits in livelihood that had come with that.\nShe was killed on Uktar 28, 1374 DR, along with several others,\nCategoryNobles\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryInhabitants of Shildamere\nCategoryInhabitants of Spellshire\nCategoryInhabitants of the Crown Lands\nCategoryInhabitants of Tethyr\nCategoryInhabitants of the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of the Rock of Bral\nCategoryInhabitants of the Tears of Selûne\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Bral\nCategoryInhabitants of the Middle City\nCategoryMembers of the Idogyr family\ngesm13a7kwj8xutcwjpgetpxmmmww1x"
