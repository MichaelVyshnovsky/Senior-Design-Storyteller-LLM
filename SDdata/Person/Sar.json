        "mainbody": "ar, also called Vengeance, was a giant two-headed roc who was stabled at Sarahin, the great fortress of the Everlasting.\nSar was used by the holy slayers on major raids against caravans travelling either between Halwa and the coast, or between Qudra and the south.\nThe sheer size and appearance of the giant bird usually caused caravan guards to flee for their lives. Sar was fed a diet of camels and enemies slain during raids."
