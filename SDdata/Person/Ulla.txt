Ulla was a rock gnome guard of Gnomengarde in the late 15 century DR.
Alongside Pog, Ulla was one of Gnomengardes sentries. It was her job to hail any outsiders in Gnomish, and to attack anyone she deemed to be a threat.
In addition to her innate gnomish abilities, Ulla (like everyone else in Gnomengarde) had some training as a wizard. In combat, she preferred to attack with spells like ray of frost and magic missile.
When Gnomengarde came under attack by a mimic in the late 15 century DR, the only information given to the gnomes by their king, Korboz, was to attack any shapechangers on sight. Unfortunately, this left Ulla and her partner Pog in a predicament because anyone could be a shapechanger. They were thus highly suspicious of any outsiders, and were unlikely to let anyone pass without a fight unless they could persuade the sentries otherwise or unless they had an audience with King Korboz or King Gnerkli.
