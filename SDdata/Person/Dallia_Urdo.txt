'''Dallia Urdo''' was a young and ambitious member of the merchant [[Urdo]] family of [[Westgate]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''I must warn you... this Dallia Urdo is young and dangerous. She obviously has designs on leading House Urdo someday, though her thuggish ways are hardly befitting someone of high station.''|Okuzo}}

==Description==
Dallia was a brash and unpredictable woman who often responded aggressively and defied common sense or good will.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Dallia Urdo resided in her family's estate facing the [[Market Triangle]] and personally recruited several talented gladiators to be her bodyguards from Westgate's own [[Quivering Thumb]] arena. The thuggish woman, part of a mercantile family, set her eyes on an upstart shop, [[Okuzo's Imports]], when it began dealing in [[perfume]]s and [[spice]]s from the eastern lands of [[Kara-Tur]]. Dallia Urdo sought to squash the competition to the Urdo family business before [[Okuzo]] could grow and become a threat. Dallia attempted to buy Okuzo's business out, but the [[Wa]]nese merchant refused. Soon after, just a few days later, Dallia came to the store with her henchmen to intimidate Okuzo into selling. When Okuzo refused once again, she was backhanded with a [[ring]]-adorned hand of the thuggish Urdo scion, leaving the painful welt. The goons left but not before promising to return later to continue "negotiations."
