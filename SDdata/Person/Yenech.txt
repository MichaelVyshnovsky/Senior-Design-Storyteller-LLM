'''Yenech''' was a member of the [[Grand Council]] of [[Impiltur]], residing in [[New Sarshell]] until {{yearlink|1396}}.

In that year, the [[eladrin noble]] [[Malyanna]] kidnapped him and set her pet, the [[shadow mastiff]] [[Tamur]], on him for entertainment. Before he died, he saw [[Behroun Marhana]] in the hidden redoubt where he was trapped, and called out to him for help, only for the latter to look away. His death helped cement the upstart Lord Marhana's bid for control and power over Impiltur; as the eladrin noble made his ally watch, it also made evident what Malyanna was capable of doing.
