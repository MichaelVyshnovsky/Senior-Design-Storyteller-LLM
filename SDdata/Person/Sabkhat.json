        "mainbody": "Sheikh Sabkhat was the head of the Mtair Dhafir tribe of Bedine circa the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe older sheikh was bone thin with eyes that were clouded over and only a wisp of a beard remaining on his chin.\nSabkhat had a strained relationship with his daughter Ruha, who proved to have premonitions of the future at a young age. Because the Bedine people completely eschewed the use of magic, the sheikh sent Ruha to live with an exiled sorceress called Qohadar at the Sister of Rains oasis. After Qohadar died, Ruha spent a year searching for the Mtairi camp and eventually returned to her tribe. Families threatened to leave the Mtairi due to her return, and Sheikh Sabkhat was made the decision to marry her away to the son of a fellow tribe leader.\nHe had a formidable ally in AlAif, the most fearsome warrior of the entire tribe.\nRuha returned to the Mtair Dhafir and was sent away again by Sheikh Sabkhat in the . he ultimately agreed to Zaruds conditions without entering into a formal alliance.\nThe death of Zarud the following night prevented the agreement between the Mtairi and Zhentarim from moving forward. According to Sheikh Sabkhat the tribes only option was to \"pay the blood price\" and offer Zaruds killer over to the Zhentarim and hope they accept. Unfortunately for the sheikh, all the signs pointed to his daughter Ruha as being the murderer. While AlAif was able to let Ruha and her allies free, the rest of the Mtair Dhafir were not so fortunate. The tribespeople were slain by the Zhentilar army and their bodies fed to the Zhents asabi mercenaries."
