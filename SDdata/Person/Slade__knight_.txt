Slade was an early knight of Neverwinter and the ninth of the Nine knights who served Lord Halueth Never. They were the basis for the Neverwinter Nine.
Slade was the last to join the Nine, and on his first day of service, he died in battle. A statue of Slade and his sword later stood guard in Halueths tomb.
