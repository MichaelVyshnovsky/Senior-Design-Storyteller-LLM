'''Saeraede Lyonora''', better known as '''the Slayer''', was a [[Netherese]] [[human]] [[sorceress]] turned into a unique [[undead]] creature that awakened in the mid–8{{th}} century and went on a slaying rampage following [[Elminster Aumar]].

==Personality==
When not slaying mindlessly, Saeraede was charming, but duplicitous and depraved, with utter scorn for anyone's life save her own, and very deliberate about its depravity. Also, despite it issuing from her, the twinkling sound she made while moving really got on her nerves.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|692-695|16}}

==Description==
Most of the time, the Slayer was just a faintly visible mist, which made a sound like bells as it moved.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|563|3}} It could turn into a whirlwind, or take other forms, becoming a morass of claws and jaws.

When aping the form she had in life, Saeraede Lyonora had green eyes, glossy black hair to her slim waist, broad shoulders, and tufty eyebrows, though she made a point of projecting a figure that was taller, slimmer, and more buxom than she remembered herself to be.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|716-721|18}}

==Abilities==
The Slayer possessed a startling ability to devour living flesh in less than a heartbeat, leaving little but bones behind;{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|587|5}} As a formless thing, she was able to flow through small cracks, even shutter chinks. It also had the ability to turn into a ghostly mass of jaws, with barbed tentacles and long claws protruding from it. It was able to thwart many wards easily, though upon taking damage in that shape, it returned to its mist form.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|598-600|6}} When it had drawn enough power, the Slayer could even thwart the magic of gods.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|579|5}}

Saeraede Lyonora was also a sorceress, and could cast at least one offensive, [[acid]]ic spell, capable of reducing a man to sludge in moments. Her ghostly form was susceptible to spells such as ''[[shatterstar]]'', which targeted incorporeal entities. She could also project images, and scry with ''[[spellspheres]]'', even towards distant mages. Given time, she could also warp existing magic, no matter how powerful, to ensure it responded only to her touch. While she could coalesce enough to move physical objects, that required her to expend much energy that she could only recover by stealing lifeforce.

==Possessions==
Saeraede collected a number of feminine dresses in particular from passing caravans: one of them was blue and ruffled, one was black with slits, and another was red, with [[gem]]-highlighted [[dragon]]s along the hips.

==Relationships==
In her undeath, Saeraede had taken two lovers, both of which she drained to death: [[Brandagaeris]] and [[Sardon]].

==History==
Saeraede Lyonora considered that in life, she had been a feared sorceress.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|512|Prologue}}

She was later disturbed, first by the [[Chosen of Mystra]] [[Elminster Aumar]], and then, years later, by a nameless band of [[adventurer]]s that included [[Iyriklaunavan]], an [[elf]] [[wizard]], and [[Nuressa]], a warrior, on [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|759}}. Elminster Aumar had become trapped in the tomb somehow and, after being disturbed by the adventurers, escaped. Shortly after, the runes went haywire and a strange mist was released from the giant coffin; the Slayer perceived that the creatures that had disturbed the tomb still lived.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|518|Prologue}}

Later, in mid-spring of the {{yearlinkName|761}}, the mist followed Elminster Aumar, who had first disturbed its grave, to Castle [[Felmorel]]; it followed him inside, and when he left in the middle of the night, it followed him outside. Along the way, it took a detour, passing through [[Torntlar's Farm]], where the farmer [[Habaertus Ilynker]] swung his hoe into the misty body out of curiosity. The mist struck him, leaving only a wind-scoured skeleton. The misty entity continued to pursue Elminster, lingering longer in places where he'd been, like the hill near [[Tresset's Ringyl]], where it showed signs of distraction and hunger. Afterwards, it headed for the path between [[Aerhiot's Field]] and [[Salopar's Field]], where it consumed the farmer [[Nuglar]] and his three [[ox]]en.

The entity then resumed its tracking, heading for [[Moonshorn Tower]], where Elminster had been. There, it somehow forced the doors open, and flowed up into the repository for [[Netherese]] texts and trinkets. There, it was interrupted by the tower guardian, [[Mardasper Oblyndrin]], who struck it with a ''shatterstar'' spell; though it was effective, she endured it and retaliated, killing him with a spell.

In the {{yearlinkName|764}}, the entity assaulted the tower of [[Yintras Bedelmrin]], devouring all the deer that grazed around it one night before squeezing in through a window that was ajar. It was, however, repelled by the mage, who was wielding a blessing from [[Azuth]] himself.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|607-609|7}} At some point during or after the crowning of the sorceress [[Dasumia]] as queen of [[Galadorna]], the mysterious being assaulted [[Glymril Gard]], slaying the mage [[Klandaerlas Glymril]], the Master of [[Wyvern]]s in that isolated castle.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|625-627|9}} Late into the year, it remained close to Elminster and followed him into Galadorna when he became the Court Mage, staying near the spires of the [[House of the Unicorn]]; the entity fled into the streets after the goddess [[Mystra]] revealed herself.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|640|10}}

Later, it had taken residence in a ruined keep between Starmantle and [[Westgate]], which belonged to [[Karsus]] of [[Netheril]], whom Saeraede Lyonora had been aware of.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|661-662|12}} This structure was called [[Karsus' Keep]].{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|653-656|12}}

In the early spring of the {{yearlinkName|767}}, the monster had gained the nickname of "the Slayer" after settling in a section of the forest near [[Starmantle]] between [[Oggle's Stream]] and [[Rairdrun Hill]], and completely depopulating it of any animal life larger than a mouse, giving the area the name [[the Dead Place]].{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|701|13}} It also eliminated merchants that passed by, livestock that got too close, farmers, woodsmen, a patrol of Duke [[Horostos]]'s men, and even a large force led by a priest of [[Tempus]]. The thing was not spotted by [[griffon]] riders; the Duke sent a band of adventurers after it, the [[Frostfire Banner]], which it eliminated without encountering any difficulties.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|643-648|11}} Afterwards, it schemed to lure mages to Karsus's Keep.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|669|13}}

Eventually, no one in [[Reth]] or Westgate would take on the assignment of slaying the monster, having heard of the fate of all who faced the Slayer.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|674-677|14}} She managed to draw Elminster to the Keep, where he was attacked by adventurers; she killed the adventurers and then lured him with her own twinkling down a well, leading him into a hidden throne room.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|705-706|18}}

Saeraede Lyonora cast a spell to shut the well entrance, to trap Elminster there without him noticing, and then pretended to require a ritual to be freed. Upon being freed, she promised Elminster the use of those runes and their secrets. She then tried to trick him into a different casting,{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|722-724|19}} Saeraede protected Elminster in those last few moments, to ensure she could feed on him herself.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|726-727|19}} However, just as she was on the cusp of regaining full form and life, she was stabbed through the heart by Ilbryn Starym. When he pulled his sword out to try and strike at Elminster, Saeraede's bulk exploded furiously, reducing Ilbryn to ash in return.
