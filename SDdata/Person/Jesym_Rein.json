        "mainbody": "esym Rein was an infamous citizen of the Rein family of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 14 century DR.\nJesym was the daughter of Deldron Rein and an older sister to Stedd.\nAs the daughter of Deldron Rein, leader of the Red Boar Trading Coster and owner of properties such as the Red Boar Inn, Jesym was born to the wealthy and influential Rein family of Loudwater, which had immigrated from Waterdeep some six decades earlier.\nIn the summer of the , Zhentarim out of Llorkh seized control of the neighboring town of Orlbar. The people soon revolted against their tyrannical rule, and they were backed by Loudwater. But Jesym Rein turned traitor to both the Orlbar rebels and the Loudwater soldiers, by revealing their battle plans and their concealed caches of weapons and potions to the Zhentarim. Thanks to her, the Zhentarim and clerics of Iyachtu Xvim brutally crushed the rebellion and Loudwater was forced to sign the Oath of Orlbar, a peace treaty that marked a border between the two states in the years after.\nHer actions tarnished the Rein name with a reputation for treachery, though this was soon healed when her brother Stedd displayed as much as heroism and leadership in the Night of the Blood Moon battle in autumn later that year.\nJesym did not live as long, however. By 1372 DR, the Zhents commemorated her betrayal in a mural in the Martyrs Tribute room in the Fortress of the Eternal Despot, a temple to Xvim, and later Bane, built overlooking Orlbar.This tribute to Jesym here suggests she is a follower of Xvim and is deceased by the adventure date of 1372 DR, likely killed in the fighting over Orlbar."
