        "mainbody": "Ulmyn Andalor was a miller in Bowshot in the Western Heartlands in 1367 DR.\nUlmyn lived in the roadside hamlet of Bowshot, north of the Way Inn. His sawmill was always busy and he traveled night and day.\nUlmyn was a simple man who liked efficiency. He was an expert in working different kinds of woods.\nSome said Ulmyn was once a nobles guard in Waterdeep until he had a liaison with the nobles daughter and decided to resettle in Bowshot to cover the scandal. The rumor may have also involved a child. Some others said that the nobles family had sent assassins to kill Ulmyn. Others folks said Ulmyn was only the human cover for a monstrous creature."
