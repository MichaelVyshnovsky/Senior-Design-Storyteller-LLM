        "mainbody": "Gorstal Hammers was an adventuring wizard who lived in Telpir on the Dragon Coast, circa 1360 DR.\nGorstal was a womanizer that had a taste for ladies in the upper echelons of society.\nHammers was a business partner with Endreth Molipher, a former pirate, and two other wizards, Halartan Groune, and Orbel Mhaerouzan.\nGorstal found a new use for creatures that he encountered while adventuringâ€”he subdued and captured them instead of killing them, and delivered them to Moliphers island of Storna (not far from Telpir) in the Inner Sea for fun and profit. He and his fellow wizards helped make Moliphers Dark Dragon Hunts a success by providing the dangerous creatures that would be hunted, and by altering the dreams of hapless clients that failed to bag a monster so that they felt as if they had actually engaged in heroic battle with a deadly wild animal and triumphed.\nAs part of the agreement, Gorstal was allowed to use the island as place to store items he wanted protected, or as a hideout."
