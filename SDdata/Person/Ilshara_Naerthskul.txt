'''Ilshara Naerthskul''' was a thief in the [[Ten Towns]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Ilshara was an infamous thief who specialized in working on rooftops, minarets, and chimneys and in the theft of [[diamond]]s, coins, [[magical item]]s, and any kind of weapon.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], the wizard [[Orlmar]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] caught her. Ilshara escaped and nobody saw her again.

By 1370 DR, she had apparently resurfaced, reporting to be living in a villa in [[Caer-Konig]] as Istara, wife of a fishmonger and having the abilities of a practiced wizard.
