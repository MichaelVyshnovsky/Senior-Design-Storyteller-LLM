Ilshara Naerthskul was a thief in the Ten Towns in 1370 DR.
Ilshara was an infamous thief who specialized in working on rooftops, minarets, and chimneys and in the theft of diamonds, coins, magical items, and any kind of weapon.
In 1369 DR, the wizard Orlmar of Baldurs Gate caught her. Ilshara escaped and nobody saw her again.
By 1370 DR, she had apparently resurfaced, reporting to be living in a villa in Caer-Konig as Istara, wife of a fishmonger and having the abilities of a practiced wizard.
