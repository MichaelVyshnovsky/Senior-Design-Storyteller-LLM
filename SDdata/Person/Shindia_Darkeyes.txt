Shindia Darkeyes was a female half-drow in the service of the Xanathar Thieves Guild.
In truth, she was the favorite servant of the original Xanathar and when the Eye killed and impersonated the Xanathar she agreed to join the reformed organization, but in secret she plotted to destroy the Eye, with help from the mind flayers of ChChitl. Unknown to her, the Eye knew all about her plots.
She ran the blackmail, extortion, and information-gathering operations of the guild.
