'''Akirakeiko''' was a [[sohei]] adventurer in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Akirakeiko lived in a [[Konjo temple]] in [[Shizume Province]], always busy in skirmishes with rival sohei of [[Kanchai temple]]. In circa 1357 DR, however, the Kanchai sohei gained the support of the [[shugo-daimyo]] of Shizume and attacked in large numbers, destroying the temple.

Akirakeiko survived, being away at an isolated outpost that day. Unable to remain in Shizume because of pressure the shugo-daimyo, Akirakeiko went to the Konjio temple of Miyama, where he met and befriended the young [[shukenja]] [[Annen]]. Together they went on adventures.
