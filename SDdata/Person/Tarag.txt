'''Tarag''' was a [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]] chieftain of [[Serôs]] in the 6th century [[DR]].

==History==
Tarag somehow came into the possession of the sword [[Ilbratha|''Ilbratha'']], the legendary lost sword of King [[Azoun I]] of [[Cormyr]].

As a chieftain of the sea [[ogre]]s, Tarag used the powers of the sword and his own battle strategies to conquer the western frontiers of the [[merfolk]] realm of [[Hmurrath]]. There, in the [[582 DR|Year of the Deep Wound, 582 DR]], Tarag founded the two [[Axe Kingdoms]] of [[Khuur]] and [[Nmalk]]. ''Ilbratha'' remained among the merrow for seventy-three years.
