Tarag was a merrow chieftain of Ser么s in the 6th century DR.
Tarag somehow came into the possession of the sword Ilbratha, the legendary lost sword of King Azoun I of Cormyr.
As a chieftain of the sea ogres, Tarag used the powers of the sword and his own battle strategies to conquer the western frontiers of the merfolk realm of Hmurrath. There, in the Year of the Deep Wound, 582 DR, Tarag founded the two Axe Kingdoms of Khuur and Nmalk. Ilbratha remained among the merrow for seventy-three years.
