        "mainbody": "Piyrathur was a caravan master from Iriaebor and a member of the Knights of the Shield in 1370 DR.\nPiyrathur was one of the few Knights operating in the Caravan Cities. He was an able caravan master with investments in Sembia and Westgate, controlling most of the Knights business around the Sea of Fallen Stars. Strangely for someone with no magical power, he was a devoted follower of Mystra, donating much money and magical items to the Church of Mystra. Piyrathurs main concern was thwarting the plots of the Men of the Basilisk"
