'''Renal Bloodscalp''' was the Silhouette of Burglars in [[Athkatla]] in [[1370]].

==Description==
Renal was a shady character who crouched more than he stood. He held an enchanted [[short sword]] as a weapon, one that he famously used if needed. He was also constantly surrounded by his bodyguards on the top floor of his headquarters. He wore black [[leather armor]] that was also enchanted. He constantly had a red hood pulled over his head.

==Personality==
Renal, despite his high status, still liked to break into buildings. Sometimes, cleverly disguised, he led a team of thieves on certain jobs. He collected knives from the [[Old Empires]] and far-off lands. Renal greatly dislike [[spider]]s.
He had a constant rivalry with [[Mae'Var]], another guildmaster.

==Abilities==
Renal was a master thief with exceptional skills in breaking and entering. He possessed a knack for killing as well, and he was a top assassin within the thieves guild. His nickname was derived from his nasty habit of [[scalping]] his targets/enemies, typically leaving the scalp at the scene of the crime.
 
==History==
In his headquarters, he hid [[Aran Linvail]], the leader of the entire organization.

He sent [[Gorion's Ward]] to investigate Mae'Var's "treachery". Ultimately, he ordered Gorion's Ward to assassinate Mae'Var after the hero discovered Mae'Var's attempts to plot with the [[Night_Knives_(guild)|Night Knives]].
