        "mainbody": "Pheldred was a Red Wizard of Thay in the mid-14 century.\nFor a long time, his arms kept changing into manacles. He had dark hair and glittering black eyes.\nDuring his duel with Aumlar Chaunthoun, Pheldred cast a number of spells, including one which launched a shimmering sword, one which created an advancing strip of drifting silver sparks, apparently called deathwall, and another of his spells generated a spiraling silver energy that closed around its target, with unknown effects the spiral was vulnerable to some wands. He used some manner of shieldings, which blocked numerous spells from wands, but worked ablatively, being slowly worn down by volume. Some of his shieldings could be made to expand and turn away magic. Another of his spells drank the power from spells around him and even wands, powering new spellblades with them.\nHe sought revenge against Aumlar Chaunthoun, a Zhentarim mage. Korthauvar Hammantle and Hlael Toraunt were aware of him and his history.\nHe wore two rings, dark maroon robes, and a richly made belt, in which he held two daggers and a whip.\nPheldred had been cursed at some point by Aumlar Chaunthoun, so that his arms kept changing into manacles. He spent some years with this handicap, until he was finally able to find the names by which he could command the fiend into which Aumlar Chathoun had bound the curse. The Zhentarim knew hed managed to slip out of too many deadly situations unscathed.\nIn late , Pheldred ambushed Aumlar Chaunthoun, who was undercover in a caravan under Orthil Voldovan, en route from Scornubel to Triel, on the way to Waterdeep. He was eventually overmatched and forced to flee."
