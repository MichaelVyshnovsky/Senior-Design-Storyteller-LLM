Alanaerle was the proprietor of the Weary Knight Inn in Arabel, Cormyr, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Alanaerle was a large human woman with a personality just as big. She was considered unattractive, and her face was said to have scared children. Alanaerle was always jolly and hospitable. She was a lover of romantic tales and ballads with happy endings, often giving half-off discounts to traveling bards and minstrels in exchange for a performance.
Alanaerles prized possession was her roadhouse â€“ the Weary Knight Inn. The inn was possibly the most average establishment in the Realms, according to Volothamp Geddarm. The Knights namesake was an unopened tomb of a knight that dated to times of antiquity. Alanaerle guarded the carved tomb and its undiscovered contents with passion.
