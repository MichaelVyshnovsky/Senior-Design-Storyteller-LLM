'''Alanaerle''' was the proprietor of the [[Weary Knight Inn]] in [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Alanaerle was a large [[human]] woman with a personality just as big. She was considered unattractive, and her face was said to have scared children. Alanaerle was always jolly and hospitable. She was a lover of romantic tales and ballads with happy endings, often giving half-off discounts to traveling [[bard]]s and [[minstrel]]s in exchange for a performance.

==Possessions==
Alanaerle's prized possession was her roadhouse â€“ the Weary Knight Inn. The inn was possibly the most average establishment in the Realms, according to [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. The Knight's namesake was an unopened tomb of a knight that dated to times of antiquity. Alanaerle guarded the carved tomb and its undiscovered contents with passion.

==Relationships==
The inn's proprietor was devoted to the Lady Lord of [[Arabel]], [[Myrmeen Lhal]], and provided free lodgings and food for those in possession of the Lady Lord's special black [[onyx]] [[ring]]s.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Alanaerle was already the proprietor of the Weary Knight Inn that stood directly to the east from the [[Citadel (Arabel)|Citadel]] and three blocks away from the city's Eastgate.{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|32-33}} In 1360 DR, Alanaerle provided food and room for a small group of adventurers tasked by Myrmeen Lhal with the investigation into a series of [[wizard]] murders in Arabel.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Alanaerle and her establishment remained open and popular. Volothamp Geddarm listed the inn in his ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr|Guide to Cormyr]]'' and complemented Alanaerle for her pleasant attitude.
