'''Alim Zangi''' was a powerful [[sha'ir]] living on [[Jazirat al-Sayyad]] in the [[Crowded Sea]].

==Activities==
Alim was the sha'ir responsible for binding a group of [[herdsman genie]]s to watch over the fabulous Sayyad bloodline of horses on the island of Jazirat al-Sayyad. 

Alim tricked the [[genie]]s into servitude, but over the centuries the genies have taken great pride into what the Sayyad horses have become.
