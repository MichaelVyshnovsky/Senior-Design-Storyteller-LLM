Alim Zangi was a powerful shair living on Jazirat al-Sayyad in the Crowded Sea.
Alim was the shair responsible for binding a group of herdsman genies to watch over the fabulous Sayyad bloodline of horses on the island of Jazirat al-Sayyad. 
Alim tricked the genies into servitude, but over the centuries the genies have taken great pride into what the Sayyad horses have become.
