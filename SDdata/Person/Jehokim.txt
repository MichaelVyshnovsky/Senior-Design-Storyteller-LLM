Jehokim was a businessman in Unther in 1357 DR.
Jehokim was an adventurer in his youth but after finding a great treasure he retired and opened several inns across Unther. In time, there was a Grey Chimera inn in each major city of Unther and Mulhorand.
The rebellion in 1357 DR was a threat to his business and he agreed to cooperate with the clergy of Gilgeam to end it, even telling the priests of known traitors.
