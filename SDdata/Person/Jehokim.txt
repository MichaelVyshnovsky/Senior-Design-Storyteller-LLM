'''Jehokim''' was a businessman in [[Unther]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Jehokim was an adventurer in his youth but after finding a great treasure he retired and opened several inns across Unther. In time, there was a [[Grey Chimera]] inn in each major city of Unther and [[Mulhorand]].

The rebellion in 1357 DR was a threat to his business and he agreed to cooperate with the clergy of [[Gilgeam]] to end it, even telling the priests of known traitors.
