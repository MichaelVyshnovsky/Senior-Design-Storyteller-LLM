'''Rolf''' was a roofer of the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a young man, but big.

==Relationships==
Rolf had his heart only on [[Mayella Meadowbrock]], who'd been his friend since childhood. However, she was the daughter of [[Barthelm Meadowbrock]], who disapproved of the lowborn laborer.

The bully Dovo knew Rolf's temper was his weak spot and so liked to insult him and make him jealous by pestering Mayella to get a rise out of him.

==Personality==
Rolf had a short, hot, and violent temper. He got into fights just about every [[tenday]], so much so that his father worried about him.

==History==
In around [[Ches]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Rolf was hired by [[Lukas Spoondrift]] to repair the roof of the [[Sheaf of Wheat]] inn. However, one midnight, heavy boxes of wood shingles left on the roof fell through the floors and rained shingles down on Spoondrift and his wife in their bed. While Spoondrift blamed Rolf, Rolf denied the already rotten beams were his fault. Rolf's father, also a roofer, offered to share the cost of rebuilding, but Spoondrift refused. They took the matter to a magistrate in [[Wheloon]], and argued about it through the rest of the year. Lukas maintained a grudge against Rolf thereafter.

Rolf once apparently almost killed a man in a brawl in [[Thunderstone]]. While the other guy started it, Rolf finished it.

After a hard day's work, Rolf and a pair of fellow roofers went to the [[Bold Bard]] tavern on the evening of [[Eleint 16]], boasting he could expose the culprit behind recent sightings of [[Fastred]]'s ghost. When he saw the lecherous [[Dovo]] harassing Mayella, he intervened, and lost his temper when Dovo insulted him. The two got into a tavern brawl while Barthelm ordered Mayella to leave with him. Tavernkeeper [[Shortshanks]] broke it up, Rolf got the blame for starting it, and was roughly thrown out and even billed for the mess.

When Dovo was found dead the [[Eleint 17|next morning]], after impersonating Fastred's ghost, Rolf was briefly considered by some as a suspect.

On [[Eleint 19]], Rolf was again trying to enjoy a night at the Bold Bard when he and Shortshanks were forced by four [[Purple Dragons]] to go with them to a midnight meeting at [[Benelaius]]'s cottage. Naturally, they were angry about this. There, Benelaius revealed the murderer of [[Dovo]] and [[Grodoveth]]; Rolf was cleared of involvement, despite his hot-tempered interruptions and boldly declaring he'd die to defend Mayella's honor.
