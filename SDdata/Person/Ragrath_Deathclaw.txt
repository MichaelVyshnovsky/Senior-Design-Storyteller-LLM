'''Ragrath Deathclaw''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Gruumsh]] for the [[Ripped Gut]] tribe of [[orc]]s of [[Baraskur]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Although his father [[Arlagh Deathclaw|Arlagh]] was the clan's chieftain, Ragrath was more influenced by another follower of the "One-Eyed God", [[Orauth Skullstone]]. In fact, the younger Deathclaw was so swayed by Skullstone and his ideology, that he planned to betray his father in the name of Gruumsh.
