Deseyna Norvael was a prisoner at the Fane of the Eye under Tyar-Besil during the Elemental Evil crisis.
In 1491 DR, Deseyna was chosen among many others to be part of a diplomatic delegation to Mirabar. However, at Beliard in the Dessarin Valley, they were ambushed by the Cult of the Black Earth. Deseyna was captured and transported beyond the River Dessarin. There, in the Sumber Hills, they were attacked by the Cult of the Howling Hatred, which captured Deseyna.
The air cultists took her to a jail at the Fane until some adventurers infiltrated the temple and freed her.
