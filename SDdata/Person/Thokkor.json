Under Thokkors guidance, they became the bravest units in Huzuzs military.\nThokkor spent all of his time training three mercenary units. Each had 700 men.\nHe lived in an apartment within the Hall of Commanders in the Palace of the Enlightened Throne.\nOnce a slave, Thokkor was bought and freed by Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir in the days before Khalil became the Grand Caliph. The two would often adventure together and grew quite close. Thokkor swore his allegiance to Khalil and offered to serve in the military, eventually rising to command Huzuzs mercenary forces."
