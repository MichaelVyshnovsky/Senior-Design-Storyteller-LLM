'''Kurkle''' was a [[haraknin]] ([[hell hound]] [[canomorph]]) who served as a guide and scout in the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].

==Description==
Kurkle's natural form was a hell hound, but as a canomorph he could change into [[humanoid]] form. His humanoid form resembled a [[half-orc]], with rusty red hair and a beard. In this form, he wore gray and black clothing and wielded a large [[scimitar]].

==History==
In [[1373 DR]], Kurkle was hired by [[Kaanyr Vhok]] and [[Zasian Menz]], accompanied by [[Myshik Morueme]], to serve as their guide through the Elemental Plane of Fire to the [[City of Brass]]. When Myshik turned on his companions, he killed Kurkle and trapped Vhok and Zasian in an extraplanar mansion.
