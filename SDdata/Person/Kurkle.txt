Kurkle was a haraknin (hell hound canomorph) who served as a guide and scout in the Elemental Plane of Fire.
Kurkles natural form was a hell hound, but as a canomorph he could change into humanoid form. His humanoid form resembled a half-orc, with rusty red hair and a beard. In this form, he wore gray and black clothing and wielded a large scimitar.
In 1373 DR, Kurkle was hired by Kaanyr Vhok and Zasian Menz, accompanied by Myshik Morueme, to serve as their guide through the Elemental Plane of Fire to the City of Brass. When Myshik turned on his companions, he killed Kurkle and trapped Vhok and Zasian in an extraplanar mansion.
