Aasim al-Nazi was a priest of the Golden Mosque in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Aasim was an honest man who was completely devoted to his work.
Aasim was responsible for the treasury of the Golden Mosque. He organized and allocated all funds, both magical and mundane, that were donated to the mosque from the faithful. This money was used for general maintenance as well as to help the hospices located throughout the city.
Aasim once caught a thief who was shrunk and placed into a bottle and donated to the mosque as a genie. She was caught sneaking a backpack full of treasure from the mosque but did not survive the encounter.
