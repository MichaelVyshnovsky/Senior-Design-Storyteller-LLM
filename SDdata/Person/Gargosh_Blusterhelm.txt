'''Gargosh Blusterhelm''' was a [[dwarf]] of [[Mithral Hall]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==History==
Gargosh devoted his life to finding the legendary [[axe]] ''[[Orcsplitter]]'', property of King [[Torhild Flametongue]] of [[Besilmer]], and presenting it to the elders of [[Clan Blusterhelm]] in the hopes of restoring his family's lackluster reputation. The clan elders considered this a fool's plan, and the [[Harpers]] tried to sabotage him, sensing it was better not to recover the weapon, and secretly his cousin [[Drannin Splitshield]] plotted to steal the axe from him at the right time.

In [[1491 DR]], despite everything, Gargosh, with the support of the [[Lords' Alliance]], hired some adventurers to search for the axe in the [[Halls of the Hunting Axe]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]]. The Harper [[wizard]], [[Ariana Riverlost]], tried to stop this attempt, but eventually failed.

However, soon after, he was kidnapped by Drannin, who replaced him with a [[doppelganger]] loyal to him.

Afterward the axe was recovered by his adventurers and Drannin and the doppelganger defeated, Gargosh was freed from his prison near [[Yartar]].
