'''Qallit''' was a [[sahuagin]] [[malenti]] living in the [[Great Sea]] near a [[zaratan]] around the [[Corsair Domains]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Qallit guarded the island formed by the zaratan's shell from intruders, questioning any who approached. They tried to enlist aid when they were able to help cleanse the isle of a self-proclaimed caliph named [[Nuri al-Zaratani]]
