'''Splugoth''' the Returned, previously known as '''Splug''', was a [[goblin]] who briefly collaborated with [[Acquisitions Incorporated]] before being betrayed and left for dead by the company. Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1496}}, he was resurrected by the [[lich]] [[Jeff Magic]] and ended up in charge of [[the Six]]'s operation to get its hands on the ''[[Orrery of the Wanderer]]''.

==Description==
Splugoth had one pale eye.

==Personality==
Splug was a pathological liar. 

==Abilities==
Splugoth had a limited ability to stop physical effects using residual energy from Jeff Magic's resurrection magic. He also recalled some words he heard on his way back to the world of the living, which he could recite to momentarily overwhelm those who heard them.

==Possessions==
[[File:Splugoth triumphant.png|thumb|left|200px|Splugoth triumphantly holds up a component of the ''Orrery of the Wanderer''.]]
By the time he attempted to conduct the ritual to trigger an incursion from the [[Far Realm]], Splugoth might've had any number of components of the ''Orrery of the Wanderer'', at least including the ''[[far gear]]''.

==Relationships==
Due to his betrayal by the company, Splugoth was deeply resentful towards Acquisitions Incorporated.

Splugoth looked up to Jeff Magic, and considered him to be a "real hero".

==History==
Years before his first run-in with Acquisitions Incorporated, Splug was part of a goblin tribe that lived beneath [[Shadowfell Keep]], dominated by the [[sorcerer]] and death cult leader [[Kalarel]]. Unpopular with his fellow goblins, he ended up incarcerated after conning several tribe members out of their [[ale]].

When Acquisitions Incorporated came to the keep in order to stop Kalarel's plan to free what Splug described as a "death god",<ref group="note">The identity of this deity is, perhaps intentionally, left ambiguous in the ''[[Acquisitions Incorporated (sourcebook)|Acquisitions Incorporated]]'' sourcebook. In the first season of the [https://www.acq-inc.com/portfolio ''Acquisitions Incorporated'' podcast] and the original text of ''[[Keep on the Shadowfell]]'', this "death god" was [[Orcus]], but [[Dungeon magazine 155|''Dungeon'' magazine 155]]'s ''Keep on the Shadowfell: <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Forgotten Realms</span> Conversion'' instead places [[Shar]] in this role. the goblin somehow assisted them in doing so. Despite his help, the company apparently left Splug to die in order to save one of its team members.

Eventually, Splug was resurrected by Jeff Magic, at which point he took on the name Splugoth the Returned. The lich put him in charge of obtaining all components of the ''Orrery of the Wanderer'' in the name of the Six, mainly through coordinating raids. including the [[jackalwere]] [[Hamebi]], a [[battle balloon]] captain named [[Garla]], and her crew of [[hobgoblin]]s, goblins, and [[smoke mephit]]s.

Having learned of a group of Acquisitions Incorporated employees interfering with his ambitions, Splugoth arranged with Garla to intercept the group's battle balloon journey to the [[Greypeak Mountains]] with two of the Six's own battle balloons, one of them armed with a giant [[needle]] affixed to its prow.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was rumored that Splugoth was resurrected more than once.
