'''Emrae Firesky''' was a [[Iliyanbruen]] [[moon elf]] and a priestess of [[Corellon]] who lived in [[New Sharandar]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|It displeases me greatly to accept aid given by those from [[Neverwinter]].|Emrae, to the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]]}}

==Personality==
She was known as an angry upstart among the [[fey]] of New Sharandar, often championing the use of violence towards those who lived in the region around the [[Neverwinter Wood]].

==Activities==
Emrae was the highest-ranking priestess at the [[Temple of Leaves]] temple in New Sharandar.

==Relationships==
Emrae was a close ally of [[Olirien Mistcrown]] and his fellow elves who sought revenge against the residents of [[Neverwinter]].

She was aided in her role at the temple by her assistant [[Addemios Three-Dawn]], a secret devotee of [[Asmodeus]] who sought to exploit the conflict between the elves of New Sharandar and the residents of Neverwinter.

==History==
When the [[fomorian]] giant king [[Malabog]] threatened New Sharandar ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Emrae took up temporary residence within the [[Blighted Forest]] to act against his destructive army. She ordered some adventurers to gather [[fey flowers]] throughout the region in order to preserve them from the blight of the [[dark fey]], and replant new trees that had been magically enchanted.
