'''Ulbror''' was an [[orc]] [[chieftain]] of the orc kingdom of [[Vastar]] in the 6th century [[DR]].

In [[512 DR|the Year of the Wyvernfall, 512 DR]], Ulbror led an orcish horde out of Vastar and marched them east through many small passes over the [[Earthspur Mountains]]. They invaded the uplands of [[Impiltur]], where they were met by a small army led by King [[Sharaun Mirandor]]. The orcs destroyed the Impilturan army, killing Sharaun and his three sons in battle and thus ending the [[Mirandor]] dynasty.

Later that year, Duke [[Harandil Durlaven]] had mustered another army and met Ulbror's horde in the [[Battle of Bloody Reeds]]. This time, the orcs were routed and Harandil was crowned king.
