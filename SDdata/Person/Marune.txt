When questioned about that, Eric L. Boyd has explained his hand-in had Marune as Chaotic Evil. Thus, this article is written under the assumption that Marune's "Neutral evil" alignment in the book is an editing mistake and accepts the attested alignment, in line with the wiki's present policy of allowing writers to correct errors in editing.{{cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Marune per Boyd}}

'''Marune''', usually known as '''the Masked''', was a necromancer and the oldest living member of the [[Shadow Thieves]] and also the leading agent to their comeback in [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
Befitting a member of the Shadow Thieves, Marune had few distinguishing feature. He was average in both height and appearance, with a rotund build and non-descript gray beard. He wore the black robes preferred by many of those who chose to study necromancy.

==Personality==
The aged necromancer was a particularly vicious man who was driven in great part by his petty thirst for vengeance. He took whatever actions were needed to ensure the continuation of the Shadow Thieves, regardless of the changes that occurred within its hierarchy or operations.

==Relationships==
Marune possessed great hatred for the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] and all members of the [[Arunsun]] family.{{Template:Cite book/The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier/The Wilderness|36}}

He was served well by six individual [[will-o'-wisp]]s.

==Possessions==
Early in his career Marune plundered a long-forgotten ruined tower in the [[Lost Peaks]], and acquired the artifact known as ''[[Andrathath's Mask]]''.

At some point before his expulsion from Waterdeep, Marune acquired ''[[Orjalun's Arbatel]]'' after slaying [[Arathur Harpell]] in a duel, but lost it shortly thereafter.{{Template:Cite book/Pages from the Mages|88}}

==History==
Marune was born in the {{yearlinkName|1226}} and achieved unnatural long life by magical means with ''Andrathath's Mask'', saving him from undergoing the process of [[lichdom]].

Marune was one of the founding member of the Shadow Thieves of Waterdeep in the {{yearlinkName|1255}},{{Template:Cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|126}} serving as Shadowmage of the guild until their defeat and expulsion from the city in the {{yearlinkName|1298}}.

The aged mage retreated for nearly half a century until the {{YearlinkName|1342}}, when he sold all of his assets and holdings in the cities of [[Luskan]] and [[Mirabar]]. No one knew that he had acquired the ''[[Book of Vauth]]'', secluded himself within an underground lair at the base of [[Mount Helimbrar]] for over 30 years to study it in earnest.{{Template:Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|14}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Marune returned to the Shadow Thieves to take back his power within the organization. For all appearances, he was designated as the Cloakmaster of [[Dessarin Valley|Dessarin]], reporting to the guild's Shade in [[Baldur's Gate]]. In reality his prestige granted him near complete autonomy from the [[Shadow Council]].
