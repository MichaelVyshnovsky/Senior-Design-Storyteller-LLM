'''Helisa Ithcanter''' was a cleric of [[Azuth]] in [[Westbridge]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Helisa couldn't stay still, always needing something to do. Helisa was thirsty for information about her hometown of [[Baldur's Gate]] and her friends there. She was worried by [[Ghaliver Longstocking]]'s rise to the top, fearing this gave influence to the [[Zhentarim]] over Westbridge. Anyone that knew how to damage Ghaliver or the [[Zhent]]s was welcomed.
