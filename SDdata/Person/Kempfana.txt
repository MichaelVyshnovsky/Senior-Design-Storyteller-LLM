Kempfana was a barghest whelp from the plains of Gehenna in the midâ€“14 century DR. He was the brother of Ulgulu.
Kempana was a huge, scarlet-skinned goblin-like creature. When excited, his eyes would glow orange.
Of the two brothers, Kempfana was the weaker, with Ulgulu having claimed dominance and eating the stronger of their victims.
Sent to the Material Plane to eat and grow, Kempfana and his brother Ulgulu made their home in the cave of a hill giant named Lagerbottoms in the Silver Marches, where they could safely mature before returning to their home plane.
Around 1340 DR, the barghests sent their main force of gnolls to capture the father and eldest son of the Thistledown family, but raiders never returned. Ulgulu and his brother sent Nathak to scout out what happened and he returned reporting their raiding party of five gnolls were dead. After that, Ulgulu sent his quickling ally, Tephanis, to discover exactly what had happened. When Tephanis returned, he told them a newly surfaced drow, Drizzt DoUrden, had slain the monsters. In a rage, Ulgulu asked the quickling steal one of Drizzts scimitars. After receiving the blade, Ulgulu used his shape-changing abilities to make himself appear as a drow and attacked the Thistledown farmstead. After slaying the residents, he left the broken scimitar to incriminate Drizzt as the killer of the family.
When Drizzt learned what had happened, he and Guenhwyvar attacked the caves inhabitants, destroying the two barghests and many of their goblin allies. Kempfana held Drizzt by the neck and attempted to bite his head off, excited at the prospect of perhaps maturing enough to go back to Gehenna. However, Drizzt stabbed him through the mouth and brain, killing him instead.
