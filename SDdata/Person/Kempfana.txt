'''Kempfana''' was a [[barghest]] whelp from the plains of [[Gehenna]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the brother of [[Ulgulu]].

==Description==
Kempana was a huge, scarlet-skinned [[goblin]]-like creature. When excited, his eyes would glow orange.

==Personality==
Of the two brothers, Kempfana was the weaker, with Ulgulu having claimed dominance and eating the stronger of their victims.

==History==
Sent to the [[Material Plane]] to eat and grow, Kempfana and his brother Ulgulu made their home in the cave of a [[hill giant]] named [[Lagerbottoms]] in the [[Silver Marches]], where they could safely mature before returning to their home plane.

Around [[1340 DR]], the barghests sent their main force of [[gnoll]]s to capture the father and eldest son of the [[Thistledown (family)|Thistledown]] family, but raiders never returned. Ulgulu and his brother sent [[Nathak]] to scout out what happened and he returned reporting their raiding party of five gnolls were dead. After that, Ulgulu sent his [[quickling]] ally, [[Tephanis]], to discover exactly what had happened. When Tephanis returned, he told them a newly surfaced [[drow]], [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], had slain the monsters. In a rage, Ulgulu asked the quickling steal one of Drizzt's [[scimitar]]s.<ref> After receiving the blade, Ulgulu used his shape-changing abilities to make himself appear as a drow and attacked the Thistledown farmstead. After slaying the residents, he left the broken scimitar to incriminate Drizzt as the killer of the family.<ref>

When Drizzt learned what had happened, he and [[Guenhwyvar]] attacked the cave's inhabitants, destroying the two barghests and many of their goblin allies. Kempfana held Drizzt by the neck and attempted to bite his head off, excited at the prospect of perhaps maturing enough to go back to Gehenna. However, Drizzt stabbed him through the mouth and brain, killing him instead.
