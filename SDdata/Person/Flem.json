The usurper chief Pujik allied himself with the cultists, while Retha, the old leader, was trying to stop the evil ormyrr. Flem was uncorrupted and remained loyal to the tribes true leader. Subsequently, a group of heroes, the Veiled Ones, slew Pujik and freed the tribe from the Cults corruption. In reward, Flem offered the heroes his expansive knowledge of the old stories and legends that led the heroes to some powerful enchanted items hidden within the ruins of the City of Song."
