Marlazander was the bodyguard of Rothglar Illance in the late 15 century DR.
Marlazander was an immense, musclebound man, whose face reflected cold menace. He was also tall.
He could get somewhat touchy-feely with associates, gloated needlessly, and was a little quick to run away.
He was the bodyguard of Rothglar Illance.
Marlazander accompanied his master, Rothglar Illance, to the Open Feast of  on Mirtul 26. He was also spotted later with Verrin, one of rival noblemans Marlin Stormserpents men, during the latters attempt to steal the Wyverntongue Chalice from Castle Obarskyr in Suzail. Before he could do anything to Marlin, the latter unleashed his trained stirge, Thirsty, which slew Verrin immediately Marlazander tried to flee, but was cut down by the undead knight Targrael before he got very far.
