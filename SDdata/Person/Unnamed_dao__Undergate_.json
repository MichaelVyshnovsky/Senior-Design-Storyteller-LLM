What I am is a most noble dao genie, humiliatingly reduced to the role of simple entry guard for that damnable Kajeel.

        "Description": "This particular dao was a giant [[elemental]] creature of earth, who towered over most inhabitants of the Undergate. He appeared typical to the rest of his people. However, his body language communicated the man was thoroughly deflated. The dao had somewhat crude [[orc]]ish features and a balding head. He wore ivory-colored [[robe]]s.",
        "Personality": "Despite his servitude, the dao retained his sarcastic sense of humor and regularly bad-mouthed his tentacled master.",
        "History": "Before becoming an inhabitant of Westgate, the dao was a noble [[genie]] from the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]. He had one too many drinks one night and challenged [[Kajeel]], the [[psion]] Master of Undergate, to a game of cards. The confident genie bet a hundred years of servitude against the psion's rowdy tavern underneaths the streets of Westgate. To no surprise, gambling against a creature who could read minds was a bad idea, and the unnamed dao lost. He was tasked with guarding the magical ''[[gate]]'' that led into Kajeel's establishment, allowing only those with a special token in, and only those especially picked by the [[illithid]] psion received the tokens."
