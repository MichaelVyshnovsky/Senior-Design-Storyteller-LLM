        "mainbody": "The unnamed dao of Undergate was a servant of the so-called Master of Undergate in the late 14 century DR.\nThis particular dao was a giant elemental creature of earth, who towered over most inhabitants of the Undergate. He appeared typical to the rest of his people. However, his body language communicated the man was thoroughly deflated. The dao had somewhat crude orcish features and a balding head. He wore ivory-colored robes.\nDespite his servitude, the dao retained his sarcastic sense of humor and regularly bad-mouthed his tentacled master.\nBefore becoming an inhabitant of Westgate, the dao was a noble genie from the Elemental Plane of Earth. He had one too many drinks one night and challenged Kajeel, the psion Master of Undergate, to a game of cards. The confident genie bet a hundred years of servitude against the psions rowdy tavern underneaths the streets of Westgate. To no surprise, gambling against a creature who could read minds was a bad idea, and the unnamed dao lost. He was tasked with guarding the magical gate that led into Kajeels establishment, allowing only those with a special token in, and only those especially picked by the illithid psion received the tokens."
