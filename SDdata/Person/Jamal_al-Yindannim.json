        "mainbody": "'''Jamal al-Yindannim''' was a ranking member of the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]] in [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}",
        "Description": "Jamal was tall at {{SI|6'2|'\"|c}}. He was handsome and strong and appeared to be in his early twenties. His dark hair was cropped short. He consumed several ''[[Potion of longevity|potions of longevity]]'' to maintain his youthful appearance.",
        "Activities": "Jamal served as lord of the fortress of [[Krak al-Niraan]], commanding an impressive array of the Brotherhood's forces and maintaining strong control in that region of the Land of Fate.",
        "Possessions": "Jamal owned a ''[[wand of the sun]]'', ''[[ring of genie summoning]]'', ''[[sash of fire resistance]]'', and a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]''. His white ''[[aba]]'' was fire-proofed and was enchanted with ''[[deeppockets]]''. Within his robe was stored his [[material component]]s, [[spellbook]], six [[smoke sphere]]s, four [[greek fire]] projectiles, and potions of ''[[Potion of extra-healing|extra-healing]]'', ''[[Philter of glibness|glibness]]'', ''[[potion of love|love]]'', and a vial of ''[[Starella's aphrodisiac]]''. Jamal also wielded a pair of poisoned ''[[jambiya]]s'' and poisoned [[dart]]s.",
        "Abilities": "Though still a skilled [[Elemental mage|flame mage]], Jamal's advancement in the elemental arts was slowed by his romantic and militaristic pursuits. When he grew bored of his latest romantic conquest, he \"retired\" her to a special ''harim'' where he used the women to create sinister [[nasnas]] that were completely loyal to him.",
        "Relationships": "In addition to the poor women sentenced to his overflowing ''harim'', Jamal had two wivesâ€“[[Najeeya bint Siddiq]] and [[Qumasha al-Arus]].\n\nOne of Jamal's enchanted rings gave him command over a [[warmonger genie]] named [[Khaizuran]].",
        "History": "Jamal studied [[magic]] at the university in [[Qadib]]. He was particularly interested in [[fire magic]]. He enjoyed seducing married women of his fellow students while studying at the university. This behavior led to many sorcerous confrontations with irate husbands, but Jamal always came out on top. It was this nasty reputation that first led the Brotherhood of the True Flame to contact him.\n\nJamal was tasked by the [[Bonfire]] to secure a fortress within the Haunted Lands. This was easily accomplished with the help of Khaizuran. The fortress would be renamed Krak al-Niraan, or the \"Castle of Fire.\""
