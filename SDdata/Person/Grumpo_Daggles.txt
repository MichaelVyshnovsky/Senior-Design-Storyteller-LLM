'''"Grumpo" Daggles''' was a middle class inhabitant of the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''It's supposed to be safe past the gate - if they ever let anyone in. Bastards.''|"Grumpo" Daggles}}

==Description==
Daggles was a foppish [[human]] man who wore clothes of fine quality and a big feathered beret. He had a light skin tone, hazel eyes, and long brown hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, the gates between the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate and its more affluent [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] were closed, monitored by the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries and allowing only the wealthy and current residents of the Upper City through. "Grumpo" Daggles was among the Baldurians who sought passage to the Upper City, suffering through the long lines and rude Fists. He was ready to give up the wait after spending half a day in the queue.
