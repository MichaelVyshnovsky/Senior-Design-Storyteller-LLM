Muren was a dwarf girl that lived in the town of Womford with her parents during the late 15 century DR.
She was a sweet girl but was wholly uncoordinated.
Muren worked as a barmaid at the Friendly Bat inn and tavern, as establishment owned by her parents.
Her parents were Grunnald and Mae.
Sometime during the 1490s DR, Murens father Grunnald faked his death, and joined the Pale Claw bandit gang. The gang had previously taken over the town, extorting the people for their riches to offer up to their patron Glyrgoth. Muren and Mae were heartbroken, but tried to carry on his legacy at the Friendly Bat. They even built an effigy of him and displayed it proudly in the establishment.
After a band of adventurers made their way through Womford, and routed the Pale Claw, Muren was reunited with her father. Grunnald explained that he only joined the gang to help direct the gang away from targeting townsfolk. Regardless of his intent, the reunion was something of a bittersweet affair.
