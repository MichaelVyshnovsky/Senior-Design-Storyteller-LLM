        "mainbody": "Amphail Caradoon, known as Amphail the Just, was a paladin in the service of Tyr. War Lord of Waterdeep during the 10 century DR.\nAmphail was the middle of three Caradoon brothers. The oldest brother was Renwick Caradoon, a noted wizard, and the youngest brother was Samular Caradoon. Amphail and Samular were both paladins in the service of Tyr. The three possessed three magical rings later known as rings of Samular.\nAt the onset of the Second Trollwar in the , the three brothers were able to use the rings of Samular to operate a magical siege engine called Kezefbane. They used it most effectively against the trolls and ended their siege of Waterdeep. Having displayed leadership and valor, Amphail was afterward named War Lord of the city. He succeeded Gharl, successor to Nimoar.\nAt one point, he retrieved Gurts greataxe from its burial in Morgurs Mound, and took it back to Waterdeep.\nBut his reign lasted only one year as he was killed in a raid by the trolls. He was succeeded by another five War Lords before the end of that twelve-year-long conflict. Without Amphail, Kezefbane was not nearly as effective.\nThe village of Amphail was named after him, as hed owned estates there, though his keep was since lost without a trace. His ghost was still said to to ride the land here and to scare away trolls and barbarians. Also known as the \"Ghost of Amphail\", most visitors heard the tale and most residents dismissed it as an attempt to add some attraction, veteran guards swore to having seen him patrolling the streets. Local baker Halana Shauluth declared Amphails ghost had frightened off thieves whod tried to rob her early on morning and rode after them, even tilting a wide-brimmed in greeting to her as he went by."
