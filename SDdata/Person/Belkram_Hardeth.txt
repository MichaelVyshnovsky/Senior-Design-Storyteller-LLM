'''Belkram''' was a member of the [[Harpers]] and one of the [[Rangers Three]].

==History==
Belkram was born in [[Baldur's Gate]] to sailors on the ''[[Dancing Dolphin]]'' ship. His parents were killed by pirates when Belkram was twelve years old and he decided to go adventure. He became the battle-buddy of [[Itharr Jathram|Itharr]], fighting some members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[Daggerford]].

After that battle, the [[Master Harper]] [[Osryk]] proposed that they join the Harpers and they agreed. They went to [[Berdusk]] for training but they did not fit well with [[Obslin Minstrelwish]] and decided to go on solitary adventures.

In [[1358 DR]], he was training together Itharr under [[Storm Silverhand]] in [[Shadowdale]] when [[Elminster Aumar]] and ranger [[Sharantyr]] entered a mysterious ''[[gate]]''. Worried, Storm asked Itharr and Belkram to follow and lead them. They joined forces with El and Shar first to fight the [[Zhentarim]] in [[High Dale]] and later with the Rangers Three to contest the [[malaugrym]]s' plots during the [[Time of Troubles]].

==Personality==
Belkram was the hot-head of the group. He liked brawls and his preferred weapons were tables and chairs.
