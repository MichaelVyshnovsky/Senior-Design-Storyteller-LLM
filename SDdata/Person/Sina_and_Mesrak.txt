Sina and Mesrak was an ettin afflicted with the werebat form of lycanthropy in the late 14 Century DR.
Due to their strain of lycanthropy, Sina and Mesrak were capable of summoning and directing swarms of bats.
Sina and Mesrak were known to possess two +2 bastard swords, four masterwork javelins, a cloak of resistance +2, and a ring of protection +2.
Some time in the late 14 Century, Sina and Mesrak were recruited by the shrieking hag, Stavrala Nazaerlyth, for her plot to ruin the reputation of Samulbrar Chaseris and ultimately cause his downfall. As part of this plan, they terrorized the citizens of Agmoth county.
When Stavrala and her minions finally roused the citizenry into a violent mob to assault the Samulbrar Estate, Stavrala contacted Sina and Mesrak through use of shadow talk. With their signal received, they swooped onto the walls surrounding the manor and directed their bat swarms upon the crowd. They then shrieked in defiance and swooped down to attack the crowd head-on. Under Stavralas plan, their presence was meant to further cement the notion that Samulbrar was a vampire.
