Runelord Thaun Khelbor was a Loremaster of Deneir and high priest of the faith in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR.
In the , during the abraxus affair, Khelbor supervised the Deneirrath priests among those tending to the survivors and victims of the abraxus attack King Azoun IV, Duke Bhereu Ammaeth, Baron Thomdor Ammaeth, and others. Khelbor treated the king himself, but was unable to cure him. He argued against leaching blood. He was later among a group of important priests assembled by Vangerdahast to continue treating the sick and investigating the abraxus.
Thaun was balding yet retained patches of dense grey hair over his ears that made him look comical but kindly.
Thaun was old and a gentle sort, but had a touch of pride.
Thaun owned a dark ebony staff engraved with runes. Around the tip crackled small lightning bolts.
