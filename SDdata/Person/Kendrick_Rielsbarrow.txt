'''Kendrick Rielsbarrow''' was the speaker of [[Good Mead]], one of the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]], during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He died at the hands of a verbeeg marauder in 1489 DR.

==Description==
Speaker Rielsbarrow could easily be described as a "gentle giant". He was an affable, well-meaning man that was an impressive 7 feet (2.1 meters) in height. While he loved nothing more than talking with the folks of the Ten Towns he did somewhat resemble the towny version of a [[Reghedmen]] tribesman.

==Activities==
He spent much of his time traveling to the other settlements of the Ten Towns, chatting and drinking with folks, and selling the famous [[mead]] that gave his town its name.{{Cite dungeon/220/King of the Wolves|33}}
