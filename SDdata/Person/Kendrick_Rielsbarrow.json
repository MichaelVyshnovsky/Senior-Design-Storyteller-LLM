        "mainbody": "Kendrick Rielsbarrow was the speaker of Good Mead, one of the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale, during the late 15 century DR. He died at the hands of a verbeeg marauder in 1489 DR.\nSpeaker Rielsbarrow could easily be described as a \"gentle giant\". He was an affable, well-meaning man that was an impressive 7 feet (2.1 meters) in height. While he loved nothing more than talking with the folks of the Ten Towns he did somewhat resemble the towny version of a Reghedmen tribesman.\nHe spent much of his time traveling to the other settlements of the Ten Towns, chatting and drinking with folks, and selling the famous mead that gave his town its name."
