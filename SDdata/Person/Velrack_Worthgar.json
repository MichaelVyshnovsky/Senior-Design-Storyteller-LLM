He financed privateering ships that targeted vessels on behalf of those who had coin and could afford the illicit activity. His sizable mansion stood in one of the most affluent districts of Athkatla â€“ the westerly part of the Gem District on the Four Fountains Lane, across the street from the Hallowturrets House."
