'''Raidon Kane''' was a [[Shou]] [[half-elf|half]]â€“[[star elf]] [[monk]] and a [[Keeper of the Cerulean Sign]] of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|Raidon, you are the Key of Stars! [...] And the Key must turn, one last time!}}

==History==
Raidon was trained as a monk at the [[Xiang]] monastery in [[Telflamm]]

Raidon, whose [[Cerulean Sign]] fused with his body during the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], rescued the multiverse by preventing the awakening of "The [[Eldest]]" [[aboleth]] and preventing [[Malyanna]] from unlocking the [[Far Manifold]] and opening the portal between the [[Far Realm]] and the [[Feywild]]. Although he died at the [[Citadel of the Outer Void]], a place from where the Gods couldn't claim the soul of a mortal, his soul was probably saved.

==Relations==
Raidon's friends and allies included the "dream-mage" [[Anusha Marhana]]; the star-pact [[warlock]] [[Japheth Donard]]; Captain [[Thoster]], a scion of [[Dagon]]; and the [[githyanki]] [[psion]] [[Yeva]].
