        "mainbody": "'''Darya Scattertrail''' was an unlucky [[gnome]] [[druid]] [[adventurer]] from the [[High Forest]] [[druidic circle]] in [[Northwest Faerûn]], active sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Possessions": "Darya's adventuring gear included a pair of [[enchanted]] [[boots]], later known as ''[[Scattertrail boots]]''.",
        "History": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Darya Scattertrail was initiated into the druidic circle of the High Forest. Several years later, she and her adventuring companions found themselves opposing a rogue [[Red Wizards of Thay]] who sought to tap into the dark powers of the [[Hellgate Keep]]. Despite the wizard's powerful sorcery, Darya's group used their knowledge of the terrain to trap the mage against an impassible ridge. The adventurers ended the Red Wizard's guards with ease, but the mage was not easy prey. He unleashed deadly [[spell]]s that immobilized the gnome's troupe and summoned [[demon]]s that devoured all the adventurers apart from Darya Scattertrail. Terrified, the druid used her boots' magics to flee, leaving her companions to their fate. Eventually, her panic subsided, leaving nothing but shame in Darya's heart. The woman threw all of her adventuring gear to the ground and forever left the High Forest. Sometime later, she was seen living in peace in a small village a day's ride from [[Silverymoon]], repairing pottery for a fee of twenty [[copper]]s.\n\nDarya's ''Scattertrail boots'' found their way into the hands of [[Dayne Lynneth]], a merchant from [[Tyr's Eye]] plaza in the [[Blacklake District]] of [[Neverwinter]] in 1374 DR."
