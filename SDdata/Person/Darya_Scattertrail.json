Several years later, she and her adventuring companions found themselves opposing a rogue Red Wizards of Thay who sought to tap into the dark powers of the Hellgate Keep. Despite the wizards powerful sorcery, Daryas group used their knowledge of the terrain to trap the mage against an impassible ridge. The adventurers ended the Red Wizards guards with ease, but the mage was not easy prey. He unleashed deadly spells that immobilized the gnomes troupe and summoned demons that devoured all the adventurers apart from Darya Scattertrail. Terrified, the druid used her boots magics to flee, leaving her companions to their fate. Eventually, her panic subsided, leaving nothing but shame in Daryas heart. The woman threw all of her adventuring gear to the ground and forever left the High Forest. Sometime later, she was seen living in peace in a small village a days ride from Silverymoon, repairing pottery for a fee of twenty coppers.\nDaryas Scattertrail boots found their way into the hands of Dayne Lynneth, a merchant from Tyrs Eye plaza in the Blacklake District of Neverwinter in 1374 DR."
