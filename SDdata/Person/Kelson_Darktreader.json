He really like being a guide for the dukes hunts or teaching the secrets of the wild to young rangers. His decision to go against the Thayans had less to do with fighting evil but more with protecting Shalendra Floshin and showing her that his half-elf blood was worth more than she once thought. Kelson, however, also couldnt resist the idea of a last mission against the forces of evil.\nKelson was the grandson of Elorfindar Floshin and a nephew of Darfin Floshin. He worked as hunt master for the dukes of Daggerford for generations, starting with Duke Pryden Daggerford.\nIn 1486 DR, he agreed to a last mission against the Red Wizards of Thay based in Daggerford.\nHis home in Daggerford was located along the northern stretch of Wall Street near Delfens Tower."
