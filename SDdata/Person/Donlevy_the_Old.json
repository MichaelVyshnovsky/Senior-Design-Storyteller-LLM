        "mainbody": "'''Donlevy BelMaris''', known as '''Donlevy the Old''', was the 18{{th}} Baron of [[Polten]] in [[Damara]].",
        "Personality": "Donlevy was wise and cautious.",
        "Relationships": "Donlevy the Old was a member of the noble [[House BelMaris]]. He was beloved by the people of Polten.",
        "History": "When the [[Vaasan War]] began in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}, Donlevy recognized that [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] was no ordinary foe, and that the war could only end in a bloodbath. Fearing this, he arranged for his two year-old son, [[Donlevy the Young]], to go into hiding as a farmer's child, and then arranged a mock funeral to make sure his heir stayed hidden.\n\nAs Donlevy had predicted, after Zhengyi slew Damara's King, [[Virdin Bloodfeathers]], at the [[Ford of Goliad]] in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, he sent assassins to slaughter the ruling families of the realm. Donlevy was killed, along with every single member of House BelMaris save for the hidden heir. In Donlevy the Old's place, Zhengyi installed a puppet and pretender to the family lineage, [[Zorth BelMaris]]."
