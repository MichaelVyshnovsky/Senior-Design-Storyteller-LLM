        "mainbody": "ris was a gentle-natured and trusting stone giant artist and subsequesntly rescued by a group of adventurers led by Melegaunt Tanthul and Galaeron Nihmedu. Aris adventures saw him travel across the Heartlands, from his home in the mountains,\nAs a giant, Aris was quite taller than many of his friends and fellow traveling companions. He always seemed to have a dour and severe look about him with sad eyes that belied his immense creativity and skill.\nThe gentle giant was a true and loyal friend, even to those not worthy of his comradery. He was very observant and quite insightful at times, capable of seeing things in situations that others missed.\nAris was a masterful sculptor, one that could chisel out breathtaking depictions in a brief amount of time.\nUpon leaving his home, Aris only possession were his stone-carving tools and a wooden club, the latter of which he was forced to surrender upon entrance into the High Forest. After settling down some time later, Aris reacquired a set stone carving tools.\nAris spent much of his time working on sculptures, often made to honor the spirit and deeds of people in his life. He worked exceptionally fast and could create a finished piece in a fraction of the time of other sculptors.\nDuring their adventures together, Aris became close to the increasingly volatile elven shadow adept Galaeron Nihmedu as well as the disingenuous and exploitative follower of Cyric, Malik el Sami. Aris believed himself to owe a life debt to the unscrupulous Malik, and remained by his side during very perilous times.\nIn the , nearly all the stone giants of Thousand Faces were killed by beholders allied with the phaerimm that escaped from behind the Sharn Wall underneath Anauroch. Aris survived and taken captive with charm-magic for a time by the eye tyrant Kanabar. The lone giant was freed from his magical bondage when a band of travelers, comprising Galaeron Nihmedu, Melegaunt Tanthul, Vala Thorsdotter and Malik el Sami, killed the beholder and its allies. \nAs his communitys only survivor, Aris accompanied his rescuers as they traveled towards the Delimbiyr Vale through the High Forest, granted special disposition by Turlang himself, passing through the Dire Wood until their final destination at the ancient city of Karse. Once there, Aris bravely dug a deep tunnel that drew the phaerimm away from his new friends long enough for them complete a ritual to bring back Melegaunts home city from the plane of Shadow. Aris was tortured by the aberrant creatures and just barely managed to survive the ordeal.\nAris survived the ordeal and soon relocated to the city of Thultanthar with Malik, Galaeron, and Vala. He found immediate success within the city, impressing even the Princes of Shade and the mighty archmage, High Prince Telamont Tanthul himself. While traveling across the Saiyaddar Aris suffered greatly from dehydration, a condition that was made worse by the selfish actions of his friend Galaeron. The giant was nearly killed during an attack from a blue dragon, but survived by the efforts of the witch Ruha. Aris near-death experience shook Galaeron, pulling him back from the malign influence of his shadow self.\nOnce Aris was in better condition, he traveled with Galaeron and Ruha to Arabel in Cormyr. His arrival was welcomed and even celebrated by Myrmeen Lhal, who was a great fan of his artistry. Despite this, the trio were accused of theft by Prince Rivalen Tanthul of Thultanthar, and imprisoned within the Citadel. While in the dungeons of the Citadel, Rivalen and his Shadovar attempted to free the group from their cells—to take them back to Thultanthar—but were intercepted by Myrmeen Lhal, Regent Alusair Obarskyr and her royal retinue. She executed several of the Shadovar on the spot, and ensured Aris and his friends were safe.\nAris returned the favor to the Lady Regent and Cormyr by assisting the Mage Royal Vangerdahast by transporting a powerful magical contraption into and through the city of Tilverton while it was under siege by the Shadovar. Aris was taken to safety before the city fell, and—having made amends with his friend Galaeron—offered the elf a friendly and fond farewell before the city was ultimately destroyed."
