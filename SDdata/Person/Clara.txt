{{Quote|''"My name is...Hexxat. Not Clara. I need to get to...Dragomir's tomb."''|Clara}}

==Description==
When speaking to others, she seemed scared or mentally unwell, with many pauses in her speech.

==History==
Clara had a rather unremarkable early life growing up on a farm. Some time later she moved to the city of [[Athkatla]] with the hopes of becoming a stage actress. After earning a meager living as a [[Courtesan (prostitute)|courtesan]] for some time, she learned some thieving skills and embarked upon the life that accompanied them.

As of early {{YearlinkName|1369}} she was imprisoned by the [[Flaming Fist]] within their headquarters in [[Baldur's Gate]].

She traveled back to Athkatla later that year, and was subsequently ''[[Dominate person|dominated]]'' by the [[vampire]] [[Hexxat]]. The vampire compelled Clara to stay at the [[Copper Coronet]] tavern in order to find a group to aid her. Referring to herself as 'Hexxat', Clara sought to journey into the tomb of the being known as [[Dragomir|Dragomir the Red]]. She promised prospective guardians they could find great treasure within the tomb.
