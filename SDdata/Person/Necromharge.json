        "mainbody": "'''Necromharge''' was an enigmatic evil [[mage]] who terrorized the [[the North]] in [[1358 DR]].",
        "History": "Around 1358 DR, Necromharge was the leader of an army of organized bands of [[undead]] that ravaged major trade routes throughout the North. The undead within these bands included [[skeleton]]s, [[spectre]]s, [[wight]]s, and [[zombie]]s.\n\nThese undead would kill those that they encountered, then steal both their valuables and their bodies. The latter of course were used to swell their ranks. Eventually, the [[Lords' Alliance]] put out a bounty on Necromharge. Their ultimate fate was unknown."
