        "mainbody": "'''Maura Silverhand''' was a [[human]] inhabitant of [[Evermeet]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was a daughter of [[Laeral Silverhand]] conceived during her period of madness under the ''[[Crown of Horns]]''.{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/Lore Look: Laeral Silverhand}} Maura was the wife of [[Lamruil Moonflower]] and the Princess of [[Auseriel]].",
        "History": "In the [[1371 DR|Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR]], Maura was a mature teenager who became the consort of Prince Lamruil of Evermeet and assisted him to create the hidden city Auseriel.\n\nOn [[Mirtul 2]], the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Auseriel was [[Rage of Dragons|besieged]] by a family of [[white dragon]]s led by the [[great wyrm]] [[Harashalthyn]]. At her insistence, she had her husband Lamruil bring the ''[[Tree of Souls]]'' back to Evermeet. He and a band of elf knights returned on [[Mirtul 4]], but found the city abandoned amid a dozen white dragon corpses, and no sign of his wife or her troops. Lamruil vowed to rebuild the Auseriel and began a search for Maura.<ref>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1380}}, Lamruil and his new friend the high mage [[Araevin Teshurr]] left Auseriel in search of the missing Princess Maura, set on the trail by the mysterious [[Divination|prophecy]] revealed by Araevin's magic.<ref>",
        "Relationships": "Maura was the daughter of Laeral Silverhand. Her father remained unknown to both her and her mother. Maura was conceived, apparently with [[Mystra]]'s blessing, while Laeral was suffering from madness induced by the ''Crown of Horns'' sometime between {{Yearlink|1337}} and {{Yearlink|1357}}.\n\nShe was the eldest child of Laeral. She was followed by her two half-siblings, the twins [[Kamaulra Arunsun|Kamaulra]] and [[Krehlan Arunsun]], who were conceived by Laeral and [[Khelben Arunsun]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}."
