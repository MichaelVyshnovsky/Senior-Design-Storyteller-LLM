'''Nethglas Stormserpent''' was a heir of House [[Stormserpent]] in the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He stole the [[Wyverntongue Chalice]] as a prank, and later accompanied [[Emvar Obarskyr]] on the day of their deaths.

==Description==
Nethglas had a strong nose and a mustache.

==Personality==
To his little brother Marlin, he was unpleasant and [[shark]]-like.

==Relationships==
He was the son of [[Narmitra Stormserpent]]. He was the eldest of four siblings, followed by [[Elgrym Stormserpent|Elgrym]], [[Marlin Stormserpent|Marlin]], and [[Rondras Stormserpent]].

==History==
As a youthful prank, Nethglas Stormserpent stole the ''[[Wyverntongue Chalice]]'' from the [[Room of the Red Banner]] and hid it instead near the [[Dragonskull Chamber]], both in [[Castle Obarskyr]]. He told his three brothers about it, and meant to brag about it more, but instead he began to fear consequences and swore them to secrecy. When his brother Elgrym told [[Nael Rowanmantle]], Nethglas had the two of them killed in what he later characterized as an "unfortunate accident" to his two remaining brothers.

He was slain later while accompanying [[Emvar Obarskyr]] in the [[Vast Swamp]], where they were ambushed by [[Sembia]]n forces{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|17}}
