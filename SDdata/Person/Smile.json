        "Description": "She wore a black hood.",
        "Abilities": "Smile preferred to snipe at her victims with her bow.",
        "Possessions": "Smile wielded a ''+1 [[composite shortbow]]'' and a masterwork [[rapier]], wore [[studded leather]] armor, and carried ''[[potion]] of [[invisibility]]'' and a ''potion of [[cure light wounds]]''.",
        "History": "Smile was the sister of [[Smote]], a rogue and [[wizard]] of similar bent.\n\nIn 1374 DR, Smile and her partner, [[Londal Fen]], were employed by Lady [[Naedaenya Arthas|Arthas]] of the [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]]. Smile persuaded Smote to attend the temple and participate in the rite of Mystra's Sacred Trust there. This ended in Smote being [[Dominate person|''dominated'']] by the ''[[Starry Gnosis]]'' and abducted as part of a secret [[Shar]]ran plot. Smote later wasn't sure if he should take revenge on his sister for this or not.\n\nIf adventurers investigating the strange behavior of the [[cleric]]s of [[Mystra]] there attacked the temple, then she would pay the pair 830 [[gp]] to ambush them. Smile and Londal would lure the adventurers into an ambush among the waterfront warehouses at [[23 Impil Street]], or otherwise keep tabs on them to ambush and murder them out of sight. She would even set a net trap against them, but would flee if the fight went against her."
