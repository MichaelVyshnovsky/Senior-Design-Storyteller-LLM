'''Malharduu''' was an [[archmage]] of [[Tashluta]] in [[Tashalar]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

''Circa'' [[1357]] DR, Malharduu apparently purchased the ''[[Book of Bats]]'' and made arrangements to have it shipped to Tashluta. However, in summer, the ship carrying the book was looted by thieves before it could leave the dock in [[Calimport]]. The fate of the book remained unknown.This was "last summer", but the exact date of the sources is unknown, so it is unclear if this is summer of [[1356 DR]], of 1357, or of some other year.
