Malharduu was an archmage of Tashluta in Tashalar in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Circa 1357 DR, Malharduu apparently purchased the Book of Bats and made arrangements to have it shipped to Tashluta. However, in summer, the ship carrying the book was looted by thieves before it could leave the dock in Calimport. The fate of the book remained unknown.This was "last summer", but the exact date of the sources is unknown, so it is unclear if this is summer of 1356 DR, of 1357, or of some other year.
