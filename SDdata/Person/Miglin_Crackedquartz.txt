Miglin Crackedquartz was a deep gnome in Blingdenstone.
When not acting as a guide, Miglin wandered the city making, notes about the caverns and passages.
In 1479 DR, Kargien Dissengulp sent Miglin to act as a guide for an adventuring party hed hired in tunnels toward the Wormwrithings.
Miglin was a gruff and acerbic individual. He was more interested in gemstones than people, even offering to the people that employed him reports about the various properties of every rock he saw.
