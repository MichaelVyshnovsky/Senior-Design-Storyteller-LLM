'''''Malfeem Despana''''' was once the weapon master and patron of [[House Despana]]. He was the father of [[Malavon Despana]].

==Possessions==
Malfeem Despana owned a fine House Despana ''[[piwafwi]]'', which was made out of [[spider]] silk with incredibly flexible [[adamantite]] filigree. The house glyph was featured on the back of the cloak.

==History==
Malfeem was a short-lived and ill-fated member of House Despana. However, in his time, he gained much influence. He died during an attack on a rival house in [[1262 DR]]. It was rumored that the daughters of House Despana plotted and engineered Malfeem's death. The daughters believed that he had gained too much influence over the house's [[Matron mother]]. A decade later, Matron Despana's new patron wore the cloak for a single night. The sentiment of Malfeem had not gone away, and the new patron was flayed to death.
