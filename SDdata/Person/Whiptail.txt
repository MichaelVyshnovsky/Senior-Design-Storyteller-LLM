Whiptail was a lizardfolk member of the Muckmarsh tribe in Twilight Marsh near Phlan in 1489 DR.
Whiptail was very resolute but believed heavily in superstitions. She spoke to her weapons, especially her chosen dagger. She would not explain to anyone why that weapon was so important to her.
In 1489 DR, Whiptail acted as an escort for her chieftain Bogclaw and shaman Scalesneer to a meeting with adventurers. However, they were attacked by a group of will-o-wisps and Whiptail was one of the few survivors. She was chosen to guide the adventurers to the lair of Throstulgrael.
