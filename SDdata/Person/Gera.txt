'''Gera''' was a villager of [[Highcliff]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Gera was first found in [[Weeping Willow Inn]], where asked of [[Kalach-Cha]] to rescue her husband, [[Zachan]]. Once Zachan is rescued, both of them head for [[Highcliff]].

The second time Gera is found is in Highcliff, where she and her huband worry about their sons, [[Alex]] and [[Andrew]]. If the boys were saved from wolves at [[Highcliff Castle]], Zachan admits he told his sons stories to give them more confidence. Nevertheless, he and his wife would reward the Kalach-Cha.

The last time Gera is found is on the way to Highcliff once the King of Shadows made his attack. Zachan and Gera would thank the Kalach-Cha and explain what is going on in Highcliff. They were never seen again.
