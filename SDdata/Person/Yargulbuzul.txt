'''Yargulbuzul''' was an [[imp]] and a sadistic [[warlock patron]] from the [[Abyss]], who, at one point, granted power to [[Sholsarrath the Lame]], a [[kobold]] [[warlock]] of the [[Skulking Dragon]] clan, some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Sholsarrath, a kobold shaman, entered a warlock's pact with Yargulbuzul, sacrificing a finger and a foot in exchange for power and to avoid a gruesome death. Now known as Sholsarrath the Lame, the kobold took over the Skulking Dragon clan and began raiding nearby farming communities, including the village of [[Houndstown]]. The raids attracted the attention of five [[adventurer]]s who slaughtered the strongest kobolds with ease. Desperate once again to escape sure doom, Sholsarrath the Lame evoked Yargulbuzul's name once again, demanding salvation and a way to escape. Yargulbuzul claimed that it would be a tough feat to accomplish and demanded one last payment from the kobold, a payment greater than anything he paid before. The dim-witted warlock agreed frantically to Yargulbuzul's demandâ€”the kobold's own head. When the five adventurers reached the shaman's lair, they witnessed a happy imp decapitating Sholsarrath and carrying his soul to the [[Abyss]]. That head would become the ''[[Head of the Lame Kobold]]'', an [[enchanted]] [[helmet]] for warlocks.
