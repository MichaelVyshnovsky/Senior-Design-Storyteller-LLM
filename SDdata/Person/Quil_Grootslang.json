        "mainbody": "'''Quil Grootslang''' was a [[dragonborn]] [[minstrel]] who traveled through the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Quil was a na√Øve daydreamer in search of real love.",
        "Relationships": "In the late 15th century DR, the [[Nashkel Inn]] hosted a performance by Quil. After the performance, her evening was occupied by chatting with her new admirer, [[Flaming Fist]] [[Orvil]]. The man later pre-ordered a copy of her love-chants songbook, which was due to be released in 1492 DR. That year, his beheaded corpse was found at the [[Murder Tribunal]] in Baldur's Gate, carrying an unfinished letter titled ''Dear Quil''. According to the letter, Orvil aimed to confess his love and arrange a meeting with Quil at the [[Blushing Mermaid]].",
        "History": "Quil Grootslang was born in [[Tymanther]]. She ran from her homeland to avoid the marital union her family arranged for her and the [[Thymari#Sexuality_and_marriage|\"egg-duty\"]]. Quil journeyed to the Sword Coast, where she lived for some time. She'd been robbed several times, as she had no martial skills with which to protect herself.\n\nAfter her clan-name was struck, she named herself after a long-dead poet<ref group=\"note\">The surname of Quil Grootslang may have its roots in a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grootslang legendary creature] with the same name in the real world, described as an enormous serpent residing in the deep caves of Richtersveld, South Africa. and performed dragonborn love-chants that were not widely known on the Sword Coast.\n\nFor many years during her travels, she prepared a manuscript of new love-chants titled ''[[Affairs in Ancient Abeir: Songs of Draconic Love]]''. Half of her performances were for a member of the [[Society of Brilliance]] who was writing a book about dragonborn society at that time.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, she was on her way to [[Baldur's Gate]] with her manuscript for it to be published. On her way through the wilderness not far from [[Moonhaven]] she was singing ''[[Hatchling Love]]'' when some [[goblin]]s stole her [[horse]].\n\nNothing was known of her further journeys. Some people assumed that she was killed somewhere along the [[river Chionthar]] by another [[Dark Urge|dragonborn]].{{Speculation}}",
        "Abilities": "She was a talented throat-singer in Tymantheran style known at least among other dragonborn bards such as [[Lyrix Goldthroat]].<ref group=\"note\">Inquired about Quil's songs, Lyrix Goldthroat confidently responds with \"Of course I do,\" suggesting that Quil was a well-known musician. Quil sometimes whistled when she snored."
