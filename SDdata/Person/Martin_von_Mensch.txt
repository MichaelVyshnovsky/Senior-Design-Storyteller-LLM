'''Martin von Mensch''' was the  ex-adventurer owner of [[Conyberry Arms]] within the village of [[Conyberry]].

==Personality==
Never content with just ripping off his customers, Martin enjoyed creating items which would break and selling them at market prices. Martin's endeavors all revolved around looking only for new means to increase his hoard of treasure and wealth. This included having an invisible thief walk around his store adding to his ill gained fortune. 

==History==
Around [[1367 DR]], Martin decided to have an invisible [[thief]] to walk around with a ''[[invisibility|ring of invisibility]]'' stealing small objects off unsuspecting customers in the shop. During this time villagers guessed at possible identities of the thief, one included a famous [[Waterdeep]] burglar who was taken in by von Mensch, because he permanently caused himself to be invisible.
