        "mainbody": "Arunika was a succubus devil in the midâ€“15 century DR and one of the major players in the struggle to claim Neverwinter from the ashes of the cataclysm that tore the city apart and plunged several factions into contention.\nWorking indirectly, Arunika planned to weaken the warring factions of Thay and the Shadovar by playing them off one another until such a time as they were easy picking for the Abolethic Sovereignty.\nInitially, in the Year of the Reborn Hero, 1463 DR, Arunika sided with Herzgo Alegni, the Shadovar representative in Neverwinter, thinking he was the most likely to come out on top. Things quickly changed, however, when Sylora Salm was defeated by Drizzt DoUrden and Dahlia Sinfelle, which effectively removed Thay from the equation.\nArunika changed her plans after this. She sensed that Alegni was up against forces that even he could not hope to overcome accordingly, she shifted her intentions. In the ensuing showdown in 1463 DR, Arunika failed to come to the aid of her ally, instead searching for further information on the dark elf through contacts in the Abyss. As a result, Alegni was defeated at the hands of Drizzt, Dahlia, and Artemis Entreri. She continued to make moves from behind the scenes to pave the way for the Sovereignty. However, for her illicit relationship with Alegni, Arunika was killed by Brother Anthus.\nArunika had a sister, also in league with the Sovereignty, by the name of Rohini. In 1478 DR, she was subsumed by the artifact known as the Hex Locus."
