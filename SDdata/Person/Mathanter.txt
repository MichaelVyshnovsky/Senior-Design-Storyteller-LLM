'''Mathanter of Sembia''' was a member of the [[Rightful Conspiracy]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During the [[Marsember]] meeting of the [[Rightful Conspiracy]] in early spring of {{yearlink|1373}}, Mathanter of [[Sembia]] had left an impression on [[Narnra Shalace]] by bringing over a half dozen of sellswords with him. This made her remember his name later, when the [[War Wizards]] raided the premises; she tried to pass herself off as one of their allies by naming Mathanter as one of the people present earlier.
