'''Xephras''' (pronounced ''ZEF-frus'') was the ''[[stormazîn]]'' of the [[giant|''Jotunbrud'']] in [[1366 DR]].{{Giantcraft date}}

==Description==
Xephras was a short [[cloud giant]]. He was several hundred years old and had a stooped figure with long white hair and a beard.

==Personality==
Xephras firmly disbelieved in the [[Twilight Spirit]] as a representative of the will of Annam, although he did not offer any alternatives to the Spirit's identity.

==Activities==
As the Great Priest of [[Annam All-Father]], Xephras was the highest religious figure in [[giant]] society. In his old age, because of his sickly physical condition, he was unable to attend as many rituals and ceremonies as he would have liked in order to fulfill his duties as ''stormazîn''. He would step down when he had found a successor.

Xephras resided with two [[stone giant]] disciples with the grand temple of Annam within the [[Ice Spires]].
