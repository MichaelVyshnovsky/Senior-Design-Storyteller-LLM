        "mainbody": "'''Atremus Bellwether''' was a caravaneer of [[northwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Possessions": "Atremus's caravan consisted of three wagons. The caravan was staffed with three merchants (Bellwether was one of them), four guards (one of whom was a minor [[cleric]]), and six drivers and teamsters. Among the trading goods recovered from the raised caravan were [[rabbit]] [[Fur|furs]], [[scrimshaw]], ''[[potions of healing]]'', [[silver]] [[ring|rings]], and a few [[scroll|wizard scrolls]].",
        "Relationships": "Atremus Bellwether hailed from Luskan and was acquainted with one of [[Boswell Peddywinkle]]'s hired adventurers who stumbled across his destroyed caravan.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Atremus Bellwether's caravan was crossing the [[Spine of the World]] on its way from [[Icewind Dale]] when it was ambushed by a gang of [[goblins]], leaving no survivors. The bodies of the caravaneers were deposited into a shallow grave near a small lake close to the trade way, and the loot and wagons were taken to the goblins' camp. Later the camp was discovered by Peddywinkle's hired adventurers who were able to identify the dead trader."
