Emir Yaghi-Siyan was the ruler of Delbyl during the mid 14th century DR.
The position of Emir of Delbyl was typically given to incompetent individuals, or as punishment from the bey. Yaghi-Siyan controlled all activity in the small backwater town of Delbyl. He was assisted by a civil watch made up of twelve maliks, or chiefs, and the men under their command.
Yaghi-Siyan was the cousin of the wife of the Bey of Murgh√¥m.
