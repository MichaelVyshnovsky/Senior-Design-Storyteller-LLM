'''Wedonai''' was a [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] of the [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]] tribe in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who died while on an expedition in the [[Shining Sea]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|20-21}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2,4}} Three months later, things began to go awry for the expedition.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2}} On [[Marpenoth 5]], Wedonai and a strong [[fighter]] by the name of [[Argus]] were patrolling the island when they came across the horrifically mutilated corpse of a [[stegosaurus]]. Wedonai would go on to express concerns about angered [[spirit|forest spirit]]s, whilst Angus would tell Devlin that the creature's wounds suggested an attack from another [[dinosaur]].

On [[Marpenoth 11]], five [[velociraptor]]s attacked the expedition site's messhall and both men aided in fending them off, though Argus would die in the process. The next day Wedonai left with the [[half-elf]] scout [[Jarkus]] and the [[mage]] [[Briella Farthing]] to check on the ''[[Sacred Heart of the Beast]]'',{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|11-12}}

Sometime between then and [[Marpenoth 23]], the two men died from the olive slimes and metamorphosed into [[slime creature]]s. Their prone bodies were later discovered by a group of [[adventurer]]s hired by Briella's father [[Maskin Farthing|Maskin]]. The two bodies sprung to life as the adventurers got close to them and had to be fought off, finally ending their existence.
