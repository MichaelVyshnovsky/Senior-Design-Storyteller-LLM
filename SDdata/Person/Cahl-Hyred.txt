'''Cahl-Hyred''' was the innkeeper of the [[Weeping Widow Inn]] in the town of [[Targos]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Cahl-Hyred was a portly, welcoming, and friendly man who harbored superstitious fear of undeath.

==Possessions==
Despite his harmless appearance, Cahl-Hyred was armed with a [[shortsword]] and a [[dagger]]. He carried a [[horn coral]] [[gem]]. His three hounds could always be found warming their bones by the inn's blazing fire pit.

==History==
Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Cahl-Hyred paid for one of the inn's rooms to be inscribed with a magic ''glyph'' that would bind the feeling widow's [[ghost]] to the single room in which she cried through the night by a broken window. Despite his heartbreaking for the undead woman, Cahl-Hyred knew not how to help her.

In 1312 DR, a guest named [[Koluhm Bonecutter]] was driven out of the inn by the weeping ghost. He fled the premises without paying a single [[coin]] for the stay but left a ''[[ghost-touched bottle]]'' with Cahl-Hyred. The innkeep was too superstitious to try drinking the [[potion]] and promptly got rid of the item once he was told the bottle kept a tiny fragment of the [[Ethereal plane]].
