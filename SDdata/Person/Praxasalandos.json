        "History": "In [[1479 DR]], Praxasalandos was one of the dragons who received an invitation to participate in [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]'s ''[[xorvintaal]]''. He accepted the invitation, and later agreed to play in the game, out of curiosity. However, realizing he lacked the resources to compete against the most powerful dragons of the East, he opted to make an alliance with the [[blue dragon]] [[Gestaniius]]. Prax was tasked with guarding the system of caverns that led through the Sword Mountains to the [[Plains of Purple Dust]].\n\nPrax ambushed a party led by [[Khouryn Skulldark]] of the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] and the [[dragonborn]] [[paladin]] [[Medrash]], who were in the mountains to kill Gestaniius, and succeeded in separating the party into two groups However, Medrash was able to defeat the dragon, and performed an exorcism on Prax which cleansed him of the taint of [[Tiamat]] he had acquired from playing ''xorvintaal'', freeing him from the compulsion of playing the game. To atone for his actions while playing, Prax allied himself with Medrash.\t\t\n\nPrax helped to kill Gestaniius, and also carried Medrash and several others back to [[Luthcheq]] where they arrived just as the [[Battle of Luthcheq]] was beginning. Prax fought bravely in the battle but was killed by [[Tchazzar]]."
