        "History": "Ren was a member of the Company of Scorpions and also Tyzack's personal assassin. His duty as assassin was usually to silence all members of the Company that discovered the captain's secret: in his youth, Tyzack has tried to rebel against the [[Zhentarim]].\n\nAll changed when, during the Time of Troubles, the Company of the Scorpions met the mortal [[Cyric]]. Soon, Cyric become the second-in-command of the company. All the previous bearers of the title had been killed by Ren for discovering the captain's secret. In the end, during a rain of metal blades—a manifestation of the crazy magic of that time—Tyzack died, probably killed by Ren, who considered Cyric a better commander. Ren later explained Tyzack's secret to Cyric, and the two mocked the dead captain for his stupidity.{{cite book/Tantras|4-6}}",
