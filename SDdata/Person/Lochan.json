        "Description": "Fist Lochan was an dark-skinned [[human]] woman with brown eyes. She wore a uniform of the Flaming Fist: a [[helmet]], a set of [[chainmail]], and a [[tabard]] adorned with the Flaming Fist insignia. Lochan wielded a [[halberd]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Fist Lochan was stationed in the [[Rivington]] district of Baldur's Gate, beyond the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] fortress. During he [[Absolute crisis]], Lochan, had to deal with Baldurian protesters, who zealously expressed their disdain for the refugees, who flooded the city, displaced by the moving armies of the Absolute. One of the protestors who gave her hard time was Saer [[Grotpoll]], who railed the crowds, claiming that the refugee vermin horde was a danger that could over overwhelm the city and that Baldur's Gate was for Baldurians."
