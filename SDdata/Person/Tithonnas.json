        "Abilities": "Tithonnas possessed all the common powers of topaz dragons and was a master of [[psionics]], focusing on [[psychometabolism]]. In particular, he knew the powers ''[[clairaudience (psionic)|clairaudience]]'', ''[[clairvoyance (psionic)|clairvoyance]]'', and ''[[sensitivity to psychic impressions]]'' and all the psionic attacks (''[[mind thrust]]'', ''[[ego whip]]'', ''[[id insinuation]]'', ''[[psychic crush]]'', ''[[mind blast]]'') and defenses (''[[empty mind]]'', ''[[thought shield]]'', ''[[mental barrier]]'', ''[[intellect fortress]]'', ''[[tower of iron will]]'').\n\nAs a thane, Tithonnas had a continuous mental contact with Sardior and could be used for his remote viewing, though he could choose to block it.",
        "Activities": "Tithonnas and the other thanes normally resided within Sardior's [[Ruby Palace]] as part of his court, but on occasion would wander a world of the [[material plane]] alone. Creatures that earned his favor might be rewarded with [[gem]]s, or sometimes some other gift or favor. He represented a certain facet of Sardior's personality.\n\nOn worlds where Sardior was worshiped, some 10% of later temples to him were dedicated to Tithonnas. At these temples, lesser in size and overlooked places, Tithonnas was revered by the faithful and served as the messenger and conduit of their faith. They attracted [[psion]]s specializing in psychometabolism. There were also small shrines alongside major Sardioran churches in larger cities. Followers of Tithonnas were called Tithonnians.{{Cite web/The Church of Sardior}}",
        "Relationships": "Tithonnas served Sardior as his thane, alongside fellow thanes the [[amethyst dragon]] [[Aleithilithos]], the [[crystal dragon]] [[Hrodel]], the [[sapphire dragon]] [[Charisma]], the [[emerald dragon]] [[Smargad]], and the destroyed [[obsidian dragon]] [[Seradess]]."
