        "mainbody": "Tithonnas was a great wyrm topaz dragon and a thane of the gem dragon god Sardior.\nTithonnas possessed all the common powers of topaz dragons and was a master of psionics, focusing on psychometabolism. In particular, he knew the powers clairaudience, clairvoyance, and sensitivity to psychic impressions and all the psionic attacks (mind thrust, ego whip, id insinuation, psychic crush, mind blast) and defenses (empty mind, thought shield, mental barrier, intellect fortress, tower of iron will).\nAs a thane, Tithonnas had a continuous mental contact with Sardior and could be used for his remote viewing, though he could choose to block it.\nTithonnas and the other thanes normally resided within Sardiors Ruby Palace as part of his court, but on occasion would wander a world of the material plane alone. Creatures that earned his favor might be rewarded with gems, or sometimes some other gift or favor. He represented a certain facet of Sardiors personality.\nOn worlds where Sardior was worshiped, some 10% of later temples to him were dedicated to Tithonnas. At these temples, lesser in size and overlooked places, Tithonnas was revered by the faithful and served as the messenger and conduit of their faith. They attracted psions specializing in psychometabolism. There were also small shrines alongside major Sardioran churches in larger cities. Followers of Tithonnas were called Tithonnians.\nTithonnas served Sardior as his thane, alongside fellow thanes the amethyst dragon Aleithilithos, the crystal dragon Hrodel, the sapphire dragon Charisma, the emerald dragon Smargad, and the destroyed obsidian dragon Seradess."
