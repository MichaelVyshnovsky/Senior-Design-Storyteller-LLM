Slan Thurbel was the leader of the mercenaries and enforcers of the Xanathar Thieves Guild of Skullport.
Slan commanded all the fighters of the guild, including the punitive squads incaricated to kill those that cross the ways of the guild.
The reorganization of the guild (and the secret change of the guild master) greatly made him happy because the old Xanathar did not "respect his talents" on contrary, the Eye greatly praised him in order to assure his loyalty. This praise however boostered Slans ego so he considered himself the most important follower of his master. The Eye ordered Avaereene to keep an eye on Slan in order to control Slan if he moved against the guild.
