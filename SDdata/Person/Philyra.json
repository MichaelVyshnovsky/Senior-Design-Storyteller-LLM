        "mainbody": "'''Philyra''' was a [[druid]] and a ranking member of the [[Society of Stalwart Adventurers]] from [[Suzail]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Philyra was an accomplished adventurer who disliked visiting [[Suzail]] and civilization in general. Within the Society of Stalwart Adventurers club, she was given an entire room, adjacent to the grand dining hall. Philyra filled the room with a cornucopia of exotic plants, thick enough to hide any signs of civilization from sight. The room was her hideaway when she ventured into the city. The plant room had a narrow path among tangled [[vine]]s and was a common hiding spot of the [[Elynna|club president]]'s pet [[leopard]].",
        "History": "At some point in [[1368 DR]], Philyra defeated a powerful [[yeti]] during one of her expeditions and gifted the beast's body to the Stalwarts club to be preserved and displayed among many heroic accomplishments."
