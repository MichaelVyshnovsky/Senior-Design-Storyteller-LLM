            "Gameplay": "The [[Kalach-Cha]] and the companions could encounter Calindra in the [[Alliance Arms Inn]], who would ask them to find Bradly. Bradly was actually taken by [[gnome|gnomish]] [[werewolf|werewolves]] who wanted to make him a werewolf as well, but left him dead in a cave in the [[Duskwood]], where he could be found. They could report back to Calindra if they discovered the miner's fate.\n\nAfter the Kalach-Cha became the Captain of [[Crossroad Keep]], Calindra could have been employed as a miner to dig through the ore mines that the Kalach-Cha could find on their travels."
