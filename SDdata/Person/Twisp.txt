'''Twisp''' was a [[gnome]] [[illusionist]] active during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Early in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Twisp was being hunted by a [[revenant]] which appeared to be a [[moon elf]] from [[Evermeet]]. As it pursued him through [[Daggerdale]], the spells he employed to try and slow his [[undead]] pursuer instead inflicted casualties on the locals. While the Dalesfolk had initially been receptive to Twisp's claims that he was innocent of murdering the revenant, his collateral damage made them less and less sympathetic.
