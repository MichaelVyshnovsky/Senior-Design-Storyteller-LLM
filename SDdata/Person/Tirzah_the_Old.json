        "mainbody": "irzah the Old was the witch in charge of the prison of Mulsantir in the late 14 century DR.\nIn 1374 DR, Tirzah the Old was indeed an aged woman of sour demeanor. She had white hair gathered in a severe bun, and her lips were perpetually pursed as if to keep her ancient teeth from falling out of her mouth. She wore a white Wychlaranasatheirr and simple gray robes.\nIn the , the adventurer known as the Knight-Commander, or Kalach-Cha, roused the spirits of Rashemen. Soon after the Knight-Commanders arrival to Mulsantir, an army of spirits, telthors led by the Bear-God Okku, gathered outside and demanded the life of the Knight-Commander. With aid from Sheva Whitefeather, a high-ranking witch of Mulsantir, the adventurer approached Tirzah the Old in order to find allies, willing or unwilling, who would stand beside the Knight-Commander against angry spirits. Tirzah insisted that those imprisoned were not to be trusted. At the time, there were only three prisoners, the hagspawn named Gannayev-of-Dreams, another hagspawn Mighty Groznek, and hin Joeb the Cutpurse. However, only the hagspawn agreed to exchange his imprisonment for warfare. During Gannayev-of-Dreams stay at the prison, he read Tirzahs past and dreams. She once spent an hour singing hymns to the sun in the golden forests of Urling and dreamt of the sun being a shield wielded by a warrior who protected the witch."
