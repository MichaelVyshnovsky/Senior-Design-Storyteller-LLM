'''Loren''' was a [[rogue]] adventurer and part of [[Athan]]'s band that was sent to [[Myth Drannor]] by [[Elminster Aumar]] in [[1369 DR]].

==History==
When the ''[[pool of radiance]]'' reawakened under [[Phlan]] in 1369 DR, Elminster was able to pinpoint its corrupting influence emanating from the ruins of Myth Drannor. Not losing any precious time, Elminster gathered an adventuring party, led by Athan, and armed them with the ''[[Gauntlets of Moander]]''. The band spent some time within the ruins, investigating the mysterious magic that spawned the accursed ''pool'', only to be ambushed by the forces of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. Led by [[Pelendralaar]], the cultists slaughtered most of the expedition.

Loren died as his life and energy were magically drained away, as later deduced by [[Ghleanna Stormlake]] who inspected the body.
