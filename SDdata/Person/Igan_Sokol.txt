Igan Sokol was the quartermaster of Sokol Keep in Phlan in the late 15 century DR.
Igan was a scion of the mercantile House Sokol. He grew up in Sokol Keep and in time he became the quartermaster of the keep, which served as a lighthouse for ships entering Phlan. Harae, a ghost that haunted the keep, somehow befriended Igan. Under Haraes hidden suggestions, Igan wanted to restore the shrine to Tyr inside the keep. He also involved in the matter his friend Grim Thornbuck, the leader of the Knights of the Black Fist contingent on the isle.
Out of gratitude, in the , Harae directed Igan, Grim, and fellow Black Fists to a dungeon under the keep that contained treasure. However, when they arrived, Grim and his fellows were filled with greed and Grim killed Igan. This angered both Harae and the undead guardian of the dungeon, which had once been a temple to Dagon. Thus Grim and his fellows were trapped and besieged inside the room.
Igan was raised as a zombie to torment Grim until some adventurers hired to solve the mystery of the keep destroyed his mortal remains and sought justice for his homicide.
Igan was a naive individual. At first, he considered all the stories about ghosts and treasure as just a game. After he befriended0 Grim, he became more serious and in the end became obsessed with uncovering the story of the keep.
