        "mainbody": "Josidiah Starym was an honorable and noble-born elf born in the elven empire of Cormanthyr. A bladesinger and adventurer, he was known for finding the Artblade and returning it to Myth Drannor, where he later served on the Council of Twelve and as Spell-Major. He was also known for being the first owner of Guenhwyvar, a magical figurine of power.\nJosidiah had long golden hair and bright blue eyes.\nJosidiah was born in 101 DR to a sun elf father and Ysmyrlda Starym, his moon elf mother. He largely inherited his fathers features, save for his mothers blue eyes, which made him a unique noble elf at the time. Being a member of the Starym clan of elves in the city of Myth Drannor, Josidiah was meant to defend the kingdom like his Lord Protector uncle, Taleisin Starym, who disagreed with the decision of Eltargrim Irithyl, Coronal of Cormanthyr, to allow \"other goodly races\" into the fabled city.\nIn the year 253 DR, Josidiah was granted a gift from Anders Beltgarden, a human wizard who settled in Cormanthyr. The gift was a magical figurine of a black panther that could transform into Guenhwyvar, who became Josidiahs friend.\nLater in his life, Josidiah embarked on a quest to retrieve the lost Warblade of Cormanthyr (an Elfblade called AryVelahrKerym) after it had been lost for over 800 years. He did this in 500 DR as a means to prove to Coronal Eltargrim, that he, as heir of House Starym, was worthy of marriage to the Coronals great-niece, Aravae Irithyl, heir to the kingdom, whom Josidiah dearly loved. He and his band of adventurers ventured into the Twisted Tower and battled drow, then entered the Underdark, vowing to return within a century. During this long trek, the Starym clan faced much uncertainty as its heir was missing.\nIn 674 DR, Josidiah returned at last to Myth Drannor, not with the expected Warblade, but the AkhFaers Artblade (the AkhFaer was the magical military force of Cormanthyr), which he discovered in the lair of a dragon beneath the Storm Horns.  Unfortunately, he discovered he was too late, as the Coronal and his love Aravae Irithyl had passed on (she had, in fact, been secretly murdered by members of Josidiahâ€™s puritanical family).  Instead of taking his rule of the Starym clan, Josidiah instead drew the Artblade and took command of the AkhFaer as Spell-Major. It is noted that, at this time, he no longer had the figurine Guenhwyvar, and it was rumored that he had to trade it for the blade.\nLater, in 689 DR, Josidiah survived four assassination attempts from the archmage Paeris Haladar, who sought vengeance for lost honor when Josidiah took his post as Spell-Major. Paeris was ultimately beaten when he tried to wield the Artblade and was deemed unworthy (and forever punished to emanate dead magic). Josidiah maintained his post.\nJosidiah was slain in 714 DR during the Battle of Stars Shining in defence of the Speculum. After the AkhFaer were destroyed, Josidiah was the last of his kind, and empowered by the Artblade and the divine powers of Sehanine Moonbow and Mystra, he rode a lightning bolt into his enemies before setting such hot fire to the area that he, the blade, and the tower were lost.\nJosidiah had twin swords that burned with greenish fire, with the command words of Cleansing Flames.\nJosidiah knew the spells fireball"
