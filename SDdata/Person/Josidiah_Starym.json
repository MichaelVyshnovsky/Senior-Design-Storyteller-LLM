        "mainbody": "'''Josidiah Starym''' was an honorable and noble-born [[elf]] born in the [[elf|elven]] empire of [[Cormanthyr]]. A [[bladesinger]] and adventurer, he was known for finding the ''[[Artblade]]'' and returning it to [[Myth Drannor]], where he later served on the [[Council of Twelve]] and as [[Spell-Major]]. He was also known for being the first owner of [[Guenhwyvar]], a magical figurine of power.",
        "Description": "Josidiah had long golden hair and bright blue eyes.",
        "History": "Josidiah was born in [[101 DR]] to a [[sun elf]] father and [[Ysmyrl'da Starym]], his [[moon elf]] mother. He largely inherited his father's features, save for his mother's blue eyes, which made him a unique noble elf at the time. Being a member of the [[Starym]] clan of elves in the city of Myth Drannor, Josidiah was meant to defend the kingdom like his [[Lord Protector]] uncle, [[Taleisin Starym]], who disagreed with the decision of [[Eltargrim Irithyl]], [[Coronal]] of Cormanthyr, to allow \"other goodly races\" into the fabled city.\n\nIn the year [[253 DR]], Josidiah was granted a gift from [[Anders Beltgarden]], a [[human]] [[wizard]] who settled in Cormanthyr. The gift was a magical figurine of a black panther that could transform into [[Guenhwyvar]], who became Josidiah's friend.\n\nLater in his life, Josidiah embarked on a quest to retrieve the lost [[Warblade]] of [[Cormanthyr]] (an [[Elfblade]] called ''Ary'Velahr'Kerym'') after it had been lost for over 800 years. He did this in [[500 DR]] as a means to prove to Coronal Eltargrim, that he, as heir of House Starym, was worthy of marriage to the Coronal's great-niece, [[Aravae Irithyl]], heir to the kingdom, whom Josidiah dearly loved. He and his band of adventurers ventured into the [[Twisted Tower]] and battled [[drow]], then entered the [[Underdark]], vowing to return within a century. During this long trek, the Starym clan faced much uncertainty as its heir was missing.\n\nIn [[674 DR]], Josidiah returned at last to Myth Drannor, not with the expected Warblade, but the Akh'Faer's ''[[Artblade]]'' (the [[Akh'Faer]] was the magical military force of Cormanthyr), which he discovered in the lair of a dragon beneath the [[Storm Horns]].  Unfortunately, he discovered he was too late, as the Coronal and his love Aravae Irithyl had passed on (she had, in fact, been secretly murdered by members of Josidiahâ€™s puritanical family).  Instead of taking his rule of the Starym clan, Josidiah instead drew the Artblade and took command of the Akh'Faer as [[Spell-Major]]. It is noted that, at this time, he no longer had the figurine Guenhwyvar, and it was rumored that he had to trade it for the blade.\n\nLater, in [[689 DR]], Josidiah survived four assassination attempts from the [[archmage]] [[Paeris Haladar]], who sought vengeance for lost honor when Josidiah took his post as Spell-Major. Paeris was ultimately beaten when he tried to wield the Artblade and was deemed unworthy (and forever punished to emanate [[Dead-magic zone|dead magic]]). Josidiah maintained his post.\n\nJosidiah was slain in [[714 DR]] during the [[Battle of Stars Shining]] in defence of the [[Speculum]]. After the Akh'Faer were destroyed, Josidiah was the last of his kind, and empowered by the ''Artblade'' and the divine powers of [[Sehanine Moonbow]] and [[Mystra]], he rode a lightning bolt into his enemies before setting such hot fire to the area that he, the blade, and the tower were lost.",
        "Known magic items": "Josidiah had twin swords that burned with greenish fire, with the [[command word]]s of ''Cleansing Flames''.",
        "Known spells": "Josidiah knew the spells ''[[fireball]]''"
