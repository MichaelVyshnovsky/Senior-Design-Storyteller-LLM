        "mainbody": "'''Ssalangan''' was a [[white dragon]]{{cite book/Dragons of Faerun|156}} who worked under [[Sammaster]] during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of {{yearlink|1373}}.",
        "Personality": "While Ssalangan recognized that the Rage of Dragons was overwhelming, he was still reluctant and unhappy about the idea that transformation into a [[dracolich]] would be needed to overcome it. He was somewhat absent-minded, at least compared to his immediate superior.",
        "Relationships": "Ssalangan aided [[Zethrindor]] in the conquest of [[Sossal]], both under [[Iyraclea]] and after her death.",
        "History": "On [[Eleint 2]], 1373 DR, Ssalangan was part of Zethrindor's forces as they assaulted [[Ironspring Grove]]. Unfortunately, he arrived too late to his superior's fight to be of any assistance. Instead, the dracolich sent him to chase transformed druids.{{cite book/The Rite||Prologue}}\n\nOn [[Marpenoth 21]]â€“[[Marpenoth 27|27]], Ssalangan was with Zethrindor's forces when they assaulted the elven citadel on [[Novularond]] containing a portal to the ''[[dracorage mythal]]''. He was ordered to search for the adventurers accompanying [[Karasendrieth]] in the aftermath of the fighting.{{cite book/The Rite||6}}\n\nSsalangan was arguing with [[Chuth]] on [[Nightal 6]] about who should become a dracolich first. It took Sammaster's involvement to break off their fight.{{cite book/The Rite||13}} The rage broke shortly after, but Ssalangan waited for two days before venting his displeasure over the local cell of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], considering himself to have been deceived by them.{{cite book/The Rite||Epilogue}}"
