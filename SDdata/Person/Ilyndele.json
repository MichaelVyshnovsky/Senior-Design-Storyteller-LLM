        "mainbody": "'''Ilyndele''' was a powerful member of [[Arcane (race)|the Arcane]] and one of three persons responsible for creating the [[World Serpent Inn]], according to the [[wizard]] [[Elminster]].",
        "Relationships": "Very little is known about Ilyndele except that the [[wildspace]] merchant was friends with an [[archmage]] from [[Toril]] named [[Alaurum]]. The two, together with the [[illithid]] High One [[Sharth]], are said to have \"crafted\" the inter-planar inn.",
        "History": "Hundreds of years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Alaurum, Ilyndele, and Sharth built the inn itself. The [[demiplane]] within which the inn resided&mdash;and the plane's many portals&mdash;had already existed, supposed by some cosmologists to be a [[dreamscape]] resulting from a sleeping fragment of the [[World Serpent]]."
