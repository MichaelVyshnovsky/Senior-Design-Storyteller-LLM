        "mainbody": "'''Skulner Wainwright''' was a [[human]] wainwright that lived in the town of [[Triboar]], operating [[Wainwright's Wagons]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref> He was renowned for his innovative [[wagon]] work all across [[the North]],{{Cite document/Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)/Adventurers Journal|6}} being by far the most famous wagonmaker in the region as of [[1365 DR]].<ref>",
        "Activities": "Skulner was kept fairly busy on a daily basis by the never-ending clamor for his wagons Whenever he could find time to himself though, Skulner whittled away the hours in his workshop designing and testing new ideas for wagons.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Skulner was working on a new prototype design that he dubbed the \"[[rolling cog]]\". A particularly large wagon, he was designing it with the intent that it could double as a barge. This prototype would prove to be a success and later be employed on the [[Dessarin River]]. However, Skulner would find himself repeatedly struggling to improve upon the rolling cog's design, reconciling the need for it transport a sizable number of [[cattle]] whilst also remaining small enough to avoid the hazard of river-bend sandbanks.\n\nBy {{Yearlink|1365}}, Skulner was fairly wealthy from his wainwright exploits and was content with life. However, Skulner yearned to one day design and create a wagon that was capable of flight. He would not settle for dissecting the designs of either an [[Evermeet]] skyship or [[Halruaan skyship]], nor would he accept the use of the strange magics employed in [[Nimbral]]. To this end he hoped to one day visit the island nation of [[Lantan]] and discuss designs with the innovative [[Church of Gond#Organization|artificer-ranked]] priests of the [[Gondian]] clergy."
