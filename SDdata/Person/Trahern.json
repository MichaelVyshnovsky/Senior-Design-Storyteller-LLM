        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1345}}, Trahern was corrupted by [[Kazgoroth]] in the disguise of a [[dryad]] so he could show [[Grunnarch|Grunnarch the Red]] and his army a safe and fast passage through Myrloch Vale.\n\nAfter Kazgaroth's defeat, Trahern searched the pond where Kazgaroth fell and recovered a skull-sized black rock—[[the Heart of Kazgaroth]].\n\nA [[1346|year later]], a feral Trahern found his way to the [[moonwell]] and Myrloch Vale, which was being tended to by [[Robyn Kendrick]] and [[Genna Moonsinger]]. The close proximity to the heart caused Genna to fall ill."
