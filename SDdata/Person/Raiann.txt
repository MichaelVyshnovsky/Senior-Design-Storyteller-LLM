'''Raiann''' was a [[dragonborn]] member of the [[Platinum Cadre]]. 

==History==
Before she joined the Platinum Cadre, Raiann was a glassblower. She left her profession after joining the order.

Raiann became one of [[Nala]]'s staunch supporters. At her behest, she smuggled the fine white sand Nala needed for her rituals.

[[Daardendrien Balasar|Balasar]] was able to uncover Nala's true allegiances by following Raiann to her secret rendezvous point.
