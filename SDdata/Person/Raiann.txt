Raiann was a dragonborn member of the Platinum Cadre. 
Before she joined the Platinum Cadre, Raiann was a glassblower. She left her profession after joining the order.
Raiann became one of Nalas staunch supporters. At her behest, she smuggled the fine white sand Nala needed for her rituals.
Balasar was able to uncover Nalas true allegiances by following Raiann to her secret rendezvous point.
