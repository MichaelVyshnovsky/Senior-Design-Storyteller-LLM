        "mainbody": "'''János Anatall''' was an [[assassin]] from the [[Barovia]]n village of [[Vallaki]] who was under the employ of [[Esmae Amarantha]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a woman whose ritualistic plans threatened to permanently trap within the [[Domains of Dread]] the lands and people of [[Phlan]] that had been sucked into Barovia.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/The Darklord|10,24}}",
        "Possessions": "János kept a journal hidden under his mattress. This contained details on all the murders he committed for Esmae, a general explanation of the [[Evening Glory]] faith, and his many childish attempts at writing romantic poetry.",
        "History": "While under the employ of Esmae, János came to live within one of the guardrooms of the ruined [[Boszórkan Keep]]. Over time he became enraptured by both her beauty and power, worshiping her from afar. Following Esmae's merging with the [[vestige]] Evening Glory, his devotion to her grew stronger and he longed for the day he would die in her service so that he may be reborn as an [[undead]] servant.\n\nJános did not believe that [[Tatyana]], a woman who Esmae sought to merge with, was as beautiful as her. Yet he still vowed to love Esmae even after she took on Tatyana's likeness."
