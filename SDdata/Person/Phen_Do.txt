Baron Phen Do, called the Outlaw, was a rebellious noble of the city of Khampo in Tabot.
Wanting to restore the rule of the nobles over Tabot and depose the High Lord, Phen Do launched a rebellion. In response, the worried Mag-chi Le-Khung (the military office) stationed three divisions in Khampo to contain the revolt. In , a tortoise-shell divination at UChan Gompa suggested burning rocks would fall on Khampo during Qwachein Goh celebrations they elected not to warn the city, as punishment for its rebellion.
By that year, Phen Do was training his secret army, nicknamed the Raccoon-dogs, hidden in the mountains east of Nafeen Gompa. They had a base and a form of ninja school. Through gifts and spies, he had influenced both the Nafeen and Zotung Gompas and bribed the Chi-kyap Khempo (the lord chamberlain representing the nobility to the High Lord). Stories spread of Phen Dos exploits and the dzong-pons (sheriffs) of Tabot carried pictures of him.
He had a strong build and black hair, which he braided and was long enough to hang down his back. He had scars on his left arm and hand, which he concealed by wearing a glove.
Phen Do fought with a magical battleaxe that he dipped in poison.
