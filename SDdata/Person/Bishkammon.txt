Bishkammon was an empress of Wa from the Goshukara line.
In the 669 year of the Wa calendar (the ), the shogun Nitta Shogoro at last succeeds at ending the occupation of the island by the forces of Shou Lung, who had been there for centuries. After the battle, the government of Wa was thrown into disarray over who should lead them. At this time, Bishkammon was the empress, but the nation was in need of a regent until she could provide a male heir to preserve the Goshukara line. In the next year, Shogoro attempted somehow to force Bishkammons hand into appointing him as regent, but one of her counselors, the Great Minister of the Left vehemently opposed this power play and supported the empress youngest son. a war that lasted for over two centuries but presumably resulted in victory for the Goshukara.
In the 671 year of the Wa calendar, Empress Bishkammon received ambassadors from Shou Lung offering a recognition of Wa as a fellow nation rather than a territory of Shou Lung. An offer of citizenship was made to all inhabitants of Wa with mixed heritage to return to Shou Lung, and all demands for taxes were lifted. By the end of the year, trade agreements had been established, which included open ports between the two empires.
As part of the trade agreement, Bishkammon allowed for the settlement of a small Shou community within the port of Nakamaru in the north, but these foreigners were closely watched by the governor of Nakamarus province.
