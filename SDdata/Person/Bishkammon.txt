'''Bishkammon''' was an empress of [[Wa]] from the [[Goshukara]] line.

==History==
In the 669{{th}} year of the [[Wa calendar]] (the {{YearlinkName|251}}), the [[shogun]] [[Nitta Shogoro]] at last succeeds at ending the occupation of the island by the forces of [[Shou Lung]], who had been there for centuries. After the battle, the government of Wa was thrown into disarray over who should lead them. At this time, Bishkammon was the empress, but the nation was in need of a regent until she could provide a male heir to preserve the [[Goshukara]] line. In the next year, Shogoro attempted somehow to force Bishkammon's hand into appointing him as regent, but one of her counselors, the Great Minister of the Left vehemently opposed this power play and supported the empress' youngest son. a war that lasted for over two centuries but presumably resulted in victory for the Goshukara.

In the [[253 DR|671{{st}} year]] of the Wa calendar, Empress Bishkammon received ambassadors from Shou Lung offering a recognition of Wa as a fellow nation rather than a territory of Shou Lung. An offer of citizenship was made to all inhabitants of Wa with mixed heritage to return to Shou Lung, and all demands for taxes were lifted. By the end of the year, trade agreements had been established, which included open ports between the two empires.

As part of the trade agreement, Bishkammon allowed for the settlement of a small [[Shou]] community within the port of [[Nakamaru]] in the north, but these foreigners were closely watched by the governor of Nakamaru's province.
