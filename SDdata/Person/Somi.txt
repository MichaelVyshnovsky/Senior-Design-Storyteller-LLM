==Description==
Somi was a gruff and tough half-orc with leathery tan skin and long mop of brown hair. He had brown eyes, yellow tusks, and a single nose ring decorated with a tiny skull. Somi wore a [[breastplate]] and carrie da massive [[greataxe]].

==History==
Somi and his brother entered [[Entharl Danthelonâ€Ž]]'s employ sometime in or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Both half-orcs diligently guarded the shop, the proprietor, and the shop's cellar, that was secretly used as a [[Harper]] safehouse. Somi made sure that no Harper meeting was interrupted by city guards nor [[steel watcher]]s.
