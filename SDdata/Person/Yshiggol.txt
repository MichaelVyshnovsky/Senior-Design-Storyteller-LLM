'''Yshiggol''' was a [[mind flayer]] [[elder brain]] living in the [[Dread Vault]] in the [[Whispering Caverns]].

In the past, Yshiggol was responsible for the corruption of the [[dwarven]] [[Clan Duergar]] into the subrace of [[duergar]]<ref group="note" name="note1">This is contradicted in both ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' and ''[[Drizzt Do'Urden's Guide to the Underdark]]''. In both it is said that the city of [[Oryndoll]] which is led by the elder brain [[Encephalithid]] created the Duergar.. When the duergar rose against their masters, Yshiggol was thought by all to have been killed by the rebellious slaves. In truth, the brain was trapped in a magic prison by duergar magic powered by [[devil]]s.

Circa [[1480 DR]], the mind flayers discovered the truth of the situation and worked to free their master. In the end, Yshiggol was freed from the prison by the mind flayers, but soon after was killed by some adventurers.
