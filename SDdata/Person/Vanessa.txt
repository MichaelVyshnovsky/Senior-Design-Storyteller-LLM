==History==
{{Fq
| text = Looking forward to her songs helps me get through the days.
| source = Vanessa, speaking about Birdsong.
}}
Vanessa had a relationship with the [[tabaxi]] [[bard]] [[Birdsong]]. They had to meet in secrecy, as Vanessa's commanders would not allow such trysts by soldiers posted in the camp. During a [[Grand Revel]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Vanessa asked a group of [[adventurer]]s to find out what had happened to her lover. The adventurers found that Birdsong had been captured by [[Nanny Pu'pu]] in [[Mbala]], and managed to free the tabaxi.
