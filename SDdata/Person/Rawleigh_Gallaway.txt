'''Rawleigh Gallaway''' was the individual who ran the [[Gallaway Trading Coaster]] and traveled through [[Lonelywood]], in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''It's a collection of businessmen who band together for mutual support. Unlike trading houses, costers generally don't have much to do with family, just making money.''|Rawleigh Gallaway}}

==Description==
In his young days, Rawleigh was a fair-skinned [[human]] man with dark brown hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Rawleigh Gallaway ran caravans for his father's trading coaster and ended up being stuck in the town of Lonelywood when [[Bremen's Run]] became cut off by [[barbarian]] forces of chieftain [[Wylfdene]]. Subsequently, Rawleigh, along with other family members, took over Gallaway Trading Coaster after Rawleigh's father, [[Ilmus Gallaway]], was unable to be in charge due to his age and love of [[Cormyrian brandy]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Rawleigh still ran the family business. As a "one last favor," Rawleigh requested his trusted adviser and employee, [[Jemeliah]], to lend his expertise and sharp mind to [[Deirdre Gallaway]] in [[Targos]], who strove to prove herself as a capable businesswoman and merchant.
