Shant Duerna was a duergar in Zortagra during the late 1480s DR.
At some point in the late 1480s DR, he was in the recently conquered deep gnome city of Zortagra, acting as a gate guardian.
The demon lordâ€“inflicted madness had twisted him. His only goal was to find something that entertained him, not caring for consequences. He believed himself to be a laird.
