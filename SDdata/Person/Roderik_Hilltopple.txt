Roderik Hilltopple was a strongheart halfling shepherd sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Roderik was captured by the hill giants of Chief Guh and taken as a prisoner to Grudd Haug. There, the goblin cooks wanted to roast Roderik alive and serve it up to Guh. However, he was saved by an adventuring party but refused to escape without taking some sheep for his trouble.
