'''Shamoor''' was one of the high-ranking members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] who served under [[Kya Mordrayn]] during her quest to usurp the power of a ''[[pool of radiance]]'' under [[Castle Cormanthor]] in [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
Shamoor was a statuesque man, {{SI|6'2|'"|long=yes}} tall.

==Abilities==
The cleric of [[Xvim]] was a powerful divine spellcaster, who relied heavily on his god-given powers to ''[[control undead]]'', and ''[[smite]]'' the Cult's enemies. Among other spells he had access to ''[[cure wounds]]'', ''[[purify food and drink]]'', ''[[bane]]'', ''[[invisibility to undead]]'', ''[[protection from good]]'', ''[[obscuring mist]]'', ''[[desecrate]]'', ''[[contagion]]'', ''[[unholy blight]]'', and many others. Additionally to his divine gifts, Shamoor was quite knowledgeable in arcane, religion, [[potion]]-making, and [[wand]]-crafting.

==Possessions==
Shamoor was armed with his masterwork heavy [[mace]], and a [[light crossbow]]. He was well-protected by an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[full plate]], a ''[[cloak of resistance]]'', and a ''[[mirror mask]]''.

==Relationships==
Shamoor was held personally responsible for the excavations and its failures by the Cult's [[Wearers of Purple]]. They tasked him with recovery of magical items from the crypts to used them in the immersion ritual. The ritual that was to empower the [[dracolich]] [[Pelendralaar]] vis the corrupted ''pool of radiance''.

Shamoor could not stand [[Ryngoth]]'s animal companion, the ''[[awaken|awakened]]'' [[dire badger]] [[Zulkir (badger)|Zulkir]]. His hate for the creature was so strong, Shamoor planned on putting ''[[pox]]'' on him.

==History==
In 1369 DR, during the Cult of the Dragon's occupation of the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]], Shamoor was one of the top commanders of Kya Mordrayn's sect. He was personally to oversee the dangers of the [[Crypt of Kesefehon]], [[Crypt of Orbakh]], and [[Crypt of Rothilion]]

During his time in Castle Cormanthor, Shamoor could most often be found in the vicinity of the ''pool of radiance'', preparing the immersion ritual. A grotesque [[zombie dragon]] was raised and controlled by him. The [[undead]] creature served as Shamoor's guardian and as a back-up body for dracolich Pelendralaar, in case the ritual failed and his physical shell was consumed and destroyed by the pure magic of the ''pool''. When the adventuring gand who beat the Cult to the tombs found their way to the ''pool'' chamber to destroy Pelendralaar's ''[[phylactery]]'', Shamoor and his zombie dragon were among the defenders who faced the heroes. As the battle ended, Shamoor's final fate remained unclear.
