Anwae Mavin was a half–song dragon half–moon elf monk sorcerer, and the leader of the Sisterhood of Essembra in 1374 DR.
She was the granddaughter of the song dragon Essembramaerytha. Anwae was interested in aiding metallic dragons, dragonborn of Bahamut, and other humanoids after the last Rage of Dragons, in 1373 DR. Although she knew that her support of the followers of Bahamut would draw the ire of the followers of Tiamat, she continued helping them nonetheless.
