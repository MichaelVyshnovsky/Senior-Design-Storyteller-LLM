He attempted to negotiate a passage to Waterdeep with Captain Sleam, a smuggler with her own boat and crew. Sleam asked for too much money, claiming it was a life-and-death situation for her crew too. Dharin could not afford to pay for four seats, so he resorted to staying behind. It was unknown if Leepak and the girls escaped the Gate before the battle of the Upper City commenced."
