'''Oberon''' was a [[wizard]] living in a tower in [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Relationships==
The wizard had many dealings with [[Pasha]] [[Pook]] of [[Calimport]].

==History==
In [[1356 DR]], Pook ordered the pirate fleet of [[Pinochet]] to attack Captain [[Deudermont]]'s ''[[Sea Sprite]]'' in order to stop the [[Companions of the Hall]] from arriving in Calimport. Pook questioned Oberon about his contact with [[Artemis Entreri]].
