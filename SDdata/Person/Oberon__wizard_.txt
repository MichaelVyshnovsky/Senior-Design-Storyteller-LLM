Oberon was a wizard living in a tower in Baldurs Gate.
The wizard had many dealings with Pasha Pook of Calimport.
In 1356 DR, Pook ordered the pirate fleet of Pinochet to attack Captain Deudermonts Sea Sprite in order to stop the Companions of the Hall from arriving in Calimport. Pook questioned Oberon about his contact with Artemis Entreri.
