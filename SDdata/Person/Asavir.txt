'''Asavir''' was an infamous legendary pirate from the [[Nelanther Isles]] and the namesake of [[Asavir's Channel]], active in the early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Asavir commanded a fleet of over a dozen vessels.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1021}}, Captain Asavir made history by capturing trade cargoes from twelve [[Amn]]ian merchant families, claiming a season's worth of commodities from over one hundred ships. This feat was considered the most impressive pirate operation that had ever taken place along the [[Sword Coast]].

Several years later, Asavir and his entire fleet were lost in a deadly storm west of the Nelanther Isles in the [[Sea of Swords]].
