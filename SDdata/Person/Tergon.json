        "History": "In the 10{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Forge of Spells]] was used to create various [[magic]]al items. Tergon was to be made a breastplate that could resist the breath of dragons and provide extra protection against any incoming hits. The [[human]] [[mage]]s of the mine summoned a [[spectator]] to watch over the magical creations. However, in [[951 DR]], a savage group of orcs invaded the area, slaying the mages and others in the mines. Nothing else was known about the history of Tergon.\n\n''Circa'' [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} his enchanted breastplate was still guarded by the same spectator."
