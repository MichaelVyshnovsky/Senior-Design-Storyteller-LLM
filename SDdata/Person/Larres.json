Unfortunately, the druid Halsaime became corrupted by the powers of his vile staff and became a malevolent force of nature. Larres was one of those that joined his cause, either of his own accord or the powerful will that Halsaime exerted, and protected Thorn Hollow with his companion dire bears until they were overcome by Harper agents sent from Eveningstar by Kirinel Zay."
