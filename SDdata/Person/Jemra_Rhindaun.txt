'''Jemra Rhindaun''' was a princess of [[Tethyr]] and a member of the [[Rhindaun Dynasty|Rhindaun]] royal dynasty who married into [[Obarskyr|House Obaskyr]] of [[Cormyr]] through her marriage to [[Foril Obarskyr I|Foril I]]. She was the mother of [[Irvel Obarskyr|Irvel Obarskyr]], and died tragically in an assassination orchestrated by Sembian agents in [[1437 DR]]{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|62}}. 

==History==
Jemra Rhindaun was the niece of the Tethyrian queen, [[Sybille Rhindaun|Sybille II]]. When prince and future king of Cormyr Foril Obaskyr moved to Tethyr to be an apprentice of the [[Church of the Red Knight|Red Fellowship]], he met Jemra and they fell deeply in love.{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|44}}

After a whirlwind engagement, the two of them married in the {{YearlinkName|1430}}, but their marriage did not sit well with Cormyr's nobility. The couple welcomed a healthy baby boy the next year, named Irvel, who would also be a Cormyrean king in the future.

In the {{YearlinkName|1437}}, following years of intermittent conflict between Cormyr and [[Sembia]], Sembian factions attempted an assassination of [[Azoun Obarskyr V|Azoun V]], who was Cormyr's king at the time. Though the assassins' blades were seeking the king, they ended up killing Princess Jemra instead. Royal Mage [[Ganrahast Aeiulvana]] secretly blamed himself for the princess's murder, as he attributed her demise to the failure of one of his protective wards. Her death, compounded with the slaying of Crown Prince [[Emvar Obarskyr|Emvar]] previously on the same month, sent waves of mourning through Cormyr. As the people grieved, there were calls for action to be taken against Sembia and their overlords from [[Returned Netheril]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|55, 62}}

In the future, when her bereaved husband became king of Cormyr, her death and that of his brother would mold Foril into a deliberate and cautious ruler.{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|52}}
