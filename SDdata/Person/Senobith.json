        "mainbody": "'''Senobith the Corruptor''' was a [[foulspawn]] prophetess and leader among the [[Order of Blue Fire]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Senobith was cautious and untrusting, and concealed herself behind potent [[ward]]s and [[spell]]s in a lair within the [[Cathedral of Madness]].",
        "Relationships": "She led the Order of Blue Fire members who comprised the [[Acolytes of Corruption]], and had four lieutenants who served her: [[Onfrey]], [[Thormund]], [[Nala (Order of Blue Fire|Nala]], and [[Hazdrobel]]. She did not trust any of these lieutenants individually, and required that all four of them cooperate if they wished to summon her from her lair.",
        "History": "Upon hearing rumors that a ruined cathedral within the Chasm was erupting with [[Spellplague]], Senobith and her followers travelled there and declared it to be a holy site. They began to preach the virtues of submitting to the energies of the Spellplague, and this message drew the attention and ire of [[Scar Company]]. Under the direction of [[Quorthon]], an [[adventurer]] was sent to eliminate Senobith and her followers."
