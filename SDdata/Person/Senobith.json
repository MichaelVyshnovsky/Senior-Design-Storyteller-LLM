        "mainbody": "enobith the Corruptor was a foulspawn prophetess and leader among the Order of Blue Fire as of the late 15 century DR.\nSenobith was cautious and untrusting, and concealed herself behind potent wards and spells in a lair within the Cathedral of Madness.\nShe led the Order of Blue Fire members who comprised the Acolytes of Corruption, and had four lieutenants who served her Onfrey, Thormund, Nala, and Hazdrobel. She did not trust any of these lieutenants individually, and required that all four of them cooperate if they wished to summon her from her lair.\nUpon hearing rumors that a ruined cathedral within the Chasm was erupting with Spellplague, Senobith and her followers travelled there and declared it to be a holy site. They began to preach the virtues of submitting to the energies of the Spellplague, and this message drew the attention and ire of Scar Company. Under the direction of Quorthon, an adventurer was sent to eliminate Senobith and her followers."
