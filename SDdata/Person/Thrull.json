        "mainbody": "Thrull was an orog warlord in Thar in the early 1370s DR.\nAround 1369 DR, Thrull alongside his younger siblings Daazlag and Naazlog, emerged from the Underdark to the X没l-Jarak citadel in Thar. There the orc adept Jurrg proclaimed them \"sons of Gruumsh\" and Thrull the new king of Thar. They started to build the new kingdom together.\nIn 1374 DR, R没lgar, Jurrgs brother, found the Hammer of Gruumsh in a cave in the Galena Mountains and Jurrg saw this as a sign that the time of Thrulls rule was near. In the meantime, thanks to Daazlag, the orcs captured the scions of five powerful houses from Melvaunt. Jurrg planned to ritually sacrifice them in the crowning ceremony for Thrull.\nWhen adventurers came to investigate, Thrull was in the temple to Gruumsh inside X没l-Jarak together with R没lgar and four orc warriors, waiting for the start of the ceremony to proclaim Thrull as king of all Thar.\nThrull was a particularly large example of his kind with green-black skin, pointed ears, and prominent, pale eyes.\nAs befitting orc-kind, Thrull was an accomplished fighter and leader. He was especially skilled in the use of greatswords and mauls.\nThrull typically wore a suit of magical +2 plate mail and a ring of protection +1. In addition, Thrull managed to recover and wield the Hammer of Gruumsh, a legendary weapon among the orcs of Thar.\nThrull had a pet basilisk, which remained in his room."
