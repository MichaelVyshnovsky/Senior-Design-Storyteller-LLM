        "mainbody": "'''Thrull''' was an [[orog]] warlord in [[Thar]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Around [[1369 DR]], Thrull alongside his younger siblings [[Daazlag]] and [[Naazlog]], emerged from the [[Underdark]] to the [[Xûl-Jarak]] citadel in [[Thar]]. There the [[orc]] adept [[Jurrg]] proclaimed them \"sons of [[Gruumsh]]\" and Thrull the new king of Thar. They started to build the new kingdom together.\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], [[Rûlgar]], Jurrg's brother, found the ''[[Hammer of Gruumsh]]'' in a cave in the [[Galena Mountains]] and Jurrg saw this as a sign that the time of Thrull's rule was near. In the meantime, thanks to Daazlag, the orcs captured the scions of five powerful houses from [[Melvaunt]]. Jurrg planned to ritually sacrifice them in the crowning ceremony for Thrull.\n\nWhen adventurers came to investigate, Thrull was in the temple to Gruumsh inside Xûl-Jarak together with Rûlgar and four orc warriors, waiting for the start of the ceremony to proclaim Thrull as king of all Thar.",
        "Description": "Thrull was a particularly large example of his kind with green-black skin, pointed ears, and prominent, pale eyes.",
        "Abilities": "As befitting orc-kind, Thrull was an accomplished [[fighter]] and leader. He was especially skilled in the use of [[greatsword]]s and [[maul]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Thrull typically wore a suit of [[magic]]al ''+2 [[plate mail]]'' and a ''[[ring of protection]] +1''. In addition, Thrull managed to recover and wield the ''Hammer of Gruumsh'', a legendary weapon among the [[orc]]s of [[Thar]].",
        "Relationship": "Thrull had a pet [[basilisk]], which remained in his room."
