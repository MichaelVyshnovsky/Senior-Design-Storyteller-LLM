        "mainbody": "Doris was a barmaid in the city of Ravens Bluff in the 14 century DR who originated from the world of Oerth. She had a content life working at the Shark Fin, but fancied the notion of someday joining an adventuring company so she could explore the wider world of Toril.\nDoris was a human woman with black hair and brown eyes. She stood  tall and weighed , but had above average strength.\nIn terms of weaponry, Doris was a fighter skilled in fighting with cargo hooks, daggers, long swords, and short bows.\nDoris enjoyed the atmosphere of her workplace, but also had a penchant for sharing stories and engaging customers of the Shark Fin in bouts of wrestling. Most often a glass of brandy would be wagered in these arm-wrestling bouts.\nDoris originated on the world of Oerth, where she was an inhabitant of the city of Greyhawk. There she came to find herself aboard a spelljammer, whose captain later dropped her off in Ravens Bluff after she spurned his advances. She started out working at the harbor, trying her best to learn about Toril, but was eventually offered a steady job at the Shark Fin tavern as a barmaid and with the heavy tasks requiring strength."
