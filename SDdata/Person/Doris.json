        "mainbody": "'''Doris''' was a barmaid in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who originated from the world of [[Oerth]]. She had a content life working at the [[Shark Fin]], but fancied the notion of someday joining an [[adventuring company]] so she could explore the wider world of [[Toril]].",
        "Description": "Doris was a human woman with black hair and brown eyes. She stood {{SI|5'2\"|ft-in}} tall and weighed {{SI|128|lb|k}}, but had above average strength.",
        "Abilities": "In terms of weaponry, Doris was a [[fighter]] skilled in fighting with cargo hooks, [[dagger]]s, [[long sword]]s, and [[short bow]]s.",
        "Activities": "Doris enjoyed the atmosphere of her workplace, but also had a penchant for sharing stories and engaging customers of the Shark Fin in bouts of wrestling. Most often a glass of [[brandy]] would be wagered in these arm-wrestling bouts.",
        "History": "Doris originated on the world of Oerth, where she was an inhabitant of the city of Greyhawk. There she came to find herself aboard a [[spelljammer]], whose captain later dropped her off in Ravens Bluff after she spurned his advances. She started out working at the [[Ravens Bluff/Harbor District|harbor]], trying her best to learn about Toril, but was eventually offered a steady job at the Shark Fin tavern as a barmaid and with the heavy tasks requiring strength."
