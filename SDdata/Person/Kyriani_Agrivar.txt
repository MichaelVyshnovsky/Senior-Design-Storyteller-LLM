'''Kyriani Agrivar''' was a [[half-drow]] [[wizard]] of [[Waterdeep]]. She was a member of the [[Moonstars]],

==History==
===Cybriana & Kilili===
Kyriani's origins were most unusual, beginning in a powerful [[artifact]] and two separate yet inextricably linked women, [[Cybriana]] and [[Kilili]].

Cybriana was the daughter of a powerful wizard, [[Ostus Agrivar]], and a [[drow]] sorceress. Shortly after her birth, her mother took her to an [[elf]] village near [[Shadowdale]] and abandoned her to their care.{{Cite comic/The Secret of Selûne's Eye}}{{Cite comic/Sorcerer's Moon}}

Meanwhile, the monstrous being [[Imgig Zu]], trapped within the enchanted gem known as ''[[Selûne's Eye]]'', observed this and forged a magical link with Kilili, allowing him to escape into the Realms. However, he needed Cybriana and Kilili together to release the rest of his people. Kilili fell in with Imgig, and together they hatched their scheme.{{Cite comic/The Bounty Seekers Of Manshaka}} She feared what her dark half might do if left unchecked.

[[File:Kyriani descends.jpg|thumb|left|Kyriani descends and gives ''Selûne's Eye'' to Priam.]]Thus, in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], Cybriana left Shadowdale and journeyed to [[Waterdeep]] in search of one who she believed could help her—the [[paladin]] [[Priam Agrivar]],{{Cite comic/The Gathering ‎}} not knowing him to be her half-brother, the son of her unknown father, [[Ostus Agrivar]]. Meanwhile, Kilili was assisting Imgig Zu in hunting out her sister. Imgig's [[chasme]] minions abducted Cybriana, but she was rescued by the [[centaur]] [[Timoth Eyesbright]] and the [[dwarf]] [[Onyx the Invincible]]. They escorted her to Waterdeep, where they searched for Priam, finally arriving at the [[Selûne's Smile]] tavern. The proprietress [[Luna]] introduced them to [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], who led them to Priam Agrivar—now a drunken, crippled beggar. Nevertheless, Cybriana had faith in him. In their journeys to cure Priam, she told the companions her story. When she mentioned ''Selûne's Eye'', Priam realized they shared a father. But, just then, the group heard Imgig's chasme pursuing new victims and raced to the rescue.

Imgig Zu observed ''Selûne's Eye'' glow like the moon, meaning that Kilili's sister was near his tower and had been found. Kilili visited Cybriana lured her close to Imgig's tower. Imgig's [[gargoyle]]s snatched up Cybriana and she was taken into their lair. In the caverns beneath Imgig's tower, the proximity of Cybriana and Kilili, both to each other and to ''Selûne's Eye'', caused the gem to glow even more brightly and to swell in size. Imgig Zu used their combined powers to open the ''Eye'' and release his long-imprisoned people to overrun and conquer the Realms. Cybriana's companions fought their way in, but too late, as Imgig's people escaped, and the heroes were subdued. An exultant Imgig taunted Priam and threatened to kill him as he had killed Ostus Agrivar. But the roof of the cavern tore open and the brilliant light of the full moon shone through, blinding the ogres. Cybriana urged her brother Priam to strike, and he slew Imgig Zu in the name of their father.

Cybriana escaped and grabbed Kilili, and when they touched, they merged into one being, part good and part evil, and the living key to ''Selûne's Eye''. The Cybriana-half gained dominance over the Kilili-half, and the merged being vanished inside the gem, drawing all of Imgig's people back within, saving the Realms from devastation at the cost of her unique identity. A merged being levitated down, bearing the shrunken ''Selûne's Eye'', and wearing the shredded remains of Cybriana's dress and the earrings of both women. Part Cybriana and part Kilili, she combined their names and named herself "Kyriani". Kyriani and her companions returned to the Selûne's Smile where Luna rewarded them.

===The first Kyriani===
After [[Zomir|bounty hunters]] kidnapped Vajra from the Smile, and Timoth and [[Conner]] went after them, more bounty hunters and [[Chancil Crystalheart|a mage]] came. Their spells and a potion in the drinks left all the patrons unconscious, including Kyriani, and they kidnapped the [[cat child]]. When Vajra, Timoth, and Conner returned and awoke her, Kyriani told them what had happened.{{Cite comic/Shackles of the Past ‎|23-24}} Kyriani stayed behind as Vajra, Conner, and Salabak went after the kidnappers,{{speculation}} and celebrated Vajra's return. {{Cite comic/The Last Betrayal|23-24}}

[[File:Kyriani 2.jpg|thumb|right|The second Kyriani is revealed.]]
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Kyriani was again called on to aid in closing an extraplanar gate, the [[Great Door]] built by her father and [[Parwyyd Hanifar]]. Hanifar lured her and Onyx to the site with a false [[message plate]] from Priam and, after they fought over a misunderstanding of his intent, explained that he needed one of the blood of Agrivar to control and close it. Hanifar observed her unusual make-up and [[magic aura|aura]], and Kyriani told him of her creation from Cybriana and Kilili, but Hanifar felt the merger was incomplete, that Kyriani could not attain her potential without knowing her true self. [[kenku (winged)|Kenkus]] emerged from the Door, but Kyriani refused to let Onyx face them alone whilst she and Parwyyd commanded the Door. Regardless, the Door protected itself with a bolt of magic that separated Kyriani back into Cybriana and Kilili.{{Cite comic/The Ostus Legacy}} Parwyyd divined that this was possible because Kyriani had never fully accepted her evil half, and therefore was not whole. Once Cybriana accepted that she, like her father, had both good and evil inside, she was able to merge with Kilili for the second and final time, and a new Kyriani was born. She combined her powers with Parwyyd's to close the Door, and the [[one who waits]] behind it was slain. Kyriani thanked Parwyyd for giving her the truth of her nature and the courage to accept it. Kyriani felt that she was not the same Kyriani as before, but in fact the Kyriani she was meant to have been all along, accepting both sides of her nature and able to forge her own destiny.{{Cite comic/Day of the Darkening}} Onyx bemoaned that she acted "strange" after this.

===The second Kyriani===
During the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], Kyriani's magic went awry, and she inadvertently unleashed ''[[magic missile]]s'' in Timoth's stall. She later tried a simple ''bloom'', but also created a monstrous flower monster that tried to swallow her, before she was rescued by Vajra and Timoth. When Onyx told the group of the appearance of an [[avatar]] of [[Selûne]] in Waterdeep, Kyriani admitted she'd worked out that Luna was really Selûne soon after they'd met, thinking it better not to mention it. Luna was later defeated and captured by the [[Shar|false avatar]].{{Cite comic/DC ADD comic 19}} Kyriani investigated by attending a party at [[Castle Waterdeep]] where the avatar was guest of honor, using her relationship with [[Fenn Estelmer]] to get in, though she got him out of her hair with a kiss and a ''[[sleep]]'' spell. She spoke with Lord [[Piergeiron]] and [[Khelben Arunsun]], sharing news and concerns over the divine turmoil and [[Ao]], the avatar's identity, and Luna's imprisonment at the [[House of the Moon]]. After the [[Dark Army of the Night]] attempted to kidnap the false avatar, Kyriani confronted her in the kitchens, declaring she would expose her and save Luna. The avatar attacked Kyriani with ''[[minute meteors]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', and ''[[magic missile]]s'', while Kyriani fought back with her ''ring of telekinesis''. Lord Piergeiron intervened and, though Kyriani was overcome, she'd revealed the avatar's reckless temper, sowing doubts among the nobility. Piergeiron ordered Kyriani arrested by [[Rathnar]] of the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]], but then Khelben secretly let her go. Dramatically, she leaped out of the cliff-side castle and was caught by her lover [[Rellamyn]] on his [[asperii|flying horse]]. Dodging flaming arrows, he returned her to the Smile, where the heroes vowed to rescue Luna from the House of the Moon.{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon}}

A dozen days after Luna's capture, while Onyx and Timoth searched the temple, Kyriani and Vajra met with another of her lovers, [[Thestus Thongolir]], a former priest of the dark goddess [[Shar]], for some insight; he warned Shar was present in the city. Kyriani and Vajra went to the House of the Moon and rescued Timoth and Onyx from the [[Swords of the Lady|Lunatics]]; Kyriani's ''magic missiles'' produced ''blooms'' instead. They unmasked one of Lunatics, expecting Shar but finding instead a brainwashed Luna!{{Cite comic/Lunatics}} The maddened Luna briefly got away, her magical defenses blowing away Kyriani's ''[[glitterdust]]'', before Vajra tackled her and convinced her of the truth, realizing that the false Selûne was in fact Shar. They escaped Shar and the temple, found the streets wrecked, tangled with [[night rider]]s, and observed the [[Celestial Stairway]] rising from [[Mount Waterdeep]]. Returning to Selûne's Smile, they found the inn in ruins and were ambushed by the avatar of Shar, armed with the [[Rod of Oblivion]], determined to revenge herself on the heroes and slay Selûne. Powerless, Luna fell victim to the rod. Kyriani pleaded with Shar to leave Luna alone, and hurled an ''[[ice storm]]'' at the goddess when she would not. Kyriani valiantly held Shar off while Timoth, Vajra, and Onyx struggled to open the dimensional doorway to Luna's inner room, where her godly power was stored, and released Selûne's godly power to Luna. She transformed into the true avatar of Selûne and with her ''[[light]]'' blasted away Shar's darkness. Shar vanished, and Selûne became Luna once more. The companions reunited, Luna vowed to rebuild her inn.{{Cite comic/Total Eclipse}}

After the Smile's brief destruction, Kyriani aided [[Khelben Arunsun]] in driving [[lawyers (Waterdeep)|lawyers]] out of the city. Using Onyx as an unwitting patsy, while he distracted by [[Drusilla]], Kyriani disguised herself as an old woman and got his autograph—on a marriage contract. In the [[Lord's Court]], the lawyers got Lord [[Piergeiron]] to rule the contract valid and the marriage official. Afterward, Khelben took the lead lawyer to meet Onyx and his alleged wife on their court-appointed wedding night, claiming Onyx had to fulfill a dwarf marriage custom, the "Bedchamber Trek", or else the marriage would be invalid. The lawyer had to escort Onyx to the bed to enforce the ruling. However, Khelben created a nightmarish [[illusion]] for this trek and the terrified lawyer fled in horror, abandoning Onyx and thus reneging on the lawyers' contract with the city, rendering it void as Khelben had planned. Kyriani revealed herself, but the two were now apparently officially married.{{Cite comic/Lawyers!}}

On the hottest day of summer, in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Vajra and Timoth arm-wrestled in the Smile as Kyriani watched on with her beau Fenn. Little did they know that their contest was magically enhanced, releasing [[Aviss]] and [[Fellandar]] from their extra-dimensional prison to wreak a path of destruction in the city. Kyriani and Onyx pursued and fought them. Finally, [[Khelben Arunsun]] hurled the villains back into their prison. Fell was impressed with Kyriani's prowess.{{Cite comic/Summer in the City}}

When Luna left Waterdeep and the others traveled south to fight in the [[Reclamation Wars]] in [[Tethyr]], Kyriani was given ownership of Selûne's Smile and became a high-ranking member of Selûne's faith. She began an apprenticeship under Lady [[Alathene Moonstar]] and found she had a gift for magic.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Kyriani became a [[Lord of Waterdeep]] after the resignation of [[Danilo Thann]].

===Moonstar===
[[File:Kyriani Agrivar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kyriani Agrivar, as a [[Moonstar agent]].]]
After working with Khelben for years, Kyriani began acting as an independent and highly skilled agent of the [[Moonstars]], the organization headed by Khelben. Thanks to her own divided (often literally) heritage, she appreciated the ''[[Tel'Teukiira]]'s'' aims to unify humans and elves. Her area of operation was Waterdeep and the cities along the [[Dessarin River]].

Late on the night of [[Greengrass]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], two wizards engaged in a massive [[spell]]-battle around [[Piergeiron]]'s Palace in Waterdeep. Kyriani and [[Laeral Silverhand]] made an effort to stop the battle, ending in one palace tower being destroyed and both mages slain, one of them a [[Manshoon]].

===Blackstaff===
When Khelben Arunsun died, Kyriani continued as a friend and advisor to the second Blackstaff, [[Tsarra Chaadren|Tsarra Chasdren]]. In the [[1399 DR|Year of Fallen Friends, 1399 DR]], Tsarra was killed in battle against a group of [[vampire]] wizards. Kyriani retrieved Tsarra's blackstaff, and returned it to [[Blackstaff Tower]] for safekeeping. Upon her arrival, she was named as the third Blackstaff with [[Caladorn Cassalanter]] at her side atop Blackstaff Tower. The same year, she wrote a book titled ''[[A Life Relentless]]''.

After Kyriani's death, her spirit remained in Blackstaff Tower to guide and advise future Blackstaffs. This was due to her wearing the ''[[kiira N'Vaelhar]]''.

==Personality==
The first Kyriani was a wholly good person, denying the natural dark side of her being. Kyriani didn't like to see her friends get hurt, nor would she leave them to face danger, even if there was a greater need.

However, the second Kyriani was more accepting of her dark side, and felt able to choose her destiny. She said her two previously warring halves had at last been properly merged into one complete person.

==Description==
Around [[1357 DR]], Kyriani appeared to be a tall and slender [[half-elf]] woman, quite beautiful, with pointed ears and pale skin, despite her [[drow]] heritage. Other details of her appearance varied with her incarnation. The first incarnation of Kyriani had a large mane of long, curly, light-brown hair, with violet or blue eyes. The second had even longer hair, night black and filled with stars, with a streak of white hair in front. Her eyes were blue.

By [[1372 DR]], Kyriani had darker-hued skin and gray eyes and was considered very attractive. She had long silver-white hair that she generally wore pulled away from her face.

==Abilities==
As a mage, Kyriani knew the [[spell]]s ''[[black tentacles]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Suspicion!|5}} [[hold person|''hold person'']], ''[[bloom]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Selune Rising|4}} ''[[clairaudience]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Suspicion!|16}} ''[[dimension door]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Burning Questions|5}} ''[[dispel magic]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Death and the Dragon's Eye|17}} ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[glitterdust]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Total Eclipse|5}} ''[[ice storm]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Total Eclipse|20}} ''[[minute meteors]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Burning Questions|16}} ''[[phantasmal force]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Death and the Dragon's Eye|13}} ''[[shield]]'', ''[[stoneskin]]'', ''[[wall of fog]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Suspicion!|10}} and ''[[web]]''.<ref>{{Cite comic/Death and the Dragon's Eye|5}} She could sense [[magic]], such as when she felt evil magic before the opening of an extra-dimensional prison holding Aviss and Fellandar.

==Relationships==
Kyriani had a half-brother, [[Priam Agrivar]] the [[paladin]].

Kyriani was notorious for the many lovers she maintained, and was cryptic when asked how many. Among them were [[Fenn Estelmer]], whom she thought a twit but a good romancer, and ignored or disposed of when he was in the way; [[Rellamyn]], a roguish barbarian adventurer who was good for a ride on his [[asperii]]; and [[Thestus Thongolir]], a wealthy aged priest of many gods.
