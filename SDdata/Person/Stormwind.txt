Stormwind was an ancient treant inhabiting the Ashenwood in Rashemen during the late 14 century DR.
Stormwind was large even for a treant. In fact, he was so large that he was sometimes mistaken to be the mysterious Wood man.
Though he slept for decades at a time, Stormwind would wake whenever the wychlaran needed his wise council for a pressing matter.
