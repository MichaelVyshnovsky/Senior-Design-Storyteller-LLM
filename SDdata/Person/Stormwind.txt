'''Stormwind''' was an ancient [[treant]] inhabiting the [[Ashenwood]] in [[Rashemen]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Stormwind was large even for a treant. In fact, he was so large that he was sometimes mistaken to be the mysterious [[Wood man]].

==Activities==
Though he slept for decades at a time, Stormwind would wake whenever the [[wychlaran]] needed his wise council for a pressing matter.
