'''Ka'rashur''' was a [[baatezu]] from the [[Nine Hells]] who came to be trapped within [[Watcher's Keep]] along with his [[devil]] allies during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Ka'rashur possessed the resistances and immunities that were common among [[fiend]]s, including some natural [[regeneration]].

==Possessions==
He was in possession of a ''scepter gem'' missing from the ''[[scepter of radiance]]'', which granted access to the fourth level of Watcher's Keep.

==Activities==
The powerful fiend led a a group of devils that were thoroughly dedicated to fighting in the [[Blood War]]. He sought the heart of the [[tanar'ri]] [[Tahazzar]], the leader of [[demon]]s on the opposite side of the eternal conflict.

==History==
Ka'rashur and his devils became trapped within Watcher's Keep on [[Faerûn]] alongside [[Tahazzar]] and his demons. The two groups of fiends fought within the Maze Level of the keep, sending their slain foes back to their respective homes among the [[lower planes]].
