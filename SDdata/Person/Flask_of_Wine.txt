Flask of Wine was a tabaxi guide, and Zhentarim agent, that worked out of Port Nyanzaru in the late 15 century DR. He worked alongside his sister, River Mist.
Flask of Wine was rather tall and slender for a tabaxi, at 58" (1.7 meters) and 140 lbs (63.5 kg).
Flask was an outgoing individual who preferred to be around others. Despite this, he seldom spoke and did so with a bit of a lisp.
Flask and River charged their clients 4 gp a day as guides, but offered to waive their fees for a share of any treasure they found.
Due to their allegiance with the Zhentarim, Flask and River Mist owed no financial dues to the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru.
