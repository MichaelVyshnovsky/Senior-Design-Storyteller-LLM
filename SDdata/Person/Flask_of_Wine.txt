'''Flask of Wine''' was a [[tabaxi]] guide, and [[Zhentarim]] agent, that worked out of [[Port Nyanzaru]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He worked alongside his sister, [[River Mist]].

==Appearance==
Flask of Wine was rather tall and slender for a tabaxi, at 5'8" (1.7 meters) and 140 lbs (63.5 kg).

==Personality==
Flask was an outgoing individual who preferred to be around others. Despite this, he seldom spoke and did so with a bit of a lisp.

==Activities==
Flask and River charged their clients 4 [[gp]] a day as guides, but offered to waive their fees for a share of any treasure they found.

Due to their allegiance with the Zhentarim, Flask and River Mist owed no financial dues to the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru.
