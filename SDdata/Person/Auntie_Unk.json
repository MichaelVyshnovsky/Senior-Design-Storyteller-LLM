        "mainbody": "'''Auntie Unk''' was a [[sea hag]] in the [[Thunder Cliff Caves]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She and her sisters [[Nana Pocktuss]] and [[Granny Muyuk]] formed a sea hag coven.",
        "Personality": "Unk loved gossip and was bored with the fanatical [[Talos]] cultists she was allied with.",
        "Activities": "Unk and her sisters ate the edible body parts of drowned sailors and animated the inedible body parts as [[skull flier]]s to protect their lair.",
        "Relationships": "The [[Cult of Talos]] maintained a base of operations in the Thunder Cliff Caves. The sea hags had come to terms with the cultists and entered into a mutual-protection agreement. In addition, the followers of Talos provided the corpses of sailors who drowned after being shipwrecked on the magical reefs. In return, the coven assisted the cult with specific issues.",
        "History": "Auntie Unk spent a few years in the [[Mere of Dead Men]]. She adducted travelers off the [[High Road]] and questioned them about news of [[Waterdeep]] or [[Neverwinter]] before eating them. Unk was the last sea hag to join the coven at the Thunder Cliffs.\n\n''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], the Thunder Cliff Caves were attacked by a group of [[adventurers]]. Their main objective was to defeat the Talos cultists but they also confronted Unk and her sisters."
