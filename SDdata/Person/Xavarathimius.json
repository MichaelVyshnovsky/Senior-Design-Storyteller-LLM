        "mainbody": "'''Xavarathimius''', known only as '''The Everlasting Wyrm''', was a male [[great wyrm]] [[green dragon]] [[dracolich]] dwelling in the [[Sharawood]] in the [[Shaar]],{{Cite web enhancement/Roll Call of Dragons}} a place known also as the Drakewood.",
        "History": "He was bound by the [[Wychlaran|Witches of Rashemen]] to guard the [[demon lord]] [[Eltab]]'s prison beneath the [[Sharawood]], following the liberation of [[Rashemen]] from [[demon]] rule in the {{YearlinkName|-75}}.<ref>\n\nThen, in the {{YearlinkName|106}}, the [[Church of Myrkul|Myrkulyte]] crusaders from the [[Castle of Al'hanar]] assaulted and destroyed the Everlasting Wyrm and looted his hoard. Discovering Eltab in his prison, they released the demon lord in exchange for 99 years of service, and went on to become [[death knight]]s and establish the theocracy of [[Eltabranar]]. Yet even after Eltab was gone, the Everlasting Wyrm reformed and remained.<ref>\n\nThereafter, once every hundred years, the [[Knights of the Undying Dragon]], as they were now known, continued to ride out of Al'hanar Castle to slay the Everlasting Wyrm and a number of his many still-living offspring. The death knights succeeded and returned with the dragon's hoard each time, yet the Everlasting Wyrm always reformed over a decade or two and rebuilt its hoard and its schemes. They were still doing this into the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and seemed set to do it forever.\n\nBut, following the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]], much of Al'hanar Castle was destroyed and Xavarathimius finally struck back. In a violent attack on the ruined castle, he sent his minions to wipe out the knights. Thereafter, they occupied the site and guarded their master's stolen hoard.\n\nBy [[1479 DR]], the Everlasting Wyrm had thrown his lot in with the [[Beastlands]], and was considered to have the support and power needed to unite its monstrous denizens under his reign.",
        "Activities": "Lairing in the deepest and darkest woods, Xavarathimius formulated wicked schemes and assembled minions to do his bidding, often making slaves of any local nomads who stumbled across him. Otherwise, he tried to stay unnoticed and unobserved by the outside world.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Everlasting Wyrm was known in Shaar legend only as a terrifying [[undead]] monster that haunted the Sharawood and stole bodies and transformed them into [[zombie]] slaves."
