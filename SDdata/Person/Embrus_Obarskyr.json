        "mainbody": "mbrus \"the Old\" was so named because he was the ripe age of 49 when he took the throne as the sixth Obarskyr monarch of Cormyr after the death of his younger brother Rhiiman the Glorious in 79 DR. Although he was the second son of King Faerlthann, his father declared him to be last in the line of succession.\nEmbrus had two sons, Kaspler and Imbre, both born before his coronation, ensuring the continuation of his line in the wake of three consecutive heir-less kings."
