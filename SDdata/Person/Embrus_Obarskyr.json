Although he was the second son of [[Faerlthann Obarskyr|King Faerlthann]], his father declared him to be last in the line of succession.",
        "Relationships": "Embrus had two sons, [[Kaspler Obarskyr|Kaspler]] and [[Imbre Obarskyr|Imbre]], both born before his coronation, ensuring the continuation of his line in the wake of three consecutive heir-less kings."
