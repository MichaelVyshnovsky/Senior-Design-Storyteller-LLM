'''Jelde Asturien''' was one of the original [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Jelde was born as '''Semoor Wolftooth''' in [[Espar]] village. He went to search of fortune with [[Florin Falconhand]], [[Doust Sulwood]], and [[Islif Lurelake]]. During their adventures, he found his vocation as a cleric of [[Lathander]] and in order to follow the god's dogma, he renamed himself "Jelde Asturien."

At some point before [[1369 DR]], after forming the Knights of Myth Drannor, Jelde found his way into the ancient tomb under the mansion of [[House Ammath]] in [[Glim-Gardens]] and created a vault in one of its secret rooms. The vault contained Jelde's ''[[blade of destruction]]'' and a set of ''[[arcane mail]]''.

Later, he served as seneschal of the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]] in [[Shadowdale]] and fought against [[drow]], [[Zhentarim]], and [[Lashan Aumersair]]. After this last adventure, Jelde retired to [[Eveningstar]] to serve his god.
