Yegor was the leader of a cell of the Cult of the Black Earth in the Moonsea.
Yegor led an earth cultist cell in the Moonsea they acted as minor pirates until 1491 DR. That year, they were tasked with taking the elemental codex from Furgis Boltsmelter. Yegors minions tried many times to take it but were always defeated. At last, Yegor himself led a last group of cultists against Furgis and/or his adventuring party bodyguards, who were talking with the drow wizard Murssvayas Dhuurniv, but they were defeated and Yegor killed.
