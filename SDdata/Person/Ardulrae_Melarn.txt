'''Ardulrae Melarn''' was a member of [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]] and Matron of Scriptures of [[Arach-Tinilith]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
Ardulrae was the third daughter of [[Kyrnill Melarn]] and thanks to the strength of the new House Melarn she rose through the ranks of the Arach-Tinilith instructors. Ardulrae's main objective was actually to take total control of the school for her house. Her spies constantly moved among the halls, hoping to unveil the secrets of Ardulrae's rivals.
