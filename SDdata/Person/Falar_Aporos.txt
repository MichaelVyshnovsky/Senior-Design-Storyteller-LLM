Falar Aporos was a criminal in Calaunt.
He was young, lanky and clean-shaven. His hair was curly, and his face was foxy. He wore a finely stitched and embroidered cloak, jerkin and breeches.
Falar was thought to be always looking for an advantage. 
Falar Aporos had at least one sword. He also employed a sling.
Falar Aporos rescued Taegan Nightwind from an ambush.  Afterwards, they discussed his fate, and Taegan volunteered to steal Arveene Dalurieth, whom Falar described as his beloved, from the tower where her father kept her.
However, Falar was actually behind the ambush, which he used as cover to kill Vonn Dalurieths dire bear and steal the other with his men. Taegan Nightwind found him days later hiding in a warehouse with the bear. There was a fight, and Falar was killed by the stolen bear during it.
