'''Mogion''' was the leader of the [[Survivors of Moander]] cult in [[Y没lash]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
The daughter of a [[Sembia]]n noble, Mogion joined the cult of [[Moander]] and rose to the position of high priestess.

In 1357 DR, Mogion, for the first time, received a call from her god summoning her to Y没lash. Soon Mogion settled in the ruined city and despite her god's [[avatar]] having been destroyed by [[Alias]]'s party, Mogion grew in power and clerical abilities until she was named the next Mouth of Moander.

Soon she contacted [[Radatha]] of the [[Fire Knives]] in order to start the [[New Alliance]].

When the adventuring party possessing the [[Azure Bonds]] arrived in Y没lash, Mogion started preparations for a ritual to awaken Moander. However, something went wrong during the ritual and Moander fused himself with Mogion, creating a mindless monster of destruction but the adventurers destroyed her before it was too late.
