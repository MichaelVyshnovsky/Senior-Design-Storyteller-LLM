        "mainbody": "'''Gruuman Xuluksh''', also known as the '''Rage Mystic''', was a veteran [[orc]] warrior in the service of the [[Orc pantheon|orcish god]] [[Gruumsh]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''This orc has been feeding his god with the blood of vanquished foes for too long. As Gruumsh gluts himself on ill-gotten spoils, he grows bold and threatens the balance of the cosmos.''|[[Dyrl Godsword]]}}",
        "Activities": "Gruuman was known to have slain many enemies in honor of Gruumsh over his long career as a warrior, and he had become something of a spiritual leader among the orcs of [[Many-Arrows]]. His rages had been likened to an uncontrollable fire.",
        "History": "Gruuman was getting old in the late 15{{th}} century DR, but he still led the worship of Gruumsh among the Many-Arrows invaders of [[Neverwinter]] to ensure the god's continued support of their campaign. In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Gruuman became a target of [[Dyrl Godsword]], a worshiper of [[Cyric]], in his bid to weaken Gruumsh's influence in Neverwinter. Dyrl set about recruiting devoted [[clerics]] of [[good]] [[Deity|deities]] to hunt down Gruuman with claims that \"the gods\" were mad about the famous orc's presence in Neverwinter."
