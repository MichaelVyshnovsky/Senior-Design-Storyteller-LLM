Cyrvisnea was an ogre mage who attacked the southern cities of Amn in West Faer√ªn.
In 1370 DR, Cyrvisnea along with Sythillis,her mate, led a goblinoid army with hill giants and worshipers of Cyric on an assault on southern Amn as a part of the Sothillisian War. The end of this endeavor led with the capturing of gold from Maztica in Murann. In 1374 DR, the army was still occupying the city of Murann.
