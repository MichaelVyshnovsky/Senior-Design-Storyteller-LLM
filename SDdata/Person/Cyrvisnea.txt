'''Cyrvisnea''' was an [[ogre mage]] who attacked the southern cities of [[Amn]] in [[West Faer√ªn]].

==History==
In [[1370 DR]], Cyrvisnea along with [[Sythillis]],her mate, led a [[goblinoid]] army with [[hill giant]]s and worshipers of [[Cyric]] on an assault on southern [[Amn]] as a part of the [[Sothillisian War]]. The end of this endeavor led with the capturing of gold from [[Maztica]] in [[Murann]]. In [[1374 DR]], the army was still occupying the city of [[Murann]].
