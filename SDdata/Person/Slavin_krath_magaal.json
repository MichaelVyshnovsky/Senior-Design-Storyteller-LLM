        "History": "Slavin was a young brown dragon, part of a dragon generation that had dealings with [[Tiamat]], who agreed to collaborate with the  Tiamatian [[cleric]] [[Malise]] in exchange for rituals to boost her power; these rituals gave her the fiendish archetype. \n\nLater in life, her offspring Braeden had a vision of something monstrous emerging from the [[Pit of Many Colors]], which was dismissed by Malise. Feeling that he had lost touch with the will of Tiamat, Slavin and Braeden began plotting together to overthrow him."
