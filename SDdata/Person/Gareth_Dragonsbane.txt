King '''Gareth Dragonsbane''' was the [[paladin]]–king of [[Damara]] who ruled during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Prior to his reign he was a famed adventurer who, along with his allies, defeated the [[Zhengyi|Witch-King Zhengyi]] and thwarted the schemes of the [[demon lord]] [[Orcus]].{{Cite dragon/367/Epic Faerûn|8}}

==Personality==
While he achieved many great deeds during his life, Gareth Dragonsbane was not driven by personal ambition. He did what he felt was best for the people of the [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone barony]], and all of Damara. 

He was described as being rather uptight and reserved.

==Possessions==
Gareth Dragonsbane wore a magical set of [[plate mail]] and carried an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[shield]]. He carried with him a ''[[silver horn of Valhalla]]'', which summoned forth several [[barbarian]]s from their [[afterlife]] in [[Warrior's Rest]]. 

In battle, he wielded the [[Sentient item|intelligent]] ''[[holy avenger]]'' [[longsword]] called ''[[Crusader (sword)|Crusader]]''.

==Activities==
Throughout the years, Gareth Dragonsbane lived the life of an [[adventurer]], soldier, lord, and general.

In the years following those he spent in war or adventuring across the Bloodstone Lands, King Dragonsbane embarked upon numerous endeavors to ensure the security of his lands. He began construction on the [[Vaasan Gate|Vaasan]] and [[Damaran Gate]]s, two fortresses that protected either end of the [[Bloodstone Pass]]. He ennobled lesser lords to justly rule over Damara's outlying lands and attracted bands of adventurers to protect its growing economic interests.

==Relationships==
During his years as an adventurer, Gareth fell in love with the [[druid]] [[Christine Dragonsbane|Christine]], daughter of [[Tranth|Baron Tranth]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|79}}

While some of the War-Captains of [[Impiltur]] were quite weary of Gareth during his campaign as Baron of Bloodstone, he was seen in a favorable light by [[Haelimbrar]] of the [[Lords of Imphras II]]. Gareth enjoyed an enduring friendship with his fellow paladin [[Justin M'Dael]], had a strong ally in [[Dormythyrr]] of [[Goliad]], But greatest among his friends were those adventurers he spent adventuring alongside for two long years.

Gareth earned great renown thanks to the [[Soravian Talebringers]], and was aided in his unification efforts by the [[Twilight Riders]], who were led by his long-time adventuring companion [[Emelyn|Emelyn the Gray]].

He had a faithful companion and trusted mount in the intelligent [[warhorse]] named [[Glendan]].

==History==
===Early Life===
In his younger days, Sir Gareth Dragonsbane was an adventurer and a knight in the service of the [[Order of the Golden Cup]]. During his knighthood he tithed half of his monetary gains to the knightly organization. Despite this, he became a very wealthy man and established a comfortable homestead on a large estate in the northern region of Damara.

During the [[Vaasan War]] against Zhengyi the Witch-King, he served as a Brigade Commander in the Army of Damara and succeeded in every task put before him. Unfortunately, the Witch-King's war against the nation tore apart Gareth's comfortable life. Gareth traveled to the southern baronies of Damara, which were now nothing more than vassals to [[Vaasa]].

===Bloodstone Adventures and Lordship===
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Gareth was recruited along with six other adventurers—[[Olwen Forest-Friend]], [[Friar Dugald]], [[Riordan Parnell]], [[Celedon Kierney]], Emelyn the Gray, and [[Kane]]—to protect the [[Bloodstone Village|village of Bloodstone]] from an army of bandits led by the [[Grandfather of Assassins]]. After a difficult battle, the heroes prevailed and all of them, save for Kane, continued on a quest to further aid the lands.

The group was then sent to investigate the recently abandoned [[Bloodstone Mines]] after a series of vicious [[wereworg]] attacks. In the mines, Gareth and his allies discovered a temple to [[Orcus]] constructed by the native [[duergar]]. They planned to create a ''[[gate]]'' that would grant Orcus entry to [[Toril]] on the [[Prime Material plane]]. Fortunately, the adventurers allied themselves with the community of [[svirfneblin]] led by [[Ruggedo|King Ruggedo]], defeated the gray dwarves, and halted their dark [[ritual]].

In an act that greatly benefited the entire region, King Ruggedo reopened the Bloodstone Mines and formed an alliance with the Bloodstone barony. As Sir Gareth was set to marry Lady Christine, he received a dowry from her father Tranth. Gareth was declared the 6{{th}} Baron of Bloodstone, and entrusted with rulership over its lands.

As Bloodstone grew more prosperous with the reopening of the mines, the town flourished. Following the savage winter of 1358 DR, in spring of the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, the svirfneblin along with [[dwarves]] of [[Clan Orothiar]] managed to mine an amount of [[bloodstone]] worth a total of 1,000,000 [[gold pieces]] from within the Galena Mountains. Baron Dragonsbane used these riches to invest in his lands and establish a new army, which was led by his friends and allies.

===Bloodstone Wars===
This newfound wealth brought new dangers. Duke [[William Horgath|William "the Lazy"]] of [[Arcata]] colluded with the new Grandfather of Assassins to make an assassination attempt on Gareth and other members of the newly formed [[Council of Bloodstone]]. This dastardly deed spurred the beginning of the second regional war within two years, which came to be known as the [[Bloodstone Wars]].

Gareth's forces easily dispatched an Arcatan army that attempted to invade his domain, at which point the [[Carmathan|Duchy of Carmathan]] joined the fray, and was ultimately defeated as well. News spread of Baron Dragonbane's two victories, and the Vaasan puppet baronies of [[Ostel]], [[Morov]], and [[Polten]] chose to unite their forces and all attack Bloodstone at once. They lost on the battlefield to the armies of Bloodstone. Within a matter of [[tenday]]s, the territories of Damara had finally been united.

Seeing the turmoil in Damara as an opportunity, the forces of the Witch-king took action. The Grandfather of Assassins lured Gareth and his forces to an unassailable fortress in southern Damara. Gareth and his original adventuring companions, who had each become a leader in their own right during the war, disguised themselves as assassins and infiltrated the otherwise impenetrable fortress. Just like in their previous adventures, the heroes emerged victorious.

Unfortunately, this was the last straw for Zhengyi, who amassed the armies of Vaasa to put down the impudent Damarans in the south. The Vaasan army marched south across the Galenas, The Vaasan and Bloodstone armies fought a [[Battle at Goliad|great battle]] at the site of Damara's greatest defeat against Vaasa, many years before. The battle ended in a stalemate with each army held at either side of the [[Goliad River]]. Zhengyi's [[undead]] troops could not move south beyond the river as it was too far from the source of Zhengyi's power, [[Castle Perilous]].

===The Abyss, Seven Heavens, and Nine Hells===
It was up to the six adventurers to take up one more quest in the name of Damara. Gareth and his allies traveled north to Vaasa and struck at  Zhengyi's seat of power, Castle Perilous itself. They ventured deeper into the castle, defeating [[demon]]s and the [[dragon]] [[Arctigis]], before they finally defeated the Witch-King Zhengyi in his own throne room.

But deep under the castle, the heroes discovered an underground chamber that led far below the surface of Toril. Within its depths was a ''gate'' that opened to the [[Abyss]]. [[Saint Sollars|Saint Sollars the Twice-Martyred]] himself appeared to the party and informed them that [[Bahamut]] wanted to prevent Orcus—Zhengyi's patron—from getting to the Material Plane. Thus, the heroes were tasked with traveling through the Abyss to the realm of Orcus to steal his [[Wand of Orcus|namesake wand]] and deliver it to the [[Seven Heavens]].

Gareth and his companions traveled across dozens of [[Layers of the Abyss|Abyssal layers]] before they finally reached Orcus's domain of [[Thanatos (Abyss)|Thanatos]]. Once there, they lured Orcus away from his Abyssal castle, stole the wand, and fled to the [[Astral Plane]].

The [[tome archon]] [[Terxyx]] escorted them to meet Saint Sollars once again, before they all traveled to the [[Palace of the Platinum Dragon]]. The dragon god Bahamut gave the adventurers their final task: they would travel to the plane of [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]], slay the avatar of the Dragon Queen [[Tiamat]], and steep the ''Wand of Orcus'' in her blood. They were successful in their last quest and the wand burst when it was placed within Tiamat's blood. All that remained was the heart of Orcus's implement, a small white jewel known as the ''[[Tree-Gem of Bloodstone|Tree-Gem]]''.

===Reign over Damara===
[[File:GarethDragonsbaneCoronation.png|thumb|left|225px|''Gareth's Dragonsbane's coronation as King of Damara in 1359 DR.'']]
After reporting their victory to Bahamut, the group returned to Bloodstone on the Prime Material Plane. The destruction of the ''Wand of Orcus'' caused Zhengyi's undead army to crumble into nothingness. The remnants of his monstrous forces either fled back to Vaasa or were cut down by the Bloodstone army.

Soon after, the soldiers left the field of battle and marched on to the city of [[Heliogabalus]] before the year's end. Despite the efforts of his political rival [[Dimian Ree]], Baron Gareth Dragonsbane was crowned King of all Damara.

Following his coronation, King Dragonsbane undertook a [[Gareth Dragonsbane#Activities|number of ventures]] to ensure the continued safety and prosperity of his lands.

Nearly a decade later in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, King Dragonsbane commuted the executions of the [[Bregan D'aerthe]] leaders, [[Jarlaxle]] and [[Artemis Entreri]], following their involvement with the [[Zhengyian construct]] and the replicated Castle Perilous. He merely exiled the pair from his kingdom.

Half a decade later, on [[Mirtul 3]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the king led his army into battle against a horde of monstrous creatures led by a supposed second Witch-King. However, he was betrayed by some [[wizard]]s within his group, who were in fact [[Cult of the Dragon]] agents working for this Witch-King, their grand leader [[Sammaster]]. His soul was imprisoned on the [[Plane of Shadow]], leaving Damara without a ruler for a short time. On [[Kythorn 25]] of that year, the [[smoke drake]] [[Capnolithyl]] led a band of [[dragonslayer]]s to save Gareth from his fate. Once he was returned to Toril, the king took command of his army and routed the army of [[orc]]s and [[giant]]s from Damara's lands.

Over time, King Dragonsbane united the lands of Damara and Vaasa into a single realm known as the kingdom of [[Bloodstone Lands#The Kingdom of Bloodstone|Bloodstone]]. This great feat brought years of peace to the otherwise conflict-stricken lands of Vaasa, and brought relative peace to the Bloodstone Lands that lasted until the mid–15{{th}} century DR.
