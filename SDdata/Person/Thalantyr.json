        "mainbody": "Thalantyr was a wizard, specialized in conjuration, and a former adventurer who lived in his house called High Hedge, west of Beregost.\nLater retired, Thalantyr was more at home helping others through magic or advice for a fee. He appeared to never want to see his old adventuring partners again and enjoyed a quiet life. Most of the time, the wizard was happy walking outside alone, not welcoming visitors, nor accepting apprentices.\nThe noble archmage owned a long dark staff of power and took it on all his trips, whether it was to the town of Beregost or to a distant plane. \nLong ago, Thalantyr was a treasure hunter who quested for the lost magic of Netheril in desolate fortresses and keeps. On one such journey, the wizard appeared to have been captured by a horrid beast and only escaped through his quick thinking and the forgotten spells of Netheril."
