        "mainbody": "'''Adabra Gwynn''' was an acolyte of [[Chauntea]] who lived in a stone windmill on [[Umbrage Hill]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "She served as the local midwife and [[apothecary]] for the nearby village of [[Phandalin]]. She used the millstone of the windmill in which she lived to pulverize the ingredients for her medicines.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Adabra was a valued member of the Phandalin community despite having little interest in visiting the town, or even in taking shelter there during dangerous times. She instead made her home outside of town in the old windmill on Umbridge Hill, using the first floor as her apothecary shop, the second floor as her own living space, and reserving the third floor for guests. \n\nWhen the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] began terrorizing the region, the people of Phandalin feared for Adabra's safety, and Townmaster [[Harbin Wester]] offered to pay anyone willing to brave the short journey to check on her and urge her to return to town. He was somewhat right to be worried as Adabra's home was attacked by a [[manticore]], which had been driven from from its mountaintop nest in the [[Sword Mountains]] by the dragon."
