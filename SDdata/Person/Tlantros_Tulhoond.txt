'''Tlantros Tulhoond''' was one of the eight members of the First Zulkirate and a [[Zulkir]] of [[Conjuration]] in [[1030 DR]].

==Description==
He was an aloof and reticent [[human]] Thayan male. He was somewhat paranoid and feared being attacked. As such, Tlantros was ready to defend himself at all times. He was also a connoisseur of the finest music and [[wine]]s. He could read finer details of people's body language.

==Abilities==
Tlantros always had a plethora of schemes and "hanging" [[spell]]s in place. His complex web of spells was used for defending and countering enemies. The zulkir also had monsters ready to be summoned from afar in a blink of an eye if the need arose.

==History==
Tlantros Tulhoond became the first member of the [[Council of Zulkirs]] from the school of conjuration magic in the autumn of the {{YearlinkName|1030}}. The council was assembled under the [[diviner]] [[lich]] [[Ythazz Buvaar]]. The title allowed Tlantros to select the [[tharchion]]s and gave him absolute control over a sliver of Thay. Unlike his peers, Tlantros Tulhoond was against Thay's over-reliance on slavery and over-using the nation's natural resources through mining. Instead, he advocated for Thay to take anything it needed from other nations by force and magic.

Tlantro's reign as the Zullkir of Conjuration came to an end sometime before the late {{YearlinkName|1300}}.
