        "mainbody": "'''Mythkar Leng''' was a male [[human]] [[cleric]] of first [[Bane]] and later [[Cyric]] in the late 1350s and 1360s [[DR]]. He was a member of the [[Zhentarim]], leading their activities in [[northwest Faerûn]], and an advisor to Lord [[Geildarr Ithym]] of [[Llorkh]] in the [[Savage Frontier]].",
        "Activities": "Mythkar Leng was the local leader of the Zhentarim in northwest Faerûn, a position he held by [[1358 DR]] and through to at least [[1370 DR]]. His goal was to dominate trade routes across the [[North]] and up and down the [[Sword Coast North]]. To this end, the town of Llorkh was selected as the Zhentarim's foothold in the North, thanks to its distance from the rival powers of [[Silverymoon]] and [[Waterdeep]]. The Zhentarim took over Llorkh shortly before [[1357 DR]], making it their base and Mythkar's Zhentarim thus achieved a monopoly on trade between Llorkh and [[Loudwater]]. They also set up a base in [[Secomber]] and placed agents in strategic positions in [[Triboar]], Waterdeep, [[Yartar]], and [[Zundbridge]].\n\nOstensibly, he served as an advisor to Lord Geildarr of Llorkh.\n\nMythkar also managed a shrine dedicated to Bane in Llorkh. However, by [[1367 DR]], having converted from the worship of the deceased god Bane, Mythkar was high priest of a full-fledged temple to Cyric called the [[Dark Sun (temple)|Dark Sun]] in the town.",
        "Relations": "In truth, Geildarr was a lesser-ranked member of the Zhentarim, whom Mythkar kept in line and pursuing the Zhentarim's plans for the North. In this, he was aided by the [[beholder]] [[Rakaxalorth]].\n\nMythkar was allied with the [[Beast Lord]] of [[Dekanter]]. He was opposed in his efforts to dominate the region by the [[Harpers]] and the [[Lords' Alliance]]."
