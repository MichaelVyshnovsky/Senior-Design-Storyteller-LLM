        "mainbody": "raman (also known as Eveshi and Ahrraman) was a priest of the former god of the dead, Myrkul, and later a Red Wizard who lived in Mulsantir in Thay in the late 14 century DR.\nHe, along with his brother Akachi, was offered as a \"sacrifice\" and he was given the name \"Eveshi\". He became a priest of Myrkul like his brother but unlike him Eveshi was shy and seldom spoke, often remaining in the shadow of his brother, though he would sometimes laugh or giggle. Akachi named him \"Ahrraman\".\nAhrraman remained a cleric of Myrkul while his brother rose through the ranks, becoming high priest and a Chosen of his god.\nWhen, in the wake of the death of the Founder, Akachi turned against his faith and god and started a crusade against Myrkul, Araman loyally joined him. After Akachis defeat, Myrkul himself approached Araman and gave him a choice to join his brother as a spirit eater or to correct these mistakes by killing the Red Woman. Araman chose the latter, and was made immortal and placed under a geas. Araman came to believe he finally made a choice for himself, and tried to correct Akachis acts by pursuing the Founder and returning her to the Wall of the Faithless. His previous reputation as the shy younger brother allowed him to join the Academy of Shapers and Binders unnoticed.\nIn the , he led a coup against the headmistress Nefris, one of the Founders aspects, and sent the Red Wizard Khai Khmun to kill Lienna and Safiya, but the latter, with the help of the Kalach-Cha, killed Khmun. Araman was confronted by the Kalach-Cha in the Founders Sanctum and was ultimately slain in the ensuing battle.\nHis soul, however, had been bound to the Fugue Plane, remaining there until he killed the Red Woman or died trying. He remained devoted to Myrkul, and continued to serve under the new god of the dead, Kelemvor.\nIf the Kalach-Cha chose to undertake the Third Crusade, then Araman would eventually confront the Kalach-Cha at Eternitys End, intent on stopping the crusade. He would be angered by the Kalach-Chas choice, seeing them as stubborn and deluded as Akachi, and wished Myrkul had just left Akachi in the Wall and never started this mess. On the other hand, if the Kalach-Cha betrayed the crusade, then Araman would join the Kalach-Chas party temporarily to help them stop the crusade and retrieve a soul from the Wall. In this case, a vengeful Kaelyn the Dove would attack the Kalach-Cha instead of Araman at Eternitys End."
