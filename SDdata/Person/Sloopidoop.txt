Sloopidoop was a kuo-toa archpriest and a member of the Society of Brilliance during the late 1480s or early 1490s DR.
Details of Sloopidoops early life are unknown, though he eventually founded and joined the Society of Brilliance having done so alongside Omeluum, Grazilaxx, Blurg, Y, and Skriss.
Sloopidoop and all the other members of the society went on a pilgrimage to Gravenhollow some years before the demonic crisis that struck the Underdark in the late 1480s DR.
