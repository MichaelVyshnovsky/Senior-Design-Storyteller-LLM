Susztam Mar-Shinn was a drow illusionist and shadow adept. He was the Head Student of the Inverted Tower and a user of the Shadow Weave in Szith Morcane in the mid-to-late 14 century.
Uncommonly for a drow, Susztam appeared somewhat plump and seemed almost meek upon cursory inspection. He customarily wore dark shirts of grey and black trousers. Susztam wrapped himself in a spider-web patterned cloak of arachnida.
Although appearing less hardened than others of his race, Susztam Mar-Shinn was just as malicious and ambitious as the rest of his kin. Testament to this was his dream of eventually surpassing and taking over from his master, Solom Nedrazak, as archmage of the Inverted Tower. 
Noted as Solom Nedrazaks best student, Susztam was a skilled illusionist and also a practitioner of the Shadow Weave. 
In the , Susztam became the head student of the Inverted Tower under Solom Nedrazaks tutelage. At least until 1372 DR, during the Silence of Lolth and the coup of Szith Morcane by worshipers of Kiaransalee, Susztam maintained this position through careful preparations against any intruders.
