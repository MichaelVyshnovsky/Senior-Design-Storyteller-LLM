        "Description": "In his old age, Duc-Sum had a long white mustache and beard that hung down to his waist.",
        "Abilities": "Duc-Sum was a skilled enough fighter to open his own dojo in Xiousing. He also had skills as a healer, which may have been due to his knowledge of traditional Shou medicine rather than [[divine magic]].",
        "Relationships": "Duc-Sum had one son, [[Chang Li]].",
        "Possessions": "Duc-Sum owned a [[Golden Blade]], one of only nine crafted during the Dynasty of Might.",
        "History": "In [[1419 DR]], Duc-Sum was traveling through [[Cormyr]] with his son when he was summoned to heal young Prince [[Foril I]] who had fallen gravely ill. King [[Azoun V]] was so grateful that he knighted Duc-Sum and granted him control over a new piece of land in Marsember that had been exposed by the drop in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]' water level. The land was settled by Shou immigrants and became known as Xiousing.\n\nDuc-Sum went on to found the [[Lightning Dragon Dojo]] where he taught until he was too old to spar. He was known as a wise and fair ruler of his regency.",
