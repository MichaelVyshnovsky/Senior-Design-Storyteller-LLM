Aubayreer was a historically important wizard, having served as the high mage and later ruled as the Mage-king of Aglarond. He began a magical dynasty that continued on to the reign of the Simbul, the Witch-Queen of Aglarond.
Originally from the Dalelands, Aubayreer was a mage of note in his youth, serving some time in apprenticeship to the Mages of the Covenant. During this time, he kept a personal spellbook from which his earliest crafted spells, such as hailcone, thunderlance, and phase trap, originated.
Aubayreer took only one apprentice in his life, the wizard Nytholops.
