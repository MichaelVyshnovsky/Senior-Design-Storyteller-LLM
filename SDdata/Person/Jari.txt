'''Jari''' was one of the hunters from the [[Wandering Village]] who traveled [[Icewind Dale]] between the [[Ten Towns]] and [[Kuldahar]] on the [[Spine of the World]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Jari sought to impress his beloved [[Anja]]'s father. The beautiful woman had numerous suitors, and her father thought that the men needed to compete for Anja's hand. Jari thought that if he failed to impress his beloved's parent, the couple would have to run away from the Wandering Village together, which was a likely outcome of the competition. Jari was not a good hunter, and in desperation, he thought of entering the deadly [[Fell Wood]] to try and kill one of the great white [[winter wolves]] tho laired there.
