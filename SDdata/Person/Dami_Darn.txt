'''Dami Darn''' was a [[rogue]] and a member of a thieves' guild, active years before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
==History==
Dami Darn carried out the will of [[Umberlee]], the goddess of the sea when she assassinated the [[conjurer]] named [[Looxil]], who betrayed the deity years before. As the reward for Looxil's slaying, Dami was gifted an [[enchanted]] set of [[leather armor]] called the ''[[Armor of Deep Night]]''. Dami Darn perished years later after she received a [[dagger]] in the back from another ambitious member of her thieves' guild.
