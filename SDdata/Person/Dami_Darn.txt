Dami Darn was a rogue and a member of a thieves guild, active years before the 14 century DR.
Dami Darn carried out the will of Umberlee, the goddess of the sea when she assassinated the conjurer named Looxil, who betrayed the deity years before. As the reward for Looxils slaying, Dami was gifted an enchanted set of leather armor called the Armor of Deep Night. Dami Darn perished years later after she received a dagger in the back from another ambitious member of her thieves guild.
