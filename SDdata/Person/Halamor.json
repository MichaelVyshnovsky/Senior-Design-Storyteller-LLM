        "mainbody": "Halamor was a businessman in Khôltar, south Faerûn, sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. He made a fortune renting out rooms and floors of his tower on Orntathtar Way to many finecrafters who deburred, assembled, or polished much of the hardware produced in the Iron City. He died a wealthy man, but even after his death his name was still associated with his eponymous tower and Halamors Sure Service, a package delivery business located on Hael Way."
