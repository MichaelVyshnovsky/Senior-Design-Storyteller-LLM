'''Carita''' was one of the inhabitants of the [[Wandering Village]] who traveled [[Icewind Dale]] between the [[Ten Towns]] and [[Kuldahar]] on the [[Spine of the World]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, traveled with her small community of hunters and gatherers in the harsh northern lands. Unlike other members of the Wandering Village, Carita was not friendly to outsiders and insisted visitors spoke to anyone else in the village but her. Carita was married to [[Kyosti]], one of the Wandering Village's hunters. She, however, was not a loyal wife as she found a consort in [[Leevi]]. The two decided to kill Carita's husband, and she lured him away from the village.

When a group of adventurers from [[Targos]] arrived at the village, they investigated the hunter's disappearance, discovering the truth about the murder. Carita and Leevi fled the Wandering Village. Soon after, Carita and Leevi came across the Beastlord [[Harshom]], who was in pursuit of the adventurers. The pair eagerly informed the Beastlord of the heroes' plans and location. As a reward, both were fed to Harshom's four war-[[bear]]s.
