'''Vleem''' was a [[mantari]] in [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].

==Relationship==
Vleem was always with his companion [[Emrock Uerngulphim]].

==History==
Vleem met and befriended Emrock when the then-thief was pursued by some angry acquaintances to a peak inside [[orc]] territory. Instead of orcs, Emrock met Vleem and they became companions. They remained together for twelve years.

==Activities==
Often he and his companion Emrock saved adventurers trapped in Myth Drannor.

==Personality==
Vleem appeared fearless and stubborn and never abandoned Emrock. He liked Myth Drannor as a lair and hoped to one day bring a mate there.

==Description==
Not only was Vleem a member of the rare [[mantari]] race but he was also member of the even rarer snow-ray variant of that species.
