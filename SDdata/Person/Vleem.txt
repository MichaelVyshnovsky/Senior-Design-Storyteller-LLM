Vleem was a mantari in Myth Drannor in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Vleem was always with his companion Emrock Uerngulphim.
Vleem met and befriended Emrock when the then-thief was pursued by some angry acquaintances to a peak inside orc territory. Instead of orcs, Emrock met Vleem and they became companions. They remained together for twelve years.
Often he and his companion Emrock saved adventurers trapped in Myth Drannor.
Vleem appeared fearless and stubborn and never abandoned Emrock. He liked Myth Drannor as a lair and hoped to one day bring a mate there.
Not only was Vleem a member of the rare mantari race but he was also member of the even rarer snow-ray variant of that species.
