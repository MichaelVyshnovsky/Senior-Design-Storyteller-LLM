'''Shristisanti''', the '''Guardian of the Atrocity''', was a massive serpentine being that dwelled within the ruins of [[Hisari]] for untold ages leading up to the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|I have been waiting, not asleep, not awake but in a constant state of watching. You've brought me to my end.|Shristisanti, to the [[adventurer]]s that would eventually slay him.}}

==Description==
The guardian of Hisari had an elongated serpentine body, with a [[humanoid]] torso and [[snake]]-like head. He was approximately between {{SIrange|16|24|ft|long=yes}} in length.<ref group="note" name="size">While this measurement is not given, it was stated that Shristisanti was easily twice the size of a [[yuan-ti abomination]]. He had mottled yellow scales that were encrusted with some unknown mineral formations.

==Abilities==
Shristisanti could not be harmed while in the inner chamber of the [[sarrukh]] temple of Hisari. He was seemingly protected by the same magical barrier that safeguarded ''the Torque'' within.

When he remained in his lair, Shristisanti could conjure forth waves of liquefied glass and hurl it at his foes.

==Possessions==
Shristisanti wore a bejeweled [[breastplate]] upon his torso, along with bands of [[gold]] on his upper arms.

==Activities==
Shristisanti's whole existence revolved around retrieving the [[blood of the Captive|last remaining blood]] of the entity known as [[the Captive]], and using it to destroy the artifact known as ''[[the Torque]]''.

==History==
{{Quote|Huh. I guess there was a fish in the fishbowl after all.|[[Harp Levesque]], upon first seeing Shristisanti.}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a group of adventurers―[[Harp Levesque]], [[Amhar]], [[Liel]], [[Kitto]], and [[Verran]]―entered into Shristisanti's lair in an attempt to seize ''the Torque'' and keep it out of the possession of the [[mage]] [[Tresco Maynard]]. Unbeknownst to the group, Verran had stolen the ''blood of the Captive'' and had unknowingly drawn the attention of ''the Torque's'' guardian.

Shristisanti attacked the group and easily took the upper hand in the conflict. The group however used the blood to lure Shristisanti away from his lair, allowing them to score a few weakening blows with their weapons. Finally, the [[dwarf]] Amhar triggered an enormous trap set within the grand mosaics that lined the inner walls of Hisari's temple, that rapidly triggered another similar trap. Shristisanti was trapped in a chain reaction of explosions and his body was shredded by hundreds of [[glass]] and [[ceramic]] shards.
