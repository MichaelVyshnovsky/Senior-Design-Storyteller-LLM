'''Xeldar Orsalyn''' was a [[Zhentarim]] fighter in [[1374 DR]].

==History==
In 1374 DR, Xeldar served as a bodyguard to a [[cleric]] of [[Bane]] named [[Livikus Arthantar]] on a visit to the [[Xûl-Jarak]] citadel in [[Thar]] on a mission to pay homage to the new [[orog]] warlord [[Thrull]]. In truth, Livikus' mission was to determine if Thrull could truly unite all Thar and ally with [[Zhentil Keep]] in an attack on [[Melvaunt]].

==Personality==
Like Livikus, Xeldar truly believed in the possibility that Zhentil Keep would rule all [[north Faerûn]].
