Like her \"siblings,\" Aurelias back was carved with infernal runes.\nLike her \"siblings,\" the purpose of Aurelias existence was a powerful ritual to be performed by Cazador Szarr in the . As a result, the vampire spawns were to be destroyed, and their power would transform Cazador into a vampire ascendant.
