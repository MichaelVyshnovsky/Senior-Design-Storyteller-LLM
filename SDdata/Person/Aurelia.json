        "mainbody": "'''Aurelia''' was a [[vampire spawn]] and one of the favorite \"children\" of the [[vampire lord]] [[Cazador Szarr]], who resided in the [[Szarr Palace]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''\"Die\" in the ritual? Whatsoever are you speaking of? We are going to cheat undeath.''|Aurelia}}",
        "Description": "Aurelia was a female [[tiefling]] with crimson skin and black straight horns. Her eyes glowed with the typical sinister red color of a vampire's gaze. Like her \"siblings,\" Aurelia's back was carved with infernal runes.",
        "History": "Like her \"siblings,\" the purpose of Aurelia's existence was a powerful ritual to be performed by Cazador Szarr in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. As a result, the vampire spawns were to be destroyed, and their power would transform Cazador into a [[vampire ascendant]]. Aurelia believed that that ritual would instead let all of Cazador's \"children\" cheat death. Under her master's orders, Aurelia, alongside [[Violet (vampire spawn)|Violet]], [[Yousen]], and [[Leon Onufrio]] attempted to retrieve [[Astarion Ancun√≠n]], after he and the [[Absolute Adversaries]] reached the city of Baldur's Gate. All of Cazador's spawn were needed for the ritual to succeed; however, it was unknown if the ''[[Black Mass]]'' was successful and if Aurelia was destroyed, or if the ''Black Mass'' never was completed, leaving Aurelia freed from her dark master, or if she was slain in the process by the Absolute Adversaries and Astarion."
