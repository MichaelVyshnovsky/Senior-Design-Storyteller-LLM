The '''Founder''', also known as the '''Red Woman''', was a [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
She was the lover of the [[Chosen]] of [[Myrkul]], [[Akachi]]. However, she was [[Faithless]] and one day she died as a result of an accidental [[spell]] backfire and was condemned to the [[Wall of the Faithless]]. Akachi was distraught over her fate and went so far as to turn against his faith and god and led a crusade to save her. In the end, Akachi was captured and punished by Myrkul but not before he saved the Founder from the Wall.

Thus, it was now the Founder who needed a plan to save her lover from the wrath of Myrkul. She founded the [[Academy of Shapers and Binders]] in [[Thaymount]], hence her title. The Founder created [[Nefris]], [[Lienna]], and [[Safiya]] from fragments of her own soul in order to attract the [[Kalach-Cha]] to [[Rashemen]] in order to save Akachi. However, she also permitted Akachi's brother [[Araman]] to enter the academy, unaware that he was under a ''[[geas]]'' by Myrkul to destroy her.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Araman led a coup in the academy and captured the Founder but, before he could kill her, the Kalach-Cha arrived and saved her. The Founder admitted to being guilty of all the crimes she had committed against the Kalach-Cha and presented him with a fully restored ''[[Silver Sword of Gith]]'', stating that the only way the Kalach-Cha could restore themself, and Akachi, was to enter the [[Betrayer's Gate]] and launch a third crusade to assault the Wall of the Faithless. The Kalach-Cha could have chosen to spare the Founder's life or kill her.
