'''Mhoss''', also known as the '''True Soul 26''', was an agent and a [[True Soul]] member of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Agent Mhoss was an envoy tasked with recruiting [[orc]]s of the [[Trielta Hills]] into [[the Absolute]]'s fold. True Soul 26 was sent to the [[Ringfork Stronghold]] with an offer for Lord [[Heradd]]. However, the orcish guards of the fortress deemed the cultist envoy's presence as evidence of weakness and dismembered Mhoss. The envoy's death caused the cultists to re-think their strategy of co-opting orcs into their army.
