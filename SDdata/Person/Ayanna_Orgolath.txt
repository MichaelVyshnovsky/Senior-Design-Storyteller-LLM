'''Ayanna Orgolath''' was a [[human]] lover of the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]] whose affections would eventually birth the [[Orgolath Dynasty]] of [[Nentyarch]] rulers in [[Narfell]].

==Relationships==
In {{Yearlink|-666}}, Ayanna gave birth to twin boys who were the [[half-fiend]] offspring of Graz'zt. The brothers, named [[Ulthas Orgolath|Ulthas]] and [[Ulthar Orgolath|Ulthar]], were nicknamed "the Darkwing" and "the Darkhorn" respectively because of their demonic heritage. The twins would slay Nentyarch [[Belevan Crell|Belevan the Unliving]] of the [[Crell Dynasty]] in {{Yearlink|-633}}, thus beginning the Orgolath Dynasty which would last for nearly 500 years.
