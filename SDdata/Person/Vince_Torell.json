        "mainbody": "'''Vince Torell''' was a convicted criminal from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Vince Torell was accused of being a spy for [[the Absolute]]. He was arrested, tried, and condemned to public execution of treason. As the Absolutist army marched on Baldur's Gate and unbeknownst to all, the new Grand Duke [[Lord Gortash]] being one of the Absolute's leaders, Vince Torell, alongside a fellow prisoner [[Durm Goroy]], was to be transferred from the [[Stonyeyes Precinct]] of the [[Flaming Fist]] to the [[Basilisk Gate]] prison on the orders from Manip [[Farthingale]]. Basilisk Gate had a handy plaza with a hanging stage set up for public executions at the time."
