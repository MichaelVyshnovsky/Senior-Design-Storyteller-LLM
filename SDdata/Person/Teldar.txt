Teldar was an old pirate in 1359 DR.
Teldar was a pirate officer under Laershala, the last pirate lord of Earthspur. He was the de facto leader of the pirates thank to his old age and his record of successful raids. Many believed he did not rule openly so as not to attract unnecessary attention. Teldar always gave wise advise to new pirates. He was renowned for his supply of magical items that saved him many times over the years, like when he used his necklace of missiles to end the career of Cheves the Scourge.
In 1363 DR, Vurgrom managed to defeat Teldar, becoming the new pirate lord. Teldar exiled himself to Thesk.
Teldar had little leadership ability.
