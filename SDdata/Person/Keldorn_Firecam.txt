'''Sir Keldorn Firecam''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Torm]] and a respected senior member of the [[Order of the Radiant Heart]] living in the city of [[Athkatla]] in the nation of [[Amn]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''"Torm the True, the Brave, fill your servant with courage enough to banish darkness, and see evil wherever it may lie"''|Keldorn}}

==Personality==
The elder knight was wise and measured in his actions. He often sought the council of those he trusted before making significant decisions in his life.

Keldorn held the duties to his order and Torm above all else. He could not abide individuals he saw as inherently evil, such as [[drow]] and [[vampire]]s.

==Relationships==
{{quote|''My old friend Keldorn told me that the righteous must end their rage when the battle is done.''|[[Minsc]]}}<br/>
Keldorn was married to a noblewoman of Athkatla [[Maria Firecam|Lady Maria]], and the couple had two daughters, [[Leona Firecam|Leona]] and [[Vesper Firecam|Vesper]]. They lived in an [[Firecam estate|estate]] within the city along with their housmaid [[Peony]].

While he was dedicated to his knightly duties, Keldorn was often absent from his family even as he neared retirement. This led to at least some estrangement between the paladin and his family, particularly his wife Maria. The loneliness created by constant separation with her husband caused Lady Firecam to seek comfort and companionship with a fellow knight named [[William of Thorpe|William]].

Keldorn acted as a mentor to the young knight [[Ajantis Ilvastarr]].

==Possessions==
Keldorn's armament included ''[[Hallowed Redeemer]]'', a ''+2 [[greatsword]]'' and a custom set of [[Firecam full-plate armor|full plate mail]].

==History==
Some time during his career in the order, Keldorn and his fellow paladins were betrayed by one of their own, [[Taerga|Sir Taerga]]. The group was ambushed by [[Rath|Grinning Rath]] and his [[ogre]]s. The paladins were forced to partake in a horrific ritual that involved being bound to one of their dead companions before being left to the elements. Keldorn managed to free himself from his binds and free several of his comrades, including [[Cassius (knight)|Sir Cassius]]. Keldorn then stalked Rath back to his camp and slew him along with all his allies.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Keldorn was sent by his order to investigate the [[Cult of the Eyeless]] within the city. He was found by [[Gorion's Ward]] and their party fighting some [[undead]] in [[Athkatla/Sewers|the sewers]] under the city's [[Athkatla/Temple District|Temple District]].
