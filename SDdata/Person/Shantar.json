Using invisibility magic, Shantar his hippogriff mount monitored the activities of the phaerimm and their army of bugbears, mind flayers and other horrific beasts.\nAs battle broke out at the edge of the moor between the monstrous army and elven warriors from Evermeet send to aid Evereska. Shantar led the scouts on an aerial support mission, transporting Naneatha Suaril and her Sel√ªnite clerics atop their flying mounts to support the elves rear guard.
