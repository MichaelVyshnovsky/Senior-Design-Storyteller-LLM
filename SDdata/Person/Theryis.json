She returned a few years later alongside her brother, both of them now Harper agents. Theryis re-purposed her old business as a tavern, to serve as an undercover base for the Harpers operating in the city. \n\nAs of [[1479 DR]], Theryis was one of the only two official Harper agents operating in Neverwinter. The other one was her brother.\n\nIn 1479 DR, Theryis may have aided of group of [[adventurer]]s who were searching for information about the \"[[Seldra Tylmarande|Lost Heir]]\" of [[Alagondar]]."
