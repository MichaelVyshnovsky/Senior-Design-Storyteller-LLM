He was spared when he agreed to give up his name and work as an assassin for other Houses. He worked very well, killing drow renegades and enemies of the drow and becoming a very efficient killing machine.\nIn 1367 DR, Mourn was tasked with the mission to kill Karsellyn Lylyl-Lytherraias in order to stop her proposal of a drow participation in the Retreat. He arrived on the isle unknown to everyone and was waiting for the right time for action."
