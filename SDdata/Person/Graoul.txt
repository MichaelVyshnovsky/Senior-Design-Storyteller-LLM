'''Graoul''' was a [[dragonborn]] elder of the [[Inquest]] and one of the rulers of [[Xorvintroth]] on [[Abeir]]. Graoul and their colleagues enjoyed a second life as their [[brain in a jar|brains were preserved in jars]] following their deaths. Like the others, Graoul's consciousness remained as a spectral echo in the [[Astral Plane]],{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|14-15}} even after their brain was consumed by a [[gnome ceremorph]] whose ship crashed upon [[Toril]].{{Cite adventurers league/Volatile Thoughts|12}}

{{Quote|That brain was delicious! Such complex flavors and a decidedly mature vintage.|[[Dredavex Sinfiz]], upon consuming the brain of long-preserved brain of Graoul.}}

==Description==
Graoul's [[jar|brain jar]] was set in a green metal casing wrought to resemble a [[dragon]]'s claw.

In the Astral Plane, Graoul's spectral echo wore [[robe]]s adorned with astronomical imagery and arcane characters. Like the other elders, Graoul wore a metallic necklace with a medallion featuring crown of green crystals. Hovering atop their heads were those actual crowns, each of which granted a form of non-detection that hid them from roaming [[astral dreadnought]]s.

==History==
Along with their fellow elders, Graoul's consciousness was transferred to a [[brain in a jar]] after their death. While studying the forces of the [[Far Realm]], the elders' minds somehow became trapped in the Astral Plane. Some time after becoming stranded, they arranged for their physical remains and still-living brains to be transported to a different location in Xorvintroth. 

While Graoul and the elders were in the Astral Plane, the mysterious [[Emissary of the Nine Eyes]] shared with them a 'viridian planet', a possible new home for them to live free from the constant war on Abeir.{{Cite adventurers league/Volatile Thoughts|12}} Unfortunately, their work would never be completed. 

In the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, a two gnome ceremorphs piloting the ''[[Id Ascendant]]'' through [[Realmspace]] crashed in the wastes of [[Icewind Dale]]. While searching for [[psi crystals]] to repower their ship, they stumbled upon the ruins of Xorvintroth―which had remained on Toril after the [[Second Sundering]]―and recovered Graoul's brain jar. They proceeded to split Graoul's brain in half and enthusiastically consume all of his remains. Interestingly enough, his spectral echo remained in the Astral Plane.
