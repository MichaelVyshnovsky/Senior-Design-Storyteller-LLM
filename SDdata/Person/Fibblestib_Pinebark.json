        "mainbody": "'''Fibblestib Pinebark''' was a [[rock gnome]] from [[Gnomengarde]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was one of the tiny kingdom's foremost inventors along with [[Dabbledob Plasterpatch]].",
        "Personality": "Fibblestib preferred solutions to problems which addressed root causes rather than symptoms. His ideas for inventions could be rather unrealistic.",
        "Abilities": "In addition to his innate [[gnome|gnomish]] abilities, Fibblestib (like everyone else in Gnomengarde) had some training as a [[wizard]]. In combat, he preferred to attack with [[spells]] like ''[[ray of frost]]'' and ''[[magic missile]]''.\n\nFibblestib was also skilled at creating [[magic]] items.",
        "Relationships": "Fibblestib was a close collaborator with Dabbledob. The two could argue about their very different ideas about how to solve problems, but they worked closely together in their workshop at Gnomengarde to create magic items and inventions, many of which served no real purpose.\n\nAs the most respected inventors in Gnomengarde, Fibblestib and Dabbledob were seen as reliable and trusted pillars of the community. In turn, both inventors were highly devoted to their kings, [[Gnerkli]] and [[Korboz]], but could be somewhat indifferent toward the well-being of other members of the kingdom.",
        "History": "When Gnomengarde's King Korboz went mad in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Fibblestib and Dabbledob made curing him their sole focus, even as the [[mimic]] responsible for his condition rampaged through the tiny kingdom. However, the two inventors quickly reached an impasse as Fibblestib argued that the pair should invent a  ''[[sanity ray]]'', Dabbledob dismissed it as \"stupid\" and instead argued in favor of inventing a ''[[straitjacket]]''.\n\nNot long after this incident, the town of [[Leilon]] asked Gnomengarde for aid, specifically for any magical items or weapons that could fend off a suspected attack by the [[green dragon]] [[Claugiyliamatar]]. In response, the two gnomish inventors created the ''[[Gnomengarde grenade]]'', a weapon suffused with [[wild magic]], and personally attempted to deliver it to Leilon's agents at a meeting point in [[Dumathoin's Gultch]]. Because of the item's instability, it was transported in two parts: Fibblestib carried the weapon itself while Dabbledob carried a magical key which was used to arm the device. However, the [[necromancer]] [[Ularan Mortus]] sent [[undead]] to waylay the pair, who survived thanks to their escort, [[Bindlemint Mincemower]], fleeing to find the [[adventurer]]s from Leilon."
