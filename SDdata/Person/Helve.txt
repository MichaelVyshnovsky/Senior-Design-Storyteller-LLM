'''Helve''' was a brigand operating in [[Tsarn Tombs]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Helve was either superstitious or caved when startled.

==History==
When [[Sharantyr]] followed the tracks of [[Shandril Shessair]] through the [[Tombgate]] into [[Tsarn Tombs]], she came across some brigands. One of them attacked her with a sword, which was prevented from killing her thanks to an ''[[ironguard]]'' spell; believing her to be a ghost, the man ran, which Shandril responded to by caving in his skull with a [[stonemaiden]]. A fellow brigand chastised the dead man, identifying him as "Helve".
