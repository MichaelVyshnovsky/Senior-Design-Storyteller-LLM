Kinyel Druugiir was a drow assassin of House Druugiir in Menzoberranzan in Mantol-Derith in the late 15 century DR.
Kinyel was an assassin but she was exiled after failing to kill a house rival. She then traveled to Mantol-Derith.
There, circa 1486 DR, a gargoyle who was smitten by her had given her a madness-causing gem containing the demon lord Fraz-Urbluu. Affected by the madness, Kinyel decided she must kill the Zhentarim beholder Lorthuun.
Kinyel infiltrated the staff of Sirak Mazelor when the drow representative went to met the Zhentarim delegate Ghazrim DuLoc, waiting for the right occasion to strike, but was stopped by some adventurers.
Kinyel believed in her madness that killing the beholder would gain her the pardon of her house.
