'''Kinyel Druu'giir''' was a [[drow]] [[assassin]] of [[House Druu'giir]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] in [[Mantol-Derith]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Kinyel was an assassin but she was exiled after failing to kill a house rival. She then traveled to [[Mantol-Derith]].

There, ''circa'' [[1486 DR]], a [[gargoyle]] who was smitten by her had given her a madness-causing [[gem]] containing the [[demon lord]] [[Fraz-Urb'luu]]. Affected by the madness, Kinyel decided she must kill the [[Zhentarim]] [[beholder]] [[Lorthuun]].

Kinyel infiltrated the staff of [[Sirak Mazelor]] when the drow representative went to met the [[Zhentarim]] delegate [[Ghazrim DuLoc]], waiting for the right occasion to strike, but was stopped by some [[adventurer]]s.

==Personality==
Kinyel believed in her madness that killing the beholder would gain her the pardon of her house.
