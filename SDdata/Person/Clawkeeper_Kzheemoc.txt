'''Clawkeeper Kzheemoc''' was a beastmaster of the [[Batiri]] [[Shattered Spear tribe]] in [[Chult]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

==Description==
Kzheemoc was a larger and stronger specimen who towered over fellow Batiri [[goblin]]s. His position as a Clawkeeper made Kzheemoc one of the seniors of the tribe.

==Possessions==
Kzheemoc was armed with a [[longbow]] and carried a quiver of mundane [[arrow]]s. [[Akkarrak]], a powerful [[deinonychus]], loyally accompanied its master until both of their deaths at the hands of merchant [[Sa'Sani]]'s hirelings.

==History==
In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, the Shattered Spear tribe discovered the shipwreck of the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' on [[Omgar's Teeth]]. The vessel belonged to Sa'Sani of [[Samargol]] and her trade company. The Batiri attacked surviving sailors and passengers, including the infamous writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. Some of the survivors ended up captured by the goblins along with some of the ship's precious cargo. At the same time, another group of survivors was confronted by [[Ghzermag]], Clawkeeper Kzheemoc, and [[Shoudul of the Skulls]]. Volo tried to persuade charming locals to let the survivors go, but Volo was not as fluent in the [[Goblin language]] as he claimed to be. In the ensuing fight, Clawkeeper Kzheemoc, Akkarrak, and their kin were slain.
