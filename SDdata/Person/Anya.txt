Anya was a fighter who died during a fight with the minions of Xanathar circa 1358 DR.
She did not like the grimy area below the city of Waterdeep but was willing to join the party commissioned to deal with its evils to avenge the deaths of her former companions. Anya was incredibly stupid but very tough.
Anya and her companions set out to fight Xanathars minions below Waterdeep. She may have been resurrected.
