'''Chandri''' was a [[Church of Selûne|Selûnite]] priestess and the chief healer of [[Moonshadow Hall]] in [[Yhaunn]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Chandri organized the infirmary of the temple and provided healing for those who required it, using mundane healing supplies, alchemical [[potion]]s, and [[divine]] healing [[magic]]. Unknown to Chandri, Velsinore sourced many of her medications from the [[Sharran]] priest and alchemist [[Bolan]].

==History==
By [[1373 DR]], Chandri served under High Moonmistress [[Dhauna Myritar]] and, in [[Eleasis]] of that year, she served under Moonmistress-Designate [[Feena Archwood]] during her brief tenure at the temple. When Dhauna forced Feena to infect her with [[lycanthropy]], Chandri healed Dhauna's wounds and attempted to administer [[belladonna]] to counteract the curse. Dhauna refused to take the treatment and used lunar magic to forcibly transform into a [[werewolf]], so Chandri and the others locked their former leader in a secure cell, though not before the werewolf destroyed much of the infirmary.

In the investigation that followed, Chandri assisted Velsinore in examining the records in the archives that Dhauna had accessed. Following Feena's uncovering of Velsinore as a heretic before the temple, Velsinore inflicted a deadly wound on [[Mifano]] as a distraction, and Chandri saved his life with her healing magic.
