'''Yonks''' was a roaming adventure who traveled the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''I wish I could have spent more time perusing the shops - but alas, it is time to move on. Such is the life of a daring adventurer!''|Yonks}}

==Description==
Yonks was a diminutive, older gnomish male with pale skin and blue eyes. He wore padded clothing with leather pauldrons and gloves.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Yonks was a member of an adventuring band that included [[high elf]] [[Sarafin]], [[half-orc]] [[Zog]], [[tiefling]] [[Quinara]]. The group traveled the Sword Coast in search of steady adventuring work. They traveled from [[Waterdeep]] to [[Baldur's Gate]] during [[the Absolute]] crisis and, unable to find work, planned to move out to [[Neverwinter]] as the city was searching for adventures. During his stay in Baldur's Gate, Yonks frequented [[The Velveteen Elixir]] shop, stocking up on [[potion]]s.
