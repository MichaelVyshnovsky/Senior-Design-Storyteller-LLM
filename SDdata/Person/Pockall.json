        "History": "Pockall invented four spells during their life. The first three spells involved invisibility, and they were: ''[[improved invisibility]]'', which came in {{YearlinkConvert|2381|NY}}, ''[[invisibility]]'', which came in {{YearlinkConvert|2385|NY}}, and ''[[invisibility, 10' radius]]'', which was invented in {{YearlinkConvert|2388|NY}}. Pockall's final spell was rather different from their previous ones. This spell, ''[[charm monster]]'', was developed in {{YearlinkConvert|2392|NY}}."
