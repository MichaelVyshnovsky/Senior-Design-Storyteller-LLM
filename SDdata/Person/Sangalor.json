        "mainbody": "Sangalor, also known as Sangalor of the Secrets, was a mind flayer outcast who became a cleric of Oghma in 1370 DR.\nIn time, Sangalor became a fervent devotee of the God of Knowledge but was basically still an illithid his usual trade was to find secrets by request or interrogating evil prisoners by eating their brains. He never consumed minds of non-evil creatures. Sangalor revealed secrets about his home city to anyone who was seriously intending to fight his evil brethren.\nFor a humble sum of 5,000 gp, Sangalor offered tutelage in a technique that strengthened ones mind. This training was invaluable for the adventurers that planned on facing mind flayers and similar psychic beings.\nSangalor collected magic items and scrolls and sometimes sold them to adventurers.\nSangalor was considered an embarrassment by the rest of his kind. Most mind flayer wished he was killed when Sangalor was spawned. Even mention of Sangalors name was offensive to his kin.\nSangalor originated from the illithid city of ChChitl but at some point, for unknown reasons, it became an outcast. To survive, Sangalor turned to the worship of Oghma and moved first to Skullport and later to Waterdeep and the Temple of Oghma there.\nAfter Sangalors settlement in Waterdeep, the sage mind flayer struck an agreement with the Lords of Waterdeep the lords allowed Sangalor to practice his trade in exchange for him keeping an eye on the mind flayer activities in Underdark and Undermountain.\nIn 1370 DR, Sangalors attention was drawn to a lone heros descent to Undermountain on orders of Khelben Arunsun to investigate and stop recent influx of kobold activities within Waterdeep. The mind flayer offered the hero invaluable information to aid in their quest."
