I feed my hunger with commerce and discovery. One profits better and learns more when one is trustworthy, so that is a virtue for which I strive. I hope that your strive for this as well. May you stay clear of the path of madness.''|Sangalor}}",
        "Activities": "In time, Sangalor became a fervent devotee of the God of Knowledge but was basically still an illithid: his usual trade was to find secrets by request or interrogating evil prisoners by eating their brains. He never consumed minds of non-evil creatures. Sangalor revealed secrets about his home city to anyone who was seriously intending to fight his evil brethren.\n\nFor a humble sum of 5,000 [[gp]], Sangalor offered tutelage in a technique that strengthened one's mind. This training was invaluable for the adventurers that planned on facing mind flayers and similar psychic beings.\n\nSangalor collected magic items and [[scroll]]s and sometimes sold them to [[adventurer]]s.",
        "Relationships": "Sangalor was considered an embarrassment by the rest of his kind. Most mind flayer wished he was killed when Sangalor was spawned. Even mention of Sangalor's name was offensive to his kin.",
        "History": "Sangalor originated from the illithid city of [[Ch'Chitl]] but at some point, for unknown reasons, it became an outcast. To survive, Sangalor turned to the worship of Oghma and moved first to [[Skullport]] and later to [[Waterdeep]] and the [[Font of Knowledge|Temple of Oghma]] there.\n\nAfter Sangalor's settlement in Waterdeep, the sage mind flayer struck an agreement with the [[Lords of Waterdeep]]: the lords allowed Sangalor to practice his trade in exchange for him keeping an eye on the mind flayer activities in Underdark and Undermountain.\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], Sangalor's attention was drawn to a lone hero's descent to Undermountain on orders of [[Khelben Arunsun]] to investigate and stop recent influx of [[kobold]] activities within Waterdeep. The mind flayer offered the hero invaluable information to aid in their quest."
