In an argument between the humans and an elven hunter by the name of Thatoryl Elian, Andar slew the elf. In retribution, a group of elven warriors, led by Thatoryls betrothed,  Lorelei Alavara, attacked their camp and killed everyone there, save Andar, who had been answering natures call at the time."
