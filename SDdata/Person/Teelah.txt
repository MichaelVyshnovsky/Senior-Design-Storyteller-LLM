'''Teelah''' was a dancer at the [[Moonstone Mask]].

==Biography==
She had aspirations to study dance at the conservatory in [[Waterdeep]], but lacked the money to pay for it. Until then, she worked for [[Ophala Cheldarstorn]]. If the [[Kalach-Cha]] came with [[Elanee]], Teelah and Elanne would make some agressive comments. The Kalach-Cha could've stood with Elanee to gain influence with her.
