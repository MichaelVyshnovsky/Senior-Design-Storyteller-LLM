Cailan was a mercenary who lived in the Realms during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He wore a suite of plate mail armor while wielding a small shield and long sword.
Cailan joined an company led by the elf known as Vail. Together they and their three other companions, raided Ramaziths tower in Baldurs Gate in search of the Helm of Balduran. Unfortunately, Cailan and his comrades were petrified by the gaze of a basilisk, a fact of which he seemed aware before his transformation.
The stone statues that once were men were sold to the noble art collector Felonius Gist, displayed proudly within his estate in the city.
