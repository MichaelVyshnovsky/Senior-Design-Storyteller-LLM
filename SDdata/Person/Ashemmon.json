        "History": "Ashemmon became Blackstaff in [[Ches]] of [[1424 DR]], after the death of [[Krehlan Arunsun]]. According to [[Sarathus Hothemer]] in his treatise ''[[Blackstaves: Their History]]'' ([[1459 DR|Year of the Forged Sigil, 1459 DR]]), Ashemmon outshone all Blackstaffs except Khelben in matters of statecraft.\n\nIn his life, Ashemmon mentored [[Samark Dhanzscul]], who became the sixth Blackstaff.\n\nAshemmon died in the [[1464 DR]] and was succeeded by Samark. Ashemmon's spirit-template went on to reside within [[Blackstaff Tower]] along with the spirit-templates of the other former Blackstaffs."
