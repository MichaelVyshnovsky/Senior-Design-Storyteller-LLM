'''Balarystul''' was a spy of [[Bahamut]] who posed as a [[Calishite]] barber named '''Burney''' inside the [[Wandering Emporium]], which traveled across the plains of [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Burney provided all the services of a professional barber, including healing injuries. While performing her work she would tell all kinds of stories, but always ones that provided a moral lesson. This was only a cover for her true work: spying on [[Tiamat]] on the direct orders of Bahamut, who hoped to stop the Dragon Queen from rising once more.

==Personality==
On the surface, Burney was cheerful but remained keenly observant, looking for any news about the followers of Tiamat, especially [[Arkhan|Arkhan the Cruel]].

==Powers==
Balarystul had received a particular blessing from Bahamut: any creature less powerful than a [[deity]] that spoke with her quickly forgot about their conversation, as she was under the permanent effect of a [[spell]] of ''[[mind blank]]''. Furthermore, she could instantly ''[[teleport]]'' herself into the Wandering Emporium or directly to the court of Bahamut.
