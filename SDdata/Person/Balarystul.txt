Balarystul was a spy of Bahamut who posed as a Calishite barber named Burney inside the Wandering Emporium, which traveled across the plains of Avernus in the Nine Hells in the late 15 century DR.
Burney provided all the services of a professional barber, including healing injuries. While performing her work she would tell all kinds of stories, but always ones that provided a moral lesson. This was only a cover for her true work spying on Tiamat on the direct orders of Bahamut, who hoped to stop the Dragon Queen from rising once more.
On the surface, Burney was cheerful but remained keenly observant, looking for any news about the followers of Tiamat, especially Arkhan the Cruel.
Balarystul had received a particular blessing from Bahamut any creature less powerful than a deity that spoke with her quickly forgot about their conversation, as she was under the permanent effect of a spell of mind blank. Furthermore, she could instantly teleport herself into the Wandering Emporium or directly to the court of Bahamut.
