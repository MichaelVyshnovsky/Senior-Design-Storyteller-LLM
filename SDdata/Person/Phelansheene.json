Once in Amphail she was engaged in a battle with a Red Wizard of Thay. The Red Wizard ended up trapped in a crystal ball hidden in the village and Phelansheene was cursed to manifest in Faer√ªn only on nights of a full moon and only in Amphail, because her spellbook remained there.\nShe was in love with Thorn Tlassalune."
