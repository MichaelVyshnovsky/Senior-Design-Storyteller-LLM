'''Mijel Morigan''' was a distinguished [[mage]] and retired adventurer who lived in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], with his wife [[Jandra Morigan|Jandra]] and daughter [[Jelima Morigan|Jelima]]. Within the city's [[Swordspoint]] neighborhood, Mijel and Jandra ran the [[Kettle of Many Things]] restaurant, a delightful establishment that specifically catered to [[wizard]]s and their [[familiar]]s.

He was known for brewing an excellent [[mead]].

==History==
For some time, Mijel focused on selling [[arcane]] components from a small shop he established in the north end of the Kettle, [[Morigan's Complete Components]]. However, competition from [[Bendekar's Mercantile]] forced him to refocus his efforts, and instead sell [[spices]] to local cooks and housekeepers.
