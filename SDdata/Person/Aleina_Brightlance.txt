'''Aleina Brightlance''' was a knight-commander of [[Silverymoon]]'s [[Knights in Silver]] in the late 15th century.

==Relationships==
She established a sexual relationship with [[Wulfgar]]

==History==
In [[1484 DR]], during a new assault by [[orc]]s and [[drow]] on the [[Silver Marches]], Aleina commanded a knight contingent sent to help King [[Firehelm]] in the defense of [[Sundabar]]. She was captured in the fall of the city and brought to [[Underdark]] by a drow party. She was saved by [[Regis]] and [[Wulfgar]] of the [[Companions of the Hall]] along with many other prisoners. Afterward, Aleina helped them in fighting orcs and drow and partnered with Wulfgar.

In [[1485 DR]], having received reinforcement, Aleina commanded a battalion of Knights in Silver in the decisive battles of the war.
