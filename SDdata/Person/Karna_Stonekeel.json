The shipwright had a famously long backlog.\nIn , Captain Thoster retained her services to repair the Green Siren after returning from Xxiphu with the ship.\nThough after Thosters return from Xxiphu, Karna Stonekeel told him that the amount hed paid for repairs would do for the lumber and canvas, Thoster later related to Anusha that hed paid the shipwright a kings ransom."
