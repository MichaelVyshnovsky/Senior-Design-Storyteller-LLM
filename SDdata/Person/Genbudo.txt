'''Genbudo''' was one of the most powerful [[wu jen]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Genbudo was a very troubling wu jen residing in [[Chimotoge]]. Many nobles and [[samurai]] sought his talents from his house near the city. However, he received all visitors concealed by a screen, so nobody had seen his face since he arrived in Chimotoge around [[1293 DR]]. 

==Rumors & Legends==
Rumors said that Genbudo was in truth the infamous [[Goboro|Goboro the Lame]], who disappeared during the 12th century [[DR]] in a magic duel.
