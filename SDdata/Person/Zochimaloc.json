        "mainbody": "Zochimaloc was the ruler of Tulom-Itzi in 1361 DR.\nHe was very wise and knew much concerning the coming of the Golden Legion in Maztica, but was very enigmatic in speaking about it.\nHe ordered the kidnapping of Gultec, a young Jaguar Knight from Payit, and transported him to his city. There, Zochimaloc tutored Gultec, who, thanks to this training, learned to use all of his hidden powers. Just before the Night of Wailing, he encouraged Gultec to go to Nexal.\nZochimaloc died destroying the Dariens army of giant ants."
