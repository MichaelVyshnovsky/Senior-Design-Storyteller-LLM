        "mainbody": "rother Luiman was a hermit monk of Order of the Yielding Way, who established a sanctuary within the caves of the Snowflake Mountains between Amn and Tethyr during the 12 century DR. \nAs a devout follower of Eldath, and a disciple of the Yielding Way, Brother Luiman spent his youth traveling the countryside, sharing his knowledge and wisdom for the sake of peace and calm prosperity.\nOne day, while in the city of Saradush, the young monk provoked the anger of some miscreants who were intimidating the local townsfolk. The conflict rapidly escalated into violence. When all was said and done, several of the thugs, along with some innocent bystanders, lay on the ground dead or dying. Aghast with his actions, Brother Luiman fled the city and went into hiding within the caves of the Snowflakes.\nWracked with guilt and remorse over his actions, and the fact his pride got the better of him, Luiman settled into the caves and began to pray to the Green Goddess. For quite some time his prayers were met with silence. Luiman remained patient, remorseful for his actions, and eventually he received a vision of his goddess. Eldath showed him a paladin of Tyr by the name of Glorilis Instala, and directed Luiman to seek her out, for the holy warrior was in need of refuge. Brother Luiman understood he was to return the Tyrran to the same caves in which he found peace after chaos.\nThe monk set out on his quest, and after some searching found Glorilis, drinking her troubles away on some docks within a city in Tethyr. Although, she initially refused the monks directions, after some persuasion they returned together to the sanctuary under the mountains. They spoke together for five tendays. Luiman came to learn that Glorilis had fallen from grace with her god and her order and understood his mission to assist those from other faiths to find spiritual healing and guide themselves to a better path.\nBrother Luiman counseled the fallen champion and guided her to complete several tasks to atone for her past. Upon returning to the caves after the last deed of penance, Luiman asked Glorilis if her more recent actions had taken the burden or her crimes off her conscious. The paladin felt absolution and Brother Luiman saw the path laid out before him.\nThe monk within the caves sought further visions from Eldath to seek more fallen souls to aid. In each instance, Brother Luiman guided them to the caves, helped direct them towards actions of redemption and atonement and returned for his counsel."
