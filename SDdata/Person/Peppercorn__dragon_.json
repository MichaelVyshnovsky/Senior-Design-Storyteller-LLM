        "mainbody": "'''Peppercorn''' was a [[faerie dragon]] who inhabited the [[For-Rest Inn]] in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "As was typical of her species, Peppercorn had a very mischievous personality, though she never pulled malicious pranks.{{Cite polyhedron/49/The Living City: The For-Rest Inn|28, 30}} She also possessed a genius level intellect.",
        "Abilities": "In addition to having the standard faerie dragon abilities of turning [[invisibility|invisible]] and exhaling a [[dragon breath|breath]] of euphoric gas, peppercorn was capable of casting a variety of [[wizard]] [[spell]]s.{{Cite polyhedron/49/The Living City: The For-Rest Inn|30}}",
        "History": "Some time in the 14{{th}} century DR, Peppercorn came to the city of Ravens Bluff as she was convinced it would offer her a lot of opportunities to play pranks upon [[human]]s. While there she came across the For-Rest Inn and decided to loiter there for a long period of time.",
        "Activities": "Peppercorn spent most of her time in the For-Rest Inn sleeping or lounging in its rafters {{SI|6|ft}} above the bar, causing mischief to the patrons below through use of her powers. She also tended to sleep within the branches of the inn. While performing her pranks she remained invisible, preferring not to be seen. She made sure never to be malicious with her pranks, as she knew doing so would truly incur the wrath of the inn's owner [[Thistledew Vine]]. When not performing pranks she dined within the garden of the inn.",
        "Relationships": "The For-Rest Inn's bouncer, [[Peter Trumm]], was not fond of Peppercorn's persistent mischief and made many attempts to catch or expel her to no avail. Peppercorn in turn was rather fond of provoking Peter, especially using her powers of ''phantasmal force'' and ''ventriloquism'' to play \"99 [[Baku]] of [[Beer]] on the Wall.\"\n\nPeppercorn was also good friends with [[Rouge]], the [[pseudodragon]] [[familiar]] of the wizard [[Marian Wicksal]], having had many adventures with him.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/52/The Living City: The Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility|23}}"
