        "mainbody": "Peppercorn was a faerie dragon who inhabited the For-Rest Inn in the city of Ravens Bluff in the 14 century DR.\nAs was typical of her species, Peppercorn had a very mischievous personality, though she never pulled malicious pranks. She also possessed a genius level intellect.\nIn addition to having the standard faerie dragon abilities of turning invisible and exhaling a breath of euphoric gas, peppercorn was capable of casting a variety of wizard spells. \nSome time in the 14 century DR, Peppercorn came to the city of Ravens Bluff as she was convinced it would offer her a lot of opportunities to play pranks upon humans. While there she came across the For-Rest Inn and decided to loiter there for a long period of time.\nPeppercorn spent most of her time in the For-Rest Inn sleeping or lounging in its rafters  above the bar, causing mischief to the patrons below through use of her powers. She also tended to sleep within the branches of the inn. While performing her pranks she remained invisible, preferring not to be seen. She made sure never to be malicious with her pranks, as she knew doing so would truly incur the wrath of the inns owner Thistledew Vine. When not performing pranks she dined within the garden of the inn.\nThe For-Rest Inns bouncer, Peter Trumm, was not fond of Peppercorns persistent mischief and made many attempts to catch or expel her to no avail. Peppercorn in turn was rather fond of provoking Peter, especially using her powers of phantasmal force and ventriloquism to play \"99 Baku of Beer on the Wall.\"\nPeppercorn was also good friends with Rouge, the pseudodragon familiar of the wizard Marian Wicksal, having had many adventures with him."
