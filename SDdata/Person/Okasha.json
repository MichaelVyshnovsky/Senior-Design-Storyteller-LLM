        "History": "Okasha was a sea captain merchant from [[Wa]]. He had dealings with [[T'u Lung]] agents. In 1357 DR, his ship was damaged in a storm near the [[Prioto islands]] and he temporary stopped at Akari for repairs. However, the [[Shou]] governor [[Ko Lei Kho]] sold him [[iron]] [[bolt (fastener)|bolts]] and fasteners for repairs at a very high price.",
        "Personality": "Okasha despised Governor Ko, considering him a tyrannical little tin demigod who thought only of profit."
