Tibeem was a member of the Cult of the Dragon in Phlan in 1489 DR.
The Cult of the Dragon agent was tight-lipped and never revealed information about the organization.
The cultist liked to drink at the Laughing Goblin Inn with his friends Spernik and Ellison Berenger. Spernik and Tibeem pretended to be scribes to find information for the Cult.
Tibeem and his fellow Spernik infiltrated Mantors Library in Phlan in order to steal some books containing draconic lore and deliver it to the red dragon Scorlworyx. However, one day they were discovered and while Spernik managed to escape Tibeem was locked in combat with a summoned Knight of the Black Fist. He managed to kill the knight but was soon captured. Tibeem was brutally interrogated and died of his injuries.
