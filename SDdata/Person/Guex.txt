'''Guex''' was one of the [[tiefling]]s from [[Elturel]] that were exiled from their home following [[the Descent]] into the [[Nine Hells]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Guex had little skill in combat or warfare. He did not know how to properly balance himself, was not fluid in his movement, and apparently had trouble hitting a stationary target made of wood and straw.

==History==
After the tieflings of Elturel were banished in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a group of them accompanied the exiled [[Hellrider]] [[Zevlor]] west along the [[Risen Road]] towards [[Baldur's Gate]]. They were repeatedly attacked by [[goblin]] followers of [[the Absolute]] and were forced to take refuge at the [[Emerald Grove]], home to a group of [[druid]]s of the [[Emerald Enclave]]. In the attack, Guex witnessed a [[worg]] ripping a head of a young tiefling boy. He was unable to help, frozen in fear.

To ensure their safety, [[Asharak]] worked with local adventuring hero [[Wyll]], the Blade of Frontiers, to help train some tiefling children, along with some less–than–capable adults, in how to defend themselves in battle. Guex was among the latter group. While he spent much of his time training, he just could not get the hang of fighting with a [[sword]] without some intervention by an insightful adventurer or seasoned warrior.
