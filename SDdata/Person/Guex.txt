Guex was one of the tieflings from Elturel that were exiled from their home following the Descent into the Nine Hells during the late 15 century DR.
Guex had little skill in combat or warfare. He did not know how to properly balance himself, was not fluid in his movement, and apparently had trouble hitting a stationary target made of wood and straw.
After the tieflings of Elturel were banished in the , a group of them accompanied the exiled Hellrider Zevlor west along the Risen Road towards Baldurs Gate. They were repeatedly attacked by goblin followers of the Absolute and were forced to take refuge at the Emerald Grove, home to a group of druids of the Emerald Enclave. In the attack, Guex witnessed a worg ripping a head of a young tiefling boy. He was unable to help, frozen in fear.
To ensure their safety, Asharak worked with local adventuring hero Wyll, the Blade of Frontiers, to help train some tiefling children, along with some less–than–capable adults, in how to defend themselves in battle. Guex was among the latter group. While he spent much of his time training, he just could not get the hang of fighting with a sword without some intervention by an insightful adventurer or seasoned warrior.
