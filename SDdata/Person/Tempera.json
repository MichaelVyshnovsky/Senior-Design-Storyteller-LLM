The bandits especially piqued her interest, as they were very skilled at making counterfeit gold coins. She transformed Doubloon into a flying city, and from then on created quasimagical implements to help the bandits. However, other archwizards were not happy with the fake coins entering their own cities, and Tempera became very unpopular.\nTemperas rogue city would float above the land for many centuries. A great archwizard, Ioulaum, grew tired of Temperas antics and sent out search parties to track her down. However, Tempera managed to avoid each of these. After Ioulaums efforts failed, Karsus himself attempted to trap Tempera and her city in . However, Tempera seemed to escape yet again, as Doubloon disappeared into thin air. The truth of how Tempera and her city disappeared remained unknown.\nMany believed that Karsus banished her city into a fiendish demiplane, though others thought she made the city entirely invisible. Some even claimed that Shadow had managed to discover the demiplane she was banished to.\nThe Tempera Channel may have been named after her."
