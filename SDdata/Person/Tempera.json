        "Description": "The [[arcanist]] was the ruler of [[Doubloon]], a floating city.",
        "History": "In {{YearlinkConvert|2214|NY}}, Tempera became interested in the ground-based bandit city, Doubloon. The bandits especially piqued her interest, as they were very skilled at making counterfeit [[gold]] coins. She transformed Doubloon into a flying city, and from then on created quasimagical implements to help the bandits. However, other archwizards were not happy with the fake coins entering their own cities, and Tempera became very unpopular.\n\nTempera's rogue city would float above the land for many centuries. A great archwizard, [[Ioulaum]], grew tired of Tempera's antics and sent out search parties to track her down. However, Tempera managed to avoid each of these. After Ioulaum's efforts failed, [[Karsus]] himself attempted to trap Tempera and her city in {{YearlinkConvert|3417|NY}}. However, Tempera seemed to escape yet again, as Doubloon disappeared into thin air. The truth of how Tempera and her city disappeared remained unknown.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Many believed that Karsus banished her city into a [[fiend]]ish [[demiplane]], though others thought she made the city entirely invisible. Some even claimed that [[Telamont Tanthul|Shadow]] had managed to discover the demiplane she was banished to.\n\nThe [[Tempera Channel]] may have been named after her."
