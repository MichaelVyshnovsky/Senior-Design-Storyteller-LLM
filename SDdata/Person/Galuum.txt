Galuum () was a mind flayer in the Northdark during the late 1480s DR.
Galuum lived in Ryxyg. It was sent by the elder brain to collect slaves near the Waydown. Towards the end of the 1480s DR, it captured and enslaved some duergar coming from Zortagra. However, they proved to be uncontrollable thanks to the influence of a demonic madness.
