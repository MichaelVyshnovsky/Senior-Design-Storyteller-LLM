        "mainbody": "Mintiper Moonsilver was a bard and adventurer of the North, as well as a member of the Harpers, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. His works were collected in Silverymoon and compiled into Mintipers Chapbook. \nMintiper stood tall at ,Yet another difference on page 48 of Dragon #187 lists him as being 182 pounds. His eyes were blue, and often belied his mood, darkening when the Lonely Harpist grew angry or growing bright when excited. He carried with him spare boots, and nondescript clothing in earthy tones.\nAfter Moonlights Triumph, Mintiper became increasingly embittered at the losses he suffered of people he cared about.\nLater losing all fear of death after Nouras passing, Mintiper had a well-earned reputation for acts of bravery. He was reportedly seen playing his harp in the midst of banshees, completely unperturbed by the danger they posed. He in fact had no fear of death and could sometimes be found casually strolling through dungeons.\nMintiper owned a set of leather armor, but typically did not wear it, instead preferring to rely on his magical bracers of defense for protection. He wielded a silver-bladed +2 bastard sword, alongside a pair of longswords and two throwing knives that he hid in his boots. He wore a greenstone amulet beneath his cloak of elvenkind, though these were not his only magical items. He also had in his possession a decanter of endless water, several healing potions, and five scrolls containing the spells contingency, remove curse, stone to flesh, teleport, and wall of stone. Despite this, the instruments he carried, those being a reed-flute, a lute, and a handharp, carried no dweomers upon them. He often had a variety of coinage and gems on his person, with the former tucked into in a belt pouch and a money belt, while the latter were hidden in the hollow heels of his boots. It was also rumored that he wielded The Gray Book of Mysteries, a spellbook of no small amount of power, but had hidden it someplace, as opposed to carrying it on his person.\nFew humans, elves, or half-elves would attack Mintiper, either out of respect or for fear of his prowess and rumors of as-yet-unseen magic at his disposal. Mintiper was a Harper and enjoyed a sterling reputation in that organization.\nHe was a close friend and sometimes lover of Asilther Graelor and held a great amount of respect for his musical mentor Flamatanda, claiming she could \"make a harp sing\".\nThought to have been born circa 1320 DR, Mintipers childhood was a mystery to all. Mirt claimed that his father was a Waterdhavian while his mother (Mintiper himself said her name was Maralen) was a moon elf from Ardeep Forest, though Mirt accepted that his claim could be wildly erroneous. Mintipers sometime use of the surname Silverhand could also link him to the family of Dornal Silverhand, father of the Seven Sisters. Either way, he was out on his own, living solely on his skills, at a very young age.\nAs a mercenary, he raided the ghoul-hold of Hellgate Keep and was the only one to return alive.\nMintiper had been a member of several groups beforehand, but he first came to prominence at the head of his Moonlight Men in the . Over the course of two years, they proved to be an incredibly capable band of mercenaries, mostly protecting caravans in the Silver Marches, but also gaining renown after looting the treasures of Luskan. Unfortunately, in the Battle of Turnstone Pass, all but Mintiper and five others of that group were slain at Turnstone Pass after defeating an orc force at least 4000-strong there that threatened Everlund.\nImmediately afterward, Mintiper ventured south into the High Forest, parting ways with his fellow survivors (although two died atop Turlangtor before they reached the forest boundary\nAfter laying Alynirias body to rest in a secret grave, an embittered Mintiper headed to the Sword Coast, where he began a career as a thief. He excelled at this role and gained a reputation for daring. He slew the mage Iniarv the Manyhanded in his tower and stole his collection of two-hundred emerald lions. Mintiper briefly joined forces with the evil Morlaug before assassins working for Calimshans satraps (many of whom he had robbed) forced him to flee for Skaug in a Calishite ship stolen from Port Kir.\nAt Skaug, Mintiper joined the crew of the notorious pirate Kesmer Redeyed, known as the \"Coast Wolf\", until a storm dashed their ship. Mintiper escaped, allegedly by using a magical green gem given to him by his mother. The sole pirate survivor of the wreck however, described a conflagration that consumed the remains of the ship and its crew, leaving no trace of Mintiper.\nArriving in the Purple Hills in Tethyr, Mintiper set up in Myratma, acting as a guide to adventurers in the ruins of the First Kingdom but quickly grew bored, deciding to head back toward the High Forest. where he commonly wrote about himself using the pseudonym Lunargent. Visiting bards were drawn to him, among them, Flamatanda Snowbow who made him her apprentice and introduced him to the Harpers, of which she was a veteran member. Around five seasons later, Noura went insane and died a slow death despite Mintipers best efforts to cure her.\nMintiper became a wandering bard with a reputation for fearlessness and went on many more adventures as of 1367 DR, including destroying the Ghost of Beruns Hill."
