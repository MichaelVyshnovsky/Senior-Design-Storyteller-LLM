        "mainbody": "'''Mintiper Moonsilver''' was a [[bard]] and [[adventurer]] of the [[North]], as well as a member of the [[Harpers]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. His works were collected in [[Silverymoon]] and compiled into ''[[Mintiper's Chapbook]]''.<ref>{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}} \n{{Quote|By night dark dreams bring me much pain—but always comes, after, bright morning again.|Mintiper Moonsilver, ''[[Nine Stars Around a Silver Moon]]'', {{Yearlink|1336}}}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "Mintiper stood tall at {{SI|6'2\"|ft-in|long=yes}},Yet another difference on page 48 of [[Dragon magazine 187|''Dragon'' #187]] lists him as being 182 pounds. His eyes were blue, and often belied his mood, darkening when the Lonely Harpist grew angry or growing bright when excited. He carried with him spare boots, and nondescript clothing in earthy tones.",
        "Personality": "After Moonlight's Triumph, Mintiper became increasingly embittered at the losses he suffered of people he cared about.\n\nLater losing all fear of death after Noura's passing, Mintiper had a well-earned reputation for acts of bravery. He was reportedly seen playing his harp in the midst of [[banshee]]s, completely unperturbed by the danger they posed. He in fact had no fear of death and could sometimes be found casually strolling through dungeons.",
        "Possessions": "Mintiper owned a set of [[leather armor]], but typically did not wear it, instead preferring to rely on his magical ''[[bracers of defense]]'' for protection. He wielded a [[silver]]-bladed ''+2 [[bastard sword]]'', alongside a pair of [[longswords]] and two [[throwing knives]] that he hid in his [[boot]]s. He wore a ''[[greenstone amulet]]'' beneath his ''[[cloak of elvenkind]]'', though these were not his only [[magic]]al items. He also had in his possession a ''[[decanter of endless water]]'', several ''[[healing potion]]s'', and five [[scrolls]] containing the spells ''[[contingency]]'', ''[[remove curse]]'', ''[[stone to flesh]]'', ''[[teleport]]'', and ''[[wall of stone]]''. Despite this, the instruments he carried, those being a reed-[[flute]], a [[lute]], and a hand[[harp]], carried no dweomers upon them. He often had a variety of [[coin]]age and [[gem]]s on his person, with the former tucked into in a belt pouch and a money belt, while the latter were hidden in the hollow heels of his boots. It was also rumored that he wielded ''[[The Gray Book of Mysteries]]'', a spellbook of no small amount of power, but had hidden it someplace, as opposed to carrying it on his person.",
        "Relationships": "Few [[human]]s, [[elves]], or [[half-elves]] would attack Mintiper, either out of respect or for fear of his prowess and rumors of as-yet-unseen magic at his disposal. Mintiper was a Harper and enjoyed a sterling reputation in that organization.\n\nHe was a close friend and sometimes lover of [[Asilther Graelor]] and held a great amount of respect for his musical mentor Flamatanda, claiming she could \"make a harp sing\".",
        "History": "Thought to have been born ''circa'' [[1320 DR]], Mintiper's childhood was a mystery to all. [[Mirt]] claimed that his father was a [[Waterdhavian]] while his mother (Mintiper himself said her name was [[Maralen]]) was a [[moon elf]] from [[Ardeep Forest]], though Mirt accepted that his claim could be wildly erroneous. Mintiper's sometime use of the surname Silverhand could also link him to the family of [[Dornal Silverhand]], father of the [[Seven Sisters]]. Either way, he was out on his own, living solely on his skills, at a very young age.\n\nAs a mercenary, he raided the ghoul-hold of [[Hellgate Keep]] and was the only one to return alive.\n\nMintiper had been a member of several groups beforehand, but he first came to prominence at the head of his [[Moonlight Men]] in the {{yearlinkName|1341}}. Over the course of two years, they proved to be an incredibly capable band of mercenaries, mostly protecting caravans in the [[Silver Marches]],<ref> but also gaining renown after looting the treasures of [[Luskan]]. Unfortunately, in the [[Battle of Turnstone Pass]], all but Mintiper and five others of that group were slain at [[Turnstone Pass]] after defeating an [[orc]] force at least 4000-strong there that threatened [[Everlund]].\n\nImmediately afterward, Mintiper ventured south into the [[High Forest]], parting ways with his fellow survivors (although two died atop [[Turlangtor]] before they reached the forest boundary\n\nAfter laying Alyniria's body to rest in a secret grave, an embittered Mintiper headed to the [[Sword Coast]], where he began a career as a thief. He excelled at this role and gained a reputation for daring. He slew the mage [[Iniarv the Manyhanded]] in his tower and stole his collection of two-hundred [[emerald]] [[lion]]s. Mintiper briefly joined forces with the evil [[Morlaug]] before assassins working for [[Calimshan]]'s satraps (many of whom he had robbed) forced him to flee for [[Skaug]] in a Calishite ship stolen from [[Port Kir]].\n\nAt Skaug, Mintiper joined the crew of the notorious pirate [[Kesmer Redeyed]], known as the \"Coast Wolf\", until a storm dashed their ship. Mintiper escaped, allegedly by using a magical green [[gem]] given to him by his mother. The sole pirate survivor of the wreck however, described a conflagration that consumed the remains of the ship and its crew, leaving no trace of Mintiper.\n\nArriving in the [[Purple Hills]] in [[Tethyr]], Mintiper set up in [[Myratma]], acting as a guide to adventurers in the ruins of the First Kingdom but quickly grew bored, deciding to head back toward the High Forest. where he commonly wrote about himself using the pseudonym '''Lunargent'''. Visiting bards were drawn to him, among them, [[Flamatanda Snowbow]] who made him her apprentice and introduced him to the [[Harpers]], of which she was a veteran member. Around five seasons later, Noura went insane and died a slow death despite Mintiper's best efforts to cure her.\n\nMintiper became a wandering bard with a reputation for fearlessness and went on many more adventures as of [[1367 DR]], including destroying the [[Ghost]] of [[Berun's Hill]]."
