Markoth Hasselpond, usually known as Fat Mar, was a waiter in Phlan during the Tyranny of Dragons.
The waiter was a rotund man who sweated profusely and spoke breathlessly.
Markoth had a sharp tongue and a foul mouth. He disliked his nickname but not the fact that everyone knew him. He was the principal fount of gossip inside the city, and usually took a liking to strangers who inquired about his real name.
While the Laughing Goblin was owned by the dwarf Durnam Goblinkicker, Markoth worked under Imizael.
Markoth worked at the Laughing Goblin Inn in Phlan, helping the tavern owner Imizael. In 3 Marpenoth 1489 DR, he became involved in the Cult of the Dragons coup in the city, as the tavern became the headquarters of the forces fighting against the cultists. Tragically, Fat Mar was slain by an ettin under the command of Farvnik the Venomous when Vorgansharax attacked the city.
