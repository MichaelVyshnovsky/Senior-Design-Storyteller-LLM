Vhaerikho Lhlandast was a bootmaker from the town of Hultail in Cormyr, active in the late 15 century DR.
Vhaerikho was a dandy halfling who possessed the skill to make deadly-accurate imitations of other prestigious shoemakers work, aided by a group of gnomes from his workshop.
By the late 15 century DR, Vhaerikho Lhlandast had fled his home in Saerloon, a city in Sembia, accompanied by his gnomish crew. They allegedly fled from a scandal or some other trouble, but none were willing to discuss their mysterious past. Together, they settled in Hultail, producing footwear that rivaled the most exquisite shoe shops in the cities of Faer√ªn. They could produce and weather a new boot over a tenday such that it perfectly paired the surviving boot.
