'''Vhaerikho Lhlandast''' was a [[boot]]maker from the town of [[Hultail]] in [[Cormyr]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Vhaerikho was a dandy [[halfling]] who possessed the skill to make deadly-accurate imitations of other prestigious shoemakers' work, aided by a group of [[gnome]]s from his workshop.

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Vhaerikho Lhlandast had fled his home in [[Saerloon]], a city in [[Sembia]], accompanied by his gnomish crew. They allegedly fled from a scandal or some other trouble, but none were willing to discuss their mysterious past. Together, they settled in Hultail, producing footwear that rivaled the most exquisite shoe shops in the cities of [[Faer√ªn]]. They could produce and weather a new boot over a tenday such that it perfectly paired the surviving boot.
