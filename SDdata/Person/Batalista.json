        "mainbody": "'''Batalista''' was a grand ''[[mage]]'' and the creator of the enchanted [[ring]] known as ''[[Batalista's Passport]]''.",
        "History": "Not much was known about Batalista despite his title and arcane prowess. His main achievement was the creation of ''Batalista's Passport'', a powerful version of a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]'' he planned to use in his travels across the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. In creating the ring, Batalista summoned a [[salamander]] on numerous occasions to tap into its knowledge of [[elemental magic|fire magic]]. Eventually, the elemental creature lost all patience with the wizard and managed to incinerate Batalista's tower with him inside. After the flames died off, ''Batalista's Passport'' was found on a ripped-off finger, untouched by the flames. The ring's creation was completed and Batalista would've likely survived the inferno if his ring finger was still attached to his hand."
