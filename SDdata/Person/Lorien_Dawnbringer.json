She was a very good friend of [[Ilira Nathalan]] and the two were rumored to be lovers although it's doubtful they had a physical relationship because Ilira's [[spellscar]] prevented her from touching another person.  Lorien spent time skulking around [[Downshadow]], healing adventurers who had taken on more than they could handle.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]] in an attempt to gain a measure of revenge on Ilira, [[Beshaba|Beshaba's]] high [[priest]], [[Lilten]], had Lorien killed by one of his minions, the [[dwarf]] [[Rath]].",
