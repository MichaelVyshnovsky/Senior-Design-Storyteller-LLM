Thentias () was a merchant, landlord, and investor in the Eastern Heartlands in the mid-14 century DR.
In his later years, Thentias had a white beard and a distinctly patrician aspect.
Thentias was tolerant and courteous with all people, and took care to learn and understand the customs of those he dealt with.
Thentias had a great reputation as a fair and ethical trader built up over many years of work. Thanks to his courtesy and fair dealings, Thentias built up a network of fellow merchants that wished to trade only with him when given the chance. He also earned the fierce loyalty of his servants, who would never betray their good master without the compulsion of enchantment magic. Prime among them was his bodyguard, Rhair Felsonn.
In the prime of his career around 1357 DR, Thentias owned large amounts of real estate in Cormyr and Sembia, particularly Suzail and Yhaunn. and enough passive investments as a landlord that he could retire and live prosperously should he have desired.
He owned the Wailing Wheel, an inn of Suzail that was quiet, cheap, and unpopular. It was always cold and dirty with subpar food and almost no service, but it did have a draw for those who dealt in properties. Its staff could put one in contact with Ramkzorn Sharlin or Alasgar Thurym, agents who represented Thentias interests in Suzail.
Established as a wide-ranging and well-respected caravan merchant in Sembia, Cormyr, and the Dalelands, Thentias started buying up many buildings in Suzail and Yhaunn to no apparent end. He aimed to buy up houses and control of entire blocks of land (failing that, connected strips) in high-value areas of the two cities. He continued to rove about leading caravans across the Eastern Heartlands throughout this, regardless of his growing wealth in real estate.
