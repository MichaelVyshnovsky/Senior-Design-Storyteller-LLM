        "mainbody": "undkrist Tolstone was a retired gnome adventurer that lived in Secomber circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR. He gained local renown for his skill at patching, painting, and plastering homes, as well as doing interior design.\nFormerly a member of the Masters of Monsters adventuring band, Rundkrist retired to Secomber after many of his group were slain. One of their expeditions brought them face to face with the occupant of Relurauns Tomb in Ardeep Forest in the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR. Reportedly, they witnessed Reluraun (ineffectually) thrust a sword through a baelnorn that was admonishing them to leave the insane elven warriors spirit alone.\nHe was said to have gained many riches during his adventuring days, but he was not conspicuous in his consumption nor ostentatious in his lifestyle, so, if true, he kept his wealth well hidden."
