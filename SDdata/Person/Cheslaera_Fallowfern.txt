'''Cheslaera Fallowfern''' was the leader of the [[Flaming Sword Riders]], an [[adventuring company]] that operated in [[Luruar]] and [[the North]] during the 1370s [[DR]].

==Description==
Cheslaera was kindly described as "plain".

==Personality==
She was somewhat of a misfit in her wealthy merchant family that resided in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep]]. They had aspirations of becoming nobles and Cheslaera grew bored of the posturing and pretensions the rest of her family performed every day. She also had no desire to be married off as part of the social climbing. She had an independent spirit and wanted to get out of the city and see the world.

==Possessions==
During her adventuring days, she acquired an [[Sentient item|intelligent sword]] that, according to [[Elminster]], had beaten many men in a contest of wills, but she triumphed where they had failed and dominated the sword with her strong personality.

==Activities==
As the leader of the Flaming Sword Riders, she fought [[orc]]s and other monsters across the North, explored ruins, and found a [[dragon]] hoard. With her hard-won wealth and experience, she invested in businesses located in [[Everlund]], [[Neverwinter]], [[Secomber]], [[Silverymoon]], and Waterdeep and became a lady of some influence.

==Relationships==
It was said that she had romantic entanglements in each of the cities where she invested.

==History==
Around {{YearlinkName|1370}}, give or take a year, Cheslaera was a restless daughter in a "[[Realmspeak#Idioms|swirlcloak]]" merchant family, so when the opportunity to perform the [[Rite of the Stag Lass]] came along she grabbed it with gusto, strolling through the streets of [[Amphail]] wearing nothing but a mask with antlers and dancing merrily at the [[Stag-Horned Flagon]] all night long. In the morning, she and six of her fellow revelers formed the Flaming Sword Riders, set off for Silverymoon to acquire a charter from High Lady [[Alustriel Silverhand|Alustriel]], and began their adventuring career. Success and wealth came fairly quickly and Cheslaera became a businesswoman of some importance in the North.

==Rumors & Legends==
Speculation about her future plans included establishing a fortified trading post to barter with the [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s and the [[dwarven]] and [[gnomish]] miners in the region, or to take service with the defenders of the newly formed nation of Luruar.
