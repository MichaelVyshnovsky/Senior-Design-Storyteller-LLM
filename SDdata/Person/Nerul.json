        "mainbody": "'''Nerul''' was the Second Mate aboard the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].",
        "Description": "Nerul was an older [[human]] male who eagerly served Captain [[Lastri Kassireh]].",
        "History": "In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, Captain Lastri Kassireh and the ''Vigilant'' sailed from the [[Sword Coast]] to the nation of [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. Onboard the ship were several passengers, including [[Volothamp Geddarm]] who traveled to meet with a wealthy [[yuan-ti]] merchant, [[Sa'Sani]]. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences: food supplies were mysteriously spoiled; freshwater barrels ruptured; one of the crew, [[Kellen (sailor)|Kellen]], got drunk and drowned; Volo almost got poisoned; and new ropes became frayedâ€”in reality, sabotage.\n\nWhile most of the crew's lives ended in a deadly storm, Nerul survived. The ''Vigilant's'' shipwreck was washed ashore not far from the city of [[Samargol]], and Nerul was captured by a cannibalistic [[Batiri]] tribe under Chieftain [[Taelunangul]]'s rule."
