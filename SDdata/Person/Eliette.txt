'''Eliette''' was a [[High elf|high elven]] woman who later became a [[phase spider matriarch]] that dwelled within the [[Whispering Depths]] caverns on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|It is time. I will forever transcend this blasphemous flesh and refashion myself in the Queen's image.|Eliette's journal notes.}}

==Description==
Nothing was known about the elven form of Eliette. After her transcension she became a huge blue spider with red pattern on her back.

==Abilities==
{{Quote|They can sense my devotion. It draws them. I hear them in the shadows, whispers from the dark mother.|Eliette's journal notes.}}

After her transformation, the matriarch learned to channel inner wrath. When she became severely injured, she would attack with greater force but became even more vulnerable to attacks from others.

==Possessions==
At some point in her existence, the matriarch swallowed some [[humanoid]] creature wearing a set of ''[[poisoner's robes]]''.

==Activities==
While in her humanoid form, the matriarch kept a small study and laboratory nestled within a cave in the upper reaches of the Whispering Depths.

==History==
According to Eliette's ''[[Bloody Journal]]'', her past on the surface of [[Faer√ªn]] was filled with regrets. At some point, she fell into the hands of a [[List of drow houses|minor drow house]]. Throughout her captivity, Eliette devoted herself to the spider goddess, [[Lolth]], witnessing visions of the house's demise and the death of their [[matron mother]]. Patiently awaiting the prophesied day, Eliette carefully planned her escape and managed to break free, reinforcing her allegiance to the goddess.

While Eliette was dwelling in the caves of [[Whispering Depths]], she heard whispers from the darkness, which she interpreted as speech from Lolth herself. She believed this was her calling to undergo a transformation. Some time later, she received a pair of ''[[spiderstep boots]]'', a gift from the spiders within the surrounding caves.

The ''[[Tattered Journal]]'' said, that some time later, she found the dead body of a drow [[arachnomancer]]. Being of "organ and bone" Eliette dreamed of taking a form more appeasing to her goddess. She believed that the gifts from Lolth were the signs that the time of her transformation was at hand.

Within the pages of her ''[[Web-Covered Journal]]'' and ''[[Burnt Journal]]'', she conveyed her eagerness about the chance to deepen her connection with the goddess. She decided to go through the ritual called ''[[Transcendence]]''. In her cave study Eliette researched the ways to become a phase spider matriarch and kept most of her journals written in some manner of code, with notations added in [[common]]. She tried using some spells, but they were not enough. She had a ''[[Ritual Diagram]]'' describing the process of transcension. 

{{Quote|Today, I found the house of Lolth, and I shall be its Matriarch.|Eliette's journal notes.}}

During or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the she made her final transition, taking on the form of the massive [[phase spider]]. Over the next while, it appeared as if she began to produce some manner of webbing from her body. She became capable of laying and hatching large clutches of eggs.
