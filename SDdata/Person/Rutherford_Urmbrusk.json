        "mainbody": "'''Rutherford Urmbrusk''' was the heir of House [[Urmbrusk]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1479 DR]].",
        "History": "In [[1476 DR]], Rutherford's father, [[Quarren Urmbrusk]], abandoned his duty in order to adventure in [[Undermountain]], granting the control of the House to his sister [[Lestra Urmbrusk]] and also granting her custody of Rutherford. Secretly, Lestra bribed Quarren's companions in order to make sure that he never came back from the dungeon.\n\nHowever, in [[1479 DR]], a voice like Quarren's started whispering Rutherford's ears. Believing his father to be alive, Rutherford gathered some companions—a [[half-elf]] mercenary, [[Zarr]]; an [[elf]] [[wizard]], [[Aizel Treemaine|Aizel]]; a [[halfling]] rogue, [[Enda Yate|Enda]]; and the [[half-orc]] fighter brothers [[Squam]] and [[Rotwile]]—for a rescue mission. However, Rutherford also disappeared and his uncle hired an adventuring party to find him or his remains.",
