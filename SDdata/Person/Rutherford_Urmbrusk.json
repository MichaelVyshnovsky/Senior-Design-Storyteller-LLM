        "mainbody": "utherford Urmbrusk was the heir of House Urmbrusk in Waterdeep in 1479 DR.\nIn 1476 DR, Rutherfords father, Quarren Urmbrusk, abandoned his duty in order to adventure in Undermountain, granting the control of the House to his sister Lestra Urmbrusk and also granting her custody of Rutherford. Secretly, Lestra bribed Quarrens companions in order to make sure that he never came back from the dungeon.\nHowever, in 1479 DR, a voice like Quarrens started whispering Rutherfords ears. Believing his father to be alive, Rutherford gathered some companions—a half-elf mercenary, Zarr an elf wizard, Aizel a halfling rogue, Enda and the half-orc fighter brothers Squam and Rotwile—for a rescue mission. However, Rutherford also disappeared and his uncle hired an adventuring party to find him or his remains.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryNobles\nCategoryInhabitants of Urmbrusk Villa\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sea Ward of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryMembers of the Urmbrusk family\nktocwyboeoegio42asvbrgzl8baulzp"
