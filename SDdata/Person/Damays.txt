'''Damays''' was a [[tiefling]] from [[Elturel]] who lived on the [[Sword Coast]] for a time during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The tiefling had huge horns sprouting from his forehead, and dark hair. The red skin of his face featured three black stripes across his left eye. Damays fought with a [[longbow]] and [[arrow]]s. He lived in a camp of many tieflings within the [[Emerald Grove]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Damays and all other tieflings within were outcast from the city of Elturel following [[the Descent|its descent]] into the [[Nine Hells]]. The refugees began to followed [[Hellrider]]  [[Zevlor]], who led them west towards the sprawling metropolis of [[Baldur's Gate]]. The group were regularly attacked by goblins and eventually took refuge at the [[Emerald Grove]] along with a community of druids.

Some time later, Damays and his companion [[Nymessa]] went to investigate a booming noise that resounded across the region. During their trip, they encountered the [[githyanki]] named [[Lae'zel]], who had fallen into a goblin trap just outside their camp at the grove.
