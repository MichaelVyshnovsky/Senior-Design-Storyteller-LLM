{{quote|''Hah! If it daren't be a puny [[human]], dressed up as a mighty adventurer, I'd say! Har har! Did yer mama let ye out from under her skirt, little one? Best ye be runnin' back now!''|Mencar Pebblecrusher}}

==Personality==
Mencar would readily ridicule those he thought were not "real" adventurers like he and his band. He was not one to shy away from a fight from anyone he thought slighted him.

==Relationships==
He traveled alongside the [[barbarian]] [[Smaeluv Orcslicer]], the [[thief]] [[Brennan Risling]], as well as [[Sorcerous Amon]] and his [[imp]] [[familiar]] [[Pooky]].

He was at odds with [[Korgan Bloodaxe]], from a past encounter involving a possible "double cross". There was bad blood between the dwarves.

==History==
At some point in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, he and his companions stayed at the [[Den of the Seven Vales]].
