Mencar Pebblecrusher was a particularly nasty dwarven adventurer who operated out of Athkatla during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Mencar would readily ridicule those he thought were not "real" adventurers like he and his band. He was not one to shy away from a fight from anyone he thought slighted him.
He traveled alongside the barbarian Smaeluv Orcslicer, the thief Brennan Risling, as well as Sorcerous Amon and his imp familiar Pooky.
He was at odds with Korgan Bloodaxe, from a past encounter involving a possible "double cross". There was bad blood between the dwarves.
At some point in the , he and his companions stayed at the Den of the Seven Vales.
