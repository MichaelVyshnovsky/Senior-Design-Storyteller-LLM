Felingar was a legendary bandit lord of Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn, long-dead by the 1370s DR.
Notoriously, Felingar stole a chansreena (princess) of Ormpur, together with her dowry, as she journeyed to her wedding to an important archmage of Halruaa.
Felingar was buried in a crypt under the hills around Dungar, said to still hide the stolen dowry by 1373 DR. The family that ruled the town claimed descent from the famous bandit lord.
