'''Felingar''' was a legendary bandit lord of [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]], long-dead by the 1370s [[DR]].

Notoriously, Felingar stole a chansreena (princess) of [[Ormpur]], together with her dowry, as she journeyed to her wedding to an important archmage of [[Halruaa]].

Felingar was buried in a crypt under the hills around [[Dungar]], said to still hide the stolen dowry by [[1373 DR]]. The family that ruled the town claimed descent from the famous bandit lord.
