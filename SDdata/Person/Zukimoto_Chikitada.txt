Zukimoto Chikitada was a samurai in Wa.
Zukimoto was deeply loyal to his master but never admitted it to anyone. He cared a lot about Hiros safety. He always looked as if everything displeased him. At times of laughter, he only showed a less grunting face.
Zukimoto was the right-hand man, aide, and secretary of the lord Hiro Matsu. He also acted as leader of his bodyguards.
Zukimoto went together with his master to Aru.
