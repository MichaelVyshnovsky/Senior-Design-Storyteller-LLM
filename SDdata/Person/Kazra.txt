'''Kazra''' was a prisoner at the [[Fane of the Eye]] under [[Tyar-Besil]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Kazra happened to spy the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]]. Captured by some [[Feathergale Knights]], she was taken to the Fane, where she remained a prisoner of some air cultists and a [[nycaloth]]. Some adventurers infiltrated the Fane, killing the cultist, and freed her.
