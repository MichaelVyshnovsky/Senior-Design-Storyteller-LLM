'''Anival Dyrr''' was a [[drow]] priestess of [[Lolth]] and the [[matron mother]] of [[House Agrach Dyrr]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Anival was the first daughter of matron mother [[Yasraena Dyrr]].

==History==
During the [[Silence of Lolth]], in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, House Agrach Dyrr entered into a secret alliance with the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] and betrayed Menzoberranzan's [[Army of the Black Spider]] to the armies of [[Gracklstugh]] and [[Kaanyr Vhok]].

After the house's betrayal was revealed, the house compound was besieged by [[House Xorlarrin]] and its allies. With the destruction of the house temple by [[Gromph Baenre]], both Yasraena and the [[Dyrr|Lichdrow Dyrr]], the true leader of the house, were definitively annihilated. Anival was the highest-ranking surviving member of her house. She was approached by [[Triel Baenre]], who offered the survival of her house and her appointment as matron mother in exchange for becoming the vassal of [[House Baenre]] for centuries. With no other option, Anival accepted the offer.
