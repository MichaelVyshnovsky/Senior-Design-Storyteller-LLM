'''Flinderspeld''' was a [[deep gnome]] who was forced into slavery by the [[drow]]. 

==History==
Flinderspeld hailed from [[Blingdenstone]].
He eventually came into the possession of [[Q'arlynd Melarn]], who further controlled the gnome with a slave ring. While able to control Flinderspeld's mind and body, Q'arlynd was actually a fairly lenient master who never abused his slave to any serious degree. Eventually, Q'arlynd freed Flinderspeld and the gnome became a gem merchant relocating in [[Silverymoon]].
