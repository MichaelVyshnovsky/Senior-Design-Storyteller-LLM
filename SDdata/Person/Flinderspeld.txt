Flinderspeld was a deep gnome who was forced into slavery by the drow. 
Flinderspeld hailed from Blingdenstone.
He eventually came into the possession of Qarlynd Melarn, who further controlled the gnome with a slave ring. While able to control Flinderspelds mind and body, Qarlynd was actually a fairly lenient master who never abused his slave to any serious degree. Eventually, Qarlynd freed Flinderspeld and the gnome became a gem merchant relocating in Silverymoon.
