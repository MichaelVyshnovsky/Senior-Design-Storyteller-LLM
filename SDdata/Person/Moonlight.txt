'''Moonlight''' was one of three [[ninja]] in the service of [[Daisake Mayazato]] in the town of [[Aru]] in [[Wa]].

==History==
Moonlight trained in the ninja arts in the [[Warazama clan]] together with [[Smoke (ninja)|Smoke]] and [[Snake (ninja)|Snake]], until that clan was destroyed by internal dissent. He and his fellows entered into the service of Daisake Mayazato to repay him for previous services.
