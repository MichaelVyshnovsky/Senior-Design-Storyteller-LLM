        "Description": "Elaith Craulnober was a tall elven noble in his prime with sharp, handsome features and a graceful build. He was {{SI|5'8\"|ft-in|long=yes}} tall.",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|As you will learn, my pride has a very high price indeed.|Elaith Craulnober<ref>}}\nElaith was a tragic character who never truly recovered from his initial fall. His descent from nobility on Evermeet to the brutal and heartless crime lord he became contributed to his contrasting qualities. In Evermeet, Elaith was serious and proper, the \"epitome of elfdom\" according to [[Amnestria]]. After his exile, Elaith became a heartless crime lord with a penchant for cruelty. He was a manipulative and evil elf whose canny intelligence earned him a position among [[Nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdeep's nobility]]. Elaith was a very proud elf, and any slight made to him was answered brutally. Despite his often unforgiving manner, Elaith had a twisted sense of honor, and seemed to fully respect (albeit in a twisted fashion) many elven traditions, including his use of the \"Elf-friend\" custom. However, during the events of 1364 DR, Elaith underwent a drastic change. He became more questioning of his morality, and even began to actively seek redemption—through any means possible. He remained an evil crime lord, but his evil and cruel streaks were markedly reduced.\n\nStyle was important to Elaith. He disdained the methods of the Zhentarim because they had \"no style.\"",
        "History": {
            "Background": "Elaith was the only child of an only son, the last of the Craulnober line in [[Evermeet]]. He served as captain of the king's guard in Evermeet.\n\nIn Waterdeep, Elaith became a rogue elf. He was recruited by a band of mercenaries known as the [[Company of the Claw]]. They were led by [[Xander]] to go treasure hunting (tomb robbing) in [[Erlunn]]. Elaith found the complete break from his former traditions and values liberating.\n\nBecoming obsessed with obtaining a functioning ''moonblade'', Craulnober collected information on various treasure hoards in the region around Waterdeep. In the {{YearlinkName|1344}}, he heard of the drunken ramblings of [[Thalaraz Dlaerve]] who claimed to have come through a ''[[portal]]'' deep inside the [[House of Stone]] and had bags of [[ruby|rubies]] to show for it. Elaith kidnapped the besotted [[warrior]] and used some version of a ''[[mind ream]]'' spell on him to extract all the man knew about the place, then disposed of him.{{Cite dragon/273/The New Adventures of Volo: The House of Stone|76}}\n\nSoon, Elaith began building his own underground empire of crime. He acquired a reputation for ruthlessness as an assassin, intelligence broker, and crime lord. His notoriety was such that there was a well-known ballad written about him called \"[[Silent Strikes the Serpent]].\"",
            "Songs & Swords": "Elaith ran into [[Arilyn Moonblade]] and [[Danilo Thann]] in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, and aided them in their quest to find the [[Harper Assassin]]. However, despite Elaith's fondness for Arilyn, he had his own personal agenda and vendetta—which caused no little difficulty for the pair. In particular, Elaith held no love for Danilo and arranged to have him assassinated, although he later rescinded the job. He aided the two of them in determining that [[Kymil Nimesin]] was behind the Harper Assassin in a plot to usurp the throne of Evermeet.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, Elaith hesitantly joined forces with his hated enemy, Danilo Thann, in order to solve the riddle of the ancient [[green dragon]] [[Grimnoshtadrano]] in order to obtain the [[Morninglark]] [[harp]]. Danilo sought the harp in order stop a sorceress from wreaking havoc, while Elaith sought it to restore his ''moonblade'' for his infant daughter, [[Azariah Craulnober|Azariah]]. With a rag-tag army of [[minstrel]]s, [[mercenaries]], and [[riddlemaster]]s, Elaith and Danilo solved the riddle and regained the artifact. Then Elaith stole the artifact, but after Danilo reminded him of their agreement, he defended Danilo from harm, becoming gravely injured. His selfless sacrifice reactivated the ''moonblade'' and allowed Elaith to be healed.\n\nLater, in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Elaith discovered the magical qualities of the ''[[dream sphere]]s'', a magical device used to create dreamscapes for the upper nobility of Waterdeep. In an attempt to test the \"evil\" of his soul, Elaith took a legendary intelligent ''[[tel'kiira]]'', a magical artifact used to magnify a person's magical capability. Legend said that the ''tel'kiira'' would bend an ordinary person's soul to evil, but if wielded by a truly vile being, the artifact would bow down to his will completely. Temporarily fooled by a false copy of the artifact, Elaith, believing himself beyond redemption, sank down to the evil streak of cruelty and ruthlessness he was previously known for. However, at the end, he once again aided Arilyn and Danilo in destroying the evil ''tel'kiira'' to restore order in Waterdeep."
        },
        "Abilities": "Foremost of Elaith's abilities were his fearsome reputation and his willingness to commit vile, cruel acts. Elaith honed his reputation to a point where he was nigh untouchable in the city of [[Waterdeep]]. After the restoration of his ''moonblade'', however, Elaith preferred to hire mercenaries to perform his illegal activities for him.",
        "Possessions": {
            "Magical Items": "[[File:Elaith craulnober-eladrin.jpg|thumb|250px|''Elaith Craulnober wielding his ''moonblade''.'']]\nElaith possessed a dormant ''[[moonblade]]'', an elven [[artifact]] that rejected him as its owner because of his questionable character and instigating his exile. The ''moonblade'' was reactivated in 1364 DR when Elaith was gravely injured for the sake of the Harper Danilo Thann. His last thoughts were only for his daughter; the ''moonblade'', sensing a change of heart, healed him and restored itself. Elaith held the ''moonblade'' for his daughter, planning to give it to her when she was old enough to inherit it.\n\nElaith owned a magical ''+2 [[dagger]]'' and a mastercraft [[longsword]].",
            "Property": "Elaith owned a house known as the [[Blackstone House]] on the [[Way of the Dragon (Waterdeep)|Way of the Dragon]] in Waterdeep, between the [[South Ward|South]] and [[Dock Ward]]s. It was tall, narrow, and elegant, and built of stark, black [[granite]].\n\nIn 1361 DR, the [[Rearing Hippocampus]] in Waterdeep was purchased by Elaith and renamed the [[Hidden Blade]].\n\nElaith also owned a high-coin gambling house in the [[North Ward]] called [[Tymora's Fancy]], which he had built on the ruins of a tallhouse.{{Cite dragon/335/Game of Chance}}"
        },
        "Relationships": {
            "Amnestria": "Elaith's strongest bond was with the Princess [[Amnestria]] of Evermeet, Arilyn's mother. He was a distant relative of hers and grew up with her. They were later betrothed, but this was nullified after Elaith's ''moonblade'' rejected him and he went into self-imposed exile. Elaith's unresolved feelings for the princess was such that it was one of the few things that could break his iron self-control. In 1368 DR, he was almost killed because of this weakness.",
            "Children": "Elaith had two children, although only one of them was known to him. [[Azariah Craulnober]], for whom he attempted to recover the dormant ''moonblade'', was sent to Evermeet to be fostered in the royal household, to inherit the ''moonblade'' once old enough.\n\nElaith also had a son by Amnestria. However, she gave birth to him in secret after Elaith moved to Waterdeep. The lost prince's story has not yet been told.",
            "Danilo Thann": "Elaith's other closest companion was, ironically, the Harper who was formerly his most hated enemy, [[Danilo Thann]]. Early in their relationship, Elaith tried to have Danilo killed because he detested the human noble. However, after Danilo saved his life in 1364 DR and grew fond of Azariah, Elaith developed a grudging respect for him. Elaith named Danilo an elf-friend in return for the Waterdhavian bard saving his life, though he considered this as an act of supreme folly.<ref>",
            "Arilyn Moonblade": "Elaith viewed the half-elven assassin [[Arilyn Moonblade]] as elven royalty—even saying that she should have been his daughter, because he had been betrothed to Amnestria, Arilyn's mother.\n\nHowever, Elaith professed a seething hatred for Arilyn's human father, the Harper [[Bran Skorlsun]] and a former friend. Whether this hatred stemmed from his human heritage, the human's inability to protect Amnestria, or the fact that she loved the human more than she loved him is not known. Bran was not fond of Elaith, either, blaming him for the deaths of the [[Company of the Claw]]. It was implied that Bran and Elaith had previously adventured together in that band.",
            "Bronwyn Caradoon": "{{Quote|Thanks, but I don't want you to get troubled on my account. No offense, but who will believe that you fought to protect my honor?|Bronwyn gently refusing Elaith's offer to help}}\nElaith briefly spent time with the charming rogue [[Bronwyn Caradoon]], secretly a Harper sagent sent to sabotage one of his plans. He displayed an uncharacteristic attraction for Bronwyn, an attraction that constantly prevented him from killing the sly rogue.",
            "Khelben & Laeral": "{{Quote|Elaith Craulnober, under different circumstances I believe we could have become very good friends.|Laeral in grim agreement with Elaith's twisted justice}}\nHe also had a somewhat awkward \"treaty\" with [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] and Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]], as he had saved the archmage's life from a powerful charmed state in 1364 DR."
