'''The Beastlord Harshom''' was a [[wizard]] from the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in [[Luskan]], allied with the [[Legion of the Chimera]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Yes... they do not call me The Beastlord Harshom for my prowess with women alone, you know...''|Harshom}}

==Description==
Harshom was a [[human]] mage with fair skin tone and gray hair. He wore gray [[robe]]s and was armed with a [[greatsword]].

==Abilities==
Harshom's title came from the use of war-[[bear]]s for his nefarious deeds. His magically-trained beasts were fierce opponents who could dispatch well-armored [[knight]]s with ease. The Beastlord's war-bears wore [[enchanted]] colors that bound the animals to his and his will alone, making them impervious to ''[[charm]]'' [[spell]]s and animal handling skills. At one point, Harshom considered having battle-cats but decided against it as the name was less intimidating than war-bears.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the Host Tower of the Arcane found itself secretly allied with the Legion of the Chimera, a horde of [[monstrous humanoid]]s and half-breeds who treated to wipe the settlements of [[Icewind Dale]] off the [[map]]. One of the Arcane Brotherhood's mages – [[Phaen of the Rags]] was instrumental in the Legion's infiltration of Targos that almost resulted in the town's conquest if not for the intervention of a band of mercenaries from Luskan hired by Targos.

The adventurers embarked on the journey to stop the Legion – the journey that took them across the [[Frozenfar]] and the [[Spine of the World]]. As retaliation, the Host Tower of the Arcane sent The Beastlord Harshom to track the heroes down across the frozen landscape and end their quest. Harshom, his four war-bears, two female wizards, and four [[ranger]]-trackers pursued the group past the [[Ice Lakes]] and the [[Fell Wood]]. By luck, Harshom came across a couple from the [[Wandering Village]] – [[Leevi‎]] and [[Carita‎]], a pair of murders exposed by the adventures who were more than happy to point to where the adventurers were heading. As payment for their help, Harshom fed the couple to his war-bears.

Harshom set an ambush for the adventurers but, presumably, was slain in the battle that followed.
