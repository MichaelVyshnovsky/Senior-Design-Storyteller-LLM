        "mainbody": "The Mistmaster was a very powerful illusionist and cleric of Leira living in the Citadel of the Mists in the High Forest and a senior member of the Moonstars in 1370 DR.\nAlmost nothing was known about the Mistmaster and his dealings with Khelben Arunsun some speculated that it was under Khelbens orders that the Mistmaster destroyed Hellgate Keep with the Gatekeepers Crystal. What was sure was that the Mistmaster oversaw the treant Turlang and reported to Khelben all news about activities in the High Forest and its surroundings.\nIn 1374 DR, he was among the many powerful mages whom Arunsun brought together in order to cleanse part of the High Moor and restore Faertelmiir, a lost city of Miyeritar."
