        "History": "Almost nothing was known about the Mistmaster and his dealings with [[Khelben Arunsun]]; some speculated that it was under Khelben's orders that the Mistmaster destroyed [[Hellgate Keep]] with the ''[[Gatekeeper's Crystal]]''. What was sure was that the Mistmaster oversaw the [[treant]] [[Turlang]] and reported to Khelben all news about activities in the High Forest and its surroundings.\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], he was among the many powerful mages whom Arunsun brought together in order to cleanse part of the [[High Moor]] and restore [[Faer'tel'miir]], a lost city of [[Miyeritar]].<ref>"
