        "mainbody": "'''Fual yn Senaor al Barasth''' was a [[Calishite]] [[sage]] and a member of the [[Knights of the Shield]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Fual was a minor [[druzir]] in the [[Defenders' Drudach]] of [[Memnon]], so his position did not permit him the command of many soldiers, and he let the administrative decisions be made by the [[Alzhedo dictionary#Q|qayadin]]. Fual thus had a lot of free time to cultivate his passion for rare and old armor and weapons. He usually traded these items with his fellow Knights and had a considerable collection. Fual acquired the golden ''[[Lion Blade]]'', one of the two ''[[Royal Masque Blades]]'' of King [[Strohm IV]] of [[Tethyr]] and informed only Lord [[Alaric Hembreon]] and hoped to trade the sword to the Tethyrian Crown in exchange for some [[Shoon Imperium]] weapons."
