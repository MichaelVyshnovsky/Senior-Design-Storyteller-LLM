Ivan Bouldershoulder was a dwarf adventurer of the mid-to-late 14 century DR and brother to Pikel Bouldershoulder.
Ivan had a long yellow beard, square shoulders, and dark eyes. He had a long, wide nose.
Ivan and his brother Pikel were born and raised in Vaasa, in the rugged Galena Mountains. 
In the , Ivan and Pikel fought alongside the elves of Shilmista against invading orcs and goblins.
Later, they resided at Spirit Soaring, a temple to Deneir in the Snowflake Mountains, with Cadderly Bonaduce and his wife Danica.
Ivan and Pikel set out from Carradoon to attend the coronation of King Bruenor Battlehammer in Mithral Hall in the .
In the , Ivans mind was taken over by the dracolich Yharaskrik. Ivan later regained control of his body and escaped into the tunnels of the mountains.
Ivan and Pikel later returned to the Bloodstone Lands together, this time to Helgabal in Damara, where he served as a guard commander and master-at-arms in the Damaran army by 1484 DR, repeatedly proving himself as one of the best warriors in the city, but finding many of his duties increasingly dull and uninteresting, especially considering his quiet disdain for King Yarin Frostmantle.
In the , Ivan found himself caught up in a conspiracy in the Damaran royal court when he was reunited with Regis and Wulfgar, who were both in Helgabal on the orders of the Morada Topolino to save Queen Concettina Delcasio from execution by her cruel husband, who was infertile, but blamed her for his failure to produce an heir to the throne. Convinced that theyd be unable to get her out of the country without provoking a war between Damara and Aglarond, Ivan instead agreed to facilitate Wulfgars access to the queens bedchamber so that she could conceive a child by him, and pass off their child as the kings. Ivan and Pikel were both arrested by Yarins forces for their association with Wulfgar when Yarin found out hed been cuckolded.
After the death of King Yarin, Ivan and Pikel moved back west, to Longsaddle, where Ivan was given the task of guarding the portal from the Ivy Mansion to Gauntlgrym. Once Gauntlgryms portal network was properly secured, Ivan became one of the first three captains of the citys Grymguard, sitting in council with King Bruenors closest advisors.
Ivan wore plate mail in combat, with a metal helm adorned with deer antlers. and a heavy axe across his back. He carried hand axes attached to his belt.
