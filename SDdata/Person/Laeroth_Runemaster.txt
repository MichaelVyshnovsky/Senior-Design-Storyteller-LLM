'''Laeroth Runemaster''' was the leader of the high mages of [[Evermeet]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Personality==
Laeroth was truly very old but like Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] he had decided to remain on [[Toril]] instead of going to [[Arvandor]]. He had inherited most of the wisdom and memories of the previous high mages. Laeroth was always pressured by his responsibilities, always being silent and purposeful with limitless patience and loyalty.

==History== 
During [[Nimesin's War]] in [[1371 DR]], Laeroth was at the [[Tower of the Sun]] leading the defenders of the isle. However, just after he [[teleport]]ed the [[bladesinger]] [[Shanyrria Alenuath]] to the [[Sunrise Tower]], the Tower of Sun was destroyed by a powerful spell from one of the [[Circle Singers]] of [[Kymil Nimesin]].
