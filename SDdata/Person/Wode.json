        "mainbody": "'''Wode the Guileful''' was a [[drow]] merchant who set up a trading camp in the [[Underdark]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Wode sold wares in the area south of a [[House Despana]] camp, near [[Rilauven]]. The drow elf, along with his [[derro]] and [[dwarf|dwarven]] associates, sold a large amount of wares. Their wares included weapons, armor, magically enhanced items, and ammunition.\n\nHe was boastful about his \"glorious\" home city of [[Ched Nasad]]. He referred to it as the \"black opal of drow cities\" and said it \"gleams across the [[Underdark]] as a shining example to all others who hope to be truly great\". The only city he felt was more welcoming to merchants was [[Sshamath]].\n\nWode journeyed close to Rilauven every three years to meet with his associates, [[Myrvek of Gracklstugh|Myrvek]] and [[Heggr Splitsteel|Heggr]]. He mentioned that \"Old Heggr\" disliked dealing with himself and Myrvek.\n\nHis market was decorated with fine [[spider silk]] carpets made by master craftsmen.\n\nWode was the only merchant among his associates who had a bodyguard. His guard, named [[Valas Rrostarr]], was protective and did not like to engage in conversation.\n\nHe used axes in combat, making use of both their melee and throwing potential."
