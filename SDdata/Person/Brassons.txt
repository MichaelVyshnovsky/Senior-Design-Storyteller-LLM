Brassons was a rogue neogi restaurateur and owner of the Oceans Wake bar on Dragon Rock in the Tears of Sel√ªne in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
A former slave trader, he escaped from a mindspider around 1362 DR and became a follower of Torm.
He was a magic-user able to cast spells like a priest. 
He was a good source of information.
Brassons was  tall and very ugly, but exceptionally mild-mannered for a neogi.
