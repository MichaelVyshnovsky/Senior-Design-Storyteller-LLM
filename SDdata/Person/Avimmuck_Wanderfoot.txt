Avimmuck Wanderfoot was the Cloakmaster of the Caravan Sect of the Shadow Thieves around 1370 DR.
Avimmuck owned a house in Riatavin.
Avimmuck was an outgoing and pleasant individual, although he usually looked distracted. Most people believed him to be a scout or a trader but in truth he was a ruthless assassin. Frequently, Avimmuck spied on meetings of his guildmasters in order to be sure they were not double-crossing him.
