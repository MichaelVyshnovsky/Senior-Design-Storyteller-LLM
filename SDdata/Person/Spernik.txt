'''Spernik''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[Phlan]] during the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].

==Personality==
Spernik was constantly nervous, and [[stammer]]ed and sweated when under pressure. But his promotion thrilled him, so Spernik told everyone who would listen that was a top leader in the Cult.

==Possessions==
In battle, Spernik wore [[leather armor]] and fought with a [[dagger]].

==History==
Spernik was a cultist cleric of [[Tiamat]] who had infiltrated Phlan for a long time. He stole a book from [[Mantor's Library]] in order to instigate a [[red dragon]] to attack the city. However, thanks to some adventurers, he was defeated in the end and arrested by the [[Knights of the Black Fist]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|5}}

His trial became a long-running case, a fact that concerned [[Aleyd Burral]]. When his fellow cultists, led by [[Vorgansharax]], launched a coup in the city in [[1489 DR]], Spernik was freed and became one of the top cultist leaders. Eventually, the [[Harpers]], using [[Glevith]] as an intermediary, hired some adventurers in the city to capture or kill him, which they did after a fight.{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|23-24}}
