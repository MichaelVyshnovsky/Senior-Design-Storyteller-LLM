Nan-kuo was a monk member of the Many-Hued Peacock Society in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
Nan-kuo was forced to abandon his monastery in Tu Lung due to war. He started wandering Kara-Tur in search of enlightenment but with no fortune. At last, he arrived in Nakamaru.
After a celebration of the birth of Goshukara Sadamotos third son, Lui-hsia Chih sent Nan-kuo and Yencheng Tzu Yu to read the aura of Yin-kung To.
Nan-kuo tried to teach himself by recreating the particular chains of thought of his ancient masters.
Nan-kuo was a lonely and unhappy man. His travels had greatly changed his mind, giving him wisdom and pain, as he could only see the world from more than point of view.
