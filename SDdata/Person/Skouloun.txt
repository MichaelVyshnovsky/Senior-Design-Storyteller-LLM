'''Skouloun''' was one of the [[Nimbral Lords]] and one of the leading Elders.{{Cite web/Realmslore/The Realm of Nimbral, Part Eight: The Nimbral Lords}}

==Personality==
He was a sharp-witted and sharp-tongued figure.

==Activities==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], in order to gain money for his magical research, Skouloun sold many rival wizards to the [[Shadovar]]..

==History==
Skouloun was [[Planewalker|planewalking]] when the [[Spellplague]] hit in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, and so escaped the disaster.

He started studying a powerful longevity [[spell]] until in the {{YearlinkName|1487}}, when he resurfaced and competed with his fellow Elder [[Yusendre]] and other [[archmage]]s for possession of the [[Lost Spell]], a key element for his own spell, during a [[spellstorm]]. However, he was killed by [[Tabra]] for his dealings with the Shadovar.
