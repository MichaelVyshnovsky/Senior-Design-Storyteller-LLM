'''Samas Kul''' was the [[zulkir]] of [[transmutation]] within the [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]], since his predecessor's death in [[1375 DR]], and master of the nation's [[Guild of Foreign Trade]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Samas was tall and obese, and wore tent-like be-gemmed, costly robes. He spoke with a plummy, unctuous voice.

===Personality===
Cultivating an air of being cultured, the ambitious Samas was known for his particularly cutting sarcasm and cynical manner.

==Possessions==
Samas wore a ''[[ring of protection]]'' which bestowed upon him a protective aura invisible as air but strong as steel. He also had a ''[[Wand of polymorph|wand of polymorphing]]'', cast from [[quicksilver]].

==Relationships==
The corpulent red wizard employed twin [[tiefling]] [[warlock]]s, [[Tolyst]] and [[Finora]], as spies and agents who would intimidate his trade rivals in [[Bezantur]].<ref>{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Warlocks, Part 2}}

==History==
For many years, Samas Kul was a strong and trusted ally of the [[lich]] [[Szass Tam]]. Samas replaced [[Druxus Rhym]] in [[Mirtul]] [[1375 DR]] as zulkir following Rhym's assassination. As Szass Tam tried to seize lone rulership of Thay by force later that year, Samas allied with [[Dmitra Flass|Dmitra Flass']] council to stand against Szass' armies.
