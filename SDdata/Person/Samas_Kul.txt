Samas Kul was the zulkir of transmutation within the Red Wizard of Thay, since his predecessors death in 1375 DR, and master of the nations Guild of Foreign Trade during the 14 century DR.
Samas was tall and obese, and wore tent-like be-gemmed, costly robes. He spoke with a plummy, unctuous voice.
Cultivating an air of being cultured, the ambitious Samas was known for his particularly cutting sarcasm and cynical manner.
Samas wore a ring of protection which bestowed upon him a protective aura invisible as air but strong as steel. He also had a wand of polymorphing, cast from quicksilver.
The corpulent red wizard employed twin tiefling warlocks, Tolyst and Finora, as spies and agents who would intimidate his trade rivals in Bezantur.
For many years, Samas Kul was a strong and trusted ally of the lich Szass Tam. Samas replaced Druxus Rhym in Mirtul 1375 DR as zulkir following Rhyms assassination. As Szass Tam tried to seize lone rulership of Thay by force later that year, Samas allied with Dmitra Flass council to stand against Szass armies.
