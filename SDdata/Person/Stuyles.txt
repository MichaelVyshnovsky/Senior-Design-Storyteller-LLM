'''Stuyles''' was a farmer who owned land near [[Luskan]]. However, he was driven off of his land by the policies of the [[High Captains of Luskan]]. Thus Stuyles and many of his fellows became bandits assaulting the caravans of Luskan.

In [[1463 DR]], their ambush was repelled by [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] and [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. After Drizzt discovered the whole truth of their situation, he was shocked and offered some goods to Stuyles and his fellows.
