Stuyles was a farmer who owned land near Luskan. However, he was driven off of his land by the policies of the High Captains of Luskan. Thus Stuyles and many of his fellows became bandits assaulting the caravans of Luskan.
In 1463 DR, their ambush was repelled by Dahlia Sinfelle and Drizzt DoUrden. After Drizzt discovered the whole truth of their situation, he was shocked and offered some goods to Stuyles and his fellows.
