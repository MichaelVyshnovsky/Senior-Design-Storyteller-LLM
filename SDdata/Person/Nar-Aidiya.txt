'''Nar-Aidiya''', or '''The Bonfire''', was a [[human]] [[Elemental mage|flame mage]] and member of the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]] in [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|31}}

==Description==
Though he kept his true physical appearance hidden from nearly everyone, including members of the Brotherhood, Nar-Aidiya appeared to be a man in his mid-40s with piercing black eyes, shining black hair, and a trimmed goatee. He wore a scintillating scarlet ''[[aba of the elements]]'' paired with a white [[sash]] and white [[turban]]. His turban was pinned in place by a unique magic item called the ''[[Incandescent Eye]]''.{{Cite dragon/268/Secrets of the Brotherhood of the True Flame}}

==Activities==
The Bonfire ruled the Brotherhood of the True Flame with an iron fist. He did not care if he was liked, so long as he was obeyed. Fear and respect were the tools of his trade. Most of his decisions were made from the [[Molten Throne]] in the [[Infernal Hall]] of [[Krak al-Mazhar]], the secret fortress of the Brotherhood located deep within the [[Great Anvil]] of the [[Haunted Lands]]. Nar-Aidiya ordered the destruction of desert oases and the execution of all enemies of the Brotherhood. The fortress was rumored to be protected from [[genie]]s and other [[elemental mage]]s alike.

Nar-Aidiya personally instructed promising young flame mages known as the ''[[shig'harakhi]]''. In order to keep the fortress secure, he had these students brought to him by magic. Upon completion of their training he placed a ''[[geas]]'' upon them, preventing them from revealing secrets about the Brotherhood, and magically transported them back into Zakharan society.

When his duties permitted, Nad-Aidiya enjoyed spending time in the mystical [[Great Garden]].

==Possessions==
The Bonfire had access to a wide variety of [[magic items]], but prized among his possessions was the beautiful but deadly ''[[Incandescent Eye]].
