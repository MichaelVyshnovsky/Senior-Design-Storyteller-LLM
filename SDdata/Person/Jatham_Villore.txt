Jatham Villore was a wheezing weaver in High Dale and secretly a Red Wizard of Thay.
Jatham was a very able weaver in High Dale. When in 1358 DR a secret Zhent occupation army occupied the dale, Jatham was a member of the Council of the High Dale. Constable Heladar Longspear believed him a pest and far wiser than he pretended to be. In truth Jatham, not wanting a dale ruled by the Zhentarim, secretly used his spells to help Elminster and Sharantyr went unnoticed by the Zhent.
