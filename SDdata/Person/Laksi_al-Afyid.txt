Laksi al-Afyid was was a merchant-rogue and business woman in Huzuz.
She possessed a natural talent for catering to the rich and powerful. Clients could relax in her shop in comfort while her servants collected their request from the Bazaar.
Instead of offering guide services like others in Huzuz, Laksi preferred to offer procurement services where clients told her what they needed. She operated her shop, Services for Nobles, out of a lavish house located near the Grand Bazaar and Court District.
