'''Falael''' was a laborer, packer, and a delivery woman of the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette'' in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|I '''was''' counting [[broadsheet]]s for distribution. Let's pray I've not lost count.|Falael}}

==Description==
Falael was a young [[Half-elf|half]] [[wood elven]] woman with a light skin tone, short curly light brown hair, and brown eyes. She often wore a simple laborer's jacket over a [[tunic]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Falael was employed by Baldur's Mouth and could be found outside the [[broadsheet]] publisher's office counting papers packed for delivery. Counting in several hundreds was a challenge, and miscounting meant she had to start over.
