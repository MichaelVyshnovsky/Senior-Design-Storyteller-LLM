'''Count Claylan''' was nobleman of [[Amn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''The man is a swine! Leave me now. I need to arrange to have his wine mixed with the slop water.''|Lady Lasalla}}

==Description==
Claylan was a pale [[human]] man who wore finery of black and green colors.

==History==
Count Claylan was a married man who spent his time seducing naive debutantes at the exclusive [[Mithrest]] inn located in the [[Waukeen's Promenade]]. Lady [[Lasalla]] was one of Claylan's conquests. He grew tired of the woman in a week, leaving her brokenhearted. She later felt annoyed at other debutantes who eagerly accepted the Count's advances. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, [[Alicia Paalater]] found herself being courted by the Count and eagerly reciprocated. The young woman was enamored with the nobleman, praising his bravery after listening to the Count's tales and being impressed by his supposed influence over the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]] and Lord [[Ophal]]. He was planning to petition the Council to prohibit commoners from shopping at the Waukeen's Promenade during the day. Alicia was invited to visit Count Claylan's manor the same evening to view his collection of [[Sunite]] statuary. The nobleman insisted that her parents did not need to be distracted from their daily activities for a visit, especially since Claylan's wife was away from the manor.
