Vurkkazynarr was a blue dragon and scion of Sturykkazynarr during the Solon empire. His helmet was embedded in the Wyrmbane Helm.
He was a scion to Sturykkazynarr.
After his sire, Sturykkazynarr, slew Lord Yseldre, the Lords heir, Tiphera tir-Yseldre went to the lair of Vurkkazynarr, slew his guards, and then the dragon after a furious battle. She then set his skull on an enchanted helm, the Wyrmbane Helm, as a challenge to the wyrm.
