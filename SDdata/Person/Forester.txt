'''Forester''' was a gruff and proud man from [[Shadowdale]]

{{Quote|Enough! Our brothers stand ready to lay down their lives at the eastern border to protect the dale! I say we join them! How many are with me?|Forester, fed up with ditch-digging duty.}}

==Description==
He was [[bear]] of a man with a disposition to match.

==History==
Forester was born in [[Shadowdale]] and spent his entire life living there, coming to know many of his neighbors and fellow Dalesfolk by name.

When the [[Zhentilar]] army occupied [[Daggerdale]] and threatened the rest of the Dales in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Forester was assigned to lead the all-important task of digging out ditches on the western side of the [[Ashaba Bridge]]. He quickly managed to  get into a heated argument with the mortal adventurer [[Cyric]], also assigned to the same work group, debating the merits of their assigned duties.

Cyric convinced Forester to keep true to their duty of helping defend Shadowdale. They helped groups of refugees make it safely across the bridge,

After the Dalesmen's victory at the battle, Forester helped gather the bodies of the dead and identify them for considerations to their families. but remained appalled at Forester's ruthlessness all the same.

Forester would ultimately meet his own end a short time later when assigned for guard duty at the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]]. When Cyric broke into the tower to free his fellow adventurers [[Adon]] and [[Midnight]], who had been wrongly accused of the death of [[Elminster Aumar]]. When the mercurial [[thief]] saw Forester, he used the Dalesman's trust to his advantage and plunged a dagger into his chest without a second thought, one step closer to freeing his former companions.
