He pressed on in spite of the death of his companions, though manifestations of the Spellplague could still test his resolve.\nAs of 1396 DR, Hadyn carried only a simple leather armor and a battered long sword.\nHadyn had once been part of an adventuring party, but they had died during the pilgrimage to Ormpetarr.\nHadyn arrived at Ormpetarr at some point in , after a trip that took the better part of a year, starting from Waterdeep the trip took him across the Greenfields, where most of his party died to gnolls, leaving him the sole survivor. He joined two other spellscar pilgrims, Finara and Raidon Kane, and entered the Plaguewrought Lands. There, trying to stick to the Pilgrims Path, they took a bridge to make their way past the Granite Vortex he was almost thrown off the bridge and finally struck by blue fire. The fire appeared to make him briefly stronger, but he disintegrated within a few seconds."
