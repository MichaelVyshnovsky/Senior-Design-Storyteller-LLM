        "mainbody": "enauril was an outcast wizard from Halruaa who was active circa the mid-to-late 12 century DR. He was notable for creating the creatures known as dark trees.\nBenaurils research involved necromancy and a variety of other, similarly distasteful forms of magic.\nFrom within the Aerilpar Forest, Benauril spent a great deal of time trying to create his own breed of treant-like servants that would heed his will. He invested a great deal of time into his work, and was initially quite pleased with his progress until a failed experiment produced the first dark trees, which rebelled and killed him."
