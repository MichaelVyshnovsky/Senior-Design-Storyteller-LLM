        "mainbody": "'''Benauril''' was an outcast [[wizard]] from [[Halruaa]] who was active ''circa'' the mid-to-late 12{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was notable for creating the creatures known as [[dark tree]]s.",
        "Activities": "Benauril's research involved [[necromancy]] and a variety of other, similarly distasteful forms of [[magic]].",
        "History": "From within the [[Aerilpar Forest]], Benauril spent a great deal of time trying to create his own breed of [[treant]]-like servants that would heed his will. He invested a great deal of time into his work, and was initially quite pleased with his progress until a failed experiment produced the first dark trees, which rebelled and killed him."
