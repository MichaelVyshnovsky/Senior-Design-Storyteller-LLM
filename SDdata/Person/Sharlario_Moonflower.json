        "mainbody": "'''Sharlario Moonflower''' was a flame-haired [[moon elf]] who lived more than 25,000 years before the [[Time of Troubles]]. He was one of the first [[moon elf|moon elves]] who came to [[Faer没n]].",
        "History": "Before he came to the Realms he was a merchant, maybe a pirate, in the Realm known as [[Faerie]]. He made port in [[Tintageer]] shortly before invading forces attacked it and magical flood drove the survivors away. He traveled with the last fifty people of Tintageer through a gate to the northern parts of Faer没n. They landed on the top of a plateau of burned stone. It was the site of a fight between [[Avariel]] and the [[red dragon]] [[Mahatnartorian]]. He had even sensed the magic of the gate and came to attack the new intruders in his realm. But [[Avariel]] came to help the elves and they took Sharlario with them.\n\nAfter this he helped the Avariel to fight the dragon. They could not kill him, but together they drove him to the south of [[Faer没n]] and banned him for centuries from the north. Later Sharlario married a priestess of [[Sehanine Moonbow]] and both got many children. All of them followed their mothers worship for the goddess of moonlight and became known as [[moon elves]]. \n\nSharlario began to wander over the newfound continent and traveled to other sites and elven communities. Nearly 300 years after the elves of [[Tintageer]] came to Faer没n the moon elf and his son [[Cornaith Moonflower|Cornaith]] traveled to the south. One evening, when both had made their camp in a wood they were visited by [[Eilistraee]]. The goddess warned them of a dangerous race in the south. Powerful and evil [[dark elves]] in city known as [[Atorrnash]] who worshiped the evil god [[Vhaeraun]]. They visited the city and became guests of the dark elf and ruler of the city, the mage [[Ka'Narlist]]. They exchanged gifts and Sharlario learned that [[Mahatnartorian]] would soon came back to the north.\n\nWhen Sharlario came back to the elven settlements in his home, the archmage [[Durothil (prince)|Durothil]] seemed to have dealt with the dragon. Durothil showed him the egg of a silver dragon. He planned to raise the dragon and learn to fly with it. During the following years both trained in secret with the young [[Silverywing]]. Twenty years later Durothil and Silverywing died in the final battle against [[Mahatnartorian]]. Sharlario swore to the dying elven prince, that he would train other elves to follow the example of the first dragonrider and bond with good aligned dragons for the good of the elves.\n\nHe became later the founder of the city [[Sharlarion]] which was centuries later attacked by a huge army of Orcs."
