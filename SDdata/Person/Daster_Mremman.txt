Lord '''Daster Mremman''' was a ruler of the city of [[Sammaresh]] in [[Lapaliiya]] some time before [[1373 DR]].{{Cite dragon/272/The New Adventures of Volo: Quotations of the Realms|97}}

He ruled from the Mantimera Throne (named for the [[mantimera]]) and was advised by the [[Whispering Serpent]]. Daster was an ancestor of Lady [[Ilnara Mremman]], who ruled ''circa'' 1373 DR.

Daster wrote a biography titled ''[[My Years on the Mantimera Throne]]''.
