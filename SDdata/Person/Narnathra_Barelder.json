        "mainbody": "Lady Narnathra Barelder was a Cormyrean noblewoman and the head of the Barelder family in the late 15 century DR.\nNarnathra wore a short haircut suitable for wearing a helmet, and only wore gowns at weddings.\nLady Narnathra practised with two swords daily, and used clever and shrewd investments in the rebuilding of Sembia to enrich the family.\nNarnathra was the eldest of Lord Montror and Lady Asmraes three children. She married Varkander Heldruth, a lowborn seacaptain who she loved dearly, and had two children, Maereenra and Braeryl.\nTwo of her closest friends were Lady Laeyalane Tantorn and Lady Cathone \"Cat\" Ravenhill, who were also her lovers.\nNarnathra was raised by her mother to be a sensible and wise ruler, and became head of House Barelder in 1479 DR when her father Montror Barelder was slain."
