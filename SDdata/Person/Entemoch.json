        "mainbody": "Entemoch, the Prince of Earth Elementals, was a mighty earth elemental, possibly an archomental.At no point does it explicitly say that Entemoch is an archomental, but given that both Ogremoch, his supposed twin, and Sunnis, his consort, are archomentals it seems likely.\nEntemoch resembled an earth elemental barely  tall, with smooth stone that showed no cracks, but which was nonetheless more unfinished, less polished in appearance, and only vaguely humanoid in form. He gave off an aura of power and completion that belied his simple form, and compassion was obvious on his face.\nEntemoch was the son of Grumbar and the twin brother of Ogrémoch, as well as the consort of Sunnis.\nEntemoch was considered to have long been friend to the svirfneblin of Blingdenstone as of the mid-14th century DR, and when he appeared to them around that time, it was taken as a sign of favor from their god Segojan Earthcaller.\nJust days before the end of the Time of Troubles, a group of svirfneblin priests successfully summoned Entemoch in a cavern a days walk northwest of Blingdenstone. His appearance, brief though it was, inspired joy in the svirfneblin of that city and left a mark on the location, which was thereafter called Entemochs Boon."
