        "mainbody": "'''Malakar Surth''' was a merchant from [[Marsember]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Malakar Surth sounded sour and sarcastic, often speaking with a thin voice. He was a lean, tall man. His face was hard and thin.",
        "Personality": "Malakar was a sarcastic, insensitive man with a superior attitude and a cruel, sadistic streak.",
        "Possessions": "Malakar and Bezrar both had Marsemban long knifes, often used for gutting fish, but also for combat.\n\nOf note, Malakar Surth owned a coach, stables, and two dapple gray draft horses. His house was very private, and contained numerous traps.",
        "Activities": "Malakar dealt in alcohol, drugs, perfumes, and poisons, often with spell-wielding outlanders.",
        "Relationships": "[[Aumun Tholant Bezrar]] and Malakar Surth were known to have worked together, and it was believed by [[Durexter Dagohnlar]] that Malakar was the leader, while Bezrar was not as bold without him. Malakar knew that Aumun was infatuated with a dancer at [[the Amorous Anchor]].\n\nMalakar Surth had recently come to be associated with a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]], [[Harnrim Starangh]]. He also appeared to be aware of someone known as [[Ponczer]] at [[the Firehelm]].",
        "History": "As of the early spring of {{yearlink|1373}}, Malakar Surth and Aumun Tholant Bezrar had both been swindled of 10,000 [[gp]] by [[Durexter Dagohnlar]].\n\nAt the Dagohnlars' bedroom, they were able to get in undetected, then attack while the married couple was unclad, and otherwise engaged in bed, attacking with surprise. Aumun Tholant Bezrar, after choking Durexter, captured Starmara; while binding her, Malakar Surth noticed she had a tattoo. Their two victims were first tied up on the rug, and then tied to the bedposts. They were distracted by [[Narnra Shalace]], a thief, bursting into the room through the window, seeking to escape a pursuing [[Harper]], [[Glarasteer Rhauligan]].{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|98-105|6}}\n\nGlarasteer made quick work of the two: Aumun Tholant Bezrar fled after sustaining minor injuries, while Malakar Surth was pinned under a chest that fell atop his head, knocked out, and promptly ignored by the Harper. After he healed Narnra, she fled too, making him leave the scene to resume his pursuit.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|107-109|7}} Durexter and Starmara Dagohnlar tried to free themselves and kill Malakar Surth.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|113-114|7}}\n\nMalakar got up to see the first rays of dawn, and managed to free himself before Starmara and Durexter released themselves. As he had an appointment early in the morning, he fled the house at full speed rather than eliminate them, suffering numerous accidents as he descended the stairs. He found Aumun Tholant Bezrar waiting for him at the door, with a coach car, warm towels, and a change of clothes, all of which were actually Malakar Surth's; he wondered briefly how come the man had known of those or managed to get his hands on them, given his house was trapped and never visited.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|116-120|7}}\n\nThe coach drove them to [[Haelithtorntowers]], where [[Harnrim Starangh]] had wanted them for meeting Lady [[Joysil Ambrur]].{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|144-145|9}} They remained with Harnrim Starangh through the meeting, though they hardly spoke; they both heard that [[Vangerdahast]] had retired to a sanctum near [[Mouth o' Gargoyles]], where he hoped to complete a certain task and maybe sire a heir.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|169-175|10}}\n\nThey were summoned at a later date by Harnrim Starangh, who provided them with a bag of explosive devices and compelled them to pursue [[Vangerdahast]] with a spell, destroying any [[helmed horror]]s on the way to the sanctum by using the aforementioned devices. He then teleported them near the sanctum. The two of them started on their path, though they were disoriented and suspicious of their own actions, yet powerless not to follow the path before them.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|239-244|15}} They continued to follow the path, attacking the helmed horrors before them with explosives, until they were attacked by a [[War Wizard]] sentry, [[Pheldemar]], and fled.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|253-257|16}}\n\nThe two made it back to [[Marsember]], where they took refuge in the upper floors of a warehouse, near a box of [[Selgauntan glowstone]]s, which Malakar believed would make them impossible to find by magic. While in there, they eavesdropped on two nobles, [[Thaedro]] and [[Sauvrurn]], and learned that the ruffians owning that warehouse, almost certainly they themselves, were sought by the authorities and had been for many days. Learning of the [[Rightful Conspiracy]] and their plan to kill [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]] and [[Alusair Obarskyr]], they decided instead to leave Marsember entirely.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|339-342|21}}\n\nShortly after they boarded a ship bound for [[Sembia]], continuing to banter throughout the trip. While on the ship, they witnessed a [[fang dragon]] with a swath of rainbow-colored scales on its flank, which interrupted one of their fights. Surth considered leaving for Yhaunn, Westgate, or the Pirate Isles, to get away from Red Wizards; Bezrar was just glad they wouldn't see Harnrim Starangh again. Unknown to them, Harnrim was aboard the same ship, transformed into a ballast-stone, also trying to escape scrutiny.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|377-378|Epilogue}}"
