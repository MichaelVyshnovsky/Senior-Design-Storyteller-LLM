        "mainbody": "ajon al-Yaqud was once a leader of the nomadic members of House Bakr in the High Desert.\nNajon was part of a group who overthrew the sultan of Tajar. He was offered the position of captain of the cavalry of Tajar by the new sultan, but Najon refused the offer and returned to the desert. He had a vision of a beautiful marid crying because of the sadness that would follow the House of Bakr if they remained in Tajar. He left the next morning for the desert with his son and a group of tribesmen, but promised to aid the sheikh and his descendants should they ever require it.\nNajons son, Ajan would later take his place to lead the tribe in the desert."
