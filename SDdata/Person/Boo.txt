==Description==
{{Quote|I've never heard of a miniature version, let alone a conversant one. Which means Boo is either a rare specimen, or an ordinary hamster.|[[Lae'zel]]}}
Boo was a fuzzy [[hamster]], though others claimed that he was a [[miniature giant space hamster]]. While there was skepticism regarding the claim, Minsc insisted that Boo was, in fact, a space hamster who was intelligent and could converse coherently with him. However, as Minsc was quite addled, it was unclear whether or not his claims were true.<ref><ref> When he travelled to [[Barovia]], Minsc asked the [[vistana]] seer, [[Madam Eva]], about his "space hamster companion", she responded with "the one you call Boo"? This might suggest that she acknowledged Boo as a space hamster, though her response could be seen as the opposite, as she did not directly answer as she did with Minsc's name.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 2}}

==History==
{{quote|''For every song of Minsc the ranger, they sing ten of the hamster Boo. And not just because his name is easier for the rhyming.''|Minsc of Rashemen}}<br/>
In [[1409 DR]], a statue honoring Minsc and Boo was commissioned in [[Baldur's Gate]] by the merchant [[Orburt Lewel]]. The statue, known as the [[Beloved Ranger]], depicted Boo cupped in Minsc's hands. It was a popular landmark and meeting point in [[the Wide]]. Unbeknownst to anyone at the time, the statue was actually the real Minsc and Boo under the effects of [[flesh to stone|petrification]] magic.

In [[1479 DR]], a group of teenagers vandalized the Beloved Ranger statue, breaking off its hands and Boo. The vandals were later apprehended and the statue was fixed.

Sometime in the 1480s [[DR]], the Beloved Ranger was accidentally struck by a [[wild magic]] surge caused by the [[wild mage]] [[Delina]], as a result of an attempt to cast a spell at an attacking [[gargoyle]]. The surge [[dispel magic|dispelled]] the petrification effect, returning Minsc and Boo to life. The pair joined up with the thieves [[Krydle]] and [[Shandie]] to battle the [[Cult of the Dragon]].{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 1}}

In the battle against [[Deniak]], who had used his position in the Cult to perform a [[ritual]] in order to transform himself into a [[red dragon]],{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 4}} Boo's effective attack against Deniak's eye provided a significant advantage to Minsc, Delina, and their companions.

Some time later, in [[Svardborg]], Boo accidentally drank a ''[[potion of growth]]'' that had been dropped by Minsc, and temporarily grew to the size of a regular giant space hamster.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5}}
