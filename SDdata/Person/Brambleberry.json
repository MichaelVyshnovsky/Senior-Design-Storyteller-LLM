        "mainbody": "Lord Brambleberry was a noble of Waterdeep.\nHe held a great hatred for Luskans pirate activity. In 1376 DR, he agreed with Captain Deudermont of the Sea Sprite to reform Luskan by eliminating the High Captains of Luskan and the Arcane Brotherhood. Lord Brambleberry gathered his familys troops and together with Deudermont invaded Luskan. They were victorious in the fighting against the Brotherhoods forces (the High Captains having retreated to see who was the victor of the battle). In the main attack against the Host Tower of the Arcane, the Archmage Arcane escalated the battle to extremes and forced Deudermont and Brambleberry to destroy the Host Tower. However, the destruction of the tower caused many dead, among them Lord Brambleberry.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryNobles\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryFood and drink from Maskyrs Eye\nCategoryFood and drink from the Vast\nCategoryFood and drink from the Dragon Reach\nCategoryFood and drink from the Eastern Heartlands\nCategoryFood and drink from North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants\nsetcsk9i72b362wephy14j5vgzmynff"
