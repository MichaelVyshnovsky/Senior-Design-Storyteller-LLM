        "mainbody": "'''Dekirh Fasthands''' was a [[jester]]-[[bard]] who performed in the rowdiest taverns across the [[Sword Coast]] some years before the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "When Dekirh insisted on doing his shows across the worst of the taverns of the Sword Coast, his friends gifted him with a set of [[enchanted]] [[chainmail]], in hopes that the armor would protect him from the things patrons threw at Dekirh: rotten produce and [[knives]]. To wear ''[[Jester's Chain]]'' on stage, Dekirh Fasthands painted the chainmail in bright jesterly colors of reds, blues, and [[gold]]s. Dekirh's final fate remained unrecorded, however, ''Jester's Chain'' eventually left his posession, ending up in [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, and later, in [[Thay]]."
