        "mainbody": "ekirh Fasthands was a jester-bard who performed in the rowdiest taverns across the Sword Coast some years before the mid-14 century DR.\nWhen Dekirh insisted on doing his shows across the worst of the taverns of the Sword Coast, his friends gifted him with a set of enchanted chainmail, in hopes that the armor would protect him from the things patrons threw at Dekirh rotten produce and knives. To wear Jesters Chain on stage, Dekirh Fasthands painted the chainmail in bright jesterly colors of reds, blues, and golds. Dekirhs final fate remained unrecorded, however, Jesters Chain eventually left his posession, ending up in Athkatla in Amn in the , and later, in Thay."
