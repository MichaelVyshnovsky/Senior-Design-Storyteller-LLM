'''Twillist''' was a rogue mage of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Abilities==
Twillist's spellcraft was good enough that he could comprehend the "ends" of [[spell]]s quite well. Such "ends" were distinct sections of casting described on separate pages, often scattered and impossible to find easily save by the author's own familiarity. The practice was common among [[elf]] mages at the time.

==Activities==
Twillist liked to collect such "ends" and then trade them for complete spells

==History==
In the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]], Elminster briefly remembered the rogue mage Twillist of Myth Drannor when he discovered a number of "ends" of spells at [[Moonshorn Tower]].
