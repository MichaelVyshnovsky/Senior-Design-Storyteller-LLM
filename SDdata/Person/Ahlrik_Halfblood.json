        "mainbody": "'''Ahlrik Halfblood''' was a treasure-obsessed [[half-elven]] adventurer, active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Ahlrik's beautiful face, the product of her half-elven blood, hid her cold nature. The only thing she cared about was collecting treasure and valuable works of art. She had no friends, while the closest personal connections of the half-elf were those hired to guard Ahlrik's collection.",
        "History": "Ahlrik Halfblood was born in a humble town along the [[Deepwash]]â€”[[Shalane]] in [[Erlkazar]]. She quickly developed expensive tastes and dedicated her life to acquiring things of great value. Despite the accumulated collection, Ahlrik did not have extra money and could not afford to hire adventurers, instead, she used her skills of a [[mage]] and a [[fighter]] to retrieve treasures personally.\n\nSometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, Ahlrik Halfblood was among [[adventurer]]s interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally mysterious magical ''orb'' from its depths."
