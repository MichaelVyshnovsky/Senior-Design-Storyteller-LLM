'''Garynor Ithal''' was the fourth king of [[Tethyr]] and the [[Ithal Dynasty]].

==Relationships==
Garynor was the first son of King [[Nishan Ithal]]. His twin sister was [[Rhynda Ithal]]. He was the father of at least one [[Garynor Ithal II|son]], who shared his name.

==History==
Garynor was born in the {{YearlinkName|-159}}. He acceded to the throne upon his father Nishan's death in {{Yearlink|-98}}.

Most of King Garynor's reign seemed cursed under the cloak of [[Beshaba]]. Relations with the [[elves]] began to deteriorate, the clans did not support Garynor's twin sister Rhynda as court vizera, and piracy was on the rise. The tragedy continued when the king's son, Crown Prince [[Garynor Ithal II|Garynor II]] was murdered by a member of [[Clan Karlag]], because the prince had been trying to establish a peace deal with the elves of [[Forest of Tethir|Tethir]].

King Garynor died unexpectedly in the {{YearlinkName|-75}}.Page 27 of the "Tethyr" booklet of the [[Lands of Intrigue (boxed set)|''Lands of Intrigue'' boxed set]] accidentally calls [[Nishan Ithal II]] Garynor's grandson. This is corrected later on the same page and also by the "Erlkazar & Folk of Intrigue" booklet in the same boxed set, as well as by ''[[Empires of the Shining Sea]]'' and ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]''. [[Nishan Ithal II|Nishan II]], who had not yet come of age. For the next month, there was conflict as to who would rule in the interim. Despite great distrust of her among the clans, Vizera Rhynda began to rule as regent.
