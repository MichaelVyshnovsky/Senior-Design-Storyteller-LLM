}}'''Thokkor of the Furrowed Mountains''' was in charge of [[Huzuz]]'s mercenary units.

==Personality==
Thokkor's strong sense of discipline snapped the unruly mercenaries serving Huzuz into shape after he assumed command. Under Thokkor's guidance, they became the bravest units in Huzuz's military.

==Activities==
Thokkor spent all of his time training three mercenary units. Each had 700 men.

He lived in an apartment within the [[Hall of Commanders]] in the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]].

==History==
Once a slave, Thokkor was bought and freed by [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]] in the days before Khalil became the [[Grand Caliph]]. The two would often adventure together and grew quite close. Thokkor swore his allegiance to Khalil and offered to serve in the military, eventually rising to command Huzuz's mercenary forces.
