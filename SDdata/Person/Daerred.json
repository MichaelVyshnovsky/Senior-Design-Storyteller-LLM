        "mainbody": "'''Daerred''' was a [[bard]] leader of the [[Adventurer's Guild (Crossroad Keep)|Adventurer's Guild]] of the [[Crossroad Keep]] who led his own adventuring troupe in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''It will be one of the finest schools for adventurers in the Sword Coast. Within, you will learn to be more effective as a team, whether in combat or traveling through the wilderness.''|Daerred}}",
        "Description": "Daerred was a very tall man with olive-colored skin. He wore a colorful bardic garb and a wide-brimmed hat decorated with a feather. His affable personality made him radiate optimism and positivity. Some said it was the cheerfulness and positive outlook that helped Daerred survive and become the seasoned adventurer he was.",
        "History": "Daerred' and his companions claimed to had trained in the art of adventuring under the illustrious Knight-Captain, also known as the [[Kalach-Cha]]. When Daerred was granted permission to open his guild in the [[Neverwintran]]-controlled fortress of the Crossroad Keep, his traveling companions, [[Candril]], [[Maxil]], and [[Juen]] joined as the guild's trainers. Together, they dreamed of opening the greatest adventuring school on the [[Sword Coast]], passing along all things they learned from the Knight-Captain to the next generation of heroes. Daerred called his guild \"the Adventurer's Guild. Crossroad Keep branch,\" however, as of ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, it was the only branch. Daerred and his crew offered training to fellow adventurers in combat and social situations, as well as teamwork."
