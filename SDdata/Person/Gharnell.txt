Gharnell was a bard and adventurer in Undermountain in 1479 DR.
In 1479 DR, he went with his party into Undermountain. However, his companions were slaughtered by the goblin and kobold followers of the mad half-elf mercenary Zarr. Gharnell was spared only for his knowledge of the Goblin and Draconic languages. Zarr ordered him to teach Common to the dimmer and most hostile of his supporters.
