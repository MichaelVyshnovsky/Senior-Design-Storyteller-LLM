'''Mroarild Sarvarada''' was a traveling merchant, performer, gemcutter, and the adoptive father of [[Taline Telgara]] around the turn of the 10{{th}} century DR.

==History==
As a merchant, he sold minor articles of clothing and jewelry; his routine performanced included juggling, dancing, acrobatics, and short comedy stints with his wife. They adopted [[Taline Telgara]], an orphan from near [[Everlund]], after her family was killed by [[orc]] raids, and she soon joined their performances. By Taline's second season as a performer, he was adamant they only perform as a family, never alone, and he always had a knife out, on the lookout for admirers of his adoptive daughter. He eventually retired from the road, and became a gemcutter for a coster based in [[Athkatla]] together with his wife, [[Nanath Sarvarada]].
