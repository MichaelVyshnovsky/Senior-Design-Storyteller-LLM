Mroarild Sarvarada was a traveling merchant, performer, gemcutter, and the adoptive father of Taline Telgara around the turn of the 10 century DR.
As a merchant, he sold minor articles of clothing and jewelry his routine performanced included juggling, dancing, acrobatics, and short comedy stints with his wife. They adopted Taline Telgara, an orphan from near Everlund, after her family was killed by orc raids, and she soon joined their performances. By Talines second season as a performer, he was adamant they only perform as a family, never alone, and he always had a knife out, on the lookout for admirers of his adoptive daughter. He eventually retired from the road, and became a gemcutter for a coster based in Athkatla together with his wife, Nanath Sarvarada.
