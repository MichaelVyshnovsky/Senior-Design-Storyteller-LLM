        "mainbody": "Warrior '''Vu'un''' was a [[githyanki]] sentry who guarded the hatchery of [[Crèche Y'llek]] on [[Toril]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''Step carefully while here. Our hatchery is protected by lethal safeguards. I do not wish to pick your remains from them.''|Warrior Vu'un}}",
        "Description": "Vu'un had typical yellow leathery skin of his race and an elongated face. He was adorned in a [[githyanki half-plate]] and wore a [[helmet]] of the same design.",
        "History": "Warrior Vu'un, along with other [[gith]] of what would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the [[Rosymorn Monastery]] of [[Lathander]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in [[Faerûn]] shifted in balance. During that time, warrior Vu'un stood guard in the Crèche's hatchery and its youths' caretaker [[Varsh Ko'kuu]]. Vu'un did not trust ''istik'', but respected them being allowed into the Crèche. Under Vu'un's watchful eyes, outsiders were not allowed near githyanki eggs."
