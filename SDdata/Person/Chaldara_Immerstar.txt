Chaldara Immerstar was an adventuress in Myth Drannor in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Chaldara was a scribe at the temple of Tymora in Arabel but her hunger for adventure convinced her to leave. She helped some female warriors to defeat orcs near Mistledale when she was recruited to join the still-forming Company of the Catlash.
In 1370 DR, the Company decided to go to Myth Drannor in order to acquire some magic items to empower them.
Chaldara was a long-standing member of the Company of the Catlash.
Chaldara wanted to live a life full of adventures until she could one day meet and marry a male cleric of Tymora and together start a new temple somewhere in Faer√ªn and a family.
