        "mainbody": "King Rogdok was a hobgoblin ruler that took over a small band of goblins in the Cloud Peaks during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nWhile Rogdoks goblins considered him their king, he saw them in much less favorable terms.\nIn the , a tribe of goblins came to worship a wild mage by the name of Adoy, who they believed was Bargrivyek the goblinoid deity of cooperation and territory. Curious as to why a large number of goblins appeared so suddenly, Rogdok went to investigate.\nSeeing an opportunity, Rogdok imprisoned Adoy and used his control over the goblinoid \"deity\" to appoint himself as the king of the tribe.\nAt some point he and his hobgoblins killed a local ranger by the name of Rilsa."
