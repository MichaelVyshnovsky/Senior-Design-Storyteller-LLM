Orist Moonbow was an impetuous Harper in Maztica around 1370 DR.
Orist was sent to Maztica by High Harper Khelben Arunsun together with fellow Harpers Lady Syllia Adarbrent and Farid al-Nisr. They had orders to investigate wrongs done to the natives of Payit and Maztica. Orist was shocked by the Golden Legions brutality and prepared to take immediate action. Orist began recruiting some Mazticans, teaching them to forge metal. He also gained a student, a young native named Tocil.
