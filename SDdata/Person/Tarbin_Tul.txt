'''Tarbin Tul''' was a wandering [[bard]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Tarbin Tul performed along the [[High Road]] and always looked for new tunes to add to his enormous collection. ''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], while staying at the [[Wayside Inn]] one night, he accidentally witnessed an [[undead]] attack. The undead had been created by the cult of [[Myrkul]] led by [[Ularan Mortus]]. A group of [[adventurer]]s was able to defend the inn against the attack.

Later, while Tarbin was again staying at the Wayside Inn, a cult of [[Talos]] led by [[Fheralai Stormsworn]] took over the inn. Although the cultists' ritual to turn the inn into a temple of Talos was stopped in time, they managed to kidnap Tarbin. Eventually, the same group of adventurers came to the Tarbin's rescue and freed him from his captivity.
