'''Stanhard Grimwulf''' was an [[Uthgardt]] [[human]] chief of the [[Elk tribe]] of the [[Evermoors]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Notably, he was a possessor of the ''[[helmet of disjunction]]'', a relic with the power to break all [[magic]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}

==History==
In the conflict known as the [[Battle of the Evermoors]] sometime around [[1400 DR]],<ref group="note">The battle is undated but is "a century ago" from the date of ''Honor Among Thieves'', which is itself undated but assumed to be the late 1490s DR. The {{yearlinkName|1402}}, is a likely candidate. the Elk tribe battled the [[black dragon]] [[Rakor]] and the [[Cult of the Dragon]] for control of the ''helmet of disjunction''. Although Stanhard's Elk warriors outnumbered the Dragon Cultists, Rakor more than up the different by flying overhead and vomiting [[acid]] on the barbarians' ranks. Stanhard gave the helmet to one of his men, [[Toke Horgath]] to carry to safety, but Toke was abruptly slain by a Dragon Cultist. Ordering a retreat, Stanhard retrieved the helmet and entrusted it to his fastest rider, [[Ven Salafin]], to get it away from Rakor however he could before the chief was dissolved in acid as well. The fallen Elk tribesmen were buried at a [[Evermoors cemetery|sacred burial ground on the site]].<ref group="note">It's unknown how and why Stanhard had the ''helmet of disjunction'', nor why Rakor and the Cult of the Dragon wanted it beyond its magical and monetary value. The product description for the [[w:c:nerf:Rakor|Rakor Nerf blaster toy]] describes Rakor as unleashing acid breath on adventures who dared challenge him or touch his treasure, which is perhaps meant to imply the Elk tribe stole the Helmet from his hoard. This at least fits the Elk tribe's usual habits.

A century later, in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} the body of Stanhard Grimwulf was exhumed by [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Simon Aumar]], [[Doric]], and [[Holga Kilgore]] (a member of the Elk tribe herself). Using Simon's ''[[deathly token]]'' to [[speak with dead|speak with the dead]], they questioned the long-dead chief over the fate of the ''helmet of disjunction''.
