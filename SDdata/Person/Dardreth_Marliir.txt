Dardreth Marliir was a member of the Marliir noble family of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
He was an unscrupulously cold and calculating man. He sought the rule of Arabel and cared not who sat upon the Dragon Throne.
He was the elder brother of Dauneth Marliir, but considered Dauneth to be a servile idiot.
