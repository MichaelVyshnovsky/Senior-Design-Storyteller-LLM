Jaerloon Bucklbar was a dwarf warrior who inhabited the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Jaerloon was a white-bearded dwarf whose face was weathered by time. He presented a regal air of authority.
He lived within the Raging Lion inn located on Lion Street in the northeastern section of Waterdeeps North Ward.
Jaerloon, along with his close friend Ilmairen Arnskull, served as a point of contact for dwarves entering Waterdeep. He enjoyed whittling wood and wrestling. Jaerloon also possessed an uncanny ability to snatch missiles out of the air.
