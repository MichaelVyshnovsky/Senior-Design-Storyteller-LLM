        "mainbody": "adrille the Reef-Reaver was a lieutenant of the Cult of Talos in the late 15 century DR. She was in charge of the cults operations in the Thunder Cliff Caves.\nGadrille was a despotic and immensely committed servant of Talos.\nGadrille was an experienced wizard specializing in the school of evocation magic.\nGadrille had a fiendish pet named \"Tooth-N-Claw\" that was fiercely protective of her.\nGadrille and her subordinates enticed unwary ships near to the caverns and destroyed them on the magical reefs. They kidnapped the crew, either sacrificing them to Talos or selling them as slaves. The debris was dragged into the caves and anything of value was salvaged and sold. The cult of Talos used the wealth gained from this heinous endeavor to finance agents along the Sword Coast and the High Road who tried to build shrines that would ultimately give the cult control of the region.\nGadrille was loyal to the cults leader, Fheralai Stormsworn. Although Fheralai recognized Gadrilles unpredictability, her unwavering commitment to the cult of Talos made her a formidable and feared lieutenant. To keep her zeal in check, Fheralai appointed Sovendahl Erkinze as Gadrilles deputy to help her and keep a watch on her unstable tendencies.\nGadrille treated the cultists who worked under her with severity and cruelty. When she suspected a cultist of not being pious enough, the cultist would be hauled into the caves so-called blowhole to be judged by Talos. Unbeknownst to her, the blowhole was actually a magical portal that activated randomly, transporting a creature to a distant location.\nCirca 1491 DR, Gadrilles second-in-command, Sovendahl Erkinze, disapproved of some of her more reckless actions and secretly met with the cults leader, Fheralai Stormsworn, urging her to put a stop to it. Gadrille complied with Fheralais request but prayed to Talos to punish Sovendahl. The god answered her prayers and cursed Sovendahl.\nA little later, the Thunder Cliff Caves were attacked from sea by a group of adventurers. They defeated Gadrille and her Talos cultists, putting an end to her operation."
