'''Bohaim''' was a young [[mage]] from [[Suzail]] that served as a member of the [[Company of Dawn]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Bohaim and the rest of the company, led by the indominable warrior [[Thurbrand]], accompanied the outlaw adventurers [[Kelemvor]], [[Cyric]], [[Adon]], and their newest member [[Midnight]] through the [[Spiderhaunt Wood]] in [[Shadowdale]]. 

The journey was disastrous for the company, as many members of their group were slain by the monstrous [[spider]]s within. Bohaim was killed when one of the spiders pierced its leg through the young mage's chest, much to the horror of onlookers.
