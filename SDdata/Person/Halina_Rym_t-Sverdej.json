        "mainbody": "'''Halina Rymüt-Sverdej''' was a [[Thayan]] woman who lived in [[Innarlith]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] in the mid–14{{th}} century DR. She was the niece of the [[Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rymüt]].<ref>.",
        "History": "Halina's uncle Marek was sent to Innarlith in [[1340 DR]] to be a clandestine agent for the Red Wizards in Innarlith.<ref> He posed as a self-employed mage who traded in [[magic item]]s and used his place in the city to develop connections with the city's elite and learn information.<ref>\n\nHalina was the child of Marek's younger sister. Marek promised his sister that he would take care of her after she died. Halina thus went to join Marek in Innarlith once her mother became deceased. <ref>\n\nShe developed a romantic relationship with [[Willem Korvan]], who was employed by Senator [[Inthelph]] to be the master builder of Innarlith and had been entrusted with the rebuilding of the city wall.<ref> Unknown to Willem was that her uncle had been collecting information on him and his career in Innarlith.<ref>\n\nWillem loved Halina greatly and got engaged to marry her. However, he felt pressure not to do so because he was [[Cormyrean]] and he thought he needed to marry a local woman if he wanted to advance his career in Innarlith. While he was still engaged to Halina, Willem tried to court a relationship with [[Phyrea]], the daughter of Senator [[Inthelph]], his main patron in Innarlith and was encouraged by Inthelph to marry his daughter. Willem's mother [[Thurene]] also pressured him to make this 'sacrifice' in order to get a title through Inthelph<ref>. Halina often tried to get Willem introduced to her uncle, but he kept avoiding the occasion and didn't meet Marek until he had himself become a senator in Innarlith.<ref>\n\nEventually Willem broke off the relationship with Halina altogether and went to get married with Phyrea. Halina was greatly distraught after the break up and she went to  the temple of Chauntea in Innarlith to give herself over in service  to the goddess. Her uncle was displeased with this and tried to get her to leave it.<ref>.\n\nShe remained and became a priestess of Chauntea. She met [[Surero]], an [[alchemist]] who had formerly worked on the canal project, at the [[Sisterhood of Pastorals]]. He befriended her and talked to her to see if she could help them with the growing number of undead that the city was using to build the canal as well as other projects. Halina talked to the other sisters and they agreed to get involved in the situation by secretly destroying the undead creatures. These undead had been created by by her uncle [[Marek Rymüt]] and others in the Thayan enclave in Innarlith, and her uncle came to realize what she was doing behind his back.<ref>.\n\nOn [[Eleasis 5]] [[1373 DR]], she and another priestess were attempting to destroy zombies working at the docks in Innarlith when she was confronted by [[Wenefir]] a powerful cleric of [[Cyric]] in service to Ransar [[Pristoleph]] along with the Ransar's [[Black firedrake]]s. She and the older priestess were both killed in the fight that ensued. Their bodies were thrown into the [[Lake of Steam]]<ref>.\n\nFollowing their deaths, the high priestess of Chauntea in Innarlith went to meet with Pristoleph to ask for his help in finding what happened to them. Pristoleph told her that he had no idea what had happened and would give his full support to her<ref>.\n\nWillem Korvan, who had been transformed into an undead creature by Marek, went to find Halina at the Sisterhood of Pastorals and discovered her grave there, although he couldn't consciously understand who she was and what her former relationship with him had been. He ran away after he was spotted by a priestess of Chauntea.<ref>."
