        "mainbody": "Kinterly ran a magic shop in Zhentil Keep in 1357 DR.\nKinterly ran Kinterlys Magics, one of the few recognized magic shops in the Realms. Usually he tried to buy genuine magic items while claiming they were mundane, and sold almost-empty and non-functional magic items as if they were full-powered.\nKinterly had two fire giant assistants and a very good relationship with the Zhentil Keep guard."
