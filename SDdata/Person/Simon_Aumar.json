Less importantly, he also had an uncle.\n\nSimon tried to court Doric once, but she broke it off, claiming he made her feel sad, because of who he was rather than anything he did.

        "History": {
            "Once a Thief": "[[File:Simon and amazing thieves.png|thumb|left|250px|''Forge, Edgin, Simon, and Holga, alleged heroes.'']]\nIn the early 1490s DR, Simon was hired by the residents of an unnamed village on the [[Sword Coast]] to investigate mysterious happenings and disappearances on a supposedly haunted isle just off the coast, but he failed to return as well. Finally, two of the villagers, [[Del (person)|Del]] and [[Grace]], went in search of help finding their missing friend, [[Feltin]], and got in contact with [[Forge Fitzwilliam]], [[Edgin Darvis]], and [[Holga Kilgore]], who agreed to help for a reward. Edgin, Holga, and Forge traveled to the island and found a single survivor: Simon, still alive but ensnared in strange black oily vines that dragged creatures close and restrained them against the trees, slowly consuming them. Begging for help, he convinced the thieves to cut him free in exchange for a lead to a grand target in the city of [[Neverwinter]] that would give them enough coin to last a lifetime. Their investigation led the group to the lair of a [[green hag]] named [[Drueena]], who held Edgin's daughter captive. The band confronted the hag and her enthralled [[roper]], but eventually they broke her magical control over the monster. The angry roper ended the hag's life and with it, the black oily vines withered across the island. As they returned, though they received no reward, Simon had found companionship among the thieves and was invited to stay with them in [[Targos]], to Kira's delight. Before long, he was part of the team. \n\nSimon indeed delivered on his promise and led them to a greater mark. Edgin's thieves received many details about the [[West Caraway Acres]] mansion outside Neverwinter through its owner's disgruntled servant [[Alyanna]]. The group hatched a plan to infiltrate the eccentric [[dragonborn]] wizard [[Torlinn Shrake]]'s masquerade party and steal the legendary ''[[Staff of Aorth]]''.\n\nThey were also caught in a town threatened by the [[Bandit King]] on one [[Feast of the Moon]].<ref>\n\nAt one point, the team did a robbery in [[Loudwater]]; Simon couldn't get his ''[[spider climb]]'' spell to work until the cooper [[Jolym]] set his [[dog]] on him. On another robbery, they stole the [[spear]] of the [[war mage]] [[Aoth Fezim]], but when [[arrow]]s were shot at them, Simon couldn't cast ''[[stoneskin]]'' until the last moment.\n\nFinally, one night whilst the thieves were celebrating a score at the [[Trip and Shuffle]] tavern in Targos, a mysterious hooded figure calling herself \"Lady [[Sofina]]\" met the team. She wanted to hire them to help her steal the treasures of [[Korinn's Keep]], a [[Harper]] storehouse that only a Harper could enterâ€”Edgin. He refused, but Forge promised they would find there a [[Tablet of Reawakening]], a magical relic capable of [[resurrection|resurrecting one deceased soul]]. Against his better judgement but with hopes of restoring his late wife [[Zia]] to life, Edgin relented and acquiesced to Forge's and Sofina's scheme, bringing the whole band in.\n\nDonning his old Harper uniform, Edgin led the team to Korinn's Keep and gained admittance. While the thieves helped themselves to the treasures of the vault, and Sofina claimed a strange red horn, Edgin went for the Tablet of Reawakening. But the poor thief triggered an alarm, summoning Harper guards, whom Sofina struck with ''[[chain lightning]]'', to Edgin's dismay. She then cast ''[[time stop]]'', trapping the guards, Holga, and Edginâ€”Simon tried to ''counterspell'', but found her too strong to beat, and was forced to flee with Forge and Sofina.",
            "Alone Again": "In the mid-1490s DR, Simon was traveling alone when he first met the young [[tiefling]] [[druid]] Doric while she helped a village with their problematic well. He tried to court her, but she broke it off.\n\nFor a time, Simon apprenticed with a [[cleric]] of [[Kelemvor]], god of the dead. From this priest, he acquired his ''deathly token'' that let him ''speak with dead''.It's unknown when Simon apprenticed with the cleric, but since this is new to his companions, this article assumes it was during the period when Edgin and Holga were imprisoned.<ref group=\"note\">The cleric's deity is unspecified, but is assumed to be Kelemvor based on his [[holy symbol]] on the token.<ref group=\"note\">It's unknown why Simon would try to be a cleric; whether he was looking for an alternative to arcane magic or just won't admit to robbing a priest, we may never know.\n\n[[File:TJN Simon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Need a light?'']]\nUltimately, Simon returned to the town of Triboar but eventually found himself \"desperately\" short of coin and homeless. After a time, he found 'work' as a petty thief and stage magician at the [[Triboar playhouse]], where he would cast cantrips and put on poor performances while using a ''mage hand'' spell to pickpocket members of his audience remotely. He tended to sleep in the theater itself.\n\nThat's where he was in the late 1490s DR{{HAT-time}} when Edgin and Holga, newly escaped from [[Revel's End]] prison after two years, came looking for him. Unfortunately, his audience were utterly unimpressed and, to make matters worse, Simon was surprised to see his partners-in-crime, lost concentration, and dropped the valuablesâ€”loudly. With that, his audience transformed into an angry mob looking for justice. When a big guy grabbed him, Simon tried to cast a ''shield'' spell but inadvertently got a ''[[reverse gravity]]'', plunging them to the ceiling, where they kept pursuing until he dropped them again. The next time he tried this, Simon flew through the skylight outside the playhouse, where Holga caught him. The trio rode swiftly out of town.",
            "A Thief Once More": "[[File:Simon.png|thumb|left|200px|''Simon no doubt wondering how the owlbear came to be.'']]\nJoining Edgin and Holga's scheme to rob Forge Fitzwilliamâ€”now Lord of Neverwinter and based in [[Castle Never]]â€”Simon suggested they recruit Doric to their cause for her [[wild shape]] ability.\n\nThey followed Doric back to the wood elves' treetop village, and introduced themselves, though Doric did not even remember Simon.\n\nLater, Doric used her wild shape power to spy inside Castle Never, learning Sofina was a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] and that the vault was protected with a powerful ''[[Mordenkainen's arcane seal]]''. Hearing this, Simon declared the vault impenetrable, proposing he'd need to be [[Toril]]'s greatest sorcerer or else have the ''helmet of disjunction'', a long-lost [[enchanted]] helm that could break all magic. So Edgin proposed they find it. Simon was dismissive; the helmet was lost and privately admitted he would never be able to attune to it anyway. Edgin's attempted encouragement went nowhere, and he decided not to tell the others about Simon's doubts. Fortunately, Holga's people, the [[Elk tribe]], had once battled the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and the [[black dragon]] [[Rakor]] for control of the helmet at the [[Battle of the Evermoors]] a century ago. This gave them a lead, as Simon could enable them to question her deceased ancestors.\n\nAfter a stopover in [[Longsaddle]] so Holga could catch up with her ex-husband [[Marlamin]], Simon insisted Edgin ask all the questions to finish the spell, rather than leave the dead waiting.  After several attempts, they finally learned from the body of [[Ven Salafin]] that a Thayan named Xenk Yendar had retrieved the ''helmet of disjunction''. Edgin was disgusted, thinking all Thayans were killers and corrupted by the Red Wizards' evil. Nevertheless, Simon had heard of him; according to his uncle, Xenk had held back a [[beholder]] with nothing more than a sharpened gourd, or something else sharp, at least.\n\nFortunately, they could find the heroic [[paladin]] Xenk just nearby, in [[Mornbryn's Shield]] and, after seeing him in action, Simon was jealous but was left to negotiate with him. In a Harper sanctuary beneath [[Caldreth's Pickles, Nuts, and Foods]], Xenk told them of the evil of the Red Wizards and [[Szass Tam]]'s takeover of Thay and the turning of its populace to undeath. For his assistance in finding the ''helmet of disjunction'', Xenk required that the thieves share any stolen riches with the Neverwintan people, which to Edgin very reluctantly agreed under Simon's teasing, swearing it on a Harper book.\n\nXenk led the party to the [[Kryptgarden Forest]], where an entrance to the [[Underdark]] lay. After venturing down into the Underdark, the party passed uninterested [[intellect devourer]]s and arrived at the ruins of [[Dolblunde]], wherein Xenk had hidden the ''helmet of disjunction'' long ago. But before Xenk could finish explaining the intricately complicated technique needed to cross the trapped collapsing bridges, Simon inadvertently stepped on it, triggered the trap, and collapsed it, Fortunately, as they considered their options, Simon noticed Holga had a Hither-Thither Staff and used it to create ''[[portal]]s'' through which they could cross into the city. Finding and opening the [[gnome|gnomish]] mechanical box, Xenk retrieved the helm, which Edgin passed to Simon. But that was when a band of [[undead]] [[Thayan]] assassins led by [[Dralas]] showed up, having been sent by Sofina to find and kill the thieves after Doric's spying.\n\nSome time later, with the ''helmet of disjunction'' in their possession, they emerged in the [[Sea of Swords]] and swam to shore. There, Xenk said his farewells and departed; though Simon asked him to stay and assist them, the paladin preferred to let Edgin, Holga, Doric, and Simon use what they had and rise to the occasion themselves rather than for him to keep carrying them himself. Edgin declared them victorious and a fine team of thieves, and ready to go on and rob Castle Never. It wouldn't be so easy, however. Simon struggled to attune to the ''helmet of disjunction'', each time confronted by an image of Elminster in the [[ethereal plane]] that challenged whether he was worthy and blocked him. After hours of trying, Simon eventually admitted this to Edgin, revealing to the others that he'd made him lie about being able to do it, which angered Doric and Holga about the wasted time and effort. Edgin's efforts to encourage them to carry on failed and they almost abandoned the quest and went their separate ways. Finally, he argued they were all failures, with Simon being a petty mage and petty thief, and needed to keep trying and failing, and would only fail if they gave up. Ultimately, the team chose to remain together and try again. Holga suggested a new plan: using the ''hither-thither staff'' to put a ''portal'' on a piece of treasure they could smuggle into the vault.",
            "The Neverwinter Heist": "After camping on the beach for several hours, they headed back to Neverwinter. From a market, Edgin purchased a painting of the famed travelogue writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]] for their plan. First, they removed the canvas, put a ''portal'' on the board, and Doric daubed sap on the frame for glue. On the High Road, Edgin hid under leaves as the wagon rolled over and attached the painting to the bottom of the wagon. Working through the ''portal'', Holga removed the floorboards and Doric fell through the ''portal'' and into the wagon. But then the painting became unstuck as she tried to pull it through the hole; fortunately, Simon grabbed Doric through the ''portal'' and they managed to recover the painting and pull it into the wagon. With it flat on the floor, Holga reattached the floorboards through the ''portal'' and Simon closed the portal. Doric replaced the canvas and wild shaped into a fly to leave the wagon.\n\nHeading into Neverwinter during the opening of the High Sun Games, they rented an upstairs meeting room at the [[Driftwood Tavern]], not realizing they were recognized by Jil Torbo of the Absolution Council, who would summon the Neverwinter Guard. In their room, they tried to use their ''portal'', but the painting had fallen flat on the floor, proving to be a nigh-impenetrable barrier. While Doric chiseled a hole in the floor through the ''portal'' in hopes of slipping through as a worm, Edgin proposed Simon try again with the ''helmet of disjunction'' to break the ''Mordenkainen's arcane seal'', reminding him of his knack for making magic work at the last moment. Simon gave them all ''[[sending stones]]'' with which to communicate.\n\nEdgin, Holga, and Simon sneaked into Castle Never by distracting the guards with Simon's ''[[major image]]'' of Edgin singing and playing songs. It proved more of a distraction when Simon got his foot stuck in a pothole, lost concentration, and it distorted horribly. Discovering the [[illusion]], the guards gave chase, but the thieves got inside and pulled down the portcullis. Inside now, the party split up, with Holga and Simon going to the vault and Edgin searching for Kira. While Holga held off the guards, Simon reached the vault, but a group of guards intercepted him there. In desperation, Simon donned the ''helmet of disjunction'' and was again confronted by the image of Elminster, who called him a fool and a stain on the family name. Angry, Simon lashed out, punched the old mage, and saw him revealed as Simon himselfâ€”it wasn't Elminster, but Simon's own insecurity holding him back. This time, he successfully used the ''helmet of disjunction'', bowling over the guards, opening the vault, dropping ''[[driftglobes]]'' and obliterating magic across a swath of the city, as well as making him feel better about himself. Holga caught up to Simon at the opened vault, but they found it emptyâ€”Forge had stolen all its treasure. A magical trap caught them in an ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'' spell. With the whole team captured, Edgin pleaded for a fighting chance, that is, to compete in the High Sun Games.",
            "High Sun Games": "In the High Sun Games, the companions were pitted against four other adventuring groups and tasked with navigating a deadly labyrinth with a [[displacer beast]], [[mimic]]s, and [[gelatinous cube]]s, among other perils. Worse, Simon was stuck wearing a ''[[magic-suppression cuff]]'' that prevented his spellcasting entirely. Though they did not fare well at first, they reached the center of the maze and safety, but Edgin realized there was still no escape from the maze or the contest. Fortunately, Doric proposed another, very risky way outâ€”they had to leap into one of the gelatinous cubes as it descended, just as a displacer beast pounced, to get to their end goal: the dungeons beneath the Neverwinter arena. Doric turned into a [[snake]], slithered out, and freed her companions.\n\nAt the city's docks, Simon and his friends seized the treasure ship from the guards, ambushed Forge Fitzwilliam, brought Kira back into Edgin's care, and prevented the Lord of Neverwinter from fleeing his own city aboard a boat with the accumulated wealth of the city and the Games' spectators. Simon cast ''control water'' to create a big wave to aid their escape aboard the ship, incidentally washing over the docks and Forge. While the group at first sought to sail away and claim the riches for themselves, the sight of Sofina invoking the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'' over the arena quickly changed their minds.\n\nUsing a [[hot-air balloon]] with Forge's likeness, along with the ''hither-thither staff'', Simon and his companions were able to redistribute the exâ€“Lord of Neverwinter's ill-gotten riches to the city's people, leading them out of the arena and wasting Sofina's horrific spell. Enraged, Sofina assaulted them in a final battle in the city streets. The fighting was furious. Simon's ''shield'' blocked Sofina's ''[[meteor swarm]]'' from obliterating the group, and they battled an [[Animated object|animated]] statue of a juvenile [[gold dragon]]. Protecting Doric while she recovered, Simon engaged in a hand-to-hand spell duel with the Red Wizardâ€”literally so, with his ''[[Maximilian's earthen grasp]]'' grappling with Sofina's ''[[Bigby's hand]]''â€”before ultimately faltering himself. Finally, all four companions fought the Red Wizard together. Sofina cast a ''[[time stop]]'' spell, presumably gaining the upper hand. In fact, this time Simon managed to ''[[counterspell]]'' the casting, before he and the others pretended they were stopped in time. Using her ''[[pendant of invisibility]]'', Kira managed to negate Sofina's spellcasting abilities with a ''magic-suppression cuff'' from the games, and Doric wild shaped and put the defenseless Red Wizard down for good.",
            "Saviors of Neverwinter": "With the negation of Sofina's magic, the former Lord of Neverwinter, [[Dagult Neverember]] awoke and resumed his reign. His first acts were to award the saviors of Neverwinter medals of heroism.\n\nSimon and his friends returned to Doric's village in the Neverwinter Wood to celebrate their victory. At the Emerald Tavern, Simon asked for another shot at courtship with Doric, and this time she agreed, provided he \"calm down\" a bit."
