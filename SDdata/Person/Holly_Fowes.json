        "mainbody": "'''Holly Fowes''' was an investigative journalist who wrote for the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] [[broadsheet]]'' from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|There's a sickness in our city, dear reader. It nibbles on the council's ear in private audience chambers, it clangs around our streets in steel automatons - and it whispers sweet nothings from the pages of this very broadsheet. The fetid presence of Lord Enver Gortash is rotting our city in its very core, and this reporter is personally ashamed to work for a publication - no, propaganda vehicle - that allows the infection to spread.|Holly Fowes, Investigative Journalist, Newly Freelance}}",
        "History": "Holly Fowes had been working at the ''Baldur's Mouth Gazette'' until the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. She realized that the broadsheet's new sponsor, Lord [[Enver Gortash]], was in control of the information being dispensed by [[Ettvard Needle]]'s publication. In one of her articles to be published, Holly wrote a scathing opinion on Lord Gortash and the rot at the core of Baldur's Gate he represented. She fully understood that penning the article meant losing her job, and she signed the manuscript as a \"Newly Freelance\" journalist and for Ettvard to consider it a letter of resignation. The editor-in-chief, Ettvard Needle, immediately discharged Holly, citing her work to be libelous behavior, conspiracy, and intimidation, and herself to be \"a toxic, unjournalistic presence in the workplace.\" Ettvard did not accept her resignation and instead fired Holly without pay and threatened her future work with legal action."
