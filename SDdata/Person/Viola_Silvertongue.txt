==Description==
Viola was a colorful [[human]] woman with fair skin and light pink hair. She wore red metallic cosmetics and was armed with a [[rapier]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Circus of the Last Days returned from the [[Feywild]] and opened its gates to the inhabitants of the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] district in [[Baldur's Gate]]. Viola Silvertongue entertained guests by performing alongside [[Calliope Blingsdorf]], who believed her be a true wonder. Viola was present at the circus when it was revealed that the [[Cult of the Absolute]] murdered one of the troupe â€“ the clown called [[Dribbles]], and replaced him with a murderous [[doppelganger]].
