        "mainbody": "Rezim was the vizier of Mulhorand in 1357 DR.\nRezim was a member of the House of Helcaliant and one of the most powerful men of Mulhorand.\nIn 1357 DR, Rezim proposed to directly sell slaves to the nobles instead of leasing them from the temples. He argued that without the temples intervention slavery would become more efficient but critics said it was a political action to please the landowners that had placed him in power. Pharaoh Horustep III disagreed with Rezim and his influence started to decline.\nRezim was well known for his cunning and his ruthlessness. However, he valued loyalty to him above all. His latest proposal bordered megalomania.\nRezim was the uncle of Horustep III."
