        "mainbody": "'''Rezim''' was the vizier of [[Mulhorand]] in [[1357 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Rezim was a member of the [[House of Helcaliant]] and one of the most powerful men of Mulhorand.",
        "History": "In 1357 DR, Rezim proposed to directly sell slaves to the nobles instead of leasing them from the temples. He argued that without the temples' intervention slavery would become more efficient but critics said it was a political action to please the landowners that had placed him in power. [[Pharaoh]] [[Horustep III]] disagreed with Rezim and his influence started to decline.",
        "Personality": "Rezim was well known for his cunning and his ruthlessness. However, he valued loyalty to him above all. His latest proposal bordered megalomania.",
        "Relationship": "Rezim was the uncle of Horustep III."
