        "mainbody": "'''Myrmeen Lhal''' was the Lady Lord of the [[Cormyrean]] city of [[Arabel]], a skilled [[ranger]], and revered member of the [[Moonstars]] that lived during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "She was a tall and beautiful woman that had long, elegant brunette hair and deep blue eyes that were highlighted with gold. Her face also boasted full lips and very well-defined cheekbones. She maintained a youthful appearance and statuesque figure well into her forties. Her body was covered in old scars, most notably a large number of whip scars on her back.<ref name=\"CotH-p57>\n\nMyrmeen lost her left arm in battle while fighting in the [[Goblin War]], but later had a replacement made by [[magic]]al means.",
        "Personality": "For many years, the young Myrmeen dedicated her life to the pursuit of love to make up for the lack of it that her life had held for her thus far.\n\nMyrmeen was fair-minded as a ruler and forthright in all aspects of her life, though in both she had something of a short temper. Myrmeen expected nothing less than complete honesty from her subordinates and every other resident of Arabel.\n\nIn her mid-thirties, after she adopted her daughter, she started working on herself, studying philosophy, better managing her temper and becoming more merciful and less aggressive.<ref name=\"CotH-p57 />",
        "Abilities": "Thanks to her years adventuring across the Realms, Myrmeen was a skilled combatant that fought with a ferocity found in most [[demon]]s.\n\nShe was also [[ambidextrous]] and was known on occasion to wield and fire a [[crossbow]] simultaneously in each hand.",
        "Possessions": "During her tenure as ruler of Arabel, Myrmeen carried with her a ''+5 [[longsword of sharpness]]'', and wore both her [[Harper pin]] as well as a [[magic]]al amulet that allowed another person to assume her appearance and voice.\n\nAt court, she was rarely seen without a silver headdress, made into the shape of a phoenix. She also typically wore a set of ceremonial armor made of a steel mesh, and studded with red gemstones.\n\nAn appreciator of fine art, Myrmeen acquired the sculpture entitled ''[[The Descent of the Shadow Army]]'' carved by the stone giant artist [[Aris (giant)|Aris]].",
        "Relationships": "Myrmeen was married twice in her life, first to a man named [[Dak]] in [[Calimshan]], and later to [[Haverstrom Lhal]], cousin to King [[Azoun IV]] of [[Cormyr]]. [[Krystin]], her adopted [[Calishite]] daughter;{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|47-48}}\n\nThe Lady Lord was served by [[Evon Stralana]], Arabel's minister of defense.\n\nHer former traveling companion [[Elyn]] remained a good friend throughout her years as a ruler, often aiding her when she continued embarking on adventurers incognito.",
        "History": {
            "Knightsbridge Conspiracy": "Some time before the [[Time of Troubles]], Myrmeen Lhal hired on the pair of outsider mercenaries, [[Cyric]] and [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]], along with the [[Sunite]] cleric [[Adon]], to root out a traitor to the Cormyrean crown in Arabel, one that threatened to destabilize the kingdom's economy. While the men were able to identify one [[Ronglath Knightsbridge]] of [[Zhentil Keep]], their actions allowed him to leave the city, implicating them as traitors. This plot led to a wave of fear that washed over her city in what came to be known as the as the \"Knightsbridge Conspiracy.\"\n\nShe later hired the adventuring group known as the [[Company of Dawn]] to hunt down the three mercenaries after they managed to pass through Arabel without detection.",
            "The Night Parade": "One day, Myrmeen's ex-husband Dak appeared in Arabel and was arrested for murder. When Myrmeen appeared as the one who would judge him for his crime, he revealed that their baby had not died; he had sold her to someone. He had hoped that she would grant him mercy in exchange for this news,{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|28-29}} but she killed him on the spot in anger and organized a group of Harpers to find her daughter. They discovered that the [[Night Parade]] were the cause of Myrmeen's nightmares. Around six thousand monsters lived with barely any secrecy in Calimport thanks to one member with incredible hypnotic powers. After coming close to death several times, she found a girl who she believed to be her daughter, and together with one of the monsters (who turned out to be her \"stillborn\" sister) they managed to kill the hypnotic member of the Parade. Once it was dead, the citizens of Calimport rioted, eliminating the majority of the creatures in the city.\n\nMyrmeen managed to find her real daughter but upon discovering the wonderful life she led, she decided that she would not let her know her heritage and instead adopted the girl she had previously thought was her daughter, Krystin.<ref>",
            "Returning to Cormyr": "The [[Goblin War]] that broke out in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, changed Myrmeen's new, happy life with her daughter. It quickly became apparent that Arabel could not be held and the city's populace was magically transported to [[Suzail]]. Arabel became a goblin city for a time but Myrmeen vowed she would retake it.\n\nMyrmeen formed an army of rangers, scouts and mercenaries and forced the monsters out of Arabel. Unfortunately the humanoids fled into the forests where they became much more difficult to dislodge.\n\nIn [[Mirtul]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Myrmeen hosted an informal meeting at her palace in Arabel between Princess Alusair and [[Rivalen Tanthul]] of [[Thultanthar]]. The Steel Regent and representative of the [[Shadovar]] discussed the potential arrest and incarceration of the fugitives of Thultanthar, [[Galaeron Nihmedu]] and Aris of [[Thousand Faces]].\n\nShe defected from the Harpers to become one of the leading members of [[Khelben Arunsun]]'s [[Moonstars]]<ref><ref> but otherwise ruled Arabel with the same benevolence that earned her her popularity in the first place.<ref>{{cite book/Cormyr|17}}",
            "Retirement": "Around the {{YearlinkName|1379}}, about seven years after she had her son, Myrmeen decided to move her household to Suzail to be closer to Krystin and her granddaughter. She did so at first without leave from the Crown, placing her herald [[Westar]] in charge of Arabel until a replacement lord could be found. While she would not take official action without permission, the Lady Lord wished to truly retire from the life of rule."
