'''Bunt Chugley''' was a common folk visitor to [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Bunt was a dark-skinned [[human]] man with brown eyes, He wore a cloth hat and a simple brown [[tunic]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, an army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in the [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. It was during this refugee crisis that Bunt Chugley was visiting the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate. Bunt's business trip to the metropolis left him overwhelmed and he could often be seen walking down the streets of the Lower City whilst mumbling to himself reminders not to make eye contacts and not to engage with the locals. During his time in Baldur's Gate, Bunt was a guest of [[Nortale's Hostel]].
