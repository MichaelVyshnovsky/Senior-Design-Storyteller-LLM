In the , an army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in the Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldurs Gate, displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. It was during this refugee crisis that Bunt Chugley was visiting the Lower City of Baldurs Gate. Bunts business trip to the metropolis left him overwhelmed and he could often be seen walking down the streets of the Lower City whilst mumbling to himself reminders not to make eye contacts and not to engage with the locals. During his time in Baldurs Gate, Bunt was a guest of Nortales Hostel.
