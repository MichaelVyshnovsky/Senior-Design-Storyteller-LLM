The Khelbenite was the name given to the hero who, under the orders of Khelben Arunsun, stopped the drow plot against Waterdeep in 1370 DR.
Not much was known of the Khelbenites life prior to the events that made him a hero. He was from an unremarkable family from Waterdeep, where his mother often shopped for fruit in the splendorous markets.
In Eleint 1370 DR, he was summoned by Khelben Arunsun on the behest of the Lords of Waterdeep. The Lords of the city were worried by a recent drastic increase in kobold activities and thefts across the streets of Waterdeep. Khelben determined that something or someone was driving the creatures away from their habitats deep in Undermountain and forcing them to venture out into the city streets. The Lords increased the presence of the City Watch and tasked the hero with stopping the kobolds from growing bold and harming the City of Splendors. Khelben gave the hero two gold coins to pay for his entrance and exit from Undermountain through the Yawning Portal and sent him on his way.
The golden scarab from Mulhorand.
The hero descended into the Tomb of Ankh-Kephra and survived the traps hidden within, retrieving the missing item. Upon the next conversation with Khelben Arunsun, the Blackstaff informed the adventurer that something was amiss and sent the hero back into the depths of Undermountain with a vague request to find more clues on the deviant plot against Waterdeep and maybe more pieces of the spider-shaped artifact. The search led to the old dwarven prison complex within the dungeon, overtaken by a marauding tribe of humanoids, led by an orc of demonic blood, Horazak. Following the mining tunnels underneath the prison, the Khelbenite, as the lone hero was now known, found a way into an abandoned dwarven temple that held the second piece of the drow spider statue.
Khelben Arunsun was researching the significance of the mysterious spider pieces he sent his trusted adventurer to retrieve the Black Wand of Myrkul. This task was part of the Blackstaffs personal vendetta against the dead deity. The wand was created to encase a piece of Myrkuls divinity, and Khelben could not wait for a chance to destroy another piece of the god of death. Once the hero uncovered the well-hidden artifact, Khelben had more dire news that needed investigating. The dwarves of Clangeddins Hearth, who were attempting to reclaim ancient temples within Undermountain, faced numerous undead that was somehow tied to all the recent goings-on underneath Waterdeep.
The fabled Flame Sword of Lolth.
The plan of the drow became clear. They had found the fabled Flame Sword of Lolth that the deity herself wielded during the War of the Seldarine. The swords fierce magics could tear open the planes, opening portals and sowing destruction. The stone spider was the artifact that worked together with the sword, focusing its destructive powers, and at the time, the broken statue was also the key to releasing the sword from its prison. The elven gods hid the sword after the war. The shattered artifact and its pieces were hidden throughout Undermountain by Halaster Blackcloak himself.

The priestess of Lolth that had caused much trouble before, Matron Azurna, was led to discover the vault and search for the spider pieces by Lolth. The hero held all the statue shards and took them into the Flame Swords vault. As the spider statue was assembled, the Spider Goddess gained access to the Prime Material plane via the swords divine powers. Here, as an avatar, she assumed the form of a huge female drider. A fierce battle ensued, but the avatar was defeated. The hero destroyed the stone spider, banishing the avatar and making the Flame Sword disappear in an explosion of arcane magics. Waterdeep was safe once again, with the remains of Azurnas alliance destroyed or dispersed.
