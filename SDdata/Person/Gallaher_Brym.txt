'''Gallaher Brym''' was a scribe refugee from the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] neighborhood of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the armies of the [[Absolute]] ravaged the [[Western Heartlands]], scribe Gallaher Brym and his family were among countless refugees seeking entrance to Baldur's Gate. The family was not allowed passage through the [[Wyrm's Crossing]], forcing them to remain in Rivington's refugee tent city. Desperate for admission into the closed-off city, Gallaher penned a letter, sent via the [[Sword Coast Couriers]], addressed to Lord [[Patriar]] [[Haverford Gist]]. The scribe offered his professional services for a mere nominal fee and eternal gratitude if Haverford, renowned for his charitability, would send to word to the [[Flaming Fist]]s to allow the family enter the city. It was unknown whether Lord Gist responded to the request or even if the letter was ever delivered.
