'''Hornsryl Wavegallant''' was a noblewoman in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Hornsryl Wavegallant was one of the guests of Lady [[Joysil Ambrur]] in the mid-to-late spring of {{yearlink|1373}}. She was one of her guests, making snide comments regarding the [[Obarskyr]] ruling family of [[Cormyr]] as part of the conversation; she became impatient when [[Honthreena Ravensgar]] implied [[Azoun Obarskyr V]] was likely to die, and quickly asked for details on any conspiracies she may be aware of.
