        "mainbody": "'''Araluen''', '''Ash''', the '''Child of Light''', the '''Horned Aspect''' and '''The Step-daughter of Talona''' were fragments of a divine being sent by [[Lurue]] to the [[Great Dale]] in {{yearlink|1368}} to bolster the forces fighting the [[Rotting Man]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|122-123|13}} After the latter captured most of his essence, he twisted it into the Step-Daughter of Talona; the remainder of her hope formed a small baby, capable of speaking only the word 'Ash'.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|1-2|Prologue}} Both aspects were reunited in {{yearlink|1373}}, reforming a complete Araluen who drove the Rotting Man off of Dun-Tharos.",
        "Description": "As Ash, she resembled (and for many purposes was) a frail five-year old in peasant clothes.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|30|4}} Her hair was baby brown as a baby,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|4|1}} and her eyes were sky blue.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|6|1}}\n\nAs the Step-Daughter of Talona, she was a foul, vile abomination the size of a barn, all festering flesh on four elephantine legs, with a single fifteen-foot long spiraling horn. It had no other features beyond the horn. It screamed in basso from an unseen mouth.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|288-289|30}}Though never described as a [[rotvine defiler]], she is written by the same author of the corresponding book, her abilities in that form seem to roughly match the rotvine defiler's, and her origin story matches that of a rotvine defiler. This article thus assumes the Step-Daughter of Talona is a rotvine defiler, or more precisely, that the rotvine defiler is written to mirror the Step-Daughter of Talona.\n\nAs Araluen restored, she was a shifting shape, both a woman and a white-gold unicorn with a crystal horn.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|297|30}}",
        "Personality": "As Ash she was pure of spirit but extremely simple-minded, unable to comprehend so much as betrayal. Even in the moments she was in the most contact with her divine nature, she could scarcely form a sentence.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|30|4}}\n\nAs the Step-daughter of Talona, she was under the complete control of the Rotting Man, though at her core, she was still a creature of the green powers.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|293-294|30}}\n\nAs Araluen, she sought only to defeat the Rotting Man and preserve the forests of the Great Dale. She still had a place in her heart for [[Marrec]] and his party, as well as the farmer Hemish.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|301-303|31}}",
        "Abilities": "Ash possessed healing hands capable of restoring health, vigor and strength to many creatures: not a month after birth, she reversed years of mistreatment on a horse,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|5-6|1}} and through the next years she healed several aches in her community.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|23|3}} When she joined up with Marrec's party, they found her healing touch to be capable of reversing damage, though she seemed to distribute it randomly, sometimes ignoring dying people in front of her. Her touch was also capable of reducing vampires to nothingness, just like sunlight could, and she disintegrated an [[uthraki]] spy for [[Gameliel]] with it too.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|72|8}} When she was most in touch with her divine nature, she could grant redemption in the name of [[Lurue]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|282-291|30}}\n\nThe step-daughter of Talona was possessed of physical strength matching her size, and of frightful regeneration. Her very presence sucked away the light of [[Lurue]] from the world, weakening the clerical abilities of priests like [[Marrec]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|122-123|13}} She was also capable of devouring the other sliver of her power, Ash; however, recovering the last of her light proved, alongside Marrec's encouragement, sufficient for her to self-destruct and immediately be reborn as Araluen.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|295|30}}\n\nThe fully restored Araluen had recovered her divine light enough to battle the Rotting Man and make him flee [[Dun-Tharos]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|298-301|31}}",
        "Possessions": "A pony named Henri was procured for Ash in [[Culdorn]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|45|5}} The [[Nentyarch]] gifted her with a magical leather bridle, chased with green thread, that allowed the horse to always find its way back to safety, to [[Yeshelmaar]], and to never lose its way.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|129|13}} The fully restored Araluen carried a blade of celestial fire.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|298|31}}",
        "Activities": "Until {{yearlink|1373}}, both Ash and the Step-Daughter of Talona remained in their place of birth: Ash remained in [[Fullpoint]] with her adoptive father, Hemish,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|18|2}} while the Step-Daughter remained encysted in the [[Thieving Ash]] at Dun-Tharos.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|288-291|30}}Albeit the Thieving Ash was in [[Dun-Tharos]] as of 1373, the forces of Talona had not occupied the Close until 1371. Given the light was captured in 1368, there are either multiple Thieving Ashes or the tree was moved after the capture.",
        "Relationships": "Ash loved her adoptive father, [[Hemish]], and she was totally taken in with her pony, [[Henri]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|45|5}} Though her feelings towards the traitor [[Fallon]] were unclear, she redeemed him for his betrayal; the Step-Daughter of Talona seemed to have no strong feelings other than her obedience to the Rotting Man. After the synthesis of both aspects restored Araluen, she kept Ash's feelings rather than the Step-Daughter's.",
        "History": "After the Rotting Man began his activities in the [[Rawlinswood]] on {{yearlink|1362}}, the Green Powers promised a Child of Light that would join the fight of the [[Circle of Leth]] against him, contesting the power of the champion of Talona.\n\nIn {{yearlink|1368}}, the Green Powers sent a light into Faer√ªn, full of promise, joy and hope; the Rotting Man set a trap, diverting and stealing that light,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|4-6|1}}\n\nAsh remained in Fullpoint until 1373, when the [[blightspawned]] [[volodni]] sent by [[Gameliel]] attacked the village. She was briefly taken by volodni who sought her as the Horned Aspect{{cite book/Lady of Poison|28|4}}, but the combined efforts of the [[Nentyar hunter]] [[Elowen]], [[cleric]] [[Marrec]] and [[Gunggari Ulmarra]] broke the volodni forces.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|35-37|4}} along the way, a pony named Henri was procured for her.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|133|14}}\n\nWhile in the tunnels beneath Dun-Tharos, the Rotting Man attempted to destroy Fallon's personality by planting a compulsion that would hollow him out into a servant; Ash broke his curse, giving him an opportunity to turn against the Rotting Man, which he took eagerly.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|203-205|20}} However, the two of them were captured later by the blightlord [[Damanda]]; Ash destroyed one of her vampires in the process.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|244-246|26}} Marrec's party finally rescued Ash from her, but Fallon was mortally wounded during the fight.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|258-259|27}} Ash granted him redemption in his last moments.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|262|28}}\n\nOn [[Mirtul 7]],{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|154}} once they reached the Rotting Man, she blocked several of his spells during the ensuing fight,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|287-288|30}} Thanks to Marrec's words, however, she was able to recover her full personality, and emerged from the Step-Daughter's flesh in her full power, or at least, in full control of herself.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|295-297|30}} She then battled the Rotting Man, ultimately making him flee The Close.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|303|31}}"
