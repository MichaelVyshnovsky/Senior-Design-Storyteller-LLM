'''Saldee''' was a sailor aboard the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

==Description==
Saldee was a strong [[human]] woman with short-trimmed hair. She was aiming for a Captain's position and venerated both the Bitch Queen [[Umberlee]] and the Lady of Misfortune [[Beshaba]]. Saldee had a focused demeanor, strict personality, and she disliked jokes and levity.

==History==
Saldee was part of the ''Vigilant's'' crew in the {{Yearlink|1374}} when Captain [[Lastri Kassireh]]'s ship sailed from the [[Sword Coast]] to the nation of [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. Onboard the ship were several passengers, including [[Volothamp Geddarm]] who traveled to meet with a wealthy [[yuan-ti]] merchant, [[Sa'Sani]]. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled; freshwater [[barrel]]s ruptured; one of the crew, a sailor, got drunk and drowned; Volo almost got poisoned as his poison soup took the life of [[Joquin]]; and a fellow sailor [[Rienur]] noticed new [[rope]]s becoming strangely frayed.

The string of suspicious occurrences â€“ yuan-ti sabotage, culminated in a deadly storm. The ''Vigilant's'' shipwreck was washed ashore not far from the city of [[Samargol]]. Most sailors perished in the storm, while others were captured to be devoured by the local cannibalistic [[Batiri]] [[goblin]]s. Saldee was in a group of survivors of the crash that included Volo and a handful of passengers who had to defend themselves from hungry Batiri. Eventually, the survivors were placed under arrest by xenophobic Samarachan Elite Guard and taken to Samargol.
