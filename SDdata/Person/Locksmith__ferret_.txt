Locksmith was a ferret who lived in Marigolds Menagerie in the mid-14 century DR.
Locksmiths derived from the fact that he quite frequently manage to undo the lock of his cage, to the point that he spend more time outside of it than in. However, the agile ferret also took great pleasure in opening the cages of other animals in the room he inhabited.
The Menageries owner, Marigold Mufflefoot, found it difficult to find a lock that Locksmith couldnt undo and because of him always had to check that the creatures were in their cages before letting in any visitors. Despite Locksmiths troublesome behavior, Marigold continued to provide his pen with everything a ferret could desire to play with.
One day while Marigold was out to lunch Locksmith opened most of the cages, leading the animals to scatter. When Marigold came home he found these opened cages to be empty and with little ferret tracks leading from one to the next. He quickly sought the aid of some adventurers to help him round up the missing animals.
