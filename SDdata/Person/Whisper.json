        "mainbody": "'''Whisper''' was a cruel and calculating [[evoker]] of great ambition during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Working as an agent of the [[Zhentarim]] in northern [[Cormyr]], he spied on trade routes and troop movements, organizing raids and ambushes. His personal wizard rune was a black, stylized human hand forming a claw.",
        "Activities": "Whisper's ambition was to rise in the ranks of the Zhentarim and also head up his own secret society. To that end, he gathered agents and organized strongholds that were under his exclusive control.\n\nWhisper's base was known as [[Whisper's Crypt]], a subterranean lair located beneath the [[Haunted Halls]] just north of [[Eveningstar]].",
        "History": "When one of his raids targeted a group of visiting adventurers led by [[Doust Sulwood]], the attackers were defeated but Whisper escaped. Doust and his companions learned of Whisper and decided to hunt him down. The adventurers were able to break the enchantments surrounding his headquarters, overcome the guardian creatures, and ultimately kill Whisper in his underground home.\n\nWithin Whisper's crypt the adventurers found two of the ''[[Seven Lost Rings of Mhzentul]]. These were gifted to temples in the area by Doust and his companions."
