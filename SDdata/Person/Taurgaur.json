        "Personality": "Taurgaur was very elderly by dwarven standards but still inquisitive, with a quick wit and a companionable good nature. Learning new things was the joy of his life.",
        "Activities": "He rarely went out in public, but instead invited people to come see him. He had a network of spies poking around [[Lantan]] so he could be informed of new inventions from the [[Gond]]ar there. He occasionally sponsored adventuring groups to explore all corners of [[Faerûn]] and bring back news, show their trophies, and tell the tales of their exploits well into the night. He let them keep whatever treasure they found, he just wanted to hear the truthful details of their travels and encounters."
