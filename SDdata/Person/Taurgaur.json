        "mainbody": "aurgaur was the owner of Taurgaurs Tarjteir, an inn located in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nTaurgaur was very elderly by dwarven standards but still inquisitive, with a quick wit and a companionable good nature. Learning new things was the joy of his life.\nHe rarely went out in public, but instead invited people to come see him. He had a network of spies poking around Lantan so he could be informed of new inventions from the Gondar there. He occasionally sponsored adventuring groups to explore all corners of Faerûn and bring back news, show their trophies, and tell the tales of their exploits well into the night. He let them keep whatever treasure they found, he just wanted to hear the truthful details of their travels and encounters."
