Parman was a merchant in Bawa in 1357 DR.
Parman was a member the Ardjo family, one of the richest merchant families of Bawa. Not truly needing to work, Parman spent most of his time in efforts he thought could improve the nation. He acted as advisor to the king, often even when uninvited, encouraging trading and destroying the pirates of Panjardu. Parman also sponsored many adventuring parties in exploring the wilderness. He was suspicious of all Bertanese people, particularly Bimaru.
In 1357 DR, he started focusing on the Bawani Mountains.
