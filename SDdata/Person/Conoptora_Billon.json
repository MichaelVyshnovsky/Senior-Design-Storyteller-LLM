By 1367 DR, he had been chosen by the Council for the position of the Vens Voice, serving as spokesman and adviser for the Ven, the secret ruler of the city.\nHe was ambitious and planned for Tsurlagol to move out from under its ally Procampurs shadow and develop on its own to rival and overtake the other cities of the Vast. In particular, he wanted Tsurlagol to beat Ravens Bluff at attracting traders, adventurers, and other sources of wealth. It was unknown if the Ven shared these plans.\nConoptora still held the position in 1370 DR.\nConoptora was acquisitive and adventurous.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryMembers of the Council\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Tsurlagol\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vast\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryCouncilors\n14zmh2tsxydqarthn08ycgv2p2sqq6u"
