By [[1367 DR]], he had been chosen by the Council for the position of the [[Ven's Voice]], serving as spokesman and adviser for the [[Ven]], the secret ruler of the city.\n\nHe was ambitious and planned for Tsurlagol to move out from under its ally [[Procampur]]'s shadow and develop on its own to rival and overtake the other cities of the Vast. In particular, he wanted Tsurlagol to beat [[Ravens Bluff]] at attracting traders, [[adventurer]]s, and other sources of wealth. It was unknown if the Ven shared these plans.\n\nConoptora still held the position in [[1370 DR]].",
