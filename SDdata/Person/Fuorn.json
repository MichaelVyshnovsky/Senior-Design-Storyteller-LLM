        "History": "Centuries before the [[Era of Upheaval]], Fuorn recovered the ''[[staff of the Shard]]'' from the [[Marsh of Chelimber]] and safeguarded it on behalf of the goddess [[Selûne]].\n\nFuorn and his fellow treants met the [[Prince of Shade]] [[Melegaunt Tanthul]], along with his companions [[Galaeron Nihmedu]] and [[Vala Thorsdotter]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. He accepted from Melegaunt a ''[[shadowstorm seed]]'', an acorn-like item that could whirl combatting foes away into the [[Shadowfell]] or create a sudden downpour of cold dark rain."
