        "mainbody": "'''Trifakas''' was a [[wizard]] in a quest for [[Martek]]'s sphere of power. He became stuck in the [[Garden of the Cursed]] together with [[Sardok]] and [[Pawnis]], the only other survivors of his band, until other adventurers arrived.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|110}}",
        "Abilities": "Trifakas had top-notch intellect, outstanding agility, and a fairly good charisma, though he was quite scrawny. His spellbook included a number of spells, including ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[jump]]'', ''[[write]]'', ''[[darkness|darkness, {{SI|15|foot}} radius]]'', ''[[forget]]'', ''[[web]]'', ''[[wizard lock]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[slow]]'', ''[[fumble]]'', ''[[polymorph other]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', ''[[feeblemind]]'', ''[[magic jar]]'', ''[[passwall]]'', ''[[teleport]]'' and ''[[legend lore]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Trifakas was not interested in working with anyone else beyond his immediate crew, and would use guile and subterfuge with anyone else. He was very interested in learning as much as he could from other arrivals, but he took pains to conceal this interest. In particular, he wanted to have the Star Gems used under his supervision if possible, or stolen if not; he was willing to join others only as a last resort.\n\nThe paladin [[Percivilis]] knew of him.",
        "History": "Trifakas had arrived together with Pawnis and Sardok about one week before the adventurers who ultimately resurrected [[Martek]] did. The two thieves were the last of Trifakas' band. The three discovered they were trapped soon after entering;{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|108}} Trifakas decided to live in a hut with Sardok, away from the Guilders.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|116}} When new adventurers came bearing every [[Star gem of Martek]], he had both thieves investigate these new arrivals,{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|109}} along with the local villagemaster [[Bandik]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|115}}\n\nHe may have personally spoken with those adventurers. If so, he wanted to know if they had any large gems, telling them that to his knowledge, that was the only way out of the garden. He may have sent Sardok to filch all the Star Gems of Martek from the adventurers and used them to open the doors of Grandal himself.\n\nIf Trifakas' band managed to acquire the Star Gems, they may have proceeded with the trials of Martek.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|111}} In such a case, they may have been found dead by the entrance of Martek's treasury.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|126}}"
