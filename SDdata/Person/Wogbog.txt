'''Wogbog''' was a friendly and simple-minded hermit who lived out of a tent in the [[Blade Cliffs]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
The strange hermit was dressed in dirty rags. Wogbog had a toothless mouth and emaciated chest. His stringy hair was dirt-speckled with pieces of dead leaves stuck in it. He mumbled "wogbog" to himself.

==History==
Little was known of Wogbog's past. His speech was simplistic, and he seemingly was not able to communicate in anything but select short words. By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, his tent could be found among the trees and grape bushes of the Blade Cliffs. He sustained himself on bugsâ€”his favorite food. However, the [[lice]] that covered his body were a delicious treat too. During the events recounted in ''[[Darkness over Daggerford (book)|Darkness over Daggerford]]'', Wogbog spied on [[orc]]s and smuggling pirate ships that sailed past the Blade Cliffs towards the secret base within the [[Crab's Claw Coast]]. Surprisingly, Wogbog found a way into the ancient tomb of the [[lich]] [[Umgatlik]], but despite being oblivious to the dangers within, the hermit remained unmolested by the ancient evil.
