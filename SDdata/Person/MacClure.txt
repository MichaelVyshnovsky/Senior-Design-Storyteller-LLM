MacClure was a gnome thief inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
MacClure excelled at comprehending languages and his sense of hearing was finely tuned. He wished to sign on with a local adventuring company but not venture too far from Daggerford.
