'''Nisstyre''' was a [[drow]] [[wizard]] and leader of the merchant band [[Dragon's Hoard]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Nisstyre was thin, with a sharp-featured face, elegantly pointed ears, and a mane of unusual copper-colored hair that he normally put up in a ponytail.

==Possessions==
He carried no weapons, having the ability to use magic instead.

==Personalty==
Nisstyre was very cunning and shrewd, which was a necessity for being the male leader of an independent group in drow society.

==Relations==
Nisstyre had many contacts on the surface, where he was known as 'the Fox'.

==History==
Nisstyre was originally from [[Ched Nasad]], where he was trained as a wizard. He disliked having to serve the matriarchy of his homeland, and in his explorations he found the worship of the drow [[god]] of rogues, [[Vhaeraun]]. He left and formed his own independent merchants' group secretly devoted to the glory of Vhaeraun and the expansion of drow settlement on the surface.

In the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, Nisstyre's band went to [[Rashemen]] to obtain magical artifacts from the [[Red Wizard]] [[Merdrith]]. They ran into [[Fyodor]], who had stolen the [[Windwalker (artifact)|Windwalker]] amulet, which had been in Merdrith's possession. Nisstyre took the Windwalker from him and attempted to bring it back to [[Menzoberranzan]], but his party was attacked and killed by [[deep bat]]s and the Windwalker was lost. Nisstyre soon learned that [[Liriel Baenre]] had found the Windwalker, so he attempted to retrieve it with the help of [[Shakti Hunzrin]], who placed a ruby [[scrying]] gem into his forehead to further communication. In the end, Nisstyre was not able to capture Liriel; rather, she was able to assist the followers of [[Eilistraee]] from the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]] in assaulting and effectively destroying the Dragon's Hoard base in [[Skullport]].

==Relationships==
Nisstyre was acquainted with [[Kharza-kzad Xorlarrin]], to whom he provided [[spellbook]]s and forbidden books from the surface. He was also the one who attacked Kharza-kzad, prompting the latter to use a [[wand of lichdom]] to turn himself into a [[lich]] to escape.

Nisstyre's son was [[Gorlist]], who apparently inherited leadership of the remnants of Dragon's Hoard.

==Known Spells==
Among the [[spell]]s he was capable of were ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[reveal magic]]'', and ''[[frostbind]]''.
