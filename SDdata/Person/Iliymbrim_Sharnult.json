        "mainbody": "'''Illiymbrim Sharnult''' was a mage at some point before the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|761}}, the sage [[Beldrune]], working at the [[Moonshorn Tower]], opined about a certain [[Olbert]]'s ''[[triple-delayed blast fireball]]'' spell. Beldrune noted that Olbert had created that spell by combining the work of Illiymbrim Sharnult, [[Lhabbartan]], and a third person whose name he could not recall at the moment. This strongly implied that Illiymbrim Sharnult predated Olbert."
