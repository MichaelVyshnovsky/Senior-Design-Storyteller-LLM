The Calavarr was a powerful wizard who once ruled the city of Tulmon in the Land of the Lions region of south Faer√ªn.
The Calavarr used his sorcerous might to cow those he ruled.
Tulmon thrived under the Calavarrs rule, establishing itself as a center of power along the Lake of Steam. He developed and altered a deepspawn called the Anglatha which created its own offspring in the form of small beholders which were also under the Calavarrs control.
