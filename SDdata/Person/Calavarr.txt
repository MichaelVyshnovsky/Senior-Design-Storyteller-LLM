The '''Calavarr''' was a powerful [[wizard]] who once ruled the city of [[Tulmon]] in the [[Land of the Lions]] region of [[south Faer√ªn]].

==Personality==
The Calavarr used his sorcerous might to cow those he ruled.

==Activities==
Tulmon thrived under the Calavarr's rule, establishing itself as a center of power along the [[Lake of Steam]]. He developed and altered a [[deepspawn]] called the [[Anglatha]] which created its own offspring in the form of small [[beholder]]s which were also under the Calavarr's control.
