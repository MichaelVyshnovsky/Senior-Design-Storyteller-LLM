'''Deirdre Gallaway''' was running the [[Gallaway Trade Depot]] in [[Targos]], in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Her drunkard of a Grand-Da, that old wheezing fool Ilmus, sent her to Targos to prove herself to the rest of the Gallaway Coster. When the goblins struck Targos, it ruined her chances of turning profit - and ruined her name with it. Ye can almost hear the storm clouds building in her head.''|[[Firtha Kerdos]]}}

==Description==
Deirdre was a young woman with fiery red hair and a fiery heart. She inherited her grandfather's â€“ [[Ilmus Gallaway]]'s hot temper.

==Possessions==
Deidre's shop, Gallaway Trade Depot, stood atop a cliff in Targos, overlooking the town's docks and the coaster's warehouses. Her inventory included several unique and common [[enchanted]] items, as well as weapons, armor, pelts, alcohol, [[iron rations]], lumber, and many other trade goods.

==History==
Deirdre Gallaway was a young and ambitious member of the Gallaway Coaster, daughter to [[Rawleigh Gallaway]], and granddaughter of [[Ilmus Gallaway]] of [[Easthaven]]. Shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Deirdre was sent to run the Gallaway Trade Depot in Targos with aid and council from [[Jemeliah]], her father's loyal friend and employee. Deirdre's ambitions, however, were cut short by the grim reality of war. That year, the [[Legion of the Chimera]] targeted the [[Ten Towns]] and besieged Targos, costing the coaster profit and forcing Deidre to provide the town with weapons and lumber on credit with some persuasion by the Speaker Lord [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]]. The loss of income embittered young woman, causing tensions between the coaster and the leadership of Targos.
