'''Po'ioa'nam''' was a [[shalarin]] innkeeper in [[Myth Nantar]]. 

==History==
Po'ioa'nam was a rogue warrior who, around [[1349 DR]], managed to penetrate the [[Great Barrier]] with his wife [[Tu'ara'thal]] after fleeing a group of [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]] who had killed all his companions. [[Qos]] accepted Po'ioa'nam and his wife and permitted them to settle in the city. There they would go on to operate the [[Resonant Horn Inn]]. 

During the city's invasion at the end of the [[Twelfth Serôs War]], Po'iao'nam fought against [[Iakhovas]]'s troops. 

==Personality==
Po'ioa'nam was happy to not fight again and was very proud to his daughter [[Ka'ioa'Tara]].
