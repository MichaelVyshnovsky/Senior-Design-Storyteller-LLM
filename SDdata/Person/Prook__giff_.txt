Lieutenant Prook () was a giff mercenary commander. After his entire brigade was captured by neogi slavers and later killed once their ship crashed in Icewind Dale, he was stranded alone on Toril.
Due to the weaponry he carried, Lieutenant Prook smelled faintly of smokepowder. He was  tall.
As was customary among giff mercenaries, Lieutenant Prook had an array of weapons on his person, including a longsword, a musket, two pistols, and a number of fragmentation grenades. He also carried a chime of opening.
Lieutenant Prook and his brigade were captured by the neogi slavers of the deathspider Erlir Fezrregal. Their ship crashed in Icewind Dale while in pursuit of the nautiloid Id Ascendant. In the chaos, Prook was able to escape.
Having nearly frozen to death due to the harsh conditions of the Everlasting Rime, Prook was captured and dragged to a cave by a pair of ice trolls who intended to eat him. When his troll captors were slain by a group of adventurers, the lieutenant weakly directed his saviors to a piece of paper in his satchel that instructed them to resuscitate him with Herb Tea 33-Alpha, along with a recipe for the brew.
Once recovered, Prook reluctantly agreed to direct the adventurers to the crash site of the Erlir Fezrregal.
