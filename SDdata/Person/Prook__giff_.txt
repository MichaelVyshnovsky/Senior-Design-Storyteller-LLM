'''Lieutenant Prook''' ({{Pronounce|lef|TEN|ant|_|puh|_|ROOK}}) was a [[giff]] mercenary commander. After his entire brigade was captured by [[neogi]] slavers and later killed once their ship crashed in [[Icewind Dale]], he was stranded alone on [[Toril]].

==Description==
Due to the weaponry he carried, Lieutenant Prook smelled faintly of [[smokepowder]]. He was {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} tall.{{Cite adventurers league/The Fallen Star|5-6}}

==Possessions==
As was customary among giff mercenaries, Lieutenant Prook had an array of weapons on his person, including a [[longsword]], a [[musket]], two [[pistol]]s, and a number of [[fragmentation grenade]]s. He also carried a ''[[chime of opening]]''.

==History==
Lieutenant Prook and his brigade were captured by the neogi slavers of the [[deathspider]] ''[[Er'lir Fezrrega'l]]''. Their ship crashed in Icewind Dale while in pursuit of the [[nautiloid]] ''[[Id Ascendant]]''. In the chaos, Prook was able to escape.

Having nearly frozen to death due to the harsh conditions of the [[Everlasting Rime]], Prook was captured and dragged to a cave by a pair of [[ice troll]]s who intended to eat him.{{Cite adventurers league/The Fallen Star|6}} When his troll captors were slain by a group of [[adventurer]]s, the lieutenant weakly directed his saviors to a piece of paper in his satchel that instructed them to resuscitate him with [[Herb Tea 33-Alpha]], along with a recipe for the brew.{{Cite adventurers league/The Fallen Star|8}}

Once recovered, Prook reluctantly agreed to direct the adventurers to the crash site of the ''Er'lir Fezrrega'l''.
