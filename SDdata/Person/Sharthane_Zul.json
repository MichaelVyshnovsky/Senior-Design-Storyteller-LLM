        "mainbody": "'''Sharthane Zul''' was the [[human]] high [[priest]] of [[Cyric]] who presided over the [[House of Cyric (Bezantur)|House of Cyric]] in [[Bezantur]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. As the most influential member of the [[church of Cyric]] in [[Thay]], he was one of the most powerful individuals in that realm as of the late 1360s DR. His influence was said to rival that of the [[zulkir]]s.",
        "Personality": "He was a masterful politician as well as suspected of being both a sadist&mdash;amusing himself with a private underground torture chamber&mdash;and a masochist&mdash;known to willingly give up his life energies in exchange for sexual favors from a [[succubus]].",
        "Activities": "Sharthane presided over the largest congregation of Cyric-worshipers in all of Thay at the House of Cyric. He lived on the temple grounds in a personal mansion, which was opulent enough to have been the home of a king. He had hundreds of personal [[slave]]s.\n\nHe was known to traffic with [[tanar'ri]] for information and entertainment.",
        "History": "During the ongoing Thayan civil conflicts of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Sharthane was careful to maintain neutrality lest his political power be tested by the [[Red Wizards]]."
