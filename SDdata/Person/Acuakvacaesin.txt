'''Acuakvacaesin''' was a peaceful [[green dragon]] residing in the [[Moonshae Isles]].

==Personality==
Acuakvacaesin had a great respect for the natural world,{{Cite dragon/356/Volo's Guide: Wyrms of the West, East and South|73}} was largely disinterested in the affairs of humanoids, and was desirous of a peaceful life. He held great disdain for his fellow green dragons and their evil ways.

He preferred to use magic to exist for as much time as possible in the form of either his [[wood elf]] alias, '''Caesin'''; a [[fey]] creature; or as a woodland animal.

The mere sight of [[drow]], [[orc]]s, or [[chromatic dragon]]s would drive Caesin into a rage, whereupon he would drop any magical disguises that he was wearing, and attack them in his full glory.

==Abilities==
As a [[dragon aging|mature adult]] green dragon, he had the powers and abilities of such a creature, including the natural ability to breathe underwater and expel a cloud of poisonous breath.<ref> Additionally, Caesin could cast several [[sorcerer]] spells, which he used in combat, and to [[polymorph]] himself.

==Possessions==
Caesin's hoard was small, and consisted of only [[cp|copper]] and [[sp|silver coins]], plus a few magic items. Said items included a ''[[Cloak of elvenkind|cloak]]'' and ''[[boots of elvenkind]]'', as well as a ''+3 holy dragonbane [[longsword]]''.

==Activities==
Acuakvacaesin spent his waking hours mostly patrolling [[Myrloch Vale]] under a magical disguise in an attempt to root out evil or those who would try to breach the security of Synnoria.

==Relationships==
In his elven form, Caesin was permitted to move freely among the [[Llewyrr]] elves of [[Synnoria]]. Of these elves, he was closest to a scout named [[Numira]], who was one of the few Llewyrr who knew his true identity. Caesin was secretly in love with Numira.

==History==
Acuakvacaesin came to [[Gwynneth]] in an attempt to remove himself from his own evil kin, and find peace in the resplendence of the natural world. Unfortunately, he was attacked and nearly killed by both [[Ffolk]] and [[Northlander]] [[human]]s. However, although he emerged victorious from these battles, he refused to kill any of his opponents, and did not demand their treasures, even in recompense. A band of Llewyrr scouts, led by a woman named Numira, observed these battles from afar. Taking the form of a young elf himself, Caesin approached the scouts, and after many months of talking with them, discovered that he was not far from their home city of Synnoria. Numira had seen through Caesin's magical disguise but had not told anyone as she didn't want to see this curious green dragon harmed by her peers.

Eventually the 'elf' Caesin was permitted entrance to Synnoria.

Caesin took up the faith of the local goddess known as the [[Earthmother]]. Although his faith in her and her tenets were true, he also wished that the goddess would permanently transform him into his elven alias so that he could safely declare his love for Numira without risking her becoming pregnant with a [[half-dragon]] who might inherit his kin's predilection for evil.
