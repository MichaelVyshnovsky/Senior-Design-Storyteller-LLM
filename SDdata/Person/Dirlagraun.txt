Dirlagraun () was an aged displacer beast that traveled across the planes of existence with the Witchlight Carnival.
Dirlagraun spoke in a calm manner and was quite intuitive of the feelings of others.
The mighty beast was granted the ability to speak and understand several languages spoken by mortals, including the common tongue.
She wore a massive set of artificial butterfly wings attached to her tendrils and a collar around her neck that held a large keg of toffee apple juice. This juice was beloved by children and had a soothing effect when consumed.
Dirlagraun spent her days diligently serving as nanny to any children that found themselves lost within the Witchlight Carnival. She considered this charge to be her most important duty in life.
Dirlagraun was raised by a family of noble high elves of the Summer Court.
The displaced beast once had her own cub named Star, before it inexplicably went missing from the carnival.  Dirlagraun never forgave herself for this loss.
