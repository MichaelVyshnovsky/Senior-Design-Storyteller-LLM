'''Lord Helmstone''' was the lord of the [[Helmstone]] noble family of [[Cormyr]] around [[1372 DR]].

He believed [[Laspeera]] should be [[Royal Mage]] and that the still-living members of the [[Obarskyr]] royal family to be decadent. He may have been plotting against the Obarskyrs or the current Royal Mage.[[Caladnei]].

He had his son approach Laspeera, but he handled the encounter clumsily.
