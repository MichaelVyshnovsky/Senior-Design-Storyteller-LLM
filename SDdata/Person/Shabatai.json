        "mainbody": "'''Shabatai''' was a [[wizard]], belonging to the [[Far Quey]] tribe of the [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}.",
        "Description": "[[Taegan Nightwind]] described him as small and sharp-featured, while [[Will Turnstone]] called him sharp-nosed and a runt. He carried a polished [[ebony]] rod with [[gold]] caps at the ends, which he employed to cast a [[spell]] that created an entrancing radiance of many colors, presumably ''[[hypnotic pattern]]''.",
        "History": "On [[Eleint 7]], he broke the spell that [[Karasendrieth]] used to approach his war band, and then attacked her with ''[[burning hands]]''. After her companions offered aid to the warriors injured in the fight against [[Capnolithyl]] and thus ended the battle, he tried to orient them in their quest for the ''[[dracorage mythal]]'', but knew of nothing that could aid them. It was another warrior amongst them that suggested they try asking [[The Hermit]], which he initially dismissed.{{cite book/The Ruin||1}}"
