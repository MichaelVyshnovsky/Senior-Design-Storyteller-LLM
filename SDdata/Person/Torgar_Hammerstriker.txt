'''Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker''' was the [[dwarf]] commander of the [[Axe of Mirabar]], the militia of [[Mirabar]], in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He had served the [[marchion]] of Mirabar for as long as anyone could remember, claiming it to have been three hundred years. Torgar was the last member of [[Clan Hammerstriker]].

==Description==
He was a tough-looking dwarf with many scars and a long black beard.

==Equipment==
Torgar possessed a suit of fine [[plate armor]].

==History==
===Loyalties===
Torgar's loyalty to Mirabar was called into question by the Marchion [[Elastul Raurym]] after [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] and his party of dwarves visited the city and Torgar was openly consorting with them. Torgar was torn between his long-standing loyalty to Mirabar on the one hand and his loyalty to the dwarven race on the other. This prompted Torgar to consider leaving Mirabar.

His decision to leave for [[Mithral Hall]] was sealed when he was, in his view, poorly treated by the Marchion and [[Agrathan Hardhammer]].

In response to Torgar's imprisonment, the dwarves of Mirabar revolted against the human dwellers of the city. Under the advice of [[Shoudra Stargleam]] and [[Agrathan Hardhammer]], the dwarven priest of [[Dumathoin]], Marchion Elastul released Torgar. He left soon afterwards with almost 400 dwarves behind him. Torgar and his dwarves later became members of clan Battlehammer and fought with Mithral Hall against the armies of [[Gerti Orelsdottr]] and King [[Obould Many-Arrows]].
