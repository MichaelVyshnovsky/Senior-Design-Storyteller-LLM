Brother Eardon was a wandering priest of Lathander during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Eardon wandered northwest Faer√ªn, using his powers to help villagers as a messenger or priest.
In 1491 DR, Eardon was at the Swinging Sword tavern when some adventurers were hired to find a diplomatic caravan that had disappeared near the city. He confirmed that he had seen the caravan a few days before in Beliard.
