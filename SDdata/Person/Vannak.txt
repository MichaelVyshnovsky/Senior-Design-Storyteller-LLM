'''Vannak''' ran a camp near [[Spellgard]].

==History==
Vannak was a [[dragonborn]] of a prominent clan. He traveled with his retinue to [[Spellgard]] seeking Lady [[Saharel]]'s counsel in order to find the strongest mate ever. He established a private camp near the ruin. In [[1479 DR]], his warriors had captured a woman, [[Hanna Blenn]], who claimed to have met the Lady.
