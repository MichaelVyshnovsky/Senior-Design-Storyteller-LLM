        "History": "Eldrinn was a member in the [[College of Divination]] of his city and the son of [[Seldszar Elpragh]].\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1376}}, Eldrinn went to the [[High Moor]] in search of artifacts, with a soldier as escort. \n\nThere he found a [[kiira (disambiguation)|''kiira'']], but they were attacked by monsters. The soldier died and Eldrinn was near death when [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] arrived, who wanted admittance in Sshamath.\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1377}}, Eldrinn was one of the apprentice of Q'arlyn that was about to start his new [[College of Ancient Arcana]].\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1379}}, together with his fellow, his father and the Masters [[Urlryn Khalazza]] and [[Masoj Dhuunyl]] he helped Q'Arlynd when he engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by [[Wendonai]]'s blood into brown-skinned [[dark elves]]. After they all relocated to [[Rhymanthiin]]."
