        "History": "The wealth of Kudoku attracted Namiko and the other Five Deadly Shadows. They slowly infiltrated the city, corrupting everything.\n\nWhen rumors of the corruption reached the ears of the provincial governor in 1479 DR, she sent the magistrate [[Hiro Yun]]. Step by step, Hiro efficiently shut down all the gang's operations and arrested most of its members until only the five leaders remained. At this point, Hiro challenged the assassins but in the end was defeated.\n\nNamiko later bound the souls of Hiro Yun and of [[Kenzo Harima]], who had betrayed the Deadly Shadows to side with Hiro, to [[Toril]], preventing them from going to the [[afterlife]]. In doing this, she and her geisha mistakenly became [[half-oni]].\n\nLater, an adventuring party, under the suggestion of the new magistrate [[Sujin Makoto]], confronted and defeated her.{{Cite dungeon/195/The Five Deadly Shadows|1-19}}",
