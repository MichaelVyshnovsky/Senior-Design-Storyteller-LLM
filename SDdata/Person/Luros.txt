'''Luros''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]].

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Luros and his fellow cultists observed a plot by the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]] to kidnap monks from the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]], in order to use them in a new plot to access an [[elemental node]]. In a room in the node's complex under the monastery, thanks to the elemental forces, Luros switched bodies with a monk, [[Marren]]. Later, he met an adventuring party hired by Grandmaster [[Perrywinkle Shin]] to find missing monks. The adventurers managed to put Luros back in his body, but he tried to double-crosse them and was killed.{{Cite adventurers league/The Howling Void|18-19}}
