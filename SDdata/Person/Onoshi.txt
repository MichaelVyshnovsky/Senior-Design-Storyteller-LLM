'''Onoshi''' was an inhabitant of the town of [[Aru]] in [[Wa]].

==Relationships==
Onoshi was the son of an Aru fishmonger.

==History==
Around [[1358 DR]], he was paid by a stranger to set fire to a peasant's [[Wa-an dictionary#M|''minka'']] in the [[Wa-an dictionary#E|''eta'']] area of town. He complied, but just after the act, Onoshi was discovered by an adventuring party hired by the [[Wa-an dictionary#D|daimyo]] [[Benju Matsutomo]] and captured.
