        "History": "Some years before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Garno's family was put to the torch by malicious members of the [[Church of Loviatar]]. Driven to disillusionment, Garno swore to bring vengeance on the evil clergy. He claimed many Loviatan lives thanks to wielding ''[[Arbane's Sword of Agility]]''. It was believed that a deity of chaos helped the sword to reach Garno's hand, reveling in havoc caused by the vengeful man."
