But those who knew him better were aware of his selfish and cowardly nature.\nArjhani was a master glaive-user. He trained the Lance Defenders in its use.\nIn his youth, Arjhani was a close friend of Mehen, Uadjit and Sepideh during their service in the Lance Defenders. Around 1450 DR, Arjhani had a gay relationship with his clanmate, Mehen. When Mehen was exiled, Arjhani was chosen by Clan Verthisathurgiesh as the new husband for Uadjit.\nSome years later, Arjhani went to Arush Vayem to try to convince Mehen to return to Djerad Thymar, in vain. Arjhani lived with Mehen and his family for a summer. He became close with Havilar, and taught her how to use the glaive. At the end of the summer, Arjhani abandoned them without saying a word, returning to Djerad Thymar. This act earned him the enmity of Mehen and his two daughters, Farideh and Havilar.\nIn 1486 DR, Arjhani was a field commander of the Lance Defenders, as well as weapons master for the new recruits. of the maurezhi granted to Gilgeam, whose mission was to infiltrate and debilitate the Thymari defenses. He was rescued by Mehen, Kallan, Dumuzi, Farideh, and Havilar before the maurezhi could kill him.\nHe became a candidate for the elections to chose the new Vanquisher, which were expected to be celebrated in 1487 DR, for Clan Kepeshkmolik, when Uadjit lost favor with the clan elders. He was one of the main opposition to granting refuge to Namshita and her Untheran allies, despite the fact that she and her people were helping the Tymantherans against Gilgeams forces.\nAfter Kallan was chosen as the interim Vanquisher, Arjhani had no other option but to follow Kallans example and publicly pray to Enlil. Thanks to his popularity, many among the Lance Defenders converted to Enlils faith."
