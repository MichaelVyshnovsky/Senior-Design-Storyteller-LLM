'''Bedlen Daglefodd''' was a humble [[svirfneblin]] who lived in a small village in the [[Underdark]].

==Possessions==
The deep gnome owned and fought with a one-handed [[axe]], [[dart]]s, and a [[buckler]]. He also donned a set of [[Chainmail|chainmail armor]].

==History==
Drow patrols near [[Ust Natha]] cast [[spell]]s upon Bedlen when he was wandering outside of his village around the year [[1368 DR]]. He somehow became trapped in the second-to-right chamber of the [[Facet sphere]], where his soul was kept for a few days. He may have been freed by [[Gorion's Ward]], by request of Bedlen's father, [[Therndle Daglefodd|Therndle]].
