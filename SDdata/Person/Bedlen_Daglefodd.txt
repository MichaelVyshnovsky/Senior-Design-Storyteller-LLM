Bedlen Daglefodd was a humble svirfneblin who lived in a small village in the Underdark.
The deep gnome owned and fought with a one-handed axe, darts, and a buckler. He also donned a set of chainmail armor.
Drow patrols near Ust Natha cast spells upon Bedlen when he was wandering outside of his village around the year 1368 DR. He somehow became trapped in the second-to-right chamber of the Facet sphere, where his soul was kept for a few days. He may have been freed by Gorions Ward, by request of Bedlens father, Therndle.
