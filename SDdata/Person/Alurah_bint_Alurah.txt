Alurah bint Alurah was an accomplished shair and princess of Hiyal around 1367 DR.
Alurah exemplified all of the traits one would expect from spoiled royalty. She was greedy, malicious, and dismissed others "beneath" her status. She held no qualms about attacking an innocent in order to cover her own wrongdoings.
Alurah was the daughter of Sultana Alurah bint Asrah and the youngest of all of her siblings. She would turn family members against each other to suit her purposes. Her gen familiar was a djinnling named Pin.
