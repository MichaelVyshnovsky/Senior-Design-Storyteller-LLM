He dwelt alone.
In the , Yintras Bedelmrin was alone at his tower, praying to Azuth for guidance on who to pass his Art on to. He received a sign from the god, who magically armored him and forewarned him about a danger coming to him. At that point, the Slayer, an enigmatic entity, flowed into his tower room and towards him. With Azuths boon, Yintras was able to repel it, and the entity fled his tower.
