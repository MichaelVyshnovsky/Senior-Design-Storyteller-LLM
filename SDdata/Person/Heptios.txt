'''Heptios''' was a mage and philosopher in [[Cimbar]] in [[Chessenta]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], and the most powerful Chessentan [[wizard]] of his day. He was known as "Heptios the Archmage".

==Activities==
Having given up life as a wizard to become a philosopher, Heptios wandered the streets of Cimbar trying to discuss philosophy with the crowds. He did prefer others' company and conversation to the seclusion of [[magic]]al research.

Heptios had quarters at the [[University]] but preferred to live in friends' houses whilst moving between them regularly. He rarely visited his own quarters except to store [[spell]]s and [[magical item]]s.

Heptios argued that passions would lead people into reckless and dangerous behavior, and that emotion must be overcome by rational thought.

In relation to the [[orc]]s and [[half-orc]]s of [[Airspur (Chessenta)|Airspur]], Heptios argued that orcs who adopted [[human]] values might be the greatest threat the Realms had ever known.

Needless to say, Heptios was hated by Cimbar's Mob and, frankly, he didn't much like them either. The Mob even attempted to kill him on several occasions, but Heptios had a ''[[cube of force]]'' to shield him from all but their abuse.

Heptios led a small group of like-minded philosophers known as the Heptain. They educated others on the importance of philosophy and rationalism compared to superstition.

Despite rumors to the contrary, Heptios disavowed any connection with the [[Numbers Cult]].

Impressively, the [[god]] [[Azuth]], Patron of Mages, was once seen talking with Heptios.

==Description==

Heptios was an old man, short and fat and bald. He commonly wore brown robes with a hood.
