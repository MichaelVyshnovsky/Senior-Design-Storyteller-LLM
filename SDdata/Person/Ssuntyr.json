        "mainbody": "Ssuntyr was a wizard and vengeful former cobbler and ex-Elder of the Council of the village of Maskyrs Eye in the Vast in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nCirca 1341 DR, Ssuntyr was discovered to have dealings with drow and even worse creatures of the Underdark. Worse still, he had used his art to make a neighbor ill and force her to sell him her farm prior to her death. The Council deposed the villain and the villagers drove him out of the village, but the fight turned bloody, seriously injuring two farmers and killing a third, Thurl Northmane. Finally, Arbrest Thunwyllun pierced Ssuntyr with his pitchfork and Hulthoon Maer almost lopped off one of his hands with his axe, but Ssuntyr escaped through a portal of fire opened by a magical device.\nBut Ssuntyr survived these grievous injuries and arrived at his hideout in the Giantspike Mountains near the town of Kurth. He used potions to heal his other wounds, but regrowing his almost-severed hand took much more time, expense, and effort to achieve.\nSo, to earn back some coin, Ssuntyr had to become an adventurer and a mage-for-hire under an array of false identities in Iriaebor, Teziir, and Westgate. After several years of this, he was a far more capable worker of magic, and ready to get his revenge against his old neighbors. \nUsing his polymorph magic to pose as an itinerant seed merchant, circa 1357 DR, Ssuntyr planned to return to Maskyrs Vale and take a room at The Wizards Hand inn. Then he would begin using his magic to murder the older villagers, his contemporaries from sixteen years ago, and kill as many as he could until he was caught out. His plot would risk casting suspicion on any other strangers who happened to be in the village at the time, and he would be only too happy to frame them for his crimes.As a short adventure idea, Ssuntyrs plan is described in future and present tense, suggesting he had not begun his murders or even arrived in Maskyrs Eye as of the time of writing.\nSsuntyr was cunning, cautious, patient, and coldly efficient in carrying out his crimes.\nHe prepared spells of dimension door, fly, haste, hold portal, invisibility, magic missile, and web.\nSsuntyr wore a ring of protection +6 and a ring of the ram. He possessed scrolls of dispel magic, polymorph other, polymorph self, remove curse, and wizard eye. He also created feather tokens of his own design that placed a short-lived silence on the user. He was also armed with a wand of fireballs and had two potions of extra-healing.\nSsuntyrs plan was to use his invisibility and silence magic to avoid detection as he lay in wait from atop roofs and stone walls and strike at his targets with magic missiles. He would attack when they were alone and circumstances were best whenever he could. Then he would flee into the forest to hide until his magic renewed.\nHe planned to target Khonduil Ammargath, the local cleric of Tymora, last so that he could capture and interrogate and finally kill him at his leisure. Ssuntyr believed Khonduil had some knowledge about or even a link to the magical legacy of the archmage Maskyr One-Eye, and he wanted to extract all the information he could and then search for it himself."
