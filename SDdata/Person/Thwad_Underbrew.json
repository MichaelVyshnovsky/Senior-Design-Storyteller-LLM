Wanting to live, Thwad accepted and was given the task of defeating new intruders inside the Obstacle Course level.\nWaiting for new intruders, Thwad was confined inside a small demiplane inside a painting.\nThwad believed that he was merciful to the people he killed because they would never know the desperation he felt in going against his faith. However, in time he started to enjoy killing people."
