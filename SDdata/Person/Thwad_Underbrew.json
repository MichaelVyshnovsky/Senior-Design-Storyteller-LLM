        "mainbody": "'''Thwad Underbrew''' was a [[shield dwarf]] and former champion of [[Gorm Gulthyn]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Some time before the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], Thwad went into Undermontain with the intention of getting rid of [[Halaster Blackcloak]] in the name of his god. However, Halaster defeated him but agreed to spare his life if Thwad accepted becoming one of his enforcers. Wanting to live, Thwad accepted and was given the task of defeating new intruders inside the [[Obstacle Course]] level.",
        "Activities": "Waiting for new intruders, Thwad was confined inside a small [[demiplane]] inside a painting.",
        "Personality": "Thwad believed that he was merciful to the people he killed because they would never know the desperation he felt in going against his faith. However, in time he started to enjoy killing people."
