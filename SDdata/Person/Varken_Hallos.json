        "mainbody": "Varken Hallos was a mage agent of the Zhentarim who resided in the city of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.\nVarken Hallos rented a small apartment in Ravens Bluff sometime before the . He kept his affiliation with the hated Zhentarim secret and worked covertly to further the organizations goals as a hireling and a middleman. On the 16 of Flamerule, Varken was tasked by infuriated Zhent Threll Whitebane to find a band of adventurers or mercenaries to recover a lockbox with a Book of Vile Darkness from the House of Mystery of Ravens Bluff. Servants of Mystra, in turn, stole the Baneinte Book of Vile Darkness earlier the same day from the Black Network. Varken Hallos instructed mercenaries with written instructions \"Recover the tome at any cost. You must get it to Keldars Shrine.\" One of the mercenaries was Ulijaz Thenumbrin, who was offered hundreds of golden pieces upfront and thousands later upon the books delivery. None of Varkens mercenaries knew of the mages name and only knew of his apartment address and description. He used the whispering wind wind spell to communicate with his men. However, Varkens attempts were unsuccessful and a band of goodly adventurers succeeded in delivering the Book of Vile Darkness to an extra-dimensional vault in the village of Dragon Falls."
