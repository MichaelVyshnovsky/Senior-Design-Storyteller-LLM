        "mainbody": "'''Varken Hallos''' was a [[mage]] agent of the [[Zhentarim]] who resided in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Varken Hallos rented a small apartment in Ravens Bluff sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}{{LCRB}}. He kept his affiliation with the hated Zhentarim secret and worked covertly to further the organization's goals as a hireling and a middleman. On the 16{{th}} of [[Flamerule 16|Flamerule]], Varken was tasked by infuriated Zhent [[Threll Whitebane]] to find a band of adventurers or mercenaries to recover a lockbox with a ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]'' from the [[House of Mystery]] of Ravens Bluff. Servants of [[Mystra]], in turn, stole the [[Bane]]inte ''Book of Vile Darkness'' earlier the same day from the Black Network. Varken Hallos instructed mercenaries with written instructions: \"Recover the tome at any cost. You must get it to [[Keldar's Shrine]].\" One of the mercenaries was [[Ulijaz Thenumbrin]], who was offered hundreds of golden pieces upfront and thousands later upon the book's delivery. None of Varken's mercenaries knew of the mage's name and only knew of his apartment address and description. He used the ''[[whispering wind]]'' wind [[spell]] to communicate with his men.{{Cite organized play/LC/Ineffable Tome|31}} However, Varken's attempts were unsuccessful and a band of goodly adventurers succeeded in delivering the ''Book of Vile Darkness'' to an extra-dimensional vault in the village of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Ineffable Tome|26}}"
