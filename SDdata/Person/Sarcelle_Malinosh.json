        "mainbody": "arcelle Malinosh was a Neverwintian noble and wild magic sorcerer in the late 15 century DR. She lost the ability to conjure magic during an expedition to a distant plane.\nSarcelles responses to questions were very cryptic, almost like predictions. Nevertheless, she strove to manage this habit, aware of how irritating it was.\nIn the late 1490s DR, Sarcelle and other three nobles were kidnapped by group of Vecna cultists and taken to Neverwinters graveyard, Neverdeath. She was then confined in a crypt that had been converted into a cell."
