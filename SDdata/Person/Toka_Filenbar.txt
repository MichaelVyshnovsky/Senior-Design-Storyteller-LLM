'''Toka Filenbar''' was an inhabitant of [[Luskan]] sometime before [[1487 DR]]. 

==History==
Toka was beloved by a person named [[Ezra]], who outlived them and had their epitaph engraved with the words "Here lies Toka Filenbar, Forever Ezra's".

Toka was buried in the crypts beneath Luskan sometime before 1487 DR, when the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]] came across their tomb.
