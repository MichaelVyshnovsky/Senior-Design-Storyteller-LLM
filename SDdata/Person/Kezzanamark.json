        "mainbody": "ezzanamark was an adult red dragon that gained fame by killing a wizard and a blacksmith of some renown, Darnarest the Bladesmith in 1303 DR.\nLike many of his red dragon brethren, Kezzanamark was cruel, petty, proud, vengeful, and greedy.\nIn the , a group of witless adventurers emboldened by the new enchanted weapons. The \"heroes\" proudly challenged the wyrm bragging of the weaponry crafted by Darnarest himself that was to bring Kezzanamarks death. Needless to say, the adventurers were quickly dispatched by the dragons fiery breath. Angered by the foolishness, Kezzanamark embarked on the quest of finding Darnarest. Eventually, the red dragon found Darnarests tower and its owner. The dragon and the wizard clashed in a fierce aerial battle which resulted in Darnarest being bit in half. Kezzanamark melted the tower, and scattered its remnants searching for the wizards treasures. The search was unsuccessful and Kezzanamark departed for the part unknown."
