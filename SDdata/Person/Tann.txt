Commander Tann was a human commander of Fort Locke near the Mere of Dead Men on the Sword Coast North.
Tann was the commander of Fort Locke until he vanished on a patrol. A shadow priest captured him and his men Blaine, Bruneil, and Garret.
When the Kalach-Cha arrived, Tann was held captive and needed to be rescued. Once done, the Kalach-Cha couldve searched for his men. However, upon returning coming to Fort Locke, Vallis would be displeased Tann had returned and would imprison him. The Kalach-Cha couldve fought Vallis or persuaded his men to put their weapons down.
