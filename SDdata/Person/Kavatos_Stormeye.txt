'''Kavatos Stormeye''' was a [[wizard]] of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Kavatos Stormeye first helped the heroes of [[Neverwinter]] in their efforts against the [[frost giant]] [[Storvald]] in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. Thereafter, he gave his services to [[Lord Neverember]], adding magical protections to the [[Crown of Neverwinter]] to prevent anyone but Neverember himself from touching it. When the [[Cloaked Ascendancy]] attempted to overthrow Neverember and unleash the [[Far Realm]] upon the city, Kavatos helped the heroes in researching their foes and providing the means to defeat them.<ref>

Later, when the mad [[illusionist]] [[Lukan]] accidentally freed the [[dragonborn]] [[necromancer]] [[Morlanth]] and unleashed an army of [[wraith]]s upon the [[River District]], Kavatos apprehended and imprisoned him before sending the heroes to find out what he did and stop it.<ref>

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Kavatos accompanied [[Elminster]] and the factions of the North to the [[Dragonbone Vale]] where the allied forces sought to thwart a plot by the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. There, Kavatos volunteered to study a collection of [[artifact]]s that allowed the villains to tap into the phenomenon he called ''[[dragonsight]]''.<ref>
