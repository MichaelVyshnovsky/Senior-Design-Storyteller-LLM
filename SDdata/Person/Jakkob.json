Jakkob led the pack on raids against the [[Talu-min]] tribe, killing many of their herd animals in the process. The Talu-min eventually caught up to, and slew all of the hyenas, but Jakkob was once again able to escape with his life. He fled to Yhep where he led the town's dog on nightly hunts.<ref name=EotSS-p170\"/>"
