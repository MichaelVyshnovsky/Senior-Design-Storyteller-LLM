        "mainbody": "'''Ilserv''', also known as '''Ilserv of the Illithids''', was a [[mind flayer]] sage in [[Ch'Chitl]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Ilserv originally acted as an emissary and ambassador of Ch'Chitl to the surface until, by accident, the [[beholder]] crime lord [[Xanathar]] petrified him. For many years, Ilserv was one of the statues in a rock garden near [[Mirt]]'s mansion.\n\nHowever, Ilserv maintained a little awareness and psychic power. Finally, in [[1367 DR]], Ilserv dominated the mind of a wizard guest of Mirt who reversed the transformation. Immediately, Ilserv returned to Ch'Chitl, refusing to ever go back to the surface. Thereafter, he was considered the city's sage about all surface matters, thanks to knowledge gleaned from reading minds in the garden."
