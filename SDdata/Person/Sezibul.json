        "History": "Sezibul was the shaman of the [[Fanged Moon]] tribe until 1485, when a pale orc gathered the Fanged Moon, [[Gory Maul]], and [[Jagged Scythe]] tribes under his command. Sezibul was the only previous leader to survive under the new leader. Sezibul commanded day-to-day activities in their headquarters in the ruins of [[Harpshield Castle]].\n\nLater, he was killed by an adventuring party hired to search the [[Delimbiyr Bloke]]."
