Gamo Hidenobu was a retainer of the Funada clan in Nakamaru in Wa around 1357 DR.
Hidenobu was often involved in questionable duels and vendettas.
Hidenobu and his brothers may have been involved in a plot by Funada Toyoo, which couldve ended with their deaths at the hands of Mashida Kowa and Oka Sanai.
Hidenobu, as eldest brother, was the most seasoned and toughest of the lot. However, he was embarrassed about having two missing front teeth and thus seldom smiled.
