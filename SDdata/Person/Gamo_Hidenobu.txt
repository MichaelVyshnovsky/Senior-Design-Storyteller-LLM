'''Gamo Hidenobu''' was a retainer of the [[Funada clan]] in [[Nakamaru]] in [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Hidenobu was often involved in questionable duels and vendettas.

==History==
Hidenobu and his brothers may have been involved in a plot by [[Funada Toyoo]], which could've ended with their deaths at the hands of [[Mashida Kowa]] and [[Oka Sanai]].

==Personality==
Hidenobu, as eldest brother, was the most seasoned and toughest of the lot. However, he was embarrassed about having two missing front teeth and thus seldom smiled.
