        "mainbody": "Immithra Shrae was the head of the Bounty of the Goddess temple of Chauntea in Voonlar i.e., from about 1355 DR until at least 1367 DR.\nIn the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR, Lady Shrae was middle-aged, tall, slender, and very attractive, with black hair that showed no signs of gray. She had a soft, pleasant voice.\nAlthough she insisted on being addressed as Lady Matriarch by those outside the church and Young Matriarch by her fellow clergy, she was generally pleasant, fair, and equitable with everyone.\nShrae was a good friend of her counterpart in Shadowdale, the High Harvestmistress Glamerie Windbough of the House of Plenty, and usually the two priestesses discussed spiritual matters as well as exchanging useful information about raids on Voonlar and Zhentarim activities. She was known to help good adventurers with healing and even give them shelter on the temple grounds.\nGormstadd the Rerisen, high priest of the Dark God Reformed, and Bron Buorstag hated Lady Shrae but feared the ire of Chauntea too much to act.\nHarper agent Sharalyn Lockleaf was an old friend of Lady Shraes. Sharalyn asked for Shraes help in 1373 DR as the priestess owned one of the keys from the city gates and could bypass the lockdown.\nLady Shrae was present during the fiend attack on Voonlar by the dreaded Order of the Crippled Fang of the . She offered her services to the defenders but insisted on selling the supplies as the Bounty of the Goddess suffered financially in the attack and preceding strife in the Moonsea region. She did offed magic potions for a much lower price than anywhere in the city."
