        "Description": "In the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]], Lady Shrae was middle-aged, tall, slender, and very attractive, with black hair that showed no signs of gray. She had a soft, pleasant voice.",
        "Personality": "Although she insisted on being addressed as Lady Matriarch by those outside the church and Young Matriarch by her fellow clergy, she was generally pleasant, fair, and equitable with everyone.",
        "Relationships": "Shrae was a good friend of her counterpart in [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]], the High Harvestmistress [[Glamerie Windbough]] of the [[House of Plenty]], and usually the two priestesses discussed spiritual matters as well as exchanging useful information about raids on Voonlar and [[Zhentarim]] activities. She was known to help good adventurers with healing and even give them shelter on the temple grounds.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 9: Voonlarran Religious Politics}}\n\n[[Gormstadd]] the Rerisen, high priest of the [[Dark God Reformed]], and Bron [[Buorstag Hlammythyl|Buorstag]] hated Lady Shrae but feared the ire of Chauntea too much to act.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|7}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 5: The Moods of Voonlar}}\n\n[[Harper agent]] [[Sharalyn Lockleaf]] was an old friend of Lady Shrae's. Sharalyn asked for Shrae's help in [[1373 DR]] as the priestess owned one of the keys from the city gates and could bypass the lockdown.",
        "History": "Lady Shrae was present during the [[fiend]] attack on [[Voonlar]] by the dreaded [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}. She offered her services to the defenders but insisted on selling the supplies as the Bounty of the Goddess suffered financially in the attack and preceding strife in the Moonsea region. She did offed magic [[potion]]s for a much lower price than anywhere in the city."
