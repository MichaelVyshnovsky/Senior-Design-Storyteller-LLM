Valdar Jaelre was a drow priest of Vhaeraun in the 1370s DR.
Valdar was born to House Jaelre when it was still in Menzoberranzan.
Valdar was one of the nightshadows who joined Malvags plot in 1375 DR.
Valdar attacked a Eilistraeen shrine, claiming the soul of a priestess. Later, Malvag summoned his loyal agents Szorak, Urz, and Valdar to a designated location to cast a spell that would allow Vhaeraun to enter Eilistraees domain undetected. However, Szorak was actually Qarlynd Melarn in disguise. He managed to kill Urz before he was killed himself, ruining the rite that needed three spellcasters to act.
By resurrecting and forcing Qarlynd to cooperate, Malvag and Valdar cast the spell successfully. However, just afterward, to his great surprise, he found he could create moonfire.
Thank to Urzs resurrection, they had the answer Eilistraee had slain Vhaeraun and claimed his portfolio. Valdar was devastated by the news and fled.
In 1376 DR, Valdar was taking refuge in Guallidurth in the Underdark, and had come to believe that Vhaeraun had succeeded in his plan but deceived everyone by claiming to have instead been defeated. There, he was found by Kâras, a former nightshadow who had joined the Church of Eilistraee and had orders to kill Valdar. However, Valdar convinced Kâras of his idea and the latter decided to spare Valdar for the moment.
In 1379 DR, he went in Llurth Dreir and saved Kârass life from the fanatic Molvayas. In truth, Valdar had also apparently joined the Church of Eilistraee and he and Kâras were on a mission to investigate Ghaunadaurs followers.
During an assault by Ghaunadaurs followers on the Promenade of the Dark Maiden, Valdar explained to Kâras that his plan was to manipulate Ghaunadaur into destroying all drow. Realizing he was insane, Kâras managed to kill him but only by sacrificing himself.
