{{Quote|Bugger Off. You're distractin' the slaves. They run, you're dead.|Mind Master Dunnol.}}

==Personality==
He was a brusque man that was wholly dedicated to his work for the cult.

==Abilities==
Like other dwarven mind masters, Dunnol wielded [[psionic]] powers that could briefly take over the minds of others, causing them to attack friends or allies in battle.

==Possessions==
Dunnol wore padded clothes and covered his shoulders with a white [[cape]], along with the distinct metal [[mask]] worn by mind master dwarves. He carried with him a lashing rod, that he used to punish laboring slaves.

==Activities==
Under the supervision of [[True Soul]] [[Nere]], Dunnol served as a taskmaster for the cult of the Absolute. He chided and beat the [[deep gnome]] slaves they used to excavate long-lost ruins within the [[Underdark]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Dunnol was among the Absolute's novices that journeyed into the ruins of [[Grymforge]] in search of an old temple of [[Shar]] that remained within its depths.
