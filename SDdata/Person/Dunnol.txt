Dunnol was a duergar mind master that joined the cult of the Absolute during the late 15 century DR.
He was a brusque man that was wholly dedicated to his work for the cult.
Like other dwarven mind masters, Dunnol wielded psionic powers that could briefly take over the minds of others, causing them to attack friends or allies in battle.
Dunnol wore padded clothes and covered his shoulders with a white cape, along with the distinct metal mask worn by mind master dwarves. He carried with him a lashing rod, that he used to punish laboring slaves.
Under the supervision of True Soul Nere, Dunnol served as a taskmaster for the cult of the Absolute. He chided and beat the deep gnome slaves they used to excavate long-lost ruins within the Underdark.
In the , Dunnol was among the Absolutes novices that journeyed into the ruins of Grymforge in search of an old temple of Shar that remained within its depths.
