'''Pryderi mac Dylan''' was a [[shield dwarf]] man of the dwarven city of [[Earthfast]] of the [[Earthfast Mountains]] of [[north Faerûn]], in the [[Earthroot]] region of the [[Underdark]]

==History==
Pryderi was the son of [[Dylan]].

In [[1360 DR|the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]], Pryderi was one of the 2000 Earthfast dwarves led by [[Ironlord]] [[Torg mac Cei]] who joined the [[Army of the Alliance]] against the [[Tuigan Horde]].

As the dwarves camped south of [[Uthmerg]] in the [[Great Dale]], Pryderi was one of the sentries. He and another dwarf caught two apparent intruders [[teleport]]ing in just outside—King [[Azoun IV]] of [[Cormyr]], leader of the Army, and his Court Wizard [[Vangerdahast]]—and held them at [[crossbow]]-point. Ironlord Torg arrived and berated Pryderi and his fellow sentry for failing to recognize a king.

It transpired that the dwarven escort sent to meet Azoun and Vangerdahast had disappeared, and Torg ordered Pryderi to lead a patrol to find them.

==Description==
Pryderi had red hair and beard.The cover art for ''[[Crusade]]'', shown in the image above, shows a crowned dwarf, intended to be Torg mac Cei, speaking to a red-bearded dwarf. Although this scene does not occur in the novel, it is presumed in this article that the red-bearded dwarf is Pryderi mac Dylan, as he is the only other named dwarf with a speaking part in the novel. The ''[[Spellfire: Master the Magic]]'' [[CCG]] card #79 uses this image for "Dwarf of Earthfast".
