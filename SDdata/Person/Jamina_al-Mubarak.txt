Jamina al-Mubarak was an inhabitant of the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire in 1367 DR.
Jamila served as the ambassador Extraordinary of the Brotherhood of the True Flame within the efreeti city. As such, she handled the business of the Brotherhood within the City of Brass when the Bonfire was not present, which was most of the time.
Her main focus was recruiting new talent from the efreeti into the Brotherhood.
The efreet tolerated Jamilas presence but largely resented her, viewing her as nothing more than a foreigner despite her great power over flame magic.
Jamila was believed to be involved in a romantic relationship with her assistant Sefer al-Raq.
