Asilther Graelor was a Harper agent.
Asilther always followed Mintiper Moonsilver, believing she owed her life to him. She preferred spending her time in the wilderness over cities.
Asilther was saved by Mintiper from Calishite slavers. She regained her health but not her memories, remembering only that she was born in the Forest of Tethir.
Asilther was an acquaintance of lady Alustriel of Silverymoon and had many dealings with the Lords of Waterdeep, but very few knew she was an Harper.
Asilther usually performed missions like protecting and guiding some individuals, shadowing or kidnapping others, and killing agents of Luskan and of the Zhentarim.
One of her best exploits was stealing from the hoard of the adult black dragon Shammagar in Melairrin, a fortress beneath Mount Sar north of Waterdeep. Shammagar promised revenge but Asilther discovered the secret name of the dragon thanks to exploits of Mirt.
Among the treasures plundered from the dragon was the Bloodbone Throne of Uruth, which she sent to Heralds Holdfast to be archived (although it never arrived). Later, some said she made peace with the dragon, agreeing to return his hoard. Because of this  Asilther stole from a Luskan ship full of treasures raided in Ruathym and directed it to the new lair of Shammagar.
