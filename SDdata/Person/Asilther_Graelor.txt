'''Asilther Graelor''' was a [[Harper]] agent.

==Personality==
Asilther always followed [[Mintiper Moonsilver]], believing she owed her life to him. She preferred spending her time in the wilderness over cities.

==History==
Asilther was saved by Mintiper from [[Calishite]] slavers. She regained her health but not her memories, remembering only that she was born in the [[Forest of Tethir]].

Asilther was an acquaintance of lady [[Alustriel]] of [[Silverymoon]] and had many dealings with the [[Lords of Waterdeep]], but very few knew she was an Harper.

Asilther usually performed missions like protecting and guiding some individuals, shadowing or kidnapping others, and killing agents of [[Luskan]] and of the [[Zhentarim]].

One of her best exploits was stealing from the hoard of the adult [[black dragon]] [[Shammagar]] in [[Melairrin]], a fortress beneath [[Mount Sar]] north of [[Waterdeep]].{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|14}} Shammagar promised revenge but Asilther discovered the secret name of the dragon thanks to exploits of [[Mirt]].

Among the treasures plundered from the dragon was the ''[[Bloodbone Throne of Uruth]]'', which she sent to [[Herald's Holdfast]] to be archived (although it never arrived).{{Cite dragon/351/Volo's Guide: Lost Regalia of the North: The Toppled Thrones|73}} Later, some said she made peace with the dragon, agreeing to return his hoard. Because of this  Asilther stole from a Luskan ship full of treasures raided in [[Ruathym]] and directed it to the new lair of Shammagar.
