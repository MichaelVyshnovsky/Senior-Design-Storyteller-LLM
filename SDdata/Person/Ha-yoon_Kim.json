        "Description": "Ha-yoon's name and appearance suggested a [[Kara-Tur]]an descent. She hid her hair under a maroon coif and wore a [[corset]], with a simple white ribbon for decoration around her neck.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in the [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of Baldur's Gate, displacing countless refugees along the way. Pressured by the refugee crisis, Baldur's Gate closed the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge, separating Rivington from other parts of the metropolis and turning it into a refugee tent city. Unlike many other inhabitants of Rivington, Ha-yoon Kim thought the looming threat of [[the Absolute]] to be nothing to worry about. She placed her trust in Lord [[Enver Gortash]] and his capability and desire to protect the Baldurians."
