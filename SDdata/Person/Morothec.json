        "mainbody": "Morothec was a cambion in service to the pit fiend Kurgaloth.\nMorothec could be quite charming, but was quick to anger when bested.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Morothec was one of many devils brought to the Lightfinger Estate in Waterdeep to enforce a lapsed infernal contract between Kurgaloth and the Lightfinger family.\nWhen adventurers arrived at the Lightfinger Estate to investigate the chaos that the devils arrival had caused, Morothec battled them inside the opulent mansion at the Estates center, and ended up fleeing when their victory became clear."
