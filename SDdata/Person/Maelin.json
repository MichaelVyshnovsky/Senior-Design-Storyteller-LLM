Guarded by Radu's [[vampire]] brother, [[Stannis Malveen|Stannis]], she was kept for months while Radu ransomed Eckert's knowledge of the [[Uskevren]]s for his daughter's life.\n\nShe was rescued by Talbot, [[Chaney Foxmantle]], [[Darrow]], and [[Feena Archwood]] in [[Tarsakh]] of 1371 DR, though Chaney lost his life in the process.<ref>",
