'''Pelek''' was a [[deep gnome]] of [[Blingdenstone]] and a [[ghost]] in [[Gracklstugh]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Pelek lived in Blingdenstone until he met [[Buppido]]. He fell in with him and followed him to Gracklstugh. There, however, he discovered that Buppido was a mad killer, and Buppido killed Pelek. Some time after, probably because of the energies unleashed by the [[demon lord]]s ''circa'' [[1486 DR]], he rose again as a [[ghost]] in Buppido's lair. He could only be given peace if someone took his remains back to his hometown and buried them there.
