Roabrel Mememitur was a greasy Calishite fixer inhabiting Tulmon along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
As a "fixer," Roabrel used both sides of the law to get things done for merchants. He was quite skilled at his job, despite being generally disliked by those who sought his services. He had plenty of enemies, but his usefulness in Tulmon kept the daggers at bay.
