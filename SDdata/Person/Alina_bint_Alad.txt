Alina bint Alad was a member of the royal family of Medina al-Afyal in 1367 DR.
Alina was intense and passionate, especially regarding her study of magic.
Since her older brother Alakbar was lost at sea and presumed dead, Alina was the only surviving heir of the Padishah Alad and likely the next ruler of the island kingdom of Afyal.
