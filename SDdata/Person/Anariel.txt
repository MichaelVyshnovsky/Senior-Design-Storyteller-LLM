'''Anariel''' was an individual who gave the elven [[longbow]] ''[[Taulmaril]]'' and a [[quiver of Anariel]] to [[Clan Battlehammer]]. She had the title "Sister of [[Faerûn]]".<ref group="note">Though [[Catti-brie]] names her "Lady Anariel", it is not clear if she truly holds the title "Lady".

==History==
Anariel once gifted the bow ''Taulmaril'' and a [[quiver of Anariel|quiver of endless arrows]] to Clan Battlehammer at [[Mithril Hall]].<ref group="note">There is not yet any evidence that Anariel invented or created the [[quiver of Anariel]], only that the one in Catti-brie's possession is named for her. It may be that this is only a particular example of a [[quiver of plenty]].

In [[1356 DR]], the [[Companions of the Hall]] explored the ruins of Mithril Hall and [[Regis]] discovered Taulmaril and the quiver in a crack in a stone wall. They gave both quiver and bow to [[Catti-brie]], and she went on to use both in many battles.{{Cite web/The Lone Drow: Companions of the Hall}}
