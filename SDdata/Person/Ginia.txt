Ginia was a courtesan under Lady Galvena in Brynnlaw and sister to Ason in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She was a young girl who was driven out of her home, and forced into prostitution.
Ginia was raised in Brynnlaw since birth. Her mother died very early on, whilst her father was a tailor. Early on, she lived off fish and other produce from Brynnlaw, and was offered employment at the Spellhold asylum. 
After the occupation of her village by Desharik, her father tried to re-enter their home. He was sentenced to death for breaking the law set out by the pirate king. Desharik told the newly orphaned girl that she had to pay for her fathers crime, as his death wasnt enough. She was given to Chremy, his lieutenant as a reward for his service.
She was put to work as a courtesan against her well, to cater for drunken pirates. If she refused, Chremy threatened to slaughter he brother. The only way she could escape the island was to be smuggled out.
It was rumored that Ginia and her brother were eventually smuggled out of the island by Calahan. He agreed to take them to Ulgoths Beard, for a fee, where they would be raised by a woman named Therella.
