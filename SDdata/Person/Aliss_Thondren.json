        "History": "Aliss Thondren's most notable legacy was inventing the term \"sneak-coins\". The term became a common slang that referred to Sembian cabals, organizations, or even syndicates that were trying to wrestle control over [[Cormyr]]ean businesses and economy via bribery, blackmail, and other illicit ways of changing minds of government officials or noble houses representatives.\n\nThe term was still in use in [[Cormyr]] by the royal [[War Wizards]] as of [[1348 DR]]."
