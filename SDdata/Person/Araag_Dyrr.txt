'''Araag Dyrr''' was a member of [[House Agrach Dyrr]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] in [[1373 DR]].

==History==
Araag graduated from [[Sorcere]] at an unknown time.

During the siege of Dyrr's compound for their betrayal of [[Menzoberranzan]] during the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]], Araag was called back to his house together with all other Dyrr wizards to help raise magical defenses.
