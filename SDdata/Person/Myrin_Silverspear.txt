Myrin Silverspear was an innkeeper in Evereska in 1359 DR.
Myrin managed the Halfway Inn just outside the Gate Glen of Evereska.
The inn acted as Evereskas western outpost. In case of emergency, Myrin could pass messages to Erlan Duirsar via scrolls carried by a polite gray dove.
A silent and dour individual, Myrin was an efficient innkeeper. He saw everything inside the inn and always mediated disputes with discretion. He never spoke about his past as an adventurer. Myrin never forgot a face.
Once, Myrin was a captain of the palace guard in Evermeet (presumably from House Silverspear). He moved to the mainland after assassination of King Zaor, secretly involved in protecting the elfgate connected to Arilyns moonblade.
Rumors said that Myrin was a Harper or a disgraced member of the ruling family of Evereska.
