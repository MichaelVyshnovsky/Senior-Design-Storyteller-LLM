'''Myrin Silverspear''' was an innkeeper in [[Evereska]] in [[1359 DR]].

==Activities==
Myrin managed the [[Halfway Inn]] just outside the [[Gate Glen]] of Evereska.

The inn acted as Evereska's western outpost. In case of emergency, Myrin could pass messages to [[Erlan Duirsar]] via scrolls carried by a polite gray [[dove]].{{Cite digital book/Elfshadow||19}}

==Personality==
A silent and dour individual, Myrin was an efficient innkeeper. He saw everything inside the inn and always mediated disputes with discretion. He never spoke about his past as an adventurer. Myrin never forgot a face.

==History==
Once, Myrin was a captain of the palace guard in [[Evermeet]] (presumably from [[House Silverspear]]). He moved to the mainland after assassination of King [[Zaor]], secretly involved in protecting the [[elfgate]] connected to [[Arilyn's moonblade]].

==Rumors==
Rumors said that Myrin was a [[Harper]] or a disgraced member of the ruling family of Evereska.
