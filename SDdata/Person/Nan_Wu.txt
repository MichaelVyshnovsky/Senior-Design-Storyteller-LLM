'''Nan Wu''' was a powerful [[wu jen]] in [[Shou Lung]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was affiliated with the [[Tsui Tong]].

==History==
For many years, Nan Wu was the wu jen of the Tsui Tong, surviving many dangers and infighting, until he decided to retire sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1357}}. 

==Activities==
Nan Wu enjoyed spending his time studying his books, relics, and notes inside his library and living a comfortable life far away from the life of the tong. However, his former colleagues occasionally called him out for "one last task" regardless of how much he protested.
