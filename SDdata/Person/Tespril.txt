'''Tespril''' was an apprentice of the [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]] [[Gathlarue]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She had large, dark eyes.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|62-63|3}} Her hair was long, but after her fight with Shandril, her face became disfigured and one half of her head lost most of its hair.

==Personality==
She was a timid person, but not very loyal.

==Activities==
When in camp, she entertained the guards.

==Possessions==
She snatched a ''[[ring of teleportation]]'' from Gathlarue before their encounter with [[Shandril Shessair]].

==Relationships==
She was younger than [[Mairara]], her fellow apprentice under [[Gathlarue]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/02-06 - Women in the Zhentarim}}

==History==
Tespril accompanied Gathlarue and Mairara at [[Marsember]] when they joined the search for ''[[spellfire]]'', hunting down Shandril Shessair.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|170-173|10}}

She survived the fight by using the ''ring of teleportation'' she'd stolen from Gathlarue, though she became badly scarred. Later, she was debriefed regarding the encounter in a meeting with [[Fzoul Chembryl]] and [[Sarhthor]] of the [[Zhentarim]]. The mage slew her at the close of the meeting, on Fzoul's ambiguous direction.
