'''Borlann''' was the leader of [[Ship Rethnor]] and one of the [[High Captains (Luskan)|High Captains]] of the city of [[Luskan]] in [[1450 DR]].

==History==
He was the last lover of the [[Thayan]] [[elf]] [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] but in that year Dahlia decided to terminate their relationship, and as always, she killed Borlann after the separation.

==Possessions==
Borlann was the grandson of [[Kensidan]] and possessed his ''[[Cloak of the Crow]]'', a magic cape that could polymorph a person into a giant crow, which was later taken by Dahlia.
