An '''old hermit''' was a [[monk]] from [[Kara-Tur]] lived outside [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/55/Easy Money|11-12}}
{{quote|Attention to one's task at hand is more enlightening than the dreams of the Emperor.|The old hermit}}

==Home==
He dwelled in a cave in a gorge in the hills near Ravens Bluff. The entrance was flanked with wooden totems carved to depicted [[lung dragon]]s and blocked by a wooden portcullis, painted bright red. In the late 1350s DR, hunters seeking a golden [[cave bear]] placed bear traps along the gorge, making it difficult to reach. Inside, he had a only a shrine lit by [[candle]]s, a straw sleeping math, and some food in bag.

His neighbors included [[giant scorpion]]s, the ghosts of two [[bandit]]s betrayed by one [[Bork]], and the [[werebear]] [[Zarin Marblehead]], who was the source of the golden cave bear sightings.

==Personality==
With not much in the way of social skills, the hermit was aloof and detached and spoke in a monotonous manner. However, if questioned, he would dispense a wide variety of religious precepts, wise aphorisms, and common sayings, usually in exchange for food.

==Abilities==
A highly trained monk, the old hermit was immune to all [[poison]]s; highly resistance to ''[[charm]]'', ''[[hypnosis]]'', and ''[[suggestion]]'' [[spell]]s; and little harmed by injurious [[magic]].

==History==

In the late 1350s DR, [[adventurer]]s sought to capture the golden cave bear for [[Jack Mooney]] for his [[Jack Mooney & Sons Circus|circus]] may have met and questioned the old hermit for clues, if they could sift through his many sayings.
