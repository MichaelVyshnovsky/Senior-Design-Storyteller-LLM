Embril the Indentifier was a wizard inhabiting Suldolphor in the far eastern reaches of Calimshan in south Faer√ªn during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Embril was paranoid and complained alot. His paranoia caused him to cover his quaint home with deadly traps.
He appeared to be older than he actually was.
Embril earned a living by using his magic to identifiy magical and mundane properties of magic items for others. Embril entertained himself by using his skills to eavesdrop on others, especially adventurers.
