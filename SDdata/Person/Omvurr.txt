Omvurr was a goblin chieftain and warlord inhabiting the fortress of Omvudurth in the Sunrise Mountains of southern Rashemen during the late 14 century DR.
Omvurr claimed the entire expanse of the Mulsanyaar Plateau as his domain, but in reality his fear of the Rashemaar berserkers kept his forces from rarely creeping forth from Omvudurth.
