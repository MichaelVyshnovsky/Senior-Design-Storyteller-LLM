Pol was the beloved Chief Houndmaster of the Durinbold patriar family of Baldurs Gate, who died sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.
In life, Pol had long wavy hair and wore a trimmed beard.
He used a crossbow in battle, in life and as a ghost.
Pols sarcophagus held a magic scroll of the animal friendship spell and a potion of animal speaking.
By the , Chief Houndmaster Pol was long dead and interred within the Durinbold Mausoleum of the Lower City Graveyard, surrounded by the interred bodies of his favorite beasts, Gordis, Rocky, and Zina. The trainer and his three dogs were ghosts that would attack anyone who dared to invade and disturb the Durinbold family tombs.
