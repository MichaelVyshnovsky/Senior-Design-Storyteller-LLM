        "mainbody": "'''Ptolnec''' was a captain in the city guard of [[Innarlith]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He had black hair and soft pale skin.",
        "Relationships": "His father was a wealthy senator in Innarlith.",
        "History": "Ptolnec was a lieutenant in Innarlith's city guard by the {{YearlinkName|1334}}. [[Pristoleph]], the future Ransar of Innarlith, was a soldier under his command at the time. Pristoleph was helping to operate a brothel at [[Firesteap Citadel]] with the [[prostitute]] [[Nyla]] at the time and he was caught by Lieutenant Ptolnec who threatened to discipline him. However, embarrassingly for Ptolnec, the captain of the guard came out of the tent as Ptolnec was threatening Pristoleph for running this brothel, and the captain then ordered Ptolnec to go in the tent after him to take his own turn and pay the lady for her services.\n\nAfterward, he did not advance very much in his service in the city guard. In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, he had the rank of captain. At the time, the city was engaged in a project for the reconstruction of the city walls and had invited a [[Cormyr|Cormyrean]] engineer named [[Willem Korvan]] for the project. Ptolnec noticed Willem making errors in his calculations and ordered him to do them again. Willem then got the master-builder [[Inthelph]] to use his influence with other senators of Innarlith to have Ptolnec removed to a faraway post in the mountains.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was rumored that he was very unhappy about inheriting his family's fortune very late and being unable to advance to the rank of senator in the city-state."
