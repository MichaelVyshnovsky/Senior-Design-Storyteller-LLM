'''Adolican Rhand''' was a [[Waterdeep]] [[noble]] [[wizard]] who worked for the [[Shadovar]]. 

==History==
Adolican twice crossed paths with the [[warlock]] [[Farideh]], first in search of the secret of the [[Netherese]] [[wizard|arcanist]] [[Tarchamus the Unyielding]] and the second when Farideh was coerced to work for him in a secret Shadovar fortress that housed many captured [[Chosen]]; he was killed during the escape of the chosen from the camp.
