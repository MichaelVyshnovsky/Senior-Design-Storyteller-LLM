        "mainbody": "'''Glarn''' was the [[half-orc]]ish proprietor of the [[Bent Mermaid Inn]] in the city of [[Westgate]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''What is it you're here for? Well? Speak up! Spirits? A room for the night? Talk, maybe? I should warn you that talk is all that's free here.''|Glarn}}",
        "Description": "Glarn was a sturdy broad-shouldered half-orc with a darkly-tanned skin. He wore simple trousers, [[tunic]], and [[boot]]s that had seen some use, all smelled of stale [[grog]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Glarn ran the Bent Mermaid Inn, offering lodgings, strong spirits, [[ale]]s, and [[wine]]s, such as imported [[Thayan Red]] and local [[Brother Tobias' 1368]]. He was happy to chat with guests and tell them of the latest rumors and gossip of Westgate at no additional cost. In 1374 DR, the half-orc shared news of [[Garrett]], a treasure hunter of some renown, discovering a lost subterranean temple under Westgate, [[Okuzo]], the importer of exotic [[Kara-Tur]]an goods being seen roughed up, and of a local loon [[Salty Jack]], who begged for [[coin]] in the [[Harbor Loop]]."
