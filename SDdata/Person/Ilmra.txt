}}'''Ilmra''' was a [[drow]] apprentice wizard in [[Ched Nasad]].

==History==
Ilmra was one of the few female drow who decided to study as a wizard in the [[Arcane Conservatory]]. She was a classmate of [[Q'arlynd Melarn]].

One day, she was about to fail a magic test in reading auras when Q'arlynd suggested the correct answer to her. However, Ilmra, instead of thanking, Q'arlynd reported the event to their instructor, admitting her failure as well.

In [[1379 DR]], Q'arlynd remember her as his first lesson in not trusting anyone.
