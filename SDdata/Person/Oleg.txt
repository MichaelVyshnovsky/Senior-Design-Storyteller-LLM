Oleg was a half-orc smith in Daggerford around 1370 DR.
Oleg was a very able weaponsmith but few in the town trusted a half-orc enough to enter his shop. Mostly, people threw garbage against his windows. Despite this, Oleg was the most patient and calm individual in Daggerford.
Olegs Weaponforge was located in west Daggerford along Rogar Alley and Guild Alley near the drill field.
