        "mainbody": "horn was a lythari adventurer in the mid-to-late 14 century DR and a companion of Liriel Baenre and Sharlarra Vendreth. She was a champion of Eilistraee and a Moon Hunter, able to travel along moonbeams.\nThorn was tall and lithe and appeared much like a moon elf, except for the feral light in her amber eyes. She had dark, raven-colored hair left unbound with a single streak of silver-colored hair, which was a mark of the favor of Eilistraee. She preferred to dress in all black colors, the same color as her pelt in wolf form.\nShe was feral and enjoyed eating fresh (very rare, i.e., raw) meat. She was mostly stone-faced and calm, however, but acted very straightforward and blunt and could easily be considered rude. As a lone lythari, she had no interest in manners and etiquette, and as an outcast follower of Sel√ªne, she had neither patience nor mercy for her and the goddesss enemies. She also had a very high resistance to pain and torture, never compromising herself in the face of danger or agony.\nShe had a longing for companionship, being a loner and an outcast from her pack, and thus joined forces with Liriel Baenre in the Rashemi woods.\nIn the , Thorn followed Fyodor of Rashemen and his companion Liriel Baenre to western Faerun and back at the bequest of his grandmother, Zofia, who had promised to send a Moonhunter to retrieve his body if he fell while on his quest. She helped transport Fyodor and Liriel to Rashemen and, once there, helped them defeat a band of drow led by Gorlist that was pursuing Liriel.\nThorn continued to travel with Liriel and Sharlarra Vendreth for at least ten years. In particular, she developed a bantering friendship with Sharlarra. Circa 1371 DR, she was with the two in Hlammach, Impiltur, serving as hired blades for the Impilturan military.\nShe used a sword and a bow to fight and was quite skilled. With her sword, she could easily match seasoned drow fighters one-on-one.\nShe also used some magic that her goddess granted her, such as transforming a ripped lock of her hair in the drow warrior Gorlists hand into a serpent."
