        "mainbody": "allaher Brym was a scribe refugee from the Rivington neighborhood of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the , as the armies of the Absolute ravaged the Western Heartlands, scribe Gallaher Brym and his family were among countless refugees seeking entrance to Baldurs Gate. The family was not allowed passage through the Wyrms Crossing, forcing them to remain in Rivingtons refugee tent city. Desperate for admission into the closed-off city, Gallaher penned a letter, sent via the Sword Coast Couriers, addressed to Lord Patriar Haverford Gist. The scribe offered his professional services for a mere nominal fee and eternal gratitude if Haverford, renowned for his charitability, would send to word to the Flaming Fists to allow the family enter the city. It was unknown whether Lord Gist responded to the request or even if the letter was ever delivered."
