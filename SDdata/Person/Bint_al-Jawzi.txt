Bint al-Jawzi was a dwarf merchant-rogue living on the various lands of the Great Sea in 1367 DR.
Jawzi was a formidable rubban in a profession dominated by men, humans, and elves.
Jawzi owned a footmans mace +4 and a scarab of protection (cloaked wizardry).
It was widely rumored that Jawzi was so skilled as a captain because she was the offspring of a marid. She neither confirmed nor denied this rumor.
