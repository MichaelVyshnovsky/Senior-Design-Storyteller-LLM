Golozz the Greedy was an ancient red dragon who resided at a smugglers dock a few miles south of Waterdeep.
The ancient red was known for his excessive greed, and would make smugglers pay him tribute for every load of illicit goods that were brought in. Golozz lived in the southeastern part of the dock, and was the real power of the area. However, he guaranteed that the activities of the bootleggers would remain undisturbed.
Even the presence of Golozz made the smugglers of the region tremble, as he threatened them with death if they did not bring him tribute. Golozz often roared extremely loudly throughout the night. They worked hard to appease the red dragon, as they knew that, if they did not, Golozz would burn the docks to the ground. Apparently his thirst for gold was so much, it was impossible to use logic with him.
Golozz, being an ancient red, was a powerful foe. He caused his enemies to flee in fear, was able to see invisible creatures, and breathed fire.
He owned a huge treasure hoard. Among his hoard was the unique redflame armor and a magical mace.
In 1358 DR, the Heroes of Ascore stumbled across Golozz the Greedy, who was very frustrated to see they had not brought him treasure. He challenged the famed adventurers to battle, and the ancient dragon was cut down.
