Omgar was a great sea drake who lived in the Great Sea along the peninsula named for himâ€“the Snout of Omgar.
Omgar laired in a cave on the peninsulas southern tip in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. Omgar exacted heavy tolls on passing ships depending on his mood. Most of the sailors would rather pay his toll that risk bypassing his lair and foundering on the Beacon Rocks nearby.
It was unknown what became of Omgar after the peninsula that bore his home was split apart from Chult following the Spellplague, and transformed into an isle onto itself.
