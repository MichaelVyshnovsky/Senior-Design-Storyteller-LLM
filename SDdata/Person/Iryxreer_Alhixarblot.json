        "History": "Iryxreer always tried to gain possession of the [[Circle of Swords]] spell but was always repulsed by its unique magical [[construct]] guardian, the [[Floating Face]], or by rival alhoons that also wanted the spell.\n\nIn the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], somehow the Circle of Swords activated, calling to it some adventurers via their dreams. Iryxreer sent all its troops against the adventurers, sensing it was the right time to acquire the spell.",
