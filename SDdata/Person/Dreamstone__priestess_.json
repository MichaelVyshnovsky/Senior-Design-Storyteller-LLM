        "mainbody": "'''Dreamstone''' was the only name known of a [[priestess]] of [[Mystryl]] and a creator of [[spell]]s from the ancient empire of [[Netheril]].",
        "History": "Dreamstone lived in the days of the ancient Netheril. She enrolled aid from the clerics of the Church of [[Jannath]] to help her create several powerful earth-based spells. In gratitude, she created a powerful [[enchanted]] item she simply gave her own name â€“ the ''[[Dreamstone]]''. The ''stone'' was to be used by the Church of Jannath to protect itself from everyone who wished the clergy harm. Dreamstone also created a unique type of spell that allowed two individuals to communicate through imagery and symbolism in their dreams. It was believed that the ''Dreamstone'' artifact was imbued with the same type of dream magic. However, the ways of activating it were thought lost or completely speculative. Dreamstone's ''Dreamstone'' survived into the late 14{{th}} century, securing her magical legacy."
