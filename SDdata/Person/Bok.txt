'''Bok''' was a powerful [[flesh golem]] manufactured by [[Dendybar|Dendybar the Mottled]], a [[wizard]] and the guardian of the northern spire in the [[Host Tower of the Arcane|Hosttower of the Arcane]] in the seaport city of [[Luskan]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, Dendybar sent Bok alongside the wizard [[Sydney]] and the soldier [[Jierdan]] in search of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] with the hopes of acquiring [[Crenshinibon]]. Bok was destroyed by Drizzt during a vicious fight near [[Mithral Hall]]. Afterward, Dendybar [[teleport]]ed near the golem with the aim of recovering and reconstructing it. However, the spirit of [[Morkai the Red]], a dead foe of Dendybar who was killed and enslaved as a spirit by the wizard, regained control of the remains of the golem and killed Dendybar.
