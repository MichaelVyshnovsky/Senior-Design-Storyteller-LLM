While in human form she was taller than average for the race and had copper-colored skin, round golden eyes, and long metallic auburn hair that ran down to her knees.\nTyrangal knew a wide variety of psionic powers, which she used as though she was an egoist. Her known psionic powers included the following\nbody adjustment, claws of the bear, conceal thoughts, daze, dimension door, displacement, ego whip, empathy, false sensory input, far hand, finger of fire, glorytongue, id insinuation, knock, mental barrier, mind blast, mind thrust, missive, my light, psychic crush, psychofeedback, remote viewing, thought shield, tower of iron will, unseen servant, and verve.\nThe most notable of these powers was glorytongue, the namesake of her more familiar nickname, which she used alongside remote viewing and unseen servant to steal gems and magic items from others.\nWhile in her human form Tyrangal typically wore a rust-colored, silk robe that was embroidered with runes.\nTyrangal was a friend and mentor to the rogue Duvan.\nTyrangal was known as Gaulauntyr prior to the Spellplague."
