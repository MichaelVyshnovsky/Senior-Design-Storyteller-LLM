Several months after her disappearance, Tryola resurfaced after being kidnapped by a band of [[orc]]s and held in an ancient prison complex within [[Undermountain]]. The rescuer was a lone hero, tasked by [[Khelben Arunsun]] with investigating the  prison and its connection to the brewing [[drow]] plot against Waterdeep."
