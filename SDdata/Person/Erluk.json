        "mainbody": "'''Erluk''' was one of the [[Blades of the Old Man]] as of {{yearlink|1374}}. He was a pale-haired man who favored the [[rapier]]. On the night of [[Tarsakh 25]], when the intruder alarm was sprung at the [[Fortress of the Old Man]], he and five others sought to see to the [[Old Man of the Mountain]]'s safety. They came across [[Talieth]] and [[Sauk]] in the process; protesting that their place was by the Old Man. Sauk, Talieth and her guards killed them in response.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||30}}"
