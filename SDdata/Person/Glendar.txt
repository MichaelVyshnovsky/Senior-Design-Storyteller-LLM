Glendar was a wizard, and later lich.
Glendar was known to be a rather good and noble man in life.
Glendar spent much of his life serving as a patron for adventurers.
The wizards hatred of basilisks and medusae led him to develop the rod of mirrors, also known as a wand of magical mirrors, and went on to create twenty of them.
Later in life Glendar turned towards evil and became a lich.
His rods of mirrors continued to survive across the Realms following his destruction, falling into treasure caches or coming into the possession of powerful wizards.
