==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Ressamon was among the phaerimm's forces that took over the depths of the [[Irithlium]] in ruined [[Myth Drannor]]. On [[Mirtul 19]] that year, the [[Vaasan]] warrior [[Vala Thorsdotter]] ventured into the Irithlium's dungeons by the grace of the [[baelnorn]] [[Corineus Drannaeken]] many of their [[bugbear]] and [[beholder]] minions, and decapitated the unfortunate Ressamon.
