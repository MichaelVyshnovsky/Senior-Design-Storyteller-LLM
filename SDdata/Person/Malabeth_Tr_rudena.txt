Malabeth Trrudena was a drow priestess and a member of the She-Spider Cult.
Malabeth wore a metallic bikini and a white loincloth, and accessorized with various chains and white feathers. She had pure black skin and white hair.
She owned a pair of bracers of defense, as well as a necklace of prayer beads and twin daggers of venom.
Although she was a member of the She-Spider Cult, an organization forsaken by both Lolth and Shar, Malabeth still retained her divine powers. As a result, it was suspected that she was a spy for Lolth.
