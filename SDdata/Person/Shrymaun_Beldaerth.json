        "mainbody": "hrymaun Beldaerth was a priest of Ilmater and the leader of the House of Holy Suffering in Mussum circa 1265 DR. He held the title \"Exalted Sufferer\".\nAround 1265 DR, the House of Holy Suffering had come into possession of the Tome of Torment, considered the holiest book of the Church of Ilmater. The Spontaer, the senior Sage-Priest of the church, prayed to Ilmater for nearly a year and sacrificed himself to place powerful magical protections on the Tome. Although the Spontaer had explicitly requested that the Tome of Torment be delivered to the House of the Broken God in Keltar in Calimshan, the greatest temple of Ilmater, Shrymaun Beldaerth denied the Spontaers wishes and refused to relinquish it.\nArchsufferer Bloirt Waelarn of the Keltar house declared all those of the \"degenerate\" Mussum house \"heretics\" and called for them to be cast out and treated as mentally ill. The Mussum house recruited the Companions of the Noble Heart paladin order to their defense, and a holy war ensued over the artifact.\nCategoryPriests and priestesses\nCategoryPriests of Ilmater\nCategoryWorshipers of Ilmater\nCategoryInhabitants of the House of Holy Suffering\nCategoryInhabitants of Mussum\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vilhon Reach\nCategoryInhabitants of Interior Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryMales\nmk27l2lc6zcz8voqo5ms6i5pygxswp3"
