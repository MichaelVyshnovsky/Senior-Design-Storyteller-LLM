Pierstar Hallowhand was a commander of the Maces of Elversult who served the city during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Pierstar had an intimidating presence, with hard-set eyes, a strong jaw, and a powerful moustache.
In most instances, Pierstar was a good judge of character, a trait that was highly valued by his superior in the Maces.
He had a good mind for tactics and led his men bravely in battle. He was not one to leave an ally without support, no matter the danger involved.
He regularly worked with Lady Constable Vaerana Hawklyn, who lead all law enforcement in Elversult.
In the , Pierstar worked with Lady Vaerana and hew new Harper ally Ruha to work against the efforts of the Dragon Cult cell in Pros, and their patron dracolich Hethcypressarvil. As they began working together, Pierstar helped escort the Bedine sorceress Ruha safely from Pros, fighting off the Dragon Cultists during their short journey.
Later on when Hethcypressarvil assailed the city of Elversult, Pierstar led the Maces in a daring charge against the undead dragon. After the dragons form was defeated, and lay dormant in Hillshadow Lake, Pierstar led the Maces in a final stand against the being at Baldagar Manor, holding it at bay with ballistae and arrow fire until it could be finally destroyed one and for all by Ruha and her magic.
