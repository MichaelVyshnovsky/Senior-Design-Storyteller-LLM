        "mainbody": "Miraun () was a male human enchanter and the \"diplomat at large\" for Zhentil Keep and the Zhentarim in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.\nAs required in his job, Miraun was an intelligent and charming person. Although he was quite competent, Fzoul Chembryl disliked him, and as Fzoul rose in power, Mirauns position declined. Miraun couldnt think why Manshoon tolerated Fzoul in the Zhentarim. He considered doing more work with Darkhold.\nMiraun usually traveled as an ambassador for Zhentil Keep, in which capacity he reported to various heads of state the official position of the Zhentarim.\nMiraun was a long-standing member of the Zhentarim and was their official envoy. In 1370 DR, his position began to decline as a result of Fzouls dislike and own rise in status. Only his competent ambassadorial service shielded him from the worst consequences.\nMiraun was a bastard son of the noble Zhent Dannacaster family."
