        "mainbody": "'''The Winged''' was a [[dark planetar|fallen]] [[planetar]] that dwelled on the [[Prime Material plane]], in the nation of [[Thay]] on [[Toril]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was once a servant of [[Torm]], the God of Duty, before her downfall.\n\n{{Quote|No true Tormite would ever abandon her duty! The souls of Hedasha Gorge shall never be forgotten.|A deva dispatched to eliminate The Winged.}}",
        "Personality": "The Winged was a guarded and personal individual who seldom spoke to anyone other than [[Dennaton]], the operator of a gladiatorial arena in Thay, and members of her mercenary company, the [[Planar Hunters]]. She always ensured she was paid in full, and exactly on time according to her schedule.",
        "Possessions": "Among her other possessions, the Winged wore a single, ''[[The Winged's gauntlet|unique gauntlet]]'' that granted her exceptional power in combat. The powerful armored glove could be worn by no one else but her.",
        "Relationships": "The Winged led the mercenaries known as the [[Planar Hunters]]. Among its members were the [[admaantine golem]] [[Bannor Kaxazel]], an [[efreeti]] by the name of [[Dormamus]], the bard [[Joker]], the [[Red Wizard]] [[Pol Pyrrus]], and a [[fire salamander]] called [[Thassk Kun]].\n\nBy all appearances, the Winged and her mercenaries worked under the employ of Dennaton. In truth, they were employed by [[Szass Tam]], the [[Thay]]an [[zulkir]] of [[necromancy]], during his campaign against his rival [[Aznar Thrul]].",
        "Activities": "For some time during her existence, the Winged fought as a champion in the [[Blood War]]. It was not clear if she fought for the [[baatezu]] of the [[Nine Hells]], or somehow aligned herself with the [[demon]]s of [[the Abyss]].\n\nDuring her time on Toril, the Winged and the other Hunters served Dennaton by capturing powerful combatants and fearsome beasts and perilous entities that would serve as gladiators in Dennaton's arena. They also acted as enforcers, to ensure the fighters remained subservient between their matches. Among the powers subdued by the Winged and her mercenaries were [[illithid]]s, [[fiend]]s from the [[lower planes]], the [[dragon]] [[Yllaxxia]] and her offspring, and even two [[Bhaalspawn|children]] of the god [[Bhaal]], [[Enegar]] and [[Kastulor]].",
        "History": "Before her fall, the Winged was a servant of the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian god]] [[Torm]], who resided within [[Mount Celestia]].\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, The Winged and the Planar Hunters were dispatched by Dennaton to abduct the [[Champion of Baeloth's Pit]] after their victory in the [[Black Pits]] within the [[Underdark]]. The Champion was one of many combatants selected to bolster the popularity of Dennaton's arena.\n\nWhen the group known as [[Raskilov's Ragers]] attempted to rebel against Dennaton, The Winged dispatched them with a single ''[[Comet (spell)|comet]]''. \n\nSome time later, Dennation pitted the Champion of Baeloth's Pit against a squad of [[falen deva|fallen]] [[astral deva|astral]] and [[monadic deva]]s led by [[Ariziel]].They held a particular and personal hatred for the Winged.\n\nWhen the Winged and the Hunters were ordered to gather a [[tarrasque]] to fight in the arena, and Dennaton remained distracted with other fights, the Champion of Baeloth's Pit orchestrated an uprising of their own. The Winged and the Hunters proved unsuccessful, but managed to survive the encounter. The fallen planeter and her allies and were summoned back to the arena to combat the Champion and other rebellious slaves."
