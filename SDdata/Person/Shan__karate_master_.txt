Shan was a human Karate Master and a hero active in the 14 century DR.
Shan was a master martial artist whose unarmed battle prowess knew no bounds, being doubly effective compared to his peers. However, Shan hated all forms of magic and refused to weave spells or utilize enchanted items. His disdain for magic was so intense, it seemed as if Shan grew more powerful the more magic was used against him in battle.
