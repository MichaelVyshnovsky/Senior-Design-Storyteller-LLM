He wore a foundry workers uniform and a smiths apron, often covered in soot, dirt, and sweat.\nIn the , the Gondian foundry of Baldurs Gate was usurped by Enver Gortash and his cultists of Bane. Droo Falbo and other Gondians were forced to work on forging the Lords steel watchers. Their families and loved ones were abducted and held hostage to encourage obedience, and all of the workers were outfitted with incineration collars  controlled by Prinskis Motivators.\nWith the Absolute crisis unfolding in Baldurs Gate, the fate of the Gondians remained unconfirmed. It was possible for all of the hostages and foundry workers to perish, or be saved along with their loved ones by the group of heroes known as the Absolute Adversaries."
