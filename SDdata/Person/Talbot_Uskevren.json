        "mainbody": "'''Talbot Uskevren''' was the youngest of three children from the noble [[Uskevren]] family of [[Selgaunt]] and an actor in [[Quickly|Mistress Quickly]]'s theater acts in the [[Wide Realms]] around [[1370 DR]].",
        "Abilities": "A warrior of moderate skill, he preferred to play the swashbuckling type in his plays, using flashy and fancy acrobatic moves.",
        "Description": "Talbot was tall and muscular, with thick black hair and beard and gray eyes.<ref>",
        "History": "At age nineteen, Talbot was infected with [[lycanthropy]] while on a hunting trip with his closest friend, [[Chaney Foxmantle]], and various other nobles. Chaney and others managed to escape, but Talbot was not so fortunate. He was found by [[Maleva]] and [[Feena Archwood]], two priestesses of [[Selûne]], and was healed of the wounds suffered in the attack, but not the affliction, by Maleva.",
        "Relationships": "Talbot was the youngest son of [[Thamalon Uskevren|Thamalon]] and [[Shamur Uskevren]], preceded by [[Thamalon Uskevren II|Tamlin]] and [[Thazienne Uskevren|Thazienne]].\n[[File:Dragon273-p71-Talbot Uskevren-Carl Critchlow.png|thumb|right|275px|''Tal, striking a rakish pose.'']]\n\nEven before the revelation that he was related to Larajin—who was a family servant at the time—Tal always treated her more like a sister than a servant. When Tal turned six and they were no longer allowed to play together, they made a pact to always be friends, even if it was just in secret."
