She was a little tyrannical, always focused on work and did not suffer fools. Her men believed her incapable of smiling or laughing.\nAudra was a rising officer in the Watch.\nIn 1491 DR, Audra led a City Watch patrol that found the corpse of a strange creature that had emerged from the sewers. She hired an adventuring party to investigate the matter."
