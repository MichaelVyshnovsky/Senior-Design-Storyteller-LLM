Galinda Raventree Amcathra (born Galinda Nimune Alandra Raventree) was a socialite among the nobility of Waterdeep during the 14 century DR. A member of the Raventree family, she was one of the most desired ladies of the city until her marriage to Regnet Amcathra in the .
Lady Galinda took after her mother, inheriting her slim build, high cheekbones, and large eyes. She was graceful in bearing and frequently wore the latest fashions that showed off her figure (which was more full and rounded than her mothers).
Galinda was anything but shy and used her husky voice, attractive figure, and revealing fashions to great advantage in the high-society circles in which she swam like a flirtatious shark. Casual affairs and dalliances were all part of the gossip game that she played to win.
Every year, Lady Galinda hosted the annual costume ball at the familys villa in the North Ward of the city.
Galindas main social rival among the Waterdhavian aristocracy was Myrna Cassalanter.
