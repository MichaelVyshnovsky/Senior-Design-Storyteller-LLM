'''Urboltar Highmyelver''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|531}} to {{yearlink|537}}. He was driven insane by his scrying.

==Appearance==
He was a nondescript man of middling height.

==Personality==
Urboltar was ambitious and ruthless. By the end of his tenure, however, he was consumed by madness.

==Abilities==
He cast the ''[[spellseeking worm]]'' that led him to [[Tsjancy Yildree]]. He never gained the power to compel anyone to do anything, though he sought it.

==History==
At the time of slaying the previous [[Magister]], Urboltar schemed to control Faer√ºn by compelling hordes of [[orc]]s to destroy whatever stood in his way.

Before his schemes could come to fruition, however, he came into possession of an enchanted full-body mirror. The visions in the mirror, those of three black cloaked figures with flowing, changing, elongated limbs, haunted him for the rest of his days, rendering all his nights sleepless. He was wracked by hallucinations and rendered an erratic, irresponsive, dangerous wreck. He murmured when found by [[Tyvbolt Arsurath]] and screamed, but did not fight back.

==Rumors & Legends==
The nature of his visions was a subject of debate, alternatively interpreted as [[malaugrym]], [[Imaskari]] mages trapped in the mirror, or others.

Urboltar and the consequences of his scrying were remembered in the popular ballad, ''[[Ever is Weather]]''.
