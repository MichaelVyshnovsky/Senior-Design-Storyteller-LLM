        "mainbody": "'''Baurthaglos''', more commonly known as '''Anglaspark''', was a [[blue dragon]] son of the blue [[dragon aging|wyrm]] ruler of [[Turmish]], [[Anaglathos]].",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Anglaspark was an adult dragon who inhabited the secluded and untamed [[Orsraun Mountains]]. The blue dragon shared the region with only one other known dragonâ€”a [[red dragon|red wyrm]] named [[Emberspeak]]. Anglaspark was a spawn of the infamous blue dragon Anaglathos, who claimed rulership of Turmish in the {{YearlinkName|1242}}. Even though Baurthaglos's activities in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] were limited to devouring fat Turmite [[cattle]] and occasional raids on the city of [[Orbrekh]], some sages theorized that he might be harboring a grudge over Anaglathos's death or even schemed a takeover of Turmish. However, neither of these two suppositions had any evidence to support them."
