Valerios was a success adventurer in his youth; it's said that he slew also an avatar of one of the [[Mulhorand]] god-king; now Valerios was retired and appointed tharchion. Valerios as tharchion had participation in all outfitting shop in the city and thank to it he had a close eye to strangers and adventurers in his city.
Usually he taxed the adventures back in city with a big treasure of some of the most prized objects but many [[Red Wizard]]s knowing his hobby arrived to reclaim for themselves the objects.
