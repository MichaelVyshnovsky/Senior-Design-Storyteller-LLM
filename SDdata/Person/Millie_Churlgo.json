        "mainbody": "'''Millie Churlgo''' was the matriarch of the family that produced the infamous [[Churlgo Cheese]] in the [[Eastern Farmlands]] of [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].\n\n{{quote|We halflings can we valorous when it counts, friend.|Millie Churlgo}}",
        "Description": "Millie Churlgo had a soft pleasant voice and friendly demeanor. Even though a tough business woman, she was approachable and a pleasant conversationalist. She had wavy long black hair, decorated with black beret. She wore a bright blue coat.\n\nShe was used to passerby merchants and tourists paying visit to the family farm. Millie happily greeted the visitors and offered them samples of fresh Churlgo Cheese.",
        "Relationships": "Millie often came to head butting with her disgruntled son [[Porto Churlgo]] who wanted the family to produce grains and beef cattle rather than cheese, with many local cheese-making competitors.\n\n[[Yentai]], the extortionist, claimed that the successes of the Churlgo Cheese brand came from Millie's ruthlessness and utilization of Yentai's assassination skills, getting rid of competitors. However, these claims were likely false as the man was unreliable and conniving, wanting to take over Millie's business at whatever the cost.",
        "History": "Churlgo were cheese-makers for several generations, starting with Millie Churlgo's great great grandfather, [[Garrith Churlgo]], who switched from growing grains to making dairy products back when the farm was operating out of the [[Dalelands]]. Millie Churlgo was the woman in control of the family cheese-making business. Under her leadership, Churlgo Cheese found a distributor in [[Gillian's Hill]] who sold the halflings' peculiar product all along the [[Sword Coast]].\n\nEventually, Millie's cheesy business was targeted by the [[Iron Throne]] who started increasing taxes on Churlgo Cheese until the halflings were unable to pay. Yentai, the corrupt Iron Throne agent, was attempting to extort the recipe out of Millie Churlgo; however, she never budged. Yentai attempted to crack the cheese recipe himself, but Millie moved the family enterprise to the [[Eastern Farmlands]] of [[Daggerford]]. Before she left, however, the halfling matriarch left Yentai a parting gift, an altered Churlgo Cheese recipe. The extortionist cooked up a batch of the cheese and served it to the Iron Throne dignitaries without tasting it first. The scandal that ensued came to be known as the \"Suzail Cheese Incident.\" \n\nSometime ''circa'' 1372 DR, the family prospered in the new region. However, the family's reputation started to deteriorate. The cheese quality was suffering as the farm faced financial strains; Churlgos started using lower quality ingredients for their product. The family operations came under assault from constant bandit attacks on Churlgo Cheese led by Yentai of the Iron Throne, who followed the family from the Dalelands to Daggerford.\n\nMillie's luck turned around when the [[Hero of Daggerford]] offered to join her disgruntled son Porto Churlgo in transporting a shipment of Churlgo Cheese to Gillian's Hill. On the road, the [[ox]]-pulled cheese cart was ambushed by a group of thugs. They were confused by the presence of an armed guard. After the fight, the Hero found a note from Yentai that instructed the bandits to escort the shipment to Gillian's Hill. When the cheese reached the hamlet, [[Sejellus Krimp]], the cheese distributor, revealed that the cheese shipments had been delivered by random people instead of the halflings, including the shipments that were thought lost in bandit raids. Eventually, it was revealed that Porto Churlgo worked with Yentai, who opened up a store in Gillian's Hill and was behind the stolen cheese shipments. The agent of the Iron Throne received shipments from Porto and simply sold them to Sejellus as if nothing was out of order, while Millie's farm suffered from the lost coin.\n\nWhen Millie Churlgo was informed by the Hero of Daggerford of her son's betrayal, she saw no other option but to eliminate Yentai. Otherwise, he was unlikely ever to stop hounding her family. With deep sadness in her heart, she decided to exile Porto from the family as he nearly cost them their livelihood and their very lives. Millie asked the Hero of Daggerford to confront the agent of the Iron Throne and offered to pay them handsomely. When the adventurer faced Yentai, he attempted to offer the alternative outcome for this conflict. He had a barge ready to pick up the halfling family as they were sure to flee from the Iron Throne's wrath were the Hero to fail the assassination. The barge was to be staffed with assassins - to slaughter the Churlgos.\n\nAccounts of the assassination's outcome varied. Some claimed that the halfling family was murdered and Yentai took over the Churlgo Cheese business, while others believed that the Hero followed through on his promise and slain the extortionist and his two bodyguards. One thing was clear, however, the famous Churlgo Cheese production did not stop."
