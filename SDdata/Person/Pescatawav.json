        "History": "Pescatawav was selected in 1488 DR to be central link of the hive mind.\n\n[[Kimmuriel Oblodra]] expressed to it his doubts about its fellow mind flayer [[Ouwoonivisc]], who somehow acted in dissonance with the hive mind. Working together, Pescatawav and Kimmuriel discovered that Ouwoonivisc had been infected by [[Lolth]] and was unwillingly disturbing the hive mind. Kimmuriel, with the support of Pescatawav, destroyed Ouwoonivisc."
