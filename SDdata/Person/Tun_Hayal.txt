'''Tun Hayal''' was the owner of the [[Merchant's Home]] in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Though he owned the most splendid [[carvanserai]] in all of the City of Delights, Tun was rarely found within his establishment. He preferred to leave the operation of his business into the hands of trusted servants.
