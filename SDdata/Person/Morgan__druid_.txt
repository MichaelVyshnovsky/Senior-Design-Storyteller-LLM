'''Morgan''' was a [[druid]] active in the [[High Moor]] sometime prior to the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the namesake of the [[Morgan's redwing]] species of [[butterfly]].

==History==
During his time, a tribe of [[goblin]]s discovered that the redwing butterflies native to the High Moor could be boiled to produce a desirable crimson [[dye]]. They soon taught this to the other goblins of the High Moor, and in turn, the butterflies quickly became endangered. At this point, Morgan moved to save the insects from extinction. Capitalizing on a wasting [[disease]] that had befallen some of the goblins, he spread rumors that it was caused by the redwing dye, thus sparking concerns that the dye was [[poison]]ous. The lie compelled the goblins to leave the butterflies alone, thus allowing their numbers to recover. As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the species was known as "Morgan's redwings" in the druid's honor.
