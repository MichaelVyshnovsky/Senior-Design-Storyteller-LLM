'''Haeromos Dothwintyl''' was the ruler of [[Port Llast]].

==Description==
A retired stonemason, Haeromos carried himself in a proud manner and wore the finest clothing, armor, and weaponry money could buy. The source of this wealth came from the taxes of the people of Port Llast.

==Possessions==
The First Captain wielded a ''[[longsword|longsword +3]]'' enspelled so it could send a message to the [[wizard]], [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] when Haeromos was in danger or the village was attacked.
