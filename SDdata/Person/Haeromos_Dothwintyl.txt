Haeromos Dothwintyl was the ruler of Port Llast.
A retired stonemason, Haeromos carried himself in a proud manner and wore the finest clothing, armor, and weaponry money could buy. The source of this wealth came from the taxes of the people of Port Llast.
The First Captain wielded a longsword +3 enspelled so it could send a message to the wizard, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun when Haeromos was in danger or the village was attacked.
