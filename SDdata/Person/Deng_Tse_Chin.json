As well as both a thoroughbred and draft horse, for whom he owned barding and a variety of equipment for taking care of.\nGrowing up as an abandoned child in the Sheng-Ti monastery, known as \"The Sanctuary\", in the city of Hsi-Feng, Deng learned all about the Path of Enlightenment and the Immortal Fa Kuan, patron of the monastery. He trained in kung fu of the Horizon style.\nAt Dengs coming of age, the abbot explained to him that a fortune in silver and gems had been wrapped in his robes when he was found, suggesting he was of noble birth.\nDeng started travelling to teach the Paths doctrines and maybe uncover the secret of his birth. After two years, in 1358 DR, Deng decided to attend the Komite."
