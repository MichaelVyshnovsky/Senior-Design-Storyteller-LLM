        "mainbody": "Bryn Goldtooth was a halfling shopkeeper of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the mid–14 century DR.\nBryn ran a business buying, selling, and trading all kinds of goods. He didnt get his stock wholesale from merchants, but instead from other customers, so he had a highly eclectic range, from vegetables to stuffed leucrotta heads, old journals to linen tablecloths, gold candlesticks to a variety of cranial drills (used). These were mixed together in the narrow aisles of his dim and labyrinthine store. It was said one would find exactly what they were looking for, or nothing at all. Nevertheless, there were limits Elizabeth Clawthorn once offered a dead cat for the tablecloths, but Bryn declined.\nHe gave good deals to fellow hin, even one-quarter halflings like Jasper, and usually with a wink and a \"We halflings have to stick together, eh?\" Meanwhile, it just made his day to get the best of a human in a trade. He wasnt a member of Cormyrs Merchants Guild, as first he didnt do business with merchants and felt no kinship with them and second he wouldve hated to give human merchants money for nothing more than a worthless membership.\nOn Eleasias 28 in the , Bryn was riding his pony Bupkin after leaving the Swamp Rat tavern when he sighted the ghost of the bandit chieftain Fastred and raced back to town in fear.\nA few weeks later, on Eleint 18, Jasper went to Bryns store to ask him about the ghost sighting, after it was discovered to be Dovo in disguise. Bryn didnt have more to add, but did try to sell him 0.5 bushels (18 liters) of turnips hed gotten in a trade that day Jasper settled for a cheap old journal with a Camber Fosrick installment in it."
