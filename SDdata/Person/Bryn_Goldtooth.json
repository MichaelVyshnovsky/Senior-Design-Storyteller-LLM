        "Activities": "Bryn ran a business buying, selling, and trading all kinds of goods. He didn't get his stock wholesale from merchants, but instead from other customers, so he had a highly eclectic range, from vegetables to stuffed [[leucrotta]] heads, old journals to [[linen]] tablecloths, [[gold]] candlesticks to a variety of [[cranial drill]]s (used). These were mixed together in the narrow aisles of his dim and labyrinthine store. It was said one would find exactly what they were looking for, or nothing at all. Nevertheless, there were limits; [[Elizabeth Clawthorn]] once offered a dead [[cat]] for the tablecloths, but Bryn declined.\n\nHe gave good deals to fellow [[hin]], even one-quarter halflings like [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]], and usually with a wink and a \"We halflings have to stick together, eh?\" Meanwhile, it just made his day to get the best of a [[human]] in a trade. He wasn't a member of Cormyr's [[Merchants' Guild]], as first he didn't do business with merchants and felt no kinship with them and second he would've hated to give human merchants money for nothing more than a worthless membership.",
