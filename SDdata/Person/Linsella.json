        "mainbody": "insella was a hin True Soul of the Absolute in the Moonrise Towerss kitchens during the late 15 century DR.\nLinsella was a halfling woman with dark skin and huge brown eyes. Her black hair was in locks, and her face was decorated with a simple chin tattoo. Linsella proudly wore an amulet of the Absolute atop her simple dark blue leathers.\nShortly before the , Linsella rose in the ranks of the Absolutists and stood before her \"goddess\", receiving her blessing. In reality, Linsella was a zealot and became infected by the Absolute with an illithid tadpole. This gave Linsella psionic abilities that allowed her to \"rewrite the lives of her faithful\" â€“ psychic control. Using these mental tethers, True Soul Linsella dominated three gnolls. She renamed her new slaves to Tomelia, Barnabus, and Timothy. Linsella claimed that shed quelled the gnolls savage nature and showed them a \"gentler way.\" The halfling cultist truly believed in the goodliness of her actions and believed in \"Her Design.\" The monstrous humanoids were instructed to work in the kitchen, and Barnabus was put in charge of soups. Yet bloodthirstiness and rage still seethed underneath the painful mental domination.\nWhen the gnolls and their mistress encountered a group of the True Soul heroes of Baldurs Gate, they may had been helped by severing Linsellas mental leash, leading to the hins swift death. Some said that the heroes couldve dominated the gnolls themselves, while by other accounts, the three gnolls couldve remained under the cults control and perished with Linsella in an assault by Harpers and the True Soul heroes on the Moonrise Towers."
