        "mainbody": "'''Rechel''' was a [[tiefling]] of [[Elturel]] who was among those kicked out of the city in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Those druids are going to get us killed â€• nothing sacreda bout this lot!|Rechel, about the [[druid]]s of the [[Emerald Grove]].}}",
        "Description": "Rechel had dark-red skin, black hair, and two large horns that curved backwards like those of a [[ram]]. She dressed in simple clothes, a tunic and trousers.",
        "History": "Like other Elturian tieflings, Rechel was outcast from the city following [[the Descent]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. When the people of Elturel witnessed the horrors of the [[Nine Hells]] firshard, it was decided that any \"devilkin\" would be forced out of the holy capital. Many of the tieflings fell under the leadership of [[Zevlor]], who led them west along the [[Risen Road]] towards [[Baldur's Gate]]. Unfortunately, [[goblin]] raids forced the refugees to seek shelter at the [[Emerald Grove]], inadvertently endangering the druid's within their own home.\n\nAs tension grew between the druids and their tiefling guests, Rechel become more and more frustrated. She was among those that felt the selfishness and callousness of head druid [[Kagha]] would be the death of her kind."
