Unfortunately, goblin raids forced the refugees to seek shelter at the Emerald Grove, inadvertently endangering the druids within their own home.\nAs tension grew between the druids and their tiefling guests, Rechel become more and more frustrated. She was among those that felt the selfishness and callousness of head druid Kagha would be the death of her kind."
