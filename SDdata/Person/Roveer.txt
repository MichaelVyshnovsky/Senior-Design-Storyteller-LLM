'''Roveer''' was a cook from [[Baldur's Gate]]'s [[Elfsong Tavern]], who, apparently, cooked [[duck]]s daily, in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''To the Recipes Editor,''<br/><br/>''I am a professional chef, so I am writing to tell you I am in big outrage about your article about how to cook the ducks. It was wrong, bad, dumb, stupid, incorrect, wrong, wrong, WRONG.''<br/><br/>''You want to know how to cook the ducks you should ask Roveer how to cook the ducks, he is cooking the ducks every night at the Elfsong for more years than the number of times your article was wrong. You tell me when, I will come over and show you how to cook the ducks. 'Recipes Editor', HA.''''|A letter to ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gzette'', presumably, from Roveer}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Roveer sought exterminators to kill [[rat]] vermin in the cellars of the Elfsong Tavern. Despite him carrying a massive [[axe]], and owning two [[cat]]s, [[Tambourine (cat)|Tambourine]] and [[Zambomba]], the inhabitants and [[Alan Alyth]]'s employees could not or were unwilling to resolve the egregious food safety issue.
