'''Fezzerk''' was the leader of a [[goblin]] war band associated with the [[cult of the Absolute]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|...well I'll be - me ol' friend, captain failure|Fezzerk, speaking to the adventurer [[Wyll]].}}

==Personality==
The goblin boss was all bluster and bravado until he was knocked down a peg or two. He became something of a coward whenever confronted with violence.

==History==
At some point during or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Fezzerk and the professional torturer [[Spike (goblin)|Spike]] encountered the adventurer [[Wyll]], apparently when he was still a captain in the [[Flaming Fist]]. During the encounter, Spike ended up plucking out Wyll's right eye, keeping it as a trophy for some time.

Some time later, Fezzerk and his band ventured over to [[Moonhaven]]. There they tortured the Baldurian [[deep gnome]] [[Barcus Wroot]], by tying him to the arm of the village's windmill and laughed as they watched him spin around again and again.
