Fezzerk was the leader of a goblin war band associated with the cult of the Absolute during the late 15 century DR.
The goblin boss was all bluster and bravado until he was knocked down a peg or two. He became something of a coward whenever confronted with violence.
At some point during or before the , Fezzerk and the professional torturer Spike encountered the adventurer Wyll, apparently when he was still a captain in the Flaming Fist. During the encounter, Spike ended up plucking out Wylls right eye, keeping it as a trophy for some time.
Some time later, Fezzerk and his band ventured over to Moonhaven. There they tortured the Baldurian deep gnome Barcus Wroot, by tying him to the arm of the villages windmill and laughed as they watched him spin around again and again.
