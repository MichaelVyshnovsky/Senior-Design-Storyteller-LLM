'''Roah Moonglow''' was a [[halfling]] agent of the [[Zhentarim]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|If there was money in being good, the Zhentarim would be pure as [[paladin]]s.|Roah Moonglow}}

==Description==
Roah dressed in a simple leather-and-cloth tunic and trousers, affixed with a decorative metal belt. She wore a Zhentarim pin attached to her top. 

==Personality==
The halfling highly valued making profit on her wares. Unlike most surface dwellers, she didn't entirely disapprove of exploring the [[Underdark]], as she appreciated the fact the Zhentarim could openly trade there.

==Possessions==
Roah armed herself with a [[spear]] and studded [[shield]]. Her mechant wares included a selection of [[Item enchantment|enchanted weapons]], including magic ammunition, fortified armor, magical [[scroll]]s, [[potion]]s, and a variety of foodstuffs.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Roah was regularly buying slaves from the [[goblinoid]] members of the [[cult of the Absolute]]. She maintained a presence within the ruined [[Shattered Sanctum|temple of Sel√ªne]] the cultists had taken over. In return for the captive, Roah offered the cult copious amounts of [[smokepowder]], which they used for their own research.
