        "History": "In [[1370 DR]], The Shadow Thieves established an enclave in one of the top levels of the mega-dungeon underneath [[Waterdeep]]. Mishad Patchwerk and his brother were members of that guild branch led by the Guild Master [[Georges]] and his right hand, [[Braakus Sinjen]]. The word of the guild's return reached the [[Lords of Waterdeep]], and they sent a brave adventurer to discover the guild's hidden stronghold. Mishad was one of the first thieves to fall by the hero's weapons."
