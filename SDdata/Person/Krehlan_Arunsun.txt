Krehlan Arunsun was the son of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun and Laeral Silverhand and the fourth Blackstaff.
Krehlan was silver-haired from birth.
Laeral noted in Lifelong with Regrets (published 1391 DR) that Krehlan had his fathers temper.
Laeral was pregnant with Krehlan by the end of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR.This suggests Krehlan was probably born in 1375 DR.
Unlike his parents, Krehlan was not a Chosen of Mystra, but was still a highly skilled spellcaster, sufficient to become a Blackstaff. Krehlan became Blackstaff in the Year of Lost Ships, 1400 DR.
In the 1415 DR, Krehlan and the Grand Mages of Rhymanthiin dissipated the kiira NVaelhar, which held the spirit-templates and combined knowledge of Khelben Arunsun, Tsarra Chaadren, and Kyriani Agrivar, and bound its magic to Blackstaff Tower and its twin in Rhymanthiin, NVaerymanth.
Around 1424 DR, Krehlan was killed by Chartham Dellenvol. His successor was Ashemmon of Rhymanthiin. Krehlans spirit-template went on to reside within Blackstaff Tower, along with the spirit-templates of the other former Blackstaffs.
