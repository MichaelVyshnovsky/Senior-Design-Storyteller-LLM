        "Description": "Wyn was graceful, with golden skin, short curly black hair, and green eyes. He had a serious mien and was about five and a half feet tall.",
        "History": "Wyn had been apprenticed to [[Kerigan|Kerigan the Bold]], a skald from the [[Moonshaes]].\n\nIn [[1364 DR]] at the Spring Faire in [[Silverymoon]], Wyn noticed that old songs passed on through the ages had inexplicably changed, yet not even the singers seemed to notice. He reported his findings to [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] in [[Waterdeep]], who sent him to travel with [[Danilo Thann]] and the dwarf [[Morgalla]] to determine the cause. They determined that [[Iriador Wintermist]] was using the [[Morninglark]] harp to place a curse upon the [[Harpers]] and the people of Waterdeep. Wyn traveled with the group to the [[High Forest]] and back and aided in the retrieval of the Morninglark.\n\nWyn was last seen traveling with Morgalla to her people in the [[Earthfast Mountains]].",
        "Possessions": "Wyn carried a deep green crystal flute and a silver ''[[lyre of changing]]'', which upon command could change into any instrument of its size of smaller."
