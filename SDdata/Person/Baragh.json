        "mainbody": "'''Baragh''' was a battle-hardened drow patron of the [[Ust Natha tavern]] who shared tales with his patrons, around [[1369 DR]]",
        "Description": "Baragh would often be found telling tales of his feats and the city's history in the tavern of Ust Natha. He took part in a glorious [[Running]] in about 1269 DR, when a cavern leading to the surface was found. He hunted and raided the surface communities (particularly humans and halflings) with his fellows. He kept the \"tiny skulls\" of the halflings, but the humans rallied a defence and collapsed the tunnel. Baragh wished revenge on the humans and would put his life on the line to take part in an upcoming Running."
