'''Homen Odesseiron''' was a [[warmage]] and [[tharchion]] of [[Surthay]] in [[Thay]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. His standard displayed an axe-and-boar.

==Description==
Homen wore wizard's robes. He usually had a perpetually dour expression on his face.

==Possessions==
His favorite weapons were his sword and lance.

==Personality==
Homen was a very proud man and took responsibility for his actions as tharchion of Surthay.

==History==
Once Homen was a [[Red Wizard]] but he stepped down in order to become tharchion.

After a failed attempt at conquering a [[Rashemen|Rashemi]] town, Homen's army was rescued by [[Szass Tam]] and Homen thus sided with the [[lich]] lord's cause of conquering [[Faer√ªn]].
