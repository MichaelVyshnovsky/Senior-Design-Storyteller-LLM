        "mainbody": "Pristoleph was a fire genasi sorcerer who was active in Innarlith in the Lake of Steam region in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He came from an impoverished background, but eventually rose to become the Ransar, the leader of the city-state of Innarlith.\nHe didnt tell people that he was a fire genasi and the people of Innarlith seemed to just accept that he had strange hair. He wore makeup on his face to lighten his complexion and told people that he was Chondathan.\nAs a fire genasi, he had better vision in the dark than humans and had some ability to control flames.\nHe was extremely wealthy and had much property. Pristal Towers was a palace that belonged to him in the fourth quarter of Innarlith. Determined was his personal ship on the Lake of Steam. He was the castellan of Firesteap Citadel as well, although officially it was property of the city-state. He also purchased the inn that his mother had worked in as a prostitute.\nMarek Rymüt, a Red Wizard, gave him a gift of magical pince-nez with opaque magenta lenses that he could use to see through the eyes of Phyrea, daughter of Senator Inthelph, without her awareness of it.\nPristoleph was raised by his human mother, whom he left at a young age to live on the streets of Innarlith. His mother had been wealthy at one point, but had lost her wealth and resorted to working as a prostitute. He never met his fire elemental father. He was disgusted by his mother and didnt maintain contact with her after he left home.\nIn the 1360s DR, he became an ally of the Red Wizard Marek Rymüt, who was stirring up trouble among the poor and working classes. only to turn on him later when Pristoleph went against his plans regarding the canal project.\nWenefir was Pristolephs friend since childhood. The former eventually became a cleric of Cyric. Wenefir offered the help of the Church of Cyric for Pristoleph to become Ransar, but Pristoleph distrusted using them to take power. Wenefir counseled Pristoleph not to trust Marek Rymüt.\nPhyrea was the daughter of Senator Inthelph and she became Pristolephs wife after she divorced from Senator Willem Korvan.\nOlin was a black firedrake who served as Pristolephs bodyguard and saved his life from an attack by a maurezhi.\nPristoleph was born in Innarlith in the early 14 century DR. His mother was a human woman who worked as a prostitute. She was raped by a fire elemental who was disguised as a human client soliciting for her services.\nHe left home at a young age to live on the streets of Innarlith in the fourth quarter of the city. He got into trouble with a gang of child-aged burglars who were led by a boy named Mandalax. Mandalax wanted Pristoleph to join his gang, but Pristoleph refused. Mandalax then went after him because of his refusal. After a violent confrontation between Pristoleph and Mandalaxs gang on Eleint 7 in the , Pristoleph succeeded in winning over the gang and became their leader, aged only 12.\nEventually, he came to work for the city guard of Innarlith under Lieutenant Ptolnec. He organized a brothel during his time in the city guard with the prostitute Nyla. He left the city for a period and returned later.\nLater, Pristoleph succeeded in becoming a member of the Senate of Innarlith. He was present in the city as a senator in the , when strikes and social action were being taken by the working class and poor of Innarlith. He allied himself with Marek Rymüt, who was regularly appearing at demonstrations and giving speeches in favor of the workers. Pristoleph advised Rymüt on how to gain control of the various work gangs in the city in order to set up a collective organization of workers to engage in collective action.\nDuring this turmoil, Pristoleph presented a public image of himself as a man of the common people who had come up from poverty in the fourth quarter of Innarlith, even though he had since acquired immense wealth to make him an aristocrat. \nHe developed an attraction to Phyrea, the wife of Senator Willem Korvan, and decided he would take her as his own wife. Phyrea, who detested Willem, decided to divorce Willem and marry Pristoleph.\nHe long had ambitions of becoming the Ransar of Innarlith. He made plans and assembled an army at Firesteap Citadel with which he planned to invade Innnarlith. Ransar Salatis became aware of Pristolephs ambitions and he sent Tjuyu, a spirit naga assassin, to kill him and Phyrea, but the attack was foiled by Pristoleph, who used his control over flames to burn the naga and cause it to flee.\nHe took his army to invade Innarlith and besieged the city for a year. In the , as his soldiers had captured much of the city and came near the Palace of Many Spires, Salatiss bodyguards betrayed and murdered him. They handed the Ransars corpse over to Pristoleph, who then was appointed as the new Ransar of Innarlith.\nTjuyu then went to the canal site to murder the chief builder of the canal that was intended to connect the Lake of Steam to the Nagaflow. Pristoleph investigated and he found that Ivar Devorast, who had earlier been the chief builder of the canal, was still at the site and secretly directing the workmen on how to build while he posed as a common laborer. Pristoleph had him arrested and locked in his dungeon for a year. But over time Pristoleph became convinced that Devorast was not guilty of the assassination and had him released. He asked Devorast to take over construction of the canal, and Devorast agreed to do so.\nMarek Rymüt, who had profited from the sale of magical items and services for the canal project, was very upset by this turn of events and was strongly against it, but Pristoleph refused to change his mind. Pristoleph and Devorast later traveled together to Shou Lung for half a year and when they returned, they found that a magical portal had been created for moving ships instead of the canal without Pristolephs consent. Pristoleph was annoyed by this and found that some of Mareks henchmen were behind it.\nMarek sent a maurezhi disguised as Svayyah to assassinate Pristoleph. Svayyah was a water naga that had earlier made an agreement with Devorast concerning the canal, but whom Marek was trying to incriminate and get Innarlith to distrust. Pristolephs bodyguards fought off the assassin and Pristoleph immediately went to the canal site to question Devorast about what happened. Svayyah then appeared and showed that she was not the assassin that Pristoleph had encountered, since she was not wounded and Pristolephs bodyguards had cut off the maurezhis ear during the fight. The severed ear itself later transformed back into its original form after it had been cut off and Pristoleph could tell that someone had been trying to trick him.\nPristoleph came to suspect that Marek Rymüt was attempting to kill him and tried to find a way to get Marek arrested, but this wasnt possible since Marek refused to leave the Thayan enclave in Innarlith, which put him legally on foreign soil and not under Innarliths jurisdiction.\nIn the , Devorast detonated large quantities of smokepowder that destroyed the canal. Pristoleph immediately had him arrested but kept him imprisoned rather than executing him. A faction of senators that were being secretly manipulated by Marek then began a civil uprising against Pristoleph, with the intent on ending his term as Ransar. Wenefir betrayed Pristoleph and assisted the rebellious senators in the struggle. \nAfter much destruction in the city, Pristoleph announced that he would agree to step down as Ransar on condition that Phyrea and Ivar Devorast were both permitted to leave the city unharmed. The other side agreed, and after Pristoleph had both of them moved out, on Kythorn 10, 1374 DR, he went to the Chamber of Law and Civility to give his formal resignation to the senate, as well as to Senator Meykhati, who was the nominal leader of the faction and set to take over the post of Ransar. Pristoleph diverted from the statement that both sides had agreed upon to openly accuse the senators of being puppets of a foreign power seeking to control Innarlith. Pristoleph then used his control over flames to cause the chandeliers and candles in the chamber to burn the people in attendance, who immediately began scrambling out of the room. Pristoleph then fought his way out of the chamber into the city, where he had arranged for wemic mercenaries to surround the building and secure his escape.\nPristoleph gathered together his allies in the city, while Marek and his allies took formal control of the Senate. Pristolephs forces succeeded in capturing Marek and the lead senators in the conspiracy, whom he had bound and brought to the Palace of Many Spires, where Pristoleph resumed his lordship over the city as Ransar. Pristoleph had the conspirators judged. He handed Marek and his fellow wizards over to Thayan representatives who took them and agreed to punish them. Several others were exiled or executed. \nHe then met with Ivar Devorast again and Devorast agreed to continue his work on the canal with funds from the Ransar. He gave Phyrea to Devorast, as they had long had feelings for each other, under the premise that she had never really belonged to him.\nOn Nightal 24, 1361 DR, there was a general strike that occurred in the third quarter of Innarlith that was rumored to have been instigated by Pristoleph while he was serving as a senator.\nHe was rumored to be the richest man in Innarlith."
