        "mainbody": "'''Sharlarra Vendreth''' (also spelled '''Vindrith''' She was formerly an apprentice of [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] at [[Blackstaff Tower]] in [[Waterdeep]], but left her position for more excitement.",
        "Description": "Sharlarra had red-gold hair and golden-colored skin",
        "Personality": "She had a fun-loving nature. She often enjoyed the company of men that caught her eye.",
        "History": "[[Laeral Silverhand]] found Sharlarra as a thief on the streets of [[Skullport]]. Laeral believed the young elf was promising and brought her to her husband, Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun, at Blackstaff Tower.\n\nSharlarra sought out Liriel by locating gems that Liriel had once borne. In the process, she was captured by two men named [[Chadrik]] and [[Dienter]], who locked her in a coffin and were subsequently killed by [[Gorlist]]'s drow band. She was rescued by Khelben and accepted his offer to come back to Blackstaff Tower, but once there she quickly recanted and continued after Liriel. She was aided in her travels by a ghostly ''teu-kelytha'' (a legendary [[moon horse]] of [[Evermeet]]) that she christened [[Moonstone (horse)|Moonstone]]. In [[Shadowdale]], the ghost of [[Sylune]], the Witch of Shadowdale, appeared to them, foreshadowing her future involvement in Liriel's quest.\n\nSharlarra subsequently traveled with Liriel and the [[lythari]] Thorn for at least ten years, developing a strong friendship with them. ''Circa'' {{YearlinkName|1371}}, she was with them in [[Hlammach]], [[Impiltur]], serving as a hired blade for the Impiltur military."
