In the process, she was captured by two men named Chadrik and Dienter, who locked her in a coffin and were subsequently killed by Gorlists drow band. She was rescued by Khelben and accepted his offer to come back to Blackstaff Tower, but once there she quickly recanted and continued after Liriel. She was aided in her travels by a ghostly teu-kelytha (a legendary moon horse of Evermeet) that she christened Moonstone. In Shadowdale, the ghost of Sylune, the Witch of Shadowdale, appeared to them, foreshadowing her future involvement in Liriels quest.\nSharlarra subsequently traveled with Liriel and the lythari Thorn for at least ten years, developing a strong friendship with them.
