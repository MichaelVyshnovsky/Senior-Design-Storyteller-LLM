Baerduin Thask was a human magic-user and a member of the adventuring company known as The Four. 
His fellow members Telorn, Fiirfar Nulomn, and Diloule "Lanternhand" were all hanged as assassins in Tethyr on the day before Higharvestide in 1369 DR following the siege of Myratma. Baerduin would have faced a similar end but he escaped justice by leaping off the seaside cliffs overlooking the ruins of Ithalyr, laughing as he did so. Not even the sea elves ever found his body and his fate remains unknown.
Among his other crimes, Baerduin Thask was responsible for transforming prisoners into Broken Ones,
