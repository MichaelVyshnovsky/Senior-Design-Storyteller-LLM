'''Newt Longscar''' was a [[bloodforge]] mage operating out of the [[Serpent Valley]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

Newt Longscar mustered and trained a bloodforge army in the Serpent Valley to fight against the advancing leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]], who aimed to unify the Utter East through conquest. The leader tried to strike first before Newt was fully prepared and established.
