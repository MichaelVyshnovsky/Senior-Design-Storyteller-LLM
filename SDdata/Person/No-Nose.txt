'''No-Nose''' was a [[goblin]] leader of history in the [[Orsraun Mountains]].

==History==
Around [[1258 DR]], No-Nose led the [[Bloodier Teeth]] goblin band. Joined by all goblin, [[orc]], [[troll]], and [[kobold]] tribes in the area, he attacked the village of [[Urml (Turmish)|Urml]]. However, the villagers won the battle thanks to a mysterious stranger in white armor, later identified as the god [[Torm]], who'd been sent by the god [[Tyr]] to protect his followers in the village.
