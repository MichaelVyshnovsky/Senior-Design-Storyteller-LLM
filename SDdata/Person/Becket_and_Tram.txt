Becket and Tram were a pair of twin fighters who adventured with the Stag Runners company circa 1369 DR.
Becket and Tram were simple, uninspired brutes. They cared for little beyond the shortest path to earning money, usually by performing acts of violence.
The twins wore chain mail and carried longswords.
In 1369 DR, the twins followed the Stag Runners to a party at Thistleflame Keep, only to be outraged by Mendryll Belarods degrading and debauched song of Sembite impropriety. They joined their allies in ambushing him later, hoping to extract satisfaction, only to be beaten in turn by Mendryll and another party.
