'''Becket''' and '''Tram''' were a pair of twin [[fighter]]s who [[adventurer|adventured]] with the [[Stag Runners]] company ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Personality==
Becket and Tram were simple, uninspired brutes. They cared for little beyond the shortest path to earning money, usually by performing acts of violence.

==Possessions==
The twins wore [[chain mail]] and carried [[longsword]]s.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], the twins followed the Stag Runners to a party at [[Thistleflame Keep]], only to be outraged by [[Mendryll Belarod]]'s degrading and debauched song of Sembite impropriety. They joined their allies in ambushing him later, hoping to extract satisfaction, only to be beaten in turn by Mendryll and another party.
