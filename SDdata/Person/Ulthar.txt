Ulthar was the most patient of the librarians living in Gravenhollow in the late 15 century DR.
Ulthar was always busy sorting and filing ancient texts, maintaining the immeasurably vast catalog that organized them. When he was not cross-referencing the expanding collection, Ulthar composed epic poetry and restored and curated the wall carvings of the library.
Ulthar had infinite patience and was the most disposed to interacting with guests, speaking to them about ancient history.
