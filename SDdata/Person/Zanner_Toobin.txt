'''Zanner Toobin''' was a [[rock gnome]] foundry worker who lived in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a member of the [[Church of Gond]].

==Description==
Both of his eyes had been cut out by [[Banite]]s while working at the [[Steel Watch Foundry]], leaving him blind. An arcane collar was placed around his neck to ensure obedience while he worked at the foundry. He wore a green blindfold.

==Abilities==
Zanner possessed the ability to cast the [[cantrip]] ''[[shocking grasp]]'' as well as the [[spell]]s ''[[aid]]'', ''[[blur]]'', and ''[[misty step]]''. He could also cast ''[[enlarge]]'' on himself only.

==Possessions==
Zanner wore the ''[[winkling gloves]]'', a pair of magical gloves that improved the wearer's attack accuracy and manual dexterity.

==History==
{{Quote|Gondians! Rip the Motivator from this bastard's hands. FOR GOND!|Zanner inspiring his fellow Gondians to revolt}}

Sometime in or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Zanner was the head of the [[Hall of Wonders]]'s "Auto-Guard" project that eventually became the [[steel watcher]]s under the control of Director [[Enver Gortash]]. The entire design was detailed in Zanner's report on automaton conversion with the "infernal power supply" provided by Lord [[Gortash]]. After the project commenced, Zanner, along with his fellow Gondians, worked at the Steel Watch Foundry in Baldur's Gate against their will. Using [[magic item]]s called ''motivators'' and with the threat of Gondian hostages being kept in the [[Iron Throne headquarters]], the guards of the foundry were able to maintain control over the workers.

If Zanner found out that the hostages had been freed, he was ready to lead an uprising against the foundry's guards.
