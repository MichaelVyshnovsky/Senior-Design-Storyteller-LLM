Zanner Toobin was a rock gnome foundry worker who lived in the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR. He was a member of the Church of Gond.
Both of his eyes had been cut out by Banites while working at the Steel Watch Foundry, leaving him blind. An arcane collar was placed around his neck to ensure obedience while he worked at the foundry. He wore a green blindfold.
Zanner possessed the ability to cast the cantrip shocking grasp as well as the spells aid, blur, and misty step. He could also cast enlarge on himself only.
Zanner wore the winkling gloves, a pair of magical gloves that improved the wearers attack accuracy and manual dexterity.
Sometime in or before the , Zanner was the head of the Hall of Wonderss "Auto-Guard" project that eventually became the steel watchers under the control of Director Enver Gortash. The entire design was detailed in Zanners report on automaton conversion with the "infernal power supply" provided by Lord Gortash. After the project commenced, Zanner, along with his fellow Gondians, worked at the Steel Watch Foundry in Baldurs Gate against their will. Using magic items called motivators and with the threat of Gondian hostages being kept in the Iron Throne headquarters, the guards of the foundry were able to maintain control over the workers.
If Zanner found out that the hostages had been freed, he was ready to lead an uprising against the foundrys guards.
