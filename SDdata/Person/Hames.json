        "mainbody": "'''Hames''' was an [[undead]] pirate in service to [[Garrundar]] in the [[Pirate Skyhold]] north of [[Neverwinter]].",
        "History": "Hames was a commander of the very powerful band of sky pirates led by [[Bartholomew Blackdagger]]. At one time, the sky pirates tried to capture Garrundar but they failed spectacularly and the [[black dragon]] pursued them back to their hideout. Garrundar took control of the [[lizardfolk]] that lived there and he weaved a powerful spell that cursed the pirates into undeath and bound them to him.\n\nIn [[1484 DR]], [[Company Yargo]], needing a base and more sky ships, sent an adventurer to clear the area. The adventurer fought and killed Hames before they arrived at the dragon.<ref>"
