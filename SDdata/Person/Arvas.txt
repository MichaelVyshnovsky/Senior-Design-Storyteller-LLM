'''Arvas''' or '''Avras''' was a warrior in the [[Frostfire Banner]] adventuring party during the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|"Paeregur," Arvas said in weary tones, "have you looked up and down this road recently? Do you see anyone...anyone...but us? Block the road from what, may I ask? Since the deaths began, travel seems to have just about stopped along here. Possibly about the same time you got this funny idea into your head that you're somehow entitled to give the rest of us orders! Was it that new armor, the heavy helm pressing hard on your brains?

==Personality==
He had a bit of a reputation for drink. He laughed with his comrades when they brought that up, but sarcastically so.

==Description==
His voice wasn't as deep as [[Paeregur]]'s.

==Possessions==
He carried a sword and wore a cowl.

==History==
Arvas was a member of the Frostfire Banner when they took on High Duke [[Horostos]]'s assignment to search for the reason why all animals larger than one's hand, as well as most people, were vanishing on the road between [[Starmantle]] and [[Ripplestones]].

They were ambushed on their first night out of Starmantle by a chiming mist, [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]]. Avras took first watch; when his comrade [[Paeregur]] checked up on him, hearing the tinkling bell-like sound, he found Avras had been reduced to a skull and a husk that collapsed into ash at the slightest touch.
