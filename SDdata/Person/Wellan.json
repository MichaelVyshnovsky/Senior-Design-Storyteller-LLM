        "mainbody": "'''Brother Wellan''' was a novice [[monk]] from the [[Rosymorn Monastery]] in the [[Western Heartlands]], who died in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] during the monastery's fall to the [[githyanki]] invaders.\n\n{{quote|''Lathander will preserve us in our time of need.''|Excerpt from the journal of Brother Wellan.}}",
        "History": "Brother Wellan's place in history was solidified thanks to his journal that detailed the githyanki attack on Rosymorn Monastery in or shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. According to Wellan's writings, the goth attacked at dawn. Several survivors of the attack, including the novice, managed to barricade themselves within a monastery room protected by a summoned ''[[guardian of faith]]''. The invaders failed to break through the barricaded door and, with time, went quiet. The survivors were not sure if the attack was over and the githyanki were gone. Soon, that hope for salvation was crushed with a goth warrior jumping into the room through a window, only to be cut down by the ''guardian of faith''. Brother Wellan started hatching an escape plan through the now-broken window, but it was not to be. Shortly after, they were incinerated by a githyanki's [[dragon]], leaving behind only skeletons. Brother Wellan's book was charred and remained in the room with the ''guardian of faith'' in the ruined Rosymorn Monastery as of 1492 DR."
