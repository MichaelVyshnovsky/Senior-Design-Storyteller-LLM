        "mainbody": "High Prince Telamont Tanthul was a powerful Netherese shade archmage and arcanist of the Shadow Weave and the ruler of Thultanthar, also known as Shade Enclave. \nTall and hardy, Telamont had diminished little in stature over his millennia-long existence. \nTelamont had a great love of Netherese culture and sought to preserve it even when his subjects and he were forced onto the Plane of Shadow. His unwavering determination to rule the city meant that he considered himself to be the true embodiment of the citys culture, laws, and beliefs. Telamonts composure was such that it was near-impossible to get a bead on what he was truly thinking or feeling and he had an unwavering eye for easily seeing through the facades of others.\nBorn in , As he grew in ability, he was credited with creating numerous spells based around shadow magic. During his time at the academy, Telamont published a work that postulated the existence of demiplanes. Unfortunately, his ideas were considered to be completely at odds with the existing models of the planes and he was soon exiled.\nLuckily, the ruler of Eileanar, Karsus, decided to grant Shadow sanctuary and bequeathed him the Shadow Consortium to continue his research. Well-warded by Karsus magic, Shadow gathered other \"fringe\" researchers to help him and after eleven years he was ready. With Karsuss blessing, Shadow published his work on the Demiplane of Shadow called Shadows The Palpable Cohesion of Formless Corporeality. This new work proved the existence of demiplanes and quasielemental planes without undermining the existing planar mechanics. It was such a success that all restrictions on demiplane research were lifted and Shadow was released from all charges. In addition, attendance to the Academy of Mentalist Study rose by 30% for the next five years when it was revealed that Shadow had studied there.\nthumb|250px|Shadow and Alashar escaping.\nHowever, in , Shadow found himself romantically entangled with a bard from Xinlenal called Alashar Crywinds. Despite all charges for his work being lifted many years earlier, Alashar had been secretly assigned by the archwizard Grenway to kill Shadow. When this was revealed to Shadow, both he and Alashar found they were unable to kill each other and instead managed to stage their deaths with the use of a simulacrum. Successful in their ruse, the two married and traveled together to the Demiplane of Shadow.\nTelamont Tanthul (under his guise as Lord Shadow) became Thultanthars archwizard and was experimenting with the Plane of Shadow for some time before Karsuss Folly. He successfully shifted the entire city into the Plane of Shadow in the , mere days before Karsus cast Karsuss avatar and temporarily destroyed the Weave. For some reason though, Tanthul could not immediately move the city back to the Prime Material Plane. It took weeks, but eventually they managed to return to Netheril, or at least what was left of it. Searching for survivors for days, the city floated over the ruins of the Netherese empire. Finding none, Tanthul assumed it was the work of the phaerimm and began planning his revenge. He stopped though, when he realized that one city was not a match for them and that his subjects were likely the last of the empires people. He abandoned those plans and retreated back into the Plane of Shadow, vowing that one day, they would return and reestablish the empire. The citys clerics of Shar cast divinations and saw what had really happened, but only informed the noble families, presumably at the whim of Shar herself for some reason. The excursion into the Plane of Shadow, due to unforeseen circumstances, lasted much longer than Tanthul anticipated. For over 1,700 years, the inhabitants battled the malaugrym and the other shadowy horrors of the realm, while each generation became gradually more attuned to the plane itself, becoming what were later known as Shadovar. \nAt last, in the , High Prince Telamont Tanthul returned Thultanthar to Faerûn as the City of Shade. When he considered the time to be right, Telamont planned to reveal to the Shadovar that he was the Lord Shadow of legend to inspire them to victory.\nIn the , Telamont tried to gain the power of Myth Drannors mythal so that Shar could become the new deity of magic. He and his fellow Shadovar were stopped by Larloch, who wanted to absorb the mythal himself, and Telamont was killed by Elminster. Thultanthar fell upon Myth Drannor and both cities were destroyed.\nWell over two millennia old, Telamont preserved his life by means of powerful magic, such as wish spells. This process was made easier by virtue of the fact that he was no longer human, but rather an outsider and the natural life span of a shade was many times longer that that of an ordinary human. However, Telamont acknowledged reluctantly that as his outsider body began to fail, stronger measures were required to keep him alive. He had not yet decided on the best means of continuing his existence, but the Shadovars return to Faerûn offered a wealth of possibilities, including transformation into an undead creature. By 1372 DR, Tanthuls body was composed of pure shadow magic.\nTanthul had thirteen sons, the Princes of Shade, all potent warriors and spellcasters. His second eldest son, Rivalen Tanthul was the High Priest of Shar in Faerûn he also commanded the services of his Chief Counselor Hadrhune. Tanthuls wife Alashar was murdered by Rivalen to complete a pact with Shar made prior to Karsuss Folly.\nTelamont, during his time as the arcanist Shadow, was noted for creating a number of spells centered around shadow magic.
