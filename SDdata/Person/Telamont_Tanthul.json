        "mainbody": "High Prince '''Telamont Tanthul''' was a powerful [[Netherese]] [[shade]] [[archmage]] and [[arcanist]] of the [[Shadow Weave]] and the ruler of [[Thultanthar]], also known as Shade Enclave.",
        "Description": "Tall and hardy, Telamont had diminished little in stature over his millennia-long existence.",
        "Personality": "Telamont had a great love of Netherese culture and sought to preserve it even when his subjects and he were forced onto the [[Plane of Shadow]]. His unwavering determination to rule the city meant that he considered himself to be the true embodiment of the city's culture, laws, and beliefs. Telamont's composure was such that it was near-impossible to get a bead on what he was truly thinking or feeling and he had an unwavering eye for easily seeing through the facades of others.",
        "History": {
            "Early Life": "Born in {{YearlinkName|-645}}, As he grew in ability, he was credited with creating numerous spells based around shadow magic. During his time at the academy, Telamont published a work that postulated the existence of [[demiplane]]s. Unfortunately, his ideas were considered to be completely at odds with the existing models of the planes and he was soon exiled.",
            "Rise and Fall of Shadow": "Luckily, the ruler of Eileanar, [[Karsus]], decided to grant Shadow sanctuary and bequeathed him the [[Shadow Consortium]] to continue his research. Well-warded by Karsus' magic, Shadow gathered other \"fringe\" researchers to help him and after eleven years he was ready. With Karsus's blessing, Shadow published his work on the [[Demiplane of Shadow]] called ''[[Shadows: The Palpable Cohesion of Formless Corporeality]]''. This new work proved the existence of demiplanes and [[quasielemental plane]]s without undermining the existing planar mechanics. It was such a success that all restrictions on demiplane research were lifted and Shadow was released from all charges. In addition, attendance to the Academy of Mentalist Study rose by 30% for the next five years when it was revealed that Shadow had studied there.\n\n[[File:Shadow and Alashar.png|thumb|250px|''Shadow and Alashar escaping.'']]\nHowever, in {{YearlinkName|-390}}, Shadow found himself romantically entangled with a [[bard]] from [[Xinlenal]] called [[Alashar Crywinds]]. Despite all charges for his work being lifted many years earlier, Alashar had been secretly assigned by the archwizard [[Grenway]] to kill Shadow. When this was revealed to Shadow, both he and Alashar found they were unable to kill each other and instead managed to stage their deaths with the use of a ''[[simulacrum]]''. Successful in their ruse, the two married and traveled together to the Demiplane of Shadow.",
            "Escaping the Fall": "Telamont Tanthul (under his guise as Lord Shadow) became Thultanthar's [[archwizard]] and was experimenting with the Plane of Shadow for some time before [[Karsus's Folly]]. He successfully shifted the entire city into the Plane of Shadow in the {{YearlinkName|-339}}, mere days before [[Karsus]] cast ''[[Karsus's avatar]]'' and temporarily destroyed the [[Weave]]. For some reason though, Tanthul could not immediately move the city back to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It took weeks, but eventually they managed to return to Netheril, or at least what was left of it. Searching for survivors for days, the city floated over the ruins of the Netherese empire. Finding none, Tanthul assumed it was the work of the [[phaerimm]] and began planning his revenge. He stopped though, when he realized that one city was not a match for them and that his subjects were likely the last of the empire's people. He abandoned those plans and retreated back into the Plane of Shadow, vowing that one day, they would return and reestablish the empire. The city's [[clerics]] of [[Shar]] cast [[divination]]s and saw what had really happened, but only informed the noble families, presumably at the whim of Shar herself for some reason. The excursion into the Plane of Shadow, due to unforeseen circumstances, lasted much longer than Tanthul anticipated. For over 1,700 years, the inhabitants battled the [[malaugrym]] and the other shadowy horrors of the realm, while each generation became gradually more attuned to the plane itself, becoming what were later known as [[Shadovar]].",
            "Return of the Archwizard": "At last, in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, High Prince Telamont Tanthul returned Thultanthar to [[Faerûn]] as the City of Shade. When he considered the time to be right, Telamont planned to reveal to the Shadovar that he was the Lord Shadow of legend to inspire them to victory.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1487}}, Telamont tried to gain the power of [[Myth Drannor]]'s ''[[mythal]]'' so that Shar could become the new deity of magic. He and his fellow Shadovar were stopped by [[Larloch]], who wanted to absorb the ''mythal'' himself, and Telamont was killed by [[Elminster]]. Thultanthar fell upon Myth Drannor and both cities were destroyed."
        },
        "Abilities": "Well over two millennia old, Telamont preserved his life by means of powerful magic, such as ''[[wish]]'' spells. This process was made easier by virtue of the fact that he was no longer [[human]], but rather an [[outsider]] and the natural life span of a [[shade]] was many times longer that that of an ordinary human. However, Telamont acknowledged reluctantly that as his outsider body began to fail, stronger measures were required to keep him alive. He had not yet decided on the best means of continuing his existence, but the Shadovar's return to Faerûn offered a wealth of possibilities, including transformation into an [[undead]] creature. By 1372 DR, Tanthul's body was composed of pure shadow magic.<ref>",
        "Relations": "Tanthul had thirteen sons, the [[Princes of Shade]], all potent warriors and spellcasters. His second eldest son, [[Rivalen Tanthul]] was the High [[Cleric|Priest]] of Shar in Faerûn; he also commanded the services of his Chief Counselor [[Hadrhune|Hadrhune.]] Tanthul's wife Alashar was murdered by Rivalen to complete a pact with Shar made prior to Karsus's Folly.<ref>",
        "Creations": "Telamont, during his time as the arcanist Shadow, was noted for creating a number of spells centered around [[shadow magic]]. They follow here with the year the spells were created:\n*''[[shadow door|Shadow's door]]'' in {{Yearlink|-600}}\n*''[[shades|Shadow's shades]]'' in {{Yearlink|-597}}\n*''[[demishadow magic|Shadow's demimagic]]'' in {{Yearlink|-594}}\n*''[[summon shadow|Shadow's summons]]'' in {{Yearlink|-594}}\n*''[[Shadow evocation|Shadow's magic]]'' in {{Yearlink|-593}}\n*''[[shadow walk|Shadow's walk]]'' in {{Yearlink|-592}}\n*''[[shadow monsters|Shadow's monster]]'' in {{Yearlink|-588}}\n*''[[demishadow monster|Shadow's demimonster]]'' in {{Yearlink|-587}}"
