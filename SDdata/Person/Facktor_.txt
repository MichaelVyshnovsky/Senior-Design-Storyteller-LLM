'''Facktoré''' was a [[rock gnome]] inventor and guard of [[Gnomengarde]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Facktoré was mad, caring only about her inventions and not at all for anything or anyone else. As a guard stationed in Gnomengarde at the controls of one of her inventions, a contraption of four autoloading heavy [[crossbow]]s, she was prone to open fire on visitors simply to test the device, not stopping until she or her machine were incapacitated.

She often struggled to form coherent sentences, and was unwilling or unable to hold a conversation.

==Abilities==
In addition to her innate [[gnome|gnomish]] abilities, Facktoré (like everyone else in Gnomengarde) had some training as a [[wizard]].
