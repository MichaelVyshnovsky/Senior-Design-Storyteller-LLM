Fishers in the Lower City kept pulling up [[net]]s filled with fish covered in black [[oil]]y goo. In reality, the [[fish]] was smothered in oil pollution left behind by a [[submersible]] used by the [[Cult of Bane]] to transport [[Lord Gortash]]'s prisoners into the drowned [[Iron Throne headquarters]] prison at the bottom of Gray Harbor."
