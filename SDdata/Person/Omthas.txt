'''Omthas''' was a well-known Prophet of [[Lathander]] who was active in the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Omthas was a religious figure renowned by laypeople and the clergy of the [[Church of Lathander]] of the Realms. The prophet was considered dead as nothing had been heard about him since the 8{{th}} century DR. As of the mid-14{{th}} century DR, "Beard of Omthas!" or "by the Beard of Omthas!", or simply "Beard!" were exclamations used by [[cleric]]s of the church that expressed profane amazement.
