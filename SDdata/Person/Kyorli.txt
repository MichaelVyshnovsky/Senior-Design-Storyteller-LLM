'''Kyorli''' was the female [[rat]] familiar of [[Gromph Baenre]], the [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]].

==Personality==
Gromph and Kyorli were relatively close and affectionate with one another.  She had a rat's intelligence, however, and was easily distracted.

==Abilities==
Kyorli couldn't see well in the dark (at least compared to a [[drow]]) and was colorblind. Gromph could communicate with her mentally.
 
==History==
In [[1372 DR]], Kyorli aided Gromph in escaping from the [[Lord Dyrr|lichdrow Dyrr]]'s ''[[imprisonment]]'' spell. She temporarily acted as Gromph's eyes after he was blinded by his attack on [[Nimor Imphraezl]]. When Gromph received an eye transplant, Gromph forced Kyorli to eat out his blind eyes so that [[Jaemas Xorlarrin]] could cast a spell to transplant the newly retrieved eyes to Gromph.
