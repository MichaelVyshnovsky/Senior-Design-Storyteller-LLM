        "mainbody": "Malazan was an old colossal red dragon who was one of the primary agents of Sammaster during the Rage of Dragons of 1373 DR.\nIn 1373 DR, under Sammasters orders, Malazan led a horde of goblinoids to conquer the fortress at the Vaasan Gate. Later, Malazan led a force of chromatic dragons at the siege of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose. Thanks to a deception by the copper dragon  Chatulio, she was forced to duel to the death and kill her fellow green dragon Ishenalyr. When the metallic dragon army led by Dorn Graybrook attacked from behind, the evil chromatic dragons were defeated and Dorn, together with the song dragon Karasendrieth and silver dragons Azhaq and Moonwing, managed to kill Malazan."
