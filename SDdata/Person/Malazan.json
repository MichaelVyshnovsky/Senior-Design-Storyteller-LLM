        "History": "In 1373 DR, under Sammaster's orders, Malazan led a horde of [[goblinoid]]s to conquer the fortress at the [[Vaasan Gate]]. Later, Malazan led a force of [[chromatic dragon]]s at the siege of the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]]. Thanks to a deception by the copper dragon  [[Chatulio]], she was forced to duel to the death and kill her fellow [[green dragon]] [[Ishenalyr]]. When the [[metallic dragon]] army led by [[Dorn Graybrook]] attacked from behind, the evil chromatic dragons were defeated and Dorn, together with the [[song dragon]] [[Karasendrieth]] and [[silver dragon]]s [[Azhaq]] and [[Moonwing]], managed to kill Malazan."
