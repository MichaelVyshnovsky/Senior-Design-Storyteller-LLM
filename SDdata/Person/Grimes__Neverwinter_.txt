'''Grimes''' was one of the musicians hired by [[Torlinn Shrake]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{HAT-time}}

==Possessions==
Like the rest of the orchestra at Torlinn's estate – the [[West Caraway Acres]], Grimes was equipped with ''[[boots of spider climbing]]''.

==History==
Unbeknownst to all, Torlinn Shrake was defeated and replaced by his [[beholder]] nemesis – [[Sharrestren]], several decades before the late 15{{th}} century DR. The eye tyrant used the wizard's name and wealth to throw lavish weekly parties and masquerades. Grimes was among hired orchestra musicians during the creature's last revel. Using ''boots of spider climbing,'' the musicians were to play their instruments while upside-down on the ceiling, to the guests' delight. Between performances, Grimes made an error accepting a drugged drink from [[Forge Fitzwilliam]], a charming [[rogue]], who was part of a heist crew led by [[Edgin Darvis]]. After being knocked out, Forge left Grimes to sleep it off next to the fellow knocked-out [[lute]] player. Grimes's ''boots of spider climbing'' were claimed by the rogue.
