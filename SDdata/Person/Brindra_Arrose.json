        "mainbody": "rindra Arrose was a pirate who was a loyal crewmember of the Kissing Shark helmed by Blackfingers Ralingor in the Utter East in the late 14 century DR.\nBrindra was a barrel-shaped woman.\nBrindra was very muscular and could defeat many men in a brawl.\nBrindra was a sea-toughened individual.\nBrindra was a good comrade of all the Sharkers. She was very upset with Belmer Droon for his killing of Kurthe Lornar.\nSometime in the , the Kissing Shark was destroyed by a blast of smoke powder. Blackfingers Ralingor perished and only seven of the Sharkers survived Sharessa was one of them. Together, the Sharkers saved one chest off the Kissing Shark. Later, the group found themselves in the tavern of Donders Dancing Masques in Tharkar. There a mysterious benefactor named Belmer Droon rescued them from one of the frequent bar fights, and helped the Sharkers avoid the brutal law enforcement of the Daggers of Tharkar.\nOnce the Sharkers and their savior reached the safety of Ankle Bells, Belmer revealed his agenda for generous pay, he wanted to hire a group of mercenaries to perform a mission in the capital of Doegan. After the pirates agreed, Belmer had them sign writs and they embarked on a mission to find and assassinate a noblewoman, Eidola of Neverwinter. \nUnder the cover of night, in secrecy, the group boarded the ship Morning Bird. Soon after the ship left the port, it came under an attack from an unknown black ship that bombarded the Bird with fire pot missiles and terrifying bone balls that melted away in the flames, revealing dancing floating armed skeletons. The Sharkers and their benefactors managed to fight off the undead and evaded the black ship with the aid of Balmers box of mists and a prayer-token of Umberlee. The box transported the ship into a different part of the sea away from the pursuit, but the prayer token of the fickle goddess summoned her servants on board a ghost ship. The ship spawned the dreaded sea zombies and the crew of Morning Bird had to appease Umberlee by tossing their valuables overboard.\nDuring the short respite, the suspicious employer mixed an exotic drug called yulchass powder in with the crews food. The powder had a side effect of making its imbibers truthful. This made the Konigheimers even more suspicious of their boss, even though Belmer had good reasons. The ship followed them, somehow tracking them. After a long search, the Sharkers and Belmer found a magical scrying device hidden on the bottom on the Sharkers chest.\nSoon after, the mysterious black ship, now identified as the Black Dragon, caught up with the Morning Bird. The pursuing captain was the infamous Orim Redbeard, the pirate responsible for the death of Blackfingers Ralingor. Orim Redbeard realized that he pursued the wrong ship, and left the Sharkers in peace. However, Kurthe Lornar tried to kill Belmer and he attacked the benefactor in blind rage, while his fellow Sharkers stayed out of combat. Belmer showed uncanny skill and finesse in avoiding Kurthes brutal attacks. Giving the hotheaded pirates plenty of warnings, Belmer continued leaving cuts and slices on the Konigheimers body. The pirate never stood down and died soaked in his own blood with Belmers dagger in his neck. Brindra and Jolloth Burbuck noticed that Belmer had only played with Kurthe.\nBrinda survived the sinking of the Morning Bird alongside the Sharkers and a big group of Jander Turbalts sailors.\nLater, one by one, all the sailors were killed by a stray bone devil and only the Sharkers remained. At last, when the survivors were near salvation on seeing the city walls of Eldrinpar, the bone devil attacked and blinded Ingrar Welven. Soon after, the devil used a wall of ice spell to separate Brinda, Sharessa Stagwood, and Belmer and it confronted Brindra in a one-on-one battle but the devil managed to defeat Brindra. After it tortured the woman for a while, it finally killed her.\nBrindra had an enchanted cutlass taken from a Ulgarthan buccaneer."
