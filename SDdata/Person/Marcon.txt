'''Marcon''' was an [[adventurer]] of the [[Brightstar Sash]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
To [[Caladnei]] during their last stint together, he had become too reckless about assignments he accepted for the party.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|282-283|17}}

==Activities==
He was a member of the [[Brightstar Sash]] adventurers.

==Relationships==
His fellows at the Brightstar Sash, [[Vonda]] in particular, believed he was leering at the young Caladnei too much.

==History==
Marcon was a member of the Brightstar Sash at the time when Caladnei joined, one day at the [[Cracked Flagon]] inn in [[Turmish]]. He was a part of the team later, when the group acquired a booty of six thousand [[gp]].

Marcon was one of the members of the Sash that survived a purge after Vonda and [[Rimardo]] attempted to rob a nobleman in [[Waterdeep]]; he dashed into the school of [[Nathdarr]] to warn Caladnei they were being hunted, in time for the members to flee Waterdeep. He found new members for the group before their last mission together in [[Halruaa]]; Caladnei left them after their assignment under [[Meleghost Telchaedrin]], leaving Marcon as the last member of the original Brightstar Sash.
