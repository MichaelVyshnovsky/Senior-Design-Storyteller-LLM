Marcon was an adventurer of the Brightstar Sash in the late 14 century DR.
To Caladnei during their last stint together, he had become too reckless about assignments he accepted for the party.
He was a member of the Brightstar Sash adventurers.
His fellows at the Brightstar Sash, Vonda in particular, believed he was leering at the young Caladnei too much.
Marcon was a member of the Brightstar Sash at the time when Caladnei joined, one day at the Cracked Flagon inn in Turmish. He was a part of the team later, when the group acquired a booty of six thousand gp.
Marcon was one of the members of the Sash that survived a purge after Vonda and Rimardo attempted to rob a nobleman in Waterdeep he dashed into the school of Nathdarr to warn Caladnei they were being hunted, in time for the members to flee Waterdeep. He found new members for the group before their last mission together in Halruaa Caladnei left them after their assignment under Meleghost Telchaedrin, leaving Marcon as the last member of the original Brightstar Sash.
