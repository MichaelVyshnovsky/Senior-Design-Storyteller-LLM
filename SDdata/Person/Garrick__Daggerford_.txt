Garrick was a gnome and cleric of Tymora inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He lived in a small house located in central Daggerford on the northern perimeter of the drill field. Garrick distanced himself from Fairfortune Hall and planned to test Tymoras blessings by traveling the countryside.
