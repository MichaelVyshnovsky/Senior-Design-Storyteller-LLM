As of the , Blue Bess was considered a good breeding stock. In the spring of that year, she produced a new brood of three from mating with another miniature behir named Ethan, under the watchful eye of artificer Justin, the proprietor of the Behirs Nest. Blue Besss spawn were kept in a series of shallow pools within the shop where the young creatures were groomed, fed with chopped-up fish and eels, and allowed to lounge on sunning rocks until purchased. All three of Blue Besss brood had only six legs, owing to their young age, and topaz-blue scales, which was a color popular among the mages of Khaerbaal.
The hero of the Battle of Akhlaurs Swamp, Tzigone, briefly worked at Behirs Nest, taking care of Blue Besss brood in the spring of 1370 DR.
