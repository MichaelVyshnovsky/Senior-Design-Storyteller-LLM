'''Ralgorax''', known as the "'''Sword of [[Tyr]]'''", was a mighty [[paladin]] who lived sometime before the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
He fought with a [[great sword]] and [[shield]].

==History==
Ralgorax died in battle alongside his [[horse]], yet many years later&mdash;when both were little more than shriveled corpses&mdash;they rode again as [[undead]] to defend Ralgorax's home village from a nighttime attack by a horde of [[orc]]s. He rode through the village while banging his sword and shield to rouse and warn the people, and then fought off the orcish scouts until dawn. But in the light of day, the villagers were disgusted to see his undead appearance, so he sadly saluted them before charging to meet the horde head-on.
