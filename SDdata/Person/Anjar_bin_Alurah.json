        "mainbody": "Anjar bin Alurah was a prince of Hiyal around 1367 DR and the favored son of Sultan Alurah bint Asrah.\nAnjar was intelligent and strong and obeyed his mothers wishes. His greatest fault was his lack of subtlety. Anjar always favored an extreme direct approach.\nThough Anjar had not been officially appointed as the Sultanas heir, he was given the title of Grand Commander of Hiyals army.\nAnjar was the eldest of five children."
