Gwynharwyf ( Kostchtchie hated her so much that when his cult captured women to use as sacrificial victims they dyed their hair silver, dressed them like Gwynharwyf, and strapped scimitars to their hands before slaughtering them.
Gwynharwyf was with the eladrin armies when they defeated the obyriths on the Plain of Infinite Portals, the event that led to the rise of the tanarri as the rulers of the Abyss.
Throughout history, Gwynharwyf was responsible for the downfall of many of the most powerful of wicked entities. Hearing tales of the undying mortal Kostchtchie and his murderous rages, Gwynharwyf led a great army against him and his tribe but could not defeat them. Fortunately, she discovered the black diamond that stored his hateful soul, inside a series of nested skulls, and crushed it. With that act, his soul returned to his body, and, consumed with rage, he slaughtered his own army until even he was exhausted. Unable to defend himself, Gwynharwyf then stepped in and slew Kostchtchie, sending him to the Abyss. (It was only later that he returned as a demigod.)
Demogorgon once allied with Ilsidahur of the barlguras to re-open the portal known as the Shining Vortex of Mesnar from the Abyssal forest of Morathkian to Arborea. Through it, the two demon lords led an army in revenge against the eladrins ancient invasion of the Abyss. Gwynharwyfs armies pushed the fiendish forces back to the Abyss, but in order to seal the portal, she had to sacrifice herself and remained trapped there. Gwynharwyf was taken prisoner, but the two demon lords could not agree on the best way to torture and kill the bralani princess, and Morwel came with a force of her own to free her cherished consort from their grasp. Ilsidahur lost his right hand during the rescue.
