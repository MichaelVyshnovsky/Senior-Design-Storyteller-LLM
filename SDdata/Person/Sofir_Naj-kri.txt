Sofir Naj-kri was an elven inhabitant of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
As the head of the College of Alchemy, Sofir possessed a natural love of chemicals. She and one other instructor taught all of the classes that dealt with alchemy.
Since she lacked the formulas for many rare potions, Sofir would potentially wave tuition fees in exchange for such a formula.
