'''Custen Meen''' was a humble cobbler from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''These new Guild rates are strangling business. I've sought an audience with your bursar already. He tells me it's wartime, and the city needs a well-provisioned Guild. I tell him - and you - that the city will still need its cobblers when all of this is done.''|Custen Meen}}

==History==
Custen Meen was a friend of the parents of the notorious leader of [[The Guild]] – [[Nine-Fingers Keene]]. When the Guildleader was just a young girl named Astele Keene, she was abducted and her hostage. During that time, Custen Meen sought the missing girl alongside her parents, and when she was returned, he celebrated with the family.

Decades later, by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Nine-Fingers ran the Guild with an iron fist, collecting protection racket money from businesses of Baldur's Gate, including Custen Meen, a simple cobbler. When the city faced the [[Absolute crisis]], the Guild faced an underground turf war with a new power – the [[Stone Lord]]. Losing territory, money, and manpower, Nine-Fingers and her bursar [[Uktar (The Guild)|Uktar]] dramatically increased the prices for protection. Many could not pay, including Custen, who pleaded with the bursar and with the Guilmaster herself. Custen's business was being strangled, and he stated that when the wars were over, the city would still need crafters and cobblers like him. Sadly, Custen's fleas fell on deaf ears.
