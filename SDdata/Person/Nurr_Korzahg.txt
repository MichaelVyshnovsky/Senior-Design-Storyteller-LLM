NurrKorzahg was an illithid of ChChitl in the Northdark of the Underdark in 1372 DR.
A close meeting with death shook NurrKorzahg deeply. It started considering if one could live without subjugating inferior beings and eating their brains. NurrKorzahg thought about helping non-illithids, just to see what would happen in such occasions.
At one point, Nurrkorzahg contracted a rotting illness that threatened its life. He ultimately survived, only losing three tentacles to amputation.
