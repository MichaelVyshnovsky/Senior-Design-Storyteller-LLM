Stellok Kolraavi was the dreadful great chief of the Black Lion tribe during the late 15 century DR. As a leader he did not believe in acting diplomatically and had no ties with nearby "civilized" cultures.
Stelloks younger sister, Tysis served as the shaman of the Black Lion tribe. She was the only advisor he could truly rely upon.
Great Chief Stellok wore hide armor made from the skin of an orc.
