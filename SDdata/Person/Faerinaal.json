        "mainbody": "'''Faerinaal''' ({{Pronounce|FAY|reh|nayl|refs=}}) was an [[Celestial eladrin|eladrin]] [[celestial paragon]] and consort of the eladrin queen [[Morwel]]. He dwelt in the [[Court of Stars]] with her and oversaw the defenses of that realm. He was also sworn to rescue eladrin captured by evil forces and taken to dangerous locations such as the [[Abyss]]. He lived with Morwel in the [[Gates of the Moon]].",
        "Description": "Faerinaal appeared as a handsome and graceful eladrin. He wore a midnight-blue robe covered with silver stars and arcane symbols. He often wielded a shining [[longsword]]. He could also take the form of a scintillating globe of light, which was just as much his true form as the humanoid one.",
        "Personality": "He was known to have a mischievous air about him, but was absolutely dedicated to Morwel and was willing to die to protect his queen.",
        "Abilities": "As a celestial paragon, Faerinaal was the equal of any [[archfiend]] and only the gods were a more powerful force of goodness. He had both [[Bard|bardic]] and [[Wizard|wizardly]] abilities and was a skilled longsword fighter. He could create a powerful protective aura akin to a combined ''[[magic circle against evil]]'' and ''[[minor globe of invulnerability]]'' at will, as well as slay evil creatures with his gaze. He could also cast a ray of energy that would send the target into a dream-filled sleep. Evil creatures under this effect were wracked with psychically damaging nightmares. Upon transforming into his globe form, he could use powerful ray attacks as well.",
        "Activities": "A significant portion of Faerinaal's time was spent overseeing the strategy of the [[celestial]]s of the [[Layers of the Abyss|layer]] of [[Androlynne]] in their perpetual conflict to protect the remaining eladrin children who were trapped there because of an ancient mistake made by one of his predecessors.",
        "History": "Faerinaal was with the eladrin armies when they defeated the [[obyrith]]s on the [[Plain of Infinite Portals]], the event that led to the rise of the [[tanar'ri]] as the rulers of the Abyss.{{Cite dungeon/149/Enemies of My Enemy|57-58}}"
