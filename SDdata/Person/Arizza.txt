'''Arizza''' was the bookkeeper of the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] in [[Skullport]] in [[1479 DR]].

==Activities==
Arizza was the only [[human]] slave living in the [[Xanathar]]'s lair, as it preferred [[elven]] slaves. Arizza was an exception because of her eidetic memory, which made her the perfect bookkeeper for the [[beholder]]. She was always at the Xanathar's side during business meetings, ready to use her memory.[[Derek Myers]]. "The Xanathar: Beholder Crime Lord of Waterdeep." ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #206. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, September 2012.

==Personality==
Arizza, thanks to her memory, was very good with numbers and figures. She had few social skills. Arizza would never betray the Xanathar or do something that would hurt him.

==Relationship==
Arizza, having no family or friends, had developed an attachment to the Xanathar.
