'''Frub''' was a [[kobold]] from the [[Dragon's Rest]] cloister in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Frub had limitless energy and relished asking questions about the activities of the cloister's inhabitants.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1481}},{{Stormwreck-time}} Frub shared with three other kobolds a small [[Dragon's Rest#Monastic cells|monastic cell]] in the Dragon's Rest cloister cut into the cliff face. Each of the four slept on individual hammocks. Just like all the other kobolds, he worked at night because of their sunlight sensitivity.
