Marquen of Silverymoon was a warrior living in Luruar in the late 15th century DR.
Marquen lived in Silverymoon until circa 1474 DR when he relocated to Nesme.
During the War of the Silver Marches, he was one of the prisoners captured after the fall of Nesme in 1484 DR. Marquen was among the prisoners killed under the orders of Tiago Baenre and Saribel Xorlarrin.
In 1485 DR, Tiago used his appearance in order to deceive Franko Olbert.
