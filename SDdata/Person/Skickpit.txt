Skickpit was a deep gnome slave who was taken to Grymforge along with the other gnomes of Clan Ironhand in the late 15 century DR.
He was not one to be pushed around without pushing back. He responded to his captors demeaning nicknames with some of his own.
He was friends with Thulla, who became separated from the rest of her kin during the raid.
In the , the gnomes of Clan Ironhand were attacked by duergar allied with the cult of the Absolute. Many of their clan were killed, while others were taken captive as slaves to excavate the ruins of Grymforge. Skickpit was among the latter group. He was forced to endure the ridicule and degradation doled out by Ward Magmar.
