        "History": "Toyo was the younger son of [[Sumitomo Koji]], master of the Doi No Fugu. In his youth, he was very close to his older brother, [[Sumitomo Yoichi]], who was always fascinated by stories of travelers, and his younger sister [[Sumitomo Skoshi]].\n\nWhen, as tradition dictated, Yoichi was sent outside [[Maeshi Province]] for training as a chef, Toyo and Skoshi knew he would never come back. He didn't, and Toyo became the heir. With the turmoil in the province between the [[Michimori clan]] and the [[Korimori clan]], he undertook his training at home.\n\nIn [[1359 DR]], the [[ronin]] [[Haka Kinnori]] arrived at the inn. After a talk with their father, Koji, he started to live with them. Soon Toyo and Skoshi befriended Haka, who also taught them [[karate]]."
