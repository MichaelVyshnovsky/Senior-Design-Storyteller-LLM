Karel Mahorne was a human cleric of Mielikki who dedicated her life to the curing of lycanthropes and who was the leader of the Silver Stake, an organization with this goal.
Because of her by then considerable age, during the years following the Time of Troubles, she worked exclusively from the companys compound near Baldurs Gate.
Early in her life, Karels husband and child were slain by a werewolf pack. She went on to form the Silver Stake with Dram Kallen and they were joined by others who had a similar cause.
