'''Tia Harriman''' was an ambassador sent by King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] of [[Cormyr]] to the city-state of [[Innarlith]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She was stout and heavy.

==History==
She was appointed as ambassador of Corymyr to Innarlith in [[1365 DR]]. Cormyr previously didn't have an embassy in Innarlith, but after Innarlith began a project to construct a canal from the Lake of Steam to the [[Nagaflow]], which would have thus connected the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to the oceans of [[Toril]], Cormyr took an interest and decided to establish an embassy.

She attended Ransar [[Salatis]]'s [[New Year's Masque]] during the last evening of 1365 DR, dressed in an eagle costume, and met a number of the elite members of Innarlan society. She expressed Cormyr's hopes for the canal's completion but was surprised when she heard from some senators allied with the clandestine [[Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rymüt]] that the work would not be completed and that it was a fool's errand.
