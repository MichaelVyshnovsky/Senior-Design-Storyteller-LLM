        "mainbody": "Ansgul Khaundrove was a member of the Khaundrove House, one of the twenty Onsruur (council of lords) families in Kh√¥ltar, the Iron City, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. He lived with other members of his family in Baharrokhbrur, a fancy sculpted stone mansion near the southern gate into the city.\nOld Ansgul thought that most foreigners were either stupid or foolish and this was borne out by the fact that his family made huge profits selling cheep versions of ironmongery made from the lowest quality raw materials to \"perfumed Calimshan, where theyre too decadent to know any better\", for example.\nLike the rest of the Khaundrove clan, Ansgul had a strong dislike for their chief rivals, the Horthanders&mdashanother influential family in the Iron City."
