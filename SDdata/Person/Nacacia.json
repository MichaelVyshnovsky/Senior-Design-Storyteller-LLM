        "mainbody": "'''Nacacia''' was a female [[half-elf]] slave in [[Myth Drannor]], in service to [[Llombaerth Starym|the Masked]], and a caster during the laying of the ''[[mythal]]''.",
        "Personality": "She'd been bubbly and pranksome when she started her apprenticeship. However, by the end of it, she was no longer a prankster. She remained merry and bright, though.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|317|324}}",
        "Description": "As of {{yearlink|324}}, she had long auburn hair and a surprisingly strong back. She most often wore black breeches and a vest.",
        "Abilities": "She could cast one lashing lightning spell that struck many, almost certainly ''[[lightning bolt]]'', and ''[[magic missile]]''. One of her spells, which she often used for her master's pleasure, animated her hair; she also worked spells in [[spell-web]]s craeted by her master.",
        "Relationships": "Her master, [[Llombaerth Starym]], always known as the Masked, often called on her to animate her hair for his entertainment in evenings at his chambers. Though she flirted with [[Elminster Aumar]], the master's other apprentice, her master actively crushed any flirting and punished them severely for it. She became the latter's paramour at some point between {{yearlink|261}} and {{yearlink|650}}.",
        "History": "Nacacia was a young half-elf in Cormanthyr before the [[Opening]]; she was brought by the Masked to his tower as a young lass, sometime after he began tutoring the [[human]] [[Elminster Aumar]] in the ways of the [[Elven High Magic]]. He taught her too, in order to use them as his instruments.\n\nAt one point, The Masked tricked Elminster into using Nacacia's life in a ''[[lifequench]]'' spell to block out [[Mythanthar]]'s magic, so as to assassinate him more easily. Though Elminster believed he'd actually killed her and was unaware that Mythanthor was inside,{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|330-332|18}} unknown to him, Mythanthar had blocked the spell and made her only appear to be dead through a ''[[seeming]]''; this was revealed later, when the Masked, revealed to be Llombaerth Starym, attempted to frame Elminster at the Coronal's court.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|333-338|19}} Later, when Llombaerth unleashed his coup against the Coronal, she helped Elminster to break free from one of his spells, and even cast a few spells in support of the Coronal.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|343-345|20}}\n\nLater, Nacacia helped to raise the ''[[mythal]]''. She was admitted to the innermost ring of casters,{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|355|Epilogue}} becoming one of the tertiary casters who imbued minor powers in it.",
