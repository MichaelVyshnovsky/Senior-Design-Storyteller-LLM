'''Usilie Rostik''' was a shopkeeper in [[Mulmaster]] in [[1491 DR]].

==Personality==

==Activities==
Usilie ran [[Usilie Rostik's Smoke Shoppe]], a very popular shop in the city.{{Cite adventurers league/Breath of the Yellow Rose|18}}

==History==
In 1491 DR, Usilie was interrogated by an adventuring party hired to found some missing noble scions. He admitted that most of them were clients of his shop. Possibly under input of [[Order of the Gauntlet]], the adventurers discovered his role in silkroot's traffic and arrested him.{{Cite adventurers league/Breath of the Yellow Rose|18-20}}
