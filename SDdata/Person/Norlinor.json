        "History": "In life Norlinor was the \"Artisan of the Forge\" of his stronghold's Great Forge, tasked with maintaining it. When the [[Battle of the Dead]] occurred he was one of the stronghold's many inhabitants that died fighting the hordes of [[drow]] controlled [[undead]].\n\nSome time following the destruction of Dorn's Deep, the spirit of Norlinor was raised from the dead as a [[ghost]] by the activities of a [[necromancer]] named [[Terikan]]. He was one of the only inhabitants of Dorn's Deep whose will managed to avoid subjugation by the necromancer upon being risen from death. When a group of adventurers traveled through the ruins of his stronghold in [[1281 DR]] he tasked them with putting an end to Terikan, who had by then achieved [[lich]]dom."
