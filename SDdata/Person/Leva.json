        "mainbody": "eva was one of the engineers that worked at the logging camp by the Lantan-Samarach portal in the jungles of Samarlogh in the late 14 century DR.\nLeva had a youthful face and hay-colored hair. He wore his facial hair in a trimmed goatee.\nBy the , Leva was among the gnomes who staffed the illegal logging operation in the Samarlogh. A fellow engineer Tamith Timekeep created an improved logging machine design that sparked Levas greed. He wanted the blueprints for himself to gain acclaim and a hefty bonus pay. Leva convinced lonely Tamith he sought her affection and lured her into the jungle to be murdered. Leva lied to Dall Nickleplate, the camps overseer, blaming Tamiths death on a dinosaur attack. He burned and buried her body in secrecy outside the logging camp. However, the violent death created a vengeful ghost who sought justice appearing outside the camp every night\nWhen a group of adventurers hired by merchant SaSani of Samargol arrived at the Lantan-Samarach portal, they helped the gnomes in dealing with several incidents, including the poisoning of the camps main engineer. They came across Tams disoriented ghost and followed the undeads directions to her charred body with a distinct melted necklace. When Tamith Timekeeps body was presented to Dall Nickleplate, he immediately recognized the jewelry and realized Levas guilt. As Leva was being interrogated, Tamiths angry spirit attacked and killed the murderer. Her spirit found peace, as Dall sent both bodies back to Lantan for burial."
