        "mainbody": "'''Leva''' was one of the engineers that worked at the logging camp by the ''[[Lantan-Samarach portal]]'' in the jungles of [[Samarlogh]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Leva had a youthful face and hay-colored hair. He wore his facial hair in a trimmed goatee.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Leva was among the gnomes who staffed the illegal logging operation in the Samarlogh. A fellow engineer [[Tamith Timekeep]] created an improved logging machine design that sparked Leva's greed. He wanted the blueprints for himself to gain acclaim and a hefty bonus pay. Leva convinced lonely Tamith he sought her affection and lured her into the jungle to be murdered. Leva lied to [[Dall Nickleplate]], the camp's overseer, blaming Tamith's death on a [[dinosaur]] attack. He burned and buried her body in secrecy outside the logging camp. However, the violent death created a vengeful [[ghost]] who sought justice appearing outside the camp every night\n\nWhen a group of adventurers hired by merchant [[Sa'Sani]] of [[Samargol]] arrived at the ''Lantan-Samarach portal'', they helped the gnomes in dealing with several incidents, including the poisoning of the camp's main engineer. They came across Tam's disoriented ghost and followed the undead's directions to her charred body with a distinct melted necklace. When Tamith Timekeep's body was presented to Dall Nickleplate, he immediately recognized the jewelry and realized Leva's guilt. As Leva was being interrogated, Tamith's angry spirit attacked and killed the murderer. Her spirit found peace, as Dall sent both bodies back to [[Lantan]] for burial."
