Floon Blagmaar () was a socialite in Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR.
Floon was a handsome human male in his early thirties with wavy red-blond hair.
Floon worked as an escort in a festhall.
In 1492 DR, Floon was generously paid to keep silent about some indiscreet behavior by a married noble couple hed met during his work.
Floon accidentally became involved in a search for lost gold hidden by Dagult Neverember. One night, his friend Volothamp Geddarm invited him to drink at the Skewered Dragon tavern in the Dock Ward but, soon after Volothamp left, the drunken Floon happened to meet his other friend Renaer Neverember. When the two friends left the tavern, some Zhentarim ambushed and captured them with the objective of interrogating Renaer about the lost Stone of Golorr. However, the Zhent hideout was attacked by some of the Xanathars minions, who slaughtered the Zhentarim but mistakenly took away Floon instead of Renaer, whod instead managed to hide.
Afterward, Volothamp hired some adventurers to find him. Heavily tortured, he was on the verge of death when the adventurers hired by Volothamp found him.
Floon was, in a word, a simpleton. He enjoyed drinking and carousing. He did not know what to do with his life but did not care about that, instead living day to day.
Floon was a friend to both Renaer and Volothamp.
