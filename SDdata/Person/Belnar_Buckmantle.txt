'''Belnar Buckmantle''' was a [[War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was young, pale, thin, and curly-haired.

==Personality==
The man was notable in his dedication.

==Activities==
Belnar Buckmantle was a [[War Wizard of Cormyr]].

==History==
Alongside [[Halance Tarandar]], Belnar Buckmantle accompanied the young nobleman [[Arclath Delcastle]] to the [[Dragonriders Club]] as a guest after the [[Open Feast]]; the nobleman invited him as he found him to be exhausted. The trio were entertained by a masked dancer, [[Amarune Whitewave]], while inside.

He was reported dead and decapitated afterwards, with more than a dozen [[Purple Dragon knight]]s.

==Aftermath==
His death drove his friend Halance to write a note to himself about the masked dancer who'd given them all lapdances during their talk, alongside the mental nudging of the evil [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]].
