Belnar Buckmantle was a War Wizard of Cormyr.
Alongside Halance Tarandar, Belnar Buckmantle accompanied the young nobleman Arclath Delcastle to the Dragonriders Club as a guest after the Open Feast the nobleman invited him as he found him to be exhausted. The trio were entertained by a masked dancer, Amarune Whitewave, while inside.
He was reported dead and decapitated afterwards, with more than a dozen Purple Dragon knights.
His death drove his friend Halance to write a note to himself about the masked dancer whod given them all lapdances during their talk, alongside the mental nudging of the evil archmage Manshoon.
