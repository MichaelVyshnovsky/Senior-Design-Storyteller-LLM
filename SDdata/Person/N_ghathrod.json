        "mainbody": "Captain Nghathrod was a mind flayer space pirate and the captain of the spelljammer Scavenger.\nNghathrod had a wooden peg replacing its left foot, which it had lost in battle. It wore pirate clothes and carried a rapier that it did not know how to use, for stylistic reasons.\nA seasoned pirate, Nghathrod was patient and strategic. If in an unfavorable situation, it waited until the best moment to act.\nNghathrod was an arcanist with access to a number of spells. While onboard the Scavenger, it could create psionic illusions and images from the Far Realm that could disorient the minds of its opponents.\nThe mind flayer had among its possessions the four control gems for the gray slaadi in its crew.\nBefore it was turned into a mind flayer via ceremorphosis, Nghathrod was a spacefaring elf. Although it had no memories of its past, it retained some of the elven sense of beauty. Before becoming a pirate, Nghathrod lived in an illithid colony on the planet Glyth.\nSometime in the late 15 century DR, while orbiting Toril, Nghathrods ship was captured by Halaster Blackcloak and transported to the Caverns of Ooze in the depths of Undermountain. Halaster stole the ships spelljamming helm and left the marooned crew and the derelict ship to rot away. After some time, the illithid had to resort to eating the brains of its crew in order to survive. After it killed four of the orogs in the crew, the remaining orogs escaped. Nghathrod then proceeded to wait in its lair for the appearance of other food sources."
