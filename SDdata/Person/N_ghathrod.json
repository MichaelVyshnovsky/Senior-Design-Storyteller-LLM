        "mainbody": "Captain '''N'ghathrod''' was a [[mind flayer]] [[Wildspace|space]] pirate and the captain of the [[spelljammer]] ''[[Scavenger (spelljammer)|Scavenger]]''.",
        "Description": "N'ghathrod had a wooden peg replacing its left foot, which it had lost in battle. It wore pirate clothes and carried a [[rapier]] that it did not know how to use, for stylistic reasons.",
        "Personality": "A seasoned pirate, N'ghathrod was patient and strategic. If in an unfavorable situation, it waited until the best moment to act.",
        "Abilities": "N'ghathrod was an [[Arcane spellcaster|arcanist]] with access to a number of [[spell]]s. While onboard the ''Scavenger'', it could create [[psionic]] [[illusion]]s and images from the [[Far Realm]] that could disorient the minds of its opponents.",
        "Possessions": "The mind flayer had among its possessions the four control gems for the [[gray slaad]]i in its crew.",
        "History": "Before it was turned into a mind flayer via [[ceremorphosis]], N'ghathrod was a spacefaring [[elf]]. Although it had no memories of its past, it retained some of the elven sense of beauty. Before becoming a pirate, N'ghathrod lived in an illithid colony on the planet [[Glyth]].\n\nSometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], while orbiting [[Toril]], N'ghathrod's ship was captured by [[Halaster Blackcloak]] and transported to the [[Caverns of Ooze]] in the depths of [[Undermountain]]. Halaster stole the ship's [[spelljamming helm]] and left the marooned crew and the derelict ship to rot away. After some time, the illithid had to resort to eating the brains of its crew in order to survive. After it killed four of the [[orog]]s in the crew, the remaining orogs escaped. N'ghathrod then proceeded to wait in its lair for the appearance of other food sources."
