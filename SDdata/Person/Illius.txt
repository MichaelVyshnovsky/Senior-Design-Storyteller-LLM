'''Illius''' was a [[sorcerer]] during the 14th century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
He used a staff and a formidable array of magical powers, as well as a set of [[force beads]] he used in combat.

==History==

Illius was born into a line of [[knight]]s, but when he discovered that he had sorcerous powers he pursued that path instead. His father disapproved of this and disowned Illius, though it was later discovered that [[Ygorl]] had mentally influenced Illius' father from inside the [[Demon Stone]].

At some point, Illius trained under [[Khelben Arunsun]]. Later, he adventured with [[Rhannek]] and [[Zhai]], and would come into possession of a [[demon stone]].
