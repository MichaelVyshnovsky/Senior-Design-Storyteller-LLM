{{Quote|You... are a light entering darkness. You... are a seeker of truths. You... are more than you realize.|One of G'axir's prophetic declarations.}}

==Abilities==
While G'axir claimed to see into the lives of others and see their future, his declarations were very vague and unclear.

==Possessions==
He wore a suit of [[chain mail]] armor and regularly carried a [[quarterstaff]].

==Activities==
G'axir was a regular patron of the [[Blade and Stars]] inn found in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] district of Baldur's Gate.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, G'axir sought out a specific [[sphene]] gem found in the "lair of the [[basilisk]]", which was in fact a warehouse in the city's docks.
