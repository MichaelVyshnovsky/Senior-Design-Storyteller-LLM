        "mainbody": "Kori al-Zafiri was a sultan of Tajar in the Pearl Cities of west Zakhara.\nKori formed an alliance with the House of Dhib to rebel against the sultan of Tajar, a position which he then claimed for himself. Kori sent his son to plead their case to the Grand Caliph in Huzuz who sent investigators to determine the situation in Tajar. Koris predecessor was taken back to Huzuz in chains and Kori was given the position of Sultan, or Sheikh as he preffered, of Tajar.\nKoris son, Ali al-Hadd, was the sultan of Tajar in 1367 DR."
