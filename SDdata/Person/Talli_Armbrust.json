        "mainbody": "'''''Talli Armbrust''''' was the wife of [[Tym Armbrust]], a down-on-his-luck tailor, and mother of [[Ayo Armbrust]] from [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''Hello? I, um, wasn't expecting any guests... Are you a friend of my husband, perhaps?''|Talli Armbrust}}",
        "Description": "Talli was a [[human]] woman with a dusky skin tone, long curly brown hair, and dark brown eyes.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Talli's health and wellbeing were threatened by Tym's debt to the notorious [[Guild]] of Baldur's Gate. When Tym was unable to pay, [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] implicitly threatened the tailor's family in a letter and notified him of collectors coming to collect the late fee. The family's struggle was noticeable to Talli's friends, [[Sabine (Baldur's Gate)|Sabine]] and [[Freddie]], who visited the Armbrusts. They offered to help the family out by taking in little Ayo to give  Talli and Tym some privacy and a way to relax."
