'''Thaliach Mindogar''' was a young [[cleric]] of [[Chauntea]] in [[Archendale]] in [[1370 DR]].

{{quote|''While the [[Swords of Archendale|Swords]] worry about the rot in the [[Darkwater Brand]], the true weakness at the heart of [[Archendale]] sits at a map table in the inner sanctom of the house of [[Chauntea]] in [[Archenbridge]] and fancies himself a behind-the-scenes world power.
