They were were granted temporary refuge at the [[Emerald Grove]], by the a[[archdruid]] Master [[Halsin]]. The safe haven they received ended however when  a druid named [[Kagha]] tried to seal away the grove from the tieflings, by means of the ''[[Rite of Thorns]]'' [[ritual]].\n\nWhen a band of [[goblin]]s chased the adventurers [[Aradin]], [[Barth]], and [[Remira]], away from the [[Shattered Sanctum]], they were brough to the doorstop of the [[Emerald Grove]]. The goblins launched a middling assault against the grove, and their archers managed to shoot down Kanon atop the walkway atop its massive front gate."
