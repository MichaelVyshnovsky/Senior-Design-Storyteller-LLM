        "mainbody": "Quorl Vemmil was a priest of Talona and the first Tessarch on the Council of Six, the ruling council of Amn, and Lord of House Vemmil.\nHe was cruel man who used his family business of alchemy, wine, and ale supply to conceal an underground trade in narcotics to the south and east.\nQuorl died in 1345 DR after he plotted to frame the Meisarch Thayze Selemchant by unleashing a plague in Keczulla. Thayze overcame the plot and forced Quorl and his priests to go to Keczulla, where they were killed, either by the plague, or other means."
