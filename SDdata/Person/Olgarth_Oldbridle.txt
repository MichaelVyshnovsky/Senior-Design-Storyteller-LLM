'''Olgarth Oldbridle''' was a head of the [[Oldbridle]] noble family in [[Cormyr]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
The man was cynical and jaded, but friends praised his fellowship and prudence.

==Relationships==
He was the head of the [[Oldbridle]] noble family. His bodyguard was [[Burrath]], and a trusted servant of his' was [[Osbur]]. He'd attempted to ally with the merchant [[Andranth Glarvreth]] twice, without success, and had joined a faction of nobles which included [[Traevyn Illance]]. His son was [[Elbert Oldbridle]].

==History==
Before the [[Council of the Dragon]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Lord Olgarth was invited to the mansion of [[Andranth Glarvreth]], who almost certainly sought an alliance, out of his own initiative this time. He went with his bodyguard [[Burrath]] but just after they entered the mansion's dining room, an order of assassins targeted them. He was killed by [[Kormoroth]] in the fighting.

It turned out later that Olgarth Oldbridle had given instructions to one of his servants, [[Osbur]], to pass on a warning to his son were he to die.
