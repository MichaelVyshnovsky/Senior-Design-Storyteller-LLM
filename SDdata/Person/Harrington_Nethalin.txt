'''Harrington Nethalin''' was the rather curmudgeonly man who penned the book series, ''[[Lessons for Sensible Living]]'' some time during or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|A fellow once told me that Baldur's Gate is actually three cities in one - an outer, an inner, and an upper. I believe he thought I'd be impressed, but I simply spat in his eye and sent him on his way.|''Excerpt from Lessons for Sensible Living.''}}

==Personality==
He believed that folks of the Realms could live their best lives by making sensible choices, such as avoiding large cities and not taking unnecessary risks.
