'''Nimieye''' was a citizen of [[Evereska]] that served as a member of the city's [[Evereskan tomb guardian|Tomb Guard]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He served in the same unit as [[Dynod]] and [[Ehamond]] under the leadership of [[Galaeron Nihmedu]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Nimieye and his fellow tomb guards encountered a group of [[human]] crypt breakers int he ancestral burial chambers of the [[House Vyshaan|Vyshaan]] clan of [[elves]]. The elven soldiers apprehended the intruders, but subsequently came under the influence of the enigmatic [[sorcerer]] [[Melegaunt Tanthul]].

Nimieye and his fellow Dynod watched over the hman pirsoners as their group traveled back to Evereska. They escorted them through the city streets unto the judgement of the city's [[Hill Elders]].
