Rinyon Merrymar was a strongheart halfling shopkeeper in the village of Shining Falls in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She was the wife of Blaz Merrymar. Together, they had two daughters and four sons, as well a number of nephews.
Rinyon handled the day-to-day running of Merrymars Merchandise, the only general store in Shining Falls.
She was known to be confident and strong-willed, and felt her husbands get-rich-quick schemes, such as discovering the dwarven complex behind the Shining Falls waterfall, to be foolish.
In the summer of , goods meant for Merrymars Merchandise were raided on the road by bandits, thought to be orcs of the High Forest. Tragically, Blaz and Rinyon lost not only merchandise but also all four of their sons and three of their nephews, leaving the extended family decimated and the store understaffed. Rinyon and her two daughters were left to run it alone while Blaz went on the road as a merchant.
