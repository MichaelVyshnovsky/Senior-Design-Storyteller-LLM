        "mainbody": "'''Jolan''' was a craftsman within the [[Fellowship of Bards, Performers and Artists]] in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He served as the assistant to guild's Master Craftsmen [[Randall Morann]], overseeing their workshop within the Ravenian [[Guildhouse of the Fellowship of Bards, Performers and Artists|bards' guildhouse]].\n\nBefore he came to assist Morann in his duties, Jolan served as apprentice under his tutelage. While Jolan's skill was nowhere close to that of the master woodworker, his capabilities as an instrument-maker greatly improved under the senior guild member's tutelage."
