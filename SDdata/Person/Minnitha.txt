'''Minnitha''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[white dragon]] heritage in [[Phlan]] during the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].

==History==
In [[1489 DR]], Minnitha planned to search for treasure in the mountains near the city, but in fear of bandits she used a disguise and the name '''Halda''' in town to visit her family. One day, Minnitha went to the [[Madame Freona's Tea Kettle]]. She was briefly interrogated by adventurers hired by [[Buhrell Caah]] about a missing dangerous magic item and used her cover identity.{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|24}}
