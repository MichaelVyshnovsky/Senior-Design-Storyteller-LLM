She later moved to the town of Leilon, which was being rebuilt.\nSilla was a young, highly chatty halfling woman with lengthy braided hair. She was proficient with the harmonica and enjoyed performing in front of an audience.\nCirca 1491 DR, Silla traveled from Neverwinter to Leilon in the hopes of being hired as a fisher by Valdi Estapaar, the towns fisheries overseer. On her way, she stayed at the Wayside Inn and accidentally witnessed an undead attack. The undead had been created by a cult of Myrkul. A group of adventurers was able to defend the inn against the attack. Silla then accompanied the adventurers on their way to Leilon."
