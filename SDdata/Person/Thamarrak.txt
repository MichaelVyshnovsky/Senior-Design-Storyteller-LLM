Thamarrak was one of the Red Wizards of Thay, active during or before the midâ€“14 century DR.
Thamarrak was a victim of an infamous massacre. During one of his dinner parties, twenty chosen ones in his possession went berserk, slaughtering the Red Wizard himself and his guests. This incident was considered to be nothing but an odd, unlikely aberration. The suspicious circumstances, however, fueled rumors claiming that Thamarraks many enemies had found a way of interfering with the magic that was controlling his chosen ones.
