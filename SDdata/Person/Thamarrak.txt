'''Thamarrak''' was one of the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]], active during or before the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Thamarrak was a victim of an infamous massacre. During one of his dinner parties, twenty [[chosen one]]s in his possession went berserk, slaughtering the Red Wizard himself and his guests. This incident was considered to be nothing but an odd, unlikely aberration. The suspicious circumstances, however, fueled rumors claiming that Thamarrak's many enemies had found a way of interfering with the [[magic]] that was controlling his chosen ones.
