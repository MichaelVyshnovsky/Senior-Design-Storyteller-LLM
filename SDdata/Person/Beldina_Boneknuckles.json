The lovely couple left behind an orphan girl with not a single coin to pay for her parents funeral and last rites. The bodies were left in the familys apartment in the Lower City and began to smell by the time Beldina decided to collect a few coppers from the neighbors and plead with a Kelemvorite to perform the appropriate ceremonies of the dead before the bodies would end up being tossed into the River Chionthar.
