        "mainbody": "'''Beldina Boneknuckles''' was a poor commoner who inhabited the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Beldina Boneknuckles's neighbors were killed in a burglary-turned-murder. The lovely couple left behind an orphan girl with not a single [[coin]] to pay for her parents' funeral and last rites. The bodies were left in the family's apartment in the Lower City and began to smell by the time Beldina decided to collect a few [[copper]]s from the neighbors and plead with a [[Kelemvorite]] to perform the appropriate ceremonies of the dead before the bodies would end up being tossed into the [[River Chionthar]]. Beldina's plea was aimed at Mortarch [[Gracie Scyre]], who oversaw the [[Lower City Graveyard]]."
