Shield Duke Bardran Thulmaer was the well-loved leader of the town of Alamontyr.
He was an aging but large man with a huge white mustache. He ruled with a conservative fair style, preferring to consult local religious leaders before making political decisions. This made him well-loved not only with the people of Alamontyr but also the people of the Realm of the Smoking Star to the west.
The forty Griffon Knights were Bardran Thulmaers personal guard and upholders of the peace in Alamontyr. Although the Shield Duke was popular with his people, he had not named a successor, leading to much speculation about who would succeed him.
