        "mainbody": "Chanthar Huntsilver was a member of the noble Huntsilver family in Cormyr. He was the head of his house for many years until his death in the .\nChanthar had red hair that fell out prematurely due to disease, but he managed to keep his mustache. To cover his bald pate, he always wore a hat, and the rest of his attire was typically ornate and colorful. He gained a scar on his face when he intercepted an assassins blade meant for King Pryntaler.\nChanthar was a proud man and was overly sensitive about his baldness, reacting poorly to any hair-related jokes.\nChanthar was the person who managed to wound the Hullack Hawkâ€”a brigand that plagued merchants and settlers in western Sembia and caused tensions between that land and Cormyr. He called upon Donder Cormaeril and Althallan Crownsilver to help him hunt down the Hawk and bring him to justice, but the search party never found the elusive bandit.\nAccording to renowned explorer Volothamp Geddarm, the reason Chanthars search party came up empty was because the Hullack Hawk was in reality Beldarm Truesilver, a Cormyrean noble in league with, or at least aided by, Donder and Althallan in their scheme to foment unrest in Sembia and have the blame fall upon Eltrym Drauthglas, the Lord of Hullack."
