'''The Wanderer''' was an amnesiac [[kensai]] of [[Kozakura]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
The Wanderer was at the [[Battle of Kiroshima]]. He was one of the few survivors, along with [[Doin Sanehiro]] and [[Gisen|Kuang]], but without any memory of his past, not even his name or if he fought for the samurai or for Jinchin. However, he accepted Doin as his new master and always loyally served him after their meeting.

In late 1358 the Wanderer was in [[Shou Lung]] province of [[Chu' Yuan]] searching for his missing friend [[Okotampe]]

Later The Wanderer search for Okotampe in [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]], the truth location where his friend was missing. Eventually the two met again thank to [[Osari Minhiro]] and a foreign adventuring party.

==Personality==
The Wanderer seemed not to care for his past, probably because it was a terrible one. He only wanted to start a new life. He liked moving from place to place and doing things in order to not thinking about his past. If someone of his past appeared, then the Wanderer would surely try to escape.
