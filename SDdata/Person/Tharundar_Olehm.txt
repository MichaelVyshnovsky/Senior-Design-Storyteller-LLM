Tharundar Olehm, the Holycoin Voice of the Lady, was the overlord of the Church of Waukeen in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Tharundar was a bald and aged patriarch, whose portliness prevented him from participating in the dances during worship services. His clothes were tasteful though expensive, and several rings ornamented his chubby fingers.
The Holycoin was a man of impressive bearing, wits, and piety. His acceptance of Lliiras regency was integral to the reformation of his church after Waukeens disappearance.
True to his faith, Tharundar bought into many mercantile houses and consortia. He hoped to buy a Pearl charter to establish a missionary temple in New Amn, in Maztica.
In the , the Holycoin investigated Halanna Jashires nightmares, which he believed to be divine visions containing clues to Waukeens whereabouts.
Tharundar was seconded by five Overgold sisters referred to as the Five Furies, all potential successors to his title.
* Barasta Cleeith, one of the furies, was his most trusted confidante.
* Halanna Jashire, the youngest of the furies, was his closest assistant and favored protégé.
Tharundar had several family members of note
* Vara Olehm, his niece and part of the triumvirate ruling over Esmeltaran
* Tharundar Olehm, his eponymous grandson, commander of the Hillfort of Torbold
Holycoin Olehm was disturbed by rumors concerning excessive debauchery and lasciviousness in some of the clergy in Esmeltaran and Eshpurta.
