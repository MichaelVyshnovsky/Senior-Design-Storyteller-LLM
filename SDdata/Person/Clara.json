After earning a meager living as a courtesan for some time, she learned some thieving skills and embarked upon the life that accompanied them.\nAs of early  she was imprisoned by the Flaming Fist within their headquarters in Baldurs Gate.\nShe traveled back to Athkatla later that year, and was subsequently dominated by the vampire Hexxat. The vampire compelled Clara to stay at the Copper Coronet tavern in order to find a group to aid her. Referring to herself as Hexxat, Clara sought to journey into the tomb of the being known as Dragomir the Red. She promised prospective guardians they could find great treasure within the tomb."
