'''Sevaera Datharathi''' was a member of the [[Datharathi]] chaka of [[Vaelan]] in [[Durpar]] and a [[plangent]].{{cite book/Darkvision|16}} and later by [[Pandorym]].{{cite book/Darkvision|23}}

==Description==
Half of Sevaera's face was plangent.{{cite book/Darkvision||10}} One of the [[prostheses]] she bore was on her leg.

==Personality==
Sevaera often spoke with fake concern, an habit that upset her nephew [[Warian Datharathi]],{{cite book/Darkvision||10}} whom she often made crazy impositions on.{{cite book/Darkvision||7}} She disliked being called an aunt, feeling that it made her sound old.{{cite book/Darkvision|100|10}}

[[Zeltaebar Datharathi]] noticed that his siblings, both [[Xaemar Datharathi]] and Sevaera, had often manifested a different personality after taking the plangent in their bodies.{{cite book/Darkvision||21}} Of her siblings, she was closest to Shaddon.

She liked playing the [[harp]].{{cite book/Darkvision||15}}

==History==
Sevaera played a minor role during the meeting that Warian attended in {{yearlink|1374}}, as the nominally presiding member of the meeting. However, she was actually being manipulated by her father, Shaddon, urging Warian on his behalf to have his grandfather check up on any changes on his prosthetics. She accompanied Warian in the trip, and later served as a vessel for Shaddon himself while trying to prevent Warian's escape.

Sevaera perished after [[Pandorym]] removed her head to have her better pursue Warian Datharathi.{{cite book/Darkvision||25}} Her disembodied head was later destroyed by [[Ususi Manaallin]]{{cite book/Darkvision|26}} on the evening before Pandorym was resealed.{{cite book/Darkvision|30}}
