Rafferty Tannerson was the middle-aged uncle of Dell Tannerson. Together, they regularly braved the elements traveling with caravans between Luskan and the Ten Towns in the late 1360s DR. 
Rafferty was a middle-aged human male with black hair.
Raff was a gruff man with abrupt speech patterns. He mistrusted adventurers, eyeing them suspiciously, and did not pay them more attention than curt acknowledgment.
Rafferty wore his leather armor as he worked and traveled with caravans. He was armed with a simple club.
Rafferty was a skilled carpenter, having to fix wagons oftentimes during the long treks north.
Dell and Rafferty showed affection towards each other, even though the gruff uncle hoped to keep Dells mind on his training, and not getting "all mixed up with dragons and fairies".
In 1369 DR, Raff traveled with his nephew in a caravan from Luskan to Targos, hired by Boswell Peddywinkle (secretly Celerum the Black, a member of the Arcane Brotherhood). Together with the disguised mage and his hired group of adventurers, they came across a destroyed and plundered caravan, discovered by Dell, which led to an encounter with a goblin marauder tribe.
After the group reached the Ten Towns, Dell asked the adventurers to join them on their search for the mysterious Accursed Tower, unbeknownst to his uncle.
Celerum charmed Raff at some point during the adventure, making the gruff man his unwavering ally.
