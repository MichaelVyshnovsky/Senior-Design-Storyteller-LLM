        "History": "A very unusual sapphire-blue-tinged kraken, Xisar attacked [[Es'purr]] and the [[Hills of Eralis]] multiple times, trying to enslave the eastern [[locathah]] tribes.\n\nIn [[1297 DR]], Xisar began its last terror campaign. In [[1304 DR]], the [[storm giant]] hero [[Volar]] confronted the Blue Kraken at the [[Bymmal Trench]]. Neither hero nor villain were seen since.\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], most beings considered Xisar a creature of legend.",
