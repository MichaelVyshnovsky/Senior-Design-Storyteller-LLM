'''Choren Lendoren''' was a tavern owner of the [[Dizzy Drake]] in [[Skullport]].

==History==
Around [[1370 DR]], Choren started to drink with his customers. The reason was simple: [[Nhyris D'Hothek]] had made his lair in his basement and forced Choren to assist him, by luring some of his patrons down to the [[lich]]. He obeyed out of fear.
