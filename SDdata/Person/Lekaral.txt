'''Lekaral''' was a disgraced [[spellcaster]] and a member of a cell of the [[Cult of Reborn Flame]], who lived in [[Tarmalune]] in [[1479 DR]].

==Activities==
In 1479 DR, Lekaral was conducting [[magic]]al experiments to create a [[ritual]] that could awaken the [[primordial]] [[Achazar]]. Said experiments needed the blood of descendants of the [[dragon]]-steeds of Achazar, and such individuals were supposed to be living in Tarmalune at the time.

==History==
At some point before 1479 DR, Lekaral left Tarmalune because of some disagreements with his family, in search of his own destiny. He became a member of the Cult of Reborn Flame shortly thereafter. He rose through the ranks and was eventually sent back to Tarmalune to carry out a ritual in hopes of awakening the primordial Achazar.

Lekaral was eventually killed{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stirring the Embers|44-45}} by a group of [[adventurer]]s sent by [[Halagothra|Halagothra the Healer]] to stop him.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stirring the Embers|5}}
