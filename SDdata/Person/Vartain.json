        "Description": "Vartain was bald.",
        "History": "Vartain grew up on the streets of Calimport. He later became a respected riddlemaster and language scholar. He was trained in Mulhorand tradition.\n\nIn [[1364 DR]], Vartain was hired by [[Elaith Craulnober]] to help him seek out the [[Morninglark]] harp. They were joined by [[Harper|Harpers]] [[Danilo Thann]] and company and traveled to the [[High Forest]], where Vartain was posed a conundrum by the riddle-loving dragon [[Grimnoshtadrano]]. Vartain overthought the riddle and answered incorrectly. His anguish at answering incorrectly later led him to go behind Danilo's back and pose [[Iriador Wintermist]] the same conundrum; she also failed to answer correctly.",
        "Possessions": "Vartain carried and was skilled with a [[blowpipe]] ([[dart]]s)."
