        "mainbody": "'''Durwyn''' was a young city guardsman from [[Phlan]] who was sucked into the life of adventure when he joined the [[Veiled Ones]] in their quest to stop the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1369 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''I know that I'm not the smartest guy in the world. I'm good with an [[axe]], but I'm not so good at figuring things out. So when I find people smarter than me, I trust them to do most of the thinking. You've been right about a lot of things so far, [[Kestrel]]. When you said there was a trap, I believed you.''|Durwyn}}",
        "Description": "Durwyn was a giant among his peers. {{SI|6'7|'\"|long=yes}} tall, his shoulders and limbs were bulging with muscles. His coarse blond hair was kept short to keep it out of the eyes. His wide face has squared with the jaw that sat atop a thick and muscular neck. Many noticed his kind eyes that turned into fierce orbs of determination in battle.",
        "Personality": "Big, strong, and obedient, Durwyn was a loyal man who held his friends' and family's safety as the top priority. He was always passed with promotions due to his lack of leadership skills and personality. It was something Durwyn was content with before his adventures with the Veiled Ones in Myth Drannor.\n\nDurwyn was not a quick thinker, especially in times of crisis. But if discussions about strategies and plans stretched into long tirades, Durwy was ready to suggest a quick and simple approach others tended to overlook.\n\nIt usually took a bit of time for others to appreciate Durwyn for his personality rather than for his brawn. He had a big heart, and he always tried to do the right thing even when the right thing was unclear. When his adventuring party argued or was torn by internal conflicts, Durwyn found himself torn between trying to follow each opinion that sounded convincing to him.",
        "Abilities": "A trained warrior, Durwyn was proficient with most types of arms and armor. His weapons of choice were [[battleaxe]]s, [[light crossbow]]s, and [[shortbow]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Durwyn wore the enchanted ''+3 [[chainmail]]'' gifted to him by [[Harldain lronbar]] of Myth Drannor and wielded a simple battleaxe. Durwyn also carried three [[bronze]]-tipped [[arrow]]s decorated with strange carvings.",
        "Relationships": "Durwyn held his abundant family members in high regard and was ready to do everything he could to support them and keep them safe from the dangers of the world.\n\n[[Ghleanna Stormlake]] was warm towards Durwyn, thinking him to be a gentle giant.{{Cite dragon annual/2000/Rogues Gallery: The Heroes of Myth Drannor|111}} In turn, Durwyn was impressed and smitten by the young [[half-elf]]'s arcane powers. [[Corran D'Arcey]] was an inspiration to Durwyn for the [[paladin]]'s commanding presence and military skill. Kestrel intimidated the young guardsman with her attitude and sharp tongue, but he grew to respect her mind and admire her keen senses and wits.",
        "History": "Durwyn was born on a farm just outside of Phlan, the eighth child out of eleven. The simple life of the household was filled with love, affection, and laughter. His happy childhood was punctuated by often scarcity of food and good clothes, leaving Durwyn and his siblings to wear hand-me-downs from their older kin.\n\n''Circa'' [[1364 DR]], at the age of thirteen, Durwyn followed his older brother's example and left the family farm to ease the financial strain on them. Just like his brother, he joined Phlan's city guard. Even though he was extremely young, Durwyn was eagerly accepted into the guard, thanks to the kid's size and musculature. With the guards of Phlan, he received his weapons and warrior training, especially excelling in the use of [[battleaxe]]s and [[shortbow]]s.\n\nBy 1369 DR, Durwyn's been with the guard for five years and was well-respected by his superiors for his loyalty and discipline. He was renowned for unwaveringly and unquestioningly carrying out orders and gladly taking on difficult and taxing tasks. Despite all the accolades, Durwyn was never considered for promotion as the captains fully realized that the burly young man was not a leader. Throughout his service as a guard, he sent half of his pay to his parents weekly.\n\nIn 1369 DR, the city of Phlan found its dreaded ''[[pool of radiance]]'' resurgent in the same chamber it was back when the town was under the tyranny of [[Tyranthraxus]] around thirty years prior. Durwyn was tasked with guarding the dangerous life-devouring corrupted ''pool''. Aware of legends and stories of the ''pools of radiance'' that dotted Phlan history, Durwyn eagerly took on the task, dedicated to keeping the corruption away from the citizens of the city and especially from his family."
