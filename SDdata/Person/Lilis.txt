'''Lilis''' was the consort of the Archduke [[Dispater]] of the [[Nine Hells]].<ref>

==Description==
Lilis resembled a {{SIAdj|5|ft|adj=tall}} plump [[human]] woman of middle age, her body "well-preserved". However, she numerous traits that set her apart from a human, including orange-red skin and small horns, copper-colored hair, bright green eyes, long red nails, delicate, cloven black hooves, a forked tail and wings.

==Personality==
Lilis was a careful strategist and figure of exceptional intelligence.

==Powers==
Lilis was one of the older and weaker consorts, but she still possessed an array of spell-like abilities. Her notable abilities, included the power to ''[[cause fear]]'' by pointing at a victim, cause [[insanity]] by touch once per day, and summon 1-3 [[erinyes]] with fairly high odds of success.

==Possessions==
Lilis possessed several [[gemstone]]s and a few [[potion]]s.{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|25}}

==Activities==
Lilis lived in the layer of [[Dis]], and could almost always be found in Dispater's [[Iron Tower]]. Though she was just the consort of Dispater, she also served as spymaster and diplomat. She kept her eye on events in and beyond the Hells, her network of spies said to be second only to [[Asmodeus]], and her careful maneuvering kept her position as secure as any of Baator's other nobles.

==Relationships==
Lilis was the consort of Dispater and presumably the mother of his daughter [[Malachlabra]].{{Cite dragon/360/Infernal Aristocracy: The Dukes of Hell|44}}

Lilis was also close to the archdevil [[Biffant]], Dispater's provost and manager of the Iron Tower; the two both trusted each other (as much as devils did) and showed unfailing loyal to their lord Dispater, granting him enviable control over his layer.
