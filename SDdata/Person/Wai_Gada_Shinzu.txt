'''Wai Gada Shinzu''' was the emperor of [[T'u Lung]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Wai Gada Shinzu ascended to become the Eighth Emperor of the [[Lui Dynasty]] in [[1308 DR]] and soon after his cousin and regent [[Wai Yeh Yin]] disappeared. Wai Gada opened diplomatic relations with [[Shou Lung]], defining the border between the two and halting large-scale military incursions.

In 1357 DR, Wai Gada Shinzu argued with his brother [[Wai Gada Mo]], governor of [[To'an District]], and soon after Wai Gada Mo was summoned by the Emperor in [[Wai]], arrested, and put in [[Dakarazu Palace]]'s dungeon.

==Activities==
Wai Gada Shinzu, was always protected by his bodyguard army known as the [[Silent Tigers]], led by the mercenary [[Ye'ahn Joshu]], believed by many to be a [[ninja]]. He usually lived in Dakarazu Palace in [[Wai]] and saw people from the outside only one day a week when he received court to review and judge civil disturbances and captured criminals.

==Personality==
Wai Gada liked to collect caged birds; he put one in almost every room of the palace. When he had too many, Wai Gada released some that he did not like any more while his companion Ye'ahn practiced his archery skills on them.

Wai Gada was known to be cruel and bloodthirsty. Rumors said that he collected the skulls of his enemies and from these constructed a mock throne, and here he forced new victims to sit before he had them beheaded.
