        "mainbody": "'''Glinda Scatterstar''' was the master of the [[Mage's Guild]] of [[Hillsfar]] and secretly an active rebel against Lord [[Maalthiir]] in [[1367 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Glinda saw Maalthiir as a ruining influence in her city and she changed the objective of the Guild to actively remove him from power.",
        "Activities": "In order to advance her plan, although very slowly, Glinda tried to expand the Mage's Guild as much as possible, by not only training new [[wizard]]s but also molding the minds of their pupils against Maalthiir. She also secretly smuggled into the city a number of [[elves]] and [[half-elves]] to reinforce her guild. Glinda waited for the inevitable defeat of the [[Red Plumes]] by the [[Zhentarim]] before she would act.",
        "History": "Around [[1372 DR]] Glinda disappeared and her position was taken by her \"sister\" [[Girella Scatterstar]] (in truth a [[doppelganger]])."
