'''Kisha Yunoko''' was the concubine of the emperor of [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR|Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR)]].

==History==
Yunoko was the adopted daughter of [[daimyo]] [[Matasuuri Ieysuna]] and granddaughter of the [[Matasuuri Nagahide|shogun]]. She was trained as [[geisha]] starting from when she took her first step.
In [[1354 DR|Wa Year 1772 (1354 DR)]], Yunoko was invited by the shogun to the [[Imperial Palace]], and, as the shogun had planned, the emperor quickly fell for her. Yunoko became one of the emperor's geisha and later his concubine. She was ordered to report the emperor's words to the shogun.

Secretly, Yunoko started a relationship with [[Tekinjo Yojairo]], the military governor in residence at the palace.

==Personality==
Yunoko was a delicate and gentle girl. She wanted to leave the emperor but feared the ire of her grandfather. At first she enjoyed the luxury of life in the Imperial Palace, but over time felt guilty about betraying the emperor's trust. She greatly feared the discovery of her love affair with Yojairo and for his life. She was desperate to find any way to escape from her situation.
