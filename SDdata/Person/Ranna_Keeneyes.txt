Countess-Consort Ranna Keeneyes was the wife of Count Oxsal Keeneyes of Monteshi, Tethyr. She was a tiny halfling lady with great practical sense.
As her husband spent most of his time in defense of Tethyr at Fort Teqlar, she was given his responsibilities of guild chancellorship. In this role, she traveled around the country, often in disguise as a merchant, in the protection of her five children. She ensured that the guilds did not abuse their political status to unfairly affect trade. She had the legal authority from the queen to put such offenders on trial.
