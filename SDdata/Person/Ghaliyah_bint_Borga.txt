'''Ghaliyah bint Borga''', also known as '''Gala of the Marketplace''', was a [[dwarf]] and the Chief Wadi of [[Gana]] in the [[Pearl Cities]] region of [[west Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}} 

==Activities==
Ghaliyah had held her position for three years as of 1367 DR. Like all [[hakima]], she could always see the truth of a matter though sometimes choose to keep it hidden. This behavior arose from Sultan [[Yusef al-Wadi]]'s history of blaming any scandals of note, regardless of the truth, on the current Chief Wadi and then banishing them.
