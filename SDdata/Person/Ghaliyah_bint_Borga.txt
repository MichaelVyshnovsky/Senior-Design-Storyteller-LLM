Ghaliyah bint Borga, also known as Gala of the Marketplace, was a dwarf and the Chief Wadi of Gana in the Pearl Cities region of west Zakhara in 1367 DR. 
Ghaliyah had held her position for three years as of 1367 DR. Like all hakima, she could always see the truth of a matter though sometimes choose to keep it hidden. This behavior arose from Sultan Yusef al-Wadis history of blaming any scandals of note, regardless of the truth, on the current Chief Wadi and then banishing them.
