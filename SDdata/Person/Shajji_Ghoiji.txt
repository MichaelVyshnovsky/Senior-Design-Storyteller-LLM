'''Shajji Ghoiji''' was the leader, or ''qaghan'', of the [[Tsu-tsu]] tribe and the city of [[Jugicha]] on the [[Plain of Horses]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Ghoiji's brother, [[Shajji Hoijarek]], abandoned his life as a [[lama]] to serve under his brother as ''apa qaghan''. However, Ghoiji's government was corrupt and fell into chaos and finally rebellion ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2587|SY}}. Hoijarek stepped in, gathering capable advisors to his side and ascending as the new ''qaghan''.
