Pesh was a Bedine nomad who traveled across the deserts of Anauroch during the late 15 century DR.
Pesh believed that the adventurous life was the best well-lived. He was eager to learn more about the greater world and was always welcoming to any adventurers he encountered.
He was a kind and trusting individual, if not a little naive and reckless. Despite his naivete, Pesh was quite knowledgeable about how to survive in the harsh desert climate.
His best friend was his grandfather Shamir, a more practical and discerning individual. Together they had a trusty camel named Old Stink.
Some time during the , Pesh and Shamir found the inert Sapphire Sentinel, an ancient stone golem half-buried in the sands of the desert. Shortly after its discovery, a group of wandering adventurers came across the boy and his grandfather. The Sapphire Sentinel "awoke" while in the groups presence, awing Pesh and sparking his yearn for adventure.
