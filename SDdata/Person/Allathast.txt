Allathast was a male human fighter and the commander of the guards of the city of Daerlun in 1369 DR. He was secretly a thrall of the Cult of the Dragon, controlled by magic and Cultist friends.
Although the ruler of Daerlun was the elderly merchant Halath Tymmyr, Allathast had the true power by influencing Tymmyr. With backing from the Cult of the Dragon, Allathast controlled the city.
The Cult leaders used Daerlun very cautiously, not openly showing their power, but using it as a secret sanctuary for the Cults holdings and members.
