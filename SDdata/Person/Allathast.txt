'''Allathast''' was a male [[human]] [[fighter]] and the commander of the guards of the city of [[Daerlun]] in [[1369 DR]]. He was secretly a thrall of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], controlled by [[magic]] and Cultist friends.

==History==
Although the ruler of Daerlun was the elderly merchant [[Halath Tymmyr]], Allathast had the true power by influencing Tymmyr. With backing from the Cult of the Dragon, Allathast controlled the city.

The Cult leaders used Daerlun very cautiously, not openly showing their power, but using it as a secret sanctuary for the Cult's holdings and members.
