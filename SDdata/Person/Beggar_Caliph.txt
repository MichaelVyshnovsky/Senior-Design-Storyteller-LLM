The Beggar Caliph was a mysterious beggar inhabiting Hiyal around 1367 DR.
Though none knew for certain the sex or race of this individual, many believed him to be a human male. Others believed he was a genie or perhaps a disgruntled prince in hiding.
The Beggar Caliph was rumored to be the master of all beggars within Hiyal. They were said to report to him on a daily basis and divulge any information gathered throughout their day. He would then provide orders or information about important upcoming events.
