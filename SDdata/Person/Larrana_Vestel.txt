'''Larrana Vestel''' was a [[human]] explorer and guide who operated throughout [[Gontal]], mainly in the [[Glaur Barrens]].{{Cite dragon/366/Gontal|51}}

==Activities==
As of [[1479 DR]], Larrana was renowned in Gontal for her skills as an adventuress and for being brave enough to explore the Glaur Barrens. She charged rather high fees to her customers, but her skill with the bow and her knowledge of Gontal's lands and dangers were worth the coin.{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|77}}
