        "mainbody": "A Griffon Cavalry rider was a member of the Griffon Cavalry branch of the City Guard of Waterdeep.\nGriffon Cavalry riders mainly patrolled the skies above Waterdeep while also watching out for unusual activity on the ground. They also pursued and confronted any unlicensed fliers in the citys skies.\nGriffon Cavalry riders and their mounts were stationed atop Peaktop Aerie, where civilians were not welcome. It was also there that griffons were trained as mounts. A moderate knowledge of animal handling was usually required to mount and ride a griffon.\nBy the late 15 century DR, Griffon Cavalry riders were generally equipped with a lance, dagger, light crossbow, half plate armor, and a unique consumable magic ring, which allowed the wearer to cast feather fall once if knocked from the mount mid-flight, becoming non-magical afterwards."
