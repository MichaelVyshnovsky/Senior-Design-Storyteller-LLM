        "mainbody": "ianga, along with his esteemed colleague Beb-Shuur, was a member of the short-lived Order of Theorosophers, active in the late 14 century DR.\nXianga was a rotund man, bloated with feeling of self-importance common among philosophers of the Realms. However, his eyes showed not a slightest spark of intelligence.\nBeb-Shuur and Xianga both followed the teachings of the doctrine of Theorosophy formulated by Master Vugu of Cormyr. Unlike Philosophy, Theorosophy was not based on logic and empiricism, instead relied on deductive reasoning and intuition. In the , both Master Theorosophers, Beb-Shuur, and Xianga, pondered the world and their role in the Order of Theorosophers atop the Blade Cliffs, to the southwest of the town of Daggerford. Atop the cliff, Xianga came to a conclusion that seagulls floated on the sea breeze suspended by invisible tethers and that the birds belief into their ability to fly was the only thing that kept them soaring in the skies.\nBeb-Shuur and Xianga argued over who would become the Master Theorosopher of the Order of Theorosophers following master Vugus demise. His death came when he lept off a cliff believing that his physical body served as an anchor that kept the human spirit from flying. Vugu thought that the experiment served to prove that intuition was superior to empiricism, and as the next Master Theorosopher, both Beb-Shuur and Xianga wanted to follow their masters suit.\nIn reality, Vugu of Cormyr committed suicide, being swallowed by despair, seeing what idiocy his doctrine of Theorosophy was reduced to. His true thoughts and feelings were written in a journal washed ashore not far where his body plummeted atop the jagged rocks. When shown the journal, Beb-Shuur denied its authenticity based on a gut feeling as dictated by Theorosophy. Subsequently, both sages convinced each other that the only way to decide who was worthy of the title and leadership role was to follow Vugus example. Both dimwitted men died after jumping off a cliff."
