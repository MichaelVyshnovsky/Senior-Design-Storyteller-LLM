        "mainbody": "Hobnap Baker was a member of prominent hin Baker chaka of Durpar and the leader of the only Thieves Guild of the Shining Lands in the late 14 century DR.\nDespite his profession, Hobnap Baker lacked the greed that was so often prevalent among members of the thieves guilds. He did, however, appreciate the challenge of the profession. Hobnap established honorable laws within the guild, demanding that the poor never be touched by their fellow thieves. Even though not every member was willing to comply.\nHe was a wealthy hin who was always armed with his enchanted +2 dagger.\nHobnap created his guild on a dare. Everyone said a thieves guild could not exist in the Shining Lands, and the halfling loved a good challenge. During his career, Hobnap pulled a multitude of high-profile heists that garnered him more notoriety than he was comfortable with. At one point in the  Hobnap pulled one of the most notorious stunts â€“ he snuck into a Council of Merchants meeting in Heldapan and acquired some invaluable intel, later sold to the highest bidder. The information leak became public, and the Council placed a heft reward on the perpetrators head. If Hobnap Baker were ever discovered, his entire fortune and everything hes ever owned would be confiscated by the Durpari government. Being rich, the halfling, and no interest in being discovered and captured. If the existence of the gild were ever to be uncovered, the Durpari were to surely turn over every stone in an attempt to squash the organization. If that were to pass, Hobnap Baker would be long gone back in Luiren."
