        "mainbody": "Spendelarde was a wizard and spell developer.\nHe was noted as the inventor of several utilitarian spells, including the necromancy spell Spendelardes chaser.\nHe once owned the magical staff Spendelardes Protector, which he carried with him when traveling.\nSpendelarde studied magic under Mentor Wintercloak, one of the Seven Wizards of Myth Drannor.It is unclear when Spendelardes studies under Mentor occurred. It could have been as early as the founding of the Seven Wizards in 379 DR (Cormanthyr Empire of the Elves, p. 39). Although Mentor Wintercloak left the Seven Wizards in 682 DR (The Fall of Myth Drannor, p. 18), he taught several students later in life, and Spendelarde could be among these.\nAlthough Spendelarde did not travel often, he occasionally went on long and dangerous treks to distant locales."
