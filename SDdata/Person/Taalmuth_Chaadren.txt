'''Taalmuth Chaadren''' was a human ranger from [[Amphail]], and the father of [[Tsarra Chaadren]].

==Relationships==
Taalmuth married [[Malruthiia Chaadren|Malruthiia]], who was an exiled bastard child of the [[Ilbaereth]] house of [[elf|elves]]. Their child was Tsarra Chaadren.

==History==
Taalmuth was born in Amphail, but as a ranger he traveled all over the [[Sword Coast]] and [[Tethyr]], but eventually settled down in [[Waterdeep]] where he met his wife, Malruthiia, a rival hunter. They married in [[1337 DR]].

The couple became guides for hunting trips and parties around Waterdeep, and Taalmuth was under contract to [[Piergeiron Paladinson]], the [[Field of Triumph]], and other noble houses.

While on a hunt in the [[Ardeep Forest]] in [[1357 DR]], Taalmuth became involved in a spell battle against a suspected [[lich]] (the true identity of the assailant was not known) and was killed. His entire body was burned by a ''[[fireball]]'' spell, and there were charred areas on nearby trees, destroyed [[skeleton]]s, a pile of stones from an arcane ritual, and a scrap of maroon cloth, which all pointed to a lich as the culprit.

Taalmuth was buried in an unmarked grave in his favored [[Pellamcopse Woods]] near to Waterdeep.
