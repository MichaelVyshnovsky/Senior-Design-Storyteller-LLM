Taalmuth Chaadren was a human ranger from Amphail, and the father of Tsarra Chaadren.
Taalmuth married Malruthiia, who was an exiled bastard child of the Ilbaereth house of elves. Their child was Tsarra Chaadren.
Taalmuth was born in Amphail, but as a ranger he traveled all over the Sword Coast and Tethyr, but eventually settled down in Waterdeep where he met his wife, Malruthiia, a rival hunter. They married in 1337 DR.
The couple became guides for hunting trips and parties around Waterdeep, and Taalmuth was under contract to Piergeiron Paladinson, the Field of Triumph, and other noble houses.
While on a hunt in the Ardeep Forest in 1357 DR, Taalmuth became involved in a spell battle against a suspected lich (the true identity of the assailant was not known) and was killed. His entire body was burned by a fireball spell, and there were charred areas on nearby trees, destroyed skeletons, a pile of stones from an arcane ritual, and a scrap of maroon cloth, which all pointed to a lich as the culprit.
Taalmuth was buried in an unmarked grave in his favored Pellamcopse Woods near to Waterdeep.
