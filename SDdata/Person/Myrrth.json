        "mainbody": "Myrrth was a famous Waterdhavian jester and member of the noble family Anteos in the 13 century DR. In death, he sought the help of the heroes of Selûnes Smile to investigate the defilement of his grave.\nAs a skeletal colossus, Myrrths body had a resistance to magic, a withering gaze, as well as the ability to breathe fire and ice.\nAt some point in his career, during a performance in front of an audience of a guildmaster of Waterdeeps Musicians Guild and his party, Myrrth used a joke written by a young jester as part of his set. Unbeknownst to him, this joke turned out to be a spell that instantly slew the jesters entire audience. The incident made Myrrth infamous, and despite the fact that he had no real hand in it, he would go on to take full credit for the act.\nMyrrth died from indigestion somewhere around the , after partaking in a grand feast.\nAbout a century after his passing, in the , a plot was hatched by the Musicians Guild to divine Myrrths \"killing joke\" from his remains, in order to take control of all of Waterdeep. To this end, they set up the upstart breakaway Jesters Guild to rob his grave through the use of a mole, Doofut, disturbing his spirit and causing it to manifest in the Prime Material plane.\nIn incorporeal form, Myrrth visited Selûnes Smile, seeking out adventurers to prevent his remains from being disturbed. This task was accepted by the adventurers Vajra Valmeyjar, Kyriani Agrivar, and Onyx the Invincible, with the promised reward of a valuable scroll containing the jesters original material. However, the party was beaten to the Anteos familys tomb by the Jesters Guild, who had taken Myrrths remains to their headquarters, without the knowledge of the Musicians Guild.\nAfter securing Myrrths skeleton, the Jesters Guilds magic-users, using a series of spells in the forms of joke set-ups, turned it into a skeletal colossus, which they let loose to attack Castle Waterdeep. The guild quickly lost control over it, and Bazzle, their leader, was killed by its flame breath. After several attacks proved ineffective, the magic-users of the Jesters Guild used a series of specialized counterspells in the forms of punchlines to turn the colossus back into a normal skeleton, with Kyriani standing in for Bazzle. In the process, Myrrths skull came loose and was caught by Onyx just before it shattered on the ground, only for it to promptly be stolen away by a member of the Musicians Guild.\nAt their headquarters, the Musicians Guild hired a cleric of Milil to use speak with dead on Myrrths skull to ascertain the specifics of the jesters notorious joke. The skulls demeanor stalled their progress for long enough for the heroes of Selûnes Smile to track the guild down and intervene. In the chaos of the confrontation between the heroes and the guild, the skull ended up being passed to Doofut, who was unable to shield it from Kyrianis magic missiles.\nWith his skull destroyed, Myrrth was able to return to the afterlife once again, going on a tour of the Outer Planes starting with a gig in Ysgard. Before departing, he gave his promised reward of the valuable scroll of jokes to Onyx."
