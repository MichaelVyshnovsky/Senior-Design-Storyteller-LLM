        "mainbody": "'''Myrrth''' was a famous [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] jester and member of the noble family [[Anteos]] in the 13{{th}} century DR. In death, he sought the help of the [[heroes of Selûne's Smile]] to investigate the defilement of his grave.",
        "Abilities": "As a skeletal colossus, Myrrth's body had a resistance to magic, a withering gaze, as well as the ability to breathe fire and ice.{{Cite comic/Showtime! or Revenge of the Living Monologue}}",
        "History": "At some point in his career, during a performance in front of an audience of a guildmaster of Waterdeep's [[Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers|Musicians' Guild]] and his party, Myrrth used a joke written by a young jester as part of his set. Unbeknownst to him, this joke turned out to be a spell that instantly slew the jester's entire audience. The incident made Myrrth infamous, and despite the fact that he had no real hand in it, he would go on to take full credit for the act.{{Cite comic/Showtime! or Revenge of the Living Monologue|24}}{{Cite comic/Die Laughing|1-3}}\n\nMyrrth died from indigestion somewhere around the {{YearlinkName|1257}}, after partaking in a grand feast.{{Cite comic/The Spirit of Myrrth|4}}\n\nAbout a century after his passing, in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, a plot was hatched by the Musicians' Guild to divine Myrrth's \"killing joke\" from his remains, in order to take control of all of Waterdeep. To this end, they set up the upstart breakaway [[Ancient and Revered Order of Merrymakers|Jester's Guild]] to rob his grave through the use of a mole, [[Doofut]], disturbing his spirit and causing it to manifest in the [[Prime Material plane]].{{Cite comic/Die Laughing}}\n\nIn incorporeal form, Myrrth visited [[Selûne's Smile]], seeking out adventurers to prevent his remains from being disturbed. This task was accepted by the adventurers [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Kyriani Agrivar]], and [[Onyx the Invincible]], with the promised reward of a valuable scroll containing the jester's original material. However, the party was beaten to the Anteos family's tomb by the Jester's Guild, who had taken Myrrth's remains to their headquarters, without the knowledge of the Musicians' Guild.{{Cite comic/The Spirit of Myrrth|2}}{{Cite comic/The Spirit of Myrrth|6}}{{Cite comic/The Spirit of Myrrth|14-15}}{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|23-24}}\n\nAfter securing Myrrth's skeleton, the Jester's Guild's [[magic-user]]s, using a series of spells in the forms of joke set-ups, turned it into a skeletal colossus, which they let loose to attack [[Castle Waterdeep]]. The guild quickly lost control over it, and [[Bazzle]], their leader, was killed by its flame breath. After several attacks proved ineffective, the magic-users of the Jester's Guild used a series of specialized ''[[counterspell]]s'' in the forms of punchlines to turn the colossus back into a normal skeleton, with Kyriani standing in for Bazzle. In the process, Myrrth's skull came loose and was caught by Onyx just before it shattered on the ground, only for it to promptly be stolen away by a member of the Musicians' Guild.\n\nAt their headquarters, the Musicians' Guild hired a cleric of [[Milil]] to use ''[[speak with dead]]'' on Myrrth's skull to ascertain the specifics of the jester's notorious joke. The skull's demeanor stalled their progress for long enough for the heroes of Selûne's Smile to track the guild down and intervene. In the chaos of the confrontation between the heroes and the guild, the skull ended up being passed to Doofut, who was unable to shield it from Kyriani's ''[[magic missile]]s''.\n\nWith his skull destroyed, Myrrth was able to return to the [[afterlife]] once again, going on a tour of the [[Outer Planes]] starting with a gig in [[Ysgard]]. Before departing, he gave his promised reward of the valuable scroll of jokes to Onyx.{{Cite comic/Die Laughing|22-23}}"
