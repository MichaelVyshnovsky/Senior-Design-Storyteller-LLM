'''Etherik''' was an [[elf]] [[wizard]] focused on destroying all [[drow]] around [[1479 DR]].

==History==
Around [[1439 DR]], a drow raiding party assaulted the village of [[Silvershore]] in the [[Valley of Khedrun]], killing all the inhabitants. Only the young Etherik survived. He decided to dedicate his life to totally destroying the drow.

In time, Etherik became a talented wizard and around 1479 DR he had built a new kind of [[construct]], the [[drowslayer]], which he planned to mass-produce and unleash into [[Menzoberranzan]]. News of it reached the various drow houses of Menzoberranzan and they decided to cooperate for once and sent an assassin squad from various houses to destroy the construct and kill the wizard. However, Etherik had foreseen this scenario and wanted to use the assassin squad as test subjects in order to better impress his guests into financing his project.

==Personality==
Etherik hated the drow with true passion; his only objective was to kill every drow of the [[Underdark]].
