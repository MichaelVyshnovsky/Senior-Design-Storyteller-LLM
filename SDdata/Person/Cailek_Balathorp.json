        "mainbody": "Cailek Balathorp was a noble of Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the late 15 century DR. He made his living by capturing surface dwellers and delivering them to the drow who lived in the Underdark beneath the city.  He went by the nickname Fetterfist while operating as a slaver.\nBalathorp was tall and lanky with blond hair. In the guise of Fetterfist, he wore a leather half hood that obscured most of his face.\nIn the , Fetterfists gang attacked a caravan near Ravens Bluff and delivered their captives to the drow beneath the city.  A young noblewoman named Seila Norwood was among the slaves.\nLater, Balathorp was hired by the drow to return Jack Ravenwild to imprisonment in their underground realm. Jack tricked Balathorp into an ambush at a warehouse and captured him with the help of the Blue Wyverns. Thinking the city watch would imprison Balathorp, Jack tied him up in the warehouse and left a note describing Balathorps crimes. Unfortunately, the city magistrates didnt believe a noble of Balathorps stature could be a slaver so they set him free.\nShortly thereafter, Balathorps gang, along with drow warriors, attacked a noble revel with the intent of killing most of the nobles present and enslaving the remainder. Lord Norwood and Myrkyssa Jelan led an armed force into the Underdark to rescue the captives. Balathorp attempted to escape to the surface with his prisoners but he was run through by Jack Ravenwilds blade."
