He went by the nickname '''Fetterfist''' while operating as a [[slave|slaver]].{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle||2}}",
        "Description": "Balathorp was tall and lanky with blond hair.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|3643|11}} In the guise of Fetterfist, he wore a leather half hood that obscured most of his face.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle||7}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Fetterfist's gang attacked a caravan near Ravens Bluff and delivered their captives to the drow beneath the city.  A young noblewoman named [[Seila Norwood]] was among the slaves.\n\nLater, Balathorp was hired by the drow to return [[Jack Ravenwild]] to imprisonment in their underground realm. Jack tricked Balathorp into an ambush at a warehouse and captured him with the help of the [[Blue Wyverns]]. Thinking the city watch would imprison Balathorp, Jack tied him up in the warehouse and left a note describing Balathorp's crimes. Unfortunately, the city magistrates didn't believe a noble of Balathorp's stature could be a slaver so they set him free.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4986|11}}\n\nShortly thereafter, Balathorp's gang, along with drow warriors, attacked a noble revel with the intent of killing most of the nobles present and enslaving the remainder.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4263|12}} [[Marden Norwood|Lord Norwood]] and [[Myrkyssa Jelan]] led an armed force into the Underdark to rescue the captives. Balathorp attempted to escape to the surface with his prisoners but he was run through by Jack Ravenwild's blade.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4720|13}}"
