'''Mal'a'voselle Amvas Tol''' was a [[drow]] of [[House Amvas Tol]] who was turned into an enormous [[drider]] called '''Malfoosh'''. She was in the service of [[Zhindia Melarn]] in the early 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During the foundation of [[Menzoberranzan]], Mal'a'voselle was weapon master to Matron [[Dunna'da Amvas]]. However, Dunna'da proved to be a heretic and her house was destroyed and Matron [[Yvonnel Baenre]] turned Mal'a'voselle into a drider. Afterward, she served [[Lolth]] in the [[Abyss]].

In [[1488 DR]], after a [[retriever]] had presumably killed [[Drizzt]] and a demon army advanced through [[Gauntlgrym]] and [[Margaster]] allies had conquered [[Luskan]] and [[Port Llast]], the [[yochlol]]s [[Eskavidne]] and [[Yiccardaria]] granted to Zhindia the command of an army of risen driders. Among them, Malfoosh was granted leadership and even the living driders of [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]] submitted to her sheer power. She reported to Matron Zhindia the progress of their armies.

Malfoosh led the drider army near Gauntlgrym when they met a [[drow]] scouting party. After [[Malagdorl Armgo]] nearly tried to attack her, [[Minolin Fey]] asked to speak with her and discovered the story of Mal'a'voselle Amvas Tol.

During the final battle between Zhindia and the army of Menzoberranzan, the spells of [[Quenthel Baenre]] and [[Yvonnel Baenre II]] managed to turn the driders back into drow again, in a miraculous event. Malfoosh became Mal'a'voselle Amvas Tol once more.

She remained the leader of the former driders in their march back to Menzoberranzan together with the drow army.

In the {{YearlinkName|1490}}, she led the [[Blaspheme]], her legion of former driders, in skirmishes against forces loyal to Lolth. Twice she fought against Malagdorl Armgo. The first time she was saved by Dinin Do'Urden. The second time, however, it was Malagdorl who killed her in single combat by tearing out her throat with his teeth. Malagdorl considered ending her, but then left her on the ground for a slow death.<ref>
