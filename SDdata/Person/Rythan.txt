'''Crown Prince Rythan''' of [[Tethyr]] was next in line to the throne of Tethyr. He destroyed the lich [[Jhaniloth Puiral]] of the [[Twisted Rune]] while she was in her lair. In retribution for this act, the Rune created [[Mulsparkh]], and Rythan was killed in the [[Battle of Nightflames]] against its armies in [[1334 DR]].{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|67}}
