The '''Dragon of the Deeps''' was an enormous [[dragon turtle]] that lived within the depths of the [[Deepwash]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The famous dragon turtle laired within an underwater cavern system deep beneath the seabed of the Deepwash. The tunnels extended underneath the [[Spines of Surkh]] mountain range.

==Relationships==
The Dragon of the Deeps was greatly revered by the residents of the coastal city of [[Surkh]]. The Dragon in turn showed no acknowledgement of their existence.

They believed that being devoured by the Dragon was among the most honorable ways someone could die. Their beliefs however were not so intense that they actively sought out becoming one of its meals.
