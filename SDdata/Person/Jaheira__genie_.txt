'''Jaheira''' was a tasked [[artist genie]] serving the [[House of Al-Kamari]] in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Jaheira dressed herself in the latest fashions of Huzuz, usually before they become popular with others.

==Personality==
Like most artist genies, Jaheira was very sensitive about her work. Any criticism was enough to keep her from working for at least a week.

==Activities==
Jaherira performed all of the finest weaving done by the House of Al-Kamari. Since Al-Kamari were aware that happy artist genies produced greater works of art, anything she required for her creations was acquired without question.
