==Description==
Neris was an older woman with brown skin and long white hair.

==Relationships==
Neris was the mother of [[Ricnan Midler|Ricnan]] and [[Quilynn Midler|Quilynn]], and partner of [[Ianhand Midler|Ianhand]].

==History==
During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], the [[drow]] forces of [[Vicala Szind]] attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the [[Thread of the Weave]]. Unknown to the drow, the household cook [[Maisby]] had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of [[Purple Dragons]] and then a team of [[adventurer]]s to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.

Neris and her husband Ianhand were bound up in one of the upstairs bedrooms, guarded by drow warriors until their fate was determined.
