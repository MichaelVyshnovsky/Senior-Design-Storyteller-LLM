'''Petrine''' was an [[elven]] girl that lived in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] with her uncle for a time during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Although the exact circumstances were unknown, Petrine's parents were no longer in her life and she lived with her uncle [[Bheren]], who she found to be quite mean.

Petrine had a [[cat]] named [[Angel (cat)|Angel]] that she believed watched over and protected her from harm.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Petrine ran away from her uncle's home but lost Angel in the process. The cat had returned to their previous home in the [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] to retrieve its favorite trinket, an [[angel skin ring]].
