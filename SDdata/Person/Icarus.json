On top of his command of the ''Arrow of Justice'', he also commanded an elven [[Spelljammer|spelljamming]] fleet consisting of the following vessels:\n* 7 [[Armada (spelljammer)|armadas]];\n* 1 [[monarch armada]];\n* 50 [[flitter]]s;\n* 12 [[Man-o-war|men-o-war]];\n* 1 [[radiant ship]];\n* 5 [[eel ship]]s.",
        "History": "In the early days of the [[War of the Spheres]], Icarus's armada had intercepted several [[vodoni]] attacks, but always too late to be of any help. In one such attempt, the ship intercepted a group of adventurers with valuable information on the vodoni. The ''Arrow of Justice'' promptly escorted them to the [[Rock of Bral]] to participate in the first meeting of the [[Free Space Alliance]] in order to assess the threat of a vodoni invasion.\n\nThe ''Arrow of Justice'' also served as the Alliance flagship throughout the war and in the final battle against the Vodoni."
