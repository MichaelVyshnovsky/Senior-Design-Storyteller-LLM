Tamara was a clerk who served "special" clients of Felogyrs Fireworks shop in Baldurs Gate in late 15 century DR.
Tamara was an ashy-skinned Lolthite drow with snow-white hair and a stern orderly personality. She was armed with a dagger and wore white robes.
In the , as the Cult of the Absolute planted its roots in Baldurs Gate and ravaged the Western Heartlands, Felogyrs Fireworks shop fell under the cults sway. Its proprietor, Avery Sonshal, was made into a True Soul and used the shop as a front for the cults terrorist activities. During that time, Tamara was employed as the shops clerk that serviced "friends of Felogyr," selling them the shops more dangerous weaponized stock, like bombs and smokepowder arrows. She operated from the shops second floor, which was only accessible to customers who knew a code phrase, and warned anyone from proceeding to the shops third floor, which was off-limits to all but the Banite members of the Cult of the Absolute.
During that time, on orders from Avery Sonshal, Tamara supplied a toymaker member of the cult with explosives. In turn, the toymaker planned to ship the deadly explosive toys to the refugees that flooded Rivington. However, Avery also ordered Tamara to turn the toymaker down were he to come for more explosives â€“ the proprietor wanted to keep Felogyrs Fireworks name clean.
