The quality of his stock ranged from poor to excellent, but the vast majority of them were stolen. He catered to questionable clientele.\n\nMany of his clients rode out from Huzuz only to encounter a group of [[desert rider]]s who were eager to retrieve their property. These customers typically did not survive long enough to return to Huzuz and complain to Nabil."
