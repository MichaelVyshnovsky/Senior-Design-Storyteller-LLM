        "mainbody": "'''Apimu''', whose name translated as \"un-peaceful belly,\" was a skinworker of the reformed cannibal [[Kukalatu]] tribe of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''I can't believe the Council would do such a thing. It will be the end of us all! '''*sigh*''' If they had only talked to me first! But, nooo, Apimu is just a garuda skin worker, he doesn't need to be consulted on such matters ...'''*sigh*'''...''|Apimu}}",
        "Description": "Apimu was a [[Nubari]] male who was known for his \"we are doomed\" attitude and mistrust of the outsiders. He was unhappy with the [[Council of the Almost Ancestors]], never asking for his opinion but too afraid of the [[Eldest One]] to speak up against their judgment.",
        "History": "By The Year of New Peoples of the Malatran calendar, Apimu was a skilled skinworker who used [[garudaskin]] to craft quality [[sandals]], [[belt]]s, [[harness]]es, and other similar items. Like leatherworkers of [[Faer√ªn]], skinworkers of the Malatran Plateau did not use chemical processes to treat [[garuda]] skin, turning it into leather. Unlike many of his tribesmen, Apimu was afraid for the youth of the tribe who ventured to trade and interact with other tried of the Living Jungles. He was sure the neighboring communities still held a grudge against the Kukalaturi's cannibalistic past. Then a group of heroes of the Living Jungle arrived at the Kukalatu Village, seeking a special medicinal ointment, Apimu offered the outsiders to trade. ''[[Apimu's garudaskin sandals]]'' and ''Apimu's garuda-foot [[arrow]] [[quiver]]'' were main masterfully items of note."
