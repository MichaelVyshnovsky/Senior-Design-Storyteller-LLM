Tierak Morcane was a female drow priestess of Lolth and perhaps the sole surviving priestess from House Morcane after the Silence of Lolth.
Ever-scowling, Tierak Morcane was nevertheless a striking female and like many priestesses of Lolth, she had an almost palpable aura of authority about her.
Tierak typically wore a shirt of fine mithral chain and a spider-shaped dagger at her belt.
At the time of the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR, Tierak was one of the many priestesses from House Morcane but she fled Szith Morcane when Kiaransaleean cultists overthrew the rulers of the settlement on Marpenoth 12th. After the fall of her House, Tierak found her way into the Dordrien crypts above Szith Morcane, along with a pair of skilled bodyguards and a Spellguard that were still loyal to her. Here they planned their reprisal against the followers of the White Banshee.
