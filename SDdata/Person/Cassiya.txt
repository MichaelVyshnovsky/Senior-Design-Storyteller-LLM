Cassiya was a prostitute in the employ of Senator Nyla of Innarlith on the Lake of Steam in the mid-1360s DR. She blew herself up in an attempt to assassinate Ivar Devorast in 1366 DR.
Nyla was a female senator in Innarlith who ran a prostitution business in the city. Secretly, she was also a Zhentarim agent. The Zhentarim were one of the parties opposed to the construction of a canal that would have connected the Lake of Steam to the Sea of Fallen Stars by way of the Nagaflow and Nyla was required to find a way to stop the canal construction, which was being headed by Ivar Devorast.
Cassiya attended finishing school with Phyrea, daughter of Senator Inthelph, when the two were younger. Cassiyas father was a senator, but he lost his seat on the senate and then killed himself after his debts were called in. The family then moved out of the wealthier second quarter of Innarlith and Phyrea then lost track of her. At some point later she became a prostitute in the employ of Senator Nyla.
On Marpenoth 8. 1366 DR, she went to the canal site north of the city and ignited the powderkegs of smokepowder that were being used for excavating the trench. Her target was to kill Ivar Devorast, however, she ended up only killing herself in the fumbled attempt.
