        "mainbody": "Temmenische was a monk and a member of the Disciples of St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose in the 13th and 14th centuries DR.\nTemmenische was born circa 1264 DR.\nIn the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR, Grand Master Poke died suddenly. This necessitated that Kane, a Master of Spring and next-in-line for the position of Grand Master, hurry back to the monastery and manage affairs until a new Grand Master could be trained and selected. However, Kane had no wish to remain in the position. Temmenische was the next most senior monk, but at 95 years of age, he was hardly a practical choice.\nThus Kane and Temmenische chose Cantoule, who was much younger and more suitable, to succeed Poke as Grand Master. They put Cantoule through accelerated training in advanced techniques to ready him for the post."
