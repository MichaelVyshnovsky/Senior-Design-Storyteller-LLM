'''Taerom "Thunderhammer" Fuiruim''' is a renowned master [[armor]]er and weaponsmith, as well as the owner of [[Thunderhammer Smithy]] in [[Beregost]] during the midâˆ’14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was very well-respected in his town and considered one of the finest smiths in the entirety of the [[Sword Coast]].<ref name=VGSC-p29 />{{Template:Cite book/Player's Guide to the Forgotten Realms Campaign|61}}

==Description==
Taerom was massive in stature, standing over {{SI|7|ft}} tall and measuring nearly {{SI|4|ft}} wide at the shoulders. He had brown hair, streaked with gray that extended down into big muttonchop sideburns. He was something of a gentle giant, expressing himself with soft words in contrast to his imposing presence.<ref name=VGSC-p29 /><ref name=VGSC-p223>

==Activities==
Taerom Fuiruim had extensive knowledge of the use of rare and exotic ores in metal-crafting,<ref name=VGSC-p29> along with other materials. He was even capable of crafting a suit of [[Ankheg plate mail|plate mail]] out of the chitinous shell of [[ankheg]]s.

==Possessions==
In battle, he wielded a massive [[iron]] [[quarterstaff|staff]], with which he could reportedly slay an orc one deft strike.<ref name=VGSC-p29 />

==Relationships==
The master blacksmith employed over a dozen apprentices at his smithy,<ref name=VGSC-p29 /> including [[Surrey]], who left his position to seek better work during the [[iron crisis]].

He often worked in concert with the [[enchanter]] [[Thalantyr]], forging items that were well-suited for [[magic]]al [[item enchantment|enchantment]] by the eccentric mage.
