        "mainbody": "The '''Wolf Knight''' was brigand who once ruled over the [[Keep of the Far Hills]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].",
        "History": "Once a follower of [[Angarn Surfyst]], Wolf Knight betrayed and slew the bandit leader, before seizing the [[Far Hills]]' fortress as his own. Unfortunately for the unnamed lord, his tenure as ruler of the keep was short-lived.\n\nThe Wolf Knight was himself killed by the [[sorceress]] [[Sarunn Thoon]], who posed as a timid captive and prospective lover.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Although his name was lost to the ages, the Wolf Knight appeared as part of Sarunn's tale, as immortalized in ''[[The Witch of the Far Cold Hill]]''."
