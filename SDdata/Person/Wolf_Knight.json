Unfortunately for the unnamed lord, his tenure as ruler of the keep was short-lived.\nThe Wolf Knight was himself killed by the sorceress Sarunn Thoon, who posed as a timid captive and prospective lover.\nAlthough his name was lost to the ages, the Wolf Knight appeared as part of Sarunns tale, as immortalized in The Witch of the Far Cold Hill."
