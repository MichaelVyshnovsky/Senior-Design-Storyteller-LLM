        "mainbody": "'''Cedra''' was a [[yuan-ti]] [[Yuan-ti halfblood|half-breed]] leader and [[sorceress]] who allied with the [[Legion of the Chimera]].",
        "History": "The yuan-ti who served [[Yxunomei]] captured and raped the women of [[Kuldahar]]. Nine months after their rescue, these women gave birth. All the children were girls, all with smooth green skin, pitch-black hair, and the golden eyes of serpents. Among these daughters was Cedra. The men of Kuldahar were furious and couldn't contain their rage. The church of [[Ilmater]] tried to intervene, but they were ran out of town. The mothers carried their half-breed children to the only nearby place that would accept them, [[Dragon's Eye]].\n\nThe angry villagers were planning to storm Dragon's Eye, but the arch[[druid]] [[Iselore]] had returned. He dissuaded the villagers from this plan, and let the mothers and their yuan-ti half-breed children be free. Cedra became their leader and represented the half-blood yuan-ti.\n\nYears later, despite Iselore's mercy, Cedra aligned with The Legion of the Chimera, an evil organization that sought justice for half-breeds. The legion's co-leader, [[Madae]], as well as Cedra, marched their army towards Kuldahar, and launched an attack. Many of the yuan-ti half-breeds formed a contingent and followed their commander, Cedra. Cedra was left to command the army, as Madae had other matters to attend to.\n\nAfter a fierce battle, Cedra and the legion's army fell to Iselore and a party of adventurers."
