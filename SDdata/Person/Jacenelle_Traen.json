        "mainbody": "'''Jacenelle Traen''' was a [[Chondathan]] [[human]] [[wilder]] who led the [[Stray Thoughts]] [[psionic]] mercenary adventuring company based in [[Selgaunt]] in [[Sembia]] in the 1370s [[DR]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionics Across the Land}}",
        "Activities": "Her role was to organize members of the Stray Thoughts to undertake missions, and she herself was away on activities half the time. She assigned prospective members to probationary missions. She would often manifest her [[psionic]] powers to aid members. She was eager to expand the organization, particularly outside Sembia, and would look for someone capable to establish a chapter house elsewhere.",
        "History": "Jacenelle's group was established and active by [[1373 DR]].\n\nAround [[1374 DR]], the Stray Thoughts were engaged by a mysterious being called [[Z'dusk]] to hunt for a psionic [[artifact]] of unspecified nature and powers, for a 25,000 [[gp]] reward. (Unknown to them, it was buried in a sandy cave on Sembia's coast, and was in fact a lost fragment of an [[avatar]] of the [[illithid]] [[deity]] [[Ilsensine]].)"
