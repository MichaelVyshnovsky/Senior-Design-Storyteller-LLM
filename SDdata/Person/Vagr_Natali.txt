'''Vagr Natali''' was the master of [[House Natali]] in [[Melvaunt]] in [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Vagr was elected leader of his house after his father died during [[Dornig Leiyraghon]]'s ascension.

In 1374 DR, many of the children of Melvaunt's noble house went on adventures and disappeared. Vagr agreed to speak with the adventuring party hired by Lord [[Woarsten Nanther]] to find the boys, claiming his innocence despite his son being the only one to remain.

==Personality==
Vagr still hated Dornig for the death of his father.
