'''Surrell''' was one of the richest [[mind flayer]]s on [[Glyth]] and a leading breeder of [[humanoid]]s for illithid consumption.

==Possessions==
Surrell was the owner of the [[12 Skulls Ranch]], a humanoid breeding ranch with a herd of over 12,000 [[oortling]]s located in one of the few surviving forests on the surface of Glyth.

==Activities==
On his ranch, Surrell conducted experiments with selective humanoid breeding. He worked tirelessly, underground by day and on the surface by night, fine-tuning the oortling race so their brains tasted better for mind flayers. The products of his work made him famous across [[Realmspace]] and even known in [[Greyspace]]. His herds were sold at a high price to other mind flayers, but were considered a delicacy.

==Relationships==
Surrell's success drew the envy of other breeders from the planet.

==History==
Selective breeding of oortlings by mind flayers using techniques such as the ones performed by Surrell was one of the causes of the decline of the oortling race. the ones who were captured had their curiosity and creativity bred out of them, leaving behind a broken race of docile, frightened, and cattle-like people.
