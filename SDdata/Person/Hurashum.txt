'''Hurashum''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Abeir]], and one of the ancestors of [[Clan Kepeshkmolik]].

==History==
Hurashum was one of the seven wise elders who raised [[Shasphur]].

One day, Shaspur came with a plan to free the dragonborn slaves from the [[gold dragon]] [[Raurokhymdhar]]. His plan, however, had a flaw: he could not save the elders. The elders decided that Shaspur should flee without them. Hurashum was killed by Raurokhymdhar while misleading the dragon so Shaspur and the other slaves could flee to freedom.
