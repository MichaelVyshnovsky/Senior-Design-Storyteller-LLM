Arrayan Faylin was a female half-orc wizard who lived in Palischuk, in the northeastern region of Vaasa.
Arrayans appearance favored her human half of her heritage, however, her features combined the most attractive qualities of all her racial aspects. Her reddish-brown hair was long and soft, flowing as if her face was framed by a soft red halo. She was short, like many orcs, but because of her mixed blood, Arrayan was far from stocky, and had delicate shoulders. Her face was somewhat orc-like, but set with human-like large emerald green eyes, thick lips, narrow angled eyebrows and a button nose.
In 1368 DR, she was in her mid-twenties. She often wears leather breeches and a vest, and a thin belt with several pouches for her spell components, as well as a set of writing components. Sometimes she dons a blue robe of light material over her clothes, held together at her waist by the belt.
Arrayan had human and orc blood in her, and also some elf, so her mother told her. As a teenager, Arrayan learned her wizardly craft in a wizards tower in Damara.
Around 1368 DR, Arrayan received one of Zhengyis writings from her uncle, Wingham, to study. However, her life-force triggered the unleashing of the Witch-Kings power and the book started to create a replica of Castle Perilous in due course draining Arrayan of her life-force. Arrayan, along with her companion Olgerkhan, and a troupe under command of Ellery Dragonsbane set out to unravel the mystery of book and castle and save her life. Her uncle gave her and Olgerkhan rings of arbitration so that the drain of her life-force could be compensated by Olgerkahns own. After the defeat of the castle and its dweomers, Arrayan and Olgerkhan returned to Palischuk.
Arrayan had known Olgerkhan for all her life but only during the crisis within the construct of Zhengyi had she come to understand the truth of her feelings for him.
