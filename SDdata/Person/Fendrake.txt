Fendrake was an inhabitant of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the 14 century DR.
He was married to Magda. His nephew was a chandler in the town.
Fendrake claimed to have once seen the ghost of the bandit chieftain Fastred.
Years later, in the Bold Bard tavern in early Eleint of the , his nephew the chandler used Fendrakes sighting as proof of the ghosts existence, saying hed never seen anything that wasnt there. The tailor pointed to Magdas looks to disprove this.
