        "mainbody": "'''Smallfry''' was a tavern owner in [[Skullport]].",
        "Personality": "Smallfry was an irritable, short-tempered, and pushy individual. The smallest criticism of his cooking made him furious, and he would quickly order his staff to eject or dispose of anyone uncultured enough to find fault with one of his meals.",
        "Activities": "Smallfry managed, owned, and cooked for his restaurant, the [[Smallfry's Pantry]].",
        "History": "Smallfry was a good-natured adventurer in [[Undermountain]] until he found a bejeweled ''[[helm of opposite alignment]]'' in a [[kuo-toa]] temple. His fellow adventurers immediately noted the change in Smallfry's behavior, and tried to reverse the effect. What happened next is unknown, save that Smallfry returned to Skullport some time later, and never spoke on the matter again. Later in life, he opened an innovative restaurant."
