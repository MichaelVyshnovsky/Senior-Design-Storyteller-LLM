'''Iliyasha Guidingstar''' was an [[sun elf]] resident of [[New Sharandar]] during the late 15{{th}} century of the [[Calendar of Harptos|Faerûnian calendar]].

{{Quote|While little remains of [[Sharandar|Old Sharandar]], the ruins still hold many ancient [[elven]] [[relic]]s which must be protected from thieves.}}

==History==
When the [[fomorian]] king [[Malabog]] threatened the elves of New Sharandar ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Iliyasha was one of the envoys who traveled to the [[Neverwinter]] to recruit allies from among its residents. She worked with some adventurers to fight back against the [[troll]]s and [[dark fey]] creatures that continued to plunder the ruins of Old Sharandar, before they ventured into her home in the [[Feywild]].
