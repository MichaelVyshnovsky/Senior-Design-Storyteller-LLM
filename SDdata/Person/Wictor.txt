Wictor, the Lord of Here-and-There was a spell-casting bandit, active in the 15 century DR.
Wictor carried a staff through which he cast ranged poionous black vapors at his opponents. He also flung death bolts—missiles of magical necrotic energy—and used the slow spell.
Following the years of Spellplague after 1385 DR, Wictor was among those locked away in the Prison of Mirrors of Gauntlgrym. When a group of heroes broke into the jail to free the thief Jartok, the only man who knew the way into the vault of Gauntlgrym and the hellthorn cube within. Wictor, the Lord of Here-and-There, was among many enemies that unsuccessfully attacked the adventurers.
