'''Wictor, the Lord of Here-and-There''' was a spell-casting bandit, active in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Wictor carried a [[staff]] through which he cast ranged [[poion]]ous ''[[black vapors]]'' at his opponents. He also flung ''[[death bolt]]s''—missiles of magical necrotic energy—and used the ''[[slow]]'' spell.

==History==
Following the years of [[Spellplague]] after [[1385 DR]], Wictor was among those locked away in the [[Prison of Mirrors]] of [[Gauntlgrym]]. When a group of heroes broke into the jail to free the [[thief]] [[Jartok]], the only man who knew the way into the vault of Gauntlgrym and the ''[[hellthorn cube]]'' within. Wictor, the Lord of Here-and-There, was among many enemies that unsuccessfully attacked the adventurers.
