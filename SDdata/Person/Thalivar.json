        "mainbody": "Thalivar was a wizard in the late 13 century DR. He resided in the High Tower of Thalivar in Leilon. After his death, Thalivars ghost remained bound to the tower, until it was laid to rest in the late 15 century DR.\nThalivar used his tower as a laboratory for his research on the planes, predominantly the ethereal plane. He built a planar beacon at the top of his tower that radiated into other worlds, luring extraplanar creatures toward it and paralyzing them for his research. Over the years, the solitary wizard accumulated an astonishing collection of creatures and filled the towers library with his studies.\nThalivar was assisted by his loyal fey companion Soapwort.\nSometime in the late 13 century DR, Thalivar built his tower in the middle of Leilon on the Sword Coast North. It served as the center for the wizards magical research. The tower was fitted with a planar beacon, which lured extraplanar creatures toward it, and special holding cells that could then be used to capture these creatures. However, upon Thalivars discovery of a Netherese artifact called the Ruinstone in the ethereal plane, a wild magic surge disabled the protective wards keeping his captured test subjects docile. The creatures broke free, damaged the beacon, and collapsed part of the tower onto the wizard, killing him. However, Thalivars spirit remained bound to his tower.\nThalivars tower was torn down in the midâ€“1480s DR on the orders of Lord Protector Dagult Neverember of Neverwinter. The tower was cleared of the dangers within and then rebuilt by Neverwintan soldiers under the supervision of the mage Gallio Elibro. Once the tower finally became safe for people to enter, Thalivars ghost began possessing Gallio, taking control of him during nights in order to continue his old planar research. Neither Gallio nor Thalivar were actually aware of this arrangement, with the former believing he was simply having restless sleep and the latter believing he was still alive but trapped in a nightmare in which his tower was in ruins. A group of adventurers laid Thalivars ghost to rest, freeing Gallio from his possession and allowing him to continue his research."
