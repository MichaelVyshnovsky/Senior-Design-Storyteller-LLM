        "mainbody": "'''Thalivar''' was a [[wizard]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. He resided in the [[High Tower of Thalivar]] in [[Leilon]]. After his death, Thalivar's ghost remained bound to the tower, until it was laid to rest in the late 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "Activities": "Thalivar used his tower as a laboratory for his research on the planes, predominantly the [[ethereal plane]]. He built a ''[[planar beacon]]'' at the top of his tower that radiated into other worlds, luring [[Outsider|extraplanar]] creatures toward it and paralyzing them for his research. Over the years, the solitary wizard accumulated an astonishing collection of creatures and filled the tower's library with his studies.",
        "Relationships": "Thalivar was assisted by his loyal [[fey]] companion [[Soapwort]].",
        "History": "Sometime in the late 13{{th}} century DR, Thalivar built his tower in the middle of Leilon on the [[Sword Coast North]]. It served as the center for the wizard's magical research. The tower was fitted with a ''planar beacon'', which lured [[Outsider|extraplanar]] creatures toward it, and special holding cells that could then be used to capture these creatures. However, upon Thalivar's discovery of a [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[artifact]] called the ''[[Ruinstone]]'' in the ethereal plane, a [[wild magic]] surge disabled the protective [[Ward|wards]] keeping his captured test subjects docile. The creatures broke free, damaged the beacon, and collapsed part of the tower onto the wizard, killing him. However, Thalivar's spirit remained bound to his tower.\n\nThalivar's tower was torn down in the midâ€“1480s DR on the orders of Lord Protector [[Dagult Neverember]] of [[Neverwinter]]. The tower was cleared of the dangers within and then rebuilt by Neverwintan soldiers under the supervision of the mage [[Gallio Elibro]]. Once the tower finally became safe for people to enter, Thalivar's [[ghost]] began possessing Gallio, taking control of him during nights in order to continue his old planar research. Neither Gallio nor Thalivar were actually aware of this arrangement, with the former believing he was simply having restless sleep and the latter believing he was still alive but trapped in a nightmare in which his tower was in ruins. A group of [[adventurers]] laid Thalivar's ghost to rest, freeing Gallio from his possession and allowing him to continue his research."
