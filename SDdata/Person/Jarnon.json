        "mainbody": "'''Jarnon''' was a member of the [[Society of Stalwart Adventurers]] from [[Suzail]], active in mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In [[1362 DR]],{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} Jarnon could often be found in the Society of Stalwart Adventurers' library. There, he participated in the reenactments of famous [[Cormyr]]ian historic battles, using enchanted miniature infantry and monsters. These reenactments were a sort of a war game with several strict rules. During one such match, Jarnon unleashed a tiny lead [[red dragon]] to smite his opponent. This act was called a foul by his opponent, and the little dragon's flames damaged the guild's expensive [[Shou]] carpets. This event happened shortly before everyone present in the library witnessed [[Ariast]]'s hands being crushed by a mysterious four-armed humanoid, seeming in service of [[Artus Cimber]]."
