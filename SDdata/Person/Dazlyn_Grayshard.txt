Dazlyn Grayshard was a shield dwarf prospector in the late 15th century DR. Together with her business partner, Norbus Ironrune, she discovered the ruins of the temple of Abbathor in the Sword Mountains.
Dazlyn was sincere and enjoyed joking around with Norbus.
Dazlyn and Norbus owned a pair of sending stones.
When prospecting for gold in the Sword Mountains southwest of Phandalin, Dazlyn and Norbus came across the ruins of a temple of Abbathor and the nearby dwarven settlement that had been buried by an landslide a long time ago. In the following months, the two dwarves excavated the ruins until they encountered the ochre jellies that had infested the temple.
When a group of adventurers came to the excavation site and warned Dazlyn and Norbus of the young white dragon Cryovain who had settled in the area, the dwarves hired the adventurers to clear the temple of the oozes. As payment, they offered their sending stones.
