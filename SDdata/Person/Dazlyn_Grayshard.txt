'''Dazlyn Grayshard''' was a [[shield dwarf]] prospector in the late 15<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]]. Together with her business partner, [[Norbus Ironrune]], she discovered the ruins of the [[temple of Abbathor]] in the [[Sword Mountains]].

==Description==
Dazlyn was sincere and enjoyed joking around with Norbus.

==Possessions==
Dazlyn and Norbus owned a pair of [[sending stones]].

==History==
When prospecting for gold in the Sword Mountains southwest of [[Phandalin]], Dazlyn and Norbus came across the ruins of a temple of [[Abbathor]] and the nearby [[Dwarf|dwarven]] settlement that had been buried by an landslide a long time ago. In the following months, the two dwarves excavated the ruins until they encountered the [[ochre jellies]] that had infested the temple.

When a group of adventurers came to the excavation site and warned Dazlyn and Norbus of the young [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] who had settled in the area, the dwarves hired the adventurers to clear the temple of the [[Ooze|oozes]]. As payment, they offered their [[sending stones]].
