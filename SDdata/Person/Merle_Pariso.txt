Merle Pariso was a battle-mage in Calimport in 1364 DR. He was considered one of the most lethal killers of the city and often worked for House Basadoni. 
In 1364 DR, Kadran Gordeon secretly hired him to kill Artemis Entreri. Entreri fought well against Merle but Merles magical abilities eventually overwhelmed Entreri. However, when the assassin was at Merles mercy, the timely arrival of Bregan Daerthe saved Entreris life and Merle was killed by the drow.
