'''Merle Pariso''' was a battle-mage in [[Calimport]] in [[1364 DR]]. He was considered one of the most lethal killers of the city and often worked for [[House Basadoni]]. 

In 1364 DR, [[Kadran Gordeon]] secretly hired him to kill [[Artemis Entreri]]. Entreri fought well against Merle but Merle's magical abilities eventually overwhelmed Entreri. However, when the [[assassin]] was at Merle's mercy, the timely arrival of [[Bregan D'aerthe]] saved Entreri's life and Merle was killed by the [[drow]].
