She preferred to travel alone, but was quite willing to temporarily ally with others of similar views, for deeds well within the law.\nInstead of a personal crest, she used the holy symbol of Tyr, a warhammer and scales, as her own.\nZandess was described as beautiful and dusky-skinned.\nZandess Darthiir was born a noble of Tethyr, but ran away from her decadent and feuding parents while still a child. She fled to Amn and was taken in by the priests and paladins of Tyr. They raised young Zandess in the Amnian mountains and trained her to be an \"arm of justice\", as a paladin of the Just God.\nUpon completion of her training, Zandess was sent to the Inner Sea lands to do the churchs work and aid Tyrran priests there. By 1367 DR, she was operating in the Western Heartlands and along the Dragon Coast.\nShe was among the first members of the newly formed Moonstars organization in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR. She was one of twelve senior agents under Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun though she disagreed with his habit of bending rules and laws, she trusted his overall support for justice, law, and order.\nBy 1372 DR, however, she had converted to the worship of Ilmater, the Crying God. She remained active in Impiltur and was still a member of the Moonstars.Although initially described as a paladin of Tyr in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition, Zandess was statted as a paladin of Ilmater in City of Splendors Waterdeep, implying shed converted from one god of the Triad to another. Furthermore, she was given the class of martyred champion of Ilmater, requiring her to have died in heroic sacrifice and been restored to life at some point, in addition to worshiping Ilmater. These events have not been detailed.\nZandess traveled with several horses her warhorse, pack horses, and a spare mount, all fully armored and equipped."
