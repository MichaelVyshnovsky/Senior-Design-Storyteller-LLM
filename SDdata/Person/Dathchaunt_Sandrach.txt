'''Dathchaunt Sandrach''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|641}} to {{yearlink|657}}. He worked on combination spells.

==Description==
He was tall, and eagle-nosed.

==History==
Dathchchaunt became the [[Magister]] after slaying [[Irithra Dawntanthra]] while in the way to fighting a [[white dragon]]. The previous Magister was already wounded, and when she left the dragon's lair, she assumed the mage was aiming to kill her.

His first act as the Magister was to offer his life in exchange for that of the previous Magister, as he admired Irithra Dawntanthra; Mystra refused, instead requesting his service. Dathchaunt agreed, but was not told how to serve her; he consulted temples of [[Mystra]] and [[Azuth]] to look for the history of previous Magisters. Concluding he had to give new magic freely, Dathchaunt began crafting combination spells. He neglected personal defenses and rival-hunting, simply sharing scrolls of his exploits from time to time.

In an experimentation with a ''[[ball lightning]]'' spell, during a summer storm, his casting attracted three bolts, and vaporized him instantly. Per [[Azuth]], this was a fully natural phenomenon, and Dathchaunt still served [[Mystra]] as of the late 14{{th}} century DR.
