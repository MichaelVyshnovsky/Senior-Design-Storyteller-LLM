'''Shan Khantayan''' was a chieftain in the [[Northern Wastes]] of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Personality==
Shan was not a very able leader but luckily had good counsel from [[Ayana No-Shui]], a fact that all his people knew and accepted. He was a very vain individual, especially susceptible to jewellery and flattery. Through these, he could be easily manipulated.
