Shan Khantayan was a chieftain in the Northern Wastes of Kara-Tur.
Shan was not a very able leader but luckily had good counsel from Ayana No-Shui, a fact that all his people knew and accepted. He was a very vain individual, especially susceptible to jewellery and flattery. Through these, he could be easily manipulated.
