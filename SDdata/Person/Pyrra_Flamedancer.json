        "mainbody": "'''Pyrra Flamedancer''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]] and co-leader of the [[Ruby Blades]] [[adventuring company]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Pyrra had a plain and unassuming appearance.",
        "Personality": "She was shy and self-conscious, and extremely obsessed with fire and fire-related [[spell]]s.",
        "Abilities": "The vast majority of her spells were flashy and destructive fire-based [[evocation]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Pyrra wore ''[[bracers of defense]]'' and a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]''. Offensively, she carried a ''[[wand of fire]]'' and a ''[[necklace of missiles]]''.",
        "Relationships": "She was best friends with [[Ranni Stalkersdaughter]], and together they led the Ruby Blades.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Ruby Blades joined the [[Wolfmasters]] company on an excursion to explore and loot [[Orvaskyte Keep]] in the [[Vast Swamp]]. The Ruby Blades were heavily delayed, and by the time they arrived their allies were already dead. Seeking a new goal, they attempted to hunt a nearby [[black dragon]], only to be overwhelmed and almost killed by it, and were rescued by a band of [[Cormyr]]ean adventurers. Their fortune waxed once more, and they were joined by two-dozen mercenaries that allowed them to chase away the Cormyreans and secure what was left of Orvaskyte Keep."
