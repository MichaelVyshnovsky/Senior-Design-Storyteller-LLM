        "mainbody": "Pawldo was a halfling adventurer who ostensibly lived in Lowhill.\nPawldo was a clean shaven, short and hardy individual around 3 ft (0.9 m) in height with shoulder length gray hair.\nUnlike most of his kin, Pawldo lived for a life of excitement.\nPawldo was often seen wearing a worn leather jacket and ancient yet fine-oiled boots.\nHe often traveled with Prince Tristan Kendrick, Robyn, and Daryth of Calimshan.\nThroughout the winter of 1344 DR, Pawldo traveled about the Moonshae Isles and the Sword Coast in search of adventure and profit., Pawldo was a seller of hounds. Later that night, he headed toward Lowhill with the halfling maiden Allian with whom he was attending a dance.\nIn 1365 DR, Pawldo was slain shortly before the defeat and banishment of Ityak-Ortheel \"the Elf Eater\"."
