'''Kerrachus''' was a dockhand who worked in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was an enthusiastic man with a genuinely positive outlook on his future.

==Activities==
Kerrachus had the privilege of unloading goods from the 'royal galleys', upon their return from the "New World" of [[Maztica]].

He longed to stow away aboard one of those ships, and see the New World for himself.

==Abilities==
He had a unique understanding of the physical shape of [[Toril]], believing it to be a perfect sphere. According to Kerrachus, Toril had shifted from a flat plane to a sphere, with [[Faerûn]] was positioned atop its upper half, while Maztica clung to its underside.
