Kerrachus was a dockhand who worked in the city of Baldurs Gate during the mid–14 century DR.
He was an enthusiastic man with a genuinely positive outlook on his future.
Kerrachus had the privilege of unloading goods from the royal galleys, upon their return from the "New World" of Maztica.
He longed to stow away aboard one of those ships, and see the New World for himself.
He had a unique understanding of the physical shape of Toril, believing it to be a perfect sphere. According to Kerrachus, Toril had shifted from a flat plane to a sphere, with Faerûn was positioned atop its upper half, while Maztica clung to its underside.
