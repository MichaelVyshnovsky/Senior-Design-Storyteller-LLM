Maforie Chûmavh was a drow slave in Maerimydra.
Maforie lived all her life in slavery to the fire giant rulers of her city.
As of 1491 DR, Maforie was at the entrance to the Undying Temple.
Unlike most drow females, Maforie was shy and quiet, but still distrustful of others.
Unknown to herself, Maforie was the last heiress of House Chûmavh.
