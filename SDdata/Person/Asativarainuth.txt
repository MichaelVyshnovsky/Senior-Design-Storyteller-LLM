Asativarainuth, also known as the Silver Death, was a silver dragon who lived in Laerakond in the late years of the 13th century DR.
At some point prior to the 13th century DR, Asativarainuth had custody of the powerful relic known as the Eye of Blazing Rorn.
During the dragonborn rebellion that led to the foundation of Tymanchebar, circa 1279 DR, the dragonborn heroes Iskdara and Shurideh killed Asativarainuth in order to steal the Eye of Blazing Rorn. This battle was later known as the Battle of Arambar Gulch.
