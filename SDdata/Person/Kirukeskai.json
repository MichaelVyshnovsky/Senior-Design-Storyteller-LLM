        "mainbody": "Kirukeskai, also called the Eye, was an elder orb who was the first beholder to hold The Xanathar as a title instead of a name.\nKirukeskai was an elder orb whose body had grown It was of very advanced age for its species and was much wrinkled.\nKirukeskai was exceptionally paranoid, While beholders generally did not leave their homes and generally worked through intermediaries, Kirukeskai exclusively worked through intermediaries and never went out of its fortified homes in Skullport and the southern half of the third level of Undermountain, which it managed because these homes were linked via a portal. or that it was not the first one to rule their criminal organization. Another group that knew of the former fact were the eleven eyes of Xanathar, though it was not clear whether they knew of the latter fact.\nBeholders in general were megalomaniac creatures It viewed all creatures on the surface as slaves for its taking and it viewed humanoids who tried to become closer to beholders by becoming ocular adepts as arrogant pawns.\nBeholders in general believed themselves to be intelligent. The Eye was very intelligent even by beholder standards and a competent businessman.\nKirukeskai was a cruel parent who charmed its offspring into subservience until they matured. Then he turned them into death tyrants.\nThe Eye felt the deteriorating effects of its great age, and by 1370 DR it had begun trying magical means of staving of the ageing process. It drank potions of longevity, but slowly as to avoid their backlash effects. It even ordered the kidnapping of mighty clerics to cast heal or regenerate on it, which could restore function to one of its failing eyestalks for a day, before it killed the unfortunate cleric. \nKirukeskai was an old elder orb. This meant that it was not as agile as other beholders and while it was big, it was not much physically stronger than other beholders because its advanced age deteriorated its physical capacities.\nKirukeskai was old and as mentioned above, his body underwent deterioration. Two of his eyestalks, the ones which allowed him the casting of disintegrate and flesh to stone, had completely stopped working and needed magical care administered by kidnapped priests to work. A third eyestalk, the one allowing the Eye to cast charm person, worked only half of the time.\nEvery elder orb had sorcerous powers. The Eyes sorcery was strong even by that races standards. It could additionally cast death fog, demand, dimension door, ESP, fly, spell turning, wall of fog, and wall of force once per day.\nAs a general rule, the Eye did not kill its enemies outright. Instead it tried to keep enemies alive for interrogation purposes.\nThe Eye wore a ring of proof against detection and location on one of its eyestalks and used beads of force, a cloak of arachnida, oil of timelessness, a ring of feather falling, a staff of curing, and a wand of lightning. It also carried with it a bag of holding  of the maximum size. Its most unique item was one that worked on one end like a vorpal longsword and on the other end a gauntlet that worked with the missile storing property, which it could use like a hand.\nKirukeskai was constantly surrounded by entire swarms of lurking stranglers and eyeballs.\nKirukeskai was a crime lord who ran the Xanathars Thieves Guild, who shared the top smuggler position with Malakuth Tabuirr.\nHe controlled all the beholders of Undermountain and those who did not want to follow its lead were in serious danger and were forced to leave for the surface or other places away from Waterdeep.\nKirukeskai was the head of the Xanathars Thieves Guild.\nthumb|right|400px|From left to right Avaereene, Colstan Rhuul, Shindia Darkeyes, Slink Monteskor, Kirukeskai, Randulaith, Ott Steeltoes, and Slan Thurbel.\nAhmaergo The Master of Slavery viewed Kirukeskai, or to be more precise his continued supervision, as annoying. It was rumored that he wanted to become independent.\nAvaereene Out of the Masters, the Mistress of Slavery worked with the Eye the longest and therefore had a better understanding of him.\nColstan Rhuul The Master of Assassins was opting for a position of power in Waterdeep after his master died.\nOtt Steeltoes The Master of Smuggling and Thieving liked working under Kirukeskai because it left him more freedom in how he pursued his job.\nRandulaith The Master of Magical Defense and Information Gathering wanted to become a member of the Lords of Waterdeep, something the Eye encouraged. He got on his masters nerves for taking vacations to meet mermaids and there was contingency spell on the Master to teleport his dead body back for raising.\nShindia Darkeyes The Master of Blackmail, Extortion, and Information Gathering worked for the Eye only grudgingly, to the point that she plotted against her leader (Kirukeskai was aware of her plans).\nSlan Thurbel The Master of Enforcement and Mercenaries was happy working for the Eye because unlike its predecessor, Kirukeskai was willing to feed his vanity with praises.\nSlink Monteskor The Master of Information Gathering was the Eyes accountant and manager of its spy network. He knew so much that Kirukeskai was prepared to use a large amount of resources to get him back or killed in the case of his capture.\nEleven Eyes of Xanathar The eyes of Xanathar were the truly trusted spy-assassins of the Eye. They and not the Masters were the real force behind the guilds success. They also received a magic item called an Eye of Xanathar.\nThe Lords of Waterdeep were a hypothetical enemy of the Eye. They were enemies of any thieves guild but they had no clue that the Xanathars Thieves Guild was even active.\nKirukeskai was the master of the beholders of Undermountain.\nXanathar The original Xanathar was killed by Kirukeskai and its position was usurped by it. The Eye kept the name and changed it into \"The Xanathar\" to make it sound like a title.\nMisker A beholder from the same hive as Kirukeskai, these two were rivals in the smuggling market. The Eye took over its business share. Misker hid away from the Eyes violence.\nChed Nasad The Eye came from the Graypeaks Hive,\nDark Dagger Kirukeskai and these Vhaeraunite drow had a complex relationship. On one hand, they were competitors on the slavery market, on the other hand, they were allies in the form of the Iron Ring, which the followers of Vhaeraun were a part of. Truth was that Kirukeskai found this competition amusing.\nThe Eye, as Kirukeskai was nicknamed, was an ancient, wrinkled, and paranoid beholder of the Graypeaks Hive in the Graypeak Mountains.\nThe Eye arrived in Skullport in 1205 DR, already a slaver in search of a greater market. In time, his business and his organization grew. At one point, he re-organized his organization into a semi-autonomous model and retreated into the background, spreading rumors about his demise or retirement. Soon, most people forgot about the beholder slaver and in 1304 DR the Agents of the Eye were simply a large slaving ring in Skullport with no association with beholders.\nMeanwhile, the Eye investigated the Xanathar Thieves Guild, a powerful thieves guild, and in time discovered that they were also led by a beholder, a beholder of a different hive. Thus the Eye decided to take control, by killing and taking the position of Xanathar. The Eye discovered all Xanathars secrets and at the same time manipulated another Skullport beholder, Uthh, into wanting to kill Xanathar.\nEventually, Uthh fought Xanathar in his lair Xanathar slew Uthh but was too weak to resist the following surprise attack by the Eye. The Eye killed Xanathar and inherited all his holdings.\nThe Eye couldnt pretend to be his predecessor so, in order to avoid problems, said that \"the Xanathar\" was just a title. Afterward, the Eye gathered together the Agents of the Eye and the Xanathars Guild.\nThe Eye then controlled an extensive slaving operation in Skullport, rivaled only by the Iron Ring and the resurgent Shadow Thieves. It also muscled in on Skullports smuggling operations, at the expense of its beholder rival, Misker the Pirate Tyrant.\nThe Eye extended its control over all the beholders of Undermountain, forcing those who refused to bow to its rule to flee into the Underdark or to the surface. Its sole remaining rival, Misker, was forced to flee into the depths and hid in the abandoned Trobriands Graveyard.\nIn 1379 DR, one of his minions, Shynlar Draal, was captured by the Unyielding Sword mercenaries hired by the slaver Lanador alongside some other elves the Xanathar supported an adventuring party hired by the City Watch to investigate the matter and defeated the slaver.\nThe Eye was later killed in a fight with his former agent lich Avaereene. As of 1479 DR, an ancient beholder called the Blind was living in the lowest levels of Skullport and claiming to be Kirukeskai. He claimed he had survived the fight with Avaereene and was seeking a relic to restore his power and help him get revenge on her.\nIt was rumored that the Eye was in fact the second beholder to assume the name of Xanathar. In truth, the Eye was killed by an adventuring band under orders of the Lords of Waterdeep and secretly aided by another beholder that assumed the identity of the Xanathar.\nKirukeskai was at least the second beholder to carry the name \"Xanathar\", meaning there was a slight chance that he was not the second but later incarnation of \"the Xanathar\", though he was definitely the first to use it as a title instead of a name."
