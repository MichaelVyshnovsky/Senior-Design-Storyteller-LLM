Aziz min Hajama was a dwarven moralist who served as the commander of the Gate of Revelations within the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Aziz was serious about his duties, often taking the time to personally interview individuals who aroused his suspicion. He used divination magic to discover the truth during these interviews.
Aziz owned some bracers of defense, a ring of djinni summoning, boots of striding and leaping, and carried a staff of the serpent.
