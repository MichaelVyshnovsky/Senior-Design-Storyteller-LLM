Felodar never loved his country or his family his only interest was amassing wealth. He departed his realm in the . Soon, he established a base in Calimshan, where he established trade between Athalantar and Calimshan and other lands, which enriched and satisfied his father, King Uthgrael Aumar. However, Felodar also involved himself in all kinds of criminal dealings.
He became so powerful in Calimshan that he decided to send his own group of mages, dubbed the Night Mages, to confront the magelords who followed his brother Belaur Aumar, but with no success.
Felodar remained a threat to Belaurs rule for much of the time the eldest prince sat on the Stag Throne but at last he was poisoned by a Calishite rival in late 239 DR.
