        "mainbody": "'''Rathwill''' was an apprentice [[wizard]] of [[Kya Mordrayn]]'s cell of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] stationed in the [[Tower of Bones]], [[Polyandrium]] of [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1369 DR]].",
        "Possessions": "Like other members of the Cult of the Dragon, Rathwill was armed with an enchanted ''+1 [[claw bracer]]'' that freed his hands for spellcasting, a ''[[spellbook]]'', and one ''[[potion of spider climb]]''.",
        "History": "In 1369 DR, Rathwill was stationed in the Tower of Bones' second floor, under direct command of [[Ryngoth]] who supervised excavations and undead human resources of the cult. Being an apprentice, Rathwill was put in charge of recordkeeping and logistical orders, keeping track of food storages, drinking water, and headcount of the [[zombie]] laborers.\n\nWhen he was confronted by a group of heroes that followed the Cult in search of abducted villagers, Rathwill assumed the new faces were nothing but fellow members of the Cult of the Dragon. At the time he was not particularly worried about intruders as he felt safe being guarded by two cult sentries."
