Caliph '''Mogan bin Ahmed''' was the ruler of [[Mahabba]] in the [[Pantheist League]] of [[interior Zakhara]] in the early 1360's [[DR]].{{AQ-time}} 

==History==
Mogan was assassinated by [[Bala|Balanite]] heretics during a failed rebellion in [[1360 DR]]. The [[League Conclave]] appointed [[Ma'mum al-Sahnan]] to impose martial law in Mahabba and crush the rebellion. Ma'mum was later confirmed as caliph of the city.
