'''Shymon and Scarbunkel''' was a duo of traveling [[minstrel]]s who performed across the tavern and inns of the [[Sword Coast North]] and [[northwest Faerûn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Both Shymon and Scarbunkel were young and striking [[human]] males. Shymon was a tall, light-skinned man with blond, sleeked-back hair, blue eyes, and sharply chiseled features. He carried himself with the confidence and panache of an experienced performer beloved by all audiences. Shymon wore a finely-decorated [[bard]]ic garb of contrasting black and white colors. Scarbunkel, in turn, was a dark-featured, obsequious man with brown eyes and, dark short hair and immaculately-trimmed facial hair. He wore an adventuring bard's garb, preferring its practicality. Both men played [[lute]]s.

==History==
Sometime around and after the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Shymon and Scarbunkel could be heard performing their songs, including the weeping and melodic ''[[Then My Mourning Heart Can Sleep]]'', across the settlements of the north around [[Neverwinter]]. These venues included the [[Wandering Woodsman's Tavern]] in [[Conyberry]], the [[Danley and Sons Inn]] in [[Phandalin]], the [[Dusty Gnome Tavern]] in [[Leilon]], the [[New Leaf Tavern]] in the hamlet of [[New Leaf]], the [[Phoenix Tail Inn]] in the [[Crossroad Keep]], the [[Seaspray Inn]] in [[Highcliff]], and the [[The Hammer and Shield Inn]] in [[Thundertree]].
