Shymon and Scarbunkel was a duo of traveling minstrels who performed across the tavern and inns of the Sword Coast North and northwest Faer√ªn in the late 14 century DR.
Both Shymon and Scarbunkel were young and striking human males. Shymon was a tall, light-skinned man with blond, sleeked-back hair, blue eyes, and sharply chiseled features. He carried himself with the confidence and panache of an experienced performer beloved by all audiences. Shymon wore a finely-decorated bardic garb of contrasting black and white colors. Scarbunkel, in turn, was a dark-featured, obsequious man with brown eyes and, dark short hair and immaculately-trimmed facial hair. He wore an adventuring bards garb, preferring its practicality. Both men played lutes.
Sometime around and after the , Shymon and Scarbunkel could be heard performing their songs, including the weeping and melodic Then My Mourning Heart Can Sleep, across the settlements of the north around Neverwinter. These venues included the Wandering Woodsmans Tavern in Conyberry, the Danley and Sons Inn in Phandalin, the Dusty Gnome Tavern in Leilon, the New Leaf Tavern in the hamlet of New Leaf, the Phoenix Tail Inn in the Crossroad Keep, the Seaspray Inn in Highcliff, and the The Hammer and Shield Inn in Thundertree.
