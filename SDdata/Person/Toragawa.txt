'''Toragawa''' was a head [[sohei]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Toragawa was the head sohei at the [[Kanchai Temple]] of Miyama and also the overseer of the local [[shoen]]. He constantly drilled 500 sohei to keep them sharp for the defense of the temple.

==Personality==
Toragawa preferred to work with his men than manage the estate, so he deferred the administrative work of the shoen to his lieutenants.
