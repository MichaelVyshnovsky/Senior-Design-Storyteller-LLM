Toragawa was a head sohei in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Toragawa was the head sohei at the Kanchai Temple of Miyama and also the overseer of the local shoen. He constantly drilled 500 sohei to keep them sharp for the defense of the temple.
Toragawa preferred to work with his men than manage the estate, so he deferred the administrative work of the shoen to his lieutenants.
