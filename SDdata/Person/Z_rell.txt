Disciple Zrell was a devotee of the Absolute and a warlock with a fiend patron, who served the goddess and her cult during the 15 century DR.
Zrell kept her hair in plaits that ran back along her head. She lost her right eye, and had a large scar running down that side of her face.
She was exceptionally intelligent and had a mind like a steel trap.
Disciple Zrell held power over any and all of the Absolutes followers. Her abilities did not work on any non-believers.
Zrell carried an enchanted +1 handaxe and the Absolutes Protector magic shield.
Zrell directly served Ketheric Thorm, chosen of the Absolute, at the cults outpost of Moonrise Towers.
At some point, Zrell visited the Shattered Sanctum, one of the strongholds maintained by the cult of the Absolute. Zrell "complimented" its goblin members, saying they may not be worthless if they killed humans as well as they chased chickens. This garnered Zrell the affections of Klagga, a goblin raider with a stumpy leg and a bad eye.
Under the orders from Ketheric Thorm, Zrell handpicked an envoy to establish contact with the Shadow Druids â€“ an important tool in distracting, weakening, and corrupting the Emerald Grove and the Cloak Wood druidic circles. Zrells pick was to coerce, threaten, and bribe the Shadow Druids, and eventually, infecting them with illithid tadpoles.
