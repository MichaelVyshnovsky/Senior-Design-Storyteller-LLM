        "mainbody": "Guthewulfe Henghelm was a traveling Uthgardt barbarian trader from the region of Icewind Dale, active in the early 14 century DR.\nGuthewulfe was a friendly and boisterous man who eagerly invited strangers to share a drink with him. He participated in drinking competitions with anyone except dwarves, due to the Stout Folks resilience when dealing with hard liquor.\nThe barbarian merchant carried a selection of quality iron arms to trade with, as well as a special barbarian drink called braehg. Guthewulfe also wore an enchanted silver howling wolf charm that allowed him to summon a gray wolf ally. He won the magic charm from his cousins husband in a drinking game and had been using it as a lucky charm since then. Guthewulfe was willing to bet the charm against a good competitive drinker.\nIn the , the Legion of the Chimera assailed the Ten Towns and besieged the town of Targos with an army of goblins. Guthewulfe traveled up the Shaengarne to trade with Targos and settled in the The Salty Dog Tavern for the winter months when the river was frozen over. When Guthewulfe entered Targos, he refused to aid the towns defenses and freeze up on the palisades. The result of the refusal was an order that forbade the barbarian to unsheathe his axe while within the walls of the settlement. Guthewulfes code of honor demanded the he obey the promise hed given.\nThe barbarian was merrily drinking when the goblins launched a surprise attack on the docks, avoiding the palisades and fortifications altogether. As the fighting raged outside, Guthewulfe refused to believe such preposterous claims that goblins were attacking the docks, as hed not heard a signal horn from the palisades or defenders call to arms."
