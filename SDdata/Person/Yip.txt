Yip was a madman in Phlan in 1489 DR.
Yip used to live in a village near Phlan. One day in 1489 DR a disaster hit his village and he was the only survivor. He arrived in the city blabbering incoherent words about a dracolich. Aleyd Burral of the Knights of the Black Fist noticed him and somehow managed to take him to the temple of Kelemvor, where the priests took care of him. Later, the high priest Yovir Glandon hired an adventuring party to investigate the matter.
