'''Yip''' was a madman in [[Phlan]] in [[1489 DR]].

==History==
Yip used to live in a village near Phlan. One day in 1489 DR a disaster hit his village and he was the only survivor. He arrived in the city blabbering incoherent words about a [[dracolich]]. [[Aleyd Burral]] of the [[Knights of the Black Fist]] noticed him and somehow managed to take him to the temple of [[Kelemvor]], where the priests took care of him. Later, the high priest [[Yovir Glandon]] hired an adventuring party to investigate the matter.{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows over the Moonsea|7-8}}
