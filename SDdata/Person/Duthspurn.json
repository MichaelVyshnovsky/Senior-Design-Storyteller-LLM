        "mainbody": "Duthspurn was a [[Zhentilar]] swordsman in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. His legs were recognizable.",
        "Description": "He was known to have multiple legs, almost certainly two. His legs were easily recognizable.",
        "Possessions": "He was wearing [[boots]] prior to his death. Those were not needed to recognize him.",
        "Relationships": "He was under the command of [[Lyrkon]], in a squad including the mageling [[Fimril]]. The swordmaster Lyrkon could easily recognize him by his legs.",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|1357}}, Duthspurn's squad struck at [[Shandril Shessair]], with intent to capture, in [[Hullack Forest]]. As a countermeasure for her [[spellfire]], Fimril used a spell of all-consuming darkness, which generated a slowly advancing dark band ahead of his men. Shandril's spellfire could not penetrate the barrier, but by striking under the band, she managed to disintegrate one of the men's legs; he tripped forward, screaming, and fell into the band of darkness, which annihilated selectively the top half of his body.\n\nThough their capture initially succeeded, it was at the cost of five casualties of their own, including Duthspurn himself, who had been reduced to a pair of legs. This was sufficient for his identification."
