        "mainbody": "'''Baerann Kordeemur''' was a famous composer of [[Mulhessen]], considered to be the most prestigious tunesmith of [[Sembia]] by some in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Baerann was a handsome, womanizing man with a white beard.",
        "History": "Baerann created many \"court dances,\" popular among the nobles and the upper-crust societies throughout the [[Heartlands]] of [[Faer√ªn]]. His compositions were complex pieces of swelling music that regularly stopped for a mere beat before continuing on in a swirl of fantastic and bombastic melodies, only to stop and continue over and over again."
