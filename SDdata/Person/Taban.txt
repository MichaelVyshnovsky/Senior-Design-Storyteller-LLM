'''Taban''' was a [[gladiator]] active in [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was stubborn but proud. If defeated in a fight, he became ashamed and eager to prove himself. He was also a gambler who placed bets at Port Nyanzaru's [[Executioner's Run]].

==Relationships==
As a result of his gambling habit, Taban came to owe a debt of 500 [[gp]] to a [[bookie]] named [[K'lahu]]. Despite having enough wealth to pay off his debt (in the form of [[gemstone]]s), Taban refused to repay it. During the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} K'lahu sought to hire [[adventurer]]s to help collect the debt.
