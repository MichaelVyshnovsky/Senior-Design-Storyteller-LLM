Adolmus was a human priest.
He loved the mountains and stones of Toril, and detested everything that could fly.
Adolmus wore a cloak of protection, and carried a magic mace and a wand of defoliation. He also wore a ring of fire resistance and a ring of earth elemental command on his fingers.
Adolmus helped defeat two dragons on separate occasions, a fact of which he was very proud.
