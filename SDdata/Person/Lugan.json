        "mainbody": "Assistant Lugan was a scholar of the arcane arts who lived in Neverwinter during the late 15 century DR.\nLugan studied how magic changed in the years following the Spellplague of the late 14 century.\nIn the , Lugan spent his time at an old fountain near the Fallen Tower tavern in the River District of Neverwinter. There he examined the residual energy that emanated from the ruined mages tower. He wished to investigate closer, but the occupying Many-Arrows orcs blocked the route to the upper level, so he contacted a wizard adventurer to collaborate on this research project. The wizard passed the orcs, entered the upper tower, fell into heart and met the ghost of the archmage Ricven.\nLugan was excited to learn that Ricven taught the wizard the old cantrip ghost sound and that while the Weave was greatly damaged and fractured, there were areas in Faer√ªn where it was still intact enough for the casting of such spells that pre-dated the Spellplague. Having an old map of arcane power concentrations, Lugan theorized the Weave would be stable enough in these places to test the cantrip and asked the adventurer to find these places and do so.\nDuring this, the adventurer discovered a few old spellbooks looted by the orcs from the Cloak Tower. Lugan eagerly collected these and promised to annotate them."
