        "mainbody": "Assistant '''Lugan''' was a scholar of the [[arcane arts]] who lived in [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Lugan studied how [[magic]] changed in the years following the [[Spellplague]] of the late 14{{th}} century.",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Lugan spent his time at an old fountain near the [[Fallen Tower]] tavern in the [[Neverwinter/River District|River District]] of Neverwinter. There he examined the residual energy that emanated from the ruined mage's tower. He wished to investigate closer, but the occupying [[Many-Arrows]] [[orc]]s blocked the route to the upper level, so he contacted a [[wizard]] [[adventurer]] to collaborate on this research project. The wizard passed the orcs, entered the upper tower, fell into heart and met the [[ghost]] of the [[archmage]] [[Ricven]].\n\nLugan was excited to learn that Ricven taught the wizard the old [[cantrip]] ''[[ghost sound]]'' and that while the [[Weave]] was greatly damaged and fractured, there were areas in [[Faer√ªn]] where it was still intact enough for the casting of such [[spell]]s that pre-dated the Spellplague. Having an old map of arcane power concentrations, Lugan theorized the Weave would be stable enough in these places to test the cantrip and asked the adventurer to find these places and do so.\n\nDuring this, the adventurer discovered a few old [[spellbook]]s looted by the orcs from the [[Cloak Tower]]. Lugan eagerly collected these and promised to annotate them."
