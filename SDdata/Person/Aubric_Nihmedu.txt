Blademajor Aubric Nihmedu was a well-respected citizen of Evereska that served as one of the Swords of Evereska as of the late 14 century DR.
The senior Nihmedu was a devoted father and brave warrior that remained wholly dedicated to the preservation of Evereska.
In his younger years Aubric joined the ranks of the bladesingers, fabled elven warriors that perfectly joined the disciplines of arcane magic and warcraft.
He was able to speak in "peeptalk" with small birds, such as Manynests a messenger for Lord Erlan Duirsar.
Aubric led the Swords of Evereska as a whole, along with the Noble Swords branch that served alongside the Lordly Wands commanded by Artmaster Rhydwych Bourmay.
He helped train and educate Evereskas younger soldiers at the citys College of Arms.
Aubric had two children, Keya and Galaeron, the latter of whom was a soldier of the Tomb Guard. 
On Nightal 30 in the , Aubric and his fellow Swords joined in a battle at Rocnest between the Evereskan elves and the recently-released phaerimm and their armies. Along with Armaster Bourmay, the Blademajor expertly navigated the battlefield until they encountered the group of high mages that were in the process of forming a portal to allow the Waterdhavian army to bypass the Deadwall that the phaerimm established around the Shaeradim. Due to the valiant efforts of Aubric, Rhydwych, and the fellow Swords, along with the timely assistance of the chosen Khelben Arunsun, the high mages were able to complete the portal. During the battle however, Aubric suffered grevious wounds. He gave his life in service of Evereska, fighting one last time in the bladesinging art as he did in his youth.
