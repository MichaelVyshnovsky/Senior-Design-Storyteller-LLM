'''Lantana Duskeyes''' was a resistance fighter inhabiting the city of [[Kzelter]] in the [[Lake of Steam]] region during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Lantana's father was an [[adventurer]] who died fighting the [[Banite]] incursion into the region. Since her father's death, she devoted her life to running an underground resistance to the Banites in and around Kzelter. Many followers who she recruited lost family members to the Banites. Since most of Lantana's group consisted of farmers, the success of their activity was limited mostly to supply raids and occasionly setting fire to Banite solider tents.
