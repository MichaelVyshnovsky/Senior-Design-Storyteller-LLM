'''Charlice Churlgo''' was one of many children of [[Millie Churlgo]] who produced the infamous [[Churlgo Cheese]] in the [[Eastern Farmlands]] of [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

{{quote|Old socks with a hint of mold... lovely! Something's missing though.|Charlice Churlgo}}

==Description==
Charlice Churlgo was a hardworking and diligent worker who often nibbled on the cheese she produced.

==History==
Charlice worked from the inside of the farmhouse where she along with other family members kept an eye on the cheese-filled vats and taste-tested the product, making sure it was up to the Churlgo quality standards.

Charlice, along with other Churlgos moved their farm from the [[Dalelands]] to [[Daggerford]] following a nasty extortion business with the [[Iron Throne]]. In 1372 DR, the farm where they resided was still noticeably un-lived-in, but the cheese-making business was in full swing.
