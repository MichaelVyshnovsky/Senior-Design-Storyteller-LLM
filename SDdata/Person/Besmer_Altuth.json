        "mainbody": "Besmer Altuth was a criminal in Scornubel during the mid-14 century DR.\nBesmer came to possess a wand of fireballs that required no sorcerous knowledge to activate.\nBesmer worked in Scornubel under Belgon Bradaskor, the Master of Shadows.\nBesmers work for Belgon often earned him a few coppers or a silver coin.\nBesmer attempted to jump Sharantyr in late , only to find her turning the tables on him. Rather than killing him, she demanded to be taken to be seen to the Master of Shadows, Belgon Bradaskor, introducing herself as Tessaril Winter instead of as herself. Besmer tried to lead her to an alley which she refused, so instead he offered the trip through either Rat Stair or Baluths Hole. She chose Baluths Hole. He was released only at the last moment, right before Sharantyr was able to meet Belgon she gave him a handful of gold pieces for his trouble, more to make sure he was treated as a traitor than out of gratitude.\nDays later, Besmer stole a unique wand of fireballs that anyone could wield, firing fireballs rather at will from a merchant, slaying him in the process. The mans guards chased after Besmer for a long time he was not caught until he attempted to use the wand against the ghost of Evaereol Rathrane, who had been attracted by the wands power. Rather than take damage from the fireball, the phantom drank of its charges, leaving Besmer defenseless against the guards who found him shortly after.\nSharantyr was sure he would be killed for aiding her."
