        "Activities": "Besmer's work for Belgon often earned him a few coppers or a silver coin.",
        "History": "Besmer attempted to jump [[Sharantyr]] in late {{yearlink|1357}}, only to find her turning the tables on him. Rather than killing him, she demanded to be taken to be seen to the Master of Shadows, [[Belgon Bradaskor]], introducing herself as [[Tessaril Winter]] instead of as herself. Besmer tried to lead her to an alley which she refused, so instead he offered the trip through either [[Rat Stair]] or [[Baluth's Hole]]. She chose Baluth's Hole. He was released only at the last moment, right before Sharantyr was able to meet Belgon; she gave him a handful of [[gold piece]]s for his trouble, more to make sure he was treated as a traitor than out of gratitude.\n\nDays later, Besmer stole a unique [[wand of fireballs]] that anyone could wield, firing fireballs rather at will from a merchant, slaying him in the process. The man's guards chased after Besmer for a long time; he was not caught until he attempted to use the wand against the ghost of [[Evaereol Rathrane]], who had been attracted by the wand's power. Rather than take damage from the fireball, the phantom drank of its charges, leaving Besmer defenseless against the guards who found him shortly after.",
