'''Lassratha Nalorth''' was the High Rider, or commander, of the [[Yevven Riders]] in [[Yeshpek]] along the [[Lake of Steam]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref name=EotSS-p167">

==Personality==
Lassratha's bloodthirsty nature was matched by her menacing {{SI|7'|ft-in}} frame. She had raven-black hair and was rumored to sleep in her [[armor]].<ref name=EotSS-p167"/>

==Activities==
She dreamt of leading Yeshpek's forces in victory over [[Suldolphor]] and even [[Calimshan]], making her city truly free. She realized this was likely an unobtainable fantasy, but kept her troops in top fighting shape regardless.<ref name=EotSS-p167"/>
