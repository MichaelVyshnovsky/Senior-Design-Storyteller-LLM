        "mainbody": "nilloc was an adventuring wizard who lived some time in the 13 century by Dalereckoning.\nSnilloc gained fame among his fellow wizards by developing several cold-based evocations and fame more generally when he helped save Procampur from a horde of hobgoblins.\nRumor had it that Snilloc spent his final years living in Zakhara.\nSnilloc was the inventor of three known spells in the Realms, Snillocs snowball, Snillocs snowball swarm and Snillocs major missile, as well as a rumored fourth, Snillocs cream pie. There also existed a path of power based on Snillocs magic, a so-called lost path which was not publicly known.\nIf Snillocs personality indeed came through in his writings, then he was apparently a patronizing and overly self-confident individual.\nSnilloc was one of several powerful mages that were mortified and infuriated when some of their spells were published in Volos Guide to All Things Magical. He was heard to say that Volothamp Geddarm deserved to lose his head after spending \"most of eternity as a dung beetle crushed under a rock at the bottom of a cesspool.\""
