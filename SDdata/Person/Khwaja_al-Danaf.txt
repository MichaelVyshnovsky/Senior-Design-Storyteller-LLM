Khwaja al-Danaf was the head of the House of Al-Danafi merchant family in Huzuz in 1367 DR, though he was more of a figurehead because his wife, Perijan was the real reason for their success.
Khwaja was a middle-aged man who dressed in fine cloth often sewn with pearls.
The patriarch busied himself with expanding his empire and finding new seaborne trade routes, especially to the countries found north of Zakhara.
Khwaja began his career in trade with a failed business in Gana. A dream revealed him traveling to Jumlat and discovering a horde of wealth, so he promptly sailed to the distant city.
Upon his arrival he overheard a pair of saluks planning to rob a wealthy merchants home. Trusting in Fate, Khwaja decided to join the thieves. He fell and broke his leg while scaling the outer wall to the merchants home. His screams from the pain alerted the household and his companions abandoned him to his fate.
When taken before a qadi for judgment, Khwaja was granted leniency after relating his story of his dream. The qadi laughed at his story but related one of his own dreams regarding a chest of gold buried near a fountain decorated with griffons. Khwajas home in Gana had a fountain that matched this description, so when his leg was healed he traveled back home and happened to find a large chest of gold buried under the fountain.
Perijan helped Khwaja invest their newfound fortune, eventually creating a large trading empire for the family.
Tanya was Khwajas daughter.
