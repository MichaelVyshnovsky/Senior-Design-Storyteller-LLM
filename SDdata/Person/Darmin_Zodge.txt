Captain '''Darmin Zodge''' was an officer of the [[Flaming Fist]] who was stationed in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
While he presented himself as an earnest, dutiful soldier, Zodge was actually a self-centered and opportunistic individual. Despite his lack of concern for others, he did genuinely care for the welfare of the soldiers under his command.

==History==
When [[Grand Duke]] [[Ulder Ravengard|Ravengard]] disappeared along with the city of [[Elturel]], in the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} Zodge was tasked with handling the great many refugees that swarmed to Baldur's Gate. He saw the crisis as an opportunity to take charge of the Flaming Fist army.
