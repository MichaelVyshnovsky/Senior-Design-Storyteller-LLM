He kept his head clean-shaven.\nBy the , Dizby was already thought to be old. His age and pessimistic outlook brought some mockery from his fellow sailors, who believed him to be a doom-sayer. Dizby was made quartermaster by Captain Harfang in or just before 1492 DR. This assignment disgruntled one of the Lustrous Lasss crew members â€“ Jorkens, who wanted the position for himself. During the ships anchorage at the Crone Island, the disgruntled sailor made a deal with the island hag, who, to no surprise, turned the deal against the entire crew of the Lass and a the same time, another deal was made by Captain Harfang. The captain was granted \"enough gold to last the rest of her life,\" but soon enough, the sailor realized that the bag of gold contained only six real gold coins among the dross. As soon as she tossed the false gold aboard, the Captain came down with deadly sea plague that ended the lives of the entire crew in a bit over a tenday after the deal was made.\nThe bodies of the dead were left aboard the Lustrous Lass and quarantined, after she drifted into the harbors of Baldurs Gate."
