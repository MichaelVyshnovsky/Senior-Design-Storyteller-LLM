Haedyll was a halfling cleric of Eldath from the Thornwood.
Haedyll had bright, blue eyes, brown hair, and a pug nose. He dressed in white clothes, and wore a golden necklace with red gemstones.
He was known as a calm and harmonious person.
Haedyll owned a pair of boots of levitation.
He had at least one brother.The description on Haedylls card says "he and a brother traveled to Silverymoon", which implies he had additional siblings.
While traversing the Evermoors en route to Silverymoon, Haedyll and his brother came under attack. His brother was struck by an arrow and died, and Haedyll tried desperately to scrounge up enough gold to pay for both his resurrection, and their return home.
