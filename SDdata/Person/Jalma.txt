'''Jalma''' was a female [[elf]] in the 1350s [[DR]] who lived near [[Waterdeep]].

Jalma lived in a small house with two other elven women.

In the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], they provided lodging for the night to [[Cybriana]] of [[Shadowdale]], who was journeying to [[Waterdeep]]. That night, [[chasme]] broke into their house and attacked, carrying away all four women, under orders from [[Imgig Zu]] to seize magic-users. Although Cybriana was rescued, Jalma and her sisters were taken to Imgig Zu's tower to be tested for magical ability in a spell-battle with the [[drow]] woman [[Kilili]].

Jalma had red-brown hair and wore a purple dress.{{Cite comic/The Gathering|8-10, 13}}
