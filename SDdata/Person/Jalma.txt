Jalma was a female elf in the 1350s DR who lived near Waterdeep.
Jalma lived in a small house with two other elven women.
In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, they provided lodging for the night to Cybriana of Shadowdale, who was journeying to Waterdeep. That night, chasme broke into their house and attacked, carrying away all four women, under orders from Imgig Zu to seize magic-users. Although Cybriana was rescued, Jalma and her sisters were taken to Imgig Zus tower to be tested for magical ability in a spell-battle with the drow woman Kilili.
Jalma had red-brown hair and wore a purple dress.
