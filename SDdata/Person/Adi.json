        "mainbody": "Adi was a female shu of the Jengi tribe who lived on the Malatran Plateau on the shores of the Lake of Giant Flies in the late 14 century DR.\nLike other shu of the Jengi village, Adi was shy and wary of visitors from other tribes. Even those outsiders who proved themselves were not accepted by Adi and her tribe. However, shu showed no fear of the visitors.\nIn the Year of Gathering Darkness, Malatran calendar, sinister earth tremors shook the Living Jungle. The shu Jengi tribe was hit hard by the disaster. The tribes witch doctor, Kumon Ubok, was badly hurt, and a collection of his spell fetishes unleaded waves of wild magci. A tree sprung out of nowhere in the village and dragged unwitting shu  feet into the air as it grew. Adi was among six terrified shu who ended up dangling off the massive tree. Adis fate was unrecorded. However, a group of heroes of the Living Jungle came to the Jengi tribes aid."
