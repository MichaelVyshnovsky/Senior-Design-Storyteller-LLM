'''Borigon Hillsafar''' was the king of [[Clan Hillsafar]] in [[Vaasa]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|79}}

==History==
In {{YearlinkName|1470}}, the [[Warlock Knights of Vaasa]] invaded [[Hillsafar Hall]]. Borigon assumed command, taking on the mantle of king, and repelled the invaders. Afterward, he welcomed inside the Hall a handful of neighboring clans displaced during the war, and with great reluctance, ordered the gates to be closed and sealed. As of {{YearlinkName|1470}}, the gates were still closed.

==Relationship==
Borigon was the third son of [[Garumbelly Hillsafar]].
