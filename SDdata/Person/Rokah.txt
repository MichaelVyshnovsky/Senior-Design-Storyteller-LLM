'''Rokah''' was a [[Zhentarim]] [[spy]] active in [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He had connections to [[Flask of Wine]] and [[River Mist]], a pair of [[tabaxi]] [[jungle guide]]s.

==History==
During the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} Rokah's Zhentarim handlers became aware of an alliance between the [[Flaming Fist]] at [[Fort Beluarian]] and the pirates at [[Jahaka Anchorage]]. Rokah was tasked with infiltrating Fort Beluarian and acquiring proof of this arrangement with which to blackmail the fort's commander, [[Liara Portyr]]. To achieve this, he sought to hire [[adventurer]]s to escort him from Port Nyanzaru to the fort and then to create a distraction that would allow him to search Portyr's private quarters.
