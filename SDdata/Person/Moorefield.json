        "mainbody": "'''Moorefield''' was the butler of Lord [[Partic Thistle]], and served him faithfully at his estate at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Moorefield was a tall, thin man with a pointy nose and thinning black hair. He dressed in a fine black-and-white outfit with white gloves.",
        "Personality": "The butler had a haughty, polite manner, and was a master of etiquette and decorum. He found adventurers to be boorish folk.",
        "Possessions": "Moorefield wore ''[[bracers of defense]]'' and had a magical silver baton for the unlikely event that he was personally involved in fighting. His duties were aided by a ''[[keychain of domestic propriety]]''.",
        "Activities": "As butler, Moorefield was responsible for the domestic maintenance of Thistleflame, as well as controlling the keys to all the doors. He kept the security of the keys paramount, barely even trusting them to other employees.",
        "Relationships": "Moorefield was the closest confidant of Lord Thistle, entrusted with his secrets and personal business. He had an abiding love for Lord Thistle, and would never betray him through intent or carelessness.\n\nHe had a good friendship with the maid [[Larwyn]], and partook in a competition with her to see who could be the more efficient servant. Gossip in the Manor speculated that they were lovers.",
        "History": "Moorefield left [[Zhentil Keep]] for [[Cormyr]] in [[1329 DR]], and began working for Lord Thistle in [[1349 DR]]. He used his knowledge of Zhentish customs to aid Lord Thistle in his work with adventuring companies.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], he discovered the apparent murder of Lord Thistle, and assisted in investigating the matter. It came to light that Lord Thistle had actually been kidnapped and was soon recovered, much to Moorefield's relief."
