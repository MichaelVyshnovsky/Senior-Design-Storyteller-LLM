However, Tambourine himself showed little interest in pest control or any other vocation. Those who knew mundane or magical ways of talking to animals quickly realized that the lazy cat possessed a self-important attitude, thinking it to be the monarch of the tavern and all humanoids its subservient apes. The cat would also attempt to order said \"apes\" to dispose of the rats in Elfsongs basement."
