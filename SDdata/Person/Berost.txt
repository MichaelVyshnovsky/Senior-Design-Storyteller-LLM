Berost was a man-at-arms of Shadowdale in the mid-14 century DR.
While escorting Shandril Shessair, he seemed to be on the guard for the Art.
In late mid-, Berost was one of the men-at-arms accompanying Shandril Shessair and Narm Tamaraith to Storm Silverhands home. There, he drew his sword at the sound of a harp playing by itself, only to be shushed by a veteran fellow.
