Procampur, the Vast
Lord Dawn Lurian was an infant noble of House Lurian in the city of Procampur in the Vast in the late 14 century DR.
She was the twin brother of Richard Lurian.While several members of House Lurian are known, most of their relationships are unknown Richard and Dawn may be the children of any of the adult members. They are presumed to be twins because they are listed together and have the same age, though this may be a coincidence.
She was aged 18 months in 1370 DR.
