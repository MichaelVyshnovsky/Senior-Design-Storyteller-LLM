        "mainbody": "Mamun al-Garib was the chief vizier for the sheikh of the House of Dhib in the High Desert of west Zakhara around 1367 DR.\nThough he commanded genies and jann, Mamun would never dare question a ruling from Sheikh Anwat al-Makkar, whom he admired and feared.\nIn addition to advising his sheikh, Mamun was a skilled shair in his own right.\nMamun was actually the grandson of the sheikhs first vizier."
