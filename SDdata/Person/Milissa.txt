'''Milissa''' was a [[peacewoman]] of [[Eldath]] who worked as a swimming instructor in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, she was a stunningly beautiful [[human]] [[priestess]] in her early twenties with blue eyes,  slightly longer than shoulder-length blonde hair, and tan skin. Milissa was {{SI|5'8|'"|long=yes}} tall and weighed {{SI|120|lb|k|long=yes}}. She often wore flowing [[robe]]s of green and blur.

==Personality==
Typically for people of her profession, Milissa did not enjoy conflict and never initiated battle and entered the fray only to defend her friends and loved ones. She greatly enjoyed paying to Eldath and preaching her dogma while at the seashore.

==Abilities==
Milissa was fluent in [[Common]] and [[Elvish]] languages. She wielded [[club]]s, [[staves]], [[sling]]s, and was highly proficient in swimming, healing, and weather sense. As a cleric, she could cast any divine spell from the [[charm]] school of magic and such [[spell]]s as ''[[remove fear]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', and ''[[silence]]''. Like other [[Eldathyn]] clergy, Milissa was a master of parrying and avoiding being attacked when in battle.

==History==
Milissa was a member of a wealthy family of landowners just outside of Ravens Bluff. Early in her life, she entered priestly training with the [[Church of Eldath]]. She showed talent, and long before she turned 22, Milissa became a fully-ordained [[cleric]] of Eldath, after which she joined an adventuring band as a traveling preacher of peace. The priestess quickly grew dissatisfied with adventuring life filled with battle and conflict, which disgusted her. She quit, returning back home.

Sometime later, when Milissa was 21, she encountered a young couple at one of her sermons. The youths asked the priestess to teach them to swim. Milissa agreed, and the number of students grew swiftly. She was later joined by her adventuring friend [[Morris]] as a fellow swimming instructor. Together they began running the swimming school part-time in Ravens Bluff's docks, hoping to save enough coin to build a Temple to Eldath in Ravens Bluff, not far from the harbors. [[Deena (Ravens Bluff)|Deena]] was one of Milissa's students who, eventually, joined her as a fellow teacher.

Milissa's teaching area could be found near a sign that read "Dive Right In" and "The Water is Just Fine." The priestess accepted creatures of any race to be taught basic swimming and more advanced techniques. Each lesson began with a short Eldathyn sermon of peace and serenity.
