'''Edwin Carrathal II''' was High King of [[Callidyrr]] for a brief time in the early-to-mid 12{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|33}} Like his predecessors, although he held the title of High King of the [[Moonshae Isles]], he was considered to be merely a figurehead by the [[Ffolk]] outside of Callidyrr.

==Relationships==
He was a member of the [[Carrathal Dynasty]]. Edwin II was the first son of his mother and predecessor, [[Bethany Carrathal|Queen Bethany]], and had been named for her father, [[Edwin Carrathal I]]. He and his wife, [[Eleanor Carrathal|Queen Eleanor]], had one son, [[Adrian Carrathal|Adrian]], who would eventually succeed him as king.

==History==
Edwin II assumed the throne in the {{YearlinkName|1133}}, following the death of his mother. Only [[1135 DR|two years later]], he died while on a tour of an [[iron]] mine near [[Whiterock]]. Since his sole heir, Adrian, was only a child, Queen Eleanor named King [[Adom Kimball]] of [[Moray]] as regent of Callidyrr for the following six years.
