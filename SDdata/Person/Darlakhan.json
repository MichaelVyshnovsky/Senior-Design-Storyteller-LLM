        "mainbody": "Darlakhan was a Sharran faithful during the midâ€“8 century DR.\nHe was eager to serve Shar and was ambitious.\nHe had noticeable ritual scarring on his forearms, and when in ritual, he wore a mantle of shards between his legs, drawing blood with every step.\nHe had temple tasks in the House of Holy Night.\nDarlakhan was called into the heart of the House of Holy Night by Dread Sister Klalaera in what he believed was the prelude to his promotion to a position of power. Instead, he was used as a human sacrifice by the clerics who had Dasumia, an avatar of Mystra, bound."
