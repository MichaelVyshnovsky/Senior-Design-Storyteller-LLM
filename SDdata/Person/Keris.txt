Keris was a half-elf tavern owner inhabiting the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid–14 century DR.
Keris owned the River, a tavern with the finest reputation in the city that was located in the western section of Zhentil Keeps Foreign Quarter on Teshwave Street. He was a well-dressed conman who won the River from its previous owner. Despite his devious nature, Keris took great pride in ensuring the safety of his patrons while they were under his roof. Keris also provided services as a fence, working out of his private office. A trapdoor was located in his office in case he needed to make a quick getaway. If that failed he could always rely on his ring of teleportation.
He employed a dozen serving wenches, and four serving boys, all of whom were willing to provide "extra services" to guests.
Keris was an adventurer before he decided to settle in Zhentil Keep.
