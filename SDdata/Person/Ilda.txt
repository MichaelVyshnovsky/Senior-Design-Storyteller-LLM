Ilda was a scholar and apprentice to the powerful mage Diderius that was forced to linger in undeath for years until at least the late 15 century DR.
As a ghost, Ilda was erratic and obviously quite anguished by her "failures" in life. She only became violent against those that attempted to steal from Diderius ruined manse.
Ilda absolutely revered her master Diderius.
One day during her apprenticeship, Ilda was banished from her masters estate when it was believed that she stole one of his most prized tomes, Transubstantiality across Potentialities. Soon after Diderius death, Ilda passed away herself. Her spirit returned in ghostly form within his study determined to preserve and protect all that remained of his collection. It still remained there as of the 1480s DR.
