'''Ilda''' was a scholar and apprentice to the powerful [[mage]] [[Diderius]] that was forced to linger in [[undeath]] for years until at least the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
As a ghost, Ilda was erratic and obviously quite anguished by her "failures" in life. She only became violent against those that attempted to steal from [[Tomb of Diderius|Diderius' ruined manse]].

==Relationships==
Ilda absolutely revered her master Diderius.

==History==
One day during her apprenticeship, Ilda was banished from her master's estate when it was believed that she stole one of his most prized [[tome]]s, ''[[Transubstantiality across Potentialities]]''. Soon after Diderius' death, Ilda passed away herself. Her spirit returned in [[ghost]]ly form within his study determined to preserve and protect all that remained of his collection. It still remained there as of the 1480s DR.{{ToD-time}}
