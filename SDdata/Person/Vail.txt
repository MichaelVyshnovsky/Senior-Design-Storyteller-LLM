'''Vail''' was an [[elven]] mercenary who lived in the Realms during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Vail had something of a silver tongue, readily offering praise and flattery to others.

==Possessions==
During his travels, Vail managed to track down some [[artifact]]s belonging to the famous explorer [[Balduran]], acquiring both the ''[[helm of Balduran|helm]]'' and the ''[[cloak of Balduran]]''.

==Relationships==
Vail had a lover by the name of [[Quenash]], who worked as a courtesan in Baldur's Gate.

==History==
Some time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Vail was hired by the mage [[Degrodel]] to raid the [[Ramazith's tower|tower]] of [[Ramazith Flamesinger]]. He gathered together some allies: the warrior [[Rance]] and the [[conjurer]] [[Faizah Tin]], along with two newcomers to their group, [[Cailan]] and [[Achen Dell]].

However, Ramazith set a [[basilisk]] loose upon the mercenaries, which then proceeded to turn [[petrification|each of the intruders to stone]]. Vail and his companions remained as statues, before they were sold to the nobleman art collector [[Felonius Gist]]. They remained at his estate in Baldur's Gate.
