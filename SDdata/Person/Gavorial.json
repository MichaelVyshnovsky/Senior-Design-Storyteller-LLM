        "History": "In [[1366 DR]], when Princess [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] returned to Castle Hartwick after her abduction, Gavorial attempted to arrest her and bring her to the [[Twilight Spirit]]; however, [[Tavis Burdun]] aimed an arrow at Brianna and threatened to kill her rather than allow Gavorial to take her. Since Gavorial knew that the Twilight Spirit had no use for a dead princess, he instead departed.",
