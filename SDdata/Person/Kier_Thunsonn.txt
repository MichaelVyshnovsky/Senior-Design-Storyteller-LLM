'''Kier Thunsonn''' was a male [[dwarf]] who lived in [[Eartheart]] near the [[East Rift]]. He was [[Torrin Ironstar]]'s adopted nephew and was very close to Torrin.

==History==
In [[1480 DR]], Kier stole a [[griffon]] and flew it to an [[earthmote]] hovering over the rift. Inside the mote, he found a cache of gold bars.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|821}} Unfortunately, the bars were contaminated with the [[stoneplague]], which Kier contracted. In order to save Kier's life, Torrin bought [[magic|magical]] ointment that placed Kier into suspended animation until the stoneplague curse could be lifted.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|2413}}

Torrin was killed destroying the [[duergar]] magic that caused the stoneplague. However, many years later, [[Moradin]] reincarnated Torrin's soul and he was re-born as Kier's son.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|4441}}
