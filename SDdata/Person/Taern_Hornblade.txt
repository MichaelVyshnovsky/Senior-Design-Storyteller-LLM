'''Taern "Thunderspells" Hornblade''' was the High Mage of the city of [[Silverymoon]], having succeeded [[Alustriel]] when she took the office of High Lady, and member of the [[Council of the Marches]].

{{quote|''Show me Alustriel's will, and I'll firmly label it the right way — for so it is, and can only continue to be.''|Taern speaking before the [[Council of the Marches]]}}

==Description==
Taern was tall and gray-bearded, appearing grave and thoughtful most of the time.

==Personality==
Although reckless in his youth, in his later years Taern preferred to avoid confrontations. By striving for consensus where possible and working hard at building friendships, Taern tended to reach decisions through alliance with others.

==Abilities==
A powerful Evoker, Taern's nickname, "Thunderspell", was earned during his early [[Magefair]] duels where his mastery of potent battle-[[spell]]s became known.

==Relationships==
Taern had a deep and abiding love of [[Alustriel]].

==Possessions==
Taern's signature weapon was his namesake [[longsword]] ''[[Hornblade (longsword)|Hornblade]]'', which is a famous and heavily enchanted blade. It had a number of magical properties that are extremely useful to Taern, as well as being a potent weapon in its own right. It had the ''[[sending]]'' ability, allowing messages to be sent to multiple recipients; the power to store two spells within it, rather that one; and an attunement with the ward initiates if Silverymoon, requiring their grasp to function correctly.

Taern had a rat [[familiar]] called Vesk.

==History==
Born in [[1204 DR]]{{cite web| url = http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=15988&whichpage=43| title = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2012)| accessdate = 2013-12-19| accessmonthday = Dec 19| accessyear = 2013| author = The Hooded One| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2012-08-30| year = 2012| month = 08| format = 30| work = | publisher = | pages = 43| language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = }}<ref group="note">Although [[The Grand History of the Realms]] lists Taern's date of birth as [[1304 DR]] this date conflicts with other works which cite Taern as being active prior to then. Most notably the founding of the Spellguard of Silverymoon in [[1255 DR]], which Taern was famously responsible for. In Ed's Candlekeep responses he points out the discrepancies of Taern's exacting birth. From these two sources we can see that the Grand History is either a misprint or merely the 'public', rather than true, birthdate of Taern. Hence this article has settled on [[1204 DR]] as a compromise. Feel free to discuss this in the [[Talk:Taern Hornblade|talk page]]. Taern earned his nickname, "Thunderspell", early in his life from attending magefair duels and showcasing his deadly battle-spells. He is also a longtime member of the [[Harpers]].

Taern founded the [[Spellguard|Spellguard of Silverymoon]] in [[1255 DR]] as a bodyguard unit to protect Alustriel.

In [[1361 DR]], Taern and Alustriel defeated two [[archmages]] of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that had arrived outside Silverymoon. However while Alustriel was drawn away from the city, Taern and his Spellguard were forced to battle a [[Dracolich]] that had assaulted the southern walls.

Sometime before [[1372 DR]], Thunderspell created ''[[cloak of protection versus chaos|cloaks of protection versus chaos]]'' in preparation to defending his home, Silverymoon, from an army of deadly and chaotic orcish army. Many of these cloaks were given out to the defenders of the city, its [[ranger]]s and [[fighter]]s. With years passing, many of these [[enchanted]] cloaks found their way into many places along the [[Sword Coast]].

Before taking over the supreme office of the city he was the leader of the [[Spellguard|Spellguard of Silverymoon]].

During the 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} the leader of [[Luruar]] [[Methrammar Aerasumé]] sent Taern, who remained in good health thanks to ''[[potion of longevity|potions of longevity]]'', as his delegate at the [[Council of Waterdeep]], formed to deal with the emergent [[Cult of the Dragon]]. Methrammar selected Taern for his high diplomatic skills.

==Activities==
Hornblade sat as a Peer on the Council of the Marches representing Silverymoon, though he followed Alustriel's wishes whenever they were expressed.
