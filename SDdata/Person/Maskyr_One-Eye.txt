'''Maskyr''' ({{Pronounce|MAH|skeer|refs={{Cite polyhedron/54/The Everwinking Eye: Elminster's Guide to the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting|16-17}}

==Personality==
Maskyr was said to be an archmage of great patience, having learned to be in his many years questing for and experimenting with magic.

==Possessions==
He possessed a ''[[staff of power]]''.

==History==
Maskyr was already a powerful archmage when he came to explore the newly opened Vast in the 7{{th}} century DR, seeking a place well beyond human affairs where he could build himself a tower. Dwarves ruled the Vast and orcs and [[goblinoid]]s were driven out and quiet, while [[ogre]]s dominated [[Thar]] beyond the [[Moonsea]] to the north. Thus, humans were few in number north of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], bar a few bold and cautious folk who came to explore and settle, as Maskyr did.

One morning in the [[645 DR|Year of the Costly Gift, 645 DR]], in the very northern end of the Vast, Maskyr came upon a wooded vale that he found quite beautiful, veiled in mountain mists and most serene. He decided to make his home there, and nowhere else.

But it was already claimed by the kingdom of Roldilar. Maskyr therefore went to [[Mount Grimmerfang]] to seek audience with [[Deep King]] [[Tuir Stonebeard]] and asked his price for the vale. The Roldilarren Court fell silent but Maskyr waited patiently, quietly leaning on his staff and meeting the king's gaze, as Tuir thought it over. Tuir did not want to yield any land to any human, particular wizards whom he distrusted, but he feared the archmage's power. At last, he made his offer: "The vale is yours, from rim to rim and beneath the grass as deep as four men stand upon each other's shoulders, so long as ye dig so as to remain within the valley's borders, upon one condition only. Pluck out thy right eye and give it to me, here and now, and the vale is thine." To the shock of all present, without hesitation, Maskyr did just that. Tuir respected Maskyr for that deed, having thought that no-one would ever do it. He kept the bargain and granted him the land. He also ordered that no dwarf trespass in the vale nor disturb the archmage. Maskyr then went and dwelled there, erecting [[Maskyr's Tower]] for his home.

Others followed, and this marked the beginning of permanent human settlement in the Vast.

Maskyr, meanwhile, lived peacefully and alone in his tower in his vale for several centuries. Finally, he went on a journey to the [[planes]] and disappeared, and was presumed to have been slain.{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|26}} Elminster declared this to be false, however.

===Legacy===
In time, [[adventurer]]s who'd heard of Maskyr and his deal with Tuir, and of his supposed absence, came to Maskyr's Tower to explore or plunder. Yet its wards proved impenetrable, so they left with nothing. Eventually, one retired adventurer of Maskyr's Eye named [[Gathen Swiftsword]] hired a crew to simply tunnel through the walls. They succeeded, sighted many oddities, Gathen was never seen again, and the tower exploded as a [[dragon]] burst out of it and flew away.{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|27}} That was all anyone knew, except for the thief [[Khonduil Ammargath]], who was part of Gathen's expedition, knew the truth of what happened within the tower, and escaped alive with Maskyr's ''staff of power''. The mage [[Loathren]] of [[Phlan]] planned to build a new tower on the site, but was killed when rocks rose up and fell on his camp, and a fear of a curse on the place spread.

By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Maskyr and his tower were long gone with only his name and legend surviving. His name lived on in [[Maskyr's Eye]], the name given to the vale and the village there; in [[The Wizard's Hand]] inn in the village;

==Rumors & Legends==
Despite the destruction of his tower, local tales maintained Maskyr had had much treasure and mighty magic and that it could still be concealed somewhere nearby. Yet there was also a warning, that Maskyr the One-Eyed would someday return and hunt down all those who had taken from him, even a single [[copper piece]].
