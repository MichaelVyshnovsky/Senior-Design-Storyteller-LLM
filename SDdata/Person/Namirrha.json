        "mainbody": "Namirrha was a necromancer and a member of the Cult of the Dragon during the mid–14 century DR. He acted as the representative and negotiator for Malygris, the Blue Suzerain following his transformation to lichdom.\nHe was an older man, with wrinkled skin and balding hair.\nNamirrha wore an amulet of draconic might,While this variety of amulet is not given by name, its description both in the Siege and within in-universe excerpts of the Cult of the Dragon sourcebook correspond with the items description on page 80 of the latter book. which granted him direct control over Malygris.\nWhile Namirrha spent years courting Malygris for membership into the cults ranks, in the end he treated the powerful undead dragon as little more than an oversized undead minion.\nHe and his fellow Dragon Cult members held enmity towards the Zhentarim and desired that they be driven from the Anauroch desert.\nSome time during or before the , Namirrha appeared before Malygris and appeased him with a collection of sapphires and new spells with which the old blue dragon was not familiar. They formed a bargain that Malygris would assail any caravan that did not pay the cults tolls for crossing their territory in the desert.\nAfter a terrible battle with the dragon Sussethilasis in the , Malygris finally agreed to receive the \"Mightiest of Treasures\"—that is transformation into a dracolich—from Namirrha and his fellow cultists. With the aid of Namirrha and the cult, Malygris emerged as the ruler of much of Anaurochs blue dragons over the course of the next five years.\nLater in the , Namirrha ordered Malygris and his mate Verianthraxa to assault the Citadel of the Raven in response to Zhentarim raids on the cults holdings in Sembia. The ill-conceived raid was a failure. While Malygris survived and returned to Anauroch, the recently-transformed Verianthraxa was destroyed. Malygris was not the same after the death of his queen.\nOn Mirtul 9 in the , Malygris received a visit at his mountaintop lair from Brennus and Clariburnus Tanthul of Thultanthar. Namirrha arrived shortly after the Princes of Shade, investigating reports of lightning bolts being discharged from up high. The two princes sought an alliance with the Blue Suzerain and made an initial offering to appease him. They killed Namirrha for insulting the mighty blue dracolich by presuming to control him with what they viewed as some mere trinket."
