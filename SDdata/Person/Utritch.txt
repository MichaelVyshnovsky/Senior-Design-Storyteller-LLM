Utritch was a Red Wizard and an abjurer who participated in the assault on Myth Nantar in the late 15 century DR. She and Zoyas were charged with recruiting a community of locathah to join the forces of Thay in the battle. They used magic to disguise themselves as aquatic elves but were thwarted by the actions of adventurers working for the Nantarn Alliance.
