'''Cheg''' was a [[doppelganger]] member of the [[Unseen]] who disguised itself as the human '''Nool''', a Hand Leader and a member of the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] of [[Skullport]] in [[1370 DR]].

As Nool, he guided a squad of ten slavers in search of victims in [[Waterdeep]]'s slums and using his peculiar talents they usually had a good hunt.

As Cheg, his mission was to get near the [[Xanathar]] and discover his lair, in order for the Unseen to control him from afar and possibly assassinate the Xanathar at need.
