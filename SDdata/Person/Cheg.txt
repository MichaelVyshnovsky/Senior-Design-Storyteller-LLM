Cheg was a doppelganger member of the Unseen who disguised itself as the human Nool, a Hand Leader and a member of the Xanathar Thieves Guild of Skullport in 1370 DR.
As Nool, he guided a squad of ten slavers in search of victims in Waterdeeps slums and using his peculiar talents they usually had a good hunt.
As Cheg, his mission was to get near the Xanathar and discover his lair, in order for the Unseen to control him from afar and possibly assassinate the Xanathar at need.
