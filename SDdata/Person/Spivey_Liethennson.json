        "mainbody": "rand Scribe Spivey Liethennson was an elven priest of Oghma and the overseer of the House of Knowledge in Neverwinter toward the end of the 15 century DR.\nHe was the head priest presiding over both the temple and library at the House of Knowledge, and was described as iron-fisted in his leadership. He was fragile, both in body and in temperament, and his breathing was heavy and labored.\nWhile more of an administrator than a spellcaster, Liethennson was known to handle the removal of curses such as lycanthropy as part of his temple duties.\nLiethennson was highly demanding of his underlings, and was known to complain and nag constantly about any failures or shortcomings. He was quick to anger and rarely kind.\nLiethennson likely arrived in Neverwinter during the late 1480s DR when the Church of Oghma made a dedicated effort to send members of the clergy to restore the House of Knowledge, which had been badly damaged during the Ruining of 1451 DR. By the mid 1490s DR, he was in charge of the entire temple, and perhaps his most important role at this time was managing the reconstruction. By 1496 DR, the temples exterior walls were completely rebuilt, but work continued on the interior and the decor. During this time, his grating attitude caused Kollette Kwarter and her crew, the builders overseeing the reconstruction, to simply walk away from the project.\nGrand Scribe Liethennson was unhappy with his role at the House of Knowledge, and longed to retire to Candlekeep. He believed that being a strict disciplinarian was the only way to earn him the necessary prestige to get out of Neverwinter, and as such, he quickly became a terror to many of the acolytes."
