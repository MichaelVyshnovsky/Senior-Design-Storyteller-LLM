        "mainbody": "Iwna Thesk was an unfortunate priestess of Selûne from Glister who was accused of heresy.\nIwna and her sisters Fela and Iwna tended to the shrine at the then-trade moot of Glister until 1180 DR, when they were accused of participating in the New Moon Heresy. The three sisters did not survive the accusations, and it was only in 1194 DR that a formal inquest into the matter was performed by the House of the Moon in Thentia. The House of the Moon came to the conclusion that the charges were false and that only Selûne could judge them, formally absolving them of any misdeeds.\nThe accounts of this tragedy eventually found their way to Moonshadow Hall, and were discovered in 1373 DR by High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar as part of her investigations."
