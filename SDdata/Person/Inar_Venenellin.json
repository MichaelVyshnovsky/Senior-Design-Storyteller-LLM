        "Description": "Inar was a human male of 50 years in [[1480 DR]]. He was extremely lean, and perpetually sunburned.",
        "Activities": "As one of the merchant-lords, Inar had a high-ranking position in Imdarn society, advising Lord [[Othmeera Talask]] in matters of government. He also had a business in ship supplies and hiring of sailors and crew.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Quench the Fire of the Raging God|8-9}} He was well-liked and popular among the citizens of Imdolphyn.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Quench the Fire of the Raging God|14}}\n\nThis was a ruse, however, as his true goals were to awaken [[Achazar]] and use the power of the [[primordial]] to transcend mortality. To that end, he led the Cult of Reborn Flame under the alias of Pyrultimus, to achieve his goals.",
        "History": "In [[1479 DR]], Inar sent agents of the cult to different cities of the Windrise Ports to advance his agenda.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Burning Scent of Perfumed Swords|40}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stirring the Embers|4}} Meanwhile, he began to develop a [[ritual]] on his own to awaken Achazar.\n\nWhen a group of adventurers finally discovered his plot, they faced him in his finca in [[Ramekho]], but they weren't a match for him, and Inar fled.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Building the Pyre|32-37}} \n\nIn 1480 DR, the adventurers led a group of powerful individuals of the Windrise Ports against him for a second time, and again were defeated. This time Inar cursed them with madness.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Pyrophobia|4-5}} Inar kidnapped [[Rathloff]], a sage, and forced him to help to finish his ritual.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Quench the Fire of the Raging God|34-36}}\n\nAfter the adventurers were healed, and after discovering that Inar was \"Pyrultimus\", the leader of the Cult of Reborn Flame, they launched an attack on his base of operations in Imdolphyn.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Quench the Fire of the Raging God|5-6}} This time, Inar was conducting his ritual and was about to awaken Achazar, but the adventurers were able to kill him before he could cast the ritual. With Inar dead, the Cult of Reborn Flame was destroyed for good."
