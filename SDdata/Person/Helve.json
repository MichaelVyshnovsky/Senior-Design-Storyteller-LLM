        "mainbody": "Helve was a brigand operating in Tsarn Tombs during the mid-14 century DR.\nHelve was either superstitious or caved when startled.\nWhen Sharantyr followed the tracks of Shandril Shessair through the Tombgate into Tsarn Tombs, she came across some brigands. One of them attacked her with a sword, which was prevented from killing her thanks to an ironguard spell believing her to be a ghost, the man ran, which Shandril responded to by caving in his skull with a stonemaiden. A fellow brigand chastised the dead man, identifying him as \"Helve\"."
