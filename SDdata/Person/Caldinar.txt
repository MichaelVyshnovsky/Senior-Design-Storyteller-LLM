'''Caldinar the Wily''' was a keen-witted but suspicious [[mage]] and an [[adventurer]], active some years before the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Caldinar was known for creating a collection of [[enchanted]] items to aid himself out of a high spot. His paranoid nature ensured that the items were numerous and diverse. One such item from a ''[[girdle of ogre blood]]'' made out of an [[ogre]]'s tanned hide and infused with the creature's black blood. Caldinar was often found using the magic [[belt]] in adventures until his death some years before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}. Soon after, Caldinar's adventuring companions auctioned his ''girdle of ogre blood'' off.
