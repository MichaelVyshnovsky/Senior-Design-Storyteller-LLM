Yarth of Berun was a gnome businessman in Daggerford around 1370 DR.
Yarth managed a series of vaults, considered the safest places to store items in all the North. He claimed that no one could enter one of his vaults without authorization. His vaults were also protected by a ward that stopped evil actions, even those made for good reasons.
