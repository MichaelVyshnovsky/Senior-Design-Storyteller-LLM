'''Yarth of Berun''' was a [[gnome]] businessman in [[Daggerford]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Yarth managed a series of vaults, considered the safest places to store items in all the [[North]]. He claimed that no one could enter one of his vaults without authorization. His vaults were also protected by a ward that stopped evil actions, even those made for good reasons.
