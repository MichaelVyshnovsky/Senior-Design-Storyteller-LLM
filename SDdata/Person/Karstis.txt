Karstis was a human wizard in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Karstis was a student of the magical academy on the Dweomercore level. He was sent to monitor the situation inside the Slitherswamp level with the objective to protect the entrance to their academy. He was supported by two wights and a flesh golem created by Wormriddle the night hag.
In 1491 DR, after the nagas of the Ssethian Scourges slaughtered the yuan-ti, Karstis was sent to control the situation.
Karstis had always at his side four minotaur skeletons.
