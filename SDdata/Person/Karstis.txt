'''Karstis''' was a human wizard in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Activities==
Karstis was a student of the magical academy on the [[Dweomercore]] level. He was sent to monitor the situation inside the [[Slitherswamp]] level with the objective to protect the entrance to their academy. He was supported by two [[wight]]s and a [[flesh golem]] created by [[Wormriddle]] the [[night hag]].

==History==
In [[1491 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} after the [[naga]]s of the [[Ssethian Scourges]] slaughtered the [[yuan-ti]], Karstis was sent to control the situation.

==Relationships==
Karstis had always at his side four [[minotaur]] [[skeleton]]s.
