'''Sheemzher''' was a [[Dekanter goblin|goblin]] from [[Dekanter]] that became a servant of the [[avoral]] [[Lady Wyndyfarh]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], and famously ventured on a quest to save his people from the dark being they worshiped.

{{Quote|He wanted so much to be the hero for his people. He wanted to change them...He was a [[Dekanter goblin|goblin]] and would not listen, so I encouraged his dreams.|[[Lady Wyndyfarh]], speaking of Sheemzher.}}

==Description==
Sheemzher had the red-orange skin that was commonly found among the goblins from Dekanter. the favorite colors of his patron Lady Wyndyfarh, and black leather boots. He topped his ensemble off with a wide-brimmed hat,

==Personality==
Sheemzher was bright, well-spoken, and extremely polite for a goblin. He had a brave could and cared greatly about his family and his tribe. Sheemzher did all he could to keep them safe from forces that sought to manipulate their simplistic nature and limited intelligence.

==Possessions==
Sheemzher always carried with him a a special [[spear]] that was decorated with feathers, along with his fashionable hat. 

==Relationships==
Sheemzher had a wife [[Elva]], whom he cared for deeply. Together the goblin couple had six children.

==History==
===Early Life===
As the son of a tribal elder, Sheemzher was given two great advantages not provided to most goblin youths, plentiful food and training how to fight. He found success early in life and garnered the favor of his tribe's chieftain, so much that he was matched with Elva, one of the chief's daughters. Sheemzher became an elder in his own right and helped elect the [[Ghistpok]], the tribe's next chief.<ref group="note">The word "Ghistpok" has a meaning equivalent to "Chief" among the goblins of Dekanter. While several goblins may have been referred to as "Ghistpok", this individual is differentiated by their relationship with the alhoon known as the Beast Lord.

After some of the Dekanter goblins were being abducted by [[mongrelfolk|monstrous goblinoids]]<ref group="note">While the term "mongrelfolk" never appear in the ''[[The Nether Scroll]]'' novel, the story does include creatures fitting their description that were associated with [[Beast Lord]], who historically has created mongrelmen. they referred to as "demons", the mysterious [[Beast Lord]] of Dekanter appeared to Ghistpok and and offered his protection from these abominations. Under Ghistpok's leadership, the Dekanter goblins began to venerate the Beast Lord as a god. Unbeknownst to the tribe, Ghistpok actually orchestrated the dark rituals that transformed his tribespeople into these monstrosities. 

While Sheemzher was fortunate enough to avoid succumbing to the ritual, Elva was not so fortunate. After Sheemzher lost the goblin woman he loved, he left Dekanter and found salvation and a chance at a new life. He was beckoned by an intelligent [[mantis]] to travel [[Weathercote Wood]] and meet the insect's creator, Lady Wyndyfarh. The powerful [[celestial]] being promised Sheemzher the means to claim revenge upon the Beast Lord and help ensure his children could be spared the same fate as Elva.

===Servant of Wyndyfarh===
When Lady Wyndyfarh became aware that the Beast Lord had recovered one of the lost ''[[Nether Scroll]]s'' from within Dekanter, in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, she tasked Sheemzher with finding people good enough to assist them with its recovery. Sheemzher carried on his search for [[1368 DR|seven years]], visiting the town of [[Parnast]] and the surrounding area numerous times, until he finally met a kind-hearted [[mage]], the "Good Sir" [[Druhallen]]. 

Sheemzher accompanied Druhallen, along with "Good Lady" [[Rozt'a]] and [[Tiep]] through the [[Greypeak Mountains]], back into his former home of Dekanter. While Sheemzher suffered the hostilities of the troubled youth Tiep throughout the journey, he proved loyal to Good Sir and led them towards his former tribe's underground village. He arranged for them to meet Chief Ghistpok, and helped them secure safe passage further into the mines.

The stalwart goblin led his new companions into the lowest depths of Dekanter, into the lair of the Beast Lord itself. As Sheemzher and his party encountered one of the Beast Lord's "demons", and their goblin escorts recognized it as a member of their tribe, Druhallen saw an opportunity to turn Ghistpok and his tribe away from the worship of their "god". Their devotion proved too strong, and Ghistpok began the ritual that took Elva years before, and summoned forth the Beast Lord to feast upon the minds of the human invaders. 

In an act of great bravery, Sheemzher and the human Tiep put aside their difference to secure the ''Nether Scroll'' and distract the Beast Lord long enough to save Druhallen and Rozt'a. When a group of living [[mind flayer]]s assailed the Beast Lord, the group was given the opportunity to flee for the the surface above Dekanter. Sheemzher was gravely injured however, and had to be taken directly to Lady Wyndyfarh at Weathercote Wood for healing.

===Life After Dekanter===
After recovering from his wounds and finally completing the quest he had begun for Lady Wyndyfarh years prior, Sheemzher left Weathercote with his new friends. Though they would travel to Parnast together for a time, the intrepid goblin was now free to choose his own companions and make his own way in the world.
