Fior Botpur was one of the elected Three Lords of Hlath in Chondath in 1358 DR.
Lord Botpur ruled the city together with Lord Warkas and Lord Nybahn.
In 1358 DR, during an absence of both his colleagues, it was reported to Lord Botpur that a barbarian army from Kara-Tur threatened the city. Quickly he gathered all the prominent citizens to discuss the matter. Botpur wanted to hire an adventuring party for an exploration mission.
