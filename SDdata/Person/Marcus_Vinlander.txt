'''Marcus Vinlander''' was a shopkeeper of [[Tuns and Tubs]] in [[Skullport]].

==History==
The [[Vinlander]] family had always been in the vine business and Marcus at first wanted to manage a distillery. After a terrible incident that cost him his left arm, Marcus found his true vocation as a designer. By [[1370 DR]], he oversaw the production of all kinds of containers.
