        "mainbody": "Emser was a mysterious gnome inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe owned a small house located at the intersection of Dukes Way and the High Road across the street from the Grand Playhouse. Emser was believed to be an illusionist of unparalled skill. Most gave him a wide berth when they saw him around Daggerford."
