'''Haskinn Xhesilaphin''' was a renowned [[dragonborn]] [[alchemist]] and a writer, who lived sometime in the early-to-mid-15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Haskinn, in their youth, suffered a de-scaling, the incident that pushed them into the career of alchemy. Haskinn Xhesilaphin sought to discover a way to regrow the missing scales but often of themselves setting the research aside to aid some unfortunate commoners, something of which Haskinn wrote verbosely in their published works. Sometime later into their career, the dragonborn was convinced by [[Nikros]] that the formulas, research, notes, and the unedited contents of their journal needed to be published, after Haskinn encountered a [[poison]]ed [[human]] child in the [[Elfsong Tavern]], while sipping on some [[hot cocoa]].

In their many works, Haskinn relied on the most basic alchemical rule: [[the Rule of Three]], which was an integral part of many of their recipes. One such recipe was a simple ''[[healing potion]]'' recipe made with the [[salt]]s of [[rogue's morsel]] and a suspension of [[mergrass]]. This particular formula helped them soothe the damaged descaled hide that cracked and ripped with ease.

By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Haskinn Xhesilaphin's tome – ''Extracts – The Rule of Three'', was considered the most comprehensive beginner's guide to alchemy. The book was already in its 50{{th}} anniversary re-print with a special foreword penned by [[Adynn Ilvar]]. Their book titled ''[[On Antidotes]]'' was volume two of the ''Basics of Alchemy'' series. It featured a recipe for the basic ''[[antidote]]'' potion made using salts of [[mugwort]] and a suspension of [[bullywug trumpet]]. The ''[[Avernus Survival Guide]]'' was volume five of the series, ''[[On Weapon Coatings]]'' was volume ten, and ''[[Fiendish Alchemy]]'' was volume fourteen. Lastly, Haskinn Xhesilaphin's chance encounter with a [[gnome]] and her [[guinea pig]] led Haskinn to develop a recipe for the ''[[elixir of barkskin]]'' using salts of gnarled [[tree]] bark and suspension of either [[mud mephit]] wing or [[laculite]]. The dragonborn was hopeful that by using that recipe, they would eventually be able to coat their body in [[platinum]] scales as the pain of the damaged hide was starting to become unbearable. Writing with their left hand was turning into a challenge, while the dragonborn's right hand was seized in a claw of agony. In the final books they penned, 'On Serpent Venom Toxin' and 'Recipe of Wyvern Toxin', it's revealed that they ended up losing their mind and poisoning their close friend, Nikros, after the platinum scale plan failed to work out.
