'''Indrila Demaz''' was the Queen of [[Velprin]] and leader of the [[human]] army that invaded the [[Yuirwood]] in response to attacks from the [[half-elf|half-elves]] living there. She became queen in [[1058 DR]]. A year later, in [[1059 DR]], she drove the half-elves further back into the forest. Eventually, in [[1065 DR]], Indrila was defeated by [[Brindor Ol√≥synne]] at the [[Battle of Ingdal's Arm]]. This triggered the surrender of the humans and the formation of [[Aglarond]].
