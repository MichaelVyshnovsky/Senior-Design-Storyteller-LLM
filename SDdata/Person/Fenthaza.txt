'''Fenthaza''' ({{Pronounce|fen|THAH|zah|refs=}}) was a [[yuan-ti]] [[Yuan-ti halfblood|malison]] nightmare speaker and high priest of a yuan-ti cult devoted to [[Dendar|Dendar the Night Serpent]].

==History==
Fenthaza belonged to a cult of yuan-ti that had founded the [[Fane of the Night Serpent]], a temple hidden beneath the palace of [[Omu]]. As high priest of Dendar, Fenthaza performed the ritual to transform [[Ras Nsi]] into a [[Yuan-ti halfblood|yuan-ti malison]], though she later began doubting his role as cult leader. This led to Fenthaza planning a coup to end Ras Nsi's rule.
