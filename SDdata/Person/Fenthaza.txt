Fenthaza () was a yuan-ti malison nightmare speaker and high priest of a yuan-ti cult devoted to Dendar the Night Serpent.
Fenthaza belonged to a cult of yuan-ti that had founded the Fane of the Night Serpent, a temple hidden beneath the palace of Omu. As high priest of Dendar, Fenthaza performed the ritual to transform Ras Nsi into a yuan-ti malison, though she later began doubting his role as cult leader. This led to Fenthaza planning a coup to end Ras Nsis rule.
