'''Gloomfang''' was a [[shadow dragon]] in service of the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] that ravaged the [[Moonsea]] in [[1373 DR]] in a plot to destroy the [[Zhentarim]].

{{quote|'' More of you? The feast grows ever larger! The [[steel]] [[armor|shells]] of these [[human]]s will pose little problem to my fangs and claws - after you have served as the appetizer. Be grateful, for your death will be swift.''|Gloomfang}}

==Description==
Gloomfang emanated a sickening carnal stench. Her giant maw was filled with blood-stained teeth. She spoke in sinister, sibilant whispers. The dragon felt superiority over [[humanoid]]s and was not used to her meals to talk back. Some especially strong humanoids intrigued her.

==Possessions==
Gloomfang carried a ''lesser pale blue [[ioun stone]]'' that further increased her great strength.

==History==
After [[Bane]]'s resurrection in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Cyric's High Priest [[Gormstadd]] returned to worshiping his old deity, transitioning the [[Dark God Reformed]] temple to its Banite roots. This greatly dissatisfied the Mad God, as the following year, the {{YearlinkName|1373}} brought the Order of the Crippled Fang upon the Moonsea, a mysterious cult associated with Cyric. Gloomfang was contacted by the cult's leader, [[archmade]] [[Maganus]] and offered an alliance, a feast, and treasures in exchange for her to hunt down and consume soldiers of the Zhentarim that patrolled the [[Shind Road]] and stop reinforcements to arrive as the cult's summoned [[fiend]]s ravaged the town of [[Voonlar]]. Despite Gloomfang's hatred for [[Crippled Fang]] and her [[undead]] state, the shadow dragon was seduced by the promise of great riches.

The attack on Voonlar was stopped with the help of the [[Hero of Daggerford]] and his allies. As the adventurers moved east along the fiend-infested Shind Road, Gloomfang descended on the group and eventually was slain.
