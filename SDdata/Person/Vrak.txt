Butcher '''Vrak''' was a member of the [[goblin]] camp that made their home within the [[Shattered Sanctum]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Vrak enjoyed the responsibility of chopping up the remains of the people and animals brought back by his fellow goblins after their raids. He worked with Beastmaster [[Zurk]] to ensure that their [[worg]]s were well-fed.

==History==
{{Quote|'Ere to see the [[bear]]? Just follow the noise. [[Worg]]s 'ave been goin' crazy for it.|Vrak.}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Vrak's fellow goblins captured a magnificent [[bear]] that was in fact the [[druid]] [[Halsin]] in his animal form. Some of the goblins wanted the bear to share the same fate as the [[humanoid]]s Vrak chopped up, while others were content with merely tormenting the poor beast.
