        "mainbody": "'''Niro Longtooth''' was a brigand in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).\n\nThe oppressive Niro Longtooth extorted the folk of [[Vanesci Hamlet]] into giving up their food supplies, else the town would be raided. When the leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] returned, with followers starving for food, the villagers had none to spare. The leader surprised Longtooth, confronting the bandits in a [[bloodforge]] battle in the streets and fields of the town."
