During the Absolute crisis, when the Gurs camped in the Rivington district of the city, along with a small army of refugees displaced by the conflict, the tribes children were abducted by Astarion Ancunín under orders from Cazador Szarr.\nPosters with charcoal drawings of Chessas smiling face were found in the Lower City, promising a reward for any information on the childs fate. However, Chessa, along with other abducted Gur children, was turned into a vampire spawn to be used in a hellish ritual by Cazador. Subsequently, Astarion Ancunín found himself released from Cazadors control and, along with the Absolute Adversaries, sought to infiltrate his old masters home. The outcome of Astarions infiltration and the fate of the Gur children remained unconfirmed."
