Hulraven Irlingstar was the patriarch of House Irlingstar in Waterdeep in 1374.
Hulraven was still a very cunning individual, though the years were starting to tell on him.
Circa 1374, helped by his friend Mistmyr Iroan, he recruited an adventuring party (including the shadow canomorph Canumbrax) to rescue his wife Nael, whod been kidnapped by some agents of the Jaezred Chaulssin for unknown reasons.
Hulraven genuinely loved his wife, not knowing the truth about her.
