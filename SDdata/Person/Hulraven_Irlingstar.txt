==Personality==

==History==
Circa 1374, helped by his friend [[Mistmyr Iroan]], he recruited an adventuring party (including the [[shadow]] [[canomorph]] [[Canumbrax]]) to rescue his wife [[Amarune|Nael]], who'd been kidnapped by some agents of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] for unknown reasons.

==Relationship==
Hulraven genuinely loved his wife, not knowing the truth about her.
