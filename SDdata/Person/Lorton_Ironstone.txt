Lorton Ironstone was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
Lorton Ironstone looked much like one of the War Wizards who confronted Elminster Aumar, the fugitive, at Tethgard, surviving only by fleeing.
He talked too much.
Lorton Ironstone wielded an enchanted wand that caused short-term paralysis on its targets, almost certainly akin to a wand of paralyzation.
He also carried an enchanted dagger that glowed upon command.
He was a War Wizard of Cormyr.
Lorton Ironstone encountered Elminster when the latter attempted to sneak into Castle Obarskyr, Suzail, in  after trading no end of meaningless words, he took a black pepper bomb to the face, which disabled him. After reinforcements arrived, the ghost of Alusair Obarskyr, princess-regent from a century prior, walked through him to disable him completely, thus rescuing Elminster.
