'''Shadowfang''' was a [[shadowslain]] [[fang dragon]] involved in the [[Zhent]] invasion of [[Shadowdale]] in [[1375 DR]].

==History==
In [[1373 DR]], Shadowfang approached the [[church of Shar]] in the hopes of using [[Shadow Weave]] magic to avoid the [[Rage of Dragons]]. However, a Rage-induced madness caused him to attack some [[devil]]s in [[Myth Drannor]], resulting in his death.

[[Esvele Greycastle]] retrieved the corpse and had him raised as a shadowslain undead. In 1375 DR, she gave Shadowfang to the Matron Sisters of [[House Dhuurniv]] to cement their alliance with the Sharrans. The [[drow]] initially thought the dragon too subservient to [[Shar]] but soon understood that he was a free agent and collaborated with him.
