        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Popper accompanied the Circus of the Last Days to [[Toril]] and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. There, the kobold was known to steal various items and \"treats\" off of corpses, including a severed hand from the corpse of [[Dribbles]] the clown, on which he promptly gnawed."
