Leetym was a Zhentilar soldier that served as a temple guardian at the Black Altar of Bane in Zhentil Keep during the mid–14 century DR.
When the gods of Faerûn came to Toril as avatars during the Time of Troubles in the , Leetym was in a unique position to witness some of the actions and secrets of the temporarily-mortal deity Bane. He was witness to the fact that Banes avatar was not truly the imposing and mighty form that was displayed for all too see, but still mortal with the same weaknesses as men.
During the Second battle of Shadowdale that same year, Leetym was assigned to fight directly alongside Commander Ronglath Knightsbridge. He seemed to be at least vaguely aware that Bane was readily sending his own zealous followers to their death on purpose.
