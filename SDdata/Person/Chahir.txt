'''Chahir''' was a [[vampire]] [[sorcerer]] who resided in the crypts of [[Dordrien]] in the [[Dagger Hills]].

==Description==
Chahir sported thick black hair and a carefully trimmed beard and mustache. Despite a somewhat emaciated appearance, Chahir was noted as being particularly handsome and had almost beige-colored skin. Dressing in ancient finery, Chahir wore a fine silken robe, embroidered with gold thread and held together down the front by gem-studded buttons.

==Abilities==
Whilst having the formidable array of powerful abilities afforded to most vampires, Chahir also utilized numerous sorcerous powers in conjunction with these to get the jump on interlopers. Often Chahir would turn himself [[Invisibility|invisible]] and seep out of his coffin undetected in his [[gaseous form]] before unleashing potent [[lightning bolt]]s upon his foes.

==Possessions==
During his many years of preying on tomb robbers, Chahir had amassed a sizable amount of [[silver piece|silver]] and [[gold piece|gold]] coins and even an [[emerald]]. He stored this treasure in his wife's vacant coffin. In addition, Chahir carried a number of [[magic]] items on his person, which included a ''[[wand]] of [[magic missile]]s'', a ''[[ring of protection]]'', a ''[[cloak of resistance]]'', and some ''[[bracers of armor]]''.

==Relationships==
Chahir was married to another vampire who had been destroyed in [[Daggerdale]] some time before [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Hailing from an ancient and obscure [[noble]] family, Chahir was in some way connected to the vampires that troubled Daggerdale in [[796 DR]]. Interred with his wife, who was also a vampire, in a mausoleum within the Dordrien crypts, Chahir preyed on numerous travelers over the years. At some point, his wife was destroyed in Daggerdale and by 1372 DR Chahir instead shared his mausoleum with a pair of tomb robbers whom he had transformed into [[vampire spawn]].
