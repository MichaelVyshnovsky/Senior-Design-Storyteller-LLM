'''Prand Pebblefoot''' was a great-nephew of the famed [[hin]] hero [[Pim Pebblefoot]], active sometime in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Prand inherited his great uncle's [[enchanted]] [[boot]]s, called ''[[The Sturdy Feet of Pim]]'', after the hero's death at the ripe
old age of 135 years. Prand wanted to follow in Pim's footsteps and become an adventurer. Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Prand Pebblefoot left his village in the [[Gray Hills]] and headed for the Jewel of the North: the city of [[Neverwinter]]. What became of Prand was unrecorded, but the ''Sturdy Feet'' left his possession, ending up in the inventory of [[Dayne Lynneth]], a [[Blacklake District]] merchant.
