Rikka was a tiefling that lived at the Emerald Grove druidic enclave after being exiled along with all the other tieflings from Elturel in the late 15 century DR.
While guarding the Emerald Grove, Rikka wore a suit of scale mail armor and armed herself with a longbow.
After the Descent of Elturel into Avernus in the , Rikka and the exiled Elturian tieflings led by Zevlor traveled west towards the great metropolis of Baldurs Gate. They were granted temporary refuge at Emerald Grove for some time, due to increased goblin attacks in the region.
Rikka was forced to kill for the first time defending the grove. Even though she killed a goblin that would likely cause her or her companions harm, Rikka was quite troubled about the whole ordeal.
