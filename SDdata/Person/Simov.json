        "mainbody": "'''Simov the Pious''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Oghma]] in the [[Graypeaks]] in the [[Savage Frontier]], and a regional agent of the [[Moonstars]] in the 1370s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Simov once helped to destroy a powerful [[lich]] living in [[Seshrentor]].\n\nAt one point, as a gift from Oghma for his loyal service, he used a ''[[wish]]'' spell and the god gave him the ability to know everything that went on around him. Overwhelmed by the knowledge, Simov retreated into the isolated Seshrentor, where [[Khelben Arunsun]] brought him books that he copied and collected. \n\nIn the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], Khelben asked Simov to join the Moonstars and Simov accepted.",
        "Home": "Simov dwelt in Seshrentor, a tower north-northeast of [[Llorkh]] in the Graypeaks. The former home of the defeated lich, it served as his scriptorium and was stuffed with the many books he collected or copied, some given to him by Khelben.",
        "Activities": "As a regional agent of the Moonstars, Simov's task was to monitor events in the Graypeaks and the [[Fallen Lands]] beyond them.",
        "Powers": "Thanks to his ''wish'', Simov knew everything that happened around him in a one-mile (1.6 kilometer) radius, including the movements of all people and even their thoughts.",
        "Personality": "Simov preferred to stay alone in his tower, in order to remain sane after the effects of the power that Oghma gave to him."
