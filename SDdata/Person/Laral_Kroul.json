        "mainbody": "Laral Kroul  was the main delegate for surface-dwellers in Mantol-Derith.\nLaral was a cunning and mean individual. He liked to appear as a hostile stranger, but was an aggressive dealer and one of the most efficient merchants in the outpost. Nobody knew where he had all his contacts.\nAround 1372 DR, Laral was the representative of surface-dwellers in the merchant outpost."
