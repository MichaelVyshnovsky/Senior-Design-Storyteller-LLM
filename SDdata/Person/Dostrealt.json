        "mainbody": "Dostrealt was a drow wizard and captain of the flitter Erevans Clutch.\nThe mage wore green wizards robes. He was completely blind.\nDostrealt relied mostly on his exceptional hearing to move around and interact with his environment. As a result of his disability, he was unable to climb walls and hide in the shadows with the typical ease that was common to most drow. However, his blindness conferred him several advantages. He was not negatively affected by sunlight like other drow, and he was also immune to spells and magical effects that required the target to see the attacker, such as a medusas petrifying stare.\nDostrealt owned two spellbooks, both written in a script of raised dots and dashes rather than magical ink. The elf could read his books by running his fingers over the writings.\nHis primary spellbook consisted exclusively of spells that did not require line of sight, such as Caligardes claw, decastave, dispel silence, ghost pipes, ironguard, know school, paralyze, Quimbys enchanting gourmet, secure, skull watch, spelltrap, spell engine, Spendelardes chaser, and sunburst. It also contained the unique spells Snillocs heat-seeking snowball and Snillocs heat-seeking major missile, which were modifications developed by Dostrealt himself so they could be cast without visual contact. His second spellbook contained a more general assortment of common spells.\nThe wizard also carried a rod of blind walking and a ring of protection, as well as a piccolo and a flute.\nDostrealt was originally part of the crew of a drow armada. The ship encountered a neogi mindspider and, in the ensuing fight, a mage from the opponent ship targeted the armadas crew with a curse. Unable to dodge the spell, Dostrealt fell victim to the curse, which consisted of an invisible quasit that constantly worked mischief against everyone around, except for Dostrealt himself. After failed attempts at removing the curse, Dostrealt exiled himself aboard the flitter and left the armada to protect his crew.\nSince the curse had materialized itself in the form of a creature, spells such as remove curse were ineffective against it. The only way to remove he curse was if a non-drow accepted Dostrealt as a friend, and said so out loud.\nAfter abandoning his mothership, Dostrealt drifted for an unknown amount of time in Realmspace, until falling unconscious as a result of the rapidly decaying quality of his ships air envelope."
