He settled in [[Athkatla]], the capital city of [[Amn]] under the rule of the [[Cowled Wizards]], a dangerous home to be for an [[arcane]] spellcaster. Edwin joined with the [[Shadow Thieves]], under [[Mae'Var]], a leader of one of the smaller guildhalls. During this time Edwin sought out one of the lost [[Nether Scrolls]], an ancient [[artifact]] of immense arcane power, which he believed to rest in the dungeons deep beneath a tomb in the city's [[Athkatla/Grave District|graveyard district]].",
        "Personality": "Edwin had a disdainful, conceited personality. He believed himself to be an exceptional genius, while his behavior demonstrated that he was often less than wise. He was self-centered to the point of megalomania and constantly refers to other people as \"monkeys\" or by some near-synonym. His insults often occurred when speaking to himself about others, seemingly unaware that they could hear his commentary.",
        "Possessions": "Edwin owned a ''[[Edwin's amulet|unique amulet]]'' that had been passed down by generations of his family. He also had a set of ''[[Robe of red flames|robes]]'' that signified his status as a Red Wizard of Thay.",
        "History": "Some time before the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Edwin was on a mission, whether personal or sanctioned by the Red Wizards, to kill the [[Rashemi]] [[Wychlaran]], [[Dynaheir]].\n\nAfter his journeys in the region between the Sword Coast and Amn, Edwin ventured with several other [[Red Wizards]] a bit further north along the Sword Coast. During their travels, the mages were stopped by the crusading army of the Shining Lady, [[Caelar Argent]]. Two of his companions, one of whom was named [[Vichand]], joined the crusade while the third was killed. Edwin managed to escape the encounter and swore revenge on the Shining Lady and her army.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = Elminster this, Elminster that.
