Dagryg was an ogre chieftain in Thar in 1373 DR.
Dagryg and his small tribe lived in a fort once inhabited by the fabled Vorbyx. He ordered his tribe to spare all visitors, understanding that bargaining with them granted more riches.
Once Dagryg worked for a hill giant chieftain who taught him how to spare visitors. In 1373 DR, the annis hag Gwyaher, disguised as a frost giant with her disguise self ability, tried to convince Dagryg and his tribe to become her followers.
