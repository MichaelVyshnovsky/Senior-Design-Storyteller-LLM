'''Argys Kral''' was an inhabitant of the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When Argys went to [[Aunsible Durn's smithy]], [[Dovo]]—a friend of Argys who'd worked there and fancied himself a prankster—put a burr under his [[mare]]'s saddle so it threw him when he mounted. [[Aunsible Durn]] chewed Dovo out for that. Argys was likely even less impressed.
