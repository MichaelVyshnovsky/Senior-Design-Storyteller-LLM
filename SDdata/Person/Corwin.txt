'''Corwin''' was a cook employed by [[Gustaf Stellern]] in his [[Falcon's hunting lodge|hunting lodge]] in [[Neverwinter Wood]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
In the late 15th century [[DR]], Corwin was an aged man who was disenchanted because of his life experiences. He lived in a simply furnished bedroom on the upper level of the stable house.

==History==
Corwin's employer, Gustaf Stellern, liked to hunt [[orc]]s and turn their heads into trophies. Corwin warned him that this could provoke a retaliatory attack and he was proved right. Following the appearance of the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] in the region, the orcs formed an alliance with a [[half-orc]] cult of [[Talos]] and attacked the hunting lodge. The [[anchorites of Talos]] also conjured [[Gorthok]] the Thunder Boar to aid the attack.
