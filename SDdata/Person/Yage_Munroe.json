        "mainbody": "'''Yage Munroe''' was a ruffian from the Munroe \"family\" that harassed inhabitants of [[Liam's Hold]] in [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "Yage was a young woman with nasty attitude, violent streak, and poor [[hygiene]].",
        "History": "In 1372 DR, Yage, along with her \"family members,\" [[Methro Munroe|Methro]], [[Jethro Munroe|Jeth]], [[Sossi Munroe|Sossi \"Munroe\"]], and [[Fang (dog)|Fang]], camped out on the outskirts of the hamlet of Liam's Hold along the [[Trade Way]]. The gang of vagrants quickly became a nuisance and danger to the community after they started harassing and roughing up local farmers. To guarantee the safety of her village, Mayor [[Wilsey]] listed the help of the individual known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. The adventurer was investigating mysteriously disappearing cattle on the [[Wild Pastures]] and was considered a trusted ally. Mayor offered the Hero the [[Stronghold (Liam's Hold)|Stronghold]] - a small keep outside of the hamlet that once belonged to evil cultists of [[Bhaal]], in exchange for driving the Monroe vagrants away without bloodshed."
