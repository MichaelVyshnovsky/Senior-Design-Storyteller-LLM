Ellesime was the elven queen of Suldanessellar.
She was said to be of divine heritage indeed, her beauty was often compared to that of a goddess. Ellesime inhabited the palace of Suldanessellar, which was built around the Tree of Lifeâ€”the queens eternal youth was said to be preserved by the tree, and as such it was difficult to judge her age. She was once in a relationship with the mage Irenicus, who was subsequently exiled from Suldanessellar for attempting to raise himself to the status of godhood.
In 1368 DR, Ellesime was forced to flee Suldanessellar, after it was attacked by Joneleth, "The Exile". She and the other survivors fled to Myth Rhynn.
