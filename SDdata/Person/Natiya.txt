Lady '''Natiya''' was the dowager mother of Priest-King [[Vishnan VII]] of the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in [[Malatra]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
She remained as the leading member of the nobility and was a significant influence on her son the king. She had imperial ambitions for the Kuong Kingdom, which she encouraged in Vishnan, and this led to the planned invasion of [[Laothan]] around [[1357 DR]].
