==Personality==
Larethar was a rude, wise-cracking rogue, whose talents lay chiefly in consuming alcohol, stealing, and simple thuggery. However, when traveling with [[Illydia Maethellyn]], his [[moon elf]] friend and ally, Larethar's life took on an entirely different meaning. With Illydia, Larethar could be a champion of good, and he felt deeply honored to be allowed to travel alongside her.

==Relationships==
His closest friend was Illydia Maethellyn.

==Possessions==
Larethar carried an [[enchanted]] [[shortsword]] called the ''[[Bastard's Inheritance]]''. The dwarf's stories of acquiring the blade changed with each retelling, either because if his bad memory or unwillingness to disclose.

==History==
Larethar was born in the city of [[Westgate]] on the [[Dragon Coast]]. His family was originally from the [[East Rift]], but his father moved them to Westgate prior to Larethar's birth, seeking to make his fortune by smuggling goods and bribing officials for shipping contracts. Although he was initially successful and grew rich very rapidly, Larethar's father was eventually murdered by rivals. Larethar's mother, who disapproved of her husband's criminal activities, had anticipated the murder. Hoping for a fresh start, she brought Larethar and his siblings on a [[caravan]] to [[Luskan]].
