Larethar Gulgrin was a gold dwarf rogue from Luskan who became embroiled in stopping the balor Belaphoss from ascending to the position of demon lord in the 1490s DR.
Larethar was a rude, wise-cracking rogue, whose talents lay chiefly in consuming alcohol, stealing, and simple thuggery. However, when traveling with Illydia Maethellyn, his moon elf friend and ally, Larethars life took on an entirely different meaning. With Illydia, Larethar could be a champion of good, and he felt deeply honored to be allowed to travel alongside her.
His closest friend was Illydia Maethellyn.
Larethar carried an enchanted shortsword called the Bastards Inheritance. The dwarfs stories of acquiring the blade changed with each retelling, either because if his bad memory or unwillingness to disclose.
Larethar was born in the city of Westgate on the Dragon Coast. His family was originally from the East Rift, but his father moved them to Westgate prior to Larethars birth, seeking to make his fortune by smuggling goods and bribing officials for shipping contracts. Although he was initially successful and grew rich very rapidly, Larethars father was eventually murdered by rivals. Larethars mother, who disapproved of her husbands criminal activities, had anticipated the murder. Hoping for a fresh start, she brought Larethar and his siblings on a caravan to Luskan.
