'''Phaudrantanthildrar''', or '''Phaudron''' for short, was a [[steel dragon]] who lived on the continent of [[Arandron]] on [[Toril]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-10-28 - Velsaertirden}}

==Relations==
Phaudron's mate was [[Malavauvrantarandra]] (Malavauvra), who was aged and unwell. Malavauvra had laid a number of clutches of eggs in her lifetime, but her last with Phaudron was in poor shape: most of the young were sickly and died as hatchlings or within their first year. Only [[Velsaertirden]], [[Rauvrahrileenatandrar]], and [[Torthalindrarron]] survived.

==Lair==
The family laired within the castle of [[Steelspires]], which had been built for them by [[stone giant]]s. It stood on a high, bare rocky ridge behind the bustling port city of [[Haunvaerune]].

==Personality==
Phaudron was a withdrawn, scholarly type who was focused on his research.

==Activities==
He had a keen interest in [[magic]] that would extend a dragon's life and vitality without limit, and without becoming a [[dracolich]] or employing other forms of [[necromancy]]. To this end, he constantly developed and experimented with [[arcane]] magic and regularly traveled far and wide to discover new magics and obtain rare substances for [[material component]]s.

==History==
Some time around the 8{{th}} century [[DR]], Phaudron went off on another expedition, but could not find the rare component he was after. While he was away, his daughter Rauvrahreene discovered his notes, made copies, and slipped away to her lair to devise a way to reverse her father's spells. When Phaudron returned weary to Steelspires, she was waitingâ€”Rauvrahreene secretly cast the reversed spells and slew her father. She then murdered her mother in her sleep the same way and seized control of Steelspires, turning it against her brothers.
