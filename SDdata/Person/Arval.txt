'''Arval''' was a male [[human]] of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Arval was a servant of the [[King of Shadows]]. He was sent to [[Neverwinter]] to form a secret cult and attract the younger citizens to join the cult. Once he gathered enough followers, he prepared the ritual to join with the shadow.

===Gameplay===
When the [[Kalach-Cha]] came to the end of the [[Bryce crypt]], Arval would be about to finish the ritual. He and his followers would attack the Kalach-Cha. However, [[Lisbet Bryce]] then completed the ritual, causing Arval and his followers to be revived as shadows, who would attack once more.
