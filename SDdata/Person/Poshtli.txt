'''Poshtli''' was one of the [[Eagle Knights (Maztica)|Eagle Knights]] of [[Nexal]].

==History==
Poshtli was the nephew of [[Naltecona]] and one of his wisest advisors.

In [[1361 DR]], Poshtli sensed something was wrong and went in search of answers. After a stop at the [[House of Tezca]], where he received a vision from the [[Sunstone (lake)|Sunstone]], he went to [[Ulatos]] in time to save [[Erixitl]]'s life from one of the [[Ancient Ones]].

He befriended both Erixitl and [[Halloran]] and together they decided to work for peace between [[Nexal]] and the [[Golden Legion]], which had just arrived from [[Faer√ªn]].

Poshtli went back to Nexal but thanks to the plots of the worshipers of [[Zaltec]], a battle was fought between the legionaries and [[Nexalan]]s. Afterward, Naltecona decided to submit to the Legion's leader [[Cordell]]. When Naltecona was taken hostage by the legionaries, Poshtli was named substitute regent.

With the help of Erixitl and Halloran, Poshtli tried to free his uncle, a key player in stopping Zaltec's plots, but they failed and so started the [[Night of Wailing]].

Poshtli survived and helped lead the column of refugees. He joined Halloran's party at [[Twin Visages]] and was decisive in killing both [[Coton]] and [[Darien]], banishing both Zaltec and [[Qotal]] from [[Maztica]].

At last he decided to live in the new city of [[Tukan]].
