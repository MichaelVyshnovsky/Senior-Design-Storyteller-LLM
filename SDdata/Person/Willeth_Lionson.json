        "mainbody": "Willeth Lionson was a tharchion of Thaymount in the midâ€“14 century DR. He was put in charge of the gold mines circa 1362 DR.\nWilleth was squat with a broad, sturdy frame and a barrel-like chest. He had a bald head, which was a sign of status in Thay. His head was decorated with a drawn pale-orange four-clawed paw, the symbol of Malar the Beastlord. The tharchions clothes were sturdy and of good expensive quality.\nWilleth was loyal to the Council of Zulkirs and to Thay, even when faced with torture and death.\nTharchion Willeth Lionson was selected by the Council of Zulkirs to oversee the Thayvian gold mines with Maligors help but remained unaffiliated with individual zulkirs.\nIn 1362 DR, Willeth Lionson was captured by Maligor, the Zulkir of Transmutation as a part of the wizards plot to usurp control over Thay. The Red Wizards gnolls captured Willeth on his way to Tantras to purchase new mining equipment. His scheduled two-week absence gave Maligor time to carry out his scheme.\nCaptured Willeth was tortured and, under the influence of the friends spell, ended up revealing all the information the Red Wizard was after. He disclosed the locations of traps, the mines defenses, and the daily production of gold, as well as the newly discovered abundant new vein. Taking control over Thays gold was fundamental for Maligors plan. He planned on using his horde of darkenbeasts to take over the mines and putting his trusted assistant Asp in charge.\nAfter Willeths usefulness ended, Maligor fed the tortured man to his gnoll friends. Afterward, he assembling the bones and clothes that were left behind into a sack to be secured to prevent his opponents using magic to communicate with the dead."
