        "mainbody": "'''Eltoora Sarptyl''' was the guildmaster of the [[Many-Starred Cloak]] in the {{YearlinkName|1360}} and as late as the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.",
        "Description": "She seemed calm and assured of herself. Her clothes were immaculate, as though the dust in the air was repelled from them. While in [[Port Llast]], she used to stare at the sky contemplatively; her eyes were glassy.",
        "History": "During the outbreak of the [[Wailing Death]], Eltoora would offer the [[Hero of Neverwinter]] membership in the [[Many-Starred Cloak]] if they were able to retrieve four reagents guarded by [[mephit|mephits]] across the city, and then defeat a [[minogon]].\n\nShe accompanied [[Aarin Gend]]-[[Nasher Alagondar]]'s spymaster, and [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]] to [[Port Llast]] on behalf of the guild. While supporting them, she was seeking out five arcane [[tome]]s from [[Imaskar]] detailing the construction of ancient magical items; she may have recruited the help of the Hero of Neverwinter. Those tomes were the [[Imaskarran Tome of Death|''Imaskarran Tome of Death'']], the ''[[Imaskarran Tome of Life]]'', the ''[[Imaskarran Tome of Resonance]]'', the ''[[Imaskarran Tome of Fire]]'', and the ''[[Imaskarran Tome of Ice]]''.\n\nAfter Aribeth de Tylmarande joined [[Maugrim Korothir]], one of the commanders serving the [[Old One]]s, Eltoora Sarptyl continued providing support to Aarin Gend. During that time, Eltoora maintained a small laboratory in [[Beorunna's Well]] â€“ the center of Aarin's search for artifacts to be used against the Old Ones."
