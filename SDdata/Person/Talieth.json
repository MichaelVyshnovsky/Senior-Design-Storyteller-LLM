        "mainbody": "'''Talieth''' was the Lady of Sentinelspire, the daughter of [[Alaodin]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||15}}",
        "Description": "Talieth had flawless, smooth, dark skin, black eyes, and black hair she kept in braids to her waist.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||15}}",
        "History": "Prior to {{yearlink|1365}}, Talieth had a romance with [[Kheil]], her father's best assassin.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||8}} She wept for the man's death during his raid on the [[Yuirwood]] on [[Mirtul 2]] of that year.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||20}} In the years since, she participated in two revolts against her father, both of which were quashed; she personally led the second revolt in {{yearlink|1369}}, which left her imprisoned in the dungeons of the fortress. When the [[druid]] [[Chereth]] slew Alaodin and freed her, she swore loyalty to him; the druid then became the second Old Man of the Mountain.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||36}} At some point after Kheil's death, she also took the assassin [[Valmir]] as her lover and began to teach him magic.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||16}}\n\nShe learned that [[Kheil]] was alive again by scrying in {{yearlink|1374}}, after learning that the new Old Man of the Mountain sought an artifact of [[Silvanus]], ''[[Erael'len]]'', which the former assassin held. She sent [[Sauk]] and a number of others to the [[Shalhoond]] to fetch the killer and the artifact.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||5}} Instead, they retrieved the artifact and Berun's apprentice, [[Lewan]]. Though she was informed by Sauk that Kheil was no longer himself, and also that he was swallowed by the earth, she remained skeptical that he may be dead yet, believing this to be a machination of Chereth's.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||14}} Once Lewan was awake, she told him that the Old Man meant to trigger a supervolcanic eruption using the relic, and that she wanted him to invert its functions in order to prevent the relic from ever accomplishing this function.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||17}}\n\nOn the night of [[Tarsakh 19]], she took an opportunity to send assassins after the Old Man's men during a vigil that he had called. On [[Tarsakh 20]], Lewan accepted after [[Ulaan]], one of her personal blades, seduced him the night before.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||21}} Upon his return, Sauk immediately informed her that the Old Man of the Mountain had spoken to Lewan during his purification ritual.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||23}}\n\nThat night on [[Tarsakh 25]], Kheil, now Berun, attacked the fortress and forced his way inside. Talieth slew several blades loyal to her father,{{cite book/Sentinelspire||30}} but she was unwilling to harm Berun or let any harm come to him, even standing up to Sauk after Berun's animal companion slew [[Taaki]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||33}} She was captured soon after by the forces of the Old Man, being released by her lover, Valmir.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||38}} During the final battle against the Old Man of the Mountain, her life was threatened to make Berun more pliable.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||37}} She was eventually amongst the few people who survived [[Tarsakh 25]] in Sentinelspire.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||41}}"
