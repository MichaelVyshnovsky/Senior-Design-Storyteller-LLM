        "mainbody": "Talieth was the Lady of Sentinelspire, the daughter of Alaodin.\nTalieth had flawless, smooth, dark skin, black eyes, and black hair she kept in braids to her waist.\nPrior to , Talieth had a romance with Kheil, her fathers best assassin. She wept for the mans death during his raid on the Yuirwood on Mirtul 2 of that year. In the years since, she participated in two revolts against her father, both of which were quashed she personally led the second revolt in , which left her imprisoned in the dungeons of the fortress. When the druid Chereth slew Alaodin and freed her, she swore loyalty to him the druid then became the second Old Man of the Mountain. At some point after Kheils death, she also took the assassin Valmir as her lover and began to teach him magic.\nShe learned that Kheil was alive again by scrying in , after learning that the new Old Man of the Mountain sought an artifact of Silvanus, Eraellen, which the former assassin held. She sent Sauk and a number of others to the Shalhoond to fetch the killer and the artifact. Instead, they retrieved the artifact and Beruns apprentice, Lewan. Though she was informed by Sauk that Kheil was no longer himself, and also that he was swallowed by the earth, she remained skeptical that he may be dead yet, believing this to be a machination of Chereths. Once Lewan was awake, she told him that the Old Man meant to trigger a supervolcanic eruption using the relic, and that she wanted him to invert its functions in order to prevent the relic from ever accomplishing this function.\nOn the night of Tarsakh 19, she took an opportunity to send assassins after the Old Mans men during a vigil that he had called. On Tarsakh 20, Lewan accepted after Ulaan, one of her personal blades, seduced him the night before. Upon his return, Sauk immediately informed her that the Old Man of the Mountain had spoken to Lewan during his purification ritual.\nThat night on Tarsakh 25, Kheil, now Berun, attacked the fortress and forced his way inside. Talieth slew several blades loyal to her father, but she was unwilling to harm Berun or let any harm come to him, even standing up to Sauk after Beruns animal companion slew Taaki. She was captured soon after by the forces of the Old Man, being released by her lover, Valmir. During the final battle against the Old Man of the Mountain, her life was threatened to make Berun more pliable. She was eventually amongst the few people who survived Tarsakh 25 in Sentinelspire."
