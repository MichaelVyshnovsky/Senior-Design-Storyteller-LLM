        "mainbody": "'''Wanev''' was a [[wizard]] aligned with the [[Cowled Wizards]] of [[Athkatla]]. He served them as the Director at [[Spellhold]] in [[1369 DR]]. Unfortunately, he had the bad luck to be present on the island when the Cowled Wizards captured [[Jon Irenicus]] and sent him to Spellhold for detainment.",
        "History": "Wanev was presiding over Spellhold when Irenicus arrived in [[1369 DR]], and was present at the asylum when the fallen elven [[archmage]] broke out of his captivity and went on a rampage against his captors. Wanev was one of only two Cowled Wizards who survived the assault, with the other being [[Lonk the Sane]]. However, Wanev did not survive unscathed; a bad reaction to an unknown spell loosed at him by Irenicus shattered his mind and left him a demented, raving mess. Apparently amused by this irony, Irenicus imprisoned Wanev among the asylum inmates he had previous ruled over.\n\nWhen [[Gorion's Ward]] arrived, and sought the aid of the inmates in defeating Irenicus, Wanev was the first to rally behind the [[Bhaalspawn]], his broken psyche easily realigning around his desire for vengeance. Unfortunately, he perished in the ensuing battle."
