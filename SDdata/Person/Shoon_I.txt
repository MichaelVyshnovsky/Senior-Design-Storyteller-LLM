'''Shoon I''' ({{Pronounce|SHOON|refs={{Cite adventurers league/A Wrinkle in the Weave|12}}}}) was the second emperor of the [[Shoon Imperium]].

==Description==
Shoon I was a handsome man, but his eyes were guarded and he had a cruelty that was visible in his facial features.

==Personality==
Shoon I was a very proud man. In his vanity, he commissioned the construction of many statues and murals of his likeness that remained for centuries.

==Activities==
Shoon I was responsible for the start of the massive road system project that connected the cities of [[Calimshan]], including beginning the project of extending the [[Trade Way]] across the [[Calim Desert]].

Shoon also saw to the formation of the [[Wizard's Consortium]] that grew to become the Guilds Arcane of modern Calimshan.

==Relationships==
Shoon I was the son of [[Amahl Shoon III]]. He had three older brothers, who were slain in so-called "hunting accidents" orchestrated by his father's enemies. He had at least four children, three sons and a daughter. His sons were named [[Qamar el Shoon|Qamar]], [[Ksan el Shoon|Ksan]], and Aleph. Aleph would go on to become [[Shoon II]].

==History==
Shoon I was born with the name '''Aleph yn Amahl el Shoon''' in [[12 DR]]. He was the only surviving son of Amahl Shoon III. When he took the throne of the Empire in [[50 DR]], he abandoned his given name and went simply by his surname Shoon. He was the first of the seven emperors who would do so.

==Trivia==
Shoon I's statue was the southern-facing statue of the [[Fountain of the Qysars]] in [[Calimport]].
