        "mainbody": "'''Antwun Dufay''' was a [[vampire spawn]] chamberlain who worked at the [[Szarr Palace]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''My one regret is dear Lurianna—but I simply cannot trust her with the secret of my one chance of escape. When the potion wears off, Cazador will have Ascended and will have need of my services—or he will be no more, and mastery of the place will fall to me.''|Excerpt from Dufay's diary}}",
        "Description": "Antwun was a man with sharp features, pale skin, and long straight dark hair, dressed in finery.",
        "History": "Chamberlain Dufay entered [[Cazador Szarr]]'s service some years before 1492 DR. He supervised the entirety of the [[vampire lord]]'s army of enthralled servants, guests, and hirelings in the Szarr Palace located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate. He sternly warned the staff of several rules they had to follow: Cazador liked silence and demanded no one speak unless spoken to; he liked diligence, and no servant was to be seen idling by him; Cazador liked to be respected, so all servants were to look down in his presence; and lastly there was to be no whistling. Apart from the staff, Dufay was also in charge of event planning and \"Cazador's finest\" vampire spawn. The chamberlain ordered the spawn to hunt for lowborn Baldurians only, to avoid the [[patriar]]s' wrath, especially in the late 15{{th}} century DR after Cazador's spawn took members of the [[Dlusker]], [[Jhasso]], and [[Oathoon]] families.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Cazador Szarr was ready to perform a ritual that would elevate him to being a [[vampire ascendant]]. Chamberlain Dufay ordered no one to be admitted into the palace on the day before the ritual, promising the three guards of the entrance a \"reward\" that was to come after the ritual's completion. With one of Cazador's vampire spawns missing, however, Antwun Dufay was ordered to take his place in the ritual. However, Dufay knew of what would happen to him in the ritual and made a plan to avoid that fate. He purchased a potion from [[Bonecloak's Apothecary]] that would knock the imbiber out, giving Dufay the appearance of death and to make sure the illusion was believable, he also purchased lookalike potions of [[acid]] [[poison]].\n\nIt was unknown if Antwun Dufay consumed the potion and outlived his master. By the time the ritual began, his body was found in the Szarr Palace, showing evidence of acid poisoning, implying he accidentally drank the wrong vial. [[Lurianna Sauvage]], a [[werewolf]] lover of Antwun's, was not informed of the chamberlain's plan as he was unsure if she could be trusted not to betray the plan to her master. When she found her beloved's body, Lurianna wrote a goodbye note and drank another poison potion, following Dufay into the afterlife."
