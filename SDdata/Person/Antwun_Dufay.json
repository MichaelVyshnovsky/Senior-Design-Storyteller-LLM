        "mainbody": "Antwun Dufay was a vampire spawn chamberlain who worked at the Szarr Palace of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nAntwun was a man with sharp features, pale skin, and long straight dark hair, dressed in finery.\nChamberlain Dufay entered Cazador Szarrs service some years before 1492 DR. He supervised the entirety of the vampire lords army of enthralled servants, guests, and hirelings in the Szarr Palace located in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate. He sternly warned the staff of several rules they had to follow Cazador liked silence and demanded no one speak unless spoken to he liked diligence, and no servant was to be seen idling by him Cazador liked to be respected, so all servants were to look down in his presence and lastly there was to be no whistling. Apart from the staff, Dufay was also in charge of event planning and \"Cazadors finest\" vampire spawn. The chamberlain ordered the spawn to hunt for lowborn Baldurians only, to avoid the patriars wrath, especially in the late 15 century DR after Cazadors spawn took members of the Dlusker, Jhasso, and Oathoon families.\nIn the , Cazador Szarr was ready to perform a ritual that would elevate him to being a vampire ascendant. Chamberlain Dufay ordered no one to be admitted into the palace on the day before the ritual, promising the three guards of the entrance a \"reward\" that was to come after the rituals completion. With one of Cazadors vampire spawns missing, however, Antwun Dufay was ordered to take his place in the ritual. However, Dufay knew of what would happen to him in the ritual and made a plan to avoid that fate. He purchased a potion from Bonecloaks Apothecary that would knock the imbiber out, giving Dufay the appearance of death and to make sure the illusion was believable, he also purchased lookalike potions of acid poison.\nIt was unknown if Antwun Dufay consumed the potion and outlived his master. By the time the ritual began, his body was found in the Szarr Palace, showing evidence of acid poisoning, implying he accidentally drank the wrong vial. Lurianna Sauvage, a werewolf lover of Antwuns, was not informed of the chamberlains plan as he was unsure if she could be trusted not to betray the plan to her master. When she found her beloveds body, Lurianna wrote a goodbye note and drank another poison potion, following Dufay into the afterlife."
