        "mainbody": "Baklin was a dwarf of Clan Stoneshaft who lived in Waterdeep during the late 14 century DR.\nLike many of his kin Baklin was stout and sported the typical dwarven beard. His appearance was so akin to his fellow dwarves it could be described as wholly unremarkable.\nBaklin worked as a bartender at the Quaffing Quaggoth in the citys Castle Ward. He also served as an ally to the Red Sashes, keeping an eye on the tavern for the vigilante group."
