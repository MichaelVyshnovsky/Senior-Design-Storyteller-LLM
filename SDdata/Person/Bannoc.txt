'''Bannoc''', son of [[Enroc]], was a [[cleric]] of [[Tyr]] and a venerated of [[Myth Drannor]] who died before the city's destruction in the [[Weeping War]] of [[714 DR]].

==Possessions==
Bannoc famously wielded the ''[[Hammer of justice (weapon)|hammer of justice]]'', a powerful enchanted [[warhammer]] of his church. The hero took his weapon to the grave.

==History==
Bannoc was laid to rest inside a heroes' crypt in the [[Elven Catacombs]]' First Cellar, alongside his fellow heroes, [[Arianna]] the Archer, [[Erik Sliphand]] the rogue, [[Magister]] [[Luther]], [[Shyla]] of [[Damara]], and [[Sindar]] the Warrior. Their graves remain undisturbed for centuries until [[1369 DR]] when the [[Cult of the Dragon]] invaded the ruins and allowed their [[drow]] allies to loot the catacombs of their ancient enemies. All six heroes' graves were forever changed in the chaos of the Weeping War, twisted into [[undead]] perverse versions of themselves. The heroes were cursed to guard their cherished artifacts as [[wraith]]s, ready to attack anyone stupid or brave enough to steal the magic items from the sarcophagi.
