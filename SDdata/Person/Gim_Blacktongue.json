        "mainbody": "'''Gim Blacktongue''' was a mage and ruler of the kingdom of [[Doegan]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).\n\nGim Blacktongue was a cunning mage who used treachery to usurp the throne of Doegan. Although the kingdom prospered, it did so under an air of suspicion, and Doegan folk called for a new and trustworthy rule. The leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] came to Doegan and attempted to remove Blacktongue from power."
