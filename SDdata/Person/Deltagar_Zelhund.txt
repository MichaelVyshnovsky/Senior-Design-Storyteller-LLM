'''Deltagar Zelhund''' was one of the Overwizards of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] in the 1360s [[DR]].

==Activities==
''Circa'' [[1365 DR]], Deltagar was growing a criminal network in southern countries like [[Lantan]] and [[Tashalar]], and was planning to soon use his agents to fund all the Brotherhood's activities. He plotted to sack [[Chult]] and steal the best inventions from Lantan.

==History==
In [[1371 DR]], after [[Eldeluc]] and [[Valkebar]]'s coup against the Archmage Arcane, [[Arklem Greeth]], Deltagar pledged his loyalty to the conspirators. When Greeth returned, now transformed into a [[lich]] and with some new [[devil]]ish allies, Deltagar escaped to [[Hlondeth]], where he was granted refuge. 

==Personality==
Deltagar was utterly fascinated by the [[yuan-ti]]. He was a master manipulator, disliking open hostility.
