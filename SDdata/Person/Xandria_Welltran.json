        "mainbody": "andria Welltran was a resident of Phlan that lived in the city and died some time during or before the late 15 century DR. There was evidence that they were a member of, or otherwise associated with the first iteration of the Cult of the Dragon.While not explicitly stated, allusions to the formation of dracoliches and use of chromatic dragon imagery associated with Tiamat (not to mention the theme of the Tyranny of Dragons Adventurers League storyline), suggest this character is associated with the Cult of the Dragon.\nXandria was buried within the stone-and-marble Welltran Crypt in Valhingen Graveyard.\nAt some point in the 1480s DR, Brother Keefe and the Kelemvorite clerics of Phlan were offered some manner of evidence showing that Xandria was not in fact human but rather a green dragon that had been polymorphed.\nXandrias crypt included oddities associated with dragonkind and the Cult of the Dragon. Notable among these were humanoid skeletons with dragon-shaped skulls, a secret door opened with gems representing the five types of chromatic dragons associated with the goddess Tiamat, and cursed alchemical solutions that could reanimate the bones and flesh of draconic beings."
