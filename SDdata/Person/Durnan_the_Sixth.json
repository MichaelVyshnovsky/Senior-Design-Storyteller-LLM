        "Personality": "Much like his ancestor, Durnan held the adventuring profession in high regard, and welcomed all sorts to his inn. However, he did not abide violence nor other shady activities from his patrons, and was not above using violence himself to enforce his few policies.\n\nDurnan had a healthy respect for the dangers of [[Undermountain]], and together with his wife he actively tried to dissuade his children from entering that dark place.",

        "History": "Despite having been gone for nearly a century, the original Durnan mysteriously returned one day, taking up his old place behind the bar of the Yawning Portal. He paid his descendant a substantial sum to purchase the inn back, allowing him to quietly retire."
