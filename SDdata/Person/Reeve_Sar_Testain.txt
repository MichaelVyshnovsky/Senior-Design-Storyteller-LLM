'''Reeve Sar Testain''' was a pirate captain in the [[Moonsea]] region around [[1429 DR]], commanding the ship ''[[Audacity]]''.

==History==
One day in [[1429 DR]], he and his crew sacked the merchant ship ''[[Abundant Serendipity]]'' after a fierce fight. Reeve and his men decided to stop to repair the damage and rest for a while in a small village on an isle near [[Phlan]]. Soon, the pirates enslaved the villagers.

What Captain Reeve did not know was that near the village was a powerful altar to [[Tiamat]]. At last, out of desperation, the villagers invoked [[devil]] servants of Tiamat, in exchange for their souls and worship, to banish the pirate crew of Reeve Sar Testain. The pirates were swallowed up into the [[Nine Hells]].{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows over the Moonsea|5-6}}  

However, in [[1489 DR]], during a fight with a [[Cult of the Dragon]] warship led by [[Ixas]], their bonds were somehow broken and Reeve and his men, now [[fiend]]s, returned to [[Toril]]. Eventually, thanks to an adventuring party hired to investigate rumors of [[dracolich]]es and [[ghost]] ships wandering the area, Reeve and his fiendish pirates were defeated.{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows over the Moonsea|26}}
