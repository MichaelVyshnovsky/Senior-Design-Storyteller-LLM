        "mainbody": "'''Kohrin Soulez''' was a selfish [[human]] leader of the [[Dallabad Oasis]] located not far from [[Calimport]] in the [[Calim Desert]].",
        "Description": "Kohrin Soulez was a very secretive and isolated man, always keeping himself locked up in his fortress and surrounded by armed guards. Soulez was also very suspicious about any use of magic in his fortress, mostly if it were [[psionics]].",
        "Personality": "Kohrin was a ruthless leader, exploiting his power over the enclosed oasis and the caravans that stopped by the [[Dallabad Oasis]].<ref>",
        "Possessions": "Kohrin Soulez was a wielder of ''[[Charon's Claw (sword)|Charon's Claw]]'' before [[Artemis Entreri]] killed Kohrin by tricking him into grabbing it without the protective [[gauntlet]], thus allowing the evil magic to consume Kohrin. In order to wield the deadly [[blade]], Kohrin had a magical black, red-laced gauntlet that protected him from the vile sword's hunger.",
        "Relationships": "In order for Kohrin Soulez to run Dallabad Oasis, he had five trustworthy lieutenants with him at all times, three of which were his own children, including his daughter [[Ahdahnia Soulez]], and another was [[Preelio]]. A sixth lieutenant that only Soulez's closest commanders knew about was a [[mind flayer]] by the name of [[Yharaskrik]]."
