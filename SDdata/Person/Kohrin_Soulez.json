        "mainbody": "Kohrin Soulez was a selfish human leader of the Dallabad Oasis located not far from Calimport in the Calim Desert.\nKohrin Soulez was a very secretive and isolated man, always keeping himself locked up in his fortress and surrounded by armed guards. Soulez was also very suspicious about any use of magic in his fortress, mostly if it were psionics.\nKohrin was a ruthless leader, exploiting his power over the enclosed oasis and the caravans that stopped by the Dallabad Oasis.\nKohrin Soulez was a wielder of Charons Claw before Artemis Entreri killed Kohrin by tricking him into grabbing it without the protective gauntlet, thus allowing the evil magic to consume Kohrin. In order to wield the deadly blade, Kohrin had a magical black, red-laced gauntlet that protected him from the vile swords hunger.\nIn order for Kohrin Soulez to run Dallabad Oasis, he had five trustworthy lieutenants with him at all times, three of which were his own children, including his daughter Ahdahnia Soulez, and another was Preelio. A sixth lieutenant that only Soulezs closest commanders knew about was a mind flayer by the name of Yharaskrik."
