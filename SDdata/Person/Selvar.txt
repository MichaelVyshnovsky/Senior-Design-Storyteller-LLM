Selvar was a skilled mage from Taruin in Samarach who lived some time before the 14 century DR.
Selvar developed a feud with another mage named Phelpar of Rassatan. Phelpar initially got the upper hand on Selvar and polymorphed him into a frog for several years, during which time Phelpar stole all of his spells and magic items. But Selvar was determined to get his revenge and hopped his way for many miles across Samarach to the mountains where he had hidden a magical cache. He was able to regain his normal form because of the magic stored here.
Selvar was eventually able to trap Phelpar with his magic and gave him a taste of his own medicine by polymorphing him into a horse which he rode to death. He then used his magic to speak with Phelpars corpse to find the location of his lost stolen magic. He traveled to a tomb in the Rathgaunt Hills along the southern edge of the Shaar. He collected his lost work and penned Selvars Ineffable Conjurations, Magicks, and Phantasms, a book of spells. Before his death Selvar gave the work to a young woman named Ilistar who would later become an apprentice of Khelben Arunsun.
