'''Selvar''' was a skilled [[mage]] from [[Taruin]] in [[Samarach]] who lived some time before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Selvar developed a feud with another mage named [[Phelpar]] of [[Rassatan]]. Phelpar initially got the upper hand on Selvar and ''[[polymorph]]ed'' him into a [[frog]] for several years, during which time Phelpar stole all of his [[spell]]s and [[magic item]]s. But Selvar was determined to get his revenge and hopped his way for many miles across Samarach to the mountains where he had hidden a magical cache. He was able to regain his normal form because of the [[magic]] stored here.

Selvar was eventually able to trap Phelpar with his magic and gave him a taste of his own medicine by ''polymorphing'' him into a [[horse]] which he rode to death. He then used his magic to speak with Phelpar's corpse to find the location of his lost stolen magic. He traveled to a tomb in the [[Rathgaunt Hills]] along the southern edge of the [[Shaar]]. He collected his lost work and penned ''[[Selvar's Ineffable Conjurations, Magicks, and Phantasms]]'', a book of spells. Before his death Selvar gave the work to a young woman named [[Ilistar]] who would later become an apprentice of [[Khelben Arunsun]].
