        "mainbody": "'''Kal'dir''' was the most powerful lieutenant of the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] in [[Skullport]] in [[1479 DR]].",
        "History": "Originally Kal'dir was a noble in an unknown [[drow]] city, but his House was totally destroyed and only he survived. Without allies or resources, Kal'dir wandered for a while in the [[Underdark]] until he met a [[beholder]] cluster. He was [[charm]]ed to serve them.\n\nIn 1479 DR, he willingly became their emissary to [[Waterdeep]] in order to help the new [[Xanathar]], [[Zushaxx]], to establish himself as the new Xanathar. Kal'dir assassinated all the previous lieutenants of the guild. Zushaxx quickly affirmed his rule and Kal'dir was chosen as one of the new lieutenants.[[Derek Myers]]. \"The Xanathar: Beholder Crime Lord of Waterdeep.\" ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #206. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, September 2012.",
        "Activities": "Kal'dir supervised all the guild's activities involving the use of violence: assassinations, extortions, blackmail, and enforcement. He was brutal but efficient. Under Zushaxx's orders, he fomented strife among the other lieutenants.",
        "Personality": "Kal'dir was naturally charismatic, with a talent for scheming. However, he preferred to remain silent and alone with himself. Thanks to his drow heritage, Kal'dir deferred to the authority of his female peers.",
        "Residence": "Usually, Kal'dir resided in the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep]] or in the [[Mistshore]] district.",
        "Relationship": "Kal'dir was the most trusted servant of Zushaxx and the only one to know his true identity. In time, he developed feelings for his fellow lieutenant [[Sial Sapphire]].",
