        "mainbody": "During these troubling times, the great Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith assumed leadership over the githzerai and led them to the chaotic plane of Limbo. It was here that the githzerai would find order in such a chaotic realm, and it was here that the githzerai would hone their abilities and harness great power.

It was unknown why Zaerith sent Nrakk to [[Toril]], but the kensai was always dedicated to the cause of his party.",
        "Description": "Menyar-Ag-Gith was a being of \"unimaginable [[arcane]] and [[psionic]] power\", and he was able to perform miraculous magical feats. As such, the deity-king was able to transcend the constraints of the mortal coil, and his lifespan was greatly extended. Due to his mastery of the mind, Zaerith remained in a static, unmoving state. In [[Limbo]], he appeared to actually be a [[demigod]].\n\nAccording to [[Mordenkainen]], it was unknown if the deity-king was alive, dead, or in some other state. However, it was known that he was an extraordinary psion who was worshiped and revered by the githzerai.\n\nMenyar-Ag was known to rule over the most notable cities of Limbo, particularly [[Shra'kt'lor]] and the [[Floating City]]. The former settlement was his military seat of power, whilst the latter was his seat of religious power.",
        "Abilities": "Zaerith did not require sleep or rest, and could manifest his psionic energy to instantly command his followers, even across the planes. He could produce eruptions of energy in order to transport his followers, and even entire [[adamantine]] citadels across the planes, as well. Only Menyar-Ag-Gith could produce such enormous bursts of psionic and arcane energy.",
        "Activities": "Under the rulership of Zaerith, the githzerai stood fast against the zealous githyanki, and they put many [[mind flayer]]s to death. The githzerai saw to the needs of their great leader, and he was constantly attended by willing servants.\n{{fq\n|text=Zerthimon does not expect us to wait in patience for his return. Instead, we must pave the way for his efforts, so that we can hasten the coming of our golden age.\n|source=A teaching of Zaerith\n}}\nMenyar-Ag-Gith was foremost in githzerai society, and he commanded both [[anarch]]s and [[zerth]]s alike. Anarchs were chosen by Ag-Gith to command the fortresses of Shra'kt'lor. As such, it became the most well-fortified city in Limbo. Zerths were similar to priests, though they didn't strictly have religion, and instead admired both Zerthimon and Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith. He was known to send his followers across the planes, and even directly to [[Faerûn]].",
        "History": "Aeons ago, the [[Gith (race)|gith]] as a single race escaped their enslavement from the merciless illithids. The gith leader, known as [[Gith]], was to lead her own people down the same dark, [[evil]], and tyrannical path that the mind flayers walked on. Becoming the thing that the gith hated most struck a chord with a gith known as Zerthimon, and he openly proclaimed the evilness of Gith. A great civil war ensued, Zerthimon sacrificed himself, and his followers were free once more.\n{{fq\n|text=We githzerai crave a challenge, so that when Zerthimon returns he shall find us ready. Thus we traveled to howling Limbo to make our new home.|source=A teaching of Zaerith\n}}\nDuring these troubling times, the great Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith assumed leadership over the githzerai and led them to the chaotic plane of Limbo.

It was unknown why Zaerith sent Nrakk to [[Toril]], but the kensai was always dedicated to the cause of his party.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "There were numerous rumors about the githzerai god-king. Some said he had several high [[mage]]s working on a specific task for him: to be able to instantly summon githyanki into the Floating City. Here, the githzerai citizens would punish their evil enemies. A seemingly ridiculous rumor was that he was actually the offspring of a mind flayer and a [[human]], and this was what made him compassionate. However, this appeared completely untrue, as Zaerith actively plotted against the mind flayers, and was not noted anywhere to look like a [[ceremorphosis|ceremorph]]. Despite particularly wild rumors, the githzerai more than thrived under the rule of their immortal deity-king."
