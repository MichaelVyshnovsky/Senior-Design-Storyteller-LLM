'''Belgon Bradaskor''' was a crime lord of [[Scornubel]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Belgon's best horse was [[Flamewind (horse)|Flamewind]].

==Description==
Belgon was quite obese.

==Relationships==
Belgon had a tall wife and a half-dozen daughters. People in his employ and familiar with his position included [[Tornar]], [[Rendilar Bluthlock]], [[Besmer Altuth]], at least one bodyguard, and [[Nesger]]. He was an acquaintance of [[Tessaril Winter]].

==History==
Belgon Bradaskor had been a part of the underworld in Scornubel since approximately {{yearlink|1347}}. The last summer before late {{yearlink|1357}}, almost certainly {{yearlink|1356}}, he had become acquainted with [[Tessaril Winter]], who had sworded [[Ulbegh]]. Between that time and the next year, she informed him that [[Ornrim]] had died, letting him deduce that the person in that position was an impersonator.

Late in the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, Belgon was informed that [[Marlel]]'s ambush for [[Shandril Shessair]] had failed, and that she'd be joining [[Orthil Voldovan]]'s caravan. He arranged for [[Rendilar Bluthlock]] to hire some undesirables from the local criminal element, which would ensure their elimination.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|308|18}}

Soon after, [[Lhaeo]] sent [[Sharantyr]] to find Shandril, and Belgon was named as the first person to seek out in order to find her.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|95|6}} She began by luring in Besmer Altuth, a criminal, who attempted to rob her; after turning the tables on him, she force him to show her the way to Belgon.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|114-115|7}}

Upon meeting him, Sharantyr managed to learn from him that Shandril had left with Orthil Voldovan's caravan. He had a horse and rations delivered to her so she could catch up as soon as possible, but after she left, he sent Tornar after her, with orders to kill her.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|125-133|8}} He was informed some time after of Shandril's immolation and the caravan's destruction by [[Nesger]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|336|19}} Tornar had later agreed to tell him he'd managed to slay Sharantyr, though he hadn't.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|305|17}}
