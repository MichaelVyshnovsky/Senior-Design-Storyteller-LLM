        "mainbody": "'''Olin Foolsgold''' was an [[alchemist]] who lived in the [[Cormyr]]ean village of [[Darkenshield]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nOlin created the ''Formula For Vengeance'', a ritual which could summon vengeance upon the perpetrators of a crime.\n\nWhen Darkenshield was attacked by the [[Twilight Brigade]] during [[Gondegal]]'s war in [[1352 DR]], he hid in the Village Meet with many of the villagers. When it became clear there was no escape, he distributed a poison to the young and elderly that painlessly slew them, then died fighting the raiders.\n\n===References===\n{{Refs}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Alchemists]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants of the Stonelands]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants of Cormyr]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants of Interior Faerûn]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants of Faerûn]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants of Toril]]\noasyvllkp631a4ffwikpcnyag0b0og5"
