'''Erfle "the Venerable One" Carrathal'''  was a High King of [[Callidyrr]] from the midâ€“10{{th}} through the early 11{{th}} centuries [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|33}} Like his predecessor, although he held the title of High King of the [[Moonshae Isles]], he was considered to be merely a figurehead by the [[Ffolk]] outside of Callidyrr.

==Relationships==
He was a member of the [[Carrathal Dynasty]] of Callidyrr and was the first son of his predecessor, High King [[Niall Carrathal|Niall]], who had founded the dynasty. His grandson, [[Alec Carrathal III|Alec III]], would go on to be his successor.

==History==
Erfle assumed the throne in the {{YearlinkName|954}}, after the death of King Niall.

''Circa'' [[982 DR|the twenty-eighth year of his reign]], the famed war captain [[Aeroth of Silverymoon]] and his six sons arrived and settled in the Moonshae Isles.

In [[987 DR|the thirty-third year of his reign]], a [[dwarf|dwarven]] expedition left from the Moonshaes to travel west through the [[Underdark]] beneath the [[Trackless Sea]] to [[Maztica]]. This would end in the [[Rockfire Disaster]].

Erfle ruled for fifty-eight years before dying of natural causes in the {{YearlinkName|1012}}.
