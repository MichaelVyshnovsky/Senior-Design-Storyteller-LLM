}}'''Doryn No-Mouth''' was a male [[human]] and one of the four staff of [[The Rapids]] inn in [[Teshwave]] in [[1367 DR]], working as a stableboy and handyman.

He was a young, fair-faced lad of around 17 years, but he was mute. Doryn was frequently harassed by the [[Zhentilar]] because of his particular condition, and they called him "Doryn No-Mouth". However, he was very observant and had the ability to read and write, a skill that the Zhents were not aware he possessed. [[Tula Woodsbridge]] looked out for him.
