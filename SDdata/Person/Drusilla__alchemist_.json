        "mainbody": "'''Drusilla''' was an eccentric [[alchemist]] who lived in her old houseboat tethered to the [[Fisher's Wharf]] in [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] of [[Baldur's Gate III]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Possessions": "Drusilla's oddly-decorated houseboat was always left behind when the neighboring [[fish]]ing vessels departed early each morning. The entrance to the boat's interior was draped in [[canvas]] and bushels of drying [[herb]]s. The houseboat's interior was filled with boiling concoctions, various fluids, [[book]]s, and other miscellanies.",
        "History": "Several years before the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, Drusilla hired an adventurer-detective named [[Tav]] to track down her lost [[talisman]]. It was the detective's first case, and it ended in success. When a dire murder took place on the nearby [[Sailor's Crossing]] plaza in on [[Kythorn 19]] of [[1477 DR]], Drusilla was interviewed by Tav over a cup of hot [[tea]]. During the interview, Drusilla placed an [[terra cotta]] urn decorated with a cameo of her sister and filled with her remains. Even though [[Cate]] was long dead, Drusilla served her tea with [[honeycomb]] as she liked it in life.\n\nDrusilla told Tav that after a commotion, she witnessed a figure fleeing towards [[Baldur's Gate/Heapside|Heapside]]. She recommended the detective visit the [[Blushing Mermaid]] for information on Baldur's Gate's seedy underbelly. Before parting ways, Drusilla gifted Tav a ''[[potion of invisibility]]''. As the investigator left the aging alchemist's boat, a scream came from the [[Canary Lane]]."
