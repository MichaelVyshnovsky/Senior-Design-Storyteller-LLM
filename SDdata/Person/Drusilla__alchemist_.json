        "mainbody": "rusilla was an eccentric alchemist who lived in her old houseboat tethered to the Fishers Wharf in Eastway of Baldurs Gate III in the late 15 century DR.\nDrusillas oddly-decorated houseboat was always left behind when the neighboring fishing vessels departed early each morning. The entrance to the boats interior was draped in canvas and bushels of drying herbs. The houseboats interior was filled with boiling concoctions, various fluids, books, and other miscellanies.\nSeveral years before the , Drusilla hired an adventurer-detective named Tav to track down her lost talisman. It was the detectives first case, and it ended in success. When a dire murder took place on the nearby Sailors Crossing plaza in on Kythorn 19 of 1477 DR, Drusilla was interviewed by Tav over a cup of hot tea. During the interview, Drusilla placed an terra cotta urn decorated with a cameo of her sister and filled with her remains. Even though Cate was long dead, Drusilla served her tea with honeycomb as she liked it in life.\nDrusilla told Tav that after a commotion, she witnessed a figure fleeing towards Heapside. She recommended the detective visit the Blushing Mermaid for information on Baldurs Gates seedy underbelly. Before parting ways, Drusilla gifted Tav a potion of invisibility. As the investigator left the aging alchemists boat, a scream came from the Canary Lane."
