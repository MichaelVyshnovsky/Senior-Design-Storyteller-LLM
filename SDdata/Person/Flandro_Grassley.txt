'''Flandro "Tarrasque-Biter" Grassley''' was an inhabitant of [[Baldur's Gate]] who died some years before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Flandro was a hunter who died sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. He was buried in the [[Lower City Graveyard]], next to the [[Hhune Mausoleum]]. The gravestone was etched with a single inscription: "Flandro 'Tarrasque-Biter' Grassley - The hunter hunted, the biter bit." The hunter's grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and the body risen as a [[zombie]] by [[Nina Dortmell]], a talented child with a [[gift]], who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother.
