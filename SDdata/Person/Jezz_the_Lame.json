        "mainbody": "'''Jezz the Lame''' was one of the leaders of the [[Vhaeraun]]-worshiping [[House Jaelre]], commanding the [[drow]] of his house who warred with the [[elf|elves]] of [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "Jezz had smooth, black skin and pale white hair. He was slightly shorter and slimmer than a human. He wore supple black [[leather armor]] and carried an exotic-looking [[kukri]]. He also wore a green asp around his arm. His right leg was lame and held in a leather and iron brace/harness, which he limped around in, giving him the nickname \"Jezz the Lame.\"",
        "Personality": "Given his charisma and the respect his followers give him, if House Jaelre gained a foothold in [[Cormanthor]], Jezz was to be presented as a speaker to the outside world. He was involved in dealing with the tenuous alliance with the [[Clan Auzkovyn]] as well.",
        "History": "Jezz was once a scout for his tribe as they wandered the [[Underdark]] after leaving their home city of [[Menzoberranzan]]. At one point, he got into a fight with an [[umber hulk]], which resulted in the cavern ceiling coming crashing down. Believing Jezz was slain, his company left. But Jezz had survived, and he dragged himself back to their camp, finally arriving a [[tenday]] later. A [[cleric]] was able to set his leg, but had to snap the already-healing bones to put them in their proper places. The injury continued to pain him occasionally, and he had to wear a special brace and shoe that allowed him to walk more easily.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], Jezz assisted a group of Menzoberranyr drow led by [[Quenthel Baenre]] in retrieving the ''[[Geildirion of Cimbar]]'', a book of lore, from a [[beholder]]'s lair in [[Myth Drannor]].\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], Jezz was sent as an emissary from the [[Masked Brigades]] to the [[Zhentarim]] who occupy [[Shadowdale]] at the time of the [[Cormanthor War]]. He remained in the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]], hoping to learn more about House Jaelre's current allies. That same year Jezz also served as an emissary to the [[daemonfey]] army of [[Sarya Dlardrageth]] in an abandoned keep south of Myth Drannor."
