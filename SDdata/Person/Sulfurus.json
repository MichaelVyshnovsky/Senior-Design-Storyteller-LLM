        "mainbody": "ulfurus was a conniving young black dragon who made himself a lair in a cave under an old dried up well in the Western Farmlands outside of Daggerford circa 1372 DR.\nSulfurus was a relatively young black dragon. However, despite his age, Sulfurus was a dangerous opponent, evident from a fine mist of acid droplets that left his mouth with every breath.\nSulfurus was an evil creature who enjoyed devouring adventurers foolish enough to venture into its lair. His feeling of superiority made him vulnerable to flattery but did not protect his guests from becoming a meal.\nSulfurus possessed all abilities of his kin, including true seeing, making it virtually impossible to sneak past him. Magic resistance made him especially dangerous to spellcasters, as well as resistance to normal damage, acid damage, and immunity to paralysis and mind-affecting magic.\nThe black dragon was aware of Gorgomorzs vendetta against Daggerford, and he claimed that the devil was allied with a certain lizardfolk shaman from the Lizard Marsh in order to achieve his goals. Sulfurus, however, considered devils and their endless vendettas silly and amusing.\nSulfurus had a small horde accumulated in his lair under the Western Farmlands. It mostly consisted of gemstones and gold.\nApart from compulsive desire to collect gold, Sulfurus collected bones of his victims.\nSometime before 1372 DR, Sulfurus found an entrance into the cave that used to be the bottom of an old well that dried up a long time ago. The underwater tunnel stretched from the Lizard Marsh into the cavern. Still, most other creatures would not be capable of traveling via the cave between locations, apart from Sulfurus himself of an extremely capable swimmer. The cavern eventually became the black dragons lair and housed its hoard. Sulfurus, like many of his kin, had a strong fondness for gold, so creating a lair under a well-known wishing well was a given, with a constant stream of coins being tossed straight into the hoard. During this time underneath the Western Farmlands, the dragon found the old bones of a famous adventurer and a hero, Peredus the Great. Sulfurus desecrated the heros final resting place, creating an unholy bound, cursing him to be chained to the Prime Material plane as a tortured spectre.\nLuckily for Sulfurus, a halfling rogue Burnas Tellrot discovered Pereduss grave and started sending adventurers into the well to recover the fabled Sword of Peredus only to become the black dragons food. One such adventurer was Dalia, a sailor of the Mariners Alliance. She survived the dragons lair by sneaking past the hungry beast and swimming through the tunnel into the Lizard Marsh.\nThe next unlucky adventurer who agreed to help Burnas Tellrot was the Hero of Daggerford. The adventurer and their companions reached the cruel wyrm but bested him in battle. When defeated, Sulfurus conceded his superiority to the champion and pleaded for his life. Whatever Sulfuruss fate was, the hero managed to find a way out of the lair back to the surface. Some said the black dragon was left alive to grow its bone collection."
