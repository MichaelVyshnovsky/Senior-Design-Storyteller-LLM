        "Activities": "Flambos enjoyed exploring the various [[tavern]]s and [[inn]]s, both lavish and squalid, within the entire expanse of Waterdeep. He roamed the [[High Moor]], ridding the area of wicked creatures until he required supplies or healing, at which point he returned to the City of Splendors. He would offer his [[sword]] or services as a guide to kindly travelers for 1 [[sp]] per day and a share of any treasure acquired during their adventures. Flambos tithed a fair amount of treasure to the shrine of Mielikki in Waterdeep.",
        "Possessions": "He wielded a [[longsword]], [[battleaxe]], and [[longbow]]."
