        "mainbody": "Flambos Axemaster was a ranger and follower of Mielikki inhabiting Waterdeep, City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nFlambos enjoyed exploring the various taverns and inns, both lavish and squalid, within the entire expanse of Waterdeep. He roamed the High Moor, ridding the area of wicked creatures until he required supplies or healing, at which point he returned to the City of Splendors. He would offer his sword or services as a guide to kindly travelers for 1 sp per day and a share of any treasure acquired during their adventures. Flambos tithed a fair amount of treasure to the shrine of Mielikki in Waterdeep.\nHe wielded a longsword, battleaxe, and longbow."
