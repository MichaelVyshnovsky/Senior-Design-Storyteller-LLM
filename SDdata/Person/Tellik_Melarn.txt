'''Tellik Melarn''' was a [[drow]] priest of [[Vhaeraun]], known as a Nightshadow, and a member of [[House Melarn (Ched Nasad)|House Melarn]] in [[Ched Nasad]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationship==
Tellik was the younger brother of [[Q'arlynd Melarn]].

==History==
Tellik was a cleric of Vhaeraun and invited his brother to attend a meeting of fellow members of the [[church of Vhaeraun]].

At some point, he made a major transgression against his faith by impersonating his god's [[avatar]]. He was punished for it by the [[illusion]] being made permanent and so he couldn't hide it, which was dangerous because it would have revealed his link to the church of Vhaeraun for everyone in the [[Lolth]]-dominated city of Ched Nasad.

He came to his brother, who was a [[wizard]], and begged him for help. Q'arlynd wasn't able to lift the curse, owing to his lack of skill. So he proposed to turn Tellik invisible to allow his escape out of the city. But instead of turning him invisible, Q'arlynd made his brother unconscious and sold him to his mother, [[Drisinil Melarn]], as a traitor for sacrifice to Lolth. He was rewarded for his loyalty to Lolth by being allowed to attend his brother's sacrifice as a spectator. Tellik died painfully over a long period of time while being gradually cut into little pieces. Q'arlynd would come to regret not giving him a quick and simple death.
