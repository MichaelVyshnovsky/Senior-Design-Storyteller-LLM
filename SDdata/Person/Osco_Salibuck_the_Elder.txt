Osco Salibuck the Elder was a male halfling and an associate of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, and the ancestor of Osco Salibuck.
He had a statue honoring his service to Khelben in Blackstaff Tower. His statue had a rather unpleasant expression, long hair, and carried a small scimitar. His ghost was impersonated by the ghost of Khelben in order to test young Osco Salibuck.
