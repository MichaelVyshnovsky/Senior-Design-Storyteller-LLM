'''Nizidramanii'yt''' was a [[black dragon]] of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who allied with [[Jon Irenicus]].

==History==
Nizidramanii'yt joined with Jon Irenicus to attack [[Suldanessellar]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. Once there, the dragon guarded the [[Goblet of Life]] to prevent anyone from following Irenicus to the [[Tree of Life]].

Thus, [[Abdel Adrian]] and companions had to face Nizidramanii'yt and acquire the Goblet. They could fight or bargain for the Goblet, but the dragon would only give it for all of their treasure—both [[gold]] and [[magic item]]s—whilst lying that he had no other treasure himself.
