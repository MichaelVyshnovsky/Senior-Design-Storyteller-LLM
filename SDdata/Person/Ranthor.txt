Ranthor was a human wizard and master of Shal Bal who lived in Cormyr.
Being a wizard, Ranthor liked to dress in fine clothes and keep his appearance in good order many of his robes were blue, which was his signature color.
As a teacher, Ranthor was kind and giving, always providing his students with positive encouragement and motivation.
After his death, Ranthor left Shal all his personal items, including a staff of power, a cloth of many pockets, a ring of three wishes, a wand of wonder, and his familiar, Cerulean.
Around 1337 DR, Ranthor took Shal Bal as an apprentice, even though she had no gold nor demonstrated any magical gift. In Flamerule 24, 1340 DR, Ranthor traveled to Phlan to aid a fellow wizard, Denlor.
While communicating with Shal through a crystal ball, Ranthor was stabbed from behind by a dark dagger wielded by an unknown killer who wore a strange serpent-headed armlet.
