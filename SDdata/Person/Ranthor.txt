'''Ranthor''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]] and master of [[Shal Desanea|Shal Bal]] who lived in [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
Being a wizard, Ranthor liked to dress in fine clothes and keep his appearance in good order; many of his robes were blue, which was his signature color.

==Personality==

As a teacher, Ranthor was kind and giving, always providing his students with positive encouragement and motivation.

==Possessions==
After his death, Ranthor left Shal all his personal items, including a [[staff of power]], a [[cloth of many pockets]], a [[ring of three wishes]], a [[wand of wonder]], and his [[familiar]], [[Cerulean]].

==History==
Around [[1337 DR]], Ranthor took Shal Bal as an apprentice, even though she had no gold nor demonstrated any magical gift. In [[Flamerule]] 24, [[1340 DR]], Ranthor traveled to [[Phlan]] to aid a fellow wizard, [[Denlor]].

===Death===
While communicating with Shal through a [[crystal ball]], Ranthor was stabbed from behind by a dark [[dagger]] wielded by an unknown killer who wore a strange serpent-headed armlet.
