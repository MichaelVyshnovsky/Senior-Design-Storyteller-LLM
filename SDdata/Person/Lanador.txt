'''Lanador''' was a slaver in [[Skullport]] in the mid-to-late 14th century [[DR]].[[Derek Myers]]. "Eyes on The Ball." ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #206. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, September 2012.

==Activities==
Lanador managed a slaving ring composed by many [[minotaur]]s in [[Skullport]]. He often used small mercenary companies like the [[Unyielding Sword]] to obtain slaves for interested buyers.

==History==
Lanador originally was a captain in the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] of [[Waterdeep]]. However, in [[1369 DR]], it was discovered that he was using his position to help the [[Shadow Thieves]] to regain a foothold in the city. Quickly the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] had him captured and imprisoned. In prison, Lanador betrayed the Shadow Thieves by aiding the capture of many of their number in Waterdeep.

In [[1372 DR]], he exited the prison and went into hiding, pursued by Shadow Thieves assassins. He relocated to a fortified lair in [[Skullport]], resorting to slaving for profit.

In [[1379 DR]], Lanador was hired by the [[drow]] [[Tezzarq]] to procure ten [[elf]] slaves. He hired the [[Unyielding Sword]] to kidnap them from [[Waterdeep]]'s streets. Unfortunately, one of them was, unknown to them, an [[Agents of the Eye|Agent of the Eye]]. So the [[Xanathar]] supported an adventuring party hired by the City Watch to enter Lanador's lair. Lanador was found in the central room of the lair in the fighting he was defeated.

==Personality==
Lanador lived in paranoia of the Shadow Thieves assassins. He never willingly did anything to draw the anger of the Xanathar. He had few diplomatic skills, always blaming others for his failures.

==Relationship==
Lanador maintained a profitable partnership with [[Eldreth Zanderraum]], the [[undead]] leader of the Unyielding Sword. His right-hand was the [[minotaur]] magus [[Grody]].
