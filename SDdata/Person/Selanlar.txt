Selanlar was an elf from tribe Tethir who was the grandfather of the first queen of Tethyr.
Selanlars daughter was married to the chieftain of human Clan Tarseth. His eldest granddaughter through that pairing was Saraala Tarseth, who married King Darrom Ithal.
Before he became king, Darrom Ithal and his father, Chieftain Clovis Ithal of Clan Ithal, forged an alliance with Selanlar and the Tethir elves to fight with them against the might of the Calimshan empire. Selanlar and the Tethir elves planned with the two Ithal humans and the other Tethyrian clans for six months before finally waging war, beginning with an attack first to retake Ithmong in  and then Myratma nine years later in . These two major victories resulted in independence for Tethyr and the crowing of Darrom as king.
The year after his coronation, Darrom married Selanlars granddaughter Saraala, leading to further unity between elves and humans in the land.
