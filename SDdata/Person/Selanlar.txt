'''Selanlar''' was an [[elf]] from tribe [[Tethir (tribe)|Tethir]] who was the grandfather of the [[Saraala Ithal|first queen]] of [[Tethyr]].

==Relationships==
Selanlar's daughter was married to the chieftain of [[human]] [[Clan Tarseth]]. His eldest granddaughter through that pairing was [[Saraala Ithal|Saraala Tarseth]], who married King [[Darrom Ithal]].

==History==
Before he became king, Darrom Ithal and his father, Chieftain [[Clovis Ithal II (chieftain)|Clovis Ithal]] of [[Clan Ithal]], forged an alliance with Selanlar and the Tethir elves to fight with them against the might of the [[Calimshan]] empire. Selanlar and the Tethir elves planned with the two Ithal humans and the other [[Tethyrian]] clans for six months before finally waging war, beginning with an attack first to retake [[Ithmong]] in {{Yearlink|-221}} and then [[Myratma]] nine years later in {{Yearlink|-212}}. These two major victories resulted in independence for Tethyr and the crowing of Darrom as king.

The year after his coronation, Darrom married Selanlar's granddaughter Saraala, leading to further unity between elves and humans in the land.
