'''Lieshann''' was a [[minstrel]] from the city of [[Ordulin]] in [[Sembia]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|26}}

==Activities==
In the late 1350s DR, Lieshann journeyed around the [[Dragon Reach]] and through [[the Vast]], singing in taverns and inns.

==History==
Once, Lieshann was traveling from [[Tavilar]] to [[Kurth (town)|Kurth]] in the Vast. However, she took the wrong trail and came upon the mysterious [[Mage's Tower]] that stood on the edge of the [[Flooded Forest]]. She only saw it from a distance, however, and left. Afterwards, by the late 1350s DR, Lieshann regularly sang about the mysterious tower, telling that it was an entrance to the lair or underground kingdom of a [[gold dragon]] or some other, even more powerful [[wyrm]]. According to her, this dragon shapechanged into another form to enter and descend to the subterranean realm. However, those who'd actually managed to enter the tower called this story "bardish moonshine". Lieshann admitted she'd only seen it from a distance, but still sang her version of the story.
