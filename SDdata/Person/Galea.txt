'''Galea''' was an [[elf|elven]] [[paladin]] and [[adventurer]] on the [[Sword Coast]].

==Personality==
Galea's motivation for adventuring was to better the world and to gain prestige. She believed that joy and love were precious things that should be fostered in an often too-dark world, and had taken the paladin [[Oath of the Ancients]] in this pursuit. She was fond of art, music, beauty, and merrymaking, because she felt these things could engender hope, life, and light during dark times.

==Relationships==
She was part of an adventuring troupe with the [[tiefling]] [[warlock]] [[Prosper]], the [[human]] [[wizard]] [[Sefris]], and the [[dragonborn]] [[barbarian]] [[Vrondiss]].
