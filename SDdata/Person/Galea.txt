Galea was an elven paladin and adventurer on the Sword Coast.
Galeas motivation for adventuring was to better the world and to gain prestige. She believed that joy and love were precious things that should be fostered in an often too-dark world, and had taken the paladin Oath of the Ancients in this pursuit. She was fond of art, music, beauty, and merrymaking, because she felt these things could engender hope, life, and light during dark times.
She was part of an adventuring troupe with the tiefling warlock Prosper, the human wizard Sefris, and the dragonborn barbarian Vrondiss.
