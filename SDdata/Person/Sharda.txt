'''Sharda''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]] Sharda and her fellow cultist [[Tau]], mounted on [[bulette]]s, went to the spirit mound of [[One Stone]] in order to claim the [[giant]] relic there in the name of [[Ogrémoch]].
