'''Taharak''' was once a powerful warrior among the [[drow]] of [[Maerimydra]] in life, before rising as a [[ghost]] after his death.

==Description==
Taharak cut an impressive figure in his [[plate mail|full plate armor]], even more so when wearing his leering skull helm and astride his [[Nightmare (creature)|nightmare]] steed. In battle, Taharak wielded a [[spiked chain]].

==History==
Before his death, Taharak fought for [[Lolth]]. However, after dying he took up the cause of [[Kiaransalee]], rising anew as a deadly ghostly champion.

During [[Lolth's Silence]] in Maerimydra, the rising cult of Kiaransalee there put him to work as a scout, collecting the corpses of the fallen and bringing them back to [[Castle Maerimydra]] for reanimation by [[Irae T'sarran]]'s servants.
