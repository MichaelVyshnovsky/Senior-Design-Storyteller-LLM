Inwe was a druid and a member of the circle that dwelled in the Emerald Grove during the late 15 century DR.
Inwe served alongside Aelar, Karrik, Tahan and others under Archdruid Halsin.
In the , Archdruid Halsin departed the grove for a time to investigate the whereabouts of the Nightsong a mysterious artifact that he believed was hidden beneath the nearby Shattered Sanctum. After he left, the druid Kagha took over leadership of the Emerald Grove and tasked Inwe and the other druids with performing the Rite of Thorns. This ritual would disguise the location of the grove from outsiders and prevent anyone else like Elturian tiefling refugees from threatening its wellbeing. Inwe felt pride at being among the druids chosen to before the rite.
