        "Description": "As of 1367 Lelia's blue eyes sparkled with the vigor of youth. Her long, curly hair nearly touched the floor.",
        "Personality": "Lelia's melodious voice was said to charm stars down from the sky.",
        "Activities": "Imam Lelia oversaw over 200 priests of [[Selan]], clerical brethren, and laymen.\n\nLeila orchestrated a unique project where she attempted to create a grand work of art for the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] for his [[Ascension Day]] celebration. Included in the project were her associates from the mosque, [[sha'ir]]s, and other hired mages. Her goal was to create a crystal [[rose]] bush that would yield real roses, fruit, or valuable [[gem]]s whenever the Grand Caliph wished. The enchantments involved were difficult, and some of the items needed were exceedingly rare, including a large [[emerald]] from [[Shou Lung]], so Lelia hired others to perform much of the required footwork.\n\nIn order to prevent panic when she viewed a dire portent in the stars, Lelia often privately hired adventurers to deal with whatever malign situation presented itself in her visions.",
        "Possessions": "Imam Lelia owned a ''[[ring of shooting stars]]'', a ''[[rod of splendor]]'', an ''[[cloak of protection|aba of protection]]'', and some ''[[eyes of the eagle]]'' in addition to numerous magical [[scroll]]s."
