        "mainbody": "'''Lowa''' was a member of the [[Gondian]] clergy and a foundry worker from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|He's not – yes, Overseer Holzt. He's frail in body and mind – like me, like all of us. Yet by your grace he lives.|Lowa}}",
        "Description": "Lowa was a [[rock gnome]] woman with a light skin tone, light brown eyes, and long light brown hair. She wore a foundry worker's uniform and a smith's apron, often covered in soot, dirt, and sweat.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Gondian foundry of Baldur's Gate was taken over by [[Enver Gortash]] and his [[cultists of Bane]]. Lowa and other Gondians were forced to work on forging the lord's [[steel watcher]]s. Their families and loved ones were abducted and held hostage to encourage obedience, and all of the workers were outfitted with ''[[incineration collar]]s''  controlled by ''[[Prinski's Motivator]]s.''\n\nDuring the [[Absolute crisis]], Lowa took on a position as the outspoken leader amongst her group of workers enslaved by the Church of Bane and the [[Absolute]]. She voiced her frustration with the Banites pushing the workers to the brink, forcing them to assemble steel watchers day and night. Lowa stood up to Black Gauntlet [[Tamia Holzt]], stating that the watchers' gyronetics required workers with steady hands and sharp eyes, not exhausted slaves with trembling muscles. Lowa demanded rest from her captors but was reminded of her son, who was held hostage underwater at the sunken [[Iron Throne headquarters]]. Faced with the threat of her own death and the death of her son, Lowa promised to finish the steel watchers by the first light of dawn.\n\nThe fate of the Gondians remained unconfirmed. All of the hostages and foundry workers could perish or be saved along with their loved ones by the group of heroes known as the [[Absolute Adversaries]]."
