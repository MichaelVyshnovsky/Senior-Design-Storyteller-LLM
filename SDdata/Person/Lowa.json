She voiced her frustration with the Banites pushing the workers to the brink, forcing them to assemble steel watchers day and night. Lowa stood up to Black Gauntlet Tamia Holzt, stating that the watchers gyronetics required workers with steady hands and sharp eyes, not exhausted slaves with trembling muscles. Lowa demanded rest from her captors but was reminded of her son, who was held hostage underwater at the sunken Iron Throne headquarters. Faced with the threat of her own death and the death of her son, Lowa promised to finish the steel watchers by the first light of dawn.\nThe fate of the Gondians remained unconfirmed. All of the hostages and foundry workers could perish or be saved along with their loved ones by the group of heroes known as the Absolute Adversaries."
