'''River Mist''' was a [[tabaxi]] guide that worked out of [[Port Nyanzaru]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She worked alongside her brother, [[Flask of Wine]] both as guides and assets of the [[Zhentarim]].

==Appearance==
River Mist only had one eye as she lost the other in a mishap as a child. She was 5'5" (1.7 meters) tall and 100 pounds (45.4 kg).

==Personality==
River was more comfortable in the jungles of Chult and could not abide the crowded streets of Port Nyanzaru.

==Activities==
River and Flask charged their clients 4 [[gp]] a day as guides, but offered to waive their fees for a share of any treasure they found.

Due to their allegiance with the Zhentarim, River did not have to offer payments to the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru.
