        "mainbody": "'''{{PAGENAME}}''' was once the owner of the [[Whistling Wizard]] inn located in [[Voonlar]] until his untimely and premeditated death just after winter had arrived in the [[1356 DR|Year of the Worm, 1356 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|33}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 28: The Recent and Colorful History of the Wizard}}",
        "Description": "Ansilber was a corpulent man with droopy features that made it look like he was half asleep most of the time.",
        "Personality": "He was a lazy man who enjoyed ordering others about. He had a cruel nature but did not seem to take pleasure in it. Rather, he wanted others to suffer instead of himself.",
        "History": "Ansilber was a tailor in [[Essembra]] before he moved to Voonlar and purchased the Wizard, perhaps from the famed mage [[Casimur]]. During his tenure at the Wizard, he was the boss of a magically tethered [[Dove Falconhand|Dove Silverhand]], who was disguised and played the role of serving wench. She was released by her soon-to-be husband, [[Florin Falconhand]] before the winter of 1356 set in. Within a month or two of her rescue, Ansilber was gruesomely murdered in his own common room; dismembered. Few mourned his passing and the hasty investigation by the local authorities turned up no suspects. Not even a [[tenday]] passed before the new owner, [[Ravvas Thurrpurtyn]] took over the inn."
