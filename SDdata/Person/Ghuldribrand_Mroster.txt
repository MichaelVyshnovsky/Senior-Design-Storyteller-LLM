==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1353}}, Ghuldribrand provided a number of quotes on the [[Border Kingdoms]] to [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. Though there was some macabre reminiscing about [[Manywaters]],{{Cite polyhedron/140/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|12}}{{Cite polyhedron/143/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|29}} [[Middle Mukshar]]{{Cite polyhedron/134/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|8}}, [[Nether Mukshar]]{{Cite polyhedron/137/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|8}} and [[the Neth Stand]],{{Cite polyhedron/136/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|8}} and cryptic warnings about [[Oeble]]{{Cite polyhedron/138/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|8}} and [[Myrinjar]],{{Cite polyhedron/135/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|8}} Ghuldribrand was most effusive on [[Owlhold]], praising the fighters there and their potential, albeit making a jab at their roads.{{Cite polyhedron/146/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|42}}{{Cite polyhedron/147/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|42}}{{Cite polyhedron/148/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|46}}
