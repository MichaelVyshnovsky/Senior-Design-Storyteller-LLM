        "mainbody": "Bartley was a shopkeeper in Baldurs Gate around 1372 DR.\nBartley was a crusty old drunkard with a deep voice.\nBartley set up his store inside the Elfsong Tavern with the permission of its owner, Alyth Elendara.\nWhen the adventurers Adrianna, Vahn, and Kromlech first spoke with Bartley there, he opened with business news. As the heroes visited his shop, Bartley boasted of keeping equipment crafted by the dwarves of the Sunset Mountains. As the adventures returned to his shop periodically, Bartley would say various things about the heroes missions or would often offer different sales pitches.\nSoon after Adrianna and her fellow adventurers disappeared, Bartley began doing business with a group of six new heroes who helped Randalla Brasshorn, Bartleys acquaintance. During that time he also hired a goodly dwarven artisan â€“ Durbem, who repaired and worked on custom-made equipment for Bartleys customers."
