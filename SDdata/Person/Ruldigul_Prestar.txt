Ruldigul Prestar was an innkeep inhabiting Suldolphor in the far eastern reaches of Calimshan in south Faer√ªn during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Ruldigul was the proprietor of the popular Bright Shield Inn located in southwest Suldolphor. He maintained a school to train his extensive staff for the many services the Bright Shield Inn provided.
It was whispered the Ruldigul was actually a disguised mind flayer, or at least was in contact with the illithids.
