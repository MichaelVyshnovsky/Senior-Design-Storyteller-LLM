        "mainbody": "'''Gaedynn Ulraes''' was a warrior and an officer in the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] mercenary company in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was primarily known for his superb markmanship as an archer.",
        "History": "Gaedynn was from minor nobility and spent most of his youth as a hostage of the [[elves]] of the [[Yuirwood]], who taught him archery and woodcraft.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, he participated in the Brotherhood's war with [[Szass Tam]] and traveled with [[Aoth Fezim]] to [[Chessenta]]. After the Brotherhood foiled a plot by [[abishai]] to murder residents of [[Luthcheq]] and pin the killings on [[mage]]s, Gaedynn was assigned to travel to [[Threskel]] with [[Jhesrhi Coldcreek]] to investigate rumors of an ancient [[red dragon]] in the [[Sky Riders]] mountains.\n\nThere, Gaedynn and Jhesri were captured by [[Alasklerbanbastos]]'s minions and taken to [[Mount Thulbane]]. They later escaped and continued on to the Sky Riders. There, they traveled through a planar rift to the [[Shadowfell]], where they found [[Tchazzar]] imprisoned by a [[blight wyrm]]. Jhesrhi freed Tchazzar and they traveled back to Luthcheq, where Tchazzar reclaimed his throne.\n\nGaedynn fought bravely in Chessenta's war with Threskel, leading the counter-attack that broke the siege of [[Soolabax]] and then fighting in the two battles that resulted in Alasklerbanbastos's defeat by Tchazzar.\n\nHe then traveled with Aoth and [[Cera Eurthos]] to [[Akanûl]] on a mission to convince the Akanûlans not to join Chessenta in a war against [[Tymanther]]. In order to convince Queen [[Arathane]] that the [[dragonborn]] were not the ones responsible for attacks on villages and caravans, the Brotherhood and allied [[genasi]] journeyed to the lair of the [[gray dragon]] [[Vairshekellabex]], killed him, and retrieved documents proving that clergy of [[Tiamat]] were responsible.\n\nGaedynn returned to Chessenta with Aoth. He narrowly escaped death when Tchazzar discovered the Brotherhood's plotting and attempted to kill him while he was asleep with a common tart. Jhesrhi magically whisked him out of his room and flew him naked on the wind back to the Brotherhood's encampment outside Luthcheq. After he dressed himself for battle, he fought in the [[Battle of Luthcheq]], helping to defeat Tchazzar and Alasklerbanbastos.",
        "Relationships": "Gaedynn and Jhesrhi shared a common affection but, due to her fear of the touch of another sentient creature, their feelings never bloomed into romance.\n\nHe was also the grandson of Aoth Fezim.",
        "Description": "Gaedynn was lanky and had shoulder-length reddish hair.",
        "Personality": "Gaedynn was intelligent and extremely cocky. He seemed to have a wisecrack for every situation. In spite of his fondness for Jhesrhi, he was quite a womanizer.",
        "Religion": "Although Gaedynn didn't appear to have strong faith in any gods, he sometimes called on the aid of [[Seldarine|elven deities]] such as [[Corellon]].",
        "Equipment": "Gaedynn carried an enchanted bow and wore [[brigandine]] armor. He flew the [[griffon]] [[Eider]] into battle."
