'''Glorghakt''' was a [[mind flayer]] envoy from [[Ryxyg]] in the [[Deep Wastes]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, the illithids of Ryxyg discovered that the [[fire giant]]s of [[Maerimydra]] had built devastating arcane [[siege engine]]s that they were planning to use against [[Hillsfar]] and [[Elventree]]. However, the mind flayers also discovered a means to disable those engines in secret from afar.{{Cite adventurers league/Writhing in the Dark|4-7}}

Thus, Glorghakt asked to meet a representative of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] in the [[myconid]] settlement of [[Sporedome]]. There, it explained that it wanted an adventuring party find and kill a rogue mind flayer [[warlock]] who'd allied itself with the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]] and was hidden in a place full of madness-infected ''[[faerzress]]''. In exchange, it offered to destroy the engines of the giants.

==Personality==
Glorghakt was driven by disturbing knowledge of both the surface world and the future. Only his closest confidants could use its full name. Glorghakt was very direct and matter-of-fact, never hiding information but only yielding it to those it deemed worthy.
 
==Relationship==
[[Xicvizt]] and Glorghakt were spawned from the same pool.{{Cite adventurers league/Writhing in the Dark|16}}
