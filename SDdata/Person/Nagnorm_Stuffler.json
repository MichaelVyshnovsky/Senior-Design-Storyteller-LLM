The gnome's dream was to open a grand museum – \"Stuffleronus,\" in [[Waterdeep]], for all to come and see his stuffed animals. In 1372 DR, Nagnorm purchased a [[pinguin]], or as he so eloquently put it – a \"remarkable bird-like animal,\" from a traveling merchant for a mere five [[gp]].

The penguin attempted to explain that it was really a [[druid]] of the [[Brush of Barbs]] circle.

The eccentric man refused to acknowledge the penguin as anything but a beast, despite the bird introducing itself and calling for help in human words. After a prolonged negotiation, the Hero, along with Urith, managed to convince the strange gnome that he was not a penguin but a royal emissary from the Pengu-een Empire to [[Baldur's Gate]] and that imprisonment and murder of Urith would cause war and countless deaths. This outlandish tale was somehow more believable to Nagnorm, and after much deliberation, Urith was set free to be returned back to the Brush of Barbs.",
        "Description": "Nagnorm had an impressive [[wax]]ed sharp-ended red mustache and well-manicured nails. His face looked fairly emaciated.",
        "Personality": "Being a bizarre character, Nagnorm talked with his stuffed possessions, preferring the company of dead animals to that of the living beasts or [[humanoid]]s. When confronted with stuffing living animals, the gnome declared that they enjoyed it, apart from some mild complaining when he opened them up.",
        "Possessions": "Nagnorm's home was a secluded cottage on the northeastern end of the hamlet. He carried a ''[[taxidermy knife]]'' he used to protect himself with and as a part of the gnome's [[taxidermy]] craft. Specials [[Embalming fluid|mixture]] of his own creation could be found in the gnome's home. He also carried a ''[[potion of cure light wounds]]''. His home was decorated with many stuffed mammals, birds and had animal heads mounted on the walls.",
