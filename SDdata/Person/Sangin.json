        "Description": "The warlock wore simple [[robe]]s of earthen hues but adorned himself with numerous rings. He wore particularly tiny glasses ad the end of his rather large nose.",
        "Personality": "He was a conniving man that cared primarily for his own wellbeing. He desperately sought a way to escape Barovia, seeing others as merely a means to that end.",
        "Abilities": "Sangin was at least somewhat knowledgeable about the workings of the [[arcane]].",
        "Relationships": "Like all inhabitants of Barovia were in some way, Sangin was a servant of Count [[Strahd von Zarovich]].\n\nSangin briefly worked with a pair of [[werewolves]] [[Dron]] and [[Utna]], who laired with their pack in a cave network near [[Lake Baratok]].",
        "History": "Sometime ''circa'' the 1480s DR, Sangin was dispatched along with Dron and Utna by Count Strahd to [[Toril]] on the [[Prime Material plane]] to search for a specific magical item that could allow travel away from Barovia. While away from the [[Domains of Dread]] the Sangin and the [[lycanthrope]]s worked together to claim the item for themselves, as a means of escape from Strahd's ever-present and far-reaching control. \n\n[[File:Sangin Vamp.png|thumb|right|100px|Sangin the [[vampire]].]]\nThey tracked the item to the [[Temple of Kelemvor (Baldur's Gate)|temple of Kelemvor]] in [[Baldur's Gate]], and abducted the cleric [[Nerys Kathon]] to ''[[identify]]'' it from a group of other [[relic]]s. After successfully identifying an [[item enchantment|enchanted]] locket that once belonged to a woman named [[Tatyana]], Nerys withheld the information from her captors until she was rescued by the [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate]]. Unfortunately for everyone involved, Strahd tracked them down and used the mists of the [[Shadowfell]] to bring them all to his realm.\nOnce the group was returned to Strahd's domain, Sangin was promptly carried away by a cloud of [[bat]]s to [[Castle Ravenloft]]. Marked a traitor by the count, Sangin was feasted upon by three of Strahd's [[vampire]]s and turned into an [[undead]] monster himself.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 2}} \n\nAfter his transformation, the vampiric Sangin was dispatched alongside his his sires to exert Strahd's control over the werewolf den, forcing the pack's leader [[Kiril]] to order the death of Dron.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 3}} Bringing the werewolves along as brutish enforcers, Sangin and the vampires assailed [[Vargas|Baron Vargas]] for harboring the Heroes of Baldur's Gate, enemies of Barovia. In the ensuing battle, the undead Sangin was beheaded by Utna as revenge for Dron's death.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 4}}"
