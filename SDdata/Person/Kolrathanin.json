        "mainbody": "Kolrathanin was a member of Clangeddins Hearth, an organization of dwarf descendants of Clan Melairkyn who were attempting to reclaim their ancestral homes in Undermountain in 1370 DR.\nKolrathanin, along with his fellow Clangeddinites, re-established a dwarven colony in the temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard in Undermountain after Halaster Blackcloaks disappearance in 1369 DR. In 1370 DR, Clangeddins Hearth came into violent conflict with the drow followers of Matron Mother Azurna after Kolrathanin attempted to drown and wash out her drow and kobolds from the sewers in Undermountain. This act infuriated Azurna and she led her dark elves to slaughter almost all of the Hearths members."
