        "mainbody": "'''Kolrathanin''' was a member of [[Clangeddin's Hearth]], an organization of [[dwarf]] descendants of [[Clan Melairkyn]] who were attempting to reclaim their ancestral homes in [[Undermountain]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Kolrathanin, along with his fellow Clangeddinites, re-established a dwarven colony in the temple of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] in Undermountain after [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s disappearance in [[1369 DR]]. In [[1370 DR]], Clangeddin's Hearth came into violent conflict with the [[drow]] followers of Matron Mother [[Azurna]] after Kolrathanin attempted to drown and wash out her drow and [[kobold]]s from the sewers in Undermountain. This act infuriated Azurna and she led her dark elves to slaughter almost all of the Hearth's members."
