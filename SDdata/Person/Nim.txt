'''Nim''' was a [[nimblewright]] at the [[House of Inspired Hands]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Activities==
Nim was an avid and capable inventor. Some of its inventions included a partially functional mechanical [[sparrow]], as well as a ''[[nimblewright detector]]''. It was also capable of constructing other nimblewrights.

==History==
Nim was built by a [[Lantan]]ese [[wizard]] who, during a visit to Waterdeep, decided to donate him to the local church of [[Gond]]. Out of loneliness and boredom, Nim started creating his own inventions.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{WDH-time}} Nim created a nimblewright that went rogue and escaped from the temple. When informed about those events, the [[cleric]] of Gond [[Valetta]] decided to strip Nim of all his construction materials.
