        "mainbody": "'''Fedosia Peytir''' was a noble in [[Mulmaster]].",
        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], Fedosia and her husband were working on establishing an advantageous business alliance for [[House Peytir]]. She hoped that [[Ardet Peytir]] was dead, so she could inherit his land and buildings.",
        "Personality": "Fedosia was a young woman who truly knew that her fortunes would rise and fall together with the Peytir name. She looked up to [[Cora Peytir]], but she was more interested in growing the family's business interests rather than its political status."
