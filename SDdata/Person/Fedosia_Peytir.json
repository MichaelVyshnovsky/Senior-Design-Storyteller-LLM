        "mainbody": "Fedosia Peytir was a noble in Mulmaster.\nIn 1491 DR, Fedosia and her husband were working on establishing an advantageous business alliance for House Peytir. She hoped that Ardet Peytir was dead, so she could inherit his land and buildings.\nFedosia was a young woman who truly knew that her fortunes would rise and fall together with the Peytir name. She looked up to Cora Peytir, but she was more interested in growing the familys business interests rather than its political status."
