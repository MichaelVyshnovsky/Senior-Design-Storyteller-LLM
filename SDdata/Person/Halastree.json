        "mainbody": "'''Halastree''' was an intelligent [[tree]] that lived in [[Wyllowwood]], the subterranean forest domain located deep within the dungeon-complex known as [[Undermountain]]. It served as the usher for the [[druid]] [[Wyllow]], after having been granted sentience by means of the [[spell]] ''[[awaken]]''.",
        "Description": "Halastree was quite distinct from other trees as its trunk bared the likeness of the \"Mad Mage\" [[Halaster Blackcloak]] carved into its trunk. The arboreal butler was particularly polite in its demeanor and spoke the [[Common]] language."
