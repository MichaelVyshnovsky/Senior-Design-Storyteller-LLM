        "mainbody": "Halastree was an intelligent tree that lived in Wyllowwood, the subterranean forest domain located deep within the dungeon-complex known as Undermountain. It served as the usher for the druid Wyllow, after having been granted sentience by means of the spell awaken.\nHalastree was quite distinct from other trees as its trunk bared the likeness of the \"Mad Mage\" Halaster Blackcloak carved into its trunk. The arboreal butler was particularly polite in its demeanor and spoke the Common language."
