'''Yiarni''' was an [[Dragon aging|adult]] [[crystal dragon]] of the [[Thunder Peaks]] of [[Cormyr]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/Roll Call of Dragons}}

==Home==
She kept her lair within the northern Thunder Peaks, which were cool enough to support but one gem dragon.

==Personality==
She was exceptionally kind and gentle-hearted, and very different from most crystal dragons' reputations.

==Activities==
While Yiarni's exact goals within the Thunder Peaks were unknown, the dragon would spend some of her time sharing her wealth of knowledge with local scholars and helping travelers in distress, provided they promised not to reveal her location to others. She also met with young [[white dragon]]s that traveled within her territory, in hopes of tempering their naturally cruel dispositions into friendlier personalities.

==Relationships==
Yiarni was acquainted with the sage [[Nibulus Loral]] and spoke a little with him. Nibulus believed Yiarni to be an acquaintance of the [[gold dragon]] [[Tarlacoal]], who also dwelled in the Thunder Peaks, and that they were working together on something around the year [[1367 DR]].

==History==
She was still alive after the [[Dracorage]] of [[1373 DR]].
