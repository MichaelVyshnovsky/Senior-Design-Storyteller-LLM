        "mainbody": "Dundar was a blacksmith and inhabitant of Tilverton in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nDundar owned Dundars Fine Swords where he in fact, sold fine swords. By the late 1360s he had expanded his craft to include saws, axes, scythes, and other bladed implements, and renamed his shop to Dundars Fine Blades. He also provided training for novice fighters in weaponplay. \nDundars sibling, a Harper named Andalara, helped him in the shop by finishing blades and constructing scabbards when she wasnt hunting."
