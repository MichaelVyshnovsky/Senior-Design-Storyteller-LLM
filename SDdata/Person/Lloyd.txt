Minister Lloyd was the mayor of Imnesvale circa the midâ€“14 century DR.
Lloyd was somewhat of a worrisome individual. Whenever the town was presented with a problem he was fearful that the worst possible outcome would arise.
Among the mayors possessions was an enchanted suit of leather armor called the Nights Gift.
When a rash of killings and disappearances sprang up around Imnesvale in the , Lloyd sought assistance from outside his little village. At first he hired a group of adventurers led by the brave Mazzy Fentan. When that group went missing he sent a messenger Delon to seek help in the capital city of Athkatla.
