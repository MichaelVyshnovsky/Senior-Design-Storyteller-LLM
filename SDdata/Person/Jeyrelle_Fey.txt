Jeyrelle Fey was one of the few female members of Bregan Daerthe in the early 15 century DR.
Jeyrelle was a beautiful woman with amber eyes.
She was a priestess of an unknown goddess that was not Lolth.
In 1488 DR, Jeyrelle, together with Braelin Janquay, acted as support for the resurrected Zaknafein for a mission for Bregan Daerthe.
At Bregan Daerthes meeting with House Hunzrin in Waterdeeps sewers, she remained behind.
