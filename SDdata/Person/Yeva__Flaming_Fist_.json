        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Grand Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]] was the target of a kidnapping when he and some others were staying at the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn, during their travels west along the [[Risen Road]] form [[Elturel]] to [[Baldur's Gate]]. After a terrible fight between the soldiers and [[drow]] raiders from the [[cult of the Absolute]], Ulder Ravengard was taken west towards [[Moonrise Towers]] and the inn was set on fire. Gauntlet Yeva and her soldiers were among the first to come to the Duke's rescue, attempting to break down the door of the inn and pull him to safety."
