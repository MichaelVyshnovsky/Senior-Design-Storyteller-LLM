Lailuu Gyrrite was the governor of Zalasuu in Halruaa in 1367 DR.
Lailuu spent less time governing her city and more time making preparations for Halruaas defense. The close proximity of Zalasuu to the Kilmaruu Swamp gave her ample opportunities to test her defenses. 
Lailuu was also a high ranking priestess of Mystra, and a member of the Council of Elders.
