        "mainbody": "Bergos Freth was a drow commander of House Freths assassin forces operating in the ruins of Myth Drannor in 1369 DR.\nDuring her mission to Myth Drannor, Bergos wore tight black clothes that hid her true armor underneath. Her face was covered by a black, masked skull-tight hood through which she wore her long white hair in a thick ponytail.\nBergos Freth was outfitted with a strong and enchanted +1 drow chainmail, a magical +1 drow shortsword and several healing salves. She often started combat using her longbow.\nIn 1369 DR, the drow houses Freth and Kilsek helmed the expedition into the subterranean parts of the ruined City of Song, Myth Drannor. House Freth was led by Dreydre and Greyanna Freth, with Bergos Freth commanding the houses elite assassin vanguard squad. The drow established a solid foothold in the Elven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor, creating a well-defended underground stronghold. During that year, another dark force occupied Myth Drannor, the Cult of the Dragon. Treacherous Freth drow entered into a secret alliance with the cultists, betraying their House Kilsek allies. Freth were allowed to access all the ancient surface elven artifacts they could smuggle out of the Catacombs while Kilsek drow were either murdered and raised as undead servants of the Cult or stripped of their souls and forced into servitude.\nBergos had a squad of elite commandos under her control that consisted of eight male masters of covert combat, a high priestess of Lolth, and two trained guard arraccats. She used her natural drow ability to summon a darkness cloud to mask her troops movements in the Elven Catacombs.\nBergos met her death when her drow came into direct confrontation with the group of adventurers known as the Veiled Ones, a makeshift band assembled by Elminster Aumar to confront the Cult of the Dragon. Shortly after the adventurers first arrival in the Elven Catacombs via the previously inactive gate, the Circle of Ualair, that connected Speculum Grounds and the catacombs, they were greeted by Bergos proudly standing in front of a cloud of magical darkness. She threatened the trespassers and promised to end their lives in the name of the Queen of Spiders. The Veiled Ones cunningly taunted the drow woman into revealing two of her commandos as a show of strength in the face of cocky adventurers and eventually tricked her into stopping the darkness revealing her entire squad, giving the adventurers an upper hand. Unfortunately for her, Bergos could not overpower the Veiled Ones and was slain."
