        "mainbody": "'''Brakkis Elspaar''' was a member of the [[Stone-Cold Reavers]], a group of reckless adventurers who made their living sometimes as sellswords and sometimes as brigands.",
        "History": "The group tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] from its lair, [[Icespire Hold]]. However, Cryovain hadn't amassed any treasure yet.",
        "Description": "Brakkis was out of shape and had lost the benefits of youth.",
        "Personality": "He took advantage of any opportunities presented to him, resorting to thievery when honest work was unavailable. He was a follower rather than a leader. This suited him because all he really wanted to think and talk about were [[dog]]s and what he would do when he retired."
