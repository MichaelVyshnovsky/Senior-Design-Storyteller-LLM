He abandoned his career as a mercenary and settled in the village. Despite fewer people arriving at the inn over the years, Stephan was happy with his life.\nIn 1357, Stephan provided room and board to the hero Gareth Dragonsbane and his companions on the eve of their liberation of Bloodstone from the forces of Vaasa."
