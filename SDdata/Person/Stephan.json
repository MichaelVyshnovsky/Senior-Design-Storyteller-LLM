        "Activities": "Stephan managed the [[Inn of the Clowns]] with his barmaids, [[Racquel]] and [[Carlotta]]. They knew virtually everything about the community.\n\nStephan was trying to develop [[Dungeons & Dragons|some kind of game]] involving miniature terrain pieces and little sculptures of fighters in his spare time.",
        "History": "Around [[1345 DR]], Stephan won the inn in a gambling match. He abandoned his career as a mercenary and settled in the village. Despite fewer people arriving at the inn over the years, Stephan was happy with his life.\n\nIn 1357, Stephan provided room and board to the hero [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and his companions on the eve of their liberation of Bloodstone from the forces of [[Vaasa]]."
