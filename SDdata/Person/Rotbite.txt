'''Rotbite''' was a [[horned devil]] who terrorized the [[Volkumburgh Vale]] in the mid-12{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]],{{ShatteredStatue-pasttime}}{{ShatteredStatue-Time}}

==Abilities==
Rotbite was capable of casting the following spells, even while he was possessing the unique golem [[Awtawmatawn]]: ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[infravision (spell)|infravision]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[animate dead]]'', ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[produce flame]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', and ''[[wall of fire]]''.

He was also capable of casting ''[[fear]]'' in a {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} radius and ''[[slow]]'' on any creature within {{SI|1|in}} of it, though while inside Awtawmatawn he was unable to [[summon fiend|summon]] other horned devils to his aid.

Due to Rotbite's natural [[magic resistance]], the [[spell]] ''[[detect evil]]'' could not recognize his presence within Awtawmatawn.

==History==
Sometime in the mid-12{{th}},{{ShatteredStatue-pasttime}} Valmous was hired by King [[Proster Obarskyr]] to design a new variant of [[stone golem]]s to help expedite his ambitious building projects. However, while in the final stages of constructing the first one Valmous misfired a spell, which [[summon]]ed Rotbite on to the [[Prime Material plane]] and he quickly possessed the inert Awtawmatawn.

While possessing the golem he proceeded to slaughter all the residents of the College, who were unprepared for such an attack, except for Valmous who managed to escape to the nearby [[College of Rune Magics]]. Sensing that college over the mountains, Rotbite moved towards it. The injured Valmous, with the aid of the college's students, managed to destroy the Awtawmatawn, but not before it had destroyed the other college.

Valmous, now sensing the horned devil's presence trapped within the fragments of the Awtawmatawn, tasked the adepts with scattering his pieces across the Volkumburgh Vale. Then, using a combination of their [[rune magic]] and his [[magic item]]s, the rune adepts placed him into a healing stasis, where he awaited the day someone would attempt to recreate the golem. 

In [[1358 DR]],{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} a man named [[Lychor]] introduced the [[wizard]] [[Amelior Amanitas]] to the fragmented legend of this golem, as well as some fragments of it<ref> which he managed to merge back together into an arm through use of [[potion]]s. After doing so they gave off a [[magic]]al aura. He then became obsessed with the legend, thinking of the fame he would receive, though he would pass it off as being for the betterment of society.

Amelior's efforts to reconstruct the golem

Amelior later discovered one of the statue's feet ({{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in length) in a temple in [[Suzail]], which locals mistakenly believed to be a piece of [[Grumbar]]. In the month of [[Calendar of Harptos|Uktar]], some time before the [[Feast of the Moon]], he arranged for the foot to be shrunken down, stolen, and then delivered to him by a group of [[adventurer]]s in Suzail. Estimating where the other fragments might be, he then tasked them with seeking out the rest of the fragments. During this quest the adventurers would find themselves ambushed by the followers of Valmous, but they managed to fend them off.

Those adventurers went on to recover one of the golem's lost hands, hidden beneath a fountain in the village of Volkumburgh.<ref> Then with the unseen aid of Rotbite they uncovered an eye and arm of the golem within a secret cavern of the College of Rune Magics. And by disturbing those fragments, the adventurers awoke Valmous.<ref> Finally, the adventurers retrieved two halves of the golem's leg from the College of Shaping Magic<ref> and his head from the [[Temple of the Dragon Oracle]].<ref>

A few days after the collected parts were turned in to Amelior, the awakened Valmous and his disciples attacked the village, alongside an army of [[neanderthal]]s, seeking to destroy the Awtawmatawn. At the same time, Lychor unleashed a counter-force of [[undead]] in hopes of both protecting the golem and claiming it for himself. This horde of undead included a hundred [[skeleton]]s, twenty [[zombie]]s, and ten [[wight]]s. 

During this siege Rotbite finally regained full control of the Awtawmatawn and began to rampage around Volkumburg, destroying [[Amelior's workshop]] in the process. Ultimately, the golem was destroyed after it fell upon the [[Crimson Wyrm]] and down through the cavern that was hidden beneath it.<ref>
