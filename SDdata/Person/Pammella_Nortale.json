She ran the lodgings as a non-profit refugee shelter as the city was flooded by the people fleeing the encroaching army. The halfling matron was struggling and sought financing and donors among the nobility of the city. She penned a letter to Lord Whitburn, who once claimed that hed love to donate if only he had funds. Hostel Mother pointed out the Lords recent marriage and coming into money and openly asked for the promised large donation. Some members of the nobility were also admirers of Pammella Nortale and her work. Young Derque Rillyn was a regular sponsor but could not make donations above his regular amounts, as per his father Hir Rillyns instructions. However, Derque suggested renaming the lodgings to Hir Rillyns Hostel, as that would likely encourage the noble to finance it."
