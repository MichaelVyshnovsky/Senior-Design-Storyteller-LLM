        "mainbody": "Hostel Mother '''Pammella Nortale''' was the proprietress of [[Nortale's Hostel]], a non-profit hostel in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''We've not much to go around, but we'll make it stretch. We always do.''|Hostel Mother Pammella Nortale.}}",
        "Description": "Pammella was a female [[hin]] with light skin, blonde hair and blue eyes. She usually wore common garb such as plain [[tunic]]s and tan cloth breeches.",
        "History": "By the time the [[Absolute crisis]] brought war to the city of Baldur's Gate in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Hostel Mother Pammella Nortale was its only manager, employee, and the owner. She ran the lodgings as a non-profit refugee shelter as the city was flooded by the people fleeing the encroaching army. The halfling matron was struggling and sought financing and donors among the nobility of the city. She penned a letter to Lord [[Whitburn]], who once claimed that he'd love to donate if only he had funds. Hostel Mother pointed out the Lord's recent marriage and coming into money and openly asked for the promised large donation. Some members of the nobility were also admirers of Pammella Nortale and her work. Young [[Derque Rillyn]] was a regular sponsor but could not make donations above his regular amounts, as per his father [[Hir Rillyn]]'s instructions. However, Derque suggested renaming the lodgings to Hir Rillyn's Hostel, as that would likely encourage the noble to finance it."
