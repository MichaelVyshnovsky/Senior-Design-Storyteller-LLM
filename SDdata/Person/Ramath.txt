Ramath was a Zhentarim mageling apprenticed to Ghauban Szaurr in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Though apprenticed to Ghaubhan Szaurr,
Ramath accompanied Ghaubhan Szaurr in the Stonelands while the latter posed as a member of the Cult of the Dragon. Ramath began to have waking visions of a woman, a dwarf, and two men coming their way they were Shandril Shessairs party, which Ghaubhan Szaurr took as a sign that they were coming, suspecting Ramath to have godsight of sorts. In fact, the dream-visions were sent by Gathlarue, who was scrying on them.
Manshoon later revealed to Szaurr that Ramath was working for him.
