==History==
Ramath accompanied Ghaubhan Szaurr in the [[Stonelands]] while the latter posed as a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. Ramath began to have waking visions of a woman, a [[dwarf]], and two men coming their way; they were [[Shandril Shessair]]'s party, which Ghaubhan Szaurr took as a sign that they were coming, suspecting Ramath to have [[godsight]] of sorts. In fact, the dream-visions were sent by [[Gathlarue]], who was [[scrying]] on them.

Manshoon later revealed to Szaurr that Ramath was working for him.
