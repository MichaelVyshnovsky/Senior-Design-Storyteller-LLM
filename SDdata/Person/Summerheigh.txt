'''Summerheigh''' was a [[druid]] who lived in a lone stone hut near the massive [[tree]] in the [[Resurrection Gorge]] of [[Amn]] in the 14{{th}}century [[DR]].

{{quote|''All that once filled me with joy has been twisted beyond recognition, corrupted by the foul creature trapped within the great tree or killed outright.''|Summerheigh}}

==Description==
Summerheigh wore light blue garb.

==Possessions==
She was welcoming to the strangers and offered them a roof, food, and drink, as well as traded with them.

==Relationships==
As a druid of [[Silvanus]], Summerheigh possessed some sway of over beasts and [[fey]] of the Resurrection Gorge.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Summerheigh had spent her entire life in the Resurrection Gorge. Some years before 1369 DR, Summerheigh's son, [[Vernus]], a powerful druid in his own right, performed a ritual at the heart of the gorge in an attempt to reach the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]], the planar home of his beloved deity. The ritual went awry, and instead, he opened a ''[[gate]]'' that allowed a powerful [[fiend]] to step into the Resurrection Gorge. To stop the creature, [[Yarrow]], the great tree's [[dryad]], bound the fiend to the gorge. The fiend's influence twisted and [[poison]]ed the nature around the prison. The aged druid believed that the trapped creature's poisonous influence could, with time, spread and affect the entirety of Amn, reaching [[Athkatla]] and [[Esmeltaran]]. Summerheigh did not know the creature's nature and planned to venture into the gorge to find out, when her life would be close to an end.
