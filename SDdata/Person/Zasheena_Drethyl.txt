Unknown for most people, Zasheena was a head member of the criminal organization "Shadowkiss". She usually hired [[adventurer]]s to fulfill special tasks on her behalf, and even seduced them when she believed was productive for her current goals. Her main goal was to eventually using the drugs sell by the Shadowkiss to control the [[green dragon]] [[Orlarrakh]].
