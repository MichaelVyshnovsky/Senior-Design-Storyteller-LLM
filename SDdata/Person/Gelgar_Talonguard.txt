'''Gelgar Talonguard''' was the ruler of [[Darmshall]] in [[Vaasa]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
He was the commander of the 500-strong army of Darmshall, and also managed the small city's impressive armories and underground granaries.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Gelgar had begun sending agents to southern lands hoping to recruit women to move to Darmshall, where the gender ratio leaned heavily toward men. His recruiters could be encountered as far afield as the [[Dragon Reach]], [[Impiltur]] and [[Telflamm]].
