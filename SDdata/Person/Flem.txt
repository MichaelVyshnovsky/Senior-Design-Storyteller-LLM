'''Flem''' was the [[ormyrr]] lorekeeper of the [[Sharpstick clan]] who lived in the ruined city of [[Myth Drannor]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==History==
In 1369 DR, ormyrr of the Sharpstick clan were divided by the dark mind-affecting magics of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. The usurper chief [[Pujik]] allied himself with the cultists, while [[Retha]], the old leader, was trying to stop the evil ormyrr. Flem was uncorrupted and remained loyal to the tribe's true leader. Subsequently, a group of heroes, the [[Veiled Ones]], slew Pujik and freed the tribe from the Cult's corruption. In reward, Flem offered the heroes his expansive knowledge of the old stories and legends that led the heroes to some powerful enchanted items hidden within the ruins of the City of Song.
