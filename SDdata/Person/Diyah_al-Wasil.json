        "mainbody": "Diyah al-Wasil was an inhabitant of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.\nDiyah had oily skin that marred his complexion. Despite looking like a scoundrel, he was completely loyal to Huzuz and the Grand Caliph.\nDiyahs competency was complimented by his thoroughness, making him a perfect tax collector.\nDiyah was responsible for the collection of taxes and inspecting caravans passing through the Pilgrims Gate in Huzuz."
