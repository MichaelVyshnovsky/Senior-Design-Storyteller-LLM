        "Description": "Gronag was a male goblin with facial pain across his left eye, dark-yellow hide, a mohawk, and crudely-cobbled together goblin metal armor and a [[scimitar]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Gronag joined the new \"deity\" that emerged in the [[Western Heartlands]] â€“ the Absolute. The goblin joined the cult's army in the shadow-cursed lands around the [[Moonrise Towers]] and was tasked, along with a group of other cultists that included [[Kansif]], [[Vez]], and [[Bedi]], with manning a checkpoint designed to help the cultists cross the deadly land. There, Gronag showed his cruel and sadistic traits by sending trained [[hyena]]s into the darkness after bones, where the hyenas were devoured by the curse."
