'''Adimond Kroskas''' was the leader of a [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell in [[Neverwinter]] circa [[1480 DR]].

He was enslaved by [[Valindra Shadowmantle]], who also gained his ''[[ring of dragons]]''. However, he agreed to her project of resurrecting the legendary [[dragon]] [[Lorragauth]] as a [[dracolich]]. However, the problems stalling the project put him under a lot of stress, being caught between the [[elf|elven]] [[lich]] and his Cult subordinates.
