'''Takashi Yayazato''' was a head of the [[Yayazato]] clan and a [[daimyo]] of [[Aru Province]] in [[Wa]] during the mid-1700s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==History==
Takashi Yayazato became daimyo in {{YearlinkConvert|1730|WY}}, after the removal of [[Hisao Matsutomo]].

Takashi governed the province well, but suffered much tragedy. Though he had three sons on becoming daimyo, all strong and suitable heirs, two died when their vessel sank in a typhoon and the third was killed in a climbing accident whilst scaling the Dragon's Face of [[Mount Matazan]]. Thus, Takashi had no male heirs to succeed him when he died in {{YearlinkConvert|1758|WY}}. Thus, [[shogun]] [[Matasuuri Nagahide]] returned the daimyate to the [[Matsutomo]]s, under [[Benju Matsotomo]].
