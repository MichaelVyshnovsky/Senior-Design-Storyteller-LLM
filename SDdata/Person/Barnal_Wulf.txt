Barnal Wulf was a human resident of Eveningstar in Cormyr during the mid-1480s DR.
Barnal had shoulder-length light brown hair, a noticeable scar on his face, and wore a long gray and brown robe.
While living in Eveningstar during the drow attacks, Barnal noted that the animals of the Kings Forest were greatly disturbed and it had become incredibly dangerous to go into the once-safe forest.
