Martisha Vinetalker was the half-elf proprietor of the Wayside Inn in the late 15 century DR.
Martisha Vinetalker was a stunning half-elf whose appealing looks contrasted with her stern disposition. She was icy, calculating, and charming, and she understood how to run the inn with merciless efficiency and a financial motive.
Cooragh Struckt, the cook of the inn, was long-time companion of Martisha. The bartender Backes Dunfield on the other hand was a more recent acquaintance but he swiftly established himself as a valuable lieutenant to Martisha.
Martisha was originally a bandit captain, but retired from the life to operate the Wayside Inn. Circa 1491 DR, Martisha tried to form a mutual defense pact with the town of Leilon, which was being rebuilt, as well as a commerce deal in which she would sell her vegetables and cattle in exchange for the things they produced. During that time, the Wayside Inn was attacked by undead that had been created by a cult of Myrkul. A group of adventurers was able to defend the inn against the undead attack.
Later, the cult of Talos led by Fheralai Stormsworn took over the inn. Unfortunately for Martisha, her bartender Backes and her blacksmith Teega were members of the cult. They abducted Martisha and held her captive in the cellar, while the guests of the inn were impaled as sacrifices to the Stormbringer. The cultists tried to turn the Wayside Inn into a temple of Talos and summoned a violent thunderstorm around the inn in the process. Ultimately, the same group of adventurers was able to save Martisha and stop the ritual in time, with Martisha demonstrating her weapons expertise on her former employees if given the chance. However, the Talos cultists successfully kidnapped Tarbin Tul, a local bard.
