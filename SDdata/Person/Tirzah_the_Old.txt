==Description==
In [[1374 DR]], Tirzah the Old was indeed an aged woman of sour demeanor. She had white hair gathered in a severe bun, and her lips were perpetually pursed as if to keep her ancient teeth from falling out of her mouth. She wore a white Wychlaran''asatheirr'' and simple gray [[robe]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the adventurer known as the Knight-Commander, or [[Kalach-Cha]], roused the spirits of [[Rashemen]]. Soon after the Knight-Commander's arrival to Mulsantir, an army of spirits, ''[[telthor]]s'' led by the Bear-God [[Okku]], gathered outside and demanded the life of the Knight-Commander. With aid from [[Sheva Whitefeather]], a high-ranking witch of Mulsantir, the adventurer approached Tirzah the Old in order to find allies, willing or unwilling, who would stand beside the Knight-Commander against angry spirits. Tirzah insisted that those imprisoned were not to be trusted. At the time, there were only three prisoners, the [[hagspawn]] named [[Gannayev-of-Dreams]], another hagspawn [[Mighty Groznek]], and [[hin]] [[Joeb the Cutpurse]]. However, only the hagspawn agreed to exchange his imprisonment for warfare. During Gannayev-of-Dreams' stay at the prison, he read Tirzah's past and dreams. She once spent an hour singing hymns to the sun in the golden forests of [[Urling]] and dreamt of the sun being a [[shield]] wielded by a warrior who protected the witch.
