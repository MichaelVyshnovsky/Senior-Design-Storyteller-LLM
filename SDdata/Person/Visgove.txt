'''Visgove''' was a notoriously lazy adventurer and an inventor, active sometime before [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Visgove was the original creator of ''[[teleportation bolt]]'', [[enchanted]] [[crossbow]] ammunition that transported the targets within melee range from the shooter. Visgove spent an ungodly amount of [[gold]], developing these [[bolt]]s as he much better preferred his opponents coming to him, rather than having to charge across a battlefield.
