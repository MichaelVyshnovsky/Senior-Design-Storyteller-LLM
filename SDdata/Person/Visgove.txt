Visgove was a notoriously lazy adventurer and an inventor, active sometime before 1372 DR.
Visgove was the original creator of teleportation bolt, enchanted crossbow ammunition that transported the targets within melee range from the shooter. Visgove spent an ungodly amount of gold, developing these bolts as he much better preferred his opponents coming to him, rather than having to charge across a battlefield.
