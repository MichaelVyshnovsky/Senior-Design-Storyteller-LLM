He was a talented rogue but laziness was his most prominent trait. Many considered Tipsy to be selfish, unreliable, and untrustworthy, especially in a crisis.\nTipsy Toehammer had a special throwing dagger harness draped across his chest for ease of access to his main weapons. Along with the daggers, the halfling had a ring of invisibility handy.\nEver since his childhood, Tipsy was a lazy person. His natural size and aptitudes guided him toward the life of thievery. Tipsys uncanny luck certainly helped him to make a name for himself. Many claimed that the halflings luck could even defy gods."
