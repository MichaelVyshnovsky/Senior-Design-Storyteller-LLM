Dran was a treasure hunter in the Moonwood.
In 1484 DR, Dran, his twin Garn, and Lisstra followed Karrik to explore the ruins of Methegrist.
Dran was the twin brother of Garn. Like his twin, Dran was totally loyal to Karrik.
Dran was the exuberant one of the twins, always offering idiotic ideas or mistaken information.
