Lariond Harlhaun was a member of the Harlhaun merchant family in Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR.
The Harlhauns tended to be tall and thin, with high cheekbones and large, dark eyes, and Lariond was no exception.
Lariond and his younger brother Narthel thought of themselves as rivals for taking over the family business from their aging father. They unwisely dismissed their older sister Arleithe as a candidate, and instead, endlessly plotted against each other as they vied for prominence and attempted to sabotage each others plans.
