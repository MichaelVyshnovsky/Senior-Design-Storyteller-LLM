'''Lariond Harlhaun''' was a member of the [[Harlhaun]] merchant family in [[Delzimmer]] ''circa'' the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]].

==Description==
The Harlhauns tended to be tall and thin, with high cheekbones and large, dark eyes, and Lariond was no exception.

==Activities==
{{Main|Harlhaun}}
Lariond and his younger brother [[Narthel Harlhaun|Narthel]] thought of themselves as rivals for taking over the family business from their aging father. They unwisely dismissed their older sister [[Arleithe Harlhaun|Arleithe]] as a candidate, and instead, endlessly plotted against each other as they vied for prominence and attempted to sabotage each other's plans.
