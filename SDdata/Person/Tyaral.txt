'''Tyaral''' was a priest of [[Bhaal]] who sought powerful magic in order to restore his god.{{Cite web enhancement/Secrets of Imaskar|2}}

==Personality==
Tyaral was consumed with the desire to bring back his dead god.{{Cite web enhancement/Secrets of Imaskar|8}}

==Abilities==
Though he served a dead god, Tyaral was still granted spells.

==Possessions==
Tyaral was in possession of ''+1 [[full plate]]'' armor, a ''[[ring of protection]]'', a masterwork [[heavy mace]], a divine [[scroll]] of ''[[summon monster III]]'', and a ''[[pearl of power]]''. He also had travel clothing, a silver [[unholy symbol]] of Bhaal, a backpack, a bedroll, adventuring equipment, and 12 [[platinum piece]]s.

He may also have come to possess the ''[[Seventh Imaskarcana]]''.

==Activities==
He was looking for all the powerful [[magic]] he could find in order to restore Bhaal. In the process, he learned of [[Jarval Keth]]'s discovery of an unusual symbol at [[Maskana]], and tortured him in order to learn its location. There, he found the entrance to the hidden level in Maskana.

==Relationships==
One of his trusted lieutenants was a woman named [[Sithena Tinzon]].<ref>{{Cite web enhancement/Secrets of Imaskar|3}}

==History==
Tyaral was already a priest of Bhaal when the god was slain. The event unhinged him slightly.
