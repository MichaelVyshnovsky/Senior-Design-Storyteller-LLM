Tyaral was a priest of Bhaal who sought powerful magic in order to restore his god.
Tyaral was consumed with the desire to bring back his dead god.
Though he served a dead god, Tyaral was still granted spells.
Tyaral was in possession of +1 full plate armor, a ring of protection, a masterwork heavy mace, a divine scroll of summon monster III, and a pearl of power. He also had travel clothing, a silver unholy symbol of Bhaal, a backpack, a bedroll, adventuring equipment, and 12 platinum pieces.
He may also have come to possess the Seventh Imaskarcana.
He was looking for all the powerful magic he could find in order to restore Bhaal. In the process, he learned of Jarval Keths discovery of an unusual symbol at Maskana, and tortured him in order to learn its location. There, he found the entrance to the hidden level in Maskana.
One of his trusted lieutenants was a woman named Sithena Tinzon.
Tyaral was already a priest of Bhaal when the god was slain. The event unhinged him slightly.
