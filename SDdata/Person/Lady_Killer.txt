'''Lady Killer''' was a purebred, chestnut-colored [[horse]] owned by [[Alias]].

==History==
In [[1357 DR]], the adventurer Alias and her companions purchased Lady Killer alongside four other horses at the farm known as [[Dimswart Manor]] in [[Cormyr]].
 
Alias rode the stallion to locations that included [[Suzail]], the [[Shadow Gap]], and [[Shadowdale]].
 
Ultimately, Lady Killer died in the ravenous maw of the [[red dragon]] known as [[Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco|Mist]].
