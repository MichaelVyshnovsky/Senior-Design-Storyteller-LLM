Lady Killer was a purebred, chestnut-colored horse owned by Alias.
In 1357 DR, the adventurer Alias and her companions purchased Lady Killer alongside four other horses at the farm known as Dimswart Manor in Cormyr.
Alias rode the stallion to locations that included Suzail, the Shadow Gap, and Shadowdale.
Ultimately, Lady Killer died in the ravenous maw of the red dragon known as Mist.
