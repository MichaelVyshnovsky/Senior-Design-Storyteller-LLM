'''Bhaem Shumokh''' was a [[human]] male and the head of the Shumokh mercantile family in [[Eshpurta]], which gave him a seat on the [[Shield Council of Eshpurta|Shield Council]] as of early [[1370 DR|1370 DR, the Year of the Tankard]].. The Shumokh family made their fortune in the blacksmithing and armor business, but kind-hearted Bhaem chose to become a musician and lute-maker, which turned out to be quite lucrative.
