Bhaem Shumokh was a human male and the head of the Shumokh mercantile family in Eshpurta, which gave him a seat on the Shield Council as of early 1370 DR, the Year of the Tankard.. The Shumokh family made their fortune in the blacksmithing and armor business, but kind-hearted Bhaem chose to become a musician and lute-maker, which turned out to be quite lucrative.
