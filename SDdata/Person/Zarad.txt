}}'''Zarad''' was the Chief Vizier and a skilled [[sha'ir]] who lived in [[Halwa]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/Land of Fate/Adventurer's Guide to Zakhara|58-59}}

==Description==
Zarad always donned black-and-white striped robes, making him easy to spot at court.

==Activities==
Though he served as the caliph's vizier, Zarad was the true ruler of Halwa. All of Caliph [[Hava al-Gatil]]'s orders came directly from Zarad.

Zarad used his influence to enact an unfair taxation system for several years, allowing him to amass a great fortune before dismissing the tax before the caliph could discover what was going on.

He hoped to one day marry the Caliph's eldest daughter, [[Sikayah]], to solidify a potential claim on the throne.

==History==
Zarad had been the caliph's adviser since the caliph was a mere child, allowing him to develop a firm control over his actions throughout the years.

==Relationships==
The sha'ir was served by a powerful [[dao]] referred to only as "Zarad's Pet".

==Rumors & Legends==
Zarad planned to marry the caliph's eldest daughter to cement his rule over Halwa.
