Zarad was the Chief Vizier and a skilled shair who lived in Halwa in 1367 DR.
Zarad always donned black-and-white striped robes, making him easy to spot at court.
Though he served as the caliphs vizier, Zarad was the true ruler of Halwa. All of Caliph Hava al-Gatils orders came directly from Zarad.
Zarad used his influence to enact an unfair taxation system for several years, allowing him to amass a great fortune before dismissing the tax before the caliph could discover what was going on.
He hoped to one day marry the Caliphs eldest daughter, Sikayah, to solidify a potential claim on the throne.
Zarad had been the caliphs adviser since the caliph was a mere child, allowing him to develop a firm control over his actions throughout the years.
The shair was served by a powerful dao referred to only as "Zarads Pet".
Zarad planned to marry the caliphs eldest daughter to cement his rule over Halwa.
