Kwesi sar Mashewe and her sister Inshula sar Mashewe were huntswomen and bounty hunters active in the late 14 century DR.
Between the two beautiful and strong sisters, Kwesi was the level-headed and well-spoken one. She found pride in her trade and was patient enough while dealing with bureaucracy of Samargol.
Living in hot humid and sweltering region, Kwesi wore only the lighters hides and leathers, enough to let er stay relatively cool.
Inshula and Kwesi sar Mashewe were huntresses in training from the city of Tashluta. The women honed their skills in tracking dangerous beasts. In the , the sisters traveled by sea to the hidden nation of Samarach and organized hunting expeditions from the city of Samargol. Their goal was to become stronger and more experienced to travel back home to Chult across the dangerous mountains that separated the two regions of the Chultan Peninsula. During one of their hunts, the sisters came across a legendary giant dire boar Balalak. Inshula and Kwesi showered the beast with bolts but could not slay it. Retreating, Kwesi was injured and was forced to make a living dispensing bounties for monster parts in Samargol at the behest of the citys guards as she healed. Inshula, however, was still willing to hunt beasts and offered her services to traveling adventurers.
Eventually, Inshula sar Mashewe traveled to the Sword Coast and spent some time hunting there. However, with time she developed a longing for home and subsequently reunited with Kwesi, and they both returned to Tashluta.
