'''Arxhadk''' was the [[morkoth]] ambassador of [[Olleth]] in [[Sshamath]] in the year [[1370 DR]]. 

Arxhadk hailed from the [[Arcanum of Olleth]], the morkoth magocracy in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. He survived out of the water thanks to a [[golem]]-like construct that resembled and had the powers of a massive [[water elemental]], which he dwelt inside. Arxhadk had a [[slithering tracker]] as a familiar and sometimes he used it as silent and unseen assassin, unknown to the [[drow]] of Sshamath.
