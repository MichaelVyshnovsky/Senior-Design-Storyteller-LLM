Cathexis was the wizard responsive for creation of Lord Alexs boundless beer stein sometime before 1372 DR.
Cathexis crafted the never-ending magical stout stein for his good friend Lord Alex who loved to partake in tavern revelry. Eventually, Lord Alexs boundless beer stein ended up among junk in Torleths Treasures store in Gillians Hill.
