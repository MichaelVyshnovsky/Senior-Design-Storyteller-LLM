Rilaunyr was a paladin of Sune who served on the governing council of Impiltur, known as the Lords of Imphras II, during the late 14 century DR.
While Rilaunyr stood out from her peers as her patron deity was not one of the three members of the Triad, she had a strong ally in her fellow councilor Idriane. Together, the two formed a voice of moderation and caution among their often headstrong contemporaries. They often urged their fellow lords to take careful consideration when deciding upon matters, especially with matters regarding the safety of the kingdom.
