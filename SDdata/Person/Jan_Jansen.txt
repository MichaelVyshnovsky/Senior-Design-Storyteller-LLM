'''Jan Jansen''' was a [[gnome]] inventor, [[illusionist]], [[turnip]] salesman, weapons manufacturer, disreputable businessman, and adventurer who lived in [[Athkatla]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''"I think we make a fine partnership – like [[Drizzt Do'Urden|Drizzt]] and [[Wulfgar]], [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]] and [[Volo]]. Ha! We should go into the mobile vegetable-peddling business together."''|Jan}}

==Personality==
Jan was very eccentric, and loved to ramble on with stories that never got to the point. He had a habit of telling bizarre tales about his supposed relatives, [[turnip]]s, [[griffon]]-baiting, [[wyvern]]-taming, and other subjects for seemingly no reason.

Some of his stories were so outlandish it seemed they had no foundation in reality. He spoke about his aunt Petunia, who was a [[ranger]] who wore fruit armor and kept a number of pets including a [[black dragon]], a [[hydra]], and a [[solar]]. He also spun a tale about Angus the [[giant beaver]] who befriended Gurgen the hormonal [[moose]].

==Activities==
Jan had a home in the Athkatla's slums that he shared with his mother and a few other family members. He could often be found peddling his wares around the city's governmental buildings.

He spent much time coming up with outlandish inventions, such as his turnip–launcher or his ''[[flasher master brusier mate|flashers]]'' that he both gave to children and used as ammunition. In fact his inventions were actually dangerous weapons in their own right.

==Possessions==
Having come up with weapons and armor that proved useful to adventurers, Jan used several of them during his journeys. He wore a specialized suit of armor called the  ''[[Jansen AdventureWear]]'' and a set of eye wear known as ''[[Jansen spectroscopes|spectroscopes]]''. His personal weapon was a type of specialized crossbow entitled the ''[[Flasher Launcher]]''. It was so complicated that only Jan was capable of operating it.

==Relationships==
Jan had a [[Jansen|vast family]] that was full of individuals with colorful personalities. He often referred to his many uncles, including: Eichenwacher, Flippy, Gerhardt, Hegemony, Richard, Salebottom, Scatchy, Spanky, Stinky, and Uriah Twin–Hammers. Turnip seller [[Kylie Jansen]] was his cousin.

Beyond his family, Jan had a longtime friend named [[Lissa (gnome)|Lissa]]. He had an unrequited love for her, despite her relationship with the criminal [[Vaelag]]. He was friendly with his own partner–in–crime, [[Quayle]].

==History==
As strongly implied by [[Sarevok Anchev]], at one point of his life Jan successfully swindled [[Richtar|Rieltar]] by selling him what seemed like a lucrative piece of land, but actually turned out to be a monster-filled swampland. This trade apparently almost got [[Richtar|Rieltar]] ejected from the [[Iron Throne]].

As of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Jan was being investigated by [[Trax]], an agent of the Amnian Revenue and Taxation Board.
