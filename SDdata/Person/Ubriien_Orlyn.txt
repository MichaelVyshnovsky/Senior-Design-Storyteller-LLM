Ubriien Orlyn was one of the most powerful magelords of the kingdom of Athalantar.
Ubriien was the first leader of the magelords, before Neldryn Hawklyn, and the first Royal Mage of Belaur Aumar, as which he dominated the nation. He loved to travel the country in disguise to spy on people.
However, in 222 DR, disguised as an elf, he tried to cast a spell on an alert dwarven axelord at a feast, but the dwarf killed him.
