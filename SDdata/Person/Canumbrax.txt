'''Canumbrax''' was a [[shadurakul]] (shadow [[canomorph]]) bounty hunter in [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Circa 1374 DR, Canumbrax was hired by Lord [[Hulraven Irlingstar]] to help an adventuring party rescue his wife [[Amarune|Nael]], who'd been kidnapped by some agents of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] for unknown reasons. Canumbrax's duty was to lead the adventures into the [[Plane of Shadow]].
