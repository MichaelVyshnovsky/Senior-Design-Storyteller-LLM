Gisentraxia was a bronze dragon in the late 15 century DR.
In her human form, Gisentraxia appeared to be a light-skinned woman with brown eyes and hair. She wore face paint and had her hair gathered in a bun over an undershave.
She was Palhavorithyns mate and a friend of Elminster Aumar.
In the late 15 century DR, Gisentraxia aided her friend Elminster in investigating the Weave. Later, she carried Elminster to the Dragonbone Vale, where the Cult of the Dragon, allied with the Red Wizards of Thay, planned on making the prophecy of the Chronicle of Years to Come come true. She assumed her human form while assisting Sergeant Alphonse Knoxs troops and adventurers from Neverwinter, who operated out of the Shield of the North camp. However, Gisentraxia had a personal stake in the cults sinister plot she believed that Palhavorithyn, her beloved, was corrupted by foul magics.
