        "Description": {
            "Personality": "In life, he was extremely paranoid and regularly laid out various plans and contingencies to prevent potential betrayals and double-crosses. This often caused the deaths of innocents and ruined lives to which Shangalar was completely indifferent."
        },
        "Possessions": "He wore a [[black dragon]]–hide cloak that he'd crafted from a pair of [[dragons]] he had slain. He also had a notoriously grim [[Book of Shangalar the Black|personal spellbook]] filled with dark magic he had created, before it was stolen by a [[thief]].",
        "Magic": "[[File:ShangalarSigil.JPG|thumb|''Shangalar's [[mage sigil]].'']]\nOne of the lasting contributions of Shangalar before achieving lichdom was his research into dark magic. The development of the [[arcane]] version of ''[[negative plane protection]]'' as well as the spells ''[[repel undead]]'', ''[[bone javelin]]'' and ''[[bone blade]]'' can be attributed to Shangalar.",
        "History": "Shangalar was born the son of a [[cambion]] vizier in [[Calimshan]]. During the late 7th century DR, Shangalar slew his father and took over the position of [[Grand Vizar]] and ruled Calimshan alongside his childhood friend, [[Mameluks|Mameluk]] [[Murabir Avarrk]]. However after Avarrk's death at hands of assassins, Shangalar fled into the [[Marching Mountains]] and created a floating pyramidal lair to hide from his enemies. He accumulated power and wealth by raiding the ruins of ancient [[human]] and [[elven]] civilizations, aided by hired lackeys and summoned monsters and [[undead]].\n\nWhile exploring ruins in the desert of [[Anauroch]], Shangalar was robbed of his [[spellbook]] by the renowned master thief, [[Athchos the Black]]. Athchos attempted to lease the tome a mage in [[Elturel]] but was killed by a swarm of hundreds of [[crawling claw]], of which Shangalar was believed to be responsible. Contributing to this theory, and perhaps as a point of pride, was the fact Shangalar took on the mantle of \"''-the Black''\" after Athchos' death.\n\nIn [[1018 DR]], during the [[Rage of Dragons]], Shangalar faced a pair of [[black dragon]]s in battle and although he slew them both he suffered fatal wounds that forced him to become a [[lich]].\n\nSometime before the [[Time of Troubles]], Shangalar's lair was intruded upon by [[Rhangaun]] and [[Rysellan|Rysellan the Dark]]. His display of power in defending his lair greatly impressed the two runemasters of the Twisted Rune enough that they allowed him to join their organization.\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], the chaos of the Time of Troubles severely disrupted the experimental [[magic]]s in [[Shangalar's lair]] and greatly weakened his overall power. By at least [[1369 DR]], Shangalar had become one of the nine runemasters in the Twisted Rune, a position that he still held as late as [[1372 DR]].",
        "Relationships": {
            "Jymahna": "Shangalar was responsible for transforming the former concubine, [[Jymahna]], into a lich. Whilst they both lived, Jymahna was Shangalar's lover and in [[undeath]] she operated as his agent for centuries. Many of Jymahna's secrets were kept hidden by Shangalar."
