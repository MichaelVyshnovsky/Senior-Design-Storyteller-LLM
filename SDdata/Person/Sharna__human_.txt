Sharna was a paladin of Helm who was uncommonly strong for her size.
Sharna was a petite woman with symmetrical facial features, blue eyes, and long, brown hair.
She used a pair of gauntlets of ogre power to boost her already considerable strength. Sharna also owned a suit of chain mail, a shield, and a longsword of sharpness.
The dissonance between Sharnas size and strength worked in her favor, and she occasionally used it to shame "tough guys" into worshiping Helm.
Sharna had plans to travel to Maztica to aid in converting the local populace to the Helmite faith.
