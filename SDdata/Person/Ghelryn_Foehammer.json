        "mainbody": "'''Ghelryn \"Goldhand\" Foehammer''' was a [[shield dwarf]] master smith of the town of [[Triboar]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} and late 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Ghelryn managed [[Foehammer's Forge]]. He was a very skilled blacksmith who produced a large quantity and variety of metalwork items that were sold in shops found all over [[the North]] and along the [[Sword Coast]]. The quality of his metal and his craftsmanship was above average, and his prices cheaper. In particular, his eyebolts, latches, nails, and pins were crucial to the success of [[Wainwright's Wagons]] and other wagon repairmen in town.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}",
        "History": "After hearing word of [[orc]]s and [[giant]]s assaults on dwarfholds in the [[North]], Ghelryn often thought about going to fight in the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the {{yearlinkName|1485}}, but he couldn't abandon his business.\n\nBy the late 1480s DR, Ghelryn was growing too old for day-to-day work and was in search of an apprentice, but could not find any who met his standards.\n\nNevertheless, he made fine suits of ceremonial armor for King [[Morinn]] and Queen [[Tithmel]] of [[Citadel Felbarr]] and so impressed them he was awarded with the honorary title of Royal Armorer. This strengthened the already strong reputation of Foehammer's Forge, one he intended to uphold.\n\nA year later, he had his chance to fight, when the [[fire giant]]s [[Ildmane]] and [[Okssort]] launched a surprise assault on Triboar at highsun with a force of [[orog]]s, [[magmin]]s, and [[axe beak]]â€“mounted orcs in an effort to retrieve a piece of the ''[[Vonindod]]'', which they'd found buried beneath the [[Caravan campgrounds (Triboar)|caravan campgrounds]]. Ghelryn Foehammer lent his arm to the defense of the town, together with a band of [[adventurer]]s. In the aftermath, Ghelryn would give the adventurers a letter of recommendation to the king and queen of Citadel Felbarr, if their journey took them there.",
        "Personality": "Ghelryn was goodhearted but he zealously hated orcs and giants and he would never run from a fight, especially against them. He believed dwarves must forge their legacy and that he should stand up for [[Clan Foehammer]] and for dwarves everywhere.",
        "Relationships": "He maintained a friendly rivalry with fellow smith [[Aldenar Uldinath]], owner of [[Uldinath's Arms]], which was situated across from the road from Foehammer's Forge. This carried on to his granddaughter, [[Harriet Uldinath]].",
        "Possessions": "He fought with [[breastplate]], [[shield]], and [[battleaxe]]."
