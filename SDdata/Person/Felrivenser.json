        "mainbody": "elrivenser, also known as Gembright, was an amethyst dragon who dwelled in the Channel Lock within the empire of Netheril in the first to third millennia before Dalereckoning.\nShe was first recorded when she arrived on one of the northern locks in , then only an adult dragon. She claimed all the surrounding lands as her own and made her lair on an island.\nThereafter, knowing her as Gembright, a handful of curious Netherese archwizards made their way there to talk about magic, the affairs of dragons, and matters in society of the time.\nGembright lived there over two millennia and grew to become an ancient wyrm, but something forced her to leave her island in . She never came back.\nLiving elsewhere, she survived a few more centuries, becoming a mighty great wyrm.\nBy the 14 century DR, Felrivenser was considered to be long deceased.\nIn the 3 century DR, the sorceress Chassabra, called the Lady of Swirling Stones and a ruler of the Mlembryn Lands by the River Dessarin, researched her genealogy and discovered she was a descendant of Felrivenser. Whats more, she was believed to have found Felrivensers treasure hoard and stashed it in an extradimensional space accessed only by a portal unlocked by her pendant. Eventually, she transformed herself into an amethyst half-dragon and abandoned her tower and her realm."
