Alanis Flamehair was a Sembite cleric of Sune who adventured in Cormyr with the Stag Runners company in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Like many Sunite priests, she had a beautiful appearance and red hair.
Alanis was extremely vain, and abhorred receiving any kind of wound to her body. She was also squeamish about violence in general.
Alanis used her clerical powers to support her team of adventurers, preferring spells that kept them alive rather than harming their enemies.
In combat, she wore chain mail and wielded a club. In addition to her holy symbol and a few vials of holy water, she carried a staff of curing and a ring of regeneration.
In the , she and the other Stag Runners attended a party at Thistleflame Keep. The entertainer Mendryll Belarod proceeded to perform a shockingly debauched and insulting song that featured two Sembite merchants, a dryad, and a harpy, and the Stag Runners collectively decided to get revenge on him. Later that night, they attacked Mendryll, but between Mendrylls own skills and another group of adventurers, the Stag Runners were defeated. That same night they were also implicated in a murder by the Emerald Swords adventuring company, but may have been exonerated by virtue of being arrested at the time.
