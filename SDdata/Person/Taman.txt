'''Taman''' was a looter under the command of [[Gimblebock]] in the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{Quote|You're both twice as tall as me but have half the bloody backbone!|Gimblebock to Taman}}

==Description==
The half-elf had short dark hair and wore a green jerkin. He appeared to be very cautious.

==History==
In the 1490s DR, Taman and his fellow looters were trying to find their way into a crypt. A few days later, a [[nautiloid]] crashed close to their location. The leader, Gimblebock, wished to loot it straight away, but Taman was not so convinced.
