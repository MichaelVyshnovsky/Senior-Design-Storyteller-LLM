'''Thenmun''' was a lieutenant of [[Innarlith]]'s city guard in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Thenmun was a rising officer in the city guard of Innarlith in the late 1350s [[DR]]. At the time, the city was undergoing a project to rebuild the city walls. This project had been assigned to the master-builder of Innarlith, Senator [[Inthelph]]. However, Inthelph was too incompetent to complete the project, so he in turn recruited a [[Cormyr|Cormyrean]] engineer named Willem Korvan to help him complete it. Korvan, however, ended up making many mistakes in the complex [[mathematics]] involved in the reconstruction project and Thenmun had begun to notice them. Thenmun pointed out the mistakes and this hurt the reputation of Inthelph and Korvan. Inthelph was already being widely criticized for the wall reconstruction being over budget and this added to the pressure on his office.

Korvan decided to [[poison]] Thenmun in the year [[1358 DR]]. The poison resulted in Thenmun losing his sanity and being sent to a sanitarium in the fourth quarter of Innarlith. Eventually he was released from the sanitarium and put in the care of his mother, who took care of him like a baby. Korvan's involvement was not discovered by the public.
