Brammagar was a Harper of the late 14 century DR.
Brammagar was exultant and hot-headed, open to suggesting that great risks were taken.
In , after the Harpers learned what Vangerdahast planned on doing to replace the Lords who Sleep, one of the deliberations heard by Narnra Shalace at Dark my Harp yet Flaming included someone identified as Brammagar by the other Harpers arguing that they should slay any mages that turned up to steal Vangerdahasts magic, followed by destroying Vangerdahasts research at the right time.
