Umbero Zastro () was a half-elf magister in Waterdeep during the early 1490s DR.
Umbero presided over courts in the Dock Wards courthouse. He was known for his unconventional punishments and his use of poetic justice. 
In 1492 DR, if the Cassalanters managed to obtain the Stone of Golorr, then the Cassalanters doppelganger valet, posing as a City Watch captain, ordered the arrests of some adventurers that had recovered the Stone. Their case was discussed in front of magister Umbero.
