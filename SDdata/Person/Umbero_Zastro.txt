'''Umbero Zastro''' ({{Pronounce|um|BAIR|oh|_|ZASS|troh|refs=}}) was a [[half-elf]] magister in [[Waterdeep]] during the early 1490s [[DR]].
 
==Activities==
Umbero presided over courts in the [[Dock Ward]]'s courthouse. He was known for his unconventional punishments and his use of poetic justice. 

==History==
In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} if the [[Cassalanter]]s managed to obtain the ''[[Stone of Golorr]]'', then the Cassalanters' [[doppelganger]] valet, posing as a [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] captain, ordered the arrests of some adventurers that had recovered the Stone. Their case was discussed in front of magister Umbero.
