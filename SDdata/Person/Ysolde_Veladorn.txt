'''Ysolde Veladorn''' was the daughter of [[Qilué Veladorn]].
==History==
Ysolde was born to the [[Chosen]] of [[Eilistraee]] Qilué Veladorn and her companion [[Elkantar Iluim]] in the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]] in [[Skullport]].<ref>

In time, Ysolde also became a priestess of Eilistraee in the Promenade.<ref>

In [[1361 DR]], Qiluè agreed to help [[Liriel Baenre]] against the [[Vhaeraun]]-worshiping [[Dragon's Hoard]], sending her warriors to attack their headquarters. However, during the fighting, despite their victory, [[Gorlist]] killed Elkantar.

Later, Gorlist led the remaining Dragon's Hoard against the Promenade in revenge and in the fighting, where Ysolde was killed by [[Shakti Hunzrin]].
