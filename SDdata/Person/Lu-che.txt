Lu-che, also known as Sensei Lu-che, was a sohei participant at the Komite in Shou Lung.
Lu-che, training under Master Taembak Duahl in Shou Tulung, earned a 6th-degree black belt in the Four Keys style of kung fu.
Lu-che acted as the commander of the sohei detachment at the Temple of True Enlightenment in Suijeng. As was the custom of the temple, Lu-che and his men taught martial arts to local people for a modest fee. From this practice, Lu-che became known across the province as Sensei Lu-che.
In 1358 DR, Lu-che went to participate at the Komite, which was held on the grounds of his temple. He had many advantages by fighting in a familiar place and knowing well the tournaments rules, but many would expect his victory, putting Lu-che under tremendous pressure. Lu-che managed to finish among the tournaments finalists.
