}}'''Epricante''' was a [[drow]] warrior of [[House Xorlarrin]] living in [[Q'Xorlarrin]] in [[1484 DR]].

==History==
During the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in [[1485 DR]], he along his old associate [[Maffizo Vailentarne]] was part of a Xorlarrin reinforcement army sent to help the [[orc]] warlord [[Hartusk]] after an orc defeat near [[Mithril Hall]]. However, thanks to tge plotting of [[Gromph Baenre]] and [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]], Hartusk believed that Epricante and his army were traitors and attacked and destroyed them.
