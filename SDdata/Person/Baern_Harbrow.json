        "mainbody": "aern Harbrow was a War Wizard of Cormyr in Suzail during the late 15 century DR.\nHe was rather smug and unpleasant.\nHe carried a wand of sleep and likely some enchanted rings.\nIn the aftermath of the calamitous Council of the Dragon in the , Baern Harbrow, alongside no less than eight Purple Dragons and four more Wizards of War, was guarding the Hall of Victories.\nJust as Glathra Barcantle was about to order the capture of the mask dancer and coinlass, Amarune Whitewave, and the Marchioness Immerdusk, Storm Silverhand, Baern Harbrow magically farspoke to Glathra and reported to Glathra that Lord Arclath Delcastle, one of the guests at Council, had cut through his defenses with the aid of the ghost of the princess Alusair Obarskyr. She ordered him to continue defending his post, and after a brief struggle with Storm Silverhand, ordered him to capture the two of them, as they were headed his way. She also warned him that Storm Silverhand could reflect spells.\nOnce Amarune and Storm arrived, Baern Harbrow put her to sleep with his wand the war wizards with them then converged on Storm Silverhand, but she reflected their sleep magic with a special ring that allowed her to reflect all five spells on Harbrow himself, putting him out of commission. She later stole his wands and rings."
