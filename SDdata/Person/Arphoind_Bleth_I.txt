Arphoind Bleth was the child of Mondar Bleth and his wife, born in 8 DR or 10 DR. On p. 125 of Cormyr A Novel (paperback, 1998), it is stated that, as of 16 DR, Arphoind is "a strapling of all of eight winters" (in other words, eight years old), giving a date of birth of 8 DR. On p. 144 of the same book, it is stated that, as of 26 DR, Arphoind is "now sixteen" which would require his birth to have occurred in 10 DR. Sixteen in 26 DR is more likely because Mondar Bleth arrived in 10 DR and Ondeth Obarskyr was present for Arphoinds birth. Arphoind was the first man knighted by Faerlthann.  
Arphoinds father was Mondar Bleth. He was the youngest sibling, his mother having died whilst giving birth.
Over 1300 years later, another member of the Bleth family was given the name Arphoind. Arphoind Bleth II eventually became the head of the merchant family.
