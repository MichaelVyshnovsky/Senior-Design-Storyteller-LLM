        "Personality": "Phaerorn took particular note that youngsters seemed less brave now than they'd once been.",
        "Activities": "He had long been a cook at the Rain Bird Rooming House for a long time. There, in addition to his normal tasks, he kept a door in the worst room of the kitchens clear of obstructions: that door had a carving of a hook-nosed wizard, and was covered in peeling blue paint.",
        "Relationships": "He was an old friend of [[Elminster Aumar]], and had at least one son, who was working in [[Suzail]]. His least promising scullery boy was named [[Naviskurr]].",
        "History": "One night in early spring of the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, Phaerorn was cooking at the Rain Bird Rooming House and warning Naviskurr to ensure the door remained clear—he made this point vehemently, swinging a cleaver—when suddenly Elminster walked through that door. The wizard gave the cook news of his son. When Phaerorn explained to Naviskurr who the man was, the kid fainted."
