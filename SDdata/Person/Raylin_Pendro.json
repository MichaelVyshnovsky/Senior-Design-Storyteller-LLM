        "mainbody": "'''Raylin Pendro''' was a shady [[Pendro's Pawnshop|pawnshop]] owner in [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Raylin's pawnshop stood at the edge of Targos. The shabby decaying building was filled with miscellany, mediocre art, and anything else inhabitants of the town sold to make ends meet. At one point in the late [[1490 DR|1490s DR]], a down-on-his-luck ex-[[Harper]] named [[Edgin Darvis]] was forced to sell much of his worldly possessions to survive and feed his [[Kira|newborn child]] following his wife's death. Edgin befriended a [[barbarian]] woman named [[Holga Kilgore]] who encouraged him to take back what was pawned as Edgin lived in squalor. As an ex-Harper, Edgin could recognize signs of the dreaded Black Network—the [[Zhentarim]]—and he was convinced that Raylin Pendro had dealings with the shadowy organization.\n\nOne day, after Raylin closed the shop for the day and headed to town to get drunk, Edgin and Holga broke into the shop with surprising ease. Holga reclaimed pots, pans, trays, and other domestic items, and Edgin took back a delicate [[gold]] and [[emerald]] [[ring]], which was an anniversary gift for his late wife. He felt guilty over pawning it, but Edgin knew that [[Zia]] would not have approved of their child starving. Edgin attempted to find a [[tea]] set that his wife loved so, but it was likely long-sold.\n\nOne of the discoveries during Edgin's and Holga's heist was a hidden lockbox, filled to the brim with [[gold]] and [[silver]] [[coin]]s. The duo took the booty, but the [[bard]] knew that this amount of money was likely skimmed off of the Black Network by Pendro. Edgin made sure to drop the rumor of the pawnbroker stealing Zhentish money in a place from where it would eventually reach the Black Network's ears.\n\nSoon after the heist, Raylin Pendro took off and fled Targos leaving his rickety shop behind. Pendro's supposed distant family member subsequently took over the pawnshop. It was repaired and turned into a bakery that was famed for its [[cinnamon roll]]s, which were, by some accounts, some of the best in all the [[Sword Coast]]."
