        "mainbody": "Frenchy was a traveling bard and entertainer from the Dragon Reach in the The Vast, active in the late 14 century DR.\nAs a bard, Frenchy possessed some knowledge of the arcane and could cast such spells as color spray, ghost sound, charm person, magic missile, burning hands, and invisibility.\nFrenchy and his traveling companions carried several items they were willing to offer for trade. including a lute, an iron skillet pan, a spare set of leather armor, and a bundle of silk rope. Frenchy was armed with a simple short sword.\nIn the late 14 century DR, or in the Year of Great Change of the Malatran calendar, Frenchy and his fellow bards, Absolute, Scar, and Morton, traveled to the village of Lions Crossing to perform at a local festival. On their journey across the Dragon Reach, they came across a peculiar group of travelers, some of whom looked human, and some were of more exotic species, all speaking in a strange language and armed in primitive weapons compared to the common equipment found in the region. The group was heroes of the Living Jungle from the far land of Malatra who were transported to the Dragon Reach in search of a headshrinkers artifact. With the use of a tongues spell, the groups were able to communicate. The foreigners used strange words like garuda and katanga and seemingly did not know what the beasts of burden that dragged the bards wagon were. And the wagon itself was an alien piece of technology for the Malatrans. The bards and the Heroes of the Living Jungle parted ways after partaking in some trade."
