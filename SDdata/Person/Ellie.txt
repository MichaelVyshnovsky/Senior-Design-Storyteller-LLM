'''Ellie''' was a young fisherwoman from the city of [[Elturel]], whose life was cut short in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Ellie had a dark skin and curly reddish-brown hair. At the time of her death, the fisherwoman wore a simple blue [[tunic]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''[[spelljammer]]'' ''[[squid ship]]'' crashed into the shores of the [[River Chionthar]]. Ellie was a young fisherwoman who, along with several other poor souls, witnessed the crash. She saw an elven lass run from the crash, one of the survivors â€“ the woman named [[Shadowheart]], and Ellie ran to aid her. Unfortunately, the elf was not the only one to survive and Ellie was ripped to shreds by [[intellect devourer]]s who were onboard the magical vessel. The fisherwoman's body was left on the beach by the burning ''spelljammer''.
