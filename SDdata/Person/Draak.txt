Draak was one of the lieutenants of the Xanathar Thieves Guild in Skullport in 1479 DR.Derek Myers. "The Xanathar Beholder Crime Lord of Waterdeep." Dungeon #206. Renton, WA Wizards of the Coast, September 2012.
Born as a slave, Draak, thanks to his intelligence, managed to escape by orchestrating a revolt. Later he worked as a mercenary. 
Arriving in Waterdeep in 1478 DR, Draak found some of his slavers and decided that their best punishment was to become themselves slaves. He achieved this retribution, gaining a huge profit. Impressed, the Xanathar offered him a chance to work in the slaving sector of the Xanathars Guild and he accepted.
In 1479 DR, Draak was promoted to a lieutenants position.
Draak supervised all the guilds activities involving slaving. He had few but very loyal subordinates. Normally he first contacted the buyer and later captured the slaves.
Draak was serious and gruff. He was an able leader that ruled using intimidation. He took pleasure from others suffering. He had little loyalty toward the guild and cared nothing about its politics or the other lieutenants. He believed that very few beings deserved his respect and that all others were scum.
Draak resided in Skullport, where everyone knew him. Often he did businesses in a tavern in Mistshore.
Draak often worked closely with Sial Sapphire, needing her information.
