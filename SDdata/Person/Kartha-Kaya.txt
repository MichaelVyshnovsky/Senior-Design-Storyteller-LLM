'''Kartha-Kaya''' was the chief of a [[yak folk]] village near [[Ironslag]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
Kartha-Kaya lived with his fellow and his two wives [[Imberu]] and [[Nahala]] near Ironslag forge.

In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR Duke [[Zalto]] of the [[fire giant]]s forged a kind of nonaggression pact with Kartha-Kaya.

Usually he welcomed all guests to his village but secretly drugged them in order to keep them as slaves.
