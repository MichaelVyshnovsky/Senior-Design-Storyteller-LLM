Kartha-Kaya was the chief of a yak folk village near Ironslag sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Kartha-Kaya lived with his fellow and his two wives Imberu and Nahala near Ironslag forge.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR Duke Zalto of the fire giants forged a kind of nonaggression pact with Kartha-Kaya.
Usually he welcomed all guests to his village but secretly drugged them in order to keep them as slaves.
