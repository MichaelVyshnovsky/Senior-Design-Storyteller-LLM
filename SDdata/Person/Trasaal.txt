'''Trasaal the Gold Mage''' was a powerful [[transmuter]] [[armathor]] during the [[Weeping War|Fall of Myth Drannor]].

==History==
Trasaal was born in [[429 DR]].

In [[Eleint 9]] of [[713 DR]], based on a [[divination]], Trasaal led [[Akh'Faer]] troops to attack an [[Army of Darkness]] contingent at [[Iolrath]]'s tomb. They managed to destroy the [[fiend]] troops but Trasaal and the Akh'Faer leading officer [[Kyrtaar Ammath]] were killed.
