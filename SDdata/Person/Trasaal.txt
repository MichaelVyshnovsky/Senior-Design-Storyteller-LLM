Trasaal the Gold Mage was a powerful transmuter armathor during the Fall of Myth Drannor.
Trasaal was born in 429 DR.
In Eleint 9 of 713 DR, based on a divination, Trasaal led AkhFaer troops to attack an Army of Darkness contingent at Iolraths tomb. They managed to destroy the fiend troops but Trasaal and the AkhFaer leading officer Kyrtaar Ammath were killed.
