        "mainbody": "'''Golbraith Stredivas''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]], a retired [[adventurer]], a [[mind flayer]] hunter, and the author of ''[[Confidant of a Duke]]'' as well as ''[[On Psionic Manipulations and Countermeasures]]'', who resided in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Enter those for whom justice and truth are thine guiding lights.''|The plaque on Golbraith Stredivas's home.}}",
        "Description": "Golbraith was a man with curly hair and trimmed beard silvered with age. His skin had deep wrinkles and the scars of a life of danger. His blue eyes were framed by a [[monocle]], and his aged body was draped in mage's [[robe]]s. He had a habit of talking to himself, which developed in his late life's solitude.",
        "Abilities": "Golbraith Stredivas was an experienced war-caster wizard who was proficient in [[spell]]-sculpting.",
        "Relationships": "Sometime in his younger days, Golbraith fathered a son, who by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, was twice as great a fighter as Golbraith was and was also a capable illithid slayer, who lived away from Golbraith's large home in the Lower City.",
        "History": "In his youth, Golbraith made a living as an adventurer and a monster hunter. The wizard frequented the [[Elfsong Tavern]] in the Lower City when he was within Baldur's Gate's walls. During one of his ventures to \"feel the pulse of the city,\" the [[Grand Duke]] of the time, the famed [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Abdel Adrian]], met Golbraith at one of the terrace tables of the Elfsong. The two accidentally bought each other's drinks by calling the same waiter to them. The strangers stroke up a conversation, and when the Duke found out that Golbraith was a fellow adventurer and a monster hunter, he showered Stredivas with questions. At the next meeting, the Duke revealed that he, too, was an adventurer once, and afterward, they met regularly at the same tavern, turning conversations into a friendship. Many [[tenday]]s later, Golbraith realized that his new friend was the Grand Duke. Sometime before the Grand Duke's death, he gifted ''[[Abdel's trusted shield]]'' to his friend.\n\nWhen [[the Absolute]] menaced Baldur's Gate in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Golbraith was already an aged and retired man, forced to abandon the life of daring adventure after suffering a devious illiquid trap. Despite that, he was confident in the city's safety, knowing that his son fought for the Gate and for its people.",
        "Works": "He also penned a book about his friendship with Abdel Adrian, ''Confidant of a Duke'', as well as a guide to protecting oneself from mind flayers, ''On Psionic Manipulations and Countermeasures,'' sometime before 1492 DR."
