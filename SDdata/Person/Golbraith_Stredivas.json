The adventurer also had dealings with the Society of Brilliance and The Lodge in the Lower City. His work on anti-illithid countermeasures received some acclaim among adventurers, and some sent the author letters of gratitude and recounts of how the work saved their lives.\nIn his youth, Golbraith made a living as an adventurer and a monster hunter.
