        "mainbody": "'''Darkmaw the Wicked''', also known as '''The Terror of Cloakwood''', was a powerful and much-feared massive [[brown bear]] who lived on the [[Sword Coast]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Look at the size of that thing. It could eat a person whole—or a double portion of children. That's Darkmaw the Wicked! Imagine meeting him in the flesh—or rather, in the hide and stuffing. Everything from the Wood of Sharp Teeth to Cloakwood was his hunting ground, until a small army rallied to take him down.''|[[Shadowheart]] of [[Shar]]}}",
        "History": "Darkmaw the Wicked earned its infamy by being a vicious and fearsome predator who claimed the territory between the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]] and the [[Cloak Wood]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century DR. The bear, seemingly, killed for fun and preyed on the weakest and the oldest. Stories claimed that he killed more children than any [[vampire]] on the Sword Coast; they also stated that the monstrous bear was at last slain in a battle against an army of five hundred.\n\nAfter the beast's demise, Darkmaw's body was stuffed, its limbs broken to be posed and eyes replaced by glass marbles, and put on display at the [[Last Light Inn]] in the town of [[Reithwin]] in the [[Chionthar Valley]], sometime before the {{Yearlink|1373}},{{Thorm-time}} when a bitter war between General [[Ketheric Thorm]] consumed the town of Reithwin and an army of [[Harper]]s resulted in the region being swallowed by a dark [[Sharran]] ''[[curse]]''. The inn remained empty until the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when it was briefly freed from the curse by a group of Harpers. The stuffed body of Darkmaw the Wicked remained in the inn and the fearsome beast's legend was still remembered, as remarked on by some who saw the bear on display. Darkmaw's infamy was so grand that even the [[githyanki]] knew of the ferocious killer bear."
