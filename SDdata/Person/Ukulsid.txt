Ukulsid received his orders from Szass Tam himself. He permitted Valindra Shadowmantle to use his city as her headquarters only because this was the will of his master.
During the Shadovarâ€“Thay War, Ukulsid was in charge of Surcross as it came under assault from the flying Netherese citadel of Kolthunral.
