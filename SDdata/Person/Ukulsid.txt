'''Ukulsid''' was a [[dread warrior]] [[gnoll]] and the military commander and governor of the fortified town of [[Surcross]] in [[Thay]] as of {{Yearlink|1479}}.

==Activities==
As the military commander of the massive garrison in Surcross, Ukulsid was in charge of the forces stationed there to protect Thay's border with [[Thesk]].

As the governor of Surcross, Ukulsid met with his subjects and meted out justice from the [[Hall of Petition]] within the town's central citadel, known as the [[Tombstone]]. However, few Surcross inhabitants ever came to petition him owing to the fact that he was prone to kill any who annoyed him, and to then have their corpse [[Animate dead|reanimated]] to serve the town's garrison.

==Relationships==
Ukulsid received his orders from [[Szass Tam]] himself. He permitted [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] to use his city as her headquarters only because this was the will of his master.

==History==
During the [[Shadovarâ€“Thay War]], Ukulsid was in charge of Surcross as it came under assault from the flying [[Netheril|Netherese]] citadel of [[Kolthunral]].
