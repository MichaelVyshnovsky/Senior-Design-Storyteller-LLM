        "mainbody": "'''Wurik Snowstealer''' was [[Raryn Snowstealer]]'s brother, and an [[arctic dwarf]] from [[the Great Glacier]].{{cite book/The Ruin||3}}\n\nOn [[Marpenoth 14]] of {{yearlink|1373}}, Raryn returned to the Great Glacier, rescuing [[Joylin Snowstealer]], Wurik's daughter, from [[tirichik]]s along the way. Wurik, however, had since been impressed into service by [[Iyraclea]], who held several of his fellow tribesmen hostage. Under orders to deliver any strangers upon her, he contacted her soon after luring Raryn's party into his tribe, and feeding them poison made of a tirichik's organs to incapacitate them. However, when her [[gelugon]]s arrived looking for the captives, they deduced that he was holding one captive back: Wurik attempted to keep his brother from being taken. They slew him for it.\n\nWurik bore a [[bugle]] made of [[rothe]] [[horn]] for signaling."
