        "History": "Zeehad and Sayeed fought in [[the Twilight War]] of [[1374 DR]], where they had the thumbs of their fighting hands removed by [[Abelar Corrinthal]]'s troops.\n\nLater, during the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], Zeeahd was killed by its effects. \n\nWhen Zeeahd died, his soul went to [[Cania]]. There he bargained with [[Mephistopheles]] to become one of his agents on Faerûn in exchange for being returned to life there.\n\nIn [[1484 DR]], Zeeahd and his brother [[Sayeed]] went in search of the [[Abbey of the Rose]], in order to capture [[Vasen Cale]]. They arrived in the village of [[Fairelm]] where they discovered that the local peddler [[Minser]] had just visited the Abbey. So Sayeed and Zeeahd unleashed their pack of [[spined devil]]s to slaughter all inhabitants except Minser and [[Elle]], who had spoken against them, in order to force Minser to show them the right way.\n\nAfterward, Sayeed and Zeeahd invaded the Abbey. Zeeahd confronted the [[Oracle]], discovering him to be [[Elden Corrinthal]], the son of Abelar. Elden managed to humiliate Zeehad and so he ordered his [[spined devil]]s to kill Elden. However, the Oracle was well prepared for his death and died with a smile.\n\nLater, he fought with [[Gerak]], [[Vasen Cale]], and [[Orsin]], and at last he died as a man and was reborn as a [[bone devil]].\n\nAs a bone devil, Zeeahd wandered for a time until the just-arrived [[Rivalen Tanthul]] decided to kill all [[devil]]s around him. Sayeed tried to save the bone devil. Intrigued, Rivalen spoke to Sayeed and offered him the opportunity to serve [[Shar]]. Sayeed agreed and his first duty for Shar was to kill the bone devil that had been his brother.",
        "Powers": "Zeeahd's spellscar had twisted his body. When he died, he returned as a rotten creature. The Lord of the Eighth put inside him a creature that at regular times needed to hurt living beings."
