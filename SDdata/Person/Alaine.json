        "mainbody": "'''Alaine''' was a female [[human]] villager of [[Ember]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Alaine was a minor inhabitant of village of Ember, located near [[Luskan]].",
        "Gameplay": "Alaine would thank the [[Kalach-Cha]] and the companions for defeating the [[githyanki]], but could be responded to with hostility, causing [[Bishop]] to be impressed.\n\nAfter the Luskans destroyed Ember, the Kalach-Cha and the companions could go to [[Port Llast]] to talk with [[Haeromos Dothwintyl]], and could speak with Alaine. Alaine would become aggressive, but reveal that the Kalach-Cha (or someone that looked like the Kalach-Cha) had slain many villagers, with a dozen men. She escaped, but it could be learned that the Luskans had let her leave to spread word of what she saw. She would go to the trial to speak her testimony against the Kalach-Cha, but could be persuaded to reveal the truth."
