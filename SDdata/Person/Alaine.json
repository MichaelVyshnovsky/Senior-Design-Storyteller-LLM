Alaine would become aggressive, but reveal that the Kalach-Cha (or someone that looked like the Kalach-Cha) had slain many villagers, with a dozen men. She escaped, but it could be learned that the Luskans had let her leave to spread word of what she saw. She would go to the trial to speak her testimony against the Kalach-Cha, but could be persuaded to reveal the truth."
