        "mainbody": "'''Larendrammagar''', more commonly known as '''Nexus''', was a great wyrm [[gold dragon]] [[sorcerer]]",
        "Personality": "Larendrammagar was totally uninterested in the affairs of the world, except in the cases where [[magic]] was involved. He was brusque with people that were not interesting to him, but enjoyed having long conversations with intelligent and knowledgeable individuals.\n\nA rarity for a [[dragon]], Larendrammagar seldom collected any treasure and usually expended most of it acquiring rare [[magic item]]s, reagents for his [[spell]]s, and [[spellbook]]s.",
        "Activities": "Larendrammagar dedicated his whole life to the study of magic, and was reputed to be the most talented [[spellcaster]] among the [[metallic dragon]]s. Larendrammagar also gave advice to those who sought him for his arcane wisdom, or appraised magic items if asked to do so, but he usually charged high prices for such services.",
        "Allies": "He was good friends with the gold dragons [[Lareth]]",
        "Lair": "Larendrammagar had a lair in the [[Galena Mountains]], and it was rumored that he also had another lair in the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]].",
        "Abilities": "Larendrammagar had the ability to cast more spells that any dragon naturally could, and was able to use both [[Arcane magic|arcane]] and [[divine magic]]. This ability was granted to him by the dragon [[god]]dess [[Kereska]] as a reward for his dedication to the research of magic.",
        "History": "When he was 500 years old, Larendrammagar dedicated his life to the study of magic, and over the years developed most of the unique spells only dragons could cast. \n\nIn [[1373 DR]], when Lareth convened a conclave in the Galena Mountains to inform the metallic dragons of the incoming [[Rage of Dragons]], Larendrammagar devised a spell that would bind them to ''[[sleep]]'' until the Rage subsided. He also put his friend Protanther to ''sleep'', to protect him from the ravages of the Rage.\n\nWhen Lareth and his lieutenant [[Tamarand]] challenged each other over whether to help humanoid races against the Rage, Larendrammagar was awoken from his sleep to be one of the witnesses of the duel, the other being the captain of the [[Talons of Justice]], [[Havarlan]].\n\nAfter the duel, Larendrammagar agreed to help [[Dorn Graybrook]] and his companions in researching the ''[[Dracorage mythal]]''. Using lore from the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]], the great wyrm managed to reconstruct the [[elven high magic]] rite used to curse dragonkind and devise a counterspell that would wipe the enchantment away, but only if cast in the right place. \n\nAfter the defeat of [[Sammaster]], who had used an ancient [[elven]] citadel as his headquarters, Larendrammagar completed the allied force's victory by casting a potent spell of banishment that returned the Sammaster dragon allies to their native planes of existence.\n\nAfter the last Dracorage, he and Tamarand helped the Talons of Justice in some of their missions. Their last mission was to help the Talons locate a former member of the order who had become a rebel, the dragon [[Arendelonthos]].",
        "Spells": "Larendrammagar devised many unique spells that only dragons could cast. This is an (possibly) incomplete list of his many spells. The most widely known are:\n\n* ''[[Breathblock]]''\n* ''[[Calm]]''\n* ''[[Cold Curtain]]''\n* ''[[Contact Archetype]]''\n* ''[[Door of death|Death Door]]''\n* ''[[Find humanoid familiar|Find Humanoid Familiar]]''\n* ''[[Hand (spell)|Hand]]''\n* ''[[Venomdust]]''",
        "Magic items": "Larendrammagar was credited to have created the ''[[Stone of Aerial Alarm|stones of aerial alarm]]''. He also used a wand of lightning."
