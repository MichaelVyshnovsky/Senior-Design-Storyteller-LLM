tiefling
Makos was a tiefling warlock lich who lived in Neverwinter in the late years of the 15 century DR.
Makos grew up as a street urchin, but he was fiercely ambitious and determined to rise above his station. To that end, he entered into an infernal pact with the fiend Arikas.
In 1479 DR, Makos took part in the Siege of Neverwinter. Together with the guardsman sergeant Knox, the cleric Celeste, and the rogue Xuna, Makos brought down a dracolich in Valindra Shadowmantles service. After defeating the undead dragon, Makos bound its soul to prevent it from returning to its phylactery.
When the Thayans created a Dread Ring within the Neverwinter Wood, Makos joined the Neverwinter Vanguard in assaulting it. He was also instrumental in stopping the plans of the demon lord Baphomet to reshape the world with the Maze Engine Makos defeated the drow wizard Vizeran DeVir who tried to claim its power for himself, and then destroyed the artifact. Makos later journeyed to Icewind Dale to represent Neverwinter at a festival in Bryn Shander, only to find the town devastated by the Ring of Winter. After freeing Artus Cimber from his icy prison, Makos joined Catti-brie, Wulfgar, Xuna, and the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge in assaulting Fangbreaker Island to retrieve the Ring of Winter from the frost giant Storvald. The assault failed, and Makos was slain by Drufi.

Makos eventually made his way to Evernight, where he lived until Alric Vallenhas arrived with Etrien Sael and the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge and asked the warlock to provide them passage to the Nine Hells. Makos agreed, waiving payment in lieu of joining them for purposes of his own. There, he aided the heroes against Bel. He later transported them to Fort Knucklebone in Avernus to try and retrieve Zariels sword.
