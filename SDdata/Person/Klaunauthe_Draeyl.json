        "mainbody": "'''Klaunauthe Draeyl''' was a high [[priest]]ess of [[Shar]] active during the 1{{st}} century [[DR]]. She was the owner of [[Gorothir's Girdle]], a divine [[relic]] of her faith.",
        "History": "Klaunauthe was an ambitious priestess who served in the [[church of Shar]] under the Dark Heart [[Jurguth Goroth]], grandson of the mythical priest [[Gorothir]].\n\nOne night of {{YearlinkName|469}}, the ''Dark Lady'' whispered in her dreams. She commanded her to slay her superior and take the divine ''Girdle'' he was wearing, which she did in a spectacular fashion. On [[Eleint 11]]{{th}} of the same year, she used her magic to smash Jurguth to a bloody pulp against the ceiling of their [[temple]] during a [[ritual]]. She absorbed his life essence to empower her own life and magic, and took both his ''Girdle'' and his position for herself.\n\nOn [[Hammer 3]]{{rd}} of the {{YearlinkName|554}}, a band of adventurers known as the [[Fellowship of Athul's Sash]] attacked the [[House of Reverence to the Dark Lady]] looking for treasures. Despite the heavy defenses of the temple, a [[warrior]] known as [[Rulgond]] managed to reach Klaunauthe and kill her by striking his [[sword]] through one of the gap in her [[corset]]'s lacings."
