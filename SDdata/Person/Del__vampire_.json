Ahh, you have found some helpers to aid in your chase. I wonder if your saviors will prove as useful as you hope.''|}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the criminal underbelly of Athkatla erupted in an all-out guild wars between the Shadow Thieves and a vampire coven under the leadership of [[Bodhi]]. Del was a loyal follower of the coven's leader and hunted down Shadow Thieves for her mistress. [[Sansuki]] was among those unfortunate thieves whom Del tracked and chased down across Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Scepter District|Scepter District]] along with two other bloodsuckers. Sansuki's life was forfeit as he had no chance to stand against the undead. Later, she would chase [[Abdel Adrian]] on orders from Bodhi to the isle of [[Brynnlaw]], along with vaporizes [[Valen]] and [[Parisa]]."
