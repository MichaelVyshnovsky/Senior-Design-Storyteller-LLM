        "mainbody": "'''Simon Weems''' was an unfortunate insurance salesman from the settlement of [[Wikipedia:Lake_Geneva,_Wisconsin|Lake Geneva]] in the land of [[Wikipedia:Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] on [[Earth]] who briefly traveled to [[Toril]].",
        "Description": "He had a short beard and mustache and wore glass [[spectacles]], a strange gray fabric outfit in three pieces, a brightly colored strip of cloth knotted around his neck like a noose, highly polished black leather short boots, and a [[gold]] bracelet. This outlandish appearance prompted the locals of [[Havenmere]] to assume he was some sort of [[demon]], monster, or harbinger of death.",
        "Personality": "During his time on Toril, Weems was confused and helpless, not fully understanding where he was or what had happened.",
        "Abilities": "Weems was a rather sedentary and unfit man, unused to physical labor or exertion. He had a condition that required a specific \"amino acid\" in his diet that was not found on Toril, meaning his life there would be short.",
        "Possessions": "Weems had a variety of odd implements on his person, including a stopped wrist-clock called a \"Rolex\", an inert \"pager\", and a gold [[pen]] with an empty internal [[ink]] reservoir worth about 1 [[gp]].",
        "History": "Sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a spontaneous ''[[gate]]'' transported Simon Weems to Toril along with a creature called the [[Demon (Havenmere)|Demon]], appearing in the village of [[Havenmere]]. The villagers took him for a monster and quickly subdued the confused [[planeswalker]], tying him up to be burnt on a pyre. Before he could be turned to ash, he was rescued by passing [[adventurer]]s who proceeded to investigate the situation, with the assistance of the learned local [[Senecus]].\n\nPresuming that a \"vector balance\" was in effect between Weems and the Demon, the adventurers quested forth and captured the beast, ideally reuniting the two and sending the both of them home to their respective planes."
