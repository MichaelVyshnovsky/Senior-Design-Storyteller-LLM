Tsernoth was a necromancer that inhabited Iriaebor.
In the 14 century DR, the necromancer made a deal with the banshee, Agatha. As part of the deal, Tsernoth received Bowgentles Book, a spellbook of the renowned mage, Bowgentle. Over 100 years later, the Harpers attempted to discern the location from the banshee, to no avail.
