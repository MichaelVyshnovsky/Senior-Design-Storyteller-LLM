        "mainbody": "'''Euryale''' was a [[medusa]]The text never calls Euryale a [[medusa]] or describes her. However, given that [[Marrec]] had snakes growing out of his hair as an infant and later developed a petrifying gaze upon puberty, he is strongly implied to have medusa ascendance. The [[blightlord]] [[Damanda]] describes him as a medusa when he reveals his powers, and Marrec himself considers the use of his power as calling upon a medusa's gaze. Euryale and [[Sthenno]], Marrec's aunts, consider themselves to be of a specific kind with Marrec's mother, distinct from Marrec's father; [[Thanial Selwander]] claims one of Marrec's parents must've been human. This article concludes that Marrec's mother is a medusa, and so are her sisters.  Furthermore, Sthenno, Medusa, and Euryale are the names of the three [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgon gorgons] in the Greek myth of Medusa. and [[Marrec]]'s aunt. She never missed his hiding spot while playing hide and seek. Neither she nor her sister, [[Sthenno]], liked when Marrec's mother brought up the memory of his father, insisting that he was too vulnerable, and not of their kin.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|91-92|11}}"
