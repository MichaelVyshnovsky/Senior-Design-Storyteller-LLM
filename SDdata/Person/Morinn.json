        "mainbody": "Morinn was the king of Citadel Felbarr as of the late 15 century DR.\nLike his queen, Morinn was known for being a particularly wise ruler. \nMorinn shared equal authority over her people along with his wife Tithmel. The two were distant relatives of the famous dwarven king, Emerus Warcrown.\nMorinn owned a splendid suit of ceremonial armor, forged for him by the Royal Armorer, Ghelryn Foehammer.\nSome time after the War of the Silver Marches of 1485 DR, the Morinn and Tithmel received accounts of fire giants passing through the hills located to the northwest of Citadel Felbarr. Fearing the worst, they employed a band of adventurers to investigate the subterranean fire giant forge known as Ironslag."
