        "mainbody": "Krieger was a deep gnome councilor of the city of Blingdenstone in 1370 DR. Before becoming a councilor, he was a burrow warden. \nKrieger was a very independent individual, even for a former burrow warden and indulged in unorthodox strategies. His former work made Krieger very conscious of all the dangers of the Underdark and his skills were very useful for his later position as councilor, especially because of the threat of vengeance by the Menzoberranzan drow after their war against Mithral Hall. \nFor a time, he was a burrow warden until he become a councilor for the city after the war with the drow of Menzoberranzan."
