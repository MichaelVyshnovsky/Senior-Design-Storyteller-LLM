Belpheron (or Balpheron) was an ancient and powerful lich who once tried to destroy Faer√ªn. He was the mentor of Heurodis.
Belpherons mummified hand somehow ended up in the possession of the Harpers, who gave it to Drogan Droganson for safekeeping. The hand was stolen from Droganson by a band of kobolds for the dragon Tymofarrar. The hand had the ability to point to other artifacts of power.
A resident of Cania, Belpheron aided Grimgnaw in his fight against Drogan Drogansons pupil.
