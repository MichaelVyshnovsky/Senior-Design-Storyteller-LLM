'''Belpheron''' (or '''Balpheron''') was an ancient and powerful [[lich]] who once tried to destroy [[Faer√ªn]]. He was the mentor of [[Heurodis]].

Belpheron's mummified hand somehow ended up in the possession of the [[Harpers]], who gave it to [[Drogan Droganson]] for safekeeping. The hand was stolen from Droganson by a band of [[kobold]]s for the [[dragon]] [[Tymofarrar]]. The hand had the ability to point to other artifacts of power.

A resident of [[Cania]], Belpheron aided [[Grimgnaw]] in his fight against [[Drogan Droganson's pupil]].
