Qildor Rewen was an inhabitant of Cormanthyr in the 3 century DR.
He was young and handsome, with a very eloquent stare.
During a revel, he was seen with a silver-hilted sword.
He was a guest together with Aurae Shaeremae at a revel in , where Elminster Aumar substituted Eltargrim. There, he was rather blunt with the human Armathor, but appeared to come out of it with as good an impression as possible.
