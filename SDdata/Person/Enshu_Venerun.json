        "mainbody": "'''Enshu Venerun''' was a [[werewolf]] servant of [[Sel没ne]], who was part of the [[New Moon Pact]] in the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Enshu was a stout woman, with a large scar across her face and strong hands.",
        "History": "{{quote\n|Some things should never be understood.\n|''Enshu advising Feena on [[The Leaves of One Night|dark matters]]''\n}}\n\nEnshu served Sel没ne as a werewolf of the New Moon Pact, fighting against the faith's enemies in the same darkness they lurked in. In [[757 DR]], the High Moonmistress [[Brima Chintamn]] of [[Bright Lady's Tower]] in [[Chancelgaunt]] declared the New Moon Pact a heresy, and Enshu was among those targeted. She was slain attempting to avoid capture by the [[Church of Sel没ne|church]]'s forces.\n\nWhen [[Feena Archwood]] investigated the mystery of the New Moon Pact in [[1373 DR]], Enshu's spirit appeared in her dreams alongside the other members of the Pact to defend and guide her. After she uncovered [[Velsinore]]'s heresy and they mutually slew each other, Feena's spirit was met by a [[Shards|Shard]] escort to the afterlife, but the spirits of the Pact members encouraged her to return to life and join the New Moon Pact herself. With the aid of [[Julith Harkspur]]'s healing, Feena was revived and ultimately continued the legacy of the Pact."
