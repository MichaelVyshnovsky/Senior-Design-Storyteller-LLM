==History==
{{Quote|I can't see anything. Something's wrong...Who's there? Meg? Is that-|Yonas' final words.}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Yonas, [[Meygan]], and [[Lassandra]] embarked on a mission through the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]], having embarked from the [[Last Light Inn]]. During their expedition, Yonas strayed too far from the [[torch]]light provided by his allies and was abducted by a [[shadow]]. In short order, he was transformed into a malformed husk that resembled something akin to a [[zombie]].
