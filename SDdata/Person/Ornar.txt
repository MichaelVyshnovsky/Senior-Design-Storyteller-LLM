Ornar of the Claw was one of the Overwizards of the Arcane Brotherhood in the 1360s DR.
Circa 1365 DR, Ornar was famous for the claw-related combat spells he created.
He was busy creating some new magic storm spells. He plotted to conquer Hellgate Keep, Silverymoon, Everlund, and Sundabar, using Uthgardt barbarians as fodder.
In 1371 DR, after Eldeluc and Valkebars coup against the Archmage Arcane, Arklem Greeth, Ornar pledged his loyalty to the conspirators. When Greeth returned, now transformed into a lich with some new devilish allies, Ornar escaped to a hideout in the Evermoors. 
Ornar was an able strategist that never forget a face. He tried to look kind in order to avoid having too many enemies.
