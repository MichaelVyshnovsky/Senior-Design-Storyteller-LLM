        "mainbody": "aunchi was an Oigur guide living in the Hordelands during the mid 14 century DR.\nKaunchi was a thoroughly wicked individual who was dangerous and deceitful. He was adept at masking his true nature from others. Easily insulted, Kaunchi viewed any form of reprimand as a direct challenge. He looked down upon anyone who was not a nomad of the steppes and felt no bond of honor or duty to them.\nHe earned a living as a guide through the Hordelands, though this was usually a ruse to lure caravans into traps set by his fellow Oigur."
