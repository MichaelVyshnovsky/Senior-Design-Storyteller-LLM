        "mainbody": "'''Kaunchi''' was an [[Oigur]] guide living in the [[Hordelands]] during the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Kaunchi was a thoroughly wicked individual who was dangerous and deceitful. He was adept at masking his true nature from others. Easily insulted, Kaunchi viewed any form of reprimand as a direct challenge. He looked down upon anyone who was not a nomad of the steppes and felt no bond of honor or duty to them.",
        "Activities": "He earned a living as a guide through the Hordelands, though this was usually a ruse to lure caravans into traps set by his fellow Oigur."
