        "mainbody": "'''Captain Haegan''' was a slaver who lived in the [[Amn]]ian city of [[Athkatla]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Who in the Nine Hells are you? Why have you barged in here with drawn weapons and attacked my men? If you want to be buying some slaves from me, you're going about it the wrong way.''|Captain Haegan}}",
        "Abilities": "Haegan and his fellow slavers operated a stockade in the slums of Athkatla's [[Athkatla/River District|River District]]. They carried out their operations in a building that appeared to be a converted sailing ship, located across the street from the [[Copper Coronet]] tavern.",
        "Possessions": "Captain Haegan wore a suit of ''[[enchanted]] +1 [[studded leather armor]]'' and a simple horned [[helmet]]. He armed himself with a [[two-handed sword]] and [[throwing axe]]s. Among other things, Haegan carried ''[[potions of extra healing]]'' and a ''[[potion of frost giant strength]]''.\n\nHe was in possession of a key that opened every cell within the subterranean slavers' stockade.",
        "History": "Captain Haegan operated out of Athkatla ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1369}} and slavers under his command were red-[[robe]]d [[wizard]], [[priest]]s of [[Cyric]], and [[yuan-ti]]. His stock was auctioned off in the black market backrooms of the Copper Coronet. Haegan slaves were captured as far as the town of [[Scornubel]], and a group was captured from there in 1369 DR for a buyer from [[Calimport]]. A young girl was among the captured humans. The entire group was bound to be executed after the buyer decided to abandon the order, and the slaves were deemed worthless. [[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions may have ruined the illegal slaving operations, freeing the young girl and other captives, slaying Haegan in the process."
