        "mainbody": "Lhammaruntosz was a bronze dragon who ran the Scaly Eye shipping company on the Sword Coast.\nA kindly and curious dragon, she enjoyed the company of humans.\nImprisonment and restraint were abhorrent to Lhammaruntosz, as a result of her cruel childhood.\nLike many dragons, Lhammaruntosz altered her own name over the years. She was born by the name Rauthra, and later adopted \"Lhammaruntosz\", which echoed the names of her own mother, Tauntzoth, as well as the famously aggressive copper dragon Lhammarar.\nShe was gifted in the Art.\nShe had an unnatural ability to rapidly regenerate lost organs and limbs. She could use this ability to trigger a burst of magical healing to restore herself.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Lhammaruntosz and the remaining members of the Scaly Eye served as keepers of the Bronze Shrine, a seaside temple of Bahamut on the Sword Coast North.\nShe reportedly owned a number of magic items capable of creating acidic explosions midair.\nAs the owner of the Scaly Eye shipping company, Lhammaruntosz took great pains to protect her fleet. She used farscry to watch over her ships, and would fly out to repel any threats they encountered. Over time, these furious defenses made passage through the pirate-infested Nelanther Isles possible.\nThe heavy protection afforded her ships inspired other vessels to fly false Scaly Eye banners. At least one pirate ship attempted such a masquerade, but was torn apart at sea by Lhammaruntosz. The trick was also attempted by at least five other ship captains, including Essegn Anarvible of Neverwinter. These were hunted down and scared into surrendering their ships to the Scaly Eye.\nLhammaruntosz facilitated a \"fast mail\" system where she would fly items and messages from a ship leaving port to another nearing port elsewhere, dropping them off using a \"dropline\" with a hook attachment to be caught in the rigging.\nGenerally speaking, Lhammaruntosz was beloved by the sailors who crewed her ships. They felt safe and proud to sail under her banner, and affectionately referred to her as \"Mother Wyrm\".\nLhammaruntosz tried to avoid conflict with other dragons whenever possible.\nLhammaruntosz was born to the insane dragon Tauntzoth who laired on Finback, one of the Whalebones in the Trackless Sea. Tauntzoth suffered from delusional paranoia which worsened with age. Lhammaruntosz, born Rauthra, was among the last in a series of offspring birthed by Tauntzoth whose fathers she had invariably killed. Young Rauthra was chained down and used as a test subject in magical experiments conducted by Tauntzoth, who sought to develop spells dealing with magical regeneration. Although these experiments were successful, Tauntzoth took them too far, her insanity compelling her to augment her body until it became a twisted and bloated wreck of frail and vestigial limbs. In the end, Tauntzoth grew unable to leave her lair and suffered from continual hunger, which she sated by eating Lhammaruntosz over and over again, her daughter regenerating in between meals. This went on for at least two hundred years. Eventually, Lhammaruntosz was able to break her chains and escape her mothers lair.\nAt one point she feuded with High Captain Rethnor of Luskan. Although dark rumors abounded as to the exact details, the conflict was eventually somehow resolved.\nLhammaruntosz and her Scaly Eye fleet were seen as defenders of the waters off the Sword Coast North by the likes of towns like Leilon. At some point prior to the Spellplague, the Swords of Leilon adventuring company funded the construction of the Bronze Shine in Lhammaruntoszs honor. She and the Scaly Eye eventually retired to this temple, and by the late 15 century DR, as her followers grew old and began dying out, she became susceptible to the depredations of an alkilith. This demon fed hallucinations to the dragon of her friends being slain and of her enemies triumphing, driving her to become a delusional recluse who only ever left the shrine to hunt for food. Meanwhile, the surviving members of the Scaly Eye grew increasingly concerned for their Mother Wyrm.\nMany of Lhammaruntoszs early exploits were recounted in the ballad \"The Wandering Wyrm\", composed by the minstrel Aldersound Bucklebar.\nAlthough her sailors often boasted of Lhammaruntoszs protection, most other sailors dismissed it as a tall tale."
