        "History": "During [[Gondegal]]'s short-lived war of conquest of Cormyr in the {{YearlinkName|1352}}, the so-called Lost King slaughtered much of Knightengale's order before his downfall and flight from justice. Naming herself his arch-nemesis, she tracked him down—perhaps the only person to do so—and suffered the same fate, as she too was swallowed by the Mists and caught in the [[Demiplane of Dread]].\n\nThere, Knightengale continued to hunt Gondegal while he dwelled within the grim domain of [[w:c:ravenloft:Falkovnia|Falkovnia]].",
        "Possessions": "Knightengale wielded a ''+5 [[holy avenger]] [[sword]]'' and wore ''+4 [[full plate]] [[armor]] of [[blending]]'' with a ''[[ferroniere of brilliance]]''."
