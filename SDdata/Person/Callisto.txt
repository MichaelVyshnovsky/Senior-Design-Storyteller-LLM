Duchess Callisto was the preeminent member of the ursinals and one of the Companions of Talisid, the Celestial Lion of Elysium. According to the World Tree cosmology, Callisto resided with Talisid and the other guardinal paragons, in the House of Nature.
The duchess was the wisest and strongest of the philosophical ursinals. She was both an exceptionally powerful mage and a high-ranking priestess.
By the late 14 century DR, Duchess Callisto had been replaced by Bharrai, the Great Bear.
