Oriphaun McMaren was a Chondathan human swordsage in the city of Procampur in the Vast.
He was a practitioner of blade magic and led an order of crusaders based at a sword-temple in Procampur. They were usually engaged in providing security at major events and noble galas, as well as guarding visiting dignitaries. By the context of the "Class Chronicles Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades" article, Oriphaun and his crusader order are implied to follow Torm and are thus likely attached to the House of the Hand. McMaren is listed as a swordsage yet appears in a section about crusaders, suggesting that this in error and that he should be a crusader.
