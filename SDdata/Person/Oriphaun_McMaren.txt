'''Oriphaun McMaren''' was a [[Chondathan]] [[human]] [[swordsage]] in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]].

He was a practitioner of [[blade magic]] and led an order of [[crusader]]s based at a sword-temple in Procampur. They were usually engaged in providing security at major events and noble galas, as well as guarding visiting dignitaries.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades}} <ref group="note">By the context of the "Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades" article, Oriphaun and his crusader order are implied to follow [[Torm]] and are thus likely attached to the [[House of the Hand]]. McMaren is listed as a swordsage yet appears in a section about crusaders, suggesting that this in error and that he should be a crusader.
