        "mainbody": "Tamorlin was an elven adventurer who made a fateful excursion into the Watchers Keep, before being trapped within.\nDuring his time in the keep, Tamorlin kept a journal that detailed his efforts to map out the level he was stuck in.\nWhen Tamorlin and his companions ventured into Watchers Keep, nearly all of them were slain â€“ only Tamorlin survived. He managed to reach the maze-like third level but could not find his way out. Over time he slowly went insane, though not incurably so."
