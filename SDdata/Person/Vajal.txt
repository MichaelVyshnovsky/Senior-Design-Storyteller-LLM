'''Vajal the Dark''' was a member of the [[Shields of the Highland]] adventuring company in [[Tethyr]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Description==
Vajal was a [[Calishite]] man with dark, long hair and a well-trimmed beard.

==History==
Vajal hailed from a village near the [[Forest of Mir]] like all his companions.

On [[Uktar 8]], 1370 DR, the Shields of the Highland lost two of their members while guarding a caravan. Unexpected cold weather led to snow, and a band of fourteen [[gnoll]]s were able to track them and attack them, killing two of them during the ensuing battle.

At dusk two days later, Vajal and the other three survivors went to the [[Blue Badger Inn]] in the village of [[Toralth]] to grieve their loss. Vajal, despite complaints from the barkeep, constantly carved strange symbols into the wooden tabletops with his knife.

Later that night, three [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Bapar Ghalmrin]], [[Odak Truesteel]], and [[Soram Battlebellow]], entered the tavern seeking the ''[[Sondarr Scepter]]'' and interrupting the ballad that Fylson was singing for [[Dumax]]. This greatly angered the Shields of the Highland. When [[Bramas Thorntree]], another patron, accused some of the other patrons of stealing the ''scepter'', [[Timor]], [[Karr]], and Vajal got up from their chairs and began throwing their beer [[mug]]s and swinging their chairs. Timor's mug struck the dwarf leader Bapar, and a tavern brawl was started when Soram stepped up to defend his prince. Bramas and his companions, the [[Company of the Anvil]] used this as an opportunity to escape with the ''scepter''.
