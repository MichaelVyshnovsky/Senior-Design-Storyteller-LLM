Jhessail Silvertree () was one of the original Knights of Myth Drannor during the mid-14 century DR.
Jhessail was slim and strikingly beautiful, with greenish-gray eyes and fiery orange hair. She was particularly strong-willed, passionate and extremely skilled in her practice of the Art.
From her comrades in the Knights of Myth Drannor, to her husband and daughter, Jhessails life was rich with people who cared about her greatly.
Among her belongings were a pearl of power, a set of bracers of defense and a ring of shooting stars.
Jhessail was born in Espar in Cormyr to two foresters, Craig and Lhanna who were friends of elves. Always fascinated by magic, Jhessail was tutored by elves and the wizard Hezom.
She went to adventure with Florin Falconhand, Doust Sulwood, Jelde Asturien, and Islif Lurelake. During one of their first adventures, however, Martess, a fellow apprentice of Hezom, died and this hurt the young wizard but helped her to mature, becoming a mother figure for her companions.
Jhessail flirted with Jelde but later fell in love with the elf Merith Strongbow, who asked for her hand in marriage in front of all the Elven Court. Their wedding took place on Alturiak 15, 1356 DR.
From the marriage, Jhessail gave birth to the half-elf Veluthil Silverbow on Mirtul 1, 1357 DR. Veluthil was baby-sat by Illistyl Elventree when Jhessail was needed by her fellow Knights.
