'''Jhessail Silvertree''' ({{Pronounce|jes|SAIL|refs=}}) was one of the original [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
From her comrades in the Knights of Myth Drannor, to her husband and daughter, Jhessail's life was rich with people who cared about her greatly.

==Possessions==
Among her belongings were a ''[[pearl of power]]'', a set of ''[[bracers of defense]]'' and a ''[[ring of shooting stars]]''.

==History==
Jhessail was born in [[Espar]] in [[Cormyr]] to two foresters, [[Craig Silvertree|Craig]] and [[Lhanna Silvertree|Lhanna]] who were friends of [[elves]]. Always fascinated by [[magic]], Jhessail was tutored by elves and the [[wizard]] [[Hezom]].

She went to adventure with [[Florin Falconhand]], [[Doust Sulwood]], [[Jelde Asturien]], and [[Islif Lurelake]]. During one of their first adventures, however, [[Martess]], a fellow apprentice of Hezom, died and this hurt the young wizard but helped her to mature, becoming a mother figure for her companions.

Jhessail flirted with Jelde but later fell in love with the elf [[Merith Strongbow]], who asked for her hand in marriage in front of all the [[Elven Court]]. Their wedding took place on [[Alturiak 15]], [[1356 DR]].

From the marriage, Jhessail gave birth to the [[half-elf]] [[Veluthil Silverbow]] on [[Mirtul 1]], [[1357 DR]]. Veluthil was baby-sat by [[Illistyl Elventree]] when Jhessail was needed by her fellow Knights.
