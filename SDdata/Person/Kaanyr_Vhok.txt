'''Kaanyr Vhok''' was a [[cambion]], leader of the [[Scoured Legion]] (sometimes seen as Scourged Legion), and Master of [[Hellgate Keep]].

==Description==
As the son of a [[marilith]] and a human father, Vhok appeared mostly humanoid, but with light olive-colored skin and silver hair. Most believed him to be an aging [[half-elf]] due to his pointed ears. Beneath his rich clothes, Vhok's chest, arms, and legs were covered with deep green scales that showed his [[tanar'ri]] heritage.

His skin was finely scaled and he had strong features. He had pointed teeth. He was tall and had the strength of a stone giant. He had red skin that was hot and hard enough to turn a blade. He was also handsome, despite his black teeth. He could fly at will and was resistant to fire.

Vhok's symbol was a scepter in a gauntleted hand.

==Personality==
Vhok was very charismatic. 

==Activities==
Kaanyr had learned the secrets of the creation of [[Talisman of spell turning|''talismans of spell turning'']], and he and his bands of [[tanarukk]]a actively began to spread the knowledge of how to craft them to [[orc]] tribes in the [[Nether Mountains|Nether]], [[Rauvin Mountains|Rauvin]], and [[Greypeak Mountains]] and in the [[Fallen Lands]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}}{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 10}}

==History==
===Hellgate Keep===
Kaanyr's plots and maneuverings, as well as his luck, led to his survival in the political infighting of Hellgate Keep's [[tanar'ri]] and his eventual rise to the command of the surviving forces of Hellgate Keep. He and his consort, [[Aliisza]], were trapped under Hellgate Keep for decades. He had three mariliths under him (known as the "Triumvirate"), including his mother, [[Mulvassyss]]. He used the mariliths against each other and then slew his own mother to take command of the demons trapped under Hellgate Keep. He subsequently used them to form the main forces of the Scoured Legion when he occupied Ammarindar.

He would much rather have quietly operated in secret for years. However, due to a combination of fate and his own desire for secret plots, Vhok, and much of his army, were deep beneath the Keep when, in [[1369 DR]], the ''[[Gatekeeper's Crystal]]'' brought much of it crashing down and thus thrusting him to a position that required quick action.

===War of the Spider Queen===
{{Main|War of the Spider Queen}}
In [[1372 DR]], Vhok allied with King [[Horgar Steelshadow]] of [[Gracklstugh]] and the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] against the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]], and his [[Scoured Legion]] participated in the final and unsuccessful [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]], foiled at the eleventh hour due to the timely return of [[Lolth]]. Vhok retreated quickly, preserving the greater part of his army of tanarukka, allowing the [[duergar]], who were not yet aware of Lolth's return, to bear the brunt of drow retribution while covering his retreat. He then led the Scoured Legion to set up its base at Hellgate Keep once again.

===The Empyrean Odyssey===
{{Main|The Empyrean Odyssey}}
In [[1373 DR]], not long after his defeat at Menzoberranzan, Vhok attempted to take control of the city of [[Sundabar]] because of some rivalry he had with [[Helm Dwarf-Friend]]. He first used Aliisza to infiltrate Helm Dwarf-Friend's house, then allied with [[Zasian Menz]] and [[Bane|Banite]] priests, devising a plan to use Aliisza's pregnancy to secretly enter the [[House of the Triad]] and bathe in the energy-rich waters of the [[Lifespring]]. Vhok, Zasian, and the [[Half-dragon|draconic]] [[hobgoblin]] [[Myshik Morueme]] traveled through the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] to a portal to the House of the Triad, which Aliisza opened from the other side.

However, Zasian — in fact, a priest of [[Cyric]] — had been using Vhok for his own purposes to enter the celestial plane. The [[astral deva]] [[Tauran]] proposed an agreement with Vhok: if Vhok would help him track down Zasian, Vhok would be allowed to bathe in the Lifespring. Vhok agreed but felt betrayed when Tauran placed a ''[[geas]]'' on him and he was forced to accompany Tauran, Aliisza, and Aliisza's son [[Kael]] across the planes. They failed to stop Zasian, and thus Cyric was able to steal [[Azuth]]'s [[Old Staff|staff]] and kill [[Mystra]].

When at last Vhok was released from the ''geas'', he left his companions behind, feeling betrayed that Aliisza had chosen her son and an angel over himself. He joined up with the [[balor]] lord [[Axithar]] and the marilith [[Vhissilka]], providing them information that allowed them to invade the House of the Triad. During the invasion, which was turned away, Vhok attempted to reach the Lifespring but was killed by Aliisza before he could do so.

==Possessions==
Vhok's armor was crimson and gold, with a golden breastplate.

===Magical Items===
* ''[[Burnblood]]'', an ancient elven +2 ''[[Spellblade]]'', granted immunity to [[Cone of Cold]]
* ''[[Ghost gauntlet]]''
* ''[[Scepter Malevolus]]'', a steel rod with black runes, marking him as the leader of the Scoured Legion
* ''[[Ring of protection]]'' +3

Vhok's weapons and magical items were confiscated by the Court of [[Tyr]]. Soon after, in [[Dweomerheart]], he procured a ''[[wand of lightning]]'' (activated by the word "Galvanos"), a cape of [[flying]], and a new sword that had dark energy running through it. He began calling the sword ''[[Spitefang]]''.

==Relationships==
===Aliisza===
[[File:Kaanyr and Aliisza.png|thumb|252x252px|''Vhok and Aliisza together on the Throne of Bone.'']]
Vhok's on-off consort and the chief lieutenant was the [[alu-fiend]] [[Aliisza]], to whom he often entrusted his most important missions of espionage. He was quite close to her, but that didn't stop him from using her for his own ends. He had a soft spot for her and originally wanted to make amends for his betrayal, but when she appeared to choose her son and [[Tauran]] over staying with him, he left bitterly and didn't hesitate to betray her and her companions to a demon horde.

===Scoured Legion===
Vhok's chief tanarukk aid and the lieutenant was named [[Rorgak]]. The [[fey'ri]] [[Lysalis]] was one of his chief sorcerers.
