        "History": "Felodar never loved his country or his family; his only interest was amassing wealth. He departed his realm in the {{YearlinkName|214}}. Soon, he established a base in [[Calimshan]], where he established trade between Athalantar and Calimshan and other lands, which enriched and satisfied his father, King [[Uthgrael Aumar]]. However, Felodar also involved himself in all kinds of criminal dealings.\n\nHe became so powerful in Calimshan that he decided to send his own group of mages, dubbed the [[Night Mages]], to confront the [[magelord]]s who followed his brother [[Belaur Aumar]], but with no success.\n\nFelodar remained a threat to Belaur's rule for much of the time the eldest prince sat on the Stag Throne but at last he was poisoned by a [[Calishite]] rival in late [[239 DR]]."
