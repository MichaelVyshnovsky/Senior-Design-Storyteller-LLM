The '''princess''' of the realm of [[Doegan]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]). tried to free it from its invaders.

==History==
[[File:Howl of Vengeance Intro b.jpg|thumb|left|The princess by the side of her father as he lays dying.]]
Invaders led by [[Rathgar the Raider]] overran Doegan, plundered the realm, and laid siege to the [[Doegan Capital|capital]]. Finally, Rathgar came for the crown itself, and confronted the [[king of Doegan|king]] and princess in their own throne room. However, with his dying breath, the defiant king cursed him, declaring "For so long as you rule, a curse upon you. The dead will arise, to ensure your demise."

Escaping the invaders, the princess of Doegan looked for a way to make her father's prophecy come true. She went to [[Old Stone Keep]] and there met [[Aelric the Avenger|Aelric]], a mage of Doegan who was heir to a great magical legacy. Uninterested in wealth or fame, he vowed to aid her and, furthermore, fulfill her father's curse to take vengeance on those who'd occupied his homeland.

The [[Howl of Vengeance]] conflict was fought between the two factions using [[bloodforge]]s.In the ''[[Blood & Magic]]'' game, two alternate campaigns are provided, one for Aelric and one for Rathgar. These may be mutually exclusive, but it is possible one follows the other or they may be merged as a single back-and-forth conflict. An official history is unknown. The princess's fate is unknown in Rathgar's campaign, and so is not presented here.

When Rathgar's forces pursued the princess to Old Stone Keep, Aelric protected her and struck back against them in a bloodforge battle, favoring crypt-born creatures. Victorious, Aelric scattered Rathgar's own bloodforged forces.

In disarray and dread, Rathgar and his army retreated into the Serpent Valley. The princess and Aelric pursued, exploiting the chaos to once again strike at their foe.

Ultimately, Rathgar's army fled to Doegan's capital with Aelric's horde hot on his heels. They crashed through the city gates and walls and fought the invaders in the streets, with steel and fire and magic. Thus did Aelric the Avenger fulfil the old king's curse and liberate Doegan. The princess became queen, with Aelric at her side, and brought peace to Doegan.
