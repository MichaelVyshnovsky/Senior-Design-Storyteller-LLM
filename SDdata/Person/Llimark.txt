'''Llimark''' was a [[gold dragon]] and a member of the [[Talons of Justice]] during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]].

==History==
In 1373 DR, the gold dragon king [[Lareth]] sent Llimark to detain the [[song dragon]] [[bard]] [[Karasendrieth]] for her rebellious actions in defiance of the dragon conclave's decision on how to deal with the [[Rage of Dragons]]. On the streets of [[Lyrabar]], Llimark intercepted Kara but after a vicious fight she battled and subdued Llimark, despite sustaining heavy injuries.

Llimark also saved [[Azhaq]]'s life when Lareth was about to kill him for being unable to capture Kara.

In the final battle against [[Sammaster]], Llimark became a member of the Talons and along his fellows were sent to attack Sammaster's citadel. He was one of the few Talons who survived the battle.
