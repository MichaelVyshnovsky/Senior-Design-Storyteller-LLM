==Description==
The dexterous and chaotic thief was a worshiper of [[Brandobaris]], the halfling [[deity]] of thievery.

==Personality==
The thief believed that napping adventurers were the best targets for thieving, and would swiftly run to the sewers if caught.

==History==
In [[1357 DR]], Wulve came to the [[City of Splendors]] to ply his trade. However, he also came to steal [[magic]] items and [[gold]]. He planned to head home with his wares and a wagon full of [[turnip]]s.
