Wulve Raikyn (Pronounce|WUL|vuh|_|RAY|in|kin|refs=
The dexterous and chaotic thief was a worshiper of Brandobaris, the halfling deity of thievery.
The thief believed that napping adventurers were the best targets for thieving, and would swiftly run to the sewers if caught.
In 1357 DR, Wulve came to the City of Splendors to ply his trade. However, he also came to steal magic items and gold. He planned to head home with his wares and a wagon full of turnips.
