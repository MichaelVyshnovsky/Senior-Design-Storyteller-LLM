Bosco Daggerhand was the proprietor of the tavern Boscos Bilge in Jahaka Anchorage during the late 15 century DR.
True to his name, Bosco never made an introduction without keeping his free hand upon the dagger that hung from his hip.
Bosco was protected by a partially-domesticated deinonychus called Knuckles. Their relationship was made possible by Boscos ring of animal influence.
