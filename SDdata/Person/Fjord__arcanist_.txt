Fjord was a Netherese arcanist and spell inventor who lived during the Shadowed Age.
Before Fjord developed their first spell, they designed a staff in  that would become know as Fjords Stave of Sentience. This staff caused plants to grow instantly, though if used incorrectly, could cause plants to become sentient. These plants could become mobile, and would attack those who had previously caused them harm. 
Fjord developed three spells during their life. The spells they developed were vacancy in , airy water in , distance distortion in  and finally, animate dead in .
