'''Fjord''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] and [[spell]] inventor who lived during the [[Shadowed Age]].
==History==
Before Fjord developed their first spell, they designed a [[staff]] in {{YearlinkConvert|3301|NY}} that would become know as ''[[Fjord's Stave of Sentience]]''. This staff caused plants to grow instantly, though if used incorrectly, could cause plants to become sentient. These plants could become mobile, and would attack those who had previously caused them harm. 

Fjord developed three spells during their life. The spells they developed were ''[[vacancy]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|3327|NY}}, ''[[airy water]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|3328|NY}}, ''[[distance distortion]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|3340|NY}} and finally, ''[[animate dead]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|3345|NY}}.
