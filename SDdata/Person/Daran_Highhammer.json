        "mainbody": "'''Daran Highhammer''' was a [[dwarven]] exterminator who traveled across [[West Faerûn|western]] [[Faerûn]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He went wherever he could find work, helping folks get rid of troublesome vermin, particularly those that stood on two legs.",
        "Activities": "Daran was used to killing all manner of creatures that were known to cause infestations, such as [[snake]]s, [[ankheg]]s, [[carrion crawler]]s, and on occasion, the [[undead]].",
        "History": "Throughout his life he has traveled the breadth of the [[Sword Coast]] fifteen times, from [[Calimshan]] to the [[Spine of the World]] mountains.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}} Daran was hired by [[Auchlin Deepvein]] to help clear vermin away from his dig site located near the [[Coast Way crossing]]. Unfortunately the expedition dug into the [[Repository of Undeath]] and let loose a horde of undead creatures."
