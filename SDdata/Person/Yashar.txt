Yashar was a male medusa that guarded the Undying Temple during the Silence of Lolth.
He was only 5 ft (1.5 m) tall and sported a supple but tough body.
Yashar was an intensely striking individual, whose presence could draw the eye of even casual observers, albeit to their detriment.
As a medusa, Yashar employed the abilities famed by his kind to petrify those who met his gaze. This ability was augmented by the ring of ethereal sight that he wore, which enabled his petrifying glare to affect even creatures on the ethereal plane.
Yashar had also cultivated fairly potent sorcerous powers, with an emphasis on manipulating force energy, owing to its effectiveness against incorporeal creatures. He could create an impenetrable wall of force or conjure a deadly thunderlance to help him in battle, among many other spells.
Additionally, Yashar was an adroit archer and could fire his arrows accurately even when outnumbered or in close-quarters. If pressed, the numerous snakes that formed his hair could still keep an enemy occupied.
Yashar a wielded a +2 shortbow in battle. He had few possessions besides a set of bracers of armor and a ring of ethereal sight. In his chamber, Yashar liked to collect small petrified animals of the Underdark, such as lizards and rats.
Although he had a small viper as a familiar, Yashar declined to name the creature.
In 1372 DR, during the Silence of Lolth, the high priestess of Kiaransalee in Maerimydra took advantage of the chaos and staged a coup of House Chumavh and took control of Castle Maerimydra. From the Castle, the priestess, Irae Tsarran, summoned forth the Undying Temple to enact her great revenance spell. Yashar was one of the select few allowed inside the temple and was responsible for defending the portal to the ethereal plane that lay within it.
