        "mainbody": "'''Ergrith Klavulgrun''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|276}} to {{yearlink|278}}. After he made the pronouncement that kings should kneel to mages, rather than the other way around, he spent the rest of his tenure in a long battle against a force sponsored by nobles of [[Calimshan]].",
        "Personality": "He was proud, blustering, and cruel.",
        "Abilities": "He was known to shapeshift, and to have at least one spell that transfixed his foes, leaving them in great pain. As soon as he became the Magister, he employed a spell to petrify the arms of a rival, shatter them, and finally let him bleed to death. He crushed another rival's head with a spell of battering ram force, closing a door through his skull.",
        "History": "After accepting the office that [[Azuth]] offered him, Ergrith immediately set out to slay three mages he'd been scrying on, taking their magic for himself. He spent one winter to master it, and then immediately sought more magic come spring. After a [[Tashlutan]] lord forbade him from slaying a court mage, Ergrith sought to terrorize noblemen into kneeling before mages, slaying more than a dozen lords of independent cities in the [[Vilhon Reach]] and in [[Tashalar]], earning himself the nickname. [[Calishite]] rulers sponsored a force of [[wyvern]]-riding mages armed with as much magic as could be scrounged to take him on. Ergrith slew most of them in a month-long chase involving shapechanging and ambushes.\n\nAt one point, he transformed into a tombstone at a private mausoleum in [[Tashluta]], from where he led twelve of his pursuers on a chase north across the lands bordering the [[Sword Coast]]. The pursuers attacked a [[black dragon]] whom they took to be him in disguise; he transformed himself to pretend to be amongst their dead, as they destroyed the wyrm. Afterwards, he got each of them alone and slew them, the last one near [[Neverwinter]]. He taunted and executed that last foe with such cruelty that a nearby [[Adriyana Voudsarr]] took her own shape again and challenged him to a duel.\n\nHer attack was furious, and the spells left to him, few. When she turned one of his slaying spells back upon him, he died."
