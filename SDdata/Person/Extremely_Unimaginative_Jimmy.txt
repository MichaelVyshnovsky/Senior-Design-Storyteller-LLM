'''Extremely Unimaginative Jimmy''' was a geographer and interior decorator who lived ages before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Allegedly, Extremely Unimaginative Jimmy gained his name for his unimaginative naming convention. He was credited for giving name to "waterfalls" and "fireplaces." An [[enchanted]] item called the ''[[shield of shielding]]'' was described as named in Jimmy's style.
