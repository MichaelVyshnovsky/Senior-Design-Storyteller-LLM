Extremely Unimaginative Jimmy was a geographer and interior decorator who lived ages before the late 15 century DR.
Allegedly, Extremely Unimaginative Jimmy gained his name for his unimaginative naming convention. He was credited for giving name to "waterfalls" and "fireplaces." An enchanted item called the shield of shielding was described as named in Jimmys style.
