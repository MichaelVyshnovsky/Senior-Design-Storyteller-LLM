        "mainbody": "'''Ithil Sprandorn''' was the Lord Mage of [[Saskar]] ''circa'' [[1065 DR]].",
        "History": "Lord Mage Sprandorn disliked those wizards who cruelly used ''[[the Art]]'' to lord over those not gifted with magic. In the {{YearlinkName|1065}}, Ithil has already achieved the status of the ruler. At one point during the year, he took prisoner a brash young mageling [[Thorstel]] who attempted to intimidate common peasants with ''[[fireball]]''. The Lord Mage gave the man a famous speech of how no wizard could beat death, and mortality was one thing common fold had with even the most powerful weavers of the arcane. Even those who decide to become [[lich]]s did not cheat death as living death was still just that â€“ death."
