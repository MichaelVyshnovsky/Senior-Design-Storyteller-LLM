        "mainbody": "'''Scott Harikon''' was a commander of the guards of [[Arabel]] in [[1369 DR]] who would escort merchant caravans north into [[Shadowdale]] to help ensure their safety. He was a weary, but friendly man whose experiences aged him beyond his actual years.\n\nSome time in 1369 DR, he injured his arm after an ambush by [[kobold]]s. The trauma was extensive enough to have it cradled by a sling and wrapped in bandages.",
        "Appearance": "Scott looked old for his age, which wasn't helped by the gray streaks in his red beard.",
        "Equipment": "Commander Harikon wore [[plate mail]] and carried a +1 [[longsword]].",
