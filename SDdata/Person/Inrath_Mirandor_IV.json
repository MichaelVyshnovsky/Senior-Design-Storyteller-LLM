        "mainbody": "'''Inrath Mirandor IV''' was the 15{{th}} king of the [[Mirandor Dynasty]] of [[Impiltur]]. His reign was short-lived, lasting only two years during the midâ€“2{{nd}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Inrath IV was significantly affected by the plague that claimed the life of his mother. This was possibly connected to his nickname of '''Inrath \"Lackcrown\"'''.",
        "Relationships": "He was the eldest son of [[Inrath Mirandor III]]. Inrath IV had two younger brothers, [[Pendarn Mirandor|Pendarn]] and [[Doraven Mirandor|Doraven]], the latter of whom was born to a different mother.",
        "History": "Inrath IV ruled over Impiltur for a mere two years before he was forcefully deposed by Doraven in the {{YearlinkName|159}}. While he managed to flee the royal city of [[Lyrabar]], he was eventually hunted down and killed by his stepbrother."
