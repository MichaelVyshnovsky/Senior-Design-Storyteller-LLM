        "mainbody": "'''Lender Daija''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Waukeen]] who supervised the creation of her goddess's shrine in the [[Crossroad Keep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Tantam! May your day be profitable, friend. I am Daija, cleric of Waukeen,''|Lender Daija}}",
        "Description": "Daija was a [[half-elven]] woman with a cheerful demeanor, dressed in the finest quality clothes.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Lender Daija was tasked with heading a shrine of Waukeen, the Merchant's Friend in the mercantile fortress of the Crossroad Keep. However, the city of [[Neverwinter]] was still recovering from the [[Shadow War]] and failed to provide the [[Church of Waukeen]] with promised funds. Soon after the merchant princess [[Sa'Sani]] and her [[Mercantile House]] were put in charge of the Keep, Lender Daija approached the merchant's partners, but not for a donation of funds. Lender Daija believed the tenant of her church â€“ that a deal had to be upheld by the party who initiated the deal. Until the Crossroad Keep or Neverwinter fulfilled the agreement, she stayed at the [[Phoenix Tail Inn]] of the Keep, offering to heal those who required it."
