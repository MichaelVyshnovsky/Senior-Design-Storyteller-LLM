'''Larn''' was a [[Chauntean]] [[priest]] and winemaker who restored the [[Morden Winery]] outside the village of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
When Larn was turned to stone, he was still a young man.

==History==
When the war against the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]] swept [[Faerûn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, the couple who ran the Morden Winery in the Vast disappeared, presumably by the locals, taken and killed by [[Tuigan]]s. A year later, a young priest of Earth Mother came across the abandoned winery, restoring it and resuming [[wine]] production. During that time, he befriended a duo of ancient fun-loving [[satyr]]s, [[Quellonis]] and [[Harmon (satyr)|Harmon]], who were regular guests of Larn's, tasting new wines, singing songs, and playing music late into the night.

Soon after, the [[medusa]] [[mage]] named [[Samanthiss]] and her consort – [[maedar]] [[Vorlon]], found the winery and decided to take over. Larn was [[petrified]] by the medusa, while Vorlon assumed the assumed identity of the vintner. The couple continued operating the winery for the following decade. Vorlon showed remorse over Larn's fate but came to love winemaking. Larn's stone body was kept in good condition if the medusas ever needed food.

The winery's rightful owner, [[Shauna Morden]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] discovered its existence after her father's death ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}} and hired a group of capable adventurers of the Living City to investigate the winery's condition and establish a dialogue and partnership with its managers if there were any. Subsequently, the Morden Winery was returned to the Morden family, and, by some accounts, the maedar vintner was allowed to run the business; by others, the medusas were slain. Larn was believed to had been released from the decade of being petrified, either with some help from outside forces or as a sign of good will from Vorlon. Were lard given freedom, he was ready to reward his saviors with his [[enchanted]] ''[[medallion of proof]]'' – a precious trinket that changed its appearance depending on its owner's faith or divine patronage.{{Cite organized play/LC/Before Its Time|23-24}}
