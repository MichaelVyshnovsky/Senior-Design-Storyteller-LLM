She also recorded the takings and the cost of damages in the account book.\nSunfirth was working at the Bold Bard on Eleint 16 in the , and was left to clean up after a brawl between Rolf and Dovo, and probably when Dovo spat on the floor later. The next night it was Rolf and Jasper, and then she tried to chase and whack the mice Jasper secretly released as a ruse while he stole the account book. The night after, while obsessing on a murder case in his confused dreams, Jasper briefly theorized that an axe-wielding Sunfirth beheaded Dovo for the mess and Grodoveth for not tipping. Which, while unlikely, didnt seem unreasonable given what she put up with.\nSunfirth stood around  tall and weighed about , suggesting she was not in fact an axe-murderer."
