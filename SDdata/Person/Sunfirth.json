        "mainbody": "'''Sunfirth''' was a barmaid at the [[Bold Bard]] tavern in the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Working for [[Shortshanks]], Sunfirth delivered drinks and food and cleaned up the same after the brawls that broke out between patrons. She also recorded the takings and the cost of damages in the account book.",
        "History": "Sunfirth was working at the Bold Bard on [[Eleint 16]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, and was left to clean up after a brawl between [[Rolf (roofer)|Rolf]] and [[Dovo]], and probably when Dovo spat on the floor later. The [[Eleint 17|next night]] it was Rolf and [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]], and then she tried to chase and whack the [[mice]] Jasper secretly released as a ruse while he stole the account book. The [[Eleint 18|night after]], while obsessing on a murder case in his confused dreams, Jasper briefly theorized that an axe-wielding Sunfirth beheaded Dovo for the mess and [[Grodoveth]] for not tipping. Which, while unlikely, didn't seem unreasonable given what she put up with.",
        "Description": "Sunfirth stood around {{SI|5'2\"|ft-in|long=yes}} tall and weighed about {{SI|110|lb|k|long=yes}}, suggesting she was not in fact an axe-murderer."
