Farideh () was a warlock who accidentally made a pact with the cambion Lorcan.  She was the adopted daughter of a dragonborn warrior named Mehen and the twin sister of Havilar.
Farideh was tall and thin and had one golden and one silver eye.
Farideh had a love–hate relationship with her master Lorcan. She wanted to get out of the pact that she never really wanted in the first place but was unwilling to take the necessary steps. She had at least one occasion to kill Lorcan, which would have ended the pact but she chose not to. She loved her sister and adopted father although she frequently argued with both.
The Open Lord of Waterdeep, Laeral Silverhand, once gifted Farideh with two personalized items the sickle of shorn bonds and the seal of forbidding. During her time adventuring in the service of the Open Lord, Farideh was armed with several powerful enchanted weapons, such as a rod of the pact keeper, the fiendish moon, an infernal cane, and the fiendish brand. She also possessed potent magic items such as dragon cult cubes, a belt of the witch, a devils clasp, an amulet of illusions, the wreath of flame, and a pair of unique boots made by her sister called the Foundation of Flame. Farideh also carried several grimoires, including a Book of Shadows which her patron used to enumerate the costs of some of her powers, specifically necromantic ones.
In the , Havilar was attempting to summon an imp when she accidentally summoned a cambion named Lorcan. But he was more interested in making Farideh a warlock rather than her sister because Havilar had more of a warriors personality. Unbeknownst to Farideh, she was descended from Bryseis Kakistos, one of the Toril thirteen, the original thirteen tiefling warlocks who made pacts with Asmodeus. Lorcan was a collector of warlocks and Farideh completed his set of descendants of all thirteen.
The summoning resulted in a fire that burned down the familys barn and attracted the attention of the village. When the villagers learned what had happened, they exiled Farideh, Havilar, and Mehen. Thereafter, the three were forced to work as bounty hunters to scratch out a living. While on the road, Lorcan would occasionally show up and teach Farideh a new spell and give advice, but Mehen was so hostile to the cambion that Lorcan began appearing to Farideh only when she was by herself.

In the , the trio was on the Sword Coast in hot pursuit of Constancia Crownsilver, a knight of Torm, who was wanted by the temple of Torm in Cormyr for dereliction of duty. They chanced upon a caravan under attack by orcs and helped defend the caravan. The twins befriended Brin, a young runaway acolyte of Torm, who was on the run from the priestess that was the trios quarry. Brin convinced Mehen and the twins to travel with him to Neverwinter, where he would present himself to the Tormites in the hope that they would get word to the priestess that he was in Neverwinter. The trio hoped to capture the priestess if she showed up.
While in Neverwinter, Mehen and the twins became entangled in a plot by the archdevil Glasya to trick Asmodeus into entering into hostilities with the Abolethic Sovereignty. They rescued Mehen from Rohini, one of Glasyas succubus agents who later became plaguechanged and joined forces with the Sovereignty, and caused enough trouble that Glasya abandoned her plan.
Later in 1478 DR, Mehan, Farideh, and Havilar returned their bounty Constancia to Suzail through the Waterdeep portal. Due to a lack of funds, only Mehen and Constancia were able to make the journey through the portal while Farideh and Havilar remained behind in Waterdeep. With nothing better to do, Farideh tagged along with Tam Zawad, who was investigating a magical page from an ancient Netherese book. Farideh was invited to a party at the mansion of the caravan master Adolican Rhand, who purchased the page and she and Tams Harper partner Dahl stole the page.
Tams daughter Mira was able to locate the origin of the page, the lost Library of Tarchamus, and Farideh, Havilar, Tam, Brin, Dahl, Mira, and two Zhents journeyed to the library where they recovered the magical tome, the Book of Tarchamus, from which the page was ripped. In the process, they destroyed Tarchamus the Unyieldings mummy and his library by Farideh casting Tarchamus volcano.
After a deal with Lorcans sister Sairché, which resulted in them being held in magical stasis on Malbolge for seven and a half years, Farideh and Havilar were sent back to Toril in the . To keep her part of the deal, Farideh had to go to one of six Netherese internment camps that were run by Adolican Rhand. The camp Farideh went to was located in the Lost Peaks. With a newly gained ability, Farideh had to single out the captured Chosen from the common prisoners. This ability was part of the new powers Asmodeus had given to her as one of his Chosen. Although Netherils plan was to gather the divine sparks of the Chosen and transfer them to Shar, Asmodeuss plan, as a matter of course, was to capture the sparks for himself. Unfortunately for him, Glasya and Levistus tried to hamper this aim. Magros, the agent of Levistus, allied himself with Thay in order to transfer the sparks to Szass Tam. During her confinement, Farideh also met, but didnt recognize, the ghost of Bryseis Kakistos. Finally, Farideh, Dahl (who had traveled with Farideh by accident), Lorcan, and some of the captives managed to rescue the prisoners with the help of the timely arrival of Havilar, Brin, Mehen, and other Harpers before the camp was destroyed by Thayan forces.
