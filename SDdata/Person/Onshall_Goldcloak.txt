'''Onshall Goldcloak''' was a wicked [[wizard]] apprentice who inhabited the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the 1350's [[DR]].

==History==
Onshall was apprenticed to a particularly vile [[mage]] named [[Melinter]]. He would meet his master, along with other apprentices and members of their gang, in a small courtyard in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]]. The courtyard would later become known as [[Melinter's Court]] because of these meetings.
