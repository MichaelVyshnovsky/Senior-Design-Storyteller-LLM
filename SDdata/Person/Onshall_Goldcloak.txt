Onshall Goldcloak was a wicked wizard apprentice who inhabited the city of Waterdeep during the 1350s DR.
Onshall was apprenticed to a particularly vile mage named Melinter. He would meet his master, along with other apprentices and members of their gang, in a small courtyard in Waterdeeps Dock Ward. The courtyard would later become known as Melinters Court because of these meetings.
