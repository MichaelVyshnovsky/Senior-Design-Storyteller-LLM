        "mainbody": "'''Synthalus''' was an adventuring [[thief]] active in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Possessions": "As a [[rogue]], Synthalus wore a set of [[enchanted]] ''+2'' [[leather armor|leathers]] and a pair of ''[[boots of striding and springing]]''. He was armed with a ''[[scimitar of speed]].''",
        "History": "Synthalus was known to be a brash and cocky adventurer who was overconfident and bashful. His attitude led to a negligent failure at trap disarming that cost his sister her hand and took the lives of several adventuring companions. The disaster humbled Synthalus, but he continued to look for employment with adventuring parties to little success as many were not willing to trust him."
