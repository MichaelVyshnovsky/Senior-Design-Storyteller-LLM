Shambarin, also known as the Shadowcloak, and formerly Keltie "Silkhips" Silmar, was a mage who lived in Berdusk.
She often appeared as a bearded recluse of a man. The disguise helped her hide from old enemies from Amn who were victims of her many thefts.
In her youth, Shambarin spent her time stealing gems, gold, perfumes, and silks from caravans travelling through Amn. Back then she was known as the thief Keltie "Silkhips" Silmar.
