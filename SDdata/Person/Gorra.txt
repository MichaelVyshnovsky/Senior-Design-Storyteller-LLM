Gorra, who was also known as Withers, was an undead wight that acted as an overseer in the Tomb of the Nine Gods.
When he was alive, Withers was an Omuan engineer named Gorra, but when Acererak enslaved the city, he was put to work constructing the tomb and its various traps.
When the tomb was complete, Gorras traps proved to have worked the best, and Acererak rewarded him by transforming him into a wight, and letting him oversee the tomb.
Withers kept a manual of clay golems and owned a spellbook as befitted a wizard. 
He also kept a control gem for a gray slaad that was kept in the tomb, and had a skeletal songbird in a cage in his office, presumably as a pet.
