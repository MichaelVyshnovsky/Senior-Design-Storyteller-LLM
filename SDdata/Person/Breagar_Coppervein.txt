Breagar set up a simple shop of sorts in the ruins of [[Beckside Castle]] on the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]] around the time of the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]]. He offered useful supplies to choice-starved [[adventurer]]s, such as [[weapon]]s, [[armor]], ''[[Potion of healing|potions of healing]]'' and ''[[Potion of restoration|restoration]]'', ''[[oil of repair]]'', and [[torch]]es.
