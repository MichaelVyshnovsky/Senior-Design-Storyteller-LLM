        "mainbody": "'''Amie Fern''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]] of the village of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{Quote|I've got the plates cleaning themselves now, but the broom keeps giving me trouble.|Amie}}",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Amie_Fern_appearance.jpg|thumb|''Amie's appearance.'']]\nAmie was a long-time friend of the one known as the [[Kalach-Cha]], and both had been orphaned during the battle with the King of Shadows. Amie preferred to spend time with the Kalach-Cha and Bevil Starling, even considering them to be more of a family than [[Tarmas]].",
        "Personality": "Intelligent and pretty, Amie spent much of her time reading in Tarmas's library, and thus typically avoided the attentions of other boys in the village. When Tarmas was attacked, she rushed to protect him, proving her loyalty to him.",
        "History": "Amie's parents were not originally from West Harbor but, nonetheless, they remained to defend the village during the battle with the [[King of Shadows]]. Unfortunately, they were killed in the battle that nearly destroyed West Harbor and Amie was orphaned. Afterward, the wizard Tarmas raised Amie and tutored her in the use of [[magic]], adopting her as his apprentice. According to Tarmas, Amie had strong magic within her blood, and he believed she might be of [[Luskan]] descent.\n\nShe had expressed interest in leaving West Harbor once she finished up her apprenticeship and traveling the Realms while recording all she saw.\n\n[[File:Amie vs. Githyanki.jpg|thumb|''Amie's casts her last spell.'']]\nUnfortunately, Amie was killed by a [[githyanki]] mage, [[Zeearie]], during the attack on West Harbor in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, after she tried to aid Tarmas against her.\n\nWhen the Kalach-Cha later went to reclaim their last soul, Amie appeared in Kalach-Cha's dream land as an illusion."
