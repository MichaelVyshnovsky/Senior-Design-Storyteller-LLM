'''Shammagar''' was a [[black dragon]] who lived on an island in the [[Trackless Sea]].

==History==
During the [[Rage of Dragons]] of {{Yearlink|1018}}, Shammagar and the [[green dragon]] [[Claugiyliamatar]] attacked the [[orc]]s of [[Uruth Ukrypt]], targeting the horde's food supplies and amassed treasure. Shammagar himself drove the orcs out of the ancient [[dwarf|dwarven]] stronghold of [[Melairrin]] beneath [[Mount Sar]] in the [[Sword Mountains]] range.

Several centuries later, the [[half-elf|half-elven]] [[Harpers|Harper]] [[Asilther Graelor]] managed to infiltrate Shammagar's lair beneath Mount Sar and abscond with most of his hoard. Shammagar was outraged and immediately abandoned Melairrin for a new island lair in the Trackless Sea.{{Cite dragon/187/The Lonely Harpist and the Lady Rogue|51}}

==Rumors & Legends==
The [[frost giant]] [[adventurer]] [[Harshnag|Harshnag the Grim]], who came to reside in the stronghold of Melairrin long after Shammagar had quit the place, reported encountering [[half-dragon|half&ndash;black dragons]] of orcish ancestry in the depths below&mdash;possibly the progeny of Shammagar himself.
