'''Uluene Maertalar''' was the high priestess of the [[Church of Milil]] in [[Berdusk]], in [[1367 DR]].

==Description==
Uluene was a short woman of serene beauty, with dark hair and dark eyes. She controlled her facial expressions as well as professional card players. 

==Abilities==
Uluene was a skilled actress and singer, which could be attributed to her hard work and vigor rather than any innate talent.

As a skilled [[cleric]] she was always ready with several battle-[[spell]]s, which she used to solve problems during parties organized in [[Evensong Tower]].

==Activities==
As the leader of the [[Evensong Tower]] temple, Uluene increased its power and influence by organizing entertaining parties for the wealthy people of the city. She took full advantage of the growing community of [[bard]]s from [[Twilight Hall]] to provide her guests with poetry, ballads, music and other amusement.

==Rumors & Legends==
Uluene was known to be looking for a skilled [[bard]] to take as a husband. She longed for adventures rather than a life spent in the unchanging comfort of her temple.
