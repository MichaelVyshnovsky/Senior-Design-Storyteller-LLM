Vartilingorix was a black dragon that made its home in the Silverwisp Swamp on the Sword Coast North during the late 15 century DR.
He enjoyed life of solitude and preferred to count the dead of Ebon Downs as company over any living beings.
Vartilingorix did allow local farmers to bring offerings to his swamp. On occasion he would delight in torturing one or two of them.

In the 1480s DR, he became one of many dragons recruited by the Cult of the Dragon during their campaign to draw their goddess Tiamat to the Realms. When he appeared in the Valley of the Ancients in the swamp, Vartilingorix was slain by a collective of adventurers working with Acolyte Heiron of the Order of the Gauntlet. 
The black dragons remains lay embedded into the muddy ground of the valley, and no natural creature would scavenge from it. One year after his death, agents of the Cult of the Dragon returned to the site of his death to recover the dragons essence.
