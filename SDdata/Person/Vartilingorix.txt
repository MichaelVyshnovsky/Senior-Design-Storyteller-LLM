'''Vartilingorix''' was a [[black dragon]] that made its home in the [[Silverwisp Swamp]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He enjoyed life of solitude and preferred to count the dead of [[Ebon Downs]] as company over any living beings.

==Activities==
Vartilingorix did allow local farmers to bring offerings to his swamp. On occasion he would delight in torturing one or two of them.

==History==
[[File:Black dragon bone.png|thumb|right|300px|Vartiligorix's bones in the [[Valley of the Ancients]].]]
In the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} he became one of many dragons recruited by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] during their campaign to draw their goddess [[Tiamat]] to the Realms. When he appeared in the [[Valley of the Ancients]] in the swamp, Vartilingorix was slain by a collective of adventurers working with Acolyte [[Heiron]] of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]]. 

The black' dragon's remains lay embedded into the muddy ground of the valley, and no natural creature would scavenge from it. One year after his death, agents of the Cult of the Dragon returned to the site of his death to recover the dragon's essence.
