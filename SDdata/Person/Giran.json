Unfortunately, the circus' tent fell victim to a mad [[gnome]] [[illusionist]] [[Kalah]], who transformed the tent's interior into a fanciful tower filled with guests and performers, ensorcelled to appear as monsters. Giran's mother was trapped inside, transformed into a [[giant spider]]. The child was left outside of the spellbound tent, crying for his missing mother. When the illusion was broken and the gnome defeated, Giran was reunited with Hannah."
