Sandyrina the Sensual was a dancer and fence in Tilverton in the 14 century DR.
Sandyrina was beautiful and often went scantily dressed as part of her work as a dancer.
She was a fair dealer and kept her clients secrets well.
She was protected by the pseudodragons Tannath and Slip, who she found abandoned as babies and raised herself, gaining devotedly loyal companions.
Around 1358 DR, Sandyrina was a dancer at the Winking Moon tavern, but her true vocation was as a fence. She pretended to be a prostitute and met traveling merchants and adventurers in their inn lodgings, taking stolen and dangerous goods off their hands.
