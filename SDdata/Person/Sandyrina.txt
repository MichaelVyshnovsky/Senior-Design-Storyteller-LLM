'''Sandyrina the Sensual''' was a dancer and fence in [[Tilverton]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Sandyrina was beautiful and often went scantily dressed as part of her work as a dancer.

==Personality==
She was a fair dealer and kept her client's secrets well.

==Relationships==
She was protected by the [[pseudodragon]]s Tannath and Slip, who she found abandoned as babies and raised herself, gaining devotedly loyal companions.

==Activities==
Around [[1358 DR]], Sandyrina was a dancer at the [[Winking Moon]] tavern, but her true vocation was as a fence. She pretended to be a [[prostitute]] and met traveling merchants and [[adventurer]]s in their inn lodgings, taking stolen and dangerous goods off their hands.
