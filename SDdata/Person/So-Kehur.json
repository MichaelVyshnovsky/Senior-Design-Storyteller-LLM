        "mainbody": "o-Kehur was a Red Wizard necromancer and follower of the lich Szass Tam in the late 14 century DR.\nSo-Kehur was quite corpulent for a Mulan. He kept a magical, ebony-and-bone wand dangling from his belt. He was often accompanied by his fellow necromancer Muthoth.\nSo-Kehurs sister was Nephis Sepret, wife of Ramas Ankhalab, autharch of Anhaurz in Lapendrar.\nSo-Kehur never wanted to become a necromancer or any kind of wizard but his family pushed him into it. So-Kehur would have been content to stay home and manage his familys estates. \nBoth So-Kehur and Muthoth played a key role during the battle at the Keep of Sorrows by killing the enemy warriors, and raising them as undead to increase the size of Szass Tams forces. So-Kehur was mind-bound to the powerful lich, which ensured that he would follow every order given to him upon pain of death."
