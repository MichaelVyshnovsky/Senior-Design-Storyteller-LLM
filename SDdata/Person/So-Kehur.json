        "mainbody": "'''So-Kehur''' was a [[Red Wizard]] [[necromancer]] and follower of the [[lich]] [[Szass Tam]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "So-Kehur was quite corpulent for a [[Mulan]]. He kept a [[magic]]al, [[ebony]]-and-bone ''[[wand]]'' dangling from his belt. He was often accompanied by his fellow necromancer [[Muthoth]].",
        "Relationships": "So-Kehur's sister was [[Nephis Sepret]], wife of [[Ramas Ankhalab]], [[autharch]] of [[Anhaurz]] in [[Lapendrar]].",
        "History": "So-Kehur never wanted to become a [[necromancer]] or any kind of [[wizard]] but his family pushed him into it. So-Kehur would have been content to stay home and manage his family's estates. \n\nBoth So-Kehur and Muthoth played a key role during the battle at the [[Keep of Sorrows]] by killing the enemy warriors, and raising them as [[undead]] to increase the size of Szass Tam's forces. So-Kehur was mind-bound to the powerful [[lich]], which ensured that he would follow every order given to him upon pain of death."
