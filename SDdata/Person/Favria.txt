'''Favria''' was an [[assassin]] and the leader of an [[Ashmadai]] cult in [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Favria had many scars—notably in her face—from the time she was a slave.

==Personality==
Favria was a no-nonsense, cruel and pragmatic person. She liked more a direct approach, and so she was the total opposite to [[Mordai Vell]]. She was wise enough to see the value of manipulation, however.

==History==
Favria born as a slave of a [[duergar]] clan that followed [[Asmodeus]]. She escaped when she reached adulthood, but remained fascinated by the [[devil]] [[god]].

She went to Neverwinter as part of a search for [[Gauntlgrym]]. Here Favria joined the Ashmadai but continued her search for the lost dwarven city, that she intended to conquer in the name of her infernal master. She loyally followed [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] because of her assumed possession of the ''[[Ruby Rod of Asmodeus]]''.

Favria usually resided in the ruined village of [[Thundertree]], knowing she was too well known in Neverwinter.
