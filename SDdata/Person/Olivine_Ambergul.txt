'''Olivine Ambergul''' was a [[Netherese]] [[medusa]] residing near [[Daggerford]] around [[1480 DR]].
  
==Activities==
Olivine, totally insane, resided in a special section of her family's crypt crafted for her by her father. She was protected by [[Malgast]], a [[flesh golem]] created from the remains of her brothers [[Kamal Ambergul|Kamal]] and [[Gaston Ambergul|Gaston]] (as well as a few other nameless donors). The golem was totally under Olivine's command

==History==
Olivine was the daughter of Lord [[Reynard Ambergul]], a Netherese noble who'd become rich robbing tombs and just for fun gathering a small cult to the [[Elemental Evil|Elemental Princes of Evil]], collecting also some powerful [[scroll]]s and [[artifact]]s.

After poisoning three husbands in five years in order to gain their money, a [[curse]] struck Olivine, transforming her into a medusa. She spent all her fortune and time searching for a cure. At last, her father took pity on her and permitted her to live inside the family crypt where Reynard's grave robbers also put the remains of her dead husbands.
