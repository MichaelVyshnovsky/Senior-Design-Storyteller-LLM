'''Borri mac Rogni''' was a [[dwarf]] [[priest]] of [[Moradin]] in the [[Moonsea]].

==Activities==
Borri was a priest and a member of the [[Hammer of Moradin]] in [[Earthfast]].

==Possessions==
In battle, Borri dressed in a [[chain shirt]] and fought with a [[mace]].

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], after [[Furgis Boltsmelter]] stole the [[elemental codex]] from Earthfast, Borri was chosen to be part of a Hammer squad led by [[Kalda Purefist]] to pursue him and retake the item. Near [[Mulmaster]], Kalda, Borri and the squad confronted Furgis and his adventuring party bodyguards when the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] attacked both groups. In the battle against the earth cultists, Kalda and most of her men died but Borri and the warrior [[Sunni mac Grunna]] survived. Borri made an agreement with Furgis and/or his adventuring party bodyguards and continued the journey with them.

At last, after [[Murssvayas Dhuurniv]] copied the codex, Borri and Sunni took it back to Earthfast.
