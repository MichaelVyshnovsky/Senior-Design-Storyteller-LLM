Yin-kung To was the cell leader of the Royal Vagabonds in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
At the celebration of the birth of Goshukara Sadamotos third son, the Gorath disguised himself as Yin-king To to impress Lui-hsia Chih. After the party, Lui sent Nan-kuo and Yencheng Tzu Yu to read the aura of the real Yin-kung To, finding nothing strange. That night, Yin-kung and the Gorath led an attack on the Many-Hued Peacock Societys headquarters in Nakamaru.
Yin-kung To posed as a foreign merchant in the city, having all the mannerisms of a man not able to live outside of his country, always wearing Shou dress and speaking with a strong accent, but this was only a cover for his true work as a Royal Vagabond.
He led the ten-member cell in Nakamaru but received direct orders from the Gorath.
Yin-kung To prided himself on how he had resisted the "barbaric" ways of Wa.
