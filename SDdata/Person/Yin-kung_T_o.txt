'''Yin-kung T'o''' was the cell leader of the [[Royal Vagabonds]] in [[Nakamaru]] around [[1357 DR]].

==History==
At the celebration of the birth of [[Goshukara Sadamoto]]'s third son, the [[Gorath]] disguised himself as Yin-king T'o to impress [[Lui-hsia Chih]]. After the party, Lui sent [[Nan-kuo]] and [[Yench'eng Tzu Yu]] to read the aura of the real Yin-kung T'o, finding nothing strange. That night, Yin-kung and the Gorath led an attack on the [[Many-Hued Peacock Society]]'s headquarters in Nakamaru.

==Activities==
Yin-kung T'o posed as a foreign merchant in the city, having all the mannerisms of a man not able to live outside of his country, always wearing Shou dress and speaking with a strong accent, but this was only a cover for his true work as a Royal Vagabond.

He led the ten-member cell in Nakamaru but received direct orders from the [[Gorath]].

==Personality==
Yin-kung T'o prided himself on how he had resisted the "barbaric" ways of [[Wa]].
