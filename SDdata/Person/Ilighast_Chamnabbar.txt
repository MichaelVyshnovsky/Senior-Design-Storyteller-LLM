'''Ilighast Chamnabbar''' was an [[Illuskan]] [[sage]] and [[wizard]] inhabiting [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was a short man with a bitter attitude.

==Activities==
Ilighast was well-studied with regards to [[magic]] in general, the [[planes of existence]]—specifically the [[Astral Plane|Astral]], [[Ethereal plane|Ethereal]], and [[Elemental planes]]—and the history of [[demihuman]]s along the [[Sword Coast]] and [[northwest Faerûn]].

He was a member of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]]. When he wasn't conducting research within the [[Font of Knowledge]], Ilighast spent much of his time at the [[Tower of the Order]] hoping to gleem some useful information.
