        "mainbody": "Abdirak was a priest of Loviatar, the goddess of pain, in the Sword Coast region of the Western Heartlands in the late 15 century DR.\nAbdirak was a human man with fair skin, gray eyes, and silver hair fashioned into a short undercut. His body was riddled with numerous scars, almost certainly a result of his sadomasochistic activities as a worshiper of Loviatar. He could be seen wearing a short, black, high-collared capelet. The garment draped threads across his chest in the shape of the holy symbol of Loviatar a barbed, nine-stranded whip.\nAbdirak deeply enjoyed pain, both to suffer it and to inflict it. However, his sadomasochism was an act of worship to Loviatar and he did not apply it recklessly. In his words \"Pain without purpose is a terrible thing.\"\nIn the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR, Abdirak was invited by the cult of the Absolute to assist in torturing the prisoner Liam for information. He claimed that he was \"thrilled\" to accept. In the goblin camp at the Shattered Sanctum, he worked with the torturer Spike under the leadership of the drow True Soul Minthara Baenre. However, he found the goblins to be poor students of his craft, describing their methods as \"crude and primitive.\""
