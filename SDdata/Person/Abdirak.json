        "mainbody": "'''Abdirak''' was a priest of [[Loviatar]], the goddess of pain, in the [[Sword Coast]] region of the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Abdirak was a [[human]] man with fair skin, gray eyes, and silver hair fashioned into a short undercut. His body was riddled with numerous scars, almost certainly a result of his sadomasochistic activities as a worshiper of [[Loviatar]]. He could be seen wearing a short, black, high-collared capelet. The garment draped threads across his chest in the shape of the holy symbol of Loviatar: a barbed, nine-stranded whip.",
        "Personality": "Abdirak deeply enjoyed pain, both to suffer it and to inflict it. However, his sadomasochism was an act of worship to [[Loviatar]] and he did not apply it recklessly. In his words: \"Pain without purpose is a terrible thing.\"",
        "History": "In the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], Abdirak was invited by the [[cult of the Absolute]] to assist in torturing the prisoner [[Liam]] for information. He claimed that he was \"thrilled\" to accept. In the [[goblin]] camp at the [[Shattered Sanctum]], he worked with the torturer [[Spike (goblin)|Spike]] under the leadership of the [[drow]] [[True Soul]] [[Minthara Baenre]]. However, he found the goblins to be poor students of his craft, describing their methods as \"crude and primitive.\""
