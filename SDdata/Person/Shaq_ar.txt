'''Shaq'ar''' was the leader of the [[Golden Mane]] [[wemic]] pride, which migrated across the plains of [[the Shaar]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/Wemic Camp|2}}

==Description==
The alpha wemic Shaq'ar had golden fur, which was regularly interrupted by noticeable battle scars, and a glorious, dark red mane streaked with gold.

He was smarter than most of his kind and strove to be a fair and authoritative leader of his kin.

==Relationships==
Shaq'ar was entirely in love with his favored mate [[Wrokeen]], the pride's head scout and hunter.{{Cite web enhancement/Wemic Camp|4}}

==Possessions==
Among Shaq'ar's possessions was a covering of a ''+2 [[hide armor]]'', above which he wore an elaborate decorative pectoral made of [[gold]] and [[blue dragon]] teeth, taken from a wyrm that he slayed during his adventuring days. In battle, he had a pair of ''[[gloves of dexterity]]'' and wielded an [[item enchantment|enchanted]] ''[[greatclub]]''. Although his strength and skill had long since surpassed its justifiable use, Shaq'ar kept the ''[[composite bow]]'' he used to hunt in his youth.

==History==
In his youth, Shaq'ar traveled with a band of adventurers. During one of their journeys, they encountered and managed to slay a blue dragon, from which Shaq'ar took its teeth as a trophy.

Prior to Shaq'ar, the leadership of the Golden Mane was under the lead of his uncle. When the elder wemic became too aged to lead, Shaq'ar challenged him to single combat and justly won leadership of the pride.

When the dark and sullen wemic [[Beren]] was younger, Shaq'ar was insightful enough to see that he posed a threat to the pride as a whole. He encouraged the scrawny and misguided youth to seek out the adventuring life away from the pride. Upon Beren's return, Shar'ar watched him quite fiercely, having concern about his suspicious activities.
