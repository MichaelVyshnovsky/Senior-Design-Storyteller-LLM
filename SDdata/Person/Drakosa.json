        "mainbody": "'''Drakosa''', also known by the full name '''Drakosa yn Sallah yi Manshaka''', was a petty [[Calishite]] noble who traveled to [[Maztica]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], becoming the sole Calishite landholder of the [[New Amn]]ian colonies during that time.",
        "Description": "Drakosa had a rather rotund body.",
        "Personality": "Business was a defining aspect of Drakosa's personality. He was quite crafty in financial matters, but also rather greedy and self-serving.  When it came to his plantation's [[slavery|slaves]], Drakosa was a relatively lenient master, using force only when truly necessary.",
        "Possessions": "Drakosa owned a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]''. In terms of weaponry, he owned a [[spear]] and [[sword]].",
        "Activities": "Drakosa's greatest dream as a businessman in New Amn was to one day become the governor of his own region, To this end Drakosa courted [[Cordell]], Governor of [[Ulatos]], and sent discreet letters to long-time friends in the [[Amn]]ian court that described the very difficult tasks that Cordell had to face. He also plotted to achieve this goal by manipulating factions like the merchants, the soldiers, and even the local [[Payit (ethnicity)|Payit]] people.",
        "History": "Drakosa was born in the land of Calimshan, in the city of [[Manshaka]],<ref group=\"note\" name=\"name\" /> to a Calishite man by the name of Sallah.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"name\" /> Later in life he moved to the city of [[Memnon]], where he became a noble.\n\nDrakosa traveled to Maztica with dreams of one day becoming the governor of his own region. When he arrived to the New Amnian fortress port of [[Helmsport]] they purchased a nearby plantation and its native workforce from [[Jalimar Trollslayer]], one of the original soldiers of the [[Golden Legion]], who left to find the fabled [[Michaca|City of Gold]]. He was capable in managing the plantation, raising [[tobacco]] and indigo. Eventually he too desired to find the fabled City of Gold, but cared too much for his own life to go on adventure like Jalimar, who went missing in his attempt. In Drakosa's mind the eager, loyal, and expendable [[adventurer]]s of [[Faer√ªn]] existed for this purpose.\n\nIn [[1362 DR]], he hired an adventuring party to find the [[Cloak of One Plume]] in order to give it to Governor Cordell to gain his favor. They weren't a particularly experienced group, as Drakosa believed more experienced adventurers were less likely to follow orders and more likely to be missed if they disappeared. He also sent his two servants, [[Hasoctl]] and [[Ironspike]], with the adventurers to check up on them.\n\nAt the end of [[1368 DR]], prior to returning to Maztica from Calimshan he purchased five [[jhasina]] based on their beauty, among them an agent of the [[Twisted Rune]] named [[Tara]]. He viewed the women as a potential status symbol, for not even the Governor of New Amn had a harem themselves, and thus by extension a political tool for furthering his goals of becoming a governor himself.\n\nIn later years, Drakosa managed to purchase most of the Payit lands, becoming the largest landholder of the New Amnian colonies. Then in late [[1369 DR]], he hired a small group of Legionnaires with Cordell's permission and traveled up river past the city of [[Qoral]], establishing a new plantation colony by the name of [[Drakmul]]. Within eight months Drakosa's colony proved to be very prosperous and he planned to establish a trail to the village of [[Patil]].",
        "Relationships": "The Twisted Rune viewed Drakosa as a useful tool in their own schemes, due to his activities upsetting the Amnians' hold on the lands of Maztica. One of their members, [[Jymahna|Jymahna the Enchantress]], felt he should die so that their agent Tara would be free to live among the natives and learn their elusive forms of [[divine magic]], [[hishna]] and [[pluma]]. But the [[lich]] [[Rhangaun]] advised patience instead, as he felt that Drakosa's greed would eventually lead him to press farther north into the jungles of [[Anchorome]], wherein Drakosa may catch a glimpse of what Rhangaun truly sought &mdash; the secret magic of that land's [[wild elves]] &mdash; and would most likely die while there."
