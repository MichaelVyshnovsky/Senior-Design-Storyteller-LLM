The vampires were the true leaders of the monsters and the cause of the Keeps strife. The undead proclaimed their intentions to take back what was theirs – the Keep and the Arms of the Roadwarden. With a single command word, Mordroka reformed Vidruand Starbrows undead body and commanded the Arms of the Roadwarden to fly towards the undead Starbrow. Khulzond, Mordroka, Vidruand, and summoned monsters and vampires attacked the heroes, Sir Dutiocs, Dazmilar, Kallithrea, and Yemandra.
