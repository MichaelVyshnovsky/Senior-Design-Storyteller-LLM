'''Vigilant Halasan''' was a member of the [[Waterdhavian]] [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] who served the [[Coalition]] during the [[War of the Shining Crusade]].

==Personality==
She truly loved the city of [[Waterdeep]] and made it her life to fight in its name.

==Activities==
As a vigilant in the City Guard, Halasan worked hard to see to the needs of her soldiers.

During the campaign against the [[Shining Crusade]], she was tasked with training recruits who were admitted into the Coalition army.

==Relationships==
Halasan had a dear friend named [[Tristian]], who wound up joining the Shining Crusade.

She was responsible for properly training six individuals from [[Daggerford]] who enlisted to fight for the Coalition. The group included the nervous [[spellcaster]] [[Garrold]], the passionate [[half-elf]] [[Taield]], the savage warrior [[Morlis]], the fearful [[rogue]] [[Hester]], the nimble [[Danine]], and the diminutive [[halfling]] [[Clovista]].

==History==
Though she didn't achieve a rank higher than vigilant, Halasan had served in over ten campaigns with Waterdeep's City Guard.

When the [[War of the Shining Crusade]] broke out in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Vigilant Halasan specifically volunteered to join with the Coalition forces.
