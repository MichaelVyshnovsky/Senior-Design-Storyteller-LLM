'''Yench'eng Tzu Yu''' was a [[wu jen]] member of the [[Many-Hued Peacock Society]] in [[Nakamaru]] around [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Yench'eng Tzu Yu may have an ulterior motive behind his affiliation with the Many-Hued Peacock.

After the party for the birth of [[Goshukara Sadamoto]]'s third son, [[Lui-hsia Chih]] sent [[Nan-kuo]] and Yench'eng Tzu Yu to read the aura of [[Yin-kung T'o]].

==Personality==
Yench'eng Tzu Yu appeared to be a frail man but had a true unholy vigor. He behaved in all things like a man possessed and driven to some secret end. He was a fatalistic individual, believing that all the fantastic risks and seemingly foolish gambles that he did were decided by destiny.
