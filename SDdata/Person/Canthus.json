Canthus was more commanding than others of his breed with teeth the size of a persons little finger.\nProtected by the Goddess, Canthus wore a torque of the Goddess.\nIn 1345 DR, during the Festival of the Spring Equinox on Gwynneth, Pawldo sold Canthus to Prince Tristan for 50 gp after a dramatic round of bartering."
