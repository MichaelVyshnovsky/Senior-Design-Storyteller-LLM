'''Tooralooralayo''' was a beggar, or possibly, a refugee, from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''I just hope he doesn't get in trouble for giving us this stuff. But sure it's going to waste anyway...''|Tooralooralayo}}

==Description==
Tooralooralayo was a [[human]] woman with a light skin tone, dark brown eyes, and shortly-cropped blonde hair. Her skin was dirty and clothes were humble.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Spatula Farggo]], a worker from the [[Elfsong Tavern]]'s kitchens, began helping out the beggars in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]], by bringing them kitchen scraps and leftovers to those in need, both locals, and the refugees fleeing fro the armies of [[the Absolute]]. Tooralooralayo and her son, [[Pickles]], were among those who happily accepted the scraps. Tooralooralayo's boy was happy to have more than one meal a day and the woman herself worked about Spatula Farggo getting in trouble for his sneaky generosity.
