Hurm Thiodor was a male human fighter in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr. He was the local clerk and official of the crown and the unofficial Herald in the late 1360s DR.
Hurm was slender of build and in his early 30s.
His primary duty was to handle record keeping and collect reports from adventures on the state of the nearby Hullack Forest and the monster-clearing efforts there. He was a skilled record-keeper, and worked and lived out of the Office of the Crown in Thunderstone, which he kept clean, comfortable, and in good repair. However, he was unable to get an accurate or up-to-date understanding of events in the forest, and Oversword Faril Laheralson of the Purple Dragons contingent largely ignored him.
A part-time adventurer himself, he sometimes joined bands of adventurers on their missions into the Hullack Forest and Vast Swamp to add a little flavor to his otherwise boring life.
