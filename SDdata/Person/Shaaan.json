        "Appearance": "Shaaan appeared as a woman with pure white skin, green eyes, and wild, golden hair tinged with flame-orange. She wore skin-tight clothing and thigh-high boots seemingly made of serpent scales that left much of her skin exposed. Her visage was clearly cold and menacing.",
        "History": "Shaaan was a mysterious woman with scales who once ruled a [[snake]] cult in [[Tashalar]]. She had fought many times with Elminster.\n\nOnce, around [[1340 DR]], the [[Company of Crazed Venturers]] fought Shaaan on a small isle on the [[Sword Coast]], off the coast of [[Mintarn]]. They broke her concentration on spellcasting and bid her to stop what she was working on, otherwise they'd destroy it. Then one of their members threatened Shaaan by using the ''[[disintegrate]]'' spell on a nearby stone. Shaking her head in derision, Shaaan touched ground and ''disintegrated'' the entire island, dumping the Company into the ocean as she ''[[levitate]]d'' and continued to work on her spellcasting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/2566/ed-larloch.htm|author=[[Ed Greenwood]]|title=The Ultra-Lich Larloch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021121003441/http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/2566/ed-larloch.htm|archivedate=2002-11-21|work=Pages From the Sages|accessdate=2021-08-31}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, the [[Zhentarim]] considered Shaaan, together with [[Maraunth Torr]], [[Szass Tam]], and [[Larloch]], as one of the most powerful evil archmages. \n\nAt last, in an inter-dimensional place where Elminster sometimes met people from other [[planes]], Shaaan appeared and tried to seduce the archmage [[Dalamar the Black]] from [[Krynn]], but Elminster, with the help of the archmage [[Mordenkainen]] from [[Oerth]], who'd also had an encounter with Shaaan, used [[Ed Greenwood]] to imprison her in the [[Floating Helm of Tharados]] (a unique ancient [[Netherese]] [[magic item]]).\n\nShaaan resurfaced around [[1487 DR]] and competed with other archmages for the possession of the [[Lost Spell]] during a [[spellstorm]]. Shaaan was ultimately killed by the combined effort of both [[Malchor Harpell]] and [[Manshoon]]."
