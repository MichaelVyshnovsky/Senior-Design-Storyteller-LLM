        "mainbody": "'''Jaelaera Sundeirnyn''' was a young sorceress in the mid-to-late 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. She had used her beauty, charm, and [[poison]] to kill more powerful mages and increase her power and influence. At some point prior to {{yearlink|1280}}, she challenged [[the Trapmaster]] directly and slew him. She then fought his apprentice, [[Ohland Grethgar]], who narrowly defeated her."
