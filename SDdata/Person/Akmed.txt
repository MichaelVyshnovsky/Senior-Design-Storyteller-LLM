Akmed was a tasked artist genie bound to an enchanted ring carried by Noora bint Amon in Zakhara around 1367 DR.
Akmeds particular area of expertise was weaving. He produced some of the finest cloths, rugs and fabrics found within the Land of Fate. Akmed usually gave his weavings to Noora so she could present them as gifts to solidify alliances.
