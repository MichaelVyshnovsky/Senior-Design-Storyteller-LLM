Undil Latheen was a human male priest of Waukeen in the city of Procampur in the Vast.
He served as High Priest of the Hall of Success temple of Waukeen in Procampurs Temple District. In this capacity, he led 33 priests and 69 lay-followers.
However, Latheen went mad following the apparent death of Waukeen during the Time of Troubles, in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, though he remained in charge for some time after.
By the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR, Latheen had been replaced as High Priest by Baniya Dolester. One of Dolesters duties was to care for the still-suffering Latheen.
