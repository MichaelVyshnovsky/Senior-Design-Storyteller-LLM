He was Torrin Ironstars adopted nephew and was very close to Torrin.\nIn 1480 DR, Kier stole a griffon and flew it to an earthmote hovering over the rift. Inside the mote, he found a cache of gold bars. Unfortunately, the bars were contaminated with the stoneplague, which Kier contracted. In order to save Kiers life, Torrin bought magical ointment that placed Kier into suspended animation until the stoneplague curse could be lifted.\nTorrin was killed destroying the duergar magic that caused the stoneplague. However, many years later, Moradin reincarnated Torrins soul and he was re-born as Kiers son.\nCategoryDwarves\nCategoryInhabitants of Eartheart\nCategoryInhabitants of East Rift\nCategoryInhabitants of South Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\n1v7gfdisfkvv2i6van9i1fio6z9topa"
