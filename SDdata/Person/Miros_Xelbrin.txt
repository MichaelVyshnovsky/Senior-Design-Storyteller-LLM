'''Miros Xelbrin''' was an innkeeper in [[Goldenfields]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==Activities==
Miros managed the [[Northfurrow's End]] inn. He was a member of [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Fellowship of Innkeepers]] guild and a supporter of the [[Emerald Enclave]].

==History==
Miros was born to [[Lathan Xelbrin|Lathan]] and [[Melantha Xelbrin]].

In his youth, Miros was a carnival attraction for his barrel-shaped body and his white hairs covering most of his body.

In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], he ran an inn called Northfurrow's End.

==Personality==
Miros staunchly supported the Emerald Enclave's goals. For him it was okay if people joked about him, but not about his inn or his employers, in which case he descended into a rage.
