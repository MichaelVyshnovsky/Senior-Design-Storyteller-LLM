Miros Xelbrin was an innkeeper in Goldenfields sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Miros managed the Northfurrows End inn. He was a member of Waterdeeps Fellowship of Innkeepers guild and a supporter of the Emerald Enclave.
Miros was born to Lathan and Melantha Xelbrin.
In his youth, Miros was a carnival attraction for his barrel-shaped body and his white hairs covering most of his body.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, he ran an inn called Northfurrows End.
Miros staunchly supported the Emerald Enclaves goals. For him it was okay if people joked about him, but not about his inn or his employers, in which case he descended into a rage.
