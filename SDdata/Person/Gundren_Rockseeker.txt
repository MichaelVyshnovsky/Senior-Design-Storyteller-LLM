'''Gundren Rockseeker''' was one of the three [[dwarf]] brothers who rediscovered [[Wave Echo Cave]].

==Description==
He was the brother of [[Tharden Rockseeker]], and the older brother of [[Nundro Rockseeker]]. He was also a friend to [[Sildar Hallwinter]], a member of the [[Lords' Alliance]].

==History==
[[File:Wave-echo-cave-entrance.webp|thumb|''Gundren and his brothers discover Wave Echo Cave.'']]''Circa'' [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} the dwarf and his brothers located Wave Echo Cave, the legendary home of the [[Forge of Spells]]. He excitedly rushed back to [[Neverwinter]] to gather supplies and gear, and hire a party of adventurers to haul the equipment to [[Phandalin]]. However, [[Nezznar]], under the guise of the Black Spider, sent orders to [[King Grol]] of the [[Cragmaw tribe]] to have the pair waylaid by those of the [[Cragmaw Hideout]]. King Grol ordered [[Klarg]], the chief of the hideout, to have his minions carry this mission out.

Gundren and Sildar rode two [[horse]]s across the [[High Road]], but were ambushed and captured by the Cragmaw tribe and Gundren was taken to [[King Grol]] of [[Cragmaw Castle]], losing the map to the mine in the process. The Black Spider sent out the doppelganger, [[Vyerith]], to fetch the dwarf and his map. However, Grol did not wish to do so without making some coin in the process.

Gundren later became free and, along with his brother, Nundro, administrated the mine.
