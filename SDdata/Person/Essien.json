Like other inhabitants of Samarach, Essien showed little interest in talking to outlanders.\nIn the , the salt mines of Selgol were attacked by a tribe of firenewts who came from deeper underground. The creatures dragged workers underground and claimed the excavation as the surviving miners fled. Torichs militia was informed of the attack but failed to act in a timely manner. Essien, one of the mines foremen, was desperate for help against the fiery monsters. Some said that a group of adventurers who worked with merchant SaSani of Samargol volunteered to help with the situation and eradicate the infestation after meeting the man drinking his sorrows away at The Broken Pick in Torich."
