'''Tanner''' was a guardsman who served in the [[Marsember Watch]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Brutish in appearance, Tanner was easily the largest man in his squad. He was described as having legs that resembled the trunks of trees.

==Personality==
He was not as virtuous as some of his other guardsmen, though could be convinced to take the right and just actions.

==Relationships==
During his time in the Watch, Tanner served under Topsword [[Kleef Kenric]].

==History==
Tanner was among the guardsmen tasked with clearing out [[Wilhastle Square]] of Marsember when Cormyr was invaded by the [[Shadovar]] in [[Uktar]] of the {{yearlinkName|1486}}.

When Grand Duchess [[Elira Seasilver]] was abducted aboard the ''[[Wave Wyvern]]'' that very same day, Tanner was among the men who volunteered to join the rescue mission. While he was unaware, Tanner was influenced by the magic Kleef's greatsword ''[[Watcher]]'' and his position as the [[chosen]] of [[Helm]].
