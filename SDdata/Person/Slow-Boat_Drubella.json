Umberlee will embrace us all!''|Seawind Slow-Boat Drubella}}",
        "Description": "Drubella was a [[human]] woman with short dark brown hair, gathered in a tight bun, and a tan skin tone. She had dark eyes and bore a collection of aquamarine [[tattoo]]s that framed her face from the forehead to her neck, distracting the observer's gaze from scars on the woman's nose and right cheek.",
        "Posessions": "Drubella's Seawind uniform was a set of skin-tight ceremonial [[chainmail]] dress with light pauldrons and decorative [[bracer]]s. Her weapon of choice was heavy [[crossbow]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Seawind Slow-Boat Drubella was among the church's members who performed the ceremonies and sang hymns in praise of the Bitch Queen. She was alongside Flood Tide Allandra Grey and other priestesses during [[Holli Dylford]]'s last rites. The recently perished priestess died while swimming in Baldur's Gate's [[Gray Harbor]]. Drubella believed that death to be a blessing of the Birth Queen, whose embrace was the end goal of all the faithful."
