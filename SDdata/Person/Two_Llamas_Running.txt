Two Llamas Running was a female tabaxi swashbuckler imprisoned by the evil barber Jooge Nopsmoth in Silverymoon.
Two Llamas had tan fur with gray stripes.
Being a tabaxi, Two Llamas could use her claws in combat, but preferred to fight wielding a dagger or rapier.
Intrigued by her peculiar fur, Jooge Nopsmoth lured Two Llamas into his barbershop, intending to kill her. However, the tabaxi was not affected by the barbers magical mind-wiping blow-dryer. His modus operandi interrupted, Jooge opted instead for imprisoning Two Llamas in a thirty-foot-deep oubliette, with the hope of harvesting her remains for magical reagents.
Two Llamas may have been freed by a group of adventurers.
