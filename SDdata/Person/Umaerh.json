        "mainbody": "'''Umaerh''' was a male [[drow]] [[lich]] [[sorcerer]] and an [[arcane devotee]] of [[Kiaransalee]]. During the [[Silence of Lolth]], he was a resident of the [[Undying Temple]] in [[Maerimydra]].",
        "Description": "Long white hair topped Umaerh's head, combed back neatly and tied below his shoulders in a flowing ponytail. Although gaunt, Umaerh's skin was smooth and limber. He typically wore black [[breeches]] and a white shirt, over which he wrapped himself in a delicate, open-fronted [[robe of gentle repose|robe]] the color of forest leaves. Around his neck he wore what appeared to be a mummified drow [[hand of Kiaransalee's glory|hand]] with a silver ring on each finger.",
        "Personality": "A surly [[drow]], Umaerh was quick to anger, though he was more than willing to parley with enemies he deemed useful to his wider goals. He had lofty ambitions within the [[cult of Kiaransalee]], but was mostly concerned with the death and [[undead|undeath]] facets of the goddess over anything else.",
        "Abilities": "As a [[sorcerer]], Umaerh was a rare [[lich]] compared to the usual [[wizard]]s who pursued that path. As such, he had an impressive array of offensive spells, including many [[necromancy|necromantic]] ones. He would also make use of clever [[illusion]]s to lay traps for his foes. Despite this, his most powerful spells were ''[[chain lightning]]'', ''[[feeblemind]]'', and ''[[prismatic spray]]''.\n\nAs an [[arcane devotee]] of [[Kiaransalee]], Umaerh had a particular focus in [[evil]] spells and could enlarge the effects of his spells with ease. Furthermore, his devotion to Kiaransalee had garnered him a degree of protection against the powers of [[outsider]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Umaerh's relatively healthy physical appearance was due to the ''[[robe of gentle repose]]'' that he wore, which stalled the decomposition process that usually afflicted liches.\n\nThe lich's [[phylactery]] was a plain [[mithral]] ring that was kept on [[Irae T'sarran]]'s left thumb.",
        "Relationships": "Although he was a subordinate in Irae T'sarran's plots during the [[Silence of Lolth]], Umaerh held aspirations of supplanting the high priestess of Kiaransalee and gaining control of the [[Undying Temple]].",
        "History": "Despite developing [[sorcerer|sorcerous]] powers, Umaerh still managed to delve into the [[necromancy|necromantic]] arts deeply enough to uncover the secrets of [[lichdom]]. At some point, he used this knowledge to infuse his soul into a phylactery.\nDuring the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372 DR]], Umaerh partnered with the [[cult of Kiaransalee]] and his phylactery fell into the possession of its leader, [[Irae T'sarran]]. He took up residence in the [[Undying Temple]] and created an illusory devotional image of his [[Kiaransalee|goddess]] in his chamber. While he remained there, Umaerh plotted to overthrow the high priestess, Irae T'sarran, and take control of the Temple. Until an opportunity arose, the lich bided his time and kept to himself for the most part."
