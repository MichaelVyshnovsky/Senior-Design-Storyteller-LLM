        "mainbody": "'''Funada Hashiba''' was an abbott in [[Nakamaru]] around [[1357 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Hashiba led the Nakamaru temple of the [[Shining Mountain Sect]], a very popular temple leading most ceremonies at the local court, which was a prestigious honor. He arrived at such a high position at a very young age thanks to his family but also to his abilities. However, Hashiba was not fully prepared for his task.",
        "Personality": "Hashiba was very loyal to his father the daimyo and to the [[shogun]], whom he was a distant nephew to. Usually, Mitsuhide easily browbeated him in any matters relating to the family. Hashiba knew his weaknesses well."
