        "mainbody": "Funada Hashiba was an abbott in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.\nHashiba led the Nakamaru temple of the Shining Mountain Sect, a very popular temple leading most ceremonies at the local court, which was a prestigious honor. He arrived at such a high position at a very young age thanks to his family but also to his abilities. However, Hashiba was not fully prepared for his task.\nHashiba was very loyal to his father the daimyo and to the shogun, whom he was a distant nephew to. Usually, Mitsuhide easily browbeated him in any matters relating to the family. Hashiba knew his weaknesses well."
