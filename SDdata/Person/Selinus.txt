Selinus was a young member of the Riders of Nesm√© in 1484 DR.
Just after the start of the War of the Silver Marches, Selinus discovered that his leader, Varen, was a member of a ring of horse thieves who stole Riders horses. Despite having no clear proof, he accused Varen. This caused a schism among the Riders.
Selinus was young, idealistic, and proud. He always saw the Riders as a bastion of virtue. Selinus believed himself the only person able to restore the honor of the Riders.
