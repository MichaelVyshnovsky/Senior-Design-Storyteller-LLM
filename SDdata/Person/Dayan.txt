Dayan was a vampire necromancer in Undermountain in 1479 DR.
Around 1479 DR, Dayan found a necromancers laboratory inside Undermountain with many strange necromantic machines. Quickly, Dayan started to perform experiments to create a new kind of undead, capturing many living beings in Undermountain to use as guinea pigs.
He created many undead and even truly resurrected a being. Dayan also used a speak with dead spell on the skull of a Clan Melairkyn dwarf in order to find hidden tombs.
