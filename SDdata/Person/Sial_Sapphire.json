        "mainbody": "'''Sial Sapphire''' was one of the lieutenants of the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] in [[Skullport]] in [[1479 DR]].",
        "History": "Sial was a very successful solitary thief.\n\nIn 1479 DR, [[Kal'dir]] finally found her and offered her an opportunity to meet the new [[Xanathar]]. In front of the [[beholder]], Sial challenged its authority, proclaiming herself the best burglar of the city and accusing the Xanathar's agents of being inefficient. Impressed, the Xanathar offered Sial a position as a lieutenant in the Xanathar's Guild and she accepted.\n\nIn time, she also became the guild's spymaster.[[Derek Myers]]. \"The Xanathar: Beholder Crime Lord of Waterdeep.\" ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #206. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, September 2012.",
        "Activities": "Sial supervised all the guild's activities involving thieving and burglary. She also directed the spy network of the guild, often discovering things that [[Kal'dir]], [[Quid]], or [[Draak]] believed they'd kept secret.",
        "Personality": "Sial was a natural chameleon and could change her attitude and personality as needed. So nobody knew if she lied or not. Sial was a master manipulator. In many ways, she was like a [[drow]] at heart.",
        "Residence": "Sial had no stable home, normally wandering all of the city's districts.",
        "Relationship": "Sial knew of [[Kal'dir]]'s fascination for her.",
