Lord '''Montror Barelder''' was the head of the [[Barelder]] noble family of [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Circa'' 1479 DR, Montror was in his sixth decade of life with a white mustache, graying temples, and a gravely voice.

==Personality==
Montror was a loyal traditionalist who supported the Crown and was dutiful to his own lands of the [[Tun Shores]]. Though stubborn and conservative, he was still a kind man.

==Relationships==
Montror was wed to [[Asmrae Barelder]], who assisted him in all things and managed the estate. They had [[Narnathra Barelder|Narnathra]] and two younger children.

==Possessions==
His lands were the Tun Shores, on the north side of the [[Tun River]].

==History==
Montror was the eighth Lord of Barelder. Lord Barelder was one of the guests at the [[Council of the Dragon]] held in the [[Hall of Justice]] in [[Castle Obarskyr]] during late [[Mirtul]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}. After the meeting degenerated into violence, the Lord was slain by a [[blueflame ghost]] that arrived unexpected. She drove both swords into his back while he wrestled with another noble. His eldest child Narnathra inherited from him and became Lady Barelder.

After his death, his body among others was taken to the [[Chapel of the Valiant]] and recognized; his death was confirmed.

==Reputation==
Per [[War Wizard]] [[Joreld Nurennanthur]], his death was no great loss.
