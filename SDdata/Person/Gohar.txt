'''Gohar''' was a lone barkeep who ran the [[Salty Dog Tavern]] in the docks of [[Targos]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''A little spit on these glasses will give 'em some shine...''|Gohar}}

==Description==
Gohar was a rotund [[human]] male. He resembled a large cast iron stove in the Salty Dog Tavern in size and continuous wheezing. He spoke with a sailor's drawl.

==History==
Gohar's youth was spent working as a mercenary. Sometime ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1300}}, Gohar won a knife fight and ended up being the lucky owner of the Salty Dog Tavern. He did not intend running the business and wanted to sell the establishment and use the money on drinks and tars in [[Luskan]]. However, love changed Gohar's plans. He became enamored with the Salty Dog's previous owner's wife and they together ended up running the business for over a decade, until her death in the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1311}}.

By the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Gohar was alone and married to the tavern. The drinking establishment remained open through the threat of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] and [[goblin]] sieges of Targos. When an orchestrated goblin attack took place, gaining them entrance to the town through magical means, Gohar's Salty Dog Tavern stayed active and served alcohol as the goblins ravaged the docks and warehouses. When mercenaries confronted Gohar, he refused to believe them that Targos was under attack as he did not hear a [[horn]] signal from the palisades nor screams calling folk to take arms.
