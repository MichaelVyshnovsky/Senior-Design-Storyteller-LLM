Gohar was a lone barkeep who ran the Salty Dog Tavern in the docks of Targos in the early 14 century DR.
Gohar was a rotund human male. He resembled a large cast iron stove in the Salty Dog Tavern in size and continuous wheezing. He spoke with a sailors drawl.
Gohars youth was spent working as a mercenary. Sometime circa the , Gohar won a knife fight and ended up being the lucky owner of the Salty Dog Tavern. He did not intend running the business and wanted to sell the establishment and use the money on drinks and tars in Luskan. However, love changed Gohars plans. He became enamored with the Salty Dogs previous owners wife and they together ended up running the business for over a decade, until her death in the winter of the .
By the , Gohar was alone and married to the tavern. The drinking establishment remained open through the threat of the Legion of the Chimera and goblin sieges of Targos. When an orchestrated goblin attack took place, gaining them entrance to the town through magical means, Gohars Salty Dog Tavern stayed active and served alcohol as the goblins ravaged the docks and warehouses. When mercenaries confronted Gohar, he refused to believe them that Targos was under attack as he did not hear a horn signal from the palisades nor screams calling folk to take arms.
