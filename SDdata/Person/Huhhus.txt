Huhhus was the Red Wizard made famous for discovering a recipe for potion of regeneration long before the 14 century DR.
Many years before the , a lowly Red Wizard of Thay named Huhhus found a way to perfectly distill a trolls flesh into a concoction that granted the imbibers the regenerative abilities of a troll. Few people were willing to drink the foul distillate despite the unarguable usefulness. Decades later, one of Huhhuss students used the Red Wizards method and found a way to imbue a trolls regenerative abilities onto a magic ring. The secret was to fill a hollow cavity inside a jade ring with ichor and the brains of a troll.
