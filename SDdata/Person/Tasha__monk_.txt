'''Tasha''' was a monk at the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]].

==History==
Tasha was a thief in her youth, but in time she redeemed herself, becoming a monk at the monastery.

In [[1491 DR]], Tasha was one of the monks kidnapped by cultists of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]], who planned to use them in a plot to access an [[elemental node]]. At the entrance room to the node complex under the monastery, she met an adventuring party hired by Grandmaster [[Perrywinkle Shin]] to find the missing monks. Tasha tested the adventurers, posing as a member of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]], in order to see if they could be trusted to save her fellows. If they answered correctly, she disappeared.
