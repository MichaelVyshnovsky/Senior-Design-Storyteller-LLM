        "mainbody": "Morik, often referred to as Morik the Rogue, was a thief living in the town of Luskan in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe was a friend of Wulfgar.\nIn Luskan in the , after Wulfgar fought with Tree Block Breaker, the toughest fighter on Half Moon Street, Morik attempted to kill him off with a glass of poison. His attempt was foiled by Delly Curtie. Not long after this, Morik was approached by the drow elf Kimmuriel Oblodra, lieutenant of the mercenary group Bregan Daerthe. He paid Morik to keep an eye on Wulfgar.\nBy the following year, he and Wulfgar had become good friends. The two were drinking near the docks when two would-be muggers came along, but Morik and Wulfgar quickly defeated them two and left. After Wulfgar was robbed of Aegis-fang, they tried to get information on its whereabouts. While doing that, they were manipulated into eliminating Captain Deudermonts magical protections. Assassins attacked the captain with poison, but when they were captured, they lied and framed Wulfgar and Morik for the attack. All of them were imprisoned and sentenced to death, but Deudermont believed Wulfgar was innocent and asked him to be pardoned. Both Morik and Wulfgars sentences were changed to banishment from Luskan.\nOver the next year, Wulfgar and Morik roamed the roads and became highwaymen. One day, they robbed Meralda Ganderlay, Lord Feringal Auck of Auckneys fianc√©e. Since she was already pregnant to Jaka Sculi, she lied to Feringal and said Wulfgar had raped her. Wulfgar was then taken prisoner and Morik devised a way to help him by acting as a noble from another city, Lord Burglar Brandeburg of Waterdeep. Meralda felt guilty for her lie and released Wulfgar, and he was reunited with Morik. After a few months, they came back to reclaim Colson, Meraldas daughter, so she wasnt killed.\nWulfgar and Morik then returned to Luskan. Morik stayed while Wulfgar left with Colson and Delly Curtie. Then, in 1366 DR, Morik met Jarlaxle Baenre, leader of Bregan Daerthe. Jarlaxle offered Morik the opportunity to be his associate in Luskan, promising him riches if he accepted, or certain death if he declined. For a while, Morik obeyed Bregan Daerthe, but tried to protect himself against Rai-guy Bondaleks magic with an antimagic orb. The assassin Artemis Entreri was sent to kill him, but Entreri preferred not to do so and advised Morik to leave the city, which he did.\nMorik eventually returned to Luskan again. Late in the , he was then contacted by Drizzt DoUrden and Catti-brie, who wanted information about Wulfgar. After that, he was abducted by the wizard Bellany, a girl he knew when she was an apprentice, who was working for the notorious pirate Sheila Kree. When she learned Drizzt had talked with him, he was taken with her to the far north where Sheila and her band had their hideout. When the Companions of the Hall reached there, Morik decided to side with his old friend Wulfgar and he attacked Kree when she was about to kill Wulfgar, saving his life. Wulfgar returned the favor, ignoring a lie Morik told him so he could save Bellany, now his lover, from being killed.\nAfter that Morik resided in Luskan with Bellany."
