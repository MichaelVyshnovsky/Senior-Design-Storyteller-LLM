Rastar of the Blades hailed from Calimshan. Circa the , the rogue claimed a home in Ravilars Cloak that once belonged to a merchant named Alataz Thrindol. Alataz has been absent from the Cloak for seven years, his fate unclear. Shortly after Rastars arrival, the locals started whispering of strange occurrences around the recently abandoned house. To make the houses mystery even more prominent, residents of Ravilars Cloak witnessed gargoyle flying above the building on dark and moonless nights.
