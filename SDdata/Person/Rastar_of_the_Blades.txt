'''Rastar of the Blades''' was a retired from adventuring [[rogue]] who settled in the small town of [[Ravilar's Cloak]] in [[Turmish]].

==History==
Rastar of the Blades hailed from [[Calimshan]]. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the rogue claimed a home in Ravilar's Cloak that once belonged to a merchant named [[Alataz Thrindol]]. Alataz has been absent from the Cloak for seven years, his fate unclear. Shortly after Rastar's arrival, the locals started whispering of strange occurrences around the recently abandoned house. To make the house's mystery even more prominent, residents of Ravilar's Cloak witnessed [[gargoyle]] flying above the building on dark and moonless nights.
