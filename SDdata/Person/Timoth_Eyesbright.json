        "mainbody": "'''Timoth Eyesbright''' was a male [[centaur]] adventurer who was known as a friend of [[Vajra Valmeyjar]] and [[Onyx the Invincible]] and as a hero of the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Reclamation Wars|Reclamation Wars]].<ref name=LoI1:T-p79/>",
        "Personality": "Timoth was quite loquacious. Sympathetic to a cause, he was quick to gallop to someone's aid and would tear up at their misfortunes.{{Cite comic/The Gathering}} He was a good soul and perhaps too trusting.<ref name=LoI1:T-p79/> Although he was willing to give his friends rides on his back, he understandably didn't like being called a [[horse]].",
        "Possessions": "In battle, Timoth initially wielded a [[longbow]] and a [[double-bladed sword]]. This distinctive weapon was extendable, the blades extending from the size of daggers to full-length swords. He would also use the bow to bludgeon foes. Later, he fought with a plain [[longsword]].",
        "History": {
            "Waterdeep": "In the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], Timoth was traveling with Onyx when they came across an [[elf|elven]] maid being kidnapped by [[chasme]]. Quick to help, Timoth battled the winged creatures, and together they rescued [[Cybriana]]. Timoth volunteered himself and Onyx in escorting Cybriana to Waterdeep, though it was twenty leagues out of their way. There, they helped Cybriana search for the paladin [[Priam Agrivar]], finally arriving at the [[Selûne's Smile]] tavern. The proprietress [[Luna]] introduced them to [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], who led them to Priam—the drunken beggar outside, whom they rescued from thugs.\n\nTogether, the heroes journeyed into the wilderness to seek the famed smith [[Jogaoh]], a [[dwarf]] whose forge it was said could create works of magic, whom Onyx believed could help restore strength to Priam's arms. Although Onyx doubted it would be any good against Priam's continuing drunkenness and self-pity, Timoth had hope. On the way, they were lured into a trap and attacked by a [[dustdigger]]—in truth a pet of Jogaoh named [[Ulala]]. Jogaoh also doubted Priam, yet upon hearing his tale, he agreed to help, provided the companions retrieved something from atop nearby [[Stoner's Needle]]. After battling [[ghoul]] warriors in the night, Vajra, Priam, and Jogaoh ascended the rocky tower, where Priam was restored, Jogaoh was freed of a curse, and a [[basilisk]] was slain. However, Priam had frozen in fear and departed in shame. Shortly after, [[bounty seekers]] of [[Manshaka]] ambushed the group, Timoth was netted, and they were captured.{{Cite comic/The Bounty Seekers Of Manshaka}}\n\nRegaining his courage, Priam intercepted the bounty seekers, and launched an ambush. The companions fought their way free, overpowered the bounty seekers, and left them tied up in a net dangling from a tree, before continuing on their way.{{Cite comic/The Secret of Selûne's Eye}}\n\nLater, the group heard chasme pursuing new victims and raced to the rescue. That night, Cybriana's dark twin [[Kilili]] lured the party close to the tower of [[Imgig Zu]], master of the chasme. Imgig's [[gargoyle]]s attacked, snatching up the whole party bar Timoth.{{Cite comic/Sorcerer's Moon}}\n\nEntering the caverns beneath the tower, the heroes battled through Imgig's [[ogre]] minions. Timoth discovered a trail of flowers conjured by Cybriana to where she was held. Here, Imgig Zu announced he would use the combined powers of Cybriana and Kilili to open ''[[Selûne's Eye]]'' and release his long-imprisoned people to overrun and conquer the Realms. But, too late, Imgig's people escaped, and still the ogres subdued the heroes. An exultant Imgig taunted Priam and threatened to kill him. But, just then, the roof of the cavern tore open and the brilliant light of the full moon shone through, blinding the ogres. Priam slew Imgig Zu and Cybriana merged with Kilili to form the living key to ''Selûne's Eye'', drawing all of Imgig's people back within, saving the Realms from devastation at the cost of her unique identity. She became [[Kyriani]]. The heroes returned to Selûne's Smile where Luna rewarded them.\n\nWhen [[Zomir|bounty hunters]] kidnapped Vajra from the Smile, Timoth was alerted by [[Conner]], who claimed to be an old friend of Vajra, and Conner, joined by [[Salabak]], and together they went after them. Distracting them with one of Salabak's [[illusion]]s, Timoth and Conner slew the bounty hunters with arrows. Reunited, Timoth was shocked when Vajra accused Conner of being complicit in the abduction; he had naively thought them old friends, until Vajra told how he had used her and then sold her into slavery years before. Returning to Waterdeep and the Smile, they discovered the patrons unconscious; recovering, Kyriani explained that more bounty hunters and [[Chancil Crystalheart|a mage]] had put a potion in their drinks and kidnapped the [[cat child]].{{Cite comic/Shackles of the Past |9, 12-14, 17, 21-23}} Timoth stayed behind as Vajra, Conner, and Salabak went after the kidnappers,{{speculation}} and celebrated Vajra's return.{{Cite comic/The Last Betrayal|23-24}}\n\nIn the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], an interdimensional wormhole (from the [[Great Door]]) opened in the darkened skies over Waterdeep, disgorging a swarm of [[gargoyle]]s and [[kenku (winged)|kenku]]s. Timoth and Vajra battled the flying creatures until they were overwhelmed and sought shelter in the Smile at Luna's behest. They watched the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] and [[Khelben Arunsun]] hold them off.{{Cite comic/Day of the Darkening|1-6}}\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] of 1358 DR, Kyriani's magic went awry, and she inadvertently unleashed ''[[magic missile]]s'' in Timoth's stall. He later helped rescued her from a plant monster she accidentally created. When Onyx told the group of the appearance of an [[avatar]] of [[Selûne]] in Waterdeep, Timoth admitted he'd known all along that Luna was really Selûne, figuring she just didn't want to talk about it.{{Cite comic/DC ADD comic 19}} While Kyriani investigated her disappearance when attending a party at [[Castle Waterdeep]] where the avatar was guest of honor, Timoth and the others waited at the inn. Timoth broke up an argument between Vajra and Onyx. When Kyriani returned with news, the heroes vowed to rescue Luna from the [[House of the Moon]].{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|24}}\n\nA dozen days after Luna's capture, Timoth and Onyx went to infiltrate the temple of Selûne. The dwarf snuck in through a secret hole and a grating, and let the centaur through the door, and they overcame the temple guards. After stealing their priestly robes, Timoth tried to pass himself and Onyx off as new converts to [[Uton]] and another priest. They found the room where Luna had been held, but she was gone. They were then confronted by High Priestess [[Naneatha Suaril]] and the priests, and she left [[hell hound]]s to deal with the intruders instead. Timoth and Onyx fought them off and escaped. Continuing on, they eavesdropped on Naneatha and the avatar, before they were ambushed by the [[Swords of the Lady|Lunatics]], elite but insane temple defenders. A Lunatic spellcaster dragged them out of the temple with ''[[telekinesis]]'' and dropped them in a ''[[forcecage]]''. Finally, Kyriani and Vajra arrived and rescued them. They unmasked one of Lunatics, expecting the dark goddess Shar but finding instead a brainwashed Luna!{{Cite comic/Lunatics|1-9,13-24}} The maddened Luna briefly got away, before Vajra tackled her and convinced her of the truth, realizing that the false Selûne was in fact Shar. They escaped Shar and the temple, found the streets wrecked, tangled with [[night rider]]s (where Timoth suffered one's chill touch), and observed the [[Celestial Stairway]] rising from [[Mount Waterdeep]]. Returning to Selûne's Smile, they found the inn in ruins and were ambushed by the avatar of Shar, armed with the [[Rod of Oblivion]], determined to revenge herself on the heroes and slay Selûne. Powerless, Luna fell victim to the rod. Timoth noticed that the dimensional doorway in Selûne's Smile was still present and ajar. Kyriani valiantly held Shar off as Timoth, Vajra, and Onyx struggled to open the dimensional doorway to Luna's inner room, where her godly power was stored, and released Selûne's godly power to Luna. She transformed into the true avatar of Selûne and with her ''[[light]]'' blasted away Shar's darkness. Shar vanished, and Selûne became Luna once more. The companions reunited, and Luna vowed to rebuild her inn.{{Cite comic/Total Eclipse}}\n\nAfter the Smile's brief destruction, Timoth and Vajra briefly left Waterdeep, taking up swords as mercenaries in a small war.{{Cite comic/Lawyers!|2}}\n\nOn the hottest day of summer, 1358 DR, Timoth and Vajra arm-wrestled in the Smile as Onyx collected bets. Little did they know that, in the skies above, the [[constellation]]s of the [[Centaur (constellation)|Centaur]] and the [[Woman Warrior]] were in alignment, giving power to their contest. This power merged with sweltering [[magic]] to open a door to an extra-dimensional prison, releasing [[Aviss]] and [[Fellandar]] to wreak a path of destruction in the city. [[Khelben Arunsun]] urged Timoth and Vajra to continue arm-wrestling to hold the door open, before he hurled the villains back in. Timoth and Vajra broke off, leaving the winner unknown and Onyx struggling to pay back his bets.{{Cite comic/Summer in the City}}",
