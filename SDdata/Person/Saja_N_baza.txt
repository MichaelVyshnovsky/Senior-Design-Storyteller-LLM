'''Saja N'baza''' ({{Pronounce|SAWJ|ah|_|nuh|BAH|zah|refs=}}) was a [[guardian naga]] living in the city of [[Orolunga]] several centuries before the [[Second Sundering]]. She was highly knowledgeable about [[Chult]] and the events occurring there during her time.

==Activities==
Saja N'baza was somehow linked to her temple-residence and could communicate with some individuals who entered within, even hundreds of years after the city was devastated. In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], she took what actions she could to thwart the machinations of the warlord [[Ras Nsi]] and sought to kill him for his past injustices.

==History==
Saja N'baza was thousands of years old and lived in Orolunga during the events of Ras Nsi's downfall and initial uprising. She dwelled within a shrine located in the topmost chamber of one of the city's ziggurats.

During the late 15{{th}} century, she met with both [[Artus Cimber]] and his companion [[Dragonbait]], along with a company of [[adventurer]]s as both parties sought the Forbidden City of [[Omu]].

Following the resolution of the [[Death Curse]], Saja N'baza was slain by [[Kress'voon]], a [[yuan-ti anathema]] and leader of a cult of [[Dendar]].<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Fathomless Pits of Ill Intent|3-4}}
