Gondyl Illitheeum was a doppelganger in Triboar in 1370 DR.
Gondyl appeared to be a snobbish, urbane, and slim human male proprietor of Everwyvern House. He plotted to subtly infiltrate the city with more of his fellows and one day rule the town.
Once Gondyl was part of a druuth in Gauntlgrym together with Semmonemily and under orders of the mind flayer Nalynaul. Only Gondyl and Semmonemily survived after Nalynaul escaped the illithid community in order to become an alhoon.
