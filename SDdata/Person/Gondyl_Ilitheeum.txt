'''Gondyl Illitheeum''' was a [[doppelganger]] in [[Triboar]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Gondyl appeared to be a snobbish, urbane, and slim [[human]] male proprietor of [[Everwyvern House]]. He plotted to subtly infiltrate the city with more of his fellows and one day rule the town.

==History==
Once Gondyl was part of a ''[[druuth]]'' in [[Gauntlgrym]] together with [[Semmonemily]] and under orders of the [[mind flayer]] [[Nalynaul]]. Only Gondyl and Semmonemily survived after Nalynaul escaped the illithid community in order to become an [[alhoon]].
