Relirva IndagleyBelash was a scout and retainer of House Tehkinrellz of Ched Nasad in the year 1370 DR.
Relirva was a commoner and retainer of House Tehkinrellz, trained as a scout. Serving under the weapon master Durdyn Tehkinrellz, she had the opportunity to study the chitine and choldrith of Yathchol and wrote a series of notes about their society and physiology. The Tehkinrellz nobles approved when her information indirectly resulted in the death of the secondboy of a rival house. As a reward, Relirva was allowed to also work as a sage of chitine lore.
Relirva was employed by bored nobles who wanted to hunt chitine.
