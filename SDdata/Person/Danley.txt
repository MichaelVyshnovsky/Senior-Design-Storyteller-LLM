'''Danley''' was an industrious miner who sought to reopen ore production in [[Phandalin]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''It just doesnt seem right. Maybe they have connections to the [[Black Network]]. Maybe they're representatives of [[Luskan]], or [[Amn]], or. I don't know. But how did they know the mine was there? How did they raise an army so quickly? Something's not right.''|Danley}}

==Description==
Danley was a [[human]] man with blonde hair and a nervous demeanor. He had a tendency to unconsciously rub his hands together when stressed.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Danley lived in resettled struggling Phandalin and frequented the [[Danley and Sons Inn]] in town. Danley assembled a group of fellow tough veterans of the [[Shadow War]] to clean the [[cold iron]] mines southeast of town in the [[Sword Mountains]] of their monstrous humanoid inhabitants and resume production. The plan came to a halt when two representatives of the so-called "[[Cold Mining Company]]" arrived in Phandalin and declared ownership of the mines. The representatives somehow quickly cleared out [[goblin]]s, [[orc]]s, and other creatures who infested it. Danley suspected connections to a shady organization and was displeased that all cold iron was sold to some unknown party, with people of Phandalin receiving not a single [[copper]] from the operations. During that time, Danley could be found in Danley and Sons, drinking and looking for a group of daring adventurers willing to investigate the suspicious new organization. He was offering trade agreements to heroes willing to help â€“ selling them cold iron at a discounted price.
