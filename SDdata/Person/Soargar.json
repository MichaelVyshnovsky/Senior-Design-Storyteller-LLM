        "History": "Soargar was the [[archmage]] of the [[Elethlim dynasty]] and in his role he witnessed the plague that in [[922 DR]] killed most of the family, the disappearance at sea of Princess [[Aliia]] in [[924 DR]], and finally the fragmentation of the kingdom in [[926 DR]]. Afterward, he kept in his care most of the royal treasures of Impiltur, including the famous [[sword]]s ''[[Ellendrin]]'', ''[[Malagar]]'' and ''[[Galathos]]'',{{Cite dragon/277/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Soargar's Legacy}} hoping to one day renew the country.\n\nIn [[1095 DR]], Soargar, along with his apprentice [[Sambral]] and the visiting archmage [[Velgarbrin]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], helped the War Captain of [[Lyrabar]], [[Imphras I|Imphras Heltharn]], to destroy a [[goblinoid]] horde. In the battle, Soargar was fatally injured but before he died he told Imphras where he had hidden the Impilturan treasures and encouraged him to use them to become the new king."
