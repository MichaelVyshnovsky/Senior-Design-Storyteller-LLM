Oyn Evenmoor was a merchant on the Sword Coast just before the Tyranny of Dragons.
Oyn was a stubborn, argumentative man with an opinion about everything. He would generously offer drinks to people to listen to his speeches.
At the start of the Tyranny of Dragons inÂ 1489 DR Oyn attached his wagon carrying exotic birds to a great caravan that, unbeknownst to him, was full of agents of the Cult of the Dragon transporting treasures for the Hoard of the Dragon Queen.
