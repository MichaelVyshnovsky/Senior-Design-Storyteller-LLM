'''Irixis the Sorcerorb''' was a powerful [[elder orb]] [[beholder mage]] of [[Ooltul]] in [[1370 DR]]

==Activities==
Irixis officially acted as an assistant to [[Scalmarael]] the Sage, a [[phaerimm]] and member of [[Triumvirate]] that ruled Ooltul. Secretly, it conspired to undermine the phaerimm and install a new regime, with itself in command. Irixis had many contacts in [[Teshendale]] among exiled beholders but spent at least as much time foiling the plots of its rival exiled [[beholder]]s as trying to destroy the phaerimm. In truth, the Triumvirate knew all about its schemes and permitted it to act only because it amused them. In 1372 DR, however, Irixis, this time actually unknown to the phaerimm, devised a revolutionary plot using a slave revolt led by former [[orc]] captain [[Kronnak Eyebiter]].
