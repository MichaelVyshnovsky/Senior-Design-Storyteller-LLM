==Description==
Thrastle was a woman of means, as was evident by her fine jewel-embroidered green gown. She was a [[human]] woman of a light skin tone, dark brown eyes, and well-groomed, long brown hair.

==History==
The {{YearlinkName|1492}} brought along a spike in the [[Cult of the Absolute]] activities and crime in the city. Thrastle's home was vandalized, shutters broken, thrice in a row after being replaced. She attempted to file a report with [[Liara Portyr]]'s garrison in the [[Basilisk Gate]] and was assured that the [[Flaming Fist]]s would send a builder to take care of repairs. However, a [[tenday]] later, no one showed up, forcing Thrastle Muria to attempt to confront the Flaming Fists personally.
