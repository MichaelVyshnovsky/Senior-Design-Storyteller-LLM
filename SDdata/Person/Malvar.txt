Malvar was a doppelganger leader in Undermountain in 1375 DR.
Usually Malvar and his companions Dorn and Grim posed as human merchants selling their goods to adventurers who managed to arrive in the second Level of the dungeon. Nearby resided a cloaker posing as garments that helped in a fight if needed. Malvar and his friends were the most well-informed group in the dungeon.
Malvar was an exceptional individual with a sorcerers power. He was one of the minds behind the alliance with the cloakers.
