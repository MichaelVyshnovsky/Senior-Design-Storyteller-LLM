'''Malvar''' was a [[doppelganger]] leader in [[Undermountain]] in [[1375 DR]].
 
==Activities==
Usually Malvar and his companions [[Dorn (doppelganger)|Dorn]] and [[Grim]] posed as [[human]] merchants selling their goods to adventurers who managed to arrive in the second Level of the dungeon. Nearby resided a [[cloaker]] posing as garments that helped in a fight if needed. Malvar and his friends were the most well-informed group in the dungeon.

==Personality==
Malvar was an exceptional individual with a sorcerer's power. He was one of the minds behind the alliance with the cloakers.
