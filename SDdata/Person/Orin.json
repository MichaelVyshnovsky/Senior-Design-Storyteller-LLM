        "mainbody": "rin the Red was a changeling Bhaalspawn and a follower of Bhaal who served her god during the late 15 century DR, by playing a significant role in the Absolute Crisis.\nIn her true changeling form, Orin had grey-white skin and long blonde hair she kept in a single braid, the end of which was adorned with what resembled the head of a flail. She wore a suit of blood-red armor decorated with a metal belt and wore a circlet atop her head.\nShe was one of the most sadistic and bloodthirsty individuals to ever stalk the Sword Coast. Her lust for murder and mayhem surprised even the most ardent devotees of the Lord of Murder.\nthumb|right|300px|Orin, undergoing the transformation into Bhaals slayer.\nLike other Bhaalspawn, Orin had the ability to transform into the avatar of Bhaal known as the Slayer.\nAs a changeling, she also had the ability to take on the appearance of other humanoids, and could deceive even their most loyal allies.\nOrin performed her killings with two unique blades, the shortsword called Crimson Mischief and the dagger known as the Blade of the First Blood. She also carried with her Bloodthirst, the dagger wielded by the mortal Bhaal when he performed his first murders in the city of Baldurs Gate. She also wore a unique ring that allowed her to retreat from danger.\nFor a time, she was in possession of one third of the netherstone, which she kept embedded within the Blade of the First Blood.\nOrin was born to a woman named Helena Anchev, a devoted follower of Bhaal, and Sarevok Anchev, Helenas own father and thus also Orins grandfather. Sarevok was the child of Bhaal who orchestrated the iron crisis that plagued the Sword Coast in 1368 DR, just prior to the Bhaalspawn crisis that erupted in the Lands of Intrigue. However, Orin was completely unaware of her incestuous origin and the true reason for her mothers attempted murder.Following the murder investigation quest in Act 3 of Baldurs Gate III, there is a dialogue option for the player to declare \"Sarevok had a child with his own daughter\", that is, an incestuous relationship. The player can learn this by reading \"A page from Sarevoks book\" which can be found in Sarevoks quarters, or by speaking with Helenas body, telling the truth to Orin, killing Orin, and then speaking with a still-living Sarevok, who reveals it. Since Sarevok is fully human, this implies Helena was a half-doppelganger or changeling. This is also confirmed by an excerpt from Sarevoks memoir where he calls Helena his \"shapeshifting beauty\".\nShe herself was served by a cadre of Deaths Heads, unholy servants of the Lord of Murder.\nthumb|One of the many victims of Orins and her Murder Tribunal.|360x360px\nOrin was born from an incestuous union between Sarevok Anchev and his part-doppelganger daughter Helena Anchev, as Sarevok wanted to preserve Bhaals bloodline and make a sacrifice for Bhaal. When she was aged 8, Helena attempted to murder Orin, which was said by Sarevok to be an attempt to become Bhaals chosen. To Sarevoks surprise, Orin survived and killed her mother instead. Bhaal manifested and chose Orin as his favorite while Orin toyed with her mothers severed hand.\nIn her adulthood, Orin was a devoted servant of Bhaal who served directly under the individual known as the Dark Urge during the late 15 century DR. In the , the Dark Urge orchestrated a plot with two fellow chosen of the Dead Three―Lord Enver Gortash and Ketheric Thorm—to rule the Sword Coast in the names of their gods. All the while, Orin bided her time for the right opportunity to take action and seize Bhaals favor for herself.\nAfter the trio enslaved an elder brain beneath Moonrise Towers with the Crown of Karsus and fabricated the cult of the Absolute religious movement, Orin attacked her superior, inserted a knife into his skull, and implanted a modified illithid tadpole into his brain. She then took over his role as Bhaals chosen in the plot, but unfortunately proved to be undisciplined. She continued to kill innocents in Baldurs Gate without restraint, seeking to further ingratiate herself to the god Bhaal.\nAs a shapeshifter, Orins race is fittingly ambiguous. In Baldurs Gate III itself, her race appears to be unspecified, so she could be considered human, appearance notwithstanding, with her shapeshifting power possibly due to being a Bhaalspawn or other magic. However, the Artwork from Baldurs Gate III book describes her thusly \"As a changeling, Orin the Red wields the power to impersonate, transforming in doppelganger guise to deceive her prey.\" While it could be using changeling as a byword for doppelganger or other shapeshifter as is common in D&D sources, it goes on to give a description matching the first 3.5-edition version of the changeling race, less so the 4- or 5-edition versions. Moreover, while changeling also refers to a child swapped at birth by a fey or doppelganger, Orins parentage precludes this. Given Sarevoks association with doppelganger agents, it seems likely one of these is intended to be her other grandparent, that is, Helenas mother. In this case, Orin or her grandparent could be a half-doppelganger, as described in Dragon #313, \"Strange Bedfellows\". Complicating matters, changelings have been changed in each edition, from descendants of doppelgangers in 3.5 edition, another name for doppelgangers in 4 edition, and a separate fey race in 5 edition—any one of these fits Orin. Either way, Orin is expressly of the changeling race, whatever that may be.\n*\nOrin the Red concept.png|Concept art of Orin the Red, from Artwork from Baldurs Gate III.\nOrin the Red concept 2.png|Concept art of Orin, without her armor.\nOrin the Red.png|Orins appearance in Baldurs Gate III.\nOrin the red first encounter.png|Orin the Red after revealing she was impersonating Gyldro Angleiron.\nCategoryChangelings\nCategoryBhaalspawn\nCategoryWorshipers of Bhaal\nCategoryMembers of the Cult of the Absolute\nCategoryInhabitants of the Temple of Bhaal (Undercity)\nCategoryInhabitants of Baldurs Gate\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast\nCategoryInhabitants of the Western Heartlands\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryMembers of the Murder Tribunal\nCategoryAssassins\n9ylhgoiobqonwiem6k3rr85wyed6ctr"
