        "Description": "In her true changeling form, Orin had grey-white skin and long blonde hair she kept in a single braid, the end of which was adorned with what resembled the head of a flail. She wore a suit of blood-red armor decorated with a metal belt and wore a circlet atop her head.",
        "Personality": "She was one of the most sadistic and bloodthirsty individuals to ever stalk the [[Sword Coast]]. Her lust for murder and mayhem surprised even the most ardent devotees of the Lord of Murder.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Orin transformation.png|thumb|right|300px|''Orin, undergoing the transformation into Bhaal's slayer.'']]\nLike other Bhaalspawn, Orin had the ability to transform into the avatar of Bhaal known as the [[Slayer]].\n\nAs a changeling, she also had the ability to take on the appearance of other [[humanoid]]s, and could deceive even their most loyal allies.",
        "Possessions": "Orin performed her killings with two unique blades, the [[shortsword]] called ''[[Crimson Mischief]]'' and the [[dagger]] known as the ''[[Blade of the First Blood]]''. She also carried with her ''[[Bloodthirst]]'', the dagger wielded by the mortal Bhaal when he performed his first murders in the city of Baldur's Gate. She also wore a [[Orin's temple ring|unique ring]] that allowed her to retreat from danger.\n\nFor a time, she was in possession of one third of the ''[[netherstone]]'', which she kept embedded within the ''Blade of the First Blood''.",
        "Relationships": "Orin was born to a woman named [[Helena Anchev]], a devoted follower of Bhaal, and [[Sarevok Anchev]], Helena's own father and thus also Orin's grandfather. Sarevok was the child of Bhaal who orchestrated the [[iron crisis]] that plagued the Sword Coast in [[1368 DR]], just prior to the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]] that erupted in the [[Lands of Intrigue]]. However, Orin was completely unaware of her incestuous origin and the true reason for her mother's attempted murder.Following the murder investigation quest in Act 3 of ''Baldur's Gate III'', there is a dialogue option for the player to declare \"Sarevok had a child with his own daughter\", that is, an incestuous relationship. The player can learn this by reading \"A page from Sarevok's book\" which can be found in Sarevok's quarters, or by speaking with Helena's body, telling the truth to Orin, killing Orin, and then speaking with a still-living Sarevok, who reveals it. Since Sarevok is fully human, this implies Helena was a half-doppelganger or changeling. This is also confirmed by an excerpt from Sarevok's memoir where he calls Helena his \"shapeshifting beauty\".\n\nShe herself was served by a cadre of [[Death's Head]]s, unholy servants of the Lord of Murder.",
        "History": "{{Quote|My grandfather ruled this city. A slaughterhouse ripened for ''my'' blades, and you ''stole'' it.|Orin, to the Dark Urge.}}[[File:Absolute death Murder Tribunal.png|thumb|''One of the many victims of Orin's and her Murder Tribunal.''|360x360px]]\nOrin was born from an incestuous union between Sarevok Anchev and his part-doppelganger daughter Helena Anchev, as Sarevok wanted to preserve Bhaal's bloodline and make a sacrifice for Bhaal. When she was aged 8, Helena attempted to murder Orin, which was said by Sarevok to be an attempt to become Bhaal's chosen. To Sarevok's surprise, Orin survived and killed her mother instead. Bhaal manifested and chose Orin as his favorite while Orin toyed with her mother's severed hand.\n\nIn her adulthood, Orin was a devoted servant of Bhaal who served directly under the individual known as the [[Dark Urge]] during the late 15{{th}} century DR. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Dark Urge orchestrated a plot with two fellow chosen of the [[Dead Three]]―Lord [[Enver Gortash]] and [[Ketheric Thorm]]—to rule the Sword Coast in the names of their gods. All the while, Orin bided her time for the right opportunity to take action and seize Bhaal's favor for herself.\n\nAfter the trio enslaved an [[elder brain]] beneath [[Moonrise Towers]] with the ''[[Crown of Karsus]]'' and fabricated the [[cult of the Absolute]] religious movement, Orin attacked her superior, inserted a knife into his skull, and implanted a modified [[illithid]] tadpole into his brain. She then took over his role as Bhaal's chosen in the plot, but unfortunately proved to be undisciplined. She continued to kill innocents in Baldur's Gate without restraint, seeking to further ingratiate herself to the god Bhaal.",
        "Appendix": {
            "Background": "As a shapeshifter, Orin's race is fittingly ambiguous. In ''Baldur's Gate III'' itself, her race appears to be unspecified, so she could be considered [[human]], appearance notwithstanding, with her shapeshifting power possibly due to being a Bhaalspawn or other magic. However, the ''[[Artwork from Baldur's Gate III]]'' book describes her thusly: \"As a changeling, Orin the Red wields the power to impersonate, transforming in doppelganger guise to deceive her prey.\" While it could be using 'changeling' as a byword for [[doppelganger]] or other shapeshifter as is common in D&D sources, it goes on to give a description matching the first 3.5-edition version of the changeling race, less so the 4{{th}}- or 5{{th}}-edition versions. Moreover, while 'changeling' also refers to a child swapped at birth by a [[fey]] or doppelganger, Orin's parentage precludes this. Given Sarevok's association with doppelganger agents, it seems likely one of these is intended to be her other grandparent, that is, Helena's mother. In this case, Orin or her grandparent could be a [[half-doppelganger]], as described in [[Dragon magazine 313|''Dragon'' #313, \"Strange Bedfellows\"]]. Complicating matters, changelings have been changed in each edition, from descendants of doppelgangers in 3.5 edition, another name for doppelgangers in 4{{th}} edition, and a separate fey race in 5{{th}} edition—any one of these fits Orin. Either way, Orin is expressly of the changeling race, whatever that may be.",
