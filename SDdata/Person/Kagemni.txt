Kagemni was the first king of the city of Ysawis in the Ruined Kingdoms region of east Zakhara.
Kagemni was presented with Lifedrinker, a sword enchanted by his brother Diarbekir. With their dying breaths, a group of genies who had fought and lost to the great king, cursed the blade with their magic. Kagemnie then viewed his brother as an enemy and slew him with Lifedrinker.
The brothers tale was regaled in the epic Kinslayer.
