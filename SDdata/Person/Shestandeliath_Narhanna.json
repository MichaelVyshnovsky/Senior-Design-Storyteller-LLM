        "mainbody": "hestandeliath Narhanna was a dragonborn of Tymanther and a scion of Clan Shestandeliath in the late 15th century DR. She was a direct descendant of Haizverad. \nWhile investigating the murder of Verthisathurgiesh Baruz and Shestandeliath Parvida, Mehen interrogated Narhanna, who took the place of her father, Shestandeliath Geshthax, in the investigation. However, Narhanna didnt want to help Mehen and didnt answer his questions, teasing him instead about his exile from Clan Verthisathurgiesh.\nNarhanna was Clan Shestandeliaths candidate for the elections to choose the new Vanquisher, which were expected to be celebrated in 1487 DR.\nOn Hammer 9 of 1487 DR, Geshthax sacrificed himself in order to activate the Breath of Petron so he could raise an earth barrier to surround Djerad Thymar and protect the city against Gilgeams forces. Although Geshthax didnt die by using the artifact, he was left impaired and Narhanna succeeded him as the new matriarch of Clan Shestandeliath."
