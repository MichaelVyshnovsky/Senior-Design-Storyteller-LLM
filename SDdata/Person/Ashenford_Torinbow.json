        "History": "Early in his life, he was a [[Harper]] in [[Shadowdale]] in the [[Dalelands]], until the {{yearlinkName|1328}}, when he was captured and tortured by the [[Zhentarim]]. After being rescued, Ashenford left the Harpers and lived for a time in [[Waterdeep]] as a bard before relocating to the [[Vilhon Reach]] where he joined the Emerald Enclave.\n\nBecause of the chaos caused by the [[Spellplague]], which had altered nature's ecosystems and driven [[Cindermoon]], another member of the Elder Circle, mad, the Elder Circle was stagnating in the late 15{{th}} century. However, in the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, the boy prophet of [[Lathander]], [[Stedd Whitehorn]], arrived and successfully cured Cindermoon."
