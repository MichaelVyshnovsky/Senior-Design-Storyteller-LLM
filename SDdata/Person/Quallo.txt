'''Quallo''' was a resident of [[Athkatla]] who came to live within [[Athkatla/Sewers|the city's sewers]] during the midâ€”14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
As to be expected, Quallo was a rather peculiar person.

==Relationships==
He had a pet [[carrion crawler]] that was also his best friend.

==History==
Quallo was a relatively normal man until he came under the influence of the [[sentient item|intelligent]] sword known as ''[[Lilarcor]]''. After that he took to living within Athkatla's sewer system, watching over the sword's resting place.

He knew the secrets to perform the ''[[ritual]]'' that would reveal ''Lilarcor'', and allow it to be retrieved by another individual.
