Quallo was a resident of Athkatla who came to live within the citys sewers during the midâ€”14 century DR.
As to be expected, Quallo was a rather peculiar person.
He had a pet carrion crawler that was also his best friend.
Quallo was a relatively normal man until he came under the influence of the intelligent sword known as Lilarcor. After that he took to living within Athkatlas sewer system, watching over the swords resting place.
He knew the secrets to perform the ritual that would reveal Lilarcor, and allow it to be retrieved by another individual.
