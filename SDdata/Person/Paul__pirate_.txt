'''Paul''' was a [[human]] pirate from the isle of [[Brynnlaw]] in the [[Sea of Swords]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Paul wore standard garb of a buccaneer â€“ a tunic and baggy pants.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Paul could be found drinking in the [[Vulgar Monkey]] dock-side tavern alongside the rest of the ''[[Bleedin' Mary]]'s'' crew members. Like so many fellow pirate customers of the rowdy watering hole, he was an avid shanty-singer. ''[[Fer 'e's a Jolly Good Fellow]]'' one one of his favorites.
