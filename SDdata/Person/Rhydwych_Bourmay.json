        "mainbody": "Artmaster '''Rhydwych Bourmay''' was the leader of the [[Lordly Wands]] contingent of the [[Swords of Evereska|Swords]] of [[Evereska]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The mage had black hair and thin eyebrows that granted expression to her otherwise elven visage.",
        "Relationships": "She was subordinate to Blademajor [[Aubric Nihmedu]], leader of the Evereskan noble militia. While they disagreed at times, they maintained respect for one another along with the chain of command within the Swords.",
        "History": "On [[Nightal 30]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Rhydwych and Aubric led the Swords against nearly a dozen [[phaerimm]] and their minions during the early skirmishes against the aberrant creatures. They navigated through the [[Blazevale]] towards [[Rocnest]] to aid the elves defending from within. During their trek across the battlefield, Rhydwych had her Wands set up regular shields that protected their forces from the eye rays of phaerimm-controlled [[beholder]]s.\n\nThey soon learned that the [[elven high mage]]s within Rocnest were setting up a large portal to bypass the [[Deadwall]] the phaerimm established around the [[Shaeradim]], to allow the relief army of [[Waterdeep]] to aid Evereska's forces. The two led a valiant assault against overwhelming odds and helped buy the high mages enough time"
