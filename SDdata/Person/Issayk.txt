'''Issayk''' was the most infamous forger in [[Skullport]].

==Activities==
Issayk could forge the most perfect false documents in the [[Realms]]. Thanks to his web of contacts across [[Faer√ªn]], he was always informed of coming changes in the bureaucracy of a particular kingdom. Issayk also obtained wax pressings of seals of the governments of [[Calimport]], [[Luskan]], [[Waterdeep]], [[Cormyr]], and [[Sembia]]. Obviously, his prices were very high but the true mystery was what happened to all the money Issayk earned, as nobody ever saw him with more than petty cash.
