'''Degar Mindero''' was a commander of the [[Knights in Silver]] ''circa'' [[1484 DR]].

==Description==
{{quote
|Knight-Commander Degar Mindero battled bravely. The river earned its name anew, the [[River Redrun|Redrun]], and now running red with the blood of orcs.
|A knight of unknown name
}}
The dwarves of the three citadels—[[Citadel Adbar|Adbar]], [[Citadel Felbarr|Felbarr]], and [[Mithral Hall]]—described Degar to be an arrogant one. They said he would prowl around the [[Cold Vale]], trying to make his name and looking for glory. He was said to not even ask for help from neighboring settlements on accounts of his renown.

A knight of [[Silverymoon]] claimed the opposite. Degar was described to be incredibly brave, protecting all of [[Luruar]], particularly Felbarr and [[Sundabar]].

==History==
In 1484 DR, Mindero set out to slay the increasingly aggressive [[orc]]s of the [[Many-Arrows]] tribe, but was killed in the process.

|Mindero's eyes filled with false hopes o' glory.

Following Mindero's death, a knight and emissary set off from Silverymoon to Mithral Hall, to convene with the three dwarven kings. The annoyed knight demanded the dwarves to assemble their march, and told them the fate of Mindero, whom the dwarves did not assist. They, however, claimed that Mindero was just out for glory, and didn't even alert the dwarves of his presence, nor those of [[Sundabar]], who had thousands in their garrison. [[Ragged Dain]] even stated that Mindero was a fool. This erupted in an argument between the two sides, with the knight nearly drawing his weapon. King [[Connerad Brawnanvil]] of Mithral Hall threatened to throw his body down the [[River Surbrin]], to where even his kin could not find him.
