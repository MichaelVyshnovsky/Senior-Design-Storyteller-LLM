        "mainbody": "uphelithid was the elder brain that enthralled a community of svirfneblin near the ruins of Dolblunde for a time during the 15 century DR.\nZuphelithid and its mind flayer followers enslaved a group of deep gnomes in order to find and claim an artifact known as the helmet of disjunction. The elder brain sought to use the helm to break into the ruins of Dolblunde.\nthumb|right|Zuphelithids demise at the hands of 290x290px\nSome time during the late 1400s DR,Tricks story related to the helmet of disjunction occurs some time after the Battle of the Evermoors.The battle is undated but is \"a century ago\" from the date of Honor Among Thieves. Zuphelithid dispatched mind flayer agents to recover the Helm of Disjunction from the stalwart, Thayan paladin Xenk Yendar. While the elder brains plan failed, an intrepid pair of deep gnomes―who hoped to save their family from Zuphelithids tyranny―managed to steal the helm from the paladin themselves.\nThe deep gnomes convinced Xenk Yendar to save their people, in a foolhardy and ultimately unsuccessful attempt of righteous do-goodery. The plan worked to Zuphelithids advantage however, as the foolish gnomes allowed the Helm of Disjunction to fall into the elder brains clutches. Unfortunately, the stubborn paladin and hapless gnomes would not be deterred. The gnomes drove a massive drill into Zuphelithids lair, while the \npaladin from Thay broke into its inner lair, and slew the elder brain."
