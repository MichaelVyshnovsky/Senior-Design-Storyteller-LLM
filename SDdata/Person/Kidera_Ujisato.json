        "mainbody": "Kidera Ujisato was the commander of the sohei of the Winter Sect in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.\nUjisato always tried to maintain the neutrality of the temple in the conflicts between the citys clans.\nUjisato inherited many of the qualities of his father. He was lean and wiry, balancing being correct and proper with acting cheerful and friendly. He was respected by his men and was a good commander. He trusted others but remained vigilant for deception and duplicity. When he was absorbed by a problem, he used to suck on his lower lip. Despite ancient ties between his family and the Goshukara clan, Ujisato was personally loyal to the Funada clan."
