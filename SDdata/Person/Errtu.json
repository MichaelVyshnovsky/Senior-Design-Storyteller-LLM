        "mainbody": "rrtu () was a powerful balor. He commanded his own layer of the Abyss and the tanarri inhabitants that resided there.\nHe had a particular interest in gaining power on and from the Prime Material Plane, in particular Toril.\nHe carried a vorpal sword that appeared as a bolt of lightning and was resistant to magic.\nErrtu once worked for the group of liches that created the artifact named Crenshinibon. When it was brought to \"life,\" Errtu was cast back to the Abyss. He originally thought Crenshinibon was destroyed in the same blast. \nAfter he learned that Crenshinibon had not actually been destroyed, Errtu devoted his existence to finding Crenshinibon again. His search for Crenshinibon led him into several altercations with the drow ranger Drizzt DoUrden, who sought to keep the artifact out of Errtus hands. The first time, when Errtu was serving as Akar Kessels general in Icewind Dale in the , Drizzt summoned Errtu, meaning to pose as a drow scout and inquire about Crenshinibon. When Errtu discovered Drizzts ivory unicorn pendant—the holy symbol of Mielikki—he attacked the drow, surrounding himself with flames and using his whip to catch Drizzt and pull him into the flames. Upon contact with Drizzt, the flames were extinguished by the magic of the as-yet unnamed scimitar Icingdeath. In a confused moment for both of them, Drizzt slashed Errtu with Icingdeath, causing the balor real pain and the blades magic even froze the tissues at the edge of the wound. Errtu and Drizzt were both shocked, having never even heard of a weapon with such an effect, but Drizzt recovered first and stabbed the balor in the stomach. The scimitars magic won out, destroying Errtus material body and banishing him for a hundred years. As his body dissolved, Errtu reminded Drizzt of their long lifespans and promised revenge.\nIn the , after Drizzts companion Wulfgar was \"killed\" by a yochlol summoned by Vierna DoUrden, the evil goddess Lolth gifted the barbarian to Errtu as a bargaining chip in exchange for his guardianship of Menzoberranzan during the Time of Troubles. While sending his demons to Menzoberranzan, Errtu assumed that the magical chaos caused by the Time of Trouble would possibly nullify his banishment only to be summarily rejected as he attempted to re-enter the Material Plane. \nDuring the siege of Mithral Hall, Errtu observed Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre hunting for Drizzt. Knowing he couldnt risk the drow renegade getting killed at Baenres hands, Errtu passed a coffer containing a black sapphire capable of nullifying magic to a glabrezu being summoned by Yvonnel, coercing the tanarris cooperation with the promise of becoming his general. This resulted in the deaths of Yvonnel and her daughters, Bladen-Kerst and Quenthel, who were heavily reliant on magic, at the hands of the Companions of the Hall.\nLater on, Lolth upheld her end of the bargain and handed over Wulfgar to Errtu, having anticipated he would somehow ensure Drizzts survival. She then offered him the chance to redeem himself in her eyes by observing the chaos in Menzoberranzan as a result of Yvonnels demise. That same year, after the fall of House Oblodra, the houses matron mother, Kyorl Odran, was also given to Errtu as a prisoner.\nIn the , he set in motion a series of events to break his banishment. He sent a doppelganger to impersonate Captain Deudermont to direct Drizzt to Caerwich. Though Guenhwyvar exposed the doppelganger, the incident compelled Deudermont to direct the Sea Sprite to Caerwich anyway, where a hag relayed a riddle to the drow, implying that an old enemy was holding someone dear to him. When he eventually deduced his adversary to be Errtu, he assumed the prisoner to be his father Zaknafein. Drizzt would later summon Errtu with the aid of Cadderly Bonaduce, at which the balor declared that simply summoning him back to the Material Plane, he had broken his banishment, before Cadderly managed to send him back to the Abyss. Subsequently, the glabrezu, Bizmatec, informed Errtu that he had tricked the wizard, Dosemen of Sundabar, into summoning him. Upon being summoned to Dosemens quarters, Errtu used an anti-magic stone he kept in a bag, a leftover from the Time of Troubles. This dispelled the summoners protective magic circle against evil, which was otherwise flawless, and likewise disabled Errtus magical abilities. However, Errtu, being very strong physically, did not need them to kill the summoner. That year, the balor gained the artifact Crenshinibon and used it to build a stronghold in the Sea of Moving Ice, a body of water west of Icewind Dale and dotted with icebergs. Despite his dislike of cold, Errtu chose the place because of its natural barriers. He opened a gate to the Abyss and let innumerable lesser fiends through, as well as more powerful demons. Drizzt and his friends managed to fight their way through, and confronted Errtu in an ice cave. This time, Errtu had space to fly, and repeatedly teleported around the room, using his flames to melt nearby ice and fill the floor with water—in which he would periodically thrust his lightning-bladed sword to shock the companions. Drizzt and his friends would have died, had Wulfgar not been inadvertently freed by a younger barbarian via the hammer Aegis-fang and joined the fight. Together, the companions managed to bring Errtu out of the air, where Drizzt struck with Icingdeath and banished him for the second time.\nIn the , Errtu appeared outside the walls of Bryn Shander, seeking Drizzt. The drow warrior Tiago Baenre confronted him and banished him, making himself a hero to the inhabitants of the city. The spot where Errtu was slain was permanently blackened. On that spot, the citizens erected a statue of Tiago with the inscription, \"On this spot did Master Tiago slay the demon. And the snows will cover it nevermore.\"\nAlthough he had tortured her and considered her his toy, Kyorl Odran willingly schemed with Errtu a century later when Lolth plotted to use her as a way to weaken the barriers between the Abyss and the Prime Material Plane. In the , Lolth incapacitated Errtus rival, Balor, as a favor to him. In exchange, Errtu allowed Kyorl to speak with Kimmuriel Oblodra. She provided him with an incantation to subliminally convey to Gromph Baenre. When Gromph cast the incantation, believing it to be the product of his genius, it weakened the walls of faerzress, allowing demons such as Demogorgon to freely pass into Toril.\nErrtu was known to cooperate with other evil beings. In 1356 DR, he chose to ally himself with the wizard Akar Kessel on the promise that when Kessel died (which wouldnt be long in Errtus view, even if Kessel died of old age), he would gain Crenshinibon. In 1358 DR, he became a reluctant ally of the drow goddess Lolth—at first because she could obliterate him if he didnt cooperate, and later because she offered him a chance to gain total, personal revenge on Drizzt.\nErrtu was the greatest rival of Balor, the great demon for which the balor race was named."
