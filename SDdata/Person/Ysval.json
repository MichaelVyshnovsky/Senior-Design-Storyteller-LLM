His body looked as if made of the shadow-stuff of the night itself. He had no face, just a flat triangular space set with a pair of pale eyes, blank and round as pearls.\nUnlike many other undead creatures, Ysval could bear the touch of sunlight without actual harm, though it made him feel uncomfortable. He had the mystical strength to darken the day to a point where it seemed almost as dark as during the night. When conversing with his underlings, Ysval used a psychic bond for communication without words.\nIn the , Ysval led an army of undead to conquer Thay He felt kinship with Shex, one of his commanders.\nHe was slain by the combined attacks of Bareris Anskuld, Mirror, Aoth Fezim, Milsantos Daramos, and Nymia Focar at the fight of Thazar Keep."
