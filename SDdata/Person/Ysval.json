        "mainbody": "'''Ysval''' was a [[nighthaunt]] from the [[Plane of Shadow]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]..",
        "Description": "As a nighthaunt, Ysval somewhat resembled a [[gargoyle]] with bat wings, talons, curling horns, and a whipping serpentine tail. His body looked as if made of the [[Shadowstuff|shadow-stuff]] of the night itself. He had no face, just a flat triangular space set with a pair of pale eyes, blank and round as [[pearl]]s.",
        "Abilities": "Unlike many other [[undead]] creatures, Ysval could bear the touch of sunlight without actual harm, though it made him feel uncomfortable. He had the mystical strength to darken the day to a point where it seemed almost as dark as during the night. When conversing with his underlings, Ysval used a psychic bond for communication without words.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Ysval led an army of undead to conquer [[Thay]] He felt kinship with [[Shex]], one of his commanders.\n\nHe was slain by the combined attacks of [[Bareris Anskuld]], [[Mirror (ghost)|Mirror]], [[Aoth Fezim]], [[Milsantos Daramos]], and [[Nymia Focar]] at the fight of [[Keep of Thazar|Thazar Keep]]."
