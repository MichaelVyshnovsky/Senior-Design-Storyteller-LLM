Raagg carried a crude, goblin-made bow.
In the , cultists of the Absolute raided the inn of Waukeens Rest. They killed many innocents and took several captives. After their victorious raid, many goblin cultists returned to the Shattered Sanctum temple to celebrate. They had a grand feast, that included roasted dwarf, and copious amounts of ale. Raagg and several of her allies got thoroughly drunk and passed out in the upper reaches of the temples courtyard.
