Sharp-eye '''Raagg''' was a [[goblin]] member of the [[cult of the Absolute]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Raagg carried a crude, [[goblin]]-made [[bow]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, cultists of [[the Absolute]] raided the inn of [[Waukeen's Rest]]. They killed many innocents and took several captives. After their victorious raid, many goblin cultists returned to the [[Shattered Sanctum]] temple to celebrate. They had a grand feast, that included roasted [[dwarf]], and copious amounts of [[ale]]. Raagg and several of her allies got thoroughly drunk and passed out in the upper reaches of the temple's courtyard.
