{{quote|So, it seems yet another brave adventurer must fall victim to the powers of Ilkor of Thay. Know that I asked you nicely to leave, before I scattered your remains to the four winds.|Ilkor}}

==Relationships==
Ilkor had a nasty and sadistic ''[[familiar]]'', a [[fire mephit]] named [[Creech]].

==Abilities==
Ilkor of Thay was a competent spellcaster that could summon ''[[skeleton warrior]]s'' to aid him in combat.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]] Ilkor of Thay resided in Daggerford's [[Daggerford/Money Quarter|Money Quarter]] in one of the flophouses. He used the space as the base of his nefarious operations. The flophouse contained a large [[summoning circle]] that radiated an [[Magic aura|aura]] of [[necromancy]], a ''[[crystal ball]]'', and an oversized research book.
