Gantharla was the older sister of King Iltharl the Insufficient and, from the Year of the Dun Dragon, 245 DR, she became the 18th Obarskyr monarch and first reigning queen of Cormyr.
Gantharla had brilliant red hair, worn short. She wore mottled green foresters leathers including a hood, and an elven chain shirt tinted green.
Gantharlas father was Boldovar the Mad. Her brother was Iltharl the Insufficient.
She had an illegitimate son before her coronation, Roderin Obarskyr.
Gantharla had a sword called Shiningbite. The sword was also known as Drakes Tooth, and there was also a Cormyrian ship by that name.
Gantharla had patrolled the Western Marches of Cormyr with her foresters. She stationed her foresters on Soldiers Green near Suzail and marched into Faerlthanns Keep, thinking Iltharl was interfering with her plans, but he abdicated the throne to her, making her the first queen of Cormyr.
