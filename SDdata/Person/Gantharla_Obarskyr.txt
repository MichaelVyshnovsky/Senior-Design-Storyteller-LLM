'''Gantharla '''was the older sister of [[Iltharl Obarskyr|King Iltharl the Insufficient]] and, from the [[245 DR|Year of the Dun Dragon, 245 DR]], she became the 18th [[Obarskyr]] monarch and first reigning queen of [[Cormyr]].

==Appearance==
Gantharla had brilliant red hair, worn short. She wore mottled green forester's leathers including a hood, and an elven chain shirt tinted green.

==Relatives==
Gantharla's father was [[Boldovar Obarskyr|Boldovar the Mad]]. Her brother was [[Iltharl Obarskyr|Iltharl the Insufficient]].

She had an illegitimate son before her coronation, [[Roderin Obarskyr]].

==Possessions==
Gantharla had a sword called [[Shiningbite]]. The sword was also known as Drake's Tooth, and there was also a Cormyrian [[Drake's Tooth (ship)|ship]] by that name.

==Background==
Gantharla had patrolled the Western Marches of [[Cormyr]] with her foresters. She stationed her foresters on [[Soldier's Green]] near Suzail and marched into [[Castle Obarskyr#Faerlthann's Keep|Faerlthann's Keep]], thinking Iltharl was interfering with her plans, but he abdicated the throne to her, making her the first queen of Cormyr.
