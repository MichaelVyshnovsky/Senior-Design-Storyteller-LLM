Riti was a githyanki fighter with a little training in magic. He was once a slave before his entrapment in a strange device of the Underdark.
Riti fought with a two-handed sword and wore leather armor. He owned a cursed spear called Backbiter, which would inflict damage on the wielder when it struck another. The githyanki also owned a scroll of improved haste.
Riti may have been released from the third-from-the-left chamber of the Facet sphere. If released, he told Gorions Ward that he would not be enslaved again. The githyanki mentioned that he must erase the "living death" and fight for a place at the side of Gith.
