        "Description": "Beth wore green finery with blur trim. She had fair skin and brown hair.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Lady Beth was one of the eyewitnesses of a fierce magic battle between [[Jon Irenicus]], the [[Shadow Thieves]], and the [[Cowled Wizards]] that collapsed a part of the [[Waukeen's Promenade]] in Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Center District|Center District]]. She later recalled the visitors of the Promenade ran scared from the spell-battle and a young spell-caster named [[Imoen]] being taken into custody by the Cowled Wizards along with the cruel [[archmage]]. Lady Beth also was not surprised by the fighting as she kept an ear close to the ground regarding the workings of Athkatla through gossip from her stableboy and other servants."
