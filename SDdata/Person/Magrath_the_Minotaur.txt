Magrath the Minotaur was a pirate lord who briefly ruled over the city of Suzail.
Fleeing from a Chondathan mercenary army that had invaded the pirate city of Westgate, Magrath landed in Cormyr and purchased the city of Suzail from Melineth Turcassan for 500 sacks of gold in 429 DR. Magrath then plundered the citys treasury and took over as its ruler, seeking to expand his influence within Cormyr, and put a price on King Duar Obarskyrs head, higher than what he had paid for Suzail.
In 432 DR, Magrath was killed by King Duar after an attack on the traitorous house Dheolur.
Magrath wielded a battleaxe with a thick ironwood haft.
