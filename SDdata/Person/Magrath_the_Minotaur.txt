'''Magrath the Minotaur''' was a pirate lord who briefly ruled over the city of [[Suzail]].

==Biography==
Fleeing from a [[Chondathan]] mercenary army that had invaded the pirate city of [[Westgate]], Magrath landed in Cormyr and purchased the city of [[Suzail]] from [[Melineth Turcassan]] for 500 sacks of [[gold]] in [[429 DR]]. Magrath then plundered the city's treasury and took over as its ruler, seeking to expand his influence within Cormyr, and put a price on King [[Duar Obarskyr]]'s head, higher than what he had paid for Suzail.

In [[432 DR]], Magrath was killed by King Duar after an attack on the traitorous house [[Dheolur]].

==Equipment==
Magrath wielded a [[battleaxe]] with a thick [[ironwood]] haft.
