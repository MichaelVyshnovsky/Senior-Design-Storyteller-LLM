        "mainbody": "'''Diinakvil Rylafyrn''' was the leader of the [[derro]] [[Council of Savants]] of [[Gracklstugh]] in [[1370 DR]]",
        "Personality": "Diinakvil was a firm supporter of the status quo and spent most of his efforts in ruining the more outrageous plots of his fellow derro savants. His areas of expertise were [[dwarven]] history of [[northwest Faer√ªn]] ([[duergar]] and [[shield dwarf]]), politics, and slave trading in the [[Underdark]].",
        "History": "Diinakvil was the longest-surviving member of the Council of Savants, and among the most political influential people of Gracklstugh. Some rival savants suspected that Diinakvil had some secret hold over King [[Tarngardt]] because the Deep King rarely did not follow the derro's suggestions. He also served under the rule of [[Horgar Steelshadow]]."
