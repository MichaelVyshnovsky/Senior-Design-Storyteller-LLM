        "mainbody": "'''Venn''' was a traveling musician, performer, and [[bard]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Venn was a [[half-elf]] whose face was permanently colored with a knowing smirk, as if he was the only one in on a joke. He wore a wide-brimmed hat and well-worn bright red clothes.",
        "History": "In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, Venn, a [[lute]]-payer, was a part of a [[rogue|roguish]] band of traveling performers that included [[Lila]], a [[flute|flautist]]; [[William (Crossroad Keep)|William]], a [[tambourin]]ist; and the troupe's leader, a flaming dancer named [[Azahr]]. Venn and the band spent some time performing at the [[Crossroad Keep]] as it was being reinvigorated by trade and commerce after a devastating [[Shadow War]]. The band's leader was happy to be making [[coin]] once again and planned on staying at the keep for a little while. However, that time was cut short after Azahr sole a precious artifact—the ''[[Gauntlets of Ironfist]]''—from the keep's seneschal. Venn accompanied his bandmates to Azahr's cabin hideout in the [[Neverwinter Wood]]. [[Khelgar Ironfist]] sent a group of adventurers to retrieve the precious stolen magic item; a brawl over it was guaranteed."
