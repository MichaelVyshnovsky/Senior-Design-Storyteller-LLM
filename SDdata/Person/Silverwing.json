        "mainbody": "Silverwing was a movanic deva that the giants of Utgard kept prisoner for untold years as a twisted form of amusement, considering him a sort of jester for the fortress city.\nThe body of Silverwing was kept chained to a high table. His wings were broken and in twisted angles, incapable of flight, having been deliberately crushed with rocks by his giant captors. The feathers on these wings were grimy and in near constant state of molting off.\nOver time a rumor developed that the feathers of this deva brought good luck to those that held them, though some giants refuted these claims.\nAt some indeterminate time this movanic deva was ambushed by a group of giants and imprisoned in Utgard, where he was eventually given the name Silverwing by his captors. Over the many years of his confinement, the deva refused to speak a word.\"\nIn the late 14 century DR, Silverwing was still being held captive within the walls of Utgard.The imprisoned deva mentioned in Three Coins in a Well is unnamed, but is presumed to be the same deva that was described in the Planescape boxset Planes of Chaos as being a prisoner in the city of Utgard. Torheim, a proxy of the Norse power Thor, came to learn about the imprisoned deva and scouted the area around the city in hopes of infiltrating it and rescuing him. Around this same time a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff, a city on the Prime Material world of Toril, traveled to Ysgard in search of the legendary Well of Mimir. While traveling through Jotunheim they met Torheim and he asked the heroes if they could break into Brimirs hall and steal the deva feather from him, as having it would make it much easier for Torheim to track the deva down inside Utgard."
