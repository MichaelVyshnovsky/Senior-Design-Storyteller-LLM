'''Kylie Jansen''' was a [[gnome]] [[thief]] and a [[turnip]] peddler who lived in [[Athkatla]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''You are most gracious. Look upon the finest assortment of [[turnip]]s in Athkatla! Red and gold from the South, even the blue turnips of the North! All fresh!''|Kylie Jansen}}

==Possessions==
Kylie Jansen wore a set of simple [[leather armor|leathers]] and was armed with an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[dagger]]. She also carried a ''[[potion of extra healing]]'' and two ''[[potions of invisibility]]''.

==Relationships==
Kylie Jansen was a niece of the adventurer named [[Furnbottom Jansen]] and cousin of inventor [[Jan Jansen]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Kylie Jansen could be found in Athkatla's [[Athkatla/River District|River District]] slums where she peddled her wares – a collection of [[turnip]]s of all sized and colors, out of a barrel right outside the [[Jansen]] family home. She eagerly advertised her goods as "delighting the palate" and beloved by all genders and ages, vegetables of many uses. Some of the uses Kylie advertised included [[turnip stew]], boiled turnips, turnip salad, and of corse, turnip-and-[[egg]]s.
