Kylie Jansen was a gnome thief and a turnip peddler who lived in Athkatla during the mid–14 century DR.
Kylie Jansen wore a set of simple leathers and was armed with an enchanted +1 dagger. She also carried a potion of extra healing and two potions of invisibility.
Kylie Jansen was a niece of the adventurer named Furnbottom Jansen and cousin of inventor Jan Jansen.
In the , Kylie Jansen could be found in Athkatlas River District slums where she peddled her wares – a collection of turnips of all sized and colors, out of a barrel right outside the Jansen family home. She eagerly advertised her goods as "delighting the palate" and beloved by all genders and ages, vegetables of many uses. Some of the uses Kylie advertised included turnip stew, boiled turnips, turnip salad, and of corse, turnip-and-eggs.
