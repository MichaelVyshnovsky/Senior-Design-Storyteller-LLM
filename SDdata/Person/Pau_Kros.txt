'''Pau'Kros''' was an outcast seer in [[Menzoberranzan/Braeryn|Braeryn]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the 12{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Pau'Kros was once a wizard with talent in [[divination]] and probably some [[psionic]] powers. He hailed from a small House and was a master at [[Sorcere]] until Pau'Kros earned the disfavor of [[Gromph Baenre]]. Suddenly his House was destroyed and he was cast out of the Academy.

Pau'Kros started living in Braeryn, where he used his talents to tell the destiny of common people for the right price.

In [[1296 DR]], Matron [[Malice Do'Urden]] under advice from [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]] went to Pau'Kros in order to know about her new childbirth. The seer confirmed to the Matron that the father of her newborn was Zak. However, just after speaking to Jarlaxle, Pau'Kros revealed that Malice expected a son.

==Relationships==
Pau'Kros was an acquaintance of [[Jarlaxle]] and hoped to one day to join [[House Oblodra]].
