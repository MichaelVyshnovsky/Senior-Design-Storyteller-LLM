'''Lord Seiveril Miritar''' (also '''Councilor Seiveril Miritar''' and '''Lord of Elion''') of the [[House Miritar|Miritar]] clan was a [[sun elf]] high priest of [[Corellon Larethian]] and a [[Council of Evermeet|councilor]] of [[Queen Amlaruil Moonflower]]. He lived at [[Seamist]], the Miritar palace. He was over four hundred years old.{{cite book/Forsaken House|44-45}} Seiveril also owned a townhouse on a hill overlooking the harbor in [[Leuthilspar]].

==Description==
Seiveril was slim with coppery red hair streaked with silver, and although he had thin lines at the corners of his mouth and around his eyes, he was still fit.

==History==
As a boy, Seiveril's father [[Elkhazel Miritar|Elkhazel]] told him many stories of the heroism of [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]] and he became Seiveril's boyhood hero. Elkhazel also told him about Fflar's sword [[Keryvian]], and he retrieved it, mounting it in his home. Seiveril would later resurrect Fflar to fight alongside him. 

==Status==
Seiveril had been a member of the [[Council of Evermeet]] for eighty years by virtue of his governorship over the town of [[Elion]]. On [[Ches]] 10 [[1374 DR]], Seiveril stepped down from the council and announced that he would be leaving the island for [[Myth Drannor]], appealing for volunteers to accompany him in the elven struggle against the [[daemonfey]] that had invaded earlier that year.. What was initially a crusade later turned into a return.

Seiveril died in [[1374 DR]] killed by [[Xhalph]] during the final battle of the [[Cormanthor War]] inside [[Myth Drannor]].

==Relationships==
[[Ilsevele Miritar]] was Seiveril's daughter. [[Ilyyela Miritar]] was his wife. His father, [[Elkhazel Miritar]], fought in the failed defence of [[Myth Drannor]] in [[714 DR]].
