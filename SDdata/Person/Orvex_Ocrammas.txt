'''Orvex Ocrammas''' ({{Pronounce|OR|vex|_|oh|KRAW|mus|refs=
}}) was a scribe and translator in [[Chult]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Omu's secrets are too vast for any single conversation…|Orvex Ocrammas}}

==Personality==
Orvex was pragmatic and mercenary in his choice of employers,

==History==
Orvex was born in the mid–15{{th}} century DR, and was in his early forties and had begun to go bald by the time of the [[death curse]].{{ToA-time}}

During the events of the curse, he worked for a [[Thay]]an expedition to [[Omu]] led by the [[Red Wizard]] [[Zagmira]], although he felt little loyalty to these employers and worked with them solely for the good pay. While investigating the Omuan ruins, he successfully learned to decipher the [[Old Omuan]] alphabet, allowing him to read ancient carvings that informed him about the [[Legend of the Nine Gods]] as well as about the city's shrines to the [[Nine Trickster Gods]]. He created a number of maps of the ruins to show the locations of these shrines.

Eventually, the [[yuan-ti]] of Omu attacked the Thayans' encampment, killing most of the expedition. Orvex survived, but an explosion left him buried under a fallen wall, whereupon he was subsequently abandoned. He soon began suffering from exhaustion and dehydration.
