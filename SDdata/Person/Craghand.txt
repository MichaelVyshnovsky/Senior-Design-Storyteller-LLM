Lord Craghand was a roaming undying skeletal creature who once was a petty lord from the land of Unther in the Old Empires, long before the 14 century DR.
In life, Lord Craghand possessed no talent with the Art and employed a small army of necromancers to compensate for the shortcoming. Under his command, the necromancers enchanted a handful of fiery morningstars – Bone Phoenixes. Craghand sought to immortalize his pet rule through dark necromantic spells. However, the magics were unsuccessful. Instead of making the lord immortal, Lord Craghand and his court became cursed with a strange form of undeath. They were turned into the so-called "Bone Phoenixes," undying skeletal creatures that roamed and menaced Faerûn. Every time these undead creatures perished or were slain by well-meaning heroes, they returned to undeath shortly after, doomed to endless accursed existence.
