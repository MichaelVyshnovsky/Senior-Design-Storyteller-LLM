        "mainbody": "Gofus, also known as Gofin, was a fisher from the island of Chawdik in the Korinn Archipelago in the 14 century DR.\nGofus was a gnome and a proficient fisher and netter. They knew how to use daggers when the need to defend themselves arose. The fisher lacked in strength but was a charismatic individual who spoke several languages Common, Dwarvish, Gnomish, Halfling, Goblin, and Kobold.\nIn the mid-14 century DR, at the age of 319, Gofus was among other inhabitants of the Korinn Archipelago, captured by a gang of slavers. While sailing across the Sea of Swords, the ship was hit by a squall and ended up a wreck. Gofus and several other slaves had washed ashore on the Island of Viledel. There, the group faced the challenges of survival, eventually escaping the doomed island. It was unknown if Gofus survived the misadventure.\nCategoryGnomes\nCategoryFishers\nCategorySlaves\nCategoryInhabitants of Chawdik\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sea of Swords\nCategoryInhabitants of the Korinn Archipelago\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryYear of Manuscripts\ngcdxiacfh3z36ocyy552x1nx6vpb3us"
