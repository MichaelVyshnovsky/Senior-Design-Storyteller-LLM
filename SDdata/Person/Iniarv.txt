'''Iniarv''' was the Mage Royal of [[Uthtower]] and the [[lich]] who created the [[Mere of Dead Men]].

==History==
In the early years of the [[Uthtower]] realm, Iniarv served as the Mage Royal of Uthtower. He built a [[Iniarv's Tower|tower]] near the [[High Road]] about 60 miles from Uthtower and used it as his base, releasing a number of magical beasts and experimental monsters into the wild. However, he disappeared from the public eye, choosing to become a lich and retreating to his tower's crypts. His whereabouts were not known until the forces of [[Phalorm]] chose the tower as a defensive spot in their fight against the [[orc]] invasion of [[615 DR]]. The fighting enraged Iniarv. He emerged from his tower and, upon being requested by King [[Uth VII]] to aid the soldiers, called on the ocean to flood the land, turning it into the swamp known as the [[Mere of Dead Men]]. His fate after that event was unknown.
