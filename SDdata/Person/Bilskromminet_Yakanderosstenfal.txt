Bilskromminet Yakanderosstenfal was the only gnome Proven Thief of the Shadowmasters of Telflamm in 1370 DR.
Bilskromminet loved pranks like all gnomes, but he always targeted people he disliked, and his pranks were usually very humiliating.
Bilskromminets position in the guild in 1370 was to teach smaller members (usually children) how to take advantage of their size.
