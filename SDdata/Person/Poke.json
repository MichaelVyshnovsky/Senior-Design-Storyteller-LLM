        "mainbody": "oke was a monk and a member of the Disciples of St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose in the midâ€“14th century DR. Poke was the head of the monastery at the time, holding the rank of Grand Master of Flowers.\nGrand Master Poke died suddenly in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR. This necessitated that Kane, a Master of Spring and next-in-line for the position of Grand Master, hurry back to the monastery and manage affairs until a new Grand Master could be trained and selected. However, Kane had no wish to remain in the position, and the next most senior monk, Temmenische, was near a hundred years of age. Thus Kane and Temmenische selected the much younger Cantoule to succeed Poke as Grand Master."
