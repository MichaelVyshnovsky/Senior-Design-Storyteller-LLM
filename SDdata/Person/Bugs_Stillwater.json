        "mainbody": "'''Bugs Stillwater''' was a member of [[The Guild]] from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Bugs Stillwater was among the members of the Guild who noticed strange shifting shadows in the darkness around the Guildhall. Bugs claimed that he had nothing to drink that night and that the shadow changed shape. Presumably, the shadow was one of the many murderous [[doppelganger]]s of [[Bhaal]], spying on the The Guild.\nDuring that year, Bugs was also a customer of [[Bonecloak's Apothecary]] in the Lower City. He made the error of taking medical advice from the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette''. On the [[broadsheet]]'s advice, the spellcaster had been taking a concoction of ''[[healing potion]]s'' and [[sherry]] daily for nine months to help with his spells. However, Bugs noticed that the treatments stopped working, and he was afraid of increasing the dosage after witnessing the grim fate of Aunt [[Balmyre]]. He wrote a letter to the Bonecloak's Apothecary, asking for a new treatment or advice to deal with the returned spells."
