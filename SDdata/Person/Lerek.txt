'''Lerek''' was a member of  the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[Kryptgarden Forest]] in [[1489 DR]].

==History== 
Lerek was one of the cultists that dealt with [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[necromancer]] [[Zaralda]]. However, one day in 1489 DR, [[Athalee|a ghost elf]] who had escaped Zaralda's control attacked the cultists and the [[Thayan]]s. In fear, Lerek escaped just as the camp was assaulted by an adventuring party hired to defeat [[Claugiyliamatar]], helped by the [[archfey]] [[Witchthorn]]. Lerek was presumably spared by the adventurers and ran away.{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|40}}
