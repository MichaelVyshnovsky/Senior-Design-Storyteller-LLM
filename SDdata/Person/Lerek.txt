Lerek was a member of  the Cult of the Dragon in Kryptgarden Forest in 1489 DR.
Lerek was one of the cultists that dealt with Red Wizard of Thay necromancer Zaralda. However, one day in 1489 DR, a ghost elf who had escaped Zaraldas control attacked the cultists and the Thayans. In fear, Lerek escaped just as the camp was assaulted by an adventuring party hired to defeat Claugiyliamatar, helped by the archfey Witchthorn. Lerek was presumably spared by the adventurers and ran away.
