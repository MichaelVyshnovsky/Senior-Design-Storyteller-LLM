Nhar-del the Black was a necromancer agent of the Zhentarim in the Dalelands.
A pale man dressed in black, Nhar-del had blue eyes, a bald head, and a full brown goatee.
Nhar-del took great pleasure in slow and painful murder.
He wore a cursed ring of affliction (attuned to necromancy), and carried a wand of fear.
Nhar-del started out as a street urchin, but eventually became a necromancer in high regard among the Zhentarim. He was tricked into putting on a ring of affliction by a neglected lover.
