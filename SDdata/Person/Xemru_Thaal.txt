==History==
Sometime during the the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, or early the following year, Xemru deposited the tome titled ''[[The Canopic Being]]'' within the shelves of [[Candlekeep]], along with a hand-written note. Shortly thereafter he surrendered himself to the oracle of Tashluta, [[Valin Sarnaster]], helping her achieve immortality as a [[mummy lord]].
