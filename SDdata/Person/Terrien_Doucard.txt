Terrien Doucard was a half-elven soldier of the Knights in Silver who replaced Besnell as leader during the Battle of Keepers Dale.
Terrien had shining brown hair which shimmered even after the knight fought and killed on the battlefield.
The knight was fiercely faithful to Lady Alustrial, Besnell, and the rest of the Knights in Silver. In fact, he was in love with Alustriel but was wise enough not to act on those feelings.
Terriens father was an elf, a cousin of Besnell. His mother was the second daughter of one of Silverymoons wealthiest families.
In 1358 DR, Terrien followed Besnell and a hundred other Knights of Silver in the Battle of Keepers Dale where they combined forces with Berkthgars barbarians of Settlestone, the Longriders of Longsaddle, and a few Riders of Nesmé to defend Mithral Hall against the drow horde of Menzoberranzan. 
During the battle, Besnell fell to a goblin spear and Terrien replaced him as the leader of the knights. Later, Terrien led the dwarven high priestess Stumpet Rakingclaw to find the injured Lady Alustriel who had fallen during the battle.
