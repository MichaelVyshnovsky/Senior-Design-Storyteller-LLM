'''Terrien Doucard''' was a [[half-elf|half-elven]] soldier of the [[Knights in Silver]] who replaced [[Besnell]] as leader during the [[Battle of Keeper's Dale]].

==Description==
Terrien had shining brown hair which shimmered even after the knight fought and killed on the battlefield.

==Personality==
The knight was fiercely faithful to [[Alustriel|Lady Alustrial]], Besnell, and the rest of the Knights in Silver. In fact, he was in love with Alustriel but was wise enough not to act on those feelings.

==Relationships==
Terrien's father was an elf, a cousin of Besnell. His mother was the second daughter of one of Silverymoon's wealthiest families.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], Terrien followed Besnell and a hundred other Knights of Silver in the Battle of Keeper's Dale where they combined forces with [[Berkthgar|Berkthgar's]] [[barbarians]] of [[Settlestone]], the [[Longrider]]s of [[Longsaddle]], and a few [[Riders of Nesm√©]] to defend [[Mithral Hall]] against the [[drow]] horde of [[Menzoberranzan]].

During the battle, Besnell fell to a [[goblin]] [[spear]] and Terrien replaced him as the leader of the knights. Later, Terrien led the [[dwarven]] high priestess [[Stumpet Rakingclaw]] to find the injured Lady Alustriel who had fallen during the battle.
