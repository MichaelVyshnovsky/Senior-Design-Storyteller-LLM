        "mainbody": "Dragonborn\nUkthet was a dragonborn member of the Inquest, and one of the elders that once ruled over the Abeiran city of Xorvintroth. After their deaths, their consciousnesses were preserved by magical means, while aspects of their personas lingered in the Astral Plane as a spectral echoes.\nLike their fellow elders, Ukthet wore a set of robes with astral and arcane imagery embroidered upon it along with a large metallic medallion set upon a necklace.\nWhile in the Astral Plane, Ukthet and the other Inquest elders wore crowns of viridian crystals that protected them from detection from astral dreadnoughts.\nAt some point in life, Uthket died and their consciousness was transferred to a brain in a jar. While researching the forces of the Far Realm, the consciousnesses of the Inquest elders became trapped in the Astral Plane. The dragonborn arranged for their dead bodies and still-living brains to be transported elsewhere in their city. \nAfter some time the entity known as the Emissary of the Nine Eyes, showed them a green planet that would be an ideal new home for their people. The Inquest set to work on the bridge of stars, a means by which they could travel to that planet and be free from constant warfare.\nTheir work would remain incomplete however."
