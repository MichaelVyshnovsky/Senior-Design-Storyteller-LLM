Harkald Firesworn was a fire giant in the late 15 century DR who was one of the Burntbone Hordes leaders and helped its forces in occupying Sharpstone Keep.
He was young and ambitious, meaning he was willing to defy his clan for a chance at power&mdasheven a meager amount&mdashand stubbornly clung to that power once he attained it.
Harkald hailed from a clan in the North, but traveled south toward Waterdeep seeking power. He joined forces with the Burntbone Horde because he needed their help to capture Sharpstone Keep for his own. Following the defeat of his ally Vargor the Fierce, he broke from the Horde and declared himself King of Sharpstone Keep.
