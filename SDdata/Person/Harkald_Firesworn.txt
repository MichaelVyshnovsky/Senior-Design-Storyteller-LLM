'''Harkald Firesworn''' was a [[fire giant]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] who was one of the [[Burntbone Horde]]'s leaders and helped its forces in occupying [[Sharpstone Keep]].

==Personality==
He was young and ambitious, meaning he was willing to defy his clan for a chance at power&mdash;even a meager amount&mdash;and stubbornly clung to that power once he attained it.

==History==
Harkald hailed from a clan in [[the North]], but traveled south toward [[Waterdeep]] seeking power. He joined forces with the Burntbone Horde because he needed their help to capture Sharpstone Keep for his own. Following the defeat of his ally [[Vargor|Vargor the Fierce]], he broke from the Horde and declared himself King of Sharpstone Keep.
