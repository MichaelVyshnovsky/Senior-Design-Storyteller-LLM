        "mainbody": "The '''Hullack Hawk''' was a legendary figure in the history of [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]] around 1200 [[DR]]. The Hawk sacked and pillaged some Sembian merchant holdings and fled into [[Hullack Forest]]. The Hawk's actions precipitated an invasion of Cormyr by Sembia.",
        "Possessions": "From the raids specifically credited to the Hullack Hawk, it was estimated at the time that he extracted more than 300,000 [[gold piece]]s worth of coins and [[trade bar]]s. This fortune was presumably lost when he was forced to abandon it in the verges of the Hullack Forest after being wounded and hunted by [[Chanthar Huntsilver]].",
        "Activities": "The deeds attributed to the Hawk included the raiding of six warehouses and the sacking and burning of two estates outside of [[Daerlun]] in Sembia. The estates belonged to the [[Estcrar]] and [[Palindoemyn]] merchant-noble families.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "According to famed explorer and sometimes sensationalist historian [[Volothamp Geddarm]], [[Beldarm Truesilver]] was a good and fitting candidate for the true identity of the Hullack Hawk.{{Cite dragon/281/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 4|76-77}}\n\nBased on information found in the diaries of [[Auleethaea Cormaeril]]—a lady-in-waiting to Queen [[Alvandira]], often in the presence of King [[Pryntaler Obarskyr|Pryntaler]], and privy to much of the public and private activities of the royal family—and other court documents he was allowed to read, Volo believed that [[Donder Cormaeril]] and [[Althallan Crownsilver]] conspired to undermine Sembia and place the blame on the [[Eltrym Drauthglas|Lord of Hullack]]. (Hullack Forest was independent and resistant to Cormyrean expansion at the time.{{Cite dragon/281/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 4|76}}) To this end, they created the legend of the Hullack Hawk and aided, abetted, and advised him.\n\nThe incident that apparently caused the retirement of the Hawk and the loss of a fortune in coins was a chance encounter with Chanthar Huntsilver who believed the Hullack Hawk was at least a bandit and possibly a rebel. He called upon Donder and Althallan to assist him in \"hunting down the Hawk,\" and they agreed, but conspired to lead the hunting party away from the Hawk's hiding place, allowing him to escape with his life but not his treasure, which was never found."
