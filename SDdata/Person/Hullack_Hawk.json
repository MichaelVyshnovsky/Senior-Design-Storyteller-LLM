        "mainbody": "The Hullack Hawk was a legendary figure in the history of Cormyr and Sembia around 1200 DR. The Hawk sacked and pillaged some Sembian merchant holdings and fled into Hullack Forest. The Hawks actions precipitated an invasion of Cormyr by Sembia.\nFrom the raids specifically credited to the Hullack Hawk, it was estimated at the time that he extracted more than 300,000 gold pieces worth of coins and trade bars. This fortune was presumably lost when he was forced to abandon it in the verges of the Hullack Forest after being wounded and hunted by Chanthar Huntsilver.\nThe deeds attributed to the Hawk included the raiding of six warehouses and the sacking and burning of two estates outside of Daerlun in Sembia. The estates belonged to the Estcrar and Palindoemyn merchant-noble families.\nAccording to famed explorer and sometimes sensationalist historian Volothamp Geddarm, Beldarm Truesilver was a good and fitting candidate for the true identity of the Hullack Hawk.\nBased on information found in the diaries of Auleethaea Cormaeril—a lady-in-waiting to Queen Alvandira, often in the presence of King Pryntaler, and privy to much of the public and private activities of the royal family—and other court documents he was allowed to read, Volo believed that Donder Cormaeril and Althallan Crownsilver conspired to undermine Sembia and place the blame on the Lord of Hullack. (Hullack Forest was independent and resistant to Cormyrean expansion at the time.) To this end, they created the legend of the Hullack Hawk and aided, abetted, and advised him.\nThe incident that apparently caused the retirement of the Hawk and the loss of a fortune in coins was a chance encounter with Chanthar Huntsilver who believed the Hullack Hawk was at least a bandit and possibly a rebel. He called upon Donder and Althallan to assist him in \"hunting down the Hawk,\" and they agreed, but conspired to lead the hunting party away from the Hawks hiding place, allowing him to escape with his life but not his treasure, which was never found."
