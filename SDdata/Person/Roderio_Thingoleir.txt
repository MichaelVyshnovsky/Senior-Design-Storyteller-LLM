Roderio Thingoleir was a wizard and alchemist who lived at Fourstaves House in Yhaunn.
Roderio was a quiet and thoughtful man, inclined towards research and analysis rather than flashy spells.
Like the rest of his family, he used a staff to cast his spells. In addition to being a proficient wizard, he had a special passion for alchemy. He spent much of his time experimenting with alchemical preparations in his workshop at home.
His familiar was a brightly-striped green and blue lizard that lived in a warm terrarium.
Roderio was the son of Strasus Thingoleir and Dagnalla Irongard, and the middle sibling of Malia and Keph.
He got along extremely poorly with his younger brother Keph, and they often sparred with each other verbally.
He grew up in Yhaunn at Fourstaves House and apprenticed under his parents to learn magic, becoming the titular fourth stave.
In Eleasis of 1373 DR, he participated in his familys study of The Leaves of One Night.
The same month, Keph sabotaged his alchemical workshop with magesbane dust, greatly underestimating its power.
Thanks to the treatment he received, within a few days his skin had healed, and within a tenday he was able to see again.
He later helped his family defend the Stiltways from a pack of shadow mastiffs summoned by Variance Amatick.
