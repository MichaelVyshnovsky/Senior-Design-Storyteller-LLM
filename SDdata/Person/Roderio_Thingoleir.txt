'''Roderio Thingoleir''' was a [[wizard]] and [[alchemist]] who lived at [[Fourstaves House]] in [[Yhaunn]].

==Personality==
Roderio was a quiet and thoughtful man, inclined towards research and analysis rather than flashy spells.

==Abilities==
Like the rest of his family, he used a staff to cast his spells. In addition to being a proficient wizard, he had a special passion for alchemy. He spent much of his time experimenting with alchemical preparations in his workshop at home.

His familiar was a brightly-striped green and blue [[lizard]] that lived in a warm terrarium.

==Relationships==
Roderio was the son of [[Strasus Thingoleir]] and [[Dagnalla Irongard]], and the middle sibling of [[Malia Thingoleir|Malia]] and [[Keph Thingoleir|Keph]].

He got along extremely poorly with his younger brother Keph, and they often sparred with each other verbally.

==History==
He grew up in Yhaunn at Fourstaves House and apprenticed under his parents to learn magic, becoming the titular fourth stave.

In [[Eleasis]] of [[1373 DR]], he participated in his family's study of ''[[The Leaves of One Night]]''.

The same month, Keph sabotaged his alchemical workshop with ''[[magesbane dust]]'', greatly underestimating its power.

Thanks to the treatment he received, within a few days his skin had healed, and within a tenday he was able to see again.

He later helped his family defend the [[Stiltways]] from a pack of [[shadow mastiff]]s summoned by [[Variance Amatick]].
