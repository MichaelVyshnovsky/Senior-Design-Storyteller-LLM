'''Auglaer''' was an inhabitant of [[Wright's Ferry]] in [[Featherdale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.

==Activities==
Auglaer worked at [[Albottle Ferry]] with his cousins [[Flender Albottle|Flender]] and [[Dregon Albottle]]. Given his immense size, he served as muscle when needed if customers complained about the ferry rates. Auglaer was so large that many believed he had [[ogre]] blood.
