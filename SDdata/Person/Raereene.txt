Raereene was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
Raereene was gorgeous, with midnight-blue hair and large, dark eyes.
She was used to being the focus of mens attractions, and not impressed by it.
Raereene could teleport other people under her own power, at least the distance between Castle Obarskyr and Stormserpent Towers, both in Suzail.
Raereene had access to a highly destructive scepter of sorts, capable of blasting a beholder into smithereens it was almost certainly a blast scepter of sorts.
She was a War Wizard, working out of Castle Obarskyr.
Raereene had an tryst with a young palace server, Kreane the two employed the Room of the Fire Wyrm for amorous activities while in Castle Obarskyr. In time for the Council of the Dragon, Raereene had become an ally of the late Alusair Obarskyr and Elminster Aumar.
Arclath Delcastle bumped into Raereene when he was seeking Glathra Barcantles office at Castle Obarskyr in the lead to the Council of the Dragon of . Later, when Raereene was enjoying a tryst with Kreane at the Room of the Fire Wyrm, she was briefly spied upon by Alusair Obarskyr and Elminster Aumar, who were in a secret passage with peepholes into the room.
Later, Alusair sought her out when needing to teleport Elminster into Stormserpent Towers she was not initially inclined to help, but Vangerdahasts vestige then tried to convince her, and Raereene agreed to do it. Raereene also later annihilated one of the vampire Manshoons mind-controlled bodies, that of a beholder, when it was attacking Arclath and the dancer Amarune Whitewave in the palace. She continued to help Alusair and Elminsters schemes afterwards, being noted as the one vigilant person by Storm Silverhand.
