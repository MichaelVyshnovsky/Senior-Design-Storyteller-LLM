'''Raereene''' was a [[War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Raereene was gorgeous, with midnight-blue hair and large, dark eyes.

==Personality==
She was used to being the focus of men's attractions, and not impressed by it.

==Abilities==
Raereene could ''[[teleport]]'' other people under her own power, at least the distance between [[Castle Obarskyr]] and [[Stormserpent Towers]], both in [[Suzail]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|370-371|35}}

==Possessions==
Raereene had access to a highly destructive [[scepter]] of sorts, capable of blasting a [[beholder]] into smithereens; it was almost certainly a ''[[blast scepter]]'' of sorts.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|377-378|36}}

==Activities==
She was a [[War Wizard]], working out of [[Castle Obarskyr]].

==Relationships==
Raereene had an tryst with a young palace server, [[Kreane]]; the two employed the [[Room of the Fire Wyrm]] for amorous activities while in Castle Obarskyr.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|358|34}} In time for the [[Council of the Dragon]], Raereene had become an ally of the late [[Alusair Obarskyr]] and [[Elminster Aumar]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|383|36}}

==History==
[[Arclath Delcastle]] bumped into [[Raereene]] when he was seeking [[Glathra Barcantle]]'s office at [[Castle Obarskyr]] in the lead to the [[Council of the Dragon]] of {{yearlink|1479}}. Later, when Raereene was enjoying a tryst with Kreane at the Room of the Fire Wyrm, she was briefly spied upon by Alusair Obarskyr and Elminster Aumar, who were in a secret passage with peepholes into the room.

Later, Alusair sought her out when needing to ''teleport'' Elminster into Stormserpent Towers; she was not initially inclined to help, but [[Vangerdahast]]'s vestige then tried to convince her, and Raereene agreed to do it. Raereene also later annihilated one of the [[vampire]] [[Manshoon]]'s mind-controlled bodies, that of a beholder, when it was attacking [[Arclath]] and the dancer [[Amarune Whitewave]] in the palace. She continued to help Alusair and Elminster's schemes afterwards, being noted as the one vigilant person by [[Storm Silverhand]].
