Shermata Cheng was a priestess of Tymora in the Fortune Hall temple in Silverymoon in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Circa 1372 DR, Shermata was exploring an ancient temple and tomb complex deep within the northern Moonwood alongside a group of adventurers. Within the temple she and two members of the adventuring group were ambushed and killed by gnolls living within it. Those within her community mourned her passing for a tenday period before her position in the temple was replaced by Aratha Sul.
