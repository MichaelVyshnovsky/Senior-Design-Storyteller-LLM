'''Shermata Cheng''' was a [[priest]]ess of [[Tymora]] in the [[Fortune Hall]] temple in [[Silverymoon]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], Shermata was exploring an ancient temple and tomb complex deep within the northern [[Moonwood]] alongside a group of [[adventurer]]s. Within the temple she and two members of the adventuring group were ambushed and killed by [[gnoll]]s living within it. Those within her community mourned her passing for a [[tenday]] period before her position in the temple was replaced by [[Aratha Sul]].
