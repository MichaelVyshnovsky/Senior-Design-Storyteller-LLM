        "mainbody": "'''Marod el Arhapan''' was the [[Syl-pasha|Pasha]] of [[Calimport]] in [[1479 DR]].  His favorite pastime was staging [[gladiator|gladiatorial]] games in his arena, an activity he preferred to actually ruling Calimport.  The Pasha had a lavish floating palace that floated high above the arena.",
        "History": "Marod married an [[Earthsoul genasi]] named Valandra who had manifested as an Airsoul.  She bore him a son whom they named [[Cephas]].  Valandra later angered Marod and he tricked his champion gladiator ([[Azad the Free|Azad]]) into killing her in the arena.  Azad later escaped Calimport with Cephas.  [[Corvus Nightfeather]] discovered Cephas' location and rescued him from Azad.  He sent word to both Marod and the [[archmage]] [[Acham el Jhotos|el Jhotos]] that he had discovered the long lost heir of Calimport.  Marod's vizar [[Shahrokh]] sent a troop of elite [[minotaur]] warriors to capture Cephas but they were defeated by Corvus and his allies.  Later, Cephas and his friends were travelling through the [[Calim Desert]] when they were captured by Shahrokh and taken to Calimport.  Marod reunited with Cephas and gave him a suite of rooms at the palace.  Later, Cephas easily killed Marod and destroyed his palace and the arena.",
