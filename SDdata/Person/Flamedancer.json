        "mainbody": "'''Flamedancer''' was a name used by a [[tshala]] that dwelt in the [[Flaming Brazier]] temple in [[Bezantur]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and worked to undermine the [[Church of Kossuth]] from within.",
        "Description": "It appeared as a [[fey]] of living [[fire]]. It was capable of casting several very powerful [[spell]]s.",
        "Personality": "Flamedancer was motivated by a desire for revenge. Unlike most tshala, this motivation stopped it from becoming distracted from its mission of infiltrating the Flaming Brazier.",
        "Relationships": "Flamedancer was a member of the [[Harper]]s, and was considered to be one of the most unusual Harpers in all of [[Faer√ªn]]. It was one of only two active Harper spies in Bezantur as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the other being [[Ruvya]].\n\nThe high priest of the Flaming Brazier, [[Eternal Flame]] [[Mythalanir]], regarded Flamedancer's presence in his temple as a sign of [[Kossuth]]'s favor, and treated it as an honored resident. While Flamedancer was not the only [[firetail]] to visit the Flaming Brazier, it was the only one that chose to stay for any length of time. However, the tshala in truth held a deep grudge against that [[god]] and his [[Thay]]an followers.",
        "History": "Flameedancer considered the [[Yuirwood]] to be its ancestral home, where it had long been a companion to the [[seelie]] fey. It was favored among these [[sprite]]s despite being a dangerous creature of fire because it helped to control old growth and to renew the forest with carefully managed wildfires. Prior to the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR, Flamedancer had also made the acquaintance of [[Galvin]] of [[Aglarond]], a member of the Harpers with experience fighting against Thay.\n\nDuring the [[Salamander War]] of the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, [[fire elemental]]s allied with Thay burned much of Flamedancer's home and killed its seelie companions. The tshala swore revenge, and so contacted Galvin for aid. Galvin and the Harpers suggested that it infiltrate the Flaming Brazier in order to spy on the Kossuthans and the [[Red Wizards]], reasoning that it could do so without arousing much suspicion. To their surprise, it not only agreed to settle in as an occupant of the temple, but it continued to work as their spy for over a decade. By {{Yearlink|1370}}, Flamedancer had successfully freed several [[slave]]s and its reports back to the Harpers had contributed to the thwarting of more than one Red Wizard scheme."
