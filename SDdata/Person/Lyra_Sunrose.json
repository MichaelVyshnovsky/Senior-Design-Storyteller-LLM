        "mainbody": "yra Sunrose (also known as \"Little Miss Lemon\") was a female half-elf ranger who lived in the forest of Cormanthor in the 14 century DR.\nShe was born and raised by her mother in the village of Alyssim, after her human father was sentenced to a decade of hard labor for procreating with an elf (frowned upon in Alyssim). Lyra did not consider herself accepted in Alyssim and this, combined with her annoyance at the villagers for her perceived mistreatment, caused her to leave for a life in the forest, choosing animal companionship over her own kind. Although it is not certain at what age Lyra began her solitary life, she said it was \"as soon as I was old enough to lace my own boots\".\nLater, Lyra met Ruke Diggot, a human explorer, in the forest, and the couple married a few months later, producing eleven children, all of whom lived in Cormanthor until Rukes death. For about a decade after this, she spent her time collecting information on the ecology of the forest.\nLyra chose to worship what her mother referred to as \"the Hexad\" of Rillifane Rallathil, Chauntea, Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, and Aerdrie Faenya as this was the same choice as her mother, despite being against Alyssims customary single-deity worship of Rillifane Rallathil.\nMisha was Lyras female wolf companion. Although it is not known when the creature was born or died, or how long she accompanied Lyra, she was still a cub in 1323 DR.\nLyra met Elminster around 1327 DR (whom she referred affectionately as \"El\") when he was bathing naked in the Elvenflow and the two became acquainted. Elminster took to calling her \"Little Miss Lemon\" in recognition of her sour character.\nAt Elminsters request, around 1367 DR, Lyra used her accumulated knowledge of the forest to write the \"Cormanthor\" book that formed part of Elminsters Ecologies."
