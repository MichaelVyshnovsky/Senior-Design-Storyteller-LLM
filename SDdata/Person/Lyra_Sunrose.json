        "mainbody": "'''Lyra Sunrose''' (also known as \"Little Miss Lemon\") was a female [[half-elf]] [[ranger]] who lived in the forest of [[Cormanthor]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "She was born and raised by her mother in the village of [[Alyssim]], after her [[human]] father was sentenced to a decade of hard labor for procreating with an [[elf]] (frowned upon in Alyssim). Lyra did not consider herself accepted in Alyssim and this, combined with her annoyance at the villagers for her perceived mistreatment, caused her to leave for a life in the forest, choosing animal companionship over her own kind. Although it is not certain at what age Lyra began her solitary life, she said it was \"as soon as I was old enough to lace my own boots\".\n\nLater, Lyra met [[Ruke Diggot]], a human explorer, in the forest, and the couple married a few months later, producing eleven children, all of whom lived in Cormanthor until Ruke's death. For about a decade after this, she spent her time collecting information on the ecology of the forest.",
        "Personality": "Lyra chose to worship what her mother referred to as \"[[the Hexad]]\" of [[Rillifane Rallathil]], [[Chauntea]], [[Silvanus]], [[Mielikki]], [[Eldath]], and [[Aerdrie Faenya]] as this was the same choice as her mother, despite being against Alyssim's customary single-deity worship of Rillifane Rallathil.",
        "Relationships": "[[Misha (wolf)|Misha]] was Lyra's female [[wolf]] companion. Although it is not known when the creature was born or died, or how long she accompanied Lyra, she was still a cub in [[1323 DR]].\n\nLyra met [[Elminster]] around [[1327 DR]] (whom she referred affectionately as \"El\") when he was bathing naked in the [[Elvenflow]] and the two became acquainted. Elminster took to calling her \"Little Miss Lemon\" in recognition of her sour character.",
        "Works": "At Elminster's request, around [[1367 DR]], Lyra used her accumulated knowledge of the forest to write the \"Cormanthor\" book that formed part of ''[[Elminster's Ecologies]]''."
