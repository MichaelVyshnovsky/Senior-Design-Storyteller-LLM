        "mainbody": "olem Grandelwood was an adventurer from Baldurs Gate, active midâ€“14 century DR.\nTolem owned a masterfully-crafted sword forged and triple-enchanted by the legendary Master Smith Gerzan of Delzoun.\nColvin Rowander was a part of Tolems adventuring party in 1370 DR.\nIn 1370 DR, Tolem could be found in the Yawning Portal of Waterdeep, making wagers against reckless fellow adventurers entering the Undermountain. He offered bets of 100 gp that the individual was to perish before reaching the mega dungeons second level. Upon their death, he would collect gold off the losers next of kin. This source of income was semi-successful as not all adventurers that accepted the wager lost it. Tolem Grandelwood made the same bet with the lone hero sent to investigate the recent kobold activity by Khelben Arunsun.\nAt one point of his adventures in Undermountain, Tolem was able to infiltrate the Tomb of Ankh-Kephra, survive its perilous traps, find a hidden treasure vault, and replaced the booty with a scroll proclaiming himself being there first."
