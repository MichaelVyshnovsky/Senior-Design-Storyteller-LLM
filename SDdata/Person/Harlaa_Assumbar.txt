Lady Harlaa Assumbar was a priest in service to Siamorphe, the Divine Light, within the Chapel and Chalice of the Divine Right in Waterdeep during the late 14 century DR.
Her famous good looks drew many young noblemen to attend services within the Chapel since she proclaimed that she would not marry anyone who was not fully devoted to Siamorphe.
Lady Harlaa was one of three senior priests who oversaw the activities of the lesser priests and acolytes within the Chapel.
She was the daughter of Lord Laeros and Lady Kerri. Harlaa was also the niece of First High Lady Scion of Siamorphe Belkerri Gulderhorn who headed the Chapel and Chalice of the Divine Right.
