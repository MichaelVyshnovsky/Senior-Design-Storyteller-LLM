'''Ominifis Hereward "Omin" Dran''' was a [[half-elf]] [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[cleric]] of [[Tymora]], and the founder of the adventuring company [[Acquisitions Incorporated]].

==Personality==
Omin was regarded as a ruthless businessman, but rather inept concerning relationships and games of chance.

==Relationships==
Omin had a long-standing business relation with the [[wizard]] [[Jim Darkmagic]], an employee at Acquisitions Incorporated, as well as long-time interns [[Viari]] and [[Môrgæn]].

==History==
Omin and his two sisters [[Portentia Dran|Portentia]] and [[Auspicia Dran|Auspicia]] grew up in [[Red Larch]], raised by their mother, the [[elf|elven]] [[paladin]] of Tymora [[Prophetess Dran]]. The siblings enjoyed forays into the neighboring mountains, until one day Auspicia went missing after an encounter with the [[Wandering Crypt]].

As part of his efforts to reunite with his missing sister, Omin founded Acquisitions Incorporated, an adventuring company for hire whose franchises spread throughout the [[Sword Coast]] and even into other worlds such as [[Ravnica]].

Omin was awarded the title of Masked Lord of Waterdeep and invited to participate in the city's secret council meetings. He was one of [[Laeral Silverhand]]'s supporters.

In [[1491 DR]], after the assassinations of the Masked Lords [[Oszbur Malankar]], [[Dathanscza Meiril]], and [[Ammasker Gwelt]], Omin nevertheless felt safe enough that he did not seek to hire bodyguards like his fellow Masked Lord, [[Landarmyn Voskur]]. Voskur wanted to hire Omin's adventurers for his own protection.
