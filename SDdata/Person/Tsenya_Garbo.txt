He disliked magic-users who caused harm to others.

==Activities==

==Abilities==
As an advanced [[cleric]] and [[monk]], Tsenya knew a wide variety of [[spell]]s. He was well-trained in the martial arts. Tsenya could focus his ki into powers including resisting magic, preventing himself from getting hurt if falling from great distances, and even reading minds.

[[Tsenya Bhrokiti]] was the daughter of the Dalai Lama.
