Tsenya Garbo was the Holy Leader of Ra-Khati, also called the Dalai Lama, during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Though he was well over one hundred years old, Tsenya appeared to be in his 50s.
Tsenya was a good-hearted, fearless man who placed Ra-Khatis safety above all else. This also made him a bit shortsighted.
He disliked magic-users who caused harm to others.
Tsenya Garbo served as the Dalai Lama for over a century, acting as Ra-Khatis ruler and spiritual guide.
As an advanced cleric and monk, Tsenya knew a wide variety of spells. He was well-trained in the martial arts. Tsenya could focus his ki into powers including resisting magic, preventing himself from getting hurt if falling from great distances, and even reading minds.
Tsenya Bhrokiti was the daughter of the Dalai Lama.
