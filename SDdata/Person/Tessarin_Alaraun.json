        "mainbody": "'''Tessarin \"Longtresses\" Alaraun''' was the witty and beautiful First Speaker of the council and ruler of the beleaguered town of [[Nesmé]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Among other things, she was renowned for her collection of magical items.",
        "History": "Before the invasion of the [[Evermoors]] by the [[troll]]s she was a member of, but not leader of, the town council. Meetings often descended into heated arguments with the former First Speaker, [[Jygil Zelnathra]], a [[cleric]] of [[Waukeen]], about the role of religion in government.\n\nWhen Waukeen was captured by [[Graz'zt]] just after the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], Jygil was weakened so much that Tessarin took over as First Speaker. She seized Nesmé by force in order to save it from being ruled by corrupt priests of Waukeen. Tessarin enlisted groups of local barbarians to help overthrow the tyrannous priests. Although she successfully seized control, the barbaric warriors roamed Nesmé and some of them were difficult to control. During Tessarin's leadership, she turned Nesmé into a [[magocracy]] and eventually took Jygil as her apprentice in the ways of [[the Art]]. She planned for Nesmé to rival the city of [[Silverymoon]] and to join the [[Lords' Alliance]].\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], Nesmé was under threat from trolls and [[giant]]s, and Tessarin recruited help from the [[Riders of Nesmé]], a group of [[Uthgardt]] barbarians, and a [[lizardfolk]] tribe called the [[Khoroshen]].{{Cite dungeon/144/The Muster of Morach Tor|17}}"
