        "mainbody": "'''Jaris''' was a wealthy man who came into ownership of one of the buildings within the [[Crossroad Keep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''You have the look of someone not afraid to deal with a little alchemy. What do you say? Fix this for me, and you'll be well rewarded.''|Jaris}}",
        "Description": "Jaris was a pale-skinned [[human]] man with bright blonde slicked-back hair. His demeanor, clothes, and appearance all loudly advertised his wealth and complete lack of any hardships in his life.",
        "History": "Shortly after the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Jaris inherited a home in the Crossroad Keep on the [[Sword Coast North]]. The building was an alchemical laboratory that once belonged to Jaris's uncle. Shortly after the Crossroad Keep welcomed the Mercantile House led by [[Sa'Sani]] of [[Samarach]], Jaris arrived at the keep but found the laboratory a mess. His uncle hoarded dangerous and volatile substances and chemicals that could easily damage the property if handled by someone unlearned. He attempted to hire a group of adventurers to handle the situation, but it was unrecorded how much damage, if any, they dealt to the alchemist's home in the process."
