Larando in particular was a friend of his, and they may have been in the same party to start with.\nIn the , Ardelnar Trethran was part of an alliance of three parties that adventured together into Myth Drannor, with a total of seven wizards, two of them archwizards. ut, despite the team-up, they still found themselves slaughtered by baatezu. Before being forced to flee for their lives, Ardelnar had pried a double handful of gems from the chest of a mummified elven corpse. Ardelnar escaped with Larando and Klargathan. After Larando was slain, Ardelnar and Klargathan ran on.\nEventually, Klargathan called on Ardelnar to help him make a stand though the two of them fought furiously, they were ultimately ambushed by more of the endless hordes of baatezu just as they reached a clearing with a fallen duskwood, close to Halidaes Height."
