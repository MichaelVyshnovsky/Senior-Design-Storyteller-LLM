        "History": "In the {{yearlink|760}}, Ardelnar Trethran was part of an alliance of three parties that adventured together into [[Myth Drannor]], with a total of seven wizards, two of them archwizards. ut, despite the team-up, they still found themselves slaughtered by [[baatezu]]. Before being forced to flee for their lives, Ardelnar had pried a double handful of [[gem]]s from the chest of a mummified [[elf|elven]] corpse. Ardelnar escaped with Larando and Klargathan. After Larando was slain, Ardelnar and Klargathan ran on.\n\nEventually, Klargathan called on Ardelnar to help him make a stand; though the two of them fought furiously, they were ultimately ambushed by more of the endless hordes of baatezu just as they reached a clearing with a fallen [[duskwood]], close to [[Halidae's Height]]."
