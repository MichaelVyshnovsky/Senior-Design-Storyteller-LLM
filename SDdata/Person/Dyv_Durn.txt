'''Dyv Durn''' was an elderly [[human]] [[Lathanderian]] [[priest]]{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|8}} and ship captain in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who died while on an expedition in the [[Shining Sea]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|20}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|21}} sometime around the month of [[Flamerule]], a group of eccentric entertainers, entrepreneurs, and scientists embarked upon a colonizing expedition to an island they discovered in the Shining Sea off the coast of [[Chult]], which they dubbed the "[[Forgotten Island]]". Led by a charismatic [[Waukeenar]] priest named [[Devlin (Ravens Bluff)|Devlin]], they sought to create a tourist attraction on the isle that would attract wealthy people from all across the Realms.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2,4}} Among this eccentric group, Dyv Durn was the captain of one of its ships, ''[[The Bright Sunrise]]''.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2}}

Sometime around the last [[tenday]] of [[Eleint]], Dyv Durn spoke with [[Baerwald]], a [[druid]] who had been trying to convince the group to abandon their plans. Durn would later tell Devlin about this encounter on [[Marpenoth 9]], revealing that the druid claimed to be a [[Hierophant]] and a druid of the nature god [[Silvanus]]. On [[Marpenoth 12]], a day after five [[velociraptor]]s attacked their [[Devlin's campsite|campsite's]] messhall and injured the [[fighter]] [[Mallus]], Devlin began to worry that somehow the relic they brought to make the local wildlife docile had been tampered with and so ordered Dyv Durn to prepare ''The Bright Sunrise'' for sailing. However, Durn would not get the opportunity to do so as the Forgotten Island was struck by storms for two days, trapping him and the rest of the crew inside the camp.

When the storms let up on [[Marpenoth 16]] the camp headed to their docks, discovering that both it and their ships were destroyed, thus stranding them all on the island.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|22}} Though the group would not discover that their destruction was caused by aquatic [[dinosaur]]s infected by [[olive slime]]s.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|6}} Dyv Durn was frantic to investigate the wreckage of ''The Bright Sunrise'' and had to be held back by the rest of the group. Over the course of the next three days, Dyv Durn and the rest of the group would become infected with olive slimes due to close proximity with Mallus, who had contracted an infection from the velociraptors.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|7}}

On the night of the third day, [[Marpenoth 19]], Devlin snuck into the barracks and murdered everyone inside.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|22}}

Two days later, [[Marpenoth 22]], a group of [[adventurer]]s arrived to the island in search of expedition member [[Briella Farthing]] and investigated the ruined campsite. There they discovered the corpse of Dyv Durn, badly burned and wearing his [[holy symbol]], still lying within the ruins of the camp's barracks.
