'''Rolivar Brimbruir''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Chauntea]] with the rank of Trueseed that resided in the [[Bounty of the Goddess (Voonlar)|Bounty of the Goddess]] temple in [[Voonlar]].
__NOTOC__
==Description==
Rolivar was a burly man with bushy brown hair that was mostly concentrated on the sides of his face and mustache as he slowly went bald. He periodically shaved off his mustache, every few months or so.

==Personality==
He was loud and boisterous, friendly to everyone, and loved to laugh. He told jokes that made even the most dour [[Cyric]]ists in town chuckle.

==Abilities==
Rolivar was an accomplished brewmaster, specializing in [[beer]] made from [[barley]].

==Activities==
In addition to his temple duties and brewing, he was a courier for Mother of the Harvest, Lady [[Immithra Shrae|Shrae]], occasionally shuttling correspondence between her and High Harvestmistress [[Glamerie Windbough]] of the [[House of Plenty]] in [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]]. On these trips he was usually accompanied by about eight temple guards, all mounted and heavily cloaked (possibly from [[scrying]]). As a precaution, they checked in with Bron [[Buorstag Hlammythyl]] or his deputies to ensure no mistakes were made about their right to travel to and from Shadowdale.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 9: Voonlarran Religious Politics}}

==Relationships==
Rolivar was a popular guy because of his beer and sense of humor. Even the clergy of Cyric got along with him.
