'''Rhylfang''' was a [[gargantuan spider|gargantuan]], [[Fiendish creature|demonic]] [[spider]] said to be a spawn of [[Lolth]].

==Abilities==
Due to the fiendish [[magic]] infused within them, the webs spun by Rhylfang were too sturdy to be cut through or burned away by means of [[fire]] or [[acid]]. Rhylfang was also capable of spawning spiders of many different species, such as [[giant spider]]s and [[phase spider]]s.

==History==
Some centuries prior to the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Rhylfang was trapped deep within a keep in the bogs of the [[Evermoors]]. She laid dormant there for so long that she had become a mere myth among the [[elves]] that still knew of her.

In [[1490 DR]], [[Tasyllys Ch'fyr]] and his group of [[drow]] cultists entered that keep in hopes of gaining access to its fabled [[portal]] to the [[Forlorn Cliffs]]. In the process they awakened Rhylfang from its ancient slumber, who went on to spawn dozens of spiders that went out and terrorized the surrounding land of the Evermoors.

Soon after a group of [[adventurer]]s tracking down Tasyllys were tasked by a woman named [[Andra]] with gathering ingredients necessary to brew an acid strong enough to melt through the webs encasing its keep. Afterwards they discovered that she was a [[Ghaunadaur]] worshiper seeking to put an end to Rhylfang herself. After defeating both her and many of Tasyllys's cultists, the adventurers confronted Rhylfang and put an end to her.
