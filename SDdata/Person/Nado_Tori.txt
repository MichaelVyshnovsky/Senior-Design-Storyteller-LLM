Nado Tori was a samurai ronin in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Nado lived at the Shrine of the Spring, despite being a follower of the Konjo school. He had helped to protect the shrine in the past. Nado helped the local sohei commander in the training of his men. He had attracted the attentions of the spirit protector of the shrine, who fell in love with him for his devotion.
Nado still honored the memory of his lord, not wanting to enter into the service of a new one. He was attracted to the beautiful woman he sometimes met in the shrine, but did not yet understand her true spirit nature.
