        "mainbody": "Malaerigo Harsard was the guildmaster of the Cellarers & Plumbers Guild of Waterdeep in 1479 DR.\nMalaerigo had unkempt black hair and a line of moles down his right cheek. He was a cheapskate, so he never wore expensive or fine clothes.\nAs guildmaster of the Cellarers & Plumbers Guild, Malaerigo kept detailed maps of every tunnel and entrance shaft in the sewers of Waterdeep that he knew of. He also noted on these maps who owned the properties above some of these sewer shafts. His daughter often made copies of these maps whenever she needed to go traverse the sewers herself.\nMalaerigo had a daughter, Laraelra Harsard. She argued with him over key issues and he disapproved somewhat of her sorcery."
