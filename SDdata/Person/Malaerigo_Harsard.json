        "Description": "Malaerigo had unkempt black hair and a line of moles down his right cheek. He was a cheapskate, so he never wore expensive or fine clothes.",
        "Possessions": "As guildmaster of the Cellarers' & Plumbers' Guild, Malaerigo kept detailed [[map]]s of every tunnel and entrance shaft in the [[sewers of Waterdeep]] that he knew of. He also noted on these maps who owned the properties above some of these sewer shafts. His daughter often made copies of these maps whenever she needed to go traverse the sewers herself.",
        "Relationships": "Malaerigo had a daughter, [[Laraelra Harsard]]. She argued with him over key issues and he disapproved somewhat of her sorcery."
