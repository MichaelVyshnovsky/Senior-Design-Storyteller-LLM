        "mainbody": "Gustaf Stellern, nicknamed Falcon the Hunter, was the owner of a hunting lodge in Neverwinter Wood during the late 15th century DR. He catered to nobles from Neverwinter who were looking for a break from city life.\nFalcon was  tall. He had broad shoulders and cold blue eyes. His hair was black and he sported a neatly trimmed beard. Falcon wore a fur-lined cloak over his studded leather armor.\nFalcon showed no fear and appeared confident and casual even in difficult situations. He preferred living on the periphery of civilization to overcrowded city life. Falcon was a wine connoisseur and treated other people fairly and patiently. However, he had a deep hatred for orcs. He detested them so much that he hung the heads of killed orcs as trophies in his hunting lodge.\nThrough his many years in Neverwinter Wood, Falcon became a survival expert and a skilled hunter and fighter. As an archer, he excelled with his longbow but was also proficient with the longsword. These skills earned him his nickname Falcon the Hunter.\nFalcon owned a pair of boots of elvenkind. His riding horse, a reliable gray stallion, was called Baatorius.\nHe had his own flag symbol a black banner with a silver falcon insignia.\nIn his youth, Falcon fought in many wars, but retired to be a hunter and later proprietor of his lodge in Neverwinter Wood.\nFollowing the appearance of the white dragon Cryovain in the region, Falcon noticed an alliance of orcs from the south and a half-orc cult of Talos that gathered in the Woodland Manse not far from his hunting lodge. He hired some adventurers to make a preemptive strike against them. In retaliation, a band of twenty orcs attacked Falcons hunting lodge. The anchorites of Talos also conjured Gorthok the Thunder Boar to aid the attack."
