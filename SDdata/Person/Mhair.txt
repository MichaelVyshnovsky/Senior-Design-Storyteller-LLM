'''Mhair''' was a [[human]] [[fighter]] who worked as a boatman at the [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]], [[Cormyr]], in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.
{{Quote|What are ya, stupid? Yeah, this is where the petitioners stay. They gotta stay somewhere don't they? Moron.
|Mhair to those questioning him, 1374 DR}}

==History==
By [[Eleint]] of 1374 DR, Mhair was working at the temple, having a key role in transporting kidnapped petitioners and followers of [[Mystra]] out of the city.

Eventually, on [[Eleint 6]], an adventuring party recruited by [[Tunaster Dranik]] to investigate the temple discovered the truth, that it was a front for the [[church of Shar]]. <ref group="note">Mhair's canon fate is unknown, but the module states that, if the fight goes against him, he will try to dive into the river under the temple and swim away.

==Activities==
Acting under the orders of Lady [[Naedaenya Arthas]], Mhair's role at the temple was to smuggle the abducted, mentally [[dominate person|dominated]] petitioners out of the temple and out of the city. Once a month, during the night, he loaded the captives onto a special catamaran and rowed them out through a river-cave beneath the temple, through a concealed entrance, and out into the [[Wyvernflow]] river. When the coast was clear, he pilot the catamaran across the river and deposited them on the opposite riverbank. There, he gave them a map and told them to journey to the [[Lost Refuge]] in the [[Vast Swamp]], and there meet with Starweaver [[Bestra Mornscroll]], whom they were to obey. He also told them to act normally otherwise. He also sometimes took the opportunity to rob the mind-controlled victims, against orders.

He drew his maps based on a map of southeastern Cormyr, one happened to depict the little-known locations of the [[Lost Refuge]] and the [[Orvaskyte Keep]] in the [[Vast Swamp]]. Mhair was able to add some new locations, though he only guessed at the location of the [[Monastery of the Ebon Dome]], with the Sharrans neglecting to correct him.

He spent much of his spare time working on his [[kayak]].

==Description==
Mhair had blue eyes and blond hair.

==Personality==
{{Quote|Don't bother me, freak.
|Mhair}}

Mhair has a sharp tongue, quick to insult folk he talked to.

Although he knew he served false priests, he didn't know who they really worshiped, nor did he seem to care.

==Abilities==
Mhair was a tough and very capable fighter, and a master of the [[longspear]]. He was also an expert swimmer.

==Possessions==
In battle, Mhair wielded a magical ''+1 longspear'' and an ordinary [[club]], and wore ''+1 [[leather armor]]''. He owned three ''[[potion]]s of [[cure moderate wounds]]''. He also stole from the petitioners who passed through his hands, acquiring a ''+1 [[dagger]]'', three ''[[slaying arrow|arrows of orc slaying]]'', and a ''[[lens of detection]]'', as well as treasures like a [[gold]] bracelet, a gold and [[silver]] wire circlet, fine clothes, and a bag of coins. These he kept hidden in a secret, locked compartment in his desk.

He operated the [[Mhair's catamaran|special catamaran]] the temple employed. This double-hulled vessel, worth 500 [[gp]], was steered by long punting pole at the rear. It held up to nine people, including the pilot. He also [[Mhair's kayak|owned a kayak]] for personal use, a sleek wooden one-person craft with double-sided paddle, worth 75 [[gp]] and perfect for use on the Wyvernflow.
