Nyungy was a half-orc bard who was known throughout the Bloodstone Lands in the midâ€“14 century DR.
The talented troubadour was hailed as the greatest half-orc bard in the region, but some went further, proclaiming he was not limited by his race. He was said to enjoy the local carnival, but had become too old to visit it. Nyungy was very familiar with the evil works of the Witch-King Zhengyi and the properties of magic.
By the end of the 1360s DR, Nyungy had become very old, but was still alive and well. He, however, was sore in his joints and became crotchety.
When the replica of Castle Perilous appeared in Palischuk in 1368 DR, Nyungy deciphered that a novice mage called Arrayan Faylin had been drained of her life-force, starting a chain of Zhengyian magic. His wisdom helped Wingham come to the understanding that prompted the assault on the castle by Ellery Dragonsbane and her group.
