'''Shaleen Zoraz''' was a civic official who helped maintain the sewer system in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
As part of her duty to best serve Baldur's Gate and its citizens, Shaleen began a project that would extend the reach of the city's sewers.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Shaleen's plans drew the ire of [[Grand Duke|Duke]] [[Thalamra Vanthampur]]. Unbeknownst to Shaleen, the expanded sewer system would extend beneath the [[Vanthampur Villa]] into the duke's secret [[dungeon of the Dead Three]].

To stymie the expansion of the sewers, Duke Vanthampur imprisoned Shaleen within her villa, and had her tortured by a cadre of fiendish [[imp]]s.
