        "mainbody": "arnk Ironmind was a ranking member of the Order of the One Light, a cult that worshiped Crenshinibon in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nLike other cultists, Varnk Ironmind consumed shards of black ice created by Crenshinibon. The evil substance changed their bodies and gave them magical abilities, but also tainted their minds and made them hear the \"whispers\" from the crystal. Varnk could accumulate magic, exploding it outward and around them, dealing massive amounts of damage. The same accumulated power could be discharged from Varnks hands as a focused blast of destructive magic.\nIn the , after the war against Akar Kessell was over, many entities attacked Icewind Dale, all searching for Crenshinibon. The Order of the One Light was among those malevolent groups. Varnk Ironmind, accompanied by cultists, faced the Companions of the Hall in an icy cavern near the Wounded Mountain, during an infernal dispute over the artifact between planar invaders from Stygia and the Order."
