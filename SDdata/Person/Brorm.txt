'''Brorm''' was a [[War Wizard]] of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Per [[Pheldemar]], Brorm cooked Vangerdahast's favourite spinach pie. He also took magic activity to be likely his fault, strongly implying that Brorm was known to his fellows to be a War Wizard.

==Overview==
When the merchants [[Malakar Surth]] and [[Aumun Tholant Bezrar]] were mind-controlled by [[Harnrim Starangh]] to do as much damage as possible in the vicinity of the sanctum near [[Mouth o' Gargoyles]] where the retired [[Royal Magician]] [[Vangerdahast]] was doing research on a secret task, the [[War Wizard]] [[Pheldemar]] initially mistook their use of explosives to be the reckless castings of [[Brorm]].
