'''Barr-Find''' was a [[half-orc]] [[bard]] and [[proxy]] of the [[Celtic pantheon|Celtic]] [[power]] known as [[Manannan Mac Lir]].

==Description==
Barr-Find had an incredibly ugly appearance.

==Abilities==
Despite his appearance, Barr-Find had a remarkable singing voice that made even the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] power [[Oghma]] feel a twinge of jealousy. He could also summon aquatic creatures to his aid and shatter weapons raised against him just by plucking on the strings of his [[harp]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Rumors around the [[Outer Planes]] claimed that Oghma wanted to lure Barr-Find away from being the proxy of mac Lir.
