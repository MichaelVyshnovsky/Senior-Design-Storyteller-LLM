'''Ulthar Orgolath''', who was also called '''Ulthar the Darkhorn''', was the second [[Nentyarch]] of [[Narfell]] during the reign of the [[Orgolath Dynasty]].

==Activities==
Ulthar aided his older twin brother [[Ulthas Orgolath|Ulthas]] in slaying [[Belevan Crell]] and overthrowing the [[Crell Dynasty]] of Narfell in {{Yearlink|-633}}. As he was slightly younger than his twin, Ulthar stepped aside and allowed his older brother to claim the title of Nentyarch and become the first ruler of the Orgolath Dynasty. Ulthar succeeded his brother as Nentyarch upon Ulthas' death in {{Yearlink|-623}}. He would rule for many years until {{Yearlink|-578}}.

==Relationships==
Ulthar's mother, [[Ayanna Orgolath]], was impregnated by the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]], resulting in his [[half-fiend]] [[demon]]ic heritage. His firstborn son was a [[tiefling]] named [[Vargaun Orgolath|Vargaun]] who would inherit Ulthar's title upon his death in -578 DR.
