'''Jiraad''' was the most well-known [[genie]] throughout all of [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
As a [[noble marid]], Jiraad stood as tall as a [[giant]] at {{SI|22|ft}}.

==Personality==
Jiraad was quite introspective and tolerant for a [[marid]]. However, his temper flared on several instancesâ€”causing a monsoon and the worst flooding of [[Al-Sarif River]] in over a century. Since then, those who worked directly with the mighty marid learned never to disagree with him regarding naval policy.

==Activities==
Jiraad served the [[Grand Caliph]], [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]], as an ambassador and advisor. 

At the end of the day Jiraad enjoyed relaxing and swimming in his own [[Great Reflecting Pool|private pool]] within the compound of the Palace. The pool was {{SI|100|ft}} deep and was decorated with beautiful coral artwork along the bottom. Though the pool was reserved for Jiraad alone, many young nobles of the [[Court District]] considered it a rite of passage to take a dip in the pool when Jiraad was not around. Jiraad resented this deeply and cursed anyone he caught to only be able to breathe water for a week straight. 

Jiraad often used his vast intellect to devise mischievous pranks to play on other members of the Court. Saddened that the Grand Caliph turned his back on his adventuring days, Jiraad often tempted Khalil with enticing ventures to take them beyond the walls of Huzuz, much to the dismay of the [[Alyana al-Azzazi|Grand Vizier]].

==History==
Jiraad first met the Grand Caliph in [[1347 DR]] when Khalil found himself within the [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]] after an adventuring mishap. Jiraad provided assistance to the Grand Caliph, recognizing the potential future benefits of doing so. When Khalil assumed full responsibility of his position he called for Jiraad by name to appoint him as Ambassador of the Genie Races at Court. Though he was reluctant to accept the new post, despite direct orders from the [[Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari|Great Padisha of the Marids]], Jiraad later found that life at Court was vastly more entertaining that he thought previously.{{cite book/City of Delights/Golden Huzuz|45-46}}
