Ning DAhn was a monk of the Way of Enlightenment, the Abbot of UChan Gompa, and the seventh High Lord of Oceans of Tabot around .
Ning DAhn was chosen to be the seventh High Lama by his predecessor at the tender age of eight, circa . As was now custom, the former High Lama left the boy to his new life and wandered away into the mountains.
Nings rule was a difficult one, suffering from the revolt of Baron Phen Do and the protests of the southern monasteries, The High Lord filled the Lon Chen (chief ministers) with trusted northern monks, which only alienated the southerners further.
By 2607, he had twice been the target of assassination, both times by a ninja disguised as a lama. These left Ning DAhn highly paranoid. Thus, Ning was protected by his fanatical personal guards, the No-Haree.
At the age of 64, Ning was tall and slender and shaved his head. He wore robes stitched with gold and silver and adorned with jewels. He was never seen without the magical Staff of Oceans,
Twice a year, he appeared to the common people while presiding at two outdoor festivals the Wona Chuing in the middle of winter, and the Duiyu, a harvest celebration.
