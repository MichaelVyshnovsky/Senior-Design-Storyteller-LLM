'''Ning D'Ahn''' was a [[monk]] of the [[Way of Enlightenment]], the Abbot of [[U'Chan Gompa]], and the seventh High Lord of Oceans of [[Tabot]] around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.

==History==
Ning D'Ahn was chosen to be the seventh High Lama by his predecessor at the tender age of eight, ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2251|SY}}. As was now custom, the former High Lama left the boy to his new life and wandered away into the mountains.

Ning's rule was a difficult one, suffering from the revolt of Baron [[Phen Do]] and the protests of the southern [[monasteries]], The High Lord filled the Lon Chen (chief ministers) with trusted northern monks, which only alienated the southerners further.

By 2607, he had twice been the target of assassination, both times by a [[ninja]] disguised as a lama. These left Ning D'Ahn highly paranoid. Thus, Ning was protected by his fanatical personal guards, the [[No-Haree]].

==Description==
At the age of 64, Ning was tall and slender and shaved his head. He wore robes stitched with [[gold]] and [[silver]] and adorned with [[jewel]]s. He was never seen without the magical [[Staff of Oceans]],

==Activities==
Twice a year, he appeared to the common people while presiding at two outdoor festivals: the Wona Chu'ing in the middle of winter, and the Dui'yu, a harvest celebration.
