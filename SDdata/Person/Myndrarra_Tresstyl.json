        "mainbody": "'''Myndrarra Tresstyl''' was a famous dancer, [[prostitute]], and mystic in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Originally working as a tavern dancer and prostitute, Myndrarra's life changed when she wrote ''[[Swordstar]]'', a book purported to contain mystical guidance and fortune-telling secrets. This turned to widespread fame when various churches attempted to suppress her work, only resulting in it becoming a hotly desired piece of mysticism that quickly became widespread across [[Faerûn]]. She continued to work as a prostitute in her old age, as customers came to her to hear her gasp out cryptic phrases that revealed secret truths about their lives ahead."
