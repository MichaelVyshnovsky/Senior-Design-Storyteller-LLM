        "mainbody": "Torixileos was a white dragon apparently living with its treasure inside a glacier near Silverymoon Pass.\nThe dragon abducted Lynaelle Dawnmantle as Lynaelle traversed the pass during a blizzard. Taken back to the dragons lair, Lynaelle was frightened into assisting Torixileos in plundering a young silver dragon named Starglimmers hoard. Lynaelle discovered the deception in time to rescue Starglimmer and herself as a larger silver dragon arrived. The larger silver, Symarra Brightmoon, killed Torixileos, thereby rescuing both her son and Lynaella."
