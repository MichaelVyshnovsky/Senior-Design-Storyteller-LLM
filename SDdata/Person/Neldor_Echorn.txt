'''Neldor Echorn''' was an inhabitant of [[Myth Drannor]], and the house elder from the 3{{rd}} to the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In {{yearlink|241}}, when [[Delmuth Echorn]] left to lure [[Elminster Aumar]], the new [[human]] [[armathor]], into a spell duel, his uncle Neldor warned him that he was making a terrible mistake and that the House would suffer for it.

He survived until at least the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].
