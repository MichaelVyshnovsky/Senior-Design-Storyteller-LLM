        "mainbody": "Yargath was a member of the anchorites of Talos in the late 15 century DR. She was one of the caretakers of the Circle of Thunder in Neverwinter Wood, a site dedicated to the worship of Talos and the veneration of his servant, Gorthok the Thunderboar.\nYargath was a half-orc, but her appearance left some doubt as to her exact heritage at first glance. Her fingernails were long and sharp, appearing as claws.\nAs an anchorite of Talos, Yargath was a shapechanger who could change into a boar. She was also a divine spellcaster in service to Talos, and favored blessing her allies in combat before bringing to bear some of her more formidable spells, such as lightning bolt.\nYargath made her home in a cave situated on the southeastern face of the hill on which the Circle of Thunder sat. The entrance to her modest abode was adorned with a crude carving of three stick figures being struck by lightning. She kept few furnishings or possessions, save for a potion of greater healing that she took with her when out on patrol in the nearby woods.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Yargath and her fellow anchorites Flenz and Narux were responsible for keeping the Circle of Thunder safe and for performing profane rites and rituals within the Circle to summon Gorthok and to change the weather.\nWhen the white dragon Cryovain arrived in the nearby Sword Mountains, the Circle of Thunder hosted a number of orcs forced to flee when the dragon claimed their home of Icespire Hold as his lair. The anchorites put these orcs to work harassing local hunters or patrolling the area around the Circle, and Yargath was known to lead such orc patrols."
