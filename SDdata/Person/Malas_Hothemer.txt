Malas Hothemer was a noble inhabiting Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Malas was a portly fellow.
Given his immense girth, any time he left Hothemer Villa Malas had to be carted around Waterdeep in a portage chair drawn by a pair of ogres.
He was the patriarch of the Hothemer noble family.
