'''Uthor''' was very high-ranking [[storm giant]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
Uthor was the brother of king [[Hekaton]] at the time of the shattering of the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]].  

In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR was Uthor that found the dead body of Queen [[Neri]] and soon went to his niece [[Serissa]] for counsel. Serissa managed to calm her father's rightful rage.Â For this Hekaton decided to appoint Serissa as his heir. 

After her father's disappearance, Serissa reluctantly ascended to the [[Wyrmskull Throne]] as a regent, with Uthor as advisor. Uthor was near Serissa on the throne room.

==Personality==
Uthor deeply cared for his youngest niece, however he did not trust the small folks. He was unaware that one of his closest advisors was an ancient Blue Dragon.
