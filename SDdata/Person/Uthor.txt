Uthor was very high-ranking storm giant sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Uthor was the brother of king Hekaton at the time of the shattering of the ordning.  
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR was Uthor that found the dead body of Queen Neri and soon went to his niece Serissa for counsel. Serissa managed to calm her fathers rightful rage.Â For this Hekaton decided to appoint Serissa as his heir. 
After her fathers disappearance, Serissa reluctantly ascended to the Wyrmskull Throne as a regent, with Uthor as advisor. Uthor was near Serissa on the throne room.
Uthor deeply cared for his youngest niece, however he did not trust the small folks. He was unaware that one of his closest advisors was an ancient Blue Dragon.
