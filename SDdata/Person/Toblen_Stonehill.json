        "mainbody": "oblen Stonehill was the proprietor of the Stonehill Inn in the late 15 century DR.\nToblen was a young man who was quite short and very friendly.\nToblen had a wife, Trilena, a son, Pip,\nHis staff included the barmaid, Elsa.\nHe owed a small amount of money to the local banker, Harbin Wester.\nToblen and his family were originally from Triboar. Their son, Pip, was born in the early 1480s DR, and a few years later they moved west to Phandalin. Toblen had come to search for mineral wealth, but was not experienced enough to make a career of it. The town had room for an inn, and when the opportunity to open one presented itself, Stonehill took it.\nHe disdained the Redbrands, who struck terror into the villagers in 1491 DR. However, he did not take the matter into his own hands as he feared that the brigands would bring much harm to his family. His frustration for the then-townmaster Harbin Westers inaction toward the ruffians soured their relationship.\nWhen his son Pip went missing shortly after, Tolben sought out adventurers to go and find him.\nBy 1496 DR, Pip was old enough to help run the business. That year, Harbin Wester began seeking ways to leverage Toblens debts to seize control of the inn."
