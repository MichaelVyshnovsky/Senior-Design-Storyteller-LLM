'''Onthaer''' was a priest of [[Ilmater]] from the city of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]].

==History==
Described as "saintly", Onthaer became a hermit on the lonely, windswept isle of [[Falconsrise]] in the [[Trackless Sea]]. There he wrestled and killed the last [[rock cat]] on the island with his bare hands, some time before [[1267 DR]].
