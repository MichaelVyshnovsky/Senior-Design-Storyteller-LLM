'''Hegleira Golada''' was a businessperson inhabiting [[Tulmon]] in the [[Land of the Lions]] region of [[south Faerûn]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Hegleira ran a factory called the [[House of Goloda]] that she inherited when her husband, and the business' founder, [[Fflaerin Goloda|Fflaerin]], died. The main product of the House of Golada—[[Golada's Fish Spread]]—was quite popular among the populace of the Arnaden.
