Together with understeward [[Corleth Fentable]], Rorskryn was summoned by Manshoon to the shop of [[Immaero Sraunter]] to receive his orders.\n\nLater [[Alusair Obarskyr]] revealed to king [[Foril Obarskyr I]] the treason of Mreldrake; however Corleth was in the room and so Manshoon accomplished the fact.\n\nUnder his master's compulsion Rorskryn went thought a [[gate]] to [[Marsember]], where he [[polymorph]]ed himself in a young female called '''Mythandra''' that want sail to [[Turmish]], without any memory of his life as Rorskryn.\n\nIn [[1480 DR]] he went back to Suzail to bargain an agreement with a mysterious cabal of renegade [[shadovar]]. \n\nThe cabal forced Mreldrake to kill from distance many others War Wizards using a new kind of magic he had discovered.\n\nAt last he was uncovered as the killer inside [[Castle Irlingstar]] by Elminster's party and [[Jarlin Flamtarge]], one of the Manshoon's bodies.\nAt last his cabal protectors were killed by Elminster and Mreldrake died.",
