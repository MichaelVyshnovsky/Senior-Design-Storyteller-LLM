When the [[mercenary|mercenaries]] fighting for the [[Keepers of the Cerulean Sign]] made a stand against the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] in his village, he allowed a group of soldiers led by the mercenary [[Uthalion]] to take shelter in his home.  His wife and sons were killed by the [[Aboleth|Aboleths]] but Khault survived.\t\n\nSometime after Caidris was destroyed, Khault became corrupted by a plaguechanged sirine and was changed into an aberration.  He became the leader of the sirine's cult and sent members to [[Airspur]] to recruit.  The Choir kidnapped several residents of Airspur including the twin sister of a [[genasi]] named [[Ghaelya]] who the cult believed to be a prophetess.
