        "Powers": "Gameliel was capable of summoning [[forest troll]]s, and of inflicting a swiftly progressing disease at range; he could personally accelerate the disease, making it useful in combat. In his fight against [[Marrec]], he was followed by a volume of slime that formed ablative shields.",
        "Possessions": "Besides his armor, Gameliel was the original wielder of [[Gloomgate]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|117|13}} He was also in possession of the ''[[Keystone]]'', which he took from [[Briartan]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|35|3}}",
        "Activities": "Gameliel sought to infect woods beyond the [[Rawlinswood]] to fill them with rot, blight, and decay as best profited [[Talona]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|75|9}}",
        "History": "In spring of the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, Gameliel's [[blightspawned]] [[volodni]] deceived Briartan and gained access to the Mucklestones.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|86-87|10}} With their help, Gameliel captured Briartan, acquired the ''Keystone'' and took over the standing stones,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|72-73|8}} When one of his [[uthraki]] spies was slain by [[Araluen]] roughly a week after, he learned through a mental link that Marrec and his companions were coming towards him. He was ready for them when they came, but [[Ususi Manaallin]] slew him with a scroll of ''[[disintegrate]]'' after a short fight."
