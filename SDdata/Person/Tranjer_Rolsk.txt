'''Tranjer Rolsk''' was the ruler of [[Aurilssbarg]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], and was highly loyal to [[Luskan]].

==Description==
Tranjer had thick light brown hair and a beard. He wore [[plate mail]] [[armor]] that had a blue tint, and a black and green cloak. Rolsk also owned a [[longsword]] with a shining blue crossguard.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], Rolsk wished to capture the [[Heroes of Ascore]] and turn them over to [[Luskan]] for a huge reward. He ordered his guards to search for the heroes and tried to persuade them to redirect the group to his headquarters. However, the Heroes of Ascore managed to escape Rolsk's grasp. Even if Rolsk had captured the group, the [[ice hunter]]s had plans to break them out of jail.
