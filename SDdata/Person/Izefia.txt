Izefia was a member of the Shadow Druids that dwelt within the Cloak Wood forest during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Like other Shadow Druids, Izefia demonstrated noted aggression against those who brazenly traveled through their woods without reason they found acceptable.
He was aware of a local "woodsman", Peter of the North, who lived in a local cave capturing beasts for his own personal use.
