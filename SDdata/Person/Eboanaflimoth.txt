'''Eboanaflimoth''', also known as '''Ebonflame''', was a [[red dragon]] working with [[Cult of the Dragon]]. 

==History==
Hating [[Lathander]] with a passion, the dragon sent her cultists to attack the Morninglord's temple in [[Tilverton]] around [[1370 DR]]. 

By [[1374 DR]], Ebonflame was transformed into a [[dracolich]].
