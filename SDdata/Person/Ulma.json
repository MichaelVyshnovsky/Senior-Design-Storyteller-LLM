        "mainbody": "Ulma was the leader of Gur monster hunters that traveled along the Sword Coast and Western Heartlands during the late 15 century DR.\nChieftain Ulma was an aging human woman with tanned skin and hair whitened by time. He was armored in a quality breastplate, plate armor gauntlets, and a pauldron while carrying an enchanted greataxe she called The Undead Bane strapped to her back.\nIn the , Ulmas monster hunter tribe found itself targeted by the vampires of Baldurs Gate during the Absolute crisis when the Gurs camped in the Rivington district of the city, along with a small army of refugees displaced by the conflict. To the Gurs horror, the tribes children were abducted by Astarion Ancunín under orders from Cazador Szarr. Ulma ordered the vampire spawn to be found and interrogated with Gandrel being among the hunters who were to scour the Western Heartlands.\nWhen the True Soul heroes reached Baldurs Gate in their quest to end the Cult of the Absolute, Astarion Ancunín was among these adventures. Ulma realized that the strange vampire was unaffected by the sun and not under Lord Szarrs control. She asked for an audience with the heroes and the vampire spawn right after Ulma performed a funeral pyre ceremony for the tribes dead. The funeral was for those who perished in the Gur attack on Cazador Szarrs lair in a failed attempt to rescue the children. Ulma pleaded with Astarion and his comrades to infiltrate the spawns old masters manse and save the Gur children from damnation.\nThe outcome of Astarions infiltration and the fate of the Gur children remained unknown, and with them – Ulmas hunter tribes fate."
