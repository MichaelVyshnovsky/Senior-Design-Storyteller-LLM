Grig of Armot, the father of Grig the Younger, was the unfortunate victim of a Mulhorandi entrapment spell in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Grigs son, Grig the Younger, went on to research Mulhoradi magic following his fathers curse .
Sometime before 1362 DR, Grig of Armot purchased a magical model of a Mulhorandi pyramid at a Magefair. The enchanted item was cursed and the man ended up being trapped inside it. He was still trapped as of 1362 DR.
