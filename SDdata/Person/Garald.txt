'''Garald''' was a [[Ffolk]] [[horse]] breeder who inhabited [[Horstall]] on the island of [[Gwynneth]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Garald's reputation was so well deserved that even King [[Bryon Kendrick]] requested his steeds. Garald was once joined by the [[mage]] [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]] while delivering twelve of his horses to [[Caer Corwell]].
