The triplets were taught from birth the mysteries of mystics. By their thirteenth birthday, Celya had died.",
        "Activities": "Anithlynn managed with her sisters the [[Sisters Three Waxworks]]. She was the master of potions.",
        "Personality": "Anithlynn was the most cunning of the triplets and the least predictable. She was selfish and ambitious, living strong passions and hatreds. She sometimes manipulated her sisters, but genuinely loved them."
