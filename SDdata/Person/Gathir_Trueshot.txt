Gathir Trueshot was an elf of New Sharandar during the late 15 century of the Faer√ªnian calendar.
He worked as an agent under Pelendethas Everstride, stationed at a camp in the Feywild near an enclave of dark fey.
When the fomorian king Malabog threatened the elves of New Sharandar circa the  , Gathir traveled with the envoy to the Neverwinter Wood to recruit allies from among the mortals of Toril.
Once he was back at his home in the Feywild, Gathir took decisive action against his dark fey army. He worked with the adventurers the elves recruited to cull the population of trolls within the putrid fen, helping put an end to their foul taint.
Following that mission, Gathir worked against the fomorian witches allied with Malabog. He went after select powerful redcaps and gained access to their stores of material components that were used by the witches to brew their potions.
