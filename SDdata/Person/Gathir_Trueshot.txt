'''Gathir Trueshot''' was an [[elf]] of [[New Sharandar]] during the late 15{{th}} century of the [[Calendar of Harptos|Faerûnian calendar]].

==Activities==
He worked as an agent under [[Pelendethas Everstride]], stationed at a camp in the Feywild near an [[dark fey enclave|enclave]] of [[dark fey]].

==History==
When the [[fomorian]] king [[Malabog]] threatened the elves of New Sharandar ''circa'' the  {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Gathir traveled with the envoy to the [[Neverwinter Wood]] to recruit allies from among the mortals of [[Toril]].

Once he was back at his home in the Feywild, Gathir took decisive action against his dark fey army. He worked with the [[adventurer]]s the elves recruited to cull the population of [[troll]]s within the [[putrid fen]], helping put an end to their foul taint.

Following that mission, Gathir worked against the fomorian witches allied with Malabog. He went after select powerful [[redcap]]s and gained access to their stores of [[material component]]s that were used by the witches to brew their potions.
