        "mainbody": "yreus was an archmage from the world of Ravnica who came to Faerûn in search of the Stone of Creation during the late 15 century DR.\nTyreus had light skin.\nThe powerful mage was heavily motivated by the death of his parents, and his helplessness to protect them.\nOver time, Tyreus became increasingly spiteful and selfish. This was a form of insecurity, taken by Tyreus to give himself more time to think through situations.\nTyreus saw every realm as potential future conquests, or viewed resources solely as means to an achieve his goals.\nTyreus sought to accumulate enough magical power to fulfill the grand future for which he was destined. His study of the arcane arts were focused largely on illusions, ones that were so precise, they manifested in real and tangible ways. He viewed his illusions as the key to manipulating others, and manifesting his fate.\nHe knew and regularly utilized the spell linked glyphs, as well as mighty fortress, maze, and plane shift, among others.\nTyreus amassed a significant fortune of gold coins and art objects, totaling over 18,000 gp in value.\nIn defiance of his fathers wishes, Tyreus began studying arcane magic as a teenager.\nTyreus was the son of Ayraea and Tyberio, and the grandson of Sylvene, a planewalking adventurer originally from Ravnica. When his parents died of illness, Tyreus blamed them for the tragedy. He believed that if he was allowed to study arcane magic earlier in life, he would have had the power to save their lives. \nAt some point, Tyreus placed a geas on the elemental spirit named Exul, and treated the extraplanar being as his personal minion.\nTyreus tremendous abilities and ambition attracted many other power-hungry wizards. He believed he could only form genuine relationships once he had accumulated enough power and his own realm. For a brief time, Tyreus formed a tenuous partnership with the Red Wizard, Morwena Veilmist. She attempted to convince Tyreus they could acquire power together, but quickly learned the archmage was only focused on his own ends. Unfortunately, they never developed any real trust with each other.\nTyreus was born and raised on the planar city of Ravnica. He studied magic in secret during his youth, in defiance of his parents wishes. When he was a teenager, plague struck his him, claiming the lives of his parents, Tyberio and Ayraea. After their deaths, he poured himself into his studies, hoping to gain enough knowledge to regain control over his life.\nAt some point during the late 15 century, Tyreus and his elemental servant Exul traveled to the Wizards Barrow in the High Moor in search of a great tome bound in white leather. His exploits attracted the attention of several Red Wizards, including Morwena Veilmist, and her apprentices.\nTyreus and Morwena traveled to a secluded demiplane once formed by Tyreus grandmother Sylvene. During their visit, the archmage flew into a fit of rage when Seero―one of the demiplanes caretakers―apparently took on a likeness that resembled Tyreus father. Tyreus killed Seero in his anger. Aghast at the situated, Morwena departed from Tyreus company, then aware that goals did not truly align with each other.\nTyreus journey took him to the Sylvenes familial crypt, where he believed powerful magic remained. It was there that Tyreus recovered one of the whole Stones of Creation."
