'''Onazak Throateater''' was a [[hill giant]] [[proxy]] of the [[Giant pantheon|Giantish]] [[power]] known as [[Grolantor]].

==Description==
Onazak was quite a strong hill giant, having been chosen by Grolantor as a proxy for that reason.

==Personality==
Despite being a hill giant, Onazak was quite intelligent, more so than she let on. She wouldn't hesitate to manipulate those who got in her way.

==Activities==
Onazak spent much of her time roaming the [[Steading]] and spreading disunity among the various stockades inhabited by the hill giant [[petitioner]]s of that [[divine realm]], turning their attention ever closer to Grolantor in the process.

==Relationships==
The other hill giants in the Steading didn't give much thought to Onazak being a leader because of her gender, though this just allowed her to play around with politics in the realm however she saw fit.
