Xicvizt, or Rogue Thought, was a rogue mind flayer from Ryxyg.
During the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Xicvizt sensed a strange presence in the Underdark. Investigating, he found the demon lord Grazzt.
The mind flayer Glorghakt, however, hired an Order of the Gauntletâ€“affiliated adventuring party to deal with Xicvizt. The adventurers found and killed him.
Xicvzt fully devoted himself to Grazzt.
Xicvizt and Glorghakt were born from the same pool.
