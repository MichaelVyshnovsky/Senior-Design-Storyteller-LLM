He was tall, at , with shoulder-length brown hair, tanned skin, and mahogany eyes. He had a tiny cleft in his chiseled chin.\nHe was once a member of the Purple Dragons until his cousin Gaspar and several other nobles betrayed the royal family of Cormyr and had their nobility removed by Azoun IV. Thereafter, he was a scout assigned to Alusair Obarskyrs party.\nHe fell in love with Princess Tanalasta Obarskyr and eventually married her in the eyes of Chauntea, albeit with no witnesses. He was then separated from her when Alusair ordered him to track down Vangerdahast while the rest of their party fled to safety.\nBefore he tracked down the Royal Magician, he was tricked by the illusions of Mad King Boldavar into thinking Tanalasta was in danger. In choosing to go to her aid instead of following his orders, he betrayed Cormyr. In doing so, the Mad King turned him into a ghazneth.\nOn his death, he was announced as the father of Azoun Obarskyr V. Rowen was declared nobly born and fully pardoned by the monarch. It was proclaimed that he lost his life in service to Cormyr. Those who questioned his passing or stature received intense scrutiny from the Purple Dragons and War Wizards."
