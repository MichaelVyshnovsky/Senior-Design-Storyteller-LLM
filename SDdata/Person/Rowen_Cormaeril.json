        "Description": "An athletic man, Rowen was considered handsome by most, though weathered. He was tall, at {{SI|6|ft|c|long=yes}}, with shoulder-length brown hair, tanned skin, and mahogany eyes. He had a tiny cleft in his chiseled chin.",
        "History": "He was once a member of the [[Purple Dragon]]s until his cousin [[Gaspar Cormaeril|Gaspar]] and several other nobles betrayed the royal family of [[Cormyr]] and had their nobility removed by [[Azoun IV]]. Thereafter, he was a scout assigned to [[Alusair Obarskyr]]'s party.<ref>\n\nHe fell in love with Princess [[Tanalasta Obarskyr]] and eventually married her in the eyes of [[Chauntea]], albeit with no witnesses. He was then separated from her when Alusair ordered him to track down [[Vangerdahast]] while the rest of their party fled to safety.\n\nBefore he tracked down the Royal Magician, he was tricked by the [[illusion]]s of [[Boldovar the Mad|Mad King Boldavar]] into thinking Tanalasta was in danger. In choosing to go to her aid instead of following his orders, he betrayed Cormyr. In doing so, the Mad King turned him into a [[ghazneth]].\n\nOn his death, he was announced as the father of [[Azoun Obarskyr V]]. Rowen was declared 'nobly born' and fully pardoned by the monarch. It was proclaimed that he lost his life in service to [[Cormyr]]. Those who questioned his passing or stature received intense scrutiny from the [[Purple Dragons]] and [[War Wizards]]. {{Cite dragon annual/2000|60}}"
