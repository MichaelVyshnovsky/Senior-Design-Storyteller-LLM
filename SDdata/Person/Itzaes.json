        "mainbody": "Itzaes was the Revered Counselor of Tulom-Itzi during the final days of the Golden Age of Payit, centuries before the Night of Wailing.\nItzaes son, Prince Tacal, was the instrument that ended the Golden Age of Payit. Tacal grew madly enamored with Princess Aliah of Ulatos. On her wedding day, Tacal, without Revered Counselor Itzaes knowledge, hatched a plan to abduct the woman for himself. As the Prince kidnapped his prize, the ruler of Ulatos executed Revered Counselor Itzaes and his whole family in revenge. Before his death by Payitlan arrows of obsidian, Prince Tacal beheaded Aliah as his final act. This grand tragedy ended the long-lasting alliance between Payit and Far Payit, splitting the people of Tulom-Itzi and Ulatos for good."
