Tharmakkas IV was the king of Murghôm in 1359 DR.
Tharmakkas was a senile old man.
Ever since Murghôms failed incursions into Semphar during the First and Second Great Reclamations, Tharmakkas was obsessed with defeating his neighbor.
He spent all of his time and money bolstering Murghôms military by hiring mercenaries and building defenses, especially in Port Ghaast. He cared for little else.
