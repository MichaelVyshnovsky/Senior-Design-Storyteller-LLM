Sultan Magar al-Azim was the ruler of Sikak in the Pearl Cities region of west Zakhara in 1367 DR. 
Magar was very popular in Sikak and often swept up into crowds when he roamed the city. He was accompanied by a group of ten ogres who served as his bodyguards.
Magar was the fifteenth gnome to site on the "Throne of Coins" in Sikak since the time of the first Grand Caliph. Like all members of his family, Magar spent his youth working with fishermen and learning the value of fellowship, hard work and honesty.
Magar fathered over twenty children from his harim which was filled with the most beautiful gnomes throughout Zakhara.
