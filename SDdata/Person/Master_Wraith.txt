The '''Master Wraith''' was a powerful [[undead]] [[wraith]] that lived in the [[Forest of Mir]] and fed on the souls of the living.

==Powers==
Though it was a formidable opponent in combat and commanded a number of lesser undead, it could also use its shapechanging and telepathic abilities to psychologically weaken its prey, to persuade them to surrender.

==Possessions==
The wraith owned a [[Robe of the Good Archmagi]], as well as a standard [[quarterstaff]].

==History==
The Master Wraith was destroyed in [[1369 DR]] when it confronted [[Gorion's Ward]] in front of an old temple of [[Bhaal]] in the forest. It took on the deceased [[Gorion]]'s form and accused his foster child of forgetting his teachings, asking them to willingly give up their life. When this plan failed, the Wraith and its minions were forced to attack head-on, and were destroyed in the ensuing combat.
