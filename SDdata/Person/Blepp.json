        "mainbody": "'''Blepp''' was a [[kobold]] from the [[Dragon's Rest]] cloister in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "With a keen instinct for peril, Blepp maintained a steadfast belief in his uncanny luck.",
        "Possessions": "His most cherished possession was an ordinary [[dagger]] and he insisted it to be [[enchanted|magical]].",
        "History": "Blepp shared with three other kobolds a small [[Dragon's Rest#Monastic cells|monastic cell]] in the Dragon's Rest cloister cut into the cliff face. Each of the four slept on individual hammocks. Just like all the other kobolds, he worked at night because of their sensitivity to sunlight.\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1481}},{{Stormwreck-time}} Blepp and the cloister gardener [[Tarak]] were attacked by [[zombie]]s when they went fishing. At the point of near-death, they were rescued thanks to the timely aid of a group of [[adventurer]]s. Yet Blepp was convinced that his good luck and his \"magical\" dagger spared him from an inevitable demise."
