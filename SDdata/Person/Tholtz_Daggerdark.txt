'''Tholtz Daggerdark''' was a sea-captain in [[Trackless Sea]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==Activities==
Tholtz was one of the mad devotee thralls of [[Slarkrethel]]. He commanded the ship [[morkoth (ship)|Morkoth]]. He believed himself to be in constant telepathic link with the [[kraken]], but in truth he only received rare and fragmented messages from his master.

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR the [[storm giant]] king [[Hekaton]] was captured by the Morkoth's crew, posing as [[Lords' Alliance]] agents. Slarkrethel ordered Tholtz to remained at sea until this matter was resolved.

==Behind the Scenes==
After [[Khaspere Drylund]]'s confession Slarkrethel decided to destroy the Morkoth with all onboard
