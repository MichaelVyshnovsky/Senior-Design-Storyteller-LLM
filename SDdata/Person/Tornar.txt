Tornar the Eye was a criminal from Scornubel during the mid-14 century DR.
He was always on edge, instinctively reaching for his weapons even while speaking to his master.
He trod very quietly.
Tornar carried a crossbow, at least, and poison, almost certainly bloodbite by Sharantyrs appreciation.
He was a spy for Belgon Bradaskor, the Master of Shadows of Scornubel in fact he was many of the mans "eyes". He also served as an assassin to boot.
According to the Zhentarim, he was Belgon Bradaskors most trusted spy.
On late , Tornar reported to Belgon Bradaskor that hed been a witness to Marlel leading Shandril Shessair and her husband into an ambush at the Stormy Tankard, and was told to inform Rendilar Bluthlock he was free to spend with Belgons backing to send people after Shandril, so theyd be on the line of fire of all the factions hunting after her spellfire. Unknown to him, he was scried on by the Zhentarim Korthauvar Hammantle and Hlael Toraunt, who already knew of him.
Tornar eventually caught up to Sharantyr, and struck at her with a poisoned crossbow quarrel. He accepted a token from her a lock of hair, instead of finishing the job, confident the poison would finish her off, though Sharantyr claimed she knew the poison to be bloodbite, which did not affect her. She enspelled him with some powdered gemstone, which compelled him to go as far from her as possible.
Immediately after Shandril Shessairs immolation, Sharantyr was teleported all the way back to the Blackrocks, where Tornar found her again, badly injured. Rather than kill her, he said he wanted to part with her as a friend, and helped her rest safely.
