'''Taran Goldenstar''', sometimes referred to as '''Taran the Elflord''' because of his noble roots, was an ambitious and multi-talented apprentice of the sage [[wizard]] of [[Freedale]], [[Netheril (person)|Netheril]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Taran was an upbeat person of slender elven build with long blonde hair and blue eyes. He loved nature and the forest and would defend it with his life if the need arose. He was a talented musician and often stood outside of his home, playing a [[flute]]. The Freedale townsfolk, and especially kids, favored his music.

==Possessions==
[[File:Taran goldenstar's house.png|thumb|''The location of Taran Goldenstar's home in Freedale.'']]
Perhaps Taran's most prized possession was his small [[spellbook]] with his name written on its front cover. Taran briefly lost the book to [[Bonegnasher]]'s band, but it was eventually recovered by a group of adventurers hired to rescue him.

Taran's home was a generously sized building next door to the [[Evening Star Inn]] in Freedale.

==Relationships==
One of the adventurers from Freedale, [[Silverleaf Halfmoon]], hailed from the same elven tribe as Goldenstar. The two elves were friends, and Silverleaf knew how to summon Taran when he spent his time in the woods by howling like a [[wolf]] three times at the eastern edge of the forest.

==History==
In the mid–14{{th}} century DR, Taran Goldenstar could be found in a small village of Freedale in [[Shadowdale]], studying under the town's sage and spending his free time in the beloved woods that surrounded the hamlet and permeated the [[Dalelands]].

Taran Goldenstar's study of magic and history under the High Wizard Netheril led him to discover an important clue to the whereabouts of the lost ''[[orb of dragonkind]]'', hidden away in the [[Tomb of Damara]], a few miles outside Freedale. Excited to make the discovery, Taran rushed to the ruins, only dropping a few words to his master about the magic ''orb'' and an [[ogre]]. After two days had passed since the elf's disappearance, his master Netheril hired a group of local adventurers to search for lord Goldenstar and aid him in the ''orb's'' recovery.

The heroes—[[cleric]] [[Lordan]] the Pure, [[fighter]] [[Delvar Ironfist]], [[rogue]] [[Slinker]], [[wizard]] [[Morganth]] the Mysterious, fighter [[Beldar]] the Brave, and fellow elf spellcaster Silverleaf Halfmoon—found Taran Goldenstar chained to a wall interrogated by a [[hobgoblin]]. Bonegnasher's marauders were trying to pry the information on the ''orb's'' location out of the elf.
