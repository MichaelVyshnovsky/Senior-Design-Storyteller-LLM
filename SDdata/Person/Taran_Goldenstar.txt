Taran Goldenstar, sometimes referred to as Taran the Elflord because of his noble roots, was an ambitious and multi-talented apprentice of the sage wizard of Freedale, Netheril in the mid–14 century DR.
Taran was an upbeat person of slender elven build with long blonde hair and blue eyes. He loved nature and the forest and would defend it with his life if the need arose. He was a talented musician and often stood outside of his home, playing a flute. The Freedale townsfolk, and especially kids, favored his music.

Perhaps Tarans most prized possession was his small spellbook with his name written on its front cover. Taran briefly lost the book to Bonegnashers band, but it was eventually recovered by a group of adventurers hired to rescue him.
Tarans home was a generously sized building next door to the Evening Star Inn in Freedale.
One of the adventurers from Freedale, Silverleaf Halfmoon, hailed from the same elven tribe as Goldenstar. The two elves were friends, and Silverleaf knew how to summon Taran when he spent his time in the woods by howling like a wolf three times at the eastern edge of the forest.
In the mid–14 century DR, Taran Goldenstar could be found in a small village of Freedale in Shadowdale, studying under the towns sage and spending his free time in the beloved woods that surrounded the hamlet and permeated the Dalelands.
Taran Goldenstars study of magic and history under the High Wizard Netheril led him to discover an important clue to the whereabouts of the lost orb of dragonkind, hidden away in the Tomb of Damara, a few miles outside Freedale. Excited to make the discovery, Taran rushed to the ruins, only dropping a few words to his master about the magic orb and an ogre. After two days had passed since the elfs disappearance, his master Netheril hired a group of local adventurers to search for lord Goldenstar and aid him in the orbs recovery.
The heroes—cleric Lordan the Pure, fighter Delvar Ironfist, rogue Slinker, wizard Morganth the Mysterious, fighter Beldar the Brave, and fellow elf spellcaster Silverleaf Halfmoon—found Taran Goldenstar chained to a wall interrogated by a hobgoblin. Bonegnashers marauders were trying to pry the information on the orbs location out of the elf.
