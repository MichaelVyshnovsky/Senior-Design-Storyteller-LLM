Huktal was a leader of a group of human nomads on the Great Glacier in the midâ€“14 century DR.The location of the "Hauns" and "Shaaz" adventures in Book of Lairs is unknown only "arctic ice pack" and "arctic glacier" are specified for terrain and "far north" for a description. It is assumed these refer to the Great Glacier, as this is the northernmost arctic (assumed to be north polar, not just very cold) area nearest to where the Zhentarim would operate. This is supported by the later association of hauns with arctic dwarves. However, another possibility is the Reghed Glacier.
Circa 1367 DR,The date is similarly unknown. The year is assumed because this is common for the time of publishing. a brood of hauns on their haundars began launching cunning and covert raids on travelers and surrounding shaaz villages and human nomad tribes like Huktals, kidnapping anyone they could. For a few months they terrorized the area the hauns took so many captives they needed to construct a colony for them.
The nomad tribes were forced to retreat far from their usual hunting grounds and went into hiding, while trade in the area evaporated. To the humans, the unseen culprits were unknown and they left no clue but the wide trails of the haundar. Only the shaaz recognized their traditional enemies, but suffered badly with their villages destroyed and queen slain. They were too few in number to effectively fight back, and too fearful to approach the equally fearful nomads for an alliance. Both set traps such as pitfalls and iceslides to defend against the hauns. Eventually, adventurers arrived to investigate, and after being caught in a trap, were met by nomads led by Huktal or surviving shaaz. Working together, they would track the haundar trails back to the slave colony and try to fight the hauns to free the slaves.
