'''Huktal''' was a leader of a group of [[human]] nomads on the [[Great Glacier]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref group="note">The location of the "Hauns" and "Sha'az" adventures in ''Book of Lairs'' is unknown; only "arctic ice pack" and "arctic glacier" are specified for terrain and "far north" for a description. It is assumed these refer to the Great Glacier, as this is the northernmost arctic (assumed to be north polar, not just very cold) area nearest to where the Zhentarim would operate. This is supported by the later association of [[haun]]s with arctic dwarves. However, another possibility is the [[Reghed Glacier]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1367 DR]],<ref group="note">The date is similarly unknown. The year is assumed because this is common for the time of publishing. a brood of [[haun]]s on their [[haundar]]s began launching cunning and covert raids on travelers and surrounding [[sha'az]] villages and human nomad tribes like Huktal's, kidnapping anyone they could. For a few months they terrorized the area; the hauns took so many captives they needed to construct a colony for them.

The nomad tribes were forced to retreat far from their usual hunting grounds and went into hiding, while trade in the area evaporated. To the humans, the unseen culprits were unknown and they left no clue but the wide trails of the haundar. Only the sha'az recognized their traditional enemies, but suffered badly with their villages destroyed and queen slain. They were too few in number to effectively fight back, and too fearful to approach the equally fearful nomads for an alliance. Both set traps such as pitfalls and iceslides to defend against the hauns. Eventually, adventurers arrived to investigate, and after being caught in a trap, were met by nomads led by Huktal or surviving sha'az. Working together, they would track the haundar trails back to the slave colony and try to fight the hauns to free the slaves.
