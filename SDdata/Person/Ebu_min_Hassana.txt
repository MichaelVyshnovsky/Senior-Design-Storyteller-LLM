Ebu min Hassana was a cavalry commander who lived in Dihliz in 1367 DR.
As commander of the cavalry forces of Dihliz, Ebu was in charge of protecting the city. He also spent a great deal of time hunting down anyone who robbed the ruins in the region. Three times every year, he took patrols ranging through the jungles beyond Kadarastro.
Ebu was a desert rider from the Haunted Lands before coming to Dihliz.
Ebu was one of four husbands to Emira Hassana Alim al-Gaib, though he was the only one afforded a position of power within the city.
