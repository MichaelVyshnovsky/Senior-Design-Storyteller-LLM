The Lightfinger Tempest was a notably large and powerful water weird that served as a protector of the Lightfinger Estate in the late 15 century DR.
The Tempest was one of many water weirds bound in servitude to the Lightfinger family of Waterdeep. In particular, it served as a guardian of one of the early courtyards in the Estate.
When the Estate became overrun by devils in the late 15 century DR, the Tempest attacked a group of adventurers sent to investigate the disturbance by Open Lord Laeral Silverhand. These adventurers defeated the weird, releasing it from its servitude and allowing its waters to drain away.
