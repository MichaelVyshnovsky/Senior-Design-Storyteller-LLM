The '''Lightfinger Tempest''' was a notably large and powerful [[water weird]] that served as a protector of the [[Lightfinger Estate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The Tempest was one of many water weirds bound in servitude to the [[Lightfinger (family)|Lightfinger family]] of [[Waterdeep]]. In particular, it served as a guardian of one of the early courtyards in the Estate.

When the Estate became overrun by [[devil]]s in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Tempest attacked a group of [[adventurer]]s sent to investigate the disturbance by [[Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]]. These adventurers defeated the weird, releasing it from its servitude and allowing its waters to drain away.
