        "mainbody": "'''Mae''' was the proprietor of the [[Friendly Bat]] tavern in the village of [[Womford]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She originally ran the tavern-and-inn with her husband [[Grunnald]], but then took over sole proprietorship after he \"went missing\" under mysterious circumstances.\n\n{{Quote|Forgot, eh? Well, at least that explains why you're wantin' rooms and refreshments...Muren, make sure that head stays on this time, eh? Use the good [[glue]].|Mae, helping ensure her husband keeps his head on straight.}}",
        "Personality": "She was a strong woman who was determined to run her business in spite of several hardships.",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Grunnald effigy.png|thumb|right|200px|''Grunnald, made immortal for all time.'']]\nMae was a devoted wife to Grunnald. After his supposed death, she made a loving, if somewhat disturbing, effigy of him, which she proudly displayed in the Friendly Bat's taproom. The two had one daughter, a sweet but clumsy girl named [[Muren]].",
        "History": "{{Quote|Don'y you ''dear'' me. And they would indeed! Taxing us to the tune of than we make, each and every Feast of the Moon...'long with everywhere else in town.|Mae, speaking of the [[Pale Claw]] gang.}}\n\nSometime during the 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} the local gang known as the [[Pale Claw]] took over the town of Womford and began extorting its citizens. Unbeknownst to Mae, her husband Grunnald faked his own death, and joined the gang as their \"Bandit King\", helping redirect their crimes towards people beyond the village. Mae was wholly unaware of her husband's misguided attempt to right their wrongs, and mourned her family's loss deeply.\n\nMae and Muren tried to make ends meet by continuing keep the Friendly Bat open in Womford. They made little in the way of income however, as the Pale Claw resumed its extortion racket over the town's people. Their fortune changed however, when a band of [[adventurer]]s, namely [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Holga Kilgore]], [[Simon Aumar]], [[Forge Fitzwilliam]], and [[Thelvyn Kip]], came through town. With the few precious [[currency|silver]] she had left, Mae hired the adventurers to rid Womford of the Pale Claw once and for all.\n\n[[File:Mae, Muren.png|thumb|right|300px|''A relative happy ending for the dwarven family of Womford.'']]\nWhile somewhat bumbling in their efforts, the adventurers managed to successfully disrupt the bandit gang's operations, and force them to find better prospects elsewhere. They even managed to uncover Grunnald's ruse, and gave him the opportunity to return home. The reunion was a wondrous event at first, before turning south. While Mae seemed embittered about the whole situation, she received one last boon as patron of the adventuring party: a [[porcelain]] boar figure filled with gold coins and [[gem]]s."
