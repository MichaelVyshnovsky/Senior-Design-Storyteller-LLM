        "mainbody": "'''Brogan''' was a [[Harper]] that lived in the [[Sunset Mountains]].",
        "Description": "The [[dwarf]] wore woolly boots, a ragged brown-blue outfit, and a belt. Brogan had a brown mohawk and a beard.",
        "History": "In [[1374 DR]], Brogan, being the eyes in this region for the [[Harpers]], saw something amiss. The [[gnoll]]s and [[ogre]]s began to band together, and the sighting a [[white dragon]] was reported. The [[dark elves]] of the region seemed to be working with the other creatures, which caused him to worry. After hearing the drow plans, Brogan realized that they wished to exterminate the dwarven settlement on the Sunset Mountains, in order to protect the other creatures. In return, the drow would be promised the riches of the mines. In fact, a teleportation gate from the area to the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] had been constructed, potentially meaning that someone wished to move the creatures to the city. Brogan noticed that the portal actually lead the the [[Marsh of Chelimber]], and he believed there was a gate that lay within the nearby ice cave.\n\nBrogan was later taken captive by a group or dark elves located in a mine close to where he was stationed. When rescued, he mentioned to his saviors that the leader of the drow, a priestess, made use of some sort of [[horn]] to enter the ice cave. He advised his rescuers to travel to the Marsh of Chelimber and find out what was really going on."
