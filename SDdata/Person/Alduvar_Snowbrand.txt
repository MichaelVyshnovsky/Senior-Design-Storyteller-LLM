Alduvar Snowbrand was one of the Swords of Archendale circa 1368 DR.
Alduvar as a Blue Sword was a strident supporter of major ties with Sembia, believing the Dales needed a new powerful ally. In his public role, he was a merchant and shopkeeper.
Alduvar believed Cormyr to be an imperial power and Westgate and Hillsfar to be menacing expansionist powers so to his eyes Archendale would survive only with Sembian help.
Alduvar for many years was an armys battlemage. 
Alduvar managed his shop with his consort and business partner Selni Ravenhair, who knew his secret role as one of the Swords.
