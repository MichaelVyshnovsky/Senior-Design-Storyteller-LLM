'''Alduvar Snowbrand''' was one of the [[Swords of Archendale]] ''circa'' [[1368 DR]].

==Activities==
Alduvar as a [[Blue Sword]] was a strident supporter of major ties with [[Sembia]], believing the Dales needed a new powerful ally. In his public role, he was a merchant and shopkeeper.

==Personality==
Alduvar believed [[Cormyr]] to be an imperial power and [[Westgate]] and [[Hillsfar]] to be menacing expansionist powers so to his eyes Archendale would survive only with Sembian help.

==History==
Alduvar for many years was an army's battlemage. 

==Relationship==
Alduvar managed his shop with his consort and business partner [[Selni Ravenhair]], who knew his secret role as one of the Swords.
