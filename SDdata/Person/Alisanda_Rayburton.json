        "mainbody": "Alisanda RayburtonHer name is misspelled in Villains Lorebook as \"Alisandra\", but all other sources agree it is \"Alisanda\" with a nickname of \"Sanda\". was the daughter of Lord Dhalmass Rayburton. \nAlisanda inherited dark Tabaxi skin from her mother and had green eyes of her father. She was as tall as many other men, including Artus Cimber and had slender hands. She wore her thick black hair in dozens of tight braids. Eye green eyes exuded calm and self-confidence.\nWhen it came to death and undead, Alisanda took the topic seriously. She did not tolerate jokes on the subject.\nBeing an immortal bara, Alisanda Rayburton has been alive for five hundred years in the mid-14 century DR. Over the course of her life, she forged multiple partnerships and companionships, as well as gave birth to two sons and a daughter. Over the years, her children had grandchildren and great grandchildren, but Sanda stopped keeping track of her descendants eventually as it was too heartbreaking to see her family as infants and die of old age as she remained untouched by time.\nLike all barae, Alisanda had been granted special powers from Ubtao, which included the following\n* She could utter magical commands that would compel the hearer to obedience.\n* She regenerated health rapidly.\n* She could detect evil at will.\n* She had improved reflexes and physical and mental resistances.\nIf within the Temple of Ubtao, she could also cast the following spells\n* Cure critical wounds\n* Forbiddance\n* Remove blindness or deafness\n* Remove disease\n* Restoration\n* True seeing\nIn addition, Alisanda possessed the power to speak with warm-blooded animals and could take control of any of those she chose, for as long as she wished.\nBy 1362 DR, Alisanda was older than five centuries old, born out of the relationship between Dhalmass Rayburton and a Tabaxi woman from Mezro. After Ubtao chose her to serve as his bara, Alisanda loyally protected the hidden city and grew to be a capable and strong warrior.\nBoth Artus and Alisanda quickly became infatuated with each other despite the adventurer feeling intimidated by a significantly older woman and Sanda not wanting to get close to mortals to avoid heartache. Alisanda introduced the outsider to the children she taught, to some local flare, and the city. The sightseeing had to wait however, as soon after Artus arrival, Dhalmass Rayburton was taken hostage by the Batiri Queen Mbobo and her new ally Kaverin Ebonhand who sought immortality and the Ring of the Winter.\nArtus accompanied Alisanda and her fellow bara paladin, Negus Kwalu to attempt the rescue. Even though the three were powerful adversaries, Kaverins supernatural defender Skuld was too powerful to overcome. The rescue failed. The Batiri assembled a united force of Chultan goblins, joined by Kaverins Cult of Frost and a tribe of pterafolk. The war was inevitable. Alisanda, Artus Cimber, and Kwalu reached out to Mezros allies such as Ras Tfima, Ras Nsi, and Mainu to assemble defensive forces. Additionally, Alisanda traveled into the jungle on the eve of the battle, searching for the biggest dinosaur to bring into the battle with her bara powers. By the time Sanda returned, the battle was raging throughout Mezro. However, she was not alone. The bara took over the form of the fiercest predator of Chult, an allosaurus. In its body, Sanda went head-to-head with a giant-sized Skuld and held it off, weakening it enough for Artus Cimbers return harnessing Ubtaos blessing and the Ring of Winter.\nWith the power of the ring, the battle was won and the Batiri threat dispersed. Mezros magical walls were taken down with the goblins gone, and the city pivoted from its isolationist existence. Along with the survivors, Sanda spent the following weeks rebuilding, restoring the damage and burying the dead. When the city was safe, Alisanda accompanied her new lover Artus to Cormyr after 1363 DR.\nMuch later, in the 15 century DR the city of Mezro was transported by the powers of Ubtao and the barae to a pocket dimension, away from the deadly dangers of the Spellplague and later, Ras Nsis undead legions. With Artus Cimber being left on Toril, Sanda promised him the city was to return to Chult once the existential threats to Mezro were gone. Unwilling to wait, Artus embarked on a quest to find a way to reunite with his wife during the time of the death curse."
