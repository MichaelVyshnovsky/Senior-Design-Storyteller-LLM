        "mainbody": "Marcoryl was a druid who lived in the Emerald Grove during the late 15 century DR.\nHe spent much of his time in the groves archives, surrounded by tomes and stone tablets that held wealths of information.\nIn , archdruid Halsin offered safe haven to a community of tieflings who were exiled from their home city of Elturel. When the tiefling child Arabella attempted to steal the idol of Silvanus from the groves altar, the druids were split as to what should be done with the girl. Marcoryl was of the opinion the young tiefling should be held captive and made to pay for her crime."
