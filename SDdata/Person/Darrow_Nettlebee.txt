Darrow Nettlebee was the second son of Bertram Nettlebee during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Darrow was a good-natured individual but his grandfathers words about inheritance made him worried about his future.
In 1491 DR, he was in the family ranch and welcomed with enthusiasm the adventurers whom his father and grandfather secretly wanted to entrap.
