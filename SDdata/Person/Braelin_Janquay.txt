Braelin Janquay was a drow scout within Jarlaxles Bregan Daerthe.
In 1313 DR Braelin was a young promising scout of commoner origin that Jarlaxle noticed and employed into his group.
In 1483 DR, Bregan Daerthe leader Jarlaxle met the reincarnated Regis and, despite not recognizing him, sent spies to report on him. Presumably, Braelin was one of these spies. Braelin discovered Regiss true identity, saved him from Ship Rethnor thugs, and reported on him and Catti-brie to Jarlaxle. He was also the one to report on Dahlia Sinfelles ascension to matron mother of House DoUrden.
Braelin was considered one of Bregan Daerthes most promising scouts.
Braelins Bregan Daerthe insignia enabled him to levitate. He wielded two swords, as well as a crossbow.
