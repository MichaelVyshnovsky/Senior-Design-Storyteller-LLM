'''Braelin Janquay''' was a [[drow]] scout within [[Jarlaxle]]'s [[Bregan D'aerthe]].

==History==
In [[1313 DR]] Braelin was a young promising scout of commoner origin that [[Jarlaxle]] noticed and employed into his group.
In [[1483 DR]], Bregan D'aerthe leader [[Jarlaxle]] met the reincarnated [[Regis]] and, despite not recognizing him, sent spies to report on him. Presumably, Braelin was one of these spies. Braelin discovered Regis's true identity, saved him from [[Ship Rethnor]] thugs, and reported on him and [[Catti-brie]] to Jarlaxle. He was also the one to report on [[Dahlia Sin'felle]]'s ascension to [[matron mother]] of [[House Do'Urden]].

==Skills==
Braelin was considered one of Bregan D'aerthe's most promising scouts.

==Possessions==
Braelin's Bregan D'aerthe insignia enabled him to [[levitate]]. He wielded two [[sword]]s, as well as a [[crossbow]].
