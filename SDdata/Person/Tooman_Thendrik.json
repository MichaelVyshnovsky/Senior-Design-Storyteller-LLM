        "Description": "Tooman maintained an unassuming appearance to hide his true allegiance. He dressed as a simple [[drow]] warrior.",
        "Personality": "As the leader of the outlawed cult of [[Ghaunadaur]], Tooman Thendrik was loathe to bring attention to himself unless drow society was under grave threat.",
        "Abilities": "An experienced [[cleric]] of Ghaundaur, Tooman had a strong command of [[divine magic]] and was able to cast spells like ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'' and ''[[forbiddance]]'' in defense of his deity. In addition to this, his proficiency with martial weapons was such that he could pass himself off as a drow warrior if need be.",
        "Activities": "Utilizing an abandoned merchant warehouse as a shrine to Ghaunadaur, Tooman led both [[humanoid]] and non-humanoid members of his cult in worship of [[Ghaunadaur|That Which Lurks]].",
        "Possessions": "Tooman carried [[magic]] [[studded leather armor]], [[shield]], and [[warhammer]] with him at all times and wore a ''[[periapt of wisdom]]'' that gave him great insight.",
        "History": "Tooman Thendrik rose to prominence among the low-class farmers and warriors of [[Szith Morcane]] during the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372 DR]]. He gathered both drow and non-drow worshipers under him and created a shrine to [[Ghaunadaur]] in one of the many abandoned merchant houses of Szith Morcane. However when followers of [[Kiaransalee]] took control of the outpost, he worked to undermine and destabilize their authority from the shadows.",
