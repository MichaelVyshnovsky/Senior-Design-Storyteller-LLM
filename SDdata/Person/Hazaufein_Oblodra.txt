Hazaufein Oblodra was the House Wizard of House Oblodra and Elderboy of Matron Mother Kyorl Odran circa 1358 DR.
Hazaufein was often mocked by his brother Drizfryn Oblodra, who said that his ability to craft was the result of being part-dwarf, but Hazaufein always accepted these jests with a wan smile.
Hazaufein was a very good crafter of magic items.
The position of house wizard was often given little consideration among the psionically powered Oblodras. Hazaufeins main duty was to create magical arms and armors for the houses warriors.
