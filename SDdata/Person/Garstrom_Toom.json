        "mainbody": "Garstrom Toom was a tracker, trader, and wagon driver that visited Eveningstar in Cormyr during the late 15 century DR.\nGarstrom had pale skin and light blond hair pulled and tied back. He carried a crossbow as a matter of course.\nAround the time of the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon, Garstrom was hired by the Harpers Kirinel Zay and Tarim Inavule to aid their ad-hoc adventurer agents. He used his exceptional skill in tracking to locate the secretive Thorngap druidic refuge, leading the Harpers to Thorn Hollow and then the Druids Deep, allowing them to neutralize the rogue druid Halsaime. Despite his contributions, he was not a Harper, just paid very well for his time."
