Mragan Gulther was a farmer in Red Larch circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. Mragan grew hornapples in an orchard just north of the town off the Long Road. The orchard could be found by turning east at Nurnaths big, green chicken barn onto the cart track that led to Old Angraths Smokehouse. The orchard occupied one side of the road and ran for almost a mile. On the other side of the road was pastureland owned by Indurr "Warsword" Stalnstern.
