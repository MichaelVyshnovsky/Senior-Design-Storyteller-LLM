'''Mragan Gulther''' was a farmer in [[Red Larch]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. Mragan grew [[hornapple]]s in an orchard just north of the town off the [[Long Road]]. The orchard could be found by turning east at [[Nurnath]]'s big, green chicken barn onto the cart track that led to [[Old Angrath's Smokehouse]]. The orchard occupied one side of the road and ran for almost a mile. On the other side of the road was pastureland owned by [[Indurr Stalnstern|Indurr "Warsword" Stalnstern]].{{Cite dragon/300/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Old Angrath's Smokehouse|84}}
