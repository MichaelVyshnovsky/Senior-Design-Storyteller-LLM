Joril Frostbeard was a mighty frost giant leader, who lived with his clan in a cavern within the Wyrms Tooth glacier atop the Spine of the World.
Jorils magical dagger was lost when he was killed by a group of adventurers. Some time later, the dagger reappeared in Kuldahar and was reforged there, so that it could be used by humans and human-sized creatures as a two-handed sword. When striking a target, it had a chance to confuse them.
