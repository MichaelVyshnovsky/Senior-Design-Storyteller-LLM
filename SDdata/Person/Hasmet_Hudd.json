Hasmet Hudd and his brother [[Giftu Hudd]] found their way to the city walls and were allowed to enter the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]], unlike many other refugees who were refused entrance due to lack of [[coin]] or paperwork. Giftu was happy to be protected by the city walls, confident they could withstand the Absolutist siege, but Hasmet thought that Baldur's Gate simply was not secure enough to withstand the Absolutist strike, thinking they should've continued moving even further out of the Absolute's way."
