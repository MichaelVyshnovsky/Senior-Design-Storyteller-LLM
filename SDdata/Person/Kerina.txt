'''Kerina''' was [[Korus Eikoth]]'s favourite slave. She lived in his tent, and often danced for him.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|70}}

==Personality==
Kerina spent most of her time weeping alone in her tent. She was frightened of strangers and would flee if anyone approached her; Korus had treated her cruelly, beating her whenever he felt like it.

==Rumors & Legends==
Kerina knew that Korus Eikoth dressed in dark robes every night, leaving the camp while the guards weren't looking, not returning before dawn. She had overheard Korus after he returned one afternoon, expressing his frustration with [[Thurnas Netmaster]]. She could share those things if treated with consistent kindness.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|71}}
