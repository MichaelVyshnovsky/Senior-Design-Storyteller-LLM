        "History": "Khelessa was a [[high elf]] from [[Silverymoon]]. She joined the Lords' Alliance and was tasked with the mission of infiltrating Menzoberranzan disguised as a [[drow]].\n\nIn the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, she stopped contacting her superiors.\n\nLater, however, she approached an expedition led by some adventurers hired by [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] to investigate the threat of a [[demon lord]] and told them about an ambush of a [[drow]] battalion against them."
