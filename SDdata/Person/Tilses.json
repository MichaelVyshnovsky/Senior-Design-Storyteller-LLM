After the city was pulled briefly down to the plane of [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]], all of the city's tieflings – including those in the Hellriders – were exiled from the city. Tilses joined Commander [[Zevlor]] as he led a group of his people west along the [[Risen Road]] towards [[Baldur's Gate]], and aided him as the group took refuge at the [[Emerald Grove]] [[druid]]ic enclave."
