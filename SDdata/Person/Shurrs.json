Rexins venom, once in the targets bloodstream, dealt damage to constitution. Like other familiars, Rexin shared an empathic link with her master. Handragath could channel magic and cast spells through his familiar. Rexin could speak to his master and other snakes.\nIn 1369 DR, Shurrs resided in Darnarests tower alongside Bishimzon and a small Cult of the Dragon slaver operation. Bishimzon, under Handragaths leadership, was capturing local villagers and able-bodied adventurers to send them through a portal in the towers basement to Myth Drannor, where they were doomed to work for the cult or be murdered and turned into undead servants."
