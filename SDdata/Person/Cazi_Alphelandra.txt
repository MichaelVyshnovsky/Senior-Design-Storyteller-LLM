Cazi Alphelandra was a wild elf giantslayer who roamed around the Savage Frontier in the late 15 century DR,
Cazi was a loud, boastful woman that liked to wield large weaponry.
Cazi carried around a huge, custom-made bow by the name of "Large Banta," that she was quite skilled with despite its size. It was designed specifically to aid her in the fighting of dragons and giants.
Cazi was a member of the giantslayer organization Hook, Line, and Sinker.
