'''Therion Gers''' was the first [[human]] [[arcanist]].

==History==
When the humans of [[Netheril]] began trading with the [[Earlanni]] elves, Therion became the first to learn to learn the ways and trade of magic. After around a year of training, he was able to cast the magic necessary to start a fire. Two years later, he had risen to the third most important position in Netheril, after [[Nether the Younger]] and the shaman [[Spiritsummoner]].
