Therion Gers was the first human arcanist.
When the humans of Netheril began trading with the Earlanni elves, Therion became the first to learn to learn the ways and trade of magic. After around a year of training, he was able to cast the magic necessary to start a fire. Two years later, he had risen to the third most important position in Netheril, after Nether the Younger and the shaman Spiritsummoner.
