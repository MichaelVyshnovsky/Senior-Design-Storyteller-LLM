Pang Wallen was a member of the Baldurs Gate branch of the Iron Throne during the midâ€“14 century DR.
When Sarevok took control of the Baldurian Iron Throne, following the death of Rieltar Anchev in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, Pang left the merchants group and the city for good. He believed the new leader of the organization had run their business into the ground, having no real care for profits or wealth.
