Ren Ferkins was the mayor of Dagger Falls around 1479 DR.
Ren was a very patriotic man.
In 1479 DR, after an increase in raids by gnolls, he discussed with the constable the option of hiring a group of Zhent mercenaries to clear the area.
Later, Ren assembled the Zhentarim commander and an adventuring party hired by Kendar Morn for a meeting to decide the best option.
