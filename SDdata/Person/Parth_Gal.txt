Parth Gal was a Shadovar soldier and leader of a reconnaissance team that served Prince Escanor Tanthul of Thultanthar during the late 14 century DR.
He had eyes the color of topaz.
Parth was something of a coward, allowing others to venture ahead of himself and his scouts.
He led a reconnaissance force composed of a dozen Shadovar, including Balpor, Carlig, and Elar
The Shadovar reconnaissance team each wore horned helmets that protected them from phaerimm mind-control.
In the , Parth and his reconnaissance patrol accompanied the Vaasan warrior Vala Thorsdotter on mission within the depths of the Irithlium in ruined Myth Drannor. Nearly half of Parths squad were killed before encountering a single phaerimm.
After Vala went ahead of the Shadovar, and single-handedly killed a phaerimm without their aid, Parth and the rest of his scouts fell cone-shaped darts that shout out of the walls beneath the ruined elven tower.
