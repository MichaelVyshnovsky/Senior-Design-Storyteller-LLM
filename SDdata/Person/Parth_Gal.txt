'''Parth Gal''' was a [[Shadovar]] soldier and leader of a reconnaissance team that served Prince [[Escanor Tanthul]] of [[Thultanthar]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|It was once a magic school, which naturally attracted the [[phaerimm]]. The upper layers seem to have been stripped bare, but there are least six phaerimm lairing somewhere beneath the foundations.|Parth Gal, to [[Vala Thorsdotter]].}}

==Description==
He had eyes the color of [[topaz]].

==Personality==
Parth was something of a coward, allowing others to venture ahead of himself and his scouts.

==Relationships==
He led a reconnaissance force composed of a dozen Shadovar, including [[Balpor]], [[Carlig (Shadovar)|Carlig]], and [[Elar]]

==Possessions==
The Shadovar reconnaissance team each wore horned helmets that protected them from phaerimm mind-control.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Parth and his reconnaissance patrol accompanied the [[Vaasan]] warrior [[Vala Thorsdotter]] on mission within the depths of the [[Irithlium]] in ruined [[Myth Drannor]]. Nearly half of Parth's squad were killed before encountering a single [[phaerimm]].

After Vala went ahead of the Shadovar, and single-handedly killed a phaerimm without their aid, Parth and the rest of his scouts fell cone-shaped darts that shout out of the walls beneath the ruined elven tower.
