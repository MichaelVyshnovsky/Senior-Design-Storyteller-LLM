SEER was the codename of Yi Lao, During the 1480s DR, SEER hired many groups of adventurers to combat the various schemes of giants following the breaking of the Ordning.
SEER had golden-brown skin. Her hair was black, and her eyes were brown. 
SEER wore blue robes
SEER had an elderly, maternal personality
SEER was a significantly powerful mage Some of the spells she knew were haste and mage armor. She could also predict the future with portents. 
She could speak to and understand birds. 
SEER could also make potions of giant strength from the toenails of hill giants.
SEER had a large collection of magical trinkets, including a silver platter that had a magical symbol in the shape of a teacup on it. When someone examined the symbol, they were instantly teleported to a destination of her choosing. She carried a silver-colored staff with a decoration of a crane at its top.
She operated out of a personal demiplane in which she had her octagonal study and a small garden. The study was filled with bird perches and the garden had a koi pond.
SEER had once owned a jade dagger that formerly belonged to an uncle of hers. It had her crest on it. She left it behind in Durlags Tower.
SEERs mint tea was made to a secret family recipe from Kara-Tur.
SEER sought to protect the town of Parnast from Bad Fruul.
She often served mint tea and cookies to those who visited her.
She used birds to receive information from and send information to her agents.
Hsing was SEERs pseudodragon familiar, whom she often sent on missions for her. He called her his Mistress and he could often be found resting on her shoulders. She could communicate telepathically with him.
Once adventuring companions, after SEER left Bitter-root at Durlags Tower, she came to resent SEER for not rescuing her. In truth, SEER did care about her friend.
Baron Rajiram was a foe of SEER, and they had encountered each other in the past. Decades after that encounter, he offered a reward of 3,000 gold pieces to the assassins Bahldrak and Bellegia Slagspit if they killed any of her agents.
SEER was known to work with the Order of the Gauntlet and had contact with Zern Xerkstil.
SEER was a noble.
SEER had a history with the cloud giant warlord Baron Rajiram, and had encountered him with her companion Bitter-root. SEER had been sent with allies of the Lords Alliance on a mission to Durlags Tower. However, all the members of this mission but SEER and Bitter-root were killed by the nalfeshnee Schvalt. When Bitter-root was possessed by another nalfeshnee, Blelthnol, she begged SEER to leave her in a grove of trees near Durlags Tower.
SEER had spent some time tracking a headband of intellect containing the soul of Narcellia Varammyr, which was difficult as the headband magically prevented its wearer from being scried on. In the 1480s DR, when the Cult of the Dragon attempted to summon Tiamat, the wearer of the headband destroyed a statue of Angharradh in Parnast. At this point, SEER lost the trail of the headband. 
In order to draw the wearer of the headband out again, SEER manipulated Chandra Stol in Parnast to commission a new statue of Angharradh. She also helped an artisan in Anauroch to create one.
In a room of the Weary Giant in Stagwick, SEER cared for Emilia Marblehead a dwarf member of the Frostbite Platoon. Emilia had recently survived an attack by ogres at the Birthright Stones in the Ice Spires. SEER hired adventurers to rescue the Frostbite Platoon and deliver a stone tablet that the dwarves had discovered there to her.
SEER, having heard of the location of the ruins of the tower that had once belonged to the Wizard of the Crag, determined through scrying that a group of adventurers had discovered the ruins already. She sent Hsing to hire the adventurers to recover works from the library of the Wizard. SEER interpreted these magical works and created a ritual to magically scry on Bad Fruul, who wore the headband of intellect containing containing the soul of Narcellia that prevented him from being scried by normal means.
At the Red Sheaf in Beregost, SEER met with adventurers. She tasked them with intercepting an impending attack on Durlags Tower by Baron Rajiram. She also warned them of the dwarf mercenary twins Bahldrak and Bellegia Slagspit. She also asked the adventurers to rescue her old companion Bitter-root from the Tower, and gave them Bitter-roots holy symbol of Angharradh. After the briefing, she teleported the adventurers to the Tower.
SEER also organized for adventurers to meet with Hsing and disrupt a potential alliance between Bad Fruul and Gralm in the Lonely Moor.
When Jarl Ryndölg amassed a force of Ice Spire ogres, SEER sought more information about his axe Øksavmakt. She visited Kryshilir, of the Seven Stones. She convinced him to help by giving directions to the location of Hotun-Shûl. About a tenday later, she sent adventurers to meet Kryshilir, travel to Hotun-Shûl, and research Øksavmakt.
At the end of summer, still operating from the Weary Giant in Stagwick, SEER worked alongside Uli to hire adventurers to again investigate Ryndölg, whom she correctly suspected of having found Hartkillers Horn.
Still researching giants, SEER and Hsing investigated the ruins of the Ulcaster School of Wizardry. She discovered a document that detailed the location of a secret library of Ulcaster and how to perform the ritual titled Oghmas Gifts. The pair were then attacked by undead. SEER became charmed by the vampire Levanna, and Hsing returned to Feldeposts Inn in Beregost and hired adventurers to rescue her. The adventurers rescued Ulcaster from his tomb, and fought against Levanna. In the fight, the charmed SEER fought against her rescuers to aid Levanna. Levanna escaped, breaking the effect on SEER, who entered an unconcious meditative state to heal.
As the adventurers left with SEER and Ulcaster, the ruins were attacked by a flying pirate ship belonging to Baron Rajiram. SEER deduced that the pirates had been sent to recover notes on runes that were stored in Ulcasters secret library, stored inside a demiplane. She again hired adventurers, and sent the young wizard Tenos with them so that they could access the demiplane.
Continuing to trail Bad Fruul, SEER realised that Narcellias soul in his headband was convincing him to attack Parnast in order to kill Chandra Stol. She realised that this was because Chandra was related to Luistarra Stollereil, the elf whod imprisoned Narcellia in the headband. From her office, she hired adventurers from Parnast to save the town from Bad Fruuls attack, and to save Chandra. She also wanted the adventurers help in convincing Raggnar Redtooth or Gundalin to let Parnast into the Lords Alliance.
Later, back in Hartsvale, she worked with Grauman Hartwick. The pair hired adventurers to travel to the Ice Spires and confront Jarl Ryndölg, who was hunting the Beast of Talos and had used Hartkillers Horn to summon Hartkiller.
Later, SEER was interrupted by a group of adventurers that suddenly arrived in her presence through a portal. The adventurers had been sent through time from a tenday into the future, when they had already been hired by a future version of SEER. The time portal had been created when the adventurers touched the temporally unstable Eye of Xxiphu. The portal remained open for twelve hours, which allowed SEER to again send adventurers through it, to a period of time a tenday into the future.
After the tenday passed naturally for SEER, her body had begun to visibly age, due to the power of the Eye of Xxiphu, the strain of keeping the portal open, and a powerful pearl at the heart of the isle of the morkoth Mwarien. This isle was being besieged by Dworkin, a follower of her old foe Baron Rajiram. Dworkin wished to recover the Eye of Xxiphu. In order to stop this, SEER sent adventurers to the isle—the adventurers that would later travel through time and that she had already encountered. She equipped them with some of a variety of magical items, and sent them there on the backs of bronze dragons. After the epic encounter, SEER arrived at the isle, on a ship sent by the Lords Alliance, hoping to recover the Eye of Xxiphu.
Following this, SEER hired a number of adventurers to travel to the Greypeak Mountains in a caravan and enter the lair of Baron Krelas Ulgarak and destroy his inferno bombards. She also led adventurers into Durlags Tower, and raised his ancient flying ship the Ark of the Mountains against Baron Rajirams Thunderbound in an epic sky battle.
