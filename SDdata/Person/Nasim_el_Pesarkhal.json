In this position, he directly controlled the black marketeers, and began buying and selling with sources in the [[Underdark]], which boosted earnings for the family by 50% over only a few years. He also controlled the enforcers and thugs in the city.\n\nNasim was raised by his older brother like a son, and the two of them together were responsible indirectly for the assassinations of more than one hundred people during the syl-pasha's rise to power in the late 1360s [[DR]].\n\nNasim's [[half-elven]] wife, [[Nureh el Pesarkhal|Nureh]], was the spymaster of el Pesarkhal family.<ref>",
