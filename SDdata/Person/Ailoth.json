        "Personality": "Not overly intelligent, Ailoth's activities as a spy did not go unnoticed by the governments of Sembia and Hillsfar who were aware to his true work.",
        "History": "The Red Wizard arrived in Sembia around [[1337 DR]]. After some time Ailoth broke with Alzegund to start a private business, but this was a facade to cover his work as a Thayan spy under his master.\n\nIn 1357 DR, Ailoth was known as a moneylender and the buyer of thieves goods. In truth, he was gathering information from a network of spies and giving information to his master when he and Alzegund were in the same city."
