        "mainbody": "'''Bellodar I''' was the king of [[Impiltur]] during the late 6{{th}} and early 7{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. He ruled for over a third of a century, from the [[588 DR|Year of the Dragons Dawning, 588 DR]], until the [[626 DR|Year of the Eagle and the Falcon, 626 DR]].",
        "History": "King Bellodar I was assassinated by the nobles of [[Orbil|House Orbil]], who attempted to seize the Golden Throne for their own. While the rebellion was squashed to savage effect, the rule of Impiltur remained within the [[Durlarven Dynasty]] as the king's son [[Bellodar II]] took the crown."
