'''Slinker''' was a young and  affable [[human]] [[thief]] from [[Freedale]] who made himself name adventuring with [[Lordan]] the Pure, [[Delvar Ironfist]], [[Morganth]] the Mysterious, [[Beldar]] the Brave, and [[Silverleaf Halfmoon]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Slinker was a young tall, lanky human with black curly hair and a lean physique.

==Personality==
Apart from his charismatic personality, Slinker was boastful and clumsy to a fault. He took bets and tried to achieve almost impossible tasks, like trying to jump through a window opening while blindfolded, only to completely miss it and tumble on the floor.

==Abilities==
Like other individuals of the same vocation, Slinker was proficient in pickpocketing, lock-picking, detecting and disarming traps, climbing, hiding in shadows, and silent step.

==Possessions==
Slinker usually wore his [[leather armor]] and a [[backpack]], filled to the brim with thievery tools, sacks, [[torch]]es. He was armed with a [[short sword]], and a [[bow]].

==Relationships==
Slinker was a charmer, and everyone in the hamlet of Freedale knew him well. The young thief's best friend and trusted informant in town was [[One-Arm McGinty]] of the [[Red Dragon Tavern]]. Slinker could often be found in the tavern gossiping with the friendly barkeep.

==History==
[[File:Slinker and hobgoblin.png|thumb|''Slinker in trouble, menaced by a [[hobgoblin]].''|306x306px]]
Sometime in the mid 14-{{th}} century DR, Slinker resided in the hamlet of Freedale, just to the southwest from the village of Shadowdale. Everyone knew Slinker in the building. Eventually, he joined a few other individuals to form an adventuring party to travel to the little-known nearby [[Tomb of Damara]] on a rescue mission. The seer of Freedale, [[Netheril (person)|Netheril]] asked the heroes to find his missing apprentice. The apprentice was the [[elf]] named [[Taran Goldenstar]] who was searching for a ''singing orb'' (''[[orb of dragonkind]]'') in the old ruins.

In ruins, the adventurers came across [[hobgoblin]]s who were after the same treasure and captured the elf, torturing him for information. Slinker and his party managed to free the apprentice [[wizard]], defeat the [[ogre]] [[Bonegnasher]] who made the ruins his home, and recovered the artifact for the seer.

As Slinker's group grew a bit more confident, they decided to embark on a daring adventure to investigate the haunted mansion, the [[Harrow Hill]], once the home of a powerful wizard [[Gunter]]. The unlucky heroes became trapped inside the mansion and hunted by the [[ghost]] of its former mad owner. The heroes outwitted the undead wizard and destroyed him with [[silver]]ed weapons.

Confident in their skills, Slinker and his friends descended into the cave system under [[Mount Dread]] to the south from the village. They, of course, survived another adventure and were ready for more.
