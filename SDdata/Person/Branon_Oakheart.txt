'''Branon Oakheart''' was a traveling merchant and a [[druid]] of [[Silvanus]] who briefly settled in the city of [[Hillsfar]] ''circa'' [[1373 DR]].

==Description==
Branon was a huge muscular [[human]] man who appeared to be in his thirties as of 1373 DR. His powerful body was hidden underneath well-worn traveler's [[robe]]s. He was armed with a simple [[oak]]en [[staff]]. Despite his size and physique, his face and body language advertised a calm demeanor and inner peace.

==Relationships==
Branon Oakheart's trusted [[animal companion]] was his [[Astral Plane|astral]] [[dire wolf]] [[Cassius (wolf)|Cassius]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Branon Oakheart was a recent arrival in Hillsfar from the forest of [[Cormanthor]]. He was one of the very few outsiders allowed shelter and entrance to the city during the raging [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] crisis. Branon and his companion Cassius were ambushed by a gaggle of [[fiend]]s summoned by the Order of the Crippled Fang. Cassius distracted the creatures, allowing his friend to escape. The druid assumed his animal companion perished in the process, not realizing that Cassius was an astral creature summoned by a ''[[figurine of wondrous power]]''. Branon reached the safety of civilization and ended up locked within the city walls. The druid's healing abilities and his abundant stock of magical trinkets, [[scroll]]s, and [[potion]]s guaranteed him a spot in the market square of Hillsfar. Another outsider allowed into Hillsfar was a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] who opened a stall selling [[enchanted]] items across the plaza from Branon. The two quickly developed an antagonistic relationship.
