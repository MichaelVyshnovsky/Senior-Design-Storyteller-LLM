Branon Oakheart was a traveling merchant and a druid of Silvanus who briefly settled in the city of Hillsfar circa 1373 DR.
Branon was a huge muscular human man who appeared to be in his thirties as of 1373 DR. His powerful body was hidden underneath well-worn travelers robes. He was armed with a simple oaken staff. Despite his size and physique, his face and body language advertised a calm demeanor and inner peace.
Branon Oakhearts trusted animal companion was his astral dire wolf Cassius.
In the , Branon Oakheart was a recent arrival in Hillsfar from the forest of Cormanthor. He was one of the very few outsiders allowed shelter and entrance to the city during the raging Order of the Crippled Fang crisis. Branon and his companion Cassius were ambushed by a gaggle of fiends summoned by the Order of the Crippled Fang. Cassius distracted the creatures, allowing his friend to escape. The druid assumed his animal companion perished in the process, not realizing that Cassius was an astral creature summoned by a figurine of wondrous power. Branon reached the safety of civilization and ended up locked within the city walls. The druids healing abilities and his abundant stock of magical trinkets, scrolls, and potions guaranteed him a spot in the market square of Hillsfar. Another outsider allowed into Hillsfar was a Red Wizard of Thay who opened a stall selling enchanted items across the plaza from Branon. The two quickly developed an antagonistic relationship.
