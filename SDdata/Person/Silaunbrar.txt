Silaunbrar was a paladin of Torm and one of the "next generation" of lords who sat on the governing council of Impiltur during the late-14 century DR.
As the younger members of Impilturs Council of Lords, Silaunbrar and his comrade Engarth played considerable roles in the rearing of Crown-prince Imbrar II as a young paladin of the realm. Together they curried significant favor with him, prior to his coronation in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR.
