'''Silaunbrar''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Torm]] and one of the "next generation" of lords who sat on the [[Lords of Imphras II|governing council]] of [[Impiltur]] during the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}

As the younger members of Impiltur's Council of Lords, Silaunbrar and his comrade Engarth played considerable roles in the rearing of [[Imbrar II|Crown-prince Imbrar II]] as a young paladin of the realm. Together they curried significant favor with him, prior to his coronation in the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]].
