[[Orchtrien]] was a [[gold dragon]] and the king of [[Dawnfire]] during the [[Time of Dragons]], up to the 251{{st}} century before [[DR]].
{{quote|Nonsense. All the hostages are rebels at heart, or at least they started out that way. That's why we caged them here, to subdue them. By gentler means than we usually employ, but still. You've managed the first stage admirably, and now that the wars are done until spring, I'll undertake the next.|King Orchtrien of Dawnfire to Rhespen Ash, his deputy{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|21-22}}}}

==Description==
The huge dragon smelled faintly of [[saffron]]. When in [[elven]] form, he had bronze skin, golden eyes, and blonde hair.

==Personality==
King Orchtrien was perhaps best defined by a combination of magnanimity, good cheer, extreme overconfidence, and reckless disregard of others' feelings. He was quick to be merciful to traitors, and put his own mercy over the needs and wants of his own closest advisors,{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|9-11}} then consider their own grudge satisfied by his own decree despite denying them a killing blow.{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|14-15}} He also ignored one of his advisors' confession that he had fallen in love with one of the traitors and his request that the king not involve himself romantically with her,{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|23-24}} instead sending that advisor in what amounted to a suicide mission,{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|25}} then informing him that he'd taken her as a lover just before the man returned victorious.{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|35-36}} Even when visiting his own closest advisors turned traitors in a torture chamber, he remained polite, cheerful, kind, and honest, an egregious disconnect.{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|51-53}}

==Abilities==
Of note, the dragon had the ability to assume [[human]] form, as most of his kind did. He also had the ability to hover in place effortlessly.

He likely had a spell that augmented the flames he could breathe out. Another of his spells prevented extradimensional egress, in the manner of ''[[dimensional lock]]''. Yet another of Orchtrien's spells created a dome of rainbows, very much like ''[[prismatic sphere]]'', except it could cover a stronghold-sized area, and last all night, probably longer.{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|61-63}} Other spells of his could [[animate breath|animate]] his [[breath weapon]] and make people's blood [[Burning blood (necromancy)|turn into burning venom]] within their veins. Finally, one of the dragon's spells created a blazing white mobile flame that could extinguish spells, even a ''[[black blade of disaster]]''.{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|64-67}}

==Possessions==
The city of Dawnfire was widely seen as being his palace.{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|40}} and one summoned [[ghargatula]].{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|43}} In them, he had an immense collection of texts, spells, and wards, some of which included a treatise on the relationship between dragons and the fundamental forces of the universe.{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|68}}

==Activities==
Being a King, Orchtrien performed such activities as ruling his subjects and waging war.

==Relationships==
Orchtrien had a son named [[Bexendral]] and a number of other sons, including many "bastards". The half-dragons of Dawnfire were all engendered either by the king or by his sons. His rivals included the [[red triumvirate]]. and the [[green cabal]].

''Circa'' {{yearlink|-25090}}; the elf [[Rhespen Ash]] and the human [[Maldur Breakstone]] served Orchtrien as his deputies; Rhespen had served the king for over a century as of that date. 

==History==
In −25,090 DR, Orchtrien, already centuries old, was engaged in a number of skirmishes against other dragons, including the red triumvirate and the green cabal; these battles had extended for years at that point, being characterized even by his supporters as "perpetually" and "year after year". While he was in an engagement southeast of Dawnfire, a number of rebellious [[elven]] houses set up an ambush for his own soldiers, calling on their aid against [[troll]]s. A force led by his deputy Rhespen Ash sallied forth to defend against the trolls, only to get caught in the ambush. His son Bexendral ''[[teleport]]ed'' to quell the rebels, saving Rhespen's life. Afterwards, conferring with his deputies, Orchtrien decided to be merciful with the rebels, and have their heirs over as his guests, esquires, and hostages, to better ensure their continuing loyalty. He assigned Rhespen to watch over them and ensure their comfort.

During a feast celebrating a recent victory over the red triumvirate, Orchtrien called on [[Winterflower Duskmere]], one of the hostages, to sing. She sang a song relating the story of a mad king who inflicted calamity on his subjects through misrule; this resulted in his deputy Maldur striking her with a fist spell. She denied any intent to offend, and as the king's deputy Rhespen Ash took her side, Orchtrien commanded that Rhespen and Maldur battle each other for celebratory entertainment, so as to settle the quarrel they'd held for years. Before Rhespen was able to strike the final blow, Orchtrien considered their quarrel over, and bid them work harmoniously together forevermore.

At a later date during or before winter, in preparation for another celebration, this time over the green cabal's warriors, Orchtrien called upon Rhespen Ash to prepare Lady Winterflower to sing again, requesting in advance that the song be less suggestive.{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|17-19}} During the celebration itself, he commented to Rhespen that he intended to seduce Lady Winterflower, finding the scent of treason in her all the more enticing. He also gave Winterflower a bracelet in the shape of a gold wyrm, wrapped in a spiral shape. After the celebration, Rhespen asked Orchtrien not to seduce Winterflower, and instead seek his entertainment elsewhere, because he was in love with her. Orchtrien agreed to comport himself accordingly.

The king then ordered Rhespen Ash to fight a battle on the lands of the green cabal through the winter months.{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|26-27}} as fighting that dragon himself would have escalated the conflict beyond his designs. By his return in early spring, Rhespen Ash had slain that dragon alone. Orchtrien held him in great esteem for that, and had Maldur break him the news, prior to his arrival, that Winterflower was now Orchtrien's own mistress, as well as deliver fresh mounts and clothes.{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|33-34}} During the celebration itself, Rhespen asked the dragon why he did not respond to the summons. The dragon claimed, falsely, that no message had reached him. Orchtrien then promoted Rhespen to one of his chief marshals.

Orchtrien later learned the newly minted chief marshal had copied his spellbooks, which had been taken by Winterflower before she disappeared. Visiting the captured elf in the torture chamber, the dragon learned Winterflower had made Rhespen believe that the King controlled her mind. He explained that her plan was almost certainly to turn Rhespen against him so he'd slay him somehow, and that she'd convinced Orchtrien himself that she'd fallen for the dragon king, probably to improve her position for spying or a possible regicide. He then decided to leave Rhespen where he was.

The dragon marched his army into the forest where House [[Duskmere]] lived, but found their residences empty, requiring a thorough search of the forest for their hideaway.{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|55}} Once the dragon found the hideout, he cast a few spells to prevent their escape, and retrieved his army, which arrived by dusk. He was then confronted by Rhespen Ash, who'd managed to find the stronghold not long before he did, and turned completely over to the rebel cause. Orchtrien prevailed in their combat, the stronghold was sacked, and the books retrieved, save one carried away by Lady Winterflower Duskmere, a treatise on the connection between dragons and the fundamental forces of the world.

In {{yearlink|-25000}}, King Orchtrien was witnessing a comet's passage from his palace when he was struck by [[Rage of Dragons|a bout of maddened bloodthirst]], leading him to attack a flirty courtesan, and then the rest of his palace, before turning on his own army in an orgy of death. As he was slain, Orchtrien realized what he'd done, and only managed to whisper "the red star murdered me." Thus it was known as the [[King-Killer Star]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Whether she genuinely believed so or not, Winterflower Duskmere claimed that King Orchtrien and his kin were mind-controlling rapists.
