        "mainbody": "Fadahl al-Araj, also called Fadahl the Crippled and previously Fadahl the Enlightened, served as vizier for the House of Tayif tribe in the High Desert of west Zakhara around 1367 DR.\nFadahls knowledge of the desert and hatred for those who harmed him served his Sheikh well.\nFadahl was once a sage in Hiyal. An incident with the Sultana resulted in his legs getting crushed as his punishment. He left the city for Qudra where he begged for food on the streets until, as Fate would have it, he had a chance meeting with Mouli during his escape from the city.\nFadahl was almost always riding atop his treasured flying carpet, which was a gift from Mouli for his services and friendship."
