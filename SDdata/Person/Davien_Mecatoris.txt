Lord Davien Mecatoris was the scion of House Mecatoris of Sambral, one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond, as of 1479 DR.
Davien was the son of Lady Althea Mecatoris.
Davien was the leader of Flashing Blade at Dusk Troupe, a troupe of vigilantes that patrolled the city of Sambral.
Some time before 1479 DR, Davien converted to the faith of Tempus.
In 1479 DR, Davien was kidnapped by the Cult of Reborn Flame and sacrificed to the primordial Achazar. He survived the experience, however, and was rescued by Sambrals authorities.
