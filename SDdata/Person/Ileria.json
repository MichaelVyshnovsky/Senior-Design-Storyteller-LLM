        "mainbody": "Ileria was a half-elf cleric that volunteered to join the to-be Heroes of Waterdeep circa 1358 DR.\nIn 1358 DR, the cleric and comrades journeyed underneath Waterdeep to fight evil and bring good. However, they were overwhelmed in such an environment, and most of them were killed. If the cleric was resurrected, Ileria stated that they had been given another chance to carry on their mission of good, all due to their faith. Ileria volunteered to join the adventurers in their quest to slay Xanathar."
