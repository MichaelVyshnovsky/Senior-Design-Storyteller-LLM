        "mainbody": "'''Calliope''' was a [[dark naga]] who served as chief adviser and a consort of [[Pristoleph|Pristoleph the Purple]], the eventual [[Ransar]] of [[Innarlith]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Like many people who surrounded Pristoleph the Purple, Calliope was ambitious and power-hungry.",
        "History": "By [[1370 DR]], Calliope was serving Pristoleph as a trusted adviser and a lover who supported him in his rise to power via elimination of his adversaries and through complicated plots and schemes. [[Mandalax|Mandalax the Mighty]] was Pristoleph's main and fiercest opponent. Both men served as personal [[wizard]]s of Innarlith's then ransar, [[Aubrin Ravilis]].\n\nBy [[1373 DR]], there were rumors that Calliope spawned a clutch of dark naga children deep in [[Chondalwood]]. Her spawn could be found infesting the catacombs of [[Pristal Towers]] in Innarlith, where they matured to adulthood. These young [[naga]]s notably possessed limbs, actually [[yuan-ti]] arms grafted on them by Pristoleph himself.\n\nBy [[1375 DR]], Pristoleph the Purple rose to the status of Ransar with Calliope still at his side."
