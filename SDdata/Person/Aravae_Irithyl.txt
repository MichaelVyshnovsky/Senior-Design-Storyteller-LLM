Aravae Irithyl was the lost heiress of the coronal Eltargrim Irithyl and the first sign of the Fall of Myth Drannor.
Born in 146 DR, Aravae was tutored from birth by the Srinshee and a select group of elder priests of elven and human gods (notably Corellon, Sehanine, Eldath, and Mystra) to be the heir of Irithyl and the new coronal. In time, she became a wonderful woman gifted with many skills in magic and diplomacy.
Shortly after 261 DR, with the Srinshees support, Aravae secretly went to adventure in the Realms with a group of friends including Josidiah Starym. Thanks to a magic simulacrum, everyone believed her she was studying in her house.
She assisted her great-uncle Eltargrim before his passing. After Eltargrims death in 661 DR, many pressured her to crown herself as the new coronal but, heartbroken, she decided on a five-year-long time of mourning like ancient traditions dictated (in truth, she hoped for the return of Josidiah).
However in 664 DR, Aravae and her bodyguards were killed by unknown assailants, ending both the line of the house of Irithyl and the time of coronals in Myth Drannor.
Aravae loved only one one man in her life, Josidiah Starym, and only the Srinshee knew this. She always hoped to marry him, reforging the bond with the Starym but Josidiah went to adventure in search of the missing AryVelahrKerym (elfblade) and Aravae promised to await his return.
By the time of her death, Aravae was well loved by many in Myth Drannor. Thyaast Ammath, a prodigy in magical arts of House Ammath, grieved the death of the Coronal Heiress, but she was hopeful for the next ruler and the citys bright future.
