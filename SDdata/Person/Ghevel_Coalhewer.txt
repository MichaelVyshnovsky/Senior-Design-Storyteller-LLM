Ghevel Coalwhever was a duergar boatman in Gracklstugh during the Silence of Lolth.
In 1372 DR, Ghevel was hired by the drow party of Quenthel Baenre and Pharaun Mizzrym to travel the Darklake. When duergar authorities tried to arrest the drow group, fearing they had discovered the plan for the Siege of Menzoberranzan, Pharaun magically compelled Ghevel to flee the city. The drow abandoned Ghevel and his boat when they had escaped. It is unknown what happened to him.
