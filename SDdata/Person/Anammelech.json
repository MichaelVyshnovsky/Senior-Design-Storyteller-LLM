        "mainbody": "Anammelech was a Talontar blightlord operating in the Rawlinswood as of .\nHe had empty eye sockets that built up slime\nAnnamelech was vindictive,, covetous, overconfident, and a bit of a jokester.\nAnammelech could use ooze mephits as extensions of his will. He could also transport himself through the ooze left behind by his mephits. Fire had no power over him, and he was capable of moving without shifting his weight, leaving behind a trail of slime. Finally, he could engulf his foes with his amorphous body.\nIn , Anammelech was sought out by Gloomgate, which teleported towards him once Gameliel was disintegrated. He learned of Marrec and Ususi Manaallins party, as well as Araluen. Though he managed to split Ususi and Marrec from Gunggari Ulmarra and Elowen, almost slaying the first two, Marrec barely managed to defeat him by employing his petrifying gaze against the blightlord just as the latter was about to personally engulf him.\nAnammelech coveted Gameliels Gloomgate, and he planned on taking revenge on Damanda for past slights. He cultivated the patronage of the Nentyar hunter Fallon, eventually turning him into betraying the Nentyarch."
