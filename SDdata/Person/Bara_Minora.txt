Bara Minora was a halfling who worked and cared for Hama Sayif within the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Bara played her drums while Hama performed his mystical dances. She also took care off all haggling for Hamas customers.
Baras mate was Sika al-Bana.
Bara had been with Hama ever since he saved the lives of she and her mate in Al-Akara Mountains.
Hama once cursed Bara with the evil eye when he caught her lifting the purse from one of his customers.
