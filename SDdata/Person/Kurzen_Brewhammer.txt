Kurzen Brewhammer was a dwarven warrior and adventurer and a member of the Blue Wyverns adventuring company of Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the late 15 century DR.
When not adventuring, Kurzen helped his father, Tharzon Brewhammer, run the Smoke Wyrm tavern. Kurzen was knowledgeable about the ancient dwarven ruins of Sarbreen beneath Ravens Bluff, knowledge that proved invaluable during the Blue Wyverns mission to retrieve the Sarkonagael, a tome of shadow magic.
