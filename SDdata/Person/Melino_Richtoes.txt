Melino Richtoes was the mayor of Shoun in 1367 DR.
Melino was an exceedingly greedy person before he found religion.
In addition to holding the title of mayor, Melino was the richest merchant in the city thanks to his lucrative dairy business.
Melino was a common thief during his youth, but changed his ways to the teachings of Yondalla, though he still used some of his rogue skills later in life to deal with political rivals.
Melino owned a magical dagger.
