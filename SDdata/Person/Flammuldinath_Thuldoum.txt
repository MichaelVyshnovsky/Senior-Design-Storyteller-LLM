Flammuldinath "Firefingers" Thuldoum was a mage in Thentia in  and in .
As of 1373 DR, to Taegan Nightwind, Firefingers looked like "some fortunate childs doting grandfather" he was stooped, wrinkled, had a white beard, and wore robes of scarlet, orange, and gold.
Firefingers was the teacher of Maganus. He came to him just before the Time of Troubles the tutor found him even then wizened before his years and full of anger. The sorceresses Jannatha Goldenshield and Baerimel Dunnath were also trained by him.
Firefingers was one of the mages in Thentia assisting Karasendrieths party in decoding Sammasters notes about the Rage of Dragons in 1373 DR. He also may have told the Hero of Daggerford what he knew of Maganus that same year.
