'''Holfast Harpenshield''' was a retired adventurer who ran the [[White Hart Inn]] in [[Ashabenford]], [[Mistledale]], around [[1372 DR]].

He gladly served all good folk who came to the inn. As he enjoyed the company of adventurers, Holfast freely shared information and advice with those passing through his inn. However, he was known for sporadically throwing out merchants from [[Sembia]] or the [[Moonsea]], depending on whether or not he liked their demeanor.
