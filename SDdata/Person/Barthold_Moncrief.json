        "mainbody": "'''Barthold Moncrief''' was one of the Magistrates of [[Cormyr]], who performed work in the towns of [[Eveningstar]] and [[Wheloon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Barthold was a [[human]] man with a light skin tone, hair and beard bleached with age, and icy blue eyes. He wore quality [[robe]]s of the Magistrates.",
        "Activities": "Barthold worked at the [[Wheloon Docks]] alongside Magistrates [[Abella Toth]], [[Celia Pendrick]], and [[Cornelius Latrimor]] as they oversaw the operations of the prison and investigated criminals.",
        "History": "In the 1480s DR,{{DDO-time}} Barthold was joined by Magistrates Abella and Celia as they investigated the [[Sharran]] escapee [[Dedryk Black]] in Eveningstar. They hired a band of adventurers from the world of [[Eberron]], and tasked them with searching for a suspected [[Sharran hideout (Storm Horns|Sharran hideout]] in the foothills of the [[Storm Horns]], with Magistrate Abella Toth leading the investigation. When the infamous Dedryk Black and his cronies were captured, Magistrate Barthold Moncrief took over and supervised the prisoners' transportation via [[Wheloon Prison boat|river boat]] back to [[Wheloon]] for imprisonment.\n\nThough accompanied by a company of [[Purple Dragons]] and the same adventurers, Barthold's convoy was attacked while making camp along the [[Wyvernwater]] riverside. [[Lizardfolk]] raiders charged at the Cormyreans and were fought off, only for the [[shaman]] [[Srass Marnanr]] to ambush from the water and use a ''[[dimension door]]'' to abscond with Dedryk. Moncrief rallied his forces and sent the adventurers on in pursuit of the lizardfolk, fighting through a party led by the great warrior [[Rynarr Nosryrr]] and eventually coming across a small camp where the shaman Srass and the still-bound Dedryk were hiding. After further battle the shaman was defeated and Dedryk Black was recovered, then delivered safely to Wheloon."
