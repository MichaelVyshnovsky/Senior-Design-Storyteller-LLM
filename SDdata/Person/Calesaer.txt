Calesaer was a large wood elf in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1486 DR, Calesaer was traveling through the Moonsea in order to look for his sister in the Border Forest. He stopped for a drink at the Plodding Plow, in the village of The Stop.
Calesaer knew the situation of Hillsfar and tried to avoid drawing attention to himself.
