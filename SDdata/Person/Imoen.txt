'''Imoen''' ({{Pronounce|IMM|oh|en|refs=

{{Quote|''"Heya! it's me, Imoen."''}}

==Description==
She had wide eyes and a manner of speech that was beyond her years.{{Cite dragon/255/Baldur's Gate: Candlekeep|57}}

Imoen was a decent enough cook and knew some information about brewing. In her youth she was quite knowledgeable about the goings-on in [[Candlekeep]], due to her inquisitive nature.

==Personality==
Imoen had quite an upbeat disposition and was never one to hold a grudge.{{Cite document/Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn Game Manual|59}}
 
==Relationships==
Imoen had a good relationship with her adoptive father [[Winthrop]]. He was rather lenient with Imoen, allowing her to run wild in Candlekeep.

==History==
Imoen was born in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. Her mother passed away during childbirth and she was promptly adopted by the gruff but jovial man named Winthrop.{{Cite dragon/255/Baldur's Gate: Candlekeep|58}} She grew up alongside [[Abdel Adrian]], the adoptive son of the [[sage]] [[Gorion]]; a young man she believed to be her friend, but who was in fact her divine sibling.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Gorion abruptly left Candlekeep with his foster child in care. While snooping on the elder [[mage]], Imoen got wind of his plans and followed the pair as they fled in the middle of night. She witnessed Gorion's death at the hands of [[Sarevok Anchev]], and did her best to comfort and console her friend.Imoen is not present in the [[Baldur's Gate (novel)]]. She was said to have remained in Candlekeep until after the end of the [[iron crisis]].

Following the end of the [[iron crisis]] of that year, Imoen began studying the [[Magic|arcane arts]] under the tutelage of [[Liia Jannath]], one of the [[Grand Duke]]s of [[Baldur's Gate]]. 

In the month of [[Uktar]], she was reunited with her companion as they ventured through the familial tomb of the Korlasz family in search of the [[Korlasz|last remaining disciple]] of Sarevok. A couple of weeks passed until they were reunited again in Baldur's Gate. On the night they both stayed at [[High Hall]], Imoen and her sibling were attacked by [[assassin]]s working for the [[Shining Lady]]. Imoen was afflicted with a non-lethal [[poison]] and took quite some time to recover.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Abdel was framed for the murder of [[Skie Silvershield]] and imprisoned within High Hall. After he was discreetly freed by the Grand Dukes, Imoen rallied some of their allies and accompanied them from the city. Among them were the [[Rashemaar berserker]] [[Minsc]], the [[Wychlaran]] [[Dynaheir]], and the married couple from the [[Harpers]], [[Jaheira]] and [[Khalid]]. Unfortunatley the group was quickly ambushed, and taken to a dungeon in the far-south city of [[Athkatla]].

The group was captured by the sadistic [[mage]] [[Jon Irenicus]] and his [[vampire]] "sibling" [[Bodhi]]. Imoen and her own sibling were tortured and experimented upon in an effort to unlock their divine power. Somehow Imoen freed herself and freed her companion from his cage. After encountering the [[thief]] [[Yoshimo]] they ventured out of the dungeon complex and into the open market of [[Waukeen's Promenade]].

They arrived to see their captor slaying a few members of the [[Shadow Thieves]] guild. Imoen and Irenicus exchanged words and a few spells in a heated exchange, before being stopped by the [[Cowled Wizards]]. As they both openly cast arcane spells in the streets of the city, they were arrested for the illegal use of unlicensed magic and taken for judgement, and imprisoned within the asylum of [[Spellhold]] on the island of [[Brynnlaw]].

Irenicus quickly freed himself from the control of the Cowled Wizards. He continued his experiments on Imoen, hoping again to unlock the powers she unknowingly had as a [[Bhaalspawn]]. Irenicus managed to extract Imoen's divine soul and instill it within his sibling Bodhi, in an effort to restore the extended life she would have previously had as an [[elf]]. While Abdel managed to break into Spellhold, he was captured as well and similarly had his Bhaalspawn essence and his soul drained from him to supplant Irenicus' lack thereof. The pair and their companions were left to rot in the [[Spellhold#Description|dungeon maze]] beneath the asylum as Bodhi's playthings.

After a journey that took them through the [[Underdark]], the [[drow]] city of [[Ust Natha]], and an [[elven]] war camp near the [[Forest of Tethir]], Imoen's sibling was able to return to Athkatla and confront Bodhi in her lair beneath the city's [[Athkatla/Grave District|Grave District]]. Finally she was slain, her body was staked through the heart and Imoen's soul was returned to her.In the [[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (novel)]], Imoen is captured by Irenicus alongside [[Jaheira]] and is briefly transformed into the [[Slayer]]. She is present during the expedition into the [[drow]] city and has a tryst with [[Phaere Despana]]. Imoen is again captured by Irenicus, set into the body of [[Bhaal]]'s [[Bhaal#Avatars|avatar]], and let loose upon the city of [[Suldanessellar]]. She is rescued by [[Abdel Adrian]] and in turn helps pull him out of his descent into hell.

Imoen was believed to have died some time before the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, as the only two remaining Bhaalspawn at that time were Abdel Adrian and [[Viekang]].
