Lemminkainen was a human bard, fighter, and wizard a hero of the Finnish pantheon and the proxy of the goddess Mielikki, the Mistress of the Forest, in the 14 century DR.
Standing  tall, he was good-humored but reckless, and so was often getting into great trouble.
Fortunately, Lemminkainen was a master shape-changer, was immune to all poisons, and bears and wolves would not harm him.
For battle, he was well-armed with a +3 javelin of distance, a +3 bow with animal slaying arrows in his quiver, a +3 dagger, and a +5 flaming sword of sharpness. He wore +4 chainmail and a girdle of frost giant strength.
He also had a pair of snowshoes of speed and traveling so he could move swiftly over snowy terrain.
Finally, Lemminkainen had a magical brush, though he did not take it with him on adventures. This was just as well, as it bled when Lemminkainen was in danger, so his mother knew when to go rescue him.
Lemminkainens mother once used a magical iron rake, which could extend up to  in length, to fish his body from out of a deep body of water.
Some 1,500 years before, Lemminkainen killed Urho, the champion of Loviatar, and interred his remains within the Frozen Peaks on the world of the realms of Kalevala and Pohjola, and gave his terrible black-bladed greatsword Mordvin into the care of the dwarves of Girda, so that they might never be reunited. According to a dwarf bard of Girda, Lemminkainen arrived in the dead of winter, still bearing a hundred bleeding battle-wounds and gripping the swords hilt tightly, no matter how its evil burned him because of his goodness, and thrust it all the way into a great block of ice he found in the courtyard there. Lemminkainen also built a shrine to house this block of ice, and this was guarded by the dwarves of Girda over the centuries to come.
He served Mielikki from the Grove of the Unicorns, on the layer of Krigala in the plane of the Beastlands.
Tiera was Lemminkainens shield man and a fellow proxy of Mielikki.
He had a great enemy in the son of Louhi, who was the leader of Pohjola.
