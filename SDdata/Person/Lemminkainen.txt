'''Lemminkainen''' was a [[human]] [[bard]], [[fighter]], and [[wizard]]; a hero of the [[Finnish pantheon]]; and the [[proxy]] of the goddess [[Mielikki]], the Mistress of the Forest, in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description & Personality==
Standing {{SI|6.5|ft|long=yes}} tall, he was good-humored but reckless, and so was often getting into great trouble.

==Abilities==
Fortunately, Lemminkainen was a master shape-changer, was immune to all [[poison]]s, and [[bear]]s and [[wolves]] would not harm him.

==Possessions==
For battle, he was well-armed with a ''+3 [[javelin of distance]]'', a ''+3 [[bow]]'' with ''[[animal slaying arrow]]s'' in his [[quiver]], a ''+3 [[dagger]]'', and a ''+5 [[flaming]] [[sword of sharpness]]''. He wore ''+4 [[chainmail]]'' and a ''[[Belt of giant strength|girdle of frost giant strength]]''.

He also had a pair of ''[[snowshoes of speed and traveling]]'' so he could move swiftly over snowy terrain.

Finally, Lemminkainen had a magical brush, though he did not take it with him on adventures. This was just as well, as it bled when Lemminkainen was in danger, so his mother knew when to go rescue him.

==History==
Lemminkainen's mother once used a magical [[iron]] rake, which could extend up to {{SI|200|yd|long=yes}} in length, to fish his body from out of a deep body of water.<ref><ref>

Some 1,500 years before, Lemminkainen killed [[Urho]], the champion of [[Loviatar]], and interred his remains within the Frozen Peaks on the world of the realms of Kalevala and Pohjola, and gave his terrible black-bladed [[greatsword]] ''Mordvin'' into the care of the [[dwarves]] of Girda, so that they might never be reunited. According to a dwarf bard of Girda, Lemminkainen arrived in the dead of winter, still bearing a hundred bleeding battle-wounds and gripping the sword's hilt tightly, no matter how its evil burned him because of his goodness, and thrust it all the way into a great block of ice he found in the courtyard there. Lemminkainen also built a shrine to house this block of ice, and this was guarded by the dwarves of Girda over the centuries to come.{{Cite polyhedron/33/The Sword & the Anti-Hero|10-12}}

==Home==
He served Mielikki from the [[Grove of the Unicorns]], on the layer of [[Krigala]] in the [[plane]] of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]].

==Relations==
[[Tiera]] was Lemminkainen's shield man and a fellow proxy of Mielikki.

He had a great enemy in the son of Louhi, who was the leader of Pohjola.<ref><ref>
