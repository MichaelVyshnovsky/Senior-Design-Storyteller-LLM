Gomir was popular barber among the tourists visiting Huzuz. His shop was within viewing distance of the Golden Mosque. While only an adequate barber, Gomir excelled at healing at storytelling. He enjoyed regaling his customers with tales of the mosques and palace.
His rates were double of those of most other barbers in the city.
Gomir had a small leopard as his familiar that actually lived in the shop with him.
