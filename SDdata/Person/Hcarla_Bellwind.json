        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], Hcarla was a member of the secret [[Zhent]] occupation army in High Dale. He was present at the meeting of the [[Council of the High Dale]] when [[Angruin Myrvult]] explained to the councilors about strange movements (in truth [[Elminster Aumar]] and [[Sharantyr]]).\n\nWhen Elminster's and the [[Rangers Three]]'s actions started an insurrection against the Zhents, Hcarla was one of the last surviving Zhent wizards remaining inside [[High Castle]]. However, he decided to win [[Manshoon]]'s favor by killing Elminster, but instead the Old Mage defeated Hcarla."
