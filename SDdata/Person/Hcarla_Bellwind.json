He was present at the meeting of the Council of the High Dale when Angruin Myrvult explained to the councilors about strange movements (in truth Elminster Aumar and Sharantyr).\nWhen Elminsters and the Rangers Threes actions started an insurrection against the Zhents, Hcarla was one of the last surviving Zhent wizards remaining inside High Castle. However, he decided to win Manshoons favor by killing Elminster, but instead the Old Mage defeated Hcarla."
