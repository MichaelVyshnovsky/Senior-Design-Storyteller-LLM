'''Zilzanzer''' was a [[wizard]] creator of the ''[[ring of the gorgon]]'' who lived some years before the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Despite Zilzanzer's fame coming from the creation of the ''ring of the gorgon'', most of his creations infamously did not perform as expected. However, one exception was ''[[Zilzanzer's Magnificent Dart]]s''—tiny magical missiles that allowed the wielder to swiftly throw five [[dart]]s within six seconds. ''Zilzanzer's Magnificent Darts'' worked out just right and he sold a large number of them to his colleagues. Overall, Zilzanzer created a great number of these darts before his death some years before the {{Yearlink|1281}}.
