'''Aataqah''' was a [[djinni]] captured by the cruel mage named [[Jon Irenicus]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

{{quote|''I suffer a terrible curiosity; I see paths that branch in a thousand directions, and each a thousand again, but for all I see, you remain a mystery. All I wish is a single answer. Tip the [[scales]] this once to me, and I shall tip them to you in return. Shall you answer me or shall you strike out on your own?''|Aataqah to Abdel Adrian}}

==History==
Aataqah was captured sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1369}} and kept in [[Jon Irenicus's dungeon]] and laboratory deep underneath the city of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]]. [[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions were captured by Irenicus, but with help from [[Imoen]], the [[Bhaalspawn]]'s sister, the surviving group escaped the imprisonment. As they were searching for a way out, Aataqah appeared in front of the Bhaalspawn in the dungeon's crystal-filled Scrying Chamber and declared that Abdel's thread of life was bright and frayed. The djinni was uninterested in capturing the escapees for his master, but he was overcome by curiosity about the faithful man. Aataqah posed a single hypothetical question trying to determine the Bhaalspawn's morality. Aataqah's actions were dependent on Abdel's answer. If the man answered nobly, the djinni was ready to ''[[summon]]'' an [[ogre mage]] to attack the escapees, while a cowardly response could lead Aataqah to ''conjure'' a pack of mad [[gibberling]]s. In either case, the djinni was going to offer Abdel a hint of how to escape. Aataqah had no interest in aiding the Bhaalspawn without being given a response.
