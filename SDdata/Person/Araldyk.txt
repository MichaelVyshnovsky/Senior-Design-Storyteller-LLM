'''Araldyk''' was a [[helmed horror]] directly under the control of the [[mage]], [[Yather Indaglol]].

==Personality==
Being a mindless helmed horror under control of a [[wizard]], Araldyk was silent, attentive, and menacing.

==Activities==
The floating suit of metal armor, Araldyk, worked at Yather's tavern, the [[Helm at Highsun]], in [[Red Larch]]. Araldyk served as waiter, usher, bouncer, and occasionally a cloak rack. Araldyk also enforced the tavern's motto, "No one bothers you at the Helm."
