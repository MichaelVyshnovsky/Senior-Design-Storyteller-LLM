Araldyk was a helmed horror directly under the control of the mage, Yather Indaglol.
Being a mindless helmed horror under control of a wizard, Araldyk was silent, attentive, and menacing.
The floating suit of metal armor, Araldyk, worked at Yathers tavern, the Helm at Highsun, in Red Larch. Araldyk served as waiter, usher, bouncer, and occasionally a cloak rack. Araldyk also enforced the taverns motto, "No one bothers you at the Helm."
