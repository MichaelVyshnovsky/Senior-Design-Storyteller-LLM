Lord '''Jharvex Krimmevol''' was the head of the [[Krimmevol]] mercantile family in [[Eshpurta]], and held a seat on the [[Shield Council of Eshpurta|Shield Council]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Jharvex was the uncle of the family's patriarch, Lord [[Aernos Krimmevol]] of [[Crimmor]]. Jharvex had a younger brother, [[Cahorl Krimmevol|Cahorl]], but framed him for the murder of a young daughter of the [[Zoar]] family. While Cahorl fled to [[Tethyr]], Jharvex seized his lands and took them for his own.

==History==
By [[1370 DR]], Jharvex had sat on the Shield Council for more than 30 years.
