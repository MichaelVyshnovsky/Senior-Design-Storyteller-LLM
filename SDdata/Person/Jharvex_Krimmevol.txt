Lord Jharvex Krimmevol was the head of the Krimmevol mercantile family in Eshpurta, and held a seat on the Shield Council during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Jharvex was the uncle of the familys patriarch, Lord Aernos Krimmevol of Crimmor. Jharvex had a younger brother, Cahorl, but framed him for the murder of a young daughter of the Zoar family. While Cahorl fled to Tethyr, Jharvex seized his lands and took them for his own.
By 1370 DR, Jharvex had sat on the Shield Council for more than 30 years.
