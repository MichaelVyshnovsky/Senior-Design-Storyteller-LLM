Andrik Gos () was a mad artist in Mulmaster.
Andrik was the nephew of Zor Faltyn Gos, one of the Blades of Mulmaster.
Andrik was always an artist and a painter. Around 1491 DR, when the Blades competed with each other over the arts, Andrik was generously sponsored by his uncle.
However, true success arrived only with his patron Doril Cire, secretly a cultist of the Cult of the Eternal Flame. Thanks to the infusion of elemental fire in his paintings, his works attracted more people. Doril manipulated him into creating a masterpiece that could summon an elemental blast that would destroy the city. Afterwards, his talent vanished completely, leaving Andrik despondent.
