'''Andrik Gos''' ({{Pronounce|Ã†ND|rick|_|GAHSS|refs={{Cite adventurers league/Flames of Kythorn|29}}}}) was a mad artist in [[Mulmaster]].

==Relationship==
Andrik was the nephew of Zor [[Faltyn Gos]], one of the Blades of Mulmaster.{{Cite adventurers league/Breath of the Yellow Rose|10}}

==History==
Andrik was always an artist and a painter. Around [[1491 DR]], when the Blades competed with each other over the arts, Andrik was generously sponsored by his uncle.

However, true success arrived only with his patron [[Doril Cire]], secretly a cultist of the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]]. Thanks to the infusion of elemental fire in his paintings, his works attracted more people. Doril manipulated him into creating a masterpiece that could summon an elemental blast that would destroy the city.{{Cite adventurers league/Flames of Kythorn|21}} Afterwards, his talent vanished completely, leaving Andrik despondent.{{Cite adventurers league/Flames of Kythorn|22}}
