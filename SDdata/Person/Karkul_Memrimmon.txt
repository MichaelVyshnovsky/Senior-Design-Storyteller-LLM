Karkul Memrimmon was a Zhentilar warcaptain of the Eastern Stonelands company in the mid-14 century DR.
He was an enormous man.
Per Gathlarue, he was too rowdy for any tavern.
He favored gauntlets for fighting.
He wielded spiked gauntlets.
Gathlarue, a Zhentarim sorceress, avoided him.
In late , Karkul Memrimmon was sent to ambush Shandril Shessair, moved from his post in the Stonelands of Cormyr towards Hullack Forest. Aided by an upperpriest of Fzouls, they crossed the Moonsea Ride north of Gnoll Pass, and then rode nightly to the Immer upstream. From there, they got in position to ambush her.
During the ambush, Karkul Memrimmons eyes got burned out, and Simron, one of his underlings, escaped, though they almost succeeded in capturing Shandril. Before he could get his eyesight restored, Karkul Memrimmon was slain by Delg Ironstar, a companion of Shandrils.
Fzoul Chembryl later confirmed him dead.
