==History==
In late {{yearlink|1357}}, Karkul Memrimmon was sent to ambush [[Shandril Shessair]], moved from his post in the [[Stonelands]] of Cormyr towards [[Hullack Forest]]. Aided by an upperpriest of Fzoul's, they crossed the [[Moonsea Ride]] north of [[Gnoll Pass]], and then rode nightly to the [[Immer]] upstream. From there, they got in position to ambush her.

During the ambush, Karkul Memrimmon's eyes got burned out, and Simron, one of his underlings, escaped, though they almost succeeded in capturing Shandril. Before he could get his eyesight restored, Karkul Memrimmon was slain by [[Delg Ironstar]], a companion of Shandril's.

[[Fzoul Chembryl]] later confirmed him dead.
