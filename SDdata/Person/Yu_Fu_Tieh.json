        "mainbody": "Yu Fu Tieh was a samurai in the spelljammer spaceport city of Chunming in Shou Lung in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nA one-time prized student of Master Wang Ho of the Wang Ho School in Cham Fau, Yu Fu disputed his plans to take kensai skills to space via spelljamming, fearing it would dishonor the traditions of Shou Lung. He ultimately maimed Wang Ho in an apparent accident during routine training.\nBy , Yu Fu was betrothed to An Ching Wang, the daughter of Wang Ho, now living in Chunming. But he was deeply jealous and would duel to the death anyone who threatened their relationship.An Chings lover is Chien Jang Liang in Kara-Tur The Eastern Realms Volume I and Yu Fu Tieh in Realmspace. Both of them injured her father in a training accident and both left, with An Ching following. It seems likely that Chien was renamed indeed, he appears on the same page as Yu Fu Fang and Hu Tieh. Regardless, they have different motives, classes, and personality details, so this wiki assumes they are separate characters for clarity, even if it means An Ching clearly has a type."
