        "mainbody": "'''Yu Fu Tieh''' was a [[samurai]] in the [[spelljammer]] spaceport city of [[Chunming]] in [[Shou Lung]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "A one-time prized student of Master [[Wang Ho]] of the [[Wang Ho School]] in [[Cham Fau]], Yu Fu disputed his plans to take [[kensai]] skills to space via [[spelljamming]], fearing it would dishonor the traditions of Shou Lung. He ultimately maimed Wang Ho in an apparent accident during routine training.",
        "Relationships": "By {{YearlinkConvert|2617|SY}}, Yu Fu was betrothed to [[An Ching Wang]], the daughter of Wang Ho, now living in Chunming. But he was deeply jealous and would duel to the death anyone who threatened their relationship.An Ching's lover is [[Chien Jang Liang]] in ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' Volume I and Yu Fu Tieh in ''Realmspace''. Both of them injured her father in a training accident and both left, with An Ching following. It seems likely that Chien was renamed; indeed, he appears on the same page as [[Yu Fu Fang]] and [[Hu Tieh]]. Regardless, they have different motives, classes, and personality details, so this wiki assumes they are separate characters for clarity, even if it means An Ching clearly has a type."
