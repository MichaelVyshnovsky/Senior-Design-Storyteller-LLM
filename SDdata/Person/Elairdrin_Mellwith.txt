'''Elairdrin Mellwith''' was a womanizing [[mage]] who resided in the [[Star Mounts]] of [[northwest Faerûn]] long before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Elairdrin's claim to fame was the creation of the first ''[[amulet of metaspell influence]]'', which he called ''the Amplifier''. His motivations were far from scholarly as the scoundrel used ''the Amplifier'' to aid his womanizing habits. Sometime later, the original ''Amplifier'' was taken from Elairdrin Mellwith by a wizard who planned to use the [[amulet]] to harness destructive magics. How the item was claimed remained unclear as historic accounts of that event varied wildly.
