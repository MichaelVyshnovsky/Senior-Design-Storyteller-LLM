        "mainbody": "Lord Chamberlain '''Marketh''' was a [[thief]] and the administrative overseer of [[Dorn's Deep]] following its occupation by the allies of Revered Brother [[Poquelin]] during the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|If my superiors needs something done, it must be done, whatever the cost. I don't have the luxury or time to be burdened with ethics.|Marketh, on Marketh.}}",
        "Personality": "Marketh believed what he referred to as \"New Dorn's Deep\" would be a thriving community of [[Icewind Dale]]. He held a particular disdain for the [[dwarven]] people and did not allow them entrance into his burgeoning community.\n\nHe was wholly unethical individual who was not above resorting to barbarous means. He was also however an abject coward and would readily give in when he felt threatened.",
        "Possessions": "Marketh wore an suit of [[black dragon|black]] [[Dragon scale mail|dragon scale armor]], and wielded two blades, the [[scimitar]] ''[[Valiant (scimitar)|Valiant]]'' and an [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[wakizashi]]. He was also in the possession of a ''[[ring of the gorgon]]''.",
        "Activities": "He dwelled within a lavish palace in the lower depths of Dorn's Deep.",
        "Relationships": "According to [[Ilmadia Bariel]], Marketh surrounded himself with friends that were idiotic louts.",
        "History": "Marketh was once part of an adventuring company that included a noble [[paladin]], a [[wizard]], and [[cleric]], who together went to investigate Brother Poquelin and his activities in Icewind Dale. When the group confronted the Revered Brother, Poquelin offered them the opportunity to work for him. When Marketh's allies refused, he literally one of them in the back, as the others were dealt with by Poquelin.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Marketh remained loyal to Poquelin and watched over Dorn's Deep for his master. He was however, not truly devoted to the Revered Brother's cause."
