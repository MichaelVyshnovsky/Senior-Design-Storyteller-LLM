Burak the Mongrel was a half-orc pirate on the Moonsea in 1367 DR.
Burak had no strategy in his attacks and was not loved nor admired by his crew they followed him for money, and showed no mercy to their victims. However, Burak had a passion destroying slave ships. But all slaves were dragged aboard his ship and given to the crew to do with as they willed. No slave taken by him and his crew was ever seen again on land.
Burak was a bandit who at one point decided with other humanoids to turn to piracy. Despite his lack of strategy, Burak was quite successful in his career thanks to his rapid attacks and his ace card, a shaman in his crew. His ship was named Flotsam.
