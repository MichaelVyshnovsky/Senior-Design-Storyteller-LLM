Reynald de Chatillon was a fallen paladin in Athkatla in Amn.
Reynald was a paladin and a member of the Order of the Radiant Heart, but at some point he fell from grace and started living as an outcast.
Later, Reynald joined his fellow fallen paladin Anarg. Reynald and some of his fellows fought some thieves when they were helped by Gorions Ward. Reynald thanked and Gorions Ward for a mission, not knowing that Gorions Ward was already working for the Radiant Order. Gorions Ward succeeded in the mission, earning the trust of Reynald and his fellows. Only Anarg saw the duplicity of Gorions Ward but he was killed in the fighting. At last, Reynald and his companions rejoined the Radiant Order, which was the objective of Gorions Wards mission for the order.
