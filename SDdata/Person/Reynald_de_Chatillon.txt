'''Reynald de Chatillon''' was a fallen paladin in [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]].

==History==
Reynald was a paladin and a member of the [[Order of the Radiant Heart]], but at some point he fell from grace and started living as an outcast.

Later, Reynald joined his fellow fallen paladin [[Anarg]]. Reynald and some of his fellows fought some thieves when they were helped by [[Gorion's Ward]]. Reynald thanked and Gorion's Ward for a mission, not knowing that Gorion's Ward was already working for the Radiant Order. Gorion's Ward succeeded in the mission, earning the trust of Reynald and his fellows. Only Anarg saw the duplicity of Gorion's Ward but he was killed in the fighting. At last, Reynald and his companions rejoined the Radiant Order, which was the objective of Gorion's Ward's mission for the order.<ref>
