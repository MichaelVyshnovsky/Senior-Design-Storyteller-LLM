'''Malygris''' was a powerful [[dragon aging|very old]] [[blue dragon]] [[dracolich]] that lived in [[Anauroch]].

==Relationships==
Malygris was a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] until [[1371 DR]].

==History==
Malygris killed [[Sussethilasis]], the [[suzerain]] of approximately twenty blue dragons that resided within the borders of the [[Great Sand Sea]], after becoming a dracolich.
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, [[Brennus Tanthul]] and [[Clariburnus Tanthul|Clariburnus]] arrived to the lair of Malygris freeing him from bondage to the Cult, and so the dracolich become a new ally for the emerging conflict between Thultanthar and the people of the [[Heartlands]].
