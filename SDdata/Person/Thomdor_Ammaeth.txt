Baron Thomdor Ammaeth was the cousin of King Azoun IV and Warden of the Eastern Marches of Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR. He lived in Arabel.
Thomdor was a very large overweight man with a big belly. His hair was dark and messy, and streaked with grey.
In 1369 DR, Thomdor was on a hunt with King Azoun IV, Duke Bhereu, and Aunadar Bleth when he was poisoned by a magical abraxus in the abraxus affair, putting him in a coma-like state. He eventually succumbed and died that same year.
Thomdor was the cousin of the King of Cormyr, Azoun IV, and was the brother of Duke Bhereu Ammaeth.
