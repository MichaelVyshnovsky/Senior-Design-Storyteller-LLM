Lord '''Sarken Eomane''' was a member of the [[Parliament of Peers]] from the noble [[patriar]] [[Jannath (family)|Jannath]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lord Sarken Eomane was already a member of the Parliament of Peers. When the [[Absolute crisis]] arrived to the Gate, Sarken was noted by the [[Cult of Bane]] as one of the eight top patriars of the Parliament, vulnerable to bribery, blackmail, or direct threats.
