Alatelo De Bonito was a spell-waving guard and the financial advisor of the Den of the Seven Vales tavern and an inn in the City of Coin Athkatla in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Despite his official position and job at the Den, Alatelo was an aspiring singer-songwriter. The mans talents were so lackluster the inns proprietress, Patricia, regularly stopped his "performances" and scolded Alatelo. She supported Alatelos work of magics and financial graphs but could not tolerate his wailing, threatening Alatelo with being sacked. He attempted to proudly sing his ballads to the crowds lack of interest. Alatelos works included a tale of his woe â€“ the lament of being a mage while yearning for the stage.
