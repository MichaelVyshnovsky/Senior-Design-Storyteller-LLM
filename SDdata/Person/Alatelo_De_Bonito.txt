'''Alatelo De Bonito''' was a [[spell]]-waving guard and the financial advisor of the ''[[Den of the Seven Vales]]'' tavern and an inn in the City of Coin [[Athkatla]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''A rousing wave of indifference from the crowd yet again. Ah well, if I let such things bother me, I would have given up the stage years ago... as per the wishes of most of my audience, unfortunately. At least the occasional [[dwarf]] applauds. Well, doesn't swear and leave, anyway.''|Alatelo De Bonito}}

==History==
Despite his official position and job at the Den, Alatelo was an aspiring singer-songwriter. The man's talents were so lackluster the inn's proprietress, [[Patricia]], regularly stopped his "performances" and scolded Alatelo. She supported Alatelo's work of magics and financial graphs but could not tolerate his wailing, threatening Alatelo with being sacked. He attempted to proudly sing his ballads to the crowd's lack of interest. Alatelo's works included a [[Raised of Spells|tale]] of his woe â€“ the lament of being a mage while yearning for the stage.
