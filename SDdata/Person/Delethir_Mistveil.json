As if the drow weren't trouble enough for poor Eveningstar!\n|Delethir\n}}\nDuring the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], Delethir worked at the Eveningstar War Hospital. One night, the hospital was put into a state of shock by the murder of the head priest [[Hurim Jaskyr]], killed in his own bed. Because of the ongoing war there was no one available to help with the investigation until the next night, when Delethir sent a team of [[adventurer]]s into the hospital to look about. As it turned out, a number of patients had been infected with [[lycanthropy]] and were involuntarily transforming, putting the whole hospital at risk."
