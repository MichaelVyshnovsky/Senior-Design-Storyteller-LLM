        "mainbody": "Delethir Mistveil was a healer who worked at the Eveningstar War Hospital during the late 15 century DR.\nDelethir had light skin and short black hair.\nDuring the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, Delethir worked at the Eveningstar War Hospital. One night, the hospital was put into a state of shock by the murder of the head priest Hurim Jaskyr, killed in his own bed. Because of the ongoing war there was no one available to help with the investigation until the next night, when Delethir sent a team of adventurers into the hospital to look about. As it turned out, a number of patients had been infected with lycanthropy and were involuntarily transforming, putting the whole hospital at risk."
