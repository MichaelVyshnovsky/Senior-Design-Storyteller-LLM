        "History": "General Tombelthen was a trusted general of Tethyr, and an old friend to Queen-Monarch [[Zaranda Rhindaun]].\n\nIn [[1368 DR]], the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Gorion's Ward]] and party made their way to Tethyr. As soon as they arrived, they were confronted by Jamis and his contingent. He accused the Ward of committing crimes against his nation and humanity itself. He then informed the Ward that they were guilty of destroying [[Saradush]], would have no trial, and were due to execution."
