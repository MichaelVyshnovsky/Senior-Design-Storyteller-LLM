High Merchant Logan Coprith was a soldier and businessman of the Coprith family and later the mayor of Trademeet during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Before he entered into the life of a merchant, Lord Coprith spent much time in the military. He was not quite as skilled a financier as he was a martial leader.
Logan was a man of few words. He was a reasonable man who was often forced to find a balance between the competing interests within his city.
High Merchant Coprith was the younger brother of the rebel leader Lady Aura of Riatavin.
The High Merchant was aided in his duties as mayor by Guild Mistress Busya.
Lady Lilith Lurraxol attempted to charm and seduce him in order to give her family an advantage in business, but failed utterly.
Lord Coprith was born into one of the most influential families in Trademeet. During his younger years he served in the military at Citadel Rashturl.
Considering the position of High Merchant is bestowed upon the head of the most powerful family in Trademeet at that given time, Logan was the perfect fit. Within his first year he improved the strength of the citys guardsmen and gained great favor in town.
In the , Lord Coprith was presented with with a number of threats to the city at once. All commerce within Trademeet was put to a halt by a group of Calishite dao led by Khan Zahraa. They refused to lift their blockade until they could exact revenge on the rakshasa Ihtafeer, who was hiding out near the city.
At the same time, the city was also being assaulted by waves of savage beasts that were being directed by a group of Shadow Druids that took over a nearby grove. He and his guardsmen managed to capture a local druid, a shapeshifter by the name of Cernd, and imprisoned him beneath the mayoral manor.
He was nearly killed on Eleasis 19 in the  while defending the orphans of Trademeet from the onslaught of the Sothillisian Empire. He managed to survive the attack despite his injuries, and proceeded to work alongside the Council Army commanders from the Citadels and Hillforts rather than the Council, their incompetence having shaken his trust in them.
