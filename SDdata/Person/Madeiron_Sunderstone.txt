'''Madeiron Sunderstone''' ({{Pronounce|Mah|DEER|onn|_|SUN|der|stone|refs=

==Description==
Madeiron was {{SI|8|ft}} tall, built like a human fortress. He had long scruffy blond hair, which hung on his head covering his face like that of a sheepdog.

==Personality==
Madeiron was near fearless but not very smart.

==Possessions==
Madeiron wielded a magical +3 [[battleaxe]] called [[Axe of heavenly fire|Axe of Heavenly Fire]]. It radiated bright white ''[[continual light]]''. That battleaxe was gifted to him by a High Priest of [[Tyr]].

When the giant of a man was on duty he wore a polished, blued [[full plate]] suit of armor, also known as "[[coat-of-plate]]."

Another weapon Madeiron wielded was a {{SI|12|in|c}}-long iron bar. He often used it to control crowds when fighting a crowd of smaller foes.

==Relationships==
Madeiron had three daughters: [[Iluandaera]], [[Phelelle]], and [[Naeoene]], with the eldest of the three inheriting the mountainous man's physique and demeanor.

==History==
Madeiron hailed from [[Hartsvale]], a small kingdom near the [[Silver Marches]]. There, he was a distant cousin of the queen and his lineage went back to [[Brun|Brun I]], son of [[Hartkiller]]. Madeiron left his home for a life as an adventurer.

Finally, circa [[1352 DR]], he settled in Waterdeep, where he joined the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]]. In time, he rose through the ranks to become the bodyguard and personal champion of Piergeiron.

In 1371 DR{{DDTS}}, Madeiron was fulfilling his duty guarding Piergeiron during the Open Lord's wedding ceremony with [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]]. They uncovered a malicious assassination plot by the members of [[Master Mariners' Guild]], stopped a group of [[doppelgangers]] that posed as Eidola's chambermaids, but failed to stop her abduction.

Several years later, in [[1378 DR]], Madeiron Sunderstone was killed in an assassination attempt on Open Lord of Waterdeep, Piergeiron the Paladinson.{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318740836732931| title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}
