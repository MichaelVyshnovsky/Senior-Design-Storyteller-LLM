Madeiron Sunderstone ( tall, built like a human fortress. He had long scruffy blond hair, which hung on his head covering his face like that of a sheepdog.
Madeiron was near fearless but not very smart.
Madeiron wielded a magical +3 battleaxe called Axe of Heavenly Fire. It radiated bright white continual light. That battleaxe was gifted to him by a High Priest of Tyr.
When the giant of a man was on duty he wore a polished, blued full plate suit of armor, also known as "coat-of-plate."
Another weapon Madeiron wielded was a -long iron bar. He often used it to control crowds when fighting a crowd of smaller foes.
Madeiron had three daughters Iluandaera, Phelelle, and Naeoene, with the eldest of the three inheriting the mountainous mans physique and demeanor.
Madeiron hailed from Hartsvale, a small kingdom near the Silver Marches. There, he was a distant cousin of the queen and his lineage went back to Brun I, son of Hartkiller. Madeiron left his home for a life as an adventurer.
Finally, circa 1352 DR, he settled in Waterdeep, where he joined the City Guard. In time, he rose through the ranks to become the bodyguard and personal champion of Piergeiron.
In 1371 DR, Madeiron was fulfilling his duty guarding Piergeiron during the Open Lords wedding ceremony with Eidola of Neverwinter. They uncovered a malicious assassination plot by the members of Master Mariners Guild, stopped a group of doppelgangers that posed as Eidolas chambermaids, but failed to stop her abduction.
Several years later, in 1378 DR, Madeiron Sunderstone was killed in an assassination attempt on Open Lord of Waterdeep, Piergeiron the Paladinson.
