'''Mudgraw''' was a [[tortle]] [[druid]] and guide who lived in [[Ahoyhoy]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
He had led expeditions to [[Shilku]] and the [[Heart of Ubtao]]. Two years later, he led an expedition to [[Omu]]. This was three years before the [[death curse]].

Mudgraw had only one visit to Omu. He accompanied a group of treasure hunters from the city of [[Athkatla]]. They were ambushed by [[yuan-ti]] and Mudgraw was forced to abandon the treasure hunters. He hid in the ruins of a shrine to the god [[Ubtao]]. In the shrine, he found a holy symbol of Ubtao and since then wore it around his neck believing that Ubtao had assisted him in escaping the city.
