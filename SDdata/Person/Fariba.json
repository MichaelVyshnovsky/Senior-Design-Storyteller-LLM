With this, we could take care of all the needy in the entire Docks District for a year! You are much too kind! Ilmater bless youâ€”for all that you've done! Thank you!''|Fariba of Ilmater}}",
        "Description": "Fariba was a [[human]] woman with blonde hair and brown eyes. She wore a simple dress while collecting money for her cause.",
        "History": "After the wars of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, and the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the [[Sword Coast North]] suffered greatly. The city of Neverwinter's commerce was struggling to recover while its poor inhabitants in the [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Docks District]] were hit the hardest by the strife. Fariba spent her days in the [[Crossroad Keep]], accosting everyone she came across, asking for donations aimed at helping Neveren citizens. Despite her best attempts, the donation purse only held scant [[copper]]s."
