'''Azatlim''' was a warrior in service to Lord [[Tessaril Winter]] in [[Eveningstar]], [[Cormyr]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
He carried a [[spear]] for his work.

==Activities==
He guarded [[Tessaril's Tower]].

==Relationships==
He worked together with [[Thrulgar]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, Azatlim and Thrulgar were protecting Tessaril's Tower the night that [[Mirt]], [[Shandril Shessair]], and [[Narm Tamaraith]] arrived seeking her protection. When Shandril threatened them they would not want to cross her, Azatlim asked why; she demonstrated her [[spellfire]] in response on a nearby bush. That did not change anyone's mind.
