Aizel Treemaine was an elf wizard in Waterdeep in 1479 DR.
In 1479 DR, Aizel was hired by the Red Wizard of Thay Varriel to explore on her behalf a necromancers laboratory inside Undermountain. However, she joined the doomed Rutherford Urmbrusks party and disappeared.
Just after Rutherford entered a secret passage, Aizel was captured by the vampire Dayan, who used her for one of his experiments. She was placed inside a helmed horror guardian. To power it, a person had to die inside the armor and Dayan chose Aizel as a sacrifice. She was slowly dying from starvation and only Dayan could free her from the armor without killing her.
