Hornung the Anarch, known as the "king of the wild mages", was a prominent wild mage with multiple spells to his name. Originally from Toril, a wild surge brought on by experimentation with wildwind sent him to the world of Oerth.
At some point, Hornung was recruited into the Xaositects by one of his pupils, Quake Lavender.
