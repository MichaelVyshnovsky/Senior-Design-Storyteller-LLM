        "mainbody": "'''Cairak Redbeard''' was a pirate of the [[Nelanther Isles]] in the midâ€“14th century [[DR]].",
        "Relations": "Cairak was the lover of [[Alabhansree Alanasker]], the former Chansreena (princess) of the city-state of [[Ormpur]].",
        "History": "In the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], Alabhansree and Cairak fled the city of Ormpur, together with many magical blades that had been kept hidden in secret storage niches in the palace, and a large amount of [[saffron]], comprising Ormpur's entire reserve, as well as other [[spices]], a fortune intended as her dowry. They sailed to the [[Moonshae Isles]].\n\nCairak was easily able to sell off the stolen saffron at ports along the [[Sword Coast]] ports, slowly but gaining maximum profit. In the Moonshaes, Alabhansree used her [[magic]] and riches to construct a well-defended tower stronghold at Eiresse and set herself up as a [[wizard]].\n\nBy 1372 DR, Alabhansree and Cairak still dwelled in Eiresse in the Moonshaes.",
        "Home": "Alabhansree and Cairak made their home in a small tower in the cozy pirate cove of [[Eiresse]], on the island of [[Gwynneth]] in the Moonshaes. The tower was a stronghold, well defended by magical guardians and traps, such as \"teeter-totter\" floors than dumped trespassers into winding natural sinkholes that led to the sea, where [[giant octopus]]es laired."
