'''Horgar Steelshadow IV''' was the Crown Prince (sometimes labeled as King) and ruler of [[Gracklstugh]].

==Description==
Horgar was bald. He wore a chain [[hauberk]] and a surcoat of black and gold. He wore gold rings on his fingers and a gold circlet on his head. His beard was formed into braids.

During war time, the Crown Prince rode in a diligence: an enchanted floating object of iron, 30 feet long and 10 feet wide, spiked for defense. It served as the army's command post as well as the prince's throne and bedchamber.

==History==
Horgar was involved in [[Clan Xornbane]]'s attack in [[Ched Nasad]] with [[House Zauvirr]].

In [[1372 DR]], Horgar led the forces of Gracklstugh to attack [[Menzoberranzan]] with the help of [[Nimor Imphraezl]] of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]], later joined by the [[tanarukk]]s of [[Kaanyr Vhok]]'s [[Scoured Legion]]. Horgar wanted power and security against his lairds. Horgar was present at the [[Pillars of Woe]] during the defeat of the [[Army of the Black Spider]]. His forces subsequently participated in the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]], which ultimately failed. Upon this failure, Horgar was killed by Nimor. 

==Relationships==
Clan Laird [[Borwald Firehammer]] was Horgar's chief advisor and the marshal of the army.

It was implied that Horgar hired or otherwise involved Nimor Imphraezl in the downfall (possibly the death) of his father, the king of Gracklstugh.
