He and his coworkers snapped at each other and groused about having to work continuously, eating on the run. The four serving wenches bore the brunt of their vinegar whenever they came in to pick up an order. The cookhouse was hot and steamy from all the fires, ovens, and boiling cauldrons, so the all-male kitchen staff wore minimal clothing for comfort.",
