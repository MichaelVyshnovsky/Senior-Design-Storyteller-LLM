}}'''Ad'non Kareese''' was a male [[drow]] and a member of a band of four renegades including [[Donnia Soldou]], [[Kaer'lic Suun Wett]], and [[Tos'un Armgo]].

==History==
Ad'non belonged to [[House Khareese]] of [[Ched Nasad]]. He was once a [[scout]], [[thief]], and [[assassin]] there, but a failed assassination attempt forced him to leave the [[Underdark]].

He was killed in battle in [[1370 DR]] when [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] vaulted behind him and sliced his head off.

==Relationships==
He was [[Donnia Soldou]]'s lover.
