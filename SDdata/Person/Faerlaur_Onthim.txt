'''Faerlaur Onthim''' was a senior member of the [[Sembia]]n cell of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. As one of the Wearers of Purple, Faerlaur served on the leadership council that guided the Cult's operations in the region of Sembia, [[Cormanthyr]], and the southern [[Dalelands]].

==Activities==
Although he claimed to be a cleric of both [[Cyric]] and [[Shar]], Faerlaur was in fact a worshiper of [[Tiamat]].

Faerlaur held the title of High Dragonservant which was akin to High Priest. He ran the secret [[Temple of the Cult of the Dragon]] within [[Urmlaspyr]] in [[Sembia]] in [[1358 DR]].
