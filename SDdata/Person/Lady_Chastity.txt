'''Lady Chastity''' was a beautiful noblewoman from [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Lady Chastity was a beautiful red-headed young woman with seductive eyes that were reminiscent those of a [[spider]] luring its prey into the webs. She was dressed in ruffled finery.

==Personality==
Lady Chastity had a very seductive and flirty personality.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], Lady Chastity could be found within the [[Chateau Elite]], the most expensive and pompous inn in the city. Her room was next door to the suite occupied by [[Astriel Shalyn]], a spy on a mission from the [[Lords' Alliance]]. During the attack on her by the assassins of [[Zhentarim]], Lady Chastity was cowering in her room in fear.
