Jack Corvet was an ill-fated adventurer who met his doom sometime before the late 14 century DR.
Jack Corvet took upon himself the adventuring career after receiving a lucky ring from his grandmother. Sometime before the , Jack attempted to steal golden chicken from a cloud giant. Jack overestimated his skills and he was caught in the act.  The adventurer whispered a plea upon his lucky ring and to everyones surprise, Jack grew in size, big enough to be able to punch the giant out.
When the chicken laid a golden egg, Jack sold it and, with the money, replaced his old raggedy pair of boots. Later, Jack Corvet attempted the robbery once again, but the "magic" ring failed to enlarge the man. Jack was killed during that adventure and his old discarded pair of boots became known as Jacks Folly.
