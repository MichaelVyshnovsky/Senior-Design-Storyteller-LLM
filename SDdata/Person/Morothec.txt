'''Morothec''' was a [[cambion]] in service to the [[pit fiend]] [[Kurgaloth]].

==Personality==
Morothec could be quite charming, but was quick to anger when bested.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Morothec was one of many [[devil]]s brought to the [[Lightfinger Estate]] in [[Waterdeep]] to enforce a lapsed [[infernal contract]] between Kurgaloth and the [[Lightfinger (family)|Lightfinger family]].

When [[adventurer]]s arrived at the Lightfinger Estate to investigate the chaos that the devils' arrival had caused, Morothec battled them inside the opulent mansion at the Estate's center, and ended up fleeing when their victory became clear.
