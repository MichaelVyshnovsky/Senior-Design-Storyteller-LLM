{{quote|''I probably shouldn't be seen talking to you - don't want to give the Gortash gang here the wrong idea.''|"Plumes" Fronkin}}

==Description==
"Plumes" was a foppish middle-aged [[human]] man with tan shin and gray hair. He wore a distinct green hat adorned with feathers.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the city of Baldur's Gate was threatened by the encroaching army of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. The crisis flooded the city with refugees, elevating tensions among its citizens and allowing a new power to take rulership of the city â€“ [[Lord Gortash]]. "Plumes" Fronkin reluctantly consumed the new lord's propaganda from the curbside preachers and from the pages of the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette.'' [[Augur Harxkellan]] was a Gortash loyalist whose words attracted a crowd of gawkers with "Plumes" among them. However, he did not share the crowd's adoration of the new lord.
