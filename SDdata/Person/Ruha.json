        "mainbody": "'''Ruha''' was an outcast [[spellcaster]] of the [[Mtair Dhafir]] tribe that famously helped unite [[Bedine]] people during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She went on to have an illustrious career as a member of the [[Harpers]], playing an important role in both the [[Trial of Cyric the Mad]] and the [[Return of the Archwizards (event)|Return of the Archwizards]] sagas. \n\n{{Quote|The Weave is there to use or abuse, and it is the choice we make that determines our fate.|Ruha, to the avatar of [[Mystra]], [[1371 DR]].}}",
        "Description": "In her mid–20s Ruha had elegant good looks that were highlighted by her striking eyes, that were often the only feature that was visible behind the veil and shawl she regularly wore. Her cheeks were marked by [[tattoo]]s in the form of a small pattern of crossed lines.",
        "Personality": "Ruha was a confident and determined individual that fiercely valued her independence and freedom to make her own choices. While experienced great sadness and isolation in her life, she was quite selective about whom she allowed to be close to her. Ruha made sure that those around her treated her with respect, even when doing so would break from Bedine custom.\n\nAfter leaving her homeland, Ruha looked to prove herself in the wider world, seemingly more so to herself than others. While her confidence faltered after some failures in life, Ruha was forced to rediscover her place as a force for [[good]]. In the end she found her role to play in the world that stood in stark contrast to the one in which she grew up.",
        "Abilities": "Since she was a young child, Ruha had received visions of events that had not yet come to pass. Her first vision was that of a flutter of hundreds of butterflies, which preceded swarms of moths that filled with holes nearly every piece of clothing and fabric that the Mtairi tribe owned. She would later have more intense prophetic visions, ones that guided her path as an [[adventurer]] and others that haunted her waking hours.\n\nDue to the years of training she spent while in exile, Ruha was adept at casting [[elemental magic]], specifically the the provinces of those practiced by the [[elemental mage]]s that originated from [[Zakhara]]. She was particularly proficient in the [[Sand (province)|sand]] and [[Wind (province)|wind]] provinces.\n\nFor a brief time in [[1371 DR]], Ruha wielded terribly destructive magical powers bolstered by the [[Talos|god of destruction]] himself.",
        "Possessions": "She owned an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] ''+3 [[jambiya]]'' that was extremely important to her, as it was a gift from her foster mother and first tutor of the arcane arts when she turned 12 years old.\n\nOne of her most prized possessions was her ''[[Harper pin]]'', a symbol of the life she had made for herself,",
        "Relationships": {
            "Romances": "[[File:Lander.png|thumb|right|200px|Ruha's one-time lover Lander...]]\nRuha enjoyed a very brief marriage with the proud [[Qahtan]]i warrior [[Ajaman]], before his untimely death mere days after their union. She traveled with his younger brother [[Kadumi]] for some time, becoming quite fond of the young man, despite his misguided overbearance and strict adherence to the more antiquated Bedine traditions.\n\nNot long after Ajaman's death, Ruha became quite close to [[Lander]], \n\nWhile serving on a mission for the Harpers in [[Elversult]], Ruha garnered the infatuation of Prince [[Kao Chou Tang]] of the [[Ginger Palace]]. Although the pampered [[Shou]] prince believed he was in love with the \"[[wu-jen]]\" Ruha, she did not return his affection.",
            "Nemesis": "One of Ruha's most troubling relationships was that which formed between and the [[chosen]] of [[Cyric]], [[Malik el Sami yn Nasser]]. The two repeatedly tried to kill each other a number of times over the course of a year. Ruha sought to bring Malik to justice for inhumane crimes he committed against innocent servants and scholars, while Malik continually acted in service of his Mad God."
        },
        "History": {
            "Life in Anauroch": "As a child, Ruha would often have visions of things to come. Because the Mtairi viewed them as a sign of witchcraft, Ruha was outcast by her father, Sheikh Sabkhat.{{Cite dragon/245/Rogues Gallery: The Heroes of the Trial of Cyric the Mad|66}} She was then raised at the Sister of Rains oasis by the senior Qoha'dar, a fellow outcast spellcaster and kindred spirit. When Ruha was only 16 years old, Qoha'dar died and the young witch was left alone in the world. She remained at the oasis for some time, before trying to find her way back to the Mtair Dhafir camp.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Ruha finally returned to her home tribe, though it was less than momentous occasion. After nearly half of the Qahtani threatened the sheikh they would leave if Ruha remained, Sabkhat arranged for her to marry a warrior from the [[Qahtan]] tribe, a some of the sheikh named Ajaman. After only three days of marriage, the Qahtani camp at [[El Ma'ra]] was attacked by the forces of the [[Zhentarim]] and no survivors remained at the camp, save for Ruha. She was not alone for long this time however, as she soon met up with Kadumi, Ajaman's brother. The pair set off to El Rahalat, in order to warn the members of Ruha's tribe of the Zhentarim, where came across a young Harper by the name of Lander, who sought to do the same. The three were unsuccessful and just barely escaped the onslaught of the [[Zhentilar]] soldiers.\n\nTogether, the three of them saw to it that many of the desert tribes formed an alliance against the Zhentarim. They traveled to the [[Colored Waters]] oasis and managed to convince Sheikhs [[Sa'ar]] of the [[Bait Mahwa]], and [[Utaiba]] of the [[Raz'hadi]] of their cause. After defeating the Zhentarim in a [[Battle of the Chasm|decisive battle]], Ruha and her two companions traveled twice across the [[Shoal of Thirst]] to equip her with the magic she needed to aid the battle against the Zhentarim. While Kadumi was slain during the journey by a Zhentarim assassin, they were ultimately successful in their mission.\n\nRuha, Lander, and their sheikh allies managed to gather together the leaders of 13 other Bedine camps and meet at the sacred oasis of [[Elah'zad]]. There she had a vision of the future and served as a conduit for the [[Mother of Waters]], and shared the goddess' messages for the leaders of the Bedine: stop the invading Zhent forces.",
            "Harper in the Heartlands": "Even though she had played a great part in the unification of the Bedine tribes, and earned the trust and admiration of their respective sheikhs, Ruha felt the same isolation that she endured for so many years in her youth. She decided to leave the desert and join the Harpers herself, the group to which Lander once dedicated himself with all his efforts. For her first mission, [[Storm Silverhand]] dispatched Ruha to [[Voonlar]] to help disrupt a slave trade,\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, the aspiring Harper was then sent to Elversult, to help restore the Lady [[Yanseldara]] from a magical coma, and free her from the clutches of the [[dracolich]] [[Hethcypressarvil]], also known as \"Cypress\". During the voyage across the [[Dragonmere]], aboard the [[Storm Sprite]] captained by the [[half-orc]] [[Fowler]], Ruha took it upon herself to come to the aid of another ship that was being assailed by a [[black dragon]]. Ruha was able to destroy the dragon at sea, inadvertently causing the destruction of the ''Sea Sprite''. The pair were rescued the [[Shou]] [[caravel]] named the ''[[Ginger Lady]]'' and given passage to Pros.\n\nAfter Ruha made contact with [[Vaerana Hawklyn]] of Elversult she was appraised of her mission to infiltrate the Ginger Palace, the Shou embassy on the [[Dragon Coast]], and locate ''[[Yanseldara's staff]]'' which they believed could lead to her whereabouts. After gaining admittance into the embassy, Ruha attracted the unwanted infatuation of Prince Kao Chou Tang and the ire of his wife [[Wei Dao]], a dynamic that led to her abduction. Despite being taken prisoner for a short while, Ruha managed to convince the Prince and Minister [[Hsieh Han Liu]], as well as Vaerana Hawklyn, they should not work against one another, but align themselves to rescue Yanseldara and Tang's mother, [[Lady Feng]].\n\nRuha's insight and ingenuity gave her the chance to draw out Cypress and temporarily weaken it, while Prince Tang managed to rescue his mother, and destroyed the ''[[spirit gem]]'' that bound Cypress' soul along with that of Lady Yanseldara. The plan was successful and Ruha managed to destroy the dracolich once and for all in a great battle and stop its rampage in the streets of Elversult. Having achieved such great success as a new member of the Harpers, Ruha earned the trust of Vaerana Hawklyn, Lady Yanseldara and even Storm Silverhand herself. Perhaps more importantly, she had regained her self-confidence after her previous failed mission.",
            "Chasing the Chosen of Cyric": "[[File:ElSami.png|thumb|right|200px|...and her long-time nemesis, [[Malik el Sami]].]]\n{{Quote|You said I should do whatever is necessary to stop Malik—even if it means destroying a whole kingdom...I prayed for a sign, and you sent a shooting star.|Ruha, to an [[avatar]] of [[Mystra]], [[1371 DR]].}}\n\nAs an experienced agent of the Harpers, Ruha completed several other missions with great success. She rescued the daughter of [[Wycliff|Duke Wycliff]] from the clutches of some [[hill giant]]s and saved some children that had gone missing in the [[Trollclaws|Trollclaw Forest]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Ruha received a vision about a beggar that lived in filth in front of [[Candlekeep]]. She flew south with the [[Griffon Cavalry]] of [[Waterdeep]], arranged for residence within the [[Keeper's Tower]], and soon met the harbinger of misfortune that would plague her for the next year, Malik el Sami yn Nasser. along with [[Gwydion]] of [[Torm]] and [[Rinda]] a scribe from [[Zhentil Keep]]. With help from Cyric, Malik fled Candlekeep and Ruha began in pursuit.\n\nRuha and her ally [[Zale Protelyus]] took to the skies, riding atop the [[hippogriff]] [[Silvercloud]], and tracked Malik west towards the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]]. While in the forest, Ruha demonstrated greatly increased destructive powers with her magic. Under the guise of Mystra, the mischievous god [[Mask]] appeared before the pair, informed Ruha that her new powers were a boon bestowed upon her to aid in her quest to stop Malik.\n\nThe pair tracked Malik down to a minor chapel of Cyric in a village within the [[Storm Horns|Storm Horn mountains]]. As they approached, Ruha was besieged with a terrifying vision of Cyric. She directed Zale to evacuate the village and used her newfound powers to level Cyric's chapel, believing that was her goddess' will. This proved to be a terrible mistake however, as Zale was injured in the ensuing chaos and Malik still managed to escape. An [[avatar]] of the true Mystra appeared before Ruha and admonished her for her actions. Bewildered by Ruha's actions, Mystra cut off the Harper witch's access to [[the Weave]], preventing her from casting magic any longer.\n\nDuring her ongoing pursuit, Malik managed to gravely wound Silvercloud, leaving Ruha with no advantages left over the crafty Cyricist. Stripped of her powers and alone, Ruha traveled to the nearby town of Voonlar, the site of her [[Ruha#Harper in the Heartlands|first great failure]] as a Harper. Ruha met a third avatar of the gods that day, when [[Talos]] took mortal form and informed her of Mystra's imprisonment by [[Helm]] for interfering in Cyric's trial. The Storm Lord tempted her with new powers of spellcasting in exchange for her conversion to his faith, but Ruha refused. In a conciliatory gesture, Talos helped Ruha thwart the plans of the Mad God and informed her she could find the ''Cyrinishad'' in [[Zhentil Keep]].\n\nRuha made her way into Zhentil Keep riding atop the healed Silvercloud, and confronted Malik once again at the city's [[temple of Iyachtu Xvim (Zhentil Keep)|temple]] of [[Iyachtu Xvim]]. While she was unsuccessful in apprehending Malik, Ruha came to understand his true intent: to swap the ''Cyrinishad'' with the ''[[True Life of Cyric]]'' at Cyric's trial. During their confrontation, was incapacitated by High Tyrannar [[Fzoul Chembryl]], and left writhing in pain as a sacrifice for the Godson. Mystra appeared before her faithful servant once again, touched by Ruha's faithfulness to the tenets of the Mystran faith. Goddess and servant reconciled, Ruha lent her wisdom to Mystra ahead of Cyric's Trial, and Mystra freed Ruha from the clutches of the city, allowing her to leave with Silvercloud unharmed.",
            "Return to the Desert": "[[File:Ruha2.png|thumb|right|350px|''Ruha in action!'']]\nBy [[Mirtul]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Ruha began investigating the newly-returned [[Shadovar]] of [[Thultanthar]] on behalf of the Harpers. After Laeral Silverhand arranged for Ruha to serve as a guide for [[Princes of Shade|Princes]] [[Brennus Tanthul|Brennus]] and [[Clariburnus Tanthul]], Ruha gained access to the flying city of Shade. At the same time, she remained determined to hunt down Malik and bring him to justice for the deaths of Rinda and Gwydion. \n\nRuha managed to ambush Malik in the flying city and the two nearly killed one another. The Shadovar were forced to intervene in their ongoing feud; as each were guests of [[Hadrhune]] and the [[Princes of Shade]], Ruha and Malik were allowed to remain in the city so long as they did not harm one another.  After a short while in the city together, Malik orchestrated a plot to frame Ruha for murder, by staging the death of the celebrated [[stone giant|giant]] sculptor [[Aris]] and an attempt upon his own life. Malik's attempt was a failure, only achieving the exile of Ruha to the sands of Anauroch and the placement of himself judgement of High Prince [[Telamont Tanthul]].\n\nWhile in the desert, Ruha was soon joined by Aris and his traveling companion [[Galaeron Nihmedu]], an [[Evereska]]n practitioner of [[shadow magic]]. Ruha guided the pair of outlanders across the desert for three days, until they came upon a small oasis in the [[Saiyaddar]] and the water-deprived stone giant inadvertently rushed into the lair of a young [[blue dragon]]. While the trio were able to overcome the great beast, Aris suffered grave wounds, and he had could not travel until Ruha solicited aid from [[Storm Silverhand]].\n\nOnce the giant recovered, the trio made their way to [[Arabel]] in [[Cormyr]] and Ruha used her status as a Harper to gain audience with city leaders. Ruha, Aris, and Galaeron were brought before the Regent of Cormyr, Princess [[Alusair Obarskyr]], along with the attending Price [[Rivalen Tanthul]] of Thultanthar. Rivalen accused the three exiles of theft against Thultanthar and Princess Obarskyr \"imprisoned\" them within the dungeons of Arabel's [[Citadel (Arabel)|Citadel]] overnight, in truth ensuring their safety from the Shadovar. When Rivalen and the Shadovar attempted to free Ruha and the others from Cormyrean imprisonment, Alusair sprang the trap she had laid. Princess Alusair used the offense to declare that all the [[shade]]s of Thultanthar were to immediately leave Arabel and Cormyr, and remain banished until they ceased their terraforming magic focused upon [[High Ice]], and no longer threatened environmental devastation across the [[Eastern Heartlands]].\n\nOn [[Mirtul 26]] Ruha traveled back to Anauroch alongside the [[War Wizard]] [[Caladnei]] and [[Cormyr]]ean scouts to locate the flying city of Thultanthar. During their journey Ruha reunited with Sheikh Sa'ar, the leader of the Bait Mahwa and former ally at the [[Battle of the Chasm]]. She found the Mahwa tribe idling around [[Shadow Sea]], the newly-formed body of water set upon the once-inhospitable Shoal of Thirst. Much to Ruha's displease, the Bedine people as she saw it were giving up their traditional nomadic lifestyle for one of ease and leisure. \n\nThe Cormyrean commander [[Hhormun]] generously \"allowed\" Sa'ar to carry out a raid on a herd of the Shadovar's flying [[veserab]] mounts, allowing the over-eager sheikh to believe he could rule over this stretch of Anauroch. This aggressive act drew the Thultanthar's warriors into battle, For her part in all this, Ruha became a target for death by the Princes of Shade.",
            "Joining the Chosen": "In [[Flamerule]] of that year, Ruha accompanied Galaeron to a council of heads of state to Arabel, to discuss the ongoing threat posed by the Shadovar. The meeting fell apart when a lone [[phaerimm]]—whose species had besieged [[Evereska]] for nearly over half a year—took hold over [[Mourngrym Amcathra]] of [[Shadowdale]] and attempted to negotiate the cessation of Evereska from Princess Alusair and the other leaders of the Heartlands. After the meeting, Galaeron, Ruha and their recently-famous friend Aris met with [[Storm Silverhand]] and shared with her Galaeron's plan to have the chosen of Mystra take down the city of Thultanthar and free Evereska from the phaerimm threat.\n\nDuring Aris' touching and bittersweet farewell to the Arabellan citizens, the four companions were joined by Mystra's other chosen, [[Khelben Arunsun]], [[Laeral Silverhand|Laeral]] and [[Alustriel Silverhand]], and [[Dove Falconhand]], the famous [[Knight of Myth Drannor]]. As the companions ventured out, Galaeron received a troubling message from Malik el Sami, who still resided within Thultanthar. Knowing Ruha's determination for bringing Malik to justice, several among the group believed she should stay behind, lest her anger interfere with their plans. While on the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]] west to Anauroch, the companions' wagon was harried by [[blue dragon]] allies of the Shadovar. During the fighting Ruha became seperated from Galaeron, Aris, and the chosen, who continued on with their mission in Thultanthar.\n\nOn [[Eleasis 2]], the chosen's mission in Thultanthar went awry, and the flying city briefly plummeted down to Toril. Ruha got in touch with Alustriel by means of magical communication and investigated the Shadow Sea below on their behalf. There Ruha witnessed the ''[[Karsestone]]'' falling from the sky, and spied Malik chained to the ancient artifact, praying for dear life. Ruha manipulated the Weave itself to stop Malik's descent, and shared a few select words with her longtime quarry. As the two spoke, the chain from Malik's manacle broke, and the ''Karsestone'' plunged into the Shadow Sea, where it was then claimed by [[Shar]]. Ruha reunited with Mystra's, apprehended Malik, and together they tricked him into revealing what he knew about Shar's greater plot regarding the [[Shadow Weave]] and her potential dominion over magic. With Malik finally in hand, Ruha set out for [[Twilight Hall]] to bring the little man to justice."
