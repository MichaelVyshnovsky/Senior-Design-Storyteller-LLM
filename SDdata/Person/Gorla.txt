'''Gorla''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] woman who worked at the [[Two Brothers' Butchery]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Gorla was a rather beautiful woman, who typically had her hair styled and her body adorned in all manner of hair ornaments, [[jewelry]], or trendy clothes that she bought with her earnings at the butchery. She stood {{SI|3'6|ft-in|long=yes}} tall and weighed around {{SI|80|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Personality==
Gorla was a rather light-hearted individual and enjoyed her job at the butchery, yet she still longed for the days of being underground and was likely to leave if a group of [[adventurer]]s tried to persuade her to come with them underground.

==Abilities==
She was not proficient in fighting with any particular weapons, but did have some skills in [[gem]] cutting.

==Activities==
Gorla spent her time at the butchery selling meats and [[cheese]]s. When not doing that, she often flirted with the butchery's male customers.

==Relationships==
Out of all the employees at the Two Brothers' Butchery, Gorla particularly enjoyed working alongside [[Norin Bonebreaker]].
