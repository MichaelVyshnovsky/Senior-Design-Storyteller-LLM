Gorla was a dwarven woman who worked at the Two Brothers Butchery in Ravens Bluff in the 14 century DR.
Gorla was a rather beautiful woman, who typically had her hair styled and her body adorned in all manner of hair ornaments, jewelry, or trendy clothes that she bought with her earnings at the butchery. She stood  tall and weighed around .
Gorla was a rather light-hearted individual and enjoyed her job at the butchery, yet she still longed for the days of being underground and was likely to leave if a group of adventurers tried to persuade her to come with them underground.
She was not proficient in fighting with any particular weapons, but did have some skills in gem cutting.
Gorla spent her time at the butchery selling meats and cheeses. When not doing that, she often flirted with the butcherys male customers.
Out of all the employees at the Two Brothers Butchery, Gorla particularly enjoyed working alongside Norin Bonebreaker.
