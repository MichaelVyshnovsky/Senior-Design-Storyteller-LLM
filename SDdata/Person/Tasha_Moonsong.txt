'''Tasha Moonsong''' was an elven huntress made famous by her uncanny skill with a bow.

==Possessions==
The main item of note in her possession was ''[[Tasha's bow]]'', a powerful longbow that was especially helpful against reptilian creatures.

==History==
Tasha Moonsong disappeared at some point before [[1372 DR]]. She was an experienced huntress who embarked on numerous hunting expeditions. During one of those adventures, she was able to slay a [[roc]] with barrage arrow shots from 150 ft. away. Another adventure of note pitted her against [[basilisk]]s while blindfolded to protect herself from their petrifying gaze.

Tasha's last known location was the [[Lizard Marsh]] outside of [[Daggerford]] she went missing while hunting for prehistoric beasts that roamed the swamps.
