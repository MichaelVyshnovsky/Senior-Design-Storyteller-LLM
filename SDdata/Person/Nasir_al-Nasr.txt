Nasir al-Nasr, the Great Eagle, was the second Grand Caliph of Zakhara and an important historical figure of the Land of Fate.
After the death of his father, the first Grand Caliph, Nasir was faced with the onslaught of various factions vying for the rule of the new Zakhara. Through skilled wile, diplomacy, and military might, he was able to quell them all and secure the leadership of the entire continent. Nasir also relied heavily upon the wisdom of Fate to guide him through the turbulent times. Were it not for his strong rule and wisdom, the Land of Fate may have splintered into a collection of petty kingdoms instead of remaining strong as a united land.
