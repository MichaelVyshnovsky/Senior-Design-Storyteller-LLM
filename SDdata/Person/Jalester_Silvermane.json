        "mainbody": "Jalester Silvermane () was a captain of the City Watch of Waterdeep and the citys main Lords Alliance agent in 1492 DR.\nJalester was an earnest man. He often thought about his dead boyfriend Faerrel Dunblade. He was lonely and in search of love.\nJalester had a badge of the Watch.\nJalester spent much of his time in the Yawning Portal and other taverns that adventurers were known to frequent.\nJalester was an agent under the direct orders of Open Lord Laeral Silverhand, who ordered him to monitor the adventurers of the city. Durnan knew about his master and left Jalester alone. He was also friends with Elminster and Mirt.\nJalester was born in Cormyr and for a time he worked for the Steel Shadows mercenary company until some years before he and several members of the group left the Dales and settled in Waterdeep. There, he fell in love with his fellow mercenary Faerrel.\nIn 1491 DR, Elminster met and befriended the two young mercenaries and presented them to the Open Lord Laeral. Under the Lords orders, Jalester and Faerrel unveiled a sinister plot but Faerrel was killed.\nIn 1492 DR, Jalester was one of Laerals main field operatives.\nSome time later Jalester was instructed by Laeral to recover from Undermountain a runestone magic crystal for her. So telling to all he needed the crystal for himself Jalester hired adventurers to accomplished the mission."
