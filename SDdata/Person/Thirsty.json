        "mainbody": "'''Thirsty''' was [[Marlin Stormserpent]]'s pet [[stirge]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Unlike other stirges, Thirsty liked to sample blood from many different people, instead of draining one target to death.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|305-307|29}}",
        "Abilities": "Marlin Stormserpent often painted Thirsty's beak with a paralyzing [[poison]]. He had also trained the stirge well enough to know it was to go for a selected target first.",
        "Relationships": "Thirsty was of course Marlin's pet. Unknown to him, the evil [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]] sometimes took direct mental control of the stirge. It didn't like [[blueflame ghost]]s.",
        "History": "Marlin Stormserpent brought Thirsty to [[Castle Obarskyr]] in [[Suzail]], hidden within his jerkin, when he came with a retinue to steal the ''[[Wyverntongue Chalice]]'' under cover of darkness.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|81|7}} During the one skirmish they had with [[Purple Dragon knight]]s on patrol, Thirsty was instrumental in paralyzing the one who split out from the group to summon reinforcements.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|127-131|12}}\n\nMarlin again hid Thirsty in his jerkin when meeting the city watch later, the day he was informed of [[Gaskur]]'s murder, though he did not ultimately call on it.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|303|29}}\n\nThirsty was later eliminated by [[Mirt]] after it tried to attack him as the man entered the Royal Palace of Suzail.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|355-356|34}} Before the killing, Mirt had been last seen escaping out of [[Stormserpent Towers]], where he had an altercation with Marlin and his co-conspirators after Marlin had realized he was not a blueflame ghost."
