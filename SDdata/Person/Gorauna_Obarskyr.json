        "mainbody": "'''Gorauna Obarskyr''' was a politically powerful princess of [[Cormyr]] and the true power behind the throne during the [[Thronestrife]] period. A daughter of King [[Keldroun Obarskyr]], she and the [[Purplethroat Plague]] caused numerous deaths in her own family, allowing her to control the line of succession.",
        "History": "In the [[303 DR|Year of the Crimson Tiara, 303 DR]], her brother, King [[Gorann Obarskyr]], died of the Purplethroat Plague and the crown passed to his infant son, [[Edrae Obarskyr|Edrae]]. Two years later, in the [[305 DR|Year of the Barrows, 305 DR]], Gorann's wife, [[Jalanthra Obarskyr|Jalanthra]] killed Edrae  to spare him from Gorauna's torments.\n\nUpon Edrae's death, Gorauna's surviving brother [[Ulbaeram Obarskyr|Ulbaeram]] was crowned, reigning for three years before being slain by her husband [[Askran|Askran the Pretender]] in the [[308 DR|Year of Promise, 308 DR]]. The crown then passed to Queen [[Silbran Obarskyr|Silbran]], Ulbaeram's wife, to protect the succession of her son [[Raerboth Obarskyr|Raerboth]]. Silbran reigned until the [[320 DR|Year of the Bright Plumage, 320 DR]], when she abdicated the throne in favor of her 14-year-old son.\n\nGorauna slew Raerboth in the [[326 DR|Year of the Secret Slaughters, 326 DR]], and the crown passed to his infant son, [[Baerildo Obarskyr|Baerildo]], whom she killed two years later in the [[328 DR|Year of the Ermine Cloak, 328 DR]]. At Baerildo's death, his uncle, [[Belmuth Obarskyr|Belmuth the Bastard]], illegitimate son of Ulbaeram, took the throne. He reigned for six years before dying from the Purplethroat Plague in the [[334 DR|Year of the Humbled Fiend, 334 DR]]. Upon his father's death, [[Sargrannon Obarskyr|Sargrannon]] inherited the throne but was killed on orders from Gorauna by his uncle [[Ortolar Obarskyr|Ortolar]], who took the throne in the [[336 DR|Year of the Whipped Cur, 336 DR]]. Gorauna killed Ortolar a year later in the [[337 DR|Year of the Chosen's Blade, 337 DR]], and the throne passed to Sargrannon's younger brother [[Imbrus Obarskyr I|Imbrus I]], whom she killed in the [[338 DR|Year of the Envenomed Bolt, 338 DR]].\n\nIn the [[339 DR|Year of the Vanished Foe, 339 DR]], common-born [[Rathdar Orlenthar]] was appointed regent of the boy kings [[Artreth Obarskyr|Artreth]], [[Zoumdan Obarskyr|Zoumdan]], and [[Imbrus Obarskyr II|Imbrus II]]. All three died of the Purplethroat Plague by the [[341 DR|Year of the Black Wing, 341 DR]], and Gorauna's granddaughter [[Meurthe Obarskyr|Meurthe the Mad]] took the throne.\n\nThree more of her grandnieces and grandnephews would go on to have taken the throne and died after reigning for just one or two years by the [[348 DR|Year of the Dagger, 348 DR]].\n\nShe herself was killed by her great-grandson [[Thargreve Obarskyr the Greater]], sometime before [[360 DR]]."
