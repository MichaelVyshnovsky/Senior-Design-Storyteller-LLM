At one point while living together, Zia and Edgin found a [[sapphire dragonfly]] had gotten into their room as they lay in bed. As Edgin capered about trying to catch it, Zia simply laughed and opened a window to let it fly out.

Whilst Zia was pregnant with Kira in the mid-1480s DR, Edgin elected to join the [[Harpers]]. In a ceremony that took place beside a waterfall in the woods and was officiated by an [[elf|elven]] High Harper, Zia stood behind him, supporting his choice to work for a good cause and understanding the risk that he might be killed on a mission, even if it meant Kira grew up without a father..In the novelization, it is Zia who places the ''[[Harper pin]]'' on Edgin, which by Harper tradition in ''[[The Code of the Harpers]]'', page 40, could imply she is a Harper and his sponsor, unless this is not a necessity. In any case, in the movie, it is the High Harper who gives Edgin the pin so the question is moot.

In his four years or so with the Harpers, Edgin defended [[Faer√ªn]] from "creatures, crooks, and cretins" as he put it. But given his family's modest living standards, Edgin came to chafe at his Harper code, even though Zia hardly cared. She would try to cheer him up, such as by throwing a bit of [[carrot]] at him when in a playful mood and trying to break him out of his despondency.

Then, one night, four [[Red Wizards of Thay]] and Thayan assassins rode into Targos seeking revenge after Edgin and other Harpers had captured a Red Wizard in his treasure-stuffed lair. But Edgin was away, so they attacked Zia, but not before she was able to hide the newborn Kira in a hidden compartment in the wall. When Edgin came home, he found Zia laying dying of an injury inflicted by a ''[[Red Wizard blade]]'', meaning that no [[cleric]] could revive her.<ref name = "HAT" />

Years later, Edgin would be persuaded to try to steal a ''[[tablet of reawakening]]'', a magical relic capable of [[resurrection|resurrecting]] even one slain by the ''Red Wizard blade'', so that he might restore Zia to life. The ensuing heist would have disastrous consequences. Ultimately, though, Edgin would finally acquire the ''tablet of reawakening'' but his companion [[Holga Kilgore]] was then slain by the Red Wizard [[Sofina]] using a ''Red Wizard blade''. As he and Kira grieved, a sapphire dragonfly alighted on Edgin's arm and flew off, and he realized that his and Kira's relationship to Holga was now much more important than clinging to the memory of his lost wife. Thus, Edgin and Kira chose to use the ''tablet's'' one charge to revive Holga instead. As Zia had once told him, he had let her go.
