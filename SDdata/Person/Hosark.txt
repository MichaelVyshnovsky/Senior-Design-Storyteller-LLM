Hosark was an elf woodsman of the High Forest in the late 13 and early 14 century DR.
Hosark raised Travis Deepdell after the half-elf was abandoned as a baby outside his cottage some time around 1298 DR.
He was the owner and namesake of the magical Bow of Hosark. He wore +2 elven chainmail.
Circa 1338 DR, Hosark left his bow and his armor to Travis before he went west to Evermeet. Not knowing either Hosarks or the bows stories, Travis simply named it the Bow of Hosark in honor of his mentor.
