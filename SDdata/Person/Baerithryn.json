        "mainbody": "aerithryn, also known as Braer, was an elf wizard who tutored the young Elminster Aumar.\nBaerithryn was an elf living in the High Forest and a powerful wizard, one of the last to know the secret of the magic of becoming a weredragon. Braer was also a devoted worshiper of Mystra, a choice unusual for an elf.\nMystra herself in her mortal disguise asked Braer to tutor the young Elminster in magical art. Thus Braer became the first magical teacher of El. After Elminster learned all he could, the two parted ways.\nYears later, Elminster, by now a powerful wizard, came to ask for the help of Braer and his fellow elves in his insurrection against the Magelords of Athalantar. Braer agreed and was decisive in the battle. In the end, Braer transformed into a silver dragon and confronted the black dragon of magelord Undarl but both of them died in the resulting battle.\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryWorshipers of Mystra\nCategoryInhabitants of the High Forest\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryElves\nCategoryWeredragons\ntsfh8hpp72d1n007g2j789ngequ3n5p"
