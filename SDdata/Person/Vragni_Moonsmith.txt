Vragni Moonsmith was a dwarf mummy in the Deep Wastes in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1486 DR, Vragni and his retinue were ambushed and killed by drow from Szith Morcane. However, Vragni rose as a mummy and, with a now-undead retinue, slaughtered all living beings in the cavern where they were killed.
Vragni was eventually confronted by an adventuring party supported by a priestess of Eilistraee.
Vragni inflicted his vengeance upon all drow.
