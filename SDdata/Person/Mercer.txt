When her new husband fell victim of a ghostly possession, Mercer dismissed all servants from the mansion on the mistresss orders, leaving only her loyal butler Tarhun Mnemonis standing guard of the mansions main entrance. Mercer placed Furbleston, Bailey, Cyrilla, Jooli, Phubbs, and Chef Marjoram on temporary leave with the pay of half-wages and allowance to seek temporary employment somewhere else. The chamberlain issued a statement that this dismissal was done at no imputation of malfeasance and would be ended upon notice.
