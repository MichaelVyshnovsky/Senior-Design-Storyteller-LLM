'''Perch''' was [[Berun]]'s animal companion.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||11}}

==Description==
Perch had a green and brown head covered in scales, with a small horn on top of the nose. It had a membrane between its legs that it could spread out in order to glide, and its tail could come off.

==Powers==
Treeclaw lizards were not especially strong, but they could be used as guardians, they could glide, and they were extremely nimble and fast.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||10}}

==History==
Perch was already Berun's companion by [[Tarsakh 14]] of {{yearlink|1374}}.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||1}} The lizard was instrumental to his initial distraction of [[Taaki]], [[Sauk]]'s ''arumwon'', which eventually led to Berun's own capture.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||3}} The lizard was later instrumental to his escape from Sauk's group.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||9}} After Berun was separated from Lewan by a [[shambling mound]], Perch was instrumental to nursing him back to health, by bringing him eggs to eat.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||28}} The lizard was also instrumental to distracting the guards in the [[Fortress of the Old Man]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||30}} Perch slew [[Taaki]] on the night of [[Tarsakh 25]], after being swallowed whole.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||34}} The lizard continued to fight afterwards, but its utility was limited against the [[Old Man of the Mountain]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||40}} The lizard survived its master that night; Lewan carried it outside of the tower.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||41}}
