Dinnom Baraizal was one of the ten Cloakmasters of Athkatla for the Shadow Thieves around 1370 DR.
Dinnom was only a passable assassin, but in 1368 DR he was promoted by Rheax Bormul to the position of Cloakmaster of the Bridge district of Athkatla and proved a good choice.
Dinnom was only a mediocre assassin but proved to be an excellent planner and administrator. He made a blood oath with Rheax, which ensured his loyalty to Rheax. Dinnom actually had no intentions of betraying Rheax, who was his patron and whom he respected.
