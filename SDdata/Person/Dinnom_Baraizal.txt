'''Dinnom Baraizal''' was one of the ten Cloakmasters of [[Athkatla]] for the [[Shadow Thieves]] around [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Dinnom was only a passable assassin, but in [[1368 DR]] he was promoted by [[Rheax Bormul]] to the position of Cloakmaster of the Bridge district of Athkatla and proved a good choice.

==Personality==
Dinnom was only a mediocre assassin but proved to be an excellent planner and administrator. He made a blood oath with Rheax, which ensured his loyalty to Rheax. Dinnom actually had no intentions of betraying Rheax, who was his patron and whom he respected.
