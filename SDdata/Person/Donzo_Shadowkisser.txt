Donzo Shadowkisser was a halfling rogue who worked with the Stag Runners adventurers in the late 14 century DR.
Donzo was an archetypal rogue, a consistent hypocrite, and an extraordinary cheat and sneak.
Donzo was equipped with a magical suit of +3 leather armor and a magical +2 dagger. His tools of the trade included a bag of tricks and a small bag of holding.
In 1369 DR, Donzo and the other Stag Runners attended a royal party at Thistleflame Keep. Mendryll Belarod performed an insulting and bawdy song that targeted Sembites, provoking the Stag Runners into avenging their honor. The Stag Runners attacked Mendryll, but were defeated with the aid of another party of adventurers. The same night, the Stag Runners were also implicated in the murder of Partic Thistle by the Emerald Swords adventuring company.
