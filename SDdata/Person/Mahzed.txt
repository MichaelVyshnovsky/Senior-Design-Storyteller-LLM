'''Mahzed''' was a slave-trader and merchant from [[Thay]].

==Possessions==
Mahzed owned a wagon that he used to transport his goods and slaves. He armed himself with a [[dagger]] and [[hand crossbow]].

==History==
In the middle of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, one of the [[wizard]]s from a local Red Wizard enclave, led by a woman named [[Hinnar]], began selling locals into slavery of her own initiative. This underling, [[Kizzaf]], [[charm]]ed victims to follow her out of town. Two such victims, [[Talf]] and [[Elonn]] were heavily drugged and sold to Mahzed, who then began transporting them along with two criminals, who willingly had sold themselves into slavery to pay off their own debts.
