Zita was a laborer and a packer of the Baldurs Mouth Gazette in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Zita was an older, pale-skinned gold dwarf with a clean-shaved face. She had gray hair gathered in a braid and affixed around her head and blue eyes. Zita wore a loose white tunic.
In the , during the Absolute crisis, Zita was employed by Baldurs Mouth and could be found outside the broadsheet publishers office backing issues for delivery. She personally stopped reading the paper due to the sharply declined quality of reporting and Lord Gortashs propaganda. She also was used to hearing complaints about the broadsheets contents and simply sent everyone into the offices to talk to the editor-in-chief instead.
