'''Lucrezia''' was a mid-ranking cleric of [[Tiamat]] living in [[Unther]] in [[1374 DR]].

==Activities==
Lucrezia was a celebrant at the [[Altar of Scales]] temple in [[Unthalass]]. However, she was a spy sent by [[Tiglath]] from [[Messemprar]] to investigate [[Malise]]'s experiments.

==History==
Lucrezia arrived in Unthalass from Messemprar in 1374.

==Personality==
Lucrezia was very cautious in her spying and her cover worked. However she feared that [[Stendak]] suspected something.
