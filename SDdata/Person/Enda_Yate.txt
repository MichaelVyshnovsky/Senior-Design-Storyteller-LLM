'''Enda Yate''' was a [[halfling]] rogue in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1479 DR]].
 
==History==
In 1479 DR, having heard about a [[ruby]]-eyed-statue somewhere inside [[Undermountain]], Enda agreed to join the doomed [[Rutherford Urmbrusk]]'s party. When Rutherford disappeared, the halfling abandoned her companions in search of the statue, discovering the statue's general location. So Enda went back to the surface and recruited a large number of ruffians to help her in her treasure hunt.

So, leading a large group, Enda ventured back into the dungeon. However they met a large tribe of [[lizardfolk]] followers of [[Sess'innek]] and in the fighting most of the Enda's fellows were killed or captured.

Enda herself and a few of her ruffians hid in a room, praying for their lives with only Enda without any great injures.
