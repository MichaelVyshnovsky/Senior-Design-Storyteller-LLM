'''Shalthrin Hlastin''' was a renowned Merchant of [[Alaghôn]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Shalthrin famously compared successes of cities of the [[Vilhon Reach]] to the amount of attention they received from [[Arrabar]], the capital of [[Chondath]]. Suaveness brought attention, and attention brought danger, both military and political.
