Apsel the Scrimshander was a scrimshawer in Easthaven within the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale.
The older man dressed in dull grey clothing.
The scrimshawer carved items from scrimshaw including fine daggers. He often used knucklehead trout skulls for his goods.
In Mirtul, 1281 DR, Apsels workshop was ransacked by a ravenous wolf.
The same month, Apsel tried to warn the towners about the goblins he had seen to the south from Easthaven.
