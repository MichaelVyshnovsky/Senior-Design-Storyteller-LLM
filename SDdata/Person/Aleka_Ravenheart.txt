Aleka Ravenheart was an officer of the Purple Dragons in charge of the garrison of Thistleflame Keep in Suzail, who served in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Aleka had an athletic build and wore her black hair in a long braid.
She was dependable, dutiful, and took her position very seriously, though she could be lured into making foolhardy decisions.
She wore chainmail armor and carried a longsword, in addition to a ring of regeneration.
Aleka was good friends with Haverish Hallefon, innkeep of the Bubbling Bulwark and a former soldier in her regiment.
In 1369 DR, she was in charge of the 40-strong Purple Dragons garrison of Thistleflame Keep in Suzail.
Her investigation ultimately uncovered the involvement of the Emerald Swords adventuring company, who had actually kidnapped Lord Thistle and murdered the doppelganger Xixis in his place. As it was "merely kidnapping and not the murder of a noble, she had the authority to have the Swords exiled from Cormyr, rather than executed.
