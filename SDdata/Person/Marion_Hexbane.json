        "mainbody": "Marion Hexbane was a high-ranking member of the Blackdagger Bandits on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR.\nA hate-filled woman, Marion seemed to despise everyone she knew, from her bandit allies to the victims of her actions. She wrote it all down in her journal. She respected only Traven and Malus Blackdagger for their ambitions, that is, that they \"are willing to set their sights on so high a target\".\nMarion had a spellscar and deeply resented it, despite the fact that it increased her power. She was also some form of undead.\nIn the late 1470s DR, Marion oversaw the Blackdaggers shipwrecking and salvaging operations at Raven Cliff Beach. At her direction, the Blackdaggers extinguished the warning beacons and cause merchant vessels such as Xallianas to crash onto the rocks, whereupon the Blackdaggers would loot their wrecks and enslave the survivors. Marion based herself in the sea caves on Raven Cliff Beach. Marion was also involved in the Blackdaggers extortion plot against the merchant Melkhor Goldseeker, and sent her men to pressure him.\nFinally, in the , the Harper agent Xalliana—herself a victim of one of these wrecks—located Marions lair and had an adventurer go there and kill her. With Marions map and journal, they were able to dismantle the Blackdaggers."
