'''Korboz''' was king of the [[rock gnome]] clan at [[Gnomengarde]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He ruled alongside his husband, King [[Gnerkli]].

==Abilities==
In addition to his innate [[gnome|gnomish]] abilities, Korboz (like everyone else in Gnomengarde) had some training as a [[wizard]]. In combat, he preferred to attack with [[spells]] like ''[[ray of frost]]'' and ''[[magic missile]]''.

==Possessions==
Korboz wore a patchwork cape and a jagged metal crown to signify his status as king. He possessed a ''[[hat of wizardry]]'' which he was happy to part with as a show of gratitude to one who had earned his thanks.

==Relationships==
Korboz cared deeply for his husband, Gnerkli, although this manifested horrifyingly after he went mad and imprisoned Gnerkli ostensibly for his own protection.

==History==
Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century DR, around the same time that the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] began terrorizing the area around [[Phandalin]] and Gnomengarde, Korboz was attacked in his throne room by a [[mimic]] disguised as a rug. The shock drove him mad, and led to him fearing for his life and the life of his beloved Gnerkli. He imprisoned Gnerkli in their bedchamber by gluing him to a chair and jealously guarding the solvent that could free him, and then locked them both inside to let the mimic run wild through Gnomengarde. During this time, some of his subjects began calling him Mad King Korboz.
