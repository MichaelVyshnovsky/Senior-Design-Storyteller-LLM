Brother Dervarr was a priest of Chauntea inhabiting Immilmar in Rashemen during the late 14 century DR.
Brother Dervarr was in charge of the other priests within the House of Bhalla in Immilmar. He was focused on ensuring that Chaunteas worship in Rashemen did not stray too far from the doctrines established by the Church of Chauntea.
Dervarr was originally from Impiltur.
