'''Illasera''' was an [[elven]] [[Bhaalspawn]] who emerged as a member of the group known as [[the Five]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She was supremely confident in her abilities and prowess in battle.

==Possessions==
Illasera wore a suit of ''[[elven chainmail]]''.<ref group="note">In the ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal (novel)|Throne of Bhaal]]'' novel, Illasera wielded a bow and arrows that were inscribed with runes along the shatf.

==Relationships==
She was seen as one of the weaker members of the Five, and was held in low regard by the [[Bhaal]]ist priestess [[Amelyssan]].

==History==
Illasera was tasked by the Five with murder of their fellow sibling [[Abdel Adrian]]. To accomplish this feat, she and her allies set up an ambush for him and his companions near the [[Grove of the Ancients]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.

Abdel and his allies emerged victorious from the battle, and Illasera was slain.In the novelization, Abdel transforms into the [[Slayer]] and consumes Illasera.

===The Echo===
[[File:Murder tribunal.png|thumb|''Amelyssan, Illasera, and Sendai, with Sarevok on the Tribunal's throne.''|450x450px]]

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, a collection of Bhaalspawn: [[Amelyssan]], [[Abazigal]], Illasera, and [[Sendai]], were brought back as bloodied echoes of their former selves by [[Sarevok Anchev]], placing them on the [[Murder Tribunal]], hidden deep within [[Baldur's Gate]]'s [[Undercellar]], in the ruins of the [[Temple of Bhaal (Undercity)|Temple of Bhaal]].
