        "mainbody": "oward was an agent of the Harpers that operated out of Neverwinter during the late 15 century DR. She played an important role in coordinating the response against the emergent Cult of the Dragon.\nDuring the campaign against the cult, Boward dispatched adventurers to deal with cult-aligned dragons that appeared in various locales across the North, including Roth√© Valley, the Ebon Downs cemetery in the Silverwisp Swamp, the Whispering Caverns, and even far-off Icespire Peak. She also helped rally the defense of Neverwinter when dragons assailed the city, responding to the dragon Charthraxis that attacked Neverdeath graveyard.\nShe worked with various adventurers to outright slay any cult members they encountered.\nWhen the Cult of the Dragon became active across the Sword Coast during the 1480s DR, Boward began to recruit volunteer adventurers at Protectors Enclave in Neverwinter. She gained more information from her fellow Harper agent Windle, and informed adventurers about the ongoing schism of the cult, specifically the rise of Severin Silrajin within the organization.\nthumb|right|250px|The portal to Tuern that Boward helped secure for the Five Factions.\nBoward followed the Cult of the Dragons trail as they sought out the final resting place of the barbarian Cruven Gantara, as part of their effort to access the Flame Fault on Tuern, Dragonsoul Malthus sought to converse with the spirit of Gantaras former companion companion Belast Messandar at Neverdeath Graveyard. Fortunately, Malthus and his fellow cultists were thwarted by Boward and her new ally, the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge.\nDespite their best efforts the cult finally managed to open a portal to Tuern. In response, Boward orchestrated the Five Factions efforts to take control of the portal in Icewind Dale. A group of heroes including Alaeros Margaster, Barrowin Undurr, and Bowards fellow Harper Nymmestra Durothil fought a terrible battle against the cult, but proved successful in the end. When the Cult of the Dragon struck back against the allied forces, Boward then coordinated the factions defense of the portal, preventing it from falling into the cults possession once again.\nWhen it became apparent that the Cult and their Red Wizard allies led by the renegade Rath Modar were close to summoning Tiamat at her temple at the Well of Dragons, Boward took immediate action. She tasked some adventurers with infiltrating the cults compound and stealing Red Wizard supplies to gleam more information about their involvement."
