'''H'slaat''' was a [[troglodyte]] warrior in the [[Wormwrithings]] area in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the war chief and champion of [[Laogzed]] in the tribe led by [[S'slaar]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], he led a group of his warriors to defeat a [[drow]] patrol. The drow leader had a magic [[sword]] that was claimed as a trophy by chieftain S'slaar. H'slaat disagreed, saying that it was his by right of killing its owner. Soon a civil war started between S'slaar's and H'slaat's loyalists. H'slaat ordered the capture of [[H'hoort]], the mate of S'slaar.
