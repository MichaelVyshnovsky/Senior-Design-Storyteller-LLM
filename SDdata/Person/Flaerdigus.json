        "History": "The Crimmordown Turrets manse was infamous for its haunting. However, very few inhabitants of the state were willing to discuss the apparitions. Flaerdigus was the only servant willing to share his experiences with the infamous writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR. The attendant witnessed tall and cold sharp-spoken [[ghost]]. The apparition was covered in scales and had a [[serpent]]ine head and a tail. Flaerdigus saw the ghost some ten years before the interview with Volo, during a busy drunken revelry at the Crimmordown Turrets."
