'''Bevemar''' was a [[cleric]] and a member of the [[Shadow Thieves]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
Bevemar tolerated no backtalk from those she worked with, let alone those who worked for her.

==Activities==
Bevemar worked for both the assassin and the enforcer chapters of the guild in northern [[Amn]]. Sometimes, her work forced her to travel to [[Baldur's Gate]]. Her moniker derived for her habit of removing the tongues of debtors of the Shadow Thieves.
