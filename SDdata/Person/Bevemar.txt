Bevemar was a cleric and a member of the Shadow Thieves around 1370 DR.
Bevemar tolerated no backtalk from those she worked with, let alone those who worked for her.
Bevemar worked for both the assassin and the enforcer chapters of the guild in northern Amn. Sometimes, her work forced her to travel to Baldurs Gate. Her moniker derived for her habit of removing the tongues of debtors of the Shadow Thieves.
