        "Description": "Nordom had a green face with wide, elliptical eyes. Unlike most quadrones, Nordom had a second pair of arms instead of wings. Additionally, he had a lens welded to his body, which would drop over his right eye and function like a [[scope]].\n\nHe had the ability to see \"cracks in the Multiverse\" as he described them, which were in fact were [[portals]]. He displayed a lot of confusion and questioning regarding his own identity and individuality, as well as the world around him, seemingly unable to understand it in any way, especially before leaving the Rubikon. However, despite his rogue nature, he still felt the urge to follow orders and leadership.",
        "Possessions": "Nordom wielded a pair of [[gear spirit]]s that were shaped and functioned like [[crossbow]]s.",
        "History": "Nordom's last remembered directive before he went rogue was that he was to assist in constructing the Rubikon, which was an artificial dungeon created in the Plane of [[Limbo]] by [[modron]]s to study what attracts adventures to dungeons. The chaotic energies of the plane however, twisted all constructs within the Rubikon, resulting in the Evil Wizard Construct (designed as the \"final boss\" of the challenge) turning against it's creators and ignoring directives. Because of this, Nordom's overseer, the Creative Director, attempted to destroy the Evil Wizard, but was ultimately defeated. The loss of his leader, combined with the energy of limbo seeping into him, left him in a confused, directionless state, which resulted in him splitting off from the energies of [[Mechanus]] and becoming stuck in the Rubikon. He started having first signs of a personality, as he removed his wings and changed them into an extra pair of arms, as he suspected that he \"did not like them\". \n\n{{fq\n| text   = Absence of Name = Absence of Identity = Absence of Purpose = Absence of Place in Multiverse = Null State = Loss.
