        "mainbody": "Zanizyre Clockguard was a famous and fearsome gnome warlock of Tiamat as of the late 15 century DR.\nShe had tan skin, light brown hair, and hazel eyes. She was  tall and weighed .\nDespite her patron being indisputably evil, Zanizyre herself was a kind and cheerful do-gooder who always sought to aid the downtrodden with her powers, although this was perhaps a form of atonement for evils demanded by Tiamat. Indeed, Zanizyre was unable to disobey the orders of her patron, and would sometimes commit terrible crimes in her name. These weighed heavily on her, and occasionally sent her into bouts of melancholy. Despite this, Zanizyre expressed no desire to be released from her contract with Tiamat.\nZanizyre was curious and restless, rarely staying in one place in an endless quest for learning. She valued nothing more than solving a good mystery, and was reckless in the pursuit of knowledge.\nthumb|300px\nIn battle, Zanizyre was deadly and unpredictable, and favored fire magic. She possessed a pact boon in the form of a short sword known as Tiamats Fang, which was imbued with the powers of each of Tiamats five heads and allowed Zanizyre to choose its element whenever she summoned it. This gave her the flexibily to fight with fire, cold, acid, lightning, or poison as she needed.\nShe had the power to cast dominate dragon, which allowed her to compel dragons to serve her despite their usual resistance to such spells. She rarely used this power except in exceptional circumstances.\nZanizyre never revealed exactly how she came to be one of the very few mortals directly gifted power by Tiamat, and would only say that it was \"fate\". Rumors abounded, with the most common tale suggesting that she had earned Tiamats favor by rescuing an injured dragon wyrmling and bringing it to one of Tiamats temples. Others suggested that she had sold her soul for knowledge.\nIn her many journeys, she became beloved by many small communities for her timely interventions against attackers. Even so, it was wise to be wary of her presence given Tiamats terrible reputation.\nAt some point in the 15 century DR, Zanizyre passed through Longsaddle with three dragon hatchlings in tow, having rescued them from a cyclops in the Anauroch. The staff at the Gilded Horseshoe rushed to feed her and her dragons despite their depleted larder for fear of incurring Tiamats wrath. The dish they invented went on to be served at the tavern."
