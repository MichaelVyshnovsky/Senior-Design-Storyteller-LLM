'''Tarlgarth Vathar''' was a [[human]] stablemaster at the [[Yawning Portal]] inn in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
''Circa'' [[1375 DR]], Tarlgarth took care of the stables at the Yawning Portal inn with his two hostlers [[Burgaun Malsim]] and [[Rory Starkbuckle]]. If trouble broke out at the inn and Durnan was unavailable or incapacitated, he would get Durnan's horn and blow it to summon the [[Red Sashes]].

==Personality==
He was kind, highly observant, and wise to the ways of the world.

==Possessions==
He kept two ''+1 [[dagger]]s'' in sheaths inside his sleeves, and had other weapons stashed around the stables.
