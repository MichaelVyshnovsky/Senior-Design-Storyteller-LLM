Sarvo Droostan, also known as "Old Sarvo", was the tavern master of the Copper Coronet, a tavern in the river district of Athkatla, around the year 1370 DR.
Sarvo was about as fat as the casks of cheap ale and wine he kept in the cellar of the Coronet.
He was known as a weary but generally friendly man among the Coronets clientele,
