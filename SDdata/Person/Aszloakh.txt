Aszloakh the Hooded was the finhead saurial who was in charge of The Fools Altar dedicated to Finder Wyvernspur, located in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Aszloakhs moniker was given to him by inhabitants of the Gate because the saurial always wore a hooded weathercloak when outside on the city streets. He had a deep and rumbling voice and had many years of service to the Church of Finder Wyvernspur under his belt. Personality-wise, Aszloakh always remained patient and calm, even in the face of danger. The finhead saw humans from a friendly, humorous, yet cynical lens. He expected to be lied to and betrayed.
The Hooded one carried an enchanted staff, but its powers were unknown to most, even Elminster Aumar.
