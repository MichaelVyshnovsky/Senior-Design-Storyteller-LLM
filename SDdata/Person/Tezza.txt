'''Tezza''' was a maid at the [[The Rising Moon (inn)|The Rising Moon]] in [[Highmoon]] in [[Deepingdale]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Tezza was old but sharp-eyed.

==Activities==
During spring cleaning each year in the 1350s DR, Tezza would clean the [[glass]] and [[mica]] windows, fearing they were too valuable for [[Shandril Shessair]]'s hands.
