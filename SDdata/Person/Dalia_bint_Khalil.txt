Dalia bint Khalil was a the youngest daughter of Grand Caliph Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Like her older sister Janya, Dalis lived in the Royal Harim for the first few years of her life before being moved to a secure location within Al-Akara Mountains. She still visited her parents on a regular basis.
Dalia was the child of Khalil and his most favored wife Tanya bint Perijan. Her name was Khalils way of honoring is first wife, Dalilah al-Nakar, though he of course received Tanyas permission before naming her.
