He decided to leave to seek fame and fortune, and met his fellow adventurers, Nanoc and Tim Goldenhand in a tavern. From there, they foolishly decided to enter the Underdark, and he encountered the mad wizard Iycanths creations. The creatures quickly petrified the trio, turning them to stone.\nHis companions mocked him for not being able to backstab a floating eyeball."
