        "mainbody": "Lady Inkeri Margaster was the leader of House Margaster in the late 15 century DR.\nDuring his time as Open Lord of Waterdeep, Dagult Neverember with the complicity of Inkeri, stole millions from Waterdeeps reserve.\nIn the , Lady Inkeri allied with the drow of House Hunzrin and together they managed a business involving demonic phylacteries.\nIn early 1488 DR, in Neverwinter, the halfling rogue Regis spied on the mysterious agreement between Lord Dagult Neverember and Lady Inkeri involving the fate of the Thornhold fortress. Some time later, Regis met Lady Inkeri and her cousin Alvilda Margaster at the Driftwood Tavern near Neverwinter. The Margasters held a party and during the dances Regis gained some useful information from his dance partner Alvilda about Inkeris plots, and also managed to witness the demonic possession of Inkeri. Afterward, Charri Hunzrin convinced Inkeri to ally with Matron Mother Zhindia Melarn against Drizzt and Zaknafein.\nLater that year, Alvilda gave birth to a child named Sharon, who appeared somehow corrupted, perhaps as a result of the familys trade in demonic phylacteries. Their conflict came to a head when Alvilda and Inkeri managed to capture Regis and Dahlia Sinfelle, who had infiltrated the Margaster estate in Waterdeep. Instigated by Sharon, the two cousins fully transformed into demons, with Alvilda becoming a bar-lgura and fought each other, until Alvilda beheaded Inkeri.\nInkeri was the leader of the Margasters living in Waterdeep. Her main collaborators were her brother, Brevindon and her cousin, Alvilda. She and Alvilda grew very close to each other, even considering each other sisters instead of cousins.\nInkeri housed inside herself the demonic phylactery of a bar-lgura follower of Demogorgon, in truth not a simple bar-lgura but Bar-lgura, the namesake of the whole demonic race."
