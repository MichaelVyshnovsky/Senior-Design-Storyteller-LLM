'''Gvrag''' was a [[bugbear]] bandit of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He served [[Skar]] and ultimately [[Hekkut]] and [[the Hark]].{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/"Extermination" Plot Recap}}

==Description==
He had a hulking but stooped figure.

==Possessions==
Like many bugbears, he fought with [[morning star]], [[:Category:Light shields|light wooden shield]], and [[javelin]]s and wore [[leather armor]], and may have had a ''[[potion]] of [[cure light wounds]]''.

==History==
Late one afternoon in [[Eleasias]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Gvrag and Skar and two other [[goblin]]s caught the [[halfling]] merchant [[Blaz Merrymar]] on the road between [[Loudwater]] and [[Shining Falls (village)|Shining Falls]]. While Gvrag held Blaz in the air, Skar tormented and tortured him with a lit [[torch]]. Fortunately for Blaz, a newly formed band of [[adventurer]]s happened upon the scene and rescued him, slaying Gvrag and the others.
