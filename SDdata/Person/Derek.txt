Derek was a skeleton warrior captain of the guard who dwelled in the Accursed Tower of Icewind Dale, doomed to unlife by a dying curse of a priest of Myrkul.
In his undead state, Derek was tall, , likely indicating him being a local human from Icewind Dale, likely Ten Towns.
Even in death, Derek was outfitted with a magical +1 chainmail and a magical +1 broadsword.
Derek died, along with the rest of the people at the Accursed Tower, around 1269 DR, when the demons summoned by the towers owner Damien Morienus, caused the Great Thaw. The tower sank into the melted permafrost, killing everyone inside. One of the people inside was a priest of Myrkul, Yarmuth the Brown, who cursed the Tower with his dying breath. The curse turned everyone who died inside the tower into the undead. The curse was still potent in 1369 DR.
A hundred years later, a group of adventurers tasked with finding the tower encountered Derek sitting on the edge of the desk in the Guard Captains Room, joyfully staring at them, and waving them in, only to attack them with his magical broadsword. The encounter resulted in the skeletons destruction.
