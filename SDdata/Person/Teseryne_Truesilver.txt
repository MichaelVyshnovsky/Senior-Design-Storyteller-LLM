Teseryne Truesilver was a half-elf bard who lived in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Her mother was the famed bard Talanthe Truesilver, composer of "The Ballad of the Dream Weaver".The Truesilver name suggests a connection to the Truesilver noble house of Cormyr, but this may just be coincidental. She was a cousin of Lisyil Sweetwhisper, the herald to High Lord Kalahar Twohands of Loudwater.
Teseryne had lived all her life in the Delimbiyr Vale. By the early 1370s DR, she made her home in a cottage on the north bank of the Delimbiyr River, near Loudwater. It was nestled amongst flower gardens that produced a dazzling range of colors and shapes when in full bloom. A cobblestone path wended through them to door. Bird houses, a half-dozen at least, were placed around the gardens, with some mounted on poles, others mounted in the trees, and others hanging from the cottages eaves.
Teseryne had a distinct elven heritage, with angled eyes of amethyst hue and thick silvery hair. She was very beautiful, in a refined and ethereal way. She favored elven-style dresses of loose and flowing design.
She knew much local lore and history of the Delimbiyr Vale and Eaerlann. She would not receive visitors after nightfall, but during the day would invite them in for a repast such as shortbread and spearmint tea while they spoke.
In the spring of the , a group of adventurers visited Teseryne at her cottage when seeking information about the Half-Elven Renegades. She did, relating what she knew of the Renegades and their leader, "Princess" Tianna Skyflower.
In the middle of the , Teseryne told tales of the adventurers quests and events in Loudwater and the Vale in the past year. One of these she learned from the grig prince Feythrin.
