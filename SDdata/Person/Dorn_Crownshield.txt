Dorn Crownshield was a dwarf mercenary in Melvaunt in 1374 DR.
Dorn was an orc slayer of renown.
In 1374 DR, he met the aristocrat Kalman Leiyraghon at The Rusty Bucket tavern. He presented to him his friends Argens Bruil, Elaint Marsk, Kara Calaudra, and Oreal Nanther and explained that they were planning an adventure together. Dorn offered his support.
They found a "treasure map" (in truth, a trap devised by Bremen Leiyraghon) and went to adventure in Thar, only to be captured by the orog Daazlag and his orc minions. Dorn was killed immediately.
