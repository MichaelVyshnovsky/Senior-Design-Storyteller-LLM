'''Dorn Crownshield''' was a [[dwarf]] mercenary in [[Melvaunt]] in [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Dorn was an [[orc]] slayer of renown.

In 1374 DR, he met the aristocrat [[Kalman Leiyraghon]] at [[The Rusty Bucket]] tavern. He presented to him his friends [[Argens Bruil]], [[Elaint Marsk]], [[Kara Calaudra]], and [[Oreal Nanther]] and explained that they were planning an adventure together. Dorn offered his support.

They found a "treasure map" (in truth, a trap devised by [[Bremen Leiyraghon]]) and went to adventure in [[Thar]], only to be captured by the [[orog]] [[Daazlag]] and his [[orc]] minions. Dorn was killed immediately.
