        "History": "Hoshin's early history was shrouded in mystery: some said he was a samurai fleeing his household after a love affair with a clan rival's daughter; he was a pirate and the only survivor after a shipwreck; he was an impostor searching for a good hiding spot for illegal activities as a yakuza or ninja; or he might be an illegitimate son of the [[shogun]]. The only clear fact was that as a young man he presented himself at the gate of the [[Floating Cloud Monastery]], a temple following the [[Path of Enlightenment|Way of Enlightenment]] philosophy. He remembered nothing from before that time.\n\nHoshin often traveled Kozakura spreading the teachings of the Way of Enlightenment. One of his goals was to go to [[Shou Lung]] to visit the birthplace of Way of Enlightenment.\n\nIn [[1357 DR]], Hoshin was among the candidates considered by [[Ko Mei Kho]] for a mission in [[Akari]].\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], Hoshin was traveling to Shou Lung to visit the [[Cliffs of Tanghai]] when he was possibly approached by [[Ko Ho San]]."
