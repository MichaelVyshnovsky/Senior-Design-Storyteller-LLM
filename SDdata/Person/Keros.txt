'''Keros the Wanderer''' was an outcast [[triton]] hero.

==History==
Born in [[1354 DR]], Keros joined the clergy of [[Persana]]. However, during the [[Twelfth Serôs War]], during the [[morkoth]] attack on [[Abydos]] to steal artifacts, he inadvertently acquired the ''[[Claw of Xynakt]]'' on himself, thwarting the plans of [[Axar Xyrl]]. However, Keros was considered impure by his fellow tritons and cast out of Abydos. He started wandering [[Serôs]] in order to avoid his morkoth pursuers.

Keros resurfaced during the final battle at [[Myth Nantar]], where he saved the life of the [[merfolk]] princess [[Arina]]. After the war, he remained for a time in the city but the ''[[mythal]]'''s influence made it hard for Keros to control the Claw, so in [[1370 DR]] he left Myth Nantar.

==Legends==
Some believed Keros was the chosen of his god, "Persana's Blade".

==Relationship==
Keros always traveled with his loyal [[hippocampus]] [[Swiftide]]. During the war, he gained some friends and enemies. Among the former were some [[dukar]]s and Princess Arina.
