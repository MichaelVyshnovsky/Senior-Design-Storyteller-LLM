'''Zaralda''' was a [[necromancer]] and [[Red Wizard of Thay]] in [[Kryptgarden Forest]] in [[1489 DR]].

==History== 
In 1489 DR, she went to Kryptgarden where, in order to broker an alliance with the old or new factions of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], she helped [[Claugiyliamatar]] to corrupt the forest.

In the end, however, an adventuring party hired to defeat Old Gnawbones, aided by the [[archfey]] [[Witchthorn]], assaulted and defeated her and her [[wight]] minions.{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|38}}
