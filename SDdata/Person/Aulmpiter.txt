Aulmpiter was a nycaloth and a member of the Trio Nefarious and leader of the Army of Darkness that assaulted Myth Drannor in the early 8 century DR.
Aulmpiter was first summoned to the Realms by the Netherese archwizard Aldlas Sodhese. Aldlas set them forth on the task to locate the Nether Scrolls, thought to be somewhere in the elven lands. For three months, the Trio Nefarious ravaged the elven lands until they met with the army of Cormanthyr and were captured and imprisoned. Nearly 2 millennia later, they escaped and began raising an army that soon descended upon Cormanthyr.
On Flamerule 15, the , in the battle known as Banes Duel, Aulmpiter was slain in battle by Captain Fflar Starbrow Melruth, five days before Myth Drannor fell to the remains of the army.
