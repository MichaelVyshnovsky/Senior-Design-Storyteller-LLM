'''Taska Sonadora''' was a sea captain in [[Waterdeep]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==Activities==
Taska was an insane noble who wanted to use all her wealth on bold and foolish adventures. One of her crazy goals was to kill a [[white dragon]]. Her ship, the ''[[Bobbin' Flagon]]'', was stocked with the finest food and drink.

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], Taska was possibly hired to accompany an adventuring party to [[Svardborg]].
