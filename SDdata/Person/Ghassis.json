        "mainbody": "King Ghassis was a lizard king\nGhassis was the leader of the Servants of the Royal Egg mercenary company. He hired out his warriors to anyone who had the coin, charging extra if his troops were to be used as cannon fodder. Ghassis cared little for the other lizard men of the company since he had access to a nearly limitless supply of new warriors. These new recruits were supplied via spelljammer ships from Realmspace.\nGhassis was unique in that he was able to capture, and master, the use of a trio of Halruaan skyships."
