        "mainbody": "Irvel Duar Palaghard Obarskyr, reigning as Irvel I, was a crown prince and later king of Cormyr who started his reign when his father, King Foril I, died in his sleep in 1486 DR. He died months later on Uktar 14 of the same year during the Shadovars attack against Suzail.\nIrvel was tall and bearded. His looks were associated with Cormyrs previous notable kings. This was also true of his personality, having been described as being bold.\nHe was well liked by the people for both for his courage and approachability. Irvel was kind and boisterous. He had a taste for both strong drink, aided by his high tolerance for alcohol, and the company of attractive women. Nevertheless, Irvel always swore he would never break his marriage vows to his wife, Ospra Goldfeather. There were, however, rumors at court that he interpreted those vows in a more flexible manner compared to his predecessors.\nIrvel loved his wife, his son and daughter, the men under his command, and his country, and was loved by them in turn.\nWhen Irvel was Crown Prince, he was one of the many authorities that could grant Royal Charters to adventuring companies, and did so from the Royal Court in Suzail.\nIrvel Duar Palaghard Obarskyr was born in the , during the reign of King Azoun V, to then second in-line to the throne Prince Foril I and his wife the Princess Jemra Rhindaun, a year after the couple married. Irvel was born healthy. He was raised in Castle Obarskyr with his cousin Erzoured, who was the illegitimate son of Prince Emvar, as if the two were siblings.\nGiven the fact that his mother Jemra was the niece of Queen Sybille II of Tethyr,\nIn the , Prince Irvel married Ospra Goldfeather. Due to the scandalous history of House Goldfeather, the union created a furor among the nobility. House Crownsilver in particular did all they could to prevent the union.\nFollowing the untimely demise of his uncle, Crown Prince Emvar Obarskyr, during a Sembian ambush in the , and the death of King Azoun V, which resulted in his fathers ascension as Cormyrs king in the , Irvel became the Crown Prince of Cormyr, a position he held for most of his life during Forils 37-year reign.\nHe was a well-respected prince in the eyes of both commoners and the nobility. The comparisons drawn between his boldness and that of King Azoun IV led to the perception that interesting times were ahead for Cormyr. However, his father was of the opinion that Irvel was seen by the nobility as na√Øve and gullible.\nDuring Irvels tenure as Crown Prince (1449 DR to 1486 DR), he was given command of Cormyrs armed forces, carrying all the powers and responsibilities associated with the Lord High Marshal of the Realm, though he never held the title formally. At that time, some believed that he would take one of his middle names as a regal name when he eventually ascended the throne, to inspire the same reverence given to previous kings Duar and Palaghard. This never came to pass. \nFrom the  to the , Cormyr fought a war against Returned Netheril and Sembia. It was during this conflict that King Foril I died in his sleep on Eleint 5, making Irvel Cormyrs King."
