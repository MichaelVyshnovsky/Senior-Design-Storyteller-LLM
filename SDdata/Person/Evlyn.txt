'''Evlyn''' was a [[Moonstone Mask]] employee in [[Neverwinter]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
If the [[Kalach-Cha]] and the companions entered the establishment, she would scold them if they did not spend any money at the establishment.

Later, when Ammon Jerro came with the demons, she stood in his way. This proved a fatal mistake, since she died.
