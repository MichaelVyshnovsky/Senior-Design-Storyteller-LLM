        "mainbody": "Hauzz Trarach was a drow matron mother in the early 11 century DR.\nHauzz ruled House Trarach in Menzoberranzan, a small house. She plotted to one day elevate her eldest daughter to the Ruling Council.\nIn 1018 DR, Hauzz with her elder children Daungelina Trarach and Duvon Trarach planned an attack on House Simfray and after being reassured about the wizards they had hired from House Xorlarrin and about the presumably very talented Simfray weapon master Zaknafein, the matron mother ordered the attack.\nAfter the attack failed completely, Hauzz together with her youngest daughter Dabnay Trarach protested about the failure with Horroodissomoth Xorlarrin, who informed her about the survival of Duvon.\nHowever, it was Zaknafein disguised as Duvon who arrived at the House Trarach complex and quickly killed Hauzz."
