Drexa was the chieftain of the Blackmaw lizardfolk tribe at the Fane of the Eye under Tyar-Besil and a member of the Cult of the Crushing Wave during the Elemental Evil crisis.
The lizard king believed that he should be one of the leaders of the Crushing Wave. He dreamed of overthrowing Gar Shatterkeel one day.
Drexa led his tribe in the worship of Olhydra with the counsel of the shaman Sskesh.
In 1491 DR, Drexa and his tribe were at the Fane of the Eye until some adventurers infiltrated the Fane and confronted and defeated him and his minions.
