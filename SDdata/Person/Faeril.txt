'''Faeril''' was a [[half-elf]] [[fighter]]-[[cleric]], member of the [[Mystra]]-worshiping sect founded by [[Anorrweyn Evensong]]. She joined the expedition to [[Myth Drannor]] along with other adventurers confronting the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
Faeril was a tall blonde-haired woman of athletic build. She preferred to wear the garb of green color.

==Personality==
Selflessly, Faeril was quick to raise her weapon and shield in aiding the good and defending her friends.

==Abilities==
Faeril was proficient in both combat and healing magic. Her combat reflexes and ability to cast spells in close combat often saved the lives of her and her friends.

==Possessions==
In 1369 DR, she went to battle armored with a magically enhanced ''+1 [[full plate]]'' and armed with a magical ''+3 [[warhammer]]''.

She also carried her ''[[staff of flamestrike]]'', a [[birch]]-carved magic [[quarterstaff]] that gave the user ability to cast ''[[Flame strike|flamestrike]]'' spell.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], Faeril, alongside a fellow cleric of Mystra [[Beriand]] joined the expedition to Myth Drannor, along with other adventurers who answered Elminster's call for aid against the Cult of the Dragon that planned to use the ruins' ''[[mythal]]s'' and the ''Pools of Radiance'' to conquer the region.

Faeril's group was ambushed by [[orc]]s and a fire-breathing creature{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030409112020/http://www.pool-of-radiance.com/story/chars.htm| title = Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor website | accessdate = 03-04-2003| date = 03-04-2003}} who slaughtered most of the adventurers. Thankfully, Faeril managed to drag the bling cellar away from danger. Together, the two survivors found shelter in [[Stillwater Ruins]], behind the protection of an elven ''word of power''. Faeril kept the blind cleric safe with her life.

Eventually, a group of adventurers from [[Phlan]], the [[Veiled Ones]], arrived at the ruins to join the forces opposing the cult. The heroes aided the survivors, and after they liberated the shrine of Mystra in [[Nightingale Court]] from [[Dark naga|dark nagas]], Faeril joined the heroes in their quest to stop [[Kya Mordrayn]] and [[Pelendralaar]].
