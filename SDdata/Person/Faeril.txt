Faeril was a half-elf fighter-cleric, member of the Mystra-worshiping sect founded by Anorrweyn Evensong. She joined the expedition to Myth Drannor along with other adventurers confronting the Cult of the Dragon in 1369 DR.
Faeril was a tall blonde-haired woman of athletic build. She preferred to wear the garb of green color.
Selflessly, Faeril was quick to raise her weapon and shield in aiding the good and defending her friends.
Faeril was proficient in both combat and healing magic. Her combat reflexes and ability to cast spells in close combat often saved the lives of her and her friends.
In 1369 DR, she went to battle armored with a magically enhanced +1 full plate and armed with a magical +3 warhammer.
She also carried her staff of flamestrike, a birch-carved magic quarterstaff that gave the user ability to cast flamestrike spell.
In 1369 DR, Faeril, alongside a fellow cleric of Mystra Beriand joined the expedition to Myth Drannor, along with other adventurers who answered Elminsters call for aid against the Cult of the Dragon that planned to use the ruins mythals and the Pools of Radiance to conquer the region.
Faerils group was ambushed by orcs and a fire-breathing creature who slaughtered most of the adventurers. Thankfully, Faeril managed to drag the bling cellar away from danger. Together, the two survivors found shelter in Stillwater Ruins, behind the protection of an elven word of power. Faeril kept the blind cleric safe with her life.
Eventually, a group of adventurers from Phlan, the Veiled Ones, arrived at the ruins to join the forces opposing the cult. The heroes aided the survivors, and after they liberated the shrine of Mystra in Nightingale Court from dark nagas, Faeril joined the heroes in their quest to stop Kya Mordrayn and Pelendralaar.
