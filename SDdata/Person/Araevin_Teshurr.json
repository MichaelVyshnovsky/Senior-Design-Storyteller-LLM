        "mainbody": "'''Araevin Teshurr''' was a [[sun elf]] [[wizard]] of [[Evermeet]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relations": "Araevin's parents had both been dead for over one hundred years by 1374 DR. He had a sister, [[Sana Teshurr]], who lived in [[Drelegara]], and cousins [[Eredhor]] and [[Erevyella]], who both had children. He was distantly related to [[Elorfindar Floshin]].\n\nAraevin carried the blood of [[House Dlardrageth]] through some unknown bonding in the distant past, and this technically made him a member of the house but he was not evil like them.\n\nHis betrothed was [[Ilsevele Miritar]] until she broke their engagement after falling in love with ally [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]].\n\nBefore [[1364 DR]], Araevin's familiar, [[Whyllwyst]], died.",
        "Description": "Araevin was tall by sun elf standards, and stood about the height of an average [[human]].",
        "Home": "He had been living at [[Tower Reilloch]] on Evermeet for eighty years by 1374 DR.",
        "Possessions": "Araevin wore a [[mithril]] [[chain shirt|mail shirt]] and a magical scarlet [[cloak]] that conveyed protection and warding. He carried the blade of [[House Teshurr]], a magical [[longsword]] named ''[[Moonrill]]''.",
        "History": "Araevin was born around [[1108 DR]],<ref group=\"note\">Araevin is said to be 266 years old in 1374 DR. at the [[House of Cedars]], where he explored the surrounding trails as a child.\n\nAraevin spent years traveling [[northwest Faerûn]] studying elven ''[[portal]]s'' and spell structures after finding that Evermeet's libraries were not sufficient. Most of these were relics of [[Illefarn]] or [[Siluvanede]]. In order to explore the ruins of these realms, he formed the [[Company of the White Star]].\n\nAraevin was accepted for training as a [[High Mage]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, though his actual training was not due to begin for 50 more years.\n\nHowever, events that unfolded soon after his acceptance, such as the attack by the [[daemonfey]] and the [[Elven Crusade]] of Lord [[Seiveril Miritar]] later forced him to travel to [[Faerûn]]. There, he found an ancient loregem (''[[selu'kiira]]'') from ancient elven empire of [[Aryvandaar]] and by gathering all the pieces, he gained the knowledge of how to cast [[high magic]].According to author Richard Baker, [https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheForgottenRealmsArchives/permalink/1267012663402289 here], \"My intention was that Araevin became a half-celestial, although just the \"celestial creature\" template might be enough--in game terms, I figured that he needed his type to change to Outsider in order to solo \"trans-mortal\" Elven High Magic. The actual transformation scene is near the end of Farthest Reach. Sort of the inverse of what the Dlardrageths did to themselves a few thousand years ago. Hope that helps!\""
