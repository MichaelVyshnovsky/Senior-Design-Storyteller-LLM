'''Constal''' was a [[War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Constal was a part of the retinue of the [[Royal Magician of Cormyr]], [[Caladnei]] in early spring of {{yearlink|1373}}, when they raided the [[Marsember]] meeting of the [[Rightful Conspiracy]]. He was assigned afterwards to hunt down Regal Lady [[Mistwind]] who'd picked the location for her nightly manhunt, but to let her escape in the end.
