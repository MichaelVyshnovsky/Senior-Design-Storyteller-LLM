Donnola Topolino was the granddaughter of Pericolo Topolino, the Grandfather of Assassins in Delthuntle, Aglarond. She served as one of the captains of Morada Topolino (the house of Topolino), along with the mage Wigglefingers.
Donnola was a skilled socialite who served as the eyes and ears for her grandfather. She was also trained as a pickpocket. She was skilled with the rapier and dirk.
Donnola was seen as quite beautiful. She had light brown hair, a button nose, freckles, dimples, and wide brown eyes.
Donnola took Spider Parrafin (the reincarnated Regis) under her wing and they became quite close. In 1481 DR, they became lovers. Although he was forced to flee Delthuntle, he resolved to come back for her at some point in the future.
