        "mainbody": "Andzrel Baenre was the weapons master of House Baenre and a commander of the Army of the Black Spider.\nAndzrel wore black mithral plate and a dark cloak. He was tall and disciplined. \nHe was the son of one of Quenthel Baenres cousins, a thus a noble, but not a very high one.\nAndzrel was once polymorphed into a riding lizard by Nauzhror Baenre and promptly bit him in the buttocks. Since then their relationship was somewhat strained.\nWhen Triel Baenre ordered the formation of the Army of the Black Spider in 1372 DR, she placed Andzrel as its commander. Although Andzrel was very capable, Nimor Imphraezl (disguised as Captain Zhayemd of House Agrach Dyrr) was able to charm Andzrel into taking his misleading advice.\nForming a decisive plan against the armies of Gracklstugh, Andzrel led the drow to the defense of the Pillars of Woe, where the army was betrayed by the plans of Nimor. He tasted his first defeat there both as a commander and as a warrior when he faced Nimor Imphraezl in personal combat (although Nimor was defeated with magical aid, but was nonetheless able to escape via his ring of shadow).\nSometime later, Gromph Baenre and Andzrel disguised themselves as tanarukks and entered the enemy camp. Gromph attached a light gem to Nimor to prevent him shadow-walking. However, in the process, Gromph himself was blinded.\nIn 1463 DR, Andzrel was still serving as House Baenres weapons master, with Tiago Baenre serving as his first assistant until he left for Gauntlgrym.\nWar of the Spider Queen\n* Condemnation\n* Extinction (minor)\nNeverwinter Saga\n* Charons Claw\n* The Last Threshold (mentioned)\nCategoryDrow\nCategoryHouse weapon masters\nCategoryMembers of House Baenre\nCategoryInhabitants of Menzoberranzan\nCategoryInhabitants of the Northdark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Upperdark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryExotic weapon masters\n0o5v4npan99h6ehcc5zl7q8v78pdz1u"
