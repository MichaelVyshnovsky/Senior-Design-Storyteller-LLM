        "mainbody": "'''Jorunhast''' was the High Wizard of [[Cormyr]] in the early 11{{th}} to later 13{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. He was the pupil of [[Thanderahast]] and killed the regent [[Salember Obarskyr]] in [[1286 DR]], for which he was known as '''Jorunhast Kingslayer'''. In exile afterward, he built the [[Tower of Stars]] on [[Traitor's Isle]]. Later in life, he settled in [[Ser么s]] and joined the [[Dukar]]s.",
        "Description": "Around 1018 DR, he was broad-shouldered and muscular, a handsome man to the opposite gender. By [[1188 DR]], Jorunhast was still broad-shouldered and handsome, with his great age barely apparent, but he had grown fat around the waist. He thought of himself as looking like a baker or [[Church of Lathander|Lathanderite]] friar.<ref> As of [[1227 DR]], his stomach now hung over his belt. At the time, he donned expensive [[robe]]s of vivid red and black, with a mage's sigil embroidered in gold thread on the breast.<ref>",
        "History": "As an apprentice wizard, Jorunhast fought against the [[red dragon]]s who invaded [[Suzail]] in the {{YearlinkName|1018}}. He rescued a young lady from a window in the burning [[Castle Obarskyr]], but he fell out of favor with Prince [[Azoun II]], who had been courting her. Jorunhast pursued the [[black dragon]] [[Thauglor]] and battled him in the [[King's Forest]]. Although Jorunhast panicked when faced with Thauglor and tried to prevent Azoun from attacking before the prince laid the decisive blow, Azoun forgave him and the pair were subsequently on better terms.\n\nWhen King [[Azoun III]] died in the {{YearlinkName|1275}}, Prince [[Rhigaerd]] was only six years old, so Azoun III's brother [[Salember Obarskyr]] took the throne of Cormyr as regent. However in the {{YearlinkName|1286}}, Salember plotted to kill Rhigaerd and take the throne, leading Cormyr into civil war. During a parlay, Salember attacked Rhigaerd but Royal Magician Jorunhast stepped in and slew the regent. From then on, he was known as Jorunhast Kingslayer. Jorunhast's choice made Rhigaerd disband the Royal Magician position until the {{YearlinkName|1306}}, when the king appointed [[Vangerdahast]].\n\nAfter his exile, Jorunnhast settled in Ser么s and joined the Dukars as their [[Kupavi]] lorekeeper with loyalty to [[Gayar]]. After the [[Twelfth Ser么s War]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, he was granted a seat on the [[Nantarn Council]],",
        "Possessions": "As of [[1371 DR]], Jorunhast's sealed Tower of Stars still existed on Traitor's Isle, an island in [[Prespur]] on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].",
        "Religion": "Jorunhast worshiped [[Mystra]]."
