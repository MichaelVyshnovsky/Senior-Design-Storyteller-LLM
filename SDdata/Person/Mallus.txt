'''Mallus''' was a tall [[human]] [[fighter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who died while on an expedition in the [[Shining Sea]] after becoming infected by [[olive slime]]s.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|20}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|21}} sometime around the month of [[Flamerule]], a group of eccentric entertainers, entrepreneurs, and scientists embarked upon a colonizing expedition to an island they discovered in the Shining Sea off the coast of [[Chult]], which they dubbed the "[[Forgotten Island]]". Led by a charismatic [[Waukeenar]] [[priest]] named [[Devlin (Ravens Bluff)|Devlin]], they sought to create a tourist attraction on the isle that would attract people from all across the Realms.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2,4}} Three months later, things began to go awry for the expedition.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2}}

On [[Marpenoth 11]], five [[velociraptor]]s infected with [[olive slime]]s attacked the [[Devlin's camp|campsite's]] messhall. The group managed to slay them all, but not without Mallus becoming injured and his fellow fighter [[Argus]] dying.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|7-8}} Sailing off the island began to be considered, but could not be pursued as heavy storms kept everyone in the campsite over [[Marpenoth 13]] and [[Marpenoth 14|14]]. On the 14{{th}}, well before dawn, Devlin observed Mallus devouring a day's worth of [[ration]]s in the camp's kitchen.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|22}}

The next day, it was noted by Devlin that Mallus had stopped sleeping and had spread his condition to [[Ledro Kile]], and he had observed them together eating a [[dinosaur]] raw in the center of camp. Surmising that Mallus had likely spread his malady to everyone that shared the barracks, Devlin barred his villa door. The next morning, [[Marpenoth 18]], Devlin looked out his window to find that Mallus had fully metamorphosed into a [[slime creature]]â€”his once handsome features replaced with a spongy, green substance. Recognizing that Mallus had lost his humanity, Devlin surmised it would only be a matter of time before he was infected as well.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|8}} before proceeding to burn most of the group's [[magic item]]s at the camp's trashpit.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|9}}

On the night of [[Marpenoth 19]], Devlin snuck into the barracks{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|7}} who at that point only had parts of his skeleton remaining.  After killing Mallus, Devlin proceed to murder everyone else in the barracks while they were in their beds. Examining their bodies, Devlin found bits of olive slime on all, confirming his suspicions. Devlin worked to scrape the [[ooze]] off all but Mallus, then burned the scrapings in a wicker basket before proceeding to burn the bodies of everyone inside the barracks. Before hanging himself the next day, Mallus's name and the names of the rest of the expedition crew would be recorded by Devlin in the last entry of his diary.
