Graven Chandler was a member of the extended Midler-Chandler family in the mid-1480s DR, who lived together in the Midler farmhouse near Eveningstar.
Graven was a middle-aged man with long blond hair, and dressed in a long blue tunic.
Graven was the child of Wilaver and Caryn Chandler, and brother of Jandove. He was the uncle of her two sons Normon and Thoben.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, the drow forces of Vicala Szind attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the Thread of the Weave. Unknown to the drow, the houseservant Maisby had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of Purple Dragons and then a team of adventurers to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.
Graven was kept bound up in the master bedroom with his sister Jandove under the watch of bickering drow looters.
