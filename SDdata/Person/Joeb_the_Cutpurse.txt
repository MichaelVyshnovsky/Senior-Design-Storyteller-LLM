==Description==
Joeb was a halfling man with a light skin tone and brown receiving hair. His appearance and mannerisms made it clear the hin thief was not from [[Rashemen]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the adventurer known as the Knight-Commander, or [[Kalach-Cha]], roused the spirits of [[Rashemen]]. Soon after the Knight-Commander's arrival to Mulsantir, an army of spirits, ''[[telthor]]s'' led by the Bear-God [[Okku]], gathered outside and demanded the life of the Knight-Commander. The adventurer approached [[Tirzah the Old]], the witch-warden of Mulsantir's jail was to help find allies, willing or unwilling, who would stand beside the Knight-Commander against angry spirits. Tirzah insisted that [[hagspawn]] named [[Gannayev-of-Dreams]], another hagspawn [[Mighty Groznek]], and Joeb the Cutpurse were not to be trusted. Joeb had no interest in facing sure death at the paws of angry spirits; he claimed to be just a traveler from Luiren who found himself in a kerfuffle and a misunderstanding in regard to the ownership of some coins in Mulsantir's bazar.
