Onharr decided to stay and defend his Serpentspires. A powerful mezzoloth Yekschanivosk, the Bearer of a Hundred Screaming Skulls, faced off against Onharr the Scalebright, blasting the festhall open in the spell-slinging duel. It was believed that both Onharr and Yekschanivosk perished in the battle, even though there were theories that the mezzoloth was not banished, but instead trapped within a gemstone lost somewhere in the ruins of Serpentspires.\nAdventures\nPool of Radiance Attack on Myth Drannor\nCategoryWizards (3e)\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryInhabitants of Interior Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of Myth Drannor\nCategoryInhabitants of Cormanthor\nCategoryHalf-dragons\nCategoryEnchanters\nCategoryTavern owners\nkbjm55xwodjw5dy9n1spwrnzoa8v9dd"
