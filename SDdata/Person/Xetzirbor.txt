'''Xetzirbor''' was a [[mind flayer]] from the colony of [[Cyrog]], located thousands of miles to the east of [[Gravenhollow]], in the late 1480s [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime in or before the late 1480s DR, the [[elder brain]] of Cyrog, also named [[Cyrog (elder brain)|Cyrog]], died and was later raised as an [[undead]] creature by the [[demon lord]] [[Orcus]].

Xetzirbor went to Gravenhollow to find a means of saving the dying elder brain.
