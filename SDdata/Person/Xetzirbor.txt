Xetzirbor was a mind flayer from the colony of Cyrog, located thousands of miles to the east of Gravenhollow, in the late 1480s DR.
Sometime in or before the late 1480s DR, the elder brain of Cyrog, also named Cyrog, died and was later raised as an undead creature by the demon lord Orcus.
Xetzirbor went to Gravenhollow to find a means of saving the dying elder brain.
