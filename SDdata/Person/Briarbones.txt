Briarbones was an avolakia wizard who lived in the sewers of Waterdeep beneath Seawind Alley in the late 15 century DR. He was over 300 years old.
He studied the phenomenon of the ghostly whispering voices. His lair was guarded by zombies he created.  Briarbones was a tutor to the elven warlock Quessahn Uthraebor and she came to him for advice on stopping the First Flensing in 1480 DR.
Briarbones usually polymorphed into human form when dealing with the inhabitants of Waterdeep. In this form, he appeared as a doddering old man. In his natural form, he looked like a hideous cross between an octopus, worm, and insect.
