'''Briarbones''' was an [[avolakia]] [[wizard]] who lived in the [[Waterdeep/Sewers|sewers]] of [[Waterdeep]] beneath [[Seawind Alley]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was over 300 years old.

==Activities==
He studied the phenomenon of the ghostly whispering voices. His lair was guarded by [[zombie]]s he created.  Briarbones was a tutor to the [[elf|elven]] [[warlock]] [[Quessahn Uthraebor]] and she came to him for advice on stopping the [[First Flensing]] in [[1480 DR]].

==Description==
Briarbones usually polymorphed into [[human]] form when dealing with the inhabitants of Waterdeep. In this form, he appeared as a doddering old man. In his natural form, he looked like a hideous cross between an octopus, worm, and insect.
