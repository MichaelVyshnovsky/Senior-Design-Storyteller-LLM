Tantrus Malderos was a transmuter in Skullport in 1379 DR.
Tantrus and his sister Seviria Malderos lived in a tower inside the lair of the slaver Lanador. They acted as gatekeepers, interrogating all the people that entered the lair, supported by some minotaur guards.
In 1379 DR, Tantrus and Seviria were confronted by an adventuring party supported by the Xanathar whod attacked the lair.Derek Myers. "Eyes on The Ball." Dungeon #206. Renton, WA Wizards of the Coast, September 2012.
