'''Tantrus Malderos''' was a [[transmuter]] in [[Skullport]] in [[1379 DR]].

==Activities==
Tantrus and his sister [[Seviria Malderos]] lived in a tower inside the lair of the slaver [[Lanador]]. They acted as gatekeepers, interrogating all the people that entered the lair, supported by some [[minotaur]] guards.

==History==
In 1379 DR, Tantrus and Seviria were confronted by an adventuring party supported by the [[Xanathar]] who'd attacked the lair.[[Derek Myers]]. "Eyes on The Ball." ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #206. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, September 2012.
