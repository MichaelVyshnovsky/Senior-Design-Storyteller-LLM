        "Description": "{{Quote|''The songs make much of Khalid's meekness. The quiet little Harper who had to keep a tight hold on his courage. But he had it when it counted. And, more than that: He had compassion. When you live a Harper's life, see all that a Harper sees, that is by far the harder thing to hold on to.''|High Harper Jaheira}}<br/>\nKhalid was a kind, if a bit nervous man, and spoke with a noticeable [[stutter]]. While he was not the bravest warrior in the world, he was quite capable of holding his own in most battles.\n\nAt one point in his younger years, Khalid wore a beard.",
        "Relationships": "{{Quote|''He was a Harper. A better one than me, truth be told – any idiot can swing a sword. But to believe in the cause, with the whole of your heart? A much trickier thing. I have never known a warrior who would go so far out of his way to avoid a fight. Which meant the few he chose were usually the right ones.''|High Harper Jaheira}}<br/>\nKhalid did not have a great relationships with his parents. He was particularly disliked by his merchant father, who preferred the half-elf's half-brothers. \n\nHe was married to [[Jaheira]], a fellow Harper whose strong personality was complementary to his own. Despite their very different personalities, they cared deeply for each other.In the same novel, Khalid and [[Jaheira]] have a strained relationship due to Khalid's infidelity.",
        "History": "Khalid was born to a well-to-do Calishite couple who cared little for him. This caused Khalid to throw himself into the martial pursuits in spite of his otherwise placid nature. Some time later, he joined the Harpers and met and fell in love with the [[druid]] Jaheira. The two married in the [[Dalelands]] on a gloomy rainy day, standing atop an upturned cart. Later in life, Jaheira sentimentally remembered this simple ceremony for the groom stammering so much that she wondered if the vows actually counted.\n\nAt some point before their time on the Sword Coast, Khalid's poetry caused Jaheira to implement a humorous ban on such gifts. Khalid, ever resourcefully, hired a certain retired [[Cormyte]] [[War Wizard]] to produce a new type of a nameday present for his wife – a sheet of [[parchment]] with an image from a person's mind transferred onto its surface. This magic was created for espionage, not art. So the resulting image was a slightly uncanny image of a young smiling couple with their mouth open too wide and their joints slightly misplaced. The parchment was signed \"With all my love, and from a safe distance. Khalid.\"\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}} Khalid and Jaheira were traveling the [[Sword Coast]] tasked by the Harpers with investigating the iron crisis that plagued the region. They stayed the [[Friendly Arm Inn]] and were asked by their friend Gorion to watch after their foster child, should any harm come to him.\n\nA short time after the end of the iron crisis, Khalid and Jaheira traveled a short ways away from the city to the region around [[Boareskyr Bridge]]. While they stated this was a \"getaway\" for them as a couple, they were actually investigating the [[Shining Lady]] and the [[Shining Crusade]] that rose up from throughout the Sword Coast. The pair became separated by the crusaders; Khalid was stuck within the minor settlement of [[Bridgefort]] while Jaheira was forced to keep her distance, well beyond the crusade's siege. During this adventure, Khalid gathered the finest [[spidersilk]] from the [[Forest of Wyrms]] and a perfect unblemished [[aquamarine]] to fashion an anniversary [[Khalid's Gift|gift]] for his beloved wife, the necklace she would cherish for over a century after.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = He died alone, in pain, and far too young—murdered by a mage who craved immortality.
