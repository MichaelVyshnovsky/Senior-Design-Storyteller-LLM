'''Shargrailar''' was a [[great wyrm]] [[red dragon]] whose lair was in the mountains near the headwaters of the [[Immerflow]] in the [[Thunder Peaks]].

He was the first successful [[dracolich]] created by [[Sammaster]] in the {{YearlinkName|902}}. Shargrailar went on to become the most powerful dracolich in the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and a loyal ally of Sammaster.

Shargrailar's demise occurred during the hunt for [[Shandril Shessair]]. After Shandril destroyed two dracoliches and an archmage of the Cult, Shargrailar decided to resolve the matter himself and ambushed the girl and her friends. However, her ''[[spellfire]]'' proved too powerful even for Shargrailar and the dracolich was destroyed for good.
