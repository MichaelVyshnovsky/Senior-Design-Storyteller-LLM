He held a mask artifact and wanted Drogans apprentice to kill JNah, who commanded the gnolls in the High Forest. He had some magic powder to use against JNah.\nTymofarrar was also the master of Deekin Scalesinger, a kobold bard, who sought help from Drogan Drogansons apprentice. The pupil had the choice to either kill Tymofarrar or make a deal with him to release Deekin. If the apprentice chose to kill JNah, then they could either kill or threaten Tymofarrar with an item they obtained from JNah."
