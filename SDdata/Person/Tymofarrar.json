He held a mask artifact and wanted [[Drogan Droganson's pupil|Drogan's apprentice]] to kill [[J'Nah]], who commanded the [[gnoll]]s in the [[High Forest]]. He had some magic powder to use against J'Nah.\n\nTymofarrar was also the master of [[Deekin Scalesinger]], a kobold [[bard]], who sought help from Drogan Droganson's apprentice. The pupil had the choice to either kill Tymofarrar or make a deal with him to release Deekin. If the apprentice chose to kill [[J'Nah]], then they could either kill or threaten Tymofarrar with an item they obtained from J'Nah.<ref>"
