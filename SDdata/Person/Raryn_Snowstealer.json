        "Description": "He was almost as broad as he was tall. In {{yearlink|1373}}, he had a goatee and waist-length white hair, wearing most often a polar bear's fur.

        "History": {
            "Year of Rogue Dragons": "In 1373 DR, he and the rest of his companions were caught up in [[Sammaster]]'s plot. During their journey, Raryn came back to his home village, but out of fear his people sold him and his companions to agents of Sammaster. He survived until the end of the mission and decided to come back to his people, hoping to forgive them.\n\nOn [[Hammer 23]], after hunting an [[ooze drake]]{{cite book/The Rage|40|3}} the party learned of a flight of dragons rising to attack Ylraphon.{{cite book/The Rage|45|3}}. By early [[Hammer 24]], the town had been razed, and the band agreed to accompany Kara to Lyrabar in a ship.{{cite book/The Rage|60|3}} Along the way, they spotted signs of another flight of dragons, and began suspecting a full-blown Rage of dragons.{{cite book/The Rage|67|4}} Further evidence mounted as they spotted more destroyed coastal settlements;{{cite book/The Rage|89|6}} during the trip, they were approached by a flight of silver dragons, the first ones Dorn's band had ever seen.{{cite book/The Rage|100|6}} The two dragons, [[Moonwing]] and [[Azhaq]], were looking for Kara, who they explained, was actually a [[song dragon]] named Karasendrieth, whom they intended to take back with them.{{cite book/The Rage|103|6}} Dorn struck at the dragons rather than yield Karasendrieth;{{cite book/The Rage|104|6}} though the ensuing fight led to two casualties amongst the crew, Dorn's team ultimately prevailed.{{cite book/The Rage|110|6}} Kara afterwards explained that a Rage was underway, and the [[gold dragon]] king [[Lareth]] expected it to be one of the worst;{{cite book/The Rage|138|10}} the party, against Graybrook's instincts, chose to aid Kara in finding [[Helder Gorstag]] in [[Lyrabar]] for Brimstone.{{cite book/The Rage|140|10}}\n\nThe whole party met with Brimstone at his lair, learning he was a [[smoke drake]].{{cite book/The Rage|177|12}} After a brief battle with Brimstone, who was possessed by Sammaster's notes while trying to read them, the vampiric wyrm bade them to attack the Cult of the Dragon and find clues; over Dorn's opposition, the party agreed.{{cite book/The Rage|188-189|12}}. On the evening of [[Ches 14]], the party protected Taegan Nightwind, who set himself out as bait for the Cult by pretending to be drowning his sorrows in too much alcohol.{{cite book/The Rage|193-196|13}} They afterwards interrogated one of the cultists that they captured, learning that the cult hid in a dungeon beneath a tannery.{{cite book/The Rage|198|13}} After a fight, they captured the [[Wearer of Purple]] [[Cylla Morieth]] and managed to learn of Sammaster's plans for the Rage.{{cite book/The Rage|206|13}}\n\nTaegan Nightwind agreed to petition Queen Sambryl to send warriors to fight the Cult of the Dragon close to Lyrabar, to which she ultimately agreed.{{cite book/The Rage|236-237|16}} Raryn, and the others instead left for [[Elmwood]], which they found to be under [[Zhentarim]] occupation.{{cite book/The Rage|240|17}} After the fight, they joined [[Thoyanna Jorgadaul]] and other authorities from town in a small grove to which a small bird led them.{{cite book/The Rage|249|17}} There, after learning of the Zhentarim activities through the area, they decided to break their control over the town, blaming dragons for any damage.{{cite book/The Rage|254|17}} During their following raid, Dorn managed to secure a craft.{{cite book/The Rage|278|18}} They took the craft to Thentia, and then to Northkeep, where they were joined by [[Chatulio]].{{cite book/The Rage|307|20}} After a battle against Sammaster's guardians, Dorn pleaded with the ghosts to allow his company to search the ruins. Surprisingly, he was heard out.{{cite book/The Rage|330|22}} After days of searching, they finally located a number of reliefs that showed the origins of the Rage.{{cite book/The Rage|339|22}}\n\nOn Mirtul 19 while searching across [[Damara]], Kara, Dorn, Chatulio and Raryn came across the retinue of Josef Darag, from Springhill, who were retreating from the front after learning of King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s fall. They also learned that there was a village under attack by bandits, to which they went afterwards.{{cite book/The Rite|35|1}}. Dorn's group found the Monastery of the Yellow Rose on Mirtul 25, but it was already besieged by a score dragons. Noticing they were not in a Rage, they judged that Sammaster sent those dragons to cover his tracks, thus marking the location as one of great import.{{cite book/The Rite|64|3}} Though Malazan chased them off, while fleeing from Malazan, Chatulio spotted a corpse; Kara judged it to be that of a priest of Ilmater, and Raryn attempted to track its route from the monastery.{{cite book/The Rite|78|3}}\n\nOn Mirtul 27, dorn Graybrook and Karasendrieth's team managed to make it through the tunnels beneath the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]], slaying the dragons beneath the monastery in the process. Arriving at the monastery, they were able to explain the situation to [[Cantoule]] and request he heal [[Karasendrieth]].{{cite book/The Rite|117|5}} The Monastery of the Yellow Rose changed tactics against the wyrms under Raryn and Dorn's guidance on Kythorn 2, where they retreated into the halls and set up a trap, which killed at least one of Malazan's flight.\n\nKara finally managed to compose a version of the ''[[abate dracorage]]'' spell in 26 Kythorn, after the monks were pushed even further back.{{cite book/The Rite|252|11}} She took Dorn Graybrook and that discovery to the Galenas soon after, on 5 Flamerule.{{cite book/The Rite|257|12}} They found the hidden sanctuary in the [[Galenas]] on 8 Flamerule; though [[Tamarand]] was able to convince [[Lareth]] to listen, Lareth was indifferent to her tale and wanted to kill her, prompting Tamarand to challenge him for the throne of King of Justice.{{cite book/The Rite|270|12}} After Tamarand slew Lareth, he decided a number of fast fliers would be sent to break the siege at the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]].{{cite book/The Rite|278|12}} Tamarand led the flight.{{cite book/The Rite|297|13}} During the siege, Raryn rode Azhaq.{{cite book/The Rite|306|13}}\n\nBy Midsummer, Dorn's party had returned to Thentia, and Rilitar had died, but considerable progress had been made in decoding Sammaster's notes.{{cite book/The Rite|329-333|E}}\n\nOn Eleint 12, Taegan and Jivex had rejoined Dorn's party, and taken to exploring the steppes of ancient [[Narfell]], following Sammaster's explorations. Despite carrying a token of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s favor, they were attacked by a Far Quey raiding party.{{cite book/The Ruin|14|1}} Kara attempted to lure in the Nars for a friendly talk, but they attacked when [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]] attacked them, unbeknownst to her; they broke off after Pavel rescued their captain.{{cite book/The Ruin|32-34|1}} Afrer the conversation with the Nars, they learned of the [[Hermit]], joined by Brimstone.{{cite book/The Ruin|35|1}} After a fight, The Hermit related upon Dorn's party that it had realized, during the first Rage, that the elves had built a citadel in Novularond, but knew little beyond that.{{cite book/The Ruin|57|2}}\n\nWhile returning to Novularond, Raryn rescued his niece Joylin from tirichiks on Marpenoth 14; later, they went to Raryn's home village.{{cite book/The Ruin|70|3}} Unfortunately, his brother poisoned the party and delivered them upon Queen Iyraclea. When the Queen's servants arrived, they slew Wurik for trying to hide his brother Raryn.{{cite book/The Ruin|79|3}} On 27 Marpenoth, Dorn's party, pushed by Iyraclea, arrived at a citadel in Novularond.{{cite book/The Ruin|116-117|6}} Later that night, Zethrindor arrived with Brimstone, and attacked Iyraclea, considering she had broken faith with Sammaster.{{cite book/The Ruin|122-123|6}}\nThrough the ensuing fight, Zethrindor's spell appeared to annihilate Karasendrieth, Raryn, Brimstone and Taegan.{{cite book/The Ruin|135|6}}\n\nKara had triggered the enchantment in the plaza, but Zethrindor's spell sent her off-target, leaving her mired halfway through in some void. She somehow improvised a manner to go the rest of the way.{{cite book/The Ruin|150|6}} In the process, she, Taegan, Raryn, and Brimstone, who had been with her when she triggered the enchantment, materialized in the citadel holding the dracorage mythal.{{cite book/The Ruin|159|7}} On arrival, after they fought a dragonbone golem, Brimstone confirmed they were near the dracorage mythal at last.{{cite book/The Ruin|165|7}} They decided to split up, with Kara, Raryn and Taegan attempting to enter the fortress, and Brimstone heading out to find help.{{cite book/The Ruin|173|7}}\n\nOn Uktar 17, Taegan and Raryn attempted to distract the guardians{{cite book/The Ruin|202-203|9}} to give Kara and Brimstone the time to explore a way to get into the citadel. They failed.{{cite book/The Ruin|250-251|10}}\n\nKara finally lost her battle to Sammaster's rage on 5 Nightal, when she attacked her companions for trying to stop her from suicidally striking at the tarterian wyrms in the valley, believing she'd kill them if she didn't kill herself. Brimstone decided to stop her, kill her, and slake his thirst by drinking her blood.{{cite book/The Ruin|270-273|12}} They were stopped by the sudden arrival of the tarterians, and then by the metallic wyrms that had teleported themselves through Brimstone's hoard in Lyrabar.{{cite book/The Ruin|277-278|12}} After defeating the tarterians, the dragons and mages there managed to break through Sammaster's ward.{{cite book/The Ruin|283|12}}\n\nOn 6 Uktar, Sammaster arrived and called upon pacts with a number of wyrms from other planes to defend the ''dracorage mythal''.{{cite book/The Ruin|289|12}} Raryn joined the fight.\n\nAfter the final battle, Raryn Snowstealer decided to return to his tribe, and help raise his orphaned niece.{{cite book/The Ruin|337|E}}"
