        "mainbody": "'''Alasklerbanbastos''', also known as the '''Great Bone Wyrm''', and the self-proclaimed '''Dragon King of Old Unther''', was an ancient [[blue dragon|blue]] [[dracolich]] who ruled [[Threskel]] from his lair within [[Dragonback Mountain]]. He held the distinction of being the only dracolich to have his physical form destroyed twice in the same year.",
        "Description": "Alasklerbanbastos appeared as a huge skeletal [[wyrm]], larger even than [[Tchazzar]]. Sparks of lightning moved between his bones..",
        "History": "Alasklerbanbastos fought with Tchazzar over the control of western [[Unther]] during the 10{{th}} century [[DR]]. When Tchazzar became divine in the {{YearlinkName|1018}}, Alasklerbanbastos enlisted the aid of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] to become a dracolich. After the dragon cult cell in Unther collapsed in the {{YearlinkName|1024}}, Alasklerbanbastos went to sleep for several centuries, emerging only occasionally to wreak havoc in surrounding lands.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1322}}, he emerged from his lair to inflict a summer-long reign of terror over Chessenta. When Tchazzar was thought to have died during the [[Time of Troubles]], Alasklerbanbastos began rebuilding the Cult of the Dragon in Unther.\n\nThe Great Bone Wyrm claimed dominion over all of Threskel in the {{yearlinkName|1365}}, and bequeathed each of its cities to his [[chromatic dragon]] followers as vassal-states.\n\nWhen Tchazzar returned in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, he slaughtered many of the young chromatic dragons allied with Alasklerbanbastos. The great red wyrm also laid claim over Threskel and fought to restore his dominion over the region. Fortunately, the Great Bone Wyrm's rule was bolstered in the {{YearlinkName|1379}}, when it was supported by the [[church of Bane]] and the nation of [[Thay]], their valuable trade partner across the sea.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Alasklerbanbastos began sending [[humanoid]] troops on raids into [[Chessenta]]. The raids started a short war with Chessenta that Threskel lost. He was defeated in battle against Tchazzar that year and his physical form was destroyed. However, Tchazzar decided not to destroy Alasklerbanbastos's [[phylactery]], which would've annihilated him completely. Shortly after his body was destroyed, his phylactery was taken from its hiding place by [[Aoth Fezim]] and Alasklerbanbastos was resurrected into the body of a young blue dragon by [[Cera Eurthos]].\t\n\nBecause Cera controlled Alasklerbanbastos's phylactery, she was able to command him to follow Aoth and herself to [[Akanûl]] on a mission to convince the Akanûlans not to join forces with Tchazzar to invade [[Tymanther]]. Alasklerbanbastos had to travel in secret to avoid alarming the Akanûlans so he lagged behind Aoth and Cera. While he was alone, he was able to create an [[undead]] [[construct]] from his skin.\t\n\nWhen Aoth and his party attacked the [[gray dragon]] [[Vairshekellabex]], Alasklerbanbastos and his construct attacked Cera. In order to distract Alasklerbanbastos, she threw his phylactery over a cliff. He eventually found the phylactery and returned to his lair in Threskel where he transferred his soul into the bones of an ancient blue dragon.\t\n\nAlthough Alasklerbanbastos hated Tchazzar, he was willing to temporarily ally with the ancient [[red dragon]] in order to extract revenge on Aoth and Cera. He warned Tchazzar of Aoth's attempts to prevent war with Tymanther which threw Tchazzar into a rage.  Alasklerbanbastos fought alongside Tchazzar during the [[Battle of Luthcheq]] but his physical form was destroyed by the concerted efforts of Aoth, Cera, and the rest of the clergy of [[Amaunator]] in [[Luthcheq]], and several other priests of different sects whom Cera had saved."
