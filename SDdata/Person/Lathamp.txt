Lord '''Lathamp''' was a noble based in the village of [[Elupar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the late 12{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1184}}, a thief stole ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', holy [[Mielikkian]] [[spellbook]] from the [[ranger]] [[Rhighaermon O'Antlers]] and sold it to Lord Lathamp. In response, Rhighaermon assembled some half-dozen other followers of Mielikki and mounted a daring raid to steal it back from Lathamp's palace. The rangers dueled the Eluphan guards along the battlements and in the galleries as they successfully reclaimed the tome from the palace vault.
