'''Incubolos''' was a [[homunculus]] crafted and owned by the [[Red Wizard]] known as [[Hazlik]].

==Description==
Incubolos was sculpted with an over sized head resembling a [[cow]], but with a single solid black eye and a mouth filled with needle-like teeth. Atop its head was a pair of horns, resembling those of a [[gazelle]]. On the back of its neck was a knot of short, squirming tentacles.

Its body was long and [[snake]]-like with slender arms. Its hands were eight-fingered, bony claws with many joints. Jutting from its back was a single, slimy membranous wing.
