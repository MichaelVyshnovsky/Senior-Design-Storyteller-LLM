Incubolos was a homunculus crafted and owned by the Red Wizard known as Hazlik.
Incubolos was sculpted with an over sized head resembling a cow, but with a single solid black eye and a mouth filled with needle-like teeth. Atop its head was a pair of horns, resembling those of a gazelle. On the back of its neck was a knot of short, squirming tentacles.
Its body was long and snake-like with slender arms. Its hands were eight-fingered, bony claws with many joints. Jutting from its back was a single, slimy membranous wing.
