'''Fyrfar Smokebeard''' was a [[dwarf]] and a Master Smith of the dwarves who would found the kingdom of [[Roldilar]] in [[the Vast]] in [[north Faer没n]] in the 7th century [[DR]].

In the early 7th century, Fyrfar forged over a thousand weapons from [[orcslayer]] metal over several years at the order of [[Deep King]] [[Tuir Stonebeard]]. Among these was the [[short sword]] ''[[Sarghathuld]]'' in [[605 DR|the Year of the Many Serpents, 605 DR]]. The weapons were enchanted by [[High Old One]] [[Turbaern]], the [[human]] mage [[Beldossan|Beldossan the Short]] and the [[elf|elven]] sorceress [[Aleratha Ilnatar]].{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|90}}
