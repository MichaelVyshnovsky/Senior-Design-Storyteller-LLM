Fyrfar Smokebeard was a dwarf and a Master Smith of the dwarves who would found the kingdom of Roldilar in the Vast in north Faerûn in the 7th century DR.
In the early 7th century, Fyrfar forged over a thousand weapons from orcslayer metal over several years at the order of Deep King Tuir Stonebeard. Among these was the short sword Sarghathuld in the Year of the Many Serpents, 605 DR. The weapons were enchanted by High Old One Turbaern, the human mage Beldossan the Short and the elven sorceress Aleratha Ilnatar.
