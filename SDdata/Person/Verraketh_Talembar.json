        "mainbody": "'''Verraketh Talembar''', later known as the '''Shadowking''', was a monarch of the [[Talfir]] people, ruling from the city of [[Ebenfar]]. He was a master of [[shadow magic]].<ref group=\"note\">Originally named simply Verraketh in ''Crypt of the Shadowking'', this was changed to Verraketh Talembar in ''Curse of the Shadowmage'', with the retcon of being Talek's father. Later sourcebooks misspell this \"Talember\" (with a second 'e'), but the earlier spelling is adopted here for consistency.",
        "History": "According to ''[[The Book of the Shadows]]'', although Verraketh was skilled in [[magic]], he was slowly corrupted by his dark magic and his appearance turned monstrous. In time, Verraketh became known as the Shadowking. He ruled for a long time and claimed many lands as part of his domain. He later created the [[Nightstone (gem)|Nightstone]] using his own essence. However, he was tricked—the bard [[Talek Talembar]] (his own son) had put an enchantment on the Nightstone, so that it could only obey him. They fought for seven days, until Talembar won. Talembar trapped the Shadowking within a crypt, then buried it in a great cairn the size of a hill.<ref> The city of [[Iriaebor]] would later be built atop this cairn.\n\nFinally, in the {{YearlinkName|1363}},<ref > due to an error in the structure of the crypt, the Shadowking managed to get hold of a thief named [[Snake (thief)|Snake]].<ref> Snake did as his master told him, and tricked [[Cutter (person)|Ravendas]], a [[Zhentarim]] lord, into being her steward, feigning loyalty towards her. As \"Lord Cutter\", Ravendas took hold of Iriaebor and started digging into the tor hoping to find the Nightstone, so that she could amass power.<ref><ref>\n\nIn an effort to stop Lord Cutter, [[Caledan Caldorien]] reformed the [[Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon]], but they were betrayed and Ravendas captured some of its members and took them to the crypt of the Shadowking, which she had just discovered and was where the Nightstone resided. When Ravendas took up the Nightstone, she was killed by its magic, as she did not possess the power of shadow magic.<ref> She was transformed, and the Shadowking burst out from her corpse. Meanwhile, Morhion cut loose the bonds of the Fellowship, as that was his plan all along. As Morhion did this, [[Mari Al'maren]] threw her pipes to Caledan Caldorien, but Snake shot a bolt of magical energy to her, knocking her into unconsciousness. [[Kellen Caldorien|Kellen]] managed to kill Snake with a poisoned needle. With the pipes, Caledan played the shadow song, which was inscribed in [[Talfiric]] on the columns of the crypt, and the song tore the Nightstone asunder. In doing so, Caledan defeated the Shadowking. Afterward, the crypt collapsed, [[Ferret Talondim|Ferret]] sacrificed himself so that the rest of the members of the Fellowship could escape.<ref>",
        "Works": "The Shadowking was credited with creating the spell known as ''[[Verraketh's shadow crown]]''."
