Imphras Heltharn II was a king of Impiltur.
Imphras was the only heir of Queen Ilmara, and he was crowned as king at birth in 1169 DR. His father, Rilaun of Sarshel, was angered by this and tried to seize the throne instead, but he was defeated. Ilmara then ruled as regent until Imphras sixteenth birthday in 1185 DR.
Imphras married one Lasheela of Dilpur, and she bore him two sons, Talryn and Lashilmbrar. She died in 1204 DR, and Imphras immediately married his mistress Rebaera Osterhown. They had four more sons, Kuskar, Velimbrar, Elphras, and Fylraun.
In 1196 DR, Imphras founded the Most Holy Order of the Sacred Shrike after claiming to have seen a little shrike attack and kill a small demon while on a hunt. This order of knights followed the traditions of the older Order of the Triad and served the throne of Impiltur.
During the later part of his reign, shortly after he had taken Rebaera as his second wife, Imphras suffered from mental illness. (The first signs of it occurred in 1204 DR.) His oldest son, Talryn, tried to take power, claiming his father was unfit for rule, but he was exiled for this. Imphras second son, Lashilmbrar, effectively controlled Impiltur during this time, until his father died in 1225 DR.
King Imphras II died in the year 1225 DR.
