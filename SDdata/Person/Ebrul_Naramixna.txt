Ebrul Naramixna was the Lord Apprehender of Deep Imaskar in the late 14 century DR.While Ebrul Naramixna is only named as the Lord Apprehender in 1372 DR, the conversation between Ususi and Iahn Qoyllor in 1374 contains some indications that the same person has been active throughout that time. Ususi seems to judge the message as befitting the personality of the Lord Apprehender, implying that she is familiar with the Lord Apprehender of 1363 DR, and that the person has not changed. Iahn Qoyllor makes no reference to any changes in the position, and refers to the Lord Apprehender as simply Lord Apprehender, strongly implying that there have not been changes since. Thus, this article makes the assumption that Ebrul Naramixna is the Lord Apprehender from at least 1363 DR to 1374 DR.
