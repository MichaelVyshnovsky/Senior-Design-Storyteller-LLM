Blade was a wood elf fighter and assassin who ultimately abandoned his party of evildoers.
Long, brown hair framed Blades stern face, which was adorned with green eyes, full lips, and a prominent nose.
Blade was not a gentle man, but he also found the company of evil tiresome.
His extensive equipment included thieves tools, a dagger made from rib bone and obsidian, caltrops, a pair of bracers of defense, a ring of protection, as well as a cloak of protection.
Blade started out as a fighter, but was taught the art of assassination by his brother, who was an expert poisoner. Blade followed in his brothers footsteps for a while, working as an assassin, but eventually grew tired of his evil compatriots and abandoned them.
