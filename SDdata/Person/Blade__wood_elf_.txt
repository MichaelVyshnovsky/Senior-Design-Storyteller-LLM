'''Blade''' was a [[wood elf]] [[fighter]] and [[assassin]] who ultimately abandoned his party of evildoers.

==Description==
Long, brown hair framed Blade's stern face, which was adorned with green eyes, full lips, and a prominent nose.

==Personality==
Blade was not a gentle man, but he also found the company of evil tiresome.

==Possessions==
His extensive equipment included [[thieves' tools]], a [[dagger]] made from rib bone and [[obsidian]], [[caltrop]]s, a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]]'', as well as a ''[[cloak of protection]]''.

==History==
Blade started out as a fighter, but was taught the art of assassination by his brother, who was an expert [[poison]]er. Blade followed in his brother's footsteps for a while, working as an assassin, but eventually grew tired of his evil compatriots and abandoned them.
