'''Tenthar Taerhamoos''' was an [[archmage]] in the mid–-8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a tall man, and wore a black [[cloak]], with rich [[robes]] underneath and a [[gem]]-studded medallion.

==Relationships==
He had a years-long enmity with the mage [[Umbregard]].{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|744-746|20}} He was served by many [[golem]]s.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|750-751|20}}

==Abilities==
He could cast ''[[chain lightning]]'', and a spell akin to ''[[teleport]]'', as well as some spell that granted him the ability to phase through materials.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|714-715|18}} Another of his spells allowed him to hurl a deadly sphere of purple flames.

==Possessions==
He had an [[enchanted]] ''medallion'' he could use to steady and augment his spells. He was the master of [[Phoenix Tower]]. He was also carrying a ''[[wand]]'' of some sort.

==History==
At the start of the Chaos of [[the Art]] in spring of the {{yearlinkName|767}}, Tenthar Taerhamoos barricaded himself in Phoenix Tower, and had his golems dig trenches right until they decayed into nothing.

About two [[tenday]]s later, Tenthar Taerhamoos sought out the counsel of [[Kadeln Parosper]] in the [[House of the Ladystar]], which had its gates closed, as a mob had formed just outside. Unable to cross the gates with his spells, he learned only that the priests of [[Mystra]] knew no more than he did about the Art, and was attacked by the mob; he retaliated with ''chain lightning'' before teleporting away. Back at his home, he teleported to the forest near [[Starmantle]] after learning someone had used a portal near [[Tangletrees]] to go there, suspecting the [[elves]] were on the move. He brought with himself a wedge of [[cheese]].

At the woods near Starmantle, in what was then [[the Dead Place]], he ambushed a number of [[Shar]]ran [[Dreadspell]]s who were distracted fighting the elven [[wizard]] [[Starsunder]], and Tenthar's rival of many years, Umbregard of Galadorna. His deadly spell appeared to cause some feedback, causing the death of Dread Sister [[Avroana]] all the way back in the [[House of Holy Night]]. They later shared a drink with Elminster Aumar, a [[Chosen of Mystra]], who came to heal them on [[Mystra]]'s behalf.
