Alham Pasha Burak was the Hetmann of Bralizzar as of the mid-14 century DR.
The ancient and venerable head man of the caravanserai carried a jeweled dagger, though it was just for show.
He is formal and reserved towards outsiders, though he was warm and caring towards his own people. He was absolutely fair and honorable in his dealings, though he heeded no excuses nor pleas of extenuating circumstances. 
Alham was a less-than-adept fighter. He also presumably had multiple means of execution open to him, including death by fireball, death by lightning, death by flame strike, and death by polymorphing, suggesting that he employed several wizards and perhaps priests.
Alham Pasha Buraks dagger was valued at 250 gp.
As the Hetmann, his word was law in the caravanserai. The Durpari Airlancers and Lancers carried out his orders. He was aware of multiple rumors which he could not investigate fully.
Hetmann Alham Pasha Burak was friends with the wizard Aman Al-Raqib.
