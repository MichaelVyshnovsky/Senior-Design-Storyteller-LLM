Glyrgoth was a white dracolich that laired in an abandoned mine somewhere in the Savage Frontier during the late 15 century DR.
Among the riches in Glyrgoths hoard was a beautiful porcelain figurine of a boar.
Glyrgoth amassed a hoard of riches, thanks to the efforts of the Pale Claw bandit gang. The bandits took control over the town of Womford for a time,The name of the town is not mentioned in the story however, it was confirmed as Womford by author Jeremy Lambert [https//www.instagram.com/p/CkOzi0HSKOd in his instagram post]. offering "protection" in exchange for much of the peoples hard-earned coin.
While the mighty dracolich was the true overlord of the Pale Claw bandits, there existed another figurehead of the gang the so-called Bandit King Grunnald. Grunnald tried to act as intermediary between his fellow townspeople in Womford and the gang, but was relegated to a strawman puppet of Glyrgoth.

Sometime in the 1490s DR, the adventurers Simon Aumar, Holga Kilgore, Edgin Darvis, and Thelvyn Kip broke into Glyrgoths lair, and attempted to take back the stolen riches for the people of Womford. The adventurers were partially successful they managed to remove a significant portion of the riches from Glyrgoths lair, but were forced to abandon much of it when the great dracolich confronted them face-fo-face. The thieving adventurers managed to escape with their lives, but Glyrgoth swore revenge on them.
