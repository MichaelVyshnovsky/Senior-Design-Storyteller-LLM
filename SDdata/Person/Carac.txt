==History==
In [[1361 DR]], during the march of the column of survivors of the [[Night of Wailing]], [[Chical]] sent many of his knights, among them Carac, to scout the surrounding land.

Carac went back after seeing [[Don Vaez]]'s expedition arriving in [[Helmsport]] and told of this to his master.
