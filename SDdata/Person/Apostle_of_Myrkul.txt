The Apostle of Myrkul was an avatar of the god Myrkul used in the late 15 century DR.
It was encountered in the , by a party of adventurers in a mind flayer colony located beneath Moonrise Towers. It was spawned when Ketheric Thorm, the Chosen of the Lord of Bones, chose to sacrifice himself to his god, who resurrected Thorm as the Apostle. It was subsequently defeated by the True Heroes of Baldurs Gate.
The Apostle was a massive animated humanoid skeleton, lacking legs but instead hovering over the pool of brine from whence it emerged. Its head was a skull draped with long black strips of cloth and framed by a golden triangle. Its shoulders were adorned with two smaller skeletons that dangled censers from their outstretched arms, as well as two projections from which hung black cloth banners resembling wings. It wielded a massive scythe that appeared to be made of bones and jagged teeth.
