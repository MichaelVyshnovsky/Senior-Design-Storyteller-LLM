'''Smiley Gheef''' was a businessman from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''I was this close to landing that deal. Next time for sure!''|Smiley Gheef}}

==Description==
Gheef was a [[human]] man with hazel eyes and tan skin. He worse his facial hair in a thick black beard.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the city of Baldur's Gate shuddered under the [[Absolute crisis]], certain goods started to become rare and expensive. One such material that skyrocketed in price was [[saltpeter]]. Smiley Gheef sought to purchase a shipment of barreled saltpeter from the [[dwarf|dwarvish]] trader [[Djingo]] and participated in a bidding war against [[Kaet Ling]] and [[Pheebs Splayfoot]]. Djingo charged at least 500 [[gold]] [[coin|pieces]] per barrel, a high price as he knew that once Baldur's Gate was besieged, he'd easily sell it for double the amount to the Gate's [[steel watcher]] foundry. Smiley Gheef offered 700 gp per barrel, but the bidding war ended abruptly when Kaet Ling offered to pay 1,000 gp per barrel, in cash, no notes. Despite the loss, Gheef was hopeful for future transactions.
