|I was here with the group I normally adventure with, when we got overwhelmed by a powerful group of monsters. I got cornered while low on magics, and they managed to knock me out. When I woke up, I was as you found me. Chained to this wall, waiting to be eaten.

==Description==
Tristran had pale skin, blond hair, and wore a dark [[robe]].

==History==
Around the time of the [[Darkening]], Tristran and his adventuring companions [[Jarus Brithandir]], [[Kirina Aelorothi]], [[Popkin Shortshanks]], [[Helayna]], and [[Liantor Stoneborn]] discovered an [[Netherese tomb (Stonelands)|ancient Netherese tomb]] at the bottom of a crevasse in the [[Stonelands]]. They fought their way past some none-too-threatening [[undead]] inhabitants, then found a hidden passage leading deeper underground. After passing into the extensive cave system, the group was ambushed by the [[kobold]]s of [[Clan Daeronnax]], who overwhelmed and separated the group. Although Popkin was able to escape to [[Eveningstar]] to get assistance, the rest of the group remained trapped in the caves.

Tristran eventually got knocked unconscious by the kobolds after his magical abilities ran dry, and was delivered as a prize to the lair of the [[red dragon]] [[Daeronnax]]. The great dragon considered him nothing more than a snack for later, and so kept Tristran chained up next to his piles of treasure until Popkin's allies finally arrived and saved the unfortunate wizard.
