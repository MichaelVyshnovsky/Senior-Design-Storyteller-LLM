'''The Masked One''' was a female [[human]] [[sorceress]] and [[rogue]] adventurer, and an apprentice of [[Alassra Silverhand|the Simbul]] in [[1374 DR]].

By [[1368 DR]], she had retired from adventuring to live in [[Ingdal's Arm]] in [[Aglarond]], where she lived in a house guarded by a tribe of [[sprite]]s. It was rumored that when an individual attempted to remove her hood, The Masked One turned that person into a teapot.
