The Masked One was a female human sorceress and rogue adventurer, and an apprentice of the Simbul in 1374 DR.
By 1368 DR, she had retired from adventuring to live in Ingdals Arm in Aglarond, where she lived in a house guarded by a tribe of sprites. It was rumored that when an individual attempted to remove her hood, The Masked One turned that person into a teapot.
