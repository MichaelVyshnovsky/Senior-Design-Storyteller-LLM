        "mainbody": "Horrengar was a frost giant lieutenant of Shattercrown in the late 15 century DR.\nHe was defiant and dismissive of smaller warriors. He was unswerving faithful and loyal to Shattercrown, and served him by driving the Frosthunger Horde to excavate the ancient fortress of Thrymstone.\nHe wielded a massive axe.\nHorrengar arrived in Dragonscar Gorge with Shattercrown to excavate the ruins of Thrymstone in the late 15 century DR, and over several years, they forced the smaller creatures of the Frosthunger Horde into hard labor to achieve this. Just as they managed to enter the main gates of Thrymstone, their efforts came under attack by both the white dragons of Kovanyrach and adventurers from Waterdeep. As the adventurers invaded the fortress, Horrengar expressed disappointment that such successful enemies were so small. In the ensuing fight, Horrengar remained defiant as the adventurers broke his axe and forced him to surrender."
