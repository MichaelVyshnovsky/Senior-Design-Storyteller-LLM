Parth Melander was a human fighter and a junior cook at the Yawning Portal inn in Waterdeep in the late 14 century DR.
Parth was a junior cook at the Yawning Portal, working alongside senior cook Jarandur Tallstand. He made sure to keep a number of big cauldrons of stew simmering at all times.
Parth seemed like a younger version of Jarandur, but without the scars and combat skills. Nevertheless, he was quick to protect Durnans family if needed.
