His preferred means of attack was to fire a beam of necromantic energy at his foes.\nOrthinos ran the Cathedral of Night in the ruined enclave of Xinlenal, and spent a fair amount of his time in prayer.\nAs of the , he was tasked by Prince Clariburnus Tanthul to oversee the excavation of the enclave, and he managed the logistics of supplies arriving at the worksite from the Shadowfell via a portal in his shrine.\nOrthinos served Clariburnus Tanthul&mdashone of the twelve Princes of Shade&mdashand regularly communed with him.\nWhen Prince Clariburnus recruited the Ashmadai as servants, Orthinos suspected but could not prove that the cultists had their own agenda that did not align with that of the Shadovar.\nIn 1479 DR, Orthinos sent his personal spies to Neverwinter to keep an eye on the Ashmadai without informing his Prince about this decision."
