'''Ashala''' was a female [[lizardfolk]] [[cleric]] of [[Semuanya]] and a member of the [[Sharptooth]] tribe in the [[Vast Swamp]] of [[Cormyr]] in the early 1370s [[DR]]. 

==Relations==
Ashala was the mate of [[Kessessek]].

==History==
In early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Ashala was among a group of Sharptooths captured by [[Shadowscale]]s and held prisoner in the tower of the [[Lost Refuge]] in the Vast Swamp, along with chieftain [[Gathan]], [[Gruss]], [[Kurash]], and [[Sithen]]. The ordeal left them weary and emaciated and Ashala without any [[spell]]s. They were presumably rescued by adventurers in service to [[Mystra]] investigating [[church of Shar|Sharran]] activities there. She was greatly pleased to learn that Kessessek still lived and was declared chieftain of the tribe.

==Abilities==
As a cleric of Semuanya, Ashala commanded the [[Plant domain|Plant]] and [[Water domain]]s. She could rebuke [[plant creature]]s much more often than normal.
