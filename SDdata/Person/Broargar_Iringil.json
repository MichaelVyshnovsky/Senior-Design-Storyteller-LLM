        "mainbody": "Broargar \"Windcloak\" Iringil was a Impilturan wizard and instructor of the Art who lived in the city of Lyrabar during the 14 century DR.\nIringil was the founder as well as one of the head teachers of the Towers of the Wind, a well-known magical academy located within his home city. He was quite proud of the school he had established. Although it was regarded as rather small, compared to some other arcane institutions that were found throughout Faer√ªn, it was considered the finer magical school of Impiltur."
