Thayd was a wizard who led a rebellion against Mulhorand and Unther in .
Thayd was known as the Last Surviving Apprentice of the Imaskari. Per the memories of the Pharaoh Ratep, the wizard had learned much by studying the lore of the Imaskari, which he shared with his followers. He briefly seized the northern provinces of both empires.
In , He ensured that would be so by opening a portal to a savage world dominated by warmongering orcs on the same year, before his capture and execution for inciting fellow wizards to rebellion after his death, no one in Faerun knew of the portal.
Thayds goal was to overthrow both Mulhorand and Unther, and take their territories as part of his own Overempire to achieve limitless dominion over the Realms. In response to his rebellion, Mulhorandi arcane magic was placed under strict control by the god-kings, creating a bureaucracy of priests to keep watch over its developments, thus creating the power structures of Mulhorand that endured well into .
The orcs on the other world of his portals discovered these entryways several years later, and used them for the invasions that would later become the Orcgate Wars. Together, both events orchestrated by the archmage Thayd managed to end the Great Age of the Mulhorandi Empire.
The magocracy of Thay was named after Thayd,
According to the Book of Ratep, the Pharaoh believed that Imaskari lore had corrupted Thayd as it gave him power, and that the wizard would enslave the Mulan once more if left unchecked.
Per some sources, he let in hordes of orcs that would fight the Empires with a curse, rather than a portal.
Some sources suggest that Thayd may have endured beyond his death as an undead sentience attaching itself to the living to control them, destroying his host within the space of a few weeks.Better fix the Candlekeep Forum citations later. It is p80, not 70, though the thread seems to be in the right place.
