        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], Deseyna was chosen among many others to be part of a diplomatic delegation to [[Mirabar]]. However, at [[Beliard]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]], they were ambushed by the [[Cult of the Black Earth]]. Deseyna was captured and transported beyond the [[River Dessarin]]. There, in the [[Sumber Hills]], they were attacked by the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]], which captured Deseyna.\n\nThe air cultists took her to a jail at the Fane until some adventurers infiltrated the temple and freed her."
