Thamalon Uskevren II was Lord High Governor of Sembia during the 15 century DR, serving under the Shade Enclave of returned Netheril. Prior to his ascendance, Thamalon was a merchant prince of Selgaunt, and heir of House Uskevren following the death of his father Thamalon I.
Thamalon, or Tamlin, as he was known within his home, was the eldest son of Thamalon and Shamur Uskevren. He had two siblings, a younger brother Talbot, nicknamed "Tal", and Thazienne, who went by "Tazi". 
Growing up, his closest friend was Escevar, his personal servant. He was somewhat close with Gellie Melveen, a fellow young noble from House Melveen. 
Thamalon was tolerant of Erevis Cale, who posed as his familys butler.
As a young man, Thamalon was fond of falconry, a skill which he had honed with the assistance of the familys retained Master Cletus. He kept a pet gyrfalcon, who he named Honeylass. 
Thamalon was quite handsome, with wavy black hair and eyes of a deep green. He was rather short and slender, like his father
He was quite vapid in his youth, fussing over fashion, revels and other excesses of aristocracy rather than attending to family business.
On Hammer 26, 1372 DR Tamlin took the Uskevren familys young new mage Brom Selwick out hawking, accompanied by Escevar and Tamlins personal guard Vox. As they rode out, the group was ambushed by a number of men-at-arms led by the masked wizard, Marance Talendar. The young men managed to escape the assault and retreated to Stormweather Towers. 
Thamalon was the heir of the Uskevren fortune following the death of his father and the new Hulorn.
Thamalon was the first of Sembias merchant princes who aligned his forces with Thultanthar when the enclave returned to Toril in 1385 DR, fully embracing the Netherese way of life. He became one of their most favored servants. In fact Thamalon was granted the high honor of transformation from his human form to that of a shade.
