'''Thamalon Uskevren II''' was Lord High Governor of [[Sembia]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], serving under the [[Shade Enclave]] of returned [[Netheril]]. Prior to his ascendance, Thamalon was a merchant prince of [[Selgaunt]], and heir of [[House Uskevren]] following the death of his father [[Thamalon Uskevren|Thamalon I]].

==Relationships==
Thamalon, or '''Tamlin''', as he was known within his home, was the eldest son of Thamalon and [[Shamur Uskevren]]. He had two siblings, a younger brother [[Talbot Uskevren|Talbot]], nicknamed "Tal", and [[Thazienne Uskevren|Thazienne]], who went by "Tazi". 

Growing up, his closest friend was [[Escevar]], his personal servant. He was somewhat close with [[Gellie Melveen]], a fellow young noble from [[House Melveen]]. 

Thamalon was tolerant of [[Erevis Cale]], who posed as his family's butler.

==Activities==
As a young man, Thamalon was fond of falconry, a skill which he had honed with the assistance of the family's retained [[Cletus|Master Cletus]]. He kept a pet [[gryfalcon|gyrfalcon]], who he named [[Honeylass]]. 

==Description==
Thamalon was quite handsome, with wavy black hair and eyes of a deep green. He was rather short and slender, like his father

He was quite vapid in his youth, fussing over fashion, revels and other excesses of aristocracy rather than attending to family business.

==History==
On [[Hammer 26]], [[1372 DR]] Tamlin took the Uskevren family's young new mage [[Brom Selwick]] out hawking, accompanied by Escevar and Tamlin's personal guard [[Vox]]. As they rode out, the group was ambushed by a number of men-at-arms led by the masked [[wizard]], [[Marance Talendar]]. The young men managed to escape the assault and retreated to [[Stormweather Towers]]. 

Thamalon was the heir of the [[Uskevren]] fortune following the death of his father and the new [[Hulorn]].

Thamalon was the first of Sembia's merchant princes who aligned his forces with [[Thultanthar]] when the enclave returned to [[Toril]] in [[1385 DR]], fully embracing the [[Netherese]] way of life. He became one of their most favored servants. In fact Thamalon was granted the high honor of transformation from his human form to that of a [[shade]].
