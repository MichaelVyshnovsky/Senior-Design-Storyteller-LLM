'''Chechu al Khish''' was an exiled [[dao]] [[genie]] member of the [[Shadow Thieves]] in [[Westgate]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
Chechu's objective was to overthrow his father's rival and his work for the Shadow Thieves gained him the money he needed to buy magic items needed for his plan. Although more neutral than his fellow dao, he was still generally evil.

==Abilities==
As a not-yet-fully grown member of his race, Chechu could only use his dao abilities four times in a day, and could not cast ''[[limited wish]]''.

==Activities==
Acting as an [[Elemental earth school|earth]] [[elementalist]] [[wizard]], Chechu helped in various construction and rescue efforts

==History==
Chechu lived in the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] as a son of a dao [[ataman]]. One day, a rival displaced his father but Cehechu was offered an alternative, to live as an exile in the [[Prime Material Plane]], and he accepted.

Chechu arrived in [[Calimshan]], but understanding the distrust of the local population for [[elemental]]s, he decided to move to northward disguised as a human wizard. Finally, he settled in Westgate, where the Shadow Thieves found him and offered him work as a spy.
