        "mainbody": "stember Orntalar was a priest of Oghma of the Domes of Reason temple in the city of Procampur in the Vast.\nCirca 1369 DR, Orntalar held the position of High Loremaster Librarian at the Domes, but was engaged in an aggressive power struggle with fellow priests to succeed the missing Patriarch, Cullen Kordamant, and become leader of the Orthodox Church of Oghma. Orntalar was apparently set to win this position.\nAs the Orthodox Church holds that the position of Patriarch cannot be filled because Kordamant still occupies it, it seems more likely that Orntalar seeks a lesser title that still allows full authority over the Orthodoxy."
