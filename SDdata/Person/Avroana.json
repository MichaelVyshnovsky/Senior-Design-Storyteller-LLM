        "History": "In the spring of the {{yearlinkName|767}}, Avroana received a sending from [[Shar]] herself that Dread Brother High [[Narlkond]] was striving for something that would bring them great power and opportunity. He then explained that he had trapped Queen [[Dasumia]], an avatar of [[Mystra]], and could siphon her power freely to cast arcane spells through continued human sacrifice.\n\nUpon hearing of a [[Chosen of Mystra]] somewhere near [[Westgate]], Avroana sent Dread Brother [[Elryn]], a fellow Sharran, and five [[Dreadspells]] with him.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|724-725|20}}\n\nAfter Klalaerla found Elryn fleeing [[Azuth]], who was fully manifested at [[Karsus' Keep]], and herded his team back towards the ruins, their team came under attack by [[Umbregard]] and [[Starsunder]], two meddling mages. During the fight, Dreadspell [[Daluth]] attacked and slew Klalaera. Darklady Avroana's voice came out of the corpse's lips, and she killed him back; the corpse was then struck by a sphere of purple flame cast forth by [[Tenthar Taerhamoos]]. There was a backlash upon Darklady Avroana, who caught fire with the same purple flames; while on fire, she stumbled accidentally into the midst of an ongoing human sacrifice, getting a knife through the sternum from her own faithful."
