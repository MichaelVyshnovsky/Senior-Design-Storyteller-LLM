Hojo Todahiro was the exiled former shogun of Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Todahiro was the son of shogun Hojo Kikutake. In 1341 DR, when Todahiro was seventeen, his father died following a fall from his horse. Immediately thereafter, controversy arose over who should succeed as shogun. Because Todahiro was not yet of age, a shikken regent was required. If he were to succeed his father as shogun, then the shikken would rule for only a short while conversely, if Todahiros two-year-old son were to be appointed, then the shikken would be in power for many years. This division soon proved violent, and the Hojo War began in 1342 DR.  
Following his defeat, Todahiro and his supporters were exiled to the island of Kanshu, and the young Hojo Kawakubo became shogun.
Manipulated by his mother Hojo Haru and her father, the shikken Takenaka Okawa, the new shogun was from the beginning merely a puppet to the true rulers of Kozakura. 
Todahiro plotted to reclaim his position, but he was kept under the watch of Lord Betsui Kando, and observed by spies of all factions.
In 1347 DR, Hojo Todahiro convened his fleet at the island of Norinoshima, utilizing the island as a gathering point to regroup and reorganize his allied armies following a series of inconclusive land and sea skirmishes. However, before the combined forces could fully assemble for a decisive campaign, they were taken by surprise when Takenaka Sugawara led a fleet of ships and men against them. The ensuing battle on the island marked the end of the Hojo War, resulting in the defeat of Hojo Todahiros forces.
