}}'''Malyanna''' was a [[noble eladrin]] and a follower of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]. She wished to open a [[portal]] to the [[Far Realm]] in order to unleash god-like [[elder evil]]s upon [[Toril]].{{quote|All the days of all the worlds are done!|Malyanna}}

==Description==
Malyanna had slender limbs and a graceful pose. Her white skin glowed like moonlight and her eyes were black. Her hair was dark blue-black and she had pointed ears.

==Abilities==
* Levitation: Malyanna was able to effortlessly hover in the air, during which her hair whipped as if in a blizzard.
* Cold manipulation: She could generate magical cold—a blast of winter—that could dispel harmful magics and fire of both arcane and natural origins; could summon localized blizzards; and could create shields of ice and use them for magic deflection.

Malyanna could employ ''[[influence of Acamar]]'', or a stronger yet similar spell.{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP||24}}
