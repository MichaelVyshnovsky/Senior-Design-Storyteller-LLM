'''Lhoril''' was a [[wizard]] who inhabited the city of [[Waterdeep]].

==History==
Lhoril perished in a back alley in Waterdeep when one of her apprentices summoned a [[tanar'ri]] beyond their control. Lhoril fought with the demon but perished in the attempt. The alley was later named [[Lhoril's Alley]] in her honor.
