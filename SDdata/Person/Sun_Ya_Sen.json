        "History": "Sun Ya Sen was appointed Chancellor in [[1348 DR]] and from then on she always commanded respect from all the bureaucracy.",
        "Activities": "The Chancellor decided which reports and petitions from the minister and other officials were worthy of attention by the Emperor. The power to decide who met [[Kai Tsao Shou Chin]] made Sun Ya Sen one of the most powerful individuals of the Empire but she was fundamentally a honest woman, despite her blunt manner.\n\nHer main concern was the Emperor's trust in the [[Society of the Kuo-Tan]]. Sun Ya Sen mistrusted the Kuo-Tan and feared that one day they would betray the Son of Heaven and in order to prevent this she would do anything. Sun Ya Sen regularly spied upon the Kuo-Tan."
