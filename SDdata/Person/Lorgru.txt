'''Lorgru''' was an [[orc]] and a prince of the [[Kingdom of Many-Arrows]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, Lorgru was the eldest son and heir of the king of [[Many-Arrows]] and, like all his dynasty, a moderate who favored peace with [[human]]s. However, [[Tiago Baenre]] and [[Ravel Xorlarrin]] abducted him and replaced him with a [[drow]] assassin who killed the king of Many-Arrows.
