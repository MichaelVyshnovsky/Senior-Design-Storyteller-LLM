'''Sssessibil Istahvar''' was a [[Yuan-ti halfblood|half]]-[[fiend]] [[yuan-ti]] [[archmage]] who lived in the [[Lonely Tower]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the 14{{th}} cenury [[DR]]. Despite his home in [[the north]], he was not native to the planet of [[Toril]].

==Activities==
Ssessibil was often away from the tower in his home in an alternative [[Prime Material Plane]], where the dominant species, like himself, was a race of giant cat-like reptilian bipeds.

Ssessibil, while having very few interests in the [[Silver Marches]], protected his dwelling with the help of fearsome [[elemental]] guardians and destructive traps. For him, the Lonely Tower was a secret refuge, a fortress of solitude, where enemies and rivals from his home [[plane]] would never have the opportunity to locate him.

==History==
During one of Ssessibil's absences from the Lonely Tower, its defenses were bested by the [[wizard]] [[Arbane]]. He then proceeded to steal Ssessibil's treasure and declare himself master of the [[magic]]al abode. Arbane was eventually thwarted by an adventuring company that beat him in combat and allowed Ssessibil to return to his Torillian home.
