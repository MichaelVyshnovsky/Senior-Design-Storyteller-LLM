'''Thult Oldstone''', more commonly known for his alias '''Arden Glimrock''', was a mighty [[dwarf|dwarvish]] [[berserker]] mercenary and war leader and crusader against the [[drow]] in the 13{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].{{Cite card/Spellfire: Master the Magic|318|Arden Glimrock}}{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2024-02-03/Arden Glimrock, Malleyahl, and Borin Moradinson}}

==Description==
Thult Oldstone was a tough warrior, highly skilled in the art of war, and healed swiftly.

==History ==
Thult, who operated under a pseudonym, made a name for himself leading outcast mercenary band called The [[Oldstones]], against the drow in the 1200s and 1300s DR across the [[Underdark]] tunnels in [[Sembia]], [[Dragon Reach]], and [[the Vast]]. The band consisted of a number of dwarves exiled from various clans across [[Faer√ªn]], who clawed back into the dwarvish society's good graces, defending the Stout Folk from drow attacks. Thult Oldstone's squad fought the drow with savage determination, using self-made explosives to bury their opponents alive. Thult's career as a war leader was long and fruitful until his disappearance in the {{YearlinkName|1377}}. Following the disappearance and his uncertain fate, The Oldstones' numbers suffered losses, and gradually, fewer and fewer recruits sought to join. The band continued strained activities but was believed to be either dead or disbanded by the end of the {{YearlinkName|1420}}.
