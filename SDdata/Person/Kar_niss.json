        "mainbody": "'''Kar'niss''', known as the '''Light of the Absolute''', was a [[drider]] who became a servant of [[the Absolute]] after being cast aside by his former-goddess [[Lolth]]. For a time he served his new goddess as a guide, helping escort her faithful to and from [[Moonrise Towers]] through the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Bless us again, Majesty, Shine Your light, protect us. Come. Follow and stay close. Do not leave the light. Do ''not'' feed the shadows.|Kar'niss.}}",
        "Description": "[[File:Kar'niss.png|thumb|right|300px|''The Light of the Absolute at her service.'']]\nKar'niss had pale flesh atop his upper torso and head, and purple-brown chitin across his arachnoid body. He had the typical white hair and pointed ears of a [[drow]]. Most unusually, Kar'niss had seven eyes, two that were centered upon his face, and five others that dotted his left brow and cheek. While all of them had black sclera and brown irises, the five offset eyes each blinked asynchronously, which was by all appearances a most unsettling occurrence.\n\nWhile most of the time he spoke in a stilted, yet lyrical manner, he let out a resonant war cry when angered. On some occasions he switched between each voice in rapid succession.",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|If it is her majesty's will, then we shall walk! She will protect us. She - she must.|Kar'niss, to his fellow Absolutists.}}\n\nThe odd drider's psyche was badly damaged. He often spoke to the Absolute when in conversation with others, referring to the entity as \"her Majesty\". He referred to himself as \"us\" or \"we\". Kar'niss was prone to bouts of violent rage against anyone he thought was acting against the Absolute's will.\n\nHis faith in the Absolute was entirely unwavering. He would do anything to carry out \"her\" will, even if he truly knew it would mean his outright destruction.",
        "Abilities": "{{Quote|We have our queen's favour. She speaks to us. Protects us. Graces us with Her blessing.|Kar'niss, referring to himself.}}\n\nKar'niss possessed [[darkvision]] and the ability to freely walk upon webs without hindrance. He was unfortunately, particularly susceptible to sunlight.\n\nHe had the ability to cast upon himself or others the spell ''[[sanctuary]]''.",
        "Possessions": "[[File:Kar'niss closeup.png|thumb|right|''Does whatever a spider can.'']]\nKar'niss carried with him in battle the [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[longsword]] ''[[Cruel Sting]]'' along with the ''[[moonlantern]]'' that \"housed\" the [[pixie]] named [[Dolly Dolly Dolly]]. He was extremely protective of his lantern, believing it to be a gift of the Absolute that blessed him.",
        "Activities": "{{Quote|We bring more to your church every day, my Queen. Your followers are legion.|Kar'niss.}}\n\nHe served as a guide for [[True Soul]]s and other faithful of the Absolute that were granted passage through the Shadow-cursed Lands.",
        "Relationships": "Kar'niss was seen as something of an oddity by the Absolute's other faithful. They hesitated to speak to him and often averted their gazes from his twisted visage."
