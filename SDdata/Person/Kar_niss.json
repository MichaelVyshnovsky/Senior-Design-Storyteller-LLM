        "mainbody": "Karniss, known as the Light of the Absolute, was a drider who became a servant of the Absolute after being cast aside by his former-goddess Lolth. For a time he served his new goddess as a guide, helping escort her faithful to and from Moonrise Towers through the Shadow-cursed Lands in the late 15 century DR.\nthumb|right|300px|The Light of the Absolute at her service.\nKarniss had pale flesh atop his upper torso and head, and purple-brown chitin across his arachnoid body. He had the typical white hair and pointed ears of a drow. Most unusually, Karniss had seven eyes, two that were centered upon his face, and five others that dotted his left brow and cheek. While all of them had black sclera and brown irises, the five offset eyes each blinked asynchronously, which was by all appearances a most unsettling occurrence.\nWhile most of the time he spoke in a stilted, yet lyrical manner, he let out a resonant war cry when angered. On some occasions he switched between each voice in rapid succession.\nThe odd driders psyche was badly damaged. He often spoke to the Absolute when in conversation with others, referring to the entity as \"her Majesty\". He referred to himself as \"us\" or \"we\". Karniss was prone to bouts of violent rage against anyone he thought was acting against the Absolutes will.\nHis faith in the Absolute was entirely unwavering. He would do anything to carry out \"her\" will, even if he truly knew it would mean his outright destruction.\nKarniss possessed darkvision and the ability to freely walk upon webs without hindrance. He was unfortunately, particularly susceptible to sunlight.\nHe had the ability to cast upon himself or others the spell sanctuary.\nthumb|right|Does whatever a spider can.\nKarniss carried with him in battle the enchanted longsword Cruel Sting along with the moonlantern that \"housed\" the pixie named Dolly Dolly Dolly. He was extremely protective of his lantern, believing it to be a gift of the Absolute that blessed him.\nHe served as a guide for True Souls and other faithful of the Absolute that were granted passage through the Shadow-cursed Lands.\nKarniss was seen as something of an oddity by the Absolutes other faithful. They hesitated to speak to him and often averted their gazes from his twisted visage."
