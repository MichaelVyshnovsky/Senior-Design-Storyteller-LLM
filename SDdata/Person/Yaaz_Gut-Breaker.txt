Yaaz Gut-Breaker was an ogre mage living on Jazirat al-Sadaf in the Crowded Sea in 1367 DR. He ruled a mixed tribe of ogres and ogre magi called the Gurum.
Yaaz was powerfully built and had a temper to match his strength. He had fiery red eyes and azure skin.
Yaaz ruled the Gurum with an iron fist. Anyone speaking out against him is met with a brutal death. Most of the ogre magi families secretly plotted against him.
