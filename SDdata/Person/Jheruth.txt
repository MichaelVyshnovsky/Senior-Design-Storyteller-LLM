'''Jheruth''' was a [[githyanki]] child from [[Crèche Y'llek]] on [[Toril]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Gha'an had short red hair and was dressed in leather pants and [[bracers]] of githyanki design.

==History==
Githyanki of what would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the [[Rosymorn Monastery]] of [[Lathander]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Jheruth was hatched in the Crèche and, along with other gith children, attended military and combat training around the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during [[the Absolute]] crisis.
