'''Obelia Toobin''' was a daughter of [[Zanner Toobin]], a [[Gondian]] [[rock gnome]] foundry worker who lived in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Obelia was a woman with a dark skin tone and short hair of fine curls. She had brown eyes.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Zanner Toobin, along with his fellow Gondians, worked at the [[Steel Watch Foundry]] in Baldur's Gate against their will, forced into slave labor by Lord [[Enver Gortash]] and his [[Cultists of Bane]]. One of the two motivations for the slaves' compliance was the fact that the Gondians' family members were abducted and held hostage within the drowned [[Iron Throne headquarters]]. Obelia Toobin, Zanner's daughter, was among the cult's hostages. It was unknown if the hostages were rescued before the conclusion of the [[Absolute crisis]], or if the prison was flooded in retaliation for the foundry workers' uprising.
