Korr of Ilmater was a knight of Ilmater circa 1363 DR.
Korr led a company of fifty fellow knights devoted to Ilmater, called simply the Knights of Ilmater. They came to Daggerfords side and joined its alliance during the Second Dragonspear War. 
Korr was practically manic about his faith. He was brave and reckless to the point of being suicidal.
