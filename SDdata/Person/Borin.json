        "mainbody": "'''Borin''' was a trapper from the town of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]], who ran a modest trapping business and traded with the [[Merchant House]] alongside his brothers in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Like his siblings, Borin had short-cropped brown hair and brown eyes.",
        "Relationships": "Borin had two brothers, [[Golin]], and the youngest among the three, [[Chad (trapper)|Chad]]. The brothers were acquainted with the retired [[half-orc]] [[fighter]] named [[Chester Hearth]], who frequented the [[Golden Goblet Inn]] in Mossbridges. They considered the fighter to be a talented trapper and thought him to be a fine fellow despite being a half-orc. At one point, Borin and his siblings' [[dog]] was denied breeding with Chester Hearth's powerful [[moorhound]].",
        "History": "When the Golden Goblet Inn was opened in the late 14{{th}} century DR, after the war in the Vast, Borin and his brothers became frequent patrons of [[Georgio]]'s fine establishment. The family even celebrated Chad's 20{{th}} birthday at the Goblet."
