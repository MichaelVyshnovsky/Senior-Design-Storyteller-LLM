        "mainbody": "Hitch was an adventurer active in the late 15 century DR.\nQuick-witted and roguishly charming, Hitch had ambitions of amassing a fortune of gold. He was not particularly proud of his mildly nefarious past.\nHe was equally proficient at using his daggers for stabbing and for throwing.\nHitch owned a pair of boots of spider climbing, as well as a ring of true sight, and an immovable rod.\nOriginally from Durpar, Hitch was practically born into a life of miscreancy. He fell in with the Zhentarim for a while, but eventually broke ties and established himself as an adventurer of some note on the Sword Coast."
