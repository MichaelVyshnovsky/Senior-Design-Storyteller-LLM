        "mainbody": "lgath was a man from the city of Archenbridge in Archendale, in the Dalelands. He was the proprietor of Elgaths Provisions.\nElgath was once a member of Archendales Ridesmen until he was seriously injured in the line-of-duty. He retired and used his retirement money to found Elgaths Provisions in the late 1340s DR, and still owned it by 1370 DR.\nHe was a bluff man, with smooth facial hair.\nBy 1370 DR, leaving the day-to-day running of his shop to his staff, Elgath usually sat in a chair there and chatted with his fellow retired Ridesmen. He was still quick to come to assistance, however.\nElgath boasted that, if he did not have it in stock, then he could locate any item a customer desired for sale within a day for no charge. For example, Volothamp Geddarm tested the service by requesting a Thayan web-of-bells dancers costume—by the next meal that day, Elgath had found a Sembian collector willing to part with a spare. He even offered to have a fast rider collect it, but Volo declined.\nThough he was reluctant to speak of it, Elgaths store was plagued by a wizard named Thendarion who was trapped in the form of a boot and other common items. It was unknown how he first came to Elgaths Provisions, but thereafter he lurked amongst the merchandise waiting to be bought and go on adventures. Thendarion always returned to the store, or was returned by annoyed customers, in which case Elgath always gave a full refund, politely but reluctantly. Elgath sought out mages to undo the curse and rid himself of Thendarion, but each effort did nothing but cost him.\nCategoryShopkeepers\nCategoryInhabitants of Elgaths Provisions\nCategoryInhabitants of Archenbridge\nCategoryInhabitants of Archendale\nCategoryInhabitants of the Dalelands\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands\n7ikdo96dvnbsayf11nm33e2pfo3gqt1"
