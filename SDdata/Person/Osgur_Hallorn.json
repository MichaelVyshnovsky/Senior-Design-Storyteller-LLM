        "mainbody": "sgur Hallorn, better known as the Fetcher, was the Guild Kingpin a district in the Upper City of Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR. He kept his office within the citys Undercellar, hidden beyond secret tunnels and the inter-connected cellars of a dozen buildings he owned throughout the Gate.\nHe ran a network of informants comprising orphans and urchins, Fetchers Brats, who hurried across the city in gangs, acting as spies and thieves. The Fetcher considered himself a wholly respected and influential man and valued the fact that he was up to date with Baldurian current events.\nDespite his profession, he was typically a kind man. His ruthless nature only showed itself when it was absolutely necessary.\nThe Fetcher was rather large to the point of obesity. His imposing size, hooked nose, and mustache gave him a appearance not unlike a walrus. He had broad shoulders and a bulging stomach that contributed to his outwardly jovial demeanor. While most of it was hidden beneath scraggly hair, he had a large burn scar that covered part of his scalp. \nAmong the Fetchers possessions a was walking stick that was capable of firing darts at the press of a button.\nHe kept a clowder of a dozen or so cats in his office. They would pounce upon anyone who was brazen enough to display ill-intent within his place of business.\nThe entrance to his lair in the Undercellar was hidden beyond a secret tunnel that rested under the Gates Old Wall. Its exact location was only known to a select few of his agents, the guildmaster Nine-Fingers and, unbeknownst to the Fetcher himself, his fellow Kingpin and contemporary Rilsa Rael.\nHe was on rather familiar terms with Krydle, a member of the adventuring party that once saved Baldurs Gate from a red dragon.\nWhen the Guild faced a dangerous upstart crime lord Stone Lord, secretly allied with the Cult of the Absolute, the new kingpin gradually attacked and took territory. By the time the Absolute crisis of the  was raging in the Gate, Osgur Hallorn was thought to be one of the casualties of the war against Stone Lord. Even though his fate remained unknown, Fetchers Brats, including Lil Fezmor and Happy Hands, were taken under the Guilds wing, safe in the Guildhall, of the Lower City."
