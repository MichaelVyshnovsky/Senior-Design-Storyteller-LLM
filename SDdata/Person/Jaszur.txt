King '''Jaszur''' of [[House Tethyr]] was a king of the [[Lions' Dynasty]] of [[Tethyr]].

==Relationships==
Jaszur and his brother [[Olosar]] were twin sons of King [[Alemander III]], born when their father was only twelve years old!

==Possessions==
Jaszur wore the ''[[King's Crown]]'', a magical crown crafted during the reign of [[Coram III]], and carried the ''[[Lion's Sword]]'', the sword of state. Both items were thought lost for decades after his death.

==Activities==
King Jaszur made great strides towards repairing the rift between [[Waterdeep]] and Tethyr after the [[Kinslayings]] of [[1274 DR]]. He successfully negotiated a trade agreement between the two powers.

==History==
Jaszur was born in 1274 DR. He took the throne upon the death of his father in [[1288 DR]].

In the [[1295 DR|Year of the Ormserpent, 1295 DR]], after completing his trade negotiations with Waterdeep, Jaszur returned home. Two days into his journey, he and his traveling companions were ambushed by a large number of bandits outnumbering them two to one. The king and his entire group were brutally murdered, and their remains were drawn and quartered and mutilated so badly that it was impossible to [[Resurrection (spell)|resurrect]] them. The [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|Waterdeep Guard]] found and captured the bandits the next day near [[Sarcrag]] and had them executed, but the royal treasures of King Jaszur were not found. {{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep}}, Waterdeep investigated further and secretly arrested Lady [[Evelyn Emveolstone]] a few days later. (She was, in fact, arrested by [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]] himself in desiguise.) It was discovered that she had indeed orchestrated King Jaszur's death. The [[Lords of Waterdeep]] then found the regalia of [[Tethyr]], but because of a prophecy by Elminster, they did not return it to Tethyr until the rise of Prince [[Haedrak Rhindaun III|Haedrak III]] many decades later. Lady Emveolstone was beheaded in a secret execution.

Jaszur's twin brother [[Olosar]] took the throne in his place.
