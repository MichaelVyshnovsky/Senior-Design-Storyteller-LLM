'''Jorkens''' was a jealous sailor and a mate aboard the ''[[Lustrous Lass]]'' in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Dizby was a [[human]] male with a clean-shaven head.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Captain [[Harfang]] passed Jorkens with a promotion, giving the quartermaster's position to Old [[Dizby]], a doom-sayer and a fool in Jorkens's eyes. Vindictively, Jorkens slipped out from the ''Lustrous Lass'' while anchored at the [[Crone Island]], where Harfang made a deal with the [[Gloom Crone]], and made a deal of his own. Jorkens smugly praised his smarts, but it was never wise to deal with [[hag]]s. Captain Harfang was granted "enough gold to last the rest of her life," but soon enough, the Captain realized that the bag of gold contained only six real gold [[coin|pieces]] among the dross. As soon as she tossed the false gold aboard, Harfang came down with deadly [[sea plague]] that ended the lives of the entire crew in a bit over a [[tenday]] after the deal was made.

The bodies of the dead, including Jorkens', were left aboard the ''Lustrous Lass'' and quarantined after she drifted into the harbors of [[Baldur's Gate]].
