'''Obaya Uday''' ({{Pronounce|oh|BY|yah|_|oo|DAY|refs=}}) was a [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] [[priest]] of [[Waukeen]] from [[Port Nyanzaru]] who traveled to [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|May the blessings of Waukeen illuminate your path.|Obaya Uday}}

==Activities==
She spent her time at the [[Yawning Portal]], offering to pay premium (and nonnegotiable) prices for [[magic item]]s and [[spellbook]]s recovered from the treacherous [[dungeon]] of [[Undermountain]].

She discouraged inexperienced [[adventurer]]s from delving into Undermountain, but was happy to help them gain the skills they needed to do so.

==Relationships==
Obaya's venture to collect magic items was on behalf of her employer, [[Wakanga O'tamu]], a [[wizard]] and [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant prince]] of Port Nyanzaru who controlled all trade in magic and lore within that city.

She hired a surveyor named [[Azuli Tefnek]] to map the routes into the deeper levels of Undermountain and to retrieve magical relics from within.

==History==
Obaya travelled from her native [[Chult]] to Waterdeep around [[1492 DR]]{{Waterdeep-time}} with the objective of acquiring [[magic]]al treasures for her master, Wakanga O'tamu. To that end, she placed a large amount of [[platinum piece]]s in local banks and found her way to the Yawning Portal, where she booked a room and began to sponsor expeditions into Undermountain. It was her intention to hire bodyguards to protect herself and her acquisitions once she was ready to return to Chult.
