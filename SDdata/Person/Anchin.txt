'''Anchin''' was a [[Tsuyoi-no-kami]] acolyte in [[Nakamaru]] around [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
As a new monk, Anchin was assigned to do all the most menial works no one else wished to perform.

==History==
Anchin and [[Kaian]] were temped by the young maiden [[O-Shino]], acting under the orders of monks [[Kogi]] and [[Bupposo]] of the [[Winter Sect]] temple, as part of a good prank

==Personality==
Anchin was full of doubt about his life and if monastic life was the best for him. He was bored of menial work. Anchin mistakenly saw all this doubts as a sign of weakness.
