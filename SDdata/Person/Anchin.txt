Anchin was a Tsuyoi-no-kami acolyte in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
As a new monk, Anchin was assigned to do all the most menial works no one else wished to perform.
Anchin and Kaian were temped by the young maiden O-Shino, acting under the orders of monks Kogi and Bupposo of the Winter Sect temple, as part of a good prank
Anchin was full of doubt about his life and if monastic life was the best for him. He was bored of menial work. Anchin mistakenly saw all this doubts as a sign of weakness.
