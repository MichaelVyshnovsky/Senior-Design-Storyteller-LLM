Marten Foss  was a dwarf and a retired trainer in Phlan in 1489 DR. Marten was also secretly a member of the Order of the Gauntlet.
Marten idolized Ren o the Blade. He knew well the minds of adventurers, having been one in the past. He did not like having too much attention on himself and had little patience for "soft" people or individuals who did not appreciate a good blade.
In his youth, Marten was an adventurer. He once met the famous Ren o the Blade, who greatly fascinated him.
After he retired, he opened a small practice yard in Phlan, until he stopped when he got too old. In his senior years, he studied all about Ren at Mantors Library.
