'''Aluiries Arborshate''' was a [[half-elven]] member of [[Company Yargo]] that served during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She was the type to gather sufficient information to theorize about a situation rather than engage in reckless conjecture.

==History==
When Company Yargo soared up to the [[Pirates' Skyhold]] [[earthmote]] aboard the ''[[Buccaneer's Tear]]'' in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Aluiries accompanied Captain [[Shil Yargo]] to the [[Pirates' Skyhold#Notable Locations|Market Square]] above the [[Pirate King's Retreat]] hideaway. She worked with an [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|adventurer in the company's employ]] to study the destruction brought down upon the ruined town, eventually attributing it to the acid breath of a [[black dragon]].
