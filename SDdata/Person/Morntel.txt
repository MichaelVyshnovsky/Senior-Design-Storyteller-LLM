'''Morntel''' was a merchant of [[Amn]] and a member of the [[Knights of the Shield]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Morntel was named after his [[Morntel (elder)|father]] in [[Athkatla]] and inherited both his fortune and his membership of the Knights in [[1356 DR]]. He was an able caravan leader and weapons merchant based in [[Crimmor]]. In his continuous travels up and down the [[Sword Coast]], Morntel gathered a lot of useful information for the Knights, was appreciated by both [[Pehllus Tanislove]] and [[Barasta Cleeith]]. Despite being an employee of [[House Zoar]], Morntel acted as the ears and eyes of Lady [[Zharnn Ophal]] in Crimmor but in truth he hoped to influence local politics in order to increase the power of the Knights.

Strangely, in [[1369 DR]], Morntel repeatedly visited the [[Blais House]] in [[Westgate]], a fact noted by his fellow Knight [[Piyrathur]]. The truth was that Morntel's father contacted him and explain to him to had faked his death in 1356 in order to escape from a group of slavers Knights that menace his life. By 1369 Morntel the Elder, now based in [[Sigil]], was ready to have his revenge and the son loyally collaborated to his father's plots.
