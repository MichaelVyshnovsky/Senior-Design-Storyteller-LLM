Aguul was a ogre printer who lived in the city of Procampur in the Vast in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Oddly for an ogre, Aguul served as an apprentice printer to Forgemaster Inkstain, a dwarf, in the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR. He endured the dwarfs complaints and grouching.
Aguul was thickly muscled and quite hairy, with warty arms.
