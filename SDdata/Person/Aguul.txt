'''Aguul''' was a [[ogre]] printer who lived in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Oddly for an ogre, Aguul served as an apprentice printer to Forgemaster [[Inkstain]], a [[dwarf]], in the [[1362 DR|Year of the Helm, 1362 DR]]. He endured the dwarf's complaints and grouching.

==Description==
Aguul was thickly muscled and quite hairy, with warty arms.
