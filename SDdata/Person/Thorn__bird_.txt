{{quote|What do you think? I found them!|Thorn to Rhespen Ash}}

==Personality==
For a raven, the creature was quite snarky.

Thorn was one of the woodland animals that the [[elven]] [[wizard]] and commander Rhespen Ash communed with for information.

==History==
Around {{Yearlink|-25090}}, when Rhespen Ash was trying to find the hidden stronghold of the [[Duskmere]] [[elves]], he called upon a number of woodland birds to help him. Thorn was the bird who found them; he reported their location to Rhespen Ash.
