Borth Jhandelspar was a barbarian who worked as a guide in Triboar in the Savage Frontier.
He was cast out of his tribe as a youth and adopted by a Triboar family. There, he later served as a guide to anyone who came to the town seeking his services. He was well known for an inicent in which he traveled from Yartar to Triboar in a blizzard wearing only a loincloth and boots, carrying a sword and singing loudly, to bring the news whilst Triboar was snowed-in.
When Volothamp Geddarm came to Triboar to write a guidebook on the region, and about Borth, Borth was pleased and thought it would bring in business. Borth advised him to cover a well-burning fire with damp turf in order to keep it alight overnight.
Borth was good-humored, but was prone to go berserk in a fight.
