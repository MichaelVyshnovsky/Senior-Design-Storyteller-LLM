'''Borth Jhandelspar''' was a [[barbarian]] who worked as a guide in [[Triboar]] in the [[Savage Frontier]].

==History==
He was cast out of his tribe as a youth and adopted by a [[Triboar]] family. There, he later served as a guide to anyone who came to the town seeking his services. He was well known for an inicent in which he traveled from [[Yartar]] to Triboar in a blizzard wearing only a [[loincloth]] and boots, carrying a sword and singing loudly, to bring the news whilst Triboar was snowed-in.

When [[Volothamp Geddarm]] came to Triboar to write a guidebook on the region, and about Borth, Borth was pleased and thought it would bring in business. Borth advised him to cover a well-burning fire with damp turf in order to keep it alight overnight.

==Personality==
Borth was good-humored, but was prone to go berserk in a fight.
