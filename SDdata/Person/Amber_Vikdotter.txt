Amber Vikdotter was a mage and notorious fraudster who posed as a ferocious and tyrannical ruler of the Realm of Fire in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).
Upon learning of her ruse, the leader of the Legendary Campaign (which sought to unify the wartorn Utter East through conquest) determined to expose her, and so assaulted her realm in a bloodforge battle.
