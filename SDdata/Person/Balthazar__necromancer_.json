        "mainbody": "'''Balthazar''' was a [[necromancer]] who worked in service to General [[Ketheric Thorm]], the [[chosen]] of [[Myrkul]], during the [[Absolute crisis]] of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He was an overweight man with gray, ashen skin and gold-colored eyes. He had open cuts on his face of three inverted triangles, akin to that found on the [[holy symbol]] of Myrkul.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Balthazar necromancer.jpg|thumb|''Balthazar's warm smile.'']]\nHe was known to utilize the spells ''[[bone chill]]'', ''[[ray of sickness]]'' and ''[[cloudkill]]''. He had the supernatural power to raise once-destroyed undead beings and employed that tactic in combat.",
        "Possessions": "He wore on his brow the ''[[Circle of Bones]]'', which granted him the ability to ''[[animate dead|summon forth undead]]'' once per day.\n\nBalthazar knew the arcane recipe to create ''[[moonlantern]]s'' which allowed for relative safe travel through the [[Shadow-cursed Lands|Shadowlands]].",
        "Relationships": "Balthazar was served by a massive [[flesh golem]], whom he referred to as his brother, named [[Flesh (golem)|Flesh]].",
        "History": "Some time during or before the late 14{{th}} century, Balthazar created a [[soul prison]] within the Gauntlet of Shar, which was used by Ketheric Thorm to imprison [[Aylin|the Nightsong]] for over a century. The imprisonment bound the [[aasimar]] to Ketheric, granting the general immortality.\n\nWith the establishment of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], Balthazar started to experiment on and modify the enchanted tadpoles produced by a [[The Absolute|dominated illithid elder brain]] with other Myrkulyte servants in the [[mind flayer]] colony beneath the [[Moonrise Towers]]. \nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Balthazar was tasked by Ketheric with recovering the Nightsong, because Ketheric had betrayed the goddess Shar, choosing instead to become the Chosen of Myrkul, but still fed on the immortality of the Nightsong."
