'''Vanifer''' was the Prophet of Fire and leader of the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She was extremely manipulative, gathering allies as she needed them and discarding them as soon as they lost their usefulness. Though she put on the airs of a rich noble, she despised those born into wealth.

==Equipment==
She wielded a magical dagger known as ''[[Tinderstrike]]''.

==History==
Vanifer was born in the poorest quarter of [[Calimport]], surviving only by her cunning wits. She learned to dance for coin, slowly working her way up to the bedchambers of the city's nobles and learning [[fire magic]] to distinguish herself from others. She eventually became a [[pasha]]'s concubine, but hated him despite his lavish affections. She robbed him of a small fortune and left, setting his palace ablaze as she fled.

She fled first to [[Zazesspur]], but when the pasha's agents found her she continued to [[Baldur's Gate]]. She opened a school for dancers, and when her talent with fire attracted other sorts of students she turned them into a cult of fire worshipers. She led the cult for several years before she began to receive visions that compelled her to seek out a lost temple beneath the [[Sumber Hills]]. There she found a magical dagger known as ''Tinderstrike'' imbued with the power of the primordial [[Imix]], Prince of Evil Fire. She quickly went from worshiping fire in general to worshiping Imix in particular, establishing a new chapter of her Cult of the Eternal Flame in the area by [[1491 DR]]
