Cymril was a Harper agent who operated out of Neverwinter in the late years of the 15 century DR.
When the Harpers of Neverwinter decided to support the Sons of Alagondars rebellion, as they saw Dagult Neverember as an oppressive opportunist who wanted to use the city to expand his mercantile empire in the Sword Coast North, they sent Cymril to join the rebels and take up the leadership of the group. Under Cymril, the Sons of Alagondars actions were non-violent but annoying in nature by creating minor sabotages, stealing supplies, and embarrassing the Mintarn mercenaries hired by the New Neverwinter organization.
Cymril was also an ally of the "Fisher".
In 1479 DR, mounting reprisals against the Sons of Alagondar, Neverembers actions resulted in the death of Cymril.
Cymrils death was a huge blow against the rebels, as it created a power vacuum within the Sons and the disorganization caused internal conflict, leading to the splitting of the group into two opposing factions the Nashers and the Graycloaks. 
Because of the revelation that Cymril was a double agent working for Neverember, the Harpers experienced a setback in the region as their relationship with the Sons of Alagondar had become strained, and their reputation in Neverwinter was damaged, at least for a time.
Some believed Cymril had faked her death to advance her own agenda, however there was no proof for those rumors, and not even the other Harpers of Neverwinter knew about what secret agenda Cymril may have had. Some believed she was really working for the Thayans, the Shadovar, or Bregan Daerthe to undermine the Harpers of Neverwinter, while others believed she was actually a thrall of the Abolethic Sovereignty.
