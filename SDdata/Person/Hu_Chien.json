        "mainbody": "Hu Chien was a Shou wu jen in Okahira in Kozakura in 1357 DR.\nIn 1357 DR, Hu Chien arrived in Okahira and so impressed the shugo-matadai Kadokawa Shigetada that he became his principal counselor. Under his suggestions, Kadokawa introduced many reforms. Secretly, however, he was under the orders of the Great Emperor Chin of Shou Lung. Hu Chien plotted to take control of the city for himself and afterward seize the nearby Hiro castle. He had gathered a garrison of 800 Shou bushi disguised as sailors, plus his own bodyguard force of 200 bushi and 10 barbarians.\nOnly Hu Chien knew he was following his emperors orders."
