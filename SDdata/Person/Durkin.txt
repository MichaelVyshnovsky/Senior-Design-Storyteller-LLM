'''Durkin''' ({{Pronounce|DER|kin|refs=}}) was a [[dwarf]] in the [[Cormanthor]] area in [[1357 DR]].
  
==History==
Durkin had lived for long years alone inside an [[elven]] tower in the Cormanthor woods in the [[Vale of Lost Voices]], becoming quite insane. He acted as guardian for the Vale for the [[elves]], who in exchange left him alone. He would attack any being he saw that he thought may be evil except elves and dwarves (but he would kill [[duergar]] and [[drow]]). 

==Appearance==
Durkin had a mane of wild, white hair, He wore old iron armor and wielded a battleaxe. He had a bath for the last time around [[1307 DR]].
