Durkin () was a dwarf in the Cormanthor area in 1357 DR.
Durkin had lived for long years alone inside an elven tower in the Cormanthor woods in the Vale of Lost Voices, becoming quite insane. He acted as guardian for the Vale for the elves, who in exchange left him alone. He would attack any being he saw that he thought may be evil except elves and dwarves (but he would kill duergar and drow). 
Durkin had a mane of wild, white hair, He wore old iron armor and wielded a battleaxe. He had a bath for the last time around 1307 DR.
