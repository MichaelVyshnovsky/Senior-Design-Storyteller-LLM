Tien Lung was the name given to a celestial dragon (also called a tien lung) of the 2 millennium before Dale Reckoning.The Grand History of the Realms page 33 says Kujawa died in combat with "the celestial dragon Tien Lung". However, a "tien lung" is a generic type of oriental dragon with a name meaning "celestial dragon" this name may be in error.
In , Tien Lung killed Emperor Kujawa in battle, which led to the collapse of the empire of Anok-Imaskar.Ronin Challenge tells that the Immortal Nung Chiang opposed the empires expansion into Tempat Larang, even triggering the Mount Tengkorak eruption. Furthermore, Nung Chiang manifests as a tien lung in the module, and is mentioned to also appear as a spirit dragon. Page 67 presents a story by Awagi Nukichi retelling the fall of Emperor Tan Chin (there called Joon Tsao Choo) at Kuo Meilan to an unnamed "spirit dragon" and appends a disaster striking Tempat Larang (presumably the volcano in the same book) a few years afterward. However, Grand History later retconned this, inventing the much-earlier Anok-Imaskar, placing the settlement and destruction of Tempat Larang within its time, Kujawas death 170 years later, and Tan Chins empire centuries after that, with Tan Chin defeated by Chih Shih as normal. Thus, in-universe, Awagis story appears to be a mistaken conflation of the falls of both empires and its not clear what it might say about Kujawa and Anok-Imaskar, and who killed Kujawa. While it is possible that Nung Chiang is Tien Lung, no source confirms that Nung Chiang killed any emperor. Page 33 of The Grand History of the Realms also notes that Chan Cheng was the first of the Nine Immortals, suggesting Nung Chiang wasnt an Immortal previously.
