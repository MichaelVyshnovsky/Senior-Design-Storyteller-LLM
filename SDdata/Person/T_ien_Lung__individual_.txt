'''T'ien Lung''' was the name given to a celestial dragon (also called a [[t'ien lung]]) of the 2{{nd}} millennium before [[Dale Reckoning]].<ref group="note">''The Grand History of the Realms'' page 33 says Kujawa died in combat with "the celestial dragon T'ien Lung". However, a "t'ien lung" is a generic type of [[oriental dragon]] with a name meaning "celestial dragon"; this name may be in error.

In {{Yearlink|-1943}}, T'ien Lung killed Emperor [[Kujawa]] in battle, which led to the collapse of the empire of [[Anok-Imaskar]].''[[Ronin Challenge]]'' tells that the Immortal [[Nung Chiang]] opposed the empire's expansion into [[Tempat Larang]], even triggering the [[Mount Tengkorak]] eruption. Furthermore, Nung Chiang manifests as a t'ien lung in the module, and is mentioned to also appear as a spirit dragon. Page 67 presents a story by [[Awagi Nukichi]] retelling the fall of Emperor [[Tan Chin]] (there called [[Joon Tsao Choo]]) at [[Kuo Meilan]] to an unnamed "[[shen lung|spirit dragon]]" and appends a disaster striking Tempat Larang (presumably the volcano in the same book) a few years afterward. However, ''Grand History'' later retconned this, inventing the much-earlier Anok-Imaskar, placing the settlement and destruction of Tempat Larang within its time, Kujawa's death 170 years later, and Tan Chin's empire centuries after that, with Tan Chin defeated by [[Chih Shih]] as normal. Thus, in-universe, Awagi's story appears to be a mistaken conflation of the falls of both empires and it's not clear what it might say about Kujawa and Anok-Imaskar, and who killed Kujawa. While it is possible that Nung Chiang ''is'' T'ien Lung, no source confirms that Nung Chiang killed any emperor. Page 33 of ''The Grand History of the Realms'' also notes that [[Chan Cheng]] was the first of the Nine Immortals, suggesting Nung Chiang wasn't an Immortal previously.
