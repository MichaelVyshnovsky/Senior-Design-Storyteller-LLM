        "mainbody": "Hrusse, usually known as Hrusse of Assuran, was a cleric and member of the Gray Hands in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.\nHrusse was a vengeful, intense, and driven man. He adopted Waterdeep as his new home and showed to the enemies of the city or of the Lords of Waterdeep the same compassion he showed to enemies of Assuran no mercy.\nHrusse hailed from Unther but was exiled from the country by the clergy of Gilgeam for his \"heretical\" worship of Assuran. Eventually, he arrived in Waterdeep, where he settled."
