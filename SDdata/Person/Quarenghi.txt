Quarenghi was a half-elven cleric of the Cult of Ao inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
His house was located along Guild Alley in western Daggerford along the northern perimeter of the drill field. Though he tried his best, Quarenghi was unsuccessful in recruiting more followers for Ao.
