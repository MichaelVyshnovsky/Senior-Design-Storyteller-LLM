        "mainbody": "'''Grandmother Snow''' was the eldest [[bheur hag]] living in [[Shimmersky Valley]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "Along with her fellow bheur hags, Grandmother Snow was able to command the howling winds of Shimmersky Valley, using them to carve snow drifts into battlement-like walls or labyrinthine traps. In combat, she attacked with icy blasts of [[magic]].",
        "History": "Grandmother Snow and her fellow hags resisted the incursion by the [[Frosthunger Horde]] into Shimmersky Valley in the late 15{{th}} century DR. However, they were largely unsuccessful in curbing the stubborn [[goblinoid]]s as they stormed into the Valley from [[Dragonscar Gorge]], fleeing from the depredations of their master, [[Shattercrown]]. The bheur hags became increasingly frustrated by this failure, so much so that they took out their anger on a party of [[adventurer]]s from [[Waterdeep]] who had arrived to beat back the Horde. Grandmother Snow personally used her power over the winds to force the party to follow a trail created by her snow drifts, and lead them into a rocky dead end where she attacked them with a cackle."
