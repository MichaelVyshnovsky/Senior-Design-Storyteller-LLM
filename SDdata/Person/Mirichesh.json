        "History": "Mirichesh was a renowned [[dragon]]-slayer during the [[dragonborn rebellion]].\n\nMirichesh was one of the dragonborn clan leaders who took part in the [[battle of the Crippled Mountain]]. While [[Iskdara]], [[Shurideh]], [[Reshvemi]], and [[Thuchir]] infiltrated the [[Crippled Mountain|Celestial Mountain]] to kill [[Rhodrolytharnestrix]], Mirichesh was one of the clan leaders who led the dragonborn rebels against Rhodrolytharnestrix's dragon army.\n\nMirichesh survived the final battle and was one of the founders of [[Tymanchebar]], and presumably, he was the first patriarch of Clan Ophinshtalajiir."
