        "History": "In [[1482 DR]], Musayed often ran the [[Calim Jewel Emporium]] for his employer, Rael. He attended meetings with Rael, which sometimes involved convincing others to join the Guild. Rilsa would not talk about her employee, though he would serve [[tea]] in her presence. Later that year, Musayed was sentenced to public execution by [[Ulder Ravengard]]. His fate remains unknown."
