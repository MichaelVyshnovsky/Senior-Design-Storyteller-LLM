King Iltharl "the Insufficient" was the 17th Obarskyr monarch, crowned King of Cormyr in the Year of the Hunting Horn, 242 DR.
Iltharl usually dressed in immaculate robes. He also had a ceremonial bronze breastplate and leg guards, with fantastic beasts in relief. He wore the Crown of Faerlthann, the crown given to Faerlthann Obarskyr by Iliphar Nelnueve.
Iltharls father was Boldovar Obarskyr. He was married. His sister was Gantharla Obarskyr.
Iltharl enjoyed the arts, including sculpture, painting and music. He also enjoyed hosting parties and feasts. This led to the feeling that he did not make enough decisions, nor did he let others make them. He was also unable to have a child with his wife.
In 245 DR, just three years into his reign, Iltharl became aware of a plot to replace him by marrying his sister Gantharla to Kallimar Bleth and waiting for them to produce a male heir. This led him to reconsider his position as king, and chose to abdicate to Gantharla, making her the first queen of Cormyr, although this was not an easy thing for him to find the courage to do.
After abdicating, Iltharl joined the elves in Cormanthor where he would be able to pursue his interest in the arts.
