Malachlabra was an archfiend and the daughter of Dispater in the late 14 century DR. She was ambushed by the Simbul in .
Malachlabra was humanoid in form, with comely features and a lush body as black as obsidian. She had fingers ending in talons the length of a mans arm, sleek bat wings ruby red on the outside and black on the inside, and three snake tails, at least one of which ended in a glossy black spade-shape.
Her horned head sat upon her unnaturally long neck. Behind her red, beautiful lips was a forked tongue, while a flame burned at the back of her ale-brown eyes.
She could cast or use a sphere of seeing, which allowed her to scry, but it failed when brought to look at its own environment. She was also capable of some amount of short-range teleportation, and of throwing her consciousness into even the least object to escape her own death. The spade-shape at her tail end was sharp enough to slash while being whipped. 
She had the ability to contact another persons mind, and was confident of her ability to remove other archdevils influence from humans minds. She could also spit fire.
Malachlabra claimed to be the daughter of Dispater. She considered Nergal a brute.
At some point, she had slain a dragon for its lair. In the , she briefly came across Elminster Aumar while he was being tormented by Nergal. Though she volunteered to free the old wizard from Nergals mental influence, she was bested by him.
Soon afterwards the Simbul stormed Avernus trying to rescue Elminster. Nergal had transformed Elminster and hid him in Malachlabras lair, luring the Simbul towards his rival the Simbul quickly ambushed and destroyed Malachlabra, who just barely survived by hiding her sapience in a spark and fleeing. She survived, barely.
