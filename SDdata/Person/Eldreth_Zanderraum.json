        "History": "Once Eldreth was a wizard who became a free-willed flameskull.\n\nIn 1379 DR, the slaver [[Lanador]] hired Eldreth and his men to kidnap ten [[elves]] from [[Waterdeep]]'s streets. Unfortunately, unknown to them, one of them was a member of the [[Agents of the Eye]]. So the [[Xanathar]] supported an adventuring party to enter Lanador's lair. In the central room of the lair were Eldreth and Lanador and in the fighting both were defeated.[[Derek Myers]]. \"Eyes on The Ball.\" ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #206.
