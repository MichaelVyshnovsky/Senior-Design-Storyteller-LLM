        "History": "Parg was a goblin of [[Frostfur]] tribe, who lived under the protection of the [[stone giant]] shaman [[Kranum]]. After the fall of a [[meteor]], Kranum began to act strange (being secretly possessed by [[Tyranthraxus]]). At last, the [[Frostfur]] tribe was destroyed by the possessed Kranum and his new allies, the [[Burning Banner]] [[orc]] tribe led by [[Narle Shieldbiter]].\n\nParg was the last survivor and was taken by Narle as a slave. Eventually, an adventuring party hired to stop [[Vorgansharax]]'s [[Cult of the Dragon|cultists]] freed him.",
        "Personality": "Like his fellows, Parg was crude and mischievous rather than evil. After being enslaved, he become a shadow of his former self. He was interested only in escape from his captivity, not caring for answers or vengeance."
