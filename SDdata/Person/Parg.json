After the fall of a meteor, Kranum began to act strange (being secretly possessed by Tyranthraxus). At last, the Frostfur tribe was destroyed by the possessed Kranum and his new allies, the Burning Banner orc tribe led by Narle Shieldbiter.\nParg was the last survivor and was taken by Narle as a slave. Eventually, an adventuring party hired to stop Vorgansharaxs cultists freed him.\nLike his fellows, Parg was crude and mischievous rather than evil. After being enslaved, he become a shadow of his former self. He was interested only in escape from his captivity, not caring for answers or vengeance."
