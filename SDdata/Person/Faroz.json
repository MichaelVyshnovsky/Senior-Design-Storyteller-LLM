        "mainbody": "'''Faroz''' was a caravan master who lived in the nation of [[Turmish]] during the late 15 {{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He was an experienced leader, and maintained good discipline among his caravaneers.",
        "Relationships": "Faroz had a strong ally in his second-in-command [[Majeed]], and was well-protected a number of [[wizard]]s skilled in battle magic.",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1486}}, Faroz and his caravan came across four travelers, [[chosen]] of four different deities, and offered them a place within his caravan as they traveled across the [[Vilhon Reach]]. They were on a mission from the gods to deliver the ''[[Eye of Gruumsh (relic)|Eye of Gruumsh]]'' to the [[Underchasm]].\n\nThe column was harried by [[orc]] assaults, and made a brief stop in [[Xorhun]], to hire more guards. After passing the [[River Arrabar]] on its way to [[Ormpetarr]], the caravan made camp in the shell of a ruined fortress, sitting atop a hill that overlooked the [[Chondalwood]]. Faroz and his people were besieged again, by [[Yder Tanthul]] and his [[Night Guard]], until their passengers departed into the Chondalwood."
