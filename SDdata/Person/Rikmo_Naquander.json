He concentrated on understanding the workings of the city-states government and considered getting onto the merchant council in future. Rikmo was ambitious but friendly to his friends. He was wise enough to understand that for now Keshna Finlothleer was a better leader for the guild. \nRikmo joined the guild in 1358 DR and was soon appointed as an asset in the dealings between the guild and the merchant council."
