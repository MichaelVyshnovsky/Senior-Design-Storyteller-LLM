        "mainbody": "Arathra \"the Little Spider\" was the 45 Obarskyr monarch of the royal line and a queen of Cormyr. She was one of the grandnieces of Gorauna.This suggests she is the granddaughter of either Berost, Gorann, or Ulbaeram and daughter of Silbran, Raerboth, Belmuth, or Ortolar.\nArathras nickname came from her inherited small, frail build and her venomous disposition. She was softly smiling cruelty personified and intrigues and treachery were her fascination, delight, and entertainment. In the years before ascending the throne, she took a consort and bore him three sons, two of whom, in the fullness of time, wore the crown."
