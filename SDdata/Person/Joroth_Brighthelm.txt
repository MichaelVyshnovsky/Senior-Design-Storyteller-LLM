'''Joroth Brighthelm''' was a [[dwarf]] spy for the [[Lords' Alliance]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1492 DR]].

==History==
In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Joroth was instructed to find [[Falkir's Fist]], a band of four dwarf adventurers that disappeared in [[Undermountain]] in [[1491 DR]] just after thieving the famous [[emerald]] called the [[Eye of the Spider]] from the [[Mirabar]]ran embassy in Waterdeep. So at the [[Yawning Portal]] Joroth hired some adventurers that had previously found [[Kressando Rosznar]] to accomplish the mission.
