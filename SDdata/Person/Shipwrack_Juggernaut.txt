The '''Shipwrack Juggernaut''' was the name given to a unique creature made by [[wild magic]] during [[Halaster's Higharvestide]].

==Description==
It was a massive humanoid form composed of rotting wooden ship parts and old rigging.

==History==
On [[Highharvestide]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, along the [[River Sargauth]] in the [[Underdark]], various shipwrecks assembled into a seemingly unstoppable creature. It swam up the river then went into a ''[[gate]]'' that took it out of [[Undermountain]]'s [[Sargauth Level]].

By [[highsun]], the Shipwrack Juggernaut had appeared in the [[Nelanther Isles]] in the [[Sea of Swords]], then attacked the port of [[Skaug (port)|Skaug]] and terrorized the pirates there. It focused its attention on the [[Sea Reavers]], a pirate crew returning from looting [[Amn|Amnian]] ships that were returning to [[Murann]] after a successful trade mission to [[Zakhara]]. It sank two of their three ships.

By dusk, the Shipwrack Juggernaut had collapsed into wreckage. This was later scavenged by the inhabitants of the port for building materials and for whatever treasure could be found in it.
