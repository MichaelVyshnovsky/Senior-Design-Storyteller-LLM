'''Treylo Grassmantle''' was a [[hin]] tailor for hire from the city of [[Neverwinter]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Treylo became an orphan early in his life. Forced to take care of himself, Treylo was taken in by a temple. The halfling learned to patch the [[cleric]]s' [[robe]]s and in the process discovered his talent. Subsequently, Treylo started offering his seaming services to adventurers and defenders of Neverwinter by the late 15{{th}} century DR.
