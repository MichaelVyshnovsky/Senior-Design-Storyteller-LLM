Wurlitzer was a tavern owner and cook in Skullport.
Wurlitzer hated the halfling Smallfry. He also had bad dealings with Gyudd, who would no longer supply him with beer. Wurlitzer was assisted by the morose Oslo.
Around 1370 DR, the rivalry between Wurlitzer and the halfling Smallfry had become legend in the city. Wurlitzer tried every means at his disposal, including illegal ones, to understand why his opponent enjoyed more success than him. All his work was for naught.
