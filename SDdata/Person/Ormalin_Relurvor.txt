'''Ormalin Relurvor''' was the brother of [[Xavander Relurvor|Xavander the Great]]. He embezzled a large part of the treasury of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During the {{yearlinkName|1319}}, Ormalin and Xavander exiled themselves in the [[Border Kingdoms]], using a volcano Xavander found there to melt the treasure Ormalin embezzled.They minted counterfeit [[Amn]]ian and [[Calishite]] coins with the resulting metals, and defined the basics of the future [[Realm of the Mount]].

Ormalin and Xavander disagreed on the direction their newfound kingdom should take: the former wanted a pompous realm of worldwide importance, while the latter wanted to govern over a secretive nation. During a furious argument among brothers, Ormalin died by falling into a lava rift.
