He is distantly related to the [[Cormaeril]] noble family of [[Cormyr]].",
        "Appearance": "Gareth has  bright blue eyes and wavy white hair, as well as a disfigured right arm, a wound which he received while saving the life of [[Hronrulf Caradoon]].",
        "Background": "After saving the life of Hronrulf, Gareth lost the use of his right hand and was forced to retire from the Knights of Samular. It was at this time that he also fell from the grace of Tyr, began to worship the deity [[Cyric]] and sabotaged all that he previously strived to uphold. It was his actions that allowed [[Dag Zoreth]] of [[Darkhold]] to nearly unite the [[Rings of Samular]] as well as posess the [[Kezefbane]] for the [[Zhentarim]]. \n\nDespite this, Gareth has never admitted to himself that he no longer worshipes the Maimed God, deluding himself that he is one of the deity's faithful. He maintains this rationale with self-delusion and in some cases complete denial."
