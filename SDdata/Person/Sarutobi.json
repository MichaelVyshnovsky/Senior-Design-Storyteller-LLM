        "mainbody": "'''Sarutobi''' was a renowned martial artist from the land of [[Shou Lung]], who lived long before the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''I will crush this giant's skull with my bare hands, and I need no magic to help me do it!''|Sarutobi}}",
        "History": "Sarutobi was already a famed fighter by the time he was challenged to a duel by a [[rock giant]]. To aid the martial artist, a wealthy [[Shou]] merchant commissioned the creation of [[enchanted]] [[bracer]]s, later to be known as ''[[Sarutobi's Stone Breakers]]''. According to the story, Sarutobi passionately declined the gift, claiming that he needed no help in crushing the giant's skull. The martial artist survived the duel only to one day step through a ''[[planar gate]]'' and disappear, leaving a son behind. The merchant gifted the magic gauntlets to Sarutobi's son, who later went on a life-long quest to find his missing father. He never did."
