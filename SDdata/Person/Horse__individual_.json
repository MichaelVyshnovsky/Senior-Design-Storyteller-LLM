He was a very cruel man that earned his name from the particular odor that clung to his body.\nNormally, Horse disguised himself as a yeti and surprising and attacking travelers at night. During the daytime, he used hit-and-run tactics his favorite one was to throw a poisoned spear at a foe, anchoring it to a stone or tree stump in order to dismount his foe. He developed this particularly sticky poison made from passawaw grass that he foraged.\nHorse was cast out of the Quima tribe because of the savage behavior he exhibited. His life was only spared because his fellow tribespeople feared he was under the possession of some malevolent spirit."
