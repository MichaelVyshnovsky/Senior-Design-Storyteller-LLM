        "mainbody": "'''Feljack''' was an [[adventurer]] of [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14th century [[DR]]",
        "History": "With treasure won from adventuring, Feljack built a mansion called [[Feljack's Hall]] in the Tweenwalls area of [[Kurth (town)|Kurth]], sometime around [[1347 DR]].\n\nA sudden fire destroyed it one night, ''circa'' [[1357 DR]]. Feljack was not found and was thought dead. Shortly after, as scavengers picked through the smoking wreckage for valuables, a giant [[skeleton]] armed with a magical black sword emerged from the ashes to slaughter them. A [[wizard]] identified the black sword as a ''[[shadowblade (Zakhara)|shadow blade]]''. The skeleton was presumed to be guarding some treasure, but the few who dared return to the ruins to investigate were often found cut to pieces on the road outside. The ruins of Feljack's Hall were wisely abandoned.\n\nHowever, after [[1367 DR]], on moonlit nights, [[human]] skeletons carrying swords were observed roaming the mound and poking around the rubble of the Hall, their presence and purpose unexplained. Feljack's supposed treasure went undiscovered by [[1370 DR]]."
