Smothertree was a name given to one of the holdfast vines, an unusual kind of vine blight native to Forestfall Fen. It was the largest and most dangerous of the holdfast vines as of the late 15 century DR.
Like its fellow holdfast vines, Smothertree was awoken from its dormancy beneath the swamp by the bloodshed between the Queenstooth kobolds and Muckgrunter trolls during the late 15 century DR. It grew strong and powerful on their freshly spilled blood.
It was eventually slain by a group of adventurers from Waterdeep, at which point its body was reabsorbed into the swamp.
