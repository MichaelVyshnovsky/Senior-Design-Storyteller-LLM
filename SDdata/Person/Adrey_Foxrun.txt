'''Adrey Foxrun''' was a young girl who lived in at [[Fourstaves House]] in [[Yhaunn]] in [[1373 DR]].

==Abilities==
Adrey showed an innate talent for [[magic]] at a young age and was tutored by her mother, elder uncle and grandparents, mastering a few [[cantrip]]s by age 8. Although she enjoyed having magic, she found the rules of [[arcane magic]] too limiting. She wasn't allowed to learn harmful cantrips for her own safety.

==Relationships==
Adrey Foxrun was the child of the [[wizard]] [[Malia Thingoleir]] and the [[sorcerer]] [[Krin Foxrun]], and lived with her mother's family at [[Fourstaves House]]. She loved her uncles [[Roderio Thingoleir|Roderio]] and [[Keph Thingoleir|Keph]], and her grandparents [[Strasus Thingoleir|Strasus]] and [[Dagnalla Irongard|Dagnalla]]. Although she had magical talent and could cast spells, she especially idolised Keph and wanted to become a duelist and fighter like him. She was the only member of the family that he wasn't bitter and envious towards.

==History==
In [[Eleasis]] of [[1373 DR]], she witnessed the aftermath of Keph's accidental maiming of her uncle Roderio.

During his initiation into the [[Temple of Shar (Yhaunn)|temple of Shar]], Keph knowingly sacrificed an illusion of her, which continued to torment his conscience even as he revelled in Shar's service.

Later, she expressed her innocent love and admiration of Keph to him, shortly before he had a nightmare-wracked vision of her following in his footsteps and becoming a Sharran herself. Ultimately, her pure-hearted spirit contributed to his decision to flee the cult and escape from Shar's plans.
