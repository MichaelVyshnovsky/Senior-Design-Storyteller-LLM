Adrey Foxrun was a young girl who lived in at Fourstaves House in Yhaunn in 1373 DR.
Adrey showed an innate talent for magic at a young age and was tutored by her mother, elder uncle and grandparents, mastering a few cantrips by age 8. Although she enjoyed having magic, she found the rules of arcane magic too limiting. She wasnt allowed to learn harmful cantrips for her own safety.
Adrey Foxrun was the child of the wizard Malia Thingoleir and the sorcerer Krin Foxrun, and lived with her mothers family at Fourstaves House. She loved her uncles Roderio and Keph, and her grandparents Strasus and Dagnalla. Although she had magical talent and could cast spells, she especially idolised Keph and wanted to become a duelist and fighter like him. She was the only member of the family that he wasnt bitter and envious towards.
In Eleasis of 1373 DR, she witnessed the aftermath of Kephs accidental maiming of her uncle Roderio.
During his initiation into the temple of Shar, Keph knowingly sacrificed an illusion of her, which continued to torment his conscience even as he revelled in Shars service.
Later, she expressed her innocent love and admiration of Keph to him, shortly before he had a nightmare-wracked vision of her following in his footsteps and becoming a Sharran herself. Ultimately, her pure-hearted spirit contributed to his decision to flee the cult and escape from Shars plans.
