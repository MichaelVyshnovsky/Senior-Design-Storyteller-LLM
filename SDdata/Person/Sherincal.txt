Sherincal was a half-dragon (blue dragon) who hated her human side, and was a powerful member of the Legion of the Chimera.
Sherincal possessed an enchanted greatsword called Winged Blight.
In 1310 DR, Sherincal battled the heroes of Icewind Dale at the gates of the Ice Temple in the western pass. Here, she was slain.
In an attempt to slay the heroes, her remains were later recovered by the Church of Iyachtu Xvim, and she was transformed into an undead creature. The attempt failed, with the heroes triumphant, and the tyrant found himself dead in short order.
