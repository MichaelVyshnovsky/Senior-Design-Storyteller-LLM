'''Sherincal''' was a [[half-dragon]] ([[blue dragon]]) who hated her [[human]] side, and was a powerful member of the [[Legion of the Chimera]].

==Possessions==
Sherincal possessed an enchanted [[greatsword]] called ''[[Winged Blight]]''.

==History==
{{Stub-person}}
In [[1310 DR]], Sherincal battled the heroes of [[Icewind Dale]] at the gates of the [[Ice Temple]] in the western pass. Here, she was slain.

In an attempt to slay the heroes, her remains were later recovered by the [[Church of Iyachtu Xvim]], and she was transformed into an [[undead]] creature. The attempt failed, with the heroes triumphant, and the tyrant found himself dead in short order.
