Elok Jaharwon () was the wereboar pirate captain of the Dragonfang  during the late 15 century DR.
Elok was an impatient and humorless individual.
Believing himself to be a worthy "king" of the pirates of Jahaka Anchorage, Elok sought to consolidate power among the various crews. He wanted to end the agreement they had with Liara Portyr of Fort Beluarian and stop giving up part of their pillaged wealth.
Eloks first mate was a woman by the name of Mad Kalita. Among the rest of the crew was the Calishite druid referred to as the Eye of the Deep.
Elok was first mate of the Dragonfang until he started a mutiny and overthrew his captain.
