'''Xanther Srildar''' was a saturnine [[merchant]] in [[High Dale]].

==History==
Xanther was a merchant of [[Sembia]]n rarities and collectibles in High Dale. When in [[1358 DR]] a secret [[Zhent]] occupation army occupied the dale, Xanther was a member of the [[Council of the High Dale]]. Constable [[Heladar Longspear]] believed him to be obviously a spy. In truth Xanther was a very deeply-cover [[Zhentarim]] spy, tasked by [[Manshoon]] himself to spy upon fellow Zhent.

After told to Manshoon the involvement of [[Elminster]] in ruining the Zhent plot, Xanther left the dale. He went to [[Spellgard]] hoping to help in killing Elminster but instead Xanther was killed.
