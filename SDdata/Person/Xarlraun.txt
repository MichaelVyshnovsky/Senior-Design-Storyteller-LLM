Xarlraun was an ancient beholder of Zhentil Keep.
It was the size of a hut, as tall as three men, an absolute unit of a beholder. Its outer plates were dark and scarred.
The beholder counted itself wise in the ways of men.
It had developed an immunity to a number of poisons, centuries prior.
It conferenced with Fzoul Chembryl, and sometimes participated in Zhentarim meetings.
The beholder possessed an amulet that granted it control over Iliph Thraun.
Fzoul Chembryl answered to it. It also possessed a number of contacts it used to keep itself apprised of current Zhentarim affairs.
The beholder was multiple centuries old. As of late , Xarlraun had once depopulated the roth√© from at least one mountain valley in its youth. 
At a meeting with Fzoul Chembryl late that year, Xarlraun was apprised of all the current schemes to seize Shandril Shessair, and thus spellfire, for the Brotherhood. During the meeting, Xarlraun was fed two men it knew they were poisoned, but ate them anyway, and gave Fzoul Chembryl the means of controlling Iliph Thraun, a lich lord that Manshoon and other beholders to be believed under their control.
Xarlraun was party to at least one other meeting later that year.
