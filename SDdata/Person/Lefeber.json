        "Possessions": "The talented arcanist owned ''[[Lefeber's Enchanter]]'', a [[rod]] of great power that created an everlasting form of the ''[[enchant an item]]'' spell. However, its effect differed so that the item would absorb random or specific [[magic]]. The magical rod had limited charges, and multiple could be used at once in order to enchant the target item with more power.",
        "History": "Lefeber developed five spells during his life. The spells he invented were ''[[minor creation]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1701|NY}}, ''[[major creation]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1702|NY}}, ''[[contingency]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1724|NY}}, and ''[[Lefeber's mark]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|1725|NY}}.\n\nIn {{YearlinkConvert|1741|NY}}, the great Lefeber had a breakthrough and developed the very powerful spell, ''[[Lefeber's weave mythal]]''. This incredibly potent spell created a [[mythal]] that only certain creatures could pass through, so long as they were familiar with the activation key. Lefeber made sure that the mythal that was produced by this spell had multiple activation formulae, and thus other archwizards were able to use his ideas."
