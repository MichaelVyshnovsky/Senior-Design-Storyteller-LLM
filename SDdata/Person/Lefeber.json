However, its effect differed so that the item would absorb random or specific magic. The magical rod had limited charges, and multiple could be used at once in order to enchant the target item with more power.\nLefeber developed five spells during his life. The spells he invented were minor creation in , major creation in , contingency in , and Lefebers mark in .\nIn , the great Lefeber had a breakthrough and developed the very powerful spell, Lefebers weave mythal. This incredibly potent spell created a mythal that only certain creatures could pass through, so long as they were familiar with the activation key. Lefeber made sure that the mythal that was produced by this spell had multiple activation formulae, and thus other archwizards were able to use his ideas."
