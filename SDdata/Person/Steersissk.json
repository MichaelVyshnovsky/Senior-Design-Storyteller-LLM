        "mainbody": "'''Steersissk''' was a male [[lizardfolk]] of the [[Sharptooth]] tribe in the [[Vast Swamp]] of [[Cormyr]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Steersissk was captured by the [[Shadowscales]] and taken to the [[Lost Refuge]]. Steersissk, [[Kruthaak]], and [[Ghaan]] escaped through the [[Dusk Lord's Passage]] but found themselves in the [[Shadow Swamp]] in the [[Plane of Shadow]], and were recaptured. In early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Steersissk was a prisoner at the [[Shadow Citadel]], tied to a post and kept inside a cage. He may have been rescued by adventurers in service to [[Mystra]], and shared what he knew, and would fight against his captors given the chance."
