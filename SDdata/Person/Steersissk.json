        "mainbody": "Steersissk was a male lizardfolk of the Sharptooth tribe in the Vast Swamp of Cormyr in the early 1370s DR.\nSteersissk was captured by the Shadowscales and taken to the Lost Refuge. Steersissk, Kruthaak, and Ghaan escaped through the Dusk Lords Passage but found themselves in the Shadow Swamp in the Plane of Shadow, and were recaptured. In early Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Steersissk was a prisoner at the Shadow Citadel, tied to a post and kept inside a cage. He may have been rescued by adventurers in service to Mystra, and shared what he knew, and would fight against his captors given the chance."
