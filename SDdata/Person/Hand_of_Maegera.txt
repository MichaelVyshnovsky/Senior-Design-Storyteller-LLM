The '''Hand of Maegera''' was an [[elemental]] created by the mad [[fire giant]] [[Gommoth]] to aid the [[cult of Maegera]] that dwelled inside the volcanic caverns of [[Mount Hotenow]].

==Description==
The elemental was crated from some form of white stone combined with what was referred to as the "purest flame". It vaguely resembled a massive [[flamespiker]], a type of elemental found in Mount Hotenow that combined the elements of [[fire]], [[Earth (element)|earth]], and [[air]].

==Relationships==
The Hand of Maegera was created as a gift from Gommoth to the [[red dragon]] [[Karrundax]], to signify the dragon's alliance with the cult of Maegera. In truth the Hand of Maegera remained loyal only to Gommoth, and fed information about the young dragon's activities to its fire giant master.

==History==
Gommoth's elemental construct was destroyed in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, by the [[Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] when they stormed the [[Caverns of Karrundax]] to slay the red dragon.
