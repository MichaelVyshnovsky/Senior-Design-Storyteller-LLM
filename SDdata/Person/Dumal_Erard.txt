First Guardian Dumal Erard was a paladin-priest of Helm, and an adventuring member of the Company of Crazed Venturers who later went on to found the community of Helms Hold during the 14 century DR.
Quite fitting for a paladin of Helm, Dumal was noted for being a strong war-time leader.
For years Dumal and his company ventured around the Sword Coast North, based out of the great metropolis of Waterdeep.
Among his fellow Company of Crazed Venturers were the skilled fighter Loene the repeatedly-slain-and-raised wizard Nain Keenwhistler, the still-deceased warrior Tzarrakyn the elder Filiare, founder of the Inn of the Dripping Dagger, Trunnigan Regallis, one of the few humans allowed to live on Evermeet Tolgar Anuvien, the founder of Goldenfields and two wizards of the Harpers, Savengriff and Malchor Harpell.
At some point in his career, Dumal defeated Iltmul at the Citadel of the Mists and attained the tile of White Master of Dragons. He later defended the title against the monk known as Hlam.
After Dumal settled down from his life as an adventurer, he relocated to the farming community known as Helms Stead and began work on a great monastery dedicated to his patron deity. By , he and his allies managed to officially found the fortified temple of Helms Hold. He defended his title as First Guardian and ruler of the city at least six times over several decades after its founding.
