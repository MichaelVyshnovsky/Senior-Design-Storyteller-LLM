'''Raephel the Berserk''' was a [[dwarf]] member of the [[Society of Stalwart Adventurers]] from [[Suzail]], active in mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Raephel had a self-destructive personality that somehow kept him alive through his many adventures. When among his fellow Stalwarts, the dwarf liked to play coins and, on occasion, tease [[Artus Cimber]].

==History==
In [[1362 DR]],{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} Raephel was present in the Society of Stalwart Adventurers guildhall when Artus Cimber's magical guardian named a young but haughty guild-member [[Ariast]]. The dwarf was surrounded by his fellow dwarven adventurers and passed the time by flicking [[gold]] [[coin]]s onto the dining hall's chandeliers, surrounded by copious dirty plates and [[ale]] mugs. This game sometimes lasted for days.
