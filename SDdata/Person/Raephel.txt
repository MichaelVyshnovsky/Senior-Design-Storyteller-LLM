Raephel the Berserk was a dwarf member of the Society of Stalwart Adventurers from Suzail, active in mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Raephel had a self-destructive personality that somehow kept him alive through his many adventures. When among his fellow Stalwarts, the dwarf liked to play coins and, on occasion, tease Artus Cimber.
In 1362 DR, Raephel was present in the Society of Stalwart Adventurers guildhall when Artus Cimbers magical guardian named a young but haughty guild-member Ariast. The dwarf was surrounded by his fellow dwarven adventurers and passed the time by flicking gold coins onto the dining halls chandeliers, surrounded by copious dirty plates and ale mugs. This game sometimes lasted for days.
