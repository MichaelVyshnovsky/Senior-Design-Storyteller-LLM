        "mainbody": "green dragon,  human\nMornauguth, known as the Moor Dragon, was rumored to have once been a human priestess of Shar who was cursed for her audacious scheming. The adult green dragon resided in the Misty Forests deep ravines.\nDuring the Rage of Dragons in the , Shar had ignored Mornauguth throughout her madness-inducing experiences, so she underwent the process of becoming a dracolich at the hands of the Cult of the Dragon. However, once having undergone the transformation into undeath, Mornauguth found herself again within the favor of the Lady of Loss and once again granted the powers of one of her priestesses.\nAs a child, Morna Auguth was known to be brilliant but willful. She was considered to be rather beautiful.\nShe was known for both her shrewdness and ability to bide her time, as well as her bold recklessness.\nMornauguth retained her abilities as a priestess of Shar after her transformation. She had all the abilities of a green dragon as well, though Mornauguth was less adept at swimming.\nMornauguth was known to lair somewhere in the northeast Misty Forest, in a deeply wooded region of steep ravines. Her lair contained no treasure, as she would donate all her treasure to Dark Embrace temple of Shar in Amn.\nShe maintained a lair in the Rockshaws region of the northeast High Moor beneath Greenleaf Vale in a system of extensive caverns. Mornauguth laired here only when wounded or when she needed to take shelter from bad weather. The lair itself consisted of a sleeping mound made of smooth sand at least six feet deep. Several spring of fresh water flowed through the caverns. A long shaft led to the surface, with Mornauguths sleeping area in the cavern farthest from the shaft. She did not seem to keep any guardians, constructions, or treasure in this lair.\nShe may have buried her treasures beneath the sand in her cavern, and was known to have at least one half of a pair of Sending stones buried in the lair.\nShe was known to hunt wild deer within the Misty Forest, and occasionally preyed on passing caravans and adventurers. Each month or so Morngauguth would fly to Amn to deposit her treasures to Shar and perform dangerous deeds in her name. She would sometimes serve as a steed for the Dark Embraces clergy, aiding them in attacks on powerful targets such as temples of Selune.\nMornauguth did not seem to maintain a territory, and was not known to defend her lair from other dragons. She roamed where she pleased, uncaring if she offended other dragons by crossing into their territories. She was afraid of being caught over open water, which limited her travels.\nHer main concerns involved the Sharran clergy, as well as the activities of rival priesthoods. Her forays into these fields were broken by hunting trips and explorative journeys further afield.\nMornauguth sometimes used Temrojan Kalnar, a retired wine merchant who held the other half of her Sending stones.\nMornauguth was once a human priestess of Shar who rose to prominence in a temple in Amn. She was known to be young, pretty, and highly ambitious, almost recklessly so. Her swift ascension within the temple earned the ire of many enemies, and several of her rivals lured her into the lair of a dragon and forced her into draconic form through the weaving of dark spells. Trapped in dragon form, Mornauguth was attacked by the dragon whose lair she had been tricked into. While she slew that dragon, she was gravely injured in the process.\nMorna Auguth grew up in the southern backlands of Amn as a thief and runaway. She survived off of her agility, wits, and daring, as well as her beauty whenever she was caught. She was captured by Ablaer the Dark Goad, a priest of Shar, who took her as a personal slave, intending to blind her and cut out her tongue once through with her. Morna was put to work in the kitchens of the Dark Embrace, and got her revenge after several years, when she convinced Ablaers superior within the temple that he was planning a coup. Ablaer was captured in turn and tortured, to Mornas triumph and satisfaction. The cruel Coroanim Belvim Natrather became her new master, and Morna gained a reputation as a traitor and informant, the clergy of the Dark Embrace delighting in mistreating her at every opportunity. Morna began seeking a way out of her situation.\nWithin a year, the Coroanim and twenty or so of the Embraces senior priests traveled to a smaller Sharran temple in eastern Amn known as Moondown House, with the goal of making the temple a chapterhouse of the Dark Embrace. The Moondown clergy were outraged at this, and concocted a desperate plan to poison the Coroanim and the most senior priests. Morna was sent by the Coroanim to spy on the Moondowns clergy and learned of their plan, carrying out the poisonings herself in revenge. When all of the Dark Embraces priests lay dead, she presented herself to the priests of Moondown House and said how her actions had been guided by Shar herself.\nAdopted into the ranks of Moondown House, Morna was tasked with turning the former Dark Embrace members into zombies, and charged with carrying out the monasterys drudge jobs of dung shoveling, floor scrubbing, and gardening. Over the seasons, Mornas self control was strong as iron, and she steadily rose through the clergys ranks. After a few years, two of the senior priests died to disease, and a fight with some adventurers resulted in the loss of one of the houses most powerful priestesses. The House erupted into conflict as many ambitious clergy rushed to full the power vacuum. Morna quietly defended herself with her zombies, and when many of the clergy had already fallen, she challenged and killed her remaining rival, becoming Prioress of Moondown House, third overall in rank. Over the following year, Morna survived a dozen murder attempts from furious priestesses who suddenly ranked below her, to the point that it became a wry joke between Morna and the novices how often stones suddenly fell from the temple walls whenever she walked past. Morna slew two conspirators in a battle of spells and was widely and correctly believed to have drowned a third in the cesspool of the monastery. Mornas superiors eventually ordered a cease in hostilities upon pain of death, displeased with the drain on the Houses resources.\nAlmost immediately thereafter, the monastery became embroiled in conflict with the clergy of Sel√ªne who had moved into the area. The temple itself was badly damaged, and upland Amn became a battleground between the rival clergies. Many of Moondowns clergy were forced to flee the House and adopt strategies of striking and retreating, and Morna gained a reputation as a feared warleader. Mornas many successes led her rivals to fear that she would rule Moondown House by the conflicts end. Their plottings to remove her seemed fruitless, until they learned the location of a black dragons lair. A priestess in Mornas band awoke the slumbering Guldarath and hurried back to the Sharran group, informing Morna she had located an old cave she knew from childhood that would serve as a strong base for them, and that it was full of treasure."
