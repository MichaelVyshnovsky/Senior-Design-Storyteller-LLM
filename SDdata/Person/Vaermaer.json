        "mainbody": "'''Vaermaer''' was one of the four bartenders who also worked as bouncers of the [[Copper Coronet]] in the [[Athkatla/River District|River District]] of [[Athkatla]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Vaermaer was a giant muscled and balding man who worked wearing his [[breastplate]], [[greaves]], and armored [[codpiece]]. He wore many earrings. Judging by his posturing and physique, Vaermaer was a seasoned [[fighter]]. His professional surliness veiled Vaermaer's true personality.",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Vaermaer was an established member of the Copper Coronet's staff. He, along with [[Bordovan]], [[Delric]], and [[Othlo]], was supervised by Old [[Sarvo Droostan]], the Coronet's tavernmaster. Vaermaer worked in full armor and was proficient in stopping trouble, fighting off rowdy drunkards, spotting drunk spell-casting, and faked intoxication. Vaermaer and the rest of the mountainous bartenders kept large human fist-sized rocks behind the Copper Coronet's bar stand. These rocks were used as projectiles, tossed around with immaculate precision at drunken troublemakers. Vaermaer's attitude changed to that of a glacier when an obviously rich visitor arrived a the Coronet or one of Athkatla's officials. He did not tolerate patrons harassing the Copper Coronet's female employees."
