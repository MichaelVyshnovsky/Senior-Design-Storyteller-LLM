Gallus was a pech in Blingdenstone.
In 1479 DR, Gallus was the leader of a group of pech miners established in a section of Blingdenstone. He was approached by an adventuring party hired by Kargien Dissengulp, who asked for the help of his people in defeating Ogremochs Bane.
Gallus, like all his people, believed that the deep gnomes style of mining did damage to the earth, which the pechs needed to repair. However, he was willing to make an agreement with Kargien.
