'''Gallus''' was a [[pech]] in [[Blingdenstone]].

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], Gallus was the leader of a group of pech miners established in a section of Blingdenstone. He was approached by an adventuring party hired by [[Kargien Dissengulp]], who asked for the help of his people in defeating [[Ogremoch's Bane]].

==Personality==
Gallus, like all his people, believed that the [[deep gnome]]s' style of mining did damage to the earth, which the pechs needed to repair. However, he was willing to make an agreement with Kargien.
