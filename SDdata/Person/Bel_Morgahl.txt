{{Quote|I'd call you a dog, but at least a dog has loyalty.|Captain Bel Morgahl.}}

==Description==
She was rather tall and burly for a [[dragonborn]].

==Personality==
Captain Morgahl was a corrupt member of the City Guard, and had little patience for festidious guards that followed the letter of the law to each exact detail.

==Possessions==
She wielded a [[longsword]] whenever she engaged in combat.

==History==
At some point during or before the {{YearlinkName|1481}},{{Stormwreck-time}} Captain Morgahl began harassing [[Rubalta]], the head of the Bahamutan temple in [[Neverwinter]]. She then got into something of a confrontation with a fellow guardsman, a [[dwarf]] [[cleric]] of [[Marthammor Duin]].
