Idriane Deslin was a half-elf enchanter and sage living in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 14 century DR.
At more than a hundred years of age, Idriane had a wizened appearance and was understandably quite slow in her speech and actions.
Though a pleasant, caring, and generous woman, Idriane had little tolerance for rudeness and swiftly dismissed such peopleâ€”with her magic if she must. She kept no less than four lesser geas spells prepared for this purpose. When talking, she tended to ramble and had a habit of banging her walking stick on the hardwood floors of her house, loudly and just out of rhythm.
Idriane retained a sharp intellect and was a master of enchantment magic. For her services as a sage, circa 1372 DR, she charged only 5 gp to answer a significant question, but took a couple of days to provide a result.
