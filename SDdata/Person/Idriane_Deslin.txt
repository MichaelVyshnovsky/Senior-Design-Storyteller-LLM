'''Idriane Deslin''' was a [[half-elf]] [[enchanter]] and sage living in the city of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
At more than a hundred years of age, Idriane had a wizened appearance and was understandably quite slow in her speech and actions.

==Personality==
Though a pleasant, caring, and generous woman, Idriane had little tolerance for rudeness and swiftly dismissed such peopleâ€”with her [[magic]] if she must. She kept no less than four ''[[lesser geas]]'' [[spell]]s prepared for this purpose. When talking, she tended to ramble and had a habit of banging her walking stick on the hardwood floors of her house, loudly and just out of rhythm.

==Activities==
Idriane retained a sharp intellect and was a master of [[enchantment]] magic. For her services as a sage, ''circa'' [[1372 DR]], she charged only 5 [[gp]] to answer a significant question, but took a couple of days to provide a result.
