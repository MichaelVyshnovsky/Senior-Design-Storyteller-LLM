Urlryn Khalazza was a drow conjurer and the head of the College of Conjuration and one of the members of the Conclave of Sshamath in the city of Sshamath in the late 14 century DR.
In the , Qarlynd Melarn told the priestess of Eilistraee Miverra that Urlryn had risen through the ranks by poisoning all his rivals. After speaking with Miverra, the Master of Divination Seldszar Elpragh informed Master Urlryn of his discoveries about problems with the faerzress and Urlryn said hed received the same information from a cleric of Vhaeraun from Skullport.
In the , Urlryn agreed with Seldszars proposal to the Conclave to elevate Qarlynd as a new member, as the Master of the Ancient Arcana.
Later he met with Masters Seldszar Elpragh, Masoj Dhuunyl and Qarlynd Melarn and they involved also Masoj in their plan to strip the faerzress from the drow.
Together with Qarlynds apprentices and the Masters Seldszar Elpragh and Masoj Dhuunyl he helped Qarlynd when he engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by Wendonais blood into brown-skinned dark elves. Afterward they all relocated to Rhymanthiin.
