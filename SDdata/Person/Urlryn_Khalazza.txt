'''Urlryn Khalazza''' was a [[drow]] [[conjurer]] and the head of the [[College of Conjuration]] and one of the members of the [[Conclave of Sshamath]] in the city of [[Sshamath]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1377}}, [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] told the priestess of [[Eilistraee]] [[Miverra]] that Urlryn had risen through the ranks by poisoning all his rivals. After speaking with Miverra, the Master of Divination [[Seldszar Elpragh]] informed Master Urlryn of his discoveries about problems with the ''[[faerzress]]'' and Urlryn said he'd received the same information from a cleric of [[Vhaeraun]] from [[Skullport]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1379}}, Urlryn agreed with Seldszar's proposal to the Conclave to elevate Q'arlynd as a new member, as the Master of the Ancient Arcana.

Later he met with Masters [[Seldszar Elpragh]], [[Masoj Dhuunyl]] and [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] and they involved also Masoj in their plan to strip the [[faerzress]] from the [[drow]].

Together with Q'arlynd's apprentices and the Masters [[Seldszar Elpragh]] and [[Masoj Dhuunyl]] he helped Q'arlynd when he engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by [[Wendonai]]'s blood into brown-skinned [[dark elves]]. Afterward they all relocated to [[Rhymanthiin]].
