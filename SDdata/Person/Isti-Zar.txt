'''Isti-Zar''' was a [[banelar]] [[naga]] follower of [[Cyric]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Doing the bidding of his dark god, Isti-Zar offered its aid to the [[Shar]]-worshipers involved in the [[black dragon]] [[Despayr]]'s plot to tear apart the [[Weave]] of [[magic]] in the early 1370s [[DR]]. Despayr distrusted the banelar, and sent it to the [[Shadowscale Warren]] on the [[Plane of Shadow]], there to serve as advisor to [[Kossaandar]], warchief of the [[Shadowscale]]s, a tribe of [[shadowslain]] [[lizardfolk]] that served the dragon.

Eventually, in early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], an adventuring party in service to [[Mystra]] likely discovered the Shadowscale Warren as they journeyed through the [[Shadow Swamp]]. Isti-Zar is presumed to have been defeated and slain in the fighting, if it didn't successfully escape into the waterways.

==Description==
A banelar naga, Isti-Zar was a massive serpentine creature with a humanoid head, covered in thick blue-black scales with small barbel-like tendrils from its chin and a barbed stinger on its tail.

==Personality==
Isti-Zar was a cunning, dispassionate, and hate-filled being. It was quick to capture or slay intruders so it could impress upon the Shadowscales the banelar's might and intellect.

==Activities==
Isti-Zar provided its skills to the Shadowscales and advised Kossaandar on magic-related issues. It did so in good faith, at Cyric's command, at least for the time being.

However, Isti-Zar's main interest was in the process that turned living beings into shadowslain. It divined the secret of the Shadowscales' powers.

==Possessions==
Isti-Zar laired in a water-filled chamber of the Shadowscale Warren, where it stored its possessions. It held a ''[[wand]] of [[magic missile]]'', wore a ''[[ring of protection]] +1'', and had both [[spellbook]]s and a [[holy symbol]] of Cyric for its spellcasting. The banelar hoarded 580 [[gp]] in [[gold]] and [[silver]] coins, three [[pearl]]s each valued at 100 gp, and also had a vial holding 1 ounce (28.35 grams) of ''[[stone salve]]''.
