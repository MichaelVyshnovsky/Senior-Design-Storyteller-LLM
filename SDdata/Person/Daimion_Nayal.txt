==History==
In [[1459 DR]], using his contacts in the Master Mariners' Guild and a [[Masked Lord]], he had managed to ruin [[Red Diamonds Trading Company]]. They were framed for bringing in illegal goods into port, the trial for their leadership was quick, and they were soon after sent to jail, where they died from food poisoning. Daimion then purchased the trading company at a cheap price. In return for the aid given to him by the Masked Lord, he smuggled a couple of chests on a ship bound to [[Amn]],{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|19}}

In [[1479 DR]],<ref group="note" name="Year" /> on the night of [[Fleetswake]], Daimion was to be honored with an award for his accomplishments as both a shipping merchant and member of the Master Mariners' Guild.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|12}}

A group of [[adventurer]]s, hired by both the [[Guild of Watermen]] and the Master Mariners' Guild to investigate the kidnappings,{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|16}}

The body of Daimion was found in tattered clothes with most of its skin stripped off, which was reflected by his [[ghost]] when he and the other victims arose to confront the adventurers. After possessing one of them to speak,{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|16}} they managed to make him confess his sins, how he brought the owners of the Red Diamond Trading Company to ruin and death in order to acquire their lucrative trading contracts.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|17}} After they learned the identities of three shipping merchants that the trio had betrayed, the ghosts of all men departed.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|18}}

The adventurer that Daimion had possessed to communicate with the group was left with a persistent urge to take extensive notes about their investigation.
