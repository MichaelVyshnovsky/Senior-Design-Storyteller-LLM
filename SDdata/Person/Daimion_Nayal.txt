Daimion Nayal was a human merchant and member of the Master Mariners Guild in the late-15 century DR.
Daimion was a rather tall and thin man.
Daimion was a cold and calculating merchant, as well as a consummate schemer.
As a hobby Daimion spent his time researching and cataloguing the history of Waterdeep. Around the time of his death his focus was on the Lords of waterdeep, becoming a sort of scholar on the subject.
In 1459 DR, using his contacts in the Master Mariners Guild and a Masked Lord, he had managed to ruin Red Diamonds Trading Company. They were framed for bringing in illegal goods into port, the trial for their leadership was quick, and they were soon after sent to jail, where they died from food poisoning. Daimion then purchased the trading company at a cheap price. In return for the aid given to him by the Masked Lord, he smuggled a couple of chests on a ship bound to Amn,
In 1479 DR, on the night of Fleetswake, Daimion was to be honored with an award for his accomplishments as both a shipping merchant and member of the Master Mariners Guild.
A group of adventurers, hired by both the Guild of Watermen and the Master Mariners Guild to investigate the kidnappings,
The body of Daimion was found in tattered clothes with most of its skin stripped off, which was reflected by his ghost when he and the other victims arose to confront the adventurers. After possessing one of them to speak, they managed to make him confess his sins, how he brought the owners of the Red Diamond Trading Company to ruin and death in order to acquire their lucrative trading contracts. After they learned the identities of three shipping merchants that the trio had betrayed, the ghosts of all men departed.
The adventurer that Daimion had possessed to communicate with the group was left with a persistent urge to take extensive notes about their investigation.
