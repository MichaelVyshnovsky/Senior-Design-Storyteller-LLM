'''Fenerus Stormcastle''' ({{Pronounce|FEN|er|us|refs=}}) was a retired brigand-turned-spy who operated under the guise of a lamplighter in [[Waterdeep]] during the early 1490s [[DR]].
 
==Activities==
Beyond his work as a lamplighter, Fenerus spied on Waterdeep for agents of [[Luskan]], who were in fact secret [[drow]] operatives of [[Bregan D'aerthe]]. He provided information about current political decisions made in Waterdeep to his contacts in the City of Sails.

==History==
Fenerus was the founder of the infamous mounted bandit group known as the [[Blood Hawk Posse]]. He was ousted as the head of the gang after a failed raid and decided to retire in Waterdeep, where he unknowingly became the primary spy of Bregan D'aerthe.

In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} while under pressure from the [[Lords' Alliance]], the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] ordered the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] to arrest Fenerus for his past crimes.

If [[Jarlaxle]] managed to obtain the ''[[Stone of Golorr]]'', he entrusted the Stone to Fenerus. He hid the artifact before being arrested but to reveal the location Fenerus wanted to be released and have immunity for his past crimes.
