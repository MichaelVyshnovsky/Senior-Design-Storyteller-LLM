        "mainbody": "Lord Ssorg was a half-elf member of the Council of Lords in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR before that citys desttruction.\nSsorg was short and appeared to be oily. His skin was darker than usual.\nGemstones and coal were Ssorgs method of income, though he also dabbled with weapons and armor. He sold his wares through a store maintained in the Foreign Quarter, but also sold directly to other merchants and travelers. He supported the Zhentarims efforts, and those of Lord Manshoon, when it suited his needs. He often sold goods to the Black Network at discounted prices to get back into their good graces for past mishaps.\nSsorgs estate was located in the central section of Zhentil Keeps Inner Quarter on Gold Street and the Street of the Gods."
