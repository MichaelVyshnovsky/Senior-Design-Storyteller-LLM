==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Huntley's master got into a philosophical debate on the topic of the correct way to approach life with a beggar sage on the streets of Trademeet. When the nobleman was stupid and unable to prove his philosophy to the opponent, the simply ordered Huntley to cut down the beggar. However, it was unknown if anyone intervened to save the philosopher's life or challenged Huntley and his master to a battle.
