'''Chereth''', eventually the '''Old Man of the Mountain''', was a [[druid]], follower of [[Silvanus]], and [[Master of the Yuirwood]]. He resurrected the assassin [[Kheil]] and retrained him as [[Berun]]. On {{yearlink|1374}}, he attempted to destroy all of civilization in Faerûn with a supervolcano.
==Description==
On {{yearlink|1374}}, Chereth's hair had become a bone-white mane entwined with leaves, some of them appearing to grow there, although it had lost none of its thickness. He was slightly stooped.
==Powers==
Chereth could alter his features at will, an ability he employed to impersonate [[Alaodin]].
==History==
On {{yearlink|1365}}, Chereth requested an audience with [[Alaodin]] to study the Imaskari lore in the fortress of [[Sentinelspire (fortress)|Sentinelspire]], hoping to find an edge to push against civilization's encroachment into the wild. While there, he discovered the ''[[Erael'len]]'', a relic of [[Silvanus]]. He decided to flee the fortress, taking the relic, and slew several [[assassin]]s on the way out. That earned him the enmity of the Old Man of the Mountain, who sent a dozen of his best men, including [[Kheil]] and [[Sauk]], to slay him and the other Masters of the Yuirwood. The assassins arrived on [[Mirtul 2]]. Though some went uncaptured, the assassin Kheil was captured, and tortured to death by the rangers.

Chereth returned the assassin Kheil to life, as Berun, and trained him as a druid of [[Silvanus]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire|Prologue}} The two of them traveled together to many places, including the [[Khopet Dag]], where they remained with the [[yaqubi]] for two seasons.{{cite book/Sentinelspire|11}} They parted ways in {{yearlink|1369}} after they rescued a boy named [[Lewan]] from raiders of the [[Ganathwood]],{{cite book/Sentinelspire|2}}

After {{yearlink|1369}}, Chereth replaced [[Alaodin]] as the Old Man of the Mountain in [[Sentinelspire (fortress)|Sentinelspire]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire|5}} Per [[Berun]], the Old Man may have contrived for Sauk to bring him and ''[[Erael'len]]'', which he sought, to the fortress.{{cite book/Sentinelspire|5}} He was aware they still managed to capture Lewan, however, and had a conversation with the guest, in disguise.{{cite book/Sentinelspire|23}}

Chereth did not reveal himself to Lewan and Berun until the night of [[Tarsakh 25]] that year, when the latter forced his way through the guardians of the fortress. He proposed them that they should come with him to an [[Outer Plane]] once he successfully induced a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supervolcano  supervolcanic] eruption in [[Sentinelspire (mountain)|Sentinelspire]], plunging all of Faerûn into a volcanic winter to cause widespread famine and mass dying, so as to temporarily reduce civilization's impact upon nature, and leave them open to his guidance on the years after. He only needed ''[[Erael'len]]'' to accomplish this.{{cite book/Sentinelspire|36}} His disciple refused and fought him, stalling until the window of opportunity for the rite was over. Berun's own pupil, Lewan, dealt him the killing blow at the end of a long, protracted fight.{{cite book/Sentinelspire|40}}
