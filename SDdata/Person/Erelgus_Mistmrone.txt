Erelgus Mistmrone was an eccentric painter of Yhaunn, considered to be the most prestigious painter of Sembia by some in the 15 century DR.
Erelguss fame came from his oversized paintings, which were beloved across Sembia. His works were notoriously oversizedâ€”each painting was about the size of a barns doors. Erelguss paintings usually depicted scenic Sembian seacoasts with waves crashing over purple-hued rocks. The paintings often showed picturesque castles and pergolas as well as figures of people wearing gowns.
