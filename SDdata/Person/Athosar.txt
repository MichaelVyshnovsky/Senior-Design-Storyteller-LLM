Prior Athosar was a human cleric and morninglord of Lathander at the Spires of the Morning temple in Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He served the aging High Radiance Ghentilara.
Athosar was serving as prior of the Spires of the Morning by 1357 DR and through 1368 DR.
He was still there by 1372 DR and through 1374 DR, but by then Athosar was ambitious for advancement.
He lived with fellow prior Bamaal Dunster in one of the Chambers of Radiance, on the ground floor of one of the temple towers.
