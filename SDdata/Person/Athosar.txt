Prior '''Athosar''' was a [[human]] [[cleric]] and [[morninglord]] of [[Lathander]] at the [[Spires of the Morning]] temple in [[Waterdeep]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
He served the aging High Radiance [[Ghentilara]].

==History==
Athosar was serving as prior of the Spires of the Morning by [[1357 DR]] and through [[1368 DR]].

He was still there by [[1372 DR]] and through [[1374 DR]], but by then Athosar was ambitious for advancement.

==Home==
He lived with fellow prior [[Bamaal Dunster]] in one of the Chambers of Radiance, on the ground floor of one of the temple towers.
