{{Quote|''You think you can just walk into our camp? Present yourself to Ulma or leave.''|Cassivora Dophir}}

==Description==
Cassivora had a stern look and even tougher personality. She wore a nose ring and a set of crude [[leather armor]] with a [[leather]] [[circlet]] on her head. Cassivora carried two [[scimitar]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Cassivora Dophir's monster hunter tribe found itself targeted by the [[vampire]]s of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the conflict with the [[Cult of the Absolute]] crisis, when the Gurs camped in the [[Rivington]] district of the city, along with a small army of refugees displaced by the conflict. To the Gurs' horror, the tribe's children were abducted by the vampires under orders from [[Cazador Szarr]]. Cassivora could be found near tribe's funeral bonfire sternly commanding visitors to announced themselves to Ulma.
