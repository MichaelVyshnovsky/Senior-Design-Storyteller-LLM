'''Wiggan Nettlebee''' was the patriarch of the [[halfling]] [[Nettlebee]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] clan during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Personality==
Wiggan disliked outsiders, believing all of them to be evildoers who would steal from him if they could. He did not fully understand the true plan of the Black Earth, but considered them only a good ally for securing his finances and sustaining his position. A greedy miser, Wiggan become visibly upset at the thought of parting with even a few spare coins from his hoard.

==Activities==
Wiggan managed a ranch in the Dessarin Valley with his clan. Secretly, he joined the Cult of the Black Earth.

==History==
Wiggan had led his clan for a long time. Thanks to his cunning, they'd amassed a fortune. To gain more money, he approached the [[Cult of the Black Earth]], but soon become intrigued by earth powers and joined the cult. Thanks to the cultists, the Nettlebees became even more rich.

In [[1491 DR]], after some adventurers defeated the earth cultists at the [[Sacred Stone Monastery]], the cult's leaders ordered Wiggan and his family to set up a trap to kill the adventurers. Wiggan and his son [[Bertram Nettlebee]] spread rumors about a "fire witch" in their fields, burning an old [[Uthgardt]] barrow mound, in order to lure the adventurers.

When the adventurers came to investigate the mound, Wiggan summoned an [[earth elemental]] to destroy the mound and kill all inside. However, this awoke a dead chieftain of the [[Elk tribe]], [[Javor]]. Javor rose as a [[revenant]] and wanted revenge against Wiggan and Bertram. Somehow, the adventurers resolved the situation and Wiggan was killed.
