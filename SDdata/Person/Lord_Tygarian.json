        "History": "Sometime before [[1372 DR]], Lord Tygarian's daughter was kidnapped and held hostage by Baralen the Black. The lord paid a ransom for his daughter with a set of [[enchanted]] [[light armor]], ''[[Fencer's Grace]]''. The pirate however refused to let Lady Tygarian go as promised. When the daughter found out about it, she flew into a fit of rage and struck the pirate dead. She went on to become a pirate herself and she used the ''Fencer's Grace'' to achieve that goal."
