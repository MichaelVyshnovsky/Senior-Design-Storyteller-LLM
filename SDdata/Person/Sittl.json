Sittl tried to kill Xzorsh but failed and they reconciled. Sittl said that he had been captured by a group of [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]]. However, the [[drow]] wizard [[Liriel Baenre]] read Sittl's mind and saw strange images, starting to suspect the truth. After some investigation, she deducted the truth of Sittl.\n\nAt last, Xzorsh found Sittl inside Ascarle with the [[Northlander]] traitor [[Dragmar]] and finally Sittl revealed the truth to his presumed friend. However, Xzorsh easily killed Sittl.",
        "Relationships": "[[Xzorsh]], a [[sea elf]], was Sittl's presumed partner and close friend until the elf discovered Sittl's allegiance to [[Ascarle]].",
