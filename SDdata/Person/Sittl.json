        "mainbody": "Sittl was a malenti spy of Ascarle.\nSittl was a great actor, always with the facade of a happy and generous person. In truth, he was a sadist with a bloodlust.\nSittl posed as an aquatic elf ranger and normally wandered the Trackless Sea with fellow sea elf ranger Xzorsh.\nHe assisted Xzorsh in 1361 DR to help the Elfmaid, which was pursued by the Kraken Society of Ascarle and by Rethnor of Luskan.\nXzorsh searched for him and finally found Sittl on Ruathym under the charm of a kelpie. Sittl tried to kill Xzorsh but failed and they reconciled. Sittl said that he had been captured by a group of merrow. However, the drow wizard Liriel Baenre read Sittls mind and saw strange images, starting to suspect the truth. After some investigation, she deducted the truth of Sittl.\nAt last, Xzorsh found Sittl inside Ascarle with the Northlander traitor Dragmar and finally Sittl revealed the truth to his presumed friend. However, Xzorsh easily killed Sittl.\nXzorsh, a sea elf, was Sittls presumed partner and close friend until the elf discovered Sittls allegiance to Ascarle.\nCategoryRangers\nCategoryMalenti\nCategorySahuagin\nCategorySpies\nCategoryMembers of the Kraken Society\nCategoryInhabitants of Ascarle\nCategoryInhabitants of the Purple Rocks\nCategoryInhabitants of the Trackless Sea\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\n1rmsmv10oxzpuhrlkqsymyixnzpxo0a"
