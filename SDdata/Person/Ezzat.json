        "mainbody": "Ezzat was a lich who resided in Undermountain. There was no one level he called home as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, but he resided in the Runestone Caverns as of the late 15 century DR.\nMany centuries prior to the 14 century DR and before becoming a lich, Ezzat was offered the chance by Halaster to become an apprentice of his, but was convinced otherwise by a priest friend of his named Lliira lightened.\nLater, his priest friend died of old age, which prompted Ezzat to become a lich to avoid the same fate. He later set up a tower in a stalagmite on the Runestone Caverns level of Undermountain, and later acquired a pseudodragon companion Ipses. Here he was based around 1492 DR.\nEzzat dreamed of one day taking over Undermountain from Halaster Blackcloak, and fantasized about one day forming an alliance with Halasters former companion, Jhesiyra Kestellharp.\nHe was skilled at the game Coroniir, which he sometimes played with a staff of frost he had imbued with sentience.\nEzzat owned an ebony wand and a amulet of proof against detection, as well as a large collection of books on Undermountain, which he used to research how to overthrow Halaster."
