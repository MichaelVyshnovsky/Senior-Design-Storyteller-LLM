'''Uldrak''' was a former [[empyrean]] in [[Avernus]], first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Once Uldrak went to Avernus to kill [[Tiamat]] and gain honor for his god [[Surtur]]. However, Tiamat defeated Uldrak and [[curse]]d him to be [[polymorph]]ed into a [[spinagon]]. From then on, he plotted to regain his true form. At one point he discovered he needed some blood from Tiamat but until the {{YearlinkName|1494}},{{BG-DiA-time}} it was impossible for him obtain a sample.

==Personality==
After millennia isolated, Uldrak had begun to lose his mind. he often argued with himself, even in front of strangers.
