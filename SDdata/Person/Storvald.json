        "mainbody": "Jarl '''Storvald''' was the ruler of the [[frost giant]]s in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], at time of the shattering of the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]].",
        "History": "In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, after the disappearance of [[storm giant]] king [[Hekaton]], all giant lords started their path to reshape the ordning. Storvald first led his minions to reclaim [[Svardborg]] on the [[Sea of Moving Ice]], the ancestral home of the frost giants, and managed also to enslave a pair of [[white dragon]]s.\n\nLater, Storvald planned to find the fabled ''[[Ring of Winter]]'' in order to start a new ice age, thus achieved frost giant supremacy. and an ill-conceived expedition to [[Chult]]. Later, Storvald gained the allegiance of a tribe of [[Northlander]] barbarians and the alliance of the [[Zhentarim]] wizard [[Nilraun Dhaerlost]], who was also interested in locating the ''Ring'', and so he sent his minions in search of the [[artifact]].\n\nOften, Storvald left Svardborg in his colossal warship ''[[Krigvind]]'' (\"Warwind\") to hunt [[whale]]s."
