        "mainbody": "arl Storvald was the ruler of the frost giants in the late 15 century DR, at time of the shattering of the ordning.\nIn the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, after the disappearance of storm giant king Hekaton, all giant lords started their path to reshape the ordning. Storvald first led his minions to reclaim Svardborg on the Sea of Moving Ice, the ancestral home of the frost giants, and managed also to enslave a pair of white dragons.\nLater, Storvald planned to find the fabled Ring of Winter in order to start a new ice age, thus achieved frost giant supremacy. and an ill-conceived expedition to Chult. Later, Storvald gained the allegiance of a tribe of Northlander barbarians and the alliance of the Zhentarim wizard Nilraun Dhaerlost, who was also interested in locating the Ring, and so he sent his minions in search of the artifact.\nOften, Storvald left Svardborg in his colossal warship Krigvind (\"Warwind\") to hunt whales."
