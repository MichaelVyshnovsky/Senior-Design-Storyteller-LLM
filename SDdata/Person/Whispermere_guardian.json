        "mainbody": "The '''Whispermere guardian''' was a [[zombie]] [[dragon turtle]] that lurked near [[Black Tree Bend]] in the [[Whispermere]] of the [[Shadow Swamp]] of the [[Plane of Shadow]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].\n\nThe guardian was installed there by [[Esvele Graycastle]], a priestess of [[Shar]], to guard the water route between the [[Shadow Citadel]] and the [[Monastery of the Ebon Dome]]. It would rise and try to capsize any boat that tried to pass Black Tree Bend (which looked no different from any other turn in the waterway), and devour its crew. However, although mindless, music soothed this savage beast: a particular haunting tune played on a [[dragonbone lyre]] would calm the zombie, causing it to submerge back into the murky depths.\n\nEsvele gave the lyre and the tune to the [[shadar-kai (fey)|shadar-kai]] ferrymaster [[Sithierel]] so he could safely pilot the ''[[Necreme]]'' through the swamp, bypassing the guardian. However, it may have been destroyed by adventurers investigating the deeds of the cult of Shar in the swamp in early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]]."
