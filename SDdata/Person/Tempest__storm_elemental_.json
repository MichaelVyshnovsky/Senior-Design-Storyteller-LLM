        "mainbody": "he Tempest was a mighty storm elemental blight of the Elemental Plane of Air that devastated parts of the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 1340s DR.The \"What is the Green Regent\" article introduces \"a terrible storm elemental\nblight\" to the story of the tempest, and capitalizes \"Tempest\" twice, make it appear to be a specific creature. A storm elemental seems likely, but it is unclear what is meant by a blight here. The Howling of a Mighty Storm does not include this detail and uses lower case.\nAs the Storm Lord Talos opposed the Lady of the Forest Mielikki and her dream for peace in the Delimbiyr Crescent, so too did his faithful despise her chosenâ€”the Green Regents and their Scions. Thus, the Talassans attacked the Green Regents whenever they got the chance and several times tried to bring destruction to the Delimbiyr Vale. The greatest was in the , when, on a mountaintop deep in the Greypeaks, a cult of Talos summoned the Tempest. They dominated the elemental and unleashed it on the towns of Orlbar and Llorkh. The Tempest tore apart cottages with its terrific winds and assaulted the land with a barrage of rain. This caused the Grayflow river to flood, washing away swathes of Llorkh. It seemed driven to lay the whole Grayvale to waste.\nFinally, the Green Regent Kalahar Twohands led a band of Scions against the Tempest and the Talassan cult at their ritual site atop the Mount of Storms. After fierce fighting amidst a thunderstorm, Kalahar reversed the spell that had summoned the Tempest, ending its threat. With the cults leaders killed and their scheme ruined, the cult dispersed and was broken, until years later when Bolthar the Doombringer reassembled it."
