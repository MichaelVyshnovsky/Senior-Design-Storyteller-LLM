        "mainbody": "'''Ssar Tarell''' was a [[drow]] merchant who owned a store in the south-eastern region of the [[Menzoberranzan]] bazaar in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "The Menzoberranzan merchant could be found in her self-titled store. Her store contained many magical goods displayed around the premises. However, Ssar Tarell was known for her information, not wares. For vital information on the rising and falling of drow nobility, some would pay with their life. She was in love with [[Maznafein]], and told an adventuring party to visit [[Sorcere]] in order to acquire a scroll from [[Jalynfein]], in order to undo his [[drider]] curse. In return, she promised to tell the companions of the prisoners from their home village.\n\nAfter the drider curse had been undone, she kept her promise and told the companions to visit her informant, the wizard [[Grumsznar]] of [[House Fey-Branche]]. Upon the return of the companions, she opened up a portal between themselves and [[Vermulean]], the [[gem]] enchanter, to discuss the ''[[Helm of Spiders|Gem of Lolth]]''."
