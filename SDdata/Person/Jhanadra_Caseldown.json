        "mainbody": "Jhanadra Caseldown, known as Joybringer Caseldown after joining the Church of Lliira, was a song dragon and the high priestesses of the Cry of Joy temple in Hills Edge in the 14 century DR.\nCaseldown was known to be quite enthusiastic.\nCaseldown was renowned for her skills in acrobatic dancing and her high, clear singing voice. Rumors also circulated around Hills Edge that she also had strange magical powers, resulting from her being a song dragon.\nWhen not leading her clergy, Caseldown worked closely with the Harpers in secret to ensure the cultural growth of Hills Edge, making sure it continued to be a pleasant place to live. But she also worked with them to ensure the citys security, keeping it from falling under the sway of the Church of Cyric and the Zhentarim.\nJhanadra was largely loved by the inhabitants of Hills Edge, who affectionately referred to her as the Rose-Red Lady."
