        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], he was approached by cultists of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]] who offered their help in subjugating the area in exchange for his stopping all visitors to the nearby [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]]. He agreed, and soon he had conquered first the pacifist [[Shadow Talon]] [[goblin]] tribe and then the village of [[Tomrav]], capturing many hostages. Eventually, an adventuring party hired for a mission at the monastery were convinced by sergeant [[Sergor]] to fight Hrar and his minions, and the chieftain was killed."
