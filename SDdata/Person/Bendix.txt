Bendix was a mercenary who formed and commanded the Sailors of the Crimson Sea company based in Airspur in Chessenta and operating in Chondath in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Bendix formed the Sailors in the late 1350s DR, but since then they had suffered many misfortunes.
In the 1350s DR, Bendix and the Sailors of the Crimson Sea marched to the town of Timindar in Chondath, having been hired by Lord Reland Tymin to confront the dark forces of Yrkhetep at Thurgabanteth. However, while passing the edge of the Chondalwood, they were ambushed by unknown enemies. Sniper archers killed Bendix and the ambushers used oil to burn his body to prevent resurrection. The Sailors prevailed and killed all the ambushers.
