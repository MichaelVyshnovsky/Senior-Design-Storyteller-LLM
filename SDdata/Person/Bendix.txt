'''Bendix''' was a mercenary who formed and commanded the [[Sailors of the Crimson Sea]] company based in [[Airspur (Chessenta)|Airspur]] in [[Chessenta]] and operating in [[Chondath]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Bendix formed the Sailors in the late 1350s [[DR]], but since then they had suffered many misfortunes.

In the 1350s DR, Bendix and the Sailors of the Crimson Sea marched to the town of [[Timindar]] in Chondath, having been hired by Lord [[Reland Tymin]] to confront the dark forces of [[Yrkhetep]] at [[Thurgabanteth]]. However, while passing the edge of the [[Chondalwood]], they were ambushed by unknown enemies. Sniper archers killed Bendix and the ambushers used oil to burn his body to prevent resurrection. The Sailors prevailed and killed all the ambushers.
