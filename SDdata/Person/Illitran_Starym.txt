Lord '''Illitran Starym''' was Lord Speaker of the [[Starym]] clan. He infamously forged a pact with [[Moander]] in order to fool his [[Moonblade]] and retain power over the house.

In [[523 DR]], a branch of [[Moon elf | moon elven]] ex-patriate members of the Starym Clan returned to [[Myth Drannor]] to reclaim the house and return it to glory. The return drew the line of succession into question, as the heir at the time, [[Josidiah Starym]], was away on a mission to find the lost [[Warblade]] since [[500 DR]]. The [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl]] demanded that the current Lord Speaker, Illitran, draw his family's [[Moonblade]] to prove his worthiness and preserve Josidiah's heir status.

Determined to draw the blade successfully, Illitran set out on a three-month trek through the woods intended to purify his soul and clense his spirit. Unknown to all, he actually visited the ruins of Moander's temple in the northern forest, where he forged a pact with the imprisoned god, gaining the ability to cancel the powers of the sword that would deem him unworthy of Lordship. Upon his return, he easily drew the blade, and proved to Myth Drannor his family's loyalty.

While Josidiah was away, Illitran named his first son, [[Venali Starym]] the heir of the house Lordship.
