Gareth Dragonsbane rose to power in 1359 DR, with no other kings of Damara known to be such paladins of Ilmater. Thus, this article is written under the assumption that the events of Silverfish occur during the 1360s DR. slain, allegedly by Kosef Demsk

Mivar Greyman was a jeweler in Heliogabalus as of the late mid-14 century DR.
He was known to gamble and be bad at it, often borrowing money from Kosef Demsks associates to gamble.
Mivar Greyman was killed in the 1360s DR eyewitnesses fingered the gangster Kosef Demsk as the culprit, whose signature sword was left in his corpse. The gangster was later arrested for the crime.
Though Kosef Demsk was arrested for the crime, and evidence was strong that he was the culprit, others around him believed he may have been framed.
