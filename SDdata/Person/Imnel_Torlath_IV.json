        "mainbody": "King '''Imnel Torlath IV''' was an [[Amn]]ian monarch of the [[Torlath]] dynasty, known as the sixth Wizard-King of Amn.",
        "Relationships": "Imnel was the only son of of King [[Rhadik Torlath II|Rhadik II]]. He long outlived most of his family, with his great-grandson [[Niskam Torlath|Niskam]] as his heir, skipping his bastard son [[Rhor Torlath|Rhor]].",
        "History": "Increasing monster populations in eastern Amn and financial troubles involving the army led to the Imnel Concession in [[1090 DR]]. The deal sold the lands south of the [[Tethir Road]] in exchange for monetary and military aid from [[Tethyr]], partially reversing the Tejarn Purchase of [[692 DR]] handled by King [[Brinnaq Torlath I|Brinnaq I]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1094}}, King Imnel was assassinated by agents of the [[Skeletal Finger]] [[thieves' guild]] as part of a wider pattern of destruction across Amn and Tethyr. Over the following year, the agents of ambitious merchants slew the remaining Torlath heirs while attempting to manipulate the realm, quickly extinguishing the family line."
