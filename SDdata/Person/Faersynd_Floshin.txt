'''Faersynd Floshin''' was one of the leaders of the [[daemonfey]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].

==Relationships==
Faersynd's consort was [[Talya Floshin]].

==History==
Faersynd was the lord and patriarch of [[House Floshin]]. In [[1270 DR]], he joined the clergy of [[Ghaunadaur]] after he saw the god's power against [[Eaerlann]].

In 1370 DR, he tried to recruit a cult of followers of Ghaunadaur among fellow [[fey'ri]]. He provided to [[Sarya Dlardrageth]] the services of some [[tanar'ri]] servants of his god.

==Personality==
Faersynd was truly devoted to Ghaunadaur. He tried to covert all people he met. Faersynd cared nothing for leading his House, a duty he left to his consort Talya. He believed that [[Xiiltharra Dlardlagleth]] had been a pawn of Ghaunadaur.
