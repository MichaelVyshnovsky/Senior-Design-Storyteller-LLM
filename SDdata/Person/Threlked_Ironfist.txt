Threlked Ironfist was the king of Tuern in the midâ€”14 century DR.
Threlked appeared somewhat grizzled, having grey hair and a bald upper head. He often wore his armor and held his sword in hand.
The High King was civil, but he was also gruff.
In 1358 DR, the Heroes of Ascore, as well as several other adventuring groups, made their way to Tuern following vast rumors of meteorite ore being located on the volcanic island. King Threlked met with them, and warned the heroes that the many canyons across the isles were filled with very dangerous monsters.
