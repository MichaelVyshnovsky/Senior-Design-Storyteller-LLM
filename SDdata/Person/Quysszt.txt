Quysszt was a Zhentarim beholder.
Usually Quysszt floated in the Zhentarims headquarters, protected by an invisibility spell, spying upon the councilors under orders of Manshoon.
In 1358 DR, after the failure of both Avaerl and Zalarth Bloodbrow, Manshoon decided to go himself and kill Elminster Aumar at Spellgard. So the High Lord of the Zhentarim ordered the wizard Belaghar to take care of Zhentil Keep and ordered Quysszt to control and eventually kill him and others if any treachery or misjudgments occurred during Manshoons absence.
