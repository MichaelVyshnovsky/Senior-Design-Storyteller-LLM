'''Quysszt''' was a [[Zhentarim]] [[beholder]].

==Activities==
Usually Quysszt floated in the Zhentarim's headquarters, protected by an ''[[invisibility]]'' spell, spying upon the councilors under orders of [[Manshoon]].

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], after the failure of both [[Avaerl]] and [[Zalarth Bloodbrow]], Manshoon decided to go himself and kill [[Elminster Aumar]] at [[Spellgard]]. So the High Lord of the Zhentarim ordered the wizard [[Belaghar]] to take care of [[Zhentil Keep]] and ordered Quysszt to control and eventually kill him and others if any treachery or misjudgments occurred during Manshoon's absence.
