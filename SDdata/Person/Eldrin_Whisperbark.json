        "mainbody": "ldrin Whisperbark was a young quarter-elf human farmer of the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 14 century DR. He was also a Scion of the Green Regent.\nThe Whisperbark family lived on a sizeable farm west of Loudwater and south of the Delimbiyr River. It faced onto the river and had several fields, pasturage, and an orchard. The farmhouse lay at the center close to some oak trees.\nAt the ceremony for the choosing of the Green Regent on Shieldmeet of the , Eldrin was among the volunteers and was accepted as a Scion, which he was quite happy about.Implied to be a Scion in 1371, Eldrin was most likely accepted in the 1368 ceremony. It is possible he served under Galaer Grasswave in the Night of the Blood Moon battle. He is apparently still a Scion after the 1372 ceremony, suggesting he was accepted again. However, it is unclear if Scions hold their titles for life or for only four years.\nIn the , Eldrin was one of a band Scions who tried to trail the Half-Elven Renegades following one of their raids. However, the Renegades turned and ambushed them, and while the other Scions escaped, Eldrin was captured and held for ransom. His family paid the ransom and he was released.\nEldrin was rather charming. His mother was pressuring him to get married and settle down, so he would flirt with any attractive woman (human, elf, or half-elf) he met, but only if she was receptive. He was a faithful follower of Mielikki.\nHe was quite handsome and fine-featured, with his eyes indicating his elvish heritage. His captivity by the Renegades left him with a scar down the outside of one arm and another across his belly. While a Scion of the Green Regent, Eldrin bore the holy symbol of Mielikki upon his brow, glowing emerald.\nEldrin did farm-work, wood-chopping, and chores during the day. During the evenings, he was a regular of the Merry Mer-She tavern, where he joked and drank with his friends."
