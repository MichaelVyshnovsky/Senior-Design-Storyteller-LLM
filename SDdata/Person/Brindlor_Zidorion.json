        "mainbody": "'''Brindlor Zidorion''' was a [[deathsinger]] from [[Ched Nasad]].",
        "Description": "Brindlor wore fine clothes and gems. He had long hair, which he wore in many braids. In [[1361 DR]], [[Gorlist]] placed the [[Ruby of Chissentra]], a [[scrying]] gem, in his forehead at the behest of [[priestess]] [[Shakti Hunzrin]]; and it appeared almost like a third eye.",
        "Abilities": "As a deathsinger,<ref group=\"note\">A deathsinger appears to be a type of [[bard]] that utilizes [[necromantic]] magic. Brindlor was able to control the dead through his song, which sounded as a keening wail with the harsh, irregular rhythm of drow chant.",
        "History": "In [[1361 DR]], Brindlor was hired by [[Gorlist]] to help with and record the pursuit of [[Liriel Baenre]] in revenge for her killing of [[Nisstyre]], Gorlist's father. Gorlist, pressed upon his forehead the ruby Nisstyre previously had, allowing direct communication with Shakti, which proved to be the cause of his death when he was killed in Gorlist's assault upon Liriel in [[Rashemen]], as Liriel used the gem as a somatic component for a spell causing him to burst in an explosion of gore and viscera."
