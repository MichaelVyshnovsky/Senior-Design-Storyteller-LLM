Krebbyg Masqilyr () was one of the top agents of the Bregan Daerthe in Waterdeep during the early 1490s DR.
Krebbyg, together with Soluun Xibrindas and Felrekt Lafeen, was tasked by Jarlaxle with doing dirty deeds in the city. Krebbyg resided on the Scarlet Marpenoth ship where he sharpened his sword.
After the destruction of his house, Krebbyg had no more connections in the underdark and so he joined Bregan Daerthe.
In 1492 DR, if Jarlaxle managed to obtain the Stone of Golorr, then Felrekt and Krebbyg confronted some adventurers first in Mistshore where they had the support of the Lantanese mechanical dragon turtle Big Belchy and again in the Dock Ward.
Krebbyg was young and rash. He preferred to follow Felrekts leadership.
Felrekt and Krebbyg were a working team.
Like his fellows Soluun Xibrindas and Felrekt Lafeen, Krebbyg was equipped with Lantanese firearms.
