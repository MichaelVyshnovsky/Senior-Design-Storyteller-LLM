'''Krebbyg Masq'il'yr''' ({{Pronounce|KREH|big|_|MASK|il|eer|refs=}}) was one of the top agents of the [[Bregan D'aerthe]] in [[Waterdeep]] during the early 1490s [[DR]].
 
==Activities==
Krebbyg, together with [[Soluun Xibrindas]] and [[Fel'rekt Lafeen]], was tasked by [[Jarlaxle]] with doing dirty deeds in the city. Krebbyg resided on the ''[[Scarlet Marpenoth]]'' ship where he sharpened his sword.
 
==History==
After the destruction of his house, Krebbyg had no more connections in the [[underdark]] and so he joined [[Bregan D'aerthe]].

In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} if Jarlaxle managed to obtain the ''[[Stone of Golorr]]'', then Fel'rekt and Krebbyg confronted some adventurers first in [[Mistshore]] where they had the support of the [[Lantanese]] mechanical [[dragon turtle]] [[Big Belchy]] and again in the [[Dock Ward]].

==Personality==
Krebbyg was young and rash. He preferred to follow Fel'rekt's leadership.

==Relationship==
Fel'rekt and Krebbyg were a working team.

==Possessions==
Like his fellows Soluun Xibrindas and Fel'rekt Lafeen, Krebbyg was equipped with Lantanese [[firearm]]s.
