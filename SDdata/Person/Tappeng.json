        "Activities": "Tappeng was the chieftain of the [[Kabundusil]] tribe, one of the most savage [[Bawani]] tribes. Other tribes lived in fear of those times when Tappeng led a party on a headhunting raid or decided to pillage others' rice fields and burn their dwellings.\nTappeng was greatly concerned about the [[Bavanese]] and despised the subtle merchants who in his eyes truly ran the civilized kingdom. He promoted inter-tribal fighting because he believed it necessary to keep fit."
