Atrion was a member of the Freedom Riders under the command of Randal Morn in Shadowdale in the midâ€“14 century DR. 
Around the year 1369 DR, Randal, Atrion, and some other Freedom Riders led an expedition into Shraevyns Tomb. Following an initial battle with the Zhentarim, the entire group was either captured, or killed and turned into undead by the shadow Gothyl, save for Atrion. He managed to escape the chaos of the battle and return to Shadowdale.
After he carried himself back to town, Atrion sought out the great wizard and sage Elminster, at his tower. He found the scribe Lhaeo but managed to convince him to form a rescue party for the commander and resistance leader.
