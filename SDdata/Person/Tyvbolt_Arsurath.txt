'''Tyvbolt Arsurath''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|537}} to {{yearlink|544}}.

==Appearance==
Tyvbolt was an albino.

==Personality==
He was coldly tight-lipped, cruel, brilliant, and hateful. He sometimes lashed aggressively at people just because he didn't like the way they looked, and for other lesser offenses, including daring to use magic at all.

==History==
After slaying the last [[Magister]], Tyvbolt's mage-hunts made him so feared he began to receive gits from other mages teleported directly to his doorstep, meant to distract more than appease. After he was gifted the slave [[Chelathra]], he abandoned his mage-hunts to try to make her his assistant. Showing no aptitude for sorcery, he instead embedded a plethora of magic items into her, beginning with [[wand]]s in her arms.

While slaying two [[red dragon]]s for their body parts and blood, he was chellenged by [[Annath Sunfall]]; as he was weakened, he left the challenge for Chelathra. She sensed his weakness and attacked him instead; though Tyvbolt prevailed, Annath ultimately managed to slay him.
