Tyvbolt Arsurath was the Magister from  to .
Tyvbolt was an albino.
He was coldly tight-lipped, cruel, brilliant, and hateful. He sometimes lashed aggressively at people just because he didnt like the way they looked, and for other lesser offenses, including daring to use magic at all.
After slaying the last Magister, Tyvbolts mage-hunts made him so feared he began to receive gits from other mages teleported directly to his doorstep, meant to distract more than appease. After he was gifted the slave Chelathra, he abandoned his mage-hunts to try to make her his assistant. Showing no aptitude for sorcery, he instead embedded a plethora of magic items into her, beginning with wands in her arms.
While slaying two red dragons for their body parts and blood, he was chellenged by Annath Sunfall as he was weakened, he left the challenge for Chelathra. She sensed his weakness and attacked him instead though Tyvbolt prevailed, Annath ultimately managed to slay him.
