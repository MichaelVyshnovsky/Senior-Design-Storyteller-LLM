'''Glorantha Steelrain''' was a talented [[bladesinger]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By her 133{{th}} birthday, Glorantha was a well-respected [[elf|elven]] bladesinger, master of the [[longsword]], and a one-woman army. She bore a [[tattoo]] of a great [[cat]] that signified her formidable battle prowess and complimented her cat-like grace. Glorantha made her name traveling along the [[Sword Coast]], working to benefit her elven kin. However, few believed her deeds as the woman was prone to exaggeration, and because she traveled alone, her heroics rarely had any witnesses.

Sometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, Glorantha Steelrain was among [[adventurer]]s interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally mysterious magical ''orb'' from its depths.
