Alak Xorlarrin was a drow of House Xorlarrin and a twin son of the archmage of QXorlarrin, Tsabrak Xorlarrin.
In 1484 DR, during the War of the Silver Marches, Tsabrak appointed Alak and his twin sister Alystin Xorlarrin to find and take control of the Fell Fortress in order to create an undead army. However, an adventuring party hired by the dwarf mystic Axelcrantz confronted and defeated them.
