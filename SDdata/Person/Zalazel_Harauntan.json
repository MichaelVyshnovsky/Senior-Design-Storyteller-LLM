        "mainbody": "Zalazel Harauntan was a skilled wizard inhabiting the city of Yhep along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nAs the most skilled practitioner of the Art in town, she used her skills to protect both Yhep and its valuable oyster beds. She also tutored a handful of students in the use of magic. She owned a large house in town, but actually spent most of her time within a large stilt house positioned directly over the oyster beds on the Lake of Steam.\nZalazel was a member of Yheps ruling family. Her most promising student was a wild tribeswoman named Yashiira."
