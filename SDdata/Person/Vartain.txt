'''Vartain''' was a widely traveled [[riddlemaster]] originally from [[Calimport]].

==Description==
Vartain was bald.

==History==
Vartain grew up on the streets of Calimport. He later became a respected riddlemaster and language scholar. He was trained in Mulhorand tradition.

In [[1364 DR]], Vartain was hired by [[Elaith Craulnober]] to help him seek out the [[Morninglark]] harp. They were joined by [[Harper|Harpers]] [[Danilo Thann]] and company and traveled to the [[High Forest]], where Vartain was posed a conundrum by the riddle-loving dragon [[Grimnoshtadrano]]. Vartain overthought the riddle and answered incorrectly. His anguish at answering incorrectly later led him to go behind Danilo's back and pose [[Iriador Wintermist]] the same conundrum; she also failed to answer correctly.

==Possessions==
Vartain carried and was skilled with a [[blowpipe]] ([[dart]]s).
