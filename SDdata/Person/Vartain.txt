Vartain was a widely traveled riddlemaster originally from Calimport.
Vartain was bald.
Vartain grew up on the streets of Calimport. He later became a respected riddlemaster and language scholar. He was trained in Mulhorand tradition.
In 1364 DR, Vartain was hired by Elaith Craulnober to help him seek out the Morninglark harp. They were joined by Harpers Danilo Thann and company and traveled to the High Forest, where Vartain was posed a conundrum by the riddle-loving dragon Grimnoshtadrano. Vartain overthought the riddle and answered incorrectly. His anguish at answering incorrectly later led him to go behind Danilos back and pose Iriador Wintermist the same conundrum she also failed to answer correctly.
Vartain carried and was skilled with a blowpipe (darts).
