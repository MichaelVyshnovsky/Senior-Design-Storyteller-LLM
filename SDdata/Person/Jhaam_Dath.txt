'''Jhaam''' was the warrior-king of an ancient [[human]] folk living around {{Yearlink|-5800}}. He led his people in a series of minor wars against neighboring villages. Through this, he wanted to secure his realm from attack. When he died, his successors established the capital city [[Naarkolyth]] and with it the realm of [[Jhaamdath]]. Jhaam was known as the greatest [[psionic]] warrior of his people and the founder of the [[Dath Dynasty]].
