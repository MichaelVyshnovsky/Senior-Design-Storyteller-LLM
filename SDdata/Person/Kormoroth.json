        "History": "In late [[Mirtul]] of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Kormoroth was plotting against King [[Foril Obarskyr I]] of Cormyr. He was supported by a [[Westgate]]-aligned cabal that meant to slay the king and then gain a foothold in the ruling of [[Cormyr]] by allying with the nobles that rose to power instead. He and his minions attacked the mansion of a member of a rival conspiracy with similar aims, [[Andranth Glarvreth]] during a dinner in which he hosted the nobleman [[Olgarth Oldbridle]] looking for an alliance. The guest's bodyguard, [[Burrath]], killed Kormoroth moments after he slew Olgarth; Andranth Glarvreth escaped.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Later, after the death of [[Olgarth Oldbridle]], [[Elbert Oldbridle]] sent his servant [[Osbur]] to lord [[Traevyn Illance]] to warn him to mind the perfidy of cabals from [[Sembian]] and Westgate, naming specifically Kormoroth, [[Yestrel]], and the [[Lhendreth]]s of [[Saerloon]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep/Hardcover|135|14}}"
