        "mainbody": "'''King Toba''' was a [[plaguechanged]] [[giant snapping turtle]] that made its home in [[Snapping Turtle Bay]] on the southern coast of [[Chult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The name was bestowed on the beast by the local [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultans]].",
        "Description": "King Toba was was said to be the size of a house and, indeed, the beast was unusually large and hearty for a giant snapping turtle. Energies from the [[Spellplague]] had caused parts of its shell to turn into [[gemstone]]-like crystals, which granted the turtle some resistance to [[spell]]s and other [[magic]]. Upwards of sixty such crystals covered the shell, each of which was potentially quite attractive to treasure hunters (and valued at about 10 [[gp]] apiece).",
        "Activities": "King Toba spent its days sunning on the white sand beaches of Snapping Turtle Bay, at least whenever the sky was clear of smoke and ash from the nearby [[Peaks of Flame]].",
        "History": "Naturally, rumors of this gem-studded turtle had reached all the way to [[Port Nyanzaru]] as of the late 15{{th}} century DR."
