'''Qipley''' was a [[Netherese]] beautician who operated the [[Coddled Cuticle]] in [[Eileanar]] until its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Activities==
Qipley was one of the finest hairdressers in [[Netheril]], but the softly-spoken man was truly passionate about manicures. He used an array of lotions and balms to treat the skin of his clients, and fine abrasive pads to polish nails to perfection. While he was regarded as soft and useless by practical folk, he was extremely popular in the enclave and suffered no lack of customers.
