        "mainbody": "{{Quote|''A hand of blood and bone guides your actions, and while the light is served, so too is the hungry skull.''|The [[Oracle of the Moon]]}}\n'''Dyrl Godsword''' was a [[human]] [[mystic]] and secret cultist of [[Cyric]] active in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "He was charismatic and manipulative, and had a flair for the theatrical in how he spoke.",
        "Abilities": "Dyrl had the ability to project a spectral image of himself all across the [[Sword Coast North]] from his home in the [[Neverwinter/Protector's Enclave|Protector's Enclave]] of Neverwinter. This image could converse seemingly freely with anyone, but he chose to only reveal it to those of strong religious faith in order to manipulate them.",
        "Activities": "Dyrl claimed to be a spiritual conduit for any and all [[good]] [[Deity|deities]]. He would prey upon the faith of particularly devout individuals, especially [[clerics]], and claim to bring them instructions and wisdom from the gods. He would push more powerful individuals to take on seemingly divinely ordained missions that in fact were beneficial to his quest for power or were otherwise designed to undermine Cyric's rivals.",
        "History": "Sometime in the mid-to-late 15{{Th}} century, Dyrl found or created a cavern beneath his home in the Protector's Enclave from which to worship Cyric in secret. By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Dyrl's claims to be a conduit for benevolent gods had amassed a small following in Neverwinter. Around this time, he made contact with devoted clerics of goodly gods to encourage them to undermine various rivals of Cyric in the region under the guise of asking them to fight against evil. The tasks he called for included killing a warrior of [[Gruumsh]] named [[Gruuman Xuluksh]] in the Neverwinter [[Neverwinter/River District|Tower District]], assisting a [[Helmite]] priest to undermine [[Asmodeus]] worshipers in [[Helm's Hold]], and aiding a [[Sel√ªnite]] [[Oracle of the Moon|oracle]] in fending off intrusions by [[Shar]] in [[Neverwinter Wood]].\n\nDyrl began attracting suspicion not long afterward when some of his followers began disappearing, and then especially when one of them was discovered dead and priests of [[Kelemvor]] found that they could not contact the deceased's soul. Sargent [[Alphonse Knox]] of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] and [[Aralynn|Aralynn the Pious]] of [[Tyr]] recruited a [[Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge|powerful cleric]] to investigate Dyrl, who immediately showed his true colors as a worshiper of Cyric."
