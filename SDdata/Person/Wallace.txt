Wallace was a merchant who sold his wares in the marketplace of Trademeet during the midâ€“14 century DR.
While he was an honest man, Wallaces judgement in business matters was not always the best. He had pale skin and dark brown hair.
Among his wares were various projectiles, some scant weaponry, and potions, including potions of love.
Wallace was good friends with Mazzy Fentan, her sister Pala, and the rest of the Fentan family, having known them for decades.
In the , Wallace started doing business with a new supplier, Barl. Unbeknownst to Wallace, Barl was a worshiper of the deity Talona. This resulted in Danno Fairfoot purchasing of a poisoned potion of love for his  betrothedt Pala Fentan, which rendered her comatose. Soon after, Mazzy was asked for aid in investigating her sisters condition.
