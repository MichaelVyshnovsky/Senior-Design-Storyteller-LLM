'''Gysheer Omfreys''' was a worshiper of [[Asmodeus]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1492 DR]], Gysheer instigated some [[spined devil]]s to terrorize people in the [[Field Ward of Waterdeep]]. This attracted the attention of [[Savra Belabranta]], who, under orders of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]], hired some adventurers to eliminate the devils, eventually discovering and defeating Gysheer.

==Personality==
Gysheer was a member of the devil cult led by [[Victoro Cassalanter]], but only magical compulsion could force her to implicate Victorio.
