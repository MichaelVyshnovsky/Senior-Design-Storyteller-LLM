Matruda al-Muhif was a holy slayer and member of the Flamedeath Fellowship in Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Matruda separated herself from the other members of the Fellowship, gaining well-earned infamy throughout the Land of Fate.
Matruda was a close ally of Kerima al-Zahir of the Brotherhood of the True Flame.
In addition to her martial prowess, Matruda was a master of disguise.
