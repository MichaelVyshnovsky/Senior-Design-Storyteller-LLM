Asrigir was a seer that wrote sacred texts about Tempus.
Asrigir was known as the Bearded Seer of the Moonsea to worshipers of the Lord of Battles. The seer wrote many texts that were collectively known as the Holy Texts of Asrigir.
In 1358 DR, the Holy Texts of Asrigir were being carried by Graeme ibn-Naif, a senior acolyte at the Vault of Swords. He was waylaid by bandits, and the sacred texts were stolen. The bandit group were found by another priest of Tempus, Tanareve, when the group were about to throw the texts in the fire. Tanareve summoned a blazing spiritual hammer and attacked the group, who bolted away in fear. The texts were recovered undamaged.
