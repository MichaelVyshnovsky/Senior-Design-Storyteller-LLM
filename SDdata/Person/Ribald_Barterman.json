He lived through many adventures and would talk about killing a [[beholder]] or defeating an [[orc]] horde alone like he speaking of the weather. During his adventuring days, Ribald Barterman worked alongside [[Jaheira]] and the [[Harpers]] on several occasions.\n\nAt last, he returned to his home city and opened the Adventurer Mart within [[Waukeen's Promenade]]. He was always ready to give advice and information to young adventurers. Ribald employed a small army of scribes to keep up with the business's demand and keep his catalogues up to date. By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Ribald's shop had been open for thirty three years off of which were spent in the same location and bragged about knowing his customers by name. His pet [[wyvern]] named [[Lucy]] could be found fluttering about the Adventurer Mart."
