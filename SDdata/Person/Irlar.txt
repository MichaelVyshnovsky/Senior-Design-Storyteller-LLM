Lord '''Irlar''' was a servant of [[Bane]] and a suitor to [[Alustriel]]. After he attempted to kidnap her, she slew him.

==Personality==
Irlar was forceful, scornful, and demanding. Per Alustriel, he was almost certainly a coward, too.

==Possessions==
He had a dagger.

==Relationships==
He wanted Alustriel's hand; in her appreciation, it was mostly so he would inherit [[Bluetower]] from her uncle, as he had often been cruel and dismissive with her.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|177|12}}

==History==
While Alustriel was living in her uncle's manor, Irlar was a guest at least once. In a shieldmeet of either 770 or 774, he already hated Harpers, and Alustriel for having the blood of one, as well as for practicing magic.

On [[Uktar 10]] of {{yearlink|778}}, Lord Irlar rode to Bluetower to court [[Alustriel]], together with a pomp of men in finery. He found no objection from her uncle [[Thamator]], and remained their guest for two evenings; on [[Uktar 12]] he announced over dinner his intention to take her in the evening; she assumed it was to a temple of Bane, where he would force her forswear [[Mystra]] and then conceive Irlar's child.

When he came to her room in the middle of the night, Alustriel struck him first, using her magic (which was meager at the time). Rather than flee her chambers he fought her, and after a long and deadly struggle, she finally threw him out of the window. That killed him.
