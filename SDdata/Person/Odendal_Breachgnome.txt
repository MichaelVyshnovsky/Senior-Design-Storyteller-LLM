Odendal Breachgnome was a svirfneblin guard captain for a village in the Underdark.
Odendal guarded the front of his village, with another pair of guards. He would allow outsiders in, so long as they spoke to the leader of the deep gnomes. He would respect them, if they respected him, and his customs.
It was rumored that he allowed Gorions Ward into his village, so long as he treated the deep gnomes and their practices with respect.
