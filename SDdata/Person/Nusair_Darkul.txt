'''Nusair Darkul''' was a [[Red Wizard]]. He spied on [[Samas Kul]] at the [[Guild of Foreign Trade]] for the [[zulkir]] [[Nevron]]. In {{yearlink|1372}}, he was slain by a dragon summoned by ''[[the Scalamagdrion]]'', which his apprentice [[Saura Umakra]] had brought him from [[Skuld]].

==Description==
Nusair was tall, thin, handsome, and strong; his head was shaved and decorated with tattoos. He often wore robes of red Shou silk, and black boots.

==Personality==
Like many Red Wizards, Nusair Darkul was scheming and duplicitous, toadying to his superiors for favor. The mage also rather enjoyed choking his apprentice and lover, [[Saura Umakra]], as well as [[duergar]] ale, and all things [[dragon|draconic]]. He was unwilling to sponsor her into the ranks, considering her [[Rashemi]] ascendance made her a promotion into the ranks of Red Wizards a politically dangerous nonstarter.

==Abilities==
Nusair knew one spell that would strike a close foe in hellish fire, possibly ''[[firebrand]]''.The reasoning for this tentative attribution is that the spell is assumed to be intended for close combat, and thus cannot be a ''fireball''.

==Possessions==
He carried a magical ring, possibly a ''[[ring of spell storing]]'', which held a ''[[ball lightning]]'' spell.

==Activities==
Nusair Darkul was embedded in the [[Guild of Foreign Trade]] as [[Nevron]]'s spy on [[Samas Kul]]. He also sometimes financied expeditions in search of draconic artifacts.

==Relationships==
Nevron was his true master, though he nominally worked for Samas Kul. He had an apprentice, Saura Umakra, who was also his lover.

==History==
Before {{yearlink|1372}}, Nusair Darkul was a spy for [[Nevron]] in the [[Guild of Foreign Trade]] in [[Bezantur]].

In mid-Hammer of that year, he revealed to the [[zulkir]] Nevron that he had discovered the location of ''[[the Scalamagdrion]]'', seeking to curry favor with the man. He sent his apprentice, Saura Umakra, to retrieve the tome from Skuld; the wizard promised her that she could become a red wizard if she acquired it for him.

She returned no less than five days later with the Scalamagdrion, and the mage reneged in his promise. That evening, Nusair opened the tome, and a guardian emerged, attacking him; after a short fight, the wizard was slain.

==Rumours & Legends==
The searches for draconic artifacts that he financied were often the subject of rumours and jokes.
