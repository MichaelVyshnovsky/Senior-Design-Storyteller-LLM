Ingeloakastimizilian, also known as Icingdeath, was a white dragon who lived in a region of the Reghed Glacier known as Evermelt in Icewind Dale.
He spent most of his time sleeping on a bed of ice that covered his hoard.
Icingdeath was killed by Drizzt DoUrden and Wulfgar on Eleasis 26 in the , after Wulfgar threw his warhammer Aegis-fang into an icicle that fell and impaled the dragon in the heart. They slew Icingdeath so Wulfgar could fulfill the unfinished quest of his father Beornegar, and claim a trophy that would enable him to challenge the leader of his tribe to a duel. The dragons horns served as this trophy.
Ingeloakastimizilians nickname came to be attached to one of Drizzt DoUrdens scimitars, Icingdeath, which he found in the dragons hoard.
Even a century after he was slain, Icingdeaths frozen corpse remained within his lair in Evermelt. It became a site of veneration by cultists of Auril led by Bjami Tengervaald, who worshiped them as a manifestation of their goddess. Eventually, the Ice Witch Hedrun Arnsfirth directed her simulacrum to animate Icingdeaths remains as an undead, skeletal dragon to fight off a band of adventurers within Evermelt.
