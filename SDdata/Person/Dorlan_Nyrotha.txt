Dorlan Nyrotha was Thosters first mate aboard the Green Siren during the late 14 century DR.
He was a hulking man. He was often barefoot.
He thought the crew was not very tough, and would not disguise his scorn for fools.
Those who defied him were sometimes keelhauled.
His captain, Thoster, considered him someone to whom Japheth could direct talk of ghosts.
In , he was the first mate aboard Thosters ship.
When he woke up, they were under attack near the hidden island of Hegruth by the forces of the kraken Gethshemeth. The forces of the kraken struck at them as they met with Nogah, a rebel kuo-toa whip who was the krakens enemy. The pirate rallied the crew during the battle, personally slaying at least one enemy kuo-toa.
Some time later, while accompanying Nogah in her attempt to wrest the Dreamheart back from the kraken Gethshemeth, Nyrotha was slain by an ooze.
