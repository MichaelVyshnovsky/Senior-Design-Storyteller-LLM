'''Benji Sadira''' was a simple innkeeper living in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|21}}

==Activities==
Benji's inn, the [[House of Safe Rest]], lived up to its name since it was one of the safest places to stay within the often treacherous [[Harbor District]].
