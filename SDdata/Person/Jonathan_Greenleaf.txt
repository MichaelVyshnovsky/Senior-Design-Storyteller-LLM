Jonathan Greenleaf was a mage, and a chef extraordinaire, who researched the school of foodomancy in the late 14 century DR.
Jonathan was a talented scholar who rediscovered the ancient art of foodomancy. He found some of his magical culinary creations in the ancient tome called the Manual of Culinary Delights. Some of the foodomancy formulas and directions recorded by Chef Greenleaf included dragonblood soup and basilisk and bread. His work and research were compiled in a hand-written leather-bound tome, and experimentation and research continued after the book was published. A copy of Jonathan Greenleafs work found its way into the hands of Lord Raventree in the late 14 century DR, and after finishing reading the book, Lord sought to hire Jonathan as one of his cooks.
