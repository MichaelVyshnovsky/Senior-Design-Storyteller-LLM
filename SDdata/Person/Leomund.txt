'''Leomund''' was an otherworldly [[mage]], who created several famous [[spell]]s, mostly associated with sheltering.<ref name=TM28/> 

==Description==
Leomund originated from [[Oerth]].<ref name=TM28/> Because travel between planes was common among higher-level magic users, his spells eventually found their way to [[Toril]].<ref name=TM28/><ref> They were considered rare in the sense that apprentices were normally not taught these spells, yet the spells where widely known, at least by their name.<ref name=TM28/>

The following spells were attributed to Leomund: ''[[Leomund's arena]]'',<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/The Roundup|4}} ''Leomund's billet'',<ref> ''Leomund's hidden lodge'',<ref name=WSC2-499-502 /> ''[[Leomund's lamentable belabourment]]'', ''Leomund's spacious carriage'',<ref> ''[[Leomund's tiny hut]]'',<ref name=WSC2-499-502/>
