Leomund was an otherworldly mage, who created several famous spells, mostly associated with sheltering. 
Leomund originated from Oerth. Because travel between planes was common among higher-level magic users, his spells eventually found their way to Toril. They were considered rare in the sense that apprentices were normally not taught these spells, yet the spells where widely known, at least by their name.
The following spells were attributed to Leomund Leomunds arena, Leomunds billet, Leomunds hidden lodge, Leomunds lamentable belabourment, Leomunds spacious carriage, Leomunds tiny hut,
