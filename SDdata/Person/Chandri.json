        "mainbody": "Chandri was a Sel√ªnite priestess and the chief healer of Moonshadow Hall in Yhaunn during the 14 century DR.\nChandri organized the infirmary of the temple and provided healing for those who required it, using mundane healing supplies, alchemical potions, and divine healing magic. Unknown to Chandri, Velsinore sourced many of her medications from the Sharran priest and alchemist Bolan.\nBy 1373 DR, Chandri served under High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar and, in Eleasis of that year, she served under Moonmistress-Designate Feena Archwood during her brief tenure at the temple. When Dhauna forced Feena to infect her with lycanthropy, Chandri healed Dhaunas wounds and attempted to administer belladonna to counteract the curse. Dhauna refused to take the treatment and used lunar magic to forcibly transform into a werewolf, so Chandri and the others locked their former leader in a secure cell, though not before the werewolf destroyed much of the infirmary.\nIn the investigation that followed, Chandri assisted Velsinore in examining the records in the archives that Dhauna had accessed. Following Feenas uncovering of Velsinore as a heretic before the temple, Velsinore inflicted a deadly wound on Mifano as a distraction, and Chandri saved his life with her healing magic."
