        "mainbody": "'''Lurgan''' was a [[duergar]] member of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Lurgan had gray skin and a closely-trimmed beard. He wore a [[chainmail]] and a [[helmet]] with the [[holy symbol]] of the absolute dangling around his neck.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lurgan accompanied slaver [[Gekh Coal]] and his duergar to a decrepit coastal village in the [[Underdark]] that once was a [[deep gnome]] colony. On the behest of the Absolute, duergar held the ruined village to be used as a skiff port to transport goods and slaves to the [[Grymforge]]. With the events of the [[Absolute crisis]] unfolding, Lurgan and his fellow duergar could have faced several fates; they could've been confronted by and slain by the [[Absolute Adversaries]] as they sought passage to the Grymforge or as a favor to an aspiring [[myconid]] sovereign [[Glut]]."
