        "mainbody": "Captain Vertucio was a member of the Order of the Sapphire Crescent, the Church of Waukeens personal mercenary army, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nVertucio was a strict commander, fully loyal to the Order and the Church of Waukeen. Even though he was quite fond of Vambran Matrell, he did not allow disobedience.\nBy the , Captain Vertucio was the commanding officer of Vambran Matrell of the noble merchant House Matrell of Arrabar. Vambrans troops, his two friends, Sergeants Adyan Mercatio and Horial Rohden, as well as their trade vessel the Ladys Favor, were under Captain Vertucios command. On Tarsakh 13 of 1373 DR, Captain Vertucio was ordered to deploy the entire army of the Sapphire Crescent under orders from the Temple of Waukeens Grand Trabbar Lavant. Captain Vertucio turned down Vambran Matrells requests for personal time despite several requests and the grand celebration of his sisters sixteenth birthday. The deployment orders came as a way of stopping Vambrans investigation into Lavants corruption and his sneak coin cabals illicit activities.\nTo the lieutenants surprise, he was offered an excuse to delay the deployment under a false pretense. Grolo Firefist covered for Vambran as he attended his sisters birthday celebration, where the cabals plot rapidly unfolded. As Vambran was gone for a suspiciously long time, Captain Vertucio dispatched a squad of Crescents to rein him in. Unwittingly, the mercenaries aided the ensued struggle. As a result, Vambran Matrell received a disciplinary rebuke from Vertucio. A punishment in symbol only."
