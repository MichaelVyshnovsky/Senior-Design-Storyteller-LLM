Caliph '''Abir al-Farhan''', also called the '''Humble Servant of the Enlightened Gods''', was the ruler of [[Hilm]] in the [[Pantheist League]] of [[interior Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Personality==
Abir represented the best traits of the Pantheist League. He was considerate and genuinely cared about the well-being of his subjects. He was truly a fitting ruler for the "City of Kindness."

==Description==
Abir was a short man with a large stomach. His physical appearance contradicted his impressive resolve at protecting his subjects.

==Activities==
As a tireless protector of [[Pantheist Enlightenment]] the caliph cared for every one of his subjects. He even went so far as to see to the needs of even the poorest among the residents of Hilm. The caliph and his vizier would often magically disguise themselves and mingle among the common citizens of Hilm to gain a true understanding of what the people really wanted or needed.

==Relationships==
Caliph Abir's eldest daughter was [[Ola al-Farhan|Ola]].
