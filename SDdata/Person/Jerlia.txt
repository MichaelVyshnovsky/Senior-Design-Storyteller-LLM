'''Jerlia''' was an ore merchant from the City of Coin, [[Athkatla]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Get on with ya, I don't deal with individuals. Bulk ore is what I sells. You need a few pebbles, you go scrounge it yourself.''|Jerlia}}

==Description==
Jerlia was [[human]] woman with pale skin and white hair. She wore a set of [[plate armor]] and carried a hefty [[war hammer]].

==History==
Jerlia's stall could be found in Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Center District|Center District]] – [[Waukeen's Promenade]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. That year, the famed Athkatlan sculptor Sir [[Sarles]] sought pure [[illithium]] ore for a piece commissioned by the [[Church of Helm]]. Jerlia was the only ore merchant in Athkatla at the time who had access to the elusive material. Despite Sir Sarles's demands, Jerlia could only get her hands on up to 50 pounds (23 kilograms) of illithium ore per season through a duergar merchant, [[Unger Hilldark]], operating out of the [[Copper Coronet]].
