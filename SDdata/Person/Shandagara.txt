Shandagara was a human woman and a pirate operating on the Sea of Fallen Stars in central Faerûn.
In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR, Shandagara disappeared, leaving her treasure-laden ship abandoned in the Vilhon Reach. The likely explanation was that some magic had whisked her away.
After mid-autumn of that year, traders spotted a human warrior woman of similar manner fighting alongside the dwarves of Earthfast, and some speculated that this was Shandagara. However, she later turned out to be another woman.
As a so-called pirate "queen", Shandagara acted like it and had a hot temper.
