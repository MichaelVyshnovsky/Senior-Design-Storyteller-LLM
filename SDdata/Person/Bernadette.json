        "mainbody": "Bernadette was an abjurer and a member of the Arcane Brotherhood who was imprisoned by the barber Jooge Nopsmoth in Silverymoon.\nBernadette had light skin and brown hair, and wore spectacles. She was clad in a blue robe and blue pointy hat.\nAlthough able to cast lesser spells at will, Bernadette relied on her spellbook for most of her magical arsenal.\nWhile getting her hair curled by Jooge Nopsmoth, Bernadette was kidnapped by the barber and placed in an oubliette beneath Jooges shop. Under duress, she helped Jooge construct the Prismatic Coloring Machine, a device that used extradimensional energies to color hair and cause a wide range of curious side effects."
