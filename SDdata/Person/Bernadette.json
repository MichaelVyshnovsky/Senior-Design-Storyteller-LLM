She was clad in a blue robe and blue pointy hat.\nAlthough able to cast lesser spells at will, Bernadette relied on her spellbook for most of her magical arsenal.\nWhile getting her hair curled by Jooge Nopsmoth, Bernadette was kidnapped by the barber and placed in an oubliette beneath Jooges shop.
