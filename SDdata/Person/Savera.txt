Savera was a yochlol in SildÃ«yuir in 1372 DR.
Savera was one of the many handmaidens of Lolth. In 1372 DR, the goddess sent Savera to learn the secret of the Night Realm in order to teach them to the drow. Savera, posing as a male half-orc using her hat of disguise and with a retinue of taers, infiltrated the mercenary army gathered by the nilshai sorcerer Tolgbyri. Thanks to her disguise, she took Tolgbyri by surprise, killing it.
Afterward, Savera took control of the group and started searching inside the libraries of the citadel for the secrets wanted by Lolth. However, she could not find the portal key used by the nilshai and Mourel Duskwalker.
