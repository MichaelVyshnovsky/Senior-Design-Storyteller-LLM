'''Corkitron "High-Roll" Allinamuck''' was a [[halfling]] [[thief]] and a member of the [[adventuring company]] known as [[Halfling Inc.]]

{{Quote|There's always been [[dragon]]s, and there's always going to be dragons, that's what I think. You want to know any more, why don't you ask the darned dragons?|''A tirade on the origins of dragons by an inebriated Corkitron, [[1357 DR]].''<ref>}}

==Nicknames==
Corkitron chose both his first and last names for himself (his parents were actually named '''Burrows'''). He also went by the diminutive '''Corky'''.

The name '''High-Roll''' came from his trick of rolling [[dice]] for treasure, proclaiming "High roll gets it!" If the others agreed to such a deal, then he simply took what he wanted as his share regardless of the dice. After all, they did agree that "High Roll" would get it.
