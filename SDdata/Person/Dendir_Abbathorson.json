        "mainbody": "'''Dendir Abbathorson''' was a [[dwarf]] [[adventurer]] and [[thief]] who was part of the [[Ruby Blades]] [[adventuring company]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Dendir was a nasty, grumpy, and bitter man who was focused entirely on the pursuit of wealth, as befitting his worship of [[Abbathor]]. He was particularly fascinated by the mechanisms of locks and traps.",
        "Possessions": "Dendir wielded a ''+4 [[Shortsword]]'', and wore a leather ''[[belt of defense]]''. He carried a ''large [[bag of holding]]'' along with his [[thieves' tools]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Ruby Blades joined the [[Wolfmasters]] company on an excursion to explore and loot [[Orvaskyte Keep]] in the [[Vast Swamp]]. The Ruby Blades were heavily delayed, and by the time they arrived their allies were already dead. Seeking a new goal, they attempted to hunt a nearby [[black dragon]], only to be overwhelmed and almost killed by it, and were rescued by a band of [[Cormyr]]ean adventurers. Their fortune waxed once more, and they were joined by two-dozen mercenaries that allowed them to chase away the Cormyreans and secure what was left of Orvaskyte Keep."
