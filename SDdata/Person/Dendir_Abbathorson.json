        "mainbody": "Dendir Abbathorson was a dwarf adventurer and thief who was part of the Ruby Blades adventuring company in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nDendir was a nasty, grumpy, and bitter man who was focused entirely on the pursuit of wealth, as befitting his worship of Abbathor. He was particularly fascinated by the mechanisms of locks and traps.\nDendir wielded a +4 Shortsword, and wore a leather belt of defense. He carried a large bag of holding along with his thieves tools.\nIn the , the Ruby Blades joined the Wolfmasters company on an excursion to explore and loot Orvaskyte Keep in the Vast Swamp. The Ruby Blades were heavily delayed, and by the time they arrived their allies were already dead. Seeking a new goal, they attempted to hunt a nearby black dragon, only to be overwhelmed and almost killed by it, and were rescued by a band of Cormyrean adventurers. Their fortune waxed once more, and they were joined by two-dozen mercenaries that allowed them to chase away the Cormyreans and secure what was left of Orvaskyte Keep."
