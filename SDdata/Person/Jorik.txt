'''Jorik''' was a [[human]] who owned the [[Weeping Willow Inn]] near the [[Mere of Dead Men]] on the [[Sword Coast North]].

==History==
Jorik came to the Mere of Dead Men and found a lone building. He discovered it had once been part of a village that had been destroyed by the [[King of Shadows]], so he re-established it as a tavern.

When the [[Kalach-Cha]] and [[Khelgar Ironfist]] came to the inn in [[1374 DR]], Jorik asked them to defeat the invaders and if they did he would trade with them and give information about [[Neverwinter]].
