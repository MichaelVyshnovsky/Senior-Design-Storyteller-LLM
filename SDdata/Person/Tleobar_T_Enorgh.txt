'''Tleobar T'Enorgh''' was a former [[drow]] adventuress from the [[Forest of Mir]], the chosen guardian of the drow settlement of [[Dallnothax]], and an agent of the [[Twisted Rune]].

==Relationships==
Tleobar was married to [[Raaghar T'Enorgh]], the ruler of Dallnothax and a [[Cleric|priest]] of [[Vhaeraun]]. Together, they worked as key agents for the Twisted Rune.

She despised the [[Company of Eight]] and especially their leader [[Sylvanus Moondrop]], and had taken a vow to slay each one of them. She planned to drop Sylvanus into the [[Spiders' Maw]], a deep rift below Dallnothax. 

==History==
Around [[1343 DR]], Sylvanus Moondrop led a band of [[Elf|elves]] from the [[Forest of Tethir]] and [[Shilmista]] to assault [[Allsihwann]], the drow surface enclave where Tleobar lived and utterly destroyed it.<ref group="note" name="note1" />

In [[1355 DR]], Tleobar was an adventuress, and her party was questing in the Forest of Tethir with the intent to slay and rob the [[gold dragon]] [[Garlokantha]] when they were attacked by the [[Company of Eight]]. Garlokantha was saved and all of Tleobar's adventuring companions were killed; she was the only survivor. It was then that she recognized Sylvanus Moondrop as the same elf who had led the attack on her former home.

Every ten years, the drow enclaves of Dallnothax, [[Holldaybim]], and [[Iskasshyoll]] chose guardians to live on the surface above the settlements and grow accustomed to sunlight so that they could serve as a first line of defense for those cities. In [[1370 DR]], Tleobar was the selected guard for Dallnothax.
