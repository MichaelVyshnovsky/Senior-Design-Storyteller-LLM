'''Kiratha''', though she preferred '''Kira''', was an [[elf]] [[wizard]], former acolyte of [[Tymora]], and [[adventurer]] in [[Daggerford]] on the [[Sword Coast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/Floshin Family Tree}}

==Relationships==
Kiratha was the great-granddaughter of [[Elorfindar Floshin]] and the daughter of [[Alorel Torandrar]] and [[Nynendra Mrauthae]], so she had both [[gold elf]] and [[moon elf]] blood in her veins. Her younger sister was [[Rilathra]].

==History==
Kiratha was born in the {{yearlinkName|1279}} to a family dwelling in the forests of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]]. However, her father Alorel, consumed with rage and vengeance over the murder of his own father and the loss of his arm, was abusive to his family, often beating them and leaving them for dead. In the summer of the {{yearlinkName|1349}}, Kiratha finally ran away but Alorel hunted her down and caught her, and seemed set to kill her when her mother Nynendra intervened after she'd followed in secret. Nynendra confronted and fought with Alorel and Kiratha got away, while her mother was seemingly defeated and killed behind her (in fact, after Alorel ran into the [[High Forest]], never to be seen again, Rilathra saved Nynendra and the pair fled east).

Brokenhearted and believing her mother had been murdered by her father, Kiratha wandered the Sword Coast and its cities. She took work as a caravan guard, though at first she was only accepted because the human guards had amorous intentions for the attractive elf). Later, she served as an assistant to human wizards and even became an adventurer in one or another adventuring party. But she eventually grew weary of the life of violence, deceit, and ambition she saw in many of her fellow adventurers, and gave it up.

Thus, finally, Kiratha went to [[Daggerford]] in search of her family; she knew she had kin there, even if they were her father's. But no word of her mother and sister had come to Daggerford. Finding her great-grandfather Sir Elorfindar, she began training as a mage, learning from the mages serving him and even acquiring spells from his [[spellbook]]. 

By the late 1350s [[DR]], Kira was also an acolyte at [[Fairfortune Hall]], the shrine of Tymora in Daggerford, serving under [[Bando|Bando the Lame]]. She was his favorite acolyte and, when she joined the faith, he gifted her with [[dice]] that she would always keep with her.

''Circa'' [[1359 DR]], however, Kira was again living the life of an adventurer. She was with [[Maelwyn]]'s [[adventuring company]] for some years, alongside [[Aswansea]], [[Cork (Daggerford)|Cork]], and [[Garth (Daggerford)|Garth]]. She saved the group on many occasions with her spells and was likely the real reason they survived in the wilds.<ref>

By [[1370 DR]], Kira was a seasoned and respected mage of Daggerford.

==Abilities==
As a young mage, she knew the spells ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[jump]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', and ''[[shield]]''. In addition to her arcane [[magic]], Kira was trained in the use of [[staff]] and [[mace]].

==Residence==
''Circa'' 1370 DR, her house was located along [[Rogar Alley]] in western Daggerford near the [[Caravan Gate]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}<ref>
