'''Zeltoon Saan''' was a proud [[Thay]]an [[Red Wizards|Red Wizard]] proprietor of [[magic item]]s in the city of [[Hillsfar]] ''circa'' [[1373 DR]].
{{quote|''...Still, war is always good for trade. I only pray that Hillsfar opens its gates before spring. The slaves—that is to say, my family back in Thay—surely await my homecoming with touching eagerness. Between the invigorating cold and the refreshingly rustic...ignorant...stupid...people...of this fine land. I could hardly be happier. Yes, indeed.''|Red Wizard Zeltoon Saan, dripping with sarcasm.}}

==Description==
Zeltoon was a tall, well-built, dusky-skinned individual with a shaved head and proudly displayed scalp [[tattoo]]s, as was typical for the mages of Thay.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Zeltoon Saan opened a stall selling wondrous trinkets and enchanted items from the land of [[Thay]]. He was one of the very few outsiders allowed in the city during the raging [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] crisis in the late fall of that year. The Red Wizard could be found in Hillsfar's market plaza, where he quickly developed an antagonistic attitude toward a recent arrival and a fellow trader, [[Branon Oakheart]] of [[Silvanus]]. Zeltoon eyed and engaged prospective customers who appeared to have enough [[coin]] to purchase his exotic wares. Despite being a Red Wizard, Saan knew very little of the Order of the Crippled Fang, apart from the fact that it originated or had some connection to [[Zhentil Keep]]. He welcomed war as it was good for his business.
