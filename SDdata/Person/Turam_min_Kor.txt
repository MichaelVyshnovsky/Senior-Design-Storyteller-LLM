'''Turam min Kor''' was a priest of the [[Golden Mosque]] in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|71}}

==Activities==
Though Imam [[Renn min Zann]] held the title of Keeper of the Mosques, Turam shared much of the workload. He selected who would be allowed to preach within the Golden Mosque on a daily basis. He tried to be fair in his selections and anyone who was turned down six days in a row would be allowed to preach on the seventh day should they return.
