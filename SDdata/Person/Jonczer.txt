Jonczer was one of the apprentices of Lady Maerjanthra Shalace in the mid-14 century DR.
Jonczer worked under Maerjanthra Shalace, the jeweler.
His fellow apprentices included Goraun, Rivrel, Tantheld and Rorgel.
Jonczer was one of Maerjanthra Shalaces apprentices while she was alive. He was working under her since at least approximately the , the birth of Narnra Shalace, who was twenty or twenty-two years old in the . At that time, he was told of Maerjanthras plot to bear Elminster Aumar a child, on which she was aided by Khelben Arunsun, who under duress from Mystra gave her a potion to override Elminsters control over his own fertility, as accounted by his fellow apprentice, Goraun.
Shortly after Maerjanthras death, Jonczer disappeared after a break-in killed his fellow apprentice Rorgel. Narnra assumed Jonczer was dead, though she saw a lot of blood and never actually spotted the body.
