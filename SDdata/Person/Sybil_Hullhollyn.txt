Lady '''Sybil Hullhollyn''' was a [[patriar]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Sybil Hullhollyn was a delicate fair-skinned lady with a [[swan]] neck and dark hair. Her face was colored with a gentle blush.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a portrait of Sybil Hullhollyn painted by [[Oskar Fevras]] was kept in the attic of the [[Jannath estate]] of Baldur's Gate. That year, it became possessed by wailing [[poltergeist]] unwittingly summoned by the painter. Other copies of the painting were seen across the city, simply titled as the ''[[Portrait of a Woman]]''.
