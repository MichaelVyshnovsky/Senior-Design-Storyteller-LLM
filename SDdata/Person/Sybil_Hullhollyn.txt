Lady Sybil Hullhollyn was a patriar of Baldurs Gate sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.
Sybil Hullhollyn was a delicate fair-skinned lady with a swan neck and dark hair. Her face was colored with a gentle blush.
In the , a portrait of Sybil Hullhollyn painted by Oskar Fevras was kept in the attic of the Jannath estate of Baldurs Gate. That year, it became possessed by wailing poltergeist unwittingly summoned by the painter. Other copies of the painting were seen across the city, simply titled as the Portrait of a Woman.
