        "mainbody": "Moesko was an anchorite of Talos who maintained the lighthouse and the shrine to Talos at the Tower of Storms in the late 15 century DR.\nHe had linked himself to the Tower of Storms by invoking a ritual that transformed his own heart into the beacon. The sickly light his heart emanated bewitched passing ships, and lured them to the Tower to either crash on the rocks or get stuck on a nearby beach.\nMoesko was confident and cruel. He had great faith in his abilities in combat, and had no patience for anyone who questioned him or failed to obey his commands.\nLike other anchorites of Talos, Moesko had two formidable gifts Talos had given him spells, including the ability to hurl lightning bolts, and he was a shapechanger who could adopt the form of a boar. Uniquely, however, Moeskos connection to the beacon at the Tower of Storms meant that he could not be killed conventionally as long as his heart was intact. If he was slain, his body would simply reform beside his heart the next day.\nMoesko wore clawed gauntlets His favorite treasure was an opalescent conch shell, which was a spell focus he had taken from the sea elf Miraal when he murdered her outside the Tower of Storms.\nThe Tower of Storms came under the control of the anchorites of Talos sometime in the late 15 century DR, and by the time the white dragon Cryovain began terrorizing the region, it had been secretly converted into a temple to Talos with Moeskos heart serving as the beacon. Soon, no less than five ships had crashed upon the rocks, lured by the beacons green light.\nMoeskos role at the lighthouse was in service to the Cult of Talos, who plundered the ships that he caused to run aground. This included a death knight-dreadnaught belonging to the necromancer Ularan Mortus, starting a war between the Cult of Talos and Mortuss cult of Myrkul."
