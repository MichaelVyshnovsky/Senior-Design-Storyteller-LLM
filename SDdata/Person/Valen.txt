'''Valen''' was a [[thief]] turned [[vampire]] who served [[Bodhi]] who led the vampire coved in [[Athkatla]], the City of Coin, in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Valen was a mortal woman and a thief who served Bodhi as a messenger and carried out her will during the day. She was the first member of Bodhi's vampire coven to approach [[Abdel Adrian]] as he was collecting a huge sum of money to pay the vampires' bitter enemies â€“ the [[Shadow Thieves]]. Valen offered the Bhaalsawn a meeting with Bodhi, who had a counteroffer: the same information Gorion's Ward was looking for but for 5,000 [[gold]] [[coin]]s cheaper. She let Abdel know that the offer had a limited shelf life and disappeared into the Athkatlan crowd.

Subsequently, Valen was turned into a vampire herself and sent to assassinate Abdel Adrian on the isle of [[Brynnlaw]], along with fellow bloodsuckers [[Parisa]] and [[Del (vampire)|Del]]. The trio was unsuccessful, and the Bhaalspawn slew the vampires. Being undead, vampires could only be destroyed in their coffins, so Valen survived the defeat in her ''[[gaseous form]]''. Finally, Abdel Adrian confronted Valen once again when he and his companions stormed Bodhi's nest underneath Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Grave District|Grave District]]. Valen, along with every other vampire in the den, was believed to have been destroyed by the adventurers.
