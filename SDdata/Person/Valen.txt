Valen was a thief turned vampire who served Bodhi who led the vampire coved in Athkatla, the City of Coin, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Valen was a mortal woman and a thief who served Bodhi as a messenger and carried out her will during the day. She was the first member of Bodhis vampire coven to approach Abdel Adrian as he was collecting a huge sum of money to pay the vampires bitter enemies â€“ the Shadow Thieves. Valen offered the Bhaalsawn a meeting with Bodhi, who had a counteroffer the same information Gorions Ward was looking for but for 5,000 gold coins cheaper. She let Abdel know that the offer had a limited shelf life and disappeared into the Athkatlan crowd.
Subsequently, Valen was turned into a vampire herself and sent to assassinate Abdel Adrian on the isle of Brynnlaw, along with fellow bloodsuckers Parisa and Del. The trio was unsuccessful, and the Bhaalspawn slew the vampires. Being undead, vampires could only be destroyed in their coffins, so Valen survived the defeat in her gaseous form. Finally, Abdel Adrian confronted Valen once again when he and his companions stormed Bodhis nest underneath Athkatlas Grave District. Valen, along with every other vampire in the den, was believed to have been destroyed by the adventurers.
