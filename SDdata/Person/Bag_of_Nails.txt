Bag of Nails was a tabaxi that lived in Chult during the late 15 century DR. As of the year of the death curse, he dwelled within an abandoned building in the lost city of Omu.
He came to Omu to find a fabled treasure called the Navel of the Moon. He hoped to use its alleged powers to find his lost son, but he eventually gave up hope of ever finding it. 
In his older years, Bag of Nails wished to receive a death worthy of a hunter. In truth he had lost his mind to senility and began seeing every individual he met as his quarry.
He was in the possession of the poison known as midnight tears
At some time, Bag of Nails traveled to Omu in order to find the artifact known as the Navel of the Moon, in the hopes that it would allow him to find his long-lost son. After a long search, he gave up hope on his quest.
