'''Druth Daern''' was a [[lich]] in [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].

==History==
During the [[Weeping War]], Druth was a [[human]] archmage living in Myth Drannor. He was prepared to turn himself into a lich when the city fell to the [[Army of Darkness]]. He hid and later sacked the ruined city of many [[magic item]]s. Later, Druth cast the spell to became a lich but somehow the ''[[mythal]]'' influenced his transformation, granting him more powers than was usual for a lich.

From that day, he fought [[baatezu]] and [[alhoon]] for control of the city.
  
==Activities==
Druth directed an army of [[skeleton]]s and [[zombie]]s.

==Powers==
Druth's unique power was that, after the destruction of his body, he could possess any kind of [[undead]] to become his new host, giving him a virtually infinite possibility for resurrection. His [[phylactery]] was keep safe far from Myth Drannor. He was also protected from the [[psionic]] attacks of the alhoon by his insane mind.
