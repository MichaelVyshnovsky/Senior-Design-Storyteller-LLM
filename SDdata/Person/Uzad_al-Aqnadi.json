        "mainbody": "Uzad al-Aqnadi was a holy slayer of the Flamedeath Fellowship who was in charge of internal security at Krak al-Niraan in 1367 DR.\nLike most holy slayers, Uzad was a fanatic. He believed his service at Krak al-Niraan would spread the influence of Kossuth throughout Zakhara.\nUzad was a master of his chosen weaponâ€”the tufenk, and skilled in the use of liquid star.\nUzads tufenk was custom-fitted with a firestarter. Uzad also owned a ring of invisibility, a magical scimitar, some bracers of defense, and always carried several smoke spheres and star pots."
