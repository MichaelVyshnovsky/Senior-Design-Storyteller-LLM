Captain Haegan was a slaver who lived in the Amnian city of Athkatla during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Haegan and his fellow slavers operated a stockade in the slums of Athkatlas River District. They carried out their operations in a building that appeared to be a converted sailing ship, located across the street from the Copper Coronet tavern.
Captain Haegan wore a suit of enchanted +1 studded leather armor and a simple horned helmet. He armed himself with a two-handed sword and throwing axes. Among other things, Haegan carried potions of extra healing and a potion of frost giant strength.
He was in possession of a key that opened every cell within the subterranean slavers stockade.
Captain Haegan operated out of Athkatla circa the  and slavers under his command were red-robed wizard, priests of Cyric, and yuan-ti. His stock was auctioned off in the black market backrooms of the Copper Coronet. Haegan slaves were captured as far as the town of Scornubel, and a group was captured from there in 1369 DR for a buyer from Calimport. A young girl was among the captured humans. The entire group was bound to be executed after the buyer decided to abandon the order, and the slaves were deemed worthless. Abdel Adrian and his companions may have ruined the illegal slaving operations, freeing the young girl and other captives, slaying Haegan in the process.
