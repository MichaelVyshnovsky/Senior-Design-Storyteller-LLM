'''Zinaida''' was a [[half-orcish]] blacksmith for hire from the city of [[Neverwinter]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Unlike many half-orcs, Zinaida did not subscribe to being unnoticed to avoid harassment and discrimination. Instead, she elected to become a master blacksmith, better than most of her peers by the late 15{{th}} century DR.
