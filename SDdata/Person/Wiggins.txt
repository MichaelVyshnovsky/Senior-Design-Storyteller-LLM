'''Wiggins the Undead Intern''' was an intern who was worked to death and returned as an [[undead]] from the city of [[Neverwinter]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime before the late 15{{th}} century DR, Wiggin died while working with no pay from an ungrateful employer. He returned to unlife in the undead state and vowed to fight for all employees in Neverwinter to have "competitive pay, a decent medical plan, and mandatory break times." Wiggins could be ''[[summon]]ed'' by some adventurers to aid them in their tasks.
