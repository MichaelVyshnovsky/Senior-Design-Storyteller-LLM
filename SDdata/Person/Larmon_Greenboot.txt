'''Larmon Greenboot''' was a shepherd in [[Red Larch]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Activities==
Larmon led his sheep to graze in the [[Sumber Hills]].

==History==
During a trip to the Hills in [[1491 DR]], Larmon noticed some mysterious freshly dug graves. Greatly shocked, he told the story many times at [[Marlandro Gaelkur]]'s barbershop. Some adventurers hired to find a missing diplomatic delegation from [[Mirabar]] listened in and, checking the area, discovered the corpses of some members of the delegation and an Elemental Evil cultist.
