'''Bwimb''', called the '''Baron of Ooze''', was the first evil [[archomental]] of the [[Paraelemental Plane of Ooze]].<ref> He was slain by Orcus-as-Tenebrous and succeeded as archomental by [[Bwimb II]].
{{quote
|Baron of Ooze indeed. He disgusted me. He did nothing but beg for his life. It was a pleasure to kill him. The multiverse is better off without such weaklings.

The good archomental [[Ben-hadar]] considered Bwimb one of his biggest annoyances because of Bwimb polluting pure waters.<ref>{{Cite dragon/353/Princes of Elemental Good|45}}

===Allies===
In life, Bwimb was an ally of [[Ghaunadaur]].<ref>

==History==
It was said that Bwimb was a great and cruel general in the Age Before Ages. That he, like several other evil archomentals, fought in the great war between Law and Chaos as an ally of the [[Queen of Chaos]], against the [[Wind Dukes of Aaqa]].{{Cite dungeon/129/A Gathering of Winds|47}} It was also said that he invaded [[Astral Sea]] once, in the form of an ocean of acid, but was defeated by the deity Kord. The ruined body of the Ooze Lord fell into the natural world as a rain of acid.<ref>

He was summoned to the world of [[Oerth]] at least once, for he was known there as '''Nakimas''' to a civilization called the Suel, and was called the '''Mud Lord'''.{{Cite dragon/304/Places of Mystery|90}}

Though according to others, Bwimb only became ruler of the Paraelemental Plane of Ooze because no-one else cared to challenge him, and that he was not truly an archomental.<ref><ref> This was disputed by certain writings that did name him a true archomental.

Bwimb was one of several powerful planar entities slain by [[Orcus|Tenebrous]]. In a mistaken belief that Bwimb was in possession of the ''[[Wand of Orcus]]'', the [[undead]] [[demon prince]] gladly slew Bwimb, whom he had nothing but disdain for when the archomental allegedly did nothing but beg for his life during interrogation.<ref><ref>{{Cite dragon/417/History Check: The Shadow that Was|13}}

His daughter and successor as archomental of Ooze, Bwimb II, was thought to have formed from his remains after his murder.
