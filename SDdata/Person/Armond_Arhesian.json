        "mainbody": "'''Armond Arhesian''' was a reporter who wrote for the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' [[broadsheet]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Armond Arhesian most notable article was published in [[Uktar]]-[[Nightal]] of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}{{LCRB}}. The reporter interviewed Ambassador [[Belakira]] from [[Thay]] regarding her complaint against the adventurers of Ravens Bluff. Armond listed the accusations' specifics and reported on the Ambassador placing the blame on a new lord in the City of Ravens, [[Lorien Darkarrow]]. He also stated that the accusations had little evidence and were on shaky ground at best. Lastly, Armond Arhesian stated that [[Mayor Thoden]] interviewed the young lord. He had an alibi. Darkarrow was allegedly hurt by a [[black dragon]]'s acid and sharp teeth, but his bodily wounds were the proof. According to the ''Trumpeter'', Sir [[Voltroy]] of [[Lathander]] was tasked by Mayor Thoden with casting healing [[spell]]s on the crippled Lord."
