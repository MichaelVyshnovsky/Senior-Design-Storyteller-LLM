Queen Hledh Hellspawn was a fiendish fire giant who ruled the city of Maerimydra in the Deep Wastes in the late 15 century DR.
She was an enormous demonic fire giantess with six fingers on each hand.
Fearsome and commanding, Hledh was considered a capable enough leader to have numerous demons serving her.
Powerful and huge even for a fire giant, Hledhs demonic heritage granted her even greater powers that she could pass on to others of her kind. She could conjure a globe of darkness and was immune to all poisons.
Hledh was descended, via the half-fiend fire giant Kurgoth Hellspawn, from Grazzt the Dark Prince. She considered the demon lord to be her master and readily carried out his wishes.
At some prior to 1372 DR, Kurgoth Hellspawn sired Hledh  Eventually, she supplanted Kurgoth as the leader of the demons and fire giants of Maerimydra.
By 1479 DR, Hledh was considered the Queen of the Burning City and had rebuilt much of the former drow settlement to suit its giant-sized inhabitants.
Circa 1486 DR, Hledh led a group of fire giants in an attack on Szith Morcane and left one of her lieutenants, Fydor, to manage the occupation.
Later, Hledh was at the Undying Temple assisting Grazzt and the vrock wizard Squallocks in the ritual to help Grazzt resist the Vizeran DeVirs spell to send the demon lords back to the Abyss.
