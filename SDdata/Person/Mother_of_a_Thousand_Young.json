        "mainbody": "The '''Mother of a Thousand Young''' was the mysterious leader of the [[spider katanga]] who allied with the malicious [[outsider]]s known as the [[Tamara (Malatra)|Tamara]]. She and her kin resided within the [[Fire Mountain]] on the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/An Army of One Thousand|2}}",
        "Description": "After becoming the Mother of a Thousand Young, her stomach area became bloated and distended with countless egg sacs. She was a monstrous creature who reveled in death and destruction, and her transformation left her ravenous for flesh. The spider katanga rarely spoke, but her speech was as venomous as her bite when she did.",
        "Abilities": "Despite her bloated appearance, the Mother was a powerful and agile spider katanga. Transformation into the Mother toughened her body similar to the ''[[barkskin]]'' spell, and she received resistance to [[magic]], as well as [[sorcerous]] abilities. Like other spider katanga, the Mother could climb walls with ease. She had a highly [[venom]]ous bite and could spit [[acid]] at her enemies.\n\nApart from being a powerful [[warrior]], the Mother could tap into [[divine]] and [[arcane]] magics. She always kept defensive spells active on herself, such as ''[[shield of faith]]'' and ''[[mage armor]]''.",
        "Possessions": "The Mother of a Thousand Young inhabited the area known as the nest within the spider katanga lair on the slopes of the [[Fire Mountain]]. The nest was a cold stone chamber filled with the stench of death and decay. The Mother's nest was a thick mess of webs and parts of her victims' bodies. She sat on a grand throne made out of her victims' skulls.{{Cite organized play/LJ/An Army of One Thousand|11}}\n\nThe Mother of a Thousand Young wielded a powerful [[enchanted]] item called the ''[[Runestick of the Tamara]]''. The item allowed a loyal servant of the extradimensional evil to have access to additional arcane spells, such as ''[[cat's grace]]'', ''[[endurance]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[haste]]'', and ''[[see invisibility]]''.",
        "History": "The Mother of a Thousand Young and her spider katanga subjects participated in the [[Battle of Blood Bridge]] in the Year of Tigers Return on the Malatran calendar. The evil katanga sought to bring the outsider creatures known as Tamara to the Living Jungle. The ceremony of the ''[[Blood Bridge]]'' allowed passage for some of the Tamara creatures to [[Toril]], but with the valorous battle, the ritual was stopped, yet the threat remained.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Come the Tiger|16}}\n\nA year later, in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Tribe of the Wise Ones]] became aware of a new looming threat. The leader of the dreaded spider katanga, the Mother of a Thousand Young, became swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles with ravenous spawn.<ref group=\"note\">It was unclear if the Mother of a Thousand Young who participated in the Battle of Blood Bridge was the same individual who returned a year later, as the name \"Mother of a Thousand Young\" was also a title, passed from one Mother to the next. The Mother of a Thousand Young who appeared in ''[[Come the Tiger]]'' was a [[cleric]]-[[fighter]], a total of 20 levels between two classes, while the Mother from ''[[An Army of One Thousand]]'' was a cleric-[[sorcerer]], with 16 levels in total. It is possible the first individual was replaced by a new Mother of a Thousand Young. However, that is speculation. The hunters of the Wise Ones discovered lands between the [[Rayana Savanna]] and the Fire Mountain [[poison]]ed by the Mother and her followers. Additionally to the poison, the Mother of a Thousand Young captured a group of hunters of the united Malatran tribes. In response, the Tribe of the Wise Ones assembled several groups of heroes from across the Living Jungle to rescue the missing individuals, stop the poison, and slay the Mother of a Thousand Young.{{Cite organized play/LJ/An Army of One Thousand|3}}\n\nHowever, even though the Mother of a Thousand Young's menace to the Living Jungle was a very real threat, the poison was released by [[Talunuku]], a spider katanga who lusted for the Mother's power. Talunuku started performing rituals to transform herself into the new Mother of a Thousand Young, rituals that were poisoning the jungle. Talunuku knew that the tribes would blame the Mother, and that was perfect for her plan. In order to become the new Mother of a Thousand Young, the current Mother needed to die. Talunuku found an unlikely ally in [[Nathani]], a hunter and traitor from the [[Huroola]] tribe.\n\nThe Mother of a Thousand Young was within her nest when the heroes of Malatra reached the spider katanga lair. The adventurers split into two groups, one of them headed straight for the Mother. She greeted the heroes with venomous spite and immediately ordered her two bodyguards, [[Taluku]] and [[Morizuku]], to slay the invaders. The outcome of the battle remained unclear as the poisoning was stopped, which could've been accomplished by slaying the Mother or by weakening her leadership and forcing her to flee once again.{{Cite organized play/LJ/An Army of One Thousand|13}}"
