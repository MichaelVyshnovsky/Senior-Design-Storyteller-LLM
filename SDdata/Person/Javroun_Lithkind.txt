Javroun Lithkind was a Chondathan sage inhabiting Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Javroun had a mustache that he would twist while speaking with clients.
He was a spiteful man who enjoyed proving his superiority over those who consulted him for information.
Javroun was well-versed in history, geography, genealogy, and the politics of humans. He spent much of his time at the Font of Knowledge in the Castle Ward and rented a house nearby.
