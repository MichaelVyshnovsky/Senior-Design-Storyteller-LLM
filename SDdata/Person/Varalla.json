        "History": "Varalla's history is shrouded in uncertainty, but whether by her, another, or merely by happenstance is not clear.\n\nIt was said that she was at the [[Battle of Bones]] in the {{YearlinkName|1090}}. The tale goes that she was buried beneath the piles of corpses that were the battle's combatants and had to claw her way back above them.\n\nShe arrived at the Sunset Keep (the former appellation given to Darkhold) some time in the late 12{{th}} century [[DR]]. Having slaughtered all of the creatures within who refused to obey her, she began creating numerous [[undead]] servants, which gained her new demesne a fell reputation in the surrounding lands. It was under her rulership that the fortress became known as Darkhold.\n\nRumors abounded that the Lich Queen took possession of the keep's ancient magics, which furthered her own [[spell]] research. She also completed [[Varalla's Passage]], a tunnel from the surface down to the [[drow]] city of [[Sshamath]] commissioned by the Conclave of Sshamath to open up a trade route to the surface realms.<ref> She was known to have defeated several groups of adventurers looking to defeat her, or at least plunder her lair.\n\nThis, in turn, attracted the attention of the [[Zhentarim]], who were looking to expand westward and needed a base, and used the excuse of her evil to lay siege to Darkhold, in the knowledge no-one would support her and because [[Cormyr]]'s [[Purple Dragons]] did not protect the people of the [[Tunlands]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, they attacked with their [[priest]]s and [[wizard]]s, Zhentish militia, mercenaries, and allied [[goblin]]s and went over its crumbling walls. The majority of the troops employed by the Black Network were killed during the siege, having not been informed of the nature of the enemy that they were about to face.",
        "Relationships": "She had as a servant the [[great wyrm]] [[black dragon]] [[Harondalbar]], though he made a pact with the Zhentarim after the destruction of his mistress.<ref>"
