        "mainbody": "'''Uva''' was a Black Gauntlet of [[Bane]], who served the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Uva was a pale-skinned [[human]] woman who wore her decorated [[Banite]] Black Gauntlet [[armor]] that included a [[breastplate]], pauldrons decorated with a hellish face, and a large and intimidating [[helmet]], decorated with a pair of metal tusks and a big image of Bane's black hand. Uva was armed with an ''[[infernal mace]].''",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Cult of Bane]] joined forces with the [[Cult of the Absolute]], led by the [[Chosen]] of Bane, Lord [[Enver Gortash]]. Black Gauntlet Uva was a part of the Cult's operations that targeted the countless refugees that flooded Baldur's Gate. Her branch of the Cult assembled donations and toys rigged with [[blackpowder]] explosives in the [[Felogyr's Fireworks]] shop's third floor. Presumably, Black Gauntlet Uva perished during or shortly before the Cult attacked Baldur's Gate."
