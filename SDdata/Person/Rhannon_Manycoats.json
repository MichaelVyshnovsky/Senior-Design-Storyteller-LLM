She operated in [[Sembia]]'s, [[Impiltur]]'s, and [[Chessenta]]'s ports collecting information about the most precious cargo to delivered to her companions. Her thief career came to an end when the Red Blades stole the menagerie of the archmage [[Saelanth]] of [[Telflamm]]Â and the wizard in revenge killed all the pirates but Rhannon.\n\nFor an entire year she fled through [[Amn]] pursued by [[ooze]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, [[stirge]]s, and worse monsters. At last, Saelanth captured Rhannon and decided to toy with her. However, somehow she managed to kill the wizard.\n\nAfterward, Rhannon decided to change her life and settled in Essembra. She was magically disguised as a older woman, and still pursued by the monstrous apprentices of Saelanth.",

        "Relationship": "[[Ilmeth]] was Rhannon's friend and promised to help her at need. She had three [[golem]]s in her shop.."
