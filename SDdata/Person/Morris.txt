'''Morris''' was a [[ranger]] who worked as a swimming instructor in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, Morris was in his early twenties. Morris was a handsome {{SIAdj|5'11|'"|long=yes|adj=tall}} man who weighed {{SI|160|lb|k|long=yes}}. He had green eyes, brown hair, and tan skin.

==Personality==
Morris was an expressive man with almost theatrical expressions. He was brave and appreciated the scars he'd gained during his adventuring days as they were great conversation pieces and attracted the ladies. Despite adventuring, Morris was a peace-loving man at heart.

==Abilities==
Morris spoke [[Common]], [[Elvish]], [[Gnomish]], and [[Dwarvish]] languages. He was trained in wielding [[stiletto]]s, [[sabre]]s, [[bolas]], [[net]]s, and [[lasso]]s. As a ranger, he was a competent tracker and swimmer. Morris also was knowledgeable in the fields of etiquette and ancient history.

When he was in battle, Morris wielded weapons in both hands and wore a set of [[chain armor]].

==History==
Morris hailed from a rich family who lived in [[Procampur]]. He chose an adventuring life early on to satisfy his craving for excitement. As an [[adventurer]], he embarked on several oceanic voyages. But, eventually, Morris grew disillusioned with the profession and all the bloodshed that came with the territory. One day, Morris's ship docked in Ravens Bluff, and that was where he met [[Milissa]] of [[Eldath]]. The two quickly found common ground and a sense of kinship, bonding over the young priestess's philosophy of peace. He decided to stay in the City of Ravens and joined Milissa as a teacher in her swimming school. Together they hosted swimming courses part-time at Ravens Bluff's docks, hoping to save enough coin to build a Temple to Eldath, not far from the harbors.

Under Milissa's influence, Morris adapted a defensive fighting style that fit his peaceful demeanor.
