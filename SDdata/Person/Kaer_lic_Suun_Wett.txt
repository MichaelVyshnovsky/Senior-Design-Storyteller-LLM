'''Kaer'lic Suun Wett''' was a [[drow]] priestess of [[Lolth]] and part of a band of four along with [[Ad'non Kareese]], [[Donnia Soldou]] and [[Tos'un Armgo]]. 

==Description==
Kaer'lic lost her right eye in a battle almost a hundred years ago before [[1371 DR]], and she replaced it with a black eye from a [[giant spider]]. Although she claimed that she could see with the spider eye, her comrades knew that this was not true. 

==History==
Kaer'lic was once a member of [[House Suun Wett]] of [[Ched Nasad]].

She was killed by [[King Obould Many-Arrows]] when he tore out her throat with his teeth in retribution for her sabotage of his armor during his fight with [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], and her subsequent attempt to kill him in a magically-conjured earthquake when her sabotage failed.

==Relationships==
She was the part-time lover of Tos'un, although she was not particularly interested in having a partner.
