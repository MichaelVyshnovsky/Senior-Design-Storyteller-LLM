'''Arundoom''' was a [[mage]] who inhabited the city of [[Waterdeep]] at an undertermined time.

==History==
Arundoom was treacherously attacked by his apprentice who hurled three [[dagger]]s into his back. Arundoom survived however, and enacted his revenge in a truly creative way. He placed a magical [[curse]] upon the alley where he was attacked, causing a trio of daggers to fly through the air and attack his apprentice. Arundoom used magical ''[[fear]]'' to force his apprentice to walk through the alley three times, once for every eight years of apprenticeship. The alley was later named [[Three Daggers Alley]] because of this incident and the curse survived through the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] despite many attempts to ''[[Dispel magic|dispel]]'' it.
