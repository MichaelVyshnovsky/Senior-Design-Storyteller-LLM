        "Description": "The [[gnome]] had swept-back blonde hair and wore a suit of [[scale mail]] armor. He fought with a [[greatsword]] that was similar in height to him.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Gimblebock led a band of looters including [[Andorn]], [[Barton (looter)|Barton]], [[Cefrey]], [[Haseid]], [[Mari (looter)|Mari]], [[Quelenna]], [[Taman]], [[Torgga]], and [[Warryn]]. They tried to break into an [[Temple of Jergal (Sword Coast)|ancient crypt]] near the shore of the [[River Channath]]. During their excavation, a [[nautiloid]] crashed close by, and the gnome immediately laid claim to it. Taman argued with him, saying they didn't know for sure what the nature of the crashed object was, but Gimblebock was sure that it was a ship."
