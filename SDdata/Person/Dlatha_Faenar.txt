Nails of the Lady Dlatha Faenar was the high priestess within the Spires Against the Stars, a temple devoted to Beshaba located in Tethyr in the  mid-to-late-14 century DR.
Though advanced in age by 1367 DR, Dlatha was kept beautiful by powerful magic.
Dlatha advanced over her rivals by slaying and outwitting them at every instance, rising through Beshabas ranks for nearly a century. She was believed to wield magic that most mortals could not use or understand.
Several witnesses claimed to have seen Dlatha visit the camp of General Nashram Sharboneth before the Ten Black Days of Eleint, and she was also spotted atop the walls of Castle Tethyr on the night that it was burned to the ground, leading some to suspect that she helped orchestrate the fall of Tethyr for her goddess.
