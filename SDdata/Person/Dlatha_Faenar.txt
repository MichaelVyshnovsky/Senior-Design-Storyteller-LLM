Nails of the Lady '''Dlatha Faenar''' was the high priestess within the [[Spires Against the Stars]], a temple devoted to [[Beshaba]] located in [[Tethyr]] in the  mid-to-late-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Though advanced in age by [[1367 DR]], Dlatha was kept beautiful by powerful [[magic]].

==Activities==
Dlatha advanced over her rivals by slaying and outwitting them at every instance, rising through Beshaba's ranks for nearly a century. She was believed to wield magic that most mortals could not use or understand.

==Rumors==
Several witnesses claimed to have seen Dlatha visit the camp of General [[Nashram Sharboneth]] before the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]], and she was also spotted atop the walls of [[Castle Tethyr]] on the night that it was burned to the ground, leading some to suspect that she helped orchestrate the fall of Tethyr for her goddess.
