        "mainbody": "Siulajia was a talented fighter who was captured by the Zhentarim in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nSiulajia had bushy blond hair and wore a golden tiara. She was adorned with several pieces of jewellery and wore a set of armor.Siulajia appears to be based off of the woman in the original artwork (used as the cover in this game) by Clyde Caldwell.\nThe fighter wore chainmail and fought with a scimitar and shield in close combat, and used a composite longbow and arrows if at range. She was exceptional at both archery and fighting, both complimented by her great strength, skill, and robustness.\nSiulajia was the daughter of Lezoul of the Great Oaks, a famed guide who raised her in the High Forest. In 1358 DR, the fighter decided to hunt near the edge of the woods. Here, she witnessed a group of Zhentarim and their minions that had survived the Battle of Ascore. As she went to slip away, a hill giant captured her, and brought her to a Zhentarim agent. They decided it would be best to bring her as a gift to Geildarr Ithym, and she feigned interest so she would be able to later escape. However, the Zhentarim remained ever vigilant, and made their way to the Lords Keep in Llorkh.\nUpon arriving in Llorkh, Siulajia was taken to see Lord Geildarr, but was intercepted by a jealous enchantress called Cortarra, and was imprisoned. That same year, the Heroes of Ascore assisted the dwarven resistance in attempting to reclaim their city. In the process, they came across Cortarra and Siulajia, with the former transforming herself into the latter. Siulajia claimed that she was the real prisoner, but, of course, so did Cortarra. The prolific heroes managed to tell them apart, and slew the mage. After this, Siulajia asked to join the adventurers.Siulajia and her male counterpart, Jarbarkas, were the first ever NPCs in a video game to be able to fall in love with a player character. Thus, they only joined the group if the party leader was of the opposite sex."
