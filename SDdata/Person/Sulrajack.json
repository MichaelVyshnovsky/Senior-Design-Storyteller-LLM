        "mainbody": "'''Sulrajack''' was a charismatic seller of [[potion]]s and lotions from the [[Pride of Athkatla]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Sulrajack was a darkly handsome man with sharp features and a black beard. His bigger-than-life personality and golden tongue made him popular among women of Athkatla and personable enough to know virtually everyone in the city.",
        "Relationships": "Despite his outrageous personality, one could notice that Sulrajack diligently studied people that passed through the Pride of Athkatla. He communicated his observations through hand gestures to armed men on the other side of the market. This secrecy took place because the column behind Sulrajack's stall hid a secret entrance to a meeting spot for the [[Khollynnus Paac]]'s sect of the [[Cowled Wizards]].",
        "History": "Sulrajack claimed to have come from a far-away mountain \"where [[god]]s often walked.\" He claimed to have just awoken there as a child on a pile of [[gold]]en treasure surrounding a [[dragon]]'s skeleton. Years later, as an adult, Sulrajack returned to the dead dragon's horde and claimed it as his own. The truthfulness of this and many other stories that came out of the vendor's mouth was questionable, but that didn't stop men and women of Athkatla from coming to Sulrajack to get love advice or purchase substances of the same personal nature. He was also on good terms with other merchants as they were known to visit Sulrajack at the end of the workday to get the latest rumors and jokes in exchange for a tip."
