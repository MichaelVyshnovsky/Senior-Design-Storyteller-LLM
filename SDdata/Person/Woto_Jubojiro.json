        "mainbody": "'''Woto Jubojiro''' was an old [[bushi]] in [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR]].",
        "History": "Jubojiro was a soldier in the army of [[Matasuuri Nagahide]]. One day, during the suppression of a [[korobokuru]] insurrection, his platoon was ambushed and destroyed, and only Jubojiro survived by escaping into a cave. There he freed a bee from a spider's web and later in a dream the bee showed him defeating the korobokuru leading a bee swarm.\n\nJubojiro believed he had a sure position in Nagahide's army but, around [[1346 DR]], after becoming [[shogun]], Nagahide reorganized the army, firing many bushi, among them Jubojiro. Therefore, he started a new life as a beekeeper near [[Juzimura]] but over time developed a resentment against the [[shogunate]] for their preference for younger bushi in command positions. He wanted to retaliate."
