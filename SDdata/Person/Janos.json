By that year, he had personally trained three other knights of the order.\n\nJanos' was greatly concerned about the plots [[Shadovar]] who lived within the returned [[Netherese]] enclave, the [[City of Shade]]. He patrolled the area [[Anauroch]] around the flying city, hoping to stop all possible Shadovar plots before they could disturb the [[Weave]], especially those involved the [[Shadow Weave]]."
