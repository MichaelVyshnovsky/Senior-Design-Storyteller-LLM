'''Thom Reaverson''' was a [[bard]] and historian of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the early 1360s [[DR]], King [[Azoun IV]] requested Thom Reaverson and [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]] to write accounts of the [[Tuigan]] people and of the crusade against the [[Tuigan Horde]] in the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]]. Thom wrote ''[[History of the Crusade]]'' and aided Koja on his ''[[Life among the Tuigan]]'', providing translation and guidance. Koja felt that Goodman Reaverson put in an equal amount of work and written a more exhaustive account of the war.As Thom and Koja worked together in Suzail, and the two books are bound together, it seems likely that Thom also wrote ''History of the Crusade'' for King Azoun.

Finished by [[1362 DR]], Thom's ''History of the Crusade'' gave a complete, careful, and unbiased account of the war.
