Thom Reaverson was a bard and historian of the midâ€“14 century DR.
In the early 1360s DR, King Azoun IV requested Thom Reaverson and Koja of Khazari to write accounts of the Tuigan people and of the crusade against the Tuigan Horde in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR. Thom wrote History of the Crusade and aided Koja on his Life among the Tuigan, providing translation and guidance. Koja felt that Goodman Reaverson put in an equal amount of work and written a more exhaustive account of the war.As Thom and Koja worked together in Suzail, and the two books are bound together, it seems likely that Thom also wrote History of the Crusade for King Azoun.
Finished by 1362 DR, Thoms History of the Crusade gave a complete, careful, and unbiased account of the war.
