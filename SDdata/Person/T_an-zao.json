They were based in a secluded valley.\nTan-zao was an explorer from the Plain of Horses who, in 1347 DR, was shipwrecked in Kozakura with his entourage and started life as a bandit. Many times, Niwa Hirotada sent expeditions to eradicate Tan-zaos bandit group but he always retreated.\nTan-zao was a brilliant tactician, fusing tactics from his homeland with Kozakuran ones. He had a very capable cavalry. From his homeland, Tan-zao learned only death and plunder. He was clever but vindictive. However, Tan-zao recognized his weaknesses."
