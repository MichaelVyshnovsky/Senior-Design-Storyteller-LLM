'''Heldakar Darakh''' was the second [[Nentyarch]] of the [[Darakh Dynasty]] to rule [[Narfell]].

==Activities==
Heldakar assumed the title of Nentyarch upon the death of the previous ruler, [[Jesthren Darakh]], in {{Yearlink|-322}}. He ruled until {{Yearlink|-299}}.

==Relationships==
Heldakar was a [[half-fiend]] son of a [[human]] woman of the Darakh line and the [[demon lord]] [[Orcus]]. His mother was sacrificed to Orcus immediately after his birth, beginning a tradition of matriarchal sacrifice that would continue for the rest of the rulers throughout the Darakh lineage.
