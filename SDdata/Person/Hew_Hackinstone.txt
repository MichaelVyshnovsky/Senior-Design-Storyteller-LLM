'''Hew Hackinstone''' was a [[shield dwarf]] posing as a jungle guide in [[Port Nyanzaru]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|You want a guide who runs away at the first sign of trouble? No! You want a [[dwarf]], and I'm the toughest dwarf around. [[Red dragon]] bit off my arm, yet here I stand! Takes more than a [[dragon]] to stop Hew Hackinstone!|Hew Hackinstone}}

==Description==
Hew was missing his left arm as the result of an encounter with the red dragon [[Tzindelor]].

==Personality==
He was a bold and confident guide and combatant, and claimed both that he was unafraid of anything and that he had both visited and perfectly remembered "every" mountain, gorge, trail, and crevice in Chult.

Hew posed as a jungle guide in Port Nyanzaru, but with the goal of gathering [[adventurer]]s to take his revenge on Tzindelor. 

==Possessions==
He used his one arm to wield his [[battleaxe]].

==History==
According to Hew, he and his kin had once been the operators of Wyrmheart Mine in southwestern Chult until the dragon Tzindelor seized it from them in the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR. About 37 years later, Hew was subsequently part of a five-dwarf expedition that sought to reclaim and reopen the Wyrmheart Mine, but unfortunately, Tzindelor ambushed them at the bottom of the mine shaft and burned alive all of Hew's companions. The dragon allowed Hew to escape so that his failure could haunt him, but not before she took his arm (and some of his sanity).

Three years later, at the same time as the [[death curse]] struck [[Toril]],{{ToA-time}} Hew was in Port Nyanzaru making promises that he could lead expeditions anywhere they wanted in Chult, but actually planning to find a party of brave adventurers and lead them only to Wyrmheart Mine.

By the time the death curse had ended, Hew had found his way alone to [[Shilku Bay]] (not far from the mines) where he encountered a party of champions from the [[Sword Coast]]. After asking them honestly to help him slay the dragon and reclaim the mine, the champions agreed to aid him. They battled through Tzindelor's kobold minions, first seizing the mines' forge and then slaying the dragon.
