        "mainbody": "'''Brenna''' was a [[human]] [[adventurer]] and leader of the [[Puppetmasters]] company ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Personality": "She was a humorless and serious person, who went about her life in a ruthless, pragmatic manner. She was almost fearless in combat, and had no tolerance for anyone who failed to live up to her expectations.",
        "Possessions": "Brenna's favored weapon was a powerful ''+2 [[longsword]] of [[sword of sharpness|sharpness]]'', backed up with a magical ''+2 [[short bow]]'' and a quiver of enchanted ''+2 [[sheaf arrow]]s''. She wore [[chain mail]] and a ''+2 [[ring of protection]]''.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], she came up with a scheme to win an easy prize for her company. She planted a letter and treasure map that led to the dungeon of [[Barrenstone]], allowing another adventuring group to excavate and clear out the complex. When they emerged from the dungeon with the treasure, the Puppetmasters attempted to rob their victims, only to be driven off and receive nothing for their troubles."
