{{quote|I hope this comedian is as good as they say he is. If the Absolute is going to kill us all, I want to go out laughing.|Saer Preciosa}}

==Description==
Preciosa was a [[half-elven]] woman of the [[wood elven]] ancestry with a light woody or bronze skin tone and muddly blue eyes. She wore her blonde hair braided and lightly dyed in lavender.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Saer Preciosa was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. She attended the "Laff Riot" show at the Elfong, a stand-up comedy performance hosted by [[Harvard Willoughby]] in Elfsong's side room with a stage. Preciosa, a well-dressed woman herself, thought Willoughby to be a snappy dresser apart from the man's [[monocle]]. She hoped the word around town about the comedian was true and he was funny enough to distract her from the looming threat of the [[Cult of the Absolute]].
