        "mainbody": "'''Mola''' was an Adept of [[the Absolute]], stationed in the [[Moonrise Towers]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''You're not the first to brave the dark for the Absolute. The war camps are full to bursting.''|Adept Mola}}",
        "Description": "Mola wore the uniform [[armor]] of an Adept of the Absolute – a night-blue armored garb and a cowled high-raising helmet. He had a dark green skin and fur tone, and his face had thick bloated dark veins – the evidence of an [[illithid]] tadpole infection.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Adept Mola was among those who joined the new religion that sprang in the [[Western Heartlands]]. He was stationed within the Moonrise Towers, along the stairwell that led up to its second floor. The fortress was controlled by the Absolute's warlord – General [[Ketheric Thorm]]. Like many other members of the cult, Mola's fate remained unknown as he could've perished in battle when the [[High Harper]] [[Jaheira]] and her [[True Soul]] allies stormed the Moonrise."
