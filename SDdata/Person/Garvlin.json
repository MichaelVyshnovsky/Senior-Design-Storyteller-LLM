        "mainbody": "'''Garvlin''' was a [[barbed devil]] in service to the [[pit fiend]] [[Kurgaloth]].",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Garvlin was one of many [[lesser devil]]s brought to the [[Lightfinger Estate]] in [[Waterdeep]] to enforce a lapsed contract between Kurgaloth and the [[Lightfinger (family)|Lightfinger family]]. Garvlin was assigned to guard the approach to the mansion.\n\nWhen [[adventurer]]s arrived to investigate the chaos that the [[devil]]s' arrival had caused, Garvlin was the first devil they encountered. Garvlin was defeated in the ensuing battle but managed to escape, thus avoiding being banished back to [[Avernus]]."
