Garvlin was assigned to guard the approach to the mansion.\nWhen adventurers arrived to investigate the chaos that the devils arrival had caused, Garvlin was the first devil they encountered. Garvlin was defeated in the ensuing battle but managed to escape, thus avoiding being banished back to Avernus."
