'''Circe''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]]ess turned [[proxy]] of the [[Olympian pantheon|Olympian]] [[power]] known as [[Hecate]].'''Circe appears in both 2nd and 1st edition, ''Planescape'' and core ''Dungeons & Dragons'' sources respectively. It seems likely that these sources refer to the same being due to the following reasons:'''
* In the 1st edition [[Deities & Demigods 1st edition|''Deities & Demigods'']] she is listed as a mortal, talks about the Odyssey, and describes her as being "almost immortal."
* ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]'' states Circe is a mortal servant who rose to the status of proxy. This Circe shows up again in [[Planes of Conflict (boxed set)|''Planes of Conflict'']], providing a quote about turning people into pigs, a deliberate reference to the Odyssey.

She was not known to have interacted with [[Toril]], though in [[northwest Faer√ªn]] an [[Church of Oghma|Oghmanyte]] temple known as [[Bard Keep]] contained a copy of ''[[Circe's Cookbook]]'', a tome authored by a "black sorceress."{{Cite dungeon/29/Ex Libris|42}}<ref group="note" name="Identity">Due to the lack of information provided on ''Circe's Cookbook'', one could take the approach that the "Circe" who authored it was either an unknown sorceress in the Realms or the Circe of Greek myth. This wiki leans towards the latter, since Circe is detailed in [[Deities & Demigods 1st edition|''Deities & Demigods'']] as having the title "black sorceress" and because the adventure features a book on the Greek deity [[Hephaestus (deity)|Hephaestus]]. That being said though, it's important to keep in mind that this is still a speculation and that both views are valid.

{{Quote|''You're a pig, now be one.|Circe the Enchantress to a rude [[planewalker]]}}

==Abilities==
Circe was an accomplished spellcaster, allegedly having enough power to take out a small army without breaking a sweat. More specifically she was a [[transmuter]], as the majority of her [[spell]]s revolved around the ''[[polymorph]]'' effect. She also had great prophetic powers. 

After rising to the status of a proxy, Hecate gifted her the innate ability of having unfailing spells, allowing them to crack through most [[magic resistance]]s.

==Possessions==
Circe typically dressed in revealing black [[gown]]s. She possessed a wide variety of [[magical item]]s that all involved the ''polymorph'' effect, including [[potion]]s, [[scroll]]s, and [[wand]]s. One such wand of hers worked only on men, was usable only by wizards, and would turn its target into an animal that exemplified their essential nature.<ref>

==History==
For much of her life Circe was a devout, mortal servant of the goddess Hecate. At one point during this period of her life, she was living on an [[earth|alternate prime material world]] and intercepted the crew of an [[adventurer]] by the name of [[Wikipedia:Odysseus|Odysseus]], the grandson of the Olympian power [[Hermes]]<ref> and the proxy of the Olympian power [[Athena]].<ref> Circe fell in love with him and turned his crew into [[pig]]s, but ultimately Odysseus came to defeat her.<ref>

Later in life, after many years of faithful service both she and Hecate agreed that it was time for her recieve a rise in power. Thus, she was promoted to the status of a full proxy.

==Activities==
Circe spent most of her time doing her best to protect [[Aeaea]], Hecate's [[divine realm]] in the [[Pluton]] layer of [[Hades]], and impressing her goddess's might upon those traveling through the realm.

==Trivia==
In the [[crystal sphere]] known as [[w:c:spelljammer:Greatspace|Greatspace]], Circe was among the evil members of the Olympian pantheon that were thought by the sphere's inhabitants to not exist and just be mere rumors started centuries ago.<ref>
