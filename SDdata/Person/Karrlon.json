        "mainbody": "'''Karrlon''' was a male [[wemic]] [[ranger]] and [[paladin]] of [[Nobanion]]. He was a scout in the [[Mindulgulph Mercenary Company]], based in [[Mindulgulph Castle]] just south of [[Priapurl]] on the [[Dragon Coast]], and the founder of the [[Legion of Lions]], a militant religious order devoted to Nobanion the Lion King.",
        "History": "Shortly after the [[Time of Troubles]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], Karrlon founded the Legion of Lions, a militant order of Nobanion-worshiping wemics.\n\nIn the 1360s DR, Karrlon went with the Mindulgulph Company to the [[Eastern Shaar]], where they took an extended contract with the [[gold dwarves]] of the [[Great Rift]]. Their purpose was to study the chances of war in the local [[Underdark]]. They were still here at the end of [[1367 DR]]. During this time, Karrlon joined his commander, [[Gayrlana]], and a [[loxo]] named [[Floshwa]] on a scouting expedition in the Shaar.\n\nKarrlon later left the Mindulgulphs to devote himself fully as a [[crusader]] of the Legion of Lions.There is a potential conflict here in that ''Powers & Pantheons'' implies that Karrlon left the Mindulgulphs prior to founding the Legion of Lions after 1358 DR, yet ''Gold & Glory'' depicts Karrlon with the Mindulgulphs in the 1360s, assuming the Shaar expedition is a part of the Great Rift contract. However, it is possible that Karrlon remained with the Mindulgulphs for some time; indeed, ''Powers & Pantheons'' states that individual members of the Legion often join other adventuring companies to see the world.\n\nHe was still in the Legion in [[1374 DR]]."
