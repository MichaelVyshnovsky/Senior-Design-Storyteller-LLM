Gorvan Ironheart was a dwarven priest of Grumbar in the Doomvault dungeon in 1486 DR.
Gorvan was interested only in money.
Gorvan was a cleric of Grumbar. He was recruited by the Red Wizards of Thay to work in the Doomvault in exchange for a large sum of money. Gorvan helped two Red Wizards to create clay golems. In 1486 DR, when the heroes from Daggerford arrived, he lied to them and claimed to be a prisoner. If the adventurers believed him, he would accompany the party until he found an opportunity to escape.
