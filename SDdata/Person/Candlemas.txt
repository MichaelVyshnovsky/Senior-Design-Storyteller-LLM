'''Candlemas''' was the [[wikipedia:steward (office)|high steward]] for [[Polaris|Lady Polaris]] of [[Delia]] in the [[Netheril|Netherese Empire]] during the [[Shadowed Age]].

==Description==
The bearded [[wizard]] was short, fat, and balding.

==Possessions==
Candlemas preferred to dress in a plain brown [[wikipedia:sackcloth|sackcloth]] [[wikipedia:smock-frock|smock]], which was tied with a length of rope.

==Relationships==
The [[mentalist]] looked up to Lady Polaris, but butted heads with her [[wikipedia:chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]], [[Sysquemalyn]].

==History==
''Circa'' {{Yearlink|-700}}, Candlemas and Sysquemalyn gambled on whether or not [[Sunbright Steelshanks]] would survive various dangerous tasks.

Around {{Yearlink|-339}}, the [[archwizard]] known as [[Karsus]] stole Candlemas from the past and brought him to the future to aid him in crafting his most powerful [[spell]]s.

After returning from the future, Candlemas was murdered by Sysquemalyn in the {{YearlinkName|-694}}.
