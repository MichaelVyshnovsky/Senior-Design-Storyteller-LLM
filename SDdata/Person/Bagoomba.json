        "mainbody": "Big Chief Bagoomba was the leader of the Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba, formerly the Saiyama tribe, that dwelt at the base of the Fire Mountain on the Malatran Plateau, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nBagoomba was a large Nubari man.\nBig Chief Bagoomba was a narcissistic man with larger-than-life personality. His leadership was nothing but symbolic as the true behind-the-scenes ruler and manipulator was the clever Bengoukee. Bagoomba participated in the annual War Council only to partake in celebrations that followed.\nBig Chief Bagoomba was proud of his tribes size. After rising to power, he changed the tribes name from Saiyama, to honor himself. The Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba numbered 500 men, a fact that Bagoomba often boasted about, claiming that he ruled the biggest community in the entire world.\nBagoomba claimed the throne from the tribes previous chieftain, Toloka, after he and his family were slaughtered by caiman katanga. Tolokas exalted witch doctor proclaimed a test of mettleâ€”the hunter who killed the biggest predator before the next full moon was to become Saiyamas new ruler. At the time, Bagoomba was an inexperienced youth who happened to come across two giant predators battling in the jungles, and one of the creatures was thrown into a river and killed. Bagoomba rushed to the village and claimed to have killed the monster but it was too big to carry back. When the elders arrived, the slain predator was mutilated by jungles scavengers and no-one could prove foul play. By the late 14 century DR, hed been leading the tribe for over 20 years.\nBut Bagoomba met his demise on the 25 year of his rule during a battle in the Jungle of Lost Tribes. The boisterous warrior chief was battling a gang of kretch and was back-stabbed by a spider katanga. After his death, the tribe was renamed to the Tribe of Former Big Chief Bagoomba."
