        "mainbody": "agda was a duergar cleric of Laduguer and slave of Baeloth Barrityl.\nShe was very uptight and thought that nobody ever listened to her. Magda believed that her deity, Laduguer, may have turned away from her, and that she had to prove her worth, in order to gain his favor once more. She wished that the other duergar slave, who was her husband Brendak, would stand up for her. She also sold a variety of heavy weapons.\nBaeloth once unleashed several monsters upon Magda and her duergar kin. Her husband would not speak to her after their capture."
