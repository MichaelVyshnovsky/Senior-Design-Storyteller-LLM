'''Boswell C. Peddywinkle''' was a well-connected and well-known caravan merchant who routinely traveled the [[Ten Towns]] and [[Luskan]] trading in scrimshaw in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Boswell was a short (5 feet, 4 inches) and pudgy man, but he had a regal appearance. He was around 50 years old in 1369 DR. He had a huge handlebar mustache and keen blue eyes. His hair was pure white but nearly all lost to balding. He often wore an expensive courtly dress.

==Personality==
He was very amiable, outgoing, and chatty. He loved telling fanciful and exaggerated stories about himself. He was known to pay his employees very well.

==Relationships==
According to Boswell's stories, at least, the beautiful queen of [[Salsa]] loved him and gave him a quite rare bauble.

==History==
Peddywinkle had a long career of traveling to the [[Icewind Dale]], trading in scrimshaw, and had an impressive set-up for fishing on the lakes. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, he traveled with and eventually was murdered by [[Celerum|Celerum the Black]] who took over his business and persona using his ''[[hat of disguise]]''.
