        "mainbody": "'''Begoas the Inquisitive''' was a handsome [[human]] [[necromancer]] from the [[Old Empires]] region and the first Minister of Necromancy in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/98/The Ministry of Art: Ravens Bluff's Newest Government Branch|6-7}}",
        "Personality": "Begoas was a soft-spoken individual, prone to giving wise advice. He had a deep fascination with human [[anatomy]], a fascination that some believed had no boundaries. When it came to [[necromancy]], Begoas was very outspoken against the prejudice of Ravens Bluff's populace, saying that his study of that [[school of magic]] was done for the purpose of opposing those who would use it for evil purposes, though many Ravenians didn't believe his protestations.",
        "History": "Begoas was born somewhere in the Old Empires region,{{Cite polyhedron/98/The Ministry of Art: Ravens Bluff's Newest Government Branch|6-7}} and was speculated to be either [[Mulhorandi]] or [[Unther]]i.\n\nBegoas's time in the Ministry of Art began with its formation by Lord Mayor [[Charles Oliver O'Kane]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, shortly before the month of [[Flamerule]]. During those early days, public opposition towards the formation of the governing body included criticism of the inclusion of a representative for the necromancy school of magic, arguing that it was inherently evil.\n\nIn [[Ches]] of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the Ministry of Art and [[Wizards Guild]] were unified; the two wizardly organizations allied their functions and leadership under a new name: the [[Guild of Magical Arts]]. The ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' reported the unification was a desperate act caused by the [[War with Myrkyssa Jelan]] taxing the magic and resources of both organizations. Nevertheless, Begoas and his fellow Ministers, along with the ranking members of the Wizards Guild, unanimously approved of the merger. During that time, Begoas coached and led Wizards Guild's members that specialized necromancy.{{Cite trumpeter/1-1|2}}\n\nHowever, after only two months of operation, the Guild of Magical Arts dissolved in [[Tarsakh]]. The ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter'' reported ministers had begun leaving the joint organization to reform the Ministry of Art after quickly becoming disillusioned with [[Alcides Von Tighe]]'s leadership. Those seats that remained with the Guild of Magical Arts included Begoas's seat and the seat for [[wild magic]]. However, the wild magic seat's position was a forced one, as Minister [[Glora Vano]] was on the run after being accused of treason for aiding [[Myrkyssa Jelan]]. Both organizations were unsure of how to proceed, and no plans for recruiting new Ministers were made.{{Cite trumpeter/1-2|3}}\n\nBy [[Mirtul]], 1370 DR, Begoas the Inquisitive was the only member who'd returned to the Ministry of Art. Back in the seat of necromancy, Begoas headed an investigation and search for the traitor Glora Vano. His investigation uncovered an ancient tomb that was believed to be the ex-Minister's hideout. The Ministry of Art disclosed the tomb's location to any and all adventurers willing to bring Glora Vano to justice.{{Cite trumpeter/1-3|3}}"
