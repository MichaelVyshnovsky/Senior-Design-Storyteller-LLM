'''Yui Min Li''' was the Minister of Faith of [[Shou Lung]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Yui Min Li was originally a [[sohei]] of the [[Dragon Order]] but also an [[Imperial Guard]]. After being promoted to minister, she faced a very hard task: her duty was to decide which among the thousands of different branches of the [[Path of Enlightenment]] could be sanctioned by the Imperial government, and be considered among the approximately 200 approved sects of the Path's Shou-ling Tao, or Receivers of Guidance. She also had to avoid battle between Shou-ling Tao sects, both between sanctioned sects and against non-sanctioned sects. Yui Min Li had a delicate truce with the Path's High Priest, [[Kung Pu Mok]], whom she knew had ties to the [[the Way|Black Chun Tao]]. She secretly had an ally in the Minister of Magic.
