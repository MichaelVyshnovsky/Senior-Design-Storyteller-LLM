        "mainbody": "The '''Rotting Man''', also known as the '''Talontyr''' and '''Talona's Consort'''{{cite book/Lady of Poison|141|14}} was a [[half-fiend]] [[druid]], [[Talontar]] [[blightlord]], and [[Chosen]] of [[Talona]].{{cite book/Unapproachable East|118}} He was the [[Circle of Leth]]'s most dangerous enemy during the late 14{{th}} century DR,",
        "Appearance": "The man oozed droplets of blood from his pores constantly; his appearance was wasted, rotten, and maddened.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|281|30}} His fingers were bone-white, and very thin, always shaking in some amount of chronic pain{{cite book/Lady of Poison|167-168|17}} his cloak was made of rotting tatters.",
        "Personality": "He relished the opportunity to turn beautiful things to rot, and joy to loss.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|288|30}}",
        "Relationships": "He was the Circle of Leth's most powerful enemy.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|53|6}} He also had four [[blightlord]]s serving directly under him after capturing [[The Close]], but he sacrificed one of them while corrupting the light of Araluen. Another of his lieutenants had been slain in a fit of anger.",
        "Abilities": "The Rotting Man was incapable of dying to disease, gaining strength from them instead.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|171|17}}{{cite book/Lady of Poison|204|20}} He also knew a number of curse words capable of binding his own soul, which he used almost casually, most likely spoken in the [[Dark Speech]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|166|17}}\n\nWhen in combat, he could lauch overwhelming waves of rot; their exact effects were unknown, but they could be blocked by other divine beings, such as the aspect Araluen.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|282|30}} On those occassions he deigned engage personally, he employed shapeshifting as the capstone of his strategy.\n\nHe had also performed rites to capture the power of the aspect of Lurue{{cite book/Lady of Poison|126|13}}",
        "Possessions": "Close to his throne, he kept a flower made of bone-white material, linked to the lives of his [[blightlord]]s, which immediately warned him of their deaths{{cite book/Lady of Poison|165|17}} and also allowed him to slay them outright with a touch to the flower.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|1-3|Prologue}} He had also been the one to grant ''[[Gloomgate]]'' to [[Gameliel]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|155|15}}",
        "History": "He was first recorded in the [[Rawlinswood]] in the [[1362 DR|Year of the Helm, 1362 DR]]. He led an army of Talontar blightlords and various [[blightspawned creature]]s.\n\nHe diverted almost all of the light of [[Araluen]], an aspect of [[Lurue]], in {{yearlink|1368}}{{cite book/Lady of Poison|122-123|13}} a minimal sliver incarnated itself as a baby, that the farmer [[Hemish]] would name Ash.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|4-7|1}} In the [[1371 DR|Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR]], he led his army to seize [[Dun-Tharos]] from the [[Circle of Leth]]. The [[Nentyarch]] and other druids retreated to [[Yeshelmaar]]. While in the Close, he grew the [[Thieving Ash]] to turn Araluen into the Step-Daughter of Talona.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|288|30}}The prologue of ''Lady of Poison'' seems to indicate he stole the light before or on 1368 DR in The Close. As he had not occupied The Close until 1371 DR, this article assumes that the light had been diverted before somehow, to be forced to incarnate into an abomination only on 1371.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, he came close to retrieving the missing fragment of Araluen: his servant [[Gameliel]] sent [[blightspawned creature|blighted]] [[volodni]] after finally finding her in [[Fullpoint]], only to be thwarted by [[Elowen]], [[Marrec]] and [[Gunggari Ulmarra]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|30|4}} After that group slew the servant and conferred with the [[Nentyarch]], the Talontyr learned they were coming after him from a spy in the meeting, [[Fallon]].\n\nFallon decided to kidnap Araluen and head directly to Anammelech; Elowen's party came in his pursuit. After meeting with Anammelech, Fallon was sent ahead to deliver Araluen, while Anammelech stayed behind to set a trap for Fallon's pursuers;{{cite book/Lady of Poison|155|15}} the trap backfired, and the blightlord was slain. The Rotting Man contacted Fallon directly afterwards, and planted a compulsion on him to have him follow a set path underground. He also sent his last blightlord, [[Damanda]], to meet Fallon at a certain underground location.{{cite book/Lady of Poison||17}}\n\nOn [[Mirtul 7]], Damanda, after catching up with Fallon, was nearly slain by the adventurers pursuing him, ultimately being forced to escape into The Close with her master, and leaving Araluen behind.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|268|28}} The party confronted the Talontyr soon after; he explained that he wanted Araluen to come to him one way or the other. He unleashed her greater part, Talona's Step-Daughter, on them.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|295-297|30}} This backfired: he was driven out of Dun-Tharos by the aspect Araluen reborn, once more a servant of [[Lurue]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|298-301|31}} However, he left a legacy: hundreds of demons under Dun-Tharos awakened by the conflict."
