        "Biography": "Fleeing from a [[Chondathan]] mercenary army that had invaded the pirate city of [[Westgate]], Magrath landed in Cormyr and purchased the city of [[Suzail]] from [[Melineth Turcassan]] for 500 sacks of [[gold]] in [[429 DR]]. Magrath then plundered the city's treasury and took over as its ruler, seeking to expand his influence within Cormyr, and put a price on King [[Duar Obarskyr]]'s head, higher than what he had paid for Suzail.\n\nIn [[432 DR]], Magrath was killed by King Duar after an attack on the traitorous house [[Dheolur]].",
