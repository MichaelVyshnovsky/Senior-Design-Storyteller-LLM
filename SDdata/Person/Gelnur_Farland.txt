'''Gelnur Farland''' was a constable of [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Gelnur took care of the prisoners at the remote and secret prison stronghold of [[Castle Irlingstar]] in the [[Thunder Peaks]] on the eastern border of Cormyr, where the king put traitor nobles, murderers, and agents of [[Sembia]] and [[Westgate]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Gelnur went to check the body of the dead seneschal [[Marthin Avathnar]] and ordered an investigation into the murder. Later, Gelnur asked his subordinate constables [[Anglur Traelshun]] and [[Bradraer Delloak]] about possible security violations.

Some time after, Gelnur also discovered the death or disappearance of a squad of [[War Wizards]].

Later, he met [[Arclath Delcastle]] and [[Amarune Whitewave]], sent by King [[Foril Obarskyr I]]. Soon after, [[Nostyn Vandur]] also arrived, claiming to be a special inspector sent by the king to investigate the death of the seneschal but Gelnur distrusted him.

Later, Nostyn together with [[Duth Gulkanun]] and [[Imbrult Longclaws]] tried to stop Gelnur, Lord Delcastle and Amarune. In the fighting, Nostyn was killed but soon Gelnur made an agreement with Gulkanun.

[[Elminster]], possessing the body of a [[drow]] priestess, infiltrated the castle and joined the meeting.

Later, Gelnur died in the same manner than seneschal Avathnar.

==Relationship==
Gelnur was a secret acquaintance of War Wizard [[Glathra Barcantle]].
