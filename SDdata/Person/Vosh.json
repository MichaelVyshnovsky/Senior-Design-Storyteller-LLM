        "mainbody": "'''Vosh the White''' was a miller in the village of [[Toralth]] in [[Tethyr]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "Description": "Very few in Toralth knew that Vosh was a [[half-orc]], thanks to his long beard. The only orcish traits he inherited were a pug nose and features that he could hide underneath a thick beard.",
        "Activities": "He often went to the [[Blue Badger Inn]], being an old friend of the owner [[Jorid]].",
        "History": "On [[Uktar 10]], 1370 DR, three [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Bapar Ghalmrin]], [[Odak Truesteel]], and [[Soram Battlebellow]], entered the Blue Badger Inn, seeking the ''[[Sondarr Scepter]]''. When [[Bramas Thorntree]] accused some of the other patrons of stealing it, this triggered a tavern brawl. Vosh was one of the ones who tried to separate and calm the brawlers."
