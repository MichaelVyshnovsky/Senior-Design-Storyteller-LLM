Ito Kiku was a cursed maiden in Ito-jo in 1360 DR.
Ito Kiku was the daughter of Ito Tadahiro who died in the castles burning in 647 DR. Thanks to an ancient curse and a krakentuas influence, she did not truly die and instead lingered to haunt the castle. She was split into seven bodies, together the second of the seven weapon masters of the castle. Finally, in 1360 DR, an adventuring party hired by Michimori Uemon to recover the Seven Swords fought and destroyed her.
