'''Arbenita Darkwind''', mostly known as '''Benita''', was an evil [[cleric]] of [[Malar]] in [[Undermountain]] in [[1375 DR]].

==Activities==
Benita led the [[human]] community inside the forest of [[Wyllowwood]]. She loved to hunt and kill personally the adventurers that arrived there. Benita personally dealt with [[Wyllow]].

==History==
Benita one day plunged into a ''[[portal]]'' that transported her to that section of Undermountain. She liked the place and founded a community there, using a place that was formerly a part of [[Melairbode]]. Later Benita befriended Wyllow.

==Personality==
Benita knew well that her community's survival depended upon the will of Wyllow and that, if enraged, the [[elf]] could trigger the arrival of an irate [[Halaster Blackcloak]].
