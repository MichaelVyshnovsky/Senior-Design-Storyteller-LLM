Arbenita Darkwind, mostly known as Benita, was an evil cleric of Malar in Undermountain in 1375 DR.
Benita led the human community inside the forest of Wyllowwood. She loved to hunt and kill personally the adventurers that arrived there. Benita personally dealt with Wyllow.
Benita one day plunged into a portal that transported her to that section of Undermountain. She liked the place and founded a community there, using a place that was formerly a part of Melairbode. Later Benita befriended Wyllow.
Benita knew well that her communitys survival depended upon the will of Wyllow and that, if enraged, the elf could trigger the arrival of an irate Halaster Blackcloak.
