        "mainbody": "Tak was a female doppelganger in the Moonsea in the late 14 century DR.\nPosing as Doctor Jubal, she managed the wandering Doctor Jubals Carnival of Curiosities.\nCirca 1486 DR, Tak—posing as a half-elf—was hired by Doctor Jubal with the promise of helping her against the Great Law of Humanity of Hillsfar. However, she found that Jubal did not truly care about it. Meanwhile, whispers in her dreams told Tak to replace all humans with crazed mirror duplicates. So Tak decided to act, subduing Jubal and taking his position.\nAfterward, she began kidnapping people and replacing them with mirror duplicates created by the carnivals mirror maze while the originals remained chained inside the maze and had their souls slowly consumed by the demon lord Grazzt. The duplicates spread madness like an infection while the originals, without their souls, became mutated beings, totally loyal to Tak.\nHowever, at the village of Hillpicket, Tak was unveiled and killed by some adventurers.\nTak truly hated Hillsfars politics. She wanted to show everyone that nonhumans were not the monsters that the First Lord had made them out to be."
