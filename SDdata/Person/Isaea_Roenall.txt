'''Isaea Roenall''' was a nobleman and soldier who lived in the city of [[Athkatla]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Isaea's reputation among his peers was his most-valued asset.

==Activities==

He sponsored the activities of known [[pirate]]s, conducted smuggling operations, and was involved with Amnian slave trade.

Isaea served in the military under [[Corgeig Axehand]].

Through his illicit business practices Isaea had developed working relationships with the pirate [[Barg]] and his fellow officer in the army, [[Dirth]].

==History==
Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Isaea was arranged to be married with [[Nalia de'Arnise]]. As Nalia's fiance, Isaea felt he was owed rulership of her [[Arnise Hold|familial estate]] following the death of her [[Lord Arnise|father]].
