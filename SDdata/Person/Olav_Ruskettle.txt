'''Olav Ruskettle''' was a justly famous, but washed out bard who lost his name in a game of dice sometime before [[1357 DR]].

{{Quote|''I remember a bard, a true bard, named Ruskettle. Olav Ruskettle. Had a bad gambling habit. Would have staked his own mother on the roll of a die. I suppose by the time you ran into him, he had nothing left but his name.''|[[Finder Wyvernspur]]}}

==Description==
By the time [[Olive Ruskettle]] encountered Olav, he already had lost his hand, and his voice was starting to go, effectively dooming his bardic career.

==Personality==
Olav Ruskettle suffered from a crippling gambling addiction that almost ruined his life.

==Relationships==
He was an innkeeper working for his wife who owned an inn in Procampur.

At one point he was a well-known bard and, then mortal, [[Finder Wyvernspur]] was aware of his career.

==History==
At some point at the end of his career when he ran an inn in [[Procampur]], he has lost his name and reputation to a halfling [[thief]] later known as [[Olive Ruskettle]].
