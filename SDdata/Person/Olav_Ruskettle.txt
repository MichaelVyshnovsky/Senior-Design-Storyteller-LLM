Olav Ruskettle was a justly famous, but washed out bard who lost his name in a game of dice sometime before 1357 DR.
By the time Olive Ruskettle encountered Olav, he already had lost his hand, and his voice was starting to go, effectively dooming his bardic career.
Olav Ruskettle suffered from a crippling gambling addiction that almost ruined his life.
He was an innkeeper working for his wife who owned an inn in Procampur.
At one point he was a well-known bard and, then mortal, Finder Wyvernspur was aware of his career.
At some point at the end of his career when he ran an inn in Procampur, he has lost his name and reputation to a halfling thief later known as Olive Ruskettle.
