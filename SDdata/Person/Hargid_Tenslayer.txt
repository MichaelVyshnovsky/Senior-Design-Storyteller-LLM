'''Hargid Tenslayer''' was the [[Tharchion]] of [[Lapendrar]] in [[Thay]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Hargid, along with some other [[Thayan]] nobles and the [[Zulkir]] of [[Conjuration]], hatched a plot in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, where they planned to open a ''[[gate]]'' to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], strike deals with the lords of the [[plane]], and have select cities on the north coast of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] destroyed in order to rid themselves of competition.
