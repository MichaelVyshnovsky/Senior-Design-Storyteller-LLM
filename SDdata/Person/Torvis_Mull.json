        "mainbody": "Torvis Mull was a War Wizard who served with Sergeant Stoan at the border outpost on the Moonsea Ride north of Arabel in the late 14 century DR.\nTorvis was a snobbish but curious man with an active mind. He was a loyal servant of the Crown, but found himself bored and frustrated by being assigned to border garrison duty.\nTorvis wore bracers of defense and a war wizard cloak, and carried a wand of fire. He also carried a master key for unlocking the most secure doors in the outpost.\nAs the resident War Wizard, he was responsible for assisting the Purple Dragons in any magical matters, and personally interviewed and took down records of powerful mages that entered Cormyr."
