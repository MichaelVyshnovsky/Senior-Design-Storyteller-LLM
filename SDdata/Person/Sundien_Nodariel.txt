Sundien Nodariel was an eccentric elven leatherworker for hire from the city of Neverwinter, active in the late 15 century DR.
For Sundien, the leatherworkers career was nothing but a hobby, the latest one in a long list. In the late 15 century DR, the elf was offering his services to the defenders and adventurers of Neverwinter for a chance to practice the craft and develop the talent further.
