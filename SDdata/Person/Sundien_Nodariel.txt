'''Sundien Nodariel''' was an eccentric [[elf|elven]] leatherworker for hire from the city of [[Neverwinter]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
For Sundien, the leatherworker's career was nothing but a hobby, the latest one in a long list. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the elf was offering his services to the defenders and adventurers of Neverwinter for a chance to practice the craft and develop the talent further.
