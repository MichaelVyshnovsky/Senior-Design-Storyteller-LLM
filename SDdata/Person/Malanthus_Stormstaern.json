            "Legacy": "Malanthus Stormstaern slept with so many women that, even by the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], hundreds of families across the southern coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars still bore children with his distinctive eyes."

        "Description": "Malanthus was a handsome man with black beard and black eyes flecked with gold that made them seem to flash.",
        "Skills": "In addition to his mighty magic, Malanthus was an actor and a seducer. He enjoyed fine [[wine]] and [[music]], and had a hobby in concocting scents and [[perfume]]s.",
        "Allies": "Malanthus's oldest friend was his former apprentice, Dorgon Heamilolothtar.",
        "Possessions": "Malanthus lived in several places in his time. For several years, he dwelled in the land later known as [[Turmish]]. He had a keep near the headwaters of the [[Fire River]] in the [[Earthfast Mountains]] in [[the Vast]], which was later apparently lost in an avalanche. He also had a mansion high up [[Mount Thulbane]] in [[Chessenta]], but fighting [[giant]]s tore it apart long after his passing."
