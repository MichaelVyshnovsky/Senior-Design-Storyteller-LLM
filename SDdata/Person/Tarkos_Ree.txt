Tarkos Ree was a crime lord in Damara in 1359 DR.
Tarkos was the cousin of Dimian Ree, baron of Morov.
Tarkos was the head of the Tightpurse thieves guild, being probably the most powerful being in Heliogabalus. He killed all people who crossed him and guilds members who did not follow Tarkos instructions. However, he truly protected the citys merchants from unaffiliated thieves. Tarkos also truly protected Dimian from the shadows.
Tarkos believed in logic, being purely pragmatic. He decided to support his cousins claim to the throne because the guild would greatly expand its sphere of influence if he won it.
