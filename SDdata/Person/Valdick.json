        "Activities": "The archwizard was a keen [[wildspace]] traveler, and enjoyed travelling to different [[crystal sphere]]s. However, Valdick didn't like the time it took to get from one sphere to another. Thus, he worked on formulating spells to make this method of travel much more convenient.",
        "History": "The great Valdick developed seven spells during his life, all of which were considered powerful. The first spell he invented was ''[[sink]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|2007|NY}}. In {{YearlinkConvert|2028|NY}}, Valdick had a breakthrough, inventing the epic ''[[Valdick's spheresail]]'' spell. After this, he developed ''[[gate]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|2037|NY}}, ''[[forcecage]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|2048|NY}}, ''[[maze]]'' and ''[[ensnarement]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|2059|NY}}, and lastly, ''[[astral spell]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|2068|NY}}."
