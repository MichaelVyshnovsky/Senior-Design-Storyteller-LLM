One of the Legions surprise attacks herded a troop of goblins by magical means through underground tunnels into the Targos docks, where Reig Redwaters and his partners, Brohn and Honest Jon, stood guard. Reig and Jon survived the attack, though Reig received a slash from a goblin axe, and Brohn was killed by an arrow to the neck. \nShortly after the attack began, the Wicked Wench docked, and a group of adventuring mercenaries from Luskan arrived to aid Targos. Reig greeted the adventurers, warning them of another band of goblins nearby, and asked them to find the harbor master Magdar Shenlen‎‎ and acquire some newly-arrived healing draughts for his wound. Reig Redwaters remained guarding the docks against goblin arsonists, as its safety was crucial to the towns survival."
