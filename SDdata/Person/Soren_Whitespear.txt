'''Soren Whitespear''' was a [[human]] man. He was a [[mercenary]] in the [[Red Brigade]] and later a [[bandit]] with the [[Vipers]].

==History==
Soren Whitespear and [[Cedric Ravajar]] were best friends for many years, before either of them joined the Red Brigade as mercenaries. When Cedric became captain, Soren was his second-in-command.

When Cedric disbanded the Brigade in [[1368 DR|the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], Soren went with his friend to join his newly founded bandit group, the Vipers, at the [[Vipers' Nest]]. Soren was reluctant at the idea, but became one of the senior members of the group.

==Personality==
Despite being a bandit, Soren hated raiding merchant caravans, considering it a waste of his warrior skills. Still, he took the lead in any raid, quick to engage caravan guards first.

==Abilities==
Soren loved a good battle, and usually fought bare-chested armed with both short sword and dagger simultaneously.

==Description==
Soren was 5 feet and 9 inches (1.7 meters) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kilograms). Though small and light, he had surprising power and grace, and great stamina. His hair was short, wavy, and blond, and he had pale blue eyes. He was clean-shaven but with a thick moustache with ends drooping past his mouth.

He had number of [[tattoo]]s to represent the groups he was a member of. Above each collarbone was a flaming sabre symbol of the Red Brigade. A snake to represent the Vipers was wrapped around his neck from jugular to the base of his skull.

==Possessions==
Soren fought with a [[short sword]], a magical [[dagger]], and a number of other daggers. He also wore a plumed helm with [[silver]] filigree.{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}
