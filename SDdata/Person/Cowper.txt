'''Cowper''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] who worked at the [[Mythallar Housing]] of [[Eileanar]] shortly before its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Activities==
Cowper worked variously alongside [[Dewez]], [[Haym]], and [[Salix]] as they guarded and monitored the ''[[mythallar]]s'' on their regular shifts at the Housing, with Cowper appearing whenever assistance was needed.
