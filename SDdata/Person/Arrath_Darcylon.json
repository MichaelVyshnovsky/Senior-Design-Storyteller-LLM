        "mainbody": "'''Arrath Darcylon''', known as the '''Wandering Bard''', was an itinerant writer active in [[Faerûn]] sometime between the 8{{th}} and mid-to-late 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].\n\nArrath once wrote of encountering a [[Triadic knight]] dedicated to [[Ilmater]] and marveling at her resilience.\n{{quote|I met a mighty warrior on the road. Her sword was shattered, her face was scarred, and she carried with her a bloody saddle. I offered her a ride in my cart, but she graciously declined, saying that she had to walk the path Ilmater had set before her. Within her eyes burned a fire the likes of which I've never seen. This warrior, I imagined, had fought horrors that would crush the spirit of any common man.|Arrath Darcylon, the Wandering Bard}}"
