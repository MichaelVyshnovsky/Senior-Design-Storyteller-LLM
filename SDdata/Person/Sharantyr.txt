==History==
Sharantyr was born in [[Baldur's Gate]] to the merchant [[Zunzyr Thalomm]] and his wife [[Nathla]]. During her younger years she traveled a lot with her parents through the [[North]] until they were killed by some [[troll]]s.

Sharantyr wandered for a time until she met and befriended the ranger [[Thauntyr]], who raised her for twenty years, teaching her all about a ranger's skills.

After her foster father's death, Sharantyr went adventuring but was soon captured by [[drow]] slavers. She was rescued from the [[Underdark]] by the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] and they suggested she join them because of her skill with the sword. She went on many adventures with the Knights. Sharantyr's main exploit, however, was in [[1358 DR]] when she was chosen by [[Elminster Aumar]] first to fight the [[Zhentarim]] in [[High Dale]] and later with the [[Rangers Three]] to contest the [[malaugrym]]s' plots during the [[Time of Troubles]].

She fought alongside her fellow Knights during [[Second battle of Shadowdale]] that same year. When Sharantyr and [[Storm Silverhand]] discovered Elminster's apparent death at [[Morningdawn Hall]] in [[Shadowdale]], Sharantyr was forced to arrest the adventurers [[Midnight]] and [[Adon]].
