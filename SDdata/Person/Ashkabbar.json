        "mainbody": "Ashkabbar was an orc leader in Blingdenstone.\nIn 1478 DR, Ashkabbar led a group of orcs into a section of Blingdenstone. They started raiding the deep gnome settlers led by Kargien Dissengulp until, in 1479 DR, an adventuring party hired by Kargien defeated Ashkabbar and forced the orcs to abandon the city.\nAshkabbar usually stayed in his camp with four burly female orcs with him at all times."
