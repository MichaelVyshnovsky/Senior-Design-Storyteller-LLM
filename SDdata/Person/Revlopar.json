        "mainbody": "Revlopar Twin-tailed was a mutant ixzan of the city of Malydren in the Underdark in the late 14 century DR.\nCirca 1370 DR, Revlopar was a member of theÂ Xendreth, the ruling council of Malydren.\nRevlopar had a secret desire to explore the Realms Above so that he might learn new spells and magic, but until then he waited while he cultivated and developed his current powers.\nRevlopars mutation, that is, have two tails, permitted him to cast spells as wizards of other races did, rather than being limited to a fixed set of innate magical abilities like most ixzan. For this reason, he was considered a spellcasting prodigy by most other ixzan.\nRevlopar studied magic under Erqynak Icebreath, an elderly ixzan magical research."
