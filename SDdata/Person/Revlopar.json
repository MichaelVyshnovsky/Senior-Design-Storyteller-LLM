        "Abilities": "Revlopar's mutation, that is, have two tails, permitted him to cast spells as [[wizard]]s of other races did, rather than being limited to a fixed set of innate magical abilities like most ixzan. For this reason, he was considered a spellcasting prodigy by most other ixzan.",
        "Relationship": "Revlopar studied magic under [[Erqynak|Erqynak Icebreath]], an elderly ixzan magical research."
