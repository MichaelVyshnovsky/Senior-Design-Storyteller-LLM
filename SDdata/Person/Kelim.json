In 1492 DR, Kelim and his fellows descended into Undermountain. There, Kelim lost his companions and, wandering around, found a lost spellbook. This however caused the emergence of some gricks that immediately tried to kill Kelim. He sealed himself in a closet. He planned to get out when the gricks were distracted or asleep but was too scared to leave."
