        "Personality": "Kelim was an unreliable coward capable to doing anything in order to survive.",
        "History": "Kelim was a member of the [[Fine Fellows]], an adventuring company from Daggerford. In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Kelim and his fellows descended into [[Undermountain]]. There, Kelim lost his companions and, wandering around, found a lost [[spellbook]]. This however caused the emergence of some [[grick]]s that immediately tried to kill Kelim. He sealed himself in a closet. He planned to get out when the gricks were distracted or asleep but was too scared to leave."
