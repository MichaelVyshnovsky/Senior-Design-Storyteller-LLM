        "History": "In the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Halish among a group of people who visited the [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. There, he partook in the three-day-long ritual of Mystra's Sacred Trust that the priests there were pushing, alongside eleven others: [[Durgen Glintstone]], [[Kareem Hastith]], [[Smote]], [[Tholwick Styles]], [[Dava]], [[Mendios]], [[Zephan]], [[Veera Wavecrest]], [[Duncan]], [[Kenniwick]], and [[Amnic Basult]].\n\nIn the end, Starweaver [[Deinyn Fembrys]] [[Dominate person|''dominated'']] all of them with the ''[[Starry Gnosis]]'', abducting them as part of a secret [[Shar]]ran plot. Beneath the temple, the Sharrans sent Halish through the [[Shadow Gate]], a failed ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Plane of Shadow]]. He survived the process, but was transformed into a creature of shadow himself.\n\nFollowing instructions, Halish was among those put on [[Mhair]]'s boat across the [[Wyvernflow]], before journeying overland to the [[Vast Swamp]] and the [[Lost Refuge]] within.",
        "Abilities": "Once a day, for some ten minutes Halish could call upon a shadow mantle, making him a [[dark]] creature, partially of shadow. In this state, he was able to see in the dark, could move swiftly, was highly resistant even to intense cold, and could move stealthily, even able to disappear into the shadows whilst observed. This made his skin appear gray and he was shrouded in shadows.\n\nIn battle, Halish preferred melee combat with his morningstar, but was intelligent and tactical in his use of divine spells.",
        "Equipment": "Halish was equipped with [[banded mail]], a [[light shield|light steel shield]], and a [[morningstar]], all of masterwork craftsmanship, as well as a [[light crossbow]] and bolts. He also owned a ''[[cloak of resistance]] +1'' and a [[silver]] [[holy symbol]] of Mystra, as well as a ''[[scroll]] of [[bull's strength]]'', a ''scroll of [[dispel magic]]'', and a ''[[potion]] of [[cure light wounds]]''."
