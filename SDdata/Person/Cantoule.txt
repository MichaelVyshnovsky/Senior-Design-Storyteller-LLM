'''Cantoule''' was a male [[human]] [[monk]] and a member of the [[Disciples of St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred]] at the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]] in the 14th century [[DR]]. He was the head of the monastery, holding the rank of Grand Master of Flowers.

==History==
Cantoule was born ''circa'' [[1319 DR]].

In the [[1359 DR|Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR]], Grand Master [[Poke]] died suddenly. This necessitated that [[Kane]], a Master of Spring and next-in-line for the position of Grand Master, hurry back to the monastery and manage affairs until a new Grand Master could be trained and selected. However, Kane declined to hold the position for any length of time. After Kane, the next in line was a man named [[Temmenische]], who was 95 years old, so he was hardly a practical choice. Although Cantoule was not in line for the position of Grand Master of Flowers, was not an obvious choice, and aged about 40 was considered rather too young, Kane and Temmenische decided he would be the most suitable successor. Thus, Cantoule was pressed into the position of Grand Master of Flowers, and Kane and Temmenische put Cantoule through accelerated training in advanced techniques to prepare him for the post.

As Grand Master, Cantoule continued his lessons while managing the Monastery of the Yellow Rose, a task for which he appeared quite capable. Since he took over in 1359 DR, the monastery enjoyed peaceful times and affairs proceeded smoothly with well-worn tradition.

However, the first test of his leadership would be a vital one: deciding which of the would-be kings of Damara the monastery should throw its support behind. Cantoule appeared to favor the heroic [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], an adventuring companion of Kane. Gareth became king later in 1359 DR.

In the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]] , on [[Mirtul 25]], the Monastery of the Yellow Rose was besieged by a flight of maddened [[chromatic dragon]]s. sent by [[Sammaster]] to prevent anyone from finding lore pertaining to the [[Rage of Dragons]] sweeping across [[Faerûn]] at the time. Cantoule led the defenders against this threat, aided by the hunters [[Dorn Graybrook]] and [[Raryn Snowstealer]], the [[copper dragon]] [[Chatulio]], and the [[song dragon]] [[Kara]]. The siege lasted for several days, before [[metallic dragon]]s departed their refuge in the [[Galena Mountains]] and routed the chromatic dragons on [[Flamerule 11]]. The monastery community was nearly destroyed in the battle.

==Description==
By 1373 DR, Cantoule appeared as an aging, thin, bronze-skinned man. He wore gray vestments, like all [[monk]]s of the Yellow Rose, a red [[skullcap (cap)|skullcap]], and a yellow rose-embroidered [[sash]].

==Activities==
Cantoule freely welcomed visitors to the monastery, and if they seemed good of heart, he might even grant a private audience if desired. He took an active role in many important events that occurred in the southern [[Earthspur Mountains]] where the monastery was situated.
