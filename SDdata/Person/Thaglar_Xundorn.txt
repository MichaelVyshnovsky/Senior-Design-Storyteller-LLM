'''Thaglar Xundorn''' was a [[duergar]] smith in [[Skullport]] and Laird of Sargauthan Hold.

==Personality==
Thaglar's title, bestowed on his father by the [[Deep King]] of [[Gracklstugh]], granted him the loyalty of most of Skullport's duergar, especially those of [[Clan Xundorn]].

==History==
Around [[1370 DR]], Thaglar was the proprietor of the only forge in the Port of Shadow and the lead authority among the duergar. One of their objectives was to check rumors of a [[mithral]] vein under [[Sargauth Enclave]].

In [[1375 DR]] Thaglar was busy opposing the concurrence of [[Murkstones]]'s products.

He was still in operation during the early 1490s [[DR]].
