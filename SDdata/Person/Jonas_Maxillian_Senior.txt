'''Jonas Maxillian Senior''' was the husband of [[Gravia Maxillian]] and father of [[Jonas Maxillian Junior]]. The entire family were secret [[werewolves]] who worked as [[apple]] orchard farmers in [[Daggerford]]'s [[Western Farmlands]] by day ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

{{quote|''So, like an unruly puppy, you've been sticking your nose in places it doesn't belong. Well, [[dog]]s are pack animals, and as such, it's about time the pack leader taught you a lesson in manners.''|Jonas Maxillian Senior}}

==Description==
Jonas Maxillian Senior was a middle-aged male with an intimidating physique. His arms were as thick as lumber and legs - like tree trunks. However, he had a charismatically pleasant attitude with instantly relaxed most who conversed with the man.

Curiously enough for an apple farmer, neither Jonas Senior nor Jonas Junior liked apples.

Chase, hunt, and trophies were precious to Jonas, and he proudly displayed them on the walls of his home.

==Possessions==
The [[Maxillian Manor]] and its apple orchards belonged to the werewolf family. The building was several centuries old, and underneath it was the Chase Maze. The Maze itself had only one exit and was the hunting ground for the bloodthirstily family where countless travelers and adventurers lost their lives.

The family's income came from the orchard. The apples were sold via local stands and sent to Daggerford's market. The apples that did not pass quality control were turned into [[Gravia's hot apple cider]], another product sold by Maxillians.

==Relationships==
Jonas Senior lovingly often called his son a "young pup" and mischievously winked at him. Even though he was warm towards his son, as they both shared the love for hunt and worship of [[Malar]], Jonas Senior's relationship with Gravia was tense as she lacked the family's bloodlust and refused to hunt folk for sport.

==History==
Jonas Maxillian Senior was the product of a several centuries-long bloodline of werewolves who worshiped Malar. The family's roots extend to the time when the valley of the Daggerford's Farmlands were wild and untamed. Many of the family perished, defending the land from wild beasts and monsters. However, some became stronger, blessed by the Beastlord. With time, the Maxillians became a lineage of lycanthropes and became secluded, keeping largely to themselves. [[Frederick Maxillian]], the progenitor's grandson, ''circa'' [[1272 DR]] built the Chase Maze under the family manor to feed the hunting instinct by night, in secrecy, while developing the land into a fruit orchard to sustain the family.

Jonas Senior was introduced into the family "business" of capturing adventurers and travelers when he was a young man. His father passed the "gift" of lycanthropy and indoctrinated him into the "survival of the strongest" family creed. His first victim was an [[elf|elven]] maid bathing in a stream. The present memory of her slaughter remained with Jonas for his entire life.

At some point later in life, Jonas encountered Gravia alone late at night. Seeing an opportunity, he captured and turned her into a lycanthrope and making her his wife. However, the change did not take as Gravia was a lesser lycanthrope and lacked her husband's hunting instinct and bloodthirstiness. Unwilling spouse, she birthed Jonas's son, Jonas Maxillian Junior, who inherited his father's bloodthirstiness.

In 1372 DR, Jonas Maxillian Senior and his son encountered the [[Hero of Daggerford]] who was passing through the Western Farmlands. The family charmed the adventurer and offered them a seat at the family's table celebrating Jonas Junior's birthday and a mug of [[Gravia's hot apple cider]]. The birthday cake and hot cider turned out to be a trap. The Hero was drugged and left naked in the Chase Maze underneath the Maxillian Manor.

Within the dungeon, the Hero met a fellow victim of the Maxillian family, a cheerful young [[gnome]] [[Pettywick Wocket]] who shared the rules of the chase with them and unveiled the way to beat the werewolves and escape. When Jonas Maxillian Senior opened the portcullis, the Hero had twenty seconds of a head start before the Junior was unleashed and tracked the unlucky adventurer in his beast shape. The Hero of Daggerford was successful and, after recovering the gear, managed to slay the father and the son. Freed from her husband, Gravia mourned her son and departed for the nearest temple of [[Sel√ªne]] as the goddess of the moon had goodly lycanthrope worshipers and she would be safe among her less bloodthirsty kin.
