Tooman Thendrik was a male drow cleric of Ghaunadaur from Szith Morcane that secretly led a cult of Ghaunadar worshipers.
Tooman maintained an unassuming appearance to hide his true allegiance. He dressed as a simple drow warrior.
As the leader of the outlawed cult of Ghaunadaur, Tooman Thendrik was loathe to bring attention to himself unless drow society was under grave threat. 
An experienced cleric of Ghaundaur, Tooman had a strong command of divine magic and was able to cast spells like Evards black tentacles and forbiddance in defense of his deity. In addition to this, his proficiency with martial weapons was such that he could pass himself off as a drow warrior if need be.
Utilizing an abandoned merchant warehouse as a shrine to Ghaunadaur, Tooman led both humanoid and non-humanoid members of his cult in worship of That Which Lurks.
Tooman carried magic studded leather armor, shield, and warhammer with him at all times and wore a periapt of wisdom that gave him great insight.
Tooman Thendrik rose to prominence among the low-class farmers and warriors of Szith Morcane during the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR. He gathered both drow and non-drow worshipers under him and created a shrine to Ghaunadaur in one of the many abandoned merchant houses of Szith Morcane. However when followers of Kiaransalee took control of the outpost, he worked to undermine and destabilize their authority from the shadows.
