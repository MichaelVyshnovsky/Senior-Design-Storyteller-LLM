'''Nythra of the Seven Rivers''' was a [[Rashemaar]] [[Hathran]] inhabiting [[Urling]] in [[Rashemen]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}.

==Activities==
Since the hathrans of Urling ran their affairs smoothly without the need for much intervention, Nythra served as the spokeswoman for Lady [[Yhelbruna]] and others. Nythra was quite friendly, even going so far as to speak openly with outsiders.
