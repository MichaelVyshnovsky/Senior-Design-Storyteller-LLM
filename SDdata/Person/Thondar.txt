Thondar was an inhabitant of the city of Wheloon in Cormyr and a member of the Purple Dragons.
Thondar held the position of Roadcaptain in the Purple Dragons and led road patrols around Wheloon in the 1350s DR.
During the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, Roadcaptain Thondar led a road patrol of fourteen Purple Dragons. They pursued Kelemvor Lyonsbane, Midnight, and Adon as they fled town on suspicion of murder, though they made a successful getaway.
As a Purple Dragon, Thondar wore chain mail. Unlike the rest of his patrol, he fought with a battleaxe and also had a wand of magic missile.
