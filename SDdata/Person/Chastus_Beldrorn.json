        "mainbody": "'''Chastus Beldrorn''' was a [[Heralds (local)|local herald]] based in [[Darromar]], [[Tethyr]], in [[1372 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Chastus was known to be enamored with his own importance and imperious to those who challenged his authority.",
        "Abilities": "As a [[Heralds of Faer√ªn|Herald]], he was an expert in blazonry and the protocol of nobility.",
        "Possessions": "Chastus Beldrorn was comfortably wealthy.",
        "Activities": "Chastus served the [[Marilyn Haresdown|Duchess of the Purple Marches]] in the capacity of Herald over non-noble blazonry, including miller's marks, guild symbols, merchant fleet flags, trading coster badges, and other symbols of commerce around Darromar.\n\nDuring his bitter squabble with [[Ilmurk Jongrath]], he hired some henchmen and led them against [[Jongrath's Mill]] in order to confiscate some newly painted shields displaying heraldic devices. Jongrath dissuaded them with a few well-placed crossbow bolts.",
        "Relationships": "Beldrorn and his fellow Herald from [[Myratma]], [[Aldrur Hariburt]], were particularly nettled by an amateur heraldist named Ilmurk Jongrath. They accused him of usurping their authority, undercutting their prices, and generally being unfit to practice heraldry in any capacity. Jongrath was not in violation of any law and the two heralds could not get [[Marilyn Haresdown|Duchess Haresdown]] to agree that official action should be taken against him. Consequently, Beldrorn and Hariburt resorted to spreading rumors in various circles that Jongrath was an outright thief, a [[Calishite]] spy, and a revolutionary out to overthrow the new (as of the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]]) power structure of [[Tethyr]]."
