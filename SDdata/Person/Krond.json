Patch notes state the following \"After a year of being looked down upon, Krond is now Chaotic Evil.\" \nKrond was a half-orc eldritch knight of the late 15 century DR.\nHe had grey skin and a black ponytail tied with a blue hair tie. He had a long scar that ran across his face. He was dressed in leathers with blue details, and had a blue scarf attached to it. He carried a book attached to his belt.\nAs an experienced eldritch knight, Krond had learned how to perform an arcane charge.\nKrond carried a bonded warhammer that he had named Unity.\nKrond was born to an academic human wizardess and a vicious chieftain of an orcish tribe that her mother was researching. As such he knew of both magic and warfare since a young age. Though he started his training as a warrior, after his mother died in a goblin raid he started focusing more on arcane arts."
