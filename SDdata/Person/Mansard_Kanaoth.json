        "mainbody": "'''Mansard Kanaoth''' was a Vindicator of the [[Warlock Knights]] of [[Vaasa]] and the only [[half-orc]] member of the ruling [[Ironfell Council]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. His holdings included both [[Palischuk]] and the newly restored [[Castle Perilous]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}",
        "Activities": "Mansard claimed to be descended from the [[Zhengyi|Witch-King Zhengyi]], and secretly adopted the title of Witch-King for himself. After Castle Perilous mysteriously rejuvenated in the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, he began amassing troops in secret nearby in preparation to usurp control of Vaasa from his fellow Ironfell Councilors.",
        "Personality": "Mansard was known as an influential member of the Ironfell Council. Among his vassals and allies, he was vocal in his desire to rule Vaasa and of his opposition to the [[Voice of Telos]]. His main philosophical argument was that the Voice of Telos was too concerned with venerating [[Telos]] when the Warlock Knights ought to have simply been using the [[primordial]] as a tool. He was more cautious and diplomatic when speaking with Warlock Knights not involved with his plot, but he still actively sought to build support for his claim to rule.",
        "Abilities": "As a Knight-Vindicator, Mansard was adept with both weapons and arcane magic, had access to ''[[ironfell]]'' equipment, and could channel the radiant powers of Telos.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}} He also practiced [[Zhengyian blood magic]], which allowed him to tap into traces of Zhengyi's dark power in his blood. While he undoubtedly used this to support his claim of being descended from the Witch-King, it was also possible for these dark powers to manifest in the descendants of individuals who merely came into contact with one of [[Zhengyi#Zhengyi.27s_relics|Zhengyi's evil relics]]."
