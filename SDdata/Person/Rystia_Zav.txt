'''Rystia Zav''' was a spy and a member of the [[Harpers]] from [[Nesme]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Rytsia had gone mad from loneliness, fear, and [[demon lord]]s' influence. She believed that all beings she met were killers sent after her.

==History==
In the late 1480s, she was tasked with the mission of finding [[Mantol-Derith]] and infiltrating the [[Zhentarim]] garrison there. However, Rystia became lost in the [[Underdark]]. ''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], she came to the gates of Mantol-Derith without knowing she had arrived or how.
