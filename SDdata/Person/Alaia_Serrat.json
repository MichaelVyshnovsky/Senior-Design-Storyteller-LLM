        "mainbody": "Alaia Serrat was a powerful human shaman and one of the three leaders of the merchant family House Serrat.  She was the adopted mother of the yuan-ti pureblood Zaltys Serrat.\nIn her youth, Alaia was considered attractive in an aloof way.\nUntil she lost most of her abilities due to her diminishing connection to the natural world, Alaia could cast powerful shamanic spells.  She had a spirit boar she used as a scout.\nIn 1362 DR while harvesting terazul blossoms in the jungles south of Delzimmer, guards from her caravan discovered a seemingly human infant girl and brought her back to camp.  The child was thought to be the last surviving member of a tribe that had been massacred by derro.  Having no children of her own and needing an heir, Alaia adopted the girl and named her Zaltys.\nIn 1479 DR Zaltys discovered that her tribe may have been enslaved rather than killed by derro and decided to enter the Underdark with her cousin Julen in search of survivors.  Zaltys and Julen were attacked by derro and she sent a psychic sending to the Serrat guard captain Krailash.\nAlaia and Krailash entered the Underdark with a small group of guards but were nearly killed by swordwings.  Alaia healed Krailash and he was shown the way to the derro settlement by an avatar of the yuan-ti god Zehir.\nIn the derro settlement, Alaia discovered that the terazul vines grew out of a portal to the Far Realm that had been opened by the derro.  Because the terazul trade was so important to House Serrats fortunes, Alaia made the decision to leave the plants alone.  Due to the fact that the Far Realm was so utterly opposed to the natural world of Faerûn, Alaias decision not to destroy the terazul vines caused her to lose her remaining connection to nature and thus her shamanic powers.  Krailash, however, sacrificed himself to close the portal and the terazul vines withered.\nDue to the destruction of the terazul plants, Alaias status in House Serrat was greatly diminished.  She decided to remain in the jungle to reconnect with nature and regain her shamanic powers.\nCategoryShamans\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Southeast Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Delzimmer\nCategoryMembers of House Serrat\nCategoryCaravan leaders\nCategoryMerchants\nCategoryWorshipers of Mielikki\n89mj8uxjnf9oauh6zfpd3dchje0bm6k"
