'''Brenna Graycloak''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]] and councilor for the village of [[Glarondar]] in [[Aglarond]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Description==
Brenna was very petite for a human, standing slightly above {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in height and slender and fair like an [[elf]]. She had tender brown eyes, round cheekbones, and a perky nose with a tip pointing slightly up. A pale complexion was a result of her spending long days in the libraries. Brenna's hair was long to her waist, with blue ribbons waved into it, dark red in color. She often smelled of [[lilac]].

==Personality==
Brenna was once a sheltered city-dweller ignorant of life in the larger world, but after a mission to [[Thay]], her mind was opened. Nevertheless, cities were her favorite places, and Brenna was always comfortable in a town. She was stubborn and wanted to be considered equal to her companions in all situations.

==Abilities==
Brenna was an accomplished magic user by 1362 DR, having access to spells like ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[charm]]'', ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[disguise self]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[knock]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', and ''[[web]]''. She used some uniquely modified spells like her ''[[lightning bolt]]'' that was cast using [[sulfur]] as a [[material component]]. Another ability of note was her being able to feel when she was been spied upon using a ''[[scrying]]'' spell.

==History==
[[File:Galvin Brenna and Wynter in Thay.png|thumb|288x288px|''Galvin, Brenna, and Wynter traveling to Thay the hard way.'']]
Brenna was born in Glarondar and rose through the ranks of politics until she became a member of the ruling council of Aglarond, where she sometimes served as the [[Simbul]]'s apprentice.

In the {{yearlinkName|1362}}, she was sent to ask the help of the [[Harpers]] [[Galvin]] and [[Wynter]] to investigate some trouble in [[Thay]] and Brenna decided to accompany them. Brenna proved indispensable during the missions, both for her magic powers and her knowledge of [[Thayan]] culture. She sacrificed her beloved beautiful locks, shaving her head and decorating it to appear as a Thayan noble during the mission. By the end of this perilous adventure, she came to love Galvin but knowing his dislike for her beloved cities, she said goodbye to him after the defeat of [[Maligor]].

She later became a [[Harper]] herself, however.
