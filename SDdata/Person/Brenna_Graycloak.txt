Brenna Graycloak was a human wizard and councilor for the village of Glarondar in Aglarond in the midâ€“14 century DR. 
Brenna was very petite for a human, standing slightly above  in height and slender and fair like an elf. She had tender brown eyes, round cheekbones, and a perky nose with a tip pointing slightly up. A pale complexion was a result of her spending long days in the libraries. Brennas hair was long to her waist, with blue ribbons waved into it, dark red in color. She often smelled of lilac.
Brenna was once a sheltered city-dweller ignorant of life in the larger world, but after a mission to Thay, her mind was opened. Nevertheless, cities were her favorite places, and Brenna was always comfortable in a town. She was stubborn and wanted to be considered equal to her companions in all situations.
Brenna was an accomplished magic user by 1362 DR, having access to spells like burning hands, charm, cone of cold, detect thoughts, disguise self, dispel magic, knock, tongues, and web. She used some uniquely modified spells like her lightning bolt that was cast using sulfur as a material component. Another ability of note was her being able to feel when she was been spied upon using a scrying spell.

Brenna was born in Glarondar and rose through the ranks of politics until she became a member of the ruling council of Aglarond, where she sometimes served as the Simbuls apprentice.
In the , she was sent to ask the help of the Harpers Galvin and Wynter to investigate some trouble in Thay and Brenna decided to accompany them. Brenna proved indispensable during the missions, both for her magic powers and her knowledge of Thayan culture. She sacrificed her beloved beautiful locks, shaving her head and decorating it to appear as a Thayan noble during the mission. By the end of this perilous adventure, she came to love Galvin but knowing his dislike for her beloved cities, she said goodbye to him after the defeat of Maligor.
She later became a Harper herself, however.
