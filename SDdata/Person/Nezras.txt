'''Nezras the Traitor''' was the infamous traitor that betrayed [[Myth Drannor]] by allying himself with the [[Army of Darkness]].

==History==
Nezras first arrived in Myth Drannor in [[683 DR]] and joined the [[Six Tyryl Towers]] magic school in search of [[magic]] to restore his granduncle's ''[[Unique Mageries]]'' tome. In [[686 DR]], he wed the [[elf]] [[sorceress]] [[Raejisa Sicafei]] after both graduated at Six Tyryl Towers.

At the start of  the [[Weeping War]], however, Nezras joined the Army of Darkness.

He fought with his master the [[lich]] [[Laummas]] in the decisive battle of [[Hammer 25]]â€“[[Hammer 29|29]], [[712 DR]], against the [[Harpers|Harpers at Twilight]], where most of the Harpers died. However, Laummas was destroyed by the Harper leader [[Dathlue Mistwinter]].

Nezras fought in another decisive battle that ended in a victory for the Army of Darkness on [[Kythorn 23]] of [[714 DR]]. In this battle, however, after the death of the [[elf]] Spell-Captain [[Phyrra Iliathorr]], the young [[moon elf]] [[Akh'Faer]] mage [[Juppar]] in a rage managed to defeat Nezras, who was presumed killed.

In truth, at the last moment, using some lost [[spell]], Nezras changed his position with another human traitor mage and survived. However, he turned into a [[lich]] and went into hiding. Around [[1014 DR]], the Harpers finally discovered the truth, believing him to be hidden in a lair in the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Relationship==
Nezras was the apprentice of the [[lich]] [[Laummas]]. He was the grandnephew of the [[Mulan]] archmage [[Nezram|Nezram the World-Walker]].

==Possessions==
''[[Nezras's mysterious chainmail]]'' was an oddly shapeless set of armor that belonged to Nezras before and during the events of the [[Weeping War]].

==Rumors==
A rumor said that after the [[Time of Troubles]] Nezras was restored to life and youth.
