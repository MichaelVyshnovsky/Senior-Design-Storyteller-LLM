Prince '''Hubadai Khahan''' was a [[Tuigan]] warrior and the son of [[Yamun Khahan]] during the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Standing over six feet tall, Hubadai was powerfully-built, with a scarred, broad face that sported a trim mustache and beard. His eyes were described as 'piercing'.

==Personality==
Hubadai was a strict commander, making him a challenging enemy. He was a loyal friend to those whom he trusted. He valued human life less than commanders from other cultures, allowing him to sacrifice troops in order to achieve his goals. He was a capable leader who was not afraid to join the fighting with his men. The driving force behind all of Hubadai's actions was the desire to please his father. People found him charmingly arrogant, and after his father's death, his motivation was to prove his people's faith in him was not unfounded.

==Possessions==
Hubadai owned a suit of magical [[lamellar]] armor, a magical sword, a ''[[ring of protection]]'', a ''[[ring of teleportation]]'', and a ''[[helm of reflection]]''.

==Activities==
Hubadai founded the nation of [[Yaïmmunahar]] three years after the death of his father, establishing the capital of [[Kourmira]] in [[1367 DR]].{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|54}}

==History==
During the [[Horde War]], Hubadai was tasked by his father with the conquest of [[Semphar]], which he accomplished with relative ease.

After the Tuigan loss at the conclusion of the Horde War, Hubadai did not immediately return home to the Endless Waste. Instead, he secretly visited several nations and cities over the next three years, including [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], [[Waterdeep]], and [[Zhentil Keep]], intending to learn from the people who had defeated his own. He determined that their loss was due to the fact that the Tuigan were not unified as a nation. When he returned home in the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, he declared himself khahan, and founded the nation of Yaïmmunahar. He won the support of the [[Commani]], [[Naican]], and [[Oigur]] tribes, then set to work building his new realm.<ref>{{Cite web enhancement/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|2}}
