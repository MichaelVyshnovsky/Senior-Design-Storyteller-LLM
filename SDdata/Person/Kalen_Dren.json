        "mainbody": "'''Kalen Dren''', also known as '''Shadowbane''', was a [[human]] [[paladin]] of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] who believed in the [[Heresy of the Threefold God|Threefold God]] and was the primary crusader of the [[Eye of Justice]]. He led a dual life as a member of an elite [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] guard unit and as a vigilante crime fighter. From birth, Kalen suffered from a [[spellscar]] that numbed his body. The lack of feeling aided him when fighting, but he did not experience pleasurable sensations as others did. Kalen believed that his spellscar would eventually kill him.\n{{quote|I will make of myself a darkness. A darkness where there is only me.|Kalen Dren<ref>}}",
        "History": {
            "Early Life": "The soldier Kalen was an orphan and was raised in [[Luskan]] by a [[rogue]] who took in children and used them in his criminal operation until age six. While at the \"orphanage\", he met a young [[halfling]] named [[Cellica]] and the two became close friends. As he was begging on the streets one day at age eight, he met the paladin [[Gedrin Shadowbane]], who gave him the sword ''[[Vindicator]]'', made him promise never to beg for anything again (Kalen's greatest vow), and cuffed him on the ear so he would remember the promise. Kalen joined Gedrin's church, the [[Eye of Justice]], and traveled to [[Waterdeep]] with Cellica where he was trained by [[Levia Shadewalker]].{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|269}}",
            "Waterdeep": "He joined the Waterdhavian [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] and was gravely wounded in a battle in the late 1470s DR. During the battle, he took an arrow intended for an officer named [[Araezra Hondyl]], saving her life. Although he recovered from his wounds, he continued to behave as though he was disabled so that no one would suspect that he was the vigilante Shadowbane. Araezra took Kalen on as her aide, though he wasn't expected to engage in combat because of his supposed disability.\n\nIn his Shadowbane persona, he roamed [[Downshadow]] in the upper levels of [[Undermountain]], rescuing damsels in distress and performing other noble deeds. On [[Tarsakh 24]] {{YearlinkName|1479}}, he intervened during a fight in Downshadow between a high-ranking priestess of [[Sune]], [[Lorien Dawnbringer]], and an [[evil]] [[dwarf]] [[monk]] known as [[Arrath Vir|Rath]]. This incident brought him into contact with members of his guard patrol who didn't recognize him because of his helm. Over the next few days, Kalen had several other encounters with the City Guard and even eluded them on a wild rooftop chase through Waterdeep. During one of the encounters, ''Vindicator'' was taken by Araezra, although she returned the sword several days later after she discovered that Kalen was Shadowbane.\n\nShortly afterwards, Kalen came upon a strange blue fog that contained a crying young woman with blue hair. The woman was [[Myrin Darkdance|Myrin]], whom he rescued and took back to the rowhouse he shared with Cellica. Myrin was a [[wizard]] from [[Westgate]] who had been trapped in an intradimensional space by the [[Spellplague]] for nearly 100 years. She had an extremely powerful spellscar that allowed her to use another person's magical abilities if they were near her. Myrin attracted the attention of [[Lilten]], the high [[cleric|priest]] of [[Beshaba]], who made several attempts to kidnap her.\n\nSeveral days later, Rath, one of Lilten's minions, was finally successful and abducted Myrin and took her to a belltower at the cost of murdering [[Cellica]] in Kalen's home the morning after Kalen's tryst with Fayne. The dead body of Cellica was delivered by Kalen to her adoptive family. Kalen then tracked Rath to Downshadow, where the two dueled. Rath jumped through a magical ''[[gate]]'' that led from Downshadow to the tower and Kalen followed and bested Rath by knocking him off the belltower. Rather than kill Rath, Kalen turned him over to the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]]. The price for his victory was his right hand mostly smashed during the conflict. In Myrin's farewell letter, Kalen learned he survived Rath's poison because she absorbed apart of it.\n\nAt some point in [[1479 DR]], Kalen took on a young apprentice named [[Vaelis]], the broadcrier boy from [[Waterdeep]]{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|549}} After his failure with Vaelis, he felt guilty and no longer worthy of wielding ''Vindicator''. In fact, the blade burned his hand, although, because of his spellscar, he hardly noticed.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|474}}",
            "Luskan": "On [[Kythorn 17]] {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Kalen as Shadowbane received a cryptic message that Myrin might be in trouble in Luskan and he traveled back to the city.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|467}} At the city gate, Kalen gave ''Vindicator'', which he no longer felt worthy of, to a young guardsman named [[Rhetegast Hawkwinter|Rhett]].{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|548}} While in Luskan, he was confronted by an enforcer for the [[Dead Rats]] gang, captured and brought to the Rat's tavern. Myrin had been captured by the Dead Rats earlier and, in order to keep her docile, had been told she was the new leader of the gang. Myrin convinced the Rats to release Kalen.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|?}}\n\nKalen spent time poking around the city with Myrin in search of the cause of the [[Fury]] plague that was sweeping Luskan. Kalen decided that Luskan needed more order so he spent ten days beating the rival gangs into submission. He then called a public meeting to select a king of Luskan. The meeting, which was attended by all the Luskan gangs, deteriorated into a huge melee. During the fighting, the [[demon]] [[Scour]] attacked, killing many people although Kalen and Myrin survived.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|5308}}\n\nLilten told Kalen and Myrin that Scour was in the Luskan underground. The duo, along with Rhett and [[Sithe]] found Scour and apparently destroyed him by [[Flamerule 8]].{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|6237}}",
            "Westgate": "Later, by [[Flamerule 24]] {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Kalen and Myrin traveled to [[Westgate]] in an attempt to determine what became of Rhett. While in Westgate, Kalen found that there were two others who claimed the Shadowbane title: Rhett and his first apprentice Vaelis, not dead after. Kalen fought and defeated Vaelis, cutting off his arm during the fight. Unbeknown to him, the fleeing Vaelis was rescued by [[Vampire|vampire lord]] [[Tebryn Dhialael|Kirenkirsalai]] who fed [[Hessar]] to the new spawn in the long abandoned [[House of Steel]] on [[Eleasis 3]].{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|5218}}"
        },
        "Description": "Kalen had a hard, grizzled face with the constant layer of brown stubble on his strong, tense jaw. His face was framed in the brown-black hair and had colorless pupils, like slits of glass. He was described as handsome by women. Although he had the ability to heal himself, he refused to use [[divine magic]] whenever he accidentally shed the blood of an innocent. Because of this, his body was covered with old scars. His body was covered in scarsâ€”knife cuts, arrow holes, burns. There was the finger-shaped lines on his forearm were the spellscar burns he had suffered in Downshadow the night he met Fayne, [[Tarsakh 24]] {{YearlinkName|1479}}. His tightly woven muscles carried not a drop of fat. For formal festive events, he wore a doublet.\n\nSeen at age fifteen in [[Hammer 12]] {{YearlinkName|1470}}, he had the awkward proportions of a boy not yet a man. Although he had clearly physically appeared to lived a hard life, and as such could be much younger than he looked. The structure of hard muscles was built into his frame and coupled with his intensity and raw physical presence, he would be an impressive specimen in a few years, in Levia's eyes.\n\nWhen relaxed to sleep, he casually slept fully naked.",
        "Personality": "Kalen was a soldier and paladin of his word, but possessed an inferiority complex and guilt born from his underdevelopment as a normal human due to his spellscar's effects. This inferiority complex propelled him to give up a chance to love Myrin in [[1479 DR]] and forcefully become friends. His religious belief was [[Heresy of the Threefold God|the Threefold God]] with a bias for illegal justice, guardianship and promises. Due to his dark upbringing as a child in [[Luskan]] until age eight, Kalen was a radical towards justice. Meeting [[Gedrin Thalavar|Gedrin]] allowed him to find a better life and higher calling as a [[paladin]], starting in [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Possessions": "Kalen wore [[leather armor]] and carried the magic [[bastard sword]] ''[[Vindicator]]'', a blade once used by the [[deity|god]] [[Helm]]. He wore a helmet to hide his identity as Shadowbane and had [[magic]] boots that allowed him to run faster and jump farther than normal humans could. He also wore gauntlets to support his crusades.",
        "Abilities": "Like the other wielders of magical [[bastard sword]] ''[[Ever Watchful|Vindicator]]'', Kalen could recall the sword to his hand, no matter where the sword was, and belted it at his waist. Kalen was able to summon grey spiritual armor to surround his body.{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|1665}} When attending formal events without the sword, he wore [[Dagger|daggers]] against the inside of his thighs and a dirk on his belt for self-defense and prior experience experience as a young thief. While skilled as a soldier, he could not dance.",
        "Relationships": "Kalen was life-long friends with [[Cellica]], whom he regarded as a sister. His vows as a paladin did not prevent him from taking lovers. He had a past relationship with his commanding officer, Araezra Hondyl, which seems to have ended amicably. In the {{YearlinkName|1479}},c Kalen slept with [[Fayne]], a [[fey'ri]] whose nose bridge height was equal to his lips' level, causing Myrin (who had a crush on Kalen) to be heartbroken when she saw them together. He had a close platonic relationship with [[Ilira]], one of [[Sune]]'s priestesses.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|2465}}"
