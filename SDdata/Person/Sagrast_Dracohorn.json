        "mainbody": "Sagrast Dracohorn was a member of the Dracohorn noble house of Cormyr, and steward of the Royal House of Obarskyr.\nIn 245 DR, Sagrast arranged to meet the High Wizard Baerauble Etharr in private at The Ram and Duck to discuss his plans for removing Iltharl Obarskyr from the throne. Sagrasts view was a view generally accepted at the time, that the king was not capable of making decisions and did not make a good ruler. He proposed arranging the marriage of Gantharla Obarskyr, Iltharls sister, to Kallimar Bleth, and waiting for them to produce a male heir so that the king would be pressured into stepping down. This proved to be unnecessary when Iltharl discovered the plot and chose to abdicate the throne to Gantharla, making her the first queen of Cormyr."
