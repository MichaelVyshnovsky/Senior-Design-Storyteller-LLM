Jalathleena was a mysterious planeswalking Chosen of Mystra who departed Toril by the 14 century DR.
Jalathleena found her magic gifts to be most useful in traversing the planes. She loved planar travel and petitioned with her deity, the Mother of All Magic, to venture into the vast multiverse on her behalf, procuring items, spells, wondrous items, plants, and sentient creatures, bringing them to Faer√ªn and lands beyond.
