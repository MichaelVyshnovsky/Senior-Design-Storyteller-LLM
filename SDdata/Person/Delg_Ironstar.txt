'''Delg Ironstar''', also called '''Delg Hammerhand''',

==Abilities==
He used a [[battle axe]]. He called upon [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] by singing a heroic, dwarven chant, which granted him additional, but unknown powers and skills in combat. When he did so, his axe and the [[warhammer]] he wielded off-hand began to glow.<ref>

==Relations==
Formerly of the Company of the Bright Spear, Delg was an adventuring companion of [[Shandril Shessair]] and [[Narm Tamaraith]].<ref>

==History==
He was one of the few survivors of the Company of the Bright Spear after they left [[The Rising Moon (inn)|The Rising Moon]] inn in [[Deepingdale]] and were ambushed by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}.<ref> Delg joined Shandril and Narm on their journey out of the [[Dalelands]] and into [[Cormyr]].<ref>

He was later killed by a [[gargoyle]] in the [[Stonelands]]. The creature lifted him up in the air, but was killed by Delg shortly after. Delg crashed to the ground, was impaled on a rock, and died.
