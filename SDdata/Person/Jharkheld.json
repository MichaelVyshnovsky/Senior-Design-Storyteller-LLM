        "mainbody": "'''Jharkheld''' was a magistrate at Luskan's [[Prisoners' Carnival]] in the late 1360s [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The magistrate was old and thin, and had a nasally voice. He was said to take a lot of pleasure in torturing his victims.",
        "History": "In the late 1360s [[DR]], he interrogated four suspects regarding the attempted assassination of Captain [[Deudermont]]. Jharkheld tortured the pirate assassins [[Creeps Sharky]] and [[Tee-a-nicknick]] to death. He was keen to carry on his show and kill [[Morik]] and [[Wulfgar]], but Deudermont himself intervened, and the pair were spared."
