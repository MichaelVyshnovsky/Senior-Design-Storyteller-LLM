        "mainbody": "'''Amandarn''' was a [[rogue]] and adventurer in the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He considered himself sufficiently short, being slim, almost child-sized, and boyish. He was taller than a [[dwarf]], however.",
        "Personality": "As an adventurer, he saw himself as more of a \"wealth redistributor\" than a thief.",
        "Possessions": "He carried a ''[[glowblade]]'' and wore at least one black glove. His adventuring group later came to jointly own a castle.",
        "Relationships": "He was part of a group of adventurers together with [[Nuressa]], [[Iyriklaunavan]], and [[Folossan]].",
        "History": "On a warm day in [[Mirtul]] in the {{yearlinkName|759}}, the group Amandarn was with ran into a [[Netherese]] tomb. They spotted a [[Elminster|wizened corpse]] floating up near the ceiling, and a pair of pillars in a large room; after Iyriklaunavan struck the corpse with a spell, bringing it down, the pillars sprouted eyes and attacked with hundreds of rays.\n\nAfter managing to get away from the pillars of eyes, which the corpse attacked and destroyed, they were approached by the corpse, which asked them what year it was. Nuressa replied with the date, to which the corpse immediately ''teleported'' away. The team decided to flee the tomb and leave it unexplored.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|517-518|Prologue}}\n\nLater, it turned out that Amandarn had gambled all their money away shortly after; Folossan nearly killed him for it. The two stole back some of their coin, got caught, and fled. After spending the evening under an altar to [[Mystra]], they found a small fortune and a deed to a castle by morning, which they presented to the rest of the team. Iyriklaunavan believed them, but only because he magically verified their account of their misdeeds.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|735-736|19}}"
