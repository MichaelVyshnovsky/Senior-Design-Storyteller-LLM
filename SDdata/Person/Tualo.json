        "mainbody": "ualo, usually known as Tualo the Bright, was a wizard living in Neverwinter in 1484 DR.\nHe was interested in studying the effects of the Spellplague. Tualo met and befriended an elven wizard, Rhazzad, who had the same interest. Unfortunately, Rhazzad had a vicious plan in mind and used Tualo as a pawn. Rhazzad gave Tualo a book describing methods for studying the Spellplague.  Contained within the book was a trap, however, and when Tualo performed a certain ritual described within, a portal to the Far Realm opened. The entities of that dimension killed Tualo and escaped. The portal was closed only when an adventurer sent by Sergeant Knox arrived at Tualos house in order to question him about Rhazzad, who had come under the Watchs scrutiny for his suspect actions. Thank to Tualos assistant and some letters, the adventurer discovered the dealings between Rhazzad and Tualo."
