Tualo met and befriended an [[elf|elven]] [[wizard]], [[Rhazzad]], who had the same interest. Unfortunately, Rhazzad had a vicious plan in mind and used Tualo as a pawn. Rhazzad gave Tualo a book describing methods for studying the Spellplague.  Contained within the book was a trap, however, and when Tualo performed a certain ritual described within, a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Far Realm]] opened. The entities of that dimension killed Tualo and escaped. The ''portal'' was closed only when an adventurer sent by Sergeant [[Knox]] arrived at Tualo's house in order to question him about Rhazzad, who had come under the Watch's scrutiny for his suspect actions. Thank to Tualo's assistant and some letters, the adventurer discovered the dealings between Rhazzad and Tualo."
