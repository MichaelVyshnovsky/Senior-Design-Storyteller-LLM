'''Heyman Arst''' was an inhabitant of the [[Rivington]] neighborhood of the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Heyman Arst attempted to report that carts of children's toy donations to be distributed to the refugees of the [[Absolute crisis]] had been sabotaged by some bad-faith actors. Despite the claim being true—the toys were rigged to explode using [[Felogyr's Fireworks|Felogyr's]] [[fireworks]] by the agents of the [[Absolute]] in the [[Cult of Bane]]—the reports made to [[Liara Portyr]]'s garrison were dismissed as Heyman Arst failed to provide evidence of his claims.
