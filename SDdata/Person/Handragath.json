        "mainbody": "'''Handragath''' was a ranking [[Cult of the Dragon]] member who operated out of the ruins of [[Darnarest's tower]], luring would-be adventurers into the hands of his slavers ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "He was {{SI|6'|'\"|long=yes}} tall.",
        "Personality": "Handragath was a cruel man, a slaver, and a wizard who experimented on his captives. He hid this well, however, behind a friendly face, diplomatic approach, and abundant charisma.",
        "Abilities": "As the undercover member of the Cult of the Dragon, Handragath was a skilled spy, capable of gathering intel, proficient in diplomacy, and knowledgeable in the realm of the arcane.\n\nAs a [[wizard]], Handragath had access to low-level arcane spells, ''[[detect poison]], [[charm person]], [[mage armor]], [[ray of enfeeblement]], [[alter self]], [[protection from arrows]], [[summon swarm]], [[flame arrow]], [[stinking cloud]]'', and ''[[enervation]]'' being some of them.",
        "Possessions": "Handragath was armed with a masterwork ''[[claw bracer]]'' to defend himself in battle and have his hands free for spellcasting. He used a ''+1 [[amulet of natural armor]]'' for protection, and had ''[[wand]]s'' of ''[[Wand of magic missiles|magic missiles]]'' and of ''[[Wand of fear|fear]]'' hidden in his robes. He carried a ''[[potion of healing|potion of cure serious wounds]]'', eight [[pearl]]s, and a handful of [[gold]] and [[silver]] [[coin]]s in the pockets of his hooded [[robe]].",
        "Relationships": "Handragath's ''[[familiar]]'' was a male [[viper]] named [[Rexin]]",
        "History": "In 1369 DR, the Cult of the Dragon was led by [[Kya Mordrayn]] to occupy the ruins of Myth Drannor, corrupt its ''[[mythal]]'', and tap into the powers of a ''[[pool of radiance]]'' found under [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The Cult needed a constant supply of workers, which they got through slavery. One such operation was helmed by Handragath, who disguised himself as an elderly distant relative of [[Darnarest]], the wizard whose tower was being used as the Cult's outpost, to send adventurers and townsfolk into the hands of the cult.\n\nHe sent a group of heroes into the ruins on a false quest to recover ancient writings of the tower's long-dead owner, while the Cult prepared an ambush to capture the able-bodied slaves-to-be. With the capture failing, the heroes made their way to Darnarest's tower, realizing that the Cult of the Dragon was behind recent villager disappearances. The heroes confronted the cultists but found no captured civilians, but only empty shackles. Handragath managed to escape through the portal to Myth Drannor before the heroes were able to slay him. But they saw the false benefactor grab a handful of magical [[salt]] and throw it into a [[brazier]] in the tower's basement, followed by Handragath jumping through the portal. The heroes followed, but Handragath was long gone."
