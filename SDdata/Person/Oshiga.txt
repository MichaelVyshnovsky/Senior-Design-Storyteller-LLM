'''Oshiga''' was a [[trumpet archon]] in service to [[Erathaol]] .

==History==
Oshiga had been in service to Erathaol on [[Mount Celestia]] for a long time.

Just after the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], Oshiga and other five councilors judged the revelations of the [[deva]] [[Eirwyn]], who with her allies had come to advise them of a [[fiend]]ish threat to Celestia.
