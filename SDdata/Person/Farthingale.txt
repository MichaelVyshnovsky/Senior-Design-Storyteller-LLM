'''Manip Farthingale''' was a [[Flaming Fist]] sergeant from the [[Baldur's Gate/Stonyeyes|Stonyeyes]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Manip Farthingale oversaw the arrest and conviction of criminals from the [[Stonyeyes Precinct]] of the Flaming Fist. During [[The Absolute]] Crisis, Farthingale handled two prisoners of note: [[Durm Goroy]] and [[Vince Torell]]. Torell was accused of being a spy for the Absolute and treason, while Goroy was arrested after being accused of an assassination attempt on Lord [[Enver Gortash]]. Both were tried and condemned to public execution. Manip Farthingale sent a [[pigeon]] letter to [[Manip Seyama]] of the [[Basilisk Gate]], notifying her of the two prisoners being transferred soon to the Basilisk Gate, to be publicly executed in the plaza in front of the gate.
