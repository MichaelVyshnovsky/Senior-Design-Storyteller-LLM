        "History": "''Circa'' 1989 CE, Elkwhisker visited [[Earth]] and spoke to occasional [[Dragon (magazine)|''Dragon'' magazine]] contributor [[John M. Maxstadt]] about his world. Usually, anyway. Other times it was just random stuff like Halloween masks or pet rocks and things. Meanwhile, Maxstadt took notes, drank madeira, and nodded off. Fortunately, tape recorders still existed back then and caught some of their exchanges.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = It must not be supposed that all the mages of old were wise, clever, or even mentally competent.\n| source = Elkwhisker, actually saying something useful\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nOne time, Elkwhisker actually talked about the notorious [[Nimrod of Nump]] and his various [[spell]]s and [[magical item]]s.

        "Personality": "Elkwhisker had a habit of smugly making irrelevant statements to get people's interest, before he bored them to tears and/or sleep. He mistook yawns for awe."
