Jouka Tunkelo was a gnome inhabiting the Samek Valley who helped defeat the ice devil Vreesar in 1366 DR.
Jouka wore a strange "badger-fighting suit", which was a sort of spiked body armor. With it, he would damage enemies by embracing them.
Jouka was one of the few who offered help to the Harper Martine in her fight against the Burnt Fur gnoll tribe led by the ice devil Vreesar.
