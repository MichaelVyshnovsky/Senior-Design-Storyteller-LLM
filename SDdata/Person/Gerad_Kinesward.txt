{{quote|My mistress sent me out here to gather up her lost specimens, but I've just discovered I have a terrible fear of getting killed by orcs!|Gerad Kinesward}}

==Relationships==
Gerad's mistress was [[Riftel Farsight]] of the [[Neverwinter Guard]]. Riftel believed Gerad would do well to gain some more practical experience in the field, and learn to get herself out of difficult situations such as those she sent her into.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, after the [[Siege of Neverwinter]], Gerad was tasked with recovering Riftel's six [[elemental weevil]] specimens from [[Mount Hotenow]] after they had become lost. This meant going into the embattled [[Neverwinter/River District|River District]] of Neverwinter, and Gerad was terrified of [[Many-Arrows]] [[orc]]s and was forced to cower and hide in Pedlars Path. If an adventurer found her, she begged them to find and deliver the lost elemental weevils.
