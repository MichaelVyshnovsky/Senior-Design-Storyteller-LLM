'''Rodolfo''' was the most veteran navigator of the [[Trackless Sea]].

==History==
Rodolfo was a sailor who knew the Trackless Sea very well. He once acted as fleet commander for the [[Golden Legion]]. Afterward, he retired but, in [[1361 DR]], Rodolfo accepted an offer to act as fleet commander for [[Don Vaez]]'s expedition to [[Maztica]] after the [[Council of Six]] offered him a large amount of money.
