Lord '''Queylar Karrault''' was a [[death knight]] in the service of [[Thay]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Lord Queylar was in [[Szass Tam]]'s service for a very long time.

Around [[1479 DR]], the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] sent Lord Queylar and his retinue of two [[Red Wizards]] and three [[wyvern]]s to the [[Daggerford]] region with the goal of finding and slaying a band of [[adventurer]]s who, with the help of [[Isteval|Sir Isteval]], had ruined their plans.

The force from Thay eventually confronted the adventurers at the ruins of [[Dragonspear Castle]].

==Personality==
Queylar was a cold creature with the sense of entitlement of a noble. He'd grown bored of fighting over time. He took no more pleasure in killing.

==Possessions==
Queylar wielded a ''[[nine lives stealer]]'' called [[Hunter (stealer)|Hunter]].
