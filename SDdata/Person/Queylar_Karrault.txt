Lord Queylar Karrault was a death knight in the service of Thay in the 15 century DR.
Lord Queylar was in Szass Tams service for a very long time.
Around 1479 DR, the Red Wizards of Thay sent Lord Queylar and his retinue of two Red Wizards and three wyverns to the Daggerford region with the goal of finding and slaying a band of adventurers who, with the help of Sir Isteval, had ruined their plans.
The force from Thay eventually confronted the adventurers at the ruins of Dragonspear Castle.
Queylar was a cold creature with the sense of entitlement of a noble. Hed grown bored of fighting over time. He took no more pleasure in killing.
Queylar wielded a nine lives stealer called Hunter.
