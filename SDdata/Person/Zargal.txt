Zargal, along with Malkax, and Geltik, were hobgoblin bandits who ambushed travelers of the Red Canyons, Sword Coast, in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Zargal wore a studded leather jerkin, a horned helmet, several valuable knickknacks, and wielded the Whistling Sword.
As of 1368 DR, Zargal with his two hobgoblin cronies confronted travelers and demanded all their valuables in exchange for the travelers lives. If refused, Zargal attacked, while claiming to be the "strongest there is."
