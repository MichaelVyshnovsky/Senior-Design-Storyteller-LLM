'''Sanfin Lotte''' was a gossip writer in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1479 DR]].

==Activities==
Sanfin spent all his time inside the [[Yawning Portal]] inn. He gained money by supplying stories to the city's various broadsheets but also sold secrets to the highest bidders and even blackmailed someone if the opportunity arose. In truth, he used the information he gathered to manipulate his power-player clients, both in Waterdeep and [[Undermountain]].

==History==
In 1479 DR, Sanfin's parakeet had started to venture inside Undermountain together with some adventuring parties but always went back before them.

==Relationship==
Sanfin's constant companion was the [[parakeet]] [[Chloe]], well loved by all staff and customers of the inn.
