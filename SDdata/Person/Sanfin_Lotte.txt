Sanfin Lotte was a gossip writer in Waterdeep in 1479 DR.
Sanfin spent all his time inside the Yawning Portal inn. He gained money by supplying stories to the citys various broadsheets but also sold secrets to the highest bidders and even blackmailed someone if the opportunity arose. In truth, he used the information he gathered to manipulate his power-player clients, both in Waterdeep and Undermountain.
In 1479 DR, Sanfins parakeet had started to venture inside Undermountain together with some adventuring parties but always went back before them.
Sanfins constant companion was the parakeet Chloe, well loved by all staff and customers of the inn.
