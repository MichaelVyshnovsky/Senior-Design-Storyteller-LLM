"Ferret" Jones was a notorious smuggler who made enemies out of Zhentarim in the 14 century DR.
Ferret was armed with en enchanted +2 short sword and owned a ring of invisibility.
"Ferret" Jones was born into the life of crime. His father was a smuggler, and Ferret took on the same trade as he reached adulthood. Unfortunately, unlike his dad, Ferret became notorious for his bad luck, often losing supplies and shipments. This did not earn him any friends, and only angered his clients, such as the Zhentarim. Unbeknownst to all, however, Jones was pocketing the "lost" shipments, stockpiling them in a secure spot for future use.
