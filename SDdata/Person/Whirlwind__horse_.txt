The Whirlwind was a legendary horse living in Zakhara in 1367 DR.
The Whirlwind had a vicious temperament and actually appeared to enjoy fighting.
Shod with special steel shoes, the Whirlwind performed devastating attacks with his rider during raids on caravans traveling between Huzuz and Halwa.
The Whirlwind was ridden by Fasim Kaldur, the leader of the Riders of Blood.
One rumor stated that Fasim was about to fall before a swarm of enemies, but his horse brutally attacked them in a whirlwind of bites and kicks, saving Fasims life in the process.
