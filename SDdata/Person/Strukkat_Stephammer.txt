'''Strukkat Stephammer''' was an experienced [[dwarf|dwarvish]] [[artificer]]-for-hire from the city of [[Neverwinter]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Strukkat Stephammer had years worth of experience in artificery. However, he began experiencing failing eyesight, which diminished his capabilities to a degree. Despite that, he was still a skilled and hard worker. He made a living by selling his armorer's services to the adventurers and defenders of [[Neverwinter]].
