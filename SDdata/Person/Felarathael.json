        "Activities": "They were the primary servitors of Corellon, most commonly acting as his messengers on [[Toril]] but also defending mortal elves under threat.",
        "Description": "Felarathael and Lashrael were identical twins, with both appearing as tall, beautiful and androgynous elves of no particular race, with shining bodies and wearing gleaming white robes.",
        "Personality": "Despite being twins, the two had very different personalities. Felarathael was a being of pure rationality. Regardless of the situation, Felarathael considered things with calm detachment and logical reasoning. His speech, though slow and measured, was always with great reassurance. In battle, too, Felarathael was patient but skilled.",
        "Abilities": "In battle, rather than deal injury to a struck opponent, Felarathael and Lashrael could cause the victim to ''[[sleep]]'' without fail, suffer from amnesia, be [[polymorph]]ed into the form of a forest [[animal]], or be randomly [[teleport]]ed {{SIrange|1|10|mile|k|long=yes}} away.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1379}}, Felarathael and Lashrael went together to the [[Fugue Plane]] under the orders of Corellon Larethian to retrieve the soul of the slain [[drow]] [[Cavatina Xarann]], a [[Darksong Knight]] of [[Eilistraee]]. They explained to her that a few hundreds of the followers of Eilistraee had been turned back back to their original [[dark elf|dark elven]] form, and that Cavatina was among them, thanks to the sacrifice of [[Qilu√© Veladorn]]. Felarathael and Lashrael led her to [[Arvandor]], as they claimed that the transformed drow would be allowed into the elven [[afterlife]]."
