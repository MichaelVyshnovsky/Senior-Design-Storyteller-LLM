Lord Haedro Sornstern was a nobleman from Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
He was the father of Delasko Sornstern.
Haedro Sornstern had a hobby he liked to learn of adventuring lore, and collecting relics.
He had, some years prior to 1479 DR, helped hide the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar, for which Elminster let him learn of the fate of the Nine and how they were imprisoned in blueflame items after being lured into an assignment by a merchant from Athkatla.
