        "Description": "Andrella was usually described as a prim, proper lady.",
        "Activities": "As the head barmaid of the Beached Leviathan, Andrella managed the day-to-day affairs of the inn and tavern. Because of that, the other staff members referred to her as the \"Mate\" or the \"First Mate\", something that she accepted as a bittersweet joke. She was also very protective of [[Harrag]], the Beached Leviathan's owner, trying to protect him from [[Dagult Neverember]]'s plots whenever possible.",
        "History": "At some point before [[1479 DR]], Andrella's husband was killed because some gambling debts, and she lost everything. Sometime later, she met Harrag, who, out of compassion, hired her to be a barmaid in the then recently opened Beached Leviathan. Over time, Andrella fell in love with Harrag, but never confessed her true feelings because of Harrag's \"free spirit\" personality.\n\nIn 1479 DR, a group of [[Ashmadai]] cultists summoned two [[devil]]s and attacked the Beached Leviathan, mind-controlling some of the patrons present at the moment. Andrella was present during the fight, but luckily was saved by a group of [[adventurer]]s."
