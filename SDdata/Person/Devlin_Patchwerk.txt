'''Devlin Patchwerk''' was a member of the [[Shadow Thieves]] and brother of [[Mishad Patchwerk]] who resided in the stronghold within [[Undermountain]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Devlin Patchwerk was rude but not aggressive like many of his guild-mates. He was not the smartest person in the dungeon and could be easily misled to reveal the [[illusion]] hiding the Shadow Thieves' stronghold entrance.

==History==
In [[1370 DR]], Devlin Patchwerk was stationed in the caves to guard the Shadow Thieves' hideout entrance. The guild was thought to be purged from [[Waterdeep]], but in secret, they'd established a base of operations under the City of Splendors in one of the top layers of Undermountain. When the guild's return was discovered by [[Khelben Arunsun]], he knew it was an immediate danger to the [[Lords of Waterdeep]], and he outfitted a lone adventurer to uncover the thieves' base, marked with a holy symbol of [[Mask]]. The adventurer encountered Devlin Patchwerk standing guard, who was easily misled into revealing the stronghold entrance.
