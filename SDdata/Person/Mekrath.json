        "mainbody": "Mekrath was a powerful elven wizard in Athkatla, Amn. \nMekrath held a very important gem in his altar. His captive, HaerDalis claimed that it was stolen from him by the wizard. He fought with a quarterstaff, and wore a robe of fire resistance.\nThe wizard set up his lair above the Athkatlan sewers. Mekrath was not very tolerant of visitors, especially thieves, and when he found HaerDalis thieving in his lair, he enslaved him. The elven wizard may have asked of Gorions Ward a task. The ward could have killed Mekrath or performed this task for him for HaerDalis freedom.\nUpon the freedom of HaerDalis, the once-slave read out a poem he had composed."
