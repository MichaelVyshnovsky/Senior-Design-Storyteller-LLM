==Possessions==
As with most narzugons, Haruman possessed an ''[[infernal tack]]''.

==History==
In [[1354 DR]], Haruman was one of the people who chose to accompany Zariel into [[Avernus]], in the event known as [[The Ride (event)|the Ride]], as one of her generals.

Upon arrival in Avernus, Haruman and his fellow general [[Olanthius]] refused to leave [[Zariel]]'s side and accompanied her to [[Nessus]], witnessing there [[Asmodeus]] offering Zariel rulership of [[Avernus]].

Haruman chose to follow Zariel into damnation, and was transformed into a [[narzugon]] [[devil]].
