        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Velicia was placed as an undercover spy to work under [[Farlin]], who led a gang of Guild members in dealing with the [[Stone Lord]] and his men. The new kingpin secretly served the [[Absolute]] and was trying to remove the Guild's influence from across the Gate. Farlin's group faced a band of the Stone Lord's men led by the [[tiefling]] [[Cairos]], under the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge in [[Rivington]]. However, the meeting devolved into a battle and his squad's fate remained uncertain, whether they were killed by the gangsters or survived and returned safely to the Guild's safehouse."
