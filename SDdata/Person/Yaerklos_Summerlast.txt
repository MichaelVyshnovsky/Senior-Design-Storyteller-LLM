Yaerklos Summerlast was a town guard that lived in the settlement of Idyllglen.
Yaerklos was present in Idyllglen when Yeenoghu assaulted the settlement with his demonic horde. Yaerklos and other guards bravely defended their fellow citizens. A handful of them were driven mad, when they were doused in demon ichor, and were consumed with the urge to eat human flesh.
