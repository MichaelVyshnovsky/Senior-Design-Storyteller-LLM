'''Pang''' was a [[monk]] of the [[Way of Enlightenment]] at [[Pokarr Gompa]] in [[Tabot]] around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.

==Activities==
He introduced himself as a "nu cho" of the Pokarr monastery, where he worked as a scribe. Being a scribe, he took a vow of silence.

==Personality==
Pang was a young man, and as such was certain in his beliefs and biases alike. He favored northern Tabot over southern and the [[monasteries]] over the secular settlements.

==Description==
On pilgrimage, he wore an orange loincloth and carried an ornate green and gold umbrella.

==History==
''Circa'' 2607, Abbot [[Mo Kin]] chose Pang to represent Pokarr Gompa in the great festival at the [[Temple of Heaven's Heart]] on [[Mount E'kwong]], releasing him from an eight-year-long vow of silence in the process. Pang was accompanied by five temple guards. While on the [[pilgrim]]age, he introduced himself to a representative from [[Shou Lung]]—in truth, the Dragon Lord [[Mei Lung]]—on the grounds that he looked "important enough" and asked to walk with him up the mountain. On the way, Pang told him much about Tabot, Regardless, Mei Lung later related Pang's account of Tabot to [[Elminster]].
