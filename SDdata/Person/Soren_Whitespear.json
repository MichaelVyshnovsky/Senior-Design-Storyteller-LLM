        "mainbody": "Soren Whitespear was a human man. He was a mercenary in the Red Brigade and later a bandit with the Vipers.\nSoren Whitespear and Cedric Ravajar were best friends for many years, before either of them joined the Red Brigade as mercenaries. When Cedric became captain, Soren was his second-in-command.\nWhen Cedric disbanded the Brigade in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, Soren went with his friend to join his newly founded bandit group, the Vipers, at the Vipers Nest. Soren was reluctant at the idea, but became one of the senior members of the group.\nDespite being a bandit, Soren hated raiding merchant caravans, considering it a waste of his warrior skills. Still, he took the lead in any raid, quick to engage caravan guards first.\nSoren loved a good battle, and usually fought bare-chested armed with both short sword and dagger simultaneously.\nSoren was 5 feet and 9 inches (1.7 meters) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kilograms). Though small and light, he had surprising power and grace, and great stamina. His hair was short, wavy, and blond, and he had pale blue eyes. He was clean-shaven but with a thick moustache with ends drooping past his mouth.\nHe had number of tattoos to represent the groups he was a member of. Above each collarbone was a flaming sabre symbol of the Red Brigade. A snake to represent the Vipers was wrapped around his neck from jugular to the base of his skull.\nSoren fought with a short sword, a magical dagger, and a number of other daggers. He also wore a plumed helm with silver filigree.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryMembers of the Red Brigade\nCategoryMembers of the Vipers\nCategoryMercenaries\nCategoryBandits\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vipers Nest\nCategoryInhabitants of Brynwood\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vast\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryFighters\nli8ihpfuwy2ru7fjj0l96c68a0r205q"
