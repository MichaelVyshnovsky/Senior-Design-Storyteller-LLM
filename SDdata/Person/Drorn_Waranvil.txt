Drorn Waranvil was a dwarf that had served in both the Iron Guard of Citadel Adbar and the Citadel Guards of Citadel Felbarr.
In battle, Drorn wielded a warhammer.
Drorn fought in the orc wars for over two centuries, where he lost a foot to an orc. He also helped Emerus in liberating Citadel Felbarr twice, and aided in retaking Gauntlgrym before retiring, and chronicling his experiences for the benefit of younger dwarves.
