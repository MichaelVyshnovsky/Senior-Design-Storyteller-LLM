'''Carril Byndraeth''' was a [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lord of Waterdeep]] and crime lord. He was also the husband of fellow Lord [[Brianne Byndraeth]].

Having Carril married to a fellow Lord caused many troubles. The rift that was opened between the two circa [[1350 DR]] nearly caused the Lords to split into two factions. However, Carril was killed by a [[black dragon]] seeking the return of [[Dragon's Eye (item)|its eye]].

==Residence==
Carril had a old estate outside of the city.
