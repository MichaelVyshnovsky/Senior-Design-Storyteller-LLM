Carril Byndraeth was a Masked Lord of Waterdeep and crime lord. He was also the husband of fellow Lord Brianne Byndraeth.
Having Carril married to a fellow Lord caused many troubles. The rift that was opened between the two circa 1350 DR nearly caused the Lords to split into two factions. However, Carril was killed by a black dragon seeking the return of its eye.
Carril had a old estate outside of the city.
