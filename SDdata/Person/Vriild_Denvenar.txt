'''Vriild Denvenar''' was a leading member of the [[derro]] [[Council of Savants]] in [[Gracklstugh]] in [[1370 DR]]. 

==Personality==
Vriild's main concern was the new nation of [[Luruar]], which Vriild saw as a successor of [[Ascalhorn]], [[Myth Drannor]], and [[Phalorm]], and a menace to the derros' ambitions on the surface. His areas of expertise were the [[human]] history of [[northwest Faerûn]], cartography, and prominent human wizards.

==History==
Vriild was the leader of a faction of savants whose main field of study was the Realms Above. Over [[1369 DR|1369]]–[[1370 DR]], Vriild made close contacts with the [[Kraken Society]] in [[Yartar]]. Vriild offered to the Krakenar magical aid to infiltrate Luruar in exchange for sharing information.
