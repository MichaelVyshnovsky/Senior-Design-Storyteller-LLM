Vriild Denvenar was a leading member of the derro Council of Savants in Gracklstugh in 1370 DR. 
Vriilds main concern was the new nation of Luruar, which Vriild saw as a successor of Ascalhorn, Myth Drannor, and Phalorm, and a menace to the derros ambitions on the surface. His areas of expertise were the human history of northwest Faerûn, cartography, and prominent human wizards.
Vriild was the leader of a faction of savants whose main field of study was the Realms Above. Over 1369–1370 DR, Vriild made close contacts with the Kraken Society in Yartar. Vriild offered to the Krakenar magical aid to infiltrate Luruar in exchange for sharing information.
