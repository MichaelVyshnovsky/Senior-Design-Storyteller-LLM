'''Penelope Ringwarble''' was a writer who lived and published her work sometime ''circa'' the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Penelope's [[book]] – ''[[Adopters of Culture]]'', was an anthropological work that voiced her opinion on the culture, or lack thereof, among the [[half-orcish]] people of [[Faerûn]]. The book was published sometime in or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}} and found among the possessions of the inhabitants of [[Baldur's Gate]].

Penelope's cousin, [[Joyce Ringwarble]], did not share Penelope's favorable view of half-orcs. She showed disdain and desire to sterilize them in her work titled ''[[Tusky Grins]]''.
