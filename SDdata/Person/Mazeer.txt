}}'''Mazeer''' was a member of the [[College of Conjuration]] in the city of [[Sshamath]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1377}}, alongside [[Gilkriz]], Mazeer was one of the conjurers sent to help teleport the combined force of Sshamath wizards and priests of [[Eilistraee]] to the main temple of [[Kiaransalee]], which they planned to attack.

Later, she, along with Telmyz, a [[Nightshadow (organization)|Nightshadow]], were scouting underwater tunnels for a way to locate [[Kiaransalee]]'s temple. But they were attacked by a [[giant water spider]]. Telmyz was yanked out of the water and Mazeer summoned a [[water elemental]] that broke two of the spider's legs and turned into a powerful whirlpool.

After the destruction of [[Kiaransalee]] and of the [[Voidstone]], the priestesses of Eilistraee went out to search for her body in order to bring it back to the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]] and try to resuscitate her.
