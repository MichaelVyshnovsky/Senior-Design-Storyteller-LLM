Jalboun of the Two Blades was a mercenary and a fence who operated out of the Cutlass in Luskan during the mid-14 century DR.
Jalboun was quite gregarious, often belting out drinking songs and always joyfully joining a fight whenever one erupted.
Jalboun earned his title from the dual scimitars he wielded, both of which were swords of dancing.
