'''Felogyr Sonshal''' was a businessman in [[Baldur's Gate]] in [[1359 DR]].

==Activities==
Felogyr managed [[Felogyr's Fireworks]]. Slowly, he was converting his business from candles and lanterns to [[smokepowder]] and [[firearm]]s. He acted as a reseller for the islands of [[Lantan]]. He also bought property along [[Sword Coast]] and lent money to shipbuilders, [[thieves' guild]]s, adventurers, and similar shady or risky interests, using his control of firearms to curb the illicit deeds of these debtors.

==Personality==
Felogyr wanted to be a friend to all. However, he was very prudent in his trade of firearms, wanting to avoid possible retaliation from wizards. He surveyed all his customers in order to stop someone who would try to build a monopoly.
