'''Fenthick Moss''' was a [[half-elf]] [[cleric]] of [[Tyr]] and the deceased fiance of [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The pair were known as "the very Sword and Scales of Tyr". He was a colleague to the false [[Church of Helm|Helmite]] [[Desther Indelayne]].

==Personality==
Fenthick was deemed wise within a peaceful society's choices, but a fool in desperate reality. He was good-natured to the point of not being mature enough as an adult to discern dangerous individuals around him. He even vouched Desther's innocence when it was obvious the latter's present treachery. His mind was too weak to handle true betrayal, therefore, sought his responsibility through law and not wisdom, which he was socially known for.

==Relationships==

=== Aribeth de Tylmarande ===
He was [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]]'s fiance. His unjust death started a chain reaction that lead his former fiance to fall and become a [[Blackguard]].

=== Desther Indelayne ===
He foolishly sought to redeem the false Helmite Desther Indelayne by following the traitor of [[Neverwinter]], but was killed in the end, ironically by judicial reasons.

==History==
Fenthick sought to find a cure to the [[Wailing Death]]. He gave ward key to his colleague [[Desther Indelayne]] to better assist the magic ceremony to create the cure. However, Desther, secretly an agent of [[Morag]], absconded with the cure once it was created. Fenthick followed Desther to  [[Helm's Hold]] in the hope of making him recant, but ultimately ended up hanged for his "collaboration" with the false [[Helm]]ite traitor.

Years later, the spirit of Fenthick could be found in [[Neverwinter]]'s [[Tomb of the Betrayers]].
