Fenthick Moss was a half-elf cleric of Tyr and the deceased fiance of Aribeth de Tylmarande in the mid-14 century DR. The pair were known as "the very Sword and Scales of Tyr". He was a colleague to the false Helmite Desther Indelayne.
Fenthick was deemed wise within a peaceful societys choices, but a fool in desperate reality. He was good-natured to the point of not being mature enough as an adult to discern dangerous individuals around him. He even vouched Desthers innocence when it was obvious the latters present treachery. His mind was too weak to handle true betrayal, therefore, sought his responsibility through law and not wisdom, which he was socially known for.
He was Aribeth de Tylmarandes fiance. His unjust death started a chain reaction that lead his former fiance to fall and become a Blackguard.
He foolishly sought to redeem the false Helmite Desther Indelayne by following the traitor of Neverwinter, but was killed in the end, ironically by judicial reasons.
Fenthick sought to find a cure to the Wailing Death. He gave ward key to his colleague Desther Indelayne to better assist the magic ceremony to create the cure. However, Desther, secretly an agent of Morag, absconded with the cure once it was created. Fenthick followed Desther to  Helms Hold in the hope of making him recant, but ultimately ended up hanged for his "collaboration" with the false Helmite traitor.
Years later, the spirit of Fenthick could be found in Neverwinters Tomb of the Betrayers.
