        "mainbody": "Harmon was the cobbler of an unnamed village in Faerûn in the mid–14 century DR and the husband of Celia.\nTogether, they took in Marrec as an infant, though they had many children of their own, including Emmon, and they nursed the young boy back to health. They were not able to find out who his parents were. They frowned on him taking any pet more dangerous than a hare. When Emmon was injured while on a trek through the wilderness with an eleven-year old Marrec, they punished both children. They were both supportive of Marrecs decision to join the village militia at the age of sixteen, seeing him as a natural for combat.\nHowever, when Emmon was killed in the militia, and Marrec came into his medusa heritage, they wanted nothing more to do with him."
