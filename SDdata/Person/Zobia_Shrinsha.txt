Zobia Shrinsha was a tavern owner who inhabited the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She was a shy and quiet woman whose demeanor reminded her patrons of a little girl.
She owned A Maidens Tears that was located on a small unnamed alley that branched south off of Lion Street in the northeastern section of Waterdeeps North Ward.
Zobia maintained close relationships both with the City Watch and the Lords of Waterdeep.
