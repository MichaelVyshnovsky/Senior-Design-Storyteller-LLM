Booyagh Culk was a goblin spellcaster and cultist of the Absolute, who served his goddess during the late 15 century DR.
Culk had yellow-brown skin and brown hair he wore swept back. He wore a crude hide-and-leather harness, decorated with feathers and bones.
Raagg carried a crude, goblin-crafted staff.
In the , the cult of the Absolute at the Shattered Sanctum launched a terrible raid on the Waukeens Rest inn. The goblins of the Sanctum returned home to celebrate the raid with a great feast of roasted meat and generous amounts of ale. Booyagh Culk and several others drank far too much and passed out along the upper courtyard of the ruined temple.
