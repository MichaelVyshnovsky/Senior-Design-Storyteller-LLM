King '''Brindor Ol贸synne''' (born [[998 DR]], died [[1128 DR]]) was a [[half-elf]] and the king of [[Aglarond]] between [[1065 DR]] and [[1128 DR]] as the beginning of the [[Ol贸synne Dynasty]].

==Relationships==
Brindor had a trusted advisor named [[Dorin]], who was responsible for the [[Peace Talks of Ingdal's Arm]] held after the battle of the same name. After the founding of Aglarond, however, Dorin suffered a tragedy and became the [[vampire]] [[T'Laan]].

==History==
Brindor defeated the [[human]] army of [[Velprin]] in the [[Battle of Ingdal's Arm]] in 1065 DR, creating Aglarond and becoming its first ruler. Brindor raised an army for Aglarond, and constructed the [[Undumor|Emmech]] fortress (later renamed Undumor), the citadel [[Glarondar]], and the [[Watchwall]].

Brindor also commissioned the original palace on the site where the [[Palace of the Simbul]] stood, but this original wooden structure was burned down during a [[red dragon]] attack.

==Relatives==
Brindor's son and sole heir was [[Althon]] (later Althon "the Old"). He had blood ties with [[Aubayreer]] of [[Milvarn]].
