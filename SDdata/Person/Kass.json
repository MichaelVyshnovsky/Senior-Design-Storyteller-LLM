        "Description": "Kass was a [[human]] girl with hair streaked with white.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Ulma]] led her monster hunter tribe to the city of Baldur's Gate, where they found themselves targeted by [[vampire]]s. During the [[Absolute crisis]], when the Gurs camped in the [[Rivington]] district of the city, along with a small army of refugees displaced by the conflict, the tribe's children were abducted by [[Astarion Ancunín]] under orders from [[Cazador Szarr]].\n\nPosters with [[charcoal]] drawings of Kass' face were found in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]], promising a reward for any information on the child's fate. Kass, along with other abducted Gur children, was turned into a vampire spawn to be used in a hellish ritual by Cazador. Subsequently, Astarion Ancunín found himself broken out from under Cazador's control and, along with the [[Absolute Adversaries]], sought to infiltrate his old master's home. The outcome of Astarion's infiltration and the fate of the Gur children remained unconfirmed."
