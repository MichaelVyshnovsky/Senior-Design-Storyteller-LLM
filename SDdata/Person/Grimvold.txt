'''Grimvold''' was a [[pit fiend]] in service of [[Geryon]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was wary and careful.

==Description==
He looked older and more scarred than other pit fiends.

==Relationships==
Geryon listened to his advice without hesitation.

==History==
He had somehow seen [[Mystra]] before, in one of her shapes, and knew somehow of the magic of [[Asmodeus]].

In the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, Grimvold was one of the fiends accompanying Geryon when he was sent to stop [[the Simbul]], who was scouring [[Avernus]] in search of [[Elminster Aumar]]. When it appeared that she was opening a ''[[portal]]'', Grimvold strongly cautioned Geryon that it was a trap. He was correct.
