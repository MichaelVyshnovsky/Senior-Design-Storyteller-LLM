Grimvold was a pit fiend in service of Geryon in the late 14 century DR.
He was wary and careful.
He looked older and more scarred than other pit fiends.
Geryon listened to his advice without hesitation.
He had somehow seen Mystra before, in one of her shapes, and knew somehow of the magic of Asmodeus.
In the , Grimvold was one of the fiends accompanying Geryon when he was sent to stop the Simbul, who was scouring Avernus in search of Elminster Aumar. When it appeared that she was opening a portal, Grimvold strongly cautioned Geryon that it was a trap. He was correct.
