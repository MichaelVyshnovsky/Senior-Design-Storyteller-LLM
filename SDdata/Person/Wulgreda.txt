'''Wulgreda''' was a prisoner of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] at the [[Temple of the Black Earth]] in [[Tyar-Besil]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Wulgreda was prospecting the hills near the [[Sacred Stone Monastery]] when she was captured by Black Earth cultists. She remained in the Temple of the Black Earth's jail until some adventurers defeated the jailer cultists and freed her.
