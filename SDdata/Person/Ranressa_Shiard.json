        "mainbody": "Ranressa Shiard was a Waterdhavian adventurer who lived in the mid–11 century DR. She was a member of the all-female adventuring band the Shining Ring Swordshars, and was the founder of the all-female Galadran Company.\nRanressa was considered both a tirelessly bold and a reckless leader.\nShe was very close with the copper dragon Galadaeros, who was her mentor and a powerful ally of the adventuring company she had named in his honor. \nIn the mid–11 century DR, Ranressa was the sole survivor of an ill-fated sea voyage by the Shining Ring Swordshars. She washed ashore at the Purple Rocks, within the territory of Galadaeros. While exploring the island, Ranressa discovered Galadaeros and promptly attempted to slay him. The lonely copper dragon was more amused than annoyed by Ranressas futile but dogged attempts at killing him. Galadaeros chose to question Ranressa and over time they developed a friendship. This companionship led Galadaeros to return Ranressa to Waterdeep on his back.\nNot only did this triumphant flight on dragon-back make Ranressa an instant hero in Waterdeep, it also led to the creation of a powerful mythal (Ahghairons dragonward) by Ahghairon which caused any creature with draconic blood that attempted to enter Waterdeep to be overcome with an overwhelming urge to leave the area, never to return.\nRanressa went on to charter the all-female Galadran Company, and Galadaeros was delighted when Ranressa returned to his island with them.\nRanressa recklessly led the Galadran Company on increasingly dangerous adventures, leading half of the Galadrans to perish in the first several years and requiring Galadaeros to perform some hasty rescues. However, the surviving members became competent fighters, and they eventually found an enormous cache of gold&mdashwhich Ranressa estimated to be three times the body volume of Galadaeros&mdashin a dwarven tomb during an orc-hunting expedition. However, news of their wealth drew negative attention such as from the mage Nuldus of Turtorn, who attempted to kill both Ranressa and Galadaeros. This plan failed and Galadaeros destroyed Nuldus and his tower.\nRanressa grew old enough to become infirm with age. Her death, and the deaths of other Galadrans, saddened Galadaeros, who continued to host the Galadran Company and their families."
