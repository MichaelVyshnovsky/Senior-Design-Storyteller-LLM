        "Personality": "Gharri was extremely clever and perceptive, and was skilled at diplomacy with a sharp wit.",
        "Possessions": "As a high priest of Gond, Gharri was reputed to have possession of a great wealth in [[trade bar]]s and [[coin]]s, as well as [[magical]] items and rare mechanical devices. After his death in 1357 DR, any such hoard of treasure remained undiscovered.",
        "History": "Gharri was born in the [[Sembian]] city of [[Yhaunn]] but was orphaned by a great fire, spending much of his youth with traveling priests of Gond. In time, he rose through their ranks and eventually founded the [[Temple of Gond Wondermaker]] in [[Tilverton]], the largest temple of Gond in the [[Eastern Heartlands]]. He became the ''de facto'' ruler of Tilverton sometime prior to 1337 DR, which prospered thanks to innovations in manufacturing and the crafting of small, high-quality items such as toothed gears, locks, and hinges.\n\nWhen Tilverton came under threat by the [[Zhentarim]], [[Lashan Aumersair]], and warbands of [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s in [[1356 DR]], he accepted the aid of Cormyr's [[Purple Dragons]] to save the city from destruction. In [[Flamerule]] of that year, he accepted the annexation of Tilverton as a protectorate of Cormyr, and took the position of Lord Regent of the city. During this time, he secretly met and developed a relationship with the rogue Princess [[Alusair Obarskyr]], who had fled her father's court and become an [[adventurer]]. As he realized his powerlessness in the face of the Dragon Throne, Gharri suddenly disappeared from the city with Alusair in [[Mirtul]] of [[1357 DR]]. They traveled together for a few months, but their relationship turned sour and they separated after a fight. Gharri met with the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]], who secretly set him up in [[Castle Krag]] in [[Shadowdale]], where he oversaw the local clergy of Gond and operated them as a spy ring.\n\nLater in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, he traveled to [[Daggerdale]] to fight alongside [[Randal Morn]] in his war against the [[Zhentarim]]. Gharri met his end in a titanic battle against a dozen [[Zhent]] [[mage]]s near [[Serpentsbridge]], with almost no one being aware of his passing."
