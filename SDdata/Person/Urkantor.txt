'''Urkantor''' was one of the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Clangeddin's Hearth]], an organization of descendants of [[Clan Melairkyn]] who were attempting to reclaim their ancestral homes in [[Undermountain]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
Urkantor was resourceful and knowledgeable of the Underdark and the structures that belonged to Clan Melairkyn in the ancient past.

==History==
Sometime before 1370 DR, Clangeddin's Hearth was formed by Clan Melairkyn survivors and fellow nationalistic dwarves and followers of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]]. They started a campaign of reclaiming the territories that belonged to the ancient dwarves and the holy places of Clangeddin. They had some success, but it was short-lived as they attracted the attention of [[drow]] who were plotting against [[Waterdeep]]. Urkantor was exploring the upper levels of Undermountain in 1368 DR when he came across a drow patrol. He attempted to escape but was captured. The drow passed the dwarf to a [[demon]]-blooded [[orc]] ally, [[Horazak]], to torture for information in the orc's stronghold. That stronghold was an ancient dwarven prison that Urkantor was familiar with and the dwarf befriended a fellow prisoner, [[Tryola Perrentine]]. Together they managed to escape and flee into the mines underneath the prison. Horazak's forces recaptured the duo, but shortly after, they were rescued by an agent of [[Khelben Arunsun]] who was investigating the web of plots against the City of Splendors.

By the end of the drow crisis, Urkantor was one of the very few surviving members of Clangeddin's Hearth as the drow slaughtered their base in the temple complex of Clangeddin Silverbeard in search of the artifact piece hidden inside.
