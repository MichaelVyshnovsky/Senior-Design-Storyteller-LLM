Mellomir was a wizard who lived in Arabel in Cormyr in 1367 DR.
Mellomir was dry and dapper, but widely respected across Faerûn.
He kept his steadily whitening hair and beard neatly trimmed.
In addition to being a powerful wizard, Mellomir was a sage specializing in history, prophecy, and divination.
He accurately predicted the fall of Bhaal and Myrkul during the Time of Troubles, as well as the return of the Ring of Winter.
Due to various kidnap attempts, Mellomir cast a unique personal protection spell warding his body against many forms of attack.
