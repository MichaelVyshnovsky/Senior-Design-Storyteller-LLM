        "mainbody": "Yodfah al-Muluki was the treasurer of Krak al-Niraan in the Weeping Desert in 1367 DR.\nYodfah stood  tall. He was a bald and cheerful man. He was always dressed in the finest silks and wore expensive jewelry.\nYodfah was naturally charismatic, but this was further enhanced with magic. He laughed often to put others at ease.\nYodfah was a master con artist with a golden tongue.\nYodfah owned a ring of spell storing, a ring of human influence, and a pair of bracers of defense. He carried an ebony blowgun that he used with darts envenomed with dreambliss. His dagger of venom was filled with deadly venom. He carried multiple valuable gemstones on him that he used for bribes.\nHis skill as a gem merchant made him wealthy in Muluk by the time he was 30. He appeared to be a trustworthy law-abiding citizen, but Yodfah always cheated foreigners and revealed his true sinister nature in private. He operated multiple illegal business, all without the caliphs tax collectors slightest suspicion. Anyone who discovered his illicit ventures was quickly disposed of.\nYodfah worked with the Brotherhood of the True Flame, making drugged wine for Jamal al-Yindannim. Yodfah envisioned the Brotherhood eventually taking over the region and wished to help manage their considerable finances.\nYodfah was employed by Jamal to manage the astronomical costs of maintaining the stronghold and a standing army within the Haunted Lands. Yodfah was under the influence of a geas to ensure he didnt cheat the Brotherhood of the True Flame. He wisely invested the Brotherhoods dinars in businesses within several relatively close cities. The profit made by those investments was staggering."
