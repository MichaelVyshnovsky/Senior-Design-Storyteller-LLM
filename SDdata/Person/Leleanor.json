        "History": "Leleanor was a businesswoman who wanted to regrow the business of her ancestor, which was at that time limited to a few outlets in major cities like [[Waterdeep]], [[Baldur's Gate]], and [[Westgate]].\n\nIn [[1491 DR]], she discovered a map among her ancestors' possessions detailing a mine in the [[Underdark]] near [[Mulmaster]]. With the help of the [[Lords' Alliance]] and the [[Church of Tymora]], she quietly secured access to the mine.\n\nLater, at Mulmaster's Underdark outpost of [[Fort Iron]], Leleanor hired an adventuring party to explore the nearby mines for her."
