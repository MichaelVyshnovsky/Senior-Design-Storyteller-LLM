        "mainbody": "Leleanor was a descendant of Aurora of Auroras Emporium.\nLeleanor was a businesswoman who wanted to regrow the business of her ancestor, which was at that time limited to a few outlets in major cities like Waterdeep, Baldurs Gate, and Westgate.\nIn 1491 DR, she discovered a map among her ancestors possessions detailing a mine in the Underdark near Mulmaster. With the help of the Lords Alliance and the Church of Tymora, she quietly secured access to the mine.\nLater, at Mulmasters Underdark outpost of Fort Iron, Leleanor hired an adventuring party to explore the nearby mines for her."
