The sergeant was one of the more ambitious and competent members of the City Watch. She was also a devotee of Bane. She was a little tyrannical, always focused on work and did not suffer fools. Her men believed her incapable of smiling or laughing.
Audra was a rising officer in the Watch.
In 1491 DR, Audra led a City Watch patrol that found the corpse of a strange creature that had emerged from the sewers. She hired an adventuring party to investigate the matter.
