Miklos Selkirk was an ex-adventurer and the founder and commander of the Silver Ravens.
Miklos was known as a skilled negotiator, diplomat, and exceptional sword fighter. All of these skills came to play during the many duels of wit that Miklos engaged in, most often with Mirabeta, his fathers cousin and his fiercest rival.
Forming the Ravens after being unable to fully let go of his adventuring days, he spent most of his time directing their actions. Occasionally though, Miklos was called to the Sembian Council to peacefully negotiate with the drow, a race he had come to understand through their diplomatic styles.
Miklos Selkirk had adventured around the Sea of Fallen Stars and the Moonsea, as well as in the Underdark.
At some point during his career, before 1372 DR, he commissioned the creation of the gloves of discipline to aid his Silver Ravens recruits. Once he outfitted them with the enchanted gloves, the fumbling and disarming became a significantly rarer occurrence.
In 1374 DR he was assigned as observer to the Sembian expedition led by Borstag Duncastle went to assist the disguised Sarya Dlardrageth.
After that year Miklos was with his brother Kavin Selkirk disguised in Scardale when arrived news from Abelar Corrinthal of the death of their father and the proclamation of Mirabeta new temporary Overmistress. After receving the news the two brothers tried to arrive secretly in Ordulin when on Uktar 1 they were ambushed by many of the mercenaries of Malkur Forrin and in the fighting Miklos and Kavin were killed by poisoned weapons.
Among Mikloss possessions were a +2 keen rapier, a +2 defending dagger, a pair of boots of striding and springing, a ring of mind shielding, and a ring of protection +1.
Miklos was the eldest son of Overmaster Kendrick Selkirk and the second cousin of the "Countess" Mirabeta.
