        "mainbody": "'''Klevtor''' was a no-good [[halfling]] dockworker who kept his eye on the shipments for the captains in [[Daggerford]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He and his buddy [[Rugmax]] were practical jokers, with one such joke leading to a young man's death in the {{Yearlink|1372}}.",
        "History": "Klevtor and his friend Rugmax worked in the docks of Daggerford to make extra coin, by making sure the cargo was not stolen. In 1372 DR, [[Fernigold the Younger]] was among the dock street youths and was the target of Klevtor and Rugmax's relentless jests. The halflings thought the simple man to be hilarious, always talking about treasures and daydreaming about adventures, finding ancient magic items, and making his family rich.\n\nAs a cruel joke, the halflings convinced a traveling merchant to sell a fake map to fool Fernigold the Younger, which eventually led to the young man's disappearance. Days after Fernigold the Younger's disappearance, his father, [[Fernigold]], was able to get help from a group of heroes who offered to look for his missing son. The heroes interrogated the halflings about the missing man. Rugmax was afraid of going to jail for the alleged murder and convinced Klevtor to give them a copy of the map they gave to Fernigold the Younger.\n\nSubsequently, the [[Hero of Daggerford]] discovered the body of Fernigold inside [[Telarthir's tomb]]. When Klevtor and Rugmax were confronted with the fact that the prank map was real and led to the young man's death, the halflings agreed to surrender themselves to Daggerford's justice system."
