'''Horoko''' was a [[bushi]] warrior turned landscape gardener in the town of [[Aru]] in [[Wa]] in the 1770s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==Description==
He had a tattoo resembling a "flame knife" on his right arm. He loved [[sake]].

==History==
On one campaign, Horoko and his comrades had too much sake and went to a tattoo parlor. Horoko wound up with his tattoo, and couldn't recall how or why.

He later hung up his [[sword]] and began a new career as a landscape gardener in Aru. However, when he visited public baths in {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, his tattoo may have been misidentified by adventurers as the similar flame-knife tattoo of the [[Yamaguchi]] [[ninja]] clan, which could lead to conflict.
