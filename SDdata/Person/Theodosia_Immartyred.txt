Theodosia Immartyred, more commonly called Dosia, was a healer and a cleric who devoted her life to the deity Ilmater in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Dosia was wholly devoted to the Lord of the Rack. She took her responsibilities as a cleric quite seriously and carried them out with great effort.
In addition to being a great healer, Dosia was capable of "taking on the suffering" of others. When she performed this feat, a group of individuals were healed of all their wounds and ailments and felt as if they had just had a good nights rest. But this took a great deal out of Dosia, and if she performed it too many times in a short period of time, she could die.
Dosia was in the possession of a great Ilmatari weapon, the Martyrs Morningstar.
She was acquainted with another devotee of Ilmater, Hyreth, who endured great suffering for his faith.
In the , Dosia joined with the Coalition army that marched out against Caelar Argent and the Shining Crusade. She was tasked with healing those soldiers who were sectioned off in the Coalition camps field hospital.
When some soldiers were struck with an unrecognizable disease, Dosia was unable to identify and thus treat the ailment.
