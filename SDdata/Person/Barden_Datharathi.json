        "mainbody": "'''Barden Datharathi''' was a member of the [[Datharathi]] chaka of [[Durpar]]. He was present in the meeting which his third cousin [[Warian Datharathi]] attended in [[Tarsakh]] of {{yearlink|1374}} soon after returning to [[Vaelan]]. One of his arms was a svelte [[plangent]] prosthetic. He rubbed his hands in unison with [[Sevaera Datharathi]], [[Corlaen Datharathi]], and [[Xaemar Datharathi]] at one point during the meeting, a gesture owed to the influence of [[Shaddon Datharathi]].{{cite book/Darkvision||10}}"
