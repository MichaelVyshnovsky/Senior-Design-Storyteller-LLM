        "mainbody": "'''Pettywick Wocket''' was a light-hearted and cunning [[gnome]] traveler who was captured by the [[lycanthrope]]s of the [[Maxillian Manor]] in [[1372 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Right about now, you're probably wondering what could possibly be worse than being drugged and tossed in a cell by two psychotic [[apple]] farmers? Well, the answer is: being drugged and tossed in a cell by two psychotic [[werewolves]]...''|Pettywick Wocket}}",
        "Description": "Pettywick was a youthful and good-looking gnome woman. Her plucky personality and humor kept her in good spirits even in the direst situations.",
        "History": "Just like many other unlucky travelers, Pettywick was offered to join birthday revelry by [[Jonas Maxillian Senior]] and [[Jonas Maxillian Junior]]. The young adventurer happily accepted a friendly invitation and a seeming [[mug]] of [[Gravia's hot apple cider]]. Even though cunning and attentive traveler who avoided scams and trouble, Pettywick downed half the glass before she realized that something tasted off. The [[knockout drops]] did their work, and the gnome passed put. Like other victims, she was stripped of her possessions and thrown in one of the cells of the [[Chase Maze]]. The labyrinth laid underneath the werewolf farmers' home and was built by one of Jonas' progenitors to indulge their lust for hunt.\n\nPettywick spent some time in her cell while sympathizing [[Gravia Maxillian]] tried to help the gnome with information on their evil family. Gravia revealed to the prisoner the truth behind the Maxillians and the solution to the maze's puzzle, hoping that Pettywick would be able to escape untouched the time for her hunt came. Sometime after Pettywick's capture, a similar fate befell the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. The adventure woke up unarmed and naked in the maze. Without losing her cheery disposition, the gnome shared the solution to the maze in exchange for a promise of release when the chase was over. The Hero managed to escape the Chase Maze before the countdown was over, and when confronted, the werewolf father and son were slain. Pettywick Wocket was freed and went to enjoy the open road once more."
