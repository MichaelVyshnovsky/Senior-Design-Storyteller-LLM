Anazar Narroun was a priest of Amaunator from the town of Eveningstar in Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
Anazar was a human man with sharp features, light skin, and black hair gathered in a tight ponytail. He wore robes of Amaunators clergy.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the mid-1480s DR, Anazar Narroun helped to organize a group of Evenors as they responded to emerging crises. While Derevon Ybir wanted all efforts devoted to repairing the towns barricades, he prioritized the priestess Meena Follakin and her request to to investigate a strange disease that had emerged in Eveningstars War Hospital, transforming infected men and women into red musk zombies. He sent a team of adventurers to aid her, which quickly put an end to Peron Uthes zombie rampage. He then directed the team to Eolynn Arva and the threat at Uthe Lodge, which saved Eveningstar as a whole from the dryad Sylvie.
The last excursion put the adventurers in contact with the Harpers through Jussko Kwahn and his fellows Kirinel Zay and Tarim Inavule, who were posing as concerned and unusually-capable travelers. Anazar was happy to let these conspicuous do-gooders help in tracking down the once-beloved druid Halsaime at Thorngap, first to Thorn Hollow and then the Druids Deep. By the combined efforts of everyone involved, Halsaime was finally cornered at the Deep and killed, and his evil artifact of a staff destroyed.
