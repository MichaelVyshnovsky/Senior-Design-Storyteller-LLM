==Description==
Jooli was a tan-skinned [[dwarf|dwarvish]] man with dark brown curly hair and a bushy beard.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Chamberlain [[Mercer]], the man in charge of Lady [[Firelia Jannath]]'s staff, dismissed all servants from the mansion on the mistress's orders. Mercer placed Jooli, who was assigned the job of the kitchen liaison, [[Furbleston]], [[Bailey]], [[Cyrilla]], [[Phubbs]], and Chef [[Marjoram (chef)|Marjoram]] on temporary leave with the pay of half-wages and allowance to seek temporary employment somewhere else. The chamberlain issued a statement that this dismissal was done at no imputation of malfeasance and would be ended upon notice.

Hargin was tasked with kitchen work, chopping up the produce for the manse's chef. He was a somewhat unsavory man who was not against serving nobles "tainted" [[wine]]. It was rumored he was once a member of [[the Guild]].
