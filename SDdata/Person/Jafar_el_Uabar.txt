'''Jafar el Uabar''' was the [[Rundeen#Organization|Nirdey]] of [[Volothamp]] for the [[Rundeen]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Jafar grew up in Volothamp with his uncle [[Tulmon el Uabar|Tulmon]], a wealthy [[pearl diver]]. Recently, his uncle estranged him after a disagreement about the family business, so Jafar joined with the Rundeen in order to maintain his lifestyle. He acted as mediator between merchants and smugglers and often worked with [[Syan al Derak]] of the [[Knights of the Shield]]. Jafar greatly disliked the "Gem Caleph" [[Adnan el Huzal]], ruler of the [[Pearl Diver's Guild]] and would do anything to ruin him. He saw this as a method to reconcile with his uncle and started considering even the use of [[assassin]]s in order to accomplished the goal.
