==Description==
Po was a [[Calishite]] man with dark hair and dusky skin. His body was significantly deformed by a serious [[disease|illness]]. Po had reduced eyesight in one of his eyes, and his joints had become inflexible. His hands were deformed into gnarled shapes, and he had a stooped gait owing to trouble walking unaided.{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|16}}{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|4}} He dressed in a frayed [[cape]].{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|8}}

==Personality==
{{Fq
| text = How can you prove to me that you aren't lying snakes?
| source = Pock-Marked Po
}}
Po was very crafty and had a quick wit and a silver tongue. He had a level head, and a polite demeanor.

==Activities==
As a beggar prince, he was one of the unofficial rulers of Port Nyanzaru's [[Port Nyanzaru/Old City|Old City]] and the [[thieves]] of the city listened to his commands.

He was connected to the [[Zhentarim]] and acted as their principle contact in the city, although his superiors allowed him to operate mostly autonomously.{{Cite adventurers league/Putting the Dead to Rest|4-5}}{{Cite adventurers league/Old Bones and Older Tomes|3}} and improving their reputation.{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night|4}}

He sponsored a team of competitors in Port Nyanzaru's [[dinosaur races]] known as the [[Bladefangs]].

==Relationships==
Due to his poor health, Po was attended to by a number of young [[Chultan]] women who cared for him, fed him [[olive]]s, and helped him with things that his body did not allow him to do.

Po had many contacts throughout Port Nyanzaru, through which he conducted his affairs.{{Cite adventurers league/Over the Edge|21}} [[Zansha]],{{Cite adventurers league/Unusual Opposition|4}} [[Jaha Mubsie]],

Among the [[Port Nyanzaru#Merchant Princes|Merchant Princes]] of Port Nyanzaryu, Po respected [[Kwayothé]] but disliked [[Jessamine]] and [[Wakanga O'tamu]].

He generally strove to ensure that the Zhentarim seized favorable opportunities out from under rival factions,{{Cite adventurers league/Over the Edge|4}} when they rallied behind [[Hawkdriver Mazugulak]] to drive back an [[undead]] attack on the city,{{Cite adventurers league/Rotting Roots|3}} or when they came together under [[Alastar Bol]] to send agents to investigate undead forces stemming from the ruined city of [[Matolo]].

He had a son named [[Basu]], although he outwardly cared for him relatively little compared to his "bigger family" of the Zhentarim.

==Possessions==
Po lived in a lavishly decorated and perfumed hut that had a dilapidated exterior, in the south end of the [[Old City]]. However, in his capacity as a beggar prince, he held court in the smallest of the [[Beggars' Palaces|three step-pyramids]] overlooking [[Executioner's Run]].

==History==
At one time, Po had been an [[adventurer]], however he was left deformed after a disease nearly killed him.

As of the events of the [[death curse]] around {{Yearlink|1490}},{{ToA-time}} Po was in his mid&ndash;30s and worked as an agent of the Zhentarim. During this time, he tasked a group of adventurers with participating in a [[dinosaur]] race in the [[Market Ward]] in order to win the Oracle's Eye, a piece of a ''[[Dreamer's Amulet]]''. He also hired adventurers to investigate the disappearance of a beloved local tavern owner, [[Miboro Yan]], and personally oversaw the near-execution of a witness, [[Favin Kreeger]], to learn what had happened to her.

When Port Nyanzaru came under attack by the [[fiend]]ish forces of [[Idrianne Smoke]], Po's thieves waged guerilla war against them in the Old City. The Merchant Prince Kwayothé sought to strike a deal with Po that would see him ally with her mercenaries.

When his son Basu disappeared on a trip to [[Fallen Feather]], Po sent adventurers to find him and the information that he carried.

When the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] threatened Chult, Po hatched a plan to create "proof" of the Zhentarim's superiority to goodly factions. He planned to send agents against the Red Wizards whom he would order to behave especially "heroically" and have record their deeds with a [[memory crystal]].
