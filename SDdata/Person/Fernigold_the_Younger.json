        "mainbody": "'''Fernigold the Younger''' was a naive adventurer and son of a fishmonger from [[Daggerford]], [[Fernigold|Fernigold the Older]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Fernigold the Younger was a naive and foolishly brave according to his father.",
        "History": "Fernigold the Younger was a son of a simple fishmonger who was not content with the life of hard labor. Along with his two mischievous [[halfling]] friends, [[Rugmax]] and [[Klevtor]], Fernigold the Younger was pestering trades, caravaners, and adventurers for old maps, scrolls, and letters that possibly contained information of long lost riches.\n\nIn 1372 DR, Fernigold the Younger came across a scroll talking about an ancient ruler [[Telarthir]]'s tomb. The map was fake, a practical joke that Rugmax and Klevtor played on naive Fernigold. They did not expect the young man to actually pursue the treasure and just did it to make some coin off of him. The fake map led to a waterfall in the area to the east from [[Liam's Hold]].\n\nSurprisingly enough, the \"fake\" map turned out to be real and led the ambitious youth to [[Brush of Barbs]] and into [[Telarthir's tomb]]. However, Fernigold perished soon after he entered the crypt. He was slain by the undead guardians. Subsequently, his body was discovered by the [[Hero of Daggerford]] who was asked to find the missing young man. When Fernigold's body was discovered, his flesh was gaunt and his face was frozen in a grimace of terror. The youth's body was retrieved and returned to the the boy's grieving father."
