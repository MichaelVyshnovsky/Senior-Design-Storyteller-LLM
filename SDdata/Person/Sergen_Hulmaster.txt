Step brother of [[Kara Hulmaster]], Sergen was adopted into the family when his father [[Kamoth Kastelmar]] married Terena Hulmaster.  The Hulmasters allowed Sergen to remain a member of the family even after Kamoth's attempt to seize control of [[Hulburg]] in [[1466 DR]].

Sergen teamed up with his father (Kamoth) in an attempt to capture Hulburg in [[1479 DR]] but was killed by [[Geran Hulmaster]].<br />
