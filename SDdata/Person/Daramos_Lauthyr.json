        "mainbody": "'''Daramos Lauthyr''' was high priest of the [[Lady's House]], the temple of [[Tymora]] in [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]], in the latter half of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Lady Luck called, and I answered. I always answer her.|Daramos Lauthyr{{Cite organized play/LC/Good Evening Ladies and Gentlemen|5}}}}",
        "Description": "He wore ornate robes and looked generally distinguished.{{Cite organized play/LC/It Just So Happens...|4}}",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|Well, I wouldn't be surprised if all this storming isn't the work of the High Hand of the Lady, whose nose is out of joint again because no one will give him a title.|Rumor overheard in Arabel{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|34}}}}\n\nAlthough considered a wise leader, he was imperious, He was by all accounts a true zealot.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/07-29 - Daramos Lauthyr}}\n\nDaramos was willing to engage in cheap tricks and showmanship, such as hiring commoners to fill seats at his sermons, in order to appear more impressive to visiting dignitaries.",
        "Relationships": "Despite heavy resistance to his positions within the Church of Tymora, few disputed his wisdom and preeminent status. Many Tymorans outright feared him and found him unsuitable as high priest, but at the same time they admired how he positively radiated with Tymora's favor. Nearly all his failures turned to successes, and he seemed to exude luck. His fellow clergy were generally happy to cooperate with him, or at least not actively hinder him. They figured his ambition would lead to his downfall eventually, thereby solving the \"problem\" of Daramos Lauthyr.{{Cite organized play/LC/Good Evening Ladies and Gentlemen|2}}\n\nHis subordinate, [[Doust Sulwood]], formerly the lord of [[Shadowdale]] was critical of Daramos's ambitions.\n\nKing [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|Azoun IV]] considered Daramos to be a fanatic who was more devoted to his ambitions than to his goddess&mdash;though not by much. The King knew how much power Daramos held in Arabel and was careful not to anger him.",
        "History": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] of {{Yearlink|1358}}, Tymora herself sought refuge in the Lady's House in Arabel, staying there for most of the Godswar while protecting the city from the chaos that ensued. Daramos took this as a sign of the primacy of the Arabellan temple within the greater Church of Tymora. He campaigned for recognition both within the Church itself and within the state of Cormyr&mdash;he felt it was appropriate for King Azoun IV to grant him lands and the title of baron, thus giving the temple greater say in local politics. Frustrated by the lack of cooperation from both the Church and the Crown, he raised the fees for temple services to nearly double. Daramos felt the citizens of Arabel would be happy to pay a premium price given that Lady Luck had personally blessed the city with her presence. The added income was to be used toward furthering his ambitions for the Arabellan temple.\n\nDaramos's ambitions grew further over the course of the next decade, and he began attempting to unify the Church under a single grand patriarch&mdash;himself. In his view, the Lady's House should be the center of Tymoran worship and its leader should head the entire Church. The other temples of Tymora were generally very resistant to Daramos's proposed changes, but the conflict did not devolve into open hostility. and to bring the Church's [[mystic]]s into the hierarchy proper, rather than having them report to Tymora directly.\n\nDaramos continued squabbling with Cormyrean authorities all the while, especially with Lady Lord [[Myrmeen Lhal]] and Baron [[Thomdor Ammaeth]] on occasions where he tried to exert his authority over other faiths in Arabel. At one point, he proclaimed Myrmeen as as a willful blasphemer but had to stop when the Lady Lord called for&mdash;and received&mdash;a public sign from Tymora herself supporting her position. Despite continued refusals from the Crown to grant him a title, Daramos ordered his clergy to address him as \"baron of Arabel.\" Most citizens of Arabel remained silent, hoping Daramos's fellow Tymorans would eventually grow disgusted with his greed and evict him from the Church.\n\nElite agents of the [[Night Parade]] planned to assassinate Daramos, alongside other powerful Arabellan magic-users, in [[Flamerule]] of the {{YearlinkName|1360}}.{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|37}} The assassins struggled to find a way to get at Daramos since his temple was so well-guarded,{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|38}} and were defeated by adventurers before they could even make an attempt.{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|43}}\n\nIn the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, heavy rainfalls opened up a large sinkhole about a hundred yards away from the Lady's House. At the bottom of the sinkhole Daramos and his priests found a hitherto hidden temple of Beshaba. The cave-in had claimed the lives of at least 37 Beshabans. Daramos took this as a divine boon from Tymora, and further proof that he was her chosen prophet, despite the fact that the sinkhole caused one of the city's springs to channel water directly into the library of the Lady's House. He vowed to petition Lady Lord Myrmeen to cede the land above the Beshaban temple to the Church of Tymora.\n\nOn [[Marpenoth 22]] {{Yearlink|1370}},{{Cite organized play/LC/It Just So Happens...|3}} Daramos visited the [[Hall of Luck (Ravens Bluff)|Tymoran temple]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]] for a major celebration. A Tymoran prophecy had foretold the birth of a person blessed by Tymora in the city on this day. While observing the revelries, Daramos was stabbed and poisoned by a group of [[assassin]]s in the service of [[Beshaba]],{{Cite organized play/LC/It Just So Happens...|2}} as part of a plot engineered by [[Iyachtu Xvim]]. The local priests of Tymora, led by Mistress of Luck [[Clarissa Tupkas]],{{Cite organized play/LC/It Just So Happens...|6}} could only heal Daramos through an obscure ritual requiring very specific components: a [[rabbit's foot]], an exotic [[coin]], bottled ''[[essence of rainbow]]'', and four four-leafed [[clover]]s. Furthermore, the ritual had to be conducted before dawn lest Daramos's life be forfeit. Luckily, a group of local adventurers were able to gather the required components.{{Cite organized play/LC/It Just So Happens...|16}}\n\nAlthough his rule was fraught with controversy, the Church of Tymora indubitably grew in power under Daramos's leadership."
