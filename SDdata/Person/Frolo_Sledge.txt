|Can't say I'm happy our boat is full of prisoners. But at least the cargo loads itself!

{{Quote
|Prisoners go in, but nothing comes out. So we're stuck with an empty boat on the way back.

Frolo operated a [[Wheloon Prison boat|large boat]] with [[Har Pornoth]], first carrying cargo and later moving prisoners sent into [[Wheloon Prison]]. This including traversing the [[Starwater River]], [[Dragonmere]], and the [[Wyvernflow]] between [[Eveningstar]] and [[Wheloon]]. They did not carry anything out of Wheloon, leaving the hold empty.
