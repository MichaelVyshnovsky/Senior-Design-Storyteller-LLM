'''Belantra''' was a [[War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Belantra carried a ''[[mightywand]]'', a device that allowed her to trigger a number of [[wand]]s at the same time.

==History==
Belantra discovered [[Elminster Aumar]] attempting to furtively enter a [[War Wizard]] barrack in [[Marsember]] one early spring night in {{yearlink|1373}}, and attacked him with all her power. It barely slowed him; by the time he finally made it to [[Caladnei]], whom he sought to converse with, Belantra had fainted.
