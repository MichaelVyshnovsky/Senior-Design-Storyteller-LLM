Estemal Talltankard was a paladin of Arvoreen who around 1359 DR founded the military order of Arvoreens Marchers, composed mostly of halflings and some gnomes, to defend Tethyr.
Estemal had strong determination, which helped him keep the Purple Hills region safer than most other areas during the Tethyrian Interregnum.
During the Interregnum, Estemal and his warriors helped keep the Purple Marches secure. Estemal still led them by 1374 DR.
