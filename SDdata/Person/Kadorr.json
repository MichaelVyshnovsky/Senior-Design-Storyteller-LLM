        "mainbody": "Kadorr was a Zhentarim wizard apprentice of Ashemmi in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.\nKadorr was tall and thin as befit his elven heritage. His hair, including a close-cropped beard and mustache, were chestnut brown and his eyes were hazel. He disliked wearing the traditional robes of a wizard and instead wore woodland colored leggings and a single earring.\nKadorr was a devious individual with great ambition. He hated people who did not give him the correct respect and wanted revenge for also the minor slights. Also, Kadorr became infatuated by Ashemmi and was insanely jealous of both Sememmon and Dag Zoreth.\nKadorr was assigned to Darkhold to study under Ashemmi along with three other apprentices - Ilthond, Sashen, and Yarkul. Kadorr was the star pupil of Ashemmi. She attributed it to his magic ability and his ruthlessness, but it was actually due to his love for her and his desire to impress her. Many at Darkhold ignored him, thinking he was a teachers pet but Kadorr took names of all of those people for future revenge. Yarkul resented his position the most and would have gladly disposed of him if it would have lead to her rising in the ranks.\nA few of his most prized possessions were actually gifts from Ashemmi. They included a pair of bracers of defense, a wand of flame extinguishing, and a single, non-magical earring."
