        "mainbody": "skylla was a former priestess of Lolth who once served under Matron Azurna in the mid-14 century DR.\nEskylla was a priestess but never opened her heart to the darkness of Lolth. She did not know of other gods and eagerly joined the faith of Eilistraee, given the opportunity.\nIn 1370 DR, High Priestess of the Spider Queen, Azurna was leading the drow forces in the divine quest for the Flame Sword of Lolth. The magic weapon was the long lost artifact from the War of the Seldarine, hidden in Undermountain. The drow built a coalition in order to find the item and bring down Waterdeep. During that campaign, Eskylla was stationed in one of the deeper drow strongholds. One of her fellow priestesses was secretly an informant for Sabrae Tellendon of Eilistraee, Kiyanda. After some time, the women became friendly, and Kiyanda introduced Eskylla to another goddess, a kinder one. Subsequently, Kiyanda was caught and imprisoned, while Eskylla was left questioning the word of Lolth. Serendipitously, it was then when an agent of Khelben Arunsun made way into the stronghold, searching for the beings responsible for the recent unrest in the City of Splendors. Seeing the opportunity, Eskylla approached Khelbenite and appealed to his good nature. She told the adventurer that she wants to leave Lolth behind, joining the devotees of Eilistraee, beside Kiyanda and her mistress. There was only one person who stood between Eskylla and her freedom from the evil goddess - the priestess overseer Kastner. She needed to die. Khelbenite agreed to aid the pleading drow woman and aided her and Kiyandas escape."
