        "mainbody": "'''Alesam Mischwin''' was a merchant prince and the Lord of [[Turmish]] in the city [[Alaghôn]] ''circa'' [[270 DR]].",
        "History": "Alesam Mischwin came to power at the same time as [[Laviar Illistine]], ruler of [[Hlondeth]], began amassing troops near Turmish's borders. The nation was locked in political conflicts between the rich and powerful of the nation – merchant houses. Seeing the looming danger, the noble merchant houses united behind Alesam Mischwin. Hlondeth's troops met equal military force from the Turmishian side. As the battle raged, it became obvious that neither side could get the upper hand, resulting in the conflict being remembered as [[The Stalemate]]. Eventually, the Stalemate ended with [[Chondath]]an forces retreating due to the loss of the nation's woodcutting operation."
