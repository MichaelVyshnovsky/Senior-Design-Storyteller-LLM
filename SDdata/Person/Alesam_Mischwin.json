The nation was locked in political conflicts between the rich and powerful of the nation – merchant houses. Seeing the looming danger, the noble merchant houses united behind Alesam Mischwin. Hlondeths troops met equal military force from the Turmishian side. As the battle raged, it became obvious that neither side could get the upper hand, resulting in the conflict being remembered as The Stalemate. Eventually, the Stalemate ended with Chondathan forces retreating due to the loss of the nations woodcutting operation."
