        "History": "One night in [[Suzail]], Belgryn Murenstur was accosted by the [[blueflame ghost]]s [[Relve Langral]] and [[Treth Halonter]], who asked him if he'd seen [[Seszgar Huntcrown]] recently. Belgryn volunteered that the man was at [[the Bold Archer]], a tavern; the ghosts insisted he lead the way, despite his protests he was going home. Seeing their swords were slick with blood and there were bodies not far, he acceded to their demands.\n\nHe then led them to the Bold Archer; under duress, but also under the evil [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]]'s remote mental influence, he reconnoited for them, under duress, that Seszgar Huntcrown had at least six bodyguards, plus many other nobles had brought a retinue. He was thanked; Treth almost slew him, but Relve reminded him they needed to leave a witness."
