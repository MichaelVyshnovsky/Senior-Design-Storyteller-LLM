        "History": "In the year 1368 DR, he partnered himself with an [[ogre]] called [[The Amazing Oompah]] whom he would magically appear to make explode in front of a live audience. This alliance got out of hand when The Amazing Oompah was asked to do too many live shows in one day and attacked a spectator, perishing in the attempt. The Great Gazib ran and was never seen again."
