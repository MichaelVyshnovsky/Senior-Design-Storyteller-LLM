        "mainbody": "The Great Gazib was a traveling circus mage who put on The Great Gazib Show in the Carnival outside of Nashkel during the iron crisis of 1368 DR.\nIn the year 1368 DR, he partnered himself with an ogre called The Amazing Oompah whom he would magically appear to make explode in front of a live audience. This alliance got out of hand when The Amazing Oompah was asked to do too many live shows in one day and attacked a spectator, perishing in the attempt. The Great Gazib ran and was never seen again."
