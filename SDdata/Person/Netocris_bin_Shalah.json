        "mainbody": "etocris bin Shalah was a yuan-ti pureblood ambassador to the necropolis of Ysawis for the population of yuan-ti inhabiting the Grey Jungle in east Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nAs a pureblood, Netocris appeared as an attractive human woman. She wore daringly revealing silk clothing to further enhance her sexuality. Her sharp fangs were only bared when she was angered.\nNetocris exhibited grace and manners in her dealings with the living inhabitants of Ysawis. These outward traits masked her wicked intelligence.\nNetocris maintained the illusion that she was a bored noblewoman from Kadarastro in front of the rulers of Ysawis, hoping to establish an embassy in the city. The reality of the situation was that Netocris was there to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the necromancers ruling the city.\nShe was accompanied by a quartet of yuan-ti halfblood bodyguards at all times.\nShe owned a ring of protection, a magical short sword, and a philter of glibness."
