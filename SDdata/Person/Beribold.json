        "mainbody": "Watcher Beribold was a young cleric of Helm who worked at Luskans Helmite temple in the 1360s DR.\nThe priest was said to be a curious man, who wore religious garments. He was the young assistant of High Watcher Kalorc Risten.\nIn the late 1360s DR, Beribald was hired by the lord of Auckney, Feringal Auck, to cure the condition of Biaste Ganderlay known as the wilting. The man, who was trained in curing the ill, chanted softly and procured oil for the peasant woman. Despite the condition being tough to cure, he managed to lift the affliction completely. After this, Biaste, the mother-in-law-to-be of Feringal, was beaming and back to full health. It was said that the young Beribald had worked a miracle."
