Father Alby was a priest of Kelemvor who watched over the temple in Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR. He was assisted by a younger cleric, Nerys Kathon.
As a faithful of Kelemvor, Alby offered coins as a form of compensation to those who performed favors for the Baldurian church.
Alby was a reasonable and determined man capable of sensible compromise. He did whatever he had to in order to maintain and protect his temple.
Some time in the 1480s DR, he hired the Heroes of Baldurs Gate to investigate some goings-on at his temple.
In 1492 DR, the priest joined the Cult of the Absolute.
