Urdun Brizik () was a half-elf businessman and dancer in Mulmaster.
The half-elf considered himself very lucky that Mulmasters current situation permitted him to join his two interests into a profitable venture. However, he was always in fear of a misstep that could cost him his business and social standing. Urdun liked to flirt with female patrons.
Urdun was a dancer who at one point opened the festhall the Wave and Wink with his wife Kata Brizik. Soon it became one of the most popular festhalls in the city.
In 1491 DR, however, during a party for the birthday of Zora Tiega Gos, his wife inexplicably burned Tiega. He agreed with Zor Faltyn Gos to hire an adventuring party to uncover the truth.
