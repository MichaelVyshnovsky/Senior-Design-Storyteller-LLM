'''Tolodine''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] who developed several wind-, fog-, and cloud-based [[spell]]s.

==Description==
This proficient arcanist was an astute student of [[Sadebreth]], the [[priest]]-arcanist of [[Mystryl]]. Unlike his mentor, Tolodine specialized in [[inventive]] spells.

==History==
Tolodine was born in {{YearlinkConvert|1444|NY}}. The inventor concentrated on developing spells from the [[wind]]s, though the spells he developed were simpler to formulate than those of his tutor, Sadebreth. He lived a short life compared to his mentor, and passed away from old age in {{YearlinkConvert|1501|NY}}.
