Within two years, the formerly down-and-out man had himself a position as one of those very guards stationed at the Twisted Tower.\nDuring the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, he was guarding the gates of the city when the company of Midnight and Kelemvor Lyonsbane arrived before Banes assault. He had a great antipathy for the four adventurers.\nHe survived the Battle of Shadowdale.\nWhen Midnight and Adon, accused of killing Elminster, escaped with the aid of Cyric, the Lord of Shadowdale chose Yarbro and Kelemvor to lead an expedition to recapture them. The company managed to recapture the fugitives but at that point Kelemvor fell victim to his curse and killed most of the men.\nYarbro escaped with some other men and found Cyric.

Only Yarbro and Cyric remained Cyric revealed his evil deeds and killed Yarbro in cold blood."
