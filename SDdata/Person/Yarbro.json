        "mainbody": "'''Yarbro''' was a male [[human]] soldier living in [[Shadowdale]] in the [[Dalelands]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Tantras|102-140}}\n{{Quote|But, milord, they have the look of vagrants!|Yarbro, to Lord Mourngrym regarding a pair of adventurers and [[Kelemvor|future]] [[Midnight|deities]].}}",
        "Activities": "He was a guardsman that protected Lord [[Mourngrym Amcathra]] at the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]].",
        "Personality": "He was known for being rather over-eager in his duties guarding Shadowdale's lord, despite numerous conversations outlining the parameters of his duties.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, Lord Mourngrym's guardsmen found Yarbro with no money and few possessions on the borders of ruined [[Myth Drannor]]. Within two years, the formerly down-and-out man had himself a position as one of those very guards stationed at the Twisted Tower.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], he was guarding the gates of the city when the company of [[Midnight]] and [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]] arrived before [[Bane]]'s assault. He had a great antipathy for the four adventurers.\n\nHe survived the [[Battle of Shadowdale]].\n\nWhen Midnight and [[Adon]], accused of killing [[Elminster]], escaped with the aid of [[Cyric]], the Lord of Shadowdale chose Yarbro and Kelemvor to lead an expedition to recapture them. The company managed to recapture the fugitives but at that point Kelemvor fell victim to his curse and killed most of the men.\n\nYarbro escaped with some other men and found Cyric. Yarbro's bad mood convinced Cyric of his decision, and he manipulated the Dalesmen into believing that he was only a victim of Adon and Midnight.\n\nLater, the [[Company of the Scorpions]] met and killed most of the surviving Dalesmen. Only Yarbro and Cyric remained; Cyric revealed his evil deeds and killed Yarbro in cold blood."
