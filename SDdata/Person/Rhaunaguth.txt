'''Rhaunaguth''' was a mercenary in [[Skullport]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Rhaunaguth was the opposite of his greatest rival, [[Dalagor]]. He was courageous, passionate, and always ready for a fight. Often, he led his troops into battle personally and cried for all the fallen, inspiring total loyalty in all his subjects.

==History==
Rhaunaguth was once a ranger of [[Silvanus]] from [[Tantras]]. However, after his companions were killed by [[hill giant]]s near [[Ravens Bluff]], he developed a hatred for [[giant-kin]], vowing to hunt them all to death. In his quest for revenge, he attacked a [[voadkyn]] lair, causing a massacre. After this, he lost all his ranger abilities.

He retrained himself as a mercenary and in the following years he worked in [[Thesk]], [[Sembia]], and even [[Turmish]], with his reputation rising and attracting more and more followers. In the end, he settled with his company in Skullport.

==Activities==
Rhaunaguth was the leader of one of the three most powerful mercenary groups in the city.

==Possessions==
He wielded a ''+2 [[giant slayer]] [[longsword]]''.<ref>
