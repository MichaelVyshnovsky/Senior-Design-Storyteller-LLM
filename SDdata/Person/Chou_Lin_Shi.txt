Chou Lin Shi was the Minister of the Sea of Shou Lung in 1358 DR.
Chou Lin Shi gained fame by defeating the pirates of Akari. Thanks to that battle, he was promoted to command of a warship with nobody paying attention to his heritage. In time, Chou Lin Shi rose through the ranks until he became minister some years before 1358 DR.
For a long time, Chou Lin Shi had faced no great difficulties in this post. Chou Lin Shi was a great supporter of Grand General Kwan Chan Sen. He worked very hard to kept his heritage hidden and maybe only the Imperial Censors knew about it. Chou Lin Shi however always feared that the Minister of Security would discover his secret and exile him.
