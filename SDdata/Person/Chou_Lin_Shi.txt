'''Chou Lin Shi''' was the Minister of the Sea of [[Shou Lung]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Chou Lin Shi gained fame by defeating the pirates of [[Akari]]. Thanks to that battle, he was promoted to command of a warship with nobody paying attention to his heritage. In time, Chou Lin Shi rose through the ranks until he became minister some years before 1358 DR.

For a long time, Chou Lin Shi had faced no great difficulties in this post. Chou Lin Shi was a great supporter of Grand General [[Kwan Chan Sen]]. He worked very hard to kept his heritage hidden and maybe only the [[Imperial Censors]] knew about it. Chou Lin Shi however always feared that the Minister of Security would discover his secret and exile him.
