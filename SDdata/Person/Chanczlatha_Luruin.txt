Chanczlatha Luruin was a cleric of Lathander and a physic and animal healer who lived at the Healing House in Bargewright Inn in the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.The unnamed "pharmacist who specializes in sick pack animals" in The Savage Frontier p. 28 is presumed to be Chanczlatha Luruin.
He was a revered healer within his community who dedicated his life to treating the sick. He treated people and beasts alike with herbs and healthy broths more than his magic, and fairly successfully. His patients regularly included folk whod run into perils on the way to Bargewright Inn and were taken to his house, and he was not one to leave the community he called home. He also had a specialty in pack animals, given the livestock, travelers, and traders that passed through.
For his services, the physician charged fees of usually 5 gp for a visit and 6 gp to provide care over a full day and night. He also charged for his divine spellcasting, but he was always willing to heal the fellow faithful of Lathander free of charge. The profits helped cover the heavy costs of his medicines and the animals he cared for the Luruins were usually lacking for coin as a result.
One of the nearby paddocks belonged to the Luruins and here they cared for large unwell beasts. Here, travelers could sell aged, weary, or unwell mounts to the Luruins for 5 sp, or if needed purchase a recovering mount for 8 sp the price was negotiated for especially small or poorly specimens. They would care for and keep alive sick and injured animals that others might abandon or euthanize.
Chanczlatha was aided by his family in his efforts.
He was the husband to a woman named Baerlatha. Together, they had a large family of adopted children.
He was a quiet, gentle, and unpretentious man with a stammer and a surprising hidden love of ribald humor and songs.
