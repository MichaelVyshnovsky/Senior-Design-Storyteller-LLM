        "mainbody": "'''Tor Millows''' was a male [[human]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]]. He was a priest of [[Ilmater]].",
        "History": "In [[1374 DR]], Tor went to [[Fort Locke]] to heal people who were robbed by bandits. However, he was robbed and his symbol of Ilmater was taken away. He managed to get to the fort, but requested the [[Kalach-Cha]] to find and bring the symbol back. The symbol was located inside the [[Unnamed bandit camp|bandit's camp]]. If retrieved, Tor would comment on the Kalach-Cha's approach on dealing with the [[bandit leader]]. Rgardless, Torn was able to heal the Kalach-Cha and their companions."
