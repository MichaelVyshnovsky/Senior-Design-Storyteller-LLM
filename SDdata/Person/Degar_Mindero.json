        "mainbody": "egar Mindero was a commander of the Knights in Silver circa 1484 DR.\nThe dwarves of the three citadels—Adbar, Felbarr, and Mithral Hall—described Degar to be an arrogant one. They said he would prowl around the Cold Vale, trying to make his name and looking for glory. He was said to not even ask for help from neighboring settlements on accounts of his renown.\nA knight of Silverymoon claimed the opposite. Degar was described to be incredibly brave, protecting all of Luruar, particularly Felbarr and Sundabar.\nIn 1484 DR, Mindero set out to slay the increasingly aggressive orcs of the Many-Arrows tribe, but was killed in the process.\nFollowing Minderos death, a knight and emissary set off from Silverymoon to Mithral Hall, to convene with the three dwarven kings. The annoyed knight demanded the dwarves to assemble their march, and told them the fate of Mindero, whom the dwarves did not assist. They, however, claimed that Mindero was just out for glory, and didnt even alert the dwarves of his presence, nor those of Sundabar, who had thousands in their garrison. Ragged Dain even stated that Mindero was a fool. This erupted in an argument between the two sides, with the knight nearly drawing his weapon. King Connerad Brawnanvil of Mithral Hall threatened to throw his body down the River Surbrin, to where even his kin could not find him."
