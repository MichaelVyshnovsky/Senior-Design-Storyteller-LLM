        "Relationships": "Akkabar the Younger was the son of Akkabar the Elder's first son. His mother's name was [[Una el Shoon|Una]]. His young sister [[Arhymeria Ithal|Arhymeria]] would become Queen of [[Tethyr]], and his younger brother [[Amahl Shoon I|Amahl]] King of Tethyr after her death. Akkabar was the father of [[Amahl Shoon II]] and grandfather of [[Amahl Shoon III]], the first [[Alzhedo dictionary#Q|''qysar'']] of the Shoon Imperium.",
        "History": "Akkabar was destined to rule over [[Calimshan]] as sole heir of [[Syl-pasha|Syl-Pasha]] Akkabar the Elder's throne. He plotted along with his grandfather how to absorb the kingdom of Tethyr into Calimshan; however, he never saw these plans come to fruition, as he was assassinated in {{Yearlink|-1}} in what was made to look like a bar brawl. His murderers were [[Tethyrian]] clansmen seeking revenge for the death of King Amahl I. This political upheaval caused much suffering in Tethyr, as Akkabar's son Amahl II currently ruled Tethyr as a puppet king.",
