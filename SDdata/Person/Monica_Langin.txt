Monica Langin was a concubine in Grand Caliph Khalil al-Assad al-Zahirs Royal Harim in Huzuz. 
Monica had fiery red hair and was so beautiful that she caught Khalils eye and was asked to join the harem.
After being invited to join the harem, Monica was unsure if life in the harem would be too much of a lifestlye change for the ranger inside of her. She finally accepted Khalils offer, but was unable to fully adapt to that lifestyle. Khalil released her from her obligations six months after she joined the harem. She would stop by periodically and visit.
Monica lived originally far away north from Huzuz.
