'''Meira Faerenduil''' was an [[elf]] knight of [[Myth Drannor]] and later a [[ghost]].{{Cite adventurers league/Herald of the Moon|5-7}}

==History==
Meira was a knight in [[Cormanthor]] and a follower of [[Labelas Enoreth]]. She fought in the [[Crown against Scepter]] war in [[538 DR]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1344}}, at the start of the [[Retreat]], Meira agreed to remain in [[Faerûn]] to protect the [[Eventide Abbey]]. Her oath was so strong that, after the natural end of her life, Meira rose as a ghost to continue to protect the ruins of the abbey.

She remained in that state until the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] when Elanil Elassidil hired an adventuring party to face Meira—her ancestor—in a false battle while disguised as [[Netherese]] in order to bring peace to her spirit.{{Cite adventurers league/Herald of the Moon|25}}

==Relationship==
Meira was the ancestor of [[Elanil Elassidil]], the [[Heralds (local)|herald]] of [[Elventree]]{{Cite adventurers league/Herald of the Moon|7}}
