Quippy was a rock gnome living in Gnomengarde in the late 15 century DR.
Quippy was not afraid to defend herself if attacked, but like most inhabitants of Gnomengarde, she was not likely to start a fight, even if she discovered an intruder in her home.
Like all other gnomes of Gnomengarde, Quippy was a wizard.
