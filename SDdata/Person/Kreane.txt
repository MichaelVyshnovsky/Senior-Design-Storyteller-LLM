Kreane was a palace servant in Castle Obarskyr in Suzail in the late 15 century DR.
He looked young.
He had trysts with the War Wizard Raereene.
At the time when Alusair Obarskyr was helping Elminster sneak around Castle Obarskyr right around the time his body was destroyed in the , the two of them briefly observed Kreane and Raereene having an amorous encounter in the Room of the Fire Wyrm.
Kreane was also accompanying Raereene when Alusair later sought her out to ask the War Wizard to teleport Elminster to Stormserpent Towers, though he didnt get to do much at the time.
