'''Doubleway Douglas Fairbanks''' was a very ambidextrous owner of one particular pair of the ''[[gloves of the balanced hands]]'' in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Doubleway Fairbanks was known for his extreme [[ambidexterity]]. It was said that he was so ambidextrous that "his tears ran down the back of his neck." Whether it was due to owning a pair of [[ranger]] ''gloves of the balanced hands'' from the [[Moonwood]] was unknown. By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Doubleway's magic gloves left his possession and ended up in the hands of a [[Harper]] quartermaster named [[Talli]].
