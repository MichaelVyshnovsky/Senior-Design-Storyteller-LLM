'''Hobart Stubbletoes''' was a mysterious [[halfling]] who sought to defeat the [[undead]] [[bard]] only known as the [[Luremaster]] who laired in the [[Castle Maluradek]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Ah, there you are. I was beginning to wonder if I had the right place. Hail, well met, and all that rubbish. The name's Stubbletoes... Hobart Stubbletoes. And unless I'm mistaken, you must be the legendary heroes of Icewind Dale. Yes?''|Hobart Stubbletoes}}

==Description==
Hobart appeared to be an aging hin of roguish persuasion. He had light skin and wore tan-colored [[enchanted]] ''+2'' [[leather armor]].

==Possessions==
The halfling used a ''light crossbow of speed'' called ''[[the Army Scythe]]'' and the ''[[Whistling Sword]]'' and he wore a pair of the ''[[Brawling Hands]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Hobart Stubbletoes set out to track down the recently famous [[Heroes of Icewind Dale]] who recently ended a demonic threat to the north and set out to help the [[Ten Towns]] against a new [[barbarian]] threat. The mysterious halfling arrived at the town of [[Lonelywood]] sometime before the Heroes' arrival and settled at [[The Whistling Gallows]] inn, waiting for the group impatiently. When they arrived at last, Hobart eagerly tried to entice them to travel with him to a "nearby" castle promising fame and treasures. What the halfling failed to disclose was that the said castle – Castle Maluradek, was a ruin in the desert of [[Anauroch]], haunted by a trap and puzzle-obsessed undead bard – the Luremaster.

When the danger of the barbarians and their ghostly leader was put to rest, the Heroes agreed to follow Hobart to the strange castle. The hin transported them through magic. When the true nature of the castle was revealed, Hobart claimed that he was "just an old halfling" and was no match for the Luremaster, but offered to trade for his impressive collection of powerful magic items to aid the adventurers through the bard's puzzles.

Presumably, the heroes were successful, allowing Hobart Stubbletoes to claim his secret bounty from the defeated bard.
