        "mainbody": "Ruben Churlgo was one of many members of the halfling Churlgo clan who produced the infamous Churlgo Cheese in the Eastern Farmlands of Daggerford circa 1372 DR.\nRuben was a friendly and cheerful middle-aged halfling who often flashed his cheesy smile to the farms guests.\nOne of the oldest members of the Churlgo family, he prefers to work with his hands, leaving all the business decisions to Millie Churlgo.\nRuben, along with the rest of his family, moved their farm from the Dalelands to Daggerford following a nasty extortion business with the Iron Throne. In 1372 DR, the farm where they resided was still noticeably not lived-in, but the cheese-making business was in full swing."
