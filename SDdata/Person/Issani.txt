'''Issani''' was a messanger of [[Waterdeep]].

==Biography==
Issani was sent from [[Waterdeep]] to negotiate with [[Neverwinter]]. However, orcs captured this emissary and was tortured. The Luskans wanted Issani to enter Neverwinter and act as a spy.

==Gameplay==
Whether working with the thieves or the Watch, the [[Kalach-Cha]] and the companions had to rescue Issani from the orcs. They would meet [[Olov|an emissary]] in [[Bonegnasher Lair]], but that emissary is a fraud, who worked with the orcs. Instead, Issani would be found in [[Eyegouger Lair]] and would be transported to Neverwinter.
