Issani was a messanger of Waterdeep.
Issani was sent from Waterdeep to negotiate with Neverwinter. However, orcs captured this emissary and was tortured. The Luskans wanted Issani to enter Neverwinter and act as a spy.
Whether working with the thieves or the Watch, the Kalach-Cha and the companions had to rescue Issani from the orcs. They would meet an emissary in Bonegnasher Lair, but that emissary is a fraud, who worked with the orcs. Instead, Issani would be found in Eyegouger Lair and would be transported to Neverwinter.
