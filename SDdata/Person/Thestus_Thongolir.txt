'''Thestus Thongolir''' was a member of the [[Thongolir]] noble family of [[Waterdeep]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Notably, he had been a priest of many different [[god]]s.{{Cite comic/Lawyers!|10-12}}

==Description==
Thestus was an old man with long gray hair, mustache, and beard and pale eyes. He wore purple robes and a gold earring in his left ear.

==Relations==
He was one of Kyriani's lovers in 1358 DR.

==History==
Thestus was a man in search of a god. He had been a priest of many faiths over the course of his life, both good gods and dark—he was once even a priest of [[Shar]]. But he could never find one to stick with and grew dissatisfied by them all, believing the gods were irresponsible and wasteful. He complained about it to any who would hear.

So he was vindicated by the [[Time of Troubles]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], when the gods were cast down for their misdeeds and forced to walk in mortal form. When a purported [[avatar]] of [[Selûne]] arrived in Waterdeep, and the goddess Shar was also feared to be present, [[Kyriani]] led [[Vajra Valmeyjar|Vajra]] to his villa to consult with him. He explained that the physical and [[magic]] chaos afflicting the Realms was growing worse and that the natural order was collapsing because the gods were not following their true purposes. He told them that he sensed Shar was at the [[House of the Moon]].

By [[1372 DR]], he was a noted expert in religious matters.

==Abilities==
Thestus could sense the magic emanations of godly avatars, like that of Shar.

==Home==
Thestus could be found at the Thongolir family villa in Waterdeep's [[Sea Ward of Waterdeep|Sea Ward]].
