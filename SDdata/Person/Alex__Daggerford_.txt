Alex was one of the inhabitants of Daggerford who died and was buried long before 1372 DR.
After his death, Alex was buried in the Daggerford Graveyard just outside the walls of the city in the Eastern Farmlands. His humble headstone was located in the south-eastern part of the graveyard. Even though the engraving on his headstone suggester otherwise, Alex was not back as of 1372 DR.
