Tarhun Mnemonis was a butler in the employ at Lady Jannaths Estate in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Tarhun was a dragonborn man with pale tan hide and fiery red eyes. He wore an attendants finery and wore a fanciful top hat.
Circa the , Tarhun Mnemonis and Chamberlain Mercer were two of the most trusted servants of Lady Firelia Jannath of Baldurs Gate. When the Ladys estate became haunted by Firelias new husbands ex lover, all of the estates servants were dismissed, including Bailey, Furbleston, Cyrilla, Jooli, Phubbs, and Chef Marjoram. All but Tarhun were placed on temporary leave with the pay of half-wages and allowance to seek temporary employment elsewhere. Butler Mnemonis, however, remained positioned at the estates doors, turning away guests, collecting the wedding gifts and best wishes on Lady Jannaths behalf, and ensuring everyone that she was spending time with her new husband and nothing else. Tarhuns loyalty prevented him from informing anyone of the true reasoning for the Lady not accepting guests. For the same reason, he would let some eager adventurers in who were insistent on investigating the strange happenings, calming that he was on holiday, like the rest of the staff.
