Many years before the , Shazar made a name for himself fro producing some of the finest musicians in all of Mulhorand. Eventually, Shazar commissioned the creation of ten golden lutes to be presented, along with ten minstrels who were to play them, as a gift to the pharaoh of the time. The ruler was a lover of music and a man of terrible temper. Initially, the pharaoh was delighted to receive such a melodious gift and the music the instrument produced in the hands of some of the best minstrels in the realm. However, Shazars instruments were not played by masters of the craft, but rather they were enchanted to boos their users skills. When this became known, the pharaoh ordered Shazar and his minstrels to be executed "just because." Shazars name, however, continued to live on as the pharaoh kept the ten instruments and eventually was interred along with them in his tomb. By the late 14 century DR, his moms was robbed and the golden lutes of Shazar were scattered throughout Faer√ªn.
