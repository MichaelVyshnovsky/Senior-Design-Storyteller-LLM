'''Devilish Qora''' was an unsavory [[tiefling]] [[fighter]] [[mercenary]] from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Qora had crimson skin and horns that showed her [[Mephistopheles]] tiefling bloodline. She wore her red hair in a short bob. As a warrior, Qora wore a simple [[breastplate]] and wielded a [[longsword]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the opportunistic and immoral mercenary [[Aradin Beno]] set out to find the [[Nightsong]] for the [[mage]] [[Lorroakan]]. If the Nightsong, in reality a [[Sel√ªnite]] [[aasimar]], was to reach the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], then Beno had a band of mercenaries with questionable morals ready to attack those who sheltered her. Devilish Qora was among those mercenaries, ready to break into the [[Elfsong Tavern]] to kill and kidnap.
