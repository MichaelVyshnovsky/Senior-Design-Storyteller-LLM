Pharran Nicostas was a drow wight in Blingdenstone.
Pharran was a drow warrior who went to Blingdestone. He refused to go home afterwards and somehow after his death became a wight. He remained sitting on the throne of the citys kings until 1479 DR, when an adventuring party hired by Kargien Dissengulp defeated him and his skeleton minions.
Pharran had in life the ambition to become the conqueror of Blingdenstone and this ambition sustained him even after death.
