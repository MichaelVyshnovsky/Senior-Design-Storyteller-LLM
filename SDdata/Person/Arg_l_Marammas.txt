'''Argûl Marammas''' was a [[wizard]] of note inhabiting [[Suzail]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Argûl was a soft-spoken and patronizing man. He thought most people fools and cattle, especially warrior brutes. He shared no love for wizardly organizations like the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], thinking the attempts to kill and dominate were a waste of energy. The wizard's main drive behind his research was financing his expensive tastes in exotic seafood dishes, decadent sauces, and [[wine]]s.

==Activities==
Argul earned a living by selling magical [[scroll]]s at a stiff price. A single scroll penned to order by Argûl could contain up to three spells, and the service was valued at 5,000 [[gold piece]]s. His scholarly research made Argûl an expert on the planes of existence, while his arcane specialization was in spells that offered protection and concealment.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Argûl's collection of scrolls was so sizable its extent was not known to the wizard himself. He eagerly interviewed those who traveled the planes to aid in further research.
