        "mainbody": "Klauth, also known as Old Snarl, was supposedly one of the eldest dragons alive who had not been turned into a dracolich. \nHe was thoroughly evil, especially to his own kind, though he did have a few redeeming factors such as granting boons to creatures he considered no threat, crushing the odd orc horde on a whim, and the fact that he has avoided the advances of the Cult of the Dragon. \nFor such an active dragon of his age, he had lived much longer than his races life expectancy would normally allow without the aid of the Cults methods. This was because he had developed a magical process in which he used red dragons eggs to increase his own size, health, and vigor.\nKlauth had his lair in the northern Sword Coast, in a narrow winding valley dubbed Klauthen Vale in the mountains west of Mirabar. From there Old Snarl used his powerful scrying spells and abilities to learn as much as possible about the other inhabitants of the Sword Coast this means the old wyrm was rarely caught off guard by intruders.\nHe was an acquaintance of Iymrith the \"Desert Doom\", the great blue dragon of Anauroch.\nthumb|right|350px|Klauth demonstrating the force of his will.\nIn  the  Klauth and the green dragon Aglaraerose devoured a horde of orcs in the Spine of the World mountains. On Mirtul 4 in 1360 DR, Klauth was waylaid by a pair of white dragons&mdashAerihykloarara and Ruuthundrarar&mdashand the blue dragon Irdrithkryn, who worked in concert to kill him. Although Klauth slew each of his attackers and plundered Irdrithkryns lair, he was gravely wounded, almost losing a wing and having half his body frozen solid. After this battle, Klauth found a new lair just west of Raven Rock to recuperate, this lair became known as Klauthen Vale. \nKlauth succumbed to the effects of the Dracorage mythal during the Rage of Dragons in the , appearing above Mirabar full of rage with a mind set on destruction. After leveling much of the surface city he was only barely driven off by the combined efforts of Mirabars defenders and the crystal dragon, Saryndalaghlothtor.\nWhen the Cult of the Dragon reemerged during the late 15 century DR, Klauth welcomed the dragon cultists to dwell within his vale in the Spine of the North."
