        "mainbody": "'''Klauth''', also known as '''Old Snarl''', was supposedly one of the eldest [[dragons]] alive who had not been turned into a [[dracolich]]. \n\n{{quote|''I am old as time itself, the infinite wisdom of eternity is mine to command. Your name and your deeds are known to me, [[Hero of Neverwinter]], and I shall remember them long after history has forgotten you.''|Klauth}}",
        "Personality": "He was thoroughly evil, especially to his own kind, though he did have a few redeeming factors such as granting boons to creatures he considered no threat, crushing the odd [[orc]] horde on a whim, and the fact that he has avoided the advances of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].",
        "Activities": "For such an active dragon of his age, he had lived much longer than his race's life expectancy would normally allow without the aid of the Cult's methods. This was because he had developed a magical process in which he used red dragons' eggs to increase his own size, health, and vigor.",
        "Lair": "Klauth had his lair in the northern [[Sword Coast]], in a narrow winding valley dubbed [[Klauthen Vale]] in the mountains west of [[Mirabar]]. From there Old Snarl used his powerful [[scrying]] spells and abilities to learn as much as possible about the other inhabitants of the [[Sword Coast]]; this means the old wyrm was rarely caught off guard by intruders.",
        "Relationships": "He was an acquaintance of [[Iymrith]] the \"Desert Doom\", the great [[blue dragon]] of [[Anauroch]].",
        "History": {
            "Rage of Dragons": "Klauth succumbed to the effects of the [[Dracorage mythal]] during the [[Rage of Dragons]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, appearing above Mirabar full of rage with a mind set on destruction. After leveling much of the surface city he was only barely driven off by the combined efforts of Mirabar's defenders and the [[crystal dragon]], [[Saryndalaghlothtor]].",
            "Tyranny of Dragons": "When the [[Cult of the Dragon]] reemerged during the late 15{{th}} century DR, Klauth welcomed the dragon cultists to dwell within his vale in the Spine of the North."
