'''Kendrick Selkirk''' was the Overmaster of [[Sembia]] for a time during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], from [[1372 DR]] to [[1374 DR]].

==Personality==
Born in the wealthy [[Selkirk]] family, Kendrick was an honest man. This contrasted with the rest of his family, especially his cousin [[Mirabeta Selkirk]] and her sons and nephew. 

He was a devout follower of [[Tyr]], to the point that his testament forbade his own ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]'' because he did not wish to oppose his god's will.

==History==
Kendrick was elected Overmaster in [[1371 DR]] after the death by old age of [[Elduth Yarmmaster]]. However, unlike his predecessor, Kendrick heavily depended on the help of his family, especially his eldest son [[Miklos Selkirk]].

In 1374 DR, he sent [[Borstag Duncastle]], then later his son Miklos to deal with the [[Cormanthor War]].

Later that year however, Kendrick was poisoned and killed by [[Rivalen Tanthul]] of [[Thultanthar]]. He was not resurrected as per his religious beliefs.
