'''Turiel''' was a [[scourge aasimar]] [[cleric]] of [[Bahamut]].

==Description==
A dark-skinned male with shoulder-length, white hair, Turiel's features were marred by gray-blue lines caused by his divine heritage. He wore ceremonial [[plate mail]] and a stylized mask representing his deity, Bahamut. His weapon of choice was a [[staff]] in the shape of a [[metallic dragon]].

==Personality==
Turiel was an extremely devout and zealous adherent of Bahamut whose life revolved around holy missions handed down from his deity. He worked to rid [[Toril]] of lawlessness, chaos, and injustice.

==Abilities==
As a cleric in good standing with Bahamut, Turiel could cast several [[spell]]s, including ''[[sacred flame]]''. He could also ''[[channel divinity]]'' to produce effects such as ''[[order's demand]]'' and ''[[voice of authority]]''.

==Activities==
When not carrying out crusades or inquisitions, Turiel resided in [[Candlekeep]], where he conducted research and petitioned Bahamut for guidance.
