        "mainbody": "'''Stool''' was a [[myconid|myconid sprout]] living in [[Neverlight Grove]] in the [[Underdark]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], it was captured by [[Sarith Kzekarit]], who took it to the [[drow]] outpost of [[Velkynvelve]].",
        "Personality": "Stool's main concern was to return to its fellows. If it grew attached to [[humanoid]] people, it acted like a curious and enthusiastic younger sibling. At the hands of the drow, it felt lonely and frightened.",
        "Powers": "Thanks to its spores, it could communicate telepathically with other creatures and could also act as bridge between two creatures without a common language in order to communicate."
