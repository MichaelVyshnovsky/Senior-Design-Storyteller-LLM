        "mainbody": "tool was a myconid sprout living in Neverlight Grove in the Underdark in the late 15 century DR.\nCirca 1486 DR, it was captured by Sarith Kzekarit, who took it to the drow outpost of Velkynvelve.\nStools main concern was to return to its fellows. If it grew attached to humanoid people, it acted like a curious and enthusiastic younger sibling. At the hands of the drow, it felt lonely and frightened.\nThanks to its spores, it could communicate telepathically with other creatures and could also act as bridge between two creatures without a common language in order to communicate."
