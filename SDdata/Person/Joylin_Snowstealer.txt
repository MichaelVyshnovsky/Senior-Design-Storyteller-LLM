On Marpenoth 14 of , when Raryn returned to The Great Glacier, he found her along the way, and saved her from several tirichiks which had eaten her kupuks while she explored an abandoned village. She helped guide them back to her village, where they were poisoned by her father Wurik Snowstealer, under duress from the forces of Iyraclea. When her forces arrived at the village to take away the captives, her father was killed for trying to protect his brother from the same fate.
On Marpenoth 17 Joylin was approached by Brimstone. She informed him that Karasendrieth and Raryns party were prisoners of Iyraclea.
