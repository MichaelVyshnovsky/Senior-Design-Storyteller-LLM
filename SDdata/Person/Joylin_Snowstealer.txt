'''Joylin Snowstealer''' was an [[arctic dwarf]] from [[the Great Glacier]], and [[Raryn Snowstealer]]'s niece.

On [[Marpenoth 14]] of {{yearlink|1373}}, when Raryn returned to [[The Great Glacier]], he found her along the way, and saved her from several [[tirichik]]s which had eaten her [[kupuk]]s while she explored an abandoned village. She helped guide them back to her village, where they were poisoned by her father [[Wurik Snowstealer]], under duress from the forces of [[Iyraclea]]. When her forces arrived at the village to take away the captives, her father was killed for trying to protect his brother from the same fate.{{cite book/The Ruin||3}}

On [[Marpenoth 17]] Joylin was approached by [[Brimstone]]. She informed him that [[Karasendrieth]] and Raryn's party were prisoners of Iyraclea.{{cite book/The Ruin||4}}
