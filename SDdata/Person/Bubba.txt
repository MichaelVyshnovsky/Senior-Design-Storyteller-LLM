Bubba was a saru warrior, adopted and raised by the reformed cannibal Kukalatu tribe of the Malatran Plateau in the late 14 century DR.
Bubba was a dextrous warrior and hunter of the Kukalatu Village, comfortable along the jungle vines and treetops, alongside his Nubari comrade, Bifu. He was a large humanoid, bigger than most Kukalaturi of the tribe, to whom he referred simply as "People."
Bubba used his strong fists in battle and was armed with a net.
Some years before the late 14 century DR, very young Bubba and his brother Vimu were rescued by the Kukalatu warriors after their parents were killed by the dreaded leopard katangas. The saru duo were adopted by the tribe and raised as members of the community. In The Year of New Peoples of the Malatran calendar, a band of heroes of the Living Jungle was sent to the Kukalatu tribe by Chief Katar of the Koshiva to establish contact with the reformed cannibal and return with a special healing potion for the Chiefs wife – Ootoo. A Kukulaturi hunting party was the first contact for the heroes who ran into them not far from the village. Warriors Bifu and eJahi were the ones to meet the group in the open, while others – Gihu, Latu, Bubba and Vimu, stayed hidden, in case the strangers brought trouble.
