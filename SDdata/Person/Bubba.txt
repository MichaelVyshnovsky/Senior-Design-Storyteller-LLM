'''Bubba''' was a [[saru]] [[warrior]], adopted and raised by the reformed cannibal [[Kukalatu]] tribe of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Me bigger that most People.''|Bubba the Saru}}

==Description==
Bubba was a dextrous warrior and hunter of the Kukalatu Village, comfortable along the jungle vines and treetops, alongside his [[Nubari]] comrade, [[Bifu]]. He was a large humanoid, bigger than most Kukalaturi of the tribe, to whom he referred simply as "People."

==Possessions==
Bubba used his strong fists in battle and was armed with a [[net]].

==History==
Some years before the late 14{{th}} century DR, very young Bubba and his brother [[Vimu]] were rescued by the Kukalatu warriors after their parents were killed by the dreaded [[leopard katanga]]s. The saru duo were adopted by the tribe and raised as members of the community. In The Year of New Peoples of the Malatran calendar, a band of heroes of the Living Jungle was sent to the Kukalatu tribe by Chief [[Katar (Nubari)|Katar]] of the [[Koshiva]] to establish contact with the reformed cannibal and return with a special healing [[potion]] for the Chief's wife – [[Ootoo]]. A Kukulaturi hunting party was the first contact for the heroes who ran into them not far from the village. Warriors Bifu and [[eJahi]] were the ones to meet the group in the open, while others – [[Gihu]], [[Latu]], Bubba and Vimu, stayed hidden, in case the strangers brought trouble.
