        "mainbody": "'''Beornegar''' was a well-respected member of the [[Tribe of the Elk]] of [[Icewind Dale]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "He was killed in a battle with another [[Reghedman]] [[barbarian]] tribe.",
        "Relationships": "Beornegar was the son of [[Beorne]].\n\nBeornegar was the father of [[Wulfgar]], who, after the Reghedmen attempted to destroy [[Ten-Towns]], was placed under indentured servitude by [[Bruenor]]. Despite promising to kill the [[dwarf]], Wulfgar began to see Bruenor as a father figure, not to replace Beornegar, but in addition to him. Beornegar's tales of [[Ingeloakastimizilian|Icingdeath]] and his discovery of an entrance into the [[dragon]]'s lair led Wulfgar to defeat the dragon as a coming-of-age rite.\n\nAfter [[Delly Curtie]] died, it was Wulfar's memories of Beornegar that prompted him to return to Icewind Dale. Most of his friends realized his plans before Wulfgar told of them since he had started referring to himself as \"son of Beornegar\", a title he had not used for quite some time.<ref>\n\nBeornegar and [[Revjak]] were close friends during their lives."
