        "mainbody": "Beornegar was a well-respected member of the Tribe of the Elk of Icewind Dale in the midâ€“14 century DR. \nHe was killed in a battle with another Reghedman barbarian tribe.\nBeornegar was the son of Beorne.\nBeornegar was the father of Wulfgar, who, after the Reghedmen attempted to destroy Ten-Towns, was placed under indentured servitude by Bruenor. Despite promising to kill the dwarf, Wulfgar began to see Bruenor as a father figure, not to replace Beornegar, but in addition to him. Beornegars tales of Icingdeath and his discovery of an entrance into the dragons lair led Wulfgar to defeat the dragon as a coming-of-age rite.\nAfter Delly Curtie died, it was Wulfars memories of Beornegar that prompted him to return to Icewind Dale. Most of his friends realized his plans before Wulfgar told of them since he had started referring to himself as \"son of Beornegar\", a title he had not used for quite some time.\nBeornegar and Revjak were close friends during their lives."
