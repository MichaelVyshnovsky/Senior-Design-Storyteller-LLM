        "mainbody": "Marl was a farmer who lived in Beregost during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nSometime around 1368 DR, Marls son Kennair Nethalin was inspired by adventures passing through Beregost, and set out to make the Sword Coast a safer place for others. He died at some point during his journey, though the exact circumstances were unknown.\nMarl became despondent after Kennairs passing, and started drinking heavily at Feldeposts Inn along with his friend Dunkin.\nMarl became something of a drunk following the loss of his son. He held on to his anger and directed it towards adventurers, especially those that came to Beregost."
