        "Home": "Teseryne had lived all her life in the Delimbiyr Vale. By the early 1370s DR, she made her home in a cottage on the north bank of the [[Delimbiyr River]], near [[Loudwater]]. It was nestled amongst flower gardens that produced a dazzling range of colors and shapes when in full bloom. A cobblestone path wended through them to door. Bird houses, a half-dozen at least, were placed around the gardens, with some mounted on poles, others mounted in the trees, and others hanging from the cottage's eaves.",

        "Activities": "She knew much local lore and history of the Delimbiyr Vale and [[Eaerlann]]. She would not receive visitors after nightfall, but during the day would invite them in for a repast such as [[shortbread]] and [[spearmint]] [[tea]] while they spoke.",
