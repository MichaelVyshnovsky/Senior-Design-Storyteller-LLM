Brymoel was a male orc cleric and one of the sons of King Obould Many-Arrows.
A fantacial devotee of Gruumsh, Brymoel envisioned all the orcs of the Spine of the World being ruled over by his deitys clerics.
Born as the son of Obould Many-Arrows, Brymoel grew up to be one of his most ambitious spawn. By 1372 DR, Obould worried that the lands he hand conquered would not be enough for Brymoel and his brothers, especially Scrauth and Araug, so the King often sent him away on ranging patrols to keep them busy.
