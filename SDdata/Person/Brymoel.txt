'''Brymoel''' was a male [[orc]] [[cleric]] and one of the son's of King [[Obould Many-Arrows]].

==Personality==
A fantacial devotee of [[Gruumsh]], Brymoel envisioned all the [[orc]]s of the [[Spine of the World]] being ruled over by his deity's [[cleric]]s.

==History==
Born as the son of [[Obould Many-Arrows]], Brymoel grew up to be one of his most ambitious spawn. By [[1372 DR]], Obould worried that the lands he hand conquered would not be enough for Brymoel and his brothers, especially [[Scrauth]] and [[Araug]], so the King often sent him away on ranging patrols to keep them busy.
