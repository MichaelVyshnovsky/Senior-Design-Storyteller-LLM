'''Johl''' was a man that lived in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faer√ªn]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|She could shoot fireworks out of her backside for all I care; the hag has 'Rina.|Johl, to [[Demir]].}}

==Personality==
He was a bit of a hot-head, reacting quickly rather than think situations over and plotting a course of action.

==Possessions==
While he had little in the way of weapons, Johl could wield a [[pitchfork]] like nobody's business.

==Relationships==
Johl had two siblings, a brother [[Demir]] and sister [[Mayrina]].

==History==
Johl's sister was devastated in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when her husband [[Connor Vinderblad|Connor]] died. Left with an unborn child with little means to care for them, Mayrina fled her brothers' care for the [[Sunlit Wetlands]] to strike a deal with the [[green hag|old hag]] that lived in an [[Riverside Teahouse|isolated shack]] within.

The two brothers followed Mayrina's trail to the wetlands and managed to confront the old woman [[Ethel]] before she made it her shack.
