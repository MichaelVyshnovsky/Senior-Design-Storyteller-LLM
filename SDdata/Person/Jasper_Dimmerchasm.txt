'''Jasper Dimmerchasm''' was a [[shield dwarf]] member of the [[Zhentarim]] and prisoner of the [[fire giant]]s in [[Ironslag]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR Jasper went to negotiate with Duke [[Zalto]]. However, the lord of Ironslag decided he did not need the [[Zhent]]'s help and captured him. Zalto put the shield dwarf inside the head of his iron maul weapon.
