        "mainbody": "'''Guul Shatterneck''' was a bandit once active in [[northwest Faerûn]].\n\nGuul and his kin were bandits. They used the magical [[spear]]s called [[black kumade (spear)|''black kumades'']] to overwhelm their victims.\n\nHowever, rather unwisely, they attacked members of the [[Gray Wolf Tribe]] and took them captive, not thinking to learn more about their victims first. Come the next full moon, the [[werewolves]] escaped and tore their captors apart. Thereafter, the ''black kumades'' circulated the North by [[1372 DR]]."
