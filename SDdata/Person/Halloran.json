His master's summonings went horribly wrong as the tentacled beast being summoned pushed through the summoning circle, distracting the apprentice youth from his task and leading to Arquiuius's demise. Halloran fled his master's tower in horror and spent some time on the streets of [[Mulsanter]] in [[Thay]] as an orphan and an urchin. At some point ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1352}}, Cordell and [[Daggrande]] of the Golden Legion met the lost child and took him away from the land of the [[Red Wizards]]. Halloran willingly joined the mercenary company of his rescuers and spent the next decade serving as a page under [[dwarf]] [[crossbow]]er leader Daggrande and, then Broker and his cavalry [[lance]]rs. Eventually he settled in [[Amn]] and became a talented commander and lancer in his own right.",
