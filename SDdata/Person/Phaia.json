        "mainbody": "'''Phaia''' was a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] in the [[Doomvault]] dungeon in the 1480s DR.",
        "Personality": "Phaia was a true believer of [[Szass Tam]]. She was also opportunistic and self-obsessed like her master, even ready to betray him to save her own life. Phaia believed that no magic was too dangerous and no experiment too dark if it provided power for herself.",
        "History": "Phaia was a Red Wizard assigned to the secret complex of Doomvault under [[Thaymount]]. She was a subordinate of [[Lahnis]], but also there to guarantee the loyalty of her superior to Tam's cause.\n\nIn the 1480s DR, she was tasked with draining the soul of a prisoner, [[Kelson Darktreader]], in order to power [[undead]] creatures. When the heroes of [[Daggerford]] arrived, Phaia fought them and was defeated."
