'''Nafyrra Dyrr''' was a member of [[House Agrach Dyrr]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] until [[1372]].

==History==
Nafyrra commanded a contingent of 80 warriors, mostly of her house, at the [[Rhazzt's Dilemma]] outpost in order to detect enemies arriving during the [[Silence of Lolth]]. [[Duergar]]s and [[tanarukk]] bypassed Nafyrra and her troops and captain [[Nimor Imphraezl|Zhayemd]] later reported that she and her soldiers were all killed. However, this was all a lie because the truth was that House Dyrr had allied with the invaders.
