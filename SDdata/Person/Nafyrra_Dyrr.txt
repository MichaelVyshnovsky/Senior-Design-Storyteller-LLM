Nafyrra Dyrr was a member of House Agrach Dyrr of Menzoberranzan until 1372.
Nafyrra commanded a contingent of 80 warriors, mostly of her house, at the Rhazzts Dilemma outpost in order to detect enemies arriving during the Silence of Lolth. Duergars and tanarukk bypassed Nafyrra and her troops and captain Zhayemd later reported that she and her soldiers were all killed. However, this was all a lie because the truth was that House Dyrr had allied with the invaders.
