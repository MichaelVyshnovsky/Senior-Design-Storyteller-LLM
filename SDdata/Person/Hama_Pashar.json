        "mainbody": "Hama Pashar was a human wizard and adventurer.\nShe had a keen interest in both ancient and modern cultures, though she preferred a hand-on approach to her studies rather than poring through books. Hama was especially fond of exploring ruins and methodically uncovering their secrets, and was far more interested in acquiring knowledge than treasure.\nHama was part of an adventuring troupe with the bard Ellywick Tumblestrum, the paladin Nadaar, and the ranger Varis."
