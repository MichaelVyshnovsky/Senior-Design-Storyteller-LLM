        "mainbody": "Dorlas was a dwarf warrior of the Sons of Baltar in the Iron Mountains, and a companion of Sunbright Steelshanks.\nDorlas had strawberry-blond braided hair and beard, and hardened skin. The dwarf wore a steel helmet with a symbol of a compass painted on it, a steel cuirass, leather armor, and a huge backpack. For his weapons of choice, Dorlas used a ridged warhammer and a crossbow.\nCirca , an expedition was to set out to the east to gain an audience with the One King. Sunbright Steelshanks was to join the party, which consisted of several travelers, as well as the half-elf, Greenwillow, and the dwarf, Dorlas. Dorlas welcomed the barbarian to the group, and shook his hand, even though Greenwillow immediately wanted Sunbright out.\nDuring their mission, a Neth hunt began. Netherese hunters charged towards the group, and Dorlas grabbed a hunters lance, and swung his warhammer into the riders face, killing him. Yet, the lance was driven into Dorlas chest, and he too, passed away. He had sacrificed himself for his comrades. \nLater, Dorlas body was recovered. A trio of dwarves spent the night making a coffin for the heroic dwarf, and together with Greenwillow and Sunbright, sprinkled soil on top of the coffin. The coffin was then placed into the river, where it would flow south to his homeland.\nAfter his funeral, Mondar, one of the dwarves who had made the coffin, offered Dorlas warhammer to any of the group. Sunbright took it, believing he could use it to honor Dorlas. The barbarian later planned to visit the original home of Dorlas and return his weapon. Sunbright with fought Dorlas warhammer, as well as Harvester of Blood, from there on, and swore that Dorlas was the doughtiest fighter hed ever met."
