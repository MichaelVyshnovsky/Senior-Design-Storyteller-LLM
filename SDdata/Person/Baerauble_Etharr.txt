Baerauble Etharr (later Baerauble the Venerable and Baerauble the Wise) was a Netherese wizard who lived for many years in the company of the elves inhabiting Cormanthyr, and later became the first Royal Magician of Cormyr.
Baerauble was tall and lean with a ratty, reddish beard. While living with the elves, he wore elven green linen leggings and jacket.
