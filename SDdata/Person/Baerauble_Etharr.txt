==Description==
Baerauble was tall and lean with a ratty, reddish beard. While living with the elves, he wore elven green [[linen]] [[leggings]] and jacket.

==Personality==
Baerauble did not enjoy the company of most humans. He was a quiet, humble, and kind man much more at home with elves.

==Abilities==
His long life allowed him to become very skilled and powerful in [[the Art]].

==Activities==
Baerauble was the first Mage Royal of Cormyr and served as an advisor to [[Ondeth Obarskyr]] and his son, the first king, [[Faerlthann Obarskyr]], He was the founder of a Council of Mages that became the [[War Wizards]] during the reign of [[Rhiiman Obarskyr the Glorious]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|70}}.{{Cite dragon/307/Heroes of Cormyr: Adventuring in the Forest Kingdom|48-49}}

==Relationships==
Baerauble was the consort of the elven mage [[Alea Dahast]] and they had a son named [[Baergast Etharr|Baergast]]. Baergast's son [[Aulard Etharr|Aulard]] married [[Emrylara Etharr|Emrylara Rallyhorn]], the daughter of Lord [[Theldrin Rallyhorn]].

Another descendant of Baerauble and Alea was [[Amedahast]]. She took over the position of Mage Royal after Baerauble's death.{{Cite dragon/407/Crowns and Mantles: The Ranks and Titles of Cormyr|29}} The High Wizard [[Vangerdahast]] was also a descendant of Baerauble.

==History==
Baerauble was born in the {{YearlinkName|-116}}.{{Cite dragon/307/Heroes of Cormyr: Adventuring in the Forest Kingdom|46}}

In the {{YearlinkName|-75}}, Baerauble was captured and imprisoned by a band of humans in the forest of [[Cormanthor]], until rescued by Alea Dahast and a group of elven hunters. He would later become Alea's lover. When Ondeth Obarskyr and his settlers arrived on the land that would later become [[Suzail]] in the {{YearlinkName|6}}, Baerauble introduced himself and became a kind of intermediary between the humans and elves. By the {{YearlinkName|16}}, there was some feeling within the elven community that he had become a puppet for the humans.

When the kingdom of Cormyr was founded in the {{YearlinkName|26}}, [[Iliphar Nelnueve]] appointed Baerauble as advisor to the first king, Faerlthann Obarskyr, despite Baerauble's disapproval on the grounds that he wanted to remain with Alea and their children.

During the reign of [[Boldovar Obarskyr]], Baerauble used his magic to partially control the madness of the king. He also foiled five plots against the regent.

By the {{YearlinkName|245}}, Baerauble had become known as "Baerauble the Venerable" in his position as High Wizard of Cormyr.

By the {{YearlinkName|376}}, Baerauble was very thin and frail, with a bald head. He had a few white strands of hair where his beard and eyebrows had been. He required a staff to walk anywhere and had to be carried in a chair over longer distances. He finally died in the {{YearlinkName|429}}.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was said that Baerauble's long life was owed to the elves who gave him ''[[Potion of longevity|potions of longevity]]''.
