        "mainbody": "'''Rannigan''' was an investigator of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] who lived in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{Quote|Loravyre says they'll attune the ritual properly or something, I'm an investigator, not a wizard.|Rannigan, to a tiefling adventurer.}}",
        "Relationships": "He was an associate of [[Loravyre Impkith]], a [[tiefling]] [[wizard]] and fellow member of the Neverwinter Guard.",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Rannigan recruited tiefling adventurers in the [[Blacklake District]] of the city to carry out some missions in opposition to the [[Ashmadai]], such as getting proof of affiliation from disguised cultists. He also wanted to warn the violent [[Nashers]] branch of the [[Sons of Alagondar]] against the devil-worshipers, as he believed the Ashmadai were a much graver threat to the city. To this end, he had the adventurer put up warning posters.\n\nSome time later, Rannigan traveled east to [[Helm's Hold]] to continue his investigation against the Ashmadai cult, but remained stuck outside the city's gates during the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]]. Working alongside [[Satarin|Brother Satarin]], he discovered that some of the ''[[pact blade]]s'' used by the Ashmadai [[warlock]]s were not pacted to the [[archdevil]] [[Asmodeus]]."
