'''Meraera''' was a [[sun elf]] [[wizard]] and an [[Olin Gisir]] active in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She had studied ancient lore in and around [[Silverymoon]] in the [[Silver Marches]] for many years.

==Abilities==
In addition to being a capable wizard, Meraera had the skills and powers of an Olin Gisir, possessing ancient knowledge, the ability to read mystic omens, the power to ward off [[fiend]]s, and a knack for finding what was hidden.

==Equipment==
She wore an ''[[amulet of natural armor]] +1'', ''[[bracers of armor]] +2'', a ''[[cloak of resistance]] +2'', a ''[[headband of intellect]] +2'', and a ''[[ring of protection]] +1'', and fought with a masterwork [[rapier]] and [[longbow]]. She was also equipped with a ''[[lens of detection]]'', an ''[[elixir of vision]]'', a few ''[[potion]]s of [[cure light wounds]]'', and a ''[[scroll]] of [[greater magic weapon]]''.

==Relations==
Meraera had a [[raven]] [[familiar]] named [[Feor]].

==History==
In the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Meraera learned of a recently discovered tower in the ruins of the ancient sun elven realm of [[Siluvanede]]. She quickly went to an adventurers' guild in search of adventurers to accompany her on expedition to there.

She once explored the ruins of a temple to the [[Abyss]]al [[demon lord]] [[Astaroth]], and feared he slumbered within, but claimed to be prepared.<ref group="note">It is unclear if the temple to Astaroth was found within the Siluvanedenn ruins, though this is likely given that realm's history.
