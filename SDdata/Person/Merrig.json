        "mainbody": "'''Merrig''' was a [[salt]]y old sea dog of a Captain from the city of [[Westgate]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Oh, excellent! Another lubber come to hear me tales o' wit! Well, grab a mug and pull up a chair, but shut yer trap in any case. I'm just comin' to the good part!''|Captain Merrig}}",
        "Description": "Merrig was an old [[human]] man with hair whitened by age long before its time. His face was rugged and weathered by the sea and sun. Despite his intimidating look, Merrig was a jolly man with a wide, welcoming smile that hid his hardened inner steel. He was also said to be able to bring an [[ogre]] under the table.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Merrig was already an aged man. He could often be found in [[Westgate]]'s [[Black Eye Tavern]], drinking [[ale]] and telling mariner stories. When questioned, Merrig claimed to be a \"pirate hunter,\" but he was open to any lucrative business partnerships. He did not seem to care about the city guard finding out about his illicit operations."
