'''Borold''' was a guard in [[Waterdeep]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was married to [[Nalitheen]]. They had two daughters, [[Boroldira]] and [[Naleetha]].

==History==
He was slain two summers prior to Eleint of {{yearlink|1321}}, suggesting it was before summer of 1321 and 1320 as well, in a campaign in which pirates of [[Amn]], led by [[Mirt the Merciless]], pillaged a cargo of silver bars belonging to the [[Lords of Waterdeep]].

==Legacy==
His wife [[Nalitheen]], still with two daughters, became destitute, and took to street work to make ends meet. She later met Mirt the Merciless, whom she almost knifed.
