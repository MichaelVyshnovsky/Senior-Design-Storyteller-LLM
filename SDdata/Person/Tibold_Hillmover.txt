Tibold Hillmover was a dwarven cleric.
He had tan skin, a brown beard with no mustache, and wore a metal helmet.
Like his peers, Tibold enjoyed combat, but he also understood the value of religion. He was a ferocious combatant, but otherwise calm and soft-spoken.
Tibold was skilled in the healing arts.
He owned a suit of plate mail and a large shield, as well as several magical items, including a staff of curing, a rod of smiting, a girdle of dwarvenkind, and a hammer +3.
Tibold was a cousin of Worden Ironfist, the clan hero.
Together with Udall Granitecrusher and Vasos Flameslayer, Tibold was part of an adventuring band led by Worden Ironfist. On one mission, they sought to eliminate a tribe of giants who encroached on their lands.
