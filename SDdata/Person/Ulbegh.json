As ''Spellfire'' starts in Flamerule and lasts for two months, and ''Hand of Fire'' ends before 1358, \"last\" summer has to be 1356, because the narration occurs almost certainly through autumn; had it been the summer of 1357, it would likely not be referred to as \"last\" summer. was his source for the report that [[Ornrim]] had been replaced by a shapeshifter. Tornar knew it was [[Tessaril Winter]]."
