Kharkos was a young warrior inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Kharkos was eager to form his own adventuring company, gathering at least four other would-be adventurers before setting out for glory and riches.
He wore an enchanted suit of chainmail and carried a shield and longsword.
