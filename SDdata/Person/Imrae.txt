Imrae was a handmaiden of Lolth who lived in Ust Natha around 1368 DR.
She was a typical female drow, cruel and ruthless. She would get maddened if spoken to by a male without permission. Imrae believed that foreigners had no place in Ust Natha, and would usually sell them to slavers, or to the tavern for amusement. The handmaiden gave Solaufein a blessed item of Lolth that would pull illithids from their astral travels.
In 1368 DR, she may have assigned both Solaufein and the party of Gorions Ward to intercept a group of mind flayers who had captured a matron mothers daughter, called Phaere.
