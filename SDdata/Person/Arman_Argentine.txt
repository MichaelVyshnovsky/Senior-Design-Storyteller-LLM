Arman Argentine was a dwarven member of the Tethyamar expedition during the 1480s DR.
Arman had bright orange beard and bald head, wore a practical green outfit, and carried a pickaxe.
Arman was very enthusiastic about the expedition, and shared it with the people of Eveningstar. This vigor was in part due to the intoxicating effect of the Jewels of Ardor.
After the Tethyamar expedition got into full swing, Arman traveled to Eveningstar in Cormyr to spread the good word about the impossibly wonderful gemstones to be found there, the Jewels of Ardor. He brought some samples with him to show off, and began recruiting optimistic and opportunistic locals and adventurers to join the effort, unaware of the danger waiting for them.
