'''Dagnalla Irongard''' was a powerful [[wizard]] and [[adventurer|ex-adventurer]] who retired to live in [[Yhaunn]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] when she married into the [[Thingoleir]] family.

==Personality==
Dagnalla was an experienced and cunning wizard who enjoyed drinking, adventuring, and dueling.

==Relationships==
Dagnalla was married to [[Strasus Thingoleir]] and mother of [[Malia Thingoleir|Malia]], [[Roderio Thingoleir|Roderio]] and [[Keph Thingoleir|Keph]], mother-in-law to [[Krin Foxrun]], and grandmother of [[Adrey Foxrun|Adrey]]. She had a deep love and respect for Strasus, who she enjoyed having mage duels with.

Although she loved her children, her relationship with Keph was strained as he had no magical ability and he came to resent her and the rest of the wizarding family.

She earned friendships with a great deal of [[dwarves]] during her adventuring years, and they would come visit her in Yhaunn for drinks.

==History==
Dagnall was born in the rural country north-east of [[Waterdeep]] and became an adventuring mage after completing her apprenticeship. During her wanderings, she came into repeated conflict with the rival adventurer Strasus the Bold, but their rivalry eventually turned into affection. They adventured together for a time before retiring to Yhaunn and starting a family at [[Fourstaves House]].

In [[Eleasis]] of [[1373 DR]], she provided immediate life-saving aid to her son Roderio after his accidental maiming by Keph.

That same month, she participated in her family's unsuccessful study of ''[[The Leaves of One Night]]''.
