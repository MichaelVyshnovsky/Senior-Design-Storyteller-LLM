        "mainbody": "Korin Ironnugget was an industrious dwarven blacksmith who lived in the secluded village of Snowmantle during the 14 century DR. In addition to his skills as a weapon- and armor-smith, he was capable at shoeing horses and completing basic repairs on wagons and carts.\nSomewhat cautious in nature, Korin was often dour given the circumstances of his new home.\nHoping to leave the Zhentarim influence of the Moonsea region, Korin moved to the peaceful hamlet of Snowmantle. In an effort to avoid being put into slavery, Korin offered his services to the Zhent forces and their leader Ragnoth.\nWhenever possible, he snuck food and water to the slaves within the Zhent camps, though refused to arm them with weapons as he wisely knew it would likely end in their shared deaths."
