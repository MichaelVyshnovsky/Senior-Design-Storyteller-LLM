        "mainbody": "'''Korin Ironnugget''' was an industrious [[dwarven]] blacksmith who lived in the secluded village of [[Snowmantle]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. In addition to his skills as a weapon- and armor-smith, he was capable at [[horseshoe|shoeing]] [[horse]]s and completing basic repairs on wagons and carts.",
        "Personality": "Somewhat cautious in nature, Korin was often dour given the circumstances of his new home.",
        "History": "Hoping to leave the [[Zhentarim]] influence of the [[Moonsea]] region, Korin moved to the peaceful hamlet of Snowmantle. In an effort to avoid being put into slavery, Korin offered his services to the [[Zhent]] forces and their leader [[Ragnoth]].\n\nWhenever possible, he snuck food and water to the slaves within the Zhent camps, though refused to arm them with [[weapon]]s as he wisely knew it would likely end in their shared deaths."
