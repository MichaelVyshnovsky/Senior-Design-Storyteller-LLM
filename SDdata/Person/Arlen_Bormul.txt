'''Arlen Bormul''' was a member of the [[Bormul]] family in the late 13{{th}} and early 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who contributed to the collapse of the kingdom of [[Amn]] and directly caused the extinction of the [[Parhek]] dynasty.

==History==
Following the collapse of Amn following the assassination of King [[Dhanar Parhek]] in the {{YearlinkName|1276}}, Arlen took part in the intrigues and conspiracies that sought to take advantage of the chaos. His agents located a branch of the Parhek dynasty in [[Silverymoon]], and sent assassins to take care of them in the {{YearlinkName|1297}}. The heirs [[Choris Steelsar|Choris]] and [[Rosa Steelsar|Rosa]] were killed while Prince [[Rasa Parhek|Rasa]] and [[Rhothar Parhek|Rhothar]] escaped, but [[Rohav Steelsar|Rohav]] was captured and the eight-year-old was sent to [[Baldur's Gate]] for safekeeping, and was brainwashed to believe that the assassins had actually rescued him. Rohav proved useful in tracking down his uncle Prince [[Malek Parhek (prince)|Malek the Coinmage]], and, in the {{YearlinkName|1305}}, Malek and his children [[Rhinn Parhek|Rhinn]], [[Savra Parhek|Savra]], and [[Parav Parhek|Parav]] were all killed. Rohav outlived his usefulness, and Arlen poisoned him to death in [[1306 DR]], putting an end to the Parhek family.
