        "mainbody": "Deleira Truesilver was a noble from Suzail and a lady of the Truesilver noble house of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR. She was also a cat burglar and slayer under cover of night, using the alias of Talane.\nShe was lean and lithe. When dealing as Talane, she wore black leathers covering her from head to toe, leaving only eyes and mouth visible.\nWhen without her mask, she had flashing yellow eyes and white hair, looking quite good for her matronly age.\nThe woman was extremely nimble, moving across walls and ceilings in preternatural ways.\nOf note, she wielded a sword that seemed to drink away light and quietly emanated something ineffable, but sickening. Her Talane outfit was criscrossed by leather belts scabbarded with nine or more daggers, all of them excellently balanced for throwing. The heel of her boot held an empty space for keys.\nThe hat she wore to the Council of the Dragon was magnificent she traveled in an open carriage there. The room to which she kept in the evenings had a window open to breezes she carried a dagger and pendant of some import, almost certainly magical, there. A balcony on her home had a griffon carved on its east end directly underneath were her gardens and a patch of soft moss.\nShe had maids at home. She found fault with her family and servants constantly.\nAs Talane, she was a burglar and slayer.\nThe vampire archmage Manshoon summoned her to a meeting through a mind-controlled intermediary, Lothrae at some point in Mirtul 26 or earlier that month of the . There, he made a working proposition to her that if she investigated the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar for him and aided in the vampires scheme to acquire blueflame items, he would richly reward her instead of revealing her activities. He also threatened her with his full fury if she were to expose him to the Crown.\nNot long prior to the Council of the Dragon, shed slain at least one Sembian merchant by throwing a dagger into his eye.\nManshoon continued to make references to Talanes role afterwards she ultimately appeared at the coinlass and thief Amarune Whitewaves lodgings, sliding her blade under the window, while Amarune spoke with Ruthgul, her mentor in thieving Ruthgul was at the moment asking Amarune to fake some documents, and panicked at the sound of Talanes voice, revealing shed hired him for it. After Ruthgul snuck out, Amarune received her Talane revealed she knew of Amarunes origins, and attempted to impress her into becoming a \"dirtyhands\", a henchman, lest she reveal to the War Wizards that she was the daughter of Beltar Whitewave she claimed shed return four nights hence.\nLater, Manshoon resolved to use Talane to slay Gaskur, a trusted servant of his patsy, the Lord Marlin Stormserpent, in a bid to better manipulate him. Talane slew Gaskur near Amarunes home, signing her work as Talane.\nLady Deleira Truesilver participated in the Council of the Dragon. He sent her orders to find Amarune, and slay her after verifying whose body was Elminsters, through a mind-controlled, minuscule beholderkin. She suited up in response.\nShe was later targetted by Targrael. Though Talane seemed to have little effect, she actually served as Manshoons host when the beholder he was directly puppeteering was destroyed, possibly being the means by which he saved himself. After the evening, she communicated with Manshoon through a drover in the back of Immaero Sraunters shop. The death kight followed her home, and there, delivered upon her a kiss, with a special enchanted gem in her mouth, whose mind magic allowed Targrael to invade Talanes it was Targraels expectation that the gem, sourced from Queen Alendues cache, captured minds, and she said Talanes death was easily achieved.\nTheir first meeting had Amarune horrified and on edge for long enough that she almost killed Arclath Delcastle the next time she saw him. Strangely, Talane didnt turn up at Amarunes home four nights since their first meeting, like shed promised. During her meet with Elminster, Amarune was told the truth of Talane. Marlin Stormserpent, too, was questioned about Talane by the Purple Dragons, after his servant Gaskur was found dead. Amarune remained disturbed for a while by Talanes impression.\nAt the time of the Council of the Dragon, word on the street was that shed been bedridden for some time."
