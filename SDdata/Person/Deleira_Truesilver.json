        "mainbody": "'''Deleira Truesilver''' was a noble from [[Suzail]] and a lady of the [[Truesilver]] noble house of [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was also a cat burglar and slayer under cover of night, using the alias of '''Talane'''.",
        "Appearance": "She was lean and lithe. When dealing as Talane, she wore black leathers covering her from head to toe, leaving only eyes and mouth visible.\n\nWhen without her mask, she had flashing yellow eyes and white hair, looking quite good for her matronly age.",
        "Abilities": "The woman was extremely nimble, moving across walls and ceilings in preternatural ways.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|288|27}}",
        "Posessions": "Of note, she wielded a sword that seemed to drink away light and quietly emanated something ineffable, but sickening. Her Talane outfit was criscrossed by leather belts scabbarded with nine or more daggers, all of them excellently balanced for throwing. The heel of her boot held an empty space for keys.\n\nThe hat she wore to the [[Council of the Dragon]] was magnificent; she traveled in an open carriage there.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|80|9}} The room to which she kept in the evenings had a window open to breezes; she carried a [[dagger]] and pendant of some import, almost certainly magical, there. A balcony on her home had a griffon carved on its east end; directly underneath were her gardens and a patch of soft moss.",
        "Relationships": "She had maids at home. She found fault with her family and servants constantly.",
        "Activities": "As Talane, she was a burglar and slayer.",
        "History": "The [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]] summoned her to a meeting through a mind-controlled intermediary, [[Lothrae]] at some point in [[Mirtul 26]] or earlier that month of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}. There, he made a working proposition to her: that if she investigated the fugitive [[wizard]] [[Elminster Aumar]] for him and aided in the vampire's scheme to acquire ''[[blueflame item]]s'', he would richly reward her instead of revealing her activities. He also threatened her with his full fury if she were to expose him to the Crown.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|46-51|4}}\n\nNot long prior to the Council of the Dragon, she'd slain at least one [[Sembian]] merchant by throwing a dagger into his eye.\n\nManshoon continued to make references to Talane's role afterwards;{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|95-96|9}}{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|130|12}} she ultimately appeared at the [[coinlass]] and thief [[Amarune Whitewave]]'s lodgings, sliding her blade under the window, while Amarune spoke with [[Ruthgul]], her mentor in thieving; Ruthgul was at the moment asking Amarune to fake some documents, and panicked at the sound of Talane's voice, revealing she'd hired him for it. After Ruthgul snuck out, Amarune received her; Talane revealed she knew of Amarune's origins, and attempted to impress her into becoming a \"dirtyhands\", a henchman, lest she reveal to the [[War Wizards]] that she was the daughter of [[Beltar Whitewave]]; she claimed she'd return four nights hence.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|138-140|13}}\n\nLater, Manshoon resolved to use Talane to slay [[Gaskur]], a trusted servant of his patsy, the Lord [[Marlin Stormserpent]], in a bid to better manipulate him.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|271-272|26}} Talane slew Gaskur near Amarune's home, signing her work as Talane.\n\nLady Deleira Truesilver participated in the [[Council of the Dragon]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|144|15}} He sent her orders to find Amarune, and slay her after verifying whose body was Elminster's, through a mind-controlled, minuscule [[beholderkin]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|163-164|17}} She suited up in response.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|167-168|17}}\n\nShe was later targetted by [[Targrael]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|227|24}} Though Talane seemed to have little effect, she actually served as Manshoon's host when the beholder he was directly puppeteering was destroyed, possibly being the means by which he saved himself.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|233-234|25}} After the evening, she communicated with Manshoon through a drover in the back of [[Immaero Sraunter]]'s shop.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|246|26}} The death kight followed her home, and there, delivered upon her a kiss, with a special ''enchanted'' gem in her mouth, whose mind magic allowed Targrael to invade Talane's; it was Targrael's expectation that the gem, sourced from Queen [[Alendue]]'s cache, captured minds, and she said Talane's death was easily achieved.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|263|28}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Their first meeting had Amarune horrified and on edge for long enough that she almost killed [[Arclath Delcastle]] the next time she saw him.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|175-176|17}} Strangely, Talane didn't turn up at Amarune's home four nights since their first meeting, like she'd promised.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|292-293|28}} During her meet with Elminster, Amarune was told the truth of Talane.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|302|29}} Marlin Stormserpent, too, was questioned about Talane by the [[Purple Dragons]], after his servant Gaskur was found dead.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|304-305|29}} Amarune remained disturbed for a while by Talane's impression.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|310|30}}{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|62|7}}{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|272|29}}\n\nAt the time of the Council of the Dragon, word on the street was that she'd been bedridden for some time.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|80|9}}"
