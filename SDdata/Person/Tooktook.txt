Tooktook was a duergar living in Mithral Hall during the reign of Haerinvureem.
While Mithral Hall was controlled by Clan Bukbukken, Tooktook was from Clan Trilk.
After the death of the shadow dragon, Tooktook was killed by Bruenor Battlehammer in the outer tunnels. Later, Bruenor used Tooktooks name to deceive two gray dwarves from Clan McUduck.
