Eeyal was a female tortle guide who operated out of Fort Beluarian in Chult in the 15 century DR.
By the age of 17, Eeyal had traveled from the Snout of Omgar to Fort Beluarian on foot over the course of a year, had seen Lake Luo, the garden palace of Nangalore, the gorge of Ataaz Muhahah, and even the ruins of Mezro. She had even seen the wreckage of The Narwhal and had befriended the weretiger that lived there.
Eeyal was seen as careful and wise, and quite cautious, constantly checking for traps when traveling in wilderness. She also had a healthy respect for the Flaming Fist, and would recommend that people who employed her as a guide should acquire the necessary paperwork for exploring the jungle. She also disliked underground areas like most tortles, and utilized a pair of self-crafted goggles to shield her eyes from volcanic ash.
