Rylveth abandoned the Lolthite faith in favor of the Absolute. She was stationed within the Moonrise Towers, a fortress controlled by the Absolutes warlord, General Ketheric Thorm. She stood guard at the Towers stairs to the second floor, all while maintaining peace and discouraging infighting. Like many other members of the cult, Zealot Rylveths fate remained unknown as she couldve perished in battle when the High Harper of Baldurs Gate Jaheira and her True Soul allies stormed the Moonrise Towers."
