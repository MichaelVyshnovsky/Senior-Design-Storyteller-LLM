        "Description": "Rylveth wore the uniform [[armor]] of a Zealot of the Absolute: a fur-cloaked night-blue armored garb and a metal [[helmet]]. She had a lighter skin tone, and her eyes had a lavender color.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Rylveth was among those who joined the new religion that sprang up in the [[Western Heartlands]]. Rylveth abandoned the [[Lolthite]] faith in favor of the Absolute. She was stationed within the Moonrise Towers, a fortress controlled by the Absolute's warlord, General [[Ketheric Thorm]]. She stood guard at the Towers' stairs to the second floor, all while maintaining peace and discouraging infighting. Like many other members of the cult, Zealot Rylveth's fate remained unknown as she could've perished in battle when the [[High Harper]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] [[Jaheira]] and her [[True Soul]] allies stormed the Moonrise Towers."
