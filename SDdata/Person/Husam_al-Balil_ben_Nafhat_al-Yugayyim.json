        "mainbody": "Great Caliph Husam al-Balil ben Nafhat al-Yugayyim was the brilliant but flighty ruler of the djinn.\nThe Great Caliph spent most of his time in the center of his fortress, the Citadel of Ice and Steel, ruling upon legal, political, and strategic issues of the djinn. Whenever he decided to tour the Elemental Plane of Air, he made it a procession in grand style.\nThough Husam al-Balil did not leave his court often, When the monarch traveled to the Prime Material Plane, his splendor was always announced by a great gust of wind. Legend ascribed to him power akin to that of the gods."
