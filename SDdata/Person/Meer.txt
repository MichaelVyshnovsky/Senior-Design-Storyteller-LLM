Meer was the head of caravans within the Zhentarim, during the midâ€“14 century DR, both before and after the rise to power of Fzoul Chembryl. Several individual caravan masters, along with some particular merchants, worked directly under Meer.
For a period, Meer was in possession of the magical scimitar Shazzellim, which was presented to him by his subordinate Lhemako.
