Green Spirit was a Nubari hunter and ranger that hailed from the Koshiva tribe of the Malatran Plateau, active in the late 14 century DR.
Green Spirit was an overly-confident and boastful young man.
In the late 14 century DR, the Tribe of the Wise Ones became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded spider katanga, the Mother of a Thousand Young was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Green Spirit was among the younger and less experienced heroes of the Living Jungle who answered the call, along with Temenu Farseer of the Wise Ones, cainian katanga Roq Silent Hunter, tamhi Allanna, and butu Tanu. Green Spirits group was sent to enter the spider katanga caverns and faced hunting spider katangas who guarded previously captured adventurers.
It was unknown if Green Spirit survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the Village of the Wise Ones for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and natures healing.
