'''Irvag the Bear''' was one of the innkeepers of the [[Wildlands Rest]], a wayside inn in the [[Silver Marches]].

==Relationships==
Irvag's adventuring and business partner was the [[dwarf]] [[Grumbelham Goldhand]]. Both were enterprising souls.

==History==
In [[1371 DR]], the two old adventurers built and founded the Wildlands Rest. Despite their age, they were able to repel multiple [[orc]] attacks on their business. They continually expanded the location, adding additions to the building and upgrading furnishings.
