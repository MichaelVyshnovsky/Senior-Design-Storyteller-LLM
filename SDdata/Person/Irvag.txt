Adventurer
Irvag the Bear was one of the innkeepers of the Wildlands Rest, a wayside inn in the Silver Marches.
Irvags adventuring and business partner was the dwarf Grumbelham Goldhand. Both were enterprising souls.
In 1371 DR, the two old adventurers built and founded the Wildlands Rest. Despite their age, they were able to repel multiple orc attacks on their business. They continually expanded the location, adding additions to the building and upgrading furnishings.
