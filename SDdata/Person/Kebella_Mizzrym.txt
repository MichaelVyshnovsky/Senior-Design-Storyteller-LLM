Kebella Mizzrym was a drow agent of House Mizzrym who infiltrated the city of Zhentil Keep during the lateâ€“14 century DR.
Kebella operated out of Sunset House within southern Zhentil Keep in the eastern section of the Foreign Quarter. Though the drows presence in Zhentil Keep was a secret, she planned to insinuate herself into the inner circle of the city in order to use Zhentil Keep as a launching point for attacks on elves to the south and to control the Moonsea coastline.
Her consort, who was also with her in Zhentil Keep, was Taybar Rozziss.
