'''Kebella Mizzrym''' was a [[drow]] agent of [[House Mizzrym]] who infiltrated the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the lateâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Kebella operated out of [[Sunset House]] within southern Zhentil Keep in the eastern section of the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]]. Though the drow's presence in Zhentil Keep was a secret, she planned to insinuate herself into the inner circle of the city in order to use Zhentil Keep as a launching point for attacks on [[elves]] to the south and to control the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]] coastline.

==Relationships==
Her consort, who was also with her in Zhentil Keep, was [[Taybar Rozziss]].
