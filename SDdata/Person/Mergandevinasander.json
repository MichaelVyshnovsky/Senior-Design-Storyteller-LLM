        "History": "Mergandevinasander was hatched in [[659 DR]] in [[Zakhara]]. While still a [[wyrmling]], he was cast out from his mother's lair. He wandered the south for decades before he settled in the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. There he terrorized the inhabitants for hundreds of miles around him.\n\nAfter reading of Mergandevinasander in a book of dragon lore, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] used the color of Mergandevinasander's eyes to briefly fool [[Velcuthimmorhar|Hephaestus]] into believing that Drizzt was Mergandevinasander trapped in [[drow]] form, thanks to the drow's own violet eyes.\n\nMergandevinasander was alive as of [[1374 DR]]."
