'''Duke Pryden Daggerford''' was the head–of–state of [[Daggerford]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Like the other dukes of Daggerford, Pryden wielded the duchy's sword of state, ''[[Lawflame]]''.

==Relationships==
Duke Pryden had three children: his eldest son [[Merovy Daggerford|Merovy]], a younger son [[Pwyll Daggerford|Pwyll]], and a daughter named [[Bronwyn Daggerford|Bronwyn]].

The duke had a half-brother [[Llewellyn Longhand|Sir Llewellyn Longhand]], who served as his Master–at–Arms. He appointed [[Kelson Darktreader]] as his Master of the Hunt.

==History==
Following the death of the duke's son Merovy, Pryden recalled his son Pwyll from his adventuring life. He began to prepare Pwyll for the position of rulership.

The duke himself died during the [[First Dragonspear War]] and Pwyll ascended as the leader of Daggerford.[[The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier]] states that [[Pryden Daggerford|Duke Pryden]] died while fighting the "forces of Dragonspear Castle". This is believed occur during the [[First Dragonspear War]] as Pwyll is already duke at the beginning of the [[Second Dragonspear War]], according to [[Hordes of Dragonspear]].
