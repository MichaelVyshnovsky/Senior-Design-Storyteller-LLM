Despite being viewed as traitors, the allied Dhuurniv–NVaelahr troops fought very well against the Army of Darkness.\nHowever, in Midwinter–Alturiak 1 of 713 DR, Aolis fell alongside Matron Mother Laele Dhuurniv, and the Spider Truce was ended. In that battle, Laele killed Aolis from behind but afterward was quickly killed by Amara Ildacer.\nOnly Aolis and his wife knew the identities of the Councilors that supported the NVaelahr.\nAolis gave to all his agents a kiira NVaelahr that bound the agent to Aolis and permitted telepathic communication to Aolis or Amara."
