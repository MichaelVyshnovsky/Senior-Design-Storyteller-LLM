'''Ifan Talro'a''' ({{Pronounce|EE|fawn|_|tal|ROH|ah|refs=}}) was one of the [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant princes]] of [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He held a monopoly over the sale of live [[beast]]s within the city.

==Description==
He was a [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] [[noble]]man who carried a heavy [[staff]] that he could bang on the ground for emphasis.

==Personality==
He was known for being exceptionally avaricious in his dealings. He was prone to arrogance, jealousy, distrust, and scheming.

==Activities==
Ifan Talro'a dealt in all manner of domesticated and near-wild animals native to [[Chult]], from adorable pets and companions to beasts of burden and [[mount]]s. Anyone wishing to buy or sell such a creature, or to have such creatures trained, had to go through him or his sellers.Although Ifan Talro'a controlled the sale of mounts and beasts of burden, the sale of riding tack such as [[saddle]]s was controlled by a different merchant prince, [[Ekene-Afa]]. Among the creatures that Ifan sold were [[flying monkey]]s, [[giant lizard]]s, and even [[dinosaur]]s (most notably [[ankylosaurus]], [[deinonychus]], [[hadrosaurus]], and [[triceratops]]). He also sold [[flying snake]]s, but only to his allies. As he held a monopoly on the beast trade, there were no other legal means to sell such animals.

His dozens of beast merchants and handlers throughout Port Nyanzaru also acted as his spies, allowing his eyes and ears to infest every marketplace in the city. As part of his monopoly, he implicitly controlled the [[dinosaur pens]] in Port Nyanzaru's [[Tiryki Anchorage]].

As a merchant prince, Ifan Talro'a participated in their council that governed Port Nyanzaru from the palace of [[Goldenthrone]]. He was known to have forced [[adventurer]]s to prove themselves in single combat against a dinosaur right in the middle of the palace.

==Possessions==
Ifan Talro'a maintained a palatial and opulent villa in Port Nyanzaru, which also served as a secure fortress for him and his business. The villa and gardens were home to colorful flying snakes and were decorated with Chultan relics and [[vase]]s taken from tombs within the jungle. Ifan was a collector of such ancient Chultan relics, and desired to acquire more treasures (such as the [[Skull Chalice of Ch'gakare]]). He was not above marking someone for death if they refused to give him something he wanted for this collection.

Ifan also maintained a secret office in a bunker beneath the dinosaur pens in Tiryki Anchorage. From here, he personally handled communications with his less savory allies in the jungle. He protected such secrets with summoned [[shadow]]s and [[shadow demon]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|42}}

==Relationships==
He was considered an ally of the [[Zhentarim]] and surrounded himself with dangerous and influential agents from the mercenary organization. They collaborated in many of his schemes.

He also acted as a spy of sorts for the [[yuan-ti]] of [[Omu]], although he maintained plausible deniability by never confirming exactly with whom he was working. He used his flying snakes to give them warning of any approaching interlopers searching for Chultan treasure. Because of this arrangement, the [[Emerald Enclave]] came to suspect Ifan of luring unsuspecting travelers to their deaths in the jungle. One of their agents, [[Screaming Wind]], sought to expose him as a traitor to Port Nyanzaru.

As he was generally distrusting of everyone he met, Ifan had no true friends, family or meaningful relationships. He was jealous of fellow merchant princes [[Ekene-Afa]] for her fame and [[Wakanga O'tamu]] for his [[arcane]] power.

Like the other merchant princes, the [[Ytepka Society]] supported him as part of their mission to ensure stability in Port Nyanzaru, although he was also willing to use them to pursue his more selfish goals.

==History==

}}
As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Ifan Talro'a was one of the wealthiest individuals in Port Nyanzaru.

When Port Nyanzaru became overrun with the [[fiend]]ish forces of the pirate captain [[Idrianne Smoke]], Ifan Talro'a devised a plan to unleash the many dinosaurs locked up in the the city's dinosaur pens to let them rampage through the enemy forces. He was delighted to be the only person with the power to authorize such a plan.
