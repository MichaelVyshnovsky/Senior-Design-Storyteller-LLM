        "mainbody": "'''Vellynne Harpell''' ({{Pronounce|vuh|LIN|har|PELL|refs=}}) was a [[necromancer]] and an agent of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] that lived in the [[Ten Towns]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|It's a weak wizard who relies on spells alone|One of Vellynne's favored sayings.}}",
        "Description": "Throughout her entire life, Vellynne suffered from a disorder to her nervous system that caused trembling throughout her body, affecting her gait and sense of balance. Through her efforts she has not let the condition affect her spellcasting abilities.",
        "Personality": "Those that met Vellynne referred to her as callous and aloof to other. Her unsentimental demeanor was a result of her adherence to logical thinking and great ambition she possessed. She was not secretive about her goals and openly shared them with those who may be of some assistance to her.",
        "Abilities": "Vellynne was capable of casting [[arcane]] spells up to the 4{{th}} level.",
        "Possessions": "Perhaps most notable of Vellynne's possessions was a ''[[professor orb]]'' she referred to as [[Professor Skant]]. The old [[Harpell]] family heirloom was stolen from her by an associate of the Brotherhood named [[Nass Lantomir]]. She was fond of using magical items to supplement her spellcasting powers; as she wore a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]'' and kept a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]'' on her person.\n\nVellynne's [[spellbook]] was bound in black leather and its cover was imprinted with the sigil of the school of necromancy.",
        "Relationships": "Vellynne was born into the illustrious [[Harpell]] family of [[Longsaddle]] that was famous among the people of [[the North]].\n\nShe maintained a rivalry with a fellow wizard of the Arcane Brotherhood, a [[tiefling]] woman named [[Avarice]]. While the two sought the same goals in their careers they refused to work with one another and even acted in detriment to the other's actions.\n\nShe was served by a cadre of six [[Icewind kobold]] minions that carried out her bidding, two of which have died and since been raised as [[zombie]]s, along with a [[owl|snow owl]] [[familiar]].",
        "History": "Vellynne began her studies of [[arcane magic]] rather late in life, some time during the 1470s [[DR]]. She joined the Arcane Brotherhood some time in the next decade, at least partially as a result of her famous family name.\n\nAfter the location of the lost city of [[Ythryn]] was [[divine]]d by wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood, during or around the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, Vellynne began a journey to the isle of [[Solstice]] in search of the ''[[Codicil of White]]'', a tome sacred to the followers of [[Auril]]. She acted in direct competition to her rival Avarice."
