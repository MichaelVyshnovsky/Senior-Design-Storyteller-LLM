        "mainbody": "'''Azreena Ironoath''' was a [[human]] [[priest]] of [[Torm]] who oversaw the [[House of Duty]] in [[Halfhap]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "By [[1369 DR]], Azreena was quite old, but was still physically fit and mentally sharp.",
        "Personality": "Azreena was extraordinarily level-headed, brave, and dutiful, as befitting a priest of Torm. Her judgment was so sound and her reputation so storied that she was the most beloved and respected person in Halfhap.",
        "History": "Around the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, she responded to a midnight raid by [[ogre]]s while wearing nothing but her nightgown and ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'', and wielding a ''+3 [[hammer]]''. She held a section of wall by herself for hours until the ogres were driven off, almost dying of pneumonia from her exposure to the freezing night air. Afterwards, she refused all accolades and rewards, saying she was just \"doing my duty\"."
