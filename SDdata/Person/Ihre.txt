'''Ihre''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] and [[cleric]] who lived in [[Karsus Enclave]] before {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==History==
Ihre came to the aid of his [[adventurer]] friend [[Yousouf]] when he was cleaved by an [[ogre]], mauled by a [[mountain lion]], and [[Frostbite (condition)|frostbitten]] by the cold. Ihre managed to keep him alive and restore his health, but most of Yousouf's toes had to be removed before they became [[gangrene|gangrenous]].
