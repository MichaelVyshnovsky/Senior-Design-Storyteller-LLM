Alpharra Anabravvur was a famed luxury shipwright from the opulent merchant city of Selgaunt in Sembia, in the 1490s DR.
In her mid-thirties, Alpharra was a good-looking albino woman who was blessed with sharp intellect, a cold calculating personality, wealth, and status.
By the late 15 century DR, Alpharra was the third-generation businesswoman who ran Anabravvurs shipbuilding workshop in Selgaunt. Her vessels were some of the largest and most luxurious ships on the Sea of Fallen Stars.
