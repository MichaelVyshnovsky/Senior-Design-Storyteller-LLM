        "mainbody": "Astalagan was a bronze dragon who was mentioned in the legends about Stormwreck Isle.\nAstalagan was one of the three great metallic dragons who defeated the great red dragon Sharruth long before the late 1400s DR. Legends say that he, the gold dragon Clyssavar, and the brass dragon Turadaer joined forces to battle Sharruth and confined her beneath the ocean floor.\nIt is unknown how exactly Astalagan died, but it was centuries prior to the late 1400s DR. A cloister called Dragons Rest was built on the site of his death in the cliffs of Stormwreck Isle and it was protected by the remaining draconic magic. In the late 15 century, Dragons Rests elder was Runara, a bronze dragon disguised in human form and Astalagans daughter.\nIn the , a blue dragon wyrmling named Sparkrender had taken up residence in the Clifftop Observatory on Stormwreck Isle and attempted to harness the power of the islands fallen dragons. For this cause, he ordered his kobold followers Mek and Minn to build and paint sculptures of the five great dragons, Astalagan among them. When a group of adventurers and a bronze wyrmling named Aidron attempted to stop Sparkrenders ritual, the effigy of Astalagan gave them Astalagans Blessing, restoring their health and surrounding them with warmth."
