'''Brenvol Whitebrow''' was a [[werewolf]] [[ranger]] of [[Selûne]] and a member of the [[Fangshields]] who served as their liaison to the [[lycanthropes]] of [[Faerûn]]. He believed that his family, the [[White Pack]] served as an example to the evil shapechangers of [[Toril]], proof that faith in the ''Lady of Silver'' could keep anyone on the path of good and righteousness.

==Description==
Brenvol was a skilled hunter, tracker and fairly good cook who always preferred to have company while enjoying a campsite meal.

===Appearance===
The young werewolf had a pointed nose, red cheeks and graying hair (in his human form), that was fully white in some spots, a trait common among his pack members. He had a long and lean frame, similar to that of a [[wolf]].

===Personality===
He was a friendly and outgoing man who was popular among the Fangshields, and had many among the group who would readily rush to his aid. His good nature made him the perfect contact person for new recruits within the Fangshields.

==Relationships==
Brenvol's mother was [[Brena Whitebrow]], the alpha female of the White Pack [[Selûne]]ite lycanthropes. His mother imparted upon him the seriousness and responsibilities of being a leader, preparing him to take over the pack after her.

==Possessions==
Among Brenvol's possessions were a ''+1 suit of [[studded leather]] [[armor]]'', a quality [[heavy mace]], [[shortbow]] and a ''[[elemental gem]]''. He often kept his quiver full of [[silver arrow]]s and decorated his clothes with custom [[silver]] coins imprinted with the [[holy symbol]] of Selûne.
