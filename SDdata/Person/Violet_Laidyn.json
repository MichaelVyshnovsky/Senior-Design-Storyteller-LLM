        "History": "Violet was known to be a virtuoso artificer of dispassionate demeanor. However, it did not preclude Violet from being naturally gifted in the art of artifice due to her uncanny talent to swiftly grasp the workings of complex arcane geometries. Violet made a living in Neverwinter by offering her talents to adventurers and defenders of the city."
