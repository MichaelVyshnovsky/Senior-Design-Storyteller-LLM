Rielev was trapped in a torturous existence within a glass chamber sometime before the  and kept in Jon Irenicuss Dungeon and laboratory deep underneath the city of Athkatla in Amn. Once, Rielev was a loyal servant to Jon Irenicus. The poor wretchs existence was clouded in oblivion and ambiguity, stuck between life and death. According to their clouded memory, Irenicus was a friend and of the same people as the tortured experiment. Rielev was promised eternal life and youth in reward for their service until then, Irenicus suspended them in a glass chamber, eventually forgetting or not caring for Rielevs fate. They asked for death and freedom from unending torture. The unfortunate souls life was fueled by an energy source. Rielev asked Abdel Adrian, who recently escaped Irenicuss clutches, to remove the batteries, thus ending their existence.
