'''Rowaan Vrinn''' was the [[drow]] high priestess of [[Eilistraee]] in the [[Misty Forest]] in [[1375 DR]].

==History==
Daughter of [[Leliana Vrinn]], Rowaan was chosen to be the high priestess of the Misty Forest. There, she met [[Halisstra Melarn]] during the [[Silence of Lolth]].

In 1375 DR, Rowaan also met Halisstra's brother, [[Q'arlynd Melarn]], who'd followed a clue from [[Ched Nasad]].
Rowaan was killed during an attack by a large group of [[drider]]s but quickly resurrected by [[Chezzara]].

Rowaan was again killed later by a Nightshadow of [[Vhaeraun]] and her soul was stolen.

At last, after Eilistraee prevailed upon Vhaeraun, Rowaan was correctly resurrected
