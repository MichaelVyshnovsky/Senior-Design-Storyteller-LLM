Rowaan Vrinn was the drow high priestess of Eilistraee in the Misty Forest in 1375 DR.
Daughter of Leliana Vrinn, Rowaan was chosen to be the high priestess of the Misty Forest. There, she met Halisstra Melarn during the Silence of Lolth.
In 1375 DR, Rowaan also met Halisstras brother, Qarlynd Melarn, whod followed a clue from Ched Nasad.
Rowaan was killed during an attack by a large group of driders but quickly resurrected by Chezzara.
Rowaan was again killed later by a Nightshadow of Vhaeraun and her soul was stolen.
At last, after Eilistraee prevailed upon Vhaeraun, Rowaan was correctly resurrected
