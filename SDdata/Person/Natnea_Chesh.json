        "mainbody": "'''Natnea Chesh''' was a priestess of [[Kelemvor]] who defeated an army of the [[undead]] led by a [[necromancer]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "Natnea Chesh was one of the first [[cleric]]s of Kelemvor in the [[Moonshae Isles]] following his apotheosis in [[1368 DR]]. As a part of her calling, she took on a power-hungry necromancer who was amassing an army of the undead. This victory earned her the title \"The Defender of the Dead and attracted attention of her deity. Kelemvor gifted her with a ''[[periapt of health]]'' and the knowledge of how to create more. She shared the ''periapts'' with fellow clerics who sought to destroy the undead.\n\nEventually, some of the amulets created by Natnea ended up in the pockets of thieves and rogues who valued the ''periapts'' for the protection from poisons they granted."
