Gorsshhh was a steam mephit bard who lived with the steam mephit sorcerer Voosss in a statue called the Steaming Demon. 
Gorsshhh and Voosss had stolen some treasure from travelers. They stored it in a chamber hidden inside of the Steaming Demon. 
Gorsshhh and Voosss manipulated the steam vent that the Steaming Demon was built around in order to produce steam on command. Every nine hours, the statue would appear be a steam-breathing demon. They used this fearful sight to scare travelers and rob them, choosing their targets carefully.
