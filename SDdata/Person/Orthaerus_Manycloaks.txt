Orthaerus Manycloaks was a wizard who lived in the Wildwoods mansion near Waymoot in 1367 DR.
Orthaerus was slain during a spell-duel by the wizard Endarthar.
As a ghost who retained full spellcasting abilities, Orthaerus tormented Endarthar relentlessly. Any visitors to Wildwoods who showed hostility toward Endarthar were aided by Orthaerus.
