        "mainbody": "Endelyn Moongrave, () also known as Creeping Lyn and Bitter End, was the youngest of the three hags of the Hourglass Coven. She made her lair in the alpine theater Motherhorn, in the splinter-realm of Yon in the Feywild domain of Prismeer.\nHer decrepit body was hidden behind an macabre dress that doubled as an intricate theatre for mechanically-controlled puppets. \nEndelyn was wholly obsessed with all related to tragedy and despair. She believed that each individual had their role to play in the grand, hopeless theater of existence. The best someone could hope for was to fulfill their role with a decent enough performance to offer her some middling interest.\nEndelyn was immortal in the sense that she could not die of old age. She could only be killed during the time of a full solar eclipse, or grand facsimile thereof, a fact she came to understand during a prophecy she received.\nShe carried with her a pair of magical scissors that could separate any humanoid creature from their shadow, the latter of which then became beholden to the evil hag.\nHer preferred means of conveyance was the ornithopter of flying.\nEndelyns most prized possessions was the Orrery of Tragedies,\nEach day, performances would be held in the grand amphitheater at Motherhorn, solely for Endelyns amusement. She would judge them according to her liking, and allow adept performers to bargain for a glimpse into their future.\nWhenever petitioners appeared before her to learn an aspect of their fate, Endelyn offered them twisted pageants―she referred to as \"auguries\"—which involved hideous puppets that stole away part of an individuals free will. These thefts could not be reversed, even after an individual learned of their untimely fate. \nShe was one of four daughters of the archfey Baba Yaga, along with fellow hags Bavlorna Blightstraw, Skabatha Nightshade, and the adopted human from Oerth, Iggwilv. She had a pet cat named Gloam, who she believed was stolen away by Bavlorna.\nEndelyn Moongrave was responsible for turning the warlock Skylla against her fellow members of the League of Malevolence.\nShe kept a number of individuals as \"guests\" at her theater in Motherhorn, from numerous planets across the multiverse and planes beyond the Prime Material plane. Notable among them were the elven prince Alagarthas from Toril, and the Witchlight Carnival acrobat named Glister, She even employed the shadow of Glisters partner Gleam, as her own personal thief.\nWhen their adoptive sister Iggwilv achieved new heights of power and created the domain of Prismeer, Endelyn, Bavlorna, and Skabatha became exceedingly jealous. The three hags feigned support for Iggwilv, gaining her support as trusted advisors at the Palace of Hearts Desire. While Iggwilv was unaware, the trio carried out a plot to sabotage her magic cauldron, keep her in stasis within the palace, and carve Prismeer into three sections Hither, Thither, and Yon, the latter of which Endelyn claimed for herself."
