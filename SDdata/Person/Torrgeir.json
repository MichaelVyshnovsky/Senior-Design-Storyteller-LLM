        "mainbody": "orrgeir was the speaker of the Bruenghor Clan in 1374 DR.\nTorrgeir appeared to step up as the speaker of the clan when their leader, Kolgrim, had not returned.\nThe dwarf was bald and had a stringy brown beard with a single large braid that had several rings attached to it. He wore a brown-blue jerkin with blue bracers.\nAround 1374 DR, the Bruenghor Clan was forced out of their mines by a group of drow. Many of them were slaughtered and poisoned, and the dwarves were forced to collapse all but one of the exit tunnels, and regroup on the surface above. A task force ascended the nearby mountain, known as Burning Eye, to light a signal fire. They hoped that the signal fire would alert their brothers from Easting, so that they could rush to their aid. The heroes Kromlech, Vahn, and Adrianna first met with Torrgeir and was informed about the situation. The three adventurers went in search of the leader, Kolgrim, so that they find out what happened and enter the mines.\nThe heroes were able to light the signal fire, and returned victorious. They had to inform Torrgeir that the dwarves were slain by the white dragon, Ciraxis, and a band of ogres. Torrgeir then gave them permission to enter the mines and clear out the drow."
