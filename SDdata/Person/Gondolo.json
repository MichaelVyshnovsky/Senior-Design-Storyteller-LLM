        "mainbody": "ondolo () was an unsuccessful treasure seeker and the companion of his foppish friend, Faroul. Together, they hired themselves out as guides in Port Nyanzaru during the late 15 century DR.\nGondolo was a lightfoot halfling with a flabby build. He stood at  and weighed .\nGondolo enjoyed carousing and living a life of debauchery and gambling, especially alongside Faroul. He was notably lucky, especially when it came to narrowly escaping danger.\nGondolo was fond of sharing important-sounding facts. While he thought himself to be a philosopher, he often supplanted any actual knowledge with his own fabricated ideas. He further fancied himself as both a poet and a boxer.\nGondolo and Faroul owned a triceratops named Zongo they intended to enter into dinosaur races in Port Nyanzaru. They used it as a pack beast due to its lethargic nature.\nWhen Faroul was sent away to Port Nyanzaru by his parents, Gondolo joined him to help seek their fortunes and live the high life. In a matter of months, the two lavished their money away on gambling and earned significant debts with both the citys dinosaur race bookies as well as its merchant princes.\nAround this time, Gondolo met a feverish explorer desperate for money to pay for a voyage home to Baldurs Gate. This explorer offered to sell him a treasure map and, desperate for cash, Gondolo agreed. The map showed the location of a deceased dragons former lair. As Gondolo and Faroul didnt have the wherewithal to travel there on their own, they posed as jungle guides in the hopes that they could venture to the dragons lair with a group of adventurers and equally split whatever treasure of the hoard remained."
