'''Prince Tannous''' was a member of the royal family of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Tannous was lean from frequent exercise and appeared younger than he really was. He was always armed and preferred wearing somber, plum-hued clothing that he imported from [[Muluk]].

==Personality==
Tannous was a serious and thoughtful man. He realized that power comes from knowledge.

==Possessions==
Tannous possessed a ''[[ring of protection]] +2'', ''[[bracers of defense]] AC 4'', ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'', a ''[[scimitar of speed]] +2'', a ''[[dagger of venom]]'', and ''[[slippers of soft movement]]'' .

==Activities==
Tannous feared that the Grand Caliph would die without leaving a male heir. He constantly invited Khalil to lavish parties, hoping to introduce him to potential wives to add to the Royal Harim.

Tannous supplied Khalil with many of his [[magical item]]s, hoping to curry more favor with the Grand Caliph. He purchased these items from disreputable [[adventurer]]s who smuggled them from [[Afyal]] and the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]].

He employed a team of elite alchemists to discover a formula for longevity potions.

==Relationships==
Tannous was the older brother of Prince [[Cheddah]] and paternal uncle to the [[Grand Caliph]] [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]]. He was the younger brother of the previous Grand Caliph [[Achmed al-Assad]].

He earned Khalil's affection by pandering to his requests during his adventuring days.

==History==
Tannous made an enemy of Grand Vizier [[Alyana al-Azzazi]] long ago when he tried to coerce her to abandon her post by using threats.

Tannous established a spy network in Huzuz, which he later trusted to [[Sa'id Firdawsi]]. Spies working for Sa'id and Tannous used special [[message ring]]s to communicate.

Tannous was a religious man, worshiping [[Haku]] devoutly.
