Prince Tannous was a member of the royal family of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Tannous was lean from frequent exercise and appeared younger than he really was. He was always armed and preferred wearing somber, plum-hued clothing that he imported from Muluk.
Tannous was a serious and thoughtful man. He realized that power comes from knowledge.
Tannous possessed a ring of protection +2, bracers of defense AC 4, gauntlets of ogre power, a scimitar of speed +2, a dagger of venom, and slippers of soft movement .
Tannous feared that the Grand Caliph would die without leaving a male heir. He constantly invited Khalil to lavish parties, hoping to introduce him to potential wives to add to the Royal Harim.
Tannous supplied Khalil with many of his magical items, hoping to curry more favor with the Grand Caliph. He purchased these items from disreputable adventurers who smuggled them from Afyal and the Ruined Kingdoms.
He employed a team of elite alchemists to discover a formula for longevity potions.
Tannous was the older brother of Prince Cheddah and paternal uncle to the Grand Caliph Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir. He was the younger brother of the previous Grand Caliph Achmed al-Assad.
He earned Khalils affection by pandering to his requests during his adventuring days.
Tannous made an enemy of Grand Vizier Alyana al-Azzazi long ago when he tried to coerce her to abandon her post by using threats.
Tannous established a spy network in Huzuz, which he later trusted to Said Firdawsi. Spies working for Said and Tannous used special message rings to communicate.
Tannous was a religious man, worshiping Haku devoutly.
