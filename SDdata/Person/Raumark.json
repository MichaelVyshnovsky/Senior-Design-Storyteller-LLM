Deliberately trying to reduce the influence of fallen Netheril, he learned the language of the locals, rather than speak Netherese. He also prepared his people for a fight with the pursuing phaerimm he expected.\nIn a vision granted to him by Mystra in , Elminster learned that Raumark had been in a hall of white pillars, where he cast and then jumped into a spell-created whorl of disintegration.\nThe library of Raumark was named after him."
