Parker was a human burglar active in Daggerford circa 1372 DR.
Barrow was a shorter female who wore a tight dark leather armor.
Parker was a cold and calm woman who did not fall easily to intimidation nor persuasion. She was more likely to murder anyone who witnessed her illegal activities and do it in a sadistic manner using poison or acid.
Parker performed burglary jobs alongside her lover and partner Barrow.
She carried a vial of spider venom of average strength used to coat her weapon, a trap-making set of blob oof acid, and acid splash, as well as a set of +3 thieves tools. She also owned a copy of the Recipes for Knaves book.
In 1372 DR, Barrow and Parker broke into a wealthy artists cottage in Daggerford. The building was boded up for the season but the front door of it was left callously unlocked by the burglarizing duo who started with the owners wine cellar.
