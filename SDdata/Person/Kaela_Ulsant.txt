Kaela Ulsant was a senior member within the Cult of the Dragon during the late 14 century DR. She was one of the Wearers of Purple who had a seat on the six-person council that led the Cult cell within Wyrmsmoke Keep in the Galena Mountains.
Although the faith was more common within the Mourktar cell of the Cult, Kaela was a worshiper of the Lord of Darkness, Bane.
