Rathnar was a member of the City Guard of Waterdeep in the mid–14th century DR.
One night during the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, in Castle Waterdeep, Lord Piergeiron ordered Rathnar and another member of the guard to take Kyriani into custody, after she fought a spell-battle with the false avatar of Selûne. However, Khelben Arunsun took charge of her, then let her go.
