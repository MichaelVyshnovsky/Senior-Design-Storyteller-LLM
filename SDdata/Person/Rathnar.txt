'''Rathnar''' was a member of the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the mid–14th{{th}} century [[DR]].

One night during the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], in [[Castle Waterdeep]], Lord [[Piergeiron]] ordered Rathnar and another member of the guard to take [[Kyriani]] into custody, after she fought a spell-battle with the [[Shar|false avatar]] of [[Selûne]].
