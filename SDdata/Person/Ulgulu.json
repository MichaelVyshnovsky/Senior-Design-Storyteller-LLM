        "mainbody": "Ulgulu was a barghest whelp from the planes of Gehenna in the midâ€“14 century DR. He was the brother of Kempfana.\nUlgulu was a huge purple-skinned goblin-like creature with glowing orange eyes. He was bigger than his brother Kempfana.\nSent to the Material Plane to eat and grow, Ulgulu and his brother Kempfana made their home in the cave of a hill giant named Lagerbottoms in the Silver Marches, where they could safely mature before returning to their home plane.\nAround 1340 DR, the barghests sent their main force of gnolls to capture the father and eldest son of the Thistledown family, but the raiders never returned. Ulgulu and his brother sent Nathak to scout out what happened, and he returned reporting their raiding party of five gnolls were dead. After that, Ulgulu sent his quickling ally, Tephanis, to discover exactly what had happened. When Tephanis returned, he told them a newly surfaced drow, Drizzt DoUrden, had slain the monsters. In rage, Ulgulu asked the quickling steal one of Drizzts scimitars. After receiving the blade, Ulgulu used his shape-changing abilities to make himself appear as a drow, and attacked the Thistledown farmstead. After slaying the residents, he left the broken scimitar to frame Drizzt as the killer of the family.\nWhen Drizzt learned what had happened, he and Guenhwyvar attacked the caves inhabitants, destroying the two barghests and many of their goblin allies. Ulgulu changed into his monstrous wolf-like form and pursued Guenhwyvar to a cliff, but when he pounced, the panther dissolved into mist, going back to the Astral Plane, and Ulgulu fell over the cliff. Though he tried changing back to a more humanoid shape in order to levitate, he was too slow and died on impact, his body halfway through transformation.\nHis twisted remains were later found by the party investigating the death of the Thistledowns and Drizzts intentions. Dove Falconhand would then come to the correct conclusion that Drizzt battled Ulgulu and Kempfana to avenge the deaths of the Thistledown family."
