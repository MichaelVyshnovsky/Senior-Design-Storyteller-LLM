'''Milikaia''' was a [[vampire]] who slew [[Felina Tatch]], an [[undead]]-hunting [[priestess]], sometime before [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Felina Tatch spent her life freeing the tortured spirits bound to their raised bodies on the [[Prime Material plane]] by dark magics. Eventually, she set herself against Milikaia, a powerful vampire who killed the priestess and raised her as one of the blood-sucking undead and subjugated her will. However, Felina was later seen traveling across graveyards, killing the undead and seemingly free from Milikaia's control. Milikaia's fate remained unknown.
