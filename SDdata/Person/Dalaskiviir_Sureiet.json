        "mainbody": "Dalaskiviir Sureiet, or Dal for short since everyone mispronounced his name, was a young visionary inhabiting Tulmon along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe was slim and graceful and quite the playboy.\nDal dreamed of a Tulmon fully independent from the influences of Calimshan, Suldolphor, and others. He was an up and coming leader among Tulmons younger generation, and many within the city viewed his ideas as dangerous."
