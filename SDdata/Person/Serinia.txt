Serinia was a priestess of Mielikki and a member of the Emerald Enclave in Elventree in the late 15 century DR.
Serinia took care of the Hall of the Unicorn, the local temple to Mielikki.
Circa 1486 DR, she helped Elanil Elassidil to bring peace to the spirit of her ancestor, Meira Faerenduil. At the same time, she was worried about her friend, the treant Brightleaf, who had sent no news for a while.
Serinia was a nervous individual. She did not like the company of other people, preferring to spend time with small animals.
Serinia had good dealings with Elanil Elassidil, the Herald of Elventree.
