'''Alinar Le'Quella''' was the master archer of [[Evermeet]] in [[1367 DR]].
  
==Activities==
Alinar's passion was hunting but in a very unorthodox way: he always used blunt arrows because he liked tracking and locating his targets, not killing them. Alinar was vegetarian. Sometimes Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] sent Alinar on missions to [[Faer√ªn]].

==Personality==
Alinar was a friendly and outgoing individual. However, during missions he showed a cool professional mind and would not let anything and anyone menace Evermeet.

==Possessions==
Alinar wielded one of the [[Baneblades of Demron]], ''[[Dragathil]]''.
