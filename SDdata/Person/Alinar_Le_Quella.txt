Alinar LeQuella was the master archer of Evermeet in 1367 DR.
Alinars passion was hunting but in a very unorthodox way he always used blunt arrows because he liked tracking and locating his targets, not killing them. Alinar was vegetarian. Sometimes Queen Amlaruil Moonflower sent Alinar on missions to Faer√ªn.
Alinar was a friendly and outgoing individual. However, during missions he showed a cool professional mind and would not let anything and anyone menace Evermeet.
Alinar wielded one of the Baneblades of Demron, Dragathil.
