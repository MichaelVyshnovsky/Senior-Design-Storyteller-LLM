Handaramatur was a sage who lived in the North Ward of the city of Waterdeep in the early 1300s DR.
This sage specialized in knowledge of the genealogies of common Waterdhavians to date, the trade agreements and therefore ties between them, businesses they founded, and their guild memberships. Prior to his death, he was alleged to have discovered some "shady secrets" during his research.
In the harsh winter of 1331 DR, Handaramatur was said to have died of a "contagious fever." The "shady secrets" he was alleged to have discovered and written down were never found, though whether this was due to theft or hiding was uncertain. In later years, the cul-de-sac he lived on would be renamed in his honor to Handaramaturs Court.
