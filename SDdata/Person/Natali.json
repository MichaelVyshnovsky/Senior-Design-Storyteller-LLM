        "mainbody": "Natali was a monk of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose in the late 15th century DR.\nNatali was not sure about her vocation as a monk her dreams shifted from being a great warrior, a devoted priest, or a powerful wizard. She was very intrigued by adventurers and wanted to learn their fighting skills. Natali tried to act bigger than she was, but feared half-orcs and obvious barbarians. She also found the monastery and its monks a bit stifling.\nNatali was the daughter of a pair of itinerant merchants in Damara until some orcs killed her parents. She was saved by a group of paladins of Ilmater, who took her to the monastery.\nNatali was a novice monk. She assisted Father Hern at the doors at the entrance of the monastery."
