        "mainbody": "'''Natali''' was a monk of the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]] in the late 15th century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Natali was not sure about her vocation as a monk; her dreams shifted from being a great warrior, a devoted priest, or a powerful wizard. She was very intrigued by adventurers and wanted to learn their fighting skills. Natali tried to act bigger than she was, but feared [[half-orc]]s and obvious barbarians. She also found the monastery and its monks a bit stifling.",
        "History": "Natali was the daughter of a pair of itinerant merchants in [[Damara]] until some [[orc]]s killed her parents. She was saved by a group of [[paladin]]s of [[Ilmater]], who took her to the monastery.",
        "Activities": "Natali was a novice monk. She assisted Father [[Hern (monk)|Hern]] at the doors at the entrance of the monastery."
