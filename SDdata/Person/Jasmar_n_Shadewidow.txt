Jasmarn Shadewidow was a small-time crime lord in Skullport.
Jasmarn was cold and emotionless. She usually never departed from her shop, instead operating through underlings.
She had a vulture familiar called Gakk.
Once Jasmarn was a talented apprentice chirurgeon in Waterdeep until she was discovered performing necromantic rites on bodies in the City of the Dead. Abandoned by her master, she continued her experiments until found a gate to Skullport. Once there, Jasmarn joined the Cryptkey Facilitations organization, trading her knowledge of secret and little-used access routes into many nearby tombs and the location of the gate for training in necromancy from the facilitators. Soon she rose to become the leader of the group.
