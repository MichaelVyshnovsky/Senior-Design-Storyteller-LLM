        "mainbody": "'''Terrance Decamber''' was the undersecretary of the [[Master Mariners' Guild]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 1370s [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Terrance had very pale skin, thin lips, blood-red curls, and a hawkish nose.",
        "History": "In [[1371 DR]],{{DDTS}} Terrance Decamber along with other members of his guild attended the wedding of the Open Lord of Waterdeep [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] and [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]]. The wedding was going to take away from the Master Mariners' Guild's business via a trade agreement between Waterdeep and the [[Boareskyr]] family. The Mariners led by [[Jheldarr Boaldegg]] plotted to disrupt the event; the guild members set a crossbow trap to fire at the husband and wife during the ceremony. The plan was foiled by a young noble [[Kastonoph Nesher]]. Prior to the trap being set, Terrance was killed during a masquerade ball after Piergeiron witnessed the Mariners attempting to murder young Kastonoph."
