        "mainbody": "Rhodhan was a cleric from Pangaea who served as the second-in-command of the multi-planar Chemcheaux business for Prismal the Outrageous.\nRhodhan was a handsome man with blue eyes.\nRhodhan had an abiding respect for the law, while maintaining a deep empathy for those less fortunate than himself. He was also extremely pacifistic and refused to carry a weapon or use offensive spells, resorting only to competitive arm wrestling as a last resort.\nRhodhan was an all-round surpassing man, with exceptional physical strength and fitness as well as sharp mental faculties and a wise countenance. He was skilled in the fields of animal handling and training, ancient history, healing and herbalism, heraldry, and spellcraft. On top of all that, he was fully literate. His divine powers involved the spheres of animals, creation, divination, the elements, healing, and protection.\nRhodhan wore a robe of protection +4, a ring of protection +3, and boots of speed.\nRhodhan had a wife and seven children. His eldest daughter had three children of her own."
