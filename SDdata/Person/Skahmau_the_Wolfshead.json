The hippopotamus hero [[Khises]] was supposed to have battled Skahmau at the bottom of the [[Mother of Rivers]].\n\nPrincess [[Amenstar]] of Cursrah had a painting of this battle scene within her private privy. Pressing the eyes of Khises and Skahmau would open a secret door to the cellars below the royal compound, and she used it frequently to sneak away to be with her friends.",
