{{quote|''Will you tell this old man to hurry up and fight me?''|Josinn Kell}}

==Description==
Josinn was brash young man with blond hair and neatly short-trimmed facial hair. He had an intense stare as if constantly looking for weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the recently rebuilt mire village of West Harbor was menaced by a duo of [[black dragon]]s. In fear of his home's destruction, Josinn Kell, along with many other villages, picked up arms and began training in case West Harbor needed defending. Josinn's weapon of choice was a single [[club]] and he defended himself with a small [[shield]].
