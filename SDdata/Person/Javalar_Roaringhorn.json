        "mainbody": "Javalar Roaringhorn was the leader of the Knights of the Unicorn during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nJavalar led a group of adventurers during the exploration of the elven castle of Ellahana Raikeil deep within the Moonwood. After discovering and experimenting with the Crown of Joy and Tears, Javalar exited the castle in the moonlight and declared \"May none again find the Crown of Joy and Tears unless they enter with the heart of a child and the laugh of a dryad or wish to regain that which they have lost.\" Intrigued by these events, an avatar of Lurue appeared and took the adventurers on an exhilarating ride through the forest with her Silver Herd. The group chose to name themselves the Knights of the Unicorn in Lurues honor and pledged their service to the Unicorn Queen.\nFollowing the Time of Troubles, Javalar became a commander of one of the bands of the Order of the Unicorn, one of several smaller bands split from the Knights of the Unicorn with the hopes of doing good deeds over a larger area."
