'''Karis''' was the mad wife of [[Elden Vargas]] in [[Neverwinter]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
Karis was a storm sorceress of [[Rashemen]].

Before the [[Spellplague]], during a diplomatic mission, Karis met and fell in love with the [[War Wizard of Cormyr]], Elden Vargas. They remained always together. However, when it was discovered that Elden had entered into a pact with [[Asmodeus]] in order to augment his psychic powers, he was attacked by his fellows.

After moving to Neverwinter, Karis suffered a collapse and, thanks to [[Mordai Vell]], Elden took her to [[Helm's Hold]]. She regained a little of her mind in the Cathedral, where Elden conducted a ritual to cure her by absorbing into her a storm. He was defeated by adventurers however, and it was not clear if Karis was cured or not.
