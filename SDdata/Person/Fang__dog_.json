        "mainbody": "'''Fang''' was a [[fenhound]], part of the Munroe \"family\" that harassed inhabitants of [[Liam's Hold]] in [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "Fang was a massive brute of a dog whose jaw seemingly was always covered in gore - evidence of the beast's recent meals.",
        "History": "In 1372 DR, Fang, along with its masters, [[Methro Munroe|Methro]], [[Jethro Munroe|Jeth]], [[Yage Munroeâ€Ž|Yage]], and [[Sossi Munroe|Sossi \"Munroe\"]], camped out on the outskirts of the hamlet of Liam's Hold along the [[Trade Way]]. The gang of vagrants quickly became a nuisance and danger to the community after they started harassing and roughing up local farmers. To guarantee the safety of her village, Mayor [[Wilsey]] listed the help of the individual known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. The adventurer was investigating mysteriously disappearing cattle on the [[Wild Pastures]] and was considered a trusted ally. Mayor offered the Hero the [[Stronghold (Liam's Hold)|Stronghold]] - a small keep outside of the hamlet that once belonged to evil cultists of [[Bhaal]], in exchange for driving the Monroe vagrants away without bloodshed."
