        "Possessions": "''[[Sieronius Dethick's wedding ring]]'' was still among the vampire's possessions. The ring possessed potent [[enchantment]]s and could be used to break Sieronius's curse if he had a willing or unwilling bride. He also possessed the legendary unique magic ''[[Staff of Konash]]''.",
        "History": "While on a mission on the surface of [[Faer√ªn]], Sieronius was captured by the warrior-[[wizard]] [[Sunder Halyndliam]]. Sunder imprisoned Sieronius in the dungeons beneath his stronghold, drained of all his blood, and forced him to ingest a [[curse]]d substance that transformed him into a [[vampire]]. The only way to break the curse was for Sieronius's wife to free him.\n\nBy 1372 DR, Sunder Halyndliam was long dead, and the settlement of [[Liam's Hold]] had been built atop the remains of his stronghold. Sieronius stalked the hamlet's inhabitants to find a suitable new wife for him to kill, raise from the dead, and finally break his curse. He targeted [[Nell Kirschtorte]], but was scared off by the baker's daughter, young [[sorceress]] [[Jemmy Kirschtorte]]. Eventually, Sieronius successfully captured [[Xanda Pennywell]], a weaver from Liam's Hold. The fate of the drow vampire remained unclear, however. Some claimed he was slain by the [[Hero of Daggerford]] who was investigating the seamstress' disappearance. Other said the vampire claimed Xanda as his mesmerized unwilling wife and gained freedom. Some even suggested the Hero brought a gloomy young woman from [[Daggerford]] - [[Lula Redcap]], for the vampire to take as his wife in exchange for Xanda Pennywell's life."
