Tracker Bal was a servant of the Absolute who dwelled within the Shattered Sanctum during the late 15 century DR.
Bal had green-brown skin, which was decorated across his face and body with blue war paint. He wore tattered leather armor adorned with bones and an amulet bearing the holy symbol of his goddess.
After the Cult of the Absolute raided and torched Waukeens Rest in the , Bal and a handful of other goblins were taksed with defending a checkpoint outpost just beyond the Shattered Sanctum.
