        "mainbody": "yrentennimar, often known as Old Fyren, was a red dragon who had his lair in the Snowflake Mountains of Erlkazar. He was one of the most powerful and famous dragons living in the region.\nWhen Cadderly Bonaduce wanted to destroy the evil magical items known as the Ghearufu in the , a divine inspiration from Deneir informed him that he needed the fire of a dragon. Cadderly went to Fyrentennimars lair but Fyrentennimar didnt want to help. As a last resort, Cadderly used a powerful spell to change the dragons alignment, and the dragon, now a gentle creature, collaborated to destroy the evil Ghearufu.\nLater, with this powerful ally, but only until the end of the spell, Cadderly decided with his party to assault and destroy Castle Trinity. In route to the enemy fortress, Cadderly and his band spotted a troupe of goblins and giants returning from Shilmista forest. At the urging of Cadderly and his friends Fyrentennimar attacked the evil creatures. During the course of the battle, Cadderlys spell failed and the old red attacked the priest of Denier and his allies. Using the magic granted to him by Denier, Cadderly was able to siphon away much of Fyrentennimars strength allowing his allies to kill the red wyrm."
