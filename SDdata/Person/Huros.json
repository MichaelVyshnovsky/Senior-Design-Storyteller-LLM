She would become one of the six heroes to aid the Gate against Mordoc SeLanmere‎‎, the vampire villain of the Battle of Bones. While Allessia adventures back in Baldurs Gate, Huros collected copious coin from her to aid orphans, unfortunate, and sick of the city, eventually allowing his pupil to reach the status of a paladin of Helm after serving the church one last time in slaying Goreth Vileblack – a foul cleric of Cyric who was assembling an army of skeletons in the foothills of the Sunset Mountains to attack the town of Asbravn."
