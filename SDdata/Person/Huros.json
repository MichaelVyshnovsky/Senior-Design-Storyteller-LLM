        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century DR, Huros sent a letter out to [[Allessia Faithhammer]], his former pupil, summoning her from her home in [[Secomber]] to [[Baldur's Gate]]. She would become one of the six heroes to aid the Gate against [[Mordoc SeLanmere‎‎]], the [[vampire]] villain of the [[Battle of Bones]]. While Allessia adventures back in Baldur's Gate, Huros collected copious [[coin]] from her to aid orphans, unfortunate, and sick of the city, eventually allowing his pupil to reach the status of a [[paladin]] of Helm after serving the church one last time in slaying [[Goreth Vileblack]] – a foul cleric of [[Cyric]] who was assembling an army of [[skeleton]]s in the foothills of the [[Sunset Mountains]] to attack the town of [[Asbravn]]."
