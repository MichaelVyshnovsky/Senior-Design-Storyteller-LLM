Scirkhel Wands was a ranger and bard of the Wands family in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.
Scirkhel was born in 1319 DR. At a young age, he left home to travel and on his journeys he met and befriended a ranger who told him all he knew about the Heralds of Faer√ªn.
Back in Waterdeep, Scirkhel assumed the office of Falconfree as a member of the Heralds. Circa 1372 DR, he enrolled in the New Olamn bardic college to study as a bard, and here befriended Regnet Amcathra.
He was the great great nephew of Maskar Wands.
