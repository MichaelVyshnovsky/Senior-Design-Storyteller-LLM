'''Scirkhel Wands''' was a [[ranger]] and [[bard]] of the [[Wands]] family in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Scirkhel was born in [[1319 DR]]. At a young age, he left home to travel and on his journeys he met and befriended a ranger who told him all he knew about the [[Heralds of Faer√ªn]].

Back in Waterdeep, Scirkhel assumed the office of [[Falconfree]] as a member of the Heralds. Circa 1372 DR, he enrolled in the [[New Olamn]] bardic college to study as a bard, and here befriended [[Regnet Amcathra]].

==Relations==
He was the great great nephew of [[Maskar Wands]].
