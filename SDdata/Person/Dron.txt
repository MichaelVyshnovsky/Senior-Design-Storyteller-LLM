'''Dron''' was a [[werewolf]] from the [[Domains of Dread|domain]] of [[Barovia]], who lived during the [[Faer√ªn]]ian 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He had long scraggily black hair in his [[human]] form, and black fur in his hybrid form.

==Personality==
Dron was rather untrusting had a particularly bad temper.

==Relationships==
Dron was part of the [[Kiril Stoyanovich]]'s pack of werewolves, that made their den in a cave system near [[Lake Baratok]]. He was particularly close to his packmate [[Utna]].

==History==
[[File:Dron Krydle.png|thumb|right|300px|Dron in his [[werewolf]] form, being attacked by the [[adventurer]] [[Krydle]]]]
Sometime ''circa'' the 1480s DR, Dron and Utna accompanied the [[warlock]] [[Sangin]] to [[Toril]] on the [[Prime Material plane]] in order to recover a specific magical item that allowed travel away from Barovia. The trio briefly worked together to claim the item for themselves, to escape from Strahd's ever-present and far-reaching control.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 1}}

After tracking the item to the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], they abducted the cleric [[Nerys Kathon]] in order to determine the authenticity of the [[relic]]. They were interrupted by the [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate]], an adventuring party that prevented them from claiming the item, a locked that once belonged to [[Tatyana]]. After a brief battle, Dron and Utna, along with Sangin, Nerys, and the adventurers were transported by the mists of the [[Shadowfell]] back to Barovia.

Once back in the [[Domain of Dread]], Dron and Utna abandoned the adventurers and Sangin, who had abducted back to [[Castle Ravenloft]].{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 2}} They returned to their pack at the caves near the lake, and reported what had happened to their pack leader Kiril. The warlock Sangin barged into the cave network having been turned as an undead [[vampire]], demanding that one of either Dron or Utna be slain as punishment for their failure. Kiril chose Dron, and the lycanthrope was torn apart and feasted upon by his fellow pack members.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 3}}
