        "mainbody": "'''Rusty Al''' was a weathered salty dog, merchant, pawn broker, and [[tattoo]]ist who ran [[Rusty Al's Tattoo & Pawn]] in the [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Docks District]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|Oh bloody hell, I'm a tattooist, not a tour guide. Go ask your questions o' someone else, lass.|Rusty Al}}",
        "Description": "Rusty Al was an aged but large and muscular [[human]] man. Although he appeared to be rusty with age, his name was a reference to his red hair. His left eye was covered by an [[eye patch]], his left wrist was replaced by a [[hook|hook hand]], and his chest was decorated with tattoos, proudly displayed whilst running the shop.",
        "Personality": "Rusty had a gruff and direct personality, especially when dealing with late-night customers at his shop.",
        "History": "Rusty Al's was an established business by the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. He and his shop survived the strife of that year: the [[plague]] of the [[Wailing Death]] that ravaged Neverwinter and the crumbling economy after the war between [[Luskan]] and Neverwinter. As the city recovered, Al's pawn business was suffering from the greatly weakened economy, so much of the business's [[coin]] came from tattooing. When a duo of adventuring sailors that included [[Nisar Zayid]] was seeking to depart for the [[Nelanther Isles]] in 1372 DR, Rusty Al offered a special deal on tattoo designs that might've been applied to both adventuring sailors. The designs included ''[[Rope]] & [[Anchor]],'' ''Heart & [[Arrow]]'', ''Eye & Tears,'' and ''Gnaked [[Gnome]]''. Two people, one tattoo each, were going for a hundred [[gold]] total."
