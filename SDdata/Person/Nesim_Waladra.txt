'''Nesim Waladra''' was a [[monk]] of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Nesim Waladra was the disciple of [[Leosin Erlanthar]].

In the 1480s DR, Nesim Waladra was very concerned about Leosin Erlanthar's well-being and whereabouts and requested help from an adventuring party while in [[Greenest]].  The monk was wounded when [[Lennithon]] the [[blue dragon]] attacked the town with forces of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].
