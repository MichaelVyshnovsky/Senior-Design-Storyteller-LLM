'''Mingus Etcherly''' was the editor-in-chief of the ''[[Findings from the Hinterlands]]'' publication for a time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Mingus arranged for a hastily written issue of ''Findings'' to be published to warn folks of the [[Sword Coast]] about the [[cult of the Absolute]]. He collected reports from [[Elturgard]] to complete the new edition, then dispatched messengers to surrounding cities in the [[Western Heartlands]] to glean more information.
