Sarth Baretha was a githyanki warrior who was alive during the late 15 century DR.
She was in the possession of a Githyanki slate, a magical map that displayed the location of a crèche on the Sword Coast.
In battle, Baretha wore a suit of Githyanki half plate, and wielded a greatsword.
Baretha served under the merciless Kithrak known as Voss.
In the Faerûnian  Baretha accompanied Voss and other githyanki warriors in search of a mysterious artifact that they knew to be a powerful weapon in the fight against the illithids. Their search took them to the planet of Toril, and the region of the Sword Coast.
