Sarth '''Baretha''' was a [[githyanki]] warrior who was alive during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
She was in the possession of a ''Githyanki slate'', a magical map that displayed the location of a ''[[crèche]]'' on the [[Sword Coast]].

In battle, Baretha wore a suit of ''Githyanki [[half plate]]'', and wielded a [[greatsword]].

==Relationships==
Baretha served under the merciless [[Kith'rak]] known as [[Voss]].

==History==
In the [[Faerûn]]ian {{YearlinkName|1492}} Baretha accompanied Voss and other githyanki warriors in search of a ''[[mysterious artifact]]'' that they knew to be a powerful weapon in the fight against the [[illithid]]s. Their search took them to the planet of [[Toril]], and the region of the Sword Coast.
