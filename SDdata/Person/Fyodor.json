        "mainbody": "'''Fyodor''' was a [[Rashemaar berserker|berserker]] from [[Rashemen]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a companion and lover to [[Liriel Baenre]]. He was a member of the [[Black Bear lodge]] ''fang'' in [[Dernovia]].",
        "Description": "Fyodor had thick muscles that made him resemble a tall [[dwarf]], but he wore no beard and had finer features. He had short, unevenly cut, dark hair, pale skin, and pale topaz-blue eyes. He was less than six feet tall, but his berserker rages made him appear closer to seven feet. He carried a {{SIAdj|3|foot|long=yes|adj=long}} cudgel made of driftwood and a heavy [[broadsword]] with a dull blade, which he could not properly wield except during his berserker rages.\n\nIn 1361 DR, Fyodor, perhaps because of his proximity to [[rune magic]] or other shapeshifters on Ruathym, became a shapeshifter. His shapeshifting form was a large black [[bear]]. Like most shapeshifters, he was ravenous after his change.",
        "Personality": "Fyodor was generally very calm and serious, though he did have a quietly humorous streak. He was a hard worker, but a bit of a dreamer. His favorite adage was, \"There are those who think and those who dream.\" He was very fond of repeating it to Liriel.",
        "History": {
            "Youth": "Fyodor was born in the {{YearlinkName|1342}}, [[Rashemen]]. He once attempted to tame a wild snowcat in his homeland.\n\nBefore he became a berserker warrior at the age of 15, Fyodor was apprenticed to [[Antonea]], a swordsmith of Dernovia who did not survive the [[Tuigan Horde]].",
            "Quest for the Windwalker": "In the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Fyodor was sent away from his homeland, armed with only a blunt sword, because he could not control himself when he entered his berserker state and was dangerous for everyone to have around, even his friends.<ref> His grandmother, a ''[[wychlaran]]'' named [[Zofia]], send him on a quest called a ''[[dajemma]]'' to find the ancient [[artifact]] known as the [[Windwalker (artifact)|Windwalker]]. He followed it to the [[Underdark]] and met the [[drow]] [[Liriel Baenre]] in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}. They became friends and later lovers. Both fled the Underdark for the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]] near [[Skullport]] and started on a quest to [[Ruathym]], where Liriel hoped to harness the power of the Windwalker. With this she wanted to get control over her drow magic and wield it on the surface while still helping Fyodor with his curse.\n\nThey got to the island with help from a pirate captain named [[Hrolf|Hrolf the Unruly]]. He and his pirate crew took the companions on the ship ''[[Elfmaid (ship)|Elfmaid]]'' to Ruathym, where Liriel studied [[rune magic]] and Fyodor tried to harness his berserker rage through the Ruathym art of taking a beast's form while raging. Something was wrong on the island, however, and after ending an assault from several aquatic creatures and extraplanar beasts, the First Axe of Holgerstead, [[Wedigar Ruthmaald]], was injured and Fyodor acted in his stead for a time.  During their stay on the island, Liriel carved a rune on the tree of [[Yggdrasil's Child]] and didn't need the Windwalker amulet to use her powers on the surface any more. Due to the help of a [[sea elf]] named [[Xzorsh]], the companions traced the creatures back to a [[mind flayer]] [[sorceress]] under the sea.  The illithid was allied with one of Liriel's enemies from the Underdark, [[Shakti Hunzrin]], and the navy of [[Luskan]]. After Liriel defeated Shakti and sent her to the [[Abyss]] through a ''[[portal]]'', the companions, with the help of sea elves, released the slaves being held in the city and escaped, leaving the illithid and [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]] behind to their fate. On the surface of the waves, the companions worked with the Ruathen natives to turn back the Luskan navy with their own ships and Liriel's magic.\n\nAfter their adventures on the island, both traveled back to Rashemen. But they were followed by enemies and in a last battle Liriel and Fyodor helped the Rashemi to defend their country against drow led by [[Gorlist]] and Shakti. During the battle, Fyodor was mortally wounded and died with his blunt sword in his hand."

        "Relationships": {
            "Family": "Fyodor's father was [[Mahryon]], the ''fyrra'' (leader) of Dernovia, who was killed at the [[Immil Dale|Battle of Immil Dale]] in 1360 DR. Mahryon was the firstborn son of [[Zofia]]; thus, Zofia was Fyodor's grandmother.\n\nFyodor's sister was [[Vastish]]. She had many children that were Fyodor's nieces and nephews. Fyodor was quite close to all of them. Vastish once adopted a [[wolf]] pup named [[Ghost (wolf)|Ghost]]. Because of that, her children considered wolves friendly and her son approached a wolf in the wild, which killed him.\n\nFyodor was close to his cousin [[Petyar]], the son of his uncle [[Simoath]]. Petyar hated wolves.",
            "Sasha": "Before entering the Underdark, Fyodor traveled with a horse called [[Sasha (horse)|Sasha]], who was then killed by the drow. He considered her a loyal friend and traveling companion.",
            "Liriel Baenre": "Fyodor traveled with the [[drow]] rogue [[Liriel Baenre]] beginning in the late winter or early spring of 1361 DR until his death. They became lovers, and she later became his [[wychlaran]] and was able to control his berserker rages. He died protecting her."
