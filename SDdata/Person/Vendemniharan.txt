Vendemniharan, often known as simply Vendem, was a green dragon allied with the Cult of the Dragon in Sembia in the late 14 century DR. 
Vendemniharan was the son of the two green dragons both called Venom Venominhandar and Venomindhar.
In the , Overmistress Mirabeta Selkirk was searching for allies against the Shadovar who supported her enemies in the Sembian Civil War, and so negotiated a deal with the Cult to have the strength of Vendemniharan in the planned attack against Selgaunt.
On Uktar 30, during the Battle of Selgaunt after some earth elementals and fire elementals had weakened the defenders of the city, Vendem attacked. Shadovar Prince Rivalen Tanthul faced him but was injured by the dragons acid breath. A spell-duel started between Rivalen and Vendem, but in the end the Prince of Shade heavily injured the green dragon, who fled the battlefield.
