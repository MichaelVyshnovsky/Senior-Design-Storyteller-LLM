'''Imura''' was a [[rakshasa]] who traveled the deserts of [[Anauroch]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Imura ventured across the desert with their traveling companion [[Sikkat]], disguised as nomadic [[Bedine]]. They attempted to lure travelers to their doom, by offering them guidance to a "magical oasis".
