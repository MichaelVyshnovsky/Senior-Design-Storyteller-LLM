        "mainbody": "'''Sujit''' was the [[imp]] [[familiar]] and a close friend and companion of [[Delfen Ondabarl]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Sujit and I are old, dear friends. We are bonded in that special way that allows mages to chain their destinies to creatures of power. Put simply, he is my familiar... though he also is my friend.''|Delfen \"Yellowknife\" Ondabarl}}",
        "Personality": "Sujit was a creature of hellfire; thus, he hated ice and loathed living with his previous master, [[Mogdor]] in the icy plains of [[Etabalon]]. His experience of being trapped in a chest left the imp with a deep dislike of such containers.",
        "History": "Sujit was freed from servitude to his cruel master by Delfen Ondabarl sometime before 1372 DR. The imp befriended the wizard, and they later formed a pact of a wizard and a familiar. Freeing Sujit earned Delfen a bitter enemy in Mogdor, a cruel and strange man with horns and devilish wings who cheerfully declared himself Ondabarl's nemesis. Over the years, Mogdor tried several times to retrieve his stolen property, and in 1372 DR, he came very close to snatching Sujit, magically bounding him and stepping through a ''[[gate]]'' to Etabalon.\n\nThe winged evil wizard hired a bounty hunter from [[Daggerford]], [[Erik the Fin]] for the deed. Fin placed a trapped chest in an alley outside the [[Sorceller's Encapsulate]] where Delfen Ondabarl often spent his days among his fellow masters of the arcane. The open cast played an alluring ditty that attracted the curious imp, trapping the familiar inside. However, Erik the Fin dropped the chest into [[Delimbiyr River]] as he was trying to board a boat back to Mogdor's hideout. Unable to travel searching for the chest, Erik found a mercenary who was willing to - the individual who later would be known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]].\n\nEventually, the Hero found the said chest. It ended up being washed ashore in one of the coastal caves in the [[Western Farmlands]]. Amused by the chest's talkativeness and pleads to be returned to Yellowknife, it was taken back to Sujit's heartbroken friend. After being reunited, Delfen came out with a plan of swift revenge. The wizard placed a trapped and deadly [[demilich]] [[Extallimix]] inside the chest. The Hero of Daggerford was tasked with returning the chest to Erik the Fin to be passed along to Mogdor. This was believed to be the end of Sujit's old master, who was killed by the angry undead."
