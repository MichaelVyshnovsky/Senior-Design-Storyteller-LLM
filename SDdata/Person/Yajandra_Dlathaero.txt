'''Yajandra Dlathaero''' was a [[wizard]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in [[1367 DR]].

==History==
Born in [[Calimshan]] to a satrap, at an early age Yajandra was uninterested in local intrigues but had an aptitude for magic. So she cut ties with her family and trained as wizard under [[Asheund]].

Later, Yajandra went on a spell-trading trip to [[Amn]]. She disappeared for some years studying [[dragon]]s. She resurfaced visiting [[Candlekeep]] and later in [[Zazesspur]] where she studied with the sage [[Cthethros]], a great dragon expert.

Later Yajandra wandered Amn together with the disguised [[gold dragon]] [[Sandro]] until a [[Harper]] told her about the [[Well of Dragons]].

Yajandra bought a house in the nearby village of [[Ladydove]] and hers was the only house to survive an attack from the [[Dire Dragon]]. So Yajandra transformed the house into an inn and continued her dragon studies with the profits of the inn.
