'''Pinchwit Wigglehoof''' was a [[gnome]] goatherd in [[Leilon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Pinchwit bred a herd of [[giant goat]]s that provided large quantities of milk and meat. She also sold their goat hair, prized for its warmth and tensile strength.

==Relationships==
Pinchwit worked as a goatherd for [[Dagult Neverember]] and the rebuilt town of [[Leilon]], so her profits belonged to the town.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], part of Pinchwit's flock was to be sold to a wealthy trader from [[Waterdeep]] for a large profit. [[Elmar Barthen]], owner of [[Barthen's Provisions]] in [[Phandalin]], had negotiated the deal. The goats had to be transported from Leilon to Phandalin as part of the arrangement. The Leilon town council hired a group of [[adventurers]] to protect Pinchwit and her goats on the seven-day journey. During their travels, the goats were spooked by [[wyverns]] and had to be rounded up by Pinchwit and the adventurers. Later, the herd was attacked by a group of [[ogre]]s on the prowl that the adventurers fought back. In the end, Pinchwit and her flock arrived safely at Phandalin.
