        "mainbody": "'''Flaerivus Grevauldyn''' was one of the earliest [[Magister]]s of [[Mystra]], having held the title for a few years during the 2{{nd}} century [[DR]]. His reign lasted for three years.",
        "Description": "In his youth, Flaerivus was a dashing and charismatic man with a shrewd mind, merry demeanor and sharp wit. His charm wore away with age however, and he became quite paranoid and barbaric in his later years.",
        "History": {
            "Early Life": "Flaerivus was once a mercenary in [[Athkatla]], having accumulated enough power and influence to charter his own company, the [[Silver Swordpoint]], in the [[131 DR|Year of the Cockatrice's Stare, 131 DR]]. At some point in his younger years, the debonair warrior discovered an old tomb that held a number of arcane secrets, including [[spell]]s that allowed Flaerivus to imbue his clenched fish with magical power.\n\nIn the [[137 DR|Year of the King's Destiny, 137 DR]], the raffish Flaerivus and his mercenaries rescued a [[priest]]ess of [[Mystra]] from a band of [[orc]]s. In return for this brave deed, she taught him the fundamental aspects of [[the Art]]. In the span of two years, Flaerivus dedicated himself to magical studies and had ascended to a level among the highest-ranking [[mage]]s of the Realms.",
            "Rise to Power": "Flaerivus was considered an \"upstart\" among the mages of the [[Shoon Imperium]] and faced his first real challenge in the [[141 DR|Year of the Impenetrable Mystery, 141 DR]], from [[Thaerdimor]] the self-proclaimed \"Mage-King\" of [[Daerimathlor]]. Flaerivus defeated the ruler of the island kingdom and fought off many other challengers in the decade to come.\n\nIn the [[151 DR|Year of the Kraken, 151 DR]], Flaerivus defeated a group of mages who, according to the [[Athkatla]]n [[sage]] [[Merlivert]], were the \"six most powerful\" [[spellcaster]]s of the [[Sword Coast]]. He arose from the battle completely changed; as Merlivert described him, Flaerivus was a \"living black flame as tall as a man\". He proceeded to travel the lands, flying from one [[wizard]] tower to another, indiscriminately killing any mages he encountered. When the marauding mage ventured into one such tower he was stopped, and welcomed, by [[Azuth]] who appeared in the form of an impossibly tall man holding blue stars in his hands. The God of Wizards offered Flaerivus Grevauldyn the office of Magister.",
            "As Magister": "One of Flaerivus's first acts as magister was to gather several young apprentices in service to himself and established a great school of wizardry. He taught his pupils to serve him with strict obedience and ordered them to gather any magic they discovered in order that he was always had the most powerful spells at any given time.\n\nOther mages saw this as a grave threat and banded together to assault the vulgarian mage ''en masse'' in the [[154 DR|Year of the Jealous Hag, 154 DR]]. As Flaerivus attempted to master an incomplete personal ''[[mantle (spell)|mantle]]'', the resulting magical feedback ripped his body to shreds and killed many of the powerful mages that had attacked his fledgling academy."
