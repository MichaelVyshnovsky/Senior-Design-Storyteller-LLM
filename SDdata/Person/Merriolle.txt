Merriolle was an inhabitant of the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Merriolle was a high elven with a pale skin tone, blue eyes, and short, wavy blonde hair.
In the , during the Absolute crisis, Merriolle found herself among those Baldurians in a crowd who witnessed Bastian dZinn, a man of means, accosting the child named Rhaneld for accidentally hitting him with a rock while playing. Bastian believed that a child playing on a street was a sign of the citys crime-ridden downward spiral. Merriolle was outraged that a simple pebble would almost reduce someone to fisticuffs and believed that the Baldurs Mouth Gazette was responsible for riling people up and stoking up hate.
