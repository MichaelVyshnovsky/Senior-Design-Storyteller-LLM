Dame '''Aylin''' was an [[Deva (aasimar)|aasimar]] and the daughter of the goddess [[Selûne]], who was imprisoned within the [[Shadowfell]] by General [[Ketheric Thorm]] in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

{{Quote|Unshackled from shadows, she will rise in moonlit glory and carve a path of brightness to the accursed one's second death.|''Prophecy of [[Alaundo]].''}}

==Description==
{{Quote|Our [[Selûne|Lady of Silver]]. Hear me! She Who Guides, the Moonmaiden Selûne—mother of the so-called Nightsong...|Dame Aylin.}}<br />
She had pale skin that was uniquely blemished, appearing as cracked [[marble]], and light blonde hair she kept sheared on one side and long, brushed back along the other. She had white, feathered wings that granted her flight.

==Personality==
Aylin was a strong-willed, resilient and vengeful person. If she were ever wronged, Aylin would vow the full revenge with the full wrath of the heavens upon her foes. She was also quite direct, particularly about her feelings, even openly discussing her sexual attraction to Isobel in front of new friends. It was possible Aylin's vengeful, brash personality was the result of the trauma from a century of suffering as Ketheric Thorm's source of immortality and the horrific experiments and torture [[Balthazar (necromancer)|Balthazar]] subjected her to.

==Relationships==
{{Quote|I'm here. And so are you. And my father, he - he can't hurt us any longer.|Isobel Thorm, reunited with Aylin.}}<br/>

Aylin served her divine mother Selûne as a [[paladin]].

Some time during the late 14{{th}} century DR, Aylin fell in love with [[Isobel Thorm]], a devoted follower of Selûne. Isobel's father, Ketheric, assumed the love wasn't genuine but was wrong; even after over one hundred years being tortured and repeatedly killed and resurrected in the Shadowfell, Isobel's death was still a painful memory for Aylin. She also referred to Isobel as "her consort" while praying to Selûne, giving the relationship a formal affirmation.

Her relationship with Ketheric himself was more complicated. He didn't approve of Aylin being intimate with his daughter, and yet she was the daughter of Ketheric's patron deity, so the two kept a respectful distance from each other. When Isobel died, they both shared the pain of her loss, but did not bond over the experience. Any good will Aylin may have had towards Ketheric ended when he tricked her into the ''[[soul cage]]'' in Shadowfell. His betrayal of Selûne, especially given he abandoned the deity's service in favor of [[Shar]], deceiving her and the pain and abuses she suffered there gave Aylin a deadly, burning hatred of Ketheric.

{{Quote|I dreamt every night that you'd come back to me. That somehow it was all a nightmare dawn would undo.|Aylin, to Isobel.}}<br/>
Some time ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1368}}{{Thorm-time}}, Ketheric Thorm and his advisor Balthazar tricked and abducted Dame Aylin and imprisoned her within a ''soul cage'' in the Shadowfell for his then-goddess Shar. In return, Ketheric would be spared the loss and pain that accompanied the death of his daughter Isobel, who happened to be Aylin's lover. After Aylin was imprisoned  behind a ''gate'' underneath the [[Gauntlet of Shar]], the immortal strength of Aylin's soul was transferred to Ketheric by unholy [[necromantic]] magic, granting the general eternal life.

Aylin was subjected to a century of torture and brutal experiments by Balthazar. She was also repeatedly slain by the goddess' would-be [[Dark Justiciars]] time and time again, only to return trapped within her cage. During this time, Dame Aylin came to be known as the '''Nightsong'''. Isobel never forgave her father for the horrors he subjected Aylin to.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[wizard]] [[Lorroakan]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] attempted to secure the Nightsong for himself. He posted a bounty offering much riches for her retrieval. At least one adventuring party, led by [[Aradin]], took the mage up on his offer.
