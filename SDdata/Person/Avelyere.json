        "Description": "Lady Avelyere had light gray eyes and brown hair. Although she was in her early 40s in [[1468 DR]], she still appeared young and beautiful.",
        "History": "In [[1469 DR]], Lady Avelyere's attention was drawn by [[Parise Ulfbinder]] and [[Draygo Quick]] to a talented young [[Bedine]] girl, who showed strong promise in the magical arts. She took her students out and used force to capture this girl, whose name was [[Ruqiah]] (actually the reincarnated [[Catti-brie]]). Ruqiah became a student at the Coven and remained there for ten years. In [[1479 DR]], Lady Avelyere used a spell to force Ruqiah to reveal all her secrets, including her true identity and her intention to travel to [[Icewind Dale]] to find [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. Lady Avelyere took that information to Ulfbinder and Quick. When Catti-brie discovered what had happened, she faked her own death in a fire and fled to the [[Silver Marches]]. Lady Avelyere continued to pursue Catti-brie using magical means, detecting her in [[Longsaddle]] in [[1482 DR]].",

The rooms were well-lit with windows, some of which had young students assisted by [[Bedine]] servants.",
