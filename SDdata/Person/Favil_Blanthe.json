        "mainbody": "xchequer Favil Blanthe was the financial manager of the Flaming Fist in the 15 century DR.\nThe exchequer was a corpulent senior citizen of the Gate.\nBlanthe, surprisingly, lacked discipline and did not care much for the law in comparison to his comrades. He belived that the Guild existed due to the terrible social injustices and class system of Baldurs Gate.\nAs exchequer, Blanthe was most often found at the Blade and Stars or the Counting House. Though formerly a member of the Guild, the financial manager took up the worship of Torm, the Loyal Fury.\nAround the 1420s DR, Blanthe was born in Rivington and later became a member of the Guild. Here, he operated under the alias, \"Gold Lahar\", and became a formidable bookmaker and burglar until around the 1440s DR. Due to a dispute, Lahar wished to leave the Guild in order to avoid being killed. It was then that he took on the name \"Favil Blanthe\" and assumd a new identity.\nAfter his former associates believed that he had fled or otherwise, he signed up with the Flaming Fist. During his first half a year, all Guild members who were associated with Gold Lahar had disappeared. Favil quickly worked his way up the ranks of the Flaming Fist, in part due to his inside knowledge of the Guild. Due to his service, he became a spymaster for the Flaming Fist, and later the Exchequer.\nBlanthes life would get more difficult when Rilsa Rael came to find out his former identity. Around 1482 DR, she wished to stock up on weapons and armor to equip the Guild, and blackmailed Blanthe in order to make this happen.\nIt was rumored that he heavily indulged in drinking brews of a dwarven nature."
