        "Relationship": "Dermin tutored many young Harpers, including the [[druid]] [[Jaheira]], who he had originally recruited into the organization.\n\nHe was a member of the [[Athkatla]]n Harpers, who operated out of a luxurious estate near the city's docks. His associates included [[Galvarey]], [[Berinvar]], [[Rylock]], among others.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Dermin, Galvarey and other Athkatlan Harpers were conducting themselves in a manner quite out of line with the greater organization. They lived a lavish life at Galvarey's estate, and resorted to murdering those they perceived as their enemies."
