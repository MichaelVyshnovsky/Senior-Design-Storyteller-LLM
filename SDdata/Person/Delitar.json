        "mainbody": "'''Delitar the Slow''' was a historian working in [[Westgate]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was considered by many to be the greatest [[human]] historian in the Realms in [[1358 DR]].",
        "Description": "His nickname derived from his very slow speech, the result of a verbal stutter. It could take a long time for him to tell a story, and some believed it meant he was slow of mind as well, but this was far from the truth.",
        "Activities": "Delitar was one of the most respected historians of the [[Realms]], and was quoted by many sages. He had three subservient sages specializing in regional history and many scribes that worked under him. \n\n[[Artides]], the [[rock gnome]] historian, studied under Delitar during his teenage years.{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|68}}"
