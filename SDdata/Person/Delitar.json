        "mainbody": "Delitar the Slow was a historian working in Westgate in the midâ€“14 century DR. He was considered by many to be the greatest human historian in the Realms in 1358 DR. \nHis nickname derived from his very slow speech, the result of a verbal stutter. It could take a long time for him to tell a story, and some believed it meant he was slow of mind as well, but this was far from the truth.\nDelitar was one of the most respected historians of the Realms, and was quoted by many sages. He had three subservient sages specializing in regional history and many scribes that worked under him. \nArtides, the rock gnome historian, studied under Delitar during his teenage years."
