'''Lendarn''' was an [[evil]] [[wizard]] who lived on the [[Sword Coast]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Lendarn was present in the ruins beneath [[Firewine Bridge]] when the village of [[Gullykin]] was being terrorized by [[kobold]]s in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. 

While he was outwardly hostile towards interlopers who ventured into the ruins, it was unknown if he was allied with the [[oni mage]] responsible for the kobold assaults.
