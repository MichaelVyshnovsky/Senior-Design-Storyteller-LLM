'''Halfred''' was the last inkeeper of [[Last Light Inn]] in [[Reithwin]] during [[Ketheric Thorm's war]]. Following this, he became one of the leaders of the [[Church of Selûne|Selûnite]] resistance against Ketheric, who had turned to [[Shar]]. Halfred and his brother, [[Morfred]], fought until the [[Shadow-cursed lands|shadow curse]] overtook Reithwin. By {{YearlinkName|1492}} however, Halfred's efforts to hide Selûnite relics and establishing Last Light Inn as a haven turned fruitful with the sudden resurrection of [[Isobel Thorm]], who turned Last Light into, fittingly, the only place in Reithwin not infected by the curse. Halred's preparations also enabled both the [[Harpers]] and [[Absolute Adversaries]] to utilize the Inn as respite. 

{{Quote|Together, we shall preserve what we can of the Moonmaiden's light, and hope that the banners of the faithful soon rise against that treacherous dog, Thorm.|Halfred in a note to his brother}}

==History==
During the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]],{{Thorm-time}} Halfred and his brother Morfred served General [[Ketheric Thorm]]. Halfred managed the Last Light Inn, while Morfred worked as a mason, later tasked by Ketheric with constructing [[Moonrise Towers]]. Concerned about Ketheric's intentions, however, Halfred urged his brother to refuse the commission, but Morfred ignored his warnings. Tragedy struck when Ketheric's wife, [[Melodia Thorm]], passed away, followed soon after by his daughter, [[Isobel Thorm|Isobel]]. Overcome with grief, Ketheric abandoned his devotion to Selûne and turned to [[Shar]], assembling an army of [[Dark Justiciar]]s to purge Selûnite sympathies and eliminate those who refused to convert—including Halfred.

By {{Yearlink|1373}}, Halfred had become a key figure in the Selûnite resistance. He transformed Last Light Inn into a refuge for Selûnites, storing sacred relics in its basement. Halfred and Morfred remained in contact until Sharrans raided the [[Reithwin Mason's Guild]], Morfred's stronghold. Believing his brother dead or captured, Halfred continued the fight alone. However, Morfred had survived, striking a deal with the [[cambion]] [[Raphael]] to [[Yurgir|annihilate Ketheric’s forces]].

===Legacy===
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Last Light Inn was used as a safe haven for the Isobel Thorm, who had been resurrected by [[Myrkul]] in order to gain Ketheric's loyalty. Last Light Inn was subsequently used as a haven and respite for the [[Harpers]] against the lingering shadow curse. Halfred's notes detailing the Selûnite resistance and the activities of Ketheric were found by the [[Absolute Adversaries]]. The group also met Halfred's brother within the [[House of Hope]].
