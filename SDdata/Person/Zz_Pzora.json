        "mainbody": "ZzPzora was a two-headed deep dragon who lived near the drow city of Menzoberranzan in the Underdark. She was a friend of the wizard Liriel Baenre, and died helping Liriel fight a mercenary band in Skullport.\nHer most distinctive feature was her two, horned heads, the result of exposure to the faerzress of the Underdark. At roughly fifty feet in size, ZzPzora was smaller than most other deep dragons. Her scales were iridescent, glowing purple, and her wings were amethyst in color.\nZzPzoras two heads each had their own distinct personality. The left head longed for travel, adventure, and visiting cities both in the Underdark and on the surface. This head was somewhat flighty and vain, and prone to sudden bouts of sheer delight. The personality of the right head was more traditionally draconic, possessing a calculating, dry wit, and a love of treasure and solitude. The two heads were constantly at odds with each other, which gave ZzPzoras persona a tinge of madness and unpredictability.\nZzPzoras lair was located a handful of miles south of Menzoberranzan, in a hidden grotto that could only be accessed by navigating the side channels of the treacherous Cascades river. The difficulty of reaching her lair kept ZzPzora safe from the drow, in spite of her proximity to one of their major cities.\nThe grotto itself was riddled with smaller caves, and was suffused in powerful faerzress to the point that it said to be the most potent source of the magical radiation in the vicinity of Menzoberranzan. The magical radiation diminshed when Liriel Baenre removed the Banshees Needle&mdasha stone that served as the focal point of the faerzress in the area.\nShe was good friends with Liriel Baenre, a free-spirited drow wizard who occasionally visited the dragons lair, and affectionately referred to ZzPzora as \"Zip\". Though neither drow nor deep dragons were known for their honorable nature, the two enjoyed each others company, if somewhat warily.\nBefore ZzPzora was born, her mother battled a drow banshee in the cave that would come to serve as their lair. It was possible that the intense magical energy expended in this battle contributed to ZzPzoras two-headed mutation.\nBy the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR, ZzPzora had befriended Liriel Baenre. The young drow collected the deep dragons discarded scales, a lucrative commodity, and stored several magical items in the faerzress-filled cavern to boost their potency.\nTwo years later, in the Year of Maiden, 1361 DR, ZzPzora helped Liriel pry loose the Banshees Needle. The young wizard hoped to use the faerzress-filled stone to store her innate drow powers in the Windwalker amulet, allowing her to live and travel on the surface. In return, ZzPzora asked Liriel to help her reach the surface, to which the drow agreed.\nNot long after, the Windwalker fell into the clutches of the Dragons Hoard mercenary band in Skullport. Since the mercenaries enjoyed the support of the deep dragon Pharx, Liriel enlisted the aid of ZzPzora. The deep dragon followed her friend through a portal to Skullport, where she seduced Pharx to distract him from aiding the mercenaries in battle. While Liriel and her allies fought the Dragons Hoard, ZzPzora had sex with Pharx, before suddenly attacking him with the help of the Rashemen berserker Fyodor. Together, the two were able to kill the much larger Pharx, but ZzPzora died shortly after from the injuries she had sustained."
