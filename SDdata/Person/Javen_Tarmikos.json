        "mainbody": "aven Tarmikos was the paladin of Helm who founded and led the Order of the Gilded Eye in the late 15 century DR.\nJaven believed that evil forces should be actively sought and destroyed before they have any opportunity to inflict harm upon others.\nAs zealous as he was, Javen was not above aligning himself with what he perceived as a lesser evil, in order to defeat something greater and potentially more harmful to the Realms.\nJaven focused his holy skills in manner that best allowed him to protect others and smite down evil beings.\nHe had a strong ally in Sir Banagar, a fellow devout knight of Helm.\nFor some time Javen served as a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, the group of holy warriors who dedicated themselves to fighting evil along the Sword Coast and within the North. However he became deeply troubled following the invasion of Helms Hold by Ashmadai and the Prophet Rohini, a succubus who masqueraded as a devoted oracle of Helm. While Javen helped liberate his home city during the Siege of Helms Hold, circa the , the atrocities he witnessed left him increasingly disillusioned with the Order.\nIn either Nightal 1486 or Hammer 1487 DR, Javen was meditating at the Cathedral of Helm when he received a vision upon Helms holy symbol within the church the unblinking eye of Helm began to weep golden tears. His divine vision was soon followed by others that presented themselves to Javens fellow clergy members. Inspired by the return of the Watcher, Javen formed Order of the Gilded Eye, holy warriors of Helm that would protect the Realms where the Order of the Gauntlet previously failed.\nCirca 1487 DR, Javen and a band of Gilded Eye knights ventured out to destroy the last remnants of the Order of the Burning Dawn adventuring guild. Javen believed that one of their members Soronil Noonshadow was an agent of the balor Belaphoss, and thus the entire guild should be eradicated."
