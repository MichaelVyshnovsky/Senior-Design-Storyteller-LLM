Senityili was a sahuagin priestess of Sekolah in the City of Caverns, among the Sea of Swords.
The cleric was dedicated to Sekolah, deity of sharks. She believed that a group of outsiders would aid the city, and thus treated them with far more respect than the rest of her kin.
She fought with a standard spear and knew an array of divine spells, the most powerful of which were blade barrier and slay living.
Senityili lived in the City of Caverns. During the civil war in the city, she appeared to support King Ixilthetocal. Senityili believed in an old prophecy that told of the arrival of a stranger who would save the city.
