Zahara the Shark was an famous swashbuckler-thief folk hero captain of a small privateer fleet on the Sword Coast called Zaharas Krakens in the mid-14 century DR.
Zahara was a nimble and quick-witted woman.
Zahara wore enchanted jewelry â€“ a powerful pair of earrings of protection and a pair of winged boots. She weeded a magic +2 sabre into battle.
In the mid-14 century DR, Zahara the Sharks ships made a living by protecting merchant ships traveling across the Sword Coast and raiding pirate ships as well as an occasional port in Tethyr, always keeping chaos and destruction to the minimum.
