'''Sardok''' was a thief helping the wizard [[Trifakas]] in his quest for [[Martek]]'s sphere of power. Together with the wizard, they became stuck in the [[Garden of the Cursed]] until other adventurers arrived.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|110}}

==Abilities==
Sardok's constitution was outstanding; he also had excellent dexterity and optimal intelligence for a wizard, though he was a thief.

==Personality==
The thief was cruel, cunning, and usually rude.

==Relationships==
Sardok truly believed Trifakas was going to get them out of the Tomb, and he was more loyal to him than [[Pawnis]] was.

==History==
The drow had arrived together with Trifakas and Sardok about one week before the adventurers who ultimately resurrected [[Martek]] did. He and Sardok were the last of Trifakas' band; the wizard decided to pose as an emissary of Grandal to the Guilders who lived there.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|108}} Sardok and Trifakas decided to live in a hut away from the Guilders.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|116}} The three discovered they were trapped soon after; when new adventurers came bearing every [[Star Gem of Martek]], the thief helped investigate these new arrivals.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|109}}

If Trifakas' band managed to acquire the Star Gems, they may have proceeded with the trials of Martek.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|111}} In such a case, they may have been found dead by the entrance of Martek's treasury.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|126}}
