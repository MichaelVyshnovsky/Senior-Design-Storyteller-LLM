Wormblod was the chieftain of the Great Worm Tribe sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Wormblod led a group of his berserkers, an enslaved white dragon, and a shaman to try to break inside the Eye of the All-Father temple with the objective of find a missing member of the tribe, Noori. In truth, Wormblod only wanted the treasures inside.
Wormblod only occasionally led his warriors to defend their territory. However, every time he acted he wanted war and treasure.
