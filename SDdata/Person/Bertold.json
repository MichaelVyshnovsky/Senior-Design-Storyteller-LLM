        "mainbody": "Bertold the Seeker was a paladin of Torm, god of duty.\nAccording to legend, Bertold embarked on the traditional quest to rediscover the lost kingdom of Chalsembyr, the realm of the once-mortal Torm. To aid him in this endeavor, clerics of the House of the Hand temple in Procampur, the Vast, forged Chalsembyrs Heart. Bertold carried the sword with him on his journeys.\nFinally, while crossing the Toadsquat Mountains of the southeastern Shaar, Bertold was ambushed by ogres and slain. He was unaware of his swords soul binding power, however, and rather than go to the House of the Triad, Bertolds soul went into Chalsembyrs Heart, becoming an intelligent weapon.\nThere he would remain until another found and claimed the sword, to become the beneficiary of Bertolds knowledge and experience. However, the sword was lost after Bertolds death and not found by 1374 DR. Many paladins of Torm sought it around Faer√ªn. The legend told that if another paladin wielded Chalsembyrs Heart and died, then their soul would also go into the sword, freeing Bertold to finally ascend to the afterlife.\nAmong paladins, Bertold was particularly devout in his faith and possessed of great dedication and unselfishness. As the sword Chalsembyrs Heart, Bertold the Seeker was a wise and charismatic soul.\nBertold, in sword-form, was knowledgeable in history with regards to Chalsembyr and in deciphering ancient and obscured writings."
