        "mainbody": "Kith'rak '''Therezzyn''' was a [[githyanki]] that served her people as commander of [[Crèche Y'llek]], on the planet of [[Toril]] during the 15{{th}} century of the [[Calendar of Harptos|Faerûnian calendar]].\n\n{{Quote|The latest batch of cultists knew nothing of the Astral Prism. They were just trying to find Moonrise. They all head there - my gish have drafted plans to assault the tower. They are ready to fight, ch'r'ai.|Therezzyn, to Ch'r'ai [[W'wargaz]].}}",
        "Description": "Therezzyn had auburn hair and distinct facial markings that were not uncommon among the githyanki. She had a long scar running across her right eye, which was clouded over.\n\nShe dressed in typical [[githyanki half-plate]] armor, adorned with a flowing red cape. She wore a slender diadem across her brow and had several rings that pierced her long, pointed ears.",
        "Personality": "As befitting a member of githyanki military hierarchy, Therezzyn was demanding of her subordinates and appropriately deferent to her superiors.",
        "Possessions": "She wielded a ''[[soulbreaker greatsword]]'', a potent gith weapon that whispered into the mind of its wielder with the voices of the dead it had slain.\n\nShe also held in her possession a ''[[githyanki shard]]'', a device that opened certain protective shields within the crèche.",
        "Activities": "After [[Rosymorn Monastery]] had been taken over by by the gith forces led by M'lar [[Rih'al]], Kith'rak Therezzyn took over as commander of operations the newly-founded Crèche Y'llek.",
        "Relationships": "She had two pet [[wolves]], which she named [[Ur'uth]] and [[D'hak]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the function of Crèche Y'llek was repurposed as the githyanki war against the [[mind flayer]]s in [[Faerûn]] shifted in balance. Ch'r'ai [[W'wargaz]] arrived at the crèche, leading the inquisition in pursuit of the ''[[Astral Prism]]'', a device that imprisoned [[Orpheus]], the long-lost son of [[Gith]]. Therezzyn directed her forces at Y'llek to find the prism at once, in service to their queen [[Vlaakith CLVII]]."
