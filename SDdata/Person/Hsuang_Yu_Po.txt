'''Hsuang Yu Po''' was a noble and general of [[Shou Lung]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Hsuang was a noble and a general in the province of [[Chukei]]. There, he raised alone his daughter [[Hsuang Yu Wu]], who inherited most of his qualities.

Around {{YearlinkConvert|2598|SY}}, Wu fell in love with [[Batu Min Ho]], a soldier of [[Tuigan]] ancestry in Hsuang's private army. Hsuang opposed the marriage, hoping for a more suitable man for the daughter of a noble. Hsuang said that he would agree only when Batu became a general in Shou Lung. This was supposed to be a joke but Batu joined the Shou army and rose through the ranks, becoming one of the youngest generals of Shou Lung. Impressed, Hsuang agreed to the marriage and developed a true respect for the military abilities of his son-in-law.

In {{YearlinkConvert|2609|SY}}, when Emperor [[Kai Tsao Shou Chin]] and the Minister of State [[Ju-Hai Chou]] asked Hsuang's opinion if Batu would be the right man to defeat the [[Tuigan Horde]] invasion, he guaranteed he was.

When Batu was put in charge of the campaign against the Tuigan, Hsuang was chosen to lead the personal armies of the nobles, the [[Twenty-Five Armies]].

Batu and Hsuang devised a secret plan to defeat the Tuigan near the city of [[Shu Kuan]]. However, during the fighting, the rebellious tendencies of General [[Kei Bot Li]] and two other generals permitted the Tuigan to totally destroy the Twenty-Five Armies. Hsuang was killed and his head put at the entrance of the tent of [[Yamun Khahan]], which Batu later saw when he went to discuss with the Tuigan spokesman [[Koja]].
