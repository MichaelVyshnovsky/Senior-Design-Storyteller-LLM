'''Bruldenthar''' was a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] sage in [[Mirabar]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Bruldenthar was chosen among many others as part of a diplomatic delegation, but at [[Beliard]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] they were ambushed by the [[Cult of the Black Earth]]. Bruldenthar was captured and transported beyond the [[River Dessarin]]. There, in the [[Sumber Hills]], they were attacked by the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]], which killed many earth cultists and prisoners and captured [[Deseyna Norvael]], another member of the delegation.

Bruldenthar remained a prisoner of the Black Earth; he and two other diplomat prisoners, [[Rhundorth]] and [[Teresiel]], were transported to the [[Sacred Stone Monastery]]. There, he was put to work in a subterranean mine with many other prisoners from others raids, but the diplomats were soon after put in another place. At last, some adventurers hired to find the missing delegation infiltrated the monastery and freed Brudelnthar and many other prisoners.
