        "mainbody": "Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari was a noble marid and the Great Padishah of the Marid in 1367 DR, who ruled her subjects from her court in the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls on the Elemental Plane of Water.\nDifferent descriptions gave Kalbari two alternate appearances, either with skin of darkest black and hair of corraline red piled up in the shape of a turban, or skin of shimmering white with black hair. She usually wore golden, silver, or blue-coloured robes, which gave hints of even richer garments beneath.\nThe Great Padishah Kalbari was both whimsical and shrewd, conscious of political maneuverings and the sensitivities of her subjects, and displayed generosity and honorable behavior. She was fond of flattery and beautiful gifts, and loved to demonstrate her power over the watery element to visitors. She preferred to leave her court only rarely.\nThe Great Padishah managed her ruling position with great political skill and preserved a sense of unity among the divergent marids both through manipulation and exemplary behavior. Great marine events like the migration of whales were among the few occasions when Kalbari left the Citadel, taking all of her court with her. When she traveled to the Prime Material Plane, her appearance was marked by torrential rainstorms, terrifying waves, and waterspouts. Next to marids, she kept a variety of sea creatures and aquatic tribes in her retinue, as well as interesting storytellers, adventurers, and the occasional shair."
