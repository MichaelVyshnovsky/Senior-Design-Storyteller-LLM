'''Caladnei''' ({{Pronounce|kah|LAD|nay|refs= Caladnei was also the leader of the famed [[War Wizards]].

==Description==
She had a tall and slender frame, with red hair and eyes the color of gold.

==Possessions==
Among Caladnei's possessions were a +2 [[longsword]], a [[ring of protection]] +2, a minor [[cloak of displacement]], [[winged boots]], and a [[brooch of shielding]].

==Activities==
Caladnei was the only Mage Royal of Cormyr that was not descended from [[Baerauble Etharr]] and [[Alea Dahast]].

==Abilities==
She trained her fighting skills in [[Waterdeep]], dueled with [[wizard]]s in [[Halruaa]], and even learned forging skills with the [[gold dwarves]] of the [[Great Rift]]. 

==Relationships==
Caladnei was regarded as Vangerdahast's favorite aid. Rumors circulated that the two were even lovers.

==History==
Raised in [[Turmish]] by her Cormyrian father and Turmian mother, Caladnei had traveled throughout [[Faerûn]] in her youth, often via portals. When Caladnei's mother died in a storm at sea, her father took ill, and she returned to care for him. She began supporting herself as a mercenary and crafter of minor magical items. It was around this time that she attracted the attention of Vangerdahast and began the path to her position as Royal Mage.

After the [[Netheril|Netherese]] city of [[Thultanthar]] returned to [[Faerûn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the city's [[Shadovar]] residents emerged as a threat to [[Cormyr]] and the surrounding [[Eastern Heartlands|Heartlands]]. In [[Mirtul]] of that year, Caladnei and Hhormun led a contingent of [[Purple Dragons]] in [[Anauroch]] near the [[Shadow Sea]] to scout out the location of the Shadovar city. Masquerading amidst a tribe of [[Bedine]] nomads, the group inadvertently drew the attention of the Shadovar when Sheikh [[Sa'ar]] and their [[Bait Mahwa]] hosts decided to steal a group of the shade's [[veserab]] mounts. This skirmish was one of the opening acts of outward aggression between the Shadovar and the Heartlands.

Later that month when [[Tilverton]] was on the brink of destruction by the hands of Prince [[Rivalen Tanthul]], Vangerdahast directed Caladnei to help evacuate the remaining Cormyreans from the city. While Tilverton was destroyed and much of the Cormyrean army killed, Vangerdahast survived a battle of wits and spells with the Shadovar Prince, much to Caladnei's great relief.

In [[1399 DR]], Caladnei was ravaged by the expanding [[Spellplague]] while in a heavily-warded spellcasting chamber known as the Dragonskull Chamber. The room's wards were warped so that anyone with spellcasting ability couldn't approach without becoming violently ill. For this reason, it was ordered abandoned.
