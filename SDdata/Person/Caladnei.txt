Caladnei (, the citys Shadovar residents emerged as a threat to Cormyr and the surrounding Heartlands. In Mirtul of that year, Caladnei and Hhormun led a contingent of Purple Dragons in Anauroch near the Shadow Sea to scout out the location of the Shadovar city. Masquerading amidst a tribe of Bedine nomads, the group inadvertently drew the attention of the Shadovar when Sheikh Saar and their Bait Mahwa hosts decided to steal a group of the shades veserab mounts. This skirmish was one of the opening acts of outward aggression between the Shadovar and the Heartlands.
Later that month when Tilverton was on the brink of destruction by the hands of Prince Rivalen Tanthul, Vangerdahast directed Caladnei to help evacuate the remaining Cormyreans from the city. While Tilverton was destroyed and much of the Cormyrean army killed, Vangerdahast survived a battle of wits and spells with the Shadovar Prince, much to Caladneis great relief.
In 1399 DR, Caladnei was ravaged by the expanding Spellplague while in a heavily-warded spellcasting chamber known as the Dragonskull Chamber. The rooms wards were warped so that anyone with spellcasting ability couldnt approach without becoming violently ill. For this reason, it was ordered abandoned.
