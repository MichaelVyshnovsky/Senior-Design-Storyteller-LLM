        "History": "Artoth Frayhammer's final resting place was the biggest crypt within the dwarven tomb complex in the lowest level of the [[Elven Catacombs]] of Myth Drannor. The entrance to the tombs was indicated by a sign, engraved in languages of dwarves, humans, and elves, that read \"Last Repose of the Stout Folk of Myth Drannor\". These tombs were protected by [[iron golem|dwarven statues]] and the spirits of its inhabitants that were ready to destroy anyone who tried to claim the enchanted arms laid within the tombs, without paying the levy first."
