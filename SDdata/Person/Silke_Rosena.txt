'''Silke Rosena''' was a talented musician and entertainer living in [[Beregost]] as of the late 1360s [[DR]].

{{Quote|''"Greetings, mercenaries. I am Silke, thespian extraordinaire"''}}

==Activities==
She was a musician in Beregost but she usually used her talents to manipulate others into doing her will.

==Relationships==
Silke had a lover and "fiance" in her fellow entertainer and [[bard]], [[Garrick]].

==History==
At one point in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, she tricked [[Glayde]], [[Faltis]], and [[Tessilan]] in a deal that favored herself over them. They realized she had cheated them and began searching for her throughout the city. While she and Garrick stayed at [[Feldepost's Inn]], she hoped to hire some [[adventurer]]s to deal with the men she had cheated.

A book of ballads, silly titled ''[[Sword Coast Songbook]]'', compiled by Silke Rosena, was found in rotation ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Its copies were available in the city [[Baldur's Gate]].
