'''Elenshaer''' was a mage of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
The elf was slender.

==Personality==
He was rather arrogant.

==Abilities==
He had done some spellcraft work, much of it on unusual wardings; his penmanship was recognizable.

==Relationships==
He was an acquaintance of [[Elminster Aumar]].

==History==
Elenshaer had been seen at some point by Elminster, carrying a fluted glass, on some terrace. He died at some point afterwards, being slain by a [[phaerimm]] he had caged in spells that were too weak.

In the {{yearlinkName|761}}, Elenshaer's notes on a spell that added more power to an existing spell, with the purpose of putting it under the control of the caster, was discovered and recognized by Elminster at [[Moonshorn Tower]]. While investigating those notes, he discovered a mystical sign, bidding him to seek the [[Riven Stone]] immediately.
