{{Quote|But neither can we ignore our pact with the [[Qahtan]]. We swore that their enemies were ours.|Nata, speaking about the invading [[Zhentarim]] army.}}

==Description==
Nata was a well-built man who moved with purpose and resolve. He was a no-nonsense individual that regularly wore a dour expression upon his face.

==Personality==
Nata was a man that believed in honoring any pacts that he or his people made, regardless of possible dangers.

==Relationships==
He had at least one son, who was also a warrior of the tribe.

==History==
Nata was present at the negotiations conducted by Sheikh [[Sabkhat]] and [[Zarud]] of the Zhentarim, a meeting that occurred in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}.
 When the Zhentarim agent was slain that very night, Nata and his son caught the [[sorceress]] [[Ruha]]a attempting to flee the Mtairi camp.
