'''Luranla Dreer''' was a [[human]] waitress at the [[Yawning Portal]] inn in [[Waterdeep]] in the early to late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref group="note">Luranla appears in "The Keeper of Secrets" (2004) and ''Expedition to Undermountain'' (2007) and is undoubtedly intended to be the same character and implied to be young and a junior employee. However, 36 years separates the dates of these appearances, so it is unknown how she has neither aged nor earned a promotion or made any other advancement. It is possible there is a magical explanation, given the proximity of Undermountain. Or perhaps she really is a dragon.
{{quote|Nay, nay. 'Tis free—of my making, and Durnan's compliments. We like to treat friends well here, lord of the waves.|Luranla keeping a customer happy.}}
 
==Activities==
She worked as the junior waitress and kitchen maid, though she would rather be known as a barmaid, and she sometimes worked the bar when the owner [[Durnan]] was out. She also made [[cheese]]s.
 
==History==
Luranla was an orphan from the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of Waterdeep, who lived on the streets until Durnan hired her.

She was working at the Yawning Portal on the night of the [[Revel of Storms]] in the {{YearlinkName|1339}}, when a patron, [[Yelver Toraunt]], was murdered and the killer escaped. When a sailor got upset at hearing how Durnan disposed of bodies in the inn—by dropping them down a chute to be noisily devoured by a monster—Durnan quelled the man and Luranla served him a tankard of [[Black Sail]] and a complimentary seed-spiced [[cheese]], mollifying him with her flirtatious charm. Durnan left her in charge of the bar when he departed with [[Mirt]] to investigate Yelver's death. Later, after meeting not one but two [[dragon]]s in human form and learning of many more in the City of Splendors, Durnan and Mirt joked that Luranla too might be a dragon in disguise and Durnan feared to ask her.

She was still working at the Yawning Portal as of [[Eleint 30]] in the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, when [[Halaster's Call]] drew many [[adventurer]]s to the Yawning Portal seeking access to [[Undermountain]].<ref>

Glad to have a roof over her head, Luranla was determined to satisfy Durnan and his family in order to keep her job. She also tried to act tough and in control toward all the customers. She had a sharp-tongued manner but very flirty ways and was quick to get into a fight to settle any trouble.

==Description==
Luranla had a beautiful full figure with distinctive black eyebrows and a great long mane of bright blue-black hair. Extensive dark [[tattoo]]s covered her body, shoulders, and sides, so tangled that the distracted and confused the eye. Her voice was deep, described as smoky and husky. She commonly worked in only baggy [[breeches]], [[boots]], and an [[apron]] that was full-fronted but sleeveless so as to show off her tattoos. Sometimes she forwent the apron to show off rather more than her tattoos.
