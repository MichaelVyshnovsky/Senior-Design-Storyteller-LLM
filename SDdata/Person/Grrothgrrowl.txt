'''King Grrothgrrowl''' was the most powerful [[wemic]] king of the [[Shining Plains]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Grrothgrrowl was an impressive man. He was huge, bigger than an average wemic, towering over other humanoids at {{SI|7'|'"|long=yes}}.

==Personality==
The king of the Tenpaws cared very little for [[human]]s, and if they lived outside his territory he was uninterested. Grrothgrrowl required caravans from east and west to pay tribute. He considered the Emerald Enclave a powerful ally but he did not care for the their ideas.

==Possessions==
He wielded an [[enchanted]] ''+3 [[warhammer]]'' and a magical ''+3 [[shield]]'' in battle.

==Activities==
Grrothgrrowl ruled the [[Tenpaw]] tribe, which comprised more than 12,000 members. He managed to command this many thanks to eight chieftains as assistants and an [[Emerald Enclave]] advisor, who provided intelligence information.

==History==
King Grrothgrrowl fathered a son in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR. The birth happened shortly before the visit of [[Adamar Session]], [[Bard]] of [[Starmantle]], during his twelve-year adventuring trek across the [[Vilhon Reach]]. The bard attended the annual remembrance vigil held at the [[Hill of Memories]] in the Shining Plains and witnessed several individuals, including a member of the [[Emerald Enclave]] congratulating Grrothgrrowl with [[Thrrothgrrowl]]'s birth. Adamar Session wrote about the wemic prince in his guide to Vilhon Reach and speculated that at the time of writing, Thrrothgrrowl was likely an adult.
