King Grrothgrrowl was the most powerful wemic king of the Shining Plains as of the late 14 century DR.
Grrothgrrowl was an impressive man. He was huge, bigger than an average wemic, towering over other humanoids at .
The king of the Tenpaws cared very little for humans, and if they lived outside his territory he was uninterested. Grrothgrrowl required caravans from east and west to pay tribute. He considered the Emerald Enclave a powerful ally but he did not care for the their ideas.
He wielded an enchanted +3 warhammer and a magical +3 shield in battle.
Grrothgrrowl ruled the Tenpaw tribe, which comprised more than 12,000 members. He managed to command this many thanks to eight chieftains as assistants and an Emerald Enclave advisor, who provided intelligence information.
King Grrothgrrowl fathered a son in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. The birth happened shortly before the visit of Adamar Session, Bard of Starmantle, during his twelve-year adventuring trek across the Vilhon Reach. The bard attended the annual remembrance vigil held at the Hill of Memories in the Shining Plains and witnessed several individuals, including a member of the Emerald Enclave congratulating Grrothgrrowl with Thrrothgrrowls birth. Adamar Session wrote about the wemic prince in his guide to Vilhon Reach and speculated that at the time of writing, Thrrothgrrowl was likely an adult.
