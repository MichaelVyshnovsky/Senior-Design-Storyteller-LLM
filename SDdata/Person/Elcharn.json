        "mainbody": "Human\nElcharn was a minor noble from the Harvestshield Mountain region in the Sword Coast North. As of the late 15 century DR, he had become a wight and resided in the Heartcoil Deeps.\nElcharn was a foolish and prideful thrill-seeking braggart. He was known to be willing to do anything to win, and moreover, to do anything to avoid disappointing his beloved partner, Cielaro.While the exact relationship between Elcharn and Cielaro is not specified in Warriors of Waterdeep, it is strongly implied that they were romantic partners. Elcharn and Cielaro were known to cause small scandals in their noble circles because they preferred to hunt monsters than attend banquets.\nElcharn was known as a skilled swordsman, and was famous for his distinctive flourishes. His attacks could be recognized by the damage he left behind on his enemies armor.\nElcharn and Cielaro were enamored with the legends of Bellorath, a rebel who was driven from Chaunteas Citadel atop Harvestshield Mountain and disappeared into the Heartcoil Deeps. The two of them believed a theory that Bellorath had sought out fiendish power after being exiled, and they became obsessed with discovering what had happened to him. Thus, the two of them travelled to the Heartcoil Deeps, but were never seen again on the surface.\nThe two of them explored much of the Deeps, even managing to get all the way into the territory of the reclusive stone giant clan who dwelt in its deepest depths. As they went, Elcharn sketched a map while Cielaro recorded their experiences in her journals. Eventually, they succeeded in their mission to find Bellorath, but discovered that they were correct about his mission for fiendish power Bellorath had transformed into a minotaur, and clashed with the two nobles. After their last battle with him, Elcharn and Cielaro became separated.\nElcharn refused to give up on finding Cierlaro, but when he did, he despaired upon discovering that she had been transformed into a vampire spawn. However, in his grief and pride, he refused to accept that he could not cure her, or failing that, at least find a way to still be with her.\nHis fate remained a mystery until the late 15 century DR, when he was encountered by a group of adventurers exploring the Heartcoil Deeps in the service of Laeral Silverhand. The adventurers discovered that he had been separated from Cielaro and transformed into a wight, although he retained his sword skills. Upon slaying him, the adventurers discovered a pair of jagged scars on his neck, but were unable to determine what exactly had happened to him."
