Her Highness Princess Cyriana Raisa Marela Vajra Eralea Rhindaun was the second daughter and third child of Queen Zaranda Star and King Haedrak Rhindaun III of Tethyr. Officially, she was the Princess of Ankramir and the third heir to the throne.
One of a set of triplets, Cyriana was unique among the royal children in that she had golden eyes. For this she was seen by the Queens Minister, Lady Harlaa Assumbar, priestess of Siamorphe, as sacred to her goddess and destined to be a great prophetess.
Princess Cyrianas regent was Vajra Valmeyjar, Duchess of Ankaram.
Cyriana and her two siblings were born in the month of Flamerule in 1370 DR. This was the first time there had been royal triplets in Tethyr since the reign of Queen Alisande Bormul in 832 DR.
Several organizations had made plans to kidnap the princess, because of her golden eyes. The church of Cyric in Amn and the Banites following Iyachtu Xvim in Mintar were two such groups. In each case, there were prophecies of their downfall being caused by a golden-eyed child.
