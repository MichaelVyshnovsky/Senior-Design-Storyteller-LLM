        "mainbody": "'''Ysele the Cat''' was a businesswoman and [[sorceress]] who lived in [[Skullport]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "She was said to have sharp, almost [[cat|feline]] features, which contributed to her nickname.",
        "Personality": "Ysele was a persuasive and manipulative woman, confident in her abilities and unafraid to use sex appeal to get what she wanted.",
        "Possessions": "Ysele had rings of ''[[Ring of protection|protection]]'', ''[[Ring of invisibility|invisibility]]'' and ''[[Ring of human influence|human influence]]'' (usually on a [[silver]] chain around her neck), and wore ''[[boots of elvenkind]]''. She made use of a ''[[wand of paralyzation]]'' and a ''[[rod of passage]]'', and also possessed a ''[[crystal ball]]'' and a ''[[talisman of the spheres]]''.",
        "Activities": "Along with [[Aurin|Aurin the Generous]], [[Chantos Graybeard]], and Lord [[Ithvar Wordkiller]], she was one of four co-owners of [[Hired Horrors]], a business in Skullport which sold [[deepspawn]] to wealthy clients all across [[Toril]]. She loathed the deepspawn themselves, but loved that she had become fabulously wealthy from the enterprise.",
        "Relationships": "Ysele cared little for others, and schemed to eliminate her business partners in order to seize control of Hired Horrors for herself. She conspired alongside Ithvar to drive a wedge between Aurin and Chantos, but fully intended to elimiate all three one-by-one.",
        "History": "Ysele hailed from [[Tethyr]], where her human father taught her [[magic]]. In adolescence, she grew bored of her father's caution and convinced him to hire a more talented [[wizard]] as her instructor, but soon after, the tutor expelled Ysele for stealing some [[spellbook]]s. After that, Ysele contacted a [[lower planes]] creature and organized her father's assassination. After her father's death, she sold all his holdings to a rival of her father in a prearranged deal and left the country.\n\n''Circa'' [[1350 DR]], she hired some thugs to attack her in Skullport so that she could kill them in order to attract the attention of Aurin and Chantos, who (as expected) offered her a chance to buy-in to their new business idea of breeding deepspawn. However, Ysele grew frustrated that she could not manipulate Aurin and Chantos because of their mutual friendship. At last, in {{Yearlink|1370}}, with the help of Ithvar, Ysele succeeded in creating a rift between Aurin and Chantos and began making progress with her plan to become the only owner of the Hired Horrors. she secretly acquired a ''talisman of the sphere'' to take control of it for herself.\n\nBy mid&ndash;{{Yearlink|1372}}, Ysele was no longer affiliated with Hired Horrors, although she remained active in Skullport."
