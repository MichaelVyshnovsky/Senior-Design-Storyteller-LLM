        "mainbody": "'''Kathra Shallowtaint''' was a rowdy [[elf|elven]] adventuring [[mage]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "At age 127, Kathra was a wizard of some power, but her reputation came from her wild partying and copious alcohol consumption. When she was around her elven kin, Kathra routinely drank entire bars worth of [[feywine]] and still remained alert, able to gamble and win many a [[coin]]. As a wizard, Kathra was cocky and held no respect for elders and sages, be they elves, [[human]], or any other race. One notable incident took place on the [[Road to the Dawn]]. The elven spell-slinger came across an aging sage and held him at a [[dagger]]point, demanding him to teach her everything he knew about philosophy by the first light of the morning sun.\n\nSometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, Kathra Shallowtaint was among [[adventurer]]s interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally mysterious magical ''orb'' from its depths."
