        "mainbody": "hocius Green was the owner and the barkeep of the Hidden Lady in Suzail in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nPhocius Green was a portly, balding man.\nLike many others in his profession, Phocius was a loud, cheerful man, full of boisterous attitude. He eagerly greeted adventurers because they often were swollen with gold.\nIn 1357 DR, a hero from Westgate named Alias was found unconscious on the Hidden Ladys stoop with a bag of gold and trinkets by one of the inns regulars, Mitcher Trollslayer. Even though Mitcher was claiming the woman was one of the Witches of Rashemen, the innkeeper was kind enough to leave the woman in one of the rooms for three days until she woke up with no memories of the recent events. Hell of a hangover, Phocius Green thought. The bag of gold was used as payment for the inns services. Alias found her sword arm adorned with a mysterious magical azure tattoo. Another guest of the inn, Akabar Bel Akash, attempted to use magic on the swordswoman it led to the azure bonds magical defenses to explode in magical light, fires, and strobing rays, shocking and scaring the customers and Phocius Green himself.\nHe was later interviewed by King Azoun Obarskyr IV and Vangerdahast Aeiulvana in order to find Alias after her attacking Giogioni Wyvernspur at a wedding banquet. Phocius felt protective of the woman, thinking her to be the hidden lady, the inns symbolic namesake. He tried to mislead the king giving him what he thought to be an incorrect intel accidentally reveling Alias true destination - Yulash."
