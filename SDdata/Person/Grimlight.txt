Grimlight was a behir who lived in a cave near a gorge situated near the Cold Vale. He was a large, clever and vicious behir, well known for his tastes for dwarf flesh and gold.
It was defeated on Tarsakh 6, 1374 DR, by the reformed Company of the White Star when they entered the cave looking for a telkiira.
