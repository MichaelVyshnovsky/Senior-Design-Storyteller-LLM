Jharakphred was a painter in Suzail during the late 15 century.
He was runty.
Jharakphred was nervous, whimpering and simpering.
The man was perhaps the best painter-for-hire in Suzail.
He was a painter for hire.
Jharakphred was hired by Marlin Stormserpent to paint the likenesses of Draskos Crownsilver and Gariskar Dauntinghorn, whom the painter followed for days until their retinues beat him away. He then painted their likenesses and brought them to Marlin. After being paid, he was quickly skewered by two blueflame ghosts, Relve Langral and Treth Halonter, who threw his body into a furnace, again, on Marlins orders.
