        "History": "Yousouf plied his trade as an adventurer, but decided to retire after a particularly ill-fated expedition. He lost his shield-hand to an [[ogre]]'s blade, had half of his intestines eaten by a [[mountain lion]] while lying atop a glacier waiting for death, and then suffered [[Frostbite (condition)|frostbite]] on most of his toes as he was dragged to [[Yeoman's Loft]] by his rescuers.\n\nHis friend [[Ihre]] came to his aid and used healing magic to save his life, but was only partially successful in curing his many wounds. Although Yousouf survived, his toes had to be amputated to avoid [[gangrene]]. Yousouf decided to quit the adventuring business while he still lived, and went on to run [[Yousouf's Grocery]] in Karsus Enclave."
