Gamorst was the leader of the Tribunal of Evernight as of the late 15 century DR.
As a member of the Tribunal, he was a powerful ghoul and a follower of Orcus.
Gamorst was succinct and impatient. He immediately demanded tribute in exchange for the Tribunals time, and he allowed for no interference in their decisions.
He had the ability to destroy even a lich with a mere point of his finger.
As of the late 15 century DR, the undead residents of Evernight held Gamorst responsible for the unpopular rule that allowed the Tribunal to extend their protection to mortal visitors to the city.
When the lich Zarifrax attempted to slay a mortal to whom Gamorst had extended the Tribunals protection, Gamorst swiftly destroyed him and claimed his phylactery.
