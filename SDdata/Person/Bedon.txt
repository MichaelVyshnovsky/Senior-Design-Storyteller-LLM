'''Bedon''' was a [[human]] [[cleric]] and [[monk]] of [[Ilmater]] and the leader of the [[Monastery of St. Fanal]] in the [[Alimir Mountains]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

Brother Bedon instated a policy that no one who came to the monastery seeking knowledge could be denied. However, he made a special effort to assist all visitors that were dedicated to peace and goodness. He saw his role at the monastery, dedicated to the preservation and teaching of history, as a means to quell strife around [[Calimshan]] and the [[Lake of Steam (region)|Lake of Steam]].
