Bedon was a human cleric and monk of Ilmater and the leader of the Monastery of St. Fanal in the Alimir Mountains circa 1374 DR.
Brother Bedon instated a policy that no one who came to the monastery seeking knowledge could be denied. However, he made a special effort to assist all visitors that were dedicated to peace and goodness. He saw his role at the monastery, dedicated to the preservation and teaching of history, as a means to quell strife around Calimshan and the Lake of Steam.
