Malavos Drunn was a retired warrior and the barkeep of the Horn and Hoof tavern in Longsaddle in the mid-1360s DR. He fenced stolen goods, with enough skill to not draw any unnecessary attention.
Drunn carried a cudgel and a wand of magic missiles, which he used to keep order within his establishment.
