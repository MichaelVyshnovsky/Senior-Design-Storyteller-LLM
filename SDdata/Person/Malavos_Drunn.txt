'''Malavos Drunn''' was a retired warrior and the barkeep of [[the Horn and Hoof]] tavern in [[Longsaddle]] in the mid-1360s [[DR]]. He fenced stolen goods, with enough skill to not draw any unnecessary attention.

==Possessions==
Drunn carried a [[cudgel]] and a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]'', which he used to keep order within his establishment.
