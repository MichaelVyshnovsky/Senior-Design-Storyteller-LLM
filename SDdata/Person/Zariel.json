        "mainbody": "Zariel never forgot those who deserted the battlefield during her failed invasion of Avernus and had long been waiting to exact her revenge. Such an opportunity arose in the {{YearlinkName|1444}}, when a [[vampire]] lord conquered the city of Elturel and a [[Torm]]ite priest by the name of [[Thavius Kreeg]] called out to any power to save his city, a call answered by the Lord of Avernus. The instant his plea was made, Zariel emerged from a pillar of fire, offering him a deal he readily accepted. Zariel gave Thavius a tool known as the [[Solar Insidiator]], more commonly known as the Companion, a glowing sphere as radiant as the sun that bathed Elturel in holy light, destroying the vampire lord's army and sending him back to the shadows.\n\nThavius took credit for the appearance of the Companion and was hailed as a savior, rising to become the High Overseer under which the holy nation of [[Elturgard]] blossomed. The price for this salvation however was later damnation, as well Thavius knew. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} after politically conspiring to weaken the neighboring city of [[Baldur's Gate]] and ensure his own safety, Thavius watched from a safe distance as the radiant sun Zariel had provided transformed into a black orb crackling with lightning. The Solar Insidiator ripped Elturel from the Material Plane and transported it and its inhabitants (all previously made to swear an oath to protect it by Kreeg and therefore included in the deal with the city itself) directly into Avernus, leaving only a crater behind.\n\nEven after damning an entire city, Zariel's ultimate plan had not yet come to fruition. Elturel was simply one in a list of cities she planned to drag down to the Hells, as beyond her desire for vengeance she had the pragmatic intent to use the citizens as fodder in her prosecution of the Blood War. She had already made a deal with her devout disciple [[Thalamra Vanthampur]], whereby the current rulership of her next target, Baldur's Gate, would fall and she would become the Grand Duke, paving the way for the fall of that metropolis as well. Important to said plan was the [[Shield of the Hidden Lord]], the artifact in which Gargauth was trapped and which had contributed to the moral decay of Baldur's Gate for years and was going to be used by Thavius and Thalamra to doom the city in much the same way as the last.\n\nElturel and its devastated populace would have immediately fallen under Zariel's control if not for intensified attacks by demonic forces from the River Styx once it appeared, requiring Zariel's forces to focus on keeping them from overrunning it. Even so, the city was slowly and erratically being pulled down by chains into the Styx, whereupon, without outside intervention, it would permanently merge with the Nine Hells. Fortunately, a group of adventurers managed to save the city from total damnation, yet Zariel remained the Archduchess of Avernus even after Elturel was released from its chains and returned to the Material Plane, her moral fate unclear.<ref>\n\nOn a [[Founders' Day]] in the late 15{{th}} century, Zariel was summoned onto [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Field of Triumph]]. She, in turn, summoned a host of devils and bid them spread chaos in the city. Waterdeep briefly became a battlefield in the [[Blood War]], as demons were attracted by the sudden presence of devils. Zariel hoped that strong [[adventurer]]s would appear to defeat the fiendish invasion, and that she could lure or blackmail them into her service. A group of adventurers, commanded by [[Blackstaff]] [[Vajra Safahr]] to restore order to the city, was able to defeat Zariel and banish her back to the Nine Hells.",
        "Description": "Zariel's original form was that of a beautiful [[solar]] with flawless skin, gold-feathered wings, and a blindfold covering her eyes.\n\n[[File:Zariel's shadow.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Zariel's shadowy silhouette'']]\nAfter her descent, she took on a more diabolical appearance: a halo of fire burned atop her head, her once-fine skin was scorched, and her angelic wings, ruined by flame, turned leathery.",
        "Personality": {
            "Flaws": "{{fq\n| text   = Yeenoghu slaughtered those I swore to protect. I can stop him and others like him. I might have to give up all I stand for, but I could stem the tide of chaos and save many lives from the demonic terrors of the Abyss. Were you in my place, would you risk it all to save others?\n| source = A vision of Zariel from Lulu's memory\n| float  = right\n| width  = 400px\n}}\nZariel was notorious for her foul temper, with her poor emotional control impeding her ability to act rationally and pragmatically, as exemplified by her refusal to play politics. Her approach of charging headfirst into dangerous situations led by her righteous wrath was the opposite of the carefully calculating Bel. Zariel, despite her cynicism, was an idealist; she genuinely believed that a mere host of mortals would fare well in Avernus, only for a great number of them to flee from the [[fear]]-radiating [[fiend]]s.\n\nThe nature of Hell was to corrupt, and Avernus in particular specialized in the abuse of a flaw that frequently affected angels: hubris. Angels had a sense of infallibility about their actions, and Zariel's anger was only further inflamed by the righteousness with which she perceived it. [[Asmodeus]] praised her for the strength of her convictions, but it was her unswerving rage that had cemented her downfall.",
            "Hope": "[[File:Zariel_Ponders.png|thumb|left|250px|''Zariel confronting elements of her past.'']]\nZariel's pride and wrath had limits, and the burden of her duties weighed on her. Even as she prided herself as a cosmic martyr, she could still be made to feel pangs of shame for the atrocities she committed to reach where she was. Despite her flaws, her conviction in the overall righteousness of her actions was not invincible, and if properly confronted it was possible for the small sparks of good within her to emerge once more."
        },
        "Abilities": "[[File:Zariel_vs_Balor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Zariel taking on Yeenoghu's balor.'']]\nTogether with [[Geryon]], Zariel was among the archdevils best known for their unmatched martial prowess. Such was her power that she could best a [[balor]] in one-on-one combat and only needed a few seconds afterwards to collect herself.\n\nFollowing her fall, she was enhanced with fiendish powers, such as the typical archdevil ability to [[alter self|alter her form]]. In addition, many of her powers gained a distinct fire motif: she could create ''[[fireball]]s'' and ''[[wall of fire|walls of fire]]'' at will, her weapons seared with hellish flame, and her magical stare could cause spontaneous combustion. Zariel had instead the power to cast ''[[finger of death]]'' three times per day and was endowed with a horrid, poisoning touch that inflicted the same conditions that an angelic healing touch would reverse.\n\nZariel's fall had also come with undeniable drawbacks. She lacked the divine awareness that allowed all solars to detect lies, as well as their [[truesight]], instead possessing the devil power to see through magical darkness.",
        "Possessions": "While Zariel was still an [[angel]], she wielded a [[longsword]] that she later lost along with her hand during her original descent into Avernus. The ''[[Sword of Zariel]]'', as it came to be known, was hidden by her most loyal general, [[Yael]], and her [[hollyphant]] companion [[Lulu]].\n\nSome time after her fall, Zariel managed to take the hammer ''[[Matalotok]]'', an ancient weapon forged by [[Thrym]], from the [[demon lord]] [[Kostchtchie]], and started wielding it herself.\n\nAmong Zariel's dangerous weapons were her flying fortresses, massive [[basalt]] citadels that were usually repaired and serviced at the rusting [[Stygian Docks]] and fueled by souls extracted directly from the River [[Styx]]. One such vehicle was a colossal structure shaped like a blade, a {{SIAdj|450|ft|long=yes}} tall fortress that was crewed by hundreds of devils and could be controlled telepathically only by Zariel herself.",
        "Realm": {
            "Lair": "The seat of Zariel's power was a massive basalt citadel that spanned an area of {{SI|5|miÂ²|k|long=yes}}. Its walls were festooned with the partially burned bodies of those that disappointed the Lord of the First, many still screaming and moaning in dying agony and audible from up to {{SI|1|mile|k|long=yes}} away.\n\nThe citadel was manned by hundreds of various devils, both inside and out, and protected by high turrets that reinforced the walls. The region surrounding the citadel was also altered by Zariel's magic. {{SIAdj|10|ft|adj=high}} gouts of flame burst from the ground {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} apart from each other within {{SI|1|mi|k|long=yes}} of the fortress, as well as sight-obscuring smoke that clouded it between {{SI|500|ft|long=yes}} and {{SI|2|mile|k|long=yes}} away, and the smell of charred meat and screaming voices that could be perceived from up to {{SI|9|mile|k|long=yes}} away. Within the bounds of this lair, Zariel could create more ''fireballs'', as well as ''[[major image]]s'' to frighten her enemies; she had a preference for images of loved ones being burned alive."

        "Activities": "{{fq\n| text   = Zariel stands exactly where she always doesâwhere the fighting is fiercest.\n| source = [[Lulu]]\n| float  = left\n| width  = \n}}\nProsecuting the Blood War took up much of Zariel's time and attention, and she had little room to deal with anything else. Her offensive military campaign often had her at the forefront of invasions when she wasn't within a flying fortress overseeing Avernus's defense.\n\nIt was also her responsibility to ensure the defense of the plane against outside attack, the River Styx being a particularly important area for demonic entry and infernal strikes against the Abyss. [[Styx devil]]s guarded the citadels and outposts overlooking the river, but it fell to Zariel to manage travel to and from Avernus, and she had the final say over who could pass through.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Archdevils": "{{fq\n| text   = Keep wasting my time with your pointless words and die, or join my war band and live. Choose swiftly. I have a plane to conquer.\n| source = Zariel to emissaries from [[Dis]]\n| float  = \n| width  = 350px\n}}\nZariel's disdain for governmental machinations and refusal to make alliances made her a political pariah among her peers, Her return to prominence set off the paranoia of [[Dispater]], compelling him to retreat deeper within his [[Iron Tower]],\n\nDespite his banishment from Hell, the former archdevil [[Gargauth]] would gladly replace an archdevil like Zariel as Lord of Avernus after having been diminished in power, and Zariel in turn would order him destroyed if given the chance. Asmodeus admired Zariel's passion for warfare and welcomed her into the fold of the archdevils, the angel-turned-fiend being something of a jewel in his crown. Despite this, it was said she actually desired vengeance against the Raging Fiend, and planned to drive him from the Hells.\n\nZariel's most direct opponent was likely [[Bel]], former Lord of the First. Because Asmodeus supported Zariel, Bel couldn't directly challenge her, though he would take steps to make her seem incompetent, and allowed her to continue her reckless maneuvers in the hopes she'd overextend her forces and be removed after a defeat. He'd even go so far as to help her be redeemed, even despite the low odds of success, since it would lead to him becoming archduke once more.\n\nThe haughty and aloof [[Tiamat]] had a somewhat complex relationship with Zariel, although it was certainly a hostile one. Zariel resented the draconic goddess, as the fallen angel had been at her mercy during the time of her demotion,{{Cite dragon/359/1d20 Villains: D&D's Most Wanted; Preferably Dead|68}} and she had once sent her agents to steal from Tiamat's treasure hoards. At the same time, Zariel once gifted the ''[[Burning Orb of Etiol the Abandoned]]'', to one of her diplomat's successors, and had attempted to help her escape from Hell by assisting mortals with related goals. The attempts to free her, however, were only made because Zariel was unable to kill the Dragon Queen, and so seeing her leave Avernus was the next best option.",
            "Others": "{{fq\n| text   = This is who I am. When demons die, they cry out my name in terror.\n| source = Zariel's last words to Lulu\n| float  = left\n| width  = 300px\n}}\nZariel relished slaying demons and was known to do so personally when the opportunity presented itself, though she had specific relations with a few of them. Yeenoghu, for his part, hated Zariel with a passion and would love to destroy her.\n\n[[File:Zariel vs.Devils.png|thumb|right|250px|''Zariel's initial assault against Avernus with the Hellriders and Lulu.'']]\nZariel was friends with the hollyphant Lulu before her descent, a friendship that dated back centuries.\n\nA few [[tiefling]]s carried the blood of Zariel. They were stronger on average than typical tieflings and possessed a few innate magical abilities connected to aggression and battle."
        },
        "Worshipers": {
            "Manipulation": "{{fq\n| text   =  I claim your souls, mortals. The bravest of the world will serve meâor I will destroy all that is precious to you. Make your choice.\n| source = Zariel to her mortal assailants\n| float  = right\n| width  = 300px\n}}\nHowever, just because service to the former angel had some advantages didn't mean she wasn't willing to use underhanded means to get her way. Prosecuting the Blood War constantly taxed Zariel's armies, with her legions always being depleted by the ceaseless fighting. To keep Hell in the war, she aggressively recruited mortal souls and looked for evildoers on the [[Material Plane]] who could bring her more, thus guaranteeing her more infernal soldiers.\n\nThough violence was a crucial tool in the scheme, the methodology of Zariel's lead soul harvesters was nonetheless diabolical. Zariel's cults flourished in regions wracked by war, and her agents effectively acted as war-profiteers, sowing corruption by destroying harmony and stability, thus setting up the right circumstances for mortals to perform heinous deeds. They gave mortals the means to harm each other by funding evil organizations and distributing weapons, and incited hatred between them by coercing them into acts of sectarian violence justified by the need to defeat some arbitrary enemy.\n\nAnother deceptive method of Zariel was the exploitation of the mortal desire for spiritual leadership. Some cultists of Zariel were known to heap praise on her for her tireless efforts to win the Blood War and defeat the demons that threatened to destroy the cosmos.",
            "Size": "After Bel's uprising, Zariel's worshiper base entered a period of decline as her followers scattered and her cults crumbled, their devotion having not transferred to the Pretender."

How many souls did Zariel bring down with her?\n| source = [[Mordenkainen]]\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nAt some point, Bel managed to defeat Zariel and take her place as Archduke of Avernus.<ref group=\"note\"> The timeline of events regarding the date of Zariel's rises and falls seem to have been retconned from past editions. Zariel's imprisonment at the hands of Tiamat, as noted in ''[[The Rise of Tiamat]]'', remains constant, but earlier editions stated that she had fallen far earlier than current Realmsian sources. ''[[Guide to Hell]]'' has her as part of the ancient [[Reckoning]], having sided with the fellow fallen celestial [[Baalzebul]]'s faction in rebellion against Asmodeus, being betrayed by Bel upon her return after centuries of service, while the ''Codex of Betrayal'' for ''[[Dungeon magazine 197]]'' and ''The Lords of the Nine'' article in ''[[Dragon magazine 223]]'' put her as an archdevil back at the founding of Hell, the original lord of Avernus tasked by Asmodeus to protect it from vengeful angels.\n\nAsmodeus had allowed Bel to rule so long as he kept fighting the Blood War, but had done so partially out of the knowledge that he'd be too busy with the Blood War to scheme against his peers.{{Cite dungeon/197/Codex of Betrayal: Glasya|4}}\n\nEventually, Bel fell out of favor with Asmodeus after his inability to successfully repel a demonic invasion of Avernus, his overly cautious methods having proved inadequate to deal with the encroaching Abyssal offenses. Following Bel's demotion, Zariel was reinstated and reclaimed her title as Lord of Avernus before nearly driving all the demons out of Hell with her unrelenting offense.\n\nShortly after her reinstatement as Archduchess in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Zariel allied herself with the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] at the time of [[Severin Silrajin]]'s attempt to summon Tiamat into [[Toril]]. She assisted in their efforts by sending out mortal agents and by facilitating rituals of devil summoning. Her efforts, however, were opposed by Bel and his allies, who instead wished to keep Tiamat in Avernus.",

        "Rumors & Legends": "[[File:Zariel-panels.jpeg|thumb|right|350px|''The Saga of Zariel.'']]\nZariel was mentioned in ''[[The Trial of Asmodeus]]'', a theater play written by the [[aasimar]] [[bard]] [[Anodius]] allegedly based on real events. According to the play, the angels of Celestia had taken Asmodeus to court for his crimes, with the supremely [[law]]ful [[Primus]] serving as the impartial judge. As the angels testified, Asmodeus made the case that his actions served everyone, appealing to pragmatism and tradition.\n\nBut even Primus could run out of patience, and when he declared that only a few more angels would be heard, Zariel protested. She ignored the bureaucracy demanding to be heard, cutting to the front of the line before scuffling with her fellow angels. Asmodeus watched with a smile as the brawl became a battle before Primus demanded order, scolding the angels for infighting and presenting Asmodeus with a ''[[Ruby Rod of Asmodeus|Ruby Rod]]'' to ensure his adherence to the law.\n\nLegends held that Zariel had a measure of environmental control over the entire layer of Avernus. This effect manifested itself as the seemingly random ''fireballs'' that constantly detonated throughout the place, which were believed to be generated by the spite and rage of Zariel during her temporary imprisonment. The meteors were also said to be fragments of Avernus' former structures."
