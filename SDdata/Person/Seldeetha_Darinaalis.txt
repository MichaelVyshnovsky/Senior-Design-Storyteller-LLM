Seldeetha Darinaalis was the Grand Oracle of the Istishian faith.
Darinaalis was a half-sea elf. She was the first high priestess of the Water Lord, Istishia.
The firstborn of Darinaalis bloodline was given the title of Delphine Regent, which made them the leader of the Istishian faith. The hereditary title continued to be passed down, and as of approximately 1369 DR, the title of Delphine Regent was held by Aquaril Sethanilar.
