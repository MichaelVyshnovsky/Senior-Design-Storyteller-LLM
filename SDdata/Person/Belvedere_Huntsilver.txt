In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Belvedere Huntsilver, accompanied by [[Antone Corluk]], a footman of House Huntsilver, asked a band of [[adventurer]]s from the world of [[Eberron]], who were transported to [[Toril]] by a rift, to lend a hand to Oriphaun Huntsilver. Oriphaun, a nobleman adventurer and a relic collector of Wheloon, had found himself at the heart of a plot to attack the city of Wheloon by the shadow forces of the [[Returned Netheril]].
