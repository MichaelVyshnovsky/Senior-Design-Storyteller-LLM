        "mainbody": "Andahar was a unicorn that could be summoned by Drizzt DoUrden.\nDrizzt possessed a horn charm on a silver chain. When blown into, the charm summoned Andahar who appeared, running and gradually growing in size, from another dimension. However, unlike Drizzts other magical companion, Guenhwyvar, Andahar was mortal and could be wounded. He could be summoned at any time for a limited amount of time.\nAndahar was 17 hands tall. He had a white coat of fur, an ivory horn tipped with a golden point, and blue piercing eyes.\nThe ruling council of Silverymoon commissioned Andahar as a mount for Drizzt in gratitude for his work during the Third Orc War."
