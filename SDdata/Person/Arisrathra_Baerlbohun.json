        "mainbody": "'''Arisrathra Baerlbohun''' was the daughter of [[Unsible Baerlbohun]], the \"Mad Toymaker,\" who rose to wealth and prominence in [[Athkatla]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Arisrathra was a revelry-lowing and wild daughter of a gaudy-rich and decadent merchant Baerlbohun family. Some described her as a \"winking\" woman who was renowned for being \"ready and willing for all foolery\" among men of Athkatla. She spent her time as an eager revel-companion and social butterfly of the city's affluent [[Athkatla/Gem District|Gem District]].",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Arisrathra was the most well-known member of the family, apart from her \"Mad Toymaker\" father. She had three large, lazy, lumbering brothers, [[Purdynkul Baerlbohun]] being the oldest. Along with most of the family, Arisrathra Baerlbohun resided in a famously gaudy monstrosity of a mansion in the Gem District â€“ [[Baerlbohun House]], not to be confused with equally vulgarly grandiose [[Baerlbohun Towers]]."
