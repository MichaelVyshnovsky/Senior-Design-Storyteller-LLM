Amon was a mage who adventured along with several companions in Amn during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He was seemingly a member of the enigmatic Purple Brotherhood.
Among the other members of Amons band was the dwarven warrior Mencar Pebblecrusher, the thief Brennan Risling, as well as the half-orc barbarian Smaeluv Orcslicer. He appeared to barely tolerate the brutish half-orc.
Amon was also accompanied by his imp familiar Pooky, who referred to him as "Papa".
Among his possessions was a cloak of non-detection and a wand of lightning.
At some point in the , Amon and his group stayed at the Den of the Seven Vales in Athkatla.
