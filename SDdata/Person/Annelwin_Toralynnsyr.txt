Annelwin Toralynnsyr was a half-elf ranger of the Elmanesse tribe in the Forest of Tethir in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.The AD&D Trading Card "Annelwin" places her in the unknown "Tethyr Wood", but Lands of Intrigue Tethyr corrects this to the Forest of Tethir.
Annelwin dressed in green-colored clothing and had long brown hair and light skin.
She was married to fellow elven ranger Katyr, who was a scout for the tribe.
Annelwin was serious-minded in all matters, but particularly the care of forest creatures.
Although he was entirely mute, Katyr was able to communicate with his wife using a simple sign language, which she in turn translated for others. Katyr was one of the few people able to pierce his wifes serious demeanor to make her smile and laugh, but only occasionally and never whilst working.
She owned a magical tunic of blending.
Katyr and Annelwin kept a vigil over the forests of northern Tethyr, keeping merchants safe and treating injured animals. She punished severely any reckless hunters and adventurers she found. They also thwarted poachers and others up to no good on the Trade Way north of Mosstone by 1370 DR.
Annelwin hailed from Brost, but became a full member of the Elmanesse elf tribe.
