        "mainbody": "Ozama was a hot-tempered and magic-hungry wizard responsible for cursing and trapping her fiancé Jarial in a boulder in 1353 DR.\nShe had beautiful violet eyes that burned with passion.\nOzama had a sharp tongue and blinding temper.\nOzama possessed an immense talent for magic.\nOzama often conjured a magical dagger that had a parasitic effect on its targets, that ice dagger looked uncannily similar to the enchanted dagger called the Boreas Blood with only difference, Boreas Blood was of ice-like blue color.\nAt the time of her death, Ozama was wearing her enchanted snakeskin boots that protected her from poisons and venoms and a gray woolen cloak.\nIn 1353 DR, Ozama met a young sorcerer Jarial and they quickly fell madly in love becoming fiancés. She convinced Jarial to travel with her to the ruins of Myth Drannor in search for a dark naga collector of magic named Preybelish who could lead them to the artifact called the Wizard’s Torc. Eventually the couple had a fiery argument over something trivial as Jarial renounced his love for the sorceress. In heat of the moment, Ozama ensorcered a pebble and threw it to Jarials feet. The pebble grew and swallowed the sorcerers lower torso, trapping him in the Dwarven Dungeons of the ruined elven city. Ozama left him with a riddle that was the solution to the curse, and despite Jarials begging, she stormed off, leaving him alone within a dark and empty underground chamber.\nOzama fully intended to return to Jarial after the man learned his lesson, but she met her doom in the Dungeons overwhelmed by monsters. Sixteen years later, in 1369 DR a group of adventurers fighting to stop the Cult of the Dragons plans on corrupting Myth Drannors mythal came across the entombed sorcerer and easily freed him. Jarial joined the group that saved him from the torturous existence, eventually finding Ozamas skeleton surrounded by perished monsters."
