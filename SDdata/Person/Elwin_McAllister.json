        "mainbody": "'''Elwin Elrod McAllister''', also known as '''Raider McAllister''', was a [[human]] [[fighter]] and captain of the [[Osprey (ship)|''Osprey'']] based in [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Raider McAllister was a seasoned seafarer characterized by a slender, well-muscled frame and an aura of quiet confidence. His life at sea was etched into his weathered face, with penetrating blue eyes that reflected his depth of experience. Raider's black hair, streaked with gray, was neatly pulled back into a short tail, complementing his mostly gray, well-trimmed beard.\n\nHe was always impeccably dressed, favoring a royal blue doublet paired with trousers of the same color, and a white shirt featuring puffed and slashed sleeves. This ensemble was completed with blackjack boots and a hooded gray cloak, giving him a distinguished appearance. Raider's movements were marked by a rolling gait, a testament to years spent navigating the decks of a pitching ship.\n\nAlways armed, Raider carried a [[cutlass]] or a [[long sword]] accompanied by a matching [[dagger]], both secured in an elaborate harness at his hip. His love for the finer things was evident in his accessories, which included a large [[gold]] ring set with a [[sapphire]] on his right hand and a matching sapphire earring in his left ear.",
        "Personality": "When in port, Captain McAllister was known for his soft-spoken demeanor, politeness, and reserved nature. This calm and controlled façade, however, masked a starkly different persona that emerged when he was at sea. Upon the waves, Captain McAllister transformed into a commanding figure, his booming voice echoing across the deck, reaching every corner of his ship.\n\nCaptain McAllister thrived under pressure, whether it was maneuvering through a fierce storm or leading his crew during a pirate assault. He embodied the essence of leadership, consistently demonstrating courage and determination. His philosophy was simple but powerful: he never demanded more from his crew than he himself was willing to give. This principle not only inspired trust and loyalty among his men but also garnered immense respect for him both as a captain and as a person. McAllister's ability to seamlessly blend authority with fairness and courage made him a revered figure both on land and at sea.",
        "Abilities": "Captain McAllister was renowned throughout Ravens Bluff as a daring sea captain and a shrewd businessman. His profound knowledge of the winds, currents, and harbors of the [[Inner Sea]] was unmatched, making him a legendary figure among those who plied these waters. Raider's connection to the sea ran deep; it was said that his soul was inextricably linked with the ocean, a bond that had been evident since his earliest days.\n\nHis almost mystical ability to read the sea's conditions—weather, wind, and waves—mirrored the expertise of a scholar immersed in a beloved text. This sixth sense for maritime elements not only underscored his reputation as an exceptional navigator but also enhanced his capability as a tactician and strategist in both navigation and commerce.\n\nCaptain McAllister's reputation as a superb swordsman was well-established, granting him a degree of respect that ensured he was seldom troubled by anyone, save for the most inebriated or foolhardy of sailors. His presence alone often sufficed to deter potential confrontations. Committed to maintaining peace, Raider never initiated conflicts or stirred up trouble while ashore, except in cases where his ship, the ''Osprey'', was disparaged or insulted.\n\nIn such instances, Raider expected a swift and sincere apology. Should this not be forthcoming, he was known to assert his respect for honor and discipline by teaching the offender a stern, albeit painful, lesson in courtesy.",
        "Possessions": "Captain McAllister possessed a ''[[periapt of proof against poison]]'', a ''[[rope of entangling]]'', and ''[[bracers of brachiation]]''.",
        "Activities": "While deeply committed to his ship, and the sea, Captain McAllister occasionally took brief respites on land.\n\nIn Ravens Bluff, Raider was often found around the dock area, actively tending to the needs of his ship and crew. He steered clear of the more disreputable taverns, preferring the quieter dockside establishments where he was known to partake in food and drink with moderation. He preferred a subdued environment where he could relax without straying far from the maritime world.\n\nDuring the colder months, Captain McAllister shared his extensive knowledge and passion for the sea by teaching aspiring adventurers the art of ship design and building.\n\nAdditionally, Captain McAllister was an occasional visitor at the [[Narwhal Manor]], where he spent long winter evenings in the company of his friend, [[Draco Elass]]. These visits provided him with a space to unwind and converse away from the demands of his captaincy. The manor, known for its warm and inviting atmosphere, served as an ideal retreat for Raider, offering a pleasant contrast to his life at sea.",
        "History": "Captain Raider McAllister, originally known as Elwin Elrod McAllister, was born in [[Waterdeep]]. He was the son of a [[Lantan|Lantanese]] merchant priest and a minor noblewoman, inheriting a blend of mercantile acumen and aristocratic poise from his parents.\n\nRaider's nautical career commenced at the age of 17 when he constructed his first vessel, the ''[[Sea Sprite]]''. With a crew of youthful and daring adventurers, he navigated the ''Sprite'' into [[Luskan]]. Here, he orchestrated a bold rescue of a prominent Waterdhavian merchant who had fallen captive to Luskanite raiders. During this mission, Raider managed to defeat and capture two of the raiders pursuing him, an act of bravery that earned him his nickname \"Raider\" and he swiftly chose to abandon his original moniker, Elwin Elrod.\n\nThese exploits, however, marked the beginning of Raider's long-standing conflict with the rulers of Luskan, who harbored a deep animosity towards him. Over the next 15 years, they persistently sought to wreak havoc in his life.\n\nEventually weary of the constant threats, Raider sought refuge by disappearing with the assistance of a friendly [[wizard]]. He briefly based his operations in [[Westgate]], only to find its political atmosphere untenable. The ports of [[Sembia]] and [[Cormyr]] proved too restrictive for his liking. Ultimately, Raider settled in Ravens Bluff, attracted by the city’s optimal mix of reasonable tariffs and fair customs enforcement, which best accommodated his enduring seafaring and mercantile ventures."
