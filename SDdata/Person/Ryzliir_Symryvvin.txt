'''Ryzliir Symryvvin''' was a [[drow]] elite warrior in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Ryzliir was commanded to lead a drow battalion to intercept an expedition led by some [[adventurer]]s, who'd been hired by [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] to investigate the threat of a [[demon lord]], but she and her troops were defeated.
