Jimjar was a deep gnome gambler during the late 15 century DR.
The gnome was a reckless rogue with a devil-may-care attitude, a fondness for coin, and an obsession with betting on virtually anything and everything. However, he was a man of word and remembered all debts and credits, which he always honored. Jimjar also possessed an amazing ability to secret significant wealth on his person.
Jimjar was exiled by his people because of his gambling obsession, which other deep gnomes saw as a sign of deep madness. While he does not wish to go back home, he will guide others if asked.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, he was captured by drow slavers of Velkynvelve.
