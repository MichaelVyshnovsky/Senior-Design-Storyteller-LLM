Duroamyn "Deathstrike" Steelhawk was a famous adventurer and archer in northwest Faer√ªn in the 14 century DR.
In life, Duroamyn owned two adjacent tallhouses on Spindle Street, in the Trades Ward of the city Waterdeep. Later, two daughters he had by the names of Ierithue and Sharlma would each inherit one of the two tallhouses.
