        "History": "At some point, Aruugan had pledged himself to the [[god]] [[Bane]].\n\nUnder Aruugan's leadership, the Black Wolf clan was one of the only tribes in the Giantspires able to maintain independence in the face of the expansionism of the [[Razor Heart]] tribe and their queen, [[Maaqua]]. Their continued success was thanks to his willingness to take shelter in the [[Dunwood]] alongside his clan's [[worg]] allies."
