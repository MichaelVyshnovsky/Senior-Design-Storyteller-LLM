She had half of her hair shaven, and the rest set in dreadlocks. She also had some tattooed designs on the right side of her face, ring piercings along the bridge of her nose, and a piercing beneath her lower lip. She wore light armor and a buckler, and carried a pair of serrated daggers.\nHelayna had a rather flat and stoic manner, not showing much emotion.\nAround the , Helayna and her friends Popkin Shortshanks, Jarus Brithandir, Liantor Stoneborn, Kirina Aelorothi, and Tristran of Daggerford discovered an ancient tomb at the bottom of a crevasse in the Stonelands. They initially fought their way past some undead inhabitants, then discovered a hidden passage leading into deeper caves. After passing deeper underground, the group was ambushed by the kobolds of Clan Daeronnax, whose sudden attack separated the members. Popkin alone escaped to the surface and returned to Eveningstar to get assistance.\nAfter losing her comrades, Helayna scouted the tunnels in search for the rest of her group, but didnt meet any success. Thanks to Popkins actions, Helayna was among the survivors recovered by a second party of adventurers who were able to use word of recall-imbued trinkets to instantly send her to safety in Eveningstar."
