'''Deena''' was a [[mystic]] and an [[enchanter]], who worked as a swimming instructor in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, Morris was in her late teens. Deena was a muscular young woman, {{SI|5'9|'"|long=yes}} tall, and {{SI|150|lb|k|long=yes}}. She had dark brown straight shoulder-long hair and large brown eyes. Deena's face always had a calm, pleasant smile. She often wore bright white [[robe]]s and a modest one-piece swimsuit when teaching.

==Personality==
Just like her fellow instructors, Deena was a pacifist and only entered conflicts to defend herself. She meditated daily for two hours before dawn.

==Abilities==
Deena spoke [[Common]], [[Elvish]], and [[Merfolk language]]s. Among weapon proficiencies, she only knew how to use simple [[sling]]s. She was a master dancer and swimmer. Deena was also knowledgeable in the subjects of astrology and religion. Her magical abilities were humble but impressive for a woman her age. She knew several spells recorded in her ''[[spellbook]]'', such as ''[[cantrip]]'', ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', and ''[[sleep]]''. Other magic abilities of hers consisted of being able to ''[[feign death]]'', the ability to leave her body in spirit form, and the ability to move through any opening. Each of these abilities could be used once per [[tenday]], remaining active for 24 hours. Additionally, she could ''[[levitate]]'' once per tenday for an hour.

==History==
Deena was born and raised [[Ravenaar]]. She apprenticed in magic at Ravens Bluff and adopted the worship of [[Eldath]] at an early age. Deena befriended a [[cleric]] of Eldath named [[Milissa]] in her teens and, several years later, joined her swimming school that gave lessons to [[humanoid]]s in Raven Bluff's docks. Deena was taught how to swim by Milissa, and she became the swimming school's latest teacher.
