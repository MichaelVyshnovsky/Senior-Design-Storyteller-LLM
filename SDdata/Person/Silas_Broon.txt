Silas Broon was a tavern owner of the Flagon and the Dragon in Skullport.
In his early mercenary days, Silas befriended a pseudodragon called Weeshrike, who went on to save his life numerous times and even now patrolled his masters place for potential minions of Dalagor.
Once Silas was a mercenary until he disagreed with Dalagor, earning him as an enemy. So he decided to stop fighting and become a tavern owner.
Around 1370 DR, his tavern was well frequented by his former companions.
