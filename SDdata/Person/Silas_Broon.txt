'''Silas Broon''' was a tavern owner of the [[Flagon and the Dragon]] in [[Skullport]].

==Relationship==
In his early mercenary days, Silas befriended a [[pseudodragon]] called [[Weeshrike]], who went on to save his life numerous times and even now patrolled his master's place for potential minions of Dalagor.

==History==
Once Silas was a mercenary until he disagreed with [[Dalagor]], earning him as an enemy. So he decided to stop fighting and become a tavern owner.

Around [[1370 DR]], his tavern was well frequented by his former companions.
