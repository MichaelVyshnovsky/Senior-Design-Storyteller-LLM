Rowan Silvercrown was a Lorewarden of Oghma, serving within the Leaves of Learning in the settlement of Highmoon during the midâ€“14 century DR. She was also a senior monk within the Children of the Passive Voice, leading the contingent of learned protectors of the Oghmanyte library-temple around 1372 DR. 
Rowan acted as a mother hen of sorts to the Leaves clerics, watching closely over them when they ventured out from the temples walls to nearby towns or out into nature. She constantly chided local members of the Tower Guard, whom she believed did not fulfill their duties with the same vigilance she saw from her fellow monks.
She was a skilled combatant, who could quickly analyze her opponents while evading their attacks, and find just the right time to counter with a deft strike. Like others within her order, Rowan favored the siangham, which they referred to as "Oghmas quill".
Rowan was born in the Sembian city of Ordulin, but raised in Tegals Mark, the capital of Tasseldale. She was brought up with a great appreciation for and love of books as well as a hatred for those would attempt to destroy the knowledge they contained. She became a member of the Children at a very young age, and quickly ascended within their ranks.
