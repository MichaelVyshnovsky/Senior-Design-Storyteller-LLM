'''Rowan Silvercrown''' was a Lorewarden of [[Oghma]], serving within the [[Leaves of Learning]] in the settlement of [[Highmoon]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was also a senior [[monk]] within the [[Children of the Passive Voice]], leading the contingent of learned protectors of the Oghmanyte library-temple around [[1372 DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/The Leaves of Learning|7}} 

==Description==
Rowan acted as a mother hen of sorts to the Leaves' [[cleric]]s, watching closely over them when they ventured out from the temple's walls to nearby towns or out into nature. She constantly chided local members of the [[Tower Guard]], whom she believed did not fulfill their duties with the same vigilance she saw from her fellow monks.

She was a skilled combatant, who could quickly analyze her opponents while evading their attacks, and find just the right time to counter with a deft strike. Like others within her order, Rowan favored the [[siangham]], which they referred to as "Oghma's quill".

==History==
Rowan was born in the [[Sembia]]n city of [[Ordulin]], but raised in [[Tegal's Mark]], the capital of [[Tasseldale]]. She was brought up with a great appreciation for and love of [[book]]s as well as a hatred for those would attempt to destroy the knowledge they contained. She became a member of the Children at a very young age, and quickly ascended within their ranks.
