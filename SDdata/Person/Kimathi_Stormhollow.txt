Kimathi Stormhollow was a human inhabitant of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR.
He wore a white shirt, a brown vest, a maroon cap, and black breeches, and he also had a decorated strap across his body.
In the late 1490s DR, Kimathi was a spectator at the revived High Sun Games held at the Neverwinter arena. He was one of the many who noticed the dark tendrils creeping down from the sky as Sofina invoked the horn of beckoning death, and remarked on it to the woman sitting beside him. He likely left with the rest of the audience, following a trail of treasure falling from a hot-air balloon.
