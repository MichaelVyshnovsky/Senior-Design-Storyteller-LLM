'''Kimathi Stormhollow''' was a [[human]] inhabitant of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}

==Description==
He wore a white shirt, a brown vest, a maroon cap, and black [[breeches]], and he also had a decorated strap across his body.

==History==
In the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Kimathi was a spectator at the revived [[High Sun Games]] held at the [[Neverwinter arena]]. He was one of the many who noticed the dark tendrils creeping down from the sky as [[Sofina]] invoked the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'', and remarked on it to the woman sitting beside him. He likely left with the rest of the audience, following a trail of treasure falling from a [[hot-air balloon]].
