'''Malghar Caldwel''' was a member of the [[Caldwell]] [[patriar]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Malghar Caldwel was found dead, alongside the bodies of [[Ulis Oberon]] and [[Flaev Linnacker]], within the territory controlled by [[the Guild]] and guarded by its thugs, near the entrance to the Guildhall in the [[Lower City]]. All three patriars were nothing but charred remains. Nearby, one could find a bundle of letters that included numerous declined invitation for Malghar Caldwel to attend the Guildhall with the last one amongst them suddenly canning the tone and agreeing to visit despite possible negative optics. Presumably, Malghar was murdered upon that visit after failed negotiations regarding her debts with the criminal organization. Another letter, from the mysterious [[Mystic Carrion]], indicated that Malghar did business with the [[undead]] dealer, who offered her a ten percent discount on some sort of protection from the Guild.
