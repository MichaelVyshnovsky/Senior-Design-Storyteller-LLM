'''Xenz''' was a pirate lord based on [[Mirg Isle]] in the [[Pirate Isles]] in [[1359 DR]].

==Personality==
Xenz was quite bold, even for a pirate. His actions dared the pirate lords of [[Dragonisle]] to stop him.

==Description==
The few survivors who encountered Xenz all described him differently and often forgot the details from his attack.


==Activities==
Xenz raided from his ship the ''Beauty's Eye'', rarely leaving survivors in his wake. Any village he raided was utterly sacked with the population enslaved. His growing fame attracted other pirate captains to his side with his fleet numbering forty ships at the height of his power. His reluctance to step foot onto Dragonisle and [[Immurk's Hold]] kept him from ruling over the whole of the Pirate Isles.

==Rumors & Legends==
Xenz was rumored to be allied with [[Zhentil Keep]]. His complete control over all who joined his ranks lead many to believe [[magic]] was being used to control the minds of his followers.
