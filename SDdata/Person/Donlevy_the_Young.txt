Donlevy BelMaris, known as Donlevy the Young, was the 20 Baron of Polten in Damara. He was named for his father, Donlevy the Old.
Donlevy the Young was somewhat naïve at the outset of his political career.
As baron, Donlevy the Young ruled Polten from the capital at Trailsend.
Donlevy the Young was a member of the noble House BelMaris. He relied heavily on the advice and counsel of his predecessor as baron, Zorth BelMaris, and as a result was a supporter of Baron Dimian Ree of Morov.
When the Vaasan War began in the , Donlevy the Old feared for his infant heirs safety should Zhengyi the Witch-King triumph. To keep his son and his lineage safe, Donlevy the Old arranged for the two year-old Donlevy the Young to live in hiding as a farm boy in Tellerth, a town on the furthest eastern fringes of the barony. When Zhengyi massacred the BelMaris family at the end of the war in the , the 12 year-old Donlevy the Young was left as the only true heir of the Barony of Polten. However, he had to remain in hiding as Zhengyi had installed a puppet and pretender to the family name, Zorth BelMaris, to rule the barony.
Two years later, the Bloodstone Wars broke out between the baronies and with Zhengyis Kingdom of Vaasa. The town of Tellerth, along with nearly a thousand Polten soldiers and all of their families, turned their backs on Baron Zorth when he refused to stand against the Witch-King. With Zorths popular support at an all-time low, Donlevy the Young came forward to claim his birthright. Despite being only 14 years old and having no experience as a ruler, it was clear that the people would support his claim, so Zorth stepped down. However, Zorth managed to convince the new baron that his experience would be valuable, and so was kept on as an advisor. As Donlevys decisions began to look more and more like Zorths doing, such as supporting Dimian Rees claim to the Damaran throne over Gareth Dragonsbanes, many of Donlevys allies began to express worries over the pretenders influence. However, by this time Zorth had positioned himself to deflect these concerns before they reached the barons ears.
Over the course of the , he was able to bring Tellerth back into the fold.
Ultimately, Donlevy decided to back Gareth Dragonsbane’s claim to the throne. By the , he had leveraged his barony’s historically strong ties to Impiltur to become one of King Gareth’s most trusted—and wealthiest—allies.
