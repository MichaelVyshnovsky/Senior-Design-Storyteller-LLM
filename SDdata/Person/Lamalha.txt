'''Lamalha''' was a female [[assassin]] of the [[Iron Throne]] and [[cleric]] of [[Cyric]] who lived on the [[Sword Coast]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''You lie! Remember what I told you about lying. You were foolish to even try, as my god Cyric allows me to see through all falsehoods. You shall now die, Abdel Adrian. You will never interfere with the Iron Throne ever again.''|Lamalha}}


==Relationships==
She traveled in an all-female party, which included [[Maneira]], [[Telka]], and [[Zeela]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Lamalha and her allies were hired by the [[Iron Throne]] to kill [[Abdel Adrian]]. The woman ambushed the [[Bhaalspawn]] outside the [[Nashkel]] mine as he and his companions emerged from a shaft after confronting [[Mulahey]], a servant of the Iron Throne. Presumably, Lamalha did not survive the ambush.
