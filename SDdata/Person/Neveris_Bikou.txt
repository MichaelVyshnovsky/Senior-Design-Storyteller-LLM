Neveris Bikou was the leader of Chondath circa 900 DR, during the Rotting War in the Vilhon Reach.
In 900 DR, Neveris Bikou sent Chondathan armies to Hlath, following the increased political power of the governors of Hlath and Reth. The two cities joined forces in a bloody battle on the south side of the River Nun against Neveris armies, marking the start of the Rotting War. The following year, in the spring of 901 DR, Hlath and Reth turned against each other. The city of Hlath was facing advancing armies of both Neveris Bikou and the city of Reth. Archmage Whinonas Ferentier, the governor of Hlath used deadly magics of Netheril against its enemies. The resulting battle of spells resulted in heavy losses on all sides of the conflict. By 902 DR, the civil war in Chondath was officially named the Rotting War.
Neveris Bikou of Arrabar, and his counterparts from Hlath and Reth all grew tired of the war and ordered their wizards to unleash the deadliest of the spells in attempts of reaching swift victory. The site of the battle was the Fields of Nun. Unleashed necromantic spells swallowed all three armies, infecting them with deadly and torturous arcane afflictions. This reckless use of Netherese magics resulted in the deaths of one-third of all troops involved, all happening within mere minutes after the spells were unleashed. The battle survivors spread the afflictions across the land, resulting in a plague that put an end to the Rotting War. Neveris Bikou never reclaimed control of neither Hlath nor Reth. Eventually, Chondath granted independence to what was to become Sembia.
