'''Dandobar Snome''' was the young patriarch of the noble [[Snome]] family in [[Waterdeep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.

==Personality==
Dandobar was humble enough that he did not covet the position of being head of the family, nor did he expect it would befall to him since he was the youngest of the 47 grandchildren of [[Arrabas Snome]].

==Activities==
At the age of twenty, he traveled about [[Calimshan]] and the cities around the [[Lake of Steam]] and negotiated agreements with various suppliers for the family's liquor import business. He also acquired formulas for the Snome distilleries and opened up markets for the export of their [[beer]] and spirits.

==Relationships==
His junket to the [[Lands of Intrigue]] and points east greatly impressed his grandfather Arrabas and he chose Dandobar as his heir before he died ''circa'' 1370 DR. This embittered another prominent member of the family, [[Thyriellentha Snome]], who held the prestigious senior command position of Mage Civilar of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch of Waterdeep]]. She was the eldest granddaughter and felt that she was the logical choice to inherit control of the family business. After this perceived slight, she distanced herself from the family even though Dandobar named her as his heir in case something should happen to him.
