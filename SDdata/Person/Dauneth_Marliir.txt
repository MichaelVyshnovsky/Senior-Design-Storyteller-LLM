'''Dauneth Marliir''' was a member of the [[Marliir]] noble house of [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]]. Dauneth Marliir was a nobleman and warrior, loyal throughout the [[Abraxus Affair]], and was appointed to be [[Warden of the Eastern Marches]] by Azoun IV.

==Description==
With a height of {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}},

==Possessions==
Dauneth carried a pouch containing his gems and letters of reference given to him by his father.

He was the husband of [[Krystin Lhal]] and together they had a daughter, [[Nalara Marliir]].

==Relationships==
He was five years younger than Princess [[Tanalasta]].

==History==
Dauneth came to [[Suzail]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, and met [[Glarasteer Rhauligan]], a local turret merchant, and they began drinking in the Snout Room of the [[Roving Dragon]], where he was introduced to [[Emthrara Undril]], whom he presumed to be a dancer. Emthrara gave him a scroll, appearing to be from [[Alusair Obarskyr]], granting him access to the royal palace, and showed him a secret entrance.

In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Dauneth attended Regent Alusair in [[Arabel]] while she negotiated with [[Princes of Shade|Prince]] [[Rivalen Tanthul]] of the recently returned [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] of [[Thultanthar]]. When the [[Shadovar]] prince proved treacherous, Dauneth happily executed several of the prince's on the regent's command.

By the late 1390s DR, Dauneth had been appointed Lord High Marshal of the realm. In the {{YearlinkName|1396}}, his daughter Nalara married King [[Azoun V]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|61}}
