'''Thegger Grynn''' was one of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] at [[Bloodgate Keep]] around [[1485 DR]].

==History==
In 1485 DR, Thegger decided to take control of the [[Phylund Hunting Lodge]] with the aid of a tribe of [[gnoll]]s and the possessing [[pit fiend]] [[Baazka]]. Shortly after he and his minions took control of the place, the gnolls started preying on caravans from [[Daggerford]] while Thegger was busy with his [[necromancy|necromantic]] research.

==Personality==
Thegger was too scared to betray his masters. He preferred death.
