Ido Kunarakuai was the chief justice of the executive hyojosho court in Uwaji. He had been in that position for twenty years. He was so totally devoted to his career that he neglected his family. His wife divorced from him in 1347 DR and all his three daughters worked as geisha in Semmishi.
Kunarakuai was a wise and stern man, appreciated by both nobility and commoners for his common sense approach to the law. He greatly regretted the problems with his family.
