'''Bigby''' was a legendary otherworldly [[wizard]] and hands-on [[spell]] inventor. He was known by several inhabitants of the [[Realms]], and a handful of his spells were used all over.

==Description==
Bigby was not born on [[Toril]], but instead on [[Oerth]]. However, it is believed that he had travelled to [[Toril]].

The archmage invented many handy spells, several of which were used in the [[Realms]]. Some of these spells were ''[[Bigby's forceful hand]]'', ''[[Bigby's interposing hand]]'', ''[[Bigby's clenched fist]]'', ''[[Bigby's crushing hand]]'', and ''[[Bigby's grasping hand]]''.

==Possessions==
Over the course of his life Bigby had possessed a ''+2 [[dagger]]'', a ''[[djinni bottle]]'', a ''+3 [[ring of protection]]'', a ''[[ring of X-ray vision]]'', a ''[[ring of mind shielding]]'', a ''[[staff of power]] +3'', a ''[[wand of fire]]'', a ''[[wand of frost]]'', a ''[[wand of negation]]'', a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]'', a pair of ''[[winged boots]]'', and a pair of ''[[boots of striding and springing]]''. 

Bigby also possessed a [[spellbook]] that he authored, named ''[[Manual Powers Beyond Life]]'', which in addition to all of his major spells included ''[[burning hands]]''.{{Cite dragon/82/Spells between the covers|57}}

==History==
Bigby was an associate of [[Mordenkainen]] and a member of the [[Circle of Eight]]. However, Bigby and [[Otiluke]] were killed by the traitorous wizard, [[Rary]].

[[Tenser]] wore the [[enchanted]] item called the ''[[Hood of the Weave]]'' during the ceremony of being inducted into the Circle of Eight on the world of Oerth. The hood would eventually find its way to Toril, but following the ceremony, during the celebration, the fellow members of the Circle, Otiluke and Bigby pranked Tenser. However, thanks to the hood, they found their [[vodka]] glasses ensorcelled with a spell that transformed their earlobes into sassy [[pixie]]s.

In [[1358 DR]], [[Midnight]] remembered a spell she once saw be performed. Because she had gained much of [[Mystra]]'s power, Midnight immediately recognized that Bigby had invented this spell many centuries ago.

In [[1364 DR]], [[Robillard]] and [[Harkle Harpell]] engaged in a spellcasting competition. After Robillard cast a spell, Harkle asked if Robillard knew of Bigby, who of course recognised him as one of the most magnificent wizards of all time, even on other worlds. Harkle, however, claimed that he had improved on one of Bigby's spells by inventing a new version himself: ''[[Bigby's snapping digits]]''.

Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Bigby fashioned an [[enchanted]] ''[[ring of blinking]]'' for his trusted [[dog]] â€“ [[Bigboy]]. The hound used the [[ring]]'s magic to catch [[cat]]s and harass postmen.

[[File:Bigby is crushed.jpeg|thumb|Bigby's time as a [[Human]] is ended at the hands of a [[Frost giant]]]]
While travelling with [[Mordenkainen]], Bigby would be killed by a [[Frost giant]]. Mordenkainen was unable to find a [[Cleric]] to revive him, and instead had a [[Druid]] use [[Reincarnate]] to resurrect him as a [[Gnome]].  

Some time after that, Bigby would free an enslaved woman from a [[Hill giant]]'s dungeon, and in gratitude she taught him the basics of rune-carving. He later discovered that woman was the goddess [[Diancastra]] in disguise when they met again teaming up to take down a cult of the [[Elemental Evil]] being led by a [[Cloud giant]]. The two of them would go on to have many adventures in each others company, many of which revolved around preventing giants from being corrupted by evil deities.

|Khelben on Bigby
}}
It was rumored that [[Khelben Arunsun]] had met Bigby, though the meeting went sour. Khelben told his apprentice, [[Illistar]], that Bigby relied on over-used "gimmicks". To prove his point, the Blackstaff developed a spell, ''[[Khelben's warding whip]]'', in order to counter many of Bigby's spells.
