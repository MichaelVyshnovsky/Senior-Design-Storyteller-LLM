        "mainbody": "\"Tracker\", also known as Alisheen Starnshield, was a ranger and a Harper agent active in Anauroch in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nTracker lent aid to good-natured folk who traveled or lived in Anauroch, usually protecting them from orcs and lamia and the deserts hazards.\nThough Tracker donned many different mundane and magical disguises, when out of disguise he appeared to be a man of grim expression and wild hair, and clad in often-repaired and decaying armor. Tracker revealed he was female only to close friends.\nThanks to the many disguises, Tracker had a mysterious reputation, but had a wry humor.\nTracker wore leather armor and wielded a longsword and dagger together in combat. He favored the spells animal friendship, invisibility to animals, speak with animals, and hold animal, as well as entangle, goodberry, and tree.\nHe lived out of a cellar in an unnamed, abandoned village somewhere south of Ascore. His cesspit nearby was signposted \"Last Dungeon Before Waterdeep\" as a joke. He had over 4 pp in wealth on hand."
