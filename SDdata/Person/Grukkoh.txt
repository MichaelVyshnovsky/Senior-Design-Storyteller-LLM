'''Grukkoh''' was a [[bugbear]] who lived on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Grukkoh made his way to the village of [[Moonhaven]], after it was taken over by the [[cult of the Absolute]]. During his stay, he took some time to enjoy the company of the [[ogre]]ss [[Buthir]]. They went to the village's barn and had a rousing, and noisy, roll in the hay.
