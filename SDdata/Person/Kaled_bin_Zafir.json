        "mainbody": "Kaled bin Zafir was a Zakharan inventor in Mulmaster in 1491 DR.\nKaled was an eccentric man, and a genius in his field. He was usually haughty but recently a profound fear had pervaded him. The slightest sound made him jump, and he couldnt stop looking over his shoulder.\nKaled was born and raised in Zakhara. He left Zakhara for Faer√ªn and trained with the famed gnome inventor Nadul DaRoni. He settled in Mulmaster. At one point, he wrote the acclaimed Codex of Ingenious Contraptions.\nIn 1491 DR, his research attracted the interest of both Zor Aleksi Drejkov, secretly of the Cult of the Howling Hatred, and the Brotherhood of the Cloak. After the killing of Zel Tregarthen, the City Watch conducted a raid on his laboratory."
