        "mainbody": "Jasmine was both a spelljamming and planewalking adventurer. She was a member of Finders Band and was notable for her wings.\nJasmines appearance was that of a woman in her mid-to-late twenties, with black hair and brown eyes. She was  tall and was quite muscular. Sprouting from her back were magical wings that changed appearance depending on the plane or world she was in. The wings resembled white doves wings on Toril, a gargoyles copper wings in the city of Sigil, pink butterfly wings if in the phlogiston, silver hummingbird wings in the Astral Plane, clear dragonfly wings in the Ethereal plane, eagles wings with peacock-colored feathers in the plane of Arborea, red alu-fiend wings in the Abyss, plain falcons wings in the Outlands, large white moth wings in Ysgard, long flaming phoenix wings in Elysium, Whatever her wings appearance, it did not affect her speed or maneuverability. Jass wings radiated strong magic on par with an artifact but they could not be removed nor affected by dispelling or any other magics.\nWhen she fell under the influence of a dark stalker persona (fueled by her grief and guilt combined with a slight glitch in her wings magic), her skin was entirely covered in hard black feathers with a green crest on her forehead, her eyes turned green, and her hands and feet become taloned.\nOn the outside, Jasmine appeared to be a fun-loving and sarcastic young woman. She preferred to avoid close relationships—the result of many emotional traumas of her past. The lonely demeanor often led the woman to care about her own needs first. She often acted judgmentally and cynically. By 1368 DR, she still carried incredible grief for the loss of her parents and spelljamming crew. She tried to avoid the grief by traveling and running away from her problems. The same year, 1368 DR, Jas lost some of her powers and experiences to an abyssal creature known as fetch. This newfound feeling of weakness caused depression and feeling of inferiority.\nEven a decade after acquiring her strange magical wings, Jas still felt uncomfortable and insecure because of them.\nIn rare cases when she grew attached to certain individuals, against her own better judgement, she became their steadfast and loyal ally.\nthumb|280x280px|Jasmine knocking an umber hulk out.\nJasmine was a trained fighter who knew how to handle daggers, throwing knives, short swords, maces, and arquebus. Even unarmed, she was a deadly opponent. When in combat, she liked to surprise her opponents by performing aerial drops, whacking opponents skulls or shoulders with her feet.\nHer criminal past taught her to know the value of goods, to disguise, and gamble. Life on a spelljammer gifted her with a directional sense, navigation, and sailors endurance.\nEven though Jas briefly helmed a nautiloid, she preferred to travel lightly, only carrying her leather armor, her dagger, and a short sword. She lost most of her worldly possession aboard the nautiloid, but she valued a black crystal paperweight with drifting stars inside it this was a gift from Holly Harrowslough. Later, she received an enchanted +1 luck blade from the goddess of luck Tymora herself.\nJasmine became close friends with Joel the Rebel Bard the, paladin of Lathander Holly Harrowslough, the kender Emilo Haversack, and even the gods of Toril, Finder Wyvernspur, and Tymora. However, she tended to distrust most gods and their clergy, but really hated (to the point of berserk rage) the gods Bane and Iyachtu Xvim and their loathsome clergy.\nthumb|Jasmine, the winged fighter.|354x354px\nJasmines parents were spelljamming paladins of Tymora hailing from Faerûn.\nJasmines parents worked to destroy a slavery ring and earned the ire of the criminal underbelly of the City of Splendors. After her parents were slain sometime during her early teens by assassins, she was taken in by a friend of her mothers for a while—a tavern keeper named Luna.\nOne day, Jasmine found herself the center of an unlikely but lucky series of events involving a thief, a fiend, a stolen baby faerie dragon, and a few Tymoran priests. She was ordered to lay in hiding, keeping an eye on a couple of clerics of Tymora. Suddenly she witnessed a thief in a rush tossing a sack into the trash bin where Jas was hiding. A moment later, the first thief was arguing with another rogue who joined him and demanded to share the loot from the temple of Tymora. While the thieves argued, Jas snatched the bag of loot, discovering inside a platinum coin, a white feather cape, and a cracked faerie dragon egg with a newborn hatchling wriggling about. A scuffle erupted among the thieves and one of them was killed. The surviving thief turned out to be a winged shadow fiend of some description. Jas tried to escape, but the creature teleported and easily caught up with her. The fiend demanded the bag with the dragon, Jasmine refused, knowing that the moment she released the bag she was dead. At that moment the priests Jasmine was watching entered the fray. Two Tormites flung lightnings at the fiend, saving the unwilling hero. The clerics took the shadow fiend as an ill omen and instead of walking into the trap set by Carter, they returned to the temple to pray.\nJasmine was wary of returning to her sure-to-be-furious employer and instead she walked into the temple of Tymora to return the stolen goods. The clerics of Tymora were elated with the return of the faerie dragon hatchling. They claimed that the Lady Luck was guiding Jas hands and threw her a feast for returning the baby dragon the temple was sworn to protect. During the feast, she was taken aside by a priestess who challenged her to a game of empress, and if she won she could choose her reward and if she lost her reward would be chosen for her. Jas won. As a prize she was offered a wish. Jasmine wanted her parents to be live, but that could not happen. She wanted to leave Carter, to be free as a passing bird. The priestess (actually Tymora in disguise) smiled sadly and granted the wish, giving Jasmine her magical wings and, as a result, a firm distrust of all the gods.\nIn a way, her wish was granted. With the huge wings she was no longer was useful in Carters criminal activities and he dismissed the woman without any care for her well-being.\nAfter incident, Jasmine by chance came across and befriended a spelljamming sorceress named Meredith. The spellcaster happened to be Jass parents old friend and she took the young winged woman off-world on her magic ship. Jas spent a decade onboard Merediths spelljammer until she came into possession of a nautiloid—her very own spelljamming ship.\nFollowing a narrow escape from illithids, she and her new crew in their nautiloid had to set down on Toril for repairs where they where captured by Walinda of Bane. The Banite tortured Jass crew and friends to death in front of her and Jasmine was given to the cultists of Iyachtu Xvim to pay for Walindas access to Banes sky temple. There Jasmine met Holly Harrowslough and Joel of Finder and together they escaped from the temple.\nAfter journeying to the Lost Vale, Jasmine undertook a suicide-bombing run on Banes remnant and only survived due to Finder Wyvernspurs intervention. Jasmine was captured by the cultists of Iyachtu Xvim and was given an ultimatum—die or be transformed into a savage tracker of Xvim, a dark stalker. Jas chose life and, in her new savage feathered and clawed form, was sent after her friends. She was told that with her first kill, the transformation into a dark stalker would be complete.\nJasmine resisted transformation but still was overwhelmed with savage fury and bloodlust. She gave in to the dark stalker when she saw the woman who tortured and murdered her friends, Walinda of Bane. Holly Harrowslough intervened, saving the Banite but was gravely injured by Jas. This only added to the guilt and trauma that plagued Jas life—she was convinced she was responsible for her friends death and thought that the dark stalker had won.\nEventually, Jas rejoined her friends and learned the truth of Hollys survival. Together they stopped a mad banelich who was attempting to resurrect Bane in his body. Though she never transformed completely, she still was convinced she was losing herself to the stalkers rage.\nAlong with Joel and Holly, Jasmine spent several weeks in the city of Sigil where she felt more at home than she did on Toril. By chance, Jas and Joel befriended a kender from the world of Krynn, Emilo Haversack. Together with Emilo, Joel convinced Jasmine to travel with them to Fermata, Finder Wyvernspurs realm, in hopes of cure her dark stalker condition. Finder gladly agreed to transform his friend to her old shape. Even though he polymorphed Jas out of her talons, face feathers, and owl eyes, she still felt the gnawing stalker in her soul. Finder offered to take the band to Brightwater, Tymoras realm, as she was a significantly more powerful deity and could break Xvims influence. After working through reluctance and fear, Jasmine agreed to ask for Tymoras help.\nDespite their history, Tymora lovingly embraced Jas and was happy to see the child of her beloved paladins once again. While in Brightwater, Lady Luck asked pertinent question of Jasmine, about her past and tragedies. Coming to a realization, Tymora stepped away along with Finder to discuss Jass case. Meanwhile, Jasmine and Joel imbibed bacchae wine, something Joel found strange knowing how the winged woman avoided alcohol. Under the wild Arborean influence and alcohol, Jasmines facade cracked and she broke down in tears, revealing her feelings and internal suffering. Her survivors guilt after witnessing the deaths of her friends was in the open. Joel and Emilo comforted the winged woman. Soon after, Tymora attempted her healing magics to banish the dark stalker but was interrupted by someone syphoning the goddesss power.\nIt wasnt until Emilo Haversack, who had overheard the truth whilst eavesdropping on Tymora and Finder, told her that the dalk stalker was a combination of her imagination, the disruption of her wings magic, and her bottled-up grief and guilt that Jasmine was able to overcome it. She left with Tymora to talk things over in Brightwater."
