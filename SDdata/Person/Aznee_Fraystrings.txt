'''Aznee Fraystrings''' was an infamous ill-fated traveling [[minstrel]] who spent his final days in the village of [[Hornhollow]], long before the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Aznee Fraystrings found his way to a small logging village on the outskirts of the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. During his stay, the settlement was visited by a senile geriatric [[red dragon]] named [[Craum Straug]]. The creature was afflicted with the draconic equivalent of a heavy wheezing cough, and each fit of cough was an explosion of the dragon's fiery breath that lit the village aflame. The Hornhollower folk held a lottery to determine who would approach the wyrm to negotiate, and Aznee was the unlucky winner. The inhabitants of the town felt it was no great loss if Aznee gained a new home in the dragon's belly, away from Hornhollow.

The minstrel determined the cause of the dragon's distress and attempted to brew him a tea of [[maiden's milk]] flower, a herbal cure that once helped his elderly uncle. It was believed that Aznee overestimated his knowledge of forest plants and prepared a tea of [[bellows root]] instead, an emetic herb. Craum Straug swallowed a bubbling cauldron of the remedy and instantly became violently ill, vomiting the concoction in streams of draconic flames. Aznee Fraystrings was instantly incinerated, and the dragon ended up torching several acres of the Wood of Sharp Teeth as he spent an hour being violently ill, eventually ending his old life.
