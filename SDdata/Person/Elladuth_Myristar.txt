'''Elladuth Myristar''' was the owner and innkeeper of the [[Pearl-Handled Pipe]] in [[Yartar]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Elladuth had a great love of interior design and an eye for decor. She regularly bought new pieces of furniture from merchants passing through Yartar and displayed them within her inn.

She often expanded the size of the Pearl-Handled Pipe just so it could accommodate more of her collection. The inn's attic space was full of pieces for which it simply did not have room.
