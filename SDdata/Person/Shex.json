Her body constantly decomposes, slime oozing down her frame to pool at her feet. She speaks with a slurred, muddy voice.\nTogether with the Nighthaunt Ysval, Shex was a field commander for an army of undead trying to conquer Thay in 1375 DR. She was slain by the ghost Mirror at the fight of Thazar Keep. Whether she was ultimately destroyed or just sent back to her home plane is not known.\nCategoryAngels of decay\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Thay\nCategoryInhabitants of the Unapproachable East\nCategoryInhabitants of East Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\n394t1bsimxztrj225c2kx1hpjqmi9dh"
