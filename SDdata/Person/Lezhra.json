Both items were powerful artifacts from the [[War of the Seldarine]] and wielded by the spider goddess. Upon her defeat, the ''Flame Sword'' was locked away by the gods and hidden within [[Undermountain]], and the ''spider stature'' was broken and hidden by [[Halaster Blackcloak]].\n\nLezhra and Azurna fierce fought for the favor of the goddess, with Azurna, eventually, winning."
