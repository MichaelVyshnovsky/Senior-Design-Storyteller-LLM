'''Nalaskur Thaelond''' was an innkeeper of the [[Bargewright Inn]] and a member of the [[Zhentarim]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis in [[1491 DR]].

==Activities==
From his inn, Nalaskur was able to keep tabs on all travelers. The Zhentarim also used Nalaskur's inn as a meeting point and a place for storing illicit goods en route to [[Waterdeep]].

Occasionally he would call upon one of his inn's few permanent residents, the [[vampire]] [[Arik Stillmarsh]], to dispose of unwanted guests.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} Century [[DR]], Nalaskur sent a group of adventurers to escort a beer wagon to the [[Troll in Flames]] tavern in [[Mornbryn's Shield]].

Around this same time period he had made Arik Stillmarsh agree to feed upon neither locals nor guests without the Zhentarim's approval
