        "mainbody": "'''Samblar''' was the [[wizard]] forge master proprietor of [[Samblar's Swords]] in [[Myth Drannor]]",
        "Abilities": "Samblar was a master in both enchanting and metalwork, evident by the thick [[steel]] cables that anchored his workshop and store, Samblar's Swords, in place. The wizard personally ensorcelled the cables to remain phenomenally strong, even centuries past the fall of Myth Drannor.",
        "History": "Samblar opened his store sometime before the Opening of Myth Drannor, in the {{YearlinkName|261}}.<ref name=C.EotE-p71\" />\n\nBefore the fall of Myth Drannor, the wizard worked out of a small forge on the first floor of his tower located on the [[Dragoneyes Street]], to the north from [[Castle Cormanthor]]. He created masterwork weapons and enchanted the ones he was especially proud of. His favorite enchantments were ''[[keen edge]]'' and magics that increased speed, durability, and accuracy. Samblar was a respected weaponsmith among the inhabitants of Myth Drannor, known for his fairness and impeccable skill.\n\nSamblar died in the Weeping War of [[714 DR]], defending his home from the horde of [[demon]]s and [[orc]]s of the [[Army of Darkness]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some of the adventurers who visited the ruins of the city after the War swore that Samblar's spirit returned to his [[anvil]] during the full moon and the clanking of his tools could be heard echoing through the night. Those who were brave and lucky enough to interact with the wizard's ghost claimed that he respected strength and bravery and could reward them with one of his special arms still hidden in the ruins of his tower or inside his magically sealed vault."
