Hulzimmer Atharn was one of the magelords of the kingdom of Athalantar.
He specialized in magic that transformed men into monsters, or at least gained for mages a semblance of beast-powers.
He desired to learn the secret of the dragon shape, first asking the elves of the High Forest and later the Archwizard Shandrath. Shandrath firmly rebuffed him and so Hulzimmer became obsessed with defeating Shandrath. In the end, in 222 DR, his fellow magelords agreed to attack the Wyrm Tower but in the spell-battle both Hulzimmer and Shandrath died.
