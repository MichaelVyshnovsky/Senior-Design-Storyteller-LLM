'''Hulzimmer Atharn''' was one of the [[magelord]]s of the kingdom of [[Athalantar]].

==Powers==
He specialized in magic that transformed men into monsters, or at least gained for mages a semblance of beast-powers.

==History==
He desired to learn the secret of the dragon shape, first asking the [[Elf|elves]] of the [[High Forest]] and later the [[Archwizard]] [[Shandrath]]. Shandrath firmly rebuffed him and so Hulzimmer became obsessed with defeating Shandrath. In the end, in [[222 DR]], his fellow magelords agreed to attack the [[Wyrm Tower]] but in the spell-battle both Hulzimmer and Shandrath died.<ref>{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|26-37}}
