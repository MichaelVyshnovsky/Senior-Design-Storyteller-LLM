'''Auro'pol Dyrr''' was the [[matron mother]] of [[House Agrach Dyrr]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], House Agrach Dyrr was one of several to take part in the [[Battle of Mithral Hall]] and its Matron Auro'pol Dyrr went personally to the battle together with the mastermind of the attack: [[Yvonnel Baenre|Matron Baenre]]. The defenders of [[Mithral Hall]] were fighting well and the [[drow]] army was suffering more casualties than planned, and many whispers of desertion among the drow forces reached Matron Baenre's ears.

Auro'pol entertained herself with thoughts about what the consequences would be if the old Matron died in battle. However, her thoughts were read by the [[illithid]] [[El-Viddenvelp]], who promptly reported that to Matron Baenre. The Matron Mother, already angered by the not-so-positive situation, ordered the [[glabrezu]] she'd summoned not long before to kill Auro'pol. The glabrezu caught the Matron by surprise and tore her body apart with its pincers
