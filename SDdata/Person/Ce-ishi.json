        "mainbody": "Ce-ishi was an aging shukenja and healer in the town of Aru in Wa in the 1770s on the Wa Calendar.\nHe ran an infirmary in the Castle District, overseeing three medics of lesser skill.\nHe commanded some divine magic, with a focus on healing, preparing the spells calm, cure light wounds, chant, slow poison, withdraw, cure blindness, and deaths door. The infirmary had a potion of healing in store, but Ce-ishi would only use it in an emergency.\nHe was proficient in religious knowledge and etiquette. He had some basic training in jujutsu, but did not keep weapons or armor.\nAround 1775 (1357 DR), Ce-ishi may have treated the injuries of a group of adventurers after they ambushed by ninja."
