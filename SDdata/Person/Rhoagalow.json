        "History": "During the {{yearlinkName|764}},In the ebook version of ''Temptation'', the Realmslore section declares the events of the first part to happen in around five years starting 759 DR. In the first chapter, Nuressa, the warrior, tells Elminster they're in early [[Mirtul]]. If it is assumed that the events happened in at most five and a half years, as more than five and a half years becomes around six years, then the last events in Part 1 must happen at most during [[Uktar]] of 764 DR. Given Feldrin's warning during the coronation that the Lords of Laothkund are already planning an attack, this timeline seems plausible. Further development may yet alter the result. an exhausted Rhoagalow reported at least two murders to the seneschal of Galadorna, [[Elminster Aumar]]. One of those murders, the one of the merchant [[Anlavas Jhoavryn]], he believed to be the work of [[Limmator]]. After telling Elminster of a knifing whose victim might live, he received from the seneschal a tankard of [[Burdym's Best]], which he was told to drink in private."
