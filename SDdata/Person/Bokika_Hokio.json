        "mainbody": "Bokika Hokio was a disgraced daimyo in Wa around 1357 DR\nHokio was a bitter man, living only for revenge against the shogun. He had a bad temper, always ready to explode. Hokio did not care much for administrative details.\nHokio was recruiting allies in order to gain revenge against the shogun.\nBokika was the daimyo of Juzimura. However, he granted protection to the followers of Chauntea, who were persecuted by the shoguns government, believing himself safe as nephew of the Shogun Matasuuri Nagahide.\nHe was wrong, and around 1335 DR, the shoguns army surrounded his castle, asking for the lives of Chaunteas worshipers. After a bloody and futile siege, Nagahide offered to spare Hokio and his officials, even allowing them to retain their status. However, Hokio was demoted to a tozama daimyo and granted lordship over the far and poor Fochu.\nAround 1348 DR, he was visited by the spirits of the dead priests of Chauntea, who asked him for a proper resting place for their remains. In deep secrecy, Hokio had a crypt constructed deep in his palace in Fochu and put the remains inside, killing all of his vassals involved to keep the secret.\nIn 1358 DR, in a dream, the spirits of the priests appeared again, asking for an offering of food. Hokio spoke with Chiguo Ihario, a wakadoshiyori sent by the shogun to assist and control Hokio. He told Chiguo that the spirits were followers of the Path of Enlightenment.\nWith Chiguos collaboration, Hokio hired a foreign adventuring party to solve the matter."
