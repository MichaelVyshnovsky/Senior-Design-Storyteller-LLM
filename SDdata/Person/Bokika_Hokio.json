        "mainbody": "'''Bokika Hokio''' was a disgraced [[daimyo]] in [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR]]",
        "Personality": "Hokio was a bitter man, living only for revenge against the shogun. He had a bad temper, always ready to explode. Hokio did not care much for administrative details.",
        "Activities": "Hokio was recruiting allies in order to gain revenge against the shogun.",
        "History": "Bokika was the daimyo of [[Juzimura]]. However, he granted protection to the followers of [[Chauntea]], who were persecuted by the [[shogun]]'s government, believing himself safe as nephew of the Shogun [[Matasuuri Nagahide]].\n\nHe was wrong, and around [[1335 DR]], the shogun's army surrounded his castle, asking for the lives of Chauntea's worshipers. After a bloody and futile siege, Nagahide offered to spare Hokio and his officials, even allowing them to retain their status. However, Hokio was demoted to a [[tozama daimyo]] and granted lordship over the far and poor [[Fochu]].\n\nAround [[1348 DR]], he was visited by the spirits of the dead priests of Chauntea, who asked him for a proper resting place for their remains. In deep secrecy, Hokio had a crypt constructed deep in his palace in Fochu and put the remains inside, killing all of his vassals involved to keep the secret.\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], in a dream, the spirits of the priests appeared again, asking for an offering of food. Hokio spoke with [[Chiguo Ihario]], a [[wakadoshiyori]] sent by the shogun to assist and control Hokio. He told Chiguo that the spirits were followers of the [[Path of Enlightenment]].\n\nWith Chiguo's collaboration, Hokio hired a foreign adventuring party to solve the matter."
