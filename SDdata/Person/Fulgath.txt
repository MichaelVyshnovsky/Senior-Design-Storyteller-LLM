'''Fulgath''' was a male [[human]] merchant from [[Dagger Falls]] that owned [[Fulgath's Caravan Supplies]]. He was well known for both his high prices and wide range of equipment.

==Description==
Fulgath always appeared to be quietly chuckling to himself when customers arrived.

==Personality==
Widely disliked among the folk of [[Dagger Falls]], Fulgath happily over-charged any patrons who came to his shop, as he knew had a monopoly on caravan goods. Throughout his career, Fulgath had been dishonest and curt in his dealings with others.

==Activities==
Ever dealing in underhand businesses, Fulgath would use whatever means he could to make more coin. He regularly charged a 200% markup on most of his goods. The merchant was the only individual in town that dealt in stolen goods and even [[poison]]s, many of which he would gladly procure from corpses.

==History==
===Zhent occupation===
During the [[Zhent]] occupation of [[Dagger Falls]], much trade to the market square was stifled and gave Fulgath a near-monopoly on many goods. This meant Fulgath was able to easily charge over the odds for his goods and was garnering a markup of 200% by [[1367 DR]].

===Return of Randal Morn===
After [[Randal Morn]] reclaimed the town in [[1369 DR]] and the market began to prosper again, Fulgath took to stealing and even vandalizing the competition's goods from the stall-keepers. Fulgath was eventually caught by priests of [[Lathander]] and after a stern dressing down and fine by [[Harndarr Oryn]] his activities stopped.

Eventually, by late [[1369 DR]], Fulgath was forced to relent to the growing competition of the Market and had to cut back on his selection of goods and even slightly lower his extortionate prices.
