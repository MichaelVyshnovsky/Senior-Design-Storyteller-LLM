Asper was an inhabitant of Waterdeep and the wife of Mirt around 1373 DR.
Asper was a lithe and petite beautiful woman.
She was soft-spoken but daring and merry in nature.
She followed the teachings of Lady Luck, Tymora.
Asper was Mirts near-constant companion, but during her free time, she adventured with the Gray Hands, aka Force Grey, so often she was treated as an honorary member.
Mirt often sent or accompanied her on missions to Skullport, where together, they battled the beholder Xuzoun and awoke the dragon, Vulharindauloth.
Her preferred weapon was a bow.
Mirt rescued her when she was a babe from a sacked city and raised her. He considered her his little girl even though he later married her.
