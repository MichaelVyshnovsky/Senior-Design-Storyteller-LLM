'''Asper''' was an inhabitant of [[Waterdeep]] and the wife of [[Mirt]] around [[1373 DR]].

{{quote|''I have known high honor, proud fame, and great riches, and have drunk deep of good [[wine]] at feasts where my mouth watered and my belly was filled with delightful viands amid good fellowship and conversation... and I tell you that all these pale and drift away as idle dreams before the gentle touch of my Lady.''|Excerpt from Mirt the Moneylender's letter to [[Khelben Arunsun]], [[1355 DR]]}}

==Description==
Asper was a lithe and petite beautiful woman.

==Personality==
She was soft-spoken but daring and merry in nature.

She followed the teachings of Lady Luck, [[Tymora]].

==Activities==
Asper was Mirt's near-constant companion, but during her free time, she adventured with the [[Gray Hands]], aka [[Force Grey]], so often she was treated as an honorary member.

Mirt often sent or accompanied her on missions to [[Skullport]], where together, they battled the beholder [[Xuzoun]] and awoke the dragon, [[Vulharindauloth]].

Her preferred weapon was a bow.

==History==
Mirt rescued her when she was a babe from a sacked city and raised her. He considered her his little girl even though he later married her.<ref>
