Morbaat was a female vrock sent to uncover a legendary bloodforge for General Raachaak circa 1371 DR.
In 1371 DR, Morbaat, Shaakat, and Rejik were ordered by General Raachaak to find a way into the city in the Utter East that contained a fabled bloodforge. Morbaat stood out of line when she asked Raachaak if the vrocks were better off capturing the bloodforge instead of simply scouting the way into the city. In punishment, the vrock was stomped into the ground by the general and slashed with his fiery whip until she stopped screaming and ceased convulsing in agony.
