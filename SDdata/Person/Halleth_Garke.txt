Halleth Garke was a revenant adventurer in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Halleth was once an adventuring cleric of Waukeen and a member of the Fine Fellows, an adventuring company from Daggerford.
In 1492 DR, Halleth and his fellows descended into Undermountain. There, after Kelim became lost, Halleth accused his three remaining companions of withholding treasures from him, so the three beat Halleth to death and threw his body into a pit. However, Halleth rose as a revenant in order to have vengeance. Unfortunately, he was unable to get out of the pit without help. If Halleth managed to have his vengeance, he finally died for good.
