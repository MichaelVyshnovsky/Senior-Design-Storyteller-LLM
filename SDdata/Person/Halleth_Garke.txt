'''Halleth Garke''' was a [[revenant]] adventurer in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
Halleth was once an adventuring [[cleric]] of [[Waukeen]] and a member of the [[Fine Fellows]], an adventuring company from [[Daggerford]].

In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Halleth and his fellows descended into Undermountain. There, after [[Kelim]] became lost, Halleth accused his three remaining companions of withholding treasures from him, so the three beat Halleth to death and threw his body into a pit. However, Halleth rose as a revenant in order to have vengeance. Unfortunately, he was unable to get out of the pit without help. If Halleth managed to have his vengeance, he finally died for good.
