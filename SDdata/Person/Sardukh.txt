Mintar
Sardukh was a lich inhabiting the small island of Talagath on the strait of Talagaths Gauntlet during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The lich maintained a secret stronghold somewhere on, or under, the island. He did not welcome anyone staying on his island for more than a brief period, often sending magical creatures to encourage visitors to execute a hasty retreat.
Sardukh was once a member of the Magelords of Mintar.
