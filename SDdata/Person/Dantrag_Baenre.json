However, this attitude was largely due to Dantrags highly developed sense of pride he believed that no-one could best him in melee combat. Dantrag was the second-boy of House Baenre, behind his brother Gromph Baenre, the archmage of Menzoberranzan. However, he had no aspirations to usurp his brothers status. The only role he desired was that of Principle Master of Melee-Magthere, a position he was not allowed to acquire by his matron mother, Yvonnel Baenre, owing to his usefulness as weapons master of House Baenre.\nAs a son of Yvonnel Baenre, Dantrag was related to many influential drow figures. His four most notable siblings were Triel Baenre, Quenthel Baenre, Jarlaxle of Bregan Daerthe, and Gromph Baenre the archmage. Dantrag also trained his brother Berginyon, who was another warrior of notable skill he took his elder brothers place as weapons master after Dantrag was killed by Drizzt.\nDantrag had a grandson named Tiago Baenre.\nUthegentel DelArmgo, a skilled fighter, was considered Dantrags greatest rival.\nDantrag was considered the most formidable warrior in the city once Zaknafein was dead. Dantrag always envied Zaknafeins reputation, and had a great desire to best him in combat however, Zaknafein was sacrificed to Lolth before the two could meet in combat. \nIn 1357 DR, Dantrag did, however, get the opportunity to challenge Zaknafeins son, Drizzt DoUrden, the famed renegade. As Drizzt attempted to escape the Underdark with Catti-brie and Artemis Entreri, Dantrag attacked him in a tunnel, leading to an epic confrontation of swordsmanship. Ultimately, Drizzt proved the superior warrior (largely due to his fathers training), and Dantrag was killed by Drizzt in the Underdark passage.\nLike most drow nobles, Dantrag wore a suit of drow chainmail, which was like a protective second skin. Dantrag wore a pair of bracers of the blinding strike on his wrists, which allowed him to wield his two longswords with incredible speed. However, even with, and indeed, because of these enchanted bracers, he was no match for Drizzt, and upon Dantrags defeat they passed into the renegade drows hands. Drizzt believed the bracers threw him off balance in combat, and that the bracers made him slash so rapidly that he couldnt change the direction of his attacks, and that this had been Dantrags downfall. \nDantrag also possessed the sentient sword Khazidhea, which was forged by the surface elves. How this sword came into his possession is unknown, but after his death it returned to the surface in the hands of Catti-brie."
