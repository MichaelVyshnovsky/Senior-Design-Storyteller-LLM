'''Frezaail''' was an old male [[dragon]] who dwelled in the vicinity of [[Ironspur]] in the [[Galena Mountains]] ''circa'' [[1351 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1351}}, the adventuring mercenary named [[Skullcrusher (Phlan)|Skullcrusher]], who originally hailed from the city of [[Phlan]], tangled with Frezaail's mate in a memorable event of which he reminisced in his twilight years. By the adventurer's description, Frezaail was an infamous "old bastard."
