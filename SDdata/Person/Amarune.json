Amarune and her children were little involved in the hunt for [[Shandril Shessair]].\n\nIn [[1370]], the [[Unseen]] discovered her secret and forced her to collaborate with them in exchange for their silence.\n\nIn later years Amarune engineered the kidnapping and the disappearance of her \"[[Hulraven Irlingstar|husband]]\" and ordered the killing of many members of the [[Irlingstar]] family. She later allowed herself to be discovered by the [[War Wizards]] of [[Cormyr]] who put her in the prison of [[Castle Irlingstar]]. However Amarune escaped and started traveling in [[Western Heartlands]] and using guile, seduction, and murder, she amassed great wealth and influence.{{Cite dungeon/206/Ecology of the Malaugrym|1-6}}",
