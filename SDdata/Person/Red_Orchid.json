        "mainbody": "The '''''Red Orchid''''' was a ship sunk in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] by the exiled [[eladrin]] [[Caelynna]].\n\nThe ship was touched by the [[Spellplague]] and made sentient. For over eighty years, she remained in Cealynna's domain, unable to move, until [[Kwan Shang-Li]]'s crew found the ship and removed the figurehead and attached it to their own ship. The ''Red Orchid''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s spirit helped the crew to refloat their ship. When Cealynna attacked the ship, the figurehead fought a giant squid ally of Cealynna.",
