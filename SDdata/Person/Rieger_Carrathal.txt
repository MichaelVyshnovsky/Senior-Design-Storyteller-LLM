'''Rieger Carrathal''' was High King of [[Callidyrr]] for a brief time in the mid-to-late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|33}} Like his predecessors, although he held the title of High King of the [[Moonshae Isles]], he was considered to be merely a figurehead by the [[Ffolk]] outside of Callidyrr.

==Relationships==
He was a member of the [[Carrathal Dynasty]] and was the second son of his predecessor, [[Teldin Carrathal|King Teldin]]. His eventual successor was his first son, [[Benjamin Carrathal|Benjamin]].

==History==
Rieger assumed the throne in the {{YearlinkName|1271}}, after the death of his father. He ruled for only two years before inexplicably disappearing without a trace in the {{YearlinkName|1273}}. His subsequent fate and date of death were not known to scholars.
