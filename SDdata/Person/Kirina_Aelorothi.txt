|I am the priestess Kirina Aelorothi, of the [[Brotherhood of the Glorious Sun]]. I was here  with a group of travelling companions, but we were separated in a battle, and I've not been able to find any of them since.

|I have some martial skill, but my focus in the Brotherhood was the mastery of healing. I haven't much luck in battling the creatures in these caves alone, so when I found this place, I decided to make camp and hope they could find me.
|Kirina}}
Around the time of the [[Darkening]], Kirina and her companions [[Jarus Brithandir]], [[Popkin Shortshanks]], [[Liantor Stoneborn]], [[Helayna]], and [[Tristran of Daggerford]] discovered a freshly-unearthed [[Netherese tomb (Stonelands)|ancient tomb]] at the bottom of a crevasse in the [[Stonelands]]. They initially fought their way past some [[undead]] inhabitants, then discovered a secret passage leading deeper underground. After passing into a deeper cave system, the group was ambushed by a small army of [[Clan Daeronnax]] [[kobold]]s, who were able to overwhelm the group. The sneaky Popkin managed to escape to the surface and returned to [[Eveningstar]] to get help, but the rest of the party was lost in the caves.

Separated in the dark and unable to fight her way out, Kirina hid in a sheltered nook in the caves, hoping that she would be rescued before the kobolds found her. Fortunately, Popkin's help showed up on time and delivered a ''[[word of recall]]''-infused trinket, sending Kirina back to Eveningstar immediately to reunite with her friends.
