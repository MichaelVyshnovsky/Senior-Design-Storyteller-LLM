Komar al-Anni was a historical inhabitant of Zakhara.
Komar bravely sacrificed his life to save a group of pilgrims from a group of bloodthirsty jann. After his death, the Shrine of the Brave was erected along the Pilgrims Route to honor his memory.
Komars spirit was said to send useful visions to warriors who stayed at the shrine, offering valuable advice on future battles.
