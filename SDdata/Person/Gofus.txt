'''Gofus''', also known as '''Gofin''', was a fisher from the island of [[Chawdik]] in the [[Korinn Archipelago]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Gofus was a [[gnome]] and a proficient fisher and netter. They knew how to use [[dagger]]s when the need to defend themselves arose. The fisher lacked in strength but was a charismatic individual who spoke several languages: [[Common]], [[Dwarvish]], [[Gnomish]], [[halfling language|Halfling]], [[Goblin language|Goblin]], and [[Kobold language|Kobold]].

==History==
In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], at the age of 319, Gofus was among other inhabitants of the Korinn Archipelago, captured by a gang of slavers. While sailing across the [[Sea of Swords]], the ship was hit by a squall and ended up a wreck. Gofus and several other slaves had washed ashore on the [[Island of Viledel]]. There, the group faced the challenges of survival, eventually escaping the doomed island. It was unknown if Gofus survived the misadventure.
