Milsantos Daramos was the Tharchion of Thazalhar in Thay throughout the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Milsantos was born in the early&ndash14 century DR. In his later years, he was an old man with a lined face and shaggy white brows. He always wore his plate armor adorned with magical runes. A kite shield, helmet, and broadsword or lance, magically enchanted as well, completed his combat gear.
Milsantos was a true Thayan patriot, and wished to see him homeland united and at peace. Although a proficient killer, he did not enjoy fighting but rather saw it as the only means of protecting his peoples interests. He was also a just ruler, at least by Thayan standards.
He was a seasoned warrior and had a reputation for being the canniest commander in Thay.

Even as he neared his sixtieth year, he spent little time at his capital in Pyarados and personally led three small troops of cavalry&mdashknown to be the hardest-riding in all of Thay&mdashagainst marauding monsters. He was known to personally collect fees and tolls from travelers&mdashmuch of which was paid at the bridge over the River of Dawn&mdashand he preferring to be paid in gems and other items of value that he could carry on his person. During this time, he was officially neutral in the growing tension between Szass Tams supporters and enemies.
During the War of the Zulkirs, Daramos served as an important ally of the Council of Zulkirs until he died of old age in the .
