'''Milsantos Daramos''' was the [[Tharchion]] of [[Thazalhar]] in [[Thay]] throughout the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Milsantos was born in the early&ndash;14{{th}} century DR. In his later years, he was an old man with a lined face and shaggy white brows. He always wore his [[plate armor]] adorned with [[magic]]al runes. A [[kite shield]], [[helmet]], and [[broadsword]] or [[lance]], magically [[enchanted]] as well, completed his combat gear.

==Personality==
{{fq
| text = Then we draw <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Ysval]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> out using ourselves as bait. You and I descend from these battlements, forsaking the wards the mages cast to protect us. We mount our horses, and with a relatively small band of followers, break through the ranks of the enemy. Then we charge toward the central keep as though in a final desperate, defiant attempt to challenge the power that holds it. You know, chivalry. The kind of idiocy that loses battles and gets warriors killed.

Milsantos was a true Thayan patriot, and wished to see him homeland united and at peace. Although a proficient killer, he did not enjoy fighting but rather saw it as the only means of protecting his people's interests. He was also a just ruler, at least by Thayan standards.

==Abilities==
He was a seasoned warrior and had a reputation for being the canniest commander in Thay.

==Relationships==
Milsantos established the [[Daramos]] family as one of the youngest [[noble]] houses of Thay during the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR. As of {{Yearlink|1357}}, the family comprised himself, his wife, and their two young children. His only daughter was named [[Mantorra Daramos|Mantorra]].

He opposed [[Szass Tam]]'s aspirations to rule over all of Thay, although he was wise enough not to do so openly for most of his career. In some ways he appreciated Tam's actions in so far as he believed that only hatred of Tam could possibly unite his fructuous homeland. Other Tharchions were liable to see him as growing soft in his later years.

==History==
As Tharchion of Thazalhar, it was his duty to ensure the safety of caravans passing through his territory to and from [[Mulhorand]]. Even as he neared his sixtieth year, he spent little time at his capital in [[Pyarados]] and personally led three small troops of cavalry&mdash;known to be the hardest-riding in all of Thay&mdash;against marauding monsters. He was known to personally collect fees and tolls from travelers&mdash;much of which was paid at the bridge over the [[River of Dawn]]&mdash;and he preferring to be paid in [[gem]]s and other items of value that he could carry on his person. During this time, he was officially neutral in the growing tension between Szass Tam's supporters and enemies.

During the [[War of the Zulkirs]], Daramos served as an important ally of the [[Council of Zulkirs]] until he died of old age in the {{YearlinkName|1382}}.
