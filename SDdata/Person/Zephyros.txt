Zephyros was an eccentric cloud giant wizard sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Zephyros was very open-minded to "small folks".
Zephyros lived in his floating Tower of Zephyros.
For fifty years, he studied the Moonshae Isles. In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, after the shattering of the ordning, Zephyros started working to find a solution for this crisis using the contact other plane spell. This somehow led him to Nightstone village just after some others cloud giants had bombarded the place. Zephyros was instructed by a Planar Sphere creature that an adventuring party he would find there could reconstruct the ordning.
