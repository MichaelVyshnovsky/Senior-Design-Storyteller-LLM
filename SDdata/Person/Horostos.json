        "mainbody": "igh Duke Horostos was the ruler of Langalos on the Dragon Coast in the midâ€“8 century DR.\nHe chafed at the challenges posed by the Slayers presence, and wasnt keen on following the lead of the Harpers.\nHe was known to hunt.\nAs the ruler of the High Duchy of Langalos, he styled himself lord over the lands west of Starmantle and had his castle there.\nHis seneschals name was Bresmer.\nIn the , by the end of winter and the start of spring, the High Duchy of Langalos became haunted by an enigmatic entity known as the Slayer. Though High Duke Horostos had posted a great reward for it, and sent even war bands of his own men, no-one succeeded. Even after sending a band of adventurers, the Frostfire Banner, nothing that entered the forests where the Slayer resided returned.\nAfter running out of ideas and finding no more adventurers willing to investigate, High Duke Horostos was informed by his seneschal that the Harpers were going to investigate. Though the Duke didnt take kindly to it, he was open to at least waiting on the results of their investigation.\nJust after the Slayer was laid low while attacking Elminster Aumar, a Chosen of Mystra, the High Duke tried instead sending a huge, armed caravan through the forest to see what would happen."
