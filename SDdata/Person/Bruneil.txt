'''Bruneil''' was a [[human]] soldier of [[Fort Locke]] near the [[Mere of Dead Men]] on the [[Sword Coast North]].

==History==
Bruneil was one of [[Fort Locke]]'s newest soldiers (who did not want to become a merchant) that went with [[Tann]] and his men to patrol. However, they were captured by the [[Unnamed shadow priest|shadow priest]]. Repko was cornered, as the room he was in was occupied by hostile undead. The [[Kalach-Cha]] and [[Tann]] could've rescued him.
