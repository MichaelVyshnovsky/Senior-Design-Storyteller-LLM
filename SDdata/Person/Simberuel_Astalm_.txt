'''Simberuel Astalmé''' was one of the last princes of [[Ascalhorn]].

==History==
In [[882 DR]], Prince Simberuel Astalmé led a group of [[human]] refugees from the fallen kingdom of Ascalhorn.  Attacked by [[vrock]] [[demon]]s in the [[Turnstone Pass]], the [[dwarves]] of [[Citadel Sundbarr]] came to the rescue. During the battle, Astalmé gave his life to save the [[Forgemaster of Sundbarr]] and, in gratitude, the dwarves offered the humans a home in the abandoned surface portions of the citadel and over time build and founded the settlement of [[Sundabar]].
