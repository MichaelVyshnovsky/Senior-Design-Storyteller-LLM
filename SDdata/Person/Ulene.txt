'''Ulene''' was one of the three [[dryads]] enslaved by [[Jon Irenicus]] and trapped in his [[Jon Irenicus's Dungeon|dungeon]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

{{quote|''So beautiful! I used to dream of dryads and their beautiful trees... I used to dream... but he doesn't. Your charms don't work on him anymore, do they?''|[[Imoen]]}}

==Description==
Ulene had fair skin and long black hair.

==History==
Ulene, [[Elyme]], and [[Cania (dryad)|Cania]] were captured by the cruel [[archmage]] Jon Irenicus sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. He trapped the dryads by transporting their [[oak]] trees into his dungeon underneath the city of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]]. Ulene and her fellow slaves were used as concubines and playthings. When [[Abdel Adrian]] escaped his capture, he encountered the three dryads begins for his aid. The only way for Ulene, Elyme, and Cania to escape was through their trees. They asked the Bhaalspawn to bring acorns from their trees back to the [[Fairy Queen]] of the [[Windspear Hills]], who would be able to drop the oaks, allowing the dryads to step through their trees to freedom and allowing the captured trees in the dungeon to wilt away and die. It was unrecorded if Ulene was ever granted her freedom.
