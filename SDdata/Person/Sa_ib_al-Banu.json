        "Activities": "He experienced a strong vision once while adventuring within the [[Cities of the Ancients]] where the [[Zakharan pantheon|Pantheist]] gods revealed that his hair was a filthy trait and should be shorn from his body if he wished to attain spiritual perfection. Despite being openly ridiculed for his new belief system, Sa'ib gained a strong following in Talab until he and his followers were exiled for smuggling weapons. [[Fate]] guided Sa'ib and his followers to Moradask where they could prosper without harassment. It was here that Sa'ib discovered a shrine to [[Ishistu]], a savage albino rat god. The idol of Ishistu lacked any body hair and Sa'ib took this as a sign to begin worship the rat god.",
