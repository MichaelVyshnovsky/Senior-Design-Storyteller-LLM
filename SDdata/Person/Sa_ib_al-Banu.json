        "mainbody": "Imam Saib al-Banu was a high priest and wererat inhabiting the ruined city of Moradask on the Sea of Salt in the Haunted Lands of interior Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nHe stood  tall and was heavily muscled. He habitually shaved all of the hair from his body.\nSaib was quiet but spoke with wisdom and authority.\nHe was originally from Talab in the Cities of the Pantheon and received his training as a mystic there.\nHe experienced a strong vision once while adventuring within the Cities of the Ancients where the Pantheist gods revealed that his hair was a filthy trait and should be shorn from his body if he wished to attain spiritual perfection. Despite being openly ridiculed for his new belief system, Saib gained a strong following in Talab until he and his followers were exiled for smuggling weapons. Fate guided Saib and his followers to Moradask where they could prosper without harassment. It was here that Saib discovered a shrine to Ishistu, a savage albino rat god. The idol of Ishistu lacked any body hair and Saib took this as a sign to begin worship the rat god.\nSaib usually had the following spells memorized bless, command, cure light wounds, detect evil, endure heat, light, aid, augury, continual light, hold person, know alignment, silence, 15 radius, withdraw, wyvern watch, create food and water, dispel magic, glyph of warding, prayer, protection from fire, starshine, cure serious wounds, divination, protection from evil, flame strike, raise dead, blade barrier, heal.\nHe carried several magic items including armor of command, a shield of the holy, a magic scimitar giant slayer, a ring of spell turning, and a potion of extra-healing. Saib also armed himself with a mace, jambiya, a sling, and a razor."
