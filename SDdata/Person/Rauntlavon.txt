Rauntlavon was an apprentice mage to Iyriklaunavan in the midâ€“8 century DR.
Rauntlavon was young, and almost certainly a teenager.
Feeling attracted to Ladylord Nuressa, he wished he was older, stronger, and better-looking than what he was. As such, he had a certain admiration for his master Iyriklaunavans elven grace and gruff manner.
His skills at magic were enough to help steady his masters spells.
He studied sorcery under Iyriklaunavan, whom he admired.
During the chaos of the Art in , Rauntlavon helped his master steady a farscrying spell the result was only catastrophic enough to scare the Ladylord Nuressa, one of the four Lords of the Castle, into coming. There was much talk, and Rauntlavon learned that Ladylord Nuressa had been a slave, and that the four Lords of the Castle had found the deed to it once one of them slept in a shrine to Mystra after gambling away all their coin and trying to steal some of it back. More importantly, he learned that his master had seen Azuth battling off mages and staring at a ghostly sorceress trying to kill a Chosen of Mystra who was known to the Four Lords of the Castle, for theyd disturbed the tomb where hed been held in stasis. He was also made aware that if he blabbed about any of those things hed need to find a new home. In turn, he told the two Lords that the castle had been built with magic, and would be in danger if the chaos of the Art grew any more dire.
