'''Rucksam''' was a [[wizard]] that traveled across the [[Sword Coast North]] during the early 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|That'll teach me to make a bet against a drunken wizard.|[[Fergus Gunderson]], on his interactions with Rucksam.}}

==Abilities==
In addition to his wizarding ways, Rucksam was fond of traveling to local taverns and making bets with local townsfolk. Whenever passing through [[Rothé Valley]] he made sure to stop by its [[Rothé Valley Village|local village]].

==Relationships==
He took on a [[Gunderson|boy]] from [[Rothé Valley Village]] as his traveling ward, brining him along on his journeys in [[the North]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1429}}, Rucksam created his own namesake tunnel in Rothé Valley in order to gain quicker passage between its village and some nearby farms. This won him a wager with the old farmer [[Fergus Gunderson]]. Local farmers were taken aback at the appearance of a new and mysterious passageway but accepted the traveling wizard's explanation.
