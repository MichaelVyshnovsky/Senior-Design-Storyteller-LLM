        "mainbody": "'''Akhlaur''' was a powerful [[conjurer]] and [[necromancer]] who lived in [[Halruaa]] during the midâ€“12{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref group=\"note\">While Akhlaur was originally stated and statted to be a conjurer in ''The Shining South'' (1993), the novel ''The Magehound'' makes him a necromancer and ''Shining South'' (2004) follows suit. While this may retcon the existing lore, he is not given a necromancer class and his exploits are still based on conjuration magic. Therefore, this article presumes he is a conjurer who also practiced necromancy.",
        "Activities": "Akhlaur was only interested in increasing his power by researching dangerous magic. He eventually summoned a [[laraken]] that was beyond his control and he was taken against his will back to the creature's native [[plane]].\n\nAkhlaur's disappearance left a permanent gateway open to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]], causing an unending flow of water to pour forth into the area known as [[Akhlaur's Swamp]]. [[Akhlaur's Tower]], which contained a wealth of [[magic item]]s, was also found here.",
        "Possessions": "This powerful conjurer was rumored to own magical items that most [[wizard]]s only dreamed about, leading to a steady supply of adventurers delving deep into Akhlaur's Swamp with hopes of finding priceless treasure.",
        "History": "In their youth, Ahklaur and [[Zalathorm Kirkson]] worked together to develop a [[spell]] that granted them both everlasting life.\n\nAklhaur was rescued in [[1373 DR]] thanks to the efforts of the [[wild elf]] [[halruaan magehound|magehound]] [[Kiva]] and the [[sorcerer|sorceress]] [[Tzigone]]. After being released from the portal, Aklhaur launched an attack against Halruaa, triggering the [[Wizardwar]]. During the battle, Ahklaur faced Zalathorm, and they killed each other."
