        "Personality": "Derval was a gruff and loud individual who could come off as rude but, in reality, was friendly, and full of crude jokes. He referred to [[elf|elves]] as \"tree huggers\" in jest.",
        "Relationships": "Derval had three children who worked as stonemasons.\n\nDerval and his daughter [[Veiti Ironeater]] shared a loving relationship even though they were quite different. Derval preferred for his daughter to work the forge and hone her skills rather than adventure or dream about the past glories of Illefarn, a trait he thought both Veiti and her mother shared.\n\nHe was the grandfather of [[Ignal Ironeater]], who had been his proxy at meetings with the Smiths' Guild for decades.",
        "Possessions": "Derval possessed a ''+1 [[battleaxe]]'', a ''+3 [[hammer]]'', a set of ''+1 [[plate mail]]'', a [[shield]], and a ''[[ring of telekinesis]]''.",
        "History": "Derval traveled to Daggerford with his brothers [[Derwin Stonecarver|Derwin]] and [[Korin Ironaxe|Korin]] and their families around [[1270 DR]]. Korin disappeared in [[1350 DR]] and they never heard from him again. Clues suggested the [[dwarven]] brothers originated from [[Illefarn]].\n\nBy 1370 DR, Derval was a respected blacksmith, councilor, guildmaster, and the proprietor of [[Derval's Bright Blade]], working there alongside with his daughter, Veiti Ironeater.\n\nHe lived in a house in the south section of Daggerford near the drill field.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}\n\nDerval died in late [[1484 DR]]."
