        "mainbody": "Snake was a grizzled lizardman guide who lived and worked inside the Wheloon Prison in the late 15 century DR.\nSnake had green scales mottled with red, wore a notable eyepatch over his left eye, and carried a scroll about.\nThe lizardman was quite satisfied with knowing all the secret ways in and out of Wheloon, and being paid for it. He had a particular taste for young live vipers, his favorite meal and source of his nickname.\nSnake lurked inside the Wheloon drainage culverts, hired by the magistrates of the prison to act as a guide for Cormyrean allies, and was paid even more to not tell anyone else about the secret tunnels and caves he knew of."
