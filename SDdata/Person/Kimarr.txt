'''Kimarr''' was an ambitious and power-hungry [[mage]] and traitor to the city of [[Phlan]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1350}}, mages Kimarr and [[Quil]] of Phlan were sent on an expedition to find the legendary [[Taydome's Keep]], an ancient hold that guarded powerful [[magic]]s. The keep was discovered in the [[Shaar]] just before the city of Phlan, and other settlements on the shores of the [[Moonsea]] were spirited away by the allied forces of the evil deity [[Bane]]. Council member [[Sasha (Council of Ten)|Sasha]] and her bodyguards had left Phlan just before the city disappeared and were heading to Taydome's Keep after receiving a word from the two mages. The [[Council of Ten]] hoped to take the keep and use it as a stronghold.

The keep was found to have once been home to Lord [[Taydome]], who weaved a magical contract with [[ogre]]s and [[giant]]s of antiquity into the castle's walls. Kimarr discovered a [[scroll]] penned by Taydome that allowed for the use of the contract and its magic for enslaving giants with whom the original agreement was struck. Seeing an opportunity, Kimarr recited spells several times daily, enslaving more giants with each casting. Under his control, the keep's giants captured Councilmember Sasha once she arrived to inspect the new holding.

Kimarr knew of Sasha's value and used her as a bargaining chip in dealing with Bane's forces. However, Quil, still loyal to the Council, stole the spell scroll from his old ally and hid away within the keep's hidden passages and tunnels. Subsequently, Sasha was freed by the heroes of Phlan, with Quil's aid, while Kimarr was presumed slain after he transformed himself into a fierce [[blue dragon]].
