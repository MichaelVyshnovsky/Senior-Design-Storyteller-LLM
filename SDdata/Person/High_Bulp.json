        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, High Bulp could be found wandering around the [[Temple of Cyric (Undermountain)|Temple of Cyric]] on the [[Dungeon Level]] of Undermountain. The insane undead was rambling, talking to itself or an unseen apparition while smashing its head against cave walls, screaming curses and hatred towards the goddess of magic, [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]]. Even a mention of the goddess's name sent the undead loon into a fit of frenzy. When the hero of Undermountain named  [[Khelbenite]] came across the mad creature, they thought of the wet smashing sound of High Bulp's head as reminiscent of the hero's mother picking [[melon]]s in the markets of [[Waterdeep]]. In his demented state, the ghoul thought itself to be a famous and all-powerful man and demanded awe and respect."
