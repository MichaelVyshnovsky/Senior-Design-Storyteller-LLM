'''Shi'drin Philiom''' was a fanatic priest of [[Ghaunadaur]] in [[Llurth Dreir]].

==Activities==
Shi'drin was a member of [[House Philiom]] in Llurth Dreir and the second-in-command of [[Molvayas]]'s group.

==History==
In [[1379 DR]], he questioned [[Kâras]] about Molvayas's disappearance but Kâras said he was killed by a priest of [[House Abbylan]]. Shi'drin didn't question any further, happy to become the new Eater of Filth of the House.
