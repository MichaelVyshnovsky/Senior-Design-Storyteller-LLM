        "mainbody": "Nora was one of the curious intelligent wombats who could speak, like an awakened animal, who lived on an island off the coast of Orlil, Lantan, in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nLike other wombats (and an occasional platypus) of the island she lived on, Nora was effectively an awakened creature. She was a younger sister of Byrt, a wombat friend of Artus Cimber. Nora was described by her brother as rather large and mean.\nIn 1362 DR, shortly after Artus Cimber was thrown into the lair of a Batiri \"god\" in Chult, he met wombats Byrt and Lugg. The trio faced Grumog, a giant lizard-centipede monstrosity that the goblins were worshiping. Byrt compared the creature to his dear kid sister Nora."
