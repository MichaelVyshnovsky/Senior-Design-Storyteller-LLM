        "mainbody": "\"Rhauron\" was mysterious and notorious individual who lived on Tarsith, in the Dusk Ports of Laerakond, in the decade of the 1480s DR.\nNobody knew anything concrete about this individual. Although many Faerûnians believed this \"Rhauron\" was Asgandur Durhauron, the innkeeper of the Dragonhaven Hearth in Proskur, Elminster Aumar knew that this man was in fact a Laerakondan from Tarsith, however not even he was sure who this individual was. Many urban legends surrounded this mysterious man, and in the Dusk Ports it was believed that he was either a powerful archmage, a psion, a guildmaster or an investor of some sort. Nobody knew even his true name, and people gave him various aliases or titles, \"Rhauron\" being the name that Elminster made up for him.\nIt was believed that \"Rhauron\" was the one who created, and later controlled, the mysterious artifacts known as the Winking Eyes of Rhauron, and then procured those gems to Faerûn in order to kill specific people in that continent, including some Waterdavian nobles and merchants.\nIn the decade of the 1480s, the story of \"Rhauron\" became popular in Faerûn, and many people credited the bard Lothlyn Arngoblet as the creator of this \"tale\". Many believed Lothlyn had demonized Asgandur in his songs, because Asgandur didnt pay the bard for his services on one occasion.\nCategoryInhabitants of Tarsith\nCategoryInhabitants of the Dusk Ports\nCategoryInhabitants of Laerakond\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nooxem63by5cfkt346bw6r8uqsap4y9l"
