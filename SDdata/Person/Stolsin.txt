'''Stolsin''', the '''Grinder of Tribes''', was a [[Rashemi]] [[barbarian]] working for [[Sathra]] in [[Laothkund]] until {{yearlink|1375}}. He was slain by [[Gage]],{{cite book/Stardeep|51|5}} raised, and then slain again.

==Description==
Stolsin was a towering man with thickly muscled arms, and many tattoos that marked him as a member of the tribes of [[Rashemen]]. His beard was festooned with stone trinkets.

In death, his tattoos writhed and squirmed as if with life of their own, and tendrils of shadow appeared to animate him. His maul and mouth also dripped with an inky miasma, and his tongue was swollen and dry.{{cite book/Stardeep|115-118|10}}

==Personality==
While alive, Stolsin was dangerously boisterous, continuing to extol his deeds even during combat. In death, not so much.

==Abilities==
In life, Stolsin handled an immense, gray stone maul without trouble. He still did so in death, also feeling no pain.

==Possessions==
Stolsin carried around an immense maul as his weapon.

==Activities==
Stolsin became a thug for [[Sathra]] of the [[Shadow Tongue]] in [[Laothkund]] until {{yearlink|1375}}. He continued to serve under her for a little time after dying.

==History==
By {{yearlink|1375}}, Stolsin had destroyed walking dead in the outskirts of [[Thay]], and dared the cold drake's icy lair somewhere. While working as one of Sathra's Shadow Tongue thugs in Laothkund, however, he was slain by [[Gage]], wielding ''[[Angul]]'', or perhaps by Angul wielding Gage.

Sathra raised him as undead so as to track Gage down into the [[Yuirwood]], using a link that Stolsin had with his killer; once he tracked down Gage, Stolsin attacked again.{{cite book/Stardeep|119-120|10}} Neither Gage nor Kiril claim to have struck down Stolsin. Kiril claims to have struck down Sathra; it is possible that Sathra's necromancy petered out with her.
