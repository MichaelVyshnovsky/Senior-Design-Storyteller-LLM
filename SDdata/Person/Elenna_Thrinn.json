        "mainbody": "Sergeant '''Elenna Thrinn''' was a [[duergar|dwarf]] of the [[Underdark]] that joined the [[cult of the Absolute|cult]] of [[the Absolute]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|He got me to recruit nonbelievers. But not everyone's seein' the Absolute's truth. They don't get paid soon, I'll have a riot on my hands.|Sergeant Thrinn, speaking about Nere and the dwarves of [[Clan Flameshade]].}}",
        "Personality": "Thrinn was a pragmatic follower of the Absolute, not as zealous or self-righteous as some other devotees. She was however wholly dedicated to the Absolute's cause and readily deferred to her [[True Soul]] superiors.",
        "Possessions": "In addition to her other gear, Thrinn kept on her person a [[magic]]al ring called a ''[[bracing band]]''. She also had a favorite pair of ''[[boots of speed]]'', but they were stolen by the gnome rebel [[Thulla]].",
        "Relationships": "She served the cult under the direction of True Soul [[Nere]], a particularly entitled and self-important [[drow]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Nere and Sergeant Thrinn led the cult's excavation of Grymforge, seeking out an ancient [[Shar]]ran temple within its depths. To aid them in their efforts, Thrinn hired on fellow duergar raiders of [[Clan Flameshade]].\n\nAs Clan Flameshade's deep gnome slaves dug through rock and earth, they inadvertently trigged a trap that caved-in a portion the tunnel True Soul Nere was standing in. The drow cult leader and a few gnome slaves became trapped behing a pile of rubble, in a small chamber that gradually filled with some manner of [[poison]]ous gas. Thrinn took over as overseer of the Flameshade mercenaries and their gnome slaves, doubling their efforts to dig out and free the Absolute's True Soul."
