King '''Obould XVII''' was the seventeenth king of the [[Obould dynasty]], ruling over the [[orc]] kingdom of [[Many-Arrows]] in the [[Silver Marches]] in the 1470s{{Cite dragon/429/History Check: Dark Arrow Keep|4-9}} and early 1480s [[DR]]. He reigned from [[Dark Arrow Keep]].

==History==
[[File:Dragon Magazine n429 - Obould XVII p4.png|thumb|''King Obould XVII dispatching a [[frost giant]].'']]
Obould XVII's reign was strong around [[1479 DR]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, after the [[Darkening]], Obould started to lose control of his chieftains. Soon after, under the orders of [[Tiago Baenre]] and [[Ravel Xorlarrin]], he was killed by the [[drow]] assassin [[Belween]], who'd disguised himself as the orc prince [[Lorgru]], who had been kidnapped previously.

==Activities==
As with all his predecessors, Obould XVII inflicted lethal punishments on unruly chieftains. They were sent to battle in the Pit in Dark Arrow Keep; while survival would receive a pardon, Obould XVII gave a slow-acting [[poison]] to those he especially wanted to be rid of.
