Kalas Winters was a 39-year-old man, very tall (), and muscular (). He had reddish-brown hair, brown eyes like the rest of his family, and a thick beard. He usually dressed in dark green and brown clothes that showed signs of age.

Even though his inn had a few candles inside, Kalas frowned on their use, in fear of fire.
Kalas Winters took care of his family well. He kept a close eye on his spritely and willful daughter Dorthy to keep her out of trouble.
Kalas wore his simple thin gold band +2 ring of protection on the left hands index finger. He had a magical +2 dagger tucked in his waist, and he also kept his magical +1 long sword close by behind the bar in case of trouble.
Around Tarsakh, 1369 DR, Kalas lived with his family in the Ten Towns and ran his inn. Wolfs Pelt Inn was busy with fishermen, dockworkers, and adventurers, and it was well-managed, clean, and welcoming.
