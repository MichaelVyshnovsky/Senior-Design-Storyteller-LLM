        "mainbody": "ueen Arathane was a stormsoul genasi and the ruler of Akanûl in 1479 DR.\nArathane was a stunningly beautiful genasi with lavender skin. Unlike other genasi of Abeiran descent, her silvery szuldar lines were almost non-existent.\nArathane was the daughter of Cyndra, As of 1479 DR, she was approaching her fourth decade of life, remaining unmarried, and was besieged by would-be suitors. Arathane was in no hurry to bear a successor, as both her mother and grandmother bore children late in life.\nArathane was considered a fair and just ruler by her subjects, and praised publicly for continuing the policies of her mother, although she had a difficult relationship with the nobility and was frequently opposed by the Four Stewards. Queen Arathane was always searching for alternatives to circumvent the \"Covenant of Stewardship\", such as secretly endorsing and employing the Firestorm Cabal. \nArathane became Queen of Akanûl in 1469 DR, after succeeding her mother, the late Queen Cyndra.\nIn 1479 DR, Aoth Fezim of the Brotherhood of the Griffon sought out Queen Arathane to convince her to not give her support to Tchazzar in the invasion of Tymanther, however he was unable to convince Queen Arathane to not attack the dragonborn. She changed her opinion later, when Aoth and members of the Firestorm Cabal killed the gray dragon Vairshekellabex.\nThat same year, she indirectly aided the deva Demascus to deal with Murmur and the cult of the Elder Elemental Eye in Airspur. In Leafall of 1479 DR, Queen Arathane asked Demascus and Riltana to investigate potential trouble at an arambarium mine on Ithimir Isle off the coast of Akanûl. She later went to Ithimir Isle alongside Demasccus, Riltana, Chant and Jaul Morven and fought Chenraya Xorlarrin and her minions. Unfortunately, the drow were able to transmute the arambarium into a staff and escape. The group traveled back to Airspur and entered a portal to the Demonweb Pits in the catacombs just as Chenraya was completing a ritual to open a gate to Menzoberranzan.  Demascus interrupted the ritual and grabbed most of the arambarium staff from Chenraya as she entered the gate.\nIt was rumored that Arathane had a secret on-again-off-again affair with one of the commanders of the Firestorm Cabal, that would endanger both of them if it became public knowledge."
