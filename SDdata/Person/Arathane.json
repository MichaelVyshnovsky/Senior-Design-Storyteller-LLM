        "mainbody": "'''Queen Arathane''' was a [[stormsoul genasi]]{{Cite digital book/Sword of the Gods||Chapter 16}} and the ruler of [[Akan没l]] in [[1479 DR]].",
        "Appearance": "Arathane was a stunningly beautiful genasi with lavender skin. Unlike other genasi of [[Abeir]]an descent, her silvery ''szuldar'' lines were almost non-existent.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Personal": "Arathane was the daughter of [[Cyndra]],{{Cite digital book/Sword of the Gods|Chapter 16}} As of 1479 DR, she was approaching her fourth decade of life, remaining unmarried, and was besieged by would-be suitors. Arathane was in no hurry to bear a successor, as both her mother and grandmother bore children late in life.",
            "Political": "Arathane was considered a fair and just ruler by her subjects, and praised publicly for continuing the policies of her mother, although she had a difficult relationship with the nobility and was frequently opposed by the [[Four Stewards]]. Queen Arathane was always searching for alternatives to circumvent the ''\"Covenant of Stewardship\"'', such as secretly endorsing and employing the [[Firestorm Cabal]].{{Cite dragon/377/Explore Airspur|62}}"
        },
        "History": "Arathane became Queen of Akan没l in [[1469 DR]], after succeeding her mother, the late Queen Cyndra.\n\nIn 1479 DR, [[Aoth Fezim]] of the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] sought out Queen Arathane to convince her to not give her support to [[Tchazzar]] in the invasion of [[Tymanther]], however he was unable to convince Queen Arathane to not attack the [[dragonborn]]. She changed her opinion later, when Aoth and members of the Firestorm Cabal killed the [[Fang dragon|gray]] [[dragon]] [[Vairshekellabex]].\n\nThat same year, she indirectly aided the [[deva]] [[Demascus]] to deal with [[Murmur]] and the cult of the [[Tharizdun|Elder Elemental Eye]] in Airspur.{{Cite digital book/Sword of the Gods}} In [[Marpenoth|Leafall]] of 1479 DR, Queen Arathane asked Demascus and [[Riltana]] to investigate potential trouble at an [[arambarium]] mine on [[Ithimir Isle]] off the coast of Akan没l.{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|518}} She later went to Ithimir Isle alongside Demasccus, Riltana, [[Chant]] and [[Jaul Morven]] and fought [[Chenraya Xorlarrin]] and her minions. Unfortunately, the drow were able to [[Transmutation|transmute]] the arambarium into a staff and escape. The group traveled back to Airspur and entered a [[portal]] to the [[Demonweb Pits]] in the catacombs just as Chenraya was completing a ritual to open a gate to Menzoberranzan.{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|3549}}  Demascus interrupted the ritual and grabbed most of the arambarium staff from Chenraya as she entered the gate.{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|3592}}",
        "Rumors": "It was rumored that Arathane had a secret on-again-off-again affair with one of the commanders of the Firestorm Cabal, that would endanger both of them if it became public knowledge."
