She was a priest of Chauntea.\nShe was the daughter of the famed priest of Chauntea, Harandave Donohar, Harandave is stated to have fourteen followers in 1367 DR. After his death, Katriana has thirteen followers in 1374 DR, suggesting she is the missing follower.\nFollowing Harandaves death, Katriana took over from her father as head of the temple. She held the position by 1374.\nBy Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Katriana met the priests of the new temple of Mystra in Wheloon, finding them polite but not particularly friendly. She put this down to big-city inter-temple rivalry.\nKatriana Donohar was usually at the temple, managing affairs there. She had a large number of divine scrolls, dating back to Harandaves day, which she sold to those she believed would use them for good deeds. She had thirteen followers or attendants, all minor priests."
