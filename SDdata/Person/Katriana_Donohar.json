        "mainbody": "'''Katriana Donohar''' was a [[Tethyrian]] [[human]] woman living in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. She was a priest of [[Chauntea]].",
        "History": "She was the daughter of the famed priest of Chauntea, [[Harandave Donohar]], <ref group=\"note\">Harandave is stated to have fourteen followers in 1367 DR. After his death, Katriana has thirteen followers in 1374 DR, suggesting she is the missing follower.\n\nFollowing Harandave's death, Katriana took over from her father as head of the temple. She held the position by [[1374]].\n\nBy [[Eleint]] of [[1374 DR|the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Katriana met the priests of the new [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|temple of Mystra]] in Wheloon, finding them polite but not particularly friendly. She put this down to big-city inter-temple rivalry.",
        "Activities": "Katriana Donohar was usually at the temple, managing affairs there. She had a large number of [[divine magic|divine]] [[scroll]]s, dating back to Harandave's day, which she sold to those she believed would use them for good deeds. She had thirteen followers or attendants, all minor priests."
