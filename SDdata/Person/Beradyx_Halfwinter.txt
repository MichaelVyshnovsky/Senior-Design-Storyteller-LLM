Beradyx Halfwinter was a human wizard and transportation mage for the Auroras Realms Shop, Slut Street Catalogue Counter in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Called a "fat and lazy lackspell wizard" by Elminster and other mages, who were contemptuous of his lack of power in the Art, Beradyx preferred a life of "spellhurling for hire" in the safety and comfort of a city. He cast spells only for legal and non-combat purposes. In particular, he used the teleport spell to transport goods to the Auroras Realms Shop.
He loved fine wines and ales and cheese, which showed in his waistline.
When he visited the shop in the mid-1360s DR, Volothamp Geddarm was unable to learn Beradyxs identity.
