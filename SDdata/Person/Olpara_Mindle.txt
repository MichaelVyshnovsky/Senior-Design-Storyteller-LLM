'''Olpara Mindle''' was the wife of [[Corkaury Mindle]]. She briefly played host to [[Jivex]] while the latter was accompanying [[Taegan Nightwind]] in [[Lyrabar]] during [[Greengrass]] in {{yearlink|1373}}, though the [[faerie dragon]] was quite upsetting. A [[halfling]], she was plump, little, and had white, curled hair.{{cite book/The Rage||22}}

Per her husband, she liked to be woken up with [[griddlecakes]] slathered with [[butter]] and [[cherry]] [[syrup]].{{cite book/The Rage||5}} During Greengrass of {{yearlink|1373}}, she put tulips up in every room as observance of the spring festival.
