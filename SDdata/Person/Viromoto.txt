Viromoto was a famed weapon master and duelist of Kara-Tur some time before the midâ€“14 century DR.
Viromoto wielded the mighty katana known as Radiant Death as his weapon of choice.
Viromoto fought a hundred duels and was victorious each time, earning great fame. However, he slowly came to mistrust Radiant Death, until he ultimately switched to another weapon for one fateful duel. There he suffered his first, and final, defeat, and was slain.
