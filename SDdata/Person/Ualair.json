        "History": "Ualair was born in the {{YearlinkName|-110}}\n\nUalair, in the last years of Myth Drannor, was the High Mage of the city and also the Master of the [[N'Vaelahr]], its shadow army.\n\nAt the start of the [[Weeping War]], he used a [[Elven High Magic|high magic]] spell to [[polymorph]] the [[gnome]] [[Parthar|Rhymallos]] into a [[mezzoloth]] so he could infiltrate the [[Army of Darkness]] as a spy. The gnome sent invaluable information back to Ualair.\n\nHe also begrudgingly approved of the [[Spiders' Truce]] between the [[elves]] of Cormanthyr and the [[drow]] of [[House Dhuurniv]].\n\nTragedy hit Ualair when, in the {{YearlinkName|712}}, thanks to Rhymallos's information, [[Malimshaer]] discovered the [[Vaults of Uvaeren]], a deposit of important elven artifacts. [[Aulmpiter]] personally directed Rhymallos's regiment to go to Uvaeren to take the artifacts. Rhymallos immediately informed Ualair but couldn't gather reinforcements in fear that he would expose Rhymallos. Rhymallos and Ualair fought the Army of Darkness's troops alone at Uvaeren until they decided to destroy access to the vault, dying in the process. As one of his last actions to protect the falling city, Ualair broke apart the ''[[Wizard's Torc]]'' separating the frame and the ''[[Starstone]]'', rendering his magical ''[[gate]]'', the ''[[Circle of Ualair]]'', inactive.\n\nBut Ualair survived, severely injured, and entered ''[[temporal stasis]]'' inside a tomb in [[Impiltur]], where he also brought the comatose Rhymallos. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, [[Khelben Arunsun]] located and awakened them in order to gain their help to cleanse part of the [[High Moor]] and restore [[Faer'tel'miir]], a lost city of [[Miyeritar]]. Ualair and Khelben both gave their lives to fuel the Ritual of Myriad. Ualair's soul then went to [[Arvandor]]."
