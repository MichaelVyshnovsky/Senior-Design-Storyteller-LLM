edition is a prestige class in Dragon Annual 2000, but this has no Realms connection. The similar court herald was not introduced until Power of Faer√ªn in 2006. Moreover, it is impossible for Lisyil to have a prestige class with no base class such as Bard, but her incredibly high Diplomacy skill suggests she should have more levels in another class. Another possibility is a holdover from a 2-edition kit, but this seems too late in 3 edition. Most likely, the Herald class is an error and, for example, a bard or expert was intended instead.

Lisyil Sweetwhisper was a moon elf herald of the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She was the representative of High Lord Kalahar Twohands around 1372 DR, often summoning people to an audience at High Lords Hall and announcing formal introductions and accomplishments there, delivering orders and liaising with personnel, and delivering important news.
She could be escorted by five members of the Loudwater Guard.
As her name hinted, Herald Sweetwhisper was well known for her melodic and mellifluous clear voice. She was also highly skilled in diplomacy.
Lisyil was graceful and possessed a fey-like beauty.
Lisyil was a cousin of Teseryne Truesilver, a half-elf bard who lived outside Loudwater.
