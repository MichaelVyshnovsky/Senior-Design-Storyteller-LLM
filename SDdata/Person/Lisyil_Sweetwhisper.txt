The only known 'Herald' class in 3{{rd}} edition is a prestige class in [[Dragon Magazine Annual 2000|''Dragon'' Annual 2000]], but this has no Realms connection. The similar [[court herald]] was not introduced until ''[[Power of Faer√ªn]]'' in 2006. Moreover, it is impossible for Lisyil to have a prestige class with no base class such as Bard, but her incredibly high Diplomacy skill suggests she should have more levels in another class. Another possibility is a holdover from a 2{{nd}}-edition kit, but this seems too late in 3{{rd}} edition. Most likely, the Herald class is an error and, for example, a [[bard]] or [[expert]] was intended instead.
