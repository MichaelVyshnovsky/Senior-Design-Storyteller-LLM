Noori was a member of the Great Worm Tribe sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Noori somehow managed to enter inside the Eye of the All-Father temple. However, she was on the verge of death by freezing.
Her chieftain Wormblod led a group of his berserkers plus an enslaved white dragon and a shaman to try to break inside the temple in order to find Noori. In truth, Wormblod only wanted the treasures inside.
