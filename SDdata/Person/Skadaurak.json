        "mainbody": "'''Skadaurak''', also known as the '''Red Terror of Mintarn''', was a [[red dragon]] [[wyrm]] active around [[Mintarn]] ''circa'' the -2{{nd}} century [[DR]]. He was slain by the red dragon [[Hoondarrh]], who desired to seize the wyrm's lair for his own.",
        "Possessions": "Skadaurak had amassed a vast collection of [[magic items]] before his death, but he largely saw these as a means to an end. He had planned to trade them in exchange for [[magical]] favors, specifically to [[wizard]]s who might be able to grant him immortality.\n\nHis most prized item was ''[[Saldrinur's Slow Gem]]'', a [[Halruaa]]n item that allowed him to enter into long sleeps in which his body was kept in stasis, thus preventing aging.",
        "History": "In his lifetime, Skadaurak earned the title of the \"Red Terror of Mintarn\", and the island on which he laired would come to be known as [[Skadaurak Island]] in his honor.\n\nIn a quest for immortality, Skadaurak sought the aid of human spellcasters, but grew frustrated with their lack of power following the [[Fall of Netheril]]. Thus, he used ''Saldrinur's Slow Gem'' to enter into a stasis that would last hopefully until powerful magics&mdash;equivalent to those wielded by [[Netheril]]&mdash;had been rediscovered. His sleep lasted almost a millennium, and ended in the {{YearlinkName|884}}, by which time few remembered his name and those who did largely thought he was a mere myth. Before he could prove them wrong, however, he was attacked by Hoondarrh almost immediately upon digging himself out of his lair. Still groggy from his sleep, he was no match for the ferocious younger dragon's [[spell]]s and claws, and was quickly slain.\n\n[[File:Shadaurak and co.png|thumb|300px|''Shadaurak, possessing the body of Hoondarrh, with his accomplices.'']]\nHowever, at some point either before or after his death, Skadaurak entered into the service of [[Asmodeus]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 5|10-14}}{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 5|20}}\n\nCenturies after Skadaurak's death, in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Asmodeus manipulated circumstances through the [[archdevil]] [[Zariel]] to have Shadaurak's [[spirit]] be summoned to [[Toril]] to allow the dead wyrm to pursue revenge against Hoondarrh. By playing on the desire for revenge held by the [[wizard]] [[Helene]] after a deadly encounter with Hoondarrh, Zariel prompted her to summon Shadaurak's spirit through a [[Moonwell]] on the island of [[Moray]], which allowed the dragon to possess a [[dragonborn]] pirate named [[Rayonde]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|17-19}} Through Rayonde, Shadaurak raised an army that conquered Moray and threatened the rest of the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|alternate cover}}{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|13-20}}{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 4|8}} When Rayonde's former companions finally slew him on Skadaurak Island, this allowed Skadaurak to leave the dragonborn's body and instead possess Hoondarrh. With his revenge complete, he turned his attention to helping Asmodeus claim control over Helene, whom the dark god had groomed to be his [[warlock]]."
