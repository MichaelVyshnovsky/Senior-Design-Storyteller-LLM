Hadar, also known as the Dark Hunger, was a star-like Elder Evil from the Far Realm who had taken a place among stars of Realmspace. Unlike normal stars, Hadar didnt have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.
Hadar was a cinder-red star, barely visible in the night sky.

Hadar and the other Far Realm-infested stars of Realmspace were somehow related to the Eldest.
Hadar was a dying star, slowly burning into annihilation. Because of that it sent its agents, the Heralds of Hadar, to Toril to feed on living creatures in a desperate attempt to avert its demise.
Hadar was usually sought out by some warlocks to make a pact with it. Neogi were specially adept to seek out pacts with it and the other Far Realm-infested stars.
