'''Hadar''', also known as the '''Dark Hunger''', was a star-like [[Elder Evil]] from the [[Far Realm]] who had taken a place among stars of [[Realmspace]]. Unlike normal stars, Hadar didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.

== Description ==
Hadar was a cinder-red star, barely visible in the night sky.

==History==
[[File:Herald of Hadar AFR.jpg|thumb|A Herald of Hadar.]]
Hadar and the other Far Realm-infested stars of Realmspace were somehow related to the [[Eldest]].

Hadar was a dying star, slowly burning into annihilation. Because of that it sent its agents, the [[Herald of Hadar|Heralds of Hadar]], to [[Toril]] to feed on living creatures in a desperate attempt to avert its demise.

Hadar was usually sought out by some [[warlock]]s to make a pact with it. [[Neogi]] were specially adept to seek out pacts with it and the other Far Realm-infested stars.{{Cite dragon/366/Wish Upon a Star|48}}
