Manawabe was a human druid who lived in the jungles of Chult.
A muscular, tanned man, Manawabe had reddish-brown hair and facial hair. He wore a loincloth made from animal skin, and his arms were tattooed with images of plants.
He was unusually dextrous, making him a difficult target to hit in combat.
Manawabe owned two magical weapons a spear +2, and a dagger +4.
Having vast experience dealing with the fauna and flora native to Chult, Manawabe made for an excellent jungle guide. However, he would not aid anyone seeking to harm the jungle.
