        "mainbody": "Suha  was a noble dao and slave of the Unspeakable in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.\nSuha remained at the Unspeakables side at all times under a guise of invisibility while the yikarian was in control of Muizzi al-Kamars body. Like all dao enslaved to a yikarian, Suha despised her master and was constantly looking for ways to betray his presence to the natives of Huzuz. Since she could not directly betray the Unspeakable, she would often whisper cryptic hints into guests ears when her master hosted a large party.\nUnder direct orders from the Unspeakable, Suha hid special magical amulets within the masonry of each room of the Royal Harim of Huzuz. These amulets made it impossible for any female within the room to conceive a male child."
