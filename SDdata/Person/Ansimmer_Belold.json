        "mainbody": "Ansimmer Belold, who was known locally as Father Allfaiths, was a religious fellow inhabiting Suldolphor in the far eastern reaches of Calimshan in south Faer√ªn during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nDespite his nickname, Ansimmer was a devout follower of Ilmater, the Broken God. He oversaw a small chapel located in Corondors Tower. Beloved by all, he spent the majority of his time tending to the Golden Citys sick and wounded regardless of their race. Ansimmer also collected donations placed among the many small shrines to other gods located along Suldolphors outer wall, distributing the funds to citizens of other faiths as he saw fit."
