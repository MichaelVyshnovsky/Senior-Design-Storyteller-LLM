'''Glaragama Dunrohiyr''' was a female [[wizard]] and [[archmage]] from [[Calaunt]] in [[the Vast]], of the 13th century [[DR]].

==History==
Glaragama originally came from Calaunt in the Vast.

She disguised herself as a man when she apprenticed to the wizard [[Sharabirt]] of [[Calimport]]. When Sharabirt died, apparently of natural causes, she became the apprentice of [[Rrestel]] of [[Athkatla]]. She finally revealed her true appearance and nature when she killed a wizard known as [[Dardren]] of [[Memnon]] and stole all his [[magic]].

In her time, Glaragama made herself known as a rogue wizard who killed twenty fellow archmages. She killed the last quite openly, then calmly named and vowed to kill four more.

At this point, the [[Magister]] [[Inhil Lauthdryn]] reluctantly decided to bring Glaragama to justice, or destroy her. He went alone to the lands of the Vast after both her What happened next was a mystery. A trap had been set for Inhil, and other, unidentified parties were involved. Nevertheless, Inhil battled both foes.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2013)| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]| topicid    = 17385| postid     = 423672| whichpage  = 25| date       = 2013-06-10| accessdate = 2013-06-11}} Lauthdryn defeated Muaralygrym at the cost of his own life, falling somewhere close to [[Ravens Bluff]], between the city and [[Earthfast Mountains|the mountains]]. Later, upon a burned and blasted knoll, the ashes of one of Inhil's staffs were discovered. Some believed that Glaragama had possessed some means of summoning many [[dragon]]s and that they'd swooped and unleashed all their dragon-breaths upon Inhil. It was also thought that Inhil had used a spell that bound Glaragama to himself, so that she suffered the same doom from wherever she'd stood.
