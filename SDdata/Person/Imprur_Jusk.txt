'''Imprur Jusk''' was a rich [[halfling]] investor and landlord from [[Suzail]], active before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Before the late 14{{th}} century DR, Imprur owned the warehouse where [[Flar Oldbottle's Nets, Ropes, Cables, Hawsers, and Cords]] was located on the eastern side of the canal that connected [[the Basin]] with the [[Dragonmere]] in Suzail. One day Imprur discovered a hidden ''[[gate]]'' that activated only in the darkness between Flar Oldbottle's Nets and the [[Red Sunsets Trading Company]] warehouse to the south. The ''gate'' became known as ''[[Jusk's Stroll]]'', which he used to quickly move between Suzail's docks and an alley behind [[the Dragon's Jaws]] inn. The ''gate'' was in nightly use by the halfling to commute to the posh drinking establishments on the [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]]. Imprur's proclivities were so infamous there was a saying in Suzail that one could know where Jusk spent the night because the smell of harbor fish clung to the [[highcoin girl]]s he fraternized with.

The halfling remained in control of ''Jusk's Stroll'' until his death of [[winter fever]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century DR.
