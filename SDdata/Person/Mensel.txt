In life, Lord Mensel was known as a kind, generous, and humanitarian-to-a-fault nobleman. He was universally beloved by his family, servants, and subjects. Mensel died of old age in his sleep.
Later, however, his family discovered a secret vault underneath the Lords study. It was filled with a small hoard of treasure that was claimed by Mensels heirs. One item of note in the hoard was the book called the Obscene Grimoire. The tome and its past owners remained largely a mystery, and a century after Lord Mensels death, countless rumors and legends grew around the sinister black tome.
One rumor of note came from an Arabelan seer, who claimed that Lord Mensel fashioned the Obscene Grimoire for personal use at great expense and ordered everyone involved with the books creation murdered. Despite this storys dubious authenticity, the legend nevertheless damaged Mensels name and his familys reputation.
