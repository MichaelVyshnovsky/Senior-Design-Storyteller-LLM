Esbre Felmorel was the lord of Castle Felmorel in the midâ€“8 century DR.
Lord Felmorel was jovial, but vigilant.
He was married to Lady Nasmaerae Felmorel, and was friends with the explorer and warrior Barundryn Harbright. He was a little less enthused about his other acquaintance, Thessamel Arunder. His castle employed a number of wizards, probably for combat, and more than a dozen warriors as guards.
Esbre Felmorel habitually hosted banquets in his castle.
He had faced at least one fiend at some point prior to . Later, he came to be under spell-thrall from his wife Nasmaerae.
In spring of the , Esbre Felmorel hosted a banquet that was attended by Barundryn Harbright, Thessamel Arunder, and a mysterious wanderer, called only Wanlorn. The dinner led to many digressions about philosophy, history, and governance. The wandering Wanlorn was seeking a woman by the name of Dasumia, and Esbre briefly mentioned the Lady of Shadows who ruled lands to the east.
Nasmaerae tried to steal magic from a sleeping Wanlorns mind that night. In response, Azuth warned her not to, and broke all her spells, including the one holding her husband thrall to her he also informed her that if she tried to do any of that again, the means of her prying would be taken from her. Esbre immediately came to her with a dozen soldiers, and forced her to employ the spell again, most likely having been informed by Azuth himself as well. The spell required his chamberpot and a knife, which he had his soldiers provide. With the casting, her magic was shorn from her by Azuths power. Lord Esbre then declared theyd worship Azuth in that house forevermore.
During the chaos of the Art in the , Esbre Felmorels wizards were unable to cast spells he was resolute to continue standing in force against all foes, though his wife was less sanguine about it.
His feasts had a good reputation, and those who spoke of him in fear preferred to use his moniker of "the Mantimera".
