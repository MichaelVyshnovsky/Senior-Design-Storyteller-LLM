'''Kelddath Ormlyr''' was a [[human]] [[cleric]] of [[Lathander]], the high priest of the [[Song of the Morning]] temple, and the governor of [[Beregost]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
He led the church's clergy, as well as its sponsored militia of some 200 citizens, in defense of the town.

As governor, Kelddath was a champion to the local farmers, supporting their best interests, as well as those of local entrepreneurs. He was vigilant in his defense of the town and was vehemently against adventurers delving into the [[Ulcaster School of Wizardry|ruins of the local wizard school]]. He and his guards kept the town safe, so that trade and business could flourish.

==Relationships==
Kelddath had several influential allies within the town, having been long-supported by the local [[conjurer]] of [[High Hedge]], [[Thalantyr]], as well as the town's blacksmith, [[Taerom Fuiruim|Taerom "Thunderhammer" Fuiruim]]. He also counted the [[Craumerdaun]] mercantile family of [[Amn]] as allies, having convinced them to establish an estate outside of town and breed their prized horses within its stables.

==History==
Before becoming a priest within the [[church of Lathander]], Kelddath was a merchant whose ships sailed along the [[Sword Coast]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, in an effort to keep the town of Beregost safe, Kelddath posted a 5,000 [[gp]] bounty for the death of the crazed, [[Cyric]]ist [[priest]] [[Basillus]], by proof of his [[holy symbol]]. He also offered 2,000 gp for the head of any slain [[wyvern]].
