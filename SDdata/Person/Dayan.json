        "History": "Around 1479 DR, Dayan found a [[necromancer]]'s laboratory inside Undermountain with many strange necromantic machines. Quickly, Dayan started to perform experiments to create a new kind of [[undead]], capturing many living beings in Undermountain to use as guinea pigs.\n\nHe created many undead and even truly resurrected a being. Dayan also used a ''[[speak with dead]]'' spell on the skull of a [[Clan Melairkyn]] [[dwarf]] in order to find hidden tombs."
