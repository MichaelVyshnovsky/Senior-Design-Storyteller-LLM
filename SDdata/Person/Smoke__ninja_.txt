Smoke was one of the three ninja in the service of Daisake Mayazato in the town of Aru in Wa.
Smoke trained in the ninja arts in the Warazama clan together with Moonlight and Snake, until that clan was destroyed by internal dissent. He and his fellows entered into the service of Daisake Mayazato to repay him for previous services.
