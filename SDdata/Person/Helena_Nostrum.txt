'''Helena "Hook" Nostrum''' was a [[giant-killer|giantslayer]] who roamed around the [[Savage Frontier]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Helena had a strong will and a good sense of leadership, capable of keeping people under her command sharp and focused.

==History==
Some time after the shattering of the [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]] in [[1485 DR]], when the Savage Frontier became a hotbed of squabbling [[giant]] activity, Helena witnessed the destructive power of giants firsthand. From that day forward she became a giantslayer, dedicating her life to always being one step ahead of the towering [[humanoid]]s. She eventually joined up with two other [[adventurer]]s to form a giantslayer organization &mdash; [[Hook, Line, and Sinker (organization)|Hook, Line, and Sinker]]. Within the group she acted as the impromptu leader, keeping everyone together.
