Amdramnar was a friendly young malaugrym in the mid–14 century DR.
In the , during the hunt for Elminster, Amdramnar welcomed the Rangers Three, who had come through a gate to the Castle of Shadows. Amdramnar hoped to make Sharantyr his mate one day.
Later, following hints discovered in the writings of the long-dead Shadowmaster High Melvydur, Amdramnar found a secret grotto inside the castle. However, using a separate way, his rival Argast also found it. They decided to temporarily cooperate to discover the secret of this place. Afterward, both decided to travel to Faerun. Upon their arrival they were attacked by some members of the Cult of the Dragon but thanks to their shapechanging powers, Amdramnar killed all the cultists. After arriving in Daggerdale, Amdramnar and Argast learned about the death of Elminster during the second battle of Shadowdale.
Later they went in disguise into the Tower of Ashaba in order to collect more information about Elminster. Upon the arrival of Tantor Dauntinghorn, envoy of King Azoun IV of Cormyr, Argast and Amdramnar posed as the War Wizard delegates Luthtor of Suzail and Shaerl Mourngrym in order to gain information.
Amdramnar was killed by Itharr and Belkram.
