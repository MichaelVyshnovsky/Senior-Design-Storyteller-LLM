As of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, he was trying to set up a secret hideout.

In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Kordak was in a dilapidated tower within the caverns of Mount Dread, where he tried to set up a secret hideout. If adventurers came across him, he may have tried to charm one of them into helping with a nearby black bear, then ambush them with his zombie underlings and magic after they succeeded, or should they refuse.
