'''Renekor''' was a [[beholder]] from the [[Underdark]] that inadvertently wandered into, and eventually took control of, the [[demiplane]] known as [[Wisteria Vale (demiplane)|Wisteria Vale]].

==Personality==
Like other beholders, Renekor was exceedingly paranoid and saw anyone who entered into its lair as a threat. Renekor was definitely one to hold a grudge against anyone it believed had done it wrong.

==Abilities==
Once he made its home within, Renekor came to see Wisteria Vale as his own personal lair and everyone within as its personal playthings. Renekor floated around the village's [[Wisteria Vale#Manor|manor house]] and dawdled in its ballroom, surrounded by [[constructed commoner|constructs]] it believed it had created.

==Relationships==
While in the Underdark, Renekor commanded a small cadre of minions, though who exactly they were was unknown.

==History==
Sometime in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Renekor went into slumber and dreamt itself into a new reality. It was transported to the demiplane of Wisteria Vale―modeled after the [[Wisteria Vale|ruined village of the same name]]―which was actually created to house a powerful former-agent of the [[Harpers]] named [[Arrant Quill]]. Renekor however believed Wisteria Vale came into existence as a result of its dream state, a sanctuary that manifested for its own personal use.

Renekor's presence within the demiplane warped its otherwise peaceful, if not entirely genuine, environment. Normal sounds and smells either went missing or manifested differently than expected, objects in the demiplane changed hues to much more vivid colors, or lost all their color entirely, and incongruous weather patterns manifested at odd times.

Making itself home in the simulacrum of the idyllic village, Renekor took over control of the local manor house. The intruding beholder capture Arrant Quill and trapped him within a magic painting and created an [[illusory]] of the Harper that appeared real in nearly every regard.
