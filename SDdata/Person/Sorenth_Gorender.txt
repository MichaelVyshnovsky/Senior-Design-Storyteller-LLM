Sorenth Gorender, nicknamed Happy, was a vampire and a lower-ranked member of the Night Masters, the cabal of vampires who led the Night Masks. He was also owner and bartender of the Purple Lady festhall.
Sorenth was a man with a handsome face and long, gently curling blond hair that hung to his shoulders. He loved his hair, and usually tied it in a ponytail with a ribbon in keeping with his dress that night. He almost always smiled.
Sorenth maintained an air of elegance and charm, always sociable, friendly, and courteous. Even when he was angry, his manners were perfect. He thus seemed very trustworthy.
Sorenth was the owner and bartender of the Purple Lady, a top-quality festhall in Westgate. Even before his recruitment to the Night Masks, he was a master blackmailer, using the so-called Purple Ladies to acquire information for blackmail. The vampire Orbakh specifically chose him to be his main link to the citys criminal underworld, and made him a vampire and a Night Mask.
Sorenth supervised the blackmailing operations of the guild, and collected information through the Purple Ladies. The unsuspecting upper-class patrons of the Purple Lady—mostly jaded nobles and merchants after a thrill or company above their station—grew intoxicated or infatuated with the lovely Ladies of the festhall and divulged confidences and secrets. They then became victims of Sorenths blackmail most paid up. The few who resisted he reported to the Twilight Knight for intimidation and beatings. Happy Sorenth avoided getting his hands dirty.
Thanks to his trade, nobody suspected his illicit activities or his vampiric transformation. His building was perfect for secretly meeting with this agents, who passed disguised as delivery-folk, crafts-folk, merchants, patrons, and others. The late working hours meant he could remain nocturnal. He also satiated his thirst by "drinking" from his Purple Ladies.
