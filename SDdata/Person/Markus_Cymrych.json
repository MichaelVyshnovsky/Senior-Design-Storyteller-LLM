        "History": "Markus was only eleven years old in the {{YearlinkName|299}}, when both his High King father and his older brother killed themselves and their retainers in a madness-induced melee at the [[Castle of Skulls]]. At that time, the crown passed to his father's younger brother, Gorham. Markus would assume the throne of the High King in the {{YearlinkName|322}}, after killing Gorham.\n\nHe ruled for eleven years before he died in combat without an apparent heir in the {{YearlinkName|333}}. The throne thus passed to a cousin, [[Cameron Cymrych]], who was the grandson of Markus's [[Warren Cymrych I|great-grandfather]]."
