'''Namirrha''' was a [[necromancer]] and a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He acted as the representative and negotiator for [[Malygris]], the Blue Suzerain following his transformation to [[dracolich|lichdom]].

{{Quote|A thousand pardons, Sacred One. I was informed that you have been hurling lightning about and thought you might be in need of assistance.|Namirrha, offering exaggerated platitudes to [[Malygris]].}}

==Description==
He was an older man, with wrinkled skin and balding hair.

==Possessions==
Namirrha wore an ''[[amulet of draconic might]]'',<ref group="note">While this variety of amulet is not given by name, it's description both in ''[[the Siege]]'' and within in-universe excerpts of the ''[[Cult of the Dragon (sourcebook)|Cult of the Dragon]]'' sourcebook correspond with the item's description on page 80 of the latter book. which granted him direct control over Malygris.

==Relationships==
While Namirrha spent years courting Malygris for membership into the cult's ranks, in the end he treated the powerful undead dragon as little more than an oversized [[undead]] minion.

He and his fellow Dragon Cult members held enmity towards the [[Zhentarim]] and desired that they be driven from the [[Anauroch]] desert.

==History==
Some time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, Namirrha appeared before Malygris and appeased him with a collection of [[sapphire]]s and new [[spell]]s with which the old blue dragon was not familiar. They formed a bargain that Malygris would assail any caravan that did not pay the cult's tolls for crossing their territory in the desert.

After a terrible battle with the dragon [[Sussethilasis]] in the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, Malygris finally agreed to receive the "Mightiest of Treasures"—that is transformation into a dracolich—from Namirrha and his fellow cultists. With the aid of Namirrha and the cult, Malygris emerged as the ruler of much of Anauroch's blue dragons over the course of the next five years.

Later in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Namirrha ordered Malygris and his mate [[Verianthraxa]] to assault the [[Citadel of the Raven]] in response to [[Zhentarim]] raids on the cult's holdings in [[Sembia]]. The ill-conceived raid was a failure. While Malygris survived and returned to Anauroch, the recently-transformed Verianthraxa was destroyed. Malygris was not the same after the death of his queen.

On [[Mirtul 9]] in the {{Yearlink|1372}}, Malygris received a visit at his mountaintop lair from [[Brennus Tanthul|Brennus]] and [[Clariburnus Tanthul]] of [[Thultanthar]]. Namirrha arrived shortly after the [[Princes of Shade]], investigating reports of lightning bolts being discharged from up high. The two princes sought an alliance with the Blue Suzerain and made an initial offering to appease him. They killed Namirrha for insulting the mighty blue dracolich by presuming to control him with what they viewed as some mere trinket.
