Elbryn Scatterstars was the head of his Cormyrean family when they became ennobled in the early 13 century DR.
Elbryn had a slender build and always dressed in fine clothes without much pretense or ostentation. He had somewhat delicate features, blond hair with a mustache, and green eyes.
He was a wine connoisseur and an attentive host to guests of the Crown. King Dhalmass appreciated and took advantage of his discretion as a seneschal of the Palace.
Elbryn was an astute businessman who gained significant wealth through strategic shipping contracts. He also enjoyed falconry.
He had an extensive wardrobe of high-class clothing.
In the , Elbryn was part of an escort sent by Dhalmass to ensure the safety and comfort of an important Sembian trade representative on the road to Immersea. While camping for the night, a stolen pay-wagon—known to history as Waevors Wagon—barrelled through the group without forerunners or lights. Elbryn and fellow noble Tharim Roaringhorn were both struck by the careening conveyance and died from their injuries.
