Talisk was a young man of Yhaunn who joined the temple of Shar in the late 14 century DR.
Talisk was a rowdy and shiftless young man of the upper classes, eager for fighting and carousing to relieve his boredom.
In Eleasis of 1373 DR, Talisk was introduced to the newly-recruited Keph Thingoleir by Variance Amatick (disguised as Jarull Cartcoster). Talisk joined Starne and Baret in forming Kephs new social circle, joining him in carousing about the city and making him feel welcome in the church of Shar.
On the night of the new moon, Talisk joined Variances attack on Moonshadow Hall, thinking he would help tear down the temple rather than serving as an expendable distraction.
