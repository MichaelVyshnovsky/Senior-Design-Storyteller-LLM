        "mainbody": "arz Helgar was an inhabitant of Triboar sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.\nDarz was a male human of Illuskan heritage.\nDarz had come to terms with his former life as a thief and had no regrets. He made a fresh start in Triboar and was finished with running away regardless of what happened.\nHe could be stealthy when it was appropriate for the situation and knew how to execute a devastating sneak attack. He was proficient with a short sword and a sling.\nIn Triboar, Darz was paid by Lord Darathra Shendrel to keep the caravan campgrounds and latrines clean. He lived in a cottage on the edge of the northern campground.\nDarz was once a member of Xanathars Thieves Guild in Waterdeep but was caught and jailed for ten years. When he was finally released from jail in the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, he severed all his criminal ties and relocated to Triboar, hoping to start a new life."
