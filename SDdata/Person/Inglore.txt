'''Inglore''' was a dwarven nobleman and brother of Lord [[Onglore]] who perished in the [[Weeping War]] of [[Myth Drannor]]. He eventually was transformed into a [[ghast]] who survived into [[1369 DR]].

==Possessions==
Inglore died wearing his trusty enchanted [[platinum]] ''+2 [[amulet of strength]]''.

==History==
Inglore died alongside his brother defending Myth Drannor during the last months of the Weeping War. Their bodies were displayed in the Main Halls of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] for people to pay respects. When the surviving citizens of Myth Drannor fled the fallen city, the Dwarven Dungeons, along with many other locations, were sealed using the elven ''words of power'' and ''glyphs'' to prevent grave-robbing and desecration. The bodies of the dwarven lord and his brother were not buried or entombed and were abandoned.

In 1369 DR, a group of adventurers from [[Phlan]], while on a quest to stop the [[Cult of the Dragon]], discovered the two dwarven brothers in a state of undeath and frenzied hunger. Now [[ghast]]s, both brothers were destroyed by the adventurers, granting them the peace of death.
