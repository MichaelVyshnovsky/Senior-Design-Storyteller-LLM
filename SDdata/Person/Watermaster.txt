The '''Watermaster''' was a [[hobgoblin]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, the Watermaster was one of the minions of the [[hill giant]] Chief [[Guh]] in [[Grudd Haug]]. His duty was to catch fish from the river, take care of the dam, and guard the den's supply of rations.
