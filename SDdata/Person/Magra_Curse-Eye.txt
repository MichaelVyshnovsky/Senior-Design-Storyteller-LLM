'''Magra Curse-Eye''' was a [[fomorian]] witch who took control over a corrupted region of the [[Feywild]] known as the [[dark fey enclave]]. From her domain in the [[Witch Fen]], Magra led a coven of witches that poisoned the lands in preparation for the malevolent army of [[Malabog|King Malabog]].{{Template:Cite game/Neverwinter: Fury of the Feywild}}

==Description==
Magra's name originated from the fact that her face featured one grotesque "evil eye" with a pupil that resembled those found in felines. This eye was the source of her magical powers, as it was for all fomorian witches.

==Activities==
Along with her fellow witches, Magra collected a myriad of strange collection of plants, reagents, and parts of various creatures, which they used in their horrific alchemical experiments. While they worked together to enhance their dark magic, their secret ways were closely guarded from others.

==Relationships==
Magra's rule over the fomorian witches was aided by her three lieutenants [[Nyx]], [[Mab]], and [[Usha]], all of whom shared her domain in the fen.

==History==
Magra Curse-Eye and her coven remained within their fen ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, when Malabog began his war on [[New Sharandar]]. When the elves of that settlement began their counter-offensive against the fomorians, the witches were assaulted by a band of adventurers led by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]]. Magra and each of her witches were slain, and their befouling magic was finally put to a stop.
