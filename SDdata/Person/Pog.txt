Pog was a rock gnome guard of Gnomengarde in the late 15 century DR.
Alongside Ulla, Pog was one of Gnomengardes sentries. It was his job to hail any outsiders in Common, and to attack anyone he deemed to be a threat.
In addition to his innate gnomish abilities, Pog (like everyone else in Gnomengarde) had some training as a wizard. In combat, he preferred to attack with spells like ray of frost and magic missile.
When Gnomengarde came under attack by a mimic in the late 15 century DR, the only information given to the gnomes by their king, Korboz, was to attack any shapechangers on sight. Unfortunately, this left Pog and his partner Ulla in a predicament because anyone could be a shapechanger. They were thus highly suspicious of any outsiders, and were unlikely to let anyone pass without a fight unless they could persuade the sentries otherwise or unless they had an audience with King Korboz or King Gnerkli.
