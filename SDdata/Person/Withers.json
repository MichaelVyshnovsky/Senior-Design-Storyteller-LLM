Therefore it shall not occur.\"\nHe carried a simple quarterstaff.\nIn Withers own words he was an \"arbiter of certain matters\" and a \"servant to obligation\". \nWithers was interred within the temple of Jergal many years before the era of the Second Sundering, in a sarcophagus designed for the \"Guardian of Tombs\". As of the , Withers was tasked with assisting those that emerged from a crashed nautiloid on the Sword Coast of west Faer√ªn. He was forced to accept and had no choice in the matter."
