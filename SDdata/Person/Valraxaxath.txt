Valraxaxath was a black dragon wizard who created the Dragons Claw, a portal network that spanned Faerûn. 
Valraxaxath believed that dragons should learn to work together in order to hoard all the wealth in the world. He was cunning, and highly skilled when it came to getting his way with others.
Valraxaxath was a powerful wizard, and knew many spells. Through his arcane studies, he had developed the ability to create portals.
Valraxaxath made his lair in the semi-submerged ruins of a grand building in the Great Swamp of Rethild. There he kept the largest part of his hoard.
The lair also contained two portals, one that was part of the Dragons Claw. The second portal connected his lair to a cave hidden in the Wyrmbones, where he kept a second, smaller, part of his hoard.
When dealing with humanoids, Valraxaxath often used the polymorph self spell to disguise himself as a wealthy merchant or noble. 
Valraxaxath engaged in transactional relationships with many chromatic dragons across Faerûn. Otherwise, Valraxaxath was a solitary dragon, but maintained communications with some of the lizardfolk inhabitants of the Great Swamp of Rethild.
