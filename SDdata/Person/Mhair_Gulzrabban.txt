'''Mhair Gulzrabban''' was the founder and leader of the adventuring band known as the [[Company of the Cloak]].

==Description==
Mhair was a stout small man with tiny dark eyes.

==Personality==
The [[wizard]] was always in control, seeking power above all else and wanting to do as he pleased. He was always on the lookout for new ways to exploit a weakness or two in order to gain a profit.

==Abilities==
Mhair, along with all of the other members of the Company of the Cloak, possessed an immunity to [[oil of taggit]] (which causes unconsciousness).

==Relationships==
[[Sharaera Duthtue]] was Mhair's lover and apprentice. He was prepared for her eventual turn on him. Over the years, Gulzrabban made contacts with the [[Zhentarim]], the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], and the [[Shadow Thieves]] and set his organization up as "adventurer killers".

==History==
Gulzrabban began the Company of the Cloak in [[1357 DR]] in the city of [[Scornubel]] within the [[Western Heartlands]]. Recruiting cutthroats and brigands, Mhair assembled a band to hunt down buried treasure and forgotten lore.

As time passed, he faced mutiny and dissatisfaction within his company until deciding to stalk fellow adventurers.
