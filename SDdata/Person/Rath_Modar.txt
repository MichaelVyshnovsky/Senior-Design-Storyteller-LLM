'''Rath Modar''' was a [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] who had desires to become the next [[Zulkir]] of [[Illusion]] and even grander plans for himself.{{Cite web/Rath Modar}}

==Personality==
Rath was deceptive and obfuscating. He had an interest in ancient empires and lost items of power. He plotted revenge from his castle on the [[Sword Coast]].

==Possessions==
The Red Wizard armed himself with a ''[[staff of fire]]'' and carried scrolls of ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', and ''[[fireball]]'' spells on his person at all times.

==History==
Rath was a Red Wizard of Thay who was exiled to the Sword Coast because of suspicions that he was involved in a plot by the Red Wizards to retake Thay from [[Szass Tam]].

He was a key player in the alliance with the [[Cult of the Dragon]], but unlike them was not a zealous believer in [[Tiamat]]. Rather, he desired that when she re-entered the world he would forge a Thayan alliance with her. This would be a part of the planned Thayan Resurrection, a greater scheme to depose [[Szass Tam]] and return the Red Wizards to power in Thay.<ref> Because of his exile, he wanted to take revenge by taking an army of [[dragon]]s to Thay and conquering it for himself.
