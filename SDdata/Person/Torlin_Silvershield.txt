'''Torlin Silvershield''' was one of the [[Grand Duke]]s of [[Baldur's Gate]] in [[1479 DR]].

==Personality==
Torlin was a consummate actor with great control over his voice. His main concern was the best interests of the city, even over the will of the church of Gond. Torlin had no interest in money or status, but thought that the ends always justified the means.

==History==
Torlin was the leader of the [[Silvershield|greatest noble family]] of Baldur's Gate and the high priest of the grandest temple. He helped defend the city from [[Valarken]]'s coup and helped to establish the [[Parliament of Peers]]. In 1482 DR, Torlin was involved in the crisis the culminated in the resurrection of [[Bhaal]].
