'''Entharl Danthelon''' was the [[dwarf]] proprietor of [[Danthelon's Dancing Axe]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Danthelon was a [[shield dwarf]] with a blonde beard who was often in high spirits. He kept his face clean-shaven, hair – styled and groomed, and wore fine clothes. In case of trouble, Entharl carried a [[crossbow]].

==Activities==
The blonde dwarf sold second-hand goods, from [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s, to mundane coils of [[rope]].

==History==
[[File:Entharl Danthelon 1.png|thumb|''Entharl Danthelon getting ready to defend himself.'']]
In the early 1480s [[DR]], Entharl rented out parts of his residence to others, such as the [[wizard]], [[Yssra Brackrel]]. Though Entharl claimed an animated "dancing" [[axe]] was gifted to him by an [[elf]] princess during his time as an adventurer, it was actually Brackrel's illusion that cloaked a [[stirge]].

In [[1492 DR]], he was preoccupied with reports of smugglers that went missing in the [[Riverveins]] tunnels. He encouraged his shoppers to seek out the smugglers, who were said to have been carrying a [[potion]]-filled chest. During the same period of time, Entharl Danthelon was secretly affiliated with the [[Harpers]], grating them the use of the shop's cellar. Entharl and his hired bodyguards ensured the safehouse remained unmolested by the city guard and the [[steel watchers]]. Due to that affiliation, the dwarf was familiar with the [[High Harper]] of Baldur's Gate – [[Jaheira]], whom he called "oaken maiden." At one point, a group of [[doppelganger]]s impersonated Harper agents in attempts to ambush Jaheira within the safehouse.

When the city of Baldur's Gate started mandating donations to fight with the [[Absolute crisis]], Entharl Danthelon donated three sets of worn travel cookware and utensils on at least one occasion.
