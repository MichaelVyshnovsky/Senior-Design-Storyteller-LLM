        "mainbody": "'''Shestandeliath Geshthax''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Tymanther]] and the patriarch of [[Clan Shestandeliath]] in [[1486 DR]]. He was a direct descendant of [[Haizverad]].",
        "Description": "Geshthax had graying, rusty scales and long tasseled plumes. He had lost his right arm in his youth.",
        "Abilities": "He was capable of breathing lightning.",
        "History": "When he was young, he was kidnapped by followers of [[Tiamat]] who wanted to ransom him in exchange of the [[Breath of Petron]]. When Clan Shestandeliath refused to give in the artifact, the cultists severed his right arm as a punishment. He was later rescued by a detachment of [[Lance Defenders]].\n\nDuring the [[invasion of Tymanther]] of [[1479 DR]], [[Vanquisher]] [[Kepeshkmolik Tarhun]] asked Clan Shestandeliath to use the Breath of Petron to deal with the invaders, Geshthax refused to follow the order for personal reasons. Many believed this was because Geshthax was either a coward or wanted to kill Tiamat's followers with his own hands.\n\nIn 1486 DR, Geshthax sought out [[Verthisathurgiesh Anala]] and [[Ophinshtalajiir Kaijia]] in order to investigate a series of murders in the [[Catacombs (Djerad Thymar)|Catacombs]] of [[Djerad Thymar]].\n\nOn [[Hammer 9]] of [[1487 DR]], Geshthax sacrificed himself in order to active the Breath of Petron so he could raise an earth barrier to surround [[Djerad Thymar]] and protect the city against [[Gilgeam]]'s forces. Although Geshthax didn't died by using the artifact, he was left impaired and his daughter, [[Shestandeliath Narhanna]], succeeded him as the new matriarch of Clan Shestandeliath."
