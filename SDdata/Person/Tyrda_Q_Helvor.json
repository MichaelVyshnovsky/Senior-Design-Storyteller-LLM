        "mainbody": "Tyrda QHelvor was Pommarch on the Council of Six in Amn from 1362 DR, the Lady of House QHelvor from 1359 DR, and the first woman on the council.\nShe was only the head of a moderately successful family of pottery merchants from Esmeltaran before being chosen by the Iltarch for an empty position in the council.\nVery secretly, Tyrda was an able wizard and Rhinnom Dannihyr, having discovered her secret through the Shadow Thieves, planned to use Tyrda as a secret weapon against the Cowled Wizards in a time of need. She eventually agreed with Dannihyrs plan only because her position in the council greatly advantaged her businesses.\nTyrda was trained by her father to trust only herself and money and to suspect everything."
