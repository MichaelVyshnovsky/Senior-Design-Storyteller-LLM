Ashuk Masani was an officer of the Durpari lancers, stationed in Bralizzar.
Ashuk Masani dressed in a flowing white burnoose with scarlet cords.
He was honest about providing protection in Bralizzar and all the way north to the Oasis of the White Palm, intending to do the best job he could in this frontier post.
He was of uncommon, overpowering strength.
He carried a sash of defense, and a magic scimitar. He had golden cords woven through a scarlet belt to identify him as an airlancer officer, and he carried a golden horn which identified him as a captain.
He commanded a force of 15 lancers and 15 airlancers. Though he had no love for outsiders, neither would he allow them to be preyed on by tricksters.
Though Lancers were not supposed to make decisions about miscreants, Ashuk often judged them on his own to save steps nobody had complained about it.
