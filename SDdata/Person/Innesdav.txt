Innesdav was an elderly monk living in Candlekeep.
Physically, he was tall and thin. 
He was an important influence in Baylee Arnvolds early life and taught him much, and continued to act as his contact in Candlekeep, sometimes receiving important documents from him via a bag that was magically linked to a closet in the citadel.
