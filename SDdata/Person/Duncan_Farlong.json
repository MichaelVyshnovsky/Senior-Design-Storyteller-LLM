        "mainbody": "'''Duncan''' was a male [[wood elf]] of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''Yes, it's good to see you're still sober enough to recognize me, Duncan - past the stale [[beer]], [[vinegar]], faint sweat, failed aspirations, unwashed [[tunic]]… I thought perhaps you had already had one tankard too many for the day…''|[[Sand (individual)|Sand]]}}",
        "Appearance": "[[File:Duncan_appearance.jpg|thumb|250px|Duncan's appearance]]\nDuncan was a wood elf, who wore simple clothes with an [[apron]]. It was often that he had stains of drinks and food on his [[tunic]].",
        "History": "Duncan was [[Daeghun Farlong|Daeghun]]'s half-brother and a former adventurer (whose friends were gone). After the [[King of Shadows]] was defeated during the battle at [[West Harbor]], they found two [[silver shard]]s and had [[Sand (individual)|Sand]] examine them. Sand found nothing much about them, so Daeghun and Duncan split the shards and kept them.\n\nSome time after, Duncan found [[Bishop]] in a village consumed by a fire Bishop had started. In exchange for a favor, Duncan healed Bishop (who held grudge), else Duncan would spread stories about what truly happened in the village.",
        "Gameplay": "The [[Kalach-Cha]] had to visit Duncan at his inn to learn more about the shards. Sand came and after another examination of the shards, directed the Kalach-Cha to [[Aldanon]], a sage of [[Blacklake]]. Meanwhile, Duncan let the Kalach-Cha and companions rest at his inn."
