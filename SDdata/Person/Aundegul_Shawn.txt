Aundegul Shawn was the owner of the Blade and Stars inn in Baldurs Gate in 1359 DR.
Aundegul was an adventurer until a duel between two master shapechanger wizards killed all his companions and shocked him.
Aundegul managed the inn, where a yuan-ti was imprisoned and darker secrets were hidden.
Aundegul knew many secrets but seldom spoke. His passion was making ruby cordial for customers.
