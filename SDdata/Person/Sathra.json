        "mainbody": "athra was the master of the crime syndicate of Laothkund known as the Shadow Tongue and a necromancer until .\nSathra wore an abundance of black iron jewelry, and she was rather portly in build. An aura of animated, suffering shadows surrounded her.\nSathra was unexpectedly tenacious for a crime lord, craving Angul so badly as to chase its wielder into the Yuirwood.\nIn combat, Sathra could call upon the shadows that writhed around her to bring them to bear against many enemies. She was also capable of summoning demons. She also had the power to bring people from the grave as undead. When in combat with Kiril Duskmourn, she employed a number of spells, including one that seemed to temporarily overwhelm Anguls healing powers, possibly graymantle.\nSathras office doubled as the Shadow Tongues treasury. As of , she had recently purchased a torture device known as a \"Sembian Cradle\".\nAs the head of the Shadow Tongue, Sathra was involved in a number of crimes, and in plans to corrupt the ruling council of the city.\nSathras personal guard was known as the Shadow Cadre. She knew the demon Demoriel by name.\nIn , the thief Gage broke into the Shadow Tongue lair looking for the enchanted elven sword Angul, which the Shadow Tongue had stolen.Gage says Sathra was after Angul. He found a way into the vault through sheer luck, after Sathra left the door open while leaving. She had been injured by trying to touch the blade herself. She caught the thief not long after, but wielding the blade, he managed to slay many of her bodyguards and even a summoned demon before she retreted.\nShe pursued Gage and the swords wielder, Kiril Duskmourn, into the Yuirwood later. The star elf slew her in combat at that time.\nSathra was rumoured to have a Red Room in the Shadow Tongue lair where she performed unknown tortures on her victims.\nThe thief Gage had told some lies to Kiril about Sathra having been hired by a certain Nangulis, per Telarians indications, to manipulate her into heading for Stardeep. Kiril slew Sathra without first asking about such things."
