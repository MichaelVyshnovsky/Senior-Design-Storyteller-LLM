        "mainbody": "Yenandra, the Pirate Queen, was a Queen of Dambrath from the latter 13th century to the midâ€“14th century DR.\nYenandra was the daughter of Queen Ausitil. She had four daughters Luatharyn Meltruil Hasafir and Catharyn, the eldest.\nYenandra enjoyed sailing and piracy, traveling and raiding as far as Zakhara. She was a popular ruler as Dambrath enjoyed increased prosperity under her reign.\nQueen Yenandra ruled Dambrath for 81 years and just began to show signs of age in her last decade. Sometime during this period, she contracted a disease or finally succumbed to one that confounded the clerics, and when it became clear that her days were numbered she voluntarily underwent the process of becoming a spectral guardian. Her daughter Hasafir performed the ritual along with several other drow sorcerers and then Hasafir assumed the throne in 1356 DR.\nYenandras favorite horse was also transformed into a nightmare and thereafter the people of Dambrath would see her at night, riding silently through the land, her eyes giving off an eerie red glow.\nHer daughter Hasifir assumed her throne when she transformed Yenadra into a spectral guardian in 1356 DR."
