        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1356}}, Immult, at the time the oldest tax collector in Cormyr, tried to collect back taxes on [[Sabrast Windriver]]. Ultimately, he took him away for forced labor as punishment for his tax evasion and brought [[Vangerdahast]] and four [[Purple Dragon]]s for that purpose. However, [[Elminster]] appeared and brought money enough to cover Sabrast's debts. He was almost rebuffed until he warned them that failing to accept his payment would release four small [[dragon]]s into the treasury of the Palace."
