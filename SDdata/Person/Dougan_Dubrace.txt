'''Dougan Dubrace''' was the founder of the settlement of [[Dougan's Hole]], one of the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].

==History==
Dougan's founding of his namesake village was fitting enough. The community grew out of the famous fishing spot that Dougan discovered, on the northwestern shore of scenic [[Redwaters]] lake.
