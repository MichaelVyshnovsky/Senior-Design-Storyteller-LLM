'''Stamkk''' was a male [[bugbear]] who ran the kitchen in the [[Coliseum (Maerimydra)|Coliseum]] of [[Maerimydra]] for [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]].

==Description==
A bugbear of some stature, Stamkk was armed with an array of [[cleaver]]s and kitchen knives.

==Personality==
Stamkk was an especially cowardly bugbear for his size, despite his outward appearance as a bully he was not above fleeing as soon as he felt threatened.

==Abilities==
A passable chef, Stamkk could run a kitchen well enough to feed numerous [[fire giant]]s. 

==Possessions==
As the boss of a large kitchen, Stamkk had access to all manner of kitchen implements and utensils.

==Relationships==
Stamkk was a brutal with the [[goblin]]s who helped him run his kitchen but conversely they would stick with the [[bugbear]] wherever he ran.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], the [[half-fiend]] [[fire giant]] [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]] invaded [[Maerimydra]] and made the [[Coliseum (Maerimydra)]] there his home. To feed his giant-sized appetite, Kurgoth conscripted Stamkk and a few [[goblin]]s to prepare meals for him.
