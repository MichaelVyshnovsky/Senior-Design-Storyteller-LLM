        "Description": "Chamberlain Mercer was an aged [[rock gnome]] man with a light skin tone, dark eyes, and black curly hair. He wore a fanciful set of embroidered clothes and a top hat â€“ a chamberlain's uniform of the Jannath Estate.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Mister Mercer was in charge of the help that served Lady [[Firelia Jannath]] in her mansion. When her new husband fell victim of a [[ghost]]ly possession, Mercer dismissed all servants from the mansion on the mistress's orders, leaving only her loyal butler Tarhun Mnemonis standing guard of the mansion's main entrance. Mercer placed [[Furbleston]], [[Bailey]], [[Cyrilla]], [[Jooli]], [[Phubbs]], and Chef [[Marjoram (chef)|Marjoram]] on temporary leave with the pay of half-wages and allowance to seek temporary employment somewhere else. The chamberlain issued a statement that this dismissal was done at no imputation of malfeasance and would be ended upon notice."
