==Description==
Tirdir was a [[human]] man with light skin and light brown hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Tirdir fell victim to [[Am-Si]] and his cronies: [[Camitis]] and [[Reti]], who began kidnapping and extortion racket in Baldur's Gate. Tirdir was kept hostage until his family paid the ransom, after which Am-Si knocked the man out and buried him in a freshly dug grave in Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Grave District|Grave District]]. [[Sethle]], a gravedigger, was on Am-Si's payroll and allowed the criminals to dispose of the abductees, never to be found. By chance, Tirdir was found, and his life was saved. He was able to give the investigators some clues about who was responsible for the crime, along with a piece of red cloth ripped from the kidnapper's clothes. The victim was terrified for his and his family's lives as the kidnappers would return with a vengeance if Tirdir's survival were known. The undertaker was interrogated, and the adventurers eventually discovered the perpetrator's hideout in the [[Athkatla/Bridge District|Bridge District]], rescuing another abductee â€“ [[Lady Elgea]], and reportedly, ending their heinous crimes once and for all.
