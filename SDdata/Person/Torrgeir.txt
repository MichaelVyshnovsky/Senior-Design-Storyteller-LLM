'''Torrgeir''' was the speaker of the [[Bruenghor Clan]] in [[1374 DR]].

==Description==
Torrgeir appeared to step up as the speaker of the clan when their leader, [[Kolgrim]], had not returned.

The [[dwarf]] was bald and had a stringy brown beard with a single large braid that had several rings attached to it. He wore a brown-blue jerkin with blue bracers.

==History==
Around 1374 DR, the Bruenghor Clan was forced out of their mines by a group of [[drow]]. Many of them were slaughtered and [[poison]]ed, and the dwarves were forced to collapse all but one of the exit tunnels, and regroup on the surface above. A task force ascended the nearby mountain, known as [[Burning Eye]], to light a signal fire. They hoped that the signal fire would alert their brothers from [[Easting]], so that they could rush to their aid. The heroes [[Kromlech]], [[Vahn]], and [[Adrianna]] first met with Torrgeir and was informed about the situation. The three adventurers went in search of the leader, Kolgrim, so that they find out what happened and enter the mines.

The heroes were able to light the signal fire, and returned victorious. They had to inform Torrgeir that the dwarves were slain by the [[white dragon]], [[Ciraxis]], and a band of [[ogre]]s. Torrgeir then gave them permission to enter the mines and clear out the drow.
