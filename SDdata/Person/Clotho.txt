'''Clotho''' was a [[human]] [[paladin]] who was wholly devoted to her church and faith.

==Description==
Clotho was a light-skinned woman with long, brown hair and dark eyes. She wore a helmet and [[splint mail]] over a long, blue tunic.

==Possessions==
In addition to her suit of splint mail and helmet, Clotho owned a pair of ''[[gauntlets of swimming and climbing]]'', as well as a [[saber]] and a [[shield]].

==Personality==
Clotho had zero personal aspirations beyond serving her faith. She donated all her wealth to her temple&mdash;even though she was only required to give 90%&mdash;and gave everything else she could to people in need. She never turned down a quest from her church.
