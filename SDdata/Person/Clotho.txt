Clotho was a human paladin who was wholly devoted to her church and faith.
Clotho was a light-skinned woman with long, brown hair and dark eyes. She wore a helmet and splint mail over a long, blue tunic.
In addition to her suit of splint mail and helmet, Clotho owned a pair of gauntlets of swimming and climbing, as well as a saber and a shield.
Clotho had zero personal aspirations beyond serving her faith. She donated all her wealth to her temple&mdasheven though she was only required to give 90%&mdashand gave everything else she could to people in need. She never turned down a quest from her church.
