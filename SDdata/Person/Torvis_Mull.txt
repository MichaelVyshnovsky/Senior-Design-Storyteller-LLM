'''Torvis Mull''' was a [[War Wizards|War Wizard]] who served with Sergeant [[Stoan]] at the [[Border Outpost (Cormyr)|border outpost]] on the [[Moonsea Ride]] north of [[Arabel]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Torvis was a snobbish but curious man with an active mind. He was a loyal servant of the Crown, but found himself bored and frustrated by being assigned to border garrison duty.

==Possessions==
Torvis wore ''[[bracers of defense]]'' and a ''[[war wizard cloak]]'', and carried a ''[[wand of fire]]''. He also carried a master key for unlocking the most secure doors in the outpost.

==Activities==
As the resident War Wizard, he was responsible for assisting the Purple Dragons in any magical matters, and personally interviewed and took down records of powerful [[mage]]s that entered [[Cormyr]].
