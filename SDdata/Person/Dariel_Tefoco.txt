'''Dariel Tefoco''' was a member of the [[Flaming Fist]] and one of the older children of [[Oliver Tefoco]], the proprietor of the [[Beehive Goods and Wares]] general store in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''That Lord Gortash is an absolute genius. I know you've got plenty of Steel Watchers in the city too, but if you could see what they're capable of on the battlefield - all I'll say is, I think the city's plenty safe so long as Gortash is in charge. At this rate, the war'll be over before it's even started, so just sit tight, and I'll try and bring you back a souvenir...''|Dariel Tefoco}}

==Relationships==
Dariel was a son to Oliver and [[Kroyce Tefoco]], and had a number of siblings. The oldest of them was [[Bubbles Tefoco]], who lived in the [[Stonyeyes]] district of the Gate with her family and the newborn [[Dorimara]]. Siblings [[Crowell Tefoco|Crowell]] and [[Thegglis Tefoco|Thegglis]] traveled as caravan guards with merchants along the [[Sword Coast North]], and the youngest siblings [[Hemjax Tefoco|Hemjax]], [[Maggie Tefoco|Maggie]], and others, still lived with Oliver and Kroyce as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] threatened Baldur's Gate's safety. The menace appeared around the time Dariel Tefoco decided to join the Flaming Fist in search of adventures. In his letters home, Dariel ensured his father that he was eating well despite the barracks [[gruel]] being nowhere as good as Oliver's cooking. Dariel eagerly shared exciting things he got to see as a member of the Flaming Fist, including witnessing one of the newly introduced [[steel watcher]]s destroying cultists of the Absolute outside of [[Rivington]]. The young Fist praised Lord [[Enver Gortash]] and the deadly constructs he provided to the city.
