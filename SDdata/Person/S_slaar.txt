'''S'slaar''' was a [[troglodyte]] chieftain of a tribe in the [[Wormwrithings]] area in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], he had a disagreement with his war chief [[H'slaat]] about the ownership of a magic sword. Soon a civil war started between S'slaar's and H'slaat's loyalists.
