Xamus was an efreeti inhabiting Rogosto in east Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Xamus served the shair Othmar bin Kaloth as his loyal genie companion. 
Xamus possessed a shrewd eye for judging a persons character and true intentions, a skill that served his master well. A favorite pastime of Xamus was collecting magical items from those whom his master had imprisoned. Xamus hoped to gather enough powerful items to impress a beautiful female noble efreeta back home in his native City of Brass.
