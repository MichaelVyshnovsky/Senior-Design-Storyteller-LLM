'''Sheris Lyricist''' was a noblewoman and the leader of the adventuring company - the [[Lady's Lament]] from [[Waterdeep]], active ''circa'' [[1310 DR]].

==Description==
Sheris was a charismatic, pampered, and spoiled young lady from the City of Splendors. Her main passion was music, and she worked hard to be a skilled musician.

==History==
Several years before the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, Sheris's pampered life of luxury came to an end when she found out about a marriage arranged by her father. Unwilling to comply with her noble family's wishes, Sheris fled home and took on the only job she could - becoming a [[bard]]. Eventually, Sheris organized an adventuring company she named the Lady's Lament. Her adventuring troupe grew as several individuals joined: a [[half-orc]]ish couple [[Geldin]] and [[Khatja]], a [[cleric]] of [[Ilmater]] named [[Laeris]] who offered his wise advice to compliment Sheris's charisma, a [[drow]] [[sorceress]] Vraedna who denounced [[Lolth]], and a [[hin]] [[rogue]] [[Kylie]] who used his shiny personality to put a smile on the faces of his teammates.

In 1310 DR, the Lady's Lament, along with many other mercenaries, traveled from [[Luskan]] to the besieged city of [[Targos]] in the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].
