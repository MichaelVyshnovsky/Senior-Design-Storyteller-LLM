        "mainbody": "'''Taradril Aumraven''' was a member of the [[Zhentarim]] in [[Darkhold]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]] and a former Lord of [[Zhentil Keep]].",
        "Personality": "Taradril had a mercantile view of the Zhentarim and for this he supported [[Sememmon]] as the main Zhentarim leader. He viewed Sememmon as a more stable and capable leader than [[Manshoon]], whom Taradril thought too involved in secrets to have real perception of the liking of the [[Zhentish]] people.",
        "History": "Taradril was a merchant wizard in [[Zhentil Keep]] and, thanks to his power, gained a seat on the Council of Lords. He often opposed Manshoon's proposal in the Council and tried to did the best for all Zhentil but Aumraven was sometimes double-crossed by Manshoon, as about the rebuilding of [[Citadel of the Raven]].\n\nDuring the destruction of Zhentil Keep by [[Cyric]]'s horde in [[1368 DR]], only the timely assistance of Sememmon saved Taradril's life. He was tasked with rebuilding the Zhentarim mercantile trade through Darkhold. For this, Taradril often clandestinely collaborated with Lady [[Alicia]] of the [[Citadel of the Raven]] for control the caravan trade in the [[Anauroch]].\n\nTaradril's estate was located in the central section of Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Inner Quarter|Inner Quarter]] on [[the Lord's Way]] and [[Flostren's Memory]]."
