Earl '''Cuthbert''' was a ruler of [[Cuthbert Fief]] in [[Hartsvale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Cuthbert was a barrel-chested, round-faced man. He was balding and had squinting eyes. He dressed in a jerkin with the symbol of his fiefdom, crossed shepherd's staves, displayed.

==Relationships==
Earl Cuthbert was married and had at least two daughters.

==Possessions==
Cuthbert was in possession of a library within his castle that contained many [[biotite]] folios written in [[Metamorpherie]], taken from the [[stone giant]]s his ancestors had conquered. He claimed to have read all of them carefully.

When in combat, Cuthbert wielded a [[battleaxe]] and wore steel armor.

==Activities==
Earl Cuthbert always sent his taxes to [[Castle Hartwick]] on time, a matter that did not go unnoticed by the queen.

==History==
{{fq|float=right|source=Queen [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]], moments before Earl Cuthbert's death|text=[[Hartsvale]] shall miss you, Cuthbert. If I survive, you'll be remembered as the Loyal Earl.}}
In [[1366 DR]], when Princess [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] returned from her abduction by [[Goboka]], Cuthbert was one of the first of the earls to support Brianna in deposing her father King [[Camden]].

During the battle in [[Cuthbert Castle]] against the false Prince [[Arlien]], Earl Cuthbert tried to buy the queen, [[Tavis Burdun|Tavis]], and [[Avner]] time by blocking the doorway to the folio room. His battleaxe was unable to break through Arlien's magic armor, and the [[ettin]] slew him with a single blow that cleaved both his armor and his sternum.
