        "mainbody": "Watson Nettlebee was the oldest son and heir of Bertram Nettlebee during the Elemental Evil crisis.\nWatson was brave, honest, and forthright. He had more in common with his mother than his father or grandfather, and he was angry about the mistreatment of the cattle. Watson knew about Wiggan and Bertrams new religion, but thought it was only folklore.\nHis father Bertram slowly instructed Watson about the Cult of the Black Earth. \nIn 1491 DR, he was unwittingly involved in a trap set by his family for some adventurers who had defeated the Cult of the Black Earth at the Sacred Stone Monastery."
