        "mainbody": "'''Thom Wainwright''' was a hero in service of the [[Church of Helm]], active in the city of [[Berdusk]] sometime before [[1312 DR]].",
        "History": "Thom Wainwright's claim to fame was the supposed destruction of an [[elder orb]] known as the [[Unseeing Eye‎‎]] and its cult of the [[Blinded Acolytes‎]] some time before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}. Thom was awarded a ''[[girdle of beatification]]'' ''[[bless]]ed'' by the church for this and many other deeds. Thom Wainwright continued his heroics at the behest of the church for several more years. In his later years, Thom fell into serious debt and to his monumental regret, faced to auction his ''girdle of beatification'' off to a renowned [[Maskarran]] [[cleric]]."
