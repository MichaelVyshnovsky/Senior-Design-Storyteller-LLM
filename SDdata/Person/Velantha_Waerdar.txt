Velantha Waerdar was a cleric of Tymora in Yartar in 1370 DR.
Velantha was the high priestess of the temple of Tymora in the city. She was an amicable individual but secretly delighted in stirring up chaos, forcing others to trust in their luck, take chances, and otherwise unwittingly follow the way of the Lady. Velantha had many friends among adventurers.
