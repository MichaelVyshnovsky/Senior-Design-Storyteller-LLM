        "Description": "Thanks to her angelic heritage Caelar's eyes shone with a bright blue radiance.",
        "Personality": "Caelar Argent was exceptionally charismatic and could inspire great deeds in her followers. While she was also capable of greatness, throughout her life she proved to be impetuous, uncompromising and exceedingly selfish.",
        "Abilities": "As an aasimar Caelar was resistant to the elements and [[magic]]. She could hurl bolts of divine energy at her foes.",
        "Possessions": "Caelar wielded a unique [[longsword]] called ''[[Aster's Edge]]'' and a shield called ''[[Solar Aegis]]''. She wore the ''[[Mail of the Hallowed Hero]]'' and the ''[[Circlet of the Cynosure]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Her uncle, [[Aun Argent]] was a valiant paladin in the Order of the Aster.",
        "History": {
            "As The Shining Lady": "[[File:Shining Crusade.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The Shining Lady and her devoted crusaders]]\nCaelar assumed the title of the Shining Lady and formed what she called the Shining Crusade, rallying forth all manner of folks from the [[Sword Coast]], from mercenaries who fought mere for gold to disheartened veterans that suffered great loss during the [[First Dragonspear War|First]] and [[Second Dragonspear War]]s. She brought on monstrous humanoids such as [[gnoll]]s, [[half-orc]]s, and [[hobgoblin]]s â€“ individuals that may otherwise be shunned by the folks of the Realms. While she promised her followers a cause to which they could devote themselves, great riches and glory, and even the return of their deceased loved ones, in truth only Caelar started a campaign of conquest with one soul in mind. The Shining Lady marched her army north along the coast to Dragonspear Castle, razing villages and conscripting more soldiers before finally taking occupancy within the ancient and haunted fortress. Upon their arrival Caelar and Hephernaan attempted to use her own half-divine blood to open the castle's ''portal'' but found it was not potent enough.\n\nAnother opportunity presented itself in short time, when the Hero of [[Baldur's Gate]] [[Abdel Adrian]] was revealed to be one of the [[Bhaalspawn]], a mortal child of the dead god [[Bhaal]]. She dispatched [[assassin]]s to assail the hero while he stayed in the city, in a feeble and unsuccessful attempt to utilize his blood. The chaos caused by the crusade's campaign of acquisition along the coast sent refugees fleeing to many cities, spurring the Baldurian [[Council of Four]] to enlist Abdel and his companions to intervene and stop the Shining Lady. The adventurers and the crusaders fought a number of skirmishes as Caelar lured her quarry, along with the newly-formed [[Coalition]] forces, north across the [[Winding River]] at [[Boareskyr Bridge]] into a final confrontation at Dragonspear Castle.",
            "Fall From Grace": "Unfortunately for the crusade, the combined coalition army of Baldur's Gate, Waterdeep, and [[Daggerford]] proved too mighty for the motley band of zealous warriors. Caelar's soldiers were forced back beyond the castle's courtyard, through the keep itself and into its basement; until the Shining Lady, Hephernaan, and a handful of her crusaders were holed away behind the [[magic]]ally-sealed doors that sealed away the vault in which the castle's infamous ''portal'' to the Nine Hells was set. Confronted by Abdel, his companions, and the leaders of the Coalition army, Caelar refused to surrender. Before anyone on either side could act, Hephernaan showed his true colors by magically holding everyone in place and used his dagger to spill the blood of the Bhaalspawn. The ''portal'' to the Nine Hells opened immediately and Caelar saw her opportunity to act.\n\n[[File:Caelar Avernus.jpg|thumb|400px|Caelar Argent fighting through the legions of the [[Nine Hells]].]]\n\nThe Shining Lady and what remained of her crusade ventured through the hellscape of Avernus and marched upon the [[Basalt Tower]]. They lost many in this final push for Caelar's ultimate goal, confronting Belhifet and freeing her uncle from eternal damnation. Abdel Adrian and his fellow adventurers followed in short time, arriving at the roof of the tower just in time to witness Caelar's final loyal soldiers being struck down by Belhifet and the treacherous Hephernaan, who revealed himself as a minion of the powerful [[baatezu]]. Left entirely alone with no allies at her side, Caelar Argent was presented with one final choice: give in and embrace the [[evil]] she had already exemplified during her deceitful crusade and submit as Belhifet's [[blackguard]], or fight alongside the Hero of Baldur's Gate to defeat the ancient fiend, destroying it once and for all in its own realm. While Caelar's ultimate fate was unknown, her legacy lived on with all the chaos and destruction her crusade had wrought."
