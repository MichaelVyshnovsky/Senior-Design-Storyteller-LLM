        "Activities": "Cujas specialized in the study of elemental [[water]], liquids, and the [[transmutation]] of similar materials. She originally came to fame when she created a pool of \"heavy water\" that could support the weight of rock, and also managed to transmute water into an [[nitroglycerin|explosive fluid]] that had to be stabilized with sawdust. She later became a teacher at the Seminary and worked under [[Quintus]] to teach her field of elemental transmutation."
