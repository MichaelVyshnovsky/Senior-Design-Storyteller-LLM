'''Marcoryl''' was a [[druid]] who lived in the [[Emerald Grove]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|By Silvanus - another outsider. Should you have an ounce of sense, you will leave. Immediately.|Marcoryl.}}

==Activities==
He spent much of his time in the grove's archives, surrounded by [[tome]]s and stone tablets that held wealths of information.

==History==
In {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[archdruid]] [[Halsin]] offered safe haven to a community of [[tiefling]]s who were exiled from their home city of [[Elturel]]. When the tiefling child [[Arabella]] attempted to steal the ''[[idol of Silvanus]]'' from the grove's altar, the druids were split as to what should be done with the girl. Marcoryl was of the opinion the young tiefling should be held captive and made to pay for her crime.
