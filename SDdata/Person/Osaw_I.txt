While neutral gods such as Ubtao are not supposed to have paladins, the Chosen of Ubtao seem to be an exception to this rule.

The undying negus negusti ("Prince of Princes"), King Osaw I the Wise was the ruler of the holy city of Mezro and one of the seven barae, the Chosen of Ubtao.
King Osaw appeared to be a Tabaxi man of 80 years of age, with hunched shoulders and wrinkled skin, though he was over a millennium-and-a-half old. Despite his age and appearance, he had a youthful energy and a deep, questioning gaze. He bore a platinum circlet and platinum armbands as symbols of his kingship.
Osaw was soft-spoken but noble.
Like all barae, Osaw was immortal and could not age or grow sick. He had been granted several special abilities common among the Chosen of Ubtao
* He could utter magical commands that would compel the hearer to obedience.
* He regenerated health rapidly.
* He could detect evil at will.
* He had improved reflexes and physical and mental resistances.
If within the Temple of Ubtao, he could also cast the following spells
* Cure critical wounds
* Forbiddance
* Remove blindness or deafness
* Remove disease
* Restoration
* True seeing
In addition, Osaw had been granted the special power to recall with crisp precision every event and meeting he had experienced within the entire long length of his reign.
Osaws son, Kwalu, was negusti of Chult and also was another of the barae.
King Osaw ruled from a triangular throne room within the Temple of Ubtao. He spent about eight hours a day there, holding court.
Osaw was also the author of a work of history, The Eternal Life of Mezro.
King Osaw became a bara and the ruler of Mezro some fifteen hundred years before 1372 DR.
For a third of his reign, Osaw kept the city of Mezro hidden by powerful magics, so that only native Tabaxi could even see the city, let alone enter it. After a successful war against the goblin Batiri tribes, however, King Osaw chose, in 1363 DR, to once again open the city to outsiders. This decision resulted in a large amount of trade goods flowing through the city.
