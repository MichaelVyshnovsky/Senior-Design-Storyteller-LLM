'''Mayastan Sadaar''' was a [[dragonborn]] [[sage]] that lived in the library-fortress of [[Candlekeep]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Mayastan uncovered the [[book]] entitled ''[[The Canopic Being]]'' within Candlekeep and grew greatly troubled. She was insistent on traveling to the far-off city of [[Tashluta]] and learning more from the oracle of the [[House of the All-Seeing Orb]], [[Valin Sarnaster]].

One of Candlekeep's [[Great Reader]]s, [[A'lai Aivenmore]], became concerned at Mayastan's sudden shift in focus and set a group of adventurers to follow her to Tashluta.

Upon her arrival, Mayastan was received by the servants of [[Valin Sarnaster]] and taken into her [[Tomb of Valin Sarnaster|inner sanctum]]. Mayastan's pancreas was forcibly removed and replaced with that of Valin Sarnaster, as part of the ritual that would transform the dragonborn sage into one of the oracle's [[canopic golem]]s. Realizing the fate that awaited her after the transplant, Mayastan chose to end her own life and not allow Sarnaster to gain strength at the expense of her own body.
