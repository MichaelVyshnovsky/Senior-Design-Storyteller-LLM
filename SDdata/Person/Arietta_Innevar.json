        "mainbody": "rietta Innevar was the persona by a doppelganger that pretended to be of two sisters traveling the Sword Coast during the late 15 century DR.\n\"Arietta\" and her sister \"Zelina\" took on the likenesses of unassuming travelers that sought company while navigating the trade routes of the Sword Coast. They would join a band of travelers or caravan for some time, earn some level of trust among the group, then be poised to strike. The Innevar \"sisters\" would lure a lone member of their traveling companions away in night and attack when their guard was down.\nDuring the 1480s DR, \"Arietta\" and her sister traveled north along the Trade Way towards the direction of Waterdeep."
