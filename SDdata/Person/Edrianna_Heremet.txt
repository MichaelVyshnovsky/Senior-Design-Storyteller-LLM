'''Edrianna Heremet''' was a laborer inhabiting the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
She owned a special ''[[ring of warmth]]'' that was given to her by her father when she was just four years old. She was a sickly child so her father had the ring made especially for her to fight off her frequent bouts of chills. In addition to providing the common benefits of a ''ring of warmth'', Edrianna's ring also made her completely immune to natural diseases.

==History==
Her parents were killed by an instance of extreme bad luck, prompting Edrianna to secretly worship [[Beshaba]] with the hopes of preventing something similar from happening to her or those close to her.

==Relationships==
She had a brother and sister respectively named [[Donar Heremet|Donar]] and [[Ariel Heremet|Ariel]].
