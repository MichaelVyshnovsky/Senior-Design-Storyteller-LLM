        "mainbody": "astraero was a mage from the city of Calaunt in the Vast.\nMastraero once played chess with an unwashed sailor in The Salty Dog tavern in Ravens Bluffâ€”and lost. In his rage, he turned every witness into a snail, but missed his opponent, who turned out to be Ambassador Carrague of Ravens Bluff. Carrague promptly restored everyones proper forms, and they got their revenge, forcing Mastraero to consume 10 pounds (0.45 kilograms) of salt. Mastraero survived the experience, albeit in poor health."
