'''Adrienne Stillwater''' was a female [[half-elf]] [[ranger]] and [[cleric]] of [[Mielikki]] operating in the [[Hullack Forest]] and the town of [[Thunderstone]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 1360s [[DR]].

==Personality==
Adrienne was a nature-lover, and was unbiased and restrained in her actions.

==Abilities==
A veteran ranger and cleric, Adrienne was stealthy and had [[ogre]]s as a special foe. She commanded divine spells which aided her in her woodland travels.

==Possessions==
Adrienne wore ''+2 [[leather armor]]'' and fought with a ''[[flame tongue]] [[longsword]]'' and ''+2 [[dagger]]''. She also had a [[shortbow]] with 20 [[flight arrow]]s.

==Activities==
Basing herself in Thunderstone on occasion, Adrienne roamed eastern Cormyr around the Hullack Forest. She feared that the so-called "civilized" forces of Cormyr such as adventurers and [[Purple Dragons]] would irreparably ruin the woodland in their efforts to clear it of dangerous monsters. She tried to prevent or limit the damage to the environment where possible.

==History==
Adrienne spoke with the [[Sembite]] adventuring company the [[Wolfmasters]] while they were in Thunderstone in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, learning that they were venturing into the [[Vast Swamp]]. Shortly thereafter, she went into the Hullack Forest on her own mission.
