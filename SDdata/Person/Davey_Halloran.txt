Davey Halloran was a down on his luck commoner of Daggerford circa 1372 DR.
Davey Halloran was a tall and spindly young human male with shaggy black hair and unkempt facial hair.
Davey was a clumsy pickpocket, a bad liar, and a simple man.
Davey Halloran loved his gambling addict father enough to risk his own life trying to steal coin to pay the old mans debts. Daveys fathers gambling became a problem following Halloran seniors wife and Daveys mother. An optimistic young man, Davey always said that at least gambling was not as bad as turning to alcoholism.
In 1372 DR, Davey Halloran frequented the Black Stone Inn where he was trying to unskillfully pickpocket enough money to pay his creditor off, Vladmyr of the Stop Hole Abbey. With one of these clumsy attempts, he bumped into the adventurer who was later to become the famous hero of Daggerford. After being confronted, Davey quickly told the adventurer that he only did it to get money to help his father. The creditor Vladmyr was threatening Halloran Senior with being drown in Delimbiyr River if he were not to pay what was owed. Davey was forced to help his father with finding the coin, after Vladmyrs thugs broke into their home and beaten his father half to death. The Hero of Daggerford promised to try and aid the down-on-their-luck folk.
The adventurer agreed to perform a task for Vladmyr, replacing the unique portrait, Greatshout as a Young Man, with a worthless fake. The painting was kept in Torleths Treasures of Gillians Hill. After the deed was done, Vladmyr agreed to forgive the old mans gambling debt and Davey promised to keep his father away from trouble.
