'''Tane''' was a tumbler and performer that traveled across the Realms with a traveling troupe in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|24}}

==Personality==
Along with their siblings, Tane was an odd individual. When the group was together and approached by a stranger they only responded in terse grunts and vague nods, unless the interrupting person was especially entertaining.

==Relationships==
Tane was one of three triplets, along with [[Tawn]] and [[Tine]].

==Possessions==
One of the three tumblers owned a bag of magic dust that could be thrown hard to the ground to conjure a great cloud. This was regularly used in the act that they performed together.

==History==
Some time during the 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} Tane and their traveling companions stopped at the city of [[Phlan]] on the [[Moonsea North]] to perform their act for a while. At some point, they stopped at [[Madame Freona's Tea Kettle]].
