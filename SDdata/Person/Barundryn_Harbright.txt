'''Barundryn Harbright''' was an explorer in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He had a low opinion of wizards, but could be quite cheery to his friends.

==Relationships==
He became a landlord to [[Thessamel Arunder]] in {{yearlink|767}}.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|727-730|19}} He was also a follower of the [[One True Path]], and an old friend of [[Esbre Felmorel]].

==Description==
The man had immense muscles, being bull-like in the breadth of his chest. His arms were not just buff, but hairy. His formal dress included a purple [[robe]] and a high golden belt and [[bracer]]s with scenes of men wrestling [[lion]]s. His golden codpiece, too, was engraved with similar scenes.

==Possessions==
He was quite wealthy, and wielded an [[enchanted]] [[broadsword]].

==History==
Barundryn Harbright was a guest at one of Esbre Felmorel's banquets in the spring of the {{yearlinkName|761}}, together with Lord of Spells [[Thessamel Arunder]] and a wandering stranger, [[Elminster Aumar|Wanlorn]]. During the talk, Harbright claimed that the One True Path, of which he was a member, already held power in a dozen towns, and needed a realm next.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|562|3}}

About two [[tenday]]s into the chaos of [[the Art]] in the {{yearlinkName|767}}, Barundryn Harbright backed a high offer for [[South Spire]], the tower of Thessamel Arunder, thus becoming his landlord. He gave the diminished wizard a dressing down while revealing himself.

==Rumors & Legends==
During the Feast together with Wanlorn, Barundryn claimed that the people of [[Myth Drannor]] had attempted to gain godhood as the [[Netherese]] did before them, and that was the cause of their fall. At the very least, that was untrue.
