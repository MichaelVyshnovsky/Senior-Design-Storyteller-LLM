She also liked very strong drink.\nDuethaea was strong in the Art.\nShe wore two enchanted bracers that launched a number of spells.\nHer family saw her as difficult. She had been trained by Elminster Aumar.\nShe liked to mingle in taverns all around the Savage North.\nDuethaea met her match in the Battle of Blades Afire, where she attacked heedlessly and was ultimately mortally wounded by the demonic foes."
