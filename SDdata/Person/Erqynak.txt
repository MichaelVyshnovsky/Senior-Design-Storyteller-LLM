Erqynak was an elderly ixzan who was a member of the Xendreth, the ruling council of Malydren in 1370 DR.
Erqynaks primary concern was with spell research. His nickname derived from the effect caused by an original spell he created, called Erqynaks icy breath. Erqynak studied cold-related dweomers and drew his innate spell powers mostly from the school of evocation.
