'''Erqynak''' was an elderly [[ixzan]] who was a member of the [[Xendreth]], the ruling council of [[Malydren]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Erqynak's primary concern was with spell research. His nickname derived from the effect caused by an original spell he created, called ''[[Erqynak's icy breath]]''. Erqynak studied cold-related dweomers and drew his innate spell powers mostly from the school of [[evocation]].
