Fayaniz al-Nokar was an employee of the House of Wo in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Fayaniz handled the daily workings of the carvanserai, leaving Wo free to deal with food preparation.
Fayaniz was initially attracted to the House of Wo because of a desire to learn foreign magic from his employer. Wo taught Fayaniz a few spells, but the language barrier made progress slow for Fayaniz.
