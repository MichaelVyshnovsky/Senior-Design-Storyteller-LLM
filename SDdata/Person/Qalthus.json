        "mainbody": "'''Qalthus''' was a [[Shadovar]] [[shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] [[mage]] involved in&mdash;and later outcast from&mdash;the [[Netheril|Netherese]] effort to restore the fallen [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] of [[Xinlenal]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "He was driven by rage\n\nHe was a dedicated and tireless researcher.",
        "Relationships": "He was outcast by the Netherese after the labor foreman at Xinlenal, [[Korvina]], blamed him for her mistakes in order to save face with [[Princes of Shade|Prince]] [[Clariburnus Tanthul]].\n\nQalthus was then recruited to aid a [[Cult of Maegera|cult of fire-worshipers]] led by [[Gommoth]] in their disorderly efforts to trigger a second awakening of [[Maegera]] and another eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]].",
        "History": "In the decades following the [[eruption of Mount Hotenow]], Qalthus was a high-ranking member of the Shadovar team excavating Xinlenal. When fellow shadar-kai mage Korvina accidentally caused the fallen city's ''[[mythallar]]'' to weaken, she pinned the blame on Qalthus, who was expelled and became an outcast.\n\nBy {{Yearlink|1479}}, Qalthus had become the newest member of a cult composed mostly of [[:Category:Creatures with the fire subtype|fire creatures]] and [[fire elemental|elementals]] based within Mount Hotenow, and led their efforts to cause an eruption. While he had not figured out how to make this happen, he was confident that his endless research and experimentation would eventually lead him to discover a [[ritual]] powerful enough to awaken the volcano. His fanatical devotion to the cult was driven by his personal grievances and desire to rain fire upon Xinlenal."
