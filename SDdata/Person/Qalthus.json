When fellow shadar-kai mage Korvina accidentally caused the fallen citys mythallar to weaken, she pinned the blame on Qalthus, who was expelled and became an outcast.\nBy , Qalthus had become the newest member of a cult composed mostly of fire creatures and elementals based within Mount Hotenow, and led their efforts to cause an eruption. While he had not figured out how to make this happen, he was confident that his endless research and experimentation would eventually lead him to discover a ritual powerful enough to awaken the volcano. His fanatical devotion to the cult was driven by his personal grievances and desire to rain fire upon Xinlenal."
