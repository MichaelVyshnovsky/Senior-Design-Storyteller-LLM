Turg Zhuroth was a member of the Xanathar Thieves Guild in Waterdeep around 1370 DR.
Turg was a member of a party of Hands that wandered Waterdeep in search of possible slaves to kidnap. Usually, Turg and his fellows neutralized the victims with their sleep-poisoned weapons and transported them via Waterdeeps sewers to a secret entrance to Undermountain.
