'''Turg Zhuroth''' was a member of the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] in [[Waterdeep]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Turg was a member of a party of Hands that wandered Waterdeep in search of possible slaves to kidnap. Usually, Turg and his fellows neutralized the victims with their sleep-poisoned weapons and transported them via Waterdeep's sewers to a secret entrance to [[Undermountain]].
