Vixthra was a dracolich who allied with the Valsharess during her campaign to conquer the Underdark in the early 1370s DR.
Vixthra established a cult devoted to his worship, under the leadership of a vampire priest named Sodalis. This cult was based in an Underdark village called Drearings Deep, where freed slaves came to seek refuge. In exchange for the cults protection, the villagers were required to offer members of their community to the cult as sacrifices. Sodalis and his vampire cultists would then feast on the flesh and blood of the sacrificial victim, while the bones would be delivered to Vixthra to be reanimated as undead servants.
During the Silence of Lolth over 1372/1373 DR, the Valsharess began a campaign to declare herself the supreme ruler of the Underdark. Vixthra entered into an alliance with her, sending undead and bone golems to bolster her army. A great adventurer, Drogan Drogansons pupil, seeking ways to weaken Valsharess, traveled to Drearings Deep and infiltrated the cult. In the deepest chamber of Vixthras temple, the adventurer and companions fought Vixthra, destroyed him and shattered his phylactery, freeing Drearings Deep from his tyranny and depriving the Valsharess of her undead troops.
