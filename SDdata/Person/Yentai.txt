'''Yentai''' was an extortionist and an agent of the [[Iron Throne]] who operated a shop in [[Gillian's Hill]] ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].

{{quote|Strange fella, that Yentai. Sets himself up in the dingiest shack in Gillian's Hill and says he's open for business, without even tryin' to pretty the place up first.|Overheard in Gillian's Hill.}}

==Description==
Yentai was a tall man with dusky skin, black hair, and piercing cold eyes.

==Possessions==
He wore a mundane but expensive-looking heavy solid [[gold]] amulet, good enough to have once belonged to a rich monarch or a land-owner.

Yentai's show was set up in Gillian's Hill where he employed two statuesque bodyguards with eyes black as night.

==History==
Before Yentai opened up his store in Gillian's Hill, he resided in the [[Dalelands]] and [[Cormyr]]. He worked as an agent of the [[Iron Throne]], and a mercenary who made sure his clients' troubles "went away." [[Millie Churlgo]] inherited her family business—[[Churlgo Cheese]]—and, being calculating and fiercely competitive, she employed Yentai (at least according to him). The agent of the Throne was well compensated but saw an opportunity to make more. Yentai started trying to copy the halfling family's cheese and eventually started extorting them, forcing the family to flee. Before they left, though, Millie Churlgo planted an altered cheese recipe for Yentai to find. The extortionist cooked up a batch of Churlgo Cheese and served it to the Iron Throne dignitaries without tasting it first. The scandal that ensued came to be known as the "Suzail Cheese Incident."

According to Millie Churlgo, Yentai was plotting, extorting, and harassed many other farmers just like herself.{{fq

}}By [[1372 DR]], Yentai followed the family from the Dalelands to [[Daggerford]]. He settled in Gillian's Hill and started organizing bandit raids on Millie Churlgo's shipments of Churlgo Cheese while working with Millie's disgruntled son [[Porto Churlgo]]. Yentai's end goal was taking the family's cheese recipe and eliminating them. Once Millie Churlgo found out about her son's betrayal, she saw no other way but to assassinate the Iron Throne's lackey. Thankfully, after the "Suzail Cheese Incident," Yentai's standing within the organization was so poor, the Throne would not have sought revenge for his death. When the adventurers confronted Yentai, he attempted to convince the [[Hero of Daggerford]] to betray the halflings' trust. He had plans in place: a barge ready to pick up the Churlgo family as they would flee from Yentai's assassins were the Hero unsuccessful in dealing with the agent of the Throne and his bodyguards. The barge was to take the halfling family and massacre them, freeing the market for Yentai to usurp.

Accounts of the events that followed varied. Some claimed that Yentai was successful in slaughtering the halflings and took over the Churlgo Cheese trade, while others swore that the Hero of Daggerford carried out the assassination on behalf of Millie Churlgo, securing their place on the market.
