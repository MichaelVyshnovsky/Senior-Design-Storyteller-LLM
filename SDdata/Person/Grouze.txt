'''Grouze''' was a [[Dekanter goblin|goblin]] from the ruined mines of [[Dekanter]], that was further transformed into a [[mongrelman]]<ref group="note">While the terms "mongrelmen" or "mongrelfolk" never appear in the ''[[The Nether Scroll]]'' novel, the story does include creatures fitting their description that were associated with [[Beast Lord]], who historically has created mongrelmen. by the [[alhoon|undead]] [[mind flayer]] known across [[the North]] as the [[Beast Lord]].

==History==
Grouze was once a warrior within his goblin community, before he was abducted by the Beast Lord and transformed into what his fellow tribe members referred to as a "demon".

Despite the monstrous form he was given, Grouze was still recognizable by scars he retained from his [[goblinoid]] life. After his death, none of Grouze's  former tribe members would touch his body nor any of his belongings, for fear they would suffer from the same affliction that warped his body.
