        "mainbody": "Marr was a cleric of Gargauth who was active in the Thayan city of Bezantur in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He served as High Priest at Bezanturs Temple of Gargauth.\nMarr was not very competent but he was fanatically devoted to his god, even going so far as to brag about Gargauth visiting the temple to kill members of his congregation.\nAs High Priest at the Temple of Gargauth, Marr led worshipers in evil midnight rituals while wearing black robes and a terrifying mask in the shape of a horned skull.\nIn the late 1360s DR, some came to suggest that Marr was exaggerating or inventing stories of Gargauth visiting the temple. It was proposed that, in fact, Marrs ineptitude had been resulting in the unintended deaths of followers, and the high priest was trying to cover this up."
