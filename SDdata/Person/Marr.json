        "mainbody": "'''Marr''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Gargauth]] who was active in the [[Thayan]] city of [[Bezantur]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He served as High Priest at Bezantur's [[Temple of Gargauth (Bezantur)|Temple of Gargauth]].",
        "Personality": "Marr was not very competent but he was fanatically devoted to his god, even going so far as to brag about Gargauth visiting the temple to kill members of his congregation.",
        "Activities": "As High Priest at the Temple of Gargauth, Marr led worshipers in evil midnight rituals while wearing black [[robe]]s and a terrifying mask in the shape of a horned skull.",
        "History": "In the late 1360s DR, some came to suggest that Marr was exaggerating or inventing stories of Gargauth visiting the temple. It was proposed that, in fact, Marr's ineptitude had been resulting in the unintended deaths of followers, and the high priest was trying to cover this up."
