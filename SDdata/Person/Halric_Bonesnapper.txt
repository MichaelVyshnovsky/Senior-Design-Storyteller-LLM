Halric Bonesnapper was the ruler of Griffons Nest sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Halric was the grandson of the great Kralgar Bonesnapper
Halric lived in comfort in his longhouse where he met other chieftains. He sometimes launched bold raids in fear that other chieftains believed his tribe had lost the favor of Uthgar.
Halric once dreamed of wiping out all the cities of the North but his tribe was too small. He lived in fear that he had truly lost Uthgars favor.
