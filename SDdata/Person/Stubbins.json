        "History": "On the morning of [[Eleint 17]], the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Benelaius's servant [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] harnessed Stubbins and Jenkus to a carriage and took them into Ghars to pick up the War Wizard [[Lindavar]]. On the way back, they stopped when they discovered [[Dovo]]'s headless body.\n\nThat night, Benelaius secretly took Stubbins to ride into the [[Vast Swamp]] and locate the tomb of the long-deceased bandit chieftain [[Fastred]], returning early in the morning. This left Stubbins tired and unexplainedly grubby when Jasper cared for him the following morning. Benelaius rode Stubbins again when he and Jasper returned to the tomb on [[Eleint 20]]."
