'''The Barghest''' was a [[half-orc]] commander of the [[Shining Crusade]] in the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]].

==Personality==
The Barghest had a reputation as a bloodthirsty bandit, well known in taverns as far as [[Soubar]]. However, his personality completely changed after being introduced to [[Caelar Argent]] and her Shining Crusade. He became totally devoted to Caelar, trying his hardest to be a just and honorable knight in her service. He came to view war as an abomination, but felt it was necessary to accomplish the Crusade's ultimate goal of invading [[Avernus]] to rescue the souls lost during the Dragonspear Wars.

==History==
The Barghest was part of a group of bandits operating out of Dragonspear Castle. He participated in both the [[Dragonspear War|first]] and [[second Dragonspear War]], fighting both the [[devil]] invaders, as well as the goodly forces from [[Waterdeep]] and [[Baldur's Gate]]. He survived both conflicts, and was particularly noted for his ruthlessness during the second Dragonspear War.

Roughly a decade later, the Barghest encountered Caelar Argent. She saw the potential for goodness within him, and converted him to her cause. He became an officer in her Shining Crusade, commanding the [[Blinding White battalion]]. In [[1368 DR]], the Barghest's forces lay siege to [[Bridgefort]] near [[Boareskyr Bridge]].

==Activities==
As a commander of the Shining Crusade, the [[Flaming Fist]] offered a bounty of 1,200 [[gp]] for the Barghest's death or capture.
