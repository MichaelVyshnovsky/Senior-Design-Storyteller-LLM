==Description==
Inatra was a bronze-skilled halfâ€“[[high elf]] with blonde hair and brown eyes. She wore [[leather armor]] and wielded a [[long bow]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Slick Inatra worked under ranking Zhents [[Roah Moonglow]] and [[Friol]], forging sticky alliances with [[the Guild]] and the [[Cult of the Absolute]] alike. The Guild began suffering losses at the hands of the [[Stone Lord]], so [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] rolled [[dice]] and hired Zhentarim agents as muscle. Slick Inatra was among the Zhents stationed within the Guild's Guildhall in the city's [[Undercellar]]. Nine-Fingers Keene, however, did not know that Roah and Friol planned a betrayal. Taking out the Guild meant establishing a Zhentish presence in Baldur's Gate. With the city shuddering under the cult's attack, the struggle's outcome and Inatra's fate remained unrecorded.
