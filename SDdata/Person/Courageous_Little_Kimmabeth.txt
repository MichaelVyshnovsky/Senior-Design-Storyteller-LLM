Courageous Little Kimmabeth was a giant inhabitant of the city of Baldurs Gate in late 15 century DR.
Courageous Little Kimmabeth was a humanoid man with bright red hair and beard â€“ an appearance similar to that of Yaga-Shura, a fire giant, killed in the Bhaalspawn crisis. Similarly to the fire giant, Kimmabeth was massive for a human, possibly the result of the mans giant or giant-kin descent.
In the , Courageous Little Kimmabeth was targeted and eventually murdered by Orin the Red, a Bhaalspawn member of the Murder Tribunal that hid its ugly carcass under the streets of Baldurs Gate. In her depraved commitment to Bhaal, the deity of murder, Orin hunted down individuals who came to represent other Bhaalspawn, who pressed a century earlier in the Bhaalspawn crisis. Courageous Little Kimmabeths companions were turned into gore, and the giant himself was turned into a dark effigy to the Lord of Murder in the basement of Franc Peartrees home in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate. His body was gutted, and the heart was carved out, displayed, and lit aflame. The same effigy also used a severed arm of the recently murdered clown Dribbles.
