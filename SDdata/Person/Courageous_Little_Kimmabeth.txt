'''Courageous Little Kimmabeth''' was a [[giant]] inhabitant of the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''The Effigy of [[Yaga-Shura]], who burned his mortality. What use his heart? He thought himself a [[titan]], but died whispering for his mother.''|[[Orin the Red]]}}

==Description==
Courageous Little Kimmabeth was a [[humanoid]] man with bright red hair and beard â€“ an appearance similar to that of Yaga-Shura, a [[fire giant]], killed in the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]]. Similarly to the fire giant, Kimmabeth was massive for a human, possibly the result of the man's giant or giant-kin descent.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Courageous Little Kimmabeth was targeted and eventually murdered by Orin the Red, a Bhaalspawn member of the [[Murder Tribunal]] that hid its ugly carcass under the streets of Baldur's Gate. In her depraved commitment to [[Bhaal]], the deity of murder, Orin hunted down individuals who came to represent other Bhaalspawn, who pressed a century earlier in the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]]. Courageous Little Kimmabeth's companions were turned into gore, and the giant himself was turned into a dark effigy to the Lord of Murder in the basement of [[Franc Peartree]]'s home in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate. His body was gutted, and the heart was carved out, displayed, and lit aflame. The same effigy also used a severed arm of the recently murdered clown [[Dribbles]].
