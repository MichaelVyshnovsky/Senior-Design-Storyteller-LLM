        "mainbody": "Baron '''Ohn''' was a ruler of [[Han Chao]] in [[Tabot]].",
        "History": "When soldiers of [[Shou Lung]] invaded Tabot in {{YearlinkConvert|646|SY}}, the priests and the barbarians of the land were forced to ally against them. Baron Ohn of Han Chao led his warriors and joined with the great sohei [[Ramara]] and the monks and together they repelled the Shou in the [[Battle of Tsagang]].\n\nAfterward, Ohn and Ramara negotiated for ten days and established the [[Peace Land Treaty]] between the tribes and the monks. It legitimized the monks' hermitages (now mountain keeps) and gave them a role in the defense of the lowland tribes and thereby cemented land and peace. They also founded the city of [[Tsagang]] at the site and founded the new nation of Tabot. All present blessed the union and it came to be a holy place and a holy word."
