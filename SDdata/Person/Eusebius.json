        "mainbody": "Eusebius was a storm giant from the storm giant aerie of Lake Woe mountain.This fact is deduced because one of Eusebius companions was Ramos, and Ramos was the former paramount of the storm giant aerie described in Giantcraft.\nEusebius had pale violet skin and blue-black hair that was very long and unkempt. He was clean-shaven. Eusebius typically wore a simple tunic with a large amount of silver jewelry. His eyes were silver-colored.\nEusebius bore a sword in battle.\nBy 1369 DR, the then-paramount of the storm giants of Mount Woe, Anastes, and five other storm giants were summoned magically by Lanaxis to defend him when he needed to rest during his kidnapping of Queen Brianna and her son Kaedlaw. Eusebius was one of those giants. Eusebius was chosen to search the woods for a beehive to gather honey for Brianna to eat, but during this time, Tavis Burdun and armies of giant-kin attacked. Eusebius was then ordered by Anastes to deal with the fomorians. However, the fomorians quickly abandoned the field to pursue Lanaxis, so Eusebius instead assisted Anastes by flanking the firbolg army. Eusebius killed many firbolgs with his lightning and his massive sword, but he was eventually felled by fire magic from the firbolg shaman Munairoe and an arrow from Tavis that had been enchanted by the verbeeg Basil. Eusebius managed to kill Munairoe before he finally died."
