        "mainbody": "'''Eusebius''' was a [[storm giant]] from the [[storm giant aerie of Lake Woe mountain]].<ref group=\"note\">This fact is deduced because one of Eusebius' companions was [[Ramos]], and Ramos was the former [[paramount]] of the storm giant aerie described in ''[[Giantcraft]]''.",
        "Description": "Eusebius had pale violet skin and blue-black hair that was very long and unkempt. He was clean-shaven. Eusebius typically wore a simple tunic with a large amount of silver jewelry. His eyes were silver-colored.",
        "Possessions": "Eusebius bore a sword in battle.",
        "History": "By [[1369 DR]], the then-[[paramount]] of the storm giants of Mount Woe, [[Anastes]], and five other storm giants were summoned magically by [[Lanaxis]] to defend him when he needed to rest during his kidnapping of Queen [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] and her son [[Kaedlaw Burdun|Kaedlaw]]. Eusebius was one of those giants. Eusebius was chosen to search the woods for a beehive to gather [[honey]] for Brianna to eat, but during this time, [[Tavis Burdun]] and armies of [[giant-kin]] attacked. Eusebius was then ordered by Anastes to deal with the [[fomorian]]s. However, the fomorians quickly abandoned the field to pursue Lanaxis, so Eusebius instead assisted Anastes by flanking the [[firbolg]] army. Eusebius killed many firbolgs with his lightning and his massive sword, but he was eventually felled by fire magic from the firbolg [[shaman]] [[Munairoe]] and an arrow from Tavis that had been enchanted by the [[verbeeg]] [[Basil (verbeeg)|Basil]]. Eusebius managed to kill Munairoe before he finally died."
