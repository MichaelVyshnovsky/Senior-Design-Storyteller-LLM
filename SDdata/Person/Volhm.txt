'''Volhm''', the Gentle Lady of Palter, was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] who specialized in developing lightning-based [[spell]]s.<ref name="nem-p112-113>

==Description==
The Gentle Lady was an eminent arcanist, mostly because of the famous spell she created: ''[[lightning bolt]]''. Several other arcanists, and even [[archwizard]]s, paid a visit to her to acquire it. Having an interest in [[elf|elven]] culture and expanding her repertoire of spells, she would only trade knowledge of how to cast ''lightning bolt'' in exchange for elven antiques or spells she had no knowledge of.<ref name="nem-p112-113/>

==History==
Volhm was born in {{YearlinkConvert|1848|NY}}. Three years after she invented her final spell, her ''lightning bolt'' spell still proved very popular. For this reason, she was sought out by [[Jarm]], a rival arcanist. The two engaged in a spell duel to the death in {{YearlinkConvert|1898|NY}}, Volhm was beaten, and Jarm claimed victory. In response, her chaotic students attacked the victor, but all of them were slain by the adroit Jarm.
