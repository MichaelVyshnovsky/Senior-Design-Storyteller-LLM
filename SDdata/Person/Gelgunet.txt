Gelgunet was an active agent of the Cult of Tiamat, operating in the town of Starmantle on the Dragon Coast in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
At the time, Gelgunet was one of the most active and busy agents of the cult. During the imminent expansion of the cult into Westgate and infiltration of the Cult of the Dragon in Sembia, Elminster Aumar warned his fellow Harpers of the threat and recommended the agents of Those Who Harp to keep an eye on Gelgunet.
