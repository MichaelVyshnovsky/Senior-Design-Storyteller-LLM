'''Fusae''' was a mute businesswoman in the town of [[Aru]] in [[Wa]].

==History==
Fusae was the daughter of a famous [[samurai]] general but when she was young her father was involved in a plot against the [[daimyo]] and in punishment her parents were both executed and Fusae and other members of the family were demoted to the [[eta]] caste.

She decided to move to Aru, where she opened the [[House of Heavenly Sand]].

In [[1358 DR]], a [[pilgrim]] was found dead inside Fusae's House. She later told an the adventuring party hired by the [[daimyo]] [[Benju Matsutomo]] that she saw three black-suited men delivering the dead body inside her House.
