'''Arauthator''' was a [[white dragon]] who lived in [[Oyaviggaton]] in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].

==History==
Arauthator was orphaned as a wyrmling in [[940 DR]] when the [[archmage]] [[Tulrun]] slaughtered his entire family in revenge for his mother Sneighfanglen killing the [[crystal dragon]] [[Krustalonos]], a close companion of Tulrun.{{Cite polyhedron/125/Wayward Wizards: Tulrun of the Tent}} The dragon spent much of his early life plotting revenge against his family's killer. In [[1279 DR]], he sent the first of many waves of attackers against his enemy's stronghold of [[Tulrun's Tent]]. Ten years later in [[1289 DR]], Tulrun met Arauthator face-to-face, not looking to kill him but rather to parley. Arauthator agreed to not attack the civilised parts of the [[Silver Marches]] in exchange for Tulrun leaving him alone.

Arauthator strongly valued protecting and maintaining his domain against traps, enemies, and overhunting. To that end, he destroyed the [[frost giant]] community of [[Bulindiful]] and the [[bugbear]] hold located within [[Sardin's Sword]]. He and the white dragon [[Ingeloakastimizilian]] came to an uneasy truce to avoid a mutually destructive battle over rulership of the [[Reghed Glacier]] prior to the latter's death. Arauthator avoided [[Icewind Dale]] even after his rival's death.

Arauthator gained fame in [[1324 DR]] for slaying the [[red dragon]] [[Rathalylaug]] above the city of [[Neverwinter]] as well as the [[sorcerer|sorceress]] [[Shareera]] when he smashed her tower in his triumph. He was also known for killing the [[Host Tower of the Arcane|Hosttower]] mage [[Phaurothlin]] over contested claims to a [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[spellbook]] by freezing and shattering the mage against a mountain, and for shoving the [[blue dragon]] [[Eltagrathuuloor]] into a mountain (and subsequently burying them alive in a rockslide) during a visit to a [[Magefair]] in [[Var the Golden]].

Arauthator was among the dozen or so dragons that attacked the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in [[Luskan]] due to [[Sammaster]]'s [[Rage of Dragons]] in [[1373 DR]]. When part of the tower fell, Arauthator made off with a good deal of magical items, including a few powerful, priceless tomes. 

While Lonefang Mountain remained his primary lair, Arauthator established several smaller lairs in the icebergs of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. One such lair was [[Oyaviggaton]], from which he would meet with his mate [[Arveiaturace]]. 

In [[1484 DR]] Arauthator and his son [[Aurbangras]] allied with the [[orc]] and [[drow]] forces that assaulted [[Luruar]] during the [[Darkening]]; he also was ridden by [[Tiago Baenre]] in the assault against [[Nesme]].

==Relationships==
Arauthator's mother was the [[Sneighfanglen|"Spawn of Auril", Sneighfanglen]]. She, her mate and all of Arauthator's siblings were killed when he was a wyrmling. 

Arauthator's first mate was [[Ghaulantatra|Ghaulantatra, the "Old Mother Wyrm"]], but he seemingly did not care when she was killed.

Arauthator's mate after that was [[Arveiaturace]]. They had offspring, including [[Aurbangras]].

Arauthator is said to have killed more than 20 of his own offspring defending his territory from ambitious dragons.
