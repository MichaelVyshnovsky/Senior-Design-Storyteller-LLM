Nok was a goblin who lived in the Lower Heart ward of Skullport in Undermountain around 1370 DR, and twin to Nyk.
Nok and Nyk were a pair of enterprising goblins who swept up the dung left by the Raging Bull, a long-imprisoned minotaur suspended from the ceiling by The Deepfires inn. They used the dung as manure to grow mushrooms. They would tell stories about failed rescue attempts for a copper piece.
