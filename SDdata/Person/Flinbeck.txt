Flinbeck was a druid of Thorngap in the late 15 century DR.
Sometime around the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon, Flinbeck lived as a druid at the circle of Thorngap. Unfortunately, the respected druid Halsaime became corrupted by the powers of his strange staff and became a destructive and malevolent force of nature. Flinbeck was one of the druids that joined his cause, either of his own accord or the powerful will that Halsaime exerted, and guarded Thorn Hollow with dire bears until overcome by retributive Harper agents sent from Eveningstar by Kirinel Zay.
