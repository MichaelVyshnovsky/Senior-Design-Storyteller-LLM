We are not Shadowscales, we are Sharptooths!|Kruthaak.}}\n'''Kruthaak''' was a female [[lizardfolk]] of the [[Sharptooth]] tribe in the [[Vast Swamp]] of [[Cormyr]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].<ref group=\"note\">From the text, it is unclear which of Kruthaak and Ghaan is the female lizardfolk which is the male [[Poison Dusk]]; it is assumed they are named in the same order they are described.\n\nShe was captured by the [[Shadowscales]] and taken to the [[Lost Refuge]]. Kruthaak, [[Steersissk]], and [[Ghaan]] escaped through the [[Dusk Lord's Passage]] but found themselves in the [[Shadow Swamp]] in the [[Plane of Shadow]], and were recaptured. In early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Kruthaak and Ghaan were kept in the prisoner pit of the [[Shadowscale Warren]], awaiting transformation into [[shadowslain]] and becoming Shadowscales themselves. They may have been rescued by adventurers in service to [[Mystra]], and shared what they knew."
