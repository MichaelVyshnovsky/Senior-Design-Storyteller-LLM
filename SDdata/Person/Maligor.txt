'''Maligor''' was the [[Zulkir]] of [[Transmutation|Alteration]] in [[Thay]] until the {{YearlinkName|1362}}.

{{quote|''Maligor detested age. He considered it his only weakness and the one thing that could possibly stand in his way of eventually becoming the ruler of all of Thay. So he fought it the only way he knew howwith his elixirs, powders, and arcane scrolls that hinted his soul was no longer his own. But Maligor never feared the repercussions of his magic or the well-being of his immortal spirit. He fully intended to live forever and let the dark forces that hungered for him be damned.''}}

==Description==
The Zulkir was a bald, pale, thin man with a tattoo atop his skull demonstrating his devotion to [[Myrkul]].

His preferred clothes were the Red Wizards robes of Thaydark red color. The robes' sleeves were long enough to cover his fingertips, the folds hid his body shape, and its hood hung over his wrinkled face. 

==Personality==
Reckless and evil, the wizard enjoyed the suffering of his victims. Like all [[Red Wizard]]s, Maligor constantly plotted the downfall of his fellow wizards.

==Possessions==
Maligor owned a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]'', along with a ''[[cloak of protection]]'' and a ''[[ring of flying]]''. He wielded a ''[[staff of the magi]]'', a ''[[crystal ball]]'' and wore a ''[[robe of the archmagi]]''.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|742|Maligor the Red Wizard}}

Maligor’s numerous slaves had a thorny vine tattooed around their necks forming a collar of sorts.

==Relationships==
The Zulkir of Alteration built an army of 300 [[human]] troops and 1200 battle-hardened [[gnoll]]s which he wished to unleash upon Thay. Using his magical talents, the Red Wizard created a multitude of [[darkenbeast]]s to comprise his second force. Aiding Maligor in controlling his empire was the [[spirit naga]] [[Asp (spirit naga)|Asp]], who fed off her master's desire for power. [[Jutta]] was his trusted apprentice.

==History==
Around [[1218 DR]], the younger red wizard managed to kill a dragon, an achievement he often reminisced about later in life.

By 1362 DR, Maligor appeared, softspoken, and frail, but he was over 200 years old prolonging his life with his secret elixirs and concoctions. He has been a Red Wizard and a Zulkir for many years when he plotted to seize control of both Thay and then [[Aglarond]]. His plan comprised of an assault on a minor Red Wizard holding by his gnoll army while his main force of magically transformed darkenbeasts seized control of the main [[Thayvian gold mines|Thayan gold mines]]. However, an unlikely alliance between the [[Zulkir]] of [[Necromancy]] [[Szass Tam]] and the [[Harpers]] [[Galvin]], [[Brenna Graycloak]], and [[Wynter]] the [[centaur]] thwarted his plot and Maligor died when the mines he had planned to seize collapsed on him.
