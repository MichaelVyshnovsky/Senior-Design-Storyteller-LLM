Moriandro was a woman living in Lliiress during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Moriandros frame was exceedingly lithe, coming off harsh under her sharp, angular features, despite their pleasant warmth. She had wide eyes. Also, she wore a light dress.
Moriandro answered Kinase Bronihims questions when he entered the town of Lliiress in , after someone brought him to her. She also explained to him the history of the town.
After Kinase bumped his head onto the barrier trying to run away from town, Moriandro nursed him back to health.
