'''Narrak''' was a [[derro]] savant cultist of [[Demogorgon]] in [[Gracklstugh]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Narrak's area of expertise was demonology.

==Activities==
Narrak was a junior member of the [[Council of Savants]] and a long-time cultist of Demogorgon. 

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], he gathered a small retinue of followers and started a plot to deliver the city to the [[demon lord]]. The first step in his plan was to curse the [[stone giant]]s of [[Clan Clairngorm]] with Demogorgon's madness. He was waiting for a delivery from [[Droki]] when an adventuring party escaping from [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]] ruined his plan and defeated him.
