'''Sephek Kaltro''' ({{Pronounce|SEH|fek|_|KAWL|troh|refs=}}) was a sailor who lived during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], who enjoyed a second existence as the [[undead]] host to a [[spirit]] in the service of [[Auril]].

==Description==
As it was his presumed age at the time of his death, Sephek appeared as a man in his thirties. He had tan skin and dark hair he often wore pulled back in a ponytail.

Fitting for a servant of the Frostmaiden, Sephek's eyes were said to have been as blue as a lake of ice.

==Abilities==
Due to his supernatural existence, Sephek was able to [[misty step|teleport through mist]] up to three times per day.

He did not give in to any form of fear, and was immune to both ''[[charm]]'' magic and harmful coldness. In fact he thrived in extreme cold, gaining a form of [[regenerate|regeneration]] while in sub-zero temperatures.

==Possessions==
Unlike the warm-blooded mortals who lived in the [[Far North]], the undead Sephek did not have to bundle himself in cold-weather clothing. The clothing he did wear was reminiscent of the styles found across the [[Sword Coast]].

He wielded weapons made of pure ice, which he could summon as he willed.

==Activities==
During undeath, Sephek masqueraded as a mere bodyguard in service to the corrupt caravan-master [[Torga Icevein]]. In truth, he served as Auril's agent of death. He collected the lives of those individuals who sought to cheat their way out of the sacrificial lottery that was established by the leaders of the [[Ten Towns]]. 

==History==
While he was a mortal man, Sephek earned his living as a seaman. When his ship crashed near the isle of [[Solstice]], in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]], Sephek was left stranded and nearly froze to death. During his final moments, his body was possessed by the spirit of one of Auril's deceased frost [[druid]]s.
