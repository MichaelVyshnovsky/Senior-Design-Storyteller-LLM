Jaddat never wore jewelry of any kind, believing it to be a sign of vanity.\nShe spent most of her time discussing town matters with citizens since Madinat al-Mumin did not have a formal court.\nJaddat owned a mahogany cane that she used as a walking aid.\nJaddat was a direct descendant of Jamila bint-Susan the Virtuous. She was married to Jadd Alai."
