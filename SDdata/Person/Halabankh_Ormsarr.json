        "mainbody": "Halabankh Ormsarr was a human illusionist and a Merchant Duke of the city of Calaunt in the Vast in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHalabankh was formerly an adventurer in Bellass Band, under Bellas Thanatar. Each member of the band grew wealthy by following Bellass orders.\nAround the 1330s DR, Bellass Band took power in the city of Calaunt. Bellas named himself Supreme Scepter, while Halabankh took the title of Merchant Duke.\nHalabankh and the dukes grew increasingly wealthy and powerful by following Bellas and supporting his rule. In all decisions on major policies, Halabankh had one vote while Bellas had two.\nHalabankh and the Dukes often confiscated property and magic from visitors, allegedly \"for the benefit of the city\", but mostly used it only for personal gain and use, to increase their power. They acquired a large collection of magical items this way, and still sought more.\nHalabankh had forty apprentices who all served as battle-mages in The Teeth of Calaunt, the citys standing army.\nHe lived in a palatial house close to the Fortress of the Five Vultures."
