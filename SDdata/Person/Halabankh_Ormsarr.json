        "mainbody": "'''Halabankh Ormsarr''' was a [[human]] [[illusionist]] and a [[Merchant Duke]] of the city of [[Calaunt]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Halabankh was formerly an [[adventurer]] in [[Bellas's Band]], under [[Bellas Thanatar]]. Each member of the band grew wealthy by following Bellas's orders.\n\nAround the 1330s DR, Bellas's Band took power in the city of Calaunt. Bellas named himself [[Supreme Scepter]], while Halabankh took the title of [[Merchant Duke]].",
        "Activities": "Halabankh and the dukes grew increasingly wealthy and powerful by following Bellas and supporting his rule. In all decisions on major policies, Halabankh had one vote while Bellas had two.\n\nHalabankh and the Dukes often confiscated property and magic from visitors, allegedly \"for the benefit of the city\", but mostly used it only for personal gain and use, to increase their power. They acquired a large collection of [[magical item]]s this way, and still sought more.\n\nHalabankh had forty apprentices who all served as battle-mages in [[The Teeth of Calaunt]], the city's standing army.\n\nHe lived in a palatial house close to the [[Fortress of the Five Vultures]]."
