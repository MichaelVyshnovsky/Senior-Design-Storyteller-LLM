'''Maelestor Rex''' was a very old and particularly fearsome [[black dragon]]. He was perhaps best known for making a deal with the [[devil]] [[Vesarius]] and being forced to fight within the fiend's army during the [[Second Dragonspear War]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Unlike other dragons of his kind, Maelestor Rex was exceptionally intelligent. He possessed a great desire to learn as much as he could about the nature of [[magic]] and spellcasting.

==History==
In the past, Maelestor Rex made a bargain with the [[cornugon]] [[Vesarius]] in order to learn some unique [[spell]]s. In exchange, Vesarius only wanted one of his horns.The two struck a deal. Vesarius bestowed upon Maelestor Rex the information he desired, in exchange for one of his horns.

The dragon lived his life with little regard to the exchange, nearly forgetting about it entirely. Around the {{YearlinkName|1363}},

;Dragonspear War:
Maelestor Rex was compelled by the devil and his spear to lay waste to the [[Misty Forest]], killing many [[elves]] that lived within. Shortly thereafter, he was directed to ravage the lands surrounding [[Daggerford]] and wound up destroying [[The Way Inn]]. 

He fought alongside Vesarius' devilish army during the final battle of the Second Dragonspear War  and devastated the combined forces of [[Army of Daggerford|Daggerford]] and [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|Waterdeep]], the [[Knights of Ilmater|knights]] fighting under the banner of [[Ilmater]], [[Uhmbrick's Rangers]], and the local elves and [[dwarves]] that took up arms with their allies. 

However, a band of [[adventurer]]s had just recovered the ''dragonspear'' from the labyrinth beneath Dragonspear Castle and presented it to Maelestor Rex. The dragon was delighted as he knew its destruction would free him from Vesarius' control. He flew down close to the group of heroes and released a stream of acid from his maw that destroyed the ''dragonspear'' and returned to him his free will. 

As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Maelestor was still alive and kept his lair in the [[High Moor]].
