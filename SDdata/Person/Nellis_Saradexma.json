        "mainbody": "ellis Saradexma was an Imaskari human wizard who served as the ambassador of High Imaskar.\nNellis was tall and thin, and had gray lines, like those of genasi, adorning his skin in intricate patterns.\nIn 1479 DR, Nellis served as the ambassador of High Imaskar in Tymanther. When ambassador Perra was banished from Chessenta, she discovered that High Imaskar and Akan√ªl had began diplomatic relationships. Nellis was summoned by Vanquisher Tarhun to explain this, but the Imaskari was unable to do so.\nWhen Tchazzar began to prepare to invade Tymanther, Tarhun sent Nellis, alongside the paladin Medrash, Balasar, Biri, Khouryn Skulldark of the Brotherhood of the Griffon, and the Platinum Cadre, back to High Imaskar in order to procure the military aid of the Imaskari to help them halt the invading Chessentan forces. After Empress Ususi agreed to help the dragonborn, Nellis was tasked with aiding them during the operation to search for and destroy Gestaniius."
