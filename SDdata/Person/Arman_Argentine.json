Now we just need a few more hands to mine the Jewels. And then we'll all be rich!<br/>You can be too, if you join us.\n|Arman\n}}\nAfter the Tethyamar expedition got into full swing, Arman traveled to [[Eveningstar]] in [[Cormyr]] to spread the good word about the impossibly wonderful gemstones to be found there, the Jewels of Ardor. He brought some samples with him to show off, and began recruiting optimistic and opportunistic locals and [[adventurer]]s to join the effort, unaware of the danger waiting for them."
