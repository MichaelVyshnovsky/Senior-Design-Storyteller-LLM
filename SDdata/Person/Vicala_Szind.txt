Vicala Szind was a powerful priestess of Lolth of House Szind that served her goddess during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar and the hunt for the Thread of the Weave in the 1480s DR.
In drow tradition, Vicala wore an elaborate outfit that bared much of her skin and had many sharp angles.
Like many priestesses of Lolth, Vicala had boundless megalomania and cruelty, aimed at whoever was weaker than her.
Vicala could call on a number of powerful divine spells from her mistress, including symbol of pain, cometfall, unholy blight, and flame strike.
Vicalas sacrificial dagger was a powerful blade soaked in the blood of many innocents.
During the Darkening, Vicala was sent to shake down the outlying farmsteads around Eveningstar while other groups attacked the village proper. She was accompanied by a number of drow, including the Blademaster Speitar DunRobar, and her pet giant spider Akorstra. Their surprise attack captured the Midler farmhouse and the entire Midler family, who were held hostage in their own home and interrogated for any clues regarding the Thread of the Weave, kept paralysed by her wizards. Her forces missed the cook Maisby, who hid in the farm shed for a day and night before escaping to Eveningstar to get help. With limited forces to spare, Vicben Arroway and another Purple Dragon knight arrived, only to be captured and tortured themselves.
A second group consisting of adventurers arrived next, who found Vicben alive and struck at Vicala Szind, only to see her drain the life force from him to restore her own vitality. With his dying breath Vicben warned that she could magically sacrifice all ten of the Midler captives or even her own followers to protect herself, forcing the adventurers to avoid battle with Vicala while stealthily freeing the prisoners and eliminating her forces. Despite her efforts, Vicala was unable to withstand the final assault and fell, finally leaving the Midlers in peace.
