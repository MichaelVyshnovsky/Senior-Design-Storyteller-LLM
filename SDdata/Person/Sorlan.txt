Sorlan was a ghost in the Doomvault dungeon in 1486 DR.
Sorlan hated the Red Wizards but had become crazy. If someone proved to be an enemy of the Red Wizards, Sorlan would helped them, but it was no easy task.
During his life, Sorlan was an adventurer who was captured by the Red Wizards of Thay and transported to the Doomvault dungeon where he was subjected to horrible experiments until he died. As a cruel twist of fate, he rose as a ghost but was eternally bound to the place of his death. In 1486 DR, Sorlan was still waiting for some end to his torments.
