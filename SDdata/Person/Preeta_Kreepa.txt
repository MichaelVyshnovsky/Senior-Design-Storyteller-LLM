Preeta Kreepa was a twisted wizard in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Preeta lived in hiding in a stone hovel inside the hobgoblin settlement in the Sargauth Level ruled by Azrok. She was busy raising drow corpses using the animate dead spell in order to create an army for Azrok.
Once Preeta was a wizard assistant of Arcturia, who nevertheless performed horrible experiments upon her. So she escaped and settled inside the hobgoblin settlement in the Sargauth Level the fearful hobgoblins left her alone.
In 1492 DR, however, the menace of the drow of House Auvryndar forced Azrok to ask Preeta for help and she agreed.
Preeta had a mouth twice as large as normal size full of sharp teeth, and two beholder eyestalks sprouting from her eye sockets. The eyestalks emitted a fear ray and a paralyzing ray.
She wore the skin of a kuo-toa as a cloak.
