Having passed it off as the work of another author, she and her fellow actors actually performed the play on Sigil. When Duke Blackwood got wind of the performers he sent bounty hunters after the troupe.\nIn the , Raelis companion HaerDalis tried to steal a portal gem from the mage Mekrath in Athkatla, in order that the troupe could escape Toril via the Astral Plane. Unfortunately HaerDalis was caught and imprisoned within Mekraths lair in Athkatlas sewer system.\nDuring that time the troupe tried to continue to put on plays in the theater beneath the Five Flagons. Unfortunately their new understudy Biff did not have the same acting chops as Haerdalis."
