Theras was a half-elf druid and the bastard child of a prince.
Clad in brown robes and a green cloak, Theras had lengthy brown hair, partially worked into a braid over his right ear.
Theras owned a magical hornblade scimitar, in addition to an enchanted suit of leather armor and a mundane shield.
Although he was a forest-dwelling druid, Theras was resented by his legitimate half-brother. When Therass forest was burned down by his half-brother, he fled, only to return a decade later. Theras exacted revenge by strangling his brother with the foliage of the regrown forest.
