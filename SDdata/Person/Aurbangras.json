The two dragons allowed Tiago Baenre to ride one of them into battle. The dragons believed that by doing this they could court the favor of Tiamat and bring \"it\" back (what \"it\" refers to is unclear).\nIn the closing stages of the War of the Silver Marches Aurbangras was killed.\nAurbangras was the son of Arauthator, better known as \"Old White Death,\" and presumably of his mate Arveiaturace."
