        "mainbody": "'''Aurbangras''' was a young [[white dragon]].",
        "History": "In [[1484 DR]], during the [[Darkening]] in [[Luruar]], Aurbangras and his father [[Arauthator]] were allied with the [[drow]] [[Quenthel Baenre]] and [[Gromph Baenre]]. The two dragons allowed [[Tiago Baenre]] to ride one of them into battle. The dragons believed that by doing this they could court the favor of [[Tiamat]] and bring \"it\" back (what \"it\" refers to is unclear).\nIn the closing stages of the [[War of the Silver Marches]] Aurbangras was killed.",
        "Relationships": "Aurbangras was the son of Arauthator, better known as \"Old White Death,\" and presumably of his mate [[Arveiaturace]]."
