        "mainbody": "'''Myrna''' was a pet, presumably a large [[dog]], who belonged to [[Lenore De Hurst]] of [[Mystra]] sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''In memory of Myrnaâ€”a shining light in this dark world. May you forever gaze upon the lake you loved to play in.''|Inscription on Myrna's gravestone}}",
        "Possessions": "Myrna's only possession was a [[leather]] [[collar (animal)|collar]] with various magic runes and the dog's name engraved on its tag. On the 4{{th}} floor of Myrna's home, the [[Arcane Tower]], the dog could push a button that would dispense a juicy uncooked [[steak]]. The button only worked if the dog, or any other creature, was wearing Myrna's rune-engraved collar.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Myrna was long dead. The dog's mistress interred her pet on an outcropping overlooking the Arcane Tower in the [[Underdark]] under the [[Western Heartlands]]. Lenore De Hurst made sure that the grave overlooked the lake in which Myrna liked to play in the past. The dog's gravestone was created via the ''[[stone shape]]'' [[spell]] with [[autumncrocus]] flowers planted on the grave. Myrna's collar was buried with the dead beast."
