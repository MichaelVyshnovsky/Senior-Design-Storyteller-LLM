        "mainbody": "Myrna was a pet, presumably a large dog, who belonged to Lenore De Hurst of Mystra sometime before the late 15 century DR.\nMyrnas only possession was a leather collar with various magic runes and the dogs name engraved on its tag. On the 4 floor of Myrnas home, the Arcane Tower, the dog could push a button that would dispense a juicy uncooked steak. The button only worked if the dog, or any other creature, was wearing Myrnas rune-engraved collar.\nBy the , Myrna was long dead. The dogs mistress interred her pet on an outcropping overlooking the Arcane Tower in the Underdark under the Western Heartlands. Lenore De Hurst made sure that the grave overlooked the lake in which Myrna liked to play in the past. The dogs gravestone was created via the stone shape spell with autumncrocus flowers planted on the grave. Myrnas collar was buried with the dead beast."
