'''Grocknock''' was an [[ettin]] and the patriarch of a family of ettins who lived near [[Harvestshield Mountain]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
The two heads of Grocknock hated each other, and would loudly bicker with each other. In battles, Grock planned strategy for the ettin tribe while Knock actually led them in battle, often ignoring the plan.

==History==
Grocknock's family frequently attacked [[Snarlclaw]]'s gang of [[troll]]s in competition for territory. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, both groups were forced to serve [[Mrolgyet's Legion]], and their members were branded with the Legion's symbol. On [[Mrolgyet]]'s orders to retrieve the [[Anvil of Dumathoin]], Snarlclaw's trolls were forced to dig a tunnel from Harvestshield Mountain into the [[Frostsilver Mines]] while Grocknock's ettins broke and extracted their teeth to force them to keep digging. Once inside the Mines, Grocknock deployed [[rust monster]]s provided by Mrolgyet to begin breaking through the metal doors that guarded the hidden forges deep beneath the Mines.

During the search for the Anvil, a group of [[adventurer]]s in the service of the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], [[Laeral Silverhand]], caught up to him and soundly defeated him in battle. They then interrogated both Grock and Knock, and learned about the plan to retrieve the Anvil. The trolls and ettins soon realized that Grocknock had betrayed them, and began to panic about the consequences.
