'''Barrom Quiverleaf''' was a [[half-elf]] [[wizard]] who restlessly searched for a mysterious woman.

==Possessions==
He owned a selection of magical items: a pair of ''[[boots of elvenkind]]'', a ''[[cloak of the bat]]'', as well as a ''[[ring of sustenance]]'' given to him by his mysterious benefactor.

==Activities==
Barrom was approached by an enigmatic woman who promised to reward him with long life and great knowledge if he could find her again.
