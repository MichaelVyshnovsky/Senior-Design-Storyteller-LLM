'''Girella Scatterstar''' was the head of the [[Mage Guild]] in [[Hillsfar]] in [[1373 DR]].

==History==
Around [[1372 DR]], after the disappearance of [[Glinda Scatterstar]], Girella arrived in the city and claimed her sister's position. Despite some conflicts with the senior members, most of the mages welcomed her. Girella directed the guild much like her sister. Many even believed Girella was only a new identity for Glinda, but they were mistaken. In fact, Girella was a [[doppelganger]] [[wizard]] who had studied Glinda well. Slowly, Girella was directing the guild to a more neutral position with the objective of step-by-step filling the guild with evil members and even allying with [[Maalthiir]] in the future.
