Barden Datharathi was a member of the Datharathi chaka of Durpar. He was present in the meeting which his third cousin Warian Datharathi attended in Tarsakh of  soon after returning to Vaelan. One of his arms was a svelte plangent prosthetic. He rubbed his hands in unison with Sevaera Datharathi, Corlaen Datharathi, and Xaemar Datharathi at one point during the meeting, a gesture owed to the influence of Shaddon Datharathi.
