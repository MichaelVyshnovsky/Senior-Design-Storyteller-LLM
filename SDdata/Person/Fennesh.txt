{{quote|''Hrmph. speak if ye must. Just don't make me read anything. I'm up to my eyeballs in paperwork. The Council must have me mistook for one of their bureaucrats!''|Captain Fennesh}}

==Description==
Fennesh was a stout and extremely muscular [[dwarf]] of intimidating physical presence. He wore a set of [[splint mail]] in the uniform colors of the city guard. His brown beard was decoratively braided, and a bald spot shone from the back of the dwarf's head.

==Personally==
He was a brash and impatient man who valued his time and hated small talk and questions.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Captain Fennesh grew increasingly frustrated with the overwhelming bureaucratic paperwork he and his city guard were forced to fill. He thought forms and reports took away time that would be better used for arresting criminals.
