        "mainbody": "Astar Graysteel was a disgraced Blade of Mulmaster and an adventuring mercenary, active in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nAt the time of his death, he was forty-odd years old. Astar was a grim-faced, tall, and muscular human male. In his later years, he had salt-and-pepper greying hair and icy-blue eyes that matched it. His body language and stature betrayed his formidable skills of a warrior. The man had a deep and confident voice.\nAstar Graysteel was an honorable man who was forced to take a blade as a mercenary. He was a grim yet kind man who often fought for glory and to defend the vulnerable. As a mercenary, Astar learned to prepare for battle against a variety of opponents, to carry enchanted arms, and be stocked up on potions.\nAstar Graysteel was armed with an enchanted +2 longsword and a magic +2 shield. He had a cloak of protection draped over his muscular shoulders. He was armored in a set of enchanted half-plate. Astar used his enchanted ring as a wedding ring that he put on his beloved wifes finger.\nAstar Graysteel was born in the city of Mulmaster on the Moonsea. Eventually, he became one of the Blades of Mulmaster, and stayed with the organization until the mid-14 century DR. His life was filled with dangers and double-crossings in service of the High Blade of Mulmaster – Selfaril Uoumdolphin. Astar built a family after meeting and swiftly falling in love with Lana Graysteel. She received Astars magic ring as a wedding band. Years later, after betraying his master, Astar Graysteel was forced to flee Mulmaster. He was falsely denounced as a criminal, forcing Astar to leave his beloved wife behind. In order to save her life, Astar left her in the dark about the true reasons for his departure, leaving Lana heartbroken. In the years that followed, Graysteel fought for coin and fought for good across the Sword Coast, in the far North, and through the Western Heartlands with the Flaming Fist, the Swords of Tempus, and the Crimson Guard.\nIn the winter of the , strife and discord shook the trade routes of the Moonsea. A sinister new organization rose to terrorize the southern Moonsea region – the Order of the Crippled Fang. It was known for flooding the roads with fiends from lower planes. Several weeks after the Cults attacks started, many communities of the Moonsea were in a state of panic, especially after an attack on Teshwave and constant presence along the Shind Road. Astar heard whispers of the Cult raising on the Moonsea. At the time, Astar was fulfilling his contract in Cormyr, wiping out a gang of murderous orcs. Once he collected the pay, the warrior headed to the city of Voonlar, where he roomed at the Swords Meet tavern for several days. One evening, the town was quaked and flooded with fiends of the Order. Astar Graysteel, along with city guards and several other adventurers, defended the settlement and saved lives.\nThe morning after the attack, Astar Graysteel met the Hero of Daggerford, who helmed the defense and killed several members of the Cult who attacked a temple in Voonlar. Joined by Harper Sharalyn Lockleaf, mage Eremuth Silverwind, and an undead rogue Lyressa, the group set out to stop the dreaded new threat to the Moonsea.\nHe kept his enchanted armor and wore it during his years of mercenary work away from home. He wore the half plate until his death at the tentacles of a malaugrym masquerading as his comrade Eremuth Silverwind in the . Honoring his dying wish, the Hero of Daggerford and Astars companions traveled to Mulmaster and gave the grieving woman Astars letter that revealed the truth about his departure. Saddened but relieved, she gave up Astars ring as a way of turning a new page in her life."
