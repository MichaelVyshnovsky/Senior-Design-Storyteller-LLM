Hylos Nimarel was an elven hunter who lived in Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
Hylos had light skin, blue-green eyes, and short white hair.
Around the time of the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the mid-1480s DR, Hylos visited Eveningstar with his cart and oxen. He took note of the interest in the Storm Horns mountains by adventurers and Purple Dragons at the time.
