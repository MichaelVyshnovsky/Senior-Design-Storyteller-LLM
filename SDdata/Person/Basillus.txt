'''Basillus''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Cyric]] who went mad after his family died.

==History==
Originally from [[Zhentil Keep]], Basillus left the [[Moonsea]] after the tragedy that claimed the lives of his family members and wound up living in the [[Sword Coast]]. In the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], Basillus murdered a significant number of innocent people, including [[Footy]]'s family and [[Netty]]'s father. He raised them as [[undead]] [[zombie]]s and [[skeleton]]s, believing them to be the family which he had lost before.

That same year, Governor [[Kelddath Ormlyr]] of [[Beregost]] placed a 5,000 [[gp]] bounty on Basillus' head. He tasked those who sought to stop the murderous cleric with the return of his [[holy symbol]].
