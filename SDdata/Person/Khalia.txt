'''Khalia''' was a diplomat for the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] around [[1372 DR]]. She possessed a calm, yet passionate demeanor. Extremely cautious in how she conducted her work, she visited foreign nations of behalf of the Red Wizards to further the expansion of their power base through the construction of their enclaves. Along with negotiating profits and establishing cordial relationships, she was often used in the presentation of gifts to various heads of state. As she needed to be in order to fulfill her duties, Khalia was among the most restrained and reasoning of the Red Wizards.
