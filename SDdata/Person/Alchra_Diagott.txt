'''Alchra Diagott''' was a [[lich]] [[conjurer]] who became trapped in the [[Underdark]] soul-entrapment device called the [[Facet sphere]].

==Possessions==
The lich carried many scrolls for powerful spells: ''[[delayed blast fireball]]'', ''[[summon nishruu]]'', and ''[[spell turning]]''.

==History==
Prior to [[1369 DR]], Alchra became trapped in the third-from-right facet of the Facet sphere. Unlike others, he managed to retain his mental stability. Even after been released, he would "reward" his liberators by going all out in attempting to kill them.
