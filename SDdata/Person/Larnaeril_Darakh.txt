'''Larnaeril Darakh''', who was also called the '''Fiendwitch''', was a vile [[human]] woman who readily submitted herself to the lusts of the [[demon lord]] [[Orcus]].

==Relationships==
The child born of Larnaeril's coupling with Orcus, a son named [[Jesthren Darakh|Jesthren]], was born in {{Yearlink|-431}}. Orcus' progeny would end the line of [[Orgolath Dynasty|Orgolath]] [[Nentyarch]]s in [[Narfell]] and begin the [[Darakh Dynasty]] in {{Yearlink|-399}} and continue to rule until the fall of Narfell in {{Yearlink|-150}}.
