Akamar al-Jawahirji was an accomplished merchant living in Huzuz, the City of Delights, around 1367 DR.
Akamar preferred to wear a simple smock and long striped caftan. His sleeves were cut away for comfort. Akamar was a short and stocky man who made himself appear taller by wrapping his turban around a tall bulky fez.
Akamar sold pearls imported from Gana.
