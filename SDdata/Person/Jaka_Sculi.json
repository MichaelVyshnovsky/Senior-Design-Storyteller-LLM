        "mainbody": "aka Sculi was a rash young man in the town of Auckney, nestled along the Cold Run.\nJaka was rather self-centered and felt he was better than everyone else. He \"fell in love\" with Meralda Ganderlay only after learning of Lord Feringal Aucks interest in her. He spent a lot of time away from the town cursing his lot and life, particularly when it came to his \"love.\"  \nJaka originally came from Luskan but moved to Auckney with his mother in 1365 DR. He and his mother were distant descendants of the mercenary princes of the Blade Kingdoms.\nAround 1369 DR, being possessive of his love-interest Meralda, he vowed to the gods that he would take her virginity, for the sole reason that the Lord, whos eyes she had caught, wouldnt get it. He fathered one child but died before it was born. He fell off the sea cliffs during Meraldas wedding to the Lord of Auckney, Feringal Auck while shouting Meraldas name. Meralda wedded Lord Feringal in order to save her mothers life. The child was named Colson after being adopted by Wulfgar and Delly Curtie.\nNovels\nThe Spine of the World\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryInhabitants of Luskan\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Auckney\nCategoryInhabitants of the Cold Run\nCategoryInhabitants of the Frozenfar\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of the Blade Kingdoms\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vilhon Reach\nCategoryInhabitants\n7r11hmqedxphpr2jlokoezewn2bmnex"
