        "mainbody": "Kimmuriel Oblodra was a powerful psionicist of Menzoberranzan and one of the few survivors of the destruction of House Oblodra. He often served as the de facto leader of Bregan Daerthe while Jarlaxle romped around the surface world. \nKimmuriel had an expressionless face that Jarlaxle often referred to as \"soulless.\"\nIn stark contrast to other members of his family, Kimmuriel was unemotional, usually stony-faced and very difficult to get even the slightest of smiles out of, much less a laugh. His humor was very dry but often superbly clever. He had an \"arrogant dislike\" for the arcane arts, but he was willing to work with wizards.\nOriginally, Kimmuriels stance was that he would much rather improve his psionic powers or study illithids than look after Bregan Daerthe. As such, whenever he got the chance, he tried to persuade Jarlaxle to come back to Menzoberranzan so that he could get back to his own work.\nJarlaxle rescued Kimmuriel from certain death when House Oblodra was destroyed by House Baenre in 1358 DR. When Rai-guy turned against Jarlaxle in 1366 DR, he was killed and Kimmuriel became Jarlaxles second-in-command, essentially becoming the de facto leader of Bregan Daerthe while Jarlaxle ran around with Artemis Entreri on the surface.\nBy 1376 DR, after Jarlaxle returned from the Bloodstone Lands, Kimmuriel was still his second and was frequently the public face of dealings with the mercenary band while Jarlaxle ran off adventuring on the surface with Athrogate and others. Kimmuriel was, however, given the power to overrule Jarlaxle if he felt his masters involvement in matters of the surface world threatened the organization as a whole.\nBy 1463 DR, Kimmuriel was understood to be the main leader of Bregan Daerthe. In 1468 DR, Kimmuriel was serving as a liaison between Bregan Daerthe, the illithids, and Draygo Quick in return for Quicks forgiveness for the bands assault (organized by Jarlaxle) on his home.\nBy the 1480s, Jarlaxle appeared to take more control of Bregan Daerthe, allowing Kimmuriel to spent time with Methil El-Viddenvelp and an illithid hive mind.\nIn 1484 DR, Kimmuriel began teaching psionics to Archmage Gromph Baenre in exchange for Gromph allowing Jarlaxle freedom to leave Menzoberranzan. That same year, after Dahlia Sinfelle was made the matron mother of House DoUrden, Kimmuriel slept with her, ostensibly in order to gain insight into her mind. He continued to tutor Gromph, which provided him insight into the archmages mind. He aided Gromph in contacting Hartusk, the leader of the horde of Many-Arrows, which helped lead to their defeat. When Drizzt DoUrden was believed to be the Chosen of Mielikki and able to dispel the Darkening, it was in fact Kimmuriel making a connection between Drizzt and Gromph in order for Gromph to dispel the Darkening. \nUnknown to the rest of Bregan Daerthe (although perhaps known to Jarlaxle), Kimmuriel maintained contacts with the illithid Sept of IllGhact.\nDuring the civil war in Menzoberranzan around 1490 DR, Kimmuriel accompanied Drizzt, Dabnay Trarach, and Jarlaxle into House Barrison DelArmgo to parlay with Matron MezBarris Armgo, but it had turned out to be a trap where MezBarris caught Dabnay and Kimmuriel in an impenetrable globe of magic. The only way out, according to MezBarris, was if Jarlaxle pledged himself and Bregan Daerthe to Lolth. Kimmuriel, who had been storing kinetic energy in his body would have to seek release, effectively killing Dabnay, but he refused and instead let all of that energy implode, leaving the globe covered in blood and viscera. With Kimmuriel presumed dead, MezBarris commanded her grandson Malagdorl Armgo to kill Jarlaxle and Drizzt. Instead, Malagdorl dropped Khazidhea and killed his grandmother with his trident as he was being controlled by Kimmuriels spirit.\nArtemis Entreri and Kimmuriel detested each other."
