'''Sleyvas''' was a [[lizardfolk]] [[shaman]] who lived in the [[Marsh of Chelimber]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
The lizardman was secretly recruited by [[Karne]] in the [[Zhentarim]]. 

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the lizardman shaman communed with the swamp, and its creatures told of the coming of [[adventurer]]s. Among these creatures were the [[mudviper]]s, the [[carrion beetle]]s, the [[hass-caw bird]]s, and the [[rostfish]]. Apparently, the [[Onyx Tower]] had arrived in the Marsh of Chelimber, enraging all the lizardfolk but Sleyvas.<ref group="note">Sleyvas actually deceived the three adventurers, so it is unknown how truthfully he spoke to them.

Sleyvas herded the three adventures—[[Kromlech Bruenghor]], [[Vahn]], and [[Adrianna]]—to him by placing a wall of vines along the snaking mud trail. He told the trio that he only wished for peace, and they were surprised that he was able to speak [[Common]]. He said this was because of the potent [[venom]] of the [[Sket'kah]] serpents. Sleyvas would squeeze the venom out of them and weave it into his [[magic]]. Once consumed, the words he spoke could be understood by anyone, or anything.

The adventurers asked why his people attacked him when they entered the marsh, but he told them that he was solitary, and these weren't his folk. He explained that the tower's owner, [[Eldrith]], bestowed upon them metal weapons and the means to build siege [[weapon]]s so that they could capture cities. Sleyvas implored the adventurers to seek out and kill [[Sess'sth]], the leader of the lizardfolk. But once Eldrith was slain, there was one less enemy in the way of the greater plan of Sleyvas's master.
