'''Hebopbe''' was a [[myconid]] and leader of the [[Circle of Growers]] in [[Neverlight Grove]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Hebopbe had no interest in the feud between sovereigns [[Basidia]] and [[Phylo]]. It did not like Phylo's innovations but thought that Basidia had exaggerated the danger. It also the myconid community's mass meldings.

==History==
When, ''circa'' [[1486 DR]], [[Zuggtmoy]]'s will twisted most of the Circle, Hebopbe was infected by the spores but had resisted her evil influence.
