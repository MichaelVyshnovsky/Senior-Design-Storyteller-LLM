Ingrid Liansdottir, also known as the Keeper of the Mysteries and the Wyrd, was a drow proxy of the Dark Seldarine power known as Eilistraee and a member of the Sign of One.
Ingrid had a seductive voice, as seductive as the voice of a sirine, and a shining heart nature.
A unique power possessed by Ingrid was that she could make any curse she made come true. And whenever she sang, it could bewitch even the most cold hearted of individuals.
Ingrid spent her days living in the Ysgard layer of Svartalfheim, in the realms center of shrines Yggwyrd. Among the people of that community, she was considered to be a person of import. She largely kept to herself, ignoring most requests for audiences and tending to the relatively empty city of Yggwyrd with great devotion.
