'''Smerdiuk Dragonbane''' was a famed [[dragon]]-slayer and noted author of ''[[The Compleat Dragon-Hunter]]'' who lived in [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}<ref group="note">"The Candlekeep Collection" gives a date of c. 1300 DR for the writing of ''The Compleat Dragon Hunter'', which suggests an impressively long lifespan for a dragon hunter, given his disappearance in 1355 DR. It may be that Smerdiuk only began writing at the start of his career around 1300 DR, and completion and publication came much later.
