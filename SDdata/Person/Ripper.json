        "mainbody": "Ripper was a fiendish displacer beast who served the drow blackguard, Zedarr Tsarran.\nMuch larger than most displacer beasts, Ripper was as big as a dire tiger. Due to its fiendish heritage, Ripper had rust-red fur instead of the typical black.\nHe was fiercely loyal to and well-trained by his master, Zedarr Tsarran. Ripper would often coordinate his movements to best aid his master, especially in combat.\nAlert and agile yet much bigger and stronger than others of his kind, Ripper was a fearsome specimen. Like all displacer beasts, Ripper could displace its form, thereby making it harder to ascertain its true location. Additionally, Rippers fiendish heritage made it much more resistant to ordinary weapons, cold, fire, and even magical attacks. Furthermore, it could imbue its own attacks with power that was devastating to goodly creatures.\nRipper served his master, Zedarr Tsarran, to the best of his ability.\nIn 1372 DR, during the Silence of Lolth, Ripper traveled with Zedarr Tsarran from Maerimydra to Szith Morcane. Upon arrival, the drow settlement was taken over by Dorina Tsarran and Ripper was set the task of guarding Zedarrs quarters in House Morcane.\nCategoryDisplacer beasts\nCategoryInhabitants of House Morcane\nCategoryInhabitants of Szith Morcane\nCategoryInhabitants of the Deep Wastes\nCategoryInhabitants of the Upperdark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nhpcgmzpquorvan16nufpedqm0koxnq5"
