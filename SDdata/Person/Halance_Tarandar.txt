'''Halance Dustrin Tarandar''' was a senior chamberjack in [[Castle Obarskyr]] of [[Suzail]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was large, but agile, and darkly handsome, often dressing in the livery of a chamberjack.

==Activities==
As a senior chamberjack, he was the head of a duty of eight other chamberjacks.

==Relationships==
He was a friend of Lord [[Arclath Delcastle]] and the [[War Wizard]] [[Belnar Buckmantle]].

==History==
After the [[Open Feast]] held at [[Castle Obarskyr]] on [[Mirtul 26]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Arclath Delcastle brought his friends Belnar and Halance to the [[Dragonriders Club]] of [[Suzail]] to help them relax a bit from the work needed for the upcoming [[Council of the Dragon]].

At a later date, an exhausted Halance was sent to [[Zorsin's Dock]] by [[Khaladan Mallowfaer]]. Before going, he learned that [[Belnar Buckmantle]] had been murdered. The mental influence of the evil, scheming archmage [[Manshoon]] made him suddenly suspect the stare of the masked dancer [[Amarune Whitewave]] from the club, and write a note to himself to warn Arclath of the murder and his suspicions about the dancer, which he placed in his pocket. He was murdered shortly afterwards.

==Aftermath==
The note in Halance's pocket immediately made Arclath a suspect for the War Wizards; he received a visit from [[Glathra Barcantle]] questioning him about their conversation,{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|159-162|15}} which set Arclath on a path where he met with Amarune and became close with her. He eventually accepted that it was probably a coincidence.
