'''Mainu''' was the most mysterious member of the ''[[bara]]e'', the seven "super-paladins" sworn to protect the holy city of [[Mezro]] in [[Chult]]. 

==Description==
Whatever form she used to have, by the late 1300s [[DR]], Mainu had no body but appeared as a flowing dark patch in the waters of the [[River Olung]]. She often changed her aspect, appearing in the form a voluptuous woman or a giant piranha. Whatever shape the flowing darkness took, she always had a pair of golden, glowing eyes.

==Personality==
Mainu was very elusive but a stickler for protocol and decorum. She required all visitors to treat her as royalty.

==Abilities==
Like all ''barae'', Mainu had been granted special powers from [[Ubtao]], which included the following:
* She could utter magical [[command]]s that would compel the hearer to obedience.
* She [[regenerate]]d health rapidly.
* She could [[detect evil]] at will.
* She had improved reflexes and physical and mental resistances.

If within the [[Temple of Ubtao]], she could also cast the following spells:
* ''[[Cure critical wounds]]''
* ''[[Forbiddance]]''
* ''[[Remove blindness or deafness]]''
* ''[[Remove disease]]''
* ''[[Restoration]]''
* ''[[True seeing]]''

In addition, Mainu possessed the power to control the waters and creatures of the River Olung within ten miles of Mezro.
