        "mainbody": "'''Flydian''' was a messenger who resided in the town of [[Trademeet]] of [[Amn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Flydian was a [[human]] male with pale skin and light brown hair.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the town of Trademeet faced a strange menace. A group of [[djinni]] arrived in town in search of a [[rakshasa]]. Unable to track down the [[fiend]], the elementals announced a trade embargo on the town until the High Merchant of Trademeet gave the creature up. At the same time, the town was also targeted by overpowering regular forest beast attacks that began weighing on the town's already shrunken resources. Flydian was sent to the City of Coin, [[Athkatla]] by Lord [[Logan Coprith]], Mayor and High Merchant of Trademeet. The messenger was tasked with finding a group of adventurers willing to break the djinni embargo, one way to another, and stopping the animal attacks, offering them a generous reward."
