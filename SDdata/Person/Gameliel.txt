He wore dark grey plate armor etched with pulsating, overlapping runes, from which seeped a black, oily fluid. His gloves and helm were a reddish, metallic hue.
Gameliel was capable of summoning forest trolls, and of inflicting a swiftly progressing disease at range he could personally accelerate the disease, making it useful in combat. In his fight against Marrec, he was followed by a volume of slime that formed ablative shields.
Besides his armor, Gameliel was the original wielder of Gloomgate. He was also in possession of the Keystone, which he took from Briartan.
Gameliel sought to infect woods beyond the Rawlinswood to fill them with rot, blight, and decay as best profited Talona.
In spring of the , Gameliels blightspawned volodni deceived Briartan and gained access to the Mucklestones. With their help, Gameliel captured Briartan, acquired the Keystone and took over the standing stones, When one of his uthraki spies was slain by Araluen roughly a week after, he learned through a mental link that Marrec and his companions were coming towards him. He was ready for them when they came, but Ususi Manaallin slew him with a scroll of disintegrate after a short fight.
