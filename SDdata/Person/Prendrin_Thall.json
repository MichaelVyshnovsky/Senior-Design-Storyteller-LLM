        "mainbody": "rendrin Thall was an elf rogue in the late 14 century DR who died while on an expedition in the Shining Sea.\nIn the , sometime around the month of Flamerule, a group of eccentric entertainers, entrepreneurs, and scientists embarked upon a colonizing expedition to an island they discovered in the Shining Sea off the coast of Chult, which they dubbed the \"Forgotten Island\". Led by a charismatic Waukeenar priest named Devlin, they sought to create a tourist attraction on the isle that would attract people from all across the Realms. Three months later, things began to go awry for the expedition.\nOn the First of Marpenoth, a tree fell down upon an outbuilding of the campsite, destroying a magical mirror that the groups mage Briella Farthing that been using to maintain contact with the outside world. Not long after, Prendrin expressed to Devlin his thoughts that foul play had been involved with the tree, rather than it just being a freak occurrence. By Marpenoth 9, potential investor Prince Faruq had still not arrived as expected and Prendrin expressed to Devlin that Baerwald, a druid that had been trying to convince them to abandon their plans, was likely responsible.\nOn Marpenoth 11, five velociraptors infected with olive slimes attacked the camps messhall. The group managed to slay them all, but not without the fighter Argus dying and the fighter Mallus becoming injured.\nOver the course of the next three days, Prendrin Thall and the rest of the group became infected with olive slimes due to close proximity with Mallus, who had contracted an infection from the velociraptors. On the night of the third day, Marpenoth 19, Finding bits of olive slime on all of their bodies, Devlin worked to scrape the ooze off them. He burned the scrapings in a wicker basket and then proceeded to burn the bodies of everyone inside the barracks. Before hanging himself the next day, Prendrin Thalls name and the names of the rest of the expedition crew would be recorded by Devlin in the last entry of his diary.\nTwo days later, Marpenoth 22, a group of adventurers arrived to the island in search of Briella Farthing and investigated the ruined campsite. Outside the barracks they discovered the unburnt corpse of Prendrin Thall. Examining his back they found signs of Devlins scraping, as the elfs spine he was covered with scrapes and scars, as though someone had tried to peel his skin away with a dagger or small knife. The adventurers then cast speak with dead on Prendrins body, allowing him to identify all the corpses within the barracks. He also expressed a certainty that it was their leader Devlin who had murdered him, as Mallus had warned everyone that the priest had gone insane, though would also admit that Mallus had become quite strange in appearance, not fully aware that his ally had become a slime creature."
