Hest Sciprar was a mercenary and follower of Tymora inhabiting Waterdeep, City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Hest was an amicable companion who enjoyed performing daring exploits. The radiant favor of Tymora seemed to follow Hest as he was usually quite lucky.
He would offer his services as a sellsword for 2 sp per day for normal adventuring, and 1 sp per day for a rescue mission. Hest also expected an equal share of any treasure acquired in the form of coins so he could donate a large portion to Tymoras church. He kept a room at the Inn of the Dripping Dagger in the Trades Ward and could be contacted via the inns owner, Filiare.
