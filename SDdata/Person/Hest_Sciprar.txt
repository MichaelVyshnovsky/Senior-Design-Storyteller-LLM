'''Hest Sciprar''' was a [[mercenary]] and follower of [[Tymora]] inhabiting [[Waterdeep]], City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Hest was an amicable companion who enjoyed performing daring exploits. The radiant favor of Tymora seemed to follow Hest as he was usually quite lucky.

==Activities==
He would offer his services as a sellsword for 2 [[sp]] per day for normal adventuring, and 1 sp per day for a rescue mission. Hest also expected an equal share of any treasure acquired in the form of coins so he could donate a large portion to Tymora's church. He kept a room at the [[Inn of the Dripping Dagger]] in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] and could be contacted via the [[inn]]'s owner, [[Filiare]].
