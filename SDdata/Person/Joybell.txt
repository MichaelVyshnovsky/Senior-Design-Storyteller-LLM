'''Joybell''' was a [[rock gnome]] cook living in [[Gnomengarde]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Joybell operated the [[iron]] [[stove]] in Gnomengarde's kitchen, keeping it hot by stoking it with a [[fire poker]].

==Abilities==
Like all the other [[gnome]]s in Gnomengarde, Joybell had some training as a [[wizard]] in addition to her innate abilities. In combat, she preferred to attack with [[spells]] like ''[[ray of frost]]'' and ''[[magic missile]]''.
