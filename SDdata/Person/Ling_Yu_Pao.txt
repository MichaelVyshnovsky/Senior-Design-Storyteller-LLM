'''Ling Yu Pao''' was a [[korobokuru]] [[bushi]] in [[Shou Lung]] around [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Around 1357 DR, Ling Yu was hired by a wealthy merchant from [[Linshung]]. Some time later, [[Kuang Ming Ling]], the daughter of his employer, decided to go on pilgrimage to a far-away monastery. Her father sent with her Ling Yu and another [[korobokuru]] retainer to protect the girl. 

==Personality==
Being his first well-paid job, Ling Yu was very serious in his duty to protect Kuang Ming and he always tried to convince her to go back home, often causing her anger.

==Relationship==
Kuang Ming traveled with two korobokuru retainers of her father, [[Hsiao Nan Tzu Wen]] and Ling Yu Pao.
