Ling Yu Pao was a korobokuru bushi in Shou Lung around 1357 DR.
Around 1357 DR, Ling Yu was hired by a wealthy merchant from Linshung. Some time later, Kuang Ming Ling, the daughter of his employer, decided to go on pilgrimage to a far-away monastery. Her father sent with her Ling Yu and another korobokuru retainer to protect the girl. 
Being his first well-paid job, Ling Yu was very serious in his duty to protect Kuang Ming and he always tried to convince her to go back home, often causing her anger.
Kuang Ming traveled with two korobokuru retainers of her father, Hsiao Nan Tzu Wen and Ling Yu Pao.
