        "Abilities": "Like other dark nagas, Skerndli was a powerful creature, adept at spellcasting, and able to spit potent [[poison]]. The dark naga was immune to ''poison'' and resistant to ''[[charm]]''.",
        "History": "Skerndli, alongside [[Gorgat]], were followers of [[Kog]], a dark naga chieftain who captured and subsequently corrupted by a ''spawn pool'' of the corrupted by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] ''pool of radiance''. The trio of nagas converted the open-air shrine of [[Mystra]] into a shrine to an odd totem, empowered by the ''pool''. In 1369 DR Skerndli, the fellow dark nagas were confronted by the [[Veiled Ones]] who sought to free the shrine of Mystra of the corrupt influence. After a fierce battle, all three dark nagas were slain."
