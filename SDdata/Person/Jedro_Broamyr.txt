Jedro "Longhorns" Broamyr was the proprietor of The Figureheadless tavern in Velen, a city on the Dragons Head Peninsula in Tethyr in the late 14 century DR.
Jedro was a mountain of a man with huge muscled arms, mammoth hands, and hanging mustache that draped his mouth.
"Longhorns" Broamyr ran his tavern catering to pirates and brigands after coming to an agreement with the clientele to never drug any food or drinks served at The Figureheadless. Jedros establishment was listed as a tavern of note in Volothamp Geddarms guide to the Lands of Intrigue published in the late 14 century DR.
