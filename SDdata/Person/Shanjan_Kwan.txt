Shanjan Kwan was a spellcaster who lived in the region of the Sword Coast North near Phandalin during the late 15 century DR.
Upon his forehead was a glyph depicting the symbol of the necromancy school of magic.
Due to his unique experiences as a baby, Shanjan believed that he had cheated death, even going so far to suspect he may be a god.
He did not take things for face value and always investigated further when presented with a mystery.
Shanjan tragically died when he just a mere infant. Fortunately, he was raised from the dead and continued to live on for some time.
