        "History": "While operating at the entrance of [[Bloomridge Park]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Manip Edenosa recognized a fellow [[True Soul]] and established a telepathic connection through their [[Ceremorphosis|illithid tadpoles]]. Edenosa cautioned them about the presence of [[the Absolute]]'s warriors deeper within the park and advised against interfering with their activities. Later, the Absolute itself may have had spoken through the tadpole in Edenosa, causing her speech to be strained and fragmented. If that were to pass, after a few sentences, Edenosa would briefly regain her awareness before succumbing to death. The Absolutists within the park were members of the [[Cult of Bhaal]], ready to commit a slaughter of the innocents."
