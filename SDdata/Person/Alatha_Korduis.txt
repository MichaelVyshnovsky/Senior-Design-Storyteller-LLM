Adventuress
Alatha Korduis was a bardic adventuress who became a High Herald in training in the town of Waymoot after her retirement around 1367 DR.
Sometime around 1367 DR, Alatha received a severe injury to her leg that left her crippled. For this reason, she retired and became a herald, where she received training from Dhag Greybeard, who had dual appointment as Herald for High Horn and Waymoot.
