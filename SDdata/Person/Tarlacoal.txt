'''Tarlacoal''' was a well-known but mysterious [[gold dragon]] who dwelled somewhere within the [[Thunder Peaks]] near the kingdom of [[Cormyr]].{{Cite web enhancement/Roll Call of Dragons}}

==Activities==
Having some local fame, Tarlacoal was believed to meddle in the political affairs of Cormyr to advance the cause of good, and to have done so since its founding in the {{YearlinkName|26}}. Supposedly, by [[polymorph]]ing into appealing and convincing forms for a disguise, Tarlacoal preferred to act directly and even to pass his time among the people, spending more time there than at his lair, the location of which wasn't known.

==Relationships==
It was speculated by the sage [[Nibulus Loral]] that Tarlacoal and the [[crystal dragon]] [[Yiarni]], also of the Thunder Peaks, not only knew one another but cooperated in some matter known only to them.

==History==
A famous story claimed that, during [[Gondegal]]'s uprising in Cormyr in the {{YearlinkName|1352}}, a disguised Tarlacoal was one of those advisers who quietly encouraged King [[Azoun IV]] to lead the troops in person.

Tarlacoal was confirmed to still be alive following the [[Dracorage]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}.
