Ambratha Suren was a farmer and goose-breeder from Aunkspear in Cormyr.
Gruff and crude, Ambratha did not have time for fools or insolence. Her impatience was legendary, for she often hurled raiding orcs or humans into her duck pond.
Ambratha was considered by many to be the finest breeder of gray geese in Suzail.
Ambratha possessed supernatural strength.
