        "mainbody": "Runelord '''Thaun Khelbor''' was a Loremaster of [[Deneir]] and high priest of the faith in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, during the [[abraxus affair]], Khelbor supervised the Deneirrath priests among those tending to the survivors and victims of the abraxus attack: King [[Azoun IV]], Duke [[Bhereu Ammaeth]], Baron [[Thomdor Ammaeth]], and others. Khelbor treated the king himself, but was unable to cure him. He argued against leaching blood. He was later among a group of important priests assembled by [[Vangerdahast]] to continue treating the sick and investigating the abraxus.",
        "Description": "Thaun was balding yet retained patches of dense grey hair over his ears that made him look comical but kindly.",
        "Personality": "Thaun was old and a gentle sort, but had a touch of pride.",
        "Possessions": "Thaun owned a dark [[ebony]] staff engraved with runes. Around the tip crackled small lightning bolts."
