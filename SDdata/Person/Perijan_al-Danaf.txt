Perijan al-Danaf was the driving force behind the wealthy House of Al-Danafi merchant family in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Perijan was shy and soft-spoken around others.
Despite her calm demeanor, Perijan was a financial genius. Though she would never brag about her accomplishments, she single-handedly built the wealthiest merchant house in all of Zakhara. She was a wise investor for any profits from her husbands many sea voyages.
Perijans daughter, Tanya, was a wife to Grand Caliph Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir. Perijan remained close with her daughter after her wedding, allowing the family intimate access to the Grand Caliph.
