'''Grand Duke Entar Silvershield''' was one of members of the reigning [[Council of Four]] in [[Baldur's Gate]]. He served during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Entar had a distinct accent that was different from his fellow Baldurians.

The duke lived in a [[Silvershield estate|grand estate]], located in the [[Manorborn]] district in the [[Upper City]].

==Relationships==
Entar was husband to [[Brilla Silvershield|Brilla]], and the father of [[Skie Silvershield|Skie]] and [[Eddard Silvershield|Eddard]]. Around this time he grew more worried about the well-being of his daughter Skie. She had run off with a [[bard]] named [[Eldoth Kron]]. The duke hired an agent by the name of [[Elkart]] to ensure her well-being.

==History==
When the [[iron crisis]] threatened Baldur's Gate in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Duke Silvershield and his family suffered great loss. His son Eddard was slain by [[bandit]]s somewhere along the [[Coast Way]].

At the culmination of the crisis, the members of the Council of Four were put in grave danger. Duke Silvershield was was killed by the assassins [[Slythe]] and [[Krystin]] at the behest of the rising political star, [[Sarevok Anchev]]. While Sarevok was briefly able to take his seat at the council, he was ultimately defeated and slain himself.<ref group="note">Both ''Power of Faerûn'' and ''The Grand History of the Realms'' refer to Duke [[Eltan]] as the one being killed and resurrected. Since Eltan is never killed in the ''[[Baldur's Gate (game)|Baldur's Gate]]'' video game, it is believed this was an error actually meant to refer to Entar. 

By [[Uktar]] of the same year, Duke Entar was back with the rest of the council, guiding the city through another crisis. The [[Shining Crusade]] emerged as a new threat to the Sword Coast. As the Grand Dukes dedicated 100 [[Flaming Fist]] soldiers to the [[Coalition]] army, Entar's daughter Skie attempted to secretly join their ranks. Fully aware of her actions, Duke Silvershield had his daughter looked after by the Flaming Fist corporal, [[Bence Duncan]].

Following the last battle of the [[War of the Shining Crusade]] at [[Dragonspear Castle]], a horrific event occurred that shook Entar Silvershield to his core. A [[Jon Irenicus|mysterious hooded figure]] murdered Skie in cold blood and framed the Hero of Dragonspear, [[Abdel Adrian]] for the crime. At Adrian's subsequent trial in Baldur's Gate, Duke Silvershield appeared in front of crowds enraged and utterly distraught over the loss of his other child.
