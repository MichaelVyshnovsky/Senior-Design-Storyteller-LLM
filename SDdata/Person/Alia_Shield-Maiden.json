        "mainbody": "'''Alia Shield-Maiden''' was the wife of [[Halgren Death's Head]] and a fellow member of the adventuring company – [[Annals of Halgren]] ''circa'' the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Alia Shield-Maiden was a stout, strong, and well-armored beardless [[dwarf|dwarven]] woman. Her usual weapons of choice were an [[axe]] and a heavy [[shield]]. She wore a horned [[helmet]]. Alia accepted the fact that the career she chose was a bloody one, and she changed her religion accordingly. She kept a detailed journal that chronicled the adventures of the Annals of Halgren.",
        "History": "Alia and her husband hailed from the dwarven [[Bruenghor Clan]] of the [[Sunset Mountains]]. The duo established their adventuring group ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1300}} in order to gain wealth, fame, and reputation big enough to overshadow Halgren's disgraced family past. While adventuring with the Annals of Halgren, Alia abandoned the [[dwarven pantheon]] and adopted the faith in [[Tempus]], the Lord of Battles. She used her [[cleric]]al gifts to aid her husband in battle and heal his wounds. The name \"Shield-Maiden\" referred to Alia's place in battle – to Halgren's right side, his shield arm.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, Annals of Halgren found itself in the northern city of [[Luskan]]. By that time, the troupe gained new members, [[Bastinado]], [[Silence-Before-Iron]], [[Mordakai of Thay]], and [[Kei the Wooden Idol]]."
