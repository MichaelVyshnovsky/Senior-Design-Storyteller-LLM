'''Brother Shad''' was a [[priest]] of [[Chauntea]] inhabiting [[Immilmar]] in [[Rashemen]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.

==Activities==
Brother Shad was in charge of the other priests within the [[Temple of Chauntea]] in Immilmar. Much of his time was spent monitoring Bhalla's worship in Rashemen with the hopes to avoid cults springing up which could be easily infiltrated. Though he was a foreigner to Rasheman, Brother Shad and his brethren were well respected because of their charity work.
