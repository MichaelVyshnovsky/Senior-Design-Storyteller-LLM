'''J'Nah''' was a [[half-fiend]] [[elf]] of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
J'Nah worked for [[Heurodis]] in trying to acquire the [[Tower Statue]], which contained within it a [[mythallar]].

In [[1372 DR]], she made a deal with the [[white dragon]] [[Tymofarrar]] to acquire the four relics in the keeping of [[Drogan Droganson]]. But she betrayed the dragon, sending a group of [[gnoll]]s under her control to attack Tymofarrar's [[kobold]]s (who were sent in ahead of time because Tymofarrar wished to see the artifacts for himself first) who were returning from [[Hilltop]] with the artifacts. Due to this betrayal, Tymofarrar wanted her dead and would offer an adventurer an item which would aid in killing her.
