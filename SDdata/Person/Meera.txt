'''Meera''' was an unusual cleric of [[Cyric]] and a member of the [[Shadow Thieves]] in [[Velen]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
Meera worshiped Cyric in his nonviolent aspects. She disliked violence but was okay with setting someone up for an ambush by her fellow Shadow Thieves. She would probably never become an assassin.

==Activities==
Meera used her clerical powers and beauty to spy for the local chapter of the spies guild division of Shadow Thieves in Velen.
