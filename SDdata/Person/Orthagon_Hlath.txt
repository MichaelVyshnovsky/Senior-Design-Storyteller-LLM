Lord '''Orthagon Hlath''' was the patriarch of the noble [[patriar]] [[Hlath (family)|Hlath]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lord Orthagon was already an old man who was the leader of the family only symbolically. His matron daughter [[Merrigold Hlath]] was making all financial and social family discussions in Orthagon's place. When the [[Absolute crisis]] stroke Baldur's Gate, Orthagon Hlath was noted by the [[Cult of Bane]] as a vulnerable patriar through his beloved grand-neice [[Holiday Hlath]], the heiress of the fortune and a woman of insatiable gabling habits and an impressive collection of gambling debts.
