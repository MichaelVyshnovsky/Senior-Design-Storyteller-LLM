        "mainbody": "Xelez-Dar was a leader of the drow who commanded minotaurs of the Storm Horn Mountains of Cormyr in the 14 century DR.\nIn the early 1360s DR, Arelin Starbrow was killed along the High Road, ambushed by a monster horde. Her body was retrieved by valorous Sir Dutiocs. However, the Arms of the Roadwarden, the enchanted set of weapons and armor that symbolized the office, were lost to the monster attackers. Xelez-Dars minotaurs took place in the attack and got away from the Sword of the Roadwarden. The minotaurs delivered the sword to their mistress deep within the tunnels underneath the Labyrinthine Cavern north of Skull Crag. When a group of caravan guards, who stood alongside Sir Dutiocs against a monster attack, was sent to retriever the Sword of the Roadwarden, they hacked and slashed through the Labyrinthine Cavern, eventually confronting Xelez-Dar. In the first encounter, Xelez-Dar vanished in a cloud of darkness and left the adventurers to defend themselves against a band of drow warriors. The second encounter was on Xelez-Dars territory. She ambushed the adventures, dropping at them from the ceiling along with her drow troops. Despite the ambush, Xelez-Dar was believed not to had survived that battle."
