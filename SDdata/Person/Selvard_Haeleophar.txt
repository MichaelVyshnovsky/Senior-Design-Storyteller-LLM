'''Selvard Haeleophar''' was the Master Shipbuilder of [[Telflamm]] in [[Thesk]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Selvard was a good-looking womanizing man of a capricious personality but a brilliant mind.

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Selvard Haeleophar was known for his ships and legendary feuds and tirades. He built naval vessels encased in armor plating, fitted with rams, and elevated [[ballista]]e decks. His coastal rakers were equipped with both oars and sails. Each vessel could be assembled in as little as twelve days, but twenty-one days was the average. Selvard's shipbuilders occupied six drydocks in Telflamm. Selvard Haeleophar's major business rival was [[Vellard Sisters Shipwright]] of [[Tsurlagol]].
