White Eyebrow was a gnomish curio dealer living in Zazesspur in the midâ€“14 century DR and a friend of Zaranda Star.
By the 1360s DR, White Eyebrow was an old, white-haired gnome. In his younger days, he had had black hair, but an encounter with magic left him with a single white, bushy eyebrow&mdashhence, his nickname. He had round, red cheeks, and distinct laugh lines.
White Eyebrow dressed in an emerald-green gown of silk, which had a tall black collar embroidered with dragons in gold-colored thread. He smoked a long and thin pipe made of clay.
White Eyebrow was not trusting of magic and never sold any in his shop. He often argued with his friend Zaranda about magics usefulness.
His laugh was merry, and he laughed often. He was polite, even to rude customers in his store.
The old gnome was very skilled at blowing rings of smoke, up to three at a time of decreasing size, which traveled at different speeds.
White Eyebrow was the proprietor of the Curiosity Shop in Zazesspur, which sold collectible and valuable items, several of which had been purchased from spelljammers.
White Eyebrow maintained many contacts among the spelljamming community of Toril.
He had at least one daughter, a priestess of Gond named Simonne,
When Zaranda Star found herself in Zazesspur with her trade goods confiscated, in the spring of the , she encountered strange followers of Ao, who called themselves the All Friends. She then visited her old friend White Eyebrow to ask him what he knew about them. The gnome explained that they were followers of a man named Armenides, advisor to Baron Faneuil Hardisty. During her visit, two youths, Fredaro and Gonsalvo entered the shop to harass White Eyebrow and his daughter for being foreigners, but Zaranda used her weapons and her magic to protect the two gnomes and threatened the two boys on pain of death to never abuse the gnomes again.
