        "mainbody": "The '''Librarian''' was a consciousness that inhabited an enormous statue in the [[gem]]-encrusted [[Hall of Living Memory]] in [[Myth Nantar]].{{Cite adventurers league/Blood in the Water|4-5}}\n\n{{Quote|All severs were once ties. The same thread links all who live. Magic ebbs and flows and changes hands.|The Librarian, to the [[half-elf|half-]][[sea elf]] [[Thessalia Lamaer]].}}",
        "Description": "The Librarian manifested as a statue of three [[elves]] performing daily tasks: reading, praying, and writing upon a [[scroll]]. It was situated in a domed chamber, the walls of which were lined with ''[[kiira]]''. As the Librarian spoke to visitors, the eyes of the three elves in the statue shone and triggered similar flickering in the surrounding ''kiira''.\n\nIt was in fact the transmuted remains of three ancient elven [[sage]]s that lived during the time of ancient [[Aryselmalyr]].",
        "Personality": "The Librarian was rather cryptic in its interactions with others. It could only be spoken to when in the presence of people of [[elven]] lineage.{{Cite adventurers league/Blood in the Water|12-14}}",
        "Abilities": "If any entity touched the Librarian's surface, it would take from them their memories, likely causing some form of ''[[feeblemind]]edness''. When this occurred, one of the Librarian's three faces would grow a new ''kiira'' upon its forehead and release it into the surrounding chamber.",
        "Activities": "The Library served as a repository of ancient elven knowledge.{{Cite adventurers league/Blood in the Water|26}} this was often a rather perplexing affair.",
        "History": "Some time during or around the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Red Wizards]] from the land of [[Thay]] sought out the Librarian in its home city. They were followed by [[Zehira Deryan]] and her fellow [[adventurer]]s.\n\nZehira and her companions were able to hold audience with the Librarian, and their ally [[Thessalia Lamaer|Thessalia]]."
