While the exact circumstances of the events were unclear, it was known that Nadir used the ''[[Ambergul Blade]]'' to unstop the cork from the flask, and let loose Karrnsyrrl upon the Realms.\n\nThe ancient dragon erupted from [[Daggerford Castle]] in a raging inferno and ravaged the town. He snatched in his claws the nobleman [[Christos Tellos]], who had previously uncovered the ''iron flask'', and flew him away from the city. and as far to the southwest as [[Corwell]], on the isle of [[Gwynneth]] in the [[Moonshaes]]. While in there, Karrnsyrrl was turned away by a [[ki-rin]] named [[Daiwon]].\n\nA group of adventurers tracked Karrnsyrrl along his path of destruction, and eventually made their way to the [[Sword Mountains]] on the [[Sword Coast North]]. After delving into the crypt of [[Uruth Ukrypt (individual)|Uruth Ukrypt]], the adventures became imminently aware that both Karrnsyrrl and Nadir were about to attack them."
