        "mainbody": "Yarmuth the Brown was a ghoul, formerly a cleric of Myrkul who dwelled in the Accursed Tower of Icewind Dale, and was responsible for the curse that turned its denizens undead.\nIn his undead state, Yarmuth was  tall.\nIn his guest room on the third floor of the Accursed Tower, he had a chest protected with a fire glyph of warding. Inside Yarmuth kept his magical +1 mace, magical scrolls of cure light wounds, continual light, speak with dead, and two rubies.\nYarmuth the Brown arrived in Damien Morienus Accursed Tower not long before its disappearance into the mud during the Great Thaw circa 1269 DR. He was invited to be consulted on the subject of death as a loyal priest of the god of death. Subsequently, Yarmut attempted to take over the Tower, wrestling the control from the necromancer. The attempt failed, and the cleric was thrown into a pit inside in the tower to die in, by the Captain of the towers guard Derek. Shortly after that, the Great Thaw killed all inhabitants of the tower and Yarmuth placed a curse on the tower with his dying breath. The curse stopped anyone from finding rest in death inside the tower forcing them to go on forever as the undead.\nA hundred years later, a group of adventurers tasked with finding the tower encountered Yarmuth the ghoul in the pit where he was left to die. The former cleric was driven insane by hunger and the only thing he cared about was feeding."
