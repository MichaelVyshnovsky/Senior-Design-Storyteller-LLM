        "mainbody": "Surgol Velard was a War Wizard from Suzail in Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.\nHe was younger than Amarune Whitewave. His voice was a nasal.\nThe man was ambitious, and probably lecherous as well.\nHe had a wand of sleep, a slender purse, and a blunt knife, likely used for spreading pastes.\nIn the wake of the calamitous Council of the Dragon at Castle Obarskyr in the , Surgol noticed Amarune Whitewave skulking around the palace. He immediately used a wand to put her to sleep, and had her brought to the Mages Dutychamber, insisting she not be searched for weapons.\nAt the Dutychamber, he personally searched her for weapons. While he tried to pry off her clothes, one of the Lords of Waterdeep, Mirt and the Marchioness Immerdusk, Storm Silverhand, ambushed him and knocked him out, then took his wand.\nSurgol was disliked by his fellows Joreld Nurennanthur and Welwyn Tracegar."
