        "mainbody": "Gotha was a dracolich who was formerly an ancient red dragon and was transformed by Talos before the 14 century DR.\nTalos, the god of destruction, had approached Gotha to make a proposal. Talos vowed to keep Gotha from death indefinitely, provided Gotha would perform an unnamed task of destruction at some point in the future, at Talos request. Gotha feared the effects of age and his eventual death more than anything else and subsequently agreed. Talos instructed him to fly to the north of Faer√ªn to an ice cave in the Icerim Mountains, where an avalanche trapped him for a total of 237 years, keeping him alive and in constant pain and transforming him into a dracolich.\nDuring the , Gotha attacked the Moonshae Isles on behalf of his master. There he was defeated by Princess Alicia Kendrick, who was briefly granted the powers of an avatar by the Earthmother.\nCategoryDracoliches\nCategoryWorshipers of Talos\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sea of Swords\nCategoryInhabitants of the Moonshae Isles\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryRed dragons\nCategoryAncient dragons\n9f7kbwiuzviad2axu2l8k3a90chni4o"
