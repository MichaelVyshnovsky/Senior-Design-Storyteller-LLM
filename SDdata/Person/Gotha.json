        "History": "Talos, the god of destruction, had approached Gotha to make a proposal.{{Timescale}} Talos vowed to keep Gotha from death indefinitely, provided Gotha would perform an unnamed task of destruction at some point in the future, at Talos' request. Gotha feared the effects of age and his eventual death more than anything else and subsequently agreed. Talos instructed him to fly to the north of [[Faer√ªn]] to an ice cave in the [[Icerim Mountains]], where an avalanche trapped him for a total of 237 years, keeping him alive and in constant pain and transforming him into a dracolich.\n\nDuring the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, Gotha attacked the [[Moonshae Isles]] on behalf of his master. There he was defeated by Princess [[Alicia Kendrick]], who was briefly granted the powers of an [[avatar]] by the [[Earthmother]].",
