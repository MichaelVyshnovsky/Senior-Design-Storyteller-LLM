'''Histra''' was a [[human]] woman and a priestess of [[Sune]] studying at the [[Edificant Library]] in the [[Snowflake Mountains]] around [[1362 DR]].

==History==
In the [[1362 DR|Year of the Helm, 1362 DR]], [[Cadderly]], a young priest of [[Deneir]], paid Histra 200 [[gold piece]]s to enchant a disk with a permanent ''[[light]]'' [[spell]]. Histra did so, and attempted to seduce Cadderly for a reduced fee, though he declined.

Upon being affected by the [[Chaos Curse]] that afflicted the Library and drove everyone to obsession and excess, Histra spent the time in the throes of passion. She took at least a dozen men to her chambers, leaving them exhausted, and attempted to lure Cadderly and the dwarves [[Ivan Bouldershoulder|Ivan]] and [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]] to join her, to the point of trying magic.

==Description==
Around 1362 DR, she was described as a woman twice [[Cadderly]]'s age, which would put her around 40 years old though she remained alluring. She wore a deep crimson habit that was very revealing.
