        "mainbody": "oltan Szarlnaxi was a traitorous Tethyrian noble that lived during the 15 century DR.\nVoltan was once an influential count in Tethyr until he was found guilty of conspiracy. He was stripped of his lands, his family taken into custody and forced to flee by ship to Baldurs Gate. Within the city, Voltan attracted a small gang of criminals, and together they devoted themselves to the deity Shar.\nFor a time, Voltan enjoyed his life with the thieves. This continued until adventurers hired by the Tethyrian crown found and killed Voltan, leaving his body where it dropped. Eight of Voltans most devoted allies prayed to Shar over the still-bleeding corpse of their leader. Using Voltans blood, the goddess transformed them into vampires. They formed a coven in the name of Voltan Szarlnaxi and preyed upon the poorest Baldurian citizens for some time.\nAfter being routed from the city, the Szarlnaxi coven traveled across the Western Heartlands. They sought some means to free the soul of the man that united them in worship of Shar, the deity that bestowed upon them their undead prowess."
