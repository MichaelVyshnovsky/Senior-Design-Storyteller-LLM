Tamper was an early knight of Neverwinter and the eight of the Nine knights who served Lord Halueth Never. They were the basis for the Neverwinter Nine.
Tamper was the youngest of the Nine, and kept the others feeling young at heart. A statue of Tamper and his sword later stood guard in Halueths tomb.
