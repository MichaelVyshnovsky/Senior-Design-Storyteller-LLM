Mushakoji Nariakira was a samurai retainer of the Niwa clan and the jito of Miki in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
In Miki, a large fishing village that had recently grown significantly, he led a company of ten samurai and thirty bushi. Thanks to the growth of the village and the necessity of also managing the adjacent central Niwa shoen, he had to recruit fifteen more bushi but was sure to need more.
