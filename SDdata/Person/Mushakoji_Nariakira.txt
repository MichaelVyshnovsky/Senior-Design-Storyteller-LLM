'''Mushakoji Nariakira''' was a [[samurai]] retainer of the [[Niwa clan]] and the [[jito]] of [[Miki]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
In Miki, a large fishing village that had recently grown significantly, he led a company of ten samurai and thirty [[bushi]]. Thanks to the growth of the village and the necessity of also managing the adjacent central Niwa [[shoen]], he had to recruit fifteen more bushi but was sure to need more.
