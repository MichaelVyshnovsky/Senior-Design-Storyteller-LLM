Kholzourl the Fire-Speaker was the leader of a group of duergar followers of Asmodeus who mined hellthorn in the depths of Gauntlgrym circa 1480 DR.
He was an unholy warrior of Asmodeus who interpreted the signs and omens sent by the god of Nine Hells. Only Kholzourl knew the reason why his god ordered his mission.
