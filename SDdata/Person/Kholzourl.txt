'''Kholzourl the Fire-Speaker''' was the leader of a group of [[duergar]] followers of [[Asmodeus]] who mined [[hellthorn]] in the depths of [[Gauntlgrym]] ''circa'' [[1480 DR]].

He was an unholy warrior of Asmodeus who interpreted the signs and omens sent by the god of [[Nine Hells]]. Only Kholzourl knew the reason why his god ordered his mission.
