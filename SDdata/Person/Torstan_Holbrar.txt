Torstan Holbrar was a wheelwright from the hamlet of Sarbreenar in the Vast, in business around 1370 DR.
Torstan worked at the Sarbreenar wagonworks, and made top-quality wheels, among the best around the Inner Sea. Torstan also kept a large stock of spares available to wagon-drivers whod suffered breakdowns on the rough High Trail, though at exorbitant prices.
