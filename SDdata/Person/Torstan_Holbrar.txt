'''Torstan Holbrar''' was a wheelwright from the hamlet of [[Sarbreenar]] in [[the Vast]], in business around [[1370 DR]].

Torstan worked at the Sarbreenar wagonworks, and made top-quality wheels, among the best around the [[Inner Sea]]. Torstan also kept a large stock of spares available to wagon-drivers who'd suffered breakdowns on the rough [[High Trail]], though at exorbitant prices.
