'''Ashardalon''' was a powerful [[red dragon]] who was mentioned in songs throughout the [[multiverse]]. He was known for his depredations and unorthodox methods to extend his own life. He later became a [[greatwyrm]].

==Description==
An extremely old red dragon, Ashardalon had an appearance that diverged somewhat from usual [[Dragon aging|ancient]] dragons of his kind. He possessed unusual [[demon]]ic features and a scar on his chest in the shape of an enormous winged [[humanoid]].

==Personality==
Ashardalon was regarded as a self-important dragon with an almost desperate attachment to his own life. He was willing to go through whatever means necessary to prevent his own death.

==History==
[[File:Ashardalon board game.jpg|thumb|''Ashardalon taking flight.'']]
After suffering a mortal wound, Ashardalon attempted to extend his life by binding a [[balor]] called [[Ammet]] to his chest in order to function as a second heart. However, his injuries were too extensive for the balor's power to keep Ashardalon alive. He then moved to a domain in the [[Astral Plane]] known as the [[Bastion of Unborn Souls]] and established his lair there. He was kept alive thanks to the timeless nature of the Astral Plane and the unusual flow of energy that permeated the Bastion.

==Rumors & Legends==
Although Ashardalon had no known presence on [[Toril]], tales of his fortress on another world reached as far as the [[Yawning Portal]] tavern in [[Waterdeep]].{{Cite dragon+/13/Fiction: Sunless Citadel}}
