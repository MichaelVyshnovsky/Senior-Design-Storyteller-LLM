Aswiyah al-Muftahir was the caliph of Muluk in 1367 DR.
Aswiyah was a crafty and cunning individual, just like her ancestors. She preferred to be addressed as "Caliph", as opposed to the traditional feminine title of "Calipha."
The Caliph exercised her political skills during her reign by successfully negotiating alliances with each of the Free Cities of Zakhara.
Aswiyah was the eldest daughter of the previous caliph, Ibrahim al-Muftahir. She was the mother of princess Hadra bint Aswiyah.
