        "History": "She was said to be of divine heritage; indeed, her beauty was often compared to that of a goddess. Ellesime inhabited the palace of Suldanessellar, which was built around the [[Tree of Life]]â€”the queen's eternal youth was said to be preserved by the tree, and as such it was difficult to judge her age. She was once in a relationship with the mage [[Irenicus]], who was subsequently exiled from Suldanessellar for attempting to raise himself to the status of godhood.<ref>\n\nIn [[1368 DR]], Ellesime was forced to flee Suldanessellar, after it was attacked by [[Joneleth Irenicus|Joneleth, \"The Exile\"]]. She and the other survivors fled to [[Myth Rhynn]].<ref>"
