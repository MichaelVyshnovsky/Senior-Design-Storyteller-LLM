Pyrra Flamedancer was a human wizard and co-leader of the Ruby Blades adventuring company in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Pyrra had a plain and unassuming appearance.
She was shy and self-conscious, and extremely obsessed with fire and fire-related spells.
The vast majority of her spells were flashy and destructive fire-based evocations.
Pyrra wore bracers of defense and a ring of fire resistance. Offensively, she carried a wand of fire and a necklace of missiles.
She was best friends with Ranni Stalkersdaughter, and together they led the Ruby Blades.
In the , the Ruby Blades joined the Wolfmasters company on an excursion to explore and loot Orvaskyte Keep in the Vast Swamp. The Ruby Blades were heavily delayed, and by the time they arrived their allies were already dead. Seeking a new goal, they attempted to hunt a nearby black dragon, only to be overwhelmed and almost killed by it, and were rescued by a band of Cormyrean adventurers. Their fortune waxed once more, and they were joined by two-dozen mercenaries that allowed them to chase away the Cormyreans and secure what was left of Orvaskyte Keep.
