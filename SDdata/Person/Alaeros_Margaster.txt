==Personality==
Alaeros was a very kind and considerate man with many talents. He had a moral belief that meant he would never cut down a live tree.

==Abilities==
He was quite skilled at imitating regional accents along with the voices of others he heard.

==History==
===Early Life===
Alaeros Margaster was born a noble of [[Waterdeep]]. At the age of nine, he was kidnapped by pirates from [[Luskan]]. After they sold him to slavers, he was rescued by agents of the Lords' Alliance. He was brought to the Margaster estate in [[Neverwinter]]. Even though he was free, his life did not exactly improve. Alaeros had to live with his cruel uncle, [[Orn Margaster]], who convinced him that his parents never wanted to have him.

The Margaster family, as a whole, was in fact in great trouble. The noble house had financially indebted itself to the [[Zhentarim]], making it more problem then honor to be a family member. The head of the Waterdhavian branch of the family was greatly ill during Alaeros' youth, and his family fell to infighting to claim what little could be salvaged of their birthright.

In the midst of this turmoil, Alaeros was left to fend for himself. At the age of 15, he began service in the local militia. This is where he first learned to fight with a sword. His great physical stature and quick thinking led him to become a formidable warrior. But his commanders disliked him for his noble heritage, and made life difficult for him. The warrior did not let this faze him, which only infuriated his tormentors. The commanders planted false evidence of stealing to discredit him, ultimately getting him kicked out of military service.

His dishonorable discharge embarrassed his family in Neverwinter, who told him to go live with the Waterdhavian branch of the family. In defiance of his family's wishes, he instead took up mercenary work along the [[Sword Coast]]. He chose to style himself as a rural [[Northman]] without any hint of his aristocratic heritage.

During one of his exploits, he and a companion had to escape a band of [[goblin]]s. The companion fell in battle, and Alaeros's sword broke after he fell from a great height. While hiding from the goblins, he discovered an [[axe]] hacked into an old tree. Removing the weapon caused the "tree" to wake up, revealing itself to be a [[treant]]. The treant helped Alaeros defeat the goblins and escape the forest. Not long afterward, he saved three travelers from a monster using his new found axe, which he named "Chopper". One of these travelers knew Alaeros from the warrior's childhood. In fact, the traveler was the Lords' Alliance agent who had rescued him from slavery. Alaeros's prowess was noted by the agent, who invited the fighter to become an agent of the Alliance, namely for the city of Neverwinter.

===Tyranny of Dragons===
Some time during the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Alaeros was charged by Lord [[Dagult Neverember]] with leading an expedition to halt the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in their search for the lost ''[[dragon mask]]s''. He was accompanied by the [[dwarf]] [[cleric]], [[Barrowin Undurr]] of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]], and the [[elf]] [[wizard]], [[Nymmestra]] the [[Harper]].{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 1}} They defeated a group of Cultists led by the [[Thayan]] wizard [[Rath Modar]], which were trying to guard an excavation site in [[Icewind Dale]]. In this battle, Alaeros company received the assistance of [[Ratshadow]] the [[halfling]] [[rogue]], an agent of the Zhentarim, and his native guide [[Talon Everhale]], a human [[ranger]] of the [[Emerald Enclave]]. They all entered a mysterious stone portal at the center of the excavation site.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 2}}

The portal led them to the island of [[Tuern]], which led to many battles between the heroes, cultists, and native barbarians. After one of these battles, Alaeros's group interrogated a captured cultist and discovered that the Cult was searching for the ''[[Red Dragon Mask]]''.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 3}} Alaeros's company tried to beat the Cult to the mask, but were unsuccessful. They did however manage to slay the isle's red dragon tyrant [[Lostmauth]].{{ToD-Lost}} Afterwards the dragon's two siblings turned on each other, destroying Tuern.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 4}}

Somehow, he and his friends escaped Tuern and headed to Neverwinter to break a siege by a horde of [[red dragon]]s. However, Ratshadow found the ''[[White Dragon Mask]]'', and split from the group.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 6}} Ratshadow took it back to the Zhent headquarters in Waterdeep. The Zhents lost the mask to Lord [[Arthagast Ulbrinter]], a [[Masked Lord]] of Waterdeep. However, his villa was raided by the Cult, and his fate was unknown. Alaeros, Talon, Nymesstra, and Barrowin arrived at the villa to find the massacre of the household.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 7}} Fortunately they did track down the Cult's [[wyrmspeaker]] [[Varramzord]], and managed to learn about their ultiamte plot to summon [[Tiamat]] from the [[Nine Hells]].{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 8}}

When Lord Ulbrinter's widow [[Remallia Haventree]] summoned the combined forces of the [[Sword Coast]] to march on the Cult's main lair at the [[Well of Dragons]], a great battle took place.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 9}} Alaeros and his fellow heroes were among those that managed to subdue the cult's leader, [[Severin Silrajin]] and brought renown each to their respective factions.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 10}}
