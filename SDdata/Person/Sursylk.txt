'''Sursylk''' ({{pronounce|SUR|silk}}) was the name given to an enormous [[dragon turtle]] reported to live in the [[Great Sea]] off the southern coast of [[Ulgarth]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-04-21 - Largest Dragon Turtles in the Realms}}

The name was inspired by a legend known in the [[Hordelands]] by [[1359 DR]] of an island that rose and fell beneath the waves and was possibly a dragon turtle or another aquatic creature of comparable size.
