Before she could react, Tamah was ''[[petrified]]'' by a [[basilisk]], presumably one that was controlled by the madman [[Mutamin]].\n\nShe remained a statue in [[Mutamin's Garden]] until at least the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. By that time her house was all but ruined, as it had sunk down into the lake."
