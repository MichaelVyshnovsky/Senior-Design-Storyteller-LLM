'''Parley''' was a young adventuring [[druid]] from [[Vaasa]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''With all that is out of balance in this age, let my hospitality welcome and comfort you. Times of stress and war do not exempt one from good manners; hold tight to this lesson and you shall find peace in the midst of conflict.''|Parley the Druid}}

==Description==
Parley was a quiet, polite, delicate, and pretty young elven lass. Despite being in [[Waterdeep]], away from her forest home, Parley showed no discomfort common among other members of their profession.

==History==
{{quote|''I realized I needed to emerge from my retreat and sample the world and all it had to offer, so I came here. And you know what I have found? As much as I love nature, I love the bustle of the city as well. Everyone leads a life that is as important to him or her as storing nuts is to a [[squirrel]].''|Parley the Druid}}<br/>
In [[Kythorn]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the City of Splendors became once again endangered by the [[drow]] menace from the [[Undermountain]]. The [[Masked Lord]]s determined that the danger was coming from [[Undermountain]], and [[Durnan]], the proprietor of the [[Yawning Portal]], put out a call for adventurers willing to traverse the mega-dungeon and route the evil within.

Parley was among the heroes who answered the call. She left her solitary forest life in Vaasa after meeting an adventuring [[fighter]] named [[Faragati]]. The [[half-elven]] adventurer came across meditating Parley by a secluded forest brook. She invited him to join. Afterward, Faragati shared his adverting story and told her about the wonders of the world. He persuaded Parley to travel to "civilized" lands. Parley decided to follow her dreams of grand adventures and hoped to have tales of her deeds retold by many. She was present at the Yawning Portal, sipping [[wine]] and mingling with fellow adventurers when the inn became flooded by drow assassins sent by "queen" [[Valsharess]]. The dark elves slaughtered many of the gathered adventurers, including Parley. Survivors chased the assassins down into the Undermountain, while those killed were resurrected by the city's clergy. Being brought back from the dead left Parley shaken and willing to give up her adventuring life.
