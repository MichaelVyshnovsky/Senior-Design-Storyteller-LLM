        "mainbody": "losh was a lizardfolk who belonged to Hissains tribe in the Mere of Dead Men on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR.\nSlosh scouted the swamp for dangers and hunted prey for his nomadic tribe.\nSlosh was loyal to the tribes leader, Hissain.\nCirca 1491 DR, a band of rot trolls raided the territory of Sloshs tribe, which was then living fairly peacefully near the High Road. The lizardfolk were forced to flee closer to the High Road as a result of the attack, bringing them in confrontation with travelers who mistook their presence for an attack. The lizardfolk fought back, capturing Vester Jessup and three other soldiers from Leilon as well as four members of a trade caravan.\nThe lizardfolk planned to use the captives as bait to lure the rot trolls away from their wandering village. The lizardfolk would go in the other direction, hoping that the trolls would ignore them in favor of the offering. However, a group of adventurers tracked the lizardfolk tribe to rescue Vester and the other captured Leilon soldiers. They confronted the lizardfolk before they could put their plan into action. An attack by the rot trolls interrupted the confrontation, but together the lizardfolk and the adventurers defeated the trolls. Vester and the other captives were then rescued."
