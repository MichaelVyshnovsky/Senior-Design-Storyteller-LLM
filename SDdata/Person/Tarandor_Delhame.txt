'''Tarandor Delhame''' was a powerful [[mage]] living in [[Iriaebor]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|3116|9}} 

==History==
He was the former apprentice of the apprentice of the [[archmage]] [[Meritheus]], who trapped [[Jack Ravenwild]] in the [[mythal]] beneath [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[1372 DR]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[High House of Magic]] learned that Jack had escaped his confinement in the mythal and notified Tarandor who was obligated to his master to recapture Jack.  Tarandor tricked Jack into meeting him at a warehouse, where he shrunk Jack and placed him into a bottle for easy transport to the mythal. Jack, however, was able to use a spell from the [[Sarkonagael]] to escape his confinement.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|3212|9}} Later, Jack tricked Tarandor into purchasing a [[Sarkon's umbral simulacrum|shadow simulacrum]] of Jack for 2,000 [[currency|gold pieces]].{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|3846|11}} Thinking he had the real Jack, Tarandor imprisoned the simulacrum in the mythal stone, though it also escaped when the mythal was destroyed.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle||13}}
