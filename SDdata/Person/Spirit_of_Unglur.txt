The so-called '''Spirit of Unglur''' was a strange [[undead]] creature that once was a pirate who sailed the waters of the [[Sea of Swords]], long before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The Spirit of Unglur was a corporeal undead being, and not a [[ghost]] as the name suggested. The creature was a unique type of [[boneclaw]] – a fierce monster with long sharp claws.

==History==
Long before the 14{{th}} century DR, the Spirit of Unglur was an infamous bloodthirsty [[berserker]] buccaneer.
