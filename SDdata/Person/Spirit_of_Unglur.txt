pirate
The so-called Spirit of Unglur was a strange undead creature that once was a pirate who sailed the waters of the Sea of Swords, long before the 14 century DR.
The Spirit of Unglur was a corporeal undead being, and not a ghost as the name suggested. The creature was a unique type of boneclaw â€“ a fierce monster with long sharp claws.
Long before the 14 century DR, the Spirit of Unglur was an infamous bloodthirsty berserker buccaneer.
