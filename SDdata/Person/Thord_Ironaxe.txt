Thord Ironaxe was a dwarf of Clan Ironeater residing in Illefarn around 1480 DR.
Thord was one of the few dwarves to fall in love with an orc, Tulug, who became his wife. They had a son, Grit, a half-orc.
Around 1480 DR, the Red Wizard of Thay Arvik Zaltos instructed Thord Ironaxe, his son Grit, and the ogrillon Lump to go to Daggerford to help his apprentice Darwa Dalion to recover the earth key from inside the Ambergul Crypt.
However, when Darwa, Thord, and the others found the altar to Ogremoch she tried to unlock the earth key by force and a magical trap turned her into stone.
So Thord went back together with Grit and Lump, but Thord was captured by some minotaurs who wanted cook and eat him.
