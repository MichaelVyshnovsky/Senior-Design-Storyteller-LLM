Avid was a merchant in Unther in 1357 DR.
Avid hailed from Durpar. His familys largest caravan was confiscated by the clergy of Gilgeam, causing the bankruptcy of Avids family and the suicide of his father.
In 1357 DR, Avid went to Unther in order to support the rebellion among the mercantile community, wanting Gilgeam removed from power.
