'''Avid''' was a merchant in [[Unther]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Avid hailed from [[Durpar]]. His family's largest caravan was confiscated by the clergy of [[Gilgeam]], causing the bankruptcy of Avid's family and the suicide of his father.

In 1357 DR, Avid went to Unther in order to support the rebellion among the mercantile community, wanting Gilgeam removed from power.
