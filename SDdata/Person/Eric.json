        "mainbody": "Eric, or the Cavalier, was a fighter and an adventurer from Earth and the Realm (no relation). He was a companion of the barbarian Bobby, the monk Diana, the ranger Hank, the wizard Presto, and the rogue Sheila.\nEric came across as very pompous and sarcastic, as well as pessimistic, and so he often irritated people. However, he was good at heart and actually cared a lot for his friends, and would occasionally show his true colors when trying to protect them. He feared being mocked or laughed at by others, so used his cutting words as a way to shield himself. While he was charismatic, he lacked bravery.\nOver his mail, he wore a yellow tabard and red cloak.\nEric both fought, and defended himself and his companions, with his powerful shield, with which he could bash or disarm a foe. It could also produce force fields.\nHis primary possession was a large griffon shield.\nEric and his friends were originally from Earth, and later some place they called \"the Forgotten Realms\", evidently not knowing the difference. Aiding by a mysterious entity known as the Dungeon Master, they battled monsters sent at them by the villainous Venger and tried to defeat him for good while struggling to find a way home.\nLiving long before the mid-to-late 14 century DR, he was among a band of young adventurers who were all trying to find a way back to their distant home. However, it was said they were all slain horribly by Tiamat, together with their miniature unicorn. By 1369 DR, the Adventurer Mart in Athkatla, Amn, displayed paintings of his two friends, Hank and Bobby.\nIn the 1360s DR, Eric and his friends visited the town of Shadowdale in Faer√ªn so that Presto could ask the great sage Elminster to take him on as an apprentice. While drinking in the Old Skull Inn, they spotted Elminster, but Eric dismissed him as old and insisted that wizards often told lies to make themselves appear more important. When Presto lost his nerve, Eric taunted him by making chicken noises, yet stood beside him to declare his suitability to Elminster.\nThus, Elminster whisked Presto away on a whirlwind tour of the Realms, and he came back traumatized and beaten and decided it best not to be his apprentice. Nevertheless, Presto had ideas for future adventures with his friends.\nAt this time, Eric was a middle-aged adult and wore a blue cloak over his dark-brown clothing.\nIn the late 1490s DR, Eric and his friends, all adults now and without unicorn, were one of six teams competing in the High Sun Games in the newly built arena in Neverwinter. They evaded the displacer beast and even got to the center of the maze and safely inside the sanctuary cage at the end, winning that round. However, the Red Wizard of Thay Sofina used the horn of beckoning death above the arena soon after, so their fate is unknown.After reaching the cage, the cartoon characters are not seen again. The beckoning death smoke later engulfs their position in the arena, but it is likely they left before this. Their purpose for competing is also unknown, but they may also have been trying to stop Forge and Sofina.\nAged only 15, Eric and friends were camping in a forest one night when the Dungeon Master arrived to check on them, soon abandoning them again with promises of finding snacks, such as the spicy fried potatoes they liked. Hank grew annoyed at this and their lack of progress on getting back to Earth he had a new plan, but Eric and the others were tired and were accepting their new life. But then driders and darkmantles ambushed them, and they fought their way out and into a mysterious portal that opened. It dumped them from a height into the streets of Waterdeep, now in daytime and autumn. They were met by a girl who was pleased her spell had worked."
