        "mainbody": "'''Eric''', or '''the Cavalier''', was a [[fighter]] and an [[adventurer]] from [[Earth]] and [[the Realm]] ([[Forgotten Realms|no relation]]). He was a companion of the [[barbarian]] [[Bobby]], the [[monk]] [[Diana]], the [[ranger]] [[Hank]], the [[wizard]] [[Presto]], and the [[rogue]] [[Sheila]].{{Cite comic/Saturday Morning Adventures 1}}",
        "Personality": "Eric came across as very pompous and sarcastic, as well as pessimistic, and so he often irritated people. However, he was good at heart and actually cared a lot for his friends, and would occasionally show his true colors when trying to protect them. He feared being mocked or laughed at by others, so used his cutting words as a way to shield himself. While he was charismatic, he lacked bravery.",
        "Description": "Over his mail, he wore a yellow [[tabard]] and red [[cloak]].",
        "Abilities": "Eric both fought, and defended himself and his companions, with his powerful shield, with which he could bash or disarm a foe. It could also produce force fields.",
        "Possessions": "His primary possession was a large ''[[griffon shield]]''.",
        "History": {
            "The Victims of Tiamat": "Living long before the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], he was among a band of young adventurers who were all trying to find a way back to their distant home. However, it was said they were all slain horribly by [[Tiamat]], together with their miniature unicorn. By [[1369 DR]], the [[Adventurer Mart]] in [[Athkatla]], [[Amn]], displayed paintings of his two friends, Hank and Bobby.",
            "The Grand Tour of the Realms": "In the 1360s DR, Eric and his friends visited the town of [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]] in [[Faerûn]] so that Presto could ask the great sage [[Elminster]] to take him on as an apprentice. While drinking in the [[Old Skull Inn]], they spotted Elminster, but Eric dismissed him as old and insisted that wizards often told lies to make themselves appear more important. When Presto lost his nerve, Eric taunted him by making [[chicken]] noises, yet stood beside him to declare his suitability to Elminster.{{Cite comic/Forgotten Realms: The Grand Tour}}\n\nThus, Elminster whisked Presto away on a whirlwind tour of the Realms, and he came back traumatized and beaten and decided it best not to be his apprentice. Nevertheless, Presto had ideas for future adventures with his friends.\n\nAt this time, Eric was a middle-aged adult and wore a blue [[cloak]] over his dark-brown clothing.",
            "The High Sun Games": "In the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Eric and his friends, all adults now and without unicorn, were one of six teams competing in the [[High Sun Games]] in the newly built [[Neverwinter arena|arena]] in [[Neverwinter]]. They evaded the [[displacer beast]] and even got to the center of the maze and safely inside the sanctuary cage at the end, winning that round. However, the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Sofina]] used the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'' above the arena soon after, so their fate is unknown.<ref>{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}<ref group=\"note\">After reaching the cage, the cartoon characters are not seen again. The ''beckoning death'' smoke later engulfs their position in the arena, but it is likely they left before this. Their purpose for competing is also unknown, but they may also have been trying to stop Forge and Sofina.",
            "Went to Waterdeep": "Aged only 15, Eric and friends were camping in a forest one night when the Dungeon Master arrived to check on them, soon abandoning them again with promises of finding snacks, such as the spicy fried [[potato]]es they liked. Hank grew annoyed at this and their lack of progress on getting back to Earth; he had a new plan, but Eric and the others were tired and were accepting their new life. But then [[drider]]s and [[darkmantle]]s ambushed them, and they fought their way out and into a mysterious ''[[portal]]'' that opened. It dumped them from a height into the streets of [[Waterdeep]], now in daytime and autumn. They were met by a girl who was pleased her spell had worked.\n{{Sectstub}}"
