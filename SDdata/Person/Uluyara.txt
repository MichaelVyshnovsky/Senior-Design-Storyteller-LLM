'''Uluyara''' was a [[drow]] high priestess of [[Eilistraee]] in [[Velarswood]].

==Description==
Uluyara wore mail and a green tunic. She wielded a sword and wore a war horn around her neck. She had a number of magical tokens.

==History==
In [[1373 DR]], Uluyara accepted the conversion of [[Halisstra Melarn]] to [[Eilistraee]], allowing her to join the group of Eilistraeeans in Velarswood. When Halisstra and [[Ryld Argith]] were badly injured in the [[Cold Field]] when retrieving the [[Crescent Blade]], Uluyara and [[Feliane]] scried them and found them, arriving in time to save and heal them.

Uluyara and Feliane accompanied Halisstra to the [[Demonweb Pits]] in order to slay Lolth. There they created a small shrine to Eilistraee within Lolth's domain. Shortly afterwards, Uluyara was killed by Quenthel Baenre as a sacrifice to Lolth.

==Relationships==
[[Breen]] was a drow who had been brought into the faith by Uluyara and was like a daughter to her. Breen was killed by a [[yochlol]] in [[1373 DR]].
