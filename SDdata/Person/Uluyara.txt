Uluyara was a drow high priestess of Eilistraee in Velarswood.
Uluyara wore mail and a green tunic. She wielded a sword and wore a war horn around her neck. She had a number of magical tokens.
In 1373 DR, Uluyara accepted the conversion of Halisstra Melarn to Eilistraee, allowing her to join the group of Eilistraeeans in Velarswood. When Halisstra and Ryld Argith were badly injured in the Cold Field when retrieving the Crescent Blade, Uluyara and Feliane scried them and found them, arriving in time to save and heal them.
Uluyara and Feliane accompanied Halisstra to the Demonweb Pits in order to slay Lolth. There they created a small shrine to Eilistraee within Lolths domain. Shortly afterwards, Uluyara was killed by Quenthel Baenre as a sacrifice to Lolth.
Breen was a drow who had been brought into the faith by Uluyara and was like a daughter to her. Breen was killed by a yochlol in 1373 DR.
