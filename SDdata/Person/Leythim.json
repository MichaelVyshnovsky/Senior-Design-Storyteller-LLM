        "Description": "Leythim was a dusky-skinned, hazel-haired, and hazel-eyed [[human]] man. He wore a [[leather armor]] uniform of the Flaming Fist, armed with a simple [[dagger]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Manip Leythim frequented [[The Singing Lute]] eatery and tavern in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate. There, the Manip spilled his gut about his amorous misadventures of late. Leythim found himself in a tryst with [[Henrietta Hhune]], daughter of [[Hurlbut Hhune]], a Baldurian patriar. Their romance was ill-received as Henrietta was betrothed to [[Derque Rillyn]], a notoriously foul-tempered patriar noble. During the [[Absolute crisis]], Hurlbut Hhune hired thugs to beat Leythim up to convince the man to leave Henrietta for her noble marriage. The Manip sought a simple ''[[healing potion]]'' to patch himself up after the fight. He could not kick up a fuss over the nobles' business as he was afraid of a blowback to his beloved Hen."
