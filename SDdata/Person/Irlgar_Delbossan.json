In time, he stole so many horses and acted as horse-tender for so many caravans that he actually learned how to train horses. \nHe decided to settle in Espar and become the assistant of the old stable-master, Heuran. After Heurans death, Delbossan succeeded him as the new stable-master.\nDelbossan was the stable-master of Lord Hezom.\nDelbossan was a taciturn man with a quiet competence in the training and care of horses."
