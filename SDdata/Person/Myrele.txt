Myrele was one of the six daughters of Elhazir of Arabel and worked as a clerk in her fathers shop around 1368 DR.
Like the rest of her sisters, Myrele was modest yet gracefully attired. She was skilled at recognizing would-be thieves. She was one of three of the sisters whom Volothamp Geddarm knew by name, the other two being Chantra and Illume.
