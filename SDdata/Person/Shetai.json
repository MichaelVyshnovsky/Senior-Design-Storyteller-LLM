        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1352}}, Shetai, still an [[erinyes]] in the service of [[Malagard]], was summoned by [[Bryseis Kakistos]] and forged a [[Warlock|warlock pact]] with her.\n\nShetai was responsible for the fall of the Hag Countess and afterward gained much power. By [[1353 DR]], Shetai had become a paeliryon and explained to Bryseis that [[Asmodeus]] himself was interested in renewing her pact.\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century, it was collecting warlocks and double-crossed [[Lorcan]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, Shetai had some trouble and so asked Lorcan for help, using his sister [[Neferis]] as a messenger.",
        "Relationship": "Shetai had some dealings with Lorcan. The Vulgar Inquisitor was the patron of a warlock heir of the [[Toril thirteen]] called [[Lachs|Lachs the Yellow]]. Shetai commanded some of its fellow erinyes."
