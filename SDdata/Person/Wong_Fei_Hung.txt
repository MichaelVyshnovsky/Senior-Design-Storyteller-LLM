Wong Fei Hung was a Shou-ling monk of the Path of Enlightenment in Kara-Tur.
It was said that Chan Cheng, a god of war in Kara-Tur, one of the Nine Immortals, once descended to earth in the form of a dragon and challenged Wong Fei. The two battled each other for three days and three nights, and in the end Chan Cheng was so impressed by Wong Feis skill that he gave him a special ioun stone.
The stone remained with Wong Fei until he died, then disappeared.
