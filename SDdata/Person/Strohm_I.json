        "mainbody": "King '''Strohm I''' was the first king of [[Tethyr]] after the fall of the [[Shoon Imperium]], having slain the Imperium's last emperor [[Amahl Shoon VII]].",
        "Description": "Strohm I was born with only a single arm, but this did not stop him from becoming a powerful warrior. One of his nicknames was \"the Left Hand of Vengeance\".\n\nStrohm I was also a powerful magic-user. He was said to have destroyed the [[Calimshan|Calishite]] city of [[Kyrakkis]] single-handedly with his magic.",
        "Activities": "Strohm had the royal palace known as ''Sa'Tel'Qussiar'' constructed within the city of [[Zazesspur]] to serve as his residence. In later times, the location would become known as [[Alisande Court]].\n\nStrohm also ordered the construction of a wall with magic wards to surround the ruins of [[Shoonach]] to contain its evil within.",
        "Relationships": "Strohm I was an elf with [[Suldusk]] heritage. His father King [[Silvyr Ithal]]'s father was a [[half-elf]] whose human bloodline was descended from King [[Darrom Ithal]], and so Strohm, despite being an elf, was still of the royal Tethyrian line.\n\nStrohm married the granddaughter of former King [[Priam Tornamn]], who had been a friend of his father's.\n\n[[Strohm II]], Strohm I's successor, was a half-elf and Strohm I's grandson.",
        "History": "In the [[450 DR|Year of the Corrie Fist, 450 DR]], [[Alzhedo dictionary#Q|Qysar]] Amahl VII treacherously cheated in single combat with Prince Strohm's father and poisoned him. To avenge the death of his father and end the reign of Amahl, Strohm planned a strategy that involved surrounding the city of Shoonach from all four sides, while his hidden troops and freed slaves within would emerge from the sewers. He enacted his plans on [[Hammer 30]], during a victory celebration the city was having over his father's defeat. Strohm himself and his [[Elf|elven]] and [[human]] bodyguards magically attacked the Imperial Mount. Just after midnight, on [[Midwinter]], Amahl Shoon VII was slain in combat by Strohm, and the Shoonite Imperium was ended forever.\n\nPrince Strohm then burned the whole city in what became known as the [[Great Fires of Shoonach]]. Every known member of the Shoon family was killed, along with high-ranking nobles and military commanders. After this, Strohm was unchallenged as King of Tethyr, but he left the people of Calimshan to rule themselves.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "Many [[Tethyrian]]s believed that King Strohm was a [[human]] enchanted to look like an elf, as they found it difficult to believe that an elf could rule over Tethyr, a rumor begun in the inaccurate work of history entitled the ''[[Chronicla Tethyria]]''."
