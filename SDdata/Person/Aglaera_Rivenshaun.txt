Aglaera Rivenshaun was a traveling bard, highly-regarded in the nations of Chondath, Chessenta, and Turmish for her husky voice in the late 14 century DR.
This flame-tressed entertainer witnessed a rare event in the late 14 century DR as she traversed Chondalwood – the fabled Dancing Dryads. These hauntingly beautiful dancing forest dryads were a rare sight and were thought to be an omen of great upheaval in Faerûn.
