'''Aglaera Rivenshaun''' was a traveling [[bard]], highly-regarded in the nations of [[Chondath]], [[Chessenta]], and [[Turmish]] for her husky voice in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
This flame-tressed entertainer witnessed a rare event in the late 14{{th}} century DR as she traversed [[Chondalwood]] – the fabled [[Dancing Dryads]]. These hauntingly beautiful dancing forest [[dryad]]s were a rare sight and were thought to be an omen of great upheaval in [[Faerûn]].
