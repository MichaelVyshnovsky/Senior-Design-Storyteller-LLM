        "mainbody": "Dienje Xavarri was a priestess of Iyachtu Xvim active in the Thayan city of Bezantur in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nDienje was fanatical in her devotion to Iyachtu Xvim and dedicated every aspect of her life in his name.\nShe was the high priest and overseer of the House of Iyachtu Xvim following its construction in the 1360s DR. and a result, she was also the most powerful member of the Thayan church of Iyachtu Xvim, second only to the god himself. While Xvim was known to visit the House from time to time, Dienje was in charge of day-to-day operations of the temple and faith.\nConsistent with her gods desire to usurp the powers of Cyric, Dienje was embroiled in a conflict between her followers and the Cyricists at the nearby House of Cyric. \nIt was said that Dienje was not only Xvims faithful priestess, but his lover as well. Some believed that the pair had at least one child, although it was unknown whether such an offspring would possess divine power or what kind of destiny a child of Xvim&mdashand grandchild of Bane&mdashmight posses."
