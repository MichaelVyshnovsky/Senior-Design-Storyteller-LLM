Glim Folkor was am adventuring gnome, active in the late 14 century DR.
Glim was a short gnomish individual with a pronounced nose who preferred gentle-blue-hued adventuring garb.
In Kythorn of the , Waterdeep â€“ the City of Splendors, became once again menaced by the drow from the mega-dungeon of Undermountain. The Masked Lords determined that the danger was coming from underneath the Yawning Portal, and Durnan, the proprietor of the famed establishment, put out a call for adventurers willing to traverse the dungeons depths and route the evil within.
Gnome Glim Folkor was among the heroes who answered the call. He was present at the Yawning Portals common room, when a squadron of drow assassins sent by "queen" Valsharess attacked. The dark elves slaughtered many of the gathered adventurers, including Glim Folkor. Survivors chased the assassins down into the Undermountain, while those killed were resurrected by the citys clergy. Cocky and eager before, Glims self confidence was shattered. The gnome conceded that he was no match for the dreaded drow and refused to venture into the Undermountain.
