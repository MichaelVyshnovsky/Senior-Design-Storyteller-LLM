'''Glim Folkor''' was am adventuring [[gnome]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Glim was a short gnomish individual with a pronounced nose who preferred gentle-blue-hued adventuring garb.

==History==
In [[Kythorn]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, [[Waterdeep]] â€“ the City of Splendors, became once again menaced by the [[drow]] from the mega-dungeon of [[Undermountain]]. The [[Masked Lord]]s determined that the danger was coming from underneath the [[Yawning Portal]], and [[Durnan]], the proprietor of the famed establishment, put out a call for adventurers willing to traverse the dungeon's depths and route the evil within.

Gnome Glim Folkor was among the heroes who answered the call. He was present at the Yawning Portal's common room, when a squadron of drow [[assassin]]s sent by "queen" [[Valsharess]] attacked. The dark elves slaughtered many of the gathered adventurers, including Glim Folkor. Survivors chased the assassins down into the Undermountain, while those killed were resurrected by the city's [[cleric|clergy]]. Cocky and eager before, Glim's self confidence was shattered. The gnome conceded that he was no match for the dreaded drow and refused to venture into the Undermountain.
