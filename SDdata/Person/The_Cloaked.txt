The Cloaked was the only known resident wizard in Blackhold, Fimbrul, as of 1479 DR.
The Cloaked wore a hooded black cloak, hence its name. Its appearance was shrouded with a magical dark aura that made it impossible to determine its true identity or its gender.
The Cloaked performed rituals and other magical services for those who were able to pay for them, but never left Blackhold for any reason.
