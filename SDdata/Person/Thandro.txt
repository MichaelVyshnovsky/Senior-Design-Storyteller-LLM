'''Thandro''' was a [[noble]] of [[Marsember]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was a participant in the [[Rightful Conspiracy]]. When discussing [[Alusair Obarskyr]], he treated her with great disdain.

==History==
After the [[War Wizards]]' raid on the Rightful Conspiracy in [[Marsember]] in the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, one of the people still involved with it was Thandro. With a fellow conspirator in an apparently empty warehouse, sounding rather amused, he described the place and time for an upcoming ambush at [[Thundarlyn Hall]] for Princess Alusair and Queen [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]] and expected himself to join it. Unknown to him, he was eavesdropped on by [[Malakar Surth]] and [[Aumun Tholant Bezrar]].
