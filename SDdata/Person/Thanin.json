        "mainbody": "Thanin was a dragonsoul of the Cult of the Dragon that led the cults efforts to manipulate and control interests in the Whipsering Caverns during the late 15 century DR.\nWhile his exact race was not unclear, Thanin appeared as a massive humanoid with distinctly draconic features, including the rear-facing horns and hide of a red dragon. He had a pair of dragon-like wings jutting out of his back.\nDragonsoul Thanin wielded a sword and shield in battle.\nIn the 1480s DR, Thanin and the Dragon Cultists managed to break into duergar tunnels while searching for the hidden treasure trove of the ancient dragon Saphirax. Thanin knew the Saphiraxs hoard held a number of old, powerful artifacts and believed it was located somewhere near her old nest.\nAfter the cult established a foothold in the tunnels, they found Saphiraxs remains and prepared a ritual to commune with her. Ultimately, their plot was thwarted by Drann Barrow and Shay Cutter of the Zhentarim, and Thanin himself was defeated by the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge."
