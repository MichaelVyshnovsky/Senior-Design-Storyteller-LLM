        "mainbody": "'''Thanin''' was a [[dragonsoul]] of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that led the cult's efforts to manipulate and control interests in the [[Whipsering Caverns]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "While his exact race was not unclear, Thanin appeared as a massive [[humanoid]] with distinctly draconic features, including the rear-facing horns and hide of a [[red dragon]]. He had a pair of dragon-like wings jutting out of his back.",
        "Possessions": "Dragonsoul Thanin wielded a [[sword]] and [[shield]] in battle.",
        "History": "In the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Thanin and the Dragon Cultists managed to break into [[duergar]] tunnels while searching for the hidden treasure trove of the ancient [[dragon]] [[Saphirax]]. Thanin knew the Saphirax's hoard held a number of old, powerful [[artifact]]s and believed it was located somewhere near her old nest.\n\nAfter the cult established a foothold in the tunnels, they found Saphirax's remains and prepared a [[ritual]] to commune with her. Ultimately, their plot was thwarted by [[Drann Barrow]] and [[Shay Cutter]] of the [[Zhentarim]], and Thanin himself was defeated by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]]."
