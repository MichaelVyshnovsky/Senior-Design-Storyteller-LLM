'''Z'neth''' was an [[hobgoblin]] [[larva]] merchant inside the [[Wandering Emporium]], which traveled across the plains of [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]].

==History==
Once Z'neth was a promising warlord in a [[Prime Material plane]]. With the secret support of [[Mahadi]], Z'neth rose through the ranks quickly and soon the god [[Maglubiyet]] instructed Z'neth to go to [[Gehenna]] to lead a military campaign. During this campaign, however, Mahadi came to collect his debt and Z'neth was forced to abandon the battlefield and go to the Emporium.

==Activities==
Z'neth bought and sold larvae. He used all his profits to hire assassins in order to kill Mahadi and have his revenge, but the [[rakshasa]] only found this funny.

==Personality==
Z'neth was full of frustration. He had dreamed of dying in the service of his god but Mahadi forced him into an eternity of obscurity.
