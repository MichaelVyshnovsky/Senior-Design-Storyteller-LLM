Zagreus Dosse was a wandering traveler and a member of a cell of the Cult of Reborn Flame that operated out of Sambral, one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond, in 1479 DR.
Zagreus was considered a very good-looking human male.
In 1479 DR, Zagreus was recruited by Bazamarl to join his cell of the Cult of Reborn Flame. Zagreus joined because he was looking to give some semblance of purpose to his life.
When a band of adventurers that were sent by Halagothra the Healer to Sambral to destroy the cell of the cult operating there killed both Bazalmarl and the Firebird, Zagreus fled in panic, avoiding being killed by the adventurers.
