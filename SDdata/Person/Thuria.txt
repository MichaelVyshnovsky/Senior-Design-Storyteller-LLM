'''Thuria''' was a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] in the [[Doomvault]] dungeon in [[1486 DR]].

==Personality==
Thuria was a coward, not wanting to risk his life for the Red Wizards. He was also bored in his work.

==History==
Thuria was a wizard assigned to the secret complex of Doomvault under [[Thaymount]]. He was tasked with controlling the gardens that supported the Blood Pens.

In 1486 DR, when the heroes of [[Daggerford]] arrived, Thuria and his minions readied to fight them. However, when defeated, he surrendered, pleading for his life and offering information about the dungeon in exchange and even helping them against his fellow Red Wizards.

==Relationship==
Thuria had a [[black dragon]] [[wyrmling]] as his personal pet.
