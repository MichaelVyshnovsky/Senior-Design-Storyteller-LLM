Bellanka Petrou was a short-lived member of a cell of the Cult of Reborn Flame that operated out of Sambral, one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond, in 1479 DR.
Bellanka was a teenager human female with long hair that fell in ringlets.
In 1479 DR, Bellanka was recruited by Bazamarl to join his cell of the Cult of Reborn Flame. Because of her brief time in the cult, she was not a worshiper of the primordial Achazar.
Two days later, a band of adventurers that were sent by Halagothra the Healer to Sambral to destroy the cell of the cult operating there, killed both Bazalmarl and the Firebird. Bellanka fled in panic, avoiding being killed by the adventurers.
