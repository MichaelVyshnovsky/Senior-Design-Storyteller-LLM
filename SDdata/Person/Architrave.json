        "mainbody": "'''Architrave''' was a [[malaugrym]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century. He sought [[spellfire]] in the [[Prime Material plane]].",
        "Description": "A shapeshifter, Architrave's own form was mutable. While in his own form, Architrave made use of multiple tentacles.",
        "Personality": "The malaugrym chafed under the need for keeping up his guard.",
        "Abilities": "He showed great prowess when using his tentacles in combat.",
        "Possessions": "Architrave carried a ''[[doomstar]]'' that required recharging, per him.",
        "Relationships": "Architrave stayed close to his sister, [[Sintre]]. They had spent some time with their mother, [[Amarune]], but he had talked to her less than his sister. He suspected their father may have been [[Dhalgrave]].",
        "History": "Architrave was named after a late [[human]] servant of [[Malaug]]. They'd known their mother, Amarune, for some time, but she'd since disappeared from their lives, and he never truly knew whom his sire was. By {{yearlink|1357}}, he came to seek [[spellfire]] at the [[Gates of Doom]], though [[Shandril]] had yet to manifest the ability, strongly implying he possessed some foresight of the coming events.\n\nAt that point Architrave and his sister, Sintre, came across two other malaugrym, [[Magusta]] and [[Stralane]], while impersonating warriors in the caravan of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] at the Gates of Doom. One of the four, almost certainly Architrave himself,As Architrave is hunting for spellfire, and the killer sought entry across the Gates, it stands to reason that Architrave was the most likely killer. decided to kill the rest of the caravan to make their way, and their partner revealed themselves; the other two showed themselves afterwards, and a fight ensued between the two groups. Architrave and Sintre lost the other two, of which one had determined that Architrave was seeking spellfire. Architrave sought this spellfire to wield it as a weapon against the Shadowmaster High.\n\nArchitrave kept hunting for spellfire for at least two more months. He posed as a priest of [[Bane]] during a coup at [[Zhentil Keep]]; it was there that his sister found out he sought spellfire, and he revealed to her the ''doomstar'' that was the linchpin of his plan.\n\nNot long after, Architrave struck against [[Thiszult]] of the Cult of the Dragon, who fled him. Afterwards, Architrave flew up into the air, drawing the attention of [[Shargrailar]], who slew him on the spot. The event happened on [[Flamerule 9]]."
