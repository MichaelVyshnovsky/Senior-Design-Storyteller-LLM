        "Personality": "Eregul was a cautious and scheming individual who spoke with a drawling voice peppered with sardonic mannerisms. He was always in search of the best opportunities to rise in rank. He greatly disliked [[Orgauth]] for his eternal smile.",

        "History": "Eregul joined the Zhentarim as an independent ally of [[Manshoon]] in order to gain power and influence. His long-term plan was to supplant [[Thagdal]] as master of the [[Tower of the Art]] in [[Zhentil Keep]] and obtain a place in the Lords' Council. He wandered [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]] and the [[Dalelands]]. In 1370 DR, however, Eregul was in [[Darkhold]] to take command of the [[Zhent]] wizards there.\n\nIn [[1375 DR]], Eregul was the most high-ranking Zhent wizard in the [[Zhentarim Occupation Army]] in Shadowdale.\nDuring the fighting in the dale, he led a supply caravan arriving from [[Voonlar]]. However, some adventurers and Dalesfolk ambushed the caravan and during the fighting Eregul was killed."
