        "mainbody": "Salazon was a lesser wizard that worked with the Zhentarim that operated a hidden cavern beneath a stretch of the Risen Road during the late 15 century DR.\nHe was a bit of a nervous fellow that thoroughly preferred not being dead.\nWhen the Zhent leader Zarys ordered her group to abandon and eventually destroy their hideout beneath Waukeens Rest, Salazon was given the unenviable position of carrying out their first line of defense. If anyone came into the warehouse behind the inn, without knowing the correct passphrase, Salazon would ignite a series of explosive barrels killing the intruders and himself before they could gain entry."
