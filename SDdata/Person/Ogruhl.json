        "mainbody": "gruhl was a dragon tortoise that lived in the Anauroch desert for thousands of years, dating back to the times of ancient Netheril.\nDuring his time in the desert, Ogruhl developed a trusting and cooperative bond with a band of desert chwingas. The little elemental spirits would bring Ogruhl small parcels of food and water over time, and the great tortoise provided them with safety and shelter within the little caves in his massive shell.\nCenturies before the Era of Upheaval, Ogruhl was imprisoned by a particularly callous Netherese mage and magically bound to one of the empires terrestrial cities. Once the city was abandoned by the Netherese, Ogruhl was left to languish along in the desert.\nEventually, Ogruhl was discovered by the group of chwingas with whom formed a mutually beneficial relationship. Unfortunately it remained bound to the ruins of its former home city, even as of the late 15 century DR."
