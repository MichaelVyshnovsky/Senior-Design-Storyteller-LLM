'''Zud''' was the chieftain of an [[orc]] tribe that feuded with another group of orcs that once belonged to the same tribe led by [[Mol the Great|Mol]]. The tribe resided in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Possessions==
Zud possessed quite a few magic items he and his tribe scavenged from the ruined Myth Drannor. Among the items found on his body were a ''[[wand of frost]]'', a ''[[wand of healing]]'', and potions of ''[[antidote]]''.

His most prized possessions, however, were hidden under a lock and key inside a chest: ''[[gauntlets of dexterity]]'' and ''[[Deathbane]]'', an enchanted staff that belonged to a blind [[cleric]] [[Beriand]].

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], Zud's tribe was occupying a part of the Main Halls in the ruins of Myth Drannor's [[Dwarven Dungeons]]. His tribe was fighting for territory with the newly arrived [[Cult of the Dragon]] and against the splintered group of orcs led by his old opponent, captain [[Mol the Great]].

Later the same year, both forces of the tribe and the cult encountered a a group of adventurers from [[Phlan]] making their way to the center of the ruins, [[Castle Cormanthor]] to stop the cult's nefarious plans of conquering he [[Moonsea]] region. The adventurers confronted Zud, along with two of his most loyal advisers, an orc [[shaman]] and an orc [[witch doctor]] in the Main Halls of the Dwarven Dungeons. Soon after Zud's death, his hated opponent Mol fell to the same group of adventurers..
