Lehaya was a windsoul genasi and the Steward of the Sky of the Four Stewards of Akanûl in 1479 DR.
Lehaya was a genasi with silver skin and blue szuldar lines.
As the Steward of the Sky, Lehaya was in charge with administering the laws of Akanûl. 
Lehaya avoided using her influence to punish her political enemies, offering leniency to those that could gave her some political advantage. Since such individuals were usually nobles, Lehaya balanced things by frequently pardoning commoners brought before her for minor crimes minor offenses. Because of her famous "mercy", she was given the nickname "Mother Law."
Lehaya used her fame to hide her extracurricular interest studying the Virushead, 
In 1479 DR, as Queen Arathane opposed the experimentation with the Virushead, and fearing the other Stewards will not support her, Lehaya sent her wizards to study the Virushead in secret. 
When the threat of a war between Akanûl and Tymanther became inminent later that year, Lehaya was the only one of the Stewards who didnt wanted to battle against the dragonborn. However, she did not oppose her fellow Stewards when they decided to sent the army to help Tchazzar against the Tymantherans.
