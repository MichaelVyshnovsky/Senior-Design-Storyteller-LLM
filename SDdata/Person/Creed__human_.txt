Sergeant '''Creed''' was a soldier of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] who fought for [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Creed served under [[Janros|Captain Janros]], an [[elven]] officer of the Gguard. The sergeant was himself aided by [[Lysson]], along with a number of other Neverwintan soldiers.

==History==
After the [[Siege of Neverwinter]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Sergeant Creed was stationed at the [[Fallen Tower Tavern]] in the [[Tower District]]. He helped coordinate efforts to free that part of the city from occupation by the [[Many-Arrows]] [[orc]]s.

To accomplish this, he ordered an [[adventurer]] sent by Sergeant [[Alphonse Knox]] to slay orcish forces in [[Waukeen's Way]] to avenge the torture of Neverwintan captives. After this, Creed ordered the adventurer to rescue fellow guardsmen who had been captured while on patrol and threatened with torture at orc hands. To [[fighter]] and [[barbarian]]s, he gave temporary field commissions with the rank of corporal and had them confirm that the Guard's barricades along Pedlars Path were well-secured and report their status to Janros. Finally, he tasked the adventurer with finding lost dispatches from slain Neverwintan couriers and completing their delivery to Janros; these would give Janros insight into the whereabouts of [[Karr Nevrim]], a Nashers agent who colluded with the Many-Arrows orcs.
