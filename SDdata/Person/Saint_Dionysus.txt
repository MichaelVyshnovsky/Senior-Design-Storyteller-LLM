{{Quote|''By the blessings of the drunken god's double visions!''|Friar [[Dugald]]}}
'''St. Dionysus''', or '''St. Dionysius''', was a [[saint]] of the [[god]] [[Ilmater]] and patron saint of [[wine]] and other [[alcohol]]ic spirits.

The [[Order of St. Dionysus]] was based around St. Dionysus. The [[Church of Dionysus]], a center of the Order and devoted to the saint, began construction in the city of [[Goliad]] in [[Damara]] in the [[1359 DR|Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR]]. As a result, St. Dionysus was honored in Damara.
