        "mainbody": "'''Sumulael''', who was formerly '''Ezarhaddon bin Kior''', was a powerful [[necromancer]] inhabiting the ruined city of [[Ysawis]] in the [[Grey Jungle]] of [[east Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}",
        "Description": "Once considered to be a handsome man, Sumulael's many indulgences left him obese and ravaged his body in other ways. He sweated constantly and his pale flesh hung from his heavy frame. He stood a hair under {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall. He always wore extremely expensive pieces of jewelry.",
        "History": "Originally from [[Hilm]] in the [[Pantheist League]], Ezarhaddon studied at the university in the City of Kindness. It was here that he met an [[ajami]] [[wizard]] named [[Al-Nasr]], or \"the vulture\", who taught him the dark art of [[necromancy]]. When authorities discovered his knowledge of the forbidden [[magic]] they drove him and his wife, [[Zaribel]], from the city. The fleeing couple eventually settled in the [[Cities of the Ancients]] region where they could flaunt their dark skills. It was here that Ezarhaddon adopted the name Sumulael, which meant \"Harvester of Death\" in [[Kadari]].",
        "Activities": "Once settled in the ruined city of Ysawis in the Grey Jungle, Sumulael used his powers to raise an army of [[undead]] servants to satisfy his needs.",
        "Abilities": "Sumulael usually had the following [[spell]]s memorized: ''[[chill touch]]'', ''[[detect undead]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[shocking grasp]]'', ''[[darkness, 15' radius]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[spectral hand]]'', ''[[stinking cloud]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[slow]]'', ''[[vampiric touch]]'', ''[[bestow curse]]'', ''[[contagion]]'', ''[[enervation]]'', ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'', ''[[minor globe of invulnerability]]'', ''[[wall of ice]]'', ''[[animate dead]]'', ''[[magic jar]]'', ''[[summon shadow]]'', ''[[Bloodstone's spectral steed]]'', ''[[claws of the umber hulk]]'', ''[[death spell]]'', ''[[flame of justice]]'', ''[[finger of death]]'', ''[[reverse gravity]]'', ''[[Abi-Dalzim's horrid wilting]]'', ''[[trap the soul]]'', ''[[spirit armor]]''.",
        "Possessions": "He carried many [[magic item]]s including a ''[[robe of eyes]]'', ''[[wand of lightning]]'', ''[[ring of protection]]'', ''[[pipes of pain]]'', ''[[periapt of proof against poison]]'', ''[[oil of impact]]'', a ''[[scroll of protection from possession]]'', a ''[[potion of fire resistance]]'', a ''[[potion of healing]]'', and a ''[[potion of speed]]''. Sumulael also wielded fifteen throwing [[dart]]s coated with ''[[dreambliss]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Sumulael spent most of his time in isolation with his pet [[homunculus]] [[Buri]]."
