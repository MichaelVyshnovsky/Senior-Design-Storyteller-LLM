Dark Linsa was a thief in Phlan working for the Welcomers thieves guild in the late 15 century DR.
After Vorgansharaxs coup, the Welcomers allied with the Zhentarim. Circa 1486 DR, she was sent by the Zhents to keep control of a celebration in honor of Mielikki in the village of Elventree in Cormanthor. She had a message from Chaab to fellow Zhents.
