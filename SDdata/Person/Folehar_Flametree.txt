Folehar Flametree was a halfling fighter-thief adventurer, merchant, and smuggler based in Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the midâ€“14 century DR. Circa 1358 DR, he was one of the more important personalities of the city.
He traded in rare and special items, including gems stolen from royal treasures, magic looted from tombs, and heirs and heiresses kidnapped from their families, and so on.
He was regularly reproached by Lord Dhelt when his smuggling irritated the authorities of Iriaebor, Baldurs Gate, Waterdeep, and Amn.
