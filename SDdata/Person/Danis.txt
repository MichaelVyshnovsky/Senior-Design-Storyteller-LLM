'''Danis''' was a [[tiefling]] from [[Elturel]] who along with his mate [[Bex]] and others of their kind, were kicked out of [[Elturel]] following the cataclysmic event known as [[the Descent]].

==Personality==
He was man of good spirits who maintained a positive outlook on life, especially when focused on his future with his beloved Bex. The two dreamed of starting a new life together in [[Baldur's Gate]], getting a nice little house and starting an eatery in the [[Baldur's Gate/Outer City|Outer City]].

==Ability==
Danis brewed a mean pot of [[spice]]d [[tea]], that according to Bex, was "life-changing".

==History==
When the tieflings of Elturel were exiled in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Danis and Bex joined the group led by the former [[Hellrider]] [[Zevlor]] and traveled west along the [[Risen Road]]. Unfortunately the community of tieflings were beset by [[goblin]] attacks and forced to request aid from the [[druid]] [[Halsin]] and his fellows at the [[Emerald Grove]]. While the couple and their fellow tieflings were safe with temporary shelter, tensions grew between them and the druids after Halsin went missing and [[Kagha]] took over temporary leadership.

These dynamics did little to deter Danis or Bex, who remained blissfully focused on one another and their shared dreams for a new life in a new city.
