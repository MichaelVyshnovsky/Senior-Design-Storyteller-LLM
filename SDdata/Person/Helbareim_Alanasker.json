        "mainbody": "Helbareim Alanasker, known as \"the Storm Wind\", was a TashalanDragons of Faerûn, page 74, gives Helbareims ethnicity as \"Lapaliiyan\". However, this is a nationality, not an ethnicity, and Ormpur is not officially a part of Lapaliiya. The dominant ethnicity of Ormpur and Lapaliiya is Tashalan, so this is assumed to Helbareims ethnicity. human fighter and blackguard of Tiamat and the High Suikh (king) of the city-state of Ormpur on the northeastern edge of Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe came to power by opposing Queen Maerildarraine who, in 1306 DR, had rebelled against Tiamat and killed her foster father Askulder, the \"Hand of Tiamat\", before plundering and burning the royal temple of Tiamat and triggering a holy war as she usurped the throne. Supported by the church of Tiamat, Helbareim eventually deposed Maerildarraine. She died fighting in her own throne room and Helbareim became High Suikh himself.\nIn the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Helbareims daughter and only heir, Chansreena  Alabhansree Alanasker, went missing from Ormpur. Also missing were many magical blades that had been kept hidden in secret storage niches in the palace, and a large amount of saffron, comprising Ormpurs entire reserve, as well as other spices—all of this a fortune intended as the Chansreenas dowry.\nObsessed with finding her, Helbareim spent a good deal of the citys treasury in efforts to locate and retrieve Alabhansree, all without success. He first suspected several notorious thieves Hoond of Shussel, Veldyn \"the Fingers\" Uruin, and even the adventurer Torm of the Knights of Myth Drannor. The whole Ormpurian court believed the thief had originated from the North, and Ormpurian agents in Waterdeep hunted for information in that city and all along the Sword Coast.\nLater, based on false reports, he hired a number of adventuring companies to raid the slave pits of Llurth Dreier, a drow city in the Underdark beneath the Shaar. However, he would not find a single clue to her true fate, and these failures broke his spirit.\nHelbareims deteriorating state continued the decline of Ormpur after the war and it fell further and further under the power of the Overking of Lapaliiya.Dragons of Faerûn, page 74, apparently mistakenly mixes up Shaliims and Helbareims problems, saying the Black Wyrms want revenge against Helbareim, when Serpent Kingdoms page 103 already established their threat to Shaliim. There is no known reason for them to threaten Ormpur or Helbareim. This article describes the most likely situation.\nHelbareim was a devout follower of Tiamat, the Dragon Queen, and one of her most significant servitors in Faerûn. He upheld her faith in a land replete with rival gods.\nHelbareims only daughter and sole heir was Alabhansree Alanasker, chansreena of the realm. However, he was a strict and almost tyrannical father. Cold and uncaring, he saw her as a commodity to be traded in marriage to anyone if it was in his interests. Her disappearance broke his spirit but he remained obsessed with locating her. With his daughter missing, Helbareim was left the last of his line.\nHelbareim was supported by the church of Tiamat."
