        "mainbody": "'''Helbareim Alanasker''', known as \"the Storm Wind\", was a [[Tashalan]]''[[Dragons of Faerûn]]'', page 74, gives Helbareim's ethnicity as \"Lapaliiyan\". However, this is a nationality, not an ethnicity, and Ormpur is not officially a part of Lapaliiya. The dominant ethnicity of Ormpur and Lapaliiya is Tashalan, so this is assumed to Helbareim's ethnicity. [[human]] [[fighter]] and [[blackguard]] of [[Tiamat]] and the High Suikh (king) of the city-state of [[Ormpur]] on the northeastern edge of [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "He came to power by opposing Queen [[Maerildarraine]] who, in [[1306 DR]], had rebelled against Tiamat and killed her foster father [[Askulder]], the \"Hand of Tiamat\", before plundering and burning the royal temple of Tiamat and triggering a holy war as she usurped the throne. Supported by the [[church of Tiamat]], Helbareim eventually deposed Maerildarraine. She died fighting in her own throne room and Helbareim became High Suikh himself.{{Cite dragon/272/The New Adventures of Volo: Quotations of the Realms|97}}\n\nIn the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], Helbareim's daughter and only heir, Chansreena  [[Alabhansree Alanasker]], went missing from Ormpur. Also missing were many magical blades that had been kept hidden in secret storage niches in the palace, and a large amount of [[saffron]], comprising Ormpur's entire reserve, as well as other [[spices]]—all of this a fortune intended as the Chansreena's dowry.{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Everwinking Eye: At Home in Maskyr's Eye|21}}\n\nObsessed with finding her, Helbareim spent a good deal of the city's treasury in efforts to locate and retrieve Alabhansree, all without success. He first suspected several notorious thieves: [[Hoond]] of [[Shussel]], [[Veldyn Uruin|Veldyn \"the Fingers\" Uruin]], and even the adventurer [[Torm (adventurer)|Torm]] of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]]. The whole Ormpurian court believed the thief had originated from the [[North]], and Ormpurian agents in [[Waterdeep]] hunted for information in that city and all along the [[Sword Coast]].\n\nLater, based on false reports, he hired a number of adventuring companies to raid the slave pits of [[Llurth Dreier]], a [[drow]] city in the [[Underdark]] beneath the [[Shaar]]. However, he would not find a single clue to her true fate, and these failures broke his spirit.\n\nHelbareim's deteriorating state continued the decline of Ormpur after the war and it fell further and further under the power of the Overking of Lapaliiya.''Dragons of Faerûn'', page 74, apparently mistakenly mixes up Shaliim's and Helbareim's problems, saying the Black Wyrms want revenge against Helbareim, when ''[[Serpent Kingdoms]]'' page 103 already established their threat to Shaliim. There is no known reason for them to threaten Ormpur or Helbareim. This article describes the most likely situation.",
        "Activities": "Helbareim was a devout follower of Tiamat, the Dragon Queen, and one of her most significant servitors in [[Faerûn]]. He upheld her faith in a land replete with rival gods.",
        "Relations": "Helbareim's only daughter and sole heir was Alabhansree Alanasker, chansreena of the realm. However, he was a strict and almost tyrannical father. Cold and uncaring, he saw her as a commodity to be traded in marriage to anyone if it was in his interests. Her disappearance broke his spirit but he remained obsessed with locating her. With his daughter missing, Helbareim was left the last of his line.\n\nHelbareim was supported by the church of Tiamat."
