She was interred in her family crypt and then rose as a watchghost; during her tenure as an [[undead]] over the ruin, she'd made the acquaintance of a younger Elminster, and much later on, of Mirt, who was a remote descendant of her line.\n\nIn the late {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Mirt guided [[Delg]], [[Shandril Shessair]] and [[Narm Tamaraith]] to [[Tethgard]] as a safety measure, as they were pursued by [[Zhentilar]]. While there, Mirt was forced to call out to Duskreene to get her aid in destroying the Zhentilar. She later made an acquaintance of his guests."
