'''Mythrellan''' was the [[zulkir]] of [[Illusion]] and one of the eight leaders of the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She lived in the [[Serpent Tower]], within the city of [[Bezantur]] in [[Priador]]. She was known to have only mindless servants.

==Appearance==
Mythrellan changed her appearance as often as other noblewomen change their gowns. At times she had golden eyes and sky blue skin, while at others she patterned her body in brown and tan diamonds that resembled the skin of a snake.

==Personality==
She preferred isolation and devoted most of her time to study.

==History==
[[File:Mythrellan's Tower.png|thumb|''Tower home of [[zulkir]] Mythrellan in [[Bezantur]].'']]
Some time before [[1320 DR]], Mythrellan took the young man [[Lailomum Zerad]] as an apprentice.

Sometime before [[1362 DR]] [[Rembert Wellford]] apprenticed under her.

Mythrellan served as zulkir of illusion for many years, even assuming the title before the birth of Zulkir [[Aznar Thrul]].

Mythrellan died some time between [[1373 DR|1373]] and [[1375 DR]], presumably by the zulkir-[[lich]] [[Szass Tam]], and was replaced as zulkir by [[Dmitra Flass]].
