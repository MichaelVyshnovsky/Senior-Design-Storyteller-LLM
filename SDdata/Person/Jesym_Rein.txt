'''Jesym Rein''' was an infamous citizen of the [[Rein]] family of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Jesym was the daughter of [[Deldron Rein]] and an older sister to [[Stedd Rein|Stedd]].

==History==
As the daughter of Deldron Rein, leader of the [[Red Boar Trading Coster]] and owner of properties such as the [[Red Boar Inn]],<ref> Jesym was born to the wealthy and influential Rein family of Loudwater, which had immigrated from [[Waterdeep]] some six decades earlier.

In the summer of the {{yearlinkName|1369}}, [[Zhentarim]] out of [[Llorkh]] seized control of the neighboring town of [[Orlbar]].<ref> The people soon revolted against their tyrannical rule, and they were backed by Loudwater. But Jesym Rein turned traitor to both the Orlbar rebels and the Loudwater soldiers, by revealing their battle plans and their concealed caches of [[weapon]]s and [[potion]]s to the Zhentarim. Thanks to her, the Zhentarim and [[cleric]]s of [[Iyachtu Xvim]] brutally crushed the rebellion and Loudwater was forced to sign the [[Oath of Orlbar]], a peace treaty that marked a border between the two states in the years after.<ref>

Her actions tarnished the Rein name with a reputation for treachery, though this was soon healed when her brother Stedd displayed as much as heroism and leadership in the [[Night of the Blood Moon]] battle in autumn later that year.{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/A Fellowship Rises}}

Jesym did not live as long, however. By [[1372 DR]], the Zhents commemorated her betrayal in a mural in the Martyrs' Tribute room in the [[Fortress of the Eternal Despot]], a temple to Xvim, and later [[Bane]], built overlooking Orlbar.This tribute to Jesym here suggests she is a follower of Xvim and is deceased by the adventure date of 1372 DR, likely killed in the fighting over Orlbar.
