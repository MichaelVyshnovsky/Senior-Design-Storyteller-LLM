'''Falious''' was a [[Netherese]] [[archwizard]] and the ruler of the [[Tanathras]] [[Netherese enclave|enclave]].

==History==
The [[good]]ly archwizard established his enclave over [[Dagger's Point]] in {{YearlinkConvert|3212|NY}} and decided to clear the city of the [[evil]] that pervaded it. [[Trothas Helgaras]] ruled Dagger's Point, which had high levels of assassinations and robberies. Trothas found out that Falious came to cleanse his city, and commanded his men (under disguise of his previous students) to infiltrate Tanathras. Falious, without knowing the truth about Trothas' men, followed their instructions to the intended spot. For Trothas, everything went to plan as he cast a ''[[disintegrate]]'' [[spell]] at the [[mythallar]] of [[Tanathras]], causing Falious' enclave to plummet into the [[Dagger Mountains]].
