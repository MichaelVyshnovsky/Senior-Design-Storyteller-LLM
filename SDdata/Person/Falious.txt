Falious was a Netherese archwizard and the ruler of the Tanathras enclave.
The goodly archwizard established his enclave over Daggers Point in  and decided to clear the city of the evil that pervaded it. Trothas Helgaras ruled Daggers Point, which had high levels of assassinations and robberies. Trothas found out that Falious came to cleanse his city, and commanded his men (under disguise of his previous students) to infiltrate Tanathras. Falious, without knowing the truth about Trothas men, followed their instructions to the intended spot. For Trothas, everything went to plan as he cast a disintegrate spell at the mythallar of Tanathras, causing Falious enclave to plummet into the Dagger Mountains.
