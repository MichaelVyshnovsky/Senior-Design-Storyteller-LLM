        "mainbody": "'''Guthbert Golthammer''' was the [[Zhent]]-appointed constable of [[Dagger Falls]] in the late 1360s [[DR]], before the dale's liberation in [[1369 DR]].",
        "History": "Guthbert was an ox-brained warrior but a member of both the [[Zhentarim]] and the [[Zhentilar]]. He started as a military commander of [[Teshwave]], where he was ''circa'' [[1356 DR]], winning his position through the influence of his father, [[Elzund Golthammer]].\n\n''Circa'' 1369 DR, Guthbert was the constable of Dagger Falls.\n\nIn 1369 DR, he was involved in the kidnapping of Randal Morn himself under orders of the Zhent [[wizard]] [[Ilthond]]. In the end, the situation went bad for the Zhentarim and the Freedom Riders attacked the town, defeating the Zhent soldiers.",
        "Personality": "Guthbert was an amiable fellow, fearless in battle, but was very slow in thinking. Thus he usually had with him a more capable second-in-command, such as the [[cleric]] [[Asdag]] in Teshendale and the fighter [[Toren]] in Daggerdale."
