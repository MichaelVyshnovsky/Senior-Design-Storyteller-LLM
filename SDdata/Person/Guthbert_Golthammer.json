        "mainbody": "Guthbert Golthammer was the Zhent-appointed constable of Dagger Falls in the late 1360s DR, before the dales liberation in 1369 DR.\nGuthbert was an ox-brained warrior but a member of both the Zhentarim and the Zhentilar. He started as a military commander of Teshwave, where he was circa 1356 DR, winning his position through the influence of his father, Elzund Golthammer.\nCirca 1369 DR, Guthbert was the constable of Dagger Falls.\nIn 1369 DR, he was involved in the kidnapping of Randal Morn himself under orders of the Zhent wizard Ilthond. In the end, the situation went bad for the Zhentarim and the Freedom Riders attacked the town, defeating the Zhent soldiers.\nGuthbert was an amiable fellow, fearless in battle, but was very slow in thinking. Thus he usually had with him a more capable second-in-command, such as the cleric Asdag in Teshendale and the fighter Toren in Daggerdale."
