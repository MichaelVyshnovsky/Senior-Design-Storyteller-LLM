        "mainbody": "Ruinlord '''Asdag''' was the head of internal security and head torturer of the [[Zhentarim]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Asdag was a cold and cruel person.",
        "History": "Asdag was a cleric, first as a High Priest of [[Bane]],, and later of [[Iyachtu Xvim]], always following his master, [[Fzoul Chembryl]].\n\nAround [[1367 DR]], he was the adviser of [[Guthbert Golthammer]], military commander of [[Teshwave]], but in truth he directed Guthbert's decisions, being the real lord of the dale.\n\nLater, Asdag was transferred to [[Zhentil Keep]], where he assumed a position as head of internal security, just under Fzoul. He used this position to spy inside Xvim's clergy, on Lord [[Orgauth]], and other power groups in the city for his master.",
        "Description": "Asdag was a fat and tall man with a preference for black dress with crimson cloaks. He cultivated this look in order to inspire an air of evil power.",
        "Relationships": "In his days in Teshwave, Asdag often found it incredibly easy to manipulate the slow-witted mind of Guthbert. However, Guthbert considered him a loyal advisor.\n\nOn the other hand, Asdag was loyal to Fzoul."
