        "Description": "Merlot had a habit of eating [[grape]]s grown at the winery{{Cite organized play/LC/Before Its Time|13}} and because of that, it was named after a variety of [[wine]] from [[Cormyr]].",
        "History": "Merlot and its fellow stray mutt [[Wander]] found their way to the Morden Winery sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1370}}. The digs were fed and taken care of by the winery's inhabitants – [[medusa]] [[Samanthiss]] and her [[maedar]] mate – [[Vorlon]]. Eventually, the strays became loyal guard dogs for the couple and could often be found patrolling the winery, along with other creatures that defended it. Their keen sense of smell allowed for early intruder detection, and loud barking alerted the maedar and the medusa."
