'''Djarrus Gost''' was a [[Nobility of Waterdeep|nobleman]] of [[Gost|House Gost]] in the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He also served as the silent patron of the [[Foes of the Fang]], an adventuring company dedicated to the eradication of [[vampire]]s within the civilization of [[the North]].

==Description==
Djarrus had short blond hair and beard with fair skin. He was said to always have a "worried" look about him. He typically wore the latest Waterdhavian fashions over his slender build.

==Activities==
Djarrus was  a hunter of vampires throughout the North. He hired many sages to gather any information they could about the vampires infecting the cities of the [[Lords' Alliance|Lords Alliance]] and fed this information to his half-sister, Corrina Lathankin and the [[Foes of the Fang]].

Unbeknownst to any of the Foes's members, aside from [[Corinna Lathankin|Corinna]] and her husband, [[Jandar Ilbaereth]], Djarrus donated money and other resources to the Foes of the Fang. In addition, he provided them with information regarding the activities of a number of vampire groups that operated in the North.

He also donated much of the Gost family fortune to the Church of [[Lathander]] whom Corinna and Jandar were also members of the [[Order of the Aster]] sect of the church.

Even Djarrus' closest friends and family did not know that he had been ''[[Charm person|charmed]]'', and had been provided information about rival vampires by the Master Vampire of Waterdeep, [[Artor Morlin]] who was also in the guise of the Gost family's seneschal, Delinth Oberlin.
