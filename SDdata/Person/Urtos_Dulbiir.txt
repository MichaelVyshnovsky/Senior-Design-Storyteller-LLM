Urtos Dulbiir was the owner and namesake for the popular shop in Arabel called Dulbiirs in 1368 DR.
In addition to providing a splendid array of costumes for his clients, Urtos also allowed them to rent costumed escorts to complete their ensemble.
Urtos also allowed voyeurs to witness his patrons "playacting" from the safety of specially shadow-screened rooms. He charged 5 gold pieces per hour for this feature.
