'''Urtos Dulbiir''' was the owner and namesake for the popular shop in [[Arabel]] called [[Dulbiir's]] in [[1368 DR]].

==Activities==
In addition to providing a splendid array of costumes for his clients, Urtos also allowed them to rent costumed escorts to complete their ensemble.

Urtos also allowed voyeurs to witness his patrons "playacting" from the safety of specially [[shadow screen|shadow-screened]] rooms. He charged 5 [[gold piece]]s per hour for this feature.
