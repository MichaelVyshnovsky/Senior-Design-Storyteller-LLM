==Personality==
Dermod Ophal was extremely snobbish, and dismissive of those lacking social status. The married couple would loudly whisper about an appearance of anyone who approached them, deciding where they were from and what status and wealth they had.

==Activities==
Lady and Lord Dermod Ophal were regular patrons of [[Waukeen's Promenade]] in the [[Athkatla/Center District|Center District]] of Athkatla. They sat atop a large wooden platform surveying the wonders of the marketplace without resorting to speaking to the lesser people that conducted business within.

==History==
Both Lady and Lord Ophal were active in Waukeen's Promenade around the time a great magical battle between the [[Cowled Wizards]] and unlicensed [[spellcaster]]s—the cruel [[archmage]] [[Jon Irenicus]] and [[Imoen]]—destroyed a section of the amphitheater, in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.
