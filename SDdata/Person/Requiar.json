        "History": "In {{YearlinkConvert|2436|NY}}, the hard-hearted Requiar took over the Netherese enclave of [[Shadowtop Borough]] (also known as Aquessir) by force, killing over thirty of its [[arcanist]]s in the process. The enclave's first archwizard, [[Trebbe]], had died many centuries earlier in [[-2237 DR|1622 NY (-2237 DR)]] while working on the ''[[Crown of Horns]]'' there. Rediscovering the infamous artefact, Requiar equipped the ''Crown'' and used it to rule Shadowtop Borough until {{YearlinkConvert|2651|NY}}. By this time, the ''Crown'' had driven Requiar mad, leading to his overthrow by other arcanists. The ''Crown of Horns'' then disappeared, although it would later return to take its revenge on Shadowtop Borough."
