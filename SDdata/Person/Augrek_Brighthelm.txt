Augrek Brighthelm was a deputy in Bryn Shander sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Usually, Augrek was found at the southwest gate of the city, where she welcomed all visitors with a well-rehearsed speech about the wonders of Bryn Shander.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Augrek was at the gate when giants attacked the city.
Augrek had a good heart. She truly wanted to protect her city. She also loved Sheriff Markham Southwell.
