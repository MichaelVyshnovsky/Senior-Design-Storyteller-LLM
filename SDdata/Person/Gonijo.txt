'''Gonijo''' was the emperor of [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Gonijo became emperor in [[1352 DR]] when his father [[Gokammu]] retired. His life was completely directed by counselors of the [[Takenaka clan]] and the [[Hojo clan]]. He only needed to sign the edicts made by the counselors and perform the traditional rituals to ensure the welfare of the state.

==Personality==
Gonijo cared nothing for the state's affairs. He would gladly resign and enter a monastery but he did not yet have an heir, so this was an impossible dream for the time being.
