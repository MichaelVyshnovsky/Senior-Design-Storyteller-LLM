        "mainbody": "His Imperial Altitude Eldebuck Thorm Fendarl, self-styled High Knight-Emperor of the Vale, was the ruler of the village of Fendarls Gate in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe was the four-times-great grandson of the villages founder, the warrior Fendarl.\nEldebuck was supremely petty and pompous, as his chosen titles showed. He required everyone to address him as \"Imperial Altitude\", and punished those who forgot by confiscating all their goods and imprisoning them for a tenday. He was also an immense gourmand who insisted everyone else finish all their meals too.\nNaturally he was short and fat as well.\nHe occupied the small castle in the village, which he called the Imperial Palace, where around 1366 DR he spent his time in near-day-long feasts and commanded a grand army of only fourteen knights. It doubled as the villages inn, since Eldebuck forbade the building of an actual inn or tavern and also charged handsomely for the privilege of sharing a roof with the High Knight-Emperor. The \"personal guests\" who paid or were invited by Eldebuck, his knights, and select villagers were treated to dishes whether they wanted them or not, so at mealtimes villagers would claim to be \"too busy in the fields\" and knights engaged in training or falcon hunting, lest food be delivered to them on Eldebucks orders whilst they stood guard.\nAt highsun, he inspected his subjects and guests, when he insisted everyone eat all their highsunfeast meals, thank the villages abundance, and sing his cooks praises, while he boasted of Fendarls heroism with the same tales each day. The local folk wisely smiled and answered with enthusiasm without fail.\nhe toured at highsun, when he insisted everyone eat all their meals, thank the villages abundance, and sing his cooks praises, while he boasted of Fendarls heroism with the same tales each day. The local folk wisely did so without fail. Eldebuck required everyone to address him as \"Imperial Altitude\", and punished those who forgot by confiscating all their goods and imprisoning them for a tenday.\nOne eveningfeast, a visiting mage pranked Eldebuck by having a roast, stuffed stag head on a platter animate via an audible glamer and complain to his Imperial Altitude about its death, butchery, and poor treatment in the kitchen. Afterward, this dish was not served again."
