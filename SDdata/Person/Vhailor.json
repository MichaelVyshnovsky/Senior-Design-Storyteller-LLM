This was a trap however, as he ended up being magically imprisoned within one of the dungeon's cells.

        "Description": "After untold years of magical imprisonment, all that remained of Vhailor was his armor and great axe, all covered in dents and rust. The red, piercing eyes glowing bright red from within his helmet were the only indicator that the armor actually held a soul within it.",
        "Personality": "Vhailor was the embodiment of Mercykiller ideals and values. He was zealous, relentless, and merciless and would go to any length to deliver a sentence for wrongdoings committed in all the [[planes]], which was his life's calling. His belief in the power of Justice (which he viewed as a tangible source of power) was so strong that it allowed his soul to go past the weakness of his body and merge with the armor of his faction.",
