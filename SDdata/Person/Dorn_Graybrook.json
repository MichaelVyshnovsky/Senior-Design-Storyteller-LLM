        "mainbody": "'''Dorn Graybrook''' was a [[human]] [[half-golem|half]]–[[iron golem]] adventurer who became involved in the events of the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]].",
        "Description": "Dorn was a big person, but most of his left side was made up of metal plates and parts grafted on by the wizard who owned him when he was a boy, and this only contributed to his fearsome look. His iron limbs were thicker than his human ones; his metal arm had clawed talons and knuckle spikes. He had a single shock of black hair, and an iron half-mask.{{cite book/The Rage|8|1}}.",
        "Personality": "Since he was nine, Dorn had come to delight in the killing of dragons. He had largely been shaped by violence, cruelty, and sorrow.{{cite book/The Rage|9|1}}.\n\nGrinning or laughing made him feel self-conscious.{{cite book/The Rage|62|4}}. He was quick to take offense at imagined slights, though he had enough self-control and mindfulness to take responsibility for that.{{cite book/The Rage|92|5}}. He was uncomfortable with participating in events of too big an epic scope.{{cite book/The Rage|224|15}}\n\nAs a child, Dorn loved to swim.{{cite book/The Rage|307|20}} Dorn had not sang since the day his parents died.{{cite book/The Rite|44|1}}",
        "Relationships": "He eventually romanced [[Karasendrieth]]. He had become Kara's lover by Eleint 12.{{cite book/The Ruin|19|1}}\n\nHe prayed to [[Malar]], the Beastlord, who was foremost in his mind.",
        "Abilities": "Unlike other half-golems, Dorn had no ability to breathe deadly gases, but he was much more limber than others, being perfectly capable of running. He was also a very keen specialist, knowing the weaknesses of dragons well enough to exploit them in a fight.\n\nHe claimed to understand [[Draconic]].{{cite book/The Rage|38|3}}.",
        "Possessions": "Dorn's usual equipment included a powerful enchanted [[bastard sword]] and [[studded leather armor]], an enchanted [[composite longbow]], and a full complement of enchanted [[arrow]]s. He also bore two arrows of superior enchantment, which were the bane of [[dragon]]s. Finally, he carried a few potions of healing, and of protection against [[acid]] and [[fire]]. His metal claws also bore a powerful enchantment.\n\nAs of 1373 DR, one of his arrows was enchanted to slay wyrms outright; he had acquired it in 1368 DR.{{cite book/The Rage|49|4}}",
        "History": {
            "Year of Rogue Dragons": "On [[Hammer 23]], after hunting an [[ooze drake]]{{cite book/The Rage|40|3}} that broke his sword,{{cite book/The Rage|43|3}} Dorn Graybrook and his party learned of a flight of dragons rising to attack Ylraphon.{{cite book/The Rage|45|3}}. By early [[Hammer 24]], the town had been razed, and his band agreed to accompany Kara to Lyrabar in a ship.{{cite book/The Rage|60|3}} Along the way, they spotted signs of another flight of dragons, and began suspecting a full-blown Rage of dragons.{{cite book/The Rage|67|4}} Further evidence mounted as they spotted more destroyed coastal settlements;{{cite book/The Rage|89|6}} during the trip, they were approached by a flight of silver dragons, the first ones Dorn's band had ever seen.{{cite book/The Rage|100|6}} The two dragons, [[Moonwing]] and [[Azhaq]], were looking for Kara, who they explained, was actually a [[song dragon]] named Karasendrieth, whom they intended to take back with them.{{cite book/The Rage|103|6}} Dorn struck at the dragons rather than yield Karasendrieth;{{cite book/The Rage|104|6}} though the ensuing fight led to two casualties amongst the crew, Dorn's team ultimately prevailed.{{cite book/The Rage|110|6}} Kara afterwards explained that a Rage was underway, and the [[gold dragon]] king [[Lareth]] expected it to be one of the worst;{{cite book/The Rage|138|10}} the party, against Graybrook's instincts, chose to aid Kara in finding [[Helder Gorstag]] in [[Lyrabar]].{{cite book/The Rage|140|10}}\n\nIn Lyrabar, Will and Pavel consulted Gorstag Helder's landlady, [[Mureene]], about him. After bribing and threatening her, they learned that his room was ransacked by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and then by Mureene herself; Pavel determined, and Mureene confirmed, that Gorstag was taking instruction as a swordsman.{{cite book/The Rage|156-159|12}} \n\nThe whole party met with Brimstone at his lair, learning he was a [[smoke drake]].{{cite book/The Rage|177|12}} After a brief battle with Brimstone, who was possessed by Sammaster's notes while trying to read them, the vampiric wyrm bade them to attack the Cult of the Dragon and find clues; over Dorn's opposition, the party agreed.{{cite book/The Rage|188-189|12}}. On the evening of [[Ches 14]], the party protected Taegan Nightwind, who set himself out as bait for the Cult by pretending to be drowning his sorrows in too much alcohol.{{cite book/The Rage|193-196|13}} They afterwards interrogated one of the cultists that they captured, learning that the cult hid in a dungeon beneath a tannery.{{cite book/The Rage|198|13}} After a fight, they captured the [[Wearer of Purple]] [[Cylla Morieth]] and managed to learn of Sammaster's plans for the Rage.{{cite book/The Rage|206|13}}\n\nTaegan Nightwind agreed to petition Queen Sambryl to send warriors to fight the Cult of the Dragon close to Lyrabar, to which she ultimately agreed.{{cite book/The Rage|236-237|16}} Dorn, Kara, and the others instead left for [[Elmwood]], which they found to be under [[Zhentarim]] occupation.{{cite book/The Rage|240|17}} After the fight, they joined [[Thoyanna Jorgadaul]] and other authorities from town in a small grove to which a small bird led them.{{cite book/The Rage|249|17}} There, after learning of the Zhentarim activities through the area, they decided to break their control over the town, blaming dragons for any damage.{{cite book/The Rage|254|17}} During their following raid, Dorn managed to secure a craft.{{cite book/The Rage|278|18}} They took the craft to Thentia, and then to Northkeep, where they were joined by [[Chatulio]].{{cite book/The Rage|330|22}} After days of searching, they finally located a number of reliefs that showed the origins of the Rage.{{cite book/The Rage|339|22}}\n\nThe Cult of the Dragon ambushed Rangrim, however, and employed magic to strike the Queen's Bronzes mad with the Rage of Dragons.{{cite book/The Rage|264|18}} Though Rangrim and Taegan managed to slay the metallic dragons in their midst, the wyrms caused enough damage to rout the entire expedition.{{cite book/The Rage|269|18}}. He remained in flight from the cult's forces through [[13 Tarsakh]], when Jivex saved him;{{cite book/The Rage|286-288|19}} on the small fairy dragon's advice, Taegan rested in a circle of trees, that were also guardians of the forest, elves from yore.{{cite book/The Rage|290|19}} After they healed him, Taegan reasoned he should rally the Warswords; the faerie dragons, through Jivex, volunteered to gather the forces, while the trees volunteered that a guardian dragon remained, which Taegan might be able to rouse.{{cite book/The Rage|296-298|19}} He roused the guardian [[Vorasaegha]] successfully, albeit with some difficulty.{{cite book/The Rage|304-305|20}} However, during the siege of the Cult hideout, her strength ran out while fighting a dracolich.{{cite book/The Rage|327|21}} Taegan and Jivex managed to slay the wyrm, however narrowly.{{cite book/The Rage|335|22}} Taegan looted some of the wealth of the enclave, returning to Lyrabar with Jivex for Greengrass.{{cite book/The Rage|341-342|E}}\n\nOn 19 Mirtul, Kara, Dorn, Chatulio and Raryn came across the retinue of Josef Darag, from Springhill, who were retreating from the front after learning of King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s fall. They also learned that there was a village under attack by bandits, to which they went afterwards.{{cite book/The Rite|35|1}}. He managed to calm down Kara with some attempts at song after her blood was too inflamed from fighting during a Rage.{{cite book/The Rite|64|3}} \n\nOn Mirtul 27, dorn Graybrook and Karasendrieth's team managed to make it through the tunnels beneath the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]], slaying the dragons beneath the monastery in the process. Arriving at the monastery, they were able to explain the situation to [[Cantoule]] and request he heal [[Karasendrieth]], who was injured in the crossing.{{cite book/The Rite|117|5}} The Monastery of the Yellow Rose changed tactics against the wyrms under Dorn's guidance on Kythorn 2, where they retreated into the halls and set up a trap, which killed at least one of Malazan's flight.{{cite book/The Rite|127|6}} Dorn was attacked by Kara when her resolve waned against the rage, but forgiving her, he managed to harden her resolve.{{cite book/The Rite|135|6}}\n\nDorn Graybrook accompanied Kara to the Galenas on 5 Flamerule, soon after her discovery of the process to block the Rage.{{cite book/The Rite|257|12}} They found the hidden sanctuary in the [[Galenas]] on 8 Flamerule; though [[Tamarand]] was able to convince [[Lareth]] to listen, Lareth was indifferent to her tale and wanted to kill her, prompting Tamarand to challenge him for the throne of King of Justice.{{cite book/The Rite|270|12}} After Tamarand slew Lareth, he decided a number of fast fliers would be sent to break the siege at the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]].{{cite book/The Rite|278|12}}\n\nBy Midsummer, Dorn's party had returned to Thentia, and Rilitar had died, but considerable progress had been made in decoding Sammaster's notes.{{cite book/The Rite|329-333|E}}\n\nOn Eleint 12, Taegan and Jivex had rejoined Dorn's party, and taken to exploring the steppes of ancient [[Narfell]], following Sammaster's explorations. Despite carrying a token of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s favor, they were attacked by a Far Quey raiding party.{{cite book/The Ruin|14|1}} Afrer a conversation with the Far Quey, they learned of the [[Hermit]].{{cite book/The Ruin|35|1}} The Hermit related upon Dorn's party that it had realized, during the first Rage, that the elves had built a citadel in Novularond, but knew little beyond that.{{cite book/The Ruin|57|2}}\n\nAt the Novularonds, his party became guests of Raryn's tribe, in particular his brother Wurik, who poisoned them to deliver them upon Iyraclea; when the Queen's servants arrived, they slew Wurik for trying to hide his brother Raryn.{{cite book/The Ruin|79|3}} On 27 Marpenoth, Dorn's party, pushed by Iyraclea, arrived at a citadel in Novularond.{{cite book/The Ruin|116-117|6}} Later that night, Zethrindor arrived with Brimstone, and attacked Iyraclea, considering she had broken faith with Sammaster.{{cite book/The Ruin|122-123|6}} After a fight in which Zethrindor's spell appeared to annihilate Karasendrieth, Dorn had to be talked out of a suicide attack against the dragon; instead, they escaped in the commotion.{{cite book/The Ruin|135|6}}\n\nIn 8 Uktar, after nearly sneaking out in the morning, dorn noticed several people in white clothes attempt to ambush his comrades in their sleep. Those were warriors of Sossal; dorn stopped them long enough for Pavel to defuse the situation.{{cite book/The Ruin|161|7}} dorn, after Kara's death, became so despondent he nearly deserted his companions.{{cite book/The Ruin|170|7}} The lot of them joined Stival Chergoba's forces briefly. On Uktar 16, Zethrindor maneuvered his dragons to block Stival Chergoba's forces from joining Madislak Pemsk's, and pincer the latter's,{{cite book/The Ruin|196-198|8}} after Stival Chergoba's group ran into his main force.{{cite book/The Ruin|191-193|8}}\n\nOn Uktar 17, they made it to Madislak Pemsk's group ahead of Zethrindor's army.{{cite book/The Ruin|203-205|9}} Once battle was joined, Will and dorn fought a tundra landwyrm; during the fighting, Will Turnstone had an idea, and with Jivex's help, he reached the enemy commanders under Zethrindor and informed them that Iyraclea had been killed by Zethrindor.{{cite book/The Ruin|223-226|9}} Zethrindor, upon noticing, decided to confirm it.{{cite book/The Ruin|228-229|9}} Zethrindor accepted a challenge from Will Turnstone to fight dorn's party and Madislak Pemsk, wagering that the losing party's army would surrender, advised that if he chose to forfeit the challenge, he would look weak. He accepted.{{cite book/The Ruin|238-239|10}} Ultimately, albeit Zethrindor slew Madislak Pemsk,{{cite book/The Ruin|244|10}} and may have slain dorn's group, the ice giants in his army struck at him, sensing weakness, and destroyed him;{{cite book/The Ruin|247|10}} even the dragons in his army chose to flee after his death.{{cite book/The Ruin|248|10}}\n\ndorn and his party returned just in time for their meeting on the Feast of the Moon. The meeting was attended by a number of dragons, including Nexus, Tamarand, Azhaq, Moonwing, LLimark, Wardancer, Vingdavalac, and the Talons of Justice, amongst other dragons, and the wizards of Thentia, amongst them Firefingers, Scattercloak, darvin Kordeion, Sureene Aumratha, Baerimel, and Jannatha Goldenshield. With no other ideas, the metallic dragons and the wizards of Thentia attempted a Grand divination; the ritual failed, instead leading to the death of [[Moonwing]].{{cite book/The Ruin|257-261|11}} Pavel Shemov finally proposed attempting to use Brimstone's hoard near Lyrabar as a focus for contacting Brimstone's necklace and Brimstone himself, under the assumption the drake had made it through the gate.{{cite book/The Ruin|264-265|11}}\n\nKara finally lost her battle to Sammaster's rage on 5 Nightal, when she attacked her companions for trying to stop her from suicidally striking at the tarterian wyrms in the valley, believing she'd kill them if she didn't kill herself. Brimstone decided to stop her, kill her, and slake his thirst by drinking her blood.{{cite book/The Ruin|270-273|12}} They were stopped by the sudden arrival of the tarterians, and then by the metallic wyrms that had teleported themselves through Brimstone's hoard in Lyrabar.{{cite book/The Ruin|277-278|12}} After defeating the tarterians, the dragons and mages there managed to break through Sammaster's ward.{{cite book/The Ruin|283|12}} His friends had never seen dorn cry until 5 Nightal.{{cite book/The Ruin|282|12}}\n\nOn 6 Uktar, Sammaster was at the same hidden redoubt as Ssalangan, where he broke off a battle between him and Chuth.{{cite book/The Ruin|287|12}} He was notified by an enchantment when his twisted space spell was broken by Larendrammagar and others, and teleporting himself with his staff, he recognized many of the assailants at his fortress, including [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]], the wizards of Thentia, and some dragons.{{cite book/The Ruin|288|12}} He called upon pacts with a number of wyrms from other planes to defend the ''dracorage mythal''.{{cite book/The Ruin|289|12}} Graybrook was critical to fighting the dragons, losing his metal limbs but managing to break one of Sammaster's spells,{{cite book/The Ruin|330|13}}\n\nThough dorn took the loss of his limbs heavily after the battle, Kara didn't let him dwell on that, and suggested that either Firefingers, Nexus, Sureene or the others would repair his body.{{cite book/The Ruin|338-339|E}}"
