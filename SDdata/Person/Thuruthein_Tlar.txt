'''Thuruthein Tlar''' was a trainee [[Red Wizard of Thay]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Thuruthein was one of the many apprentices of the wise Red Wizard [[Orth Lantar]], whom Tlar truly respected.

==History==
Thuruthein trained under Orth Lantar.

In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, he, his master, and other apprentices including [[Prestym]] and [[Iyrit]], went to [[Myth Drannor]] to search for magical treasures. There, however, he met the [[Rangers Three]].

However, the sudden attack of a [[malaugrym]] convinced Tlar to join the Rangers in their battle against the monsters.
