'''Velkora Ashenwell''' was a [[dwarf]] mason and acolyte of [[Moradin]] in [[Elturel]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
After Elturel was transported to [[Avernus]], first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], in the {{YearlinkName|1494}}, many quakes struck the city and three dwarves—Velkora Ashenwell, [[Kartra Boulderstern]], and [[Strovin Ironfist]]—became trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building. If they were lucky, they may have been rescued by passing adventurers.
