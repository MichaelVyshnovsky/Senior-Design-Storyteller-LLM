She deduced that they were gathering treasures for the Hoard of the Dragon Queen and boarded a caravan full of hidden cultists that transported parts of the hoard to the final destination. During the journey, Jamna killed a too-curious cultist disguised as a caravan guard.\nAfter the assassination, adventurers could discover Jamna and needed to decide what do with her. She would potentially offer her help against their common enemy."
