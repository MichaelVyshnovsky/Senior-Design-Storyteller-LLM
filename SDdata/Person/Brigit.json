She had golden hair.\nAs captain of the Sisters of Synnoria, she commanded, among other Llewyrr, Maura, Carina and Aileen.\nAs part of the tradition in which the Sisters of Synnoria became pledged for a years service to a person of royal birth who rode Avalon, Brigit put her group at the orders of Tristan Kendrick and the defense of Caer Corwell."
