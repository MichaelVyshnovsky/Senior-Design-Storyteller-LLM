He was a [[butcher]] and owner of [[Haldos's Fine Butchery]].\n\nAround [[1369 DR]], Haldos kept his business in the center of Wheloon, to the irritation of his neighbors, though few dared to complain to him about the noise of slaughter. He was a very big man, with a spade-shaped beard.\n\nHe was one of the few butchers who could slaughter a beast on the spot and provide the freshest possible meat.",
