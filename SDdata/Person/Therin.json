Pinch would easily sacrifice him if the situation required.\nTherin was a Gur in Elturel. He was working as a \"stooge for a fortune-teller\" when Pinch recruited him. He suffered many scars from a hangman before the gang saved him. Therin was one of the thieves that followed his boss back to Ankhapur to regain his body.\nBy 1370 DR, Therin had established his own thieves guild, the Bloody Scarves, within the city."
