Tenshorn Hawklin was a member of the Hawklin noble family of Cormyr in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was also secretly a member of the Men of the Basilisk.
He was the younger brother of the familys patriarch, Barandos Hawklin, and not as well known.
Tenshorn joined his brother Barandos on a number of his expeditions into the Hullack Forest and the Stonelands, which were sponsored by the Cormyrean crown. However, while Barandos became a star at the Royal Court, Tenshorn could never make the acquaintance of King Azoun IV, owing to rumors about his cruelty. Resentful of this, Barandos gladly joined the Men of the Basilik when given the chance.
With Barandos away at court, Tenshorn managed much of the Hawklin investments, which were funded largely by adventuring gains and were quite profitable. He feigned friendship and fealty in order to maintain Barandoss trust. While he once considered doing away with him, Tenshorn preferred his anonymity and behind-the-scenes role in the family.
