'''Randolph dul Umast''' was a [[human]] [[priest]] of [[Tymora]] and the high priest at [[The Lady's Favor]] temple in the [[hamlet]] of [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When the temple of The Lady's Favor was built in the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], Randolph dul Umast was appointed its first high priest He demonstrated himself to be a wise and capable leader of the local priesthood.

Around [[Kythorn]] of the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], a convoy secretly transported the ''[[torque of faith]]'', a holy item of [[Tymora]], to The Lady's Favor. However, the [[Vipers]] gang of bandits attacked the convoy, massacred its guardians, and looted its wealth, including the torque. The Tymorans in Procampur were outraged and Randolph hired the ranger [[Dura Gerathu]] to locate the [[Vipers' Nest]].

On [[Eleint 1]] in 1369 DR, one of the hamlet's wells was poisoned, killing a few villagers and sickening twenty-two more. The priests of Tymora treated them but found that their magic could do nothing to identify or cure the poison, and they were forced to rely on non-magical treatments. Randolph ''[[commune]]d'' with Tymora for advice and then sought [[adventurer]]s to seek the poison's ingredients or a cure, and return the ''torque of faith'' if they should find it.As [[Dungeon magazine 75|"Into the Nest of Vipers"]] is an adventure module, its conclusion is officially unresolved. Successful completion would see the PCs return with the antidote and the torque.
