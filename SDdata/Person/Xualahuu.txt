Xualahuu was a beholder that lived in the Zhentarim-controlled oasis of Olomaa in the Anauroch desert. 
Xualahuu was deeply loyal to Manshoon and tried to profit off all occasions to advance the Black Networks plots.
By 1358 DR, it had been seriously injured by some Harpers and lost the use of some of its eyestalks. Xualahuu retreated to Olomaa in order to regather strength.
