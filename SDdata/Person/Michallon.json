        "Activities": "Michallon led the constables of the branch and liaised with [[Karsus]] and his assistants. He was aided by his equally unscrupulous Underchiefs [[Bengel]], [[Ezeddeen]], [[Hacklander]], and [[Bias]], who managed the other constables directly. Michallon used his deadly spells and contacts in the criminal world to gain a position of power that straddled law and crime, using his constabulary to quash any criminal elements that threatened his dark allies. His Underchiefs kept loyalty out of a mixture of fear and greed, and together they engendered a sense of awe and respect among the junior constables, who thought that their commanders were truly upstanding and heroic people, Michallon most of all."
