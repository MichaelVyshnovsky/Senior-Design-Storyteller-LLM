        "mainbody": "zorsh (pronounced with a click followed by \"zzorshhh\") was a sea elf ranger dwelling in the Trackless Sea.\nXzorsh was a ranger who was quite curious and relatively open-minded. He always had an interest in the arcane arts, but because of his background was never able to develop that interest.\nHrolf, captain of the Elfmaid, saved Xzorshs life when he was a child. From that point forward, Xzorsh pledged to protect the Elfmaid and all of her crew to the best of his ability. He was particularly involved in this promise in 1361 DR, when the Elfmaid was being pursued by the Kraken Society of Ascarle and by Rethnor of Luskan.\nXzorsh was killed in 1361 DR by a drow group seeking Liriel Baenre. Brindlor, disguised as a human, tricked Ibn into giving a silvery amulet to Xzorsh, thinking that it had to do with Liriels promise of magical tutelage. When he slipped it around his neck, he was teleported to an unknown location, where Brindlor and Gorlist were waiting for him. Still under the assumption that they were his tutors, he went with them willingly. After giving them some gems that would help them track Liriel down, they swiftly murdered him.\nSittl, another sea elf, was Xzorshs partner and close friend. He turned out to be a malenti (a mutated sahuagin appearing as a sea elf) working for Ascarle.\nDespite their very different backgrounds, Xzorsh and the drow mage Liriel Baenre developed a friendship of sorts while she was aboard the Elfmaid in 1361 DR. In exchange for his help, she promised to help him learn the ways of arcane magicâ€”a promise she quickly regretted, offering to set him up with a tutor instead."
