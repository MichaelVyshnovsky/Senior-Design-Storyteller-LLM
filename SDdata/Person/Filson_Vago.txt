{{quote|''The Lower City's a bloody warren. I'm surprised anyone can find their way around.''|Filson Vago}}

==Description==
Filson was a [[human]] man with sharp features, pale skin, and shaved head.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Filson Vago and his [[hin]] friend, [[Drana Hoyte]], were visiting the city of Baldur's Gate during the looming threat of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. Drana was convinced she knew how to navigate the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]], and was unwilling to accept that they were lost. Filson, on the other hand, was very aware of their situation but still needed help finding a way in the busy warrens of the Lower City.
