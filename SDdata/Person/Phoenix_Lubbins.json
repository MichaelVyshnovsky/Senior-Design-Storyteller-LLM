        "mainbody": "'''Phoenix Lubbins''' was a relative of one of the [[Gondian]] foundry workers who lived in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Phoenix was a [[gnome]] with a light skin tone and straight light brown hair.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a group of Gondians was put to work at the [[Steel Watch Foundry]] in Baldur's Gate against their will, forced into slave labor by Lord [[Enver Gortash]] and his [[Cultists of Bane]]. One of the two motivations for the slaves' compliance was the fact that the Gondians' family members were abducted and held hostage within the drowned [[Iron Throne headquarters]]. Phoenix Lubbins was among the cult's hostages. It was unknown if the hostages were rescued before the conclusion of the [[Absolute crisis]], or if the prison was flooded in retaliation for the foundry workers' uprising."
