'''Pagis Rhee''' was a member of the [[Harpers]] and the [[High Harper]] of the Cloakwood Chapter in the [[Cloakwood]] on the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Before the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Pagis Rhee was well acquainted with the High Harper of the nearby [[Baldur's Gate]] chapter, [[Jaheira]], as well as her wards. When Jaheira, alongside a group of Harpers, took off to the dreaded [[Shadow-cursed Lands]], aiming to stop the recently returned enemy General [[Ketheric Thorm]], the entire group seemingly disappeared without a word. [[Rion]], Jaheira's older [[High elf|high]] [[half-elven]] adoptive daughter, reached out to Pagis Rhee seeking an update or a comforting word. The High Harper of Cloakwood Chapter expressed utmost confidence in Jaheira and comforted Rion, saying her mother would be fine.
