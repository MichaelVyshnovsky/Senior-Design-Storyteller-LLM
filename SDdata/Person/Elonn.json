        "Description": "Elonn was a strong young man, in great physical shape.",
        "History": "In the middle of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, one of the [[wizard]]s from a local Red Wizard enclave, led by a woman named [[Hinnar]], began selling locals into slavery of her own initiative. This underling, [[Kizzaf]], disguised herself with a wig and [[charm]]ed victims to follow her out of town. Elonn and his companion Talf were two such victims and, after visiting a tavern one day, were seen following a \"long-haired woman\" from the town while laughing along with her. Kizzaf drugged Talf and Elonn and sold them to a [[Thay]]an merchant named [[Mahzed]]. Their fates are unknown."
