Quessahn Uthraebor is a warlock living in Waterdeep. Hundreds of years ago, she lived in the High Forest and was married to a deva named Jinnaoth IrGadohn but he was killed soon after their marriage. Quess studied at the House of Wonder in Waterdeep and also received tutelage from the Avolakia Briarbones. Many years later, she chanced upon a newer incarnation of Jinnaoth and they became friends although Jinnaoth didnt remember that they were married in one of his past lives. Quessahn helped Jinnaoth stop the ritual of the First Flensing which would have allowed the evil deity Asmodeus to enter Waterdeep.
