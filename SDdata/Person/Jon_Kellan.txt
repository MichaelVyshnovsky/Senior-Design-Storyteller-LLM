'''Jon Kellan''', the '''Gray Wolf''', was the leader of a mercenary company from [[Icewind Dale]] called the [[Wolf Pack]].

==Possessions==
Kellan famously owned an [[enchanted]] [[shield]] called ''[[Wolf Bite]]''.

==History==
Jon "Gray Wolf" Kellan hailed from the frozen region of Icewind Dale where he assembled his mercenary company, the Wolf Pack. Eventually, the mercenaries under his leadership moved from Icewind Dale to [[Waterdeep]] in search of gainful employment. The word of their battle ferocity reached the ears of one of the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] and they hired Jon Kellan and his troupe to perform a dangerous mission for the City of Splendors. That contact led the Pack to a conflict with the [[Zhentarim]]. They entered a fierce battle, outnumbered by the agents of the Black Network. When the fray was over, only three Zhents remained standing with all of the Pack, including the Gray Wolf himself - dead. Even though Kellan perished, his death led to the Black Network halting their plans of attacking Waterdeep, saving innocent lives.

Jon Kellan's presumed skeletal remains were found at the bottom of [[Eastern Farmlands]]'s foreboding hole, still clutching ''Wolf Bite'' in [[1372 DR]].
