By night however, he operated Hiyals black market that primarily sold all manner of intelligent creatures. These included everything from sentient exotic creatures, to hapless foreigners, to scared children captured by desert raiders.\nThe Sultana allowed Obok to operate his illicit venture so long as he promised to keep her own stock of slaves filled, which also included her sons harims, and to run his operation as quietly as possible. She promised to shut down his business should news of it ever reach the wrong ears."
