        "mainbody": "'''Susztam Mar-Shinn''' was a [[drow]] [[illusionist]] and [[shadow adept]]. He was the Head Student of the [[Inverted Tower]] and a user of the [[Shadow Weave]] in [[Szith Morcane]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century.",
        "Description": "Uncommonly for a [[drow]], Susztam appeared somewhat plump and seemed almost meek upon cursory inspection. He customarily wore dark shirts of grey and black [[trousers]]. Susztam wrapped himself in a spider-web patterned ''[[cloak of arachnida]]''.",
        "Personality": "Although appearing less hardened than others of his race, Susztam Mar-Shinn was just as malicious and ambitious as the rest of his kin. Testament to this was his dream of eventually surpassing and taking over from his master, [[Solom Ned'razak]], as [[archmage]] of the [[Inverted Tower]].",
        "Abilities": "Noted as Solom Ned'razak's best student, Susztam was a skilled [[illusionist]] and also a practitioner of the [[Shadow Weave]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1354}}, Susztam became the head student of the Inverted Tower under Solom Ned'razak's tutelage. At least until [[1372 DR]], during the [[Silence of Lolth]] and the coup of Szith Morcane by worshipers of [[Kiaransalee]], Susztam maintained this position through careful preparations against any intruders."
