        "mainbody": "Highlord '''Falaeve''' was the [[sun elf]] ruler of [[Siluvanede]] around the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|34-35}}",
        "Activities": "In keeping with Siluvanedenn haughtiness, Falaeve forbade all visitors to the realm, not even \"lesser\" races of [[elves]]. The Highlord made this point coldly clear to all. The only place he permitted other races was at the city of [[Lothen of the Silver Spires|Lothen]], where they came to consult the [[Aeltagarr]]. He was of course dismissive of the [[human]] realm of [[Athalantar]] and its [[magelord]]s.",
        "History": "In the [[224 DR|Year of the Flaming Forests, 224 DR]], a figure purporting to be Highlord Falaeve visited [[Morlin Castle]], at a feast hosted by Lord [[Breiyr]] and also attended by Axelord [[Arthlach]] of [[Ammarindar]] and a Herald of [[Tavaray]] known as Huntinghorn. Huntinghorn reported{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|33,37}} Yet Falaeve was strangely dubious and dismissive and tried covertly casting a spell. For that, Arthlach slew Falaeve, who was revealed to be Mage Royal [[Ubriien Orlyn]] of Athalantar in disguise, doubtless the one responsible for the attacks on Siluvanede. Huntinghorn, meanwhile, was in fact the adventuress [[Myrjala]] in magical disguise as well. The real Highlord Falaeve was never present.",
        "Description": "The false Falaeve displayed sharp elven features, large silver eyes, bronze skin, a hawkish nose, and hair that was long and golden-blond in hue; his expression was often haughty or sneering. He was tall and graceful. He wore a white silk long-sleeved shirt and an overtunic of gilden [[shimmerweave]], with [[bracers]] decorated with [[gem]]s and the silver griffon symbol of Siluvanede worked in gold wire, and kept his hair tied back tightly at the nape of his neck with a filigreed pin adorned with fine gems and the dazzle of [[spell]]s. It is unknown what of this disguise represented the real Highlord."
