Faeryl Zauvirr was the Ched Nasadan ambassador to Menzoberranzan from ca. 1358 DR to 1372 DR.
Faeryl was tall and thickly built. She wielded a magical adamantine rod that morphed into the Mothers Kiss warhammer and also carried a crossbow.
Faeryl served as ambassador to Menzoberranzan for fourteen years until 1372 DR.
In 1372 DR, caravans from Ched Nasad stopped arriving from outside the city. Faeryl approached Matron Mother Triel Baenre for permission to leave the city and investigate, but Triel, fearing that Faeryl would bring news of Menzoberranzans weakness due to the Silence of Lolth, would not let her leave. Faeryl tried to escape with her retainers, and, indeed, they made it past the citys gates before a Bregan Daerthe team led by Valas Hune captured them and returned them to Triel. Triel locked Faeryl up and gave her to her son Jeggred to play with. She was eventually released (Triel fabricated a cover story that said she had been attacked by brigands) and was assigned to travel to Ched Nasad with Quenthel Baenre, Jeggred, Pharaun Mizzrym, Ryld Argith, and Valas Hune in order to discover circumstances there.
Upon arriving in Ched Nasad, Faeryl betrayed Quenthel and Jeggred to her mother, Matron Mother Ssipriina Zauvirr, by taking them to the Black Claw Mercantile Company and allowing them to be captured by House Zauvirr. She also tortured Quenthel in revenge for Jeggred torturing her.
Faeryl was ultimately tortured and eaten alive by Jeggred during the destruction of Ched Nasad, when Phaeraun Mizzrym, Ryld Argith, Valas Hune, Halisstra and Danifae rescued him and Quenthel from the torture dungeon.
Faeryl was the daughter of Matron Mother Ssipriina Zauvirr. She was Fourth Daughter of House Zauvirr in 1372 DR. She had a brother named Gruherth Zauvirr.
