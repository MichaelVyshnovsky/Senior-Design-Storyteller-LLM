Basem bin Rumi was a gnome alchemist and researcher living in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Basem was a friendly fellow who was easily distracted by fantasies. His sense of humor made adventuring with Basem a pleasure. He was also incredibly resourceful under stress.
Fashion was important to Basem. He always dressed himself in fine silks and a gold-colored fez.
Driven by what some considered a foolish pursuit, Basem spent much of his fortune attempting to discover a way to turn metals such as lead or copper into gold. His home was littered with large mechanical water clocks while he tried to discover new methods of making them more efficient.
Basem resorted to adventuring any time his funds ran low. He also sold magical potions to other adventurers.
Basem settled in Huzuz after a successful career spent adventuring on the Crowded Sea as captain of a sambuk.
Basem owned a pair of bracers of defense AC 5, a ring of water walking, a  wand of fear, a bag of holding and a multitude of magical potions.
