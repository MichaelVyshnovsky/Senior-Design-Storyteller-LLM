Unfortunately, the young elf and his fellow members of the rear guard were ambushed by [[human]]s from [[Vaasa]] they were hunting down. While the elven guards eventually apprehended the intruders, Louenghris suffered a blow to the head and was knocked unconscious.\n\nThe contingent of tomb guards was decimated after a few of the elves wandered behind the [[Sharn Wall]] and drew the attention of a [[phaerimm]]. Louenghris was among the elves killed that day."
