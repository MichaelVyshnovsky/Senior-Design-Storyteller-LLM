'''Kogi''' was a [[Winter Sect]] monk in [[Nakamaru]] around [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Kogi was a good instructor at the monastery. Often, he secretly went out with his friend [[Bupposo]].

==History==
Kogi and his friend Bupposo wanted to play a prank against the [[Tsuyoi-no-kami]] monks: they paid [[Ichi (korobokuru)|Ichi]] the [[korobokuru]] [[yakuza]] to find a girl who could seduce the rival monks. So the young maiden [[O-Shino]], acting under the orders of the monks, tempted [[Anchin]] and [[Kaian]].

==Personality==
Kogi liked his work as an instructor. Kogi was an easy-going guy, friendly to all who met him. He knew that his irresistible taste for mischief made him a failure as a monk and he lamented that it would keep him from reaching spiritual perfection but it also made his life more interesting. He did not care for his [[spirit]] heritage.
