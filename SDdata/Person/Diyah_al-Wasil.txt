Diyah had oily skin that marred his complexion. Despite looking like a scoundrel, he was completely loyal to Huzuz and the Grand Caliph.
Diyahs competency was complimented by his thoroughness, making him a perfect tax collector.
Diyah was responsible for the collection of taxes and inspecting caravans passing through the Pilgrims Gate in Huzuz.
