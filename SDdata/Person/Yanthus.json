        "mainbody": "'''Yanthus''' was a loyal scribe to Lord [[Enver Gortash]] and later to General [[Ketheric Thorm]] and their leadership of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Under Enver Gortash's command, Yanthus penned a missive on the suspended [[ceremorphosis]] among the victims tadpoled by the [[elder brain]] that would become the [[Absolute]] after being enhanced by the [[Netherese]] magic of the ''[[Crown of Karsus]]'', as well as a report on the [[illithid]] [[Grand Design]]. After the discovery and implementation of the Absolute elder brain, Yanthus recorded, from Gortash's dictation, the lordling's plans and search for most unexpected allies, including finding the [[Temple of Bhaal (Undercity)|Temple of Bhaal]] in Baldur's Gate's [[Undercity]].\n\nYanthus penned numerous documents for Ketheric Thorm during his stay at the [[Moonrise Towers]] over the ruined town of [[Reithwin]]. The scribe documented, from Ketheric's dictation, an accord of his history with the [[druid]]s of the [[Emerald Grove]] and the [[Cloak Wood]] circles, with the only comment from the scribe being a coy smiling reaction to the General's plans to use [[Shadow Druids]] in dealing with the enemy circles. Another one of General's gambits dictated to Yanthus was using the life of a agent of Absolute named [[Xilvre]] in order to attract [[drow]] from [[Menzoberranzan]]'s [[House Baenre]] and impregnating them with the mind flayer parasites."
