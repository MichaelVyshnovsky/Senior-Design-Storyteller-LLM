        "mainbody": "Jalith was one of the two barmaids of the Copper Coronet, a rowdy tavern in the River District of Athkatla, in the late 14 century DR.\nJalith was a surprisingly cheerful well-endowed young woman. She lived in a run-down and dangerous district of Athkatla that made her utterly fearless in the face of danger, drunkards, or other troubles her occupation brought.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Jalith worked alongside Maerae at the Copper Coronet. Both women were paid exclusively in food and drink. The Copper Coronet worked them hard, and the only time they had to make actual coin was dawn-to-highsun â€“ their allotted sleeping time away from the tavern. As a way of income, Jalith was hired to run errands and perform various tasks during her off time. She did not fear getting down and dirty while performing hired labor and, occasionally, showed impressive acting skills when performing certain tasks disguised as a wealthy lady. Despite her tough life, Jalith showed no interest in cheating or swindling her clients for moral or self-preservation reasons."
