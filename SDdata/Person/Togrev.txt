Togrev the Magnificent was the so-called lord high commander of the armed forces of the Barony of Pundaria&mdashalthough this fact was disputed.
Togrev was a hairy half-ogre  His shoulders were massive, his neck thick and muscular, his fingernails black, and his odor&hellip unappealing&mdashas expected from his ogre side. Togrev wore his greasy black hair in a topknot and had an unshaven chin. He spoke with a deep, rumbling voice.
Togrev was fleeter of foot than one might expect for such a large man.
As revealed by magic, Togrev was an evil being.
Togrev fought with a greataxe with a  shaft. The axe head had slits that made it whistle in low moans when the weapon was whirled around.
His armor was a layer of leather, covered with a hauberk of tarnished metal scales.
Togrev rode a massive  horse that was as wide as a cart for carrying beer kegs.
In the , Togrev was in service to Baron Pundar, who had been appointed ruler of a barony within County Morninggold without knowledge of that countys then lord, Zaranda Star. Zaranda refuted the claim, which was made by Togrev and his men, when she encountered them pillaging a farmhouse and killing its residents under the guise of collecting taxes for the "baron". She challenged him to single combat, in exchange for the life of her traveling companion, Father Pelletyr, whom Togrev and his men had captured. Zaranda was victorious, and she slew the ogrish man with her saber Crackletongue.
