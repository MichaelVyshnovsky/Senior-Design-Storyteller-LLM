'''Maerglor''' was an evil mage who lived in [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] some time before [[1357 DR]].

Maerglor bought the ''[[Shadowtome]]'' from a band of [[hobgoblin]]s who'd killed the mage [[Azkhazan]] in the mountains north of [[Iriaebor]], giving them food, weapons, and quality armor in exchange. Later, Maerglor sold the book to [[Elminster]].
