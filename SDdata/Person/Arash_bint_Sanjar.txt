'''Arash bint Sanjar''' was a [[Grand Caliph]] of [[Zakhara]], ruling from the [[Enlightened Throne]] in the mid–7th century [[DR]]. He was the daughter of [[Sanjar]].<ref group="note">In both the [[Wikipedia:Arabic_name#Nasab|Arabic naming convention]] and the ''[[Arabian Adventures]]'' sourcebook, page 26, the patronymic "''bint''" means "daughter", and thus Arash bint Sanjar is "Arash, daughter of Sanjar". However, the text of ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'', page 95, refers to Arash as "he". Furthermore, the name "[[Wikipedia:Arash|Arash]]" is a common Iranian name for men. The discrepancy may be an error, either in-universe or in the text, or may suggest a change in sex or gender, or a woman ruling as a man. This article adopts the literal interpretation for faithfulness.<ref group="note">Arash's role as Grand Caliph on the Enlightened Throne may be a continuity error, as ''[[Land of Fate]]''—undated, but conventionally assumed to be set in [[1367 DR]]—establishes that the [[First Caliph]], first of the Grand Caliphs and founder of [[Enlightenment]], arose five centuries before, or in the 800s [[DR]], while Arash rules much earlier, in 657 DR. Furthermore, it states that there had only been eighteen caliphs since, all men. There are countless possible explanations, the simplest being that the [[Mar (ethnicity)|Mar]] writers of the treatise presented in ''The Grand History of the Realms'', perhaps made centuries later, are mistaken, or it really is just an error by author [[Brian R. James]].

==History==
According to a treatise by a [[Mar (ethnicity)|Mar]] writer of the [[Utter East]], in the [[657 DR|Year of the Nine Stars, 657 DR]], suffering the [[Plague of Fiends]], the Five Kingdoms of the [[Utter East]] had sent ships out north and south, desperately begging for aid from their neighbors. Grand Caliph Arash bint Sanjar heard these pleas, but he saw the [[Ffolk]] people as only heathens and barbarians, the land as infected and ravaged by the [[fiend]]s and [[undead]].

Instead, he sent an armada of ''[[sambuk]]'' to the Utter East in early [[Mirtul]] of 657 DR. The [[Corsair (kit)|corsair]]s launched a surprise attack on the Five Kingdoms, swiftly overrunning and seizing their defenseless port cities. Then legions of ''[[askar]]'', clad in [[djinn]]-forged [[lamellar]] and thrusting killing [[katar]]s, disembarked and marched across the land. With murderous efficiency, they razed every village and slew all they encountered, whether fiend or Ffolk, in what became known as the [[Scouring of the Utter East]]. The Grand Caliph had no plans to occupy this land, so by the time autumn fell, his forces boarded their ''sambuks'' and sailed home again.
