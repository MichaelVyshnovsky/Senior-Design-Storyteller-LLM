She wore a set of armor dyed green.\nIn the , a large group of duergar, giant spiders, and drow, was slaughtered in the home of a Bloomridge Park groundskeeper, Lavernica. The murder spree was performed by Orin the Red and her Murder Tribunal of Bhaal. Incontinentias body was gutted and displayed in a grotesque display at the center of a small cave under the groundskeepers home. Her body was turned into an effigy representing Sendai, a drow Bhaalspawn who died a century earlier at the hands of Abdel Adrian. The grisly display was embellished with the bodies of Lavernica, Broom Boy Tigrellpie, Josef the Ferret, Fluemartina B. Martelles, Abaforth Zelksix, Appleblossom Cathraelk, Damn Em All Holmwood, Zybil Hastenwald, and Cotre Silkwright."
