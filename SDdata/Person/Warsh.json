        "mainbody": "Warsh was a boatman in the Moonsea region in 1489 DR.\nWarsh was a greedy, foul-tempered old man. He mumbled when he spoke and often had his pipe clenched in his teeth, making it difficult to understand his speech. He was superstitious of outsiders.\nWarsh lived in a small village on an isle near Phlan. He served as the boatman for people who wanted to travel to his village. He was one of the last original members of the group that forged the deep secret of the village.  The truth was that sixty years before, Warsh and the other villagers had invoked devil servants of Tiamat to enslave the pirate crew of Reeve Sar Testain, who was menacing their village, in exchange for their souls and worship."
