'''Torixileos''' was a [[white dragon]] apparently living with its treasure inside a glacier near [[Silverymoon Pass]].

The dragon abducted [[Lynaelle Dawnmantle]] as Lynaelle traversed the pass during a blizzard. Taken back to the dragon's lair, Lynaelle was frightened into assisting Torixileos in plundering a young [[silver dragon]] named [[Starglimmer]]'s hoard. Lynaelle discovered the deception in time to rescue Starglimmer and herself as a larger silver dragon arrived. The larger silver, [[Symarra Brightmoon]], killed Torixileos, thereby rescuing both her son and Lynaella.<ref>
