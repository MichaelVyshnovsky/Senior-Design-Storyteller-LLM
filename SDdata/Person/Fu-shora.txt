'''Fu-shora''' was a [[geisha]] in [[Semmishi]] on [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Fu-shora, born as '''Ido Fushora''', was the youngest daughter of [[Ido Kunarakuai]], chief justice of the executive court. After her parents' divorce in [[1347 DR]], she ran away from home, eventually becoming a geisha in one of the most sordid pleasure districts in Semmishi.

In 1357 DR, Kunoarakuai hired some adventurers to find her, telling them she was an important witness. [[Nobu Chuya]] had paid for Fu-shora to be his personal concubine.

==Personality==
Fu-shora adapted herself to her sordid life and did not want to return home. She promised herself she would not forgive her father.
