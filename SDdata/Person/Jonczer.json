At that time, he was told of Maerjanthra's plot to bear [[Elminster Aumar]] a child, on which she was aided by [[Khelben Arunsun]], who under duress from [[Mystra]] gave her a potion to override Elminster's control over his own fertility, as accounted by his fellow apprentice, Goraun.\n\nShortly after Maerjanthra's death, Jonczer disappeared after a break-in killed his fellow apprentice [[Rorgel]]. Narnra assumed Jonczer was dead, though she saw a lot of blood and never actually spotted the body."
