'''Morgwan Fellfoot''' was a member of the [[Sky Pony Tribe|Sky Pony]] tribe of [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s from the northern slopes of the [[Nether Mountains]] in the [[Silver Marches]] around [[1372 DR]].

Morgan served as the chief lieutenant to the Sky Ponies' acting War-Leader, [[Wolmad Eaglewing]], who supplanted their chief when he was on his deathbed.

Despite his "allegiance" to the War-Leader, Morgwan had a scheme to infect Wolmad with [[lycanthropy]] and complete his transformation from reckless pillager to outright evil savage.
