Morgwan Fellfoot was a member of the Sky Pony tribe of Uthgardt barbarians from the northern slopes of the Nether Mountains in the Silver Marches around 1372 DR.
Morgan served as the chief lieutenant to the Sky Ponies acting War-Leader, Wolmad Eaglewing, who supplanted their chief when he was on his deathbed.
Despite his "allegiance" to the War-Leader, Morgwan had a scheme to infect Wolmad with lycanthropy and complete his transformation from reckless pillager to outright evil savage.
