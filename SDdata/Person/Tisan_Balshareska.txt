'''Tisan Balshareska''', also known as '''Ninth of Nine''', '''Sunderer of Dreams''', '''She Who Turns the Wheel of Fate''' was perhaps the most powerful [[geomancer]] to ever walk the [[Zakhara|Land of Fate]].

==Description==
Though Tisan could take any shape she wished, in her natural form she was a heavily muscled fair-skinned [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]] who appeared to be in her late thirties. She wore her jet-black hair tied back in a single braid that almost reached to the floor.

Her garments of choice were short-sleeved robes cut to expose the intricate golden tattoos that covered her hands, arms, legs, neck and face. These tattoos were not just decorative works of art but powerful [[geoglyph]]s. One of these tattoos contained the magic of the ''[[lifeproof]]'' spell. The geoglyphs would flash gold and red light when actively protecting Tisan.

==Possessions==
Tisan wore nine pieces of ornate [[gold]]en jewelry. Each piece was worth over 5,000 [[gp]] and several of them were enchanted.

Tisan collected many [[magic item]]s during her centuries of existence including a ''[[phylactery of long years]]'', a ''[[talisman of protection +5]]'', ''[[Bracers of defense|bracers of defense AC2]]'', a ''[[talisman of force]]'', three different ''[[ioun stone]]s'', a ''[[ring of human influence]]'', a ''[[rod of smiting]]'', and a ''[[scarab of terror]]''.

She also penned the [[Kitab al-Asfr]] during her rise to power, a scroll-shaped book containing many [[Elemental earth school|earth]]-related spells.{{Cite dragon/250/Arcane Lore: Secrets of the Arch-Geomancer}}

==History==
Tisan was born 900 years ago, as of [[1367 DR]],{{AQ-time}} to one of the ruling families of the geomancers in the now dead empire of [[Kadar]]. Her given name was Balshareska. As with all nobles at the time, she was trained as a priest of [[Grumbar]], though her inherent talent for politics and intrigue eventually led her to study at the [[Imperial College of Geomancy]] to complete her [[wizard]]ly training. Through a combination of intimidation, coercion and treachery, she earned the title of Tisan, Ruler of the [[Nine Council|Supreme Council]]<ref group="note">The Adventure Book for Ruined Kingdoms clearly states that Tisan led the "Supreme Council", but the information presented in the Campaign Guide on the "Nine Council" leads the reader to believe this is the same organization. within 50 years. She went to great lengths to conceal her true name after reaching the Supreme Council.

Her greatest mistake during this time was underestimating the invading [[Zakharan pantheon|enlightened]] barbarians from the west. One of these barbarians, [[Suhail min Zann]] and his [[Lions of Yesterday]] defeated the Geomancers on many occasions. Despite her greatest efforts Tisan was unable to directly harm Suhail, so she corrupted his brother [[Ashtarek]] instead. Tisan eventually killed Ashtarek outside of the gates of [[Tadabbur]] with ghastly magic that would not allow his brother to [[Resurrection (spell)|resurrect]] him. Suhail eventually drove Tisan into the bowels of Tadabbur where he was able to imprison her within her own fortress.

==Relationships==
Tisan's [[familiar]] and chief lieutenant was a [[cornugon]] named [[Malakir]]. Malakir was trapped in stasis with Tisan in her laboratory.

Tisan's "pet" was a large [[earth elemental]] called [[Keskeg]].
