        "mainbody": "'''Quent''' was a caravan master in [[Aglarond]] during the late 14{{th}} century DR.{{cite book/Stardeep|80-85|8}}",
        "Appearance": "Quent had black hair, and long years of experience were apparent on it.",
        "Personality": "He was the master of the caravan which [[Raidon Kane]] signed up with as a guard in {{yearlink|1375}}. Per Raidon Kane, he was obviously a veteran of several trips, who ran a tight ship with good discipline. Quent boasted of a secret pass across the [[River Umber]] to reach [[Emmech]] faster.\n\nQuent was, however, greedy and adventurous enough to try to make a shortcut across territory patrolled by Thay in order to circumvent a tax on the usual trade roads.{{cite book/Stardeep|123_125|11}}",
        "Combat": "He knew how to wield a bow.",
        "History": "He exchanged some [[barrel]]s for boxes outside [[Phent]] on the first leg of their trip, heading directly for [[Emmech]] through a lesser-traveled route south the next day. One day later, they crossed a slender ravine in the [[Dragonjaw Mountains]] before making camp. With half a day's light left, Quent sent a scout forward. The scout returned with a [[Thayan]] patrol in pursuit; during the attack, Quent attacked them with his bow.\n\nWhen he arrived at [[Emmech]], he unloaded his wares, which comprised several kinds of fruit. He paid his crew quickly, and began making deals soon after."
