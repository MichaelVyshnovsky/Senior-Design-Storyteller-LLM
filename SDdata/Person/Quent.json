        "mainbody": "Quent was a caravan master in Aglarond during the late 14 century DR.\nQuent had black hair, and long years of experience were apparent on it.\nHe was the master of the caravan which Raidon Kane signed up with as a guard in . Per Raidon Kane, he was obviously a veteran of several trips, who ran a tight ship with good discipline. Quent boasted of a secret pass across the River Umber to reach Emmech faster.\nQuent was, however, greedy and adventurous enough to try to make a shortcut across territory patrolled by Thay in order to circumvent a tax on the usual trade roads.\nHe knew how to wield a bow.\nHe exchanged some barrels for boxes outside Phent on the first leg of their trip, heading directly for Emmech through a lesser-traveled route south the next day. One day later, they crossed a slender ravine in the Dragonjaw Mountains before making camp. With half a days light left, Quent sent a scout forward. The scout returned with a Thayan patrol in pursuit during the attack, Quent attacked them with his bow.\nWhen he arrived at Emmech, he unloaded his wares, which comprised several kinds of fruit. He paid his crew quickly, and began making deals soon after."
