        "mainbody": "anthra (often called Danthra the Dreamer, a name chosen by Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun) was a companion to Tsarra Chaadren, and considered Tsarra her best friend.\nDanthra was very thin with a delicate build, long dark straight hair, and a wan complexion.\nDanthra often received visions while she slept, and spoke prophetic words during them, although she did not remember the words on waking. The visions and her words often came true. The visions incapacitated her for differing amounts of time from moments to days. Danthra began an apprenticeship at Blackstaff Tower in 1365 DR.\nOn Uktar 28, 1374 DR, while Danthra was demonstrating a new spell designed to discern the origins of magical items, an explosion inadvertently caused by Raegar Stoneblade blew a hole in the side of Blackstaff Tower, destroying Danthras physical form and injuring Tsarra Chaadren and Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun. Khelben placed Danthras soul inside a kiira and attached it to Tsarras head.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryApprentices of Blackstaff Tower\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants\nqmvdq5n04q989c4zssb78s5us93ogjc"
