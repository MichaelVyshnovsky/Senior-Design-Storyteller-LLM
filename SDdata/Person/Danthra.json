        "Description": "Danthra was very thin with a delicate build, long dark straight hair, and a wan complexion.",
        "History": "Danthra often received visions while she slept, and spoke prophetic words during them, although she did not remember the words on waking. The visions and her words often came true. The visions incapacitated her for differing amounts of time from moments to days. Danthra began an apprenticeship at [[Blackstaff Tower]] in [[1365 DR]].\n\nOn [[Uktar 28]], [[1374 DR]], while Danthra was demonstrating a new spell designed to discern the origins of magical items, an explosion inadvertently caused by [[Raegar Stoneblade]] blew a hole in the side of [[Blackstaff Tower]], destroying Danthra's physical form and injuring Tsarra Chaadren and Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun. Khelben placed Danthra's soul inside a [[kiira (disambiguation)|''kiira'']] and attached it to Tsarra's head.",
