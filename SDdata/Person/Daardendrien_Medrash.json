        "mainbody": "'''Daardendrien Medrash''' was a [[dragonborn]] member of [[Clan Daardendrien]], and a high-ranking member of the [[Lance Defenders]]. He was a [[paladin]] of [[Torm]], and of [[Bahamut]]. As of [[1486 DR]], Medrash was among the most renowned dragonborn in various nations of [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Description": "Medrash had yellow eyes and russet colored scales.",
        "Abilities": "He was capable of breathing lightning. Medrash was also blessed by both Torm and Bahamut, and was able to channel the [[divine magic]] of both deities at the same time.",
        "Relationships": "Medrash was the son of [[Daardendrien Turan]] and the brother of [[Daardendrien Nijana|Nijana]].<ref group=\"note\">See notes. He was also a good friend of his clanmate [[Daardendrien Balasar|Balasar]].",
        "History": "As a child, Medrash was timid and weak, a shame for his clan. In his youth, he saw Torm in dreams, exhorting him to push his limits. Craving for something that would give a sense of purpose to his life, Medrash began to follow his dreams, and joined the military forces of Tymanther, eventually becoming one the finest warriors of Clan Daardendrien. In one of his journeys, he came across a temple of Torm and recognized the statues of the god. He asked the tormites to train him as a paladin, and they accepted. Clan Daardendrien didn't expel him due to his reverence of a god because they saw his abilities as a paladin useful for the benefit of the whole clan.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], Medrash was sent to [[Luthcheq]] as member of a diplomatic party sent to assist ambassador [[Ophinshtalajiir Perra|Perra]], when a vision from Torm alerted him to an evil presence that was committing murders. This became a problem when, soon after, the [[Thymari]] diplomatic delegation was kicked out of [[Chessenta]] as the dragonborn had no evidence to prove their innocence, and Medrash was forced to return to Tymanther.\n\nDuring the travel back home, a [[Topaz dragon|topaz]] ''taaldarax'' (one of the players of [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]'s ''[[xorvintaal]]'') attacked Perra and her delegation, but with the help of Balasar, [[Khouryn Skulldark]], and his [[Brotherhood of the Griffon|men]], the dragonborn were able to drive away the dragon.\t\n\nUpon arriving in Tymanther, he found his native land [[Invasion of Tymanther|under attack]] by [[Stone giant|ash giants]] from the [[Black Ash Plain]]. Medrash, Balasar and Khouryn led a small unit of Daardendrien warriors in an expedition to investigate the giants' motives, but they were overwhelmed. As they fled the battlefield, they encountered members of the [[Platinum Cadre]] in an operation to exterminate ash giants, and seeing what the followers of Bahamut were capable of, they joined them until they returned to [[Djerad Thymar]]. Although [[Shestandeliath Patrin]], the leader of the Bahamutan cultists, tried to teach him that his mistrust toward the Platinum Cadre was unfounded, and that Bahamut and Torm were allies, Medrash didn't wanted to believe the Loyal Fury was an ally of a dragon.\n\nWhen Khouryn was hired by [[Vanquisher]] [[Tarhun]] to train the Lance Defenders in dwarven fighting techniques, Medrash assisted him in the training exercises. He then led a group of Lance Defenders in an successful operation to drive out the giants attacking the farms near Djerad Thymar. Medrash was in charge of a Daardendrien war band during Vanquisher Tarhun's joint military operation against the giants. He joined forces with Balasar, Patrin, and later [[Nala]], in order to save Tarhun's life.\n\nSome time after that, he and Khouryn accompanied Balasar to Djerad Thymar's Catacombs, where they investigated Nala's secret apartments and discovered she was a [[priest]]ess of [[Tiamat]]. When they exposed Nala as a tiamatan, Patrin refused to turn against her and wanted Medrash and the others to surrender any evidence they had. Medrash challenged Patrin to a duel of honor, and in the ensuing battle the paladin of Torm won. Medrash regretted that he had to kill Patrin, however, as he at last had acknowledged the paladin of Bahamut as an honorable comrade and a friend.\n\nAfter Nala's treachery was revealed, [[Vishva]], the new leader of the Platinum Cadre, convinced Medrash to help the members of the Cadre by cleansing them of the power they had gained from Tiamat. After that, Medrash took part in the operation to laid siege to [[Ashhold]] and to kill the [[green dragon]] [[Skuthosiin]]. As a reward for his deed, he was reassigned to the Lance Defenders and promoted to the rank of knight, a high-ranking position within the military.\t\n\nWhen Khouryn Skulldark returned to Tymanther and warned them about [[Tchazzar]]'s plans to invade the dragonborn nation, Vanquisher Tarhun made Medrash the official leader of the Platinum Cadre, and assigned him the mission to destroy [[Gestaniius]] and liberate [[High Imaskar]] from her forces, so the Imaskari would lend their aid to the Thymari. During this travel, Medrash discovered that he had the ability to call to the powers of both Torm and Bahamut at the same time.\n\nWhile they were searching Gestaniius in the [[Dragonsword Mountains]], the [[mercury dragon]] [[Praxasalandos]] ambushed them and succeeded in separating the party into two groups. However, Medrash was able to defeat the dragon, and performed an exorcism on Prax which cleansed him of the taint of Tiamat he had acquired from playing ''xorvintaal'', freeing him from the compulsion of playing the game.\n\nAfter killing Gestaniius, Medrash and his forces were sent to Luthcheq to escort ambassador Perra, who wanted to reinstate the diplomatic relations between Tymanther and Chessenta. However, when they reached the city, the [[Battle of Luthcheq]] had already begun. Medrash took part in the battle, purifying a few [[gem dragon|gem]] and [[metallic dragon|metallic dragons]] from the ''xorvintaal'' compulsion, changing the tide of the battle for the allied forces, and helping the Chessentan forces to destroy the [[dracolich]] [[Alasklerbanbastos]].\n\nMedrash later went to [[Dracowyr]] alongside Balasar, [[Kanjentellequor Biri|Biri]], the Brotherhood of the Griffon and the surviving dragons of the Battle of Luthcheq. Together, they put an end to Brimstone's ''xorvintaal''. After that, he returned to Tymanther, were he became the protector of the Platinum Cadre, to ensure the Thymari didn't forget that the Cadre had fought for and saved their country from certain doom.\n\nIn 1486 DR, Medrash had become the scion of Clan Daardendrien. The elders of the clan were considering to present him as candidate to the elections for the new Vanquisher, that were expected to be celebrated in [[1487 DR]], due to his good reputation in other nations, although he wasn't popular among the Thymari because he was a worshiper of the gods."
