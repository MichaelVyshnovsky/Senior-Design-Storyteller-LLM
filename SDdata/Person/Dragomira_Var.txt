Dragomira Var () was a human gladiator that worked as a spy for the Zhentarim in the late 15 century DR.
Dragomira had a rather feral demeanor and loathed dwarves.
Dragomira owned an elaborate suit of bone armor that she had crafted from the bones of her victims. She also owned a giant scorpion as a mount named Hook, whom she loved dearly.
In 1490 DR, Dragomira participated in an aquatic flag capture event in the Arena of Hillsfar, during which she had to protect the flag of her raft, which represented the city of Thentia.
