        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Merriolle found herself among those Baldurians in a crowd who witnessed [[Bastian d'Zinn]], a man of means, accosting the child named [[Rhaneld]] for accidentally hitting him with a rock while playing. Bastian believed that a child playing on a street was a sign of the city's crime-ridden downward spiral. Merriolle was outraged that a simple pebble would almost reduce someone to fisticuffs and believed that the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette'' was responsible for riling people up and stoking up hate."
