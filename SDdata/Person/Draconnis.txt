Draconnis was the nickname given to the blue dragon leader of a hill giant tribe from the Storm Horns of Cormyr in the 14 century DR.
In the early 1360s DR, Draconnis was among the leaders of monster communities of the Storm Horns that banded together to slay the heroic Roadwarden Arelin Starbrow and break the defenders of the Skull Crag Keep. After the dragons hill giants joined the ambush that took Arelins life, Draconnis claimed the enchanted Lance of the Roadwarden, one of the symbols of the office. The lance remained in Draconnis hoard, in the wyrms lair filled with the bones of animals, monsters, and humanoids. Every bone was snapped open, and their marrow was consumed by the glutinous blue dragon. Subsequently, a group of adventurers, alongside a ranger from Skull Crag named Tornilee, attacked the giants cavers and slew Draconnis, reclaiming the lost artifact.
