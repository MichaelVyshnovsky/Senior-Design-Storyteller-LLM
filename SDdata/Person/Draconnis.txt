'''Draconnis''' was the nickname given to the [[blue dragon]] leader of a [[hill giant]] tribe from the [[Storm Horns]] of [[Cormyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the early [[1360 DR|1360s DR]], Draconnis was among the leaders of monster communities of the Storm Horns that banded together to slay the heroic [[Roadwarden]] [[Arelin Starbrow]] and break the defenders of the [[Skull Crag Keep]]. After the dragon's hill giants joined the ambush that took Arelin's life, Draconnis claimed the [[enchanted]] ''Lance of the Roadwarden,'' one of the symbols of the office. The [[lance]] remained in Draconnis' hoard, in the wyrm's lair filled with the bones of animals, monsters, and [[humanoid]]s. Every bone was snapped open, and their marrow was consumed by the glutinous blue dragon. Subsequently, a group of [[adventurer]]s, alongside a [[ranger]] from Skull Crag named [[Tornilee]], attacked the giant's cavers and slew Draconnis, reclaiming the lost artifact.
