'''Myros''' was a [[Red Wizard]] operating out of the [[Thayan outpost (Evernight)|Thayan Enclave]] in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{Quote|Do not worry about the morals of your actions|Myros}}

==Abilities==
She had devised a [[ritual]] to transform the essence of slain [[Shadovar]] spellcasters into "Keys of Night" that could be used to bypass [[Netheril|Netherese]] defenses.

==Activities==
As a member of the Thayan mission in Evernight, Myros worked to undermine Netherese activities in the city, and in particular, she targeted the Shadovar ambassador.

==History==
During the crisis appearance of the [[Cloaked Ascendancy]] in Neverwinter, a [[Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge|hero]] from [[Neverwinter]] was directed to Myros for help in accessing the [[Shard of Night]]. Myros agreed to help fashion a Key of Night to get the hero inside, but required that they slay the Shadovar ambassador in Evernight, [[Kaross]], and collect her "essence". Myros neglected to tell the hero that slaying Kaross would cause the hungry [[undead]] of the city to turn on them.
