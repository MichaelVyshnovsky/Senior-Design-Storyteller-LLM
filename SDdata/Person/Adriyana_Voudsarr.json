Mystra transformed her into Adriyanas Garter at her request.\nAt the time of the duel from which she would emerge as Magister, she was wearing ragged clothing her speech appeared to be back-country.\nAdriyana was little interested in acquiring more magic, or in dominating those around her. She had a great love of the land around her, and much empathy.\nAdriyana lived in a pond-side hut.\nAdriyana was capable of polymorphing herself into a leaf with eyes, using that spell to survey the forest while drifting along on the breeze.\nBefore becoming the Magister, Adriyana had the habit of turning herself into a leaf with eyes. During the first part of her tenure as the Magister, she thoroughly trained local elves and humans as mages, teaching them love of the land as well.\nAdriyana Voudsarr became the Magister upon defeating her predecessor, Ergrith Klavulgrun \"Kingslayer\", in a mage-duel upon discovering him taunting and torturing one of his hunters. After becoming the Magister, she was not seen in wider Faer√ªn for some years challengers did not come to her for some time, as many had to rebuild their strength in the wake of the Kingslayer.\nWhen challengers started to come to Adriyana, she turned away many most made the error of rousing her rage by destroying the forest around her.
