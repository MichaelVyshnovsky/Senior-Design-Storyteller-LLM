Silwen Wiltfen was a moon elf advisor to Dagult Neverember in Neverwinter during the late 15 century DR.
Shay helped to coordinate the efforts of adventurers in accordance with Lord Neverembers goals for Neverwinter, such as by directing them to assist his allies.
She worked alongside the likes of Drijm Stoneaxe, Sudbury, and Shay Morningstar in her service to Lord Neverember.
She was familiar with Iliyasha Guidingstar, a representative of Iliyanbruen.
When the elves of New Sharandar arrived in Neverwinter seeking aid circa 1479 DR, Silwen coordinated efforts to send adventurers to aid them.
