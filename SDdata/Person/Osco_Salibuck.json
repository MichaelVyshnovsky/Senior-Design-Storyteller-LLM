        "mainbody": "'''Osco Salibuck''' was a [[halfling]] [[rogue]] from [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description": "Osco had chestnut-brown curly hair with sideburns. He also had silver rings in his left nostril and earlobe. He was quite young-looking in [[1479 DR]].",
        "History": "In [[Nightal]] [[1479 DR]], [[Renaer Neverember]] and his companions (including [[Vajra Safahr]], soon to be the seventh [[Blackstaff]]) were lying low at [[Varadras]] when they discovered Osco had discovered the way to travel to the mansion and was trying to avoid capture by the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] for posing as a member of the [[Cellarers' & Plumbers' Guild]]. Since Osco didn't know any of the [[magical]] pass phrases to open doors or return to Waterdeep, he became trapped in the mansion.\n\nOsco joined Renaer's group and helped return Vajra to Waterdeep so that she could claim the title of Blackstaff. He was tested by [[Blackstaff Tower]], where he met two ghosts, [[Pikar Salibuck]] and [[Osco Salibuck the Elder]] (his ancestors; Osco the Elder's ghost was actually being impersonated by the ghost of [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]]). Osco then helped Vajra and the others to defeat [[Khondar Naomal]], who was attempting to invade the tower.\n\nOsco later became a member of the organization formed by Renaer to replace the [[Moonstars]].",
        "Equipment": "Osco wielded a [[sling]]. He also carried a dagger named \"Osco's Luck\"; it was a simple stone dagger with a red, cabochon-cut [[jasper]] stone in its and its name engraved in [[Common|Trade Common]] on its blade. Osco swapped this dagger for one of the keys held by Khondar while attempting to enter Blackstaff Tower.",
        "Relationships": "Osco was the son of [[Ellial Salibuck]] and grandson of [[Madrak]], a servant at [[Neverember Manor]]. He had an aunt named [[Delalar]]."
