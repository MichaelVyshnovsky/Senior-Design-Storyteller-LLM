        "mainbody": "Osco Salibuck was a halfling rogue from Waterdeep. \nOsco had chestnut-brown curly hair with sideburns. He also had silver rings in his left nostril and earlobe. He was quite young-looking in 1479 DR.\nIn Nightal 1479 DR, Renaer Neverember and his companions (including Vajra Safahr, soon to be the seventh Blackstaff) were lying low at Varadras when they discovered Osco had discovered the way to travel to the mansion and was trying to avoid capture by the City Watch for posing as a member of the Cellarers & Plumbers Guild. Since Osco didnt know any of the magical pass phrases to open doors or return to Waterdeep, he became trapped in the mansion.\nOsco joined Renaers group and helped return Vajra to Waterdeep so that she could claim the title of Blackstaff. He was tested by Blackstaff Tower, where he met two ghosts, Pikar Salibuck and Osco Salibuck the Elder (his ancestors Osco the Elders ghost was actually being impersonated by the ghost of Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun). Osco then helped Vajra and the others to defeat Khondar Naomal, who was attempting to invade the tower.\nOsco later became a member of the organization formed by Renaer to replace the Moonstars.\nOsco wielded a sling. He also carried a dagger named \"Oscos Luck\" it was a simple stone dagger with a red, cabochon-cut jasper stone in its and its name engraved in Trade Common on its blade. Osco swapped this dagger for one of the keys held by Khondar while attempting to enter Blackstaff Tower.\nOsco was the son of Ellial Salibuck and grandson of Madrak, a servant at Neverember Manor. He had an aunt named Delalar."
