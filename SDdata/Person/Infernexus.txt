Infernexus was a young red dragon in Stardock in the early 1490s DR.
Infernexus was the youngest son of Ashtyrranthor and brother of Ashranthax, Blazutranc, Meteoranzym, Smoakcant, and Zolcharrx.
Infernexus was usually inside his lair in Stardock.
Infernexus felt miserable inside Stardock. In truth, he wanted to abandon the githyanki and carve for himself a lair inside the Twisted Caverns of Undermountain but his mother forced him to remain there and help the githyanki. He was even ready to plot with adventurers to cause Ashtyrranthors death.
