        "Description": "Maccath had very conspicuous tiefling traits, especially extremely red skin. She usually wore a blazing red cloak.",
        "History": "Maccath was a member of the Arcane Brotherhood in [[Luskan]]. She was always interested in dragon lore and relics and she traveled to the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] to learn about dragon magic.\nShe soon discovered that for advancement in this field, Maccath needed to talk to a real dragon.\nRemembering the sacking of the Host Tower by the white dragon [[Arauthator]] during the [[Rage of Dragons]] in the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], Maccath decided to seek out Arauthator.\n''Circa'' the [[1486 DR|Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR]] she led an expedition to the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] and found the dragon's lair.\n\nArauthator normally killed intruders but he saw that Maccath could be useful in two ways: she could explain to the dragon all the lore he looted from the Host Tower, and her company would help his mate [[Arveiaturace]] overcome the grief of the loss of her wizard rider.\nMaccath was so intrigued to learn the dragon's magic secrets that she agreed to be his captive. Eventually she was rescued by a  band of adventures who sought her knowledge to help them fight the [[Cult of the Dragon]]."
