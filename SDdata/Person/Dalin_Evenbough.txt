'''Dalin Evenbough''' was a [[halfling]] merchant aboard the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' in [[1374 DR]].

==Description==
Merchant Evenbough was a fair-skinned slender hin with cautious personality. When pressed to defend himself, Dalin wielded a [[shortbow]], staying away from the immediate danger of the front lines.

==History==
In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, Captain [[Lastri Kassireh]] and the ''Vigilant'' sailed from the [[Sword Coast]] to the nation of [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. Onboard the ship were several passengers, including Dalin Evenbough and [[Volothamp Geddarm]], who journeyed to meet with a wealthy [[yuan-ti]] trading company leaderâ€”Lady [[Sa'Sani]]. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences: food supplies were mysteriously spoiled, freshwater barrels ruptured, one of the crew, [[Kellen (sailor)|Kellen]], got drunk and drowned, Volo almost got poisoned, and new ropes became frayed. In reality, the ship was sabotaged. Dalin Evenbough was rightfully worried for his life aboard the ship.

While most of the crew's lives ended in a deadly storm, Dalin survived. The ''Vigilant's'' shipwreck was washed ashore not far from the city of [[Samargol]], and Dalin, Volo, and several other passengers ended up defending themselves against flesh-hungry [[Batiri]].
