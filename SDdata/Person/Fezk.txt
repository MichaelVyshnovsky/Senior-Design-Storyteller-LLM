Tracker Fezk was a devoted member of the cult of the Absolute, living among her fellow goblins in a ruined temple of Sel√ªne for a time during the late 15 century DR.
She wore around her a neck an amulet bearing the symbol of the Absolutes cult.
Fezk was among the cultists that guarded the inner halls of their Shattered Sanctum fortress. She remained there fulfilling her duties, even as other cultists celebrated their victorious raids against the weak and faithless.
