        "mainbody": "Shuushar the Awakaned was a kuo-toa hermit and mystic who was captured by the drow during the late 1480s DR.\nShuushar was a calm and peaceful presence. Despite his peoples propensity for madness, his years of seclusion and meditation had, in his words, cleared him of that legacy. He was also a complete pacifist. He didnt fight or cause harm to any other creature, even refusing to defend himself or others.\nShuushar was a monk who hailed from Sloobludop but wandered the Underdark for many years in order to fulfill his training. \nDuring the late 1480s DR, Shuushar had attained enlightenment and decided to return to Sloobludop to teach his fellows, but was instead captured by drow slavers of Velkynvelve."
