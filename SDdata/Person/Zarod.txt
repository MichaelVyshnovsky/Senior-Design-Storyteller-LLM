Zarod was a fallen angel in the Labyrinth in the late 15 century DR. 
The gods condemned Zarod and seven other fallen angels to remain as stone statues in the depths of the Labyrinth for unknown crimes.
Zarod could use divination powers within seven days for people in the vicinity who talked with it.
