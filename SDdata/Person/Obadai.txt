'''Obadai''' was the progenitor of the [[stone giant]] race.

==Description==
As [[sage (title)|sage]] of the stone giant kingdom of [[Ostoria]], Obadai wore many-jeweled rings and a gilded crown. He fought with a powerful ancient weapon.

==Possessions==
[[Crown of Obadai|Obadai's crown]] had the magical power to create [[undead]].

==Relationships==
Obadai was one of the many terrestrial sons of [[Annam All-Father]] and his wife [[Othea]]. His many siblings were his elder brothers [[Lanaxis]], [[Vilmos]], [[Nicias]], [[Masud]], [[Ottar]], his younger brothers [[Ruk]], [[Vilmos]], and [[Arno and Julian]], He had a half-brother through his mother named [[Dunmore]], as well as three other half-brothers through his mother whose names are forgotten to history. Through his father, he was half-sibling to the [[Giant pantheon|giant gods]] [[Stronmaus]], [[Hiatea]], [[Grolantor]], [[Iallanis]], [[Memnor]], and [[Skoraeus]]. He was likely related to the gods [[Surtr]] and [[Thrym]] as well.

Obadai was the father of at least two sons, the second of which was named [[Illsenstaad]].

==History==
Obadai was born sometime around {{Yearlink|-30000}}. When he and his terrestrial brothers came of age, Obadai's father, Annam, granted each of them an inheritance in the great giant empire of Ostoria. Obadai laid claim to the caverns of the [[Underdark]], ruling as sage, and his offspring became the stone giant people.

At some point Obadai charged his second son, Illsenstaad, with the task of documenting both the tangible and religious history of the [[giant]] race. Over time this culminated in the temple of [[Hotun-Shûl]].{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|17}}

One of the carvings within Hotun-Shûl detailed an incident in which Obadai instructed a group of stone giants to contemplate the surface world and all that laid within it. This is believed to have taken place at what would one day become the [[Seven Stones]].{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|18}}

After many millennia, it was revealed that Obadai's mother had had an affair with the sea god [[Ulutiu]] and that his younger brother Dunmore was probably not a full brother. After Ulutiu's amulet caused the [[Great Glacier]] and the [[Endless Ice Sea]] to form, Obadai and his brothers soon discovered a way to halt the amulet's magic; however, they were forbidden from doing so by their mother. Lanaxis, Obadai' oldest brother and leader of all of them, summoned them all together for a meeting in [[Voninheim]]. but he accidentally poisoned not only Othea but also Obadai and all of his other brothers except Arno and Julian and Dunmore.

Obadai and all his poisoned brothers were buried in drumlins outside of Voninheim. There Obadai's body lay for about 3,000 years until [[1369 DR]], when the [[firbolg]] [[Tavis Burdun]] unveiled the [[Twilight Vale]] and challenged Lanaxis. Lanaxis used powerful magic to reanimate Obadai's corpse as a [[zombie]], and he did the same with all of the other giant brothers. The [[undead]] giant kings attacked Tavis with the full fury of their magics, but Tavis and his companions were protected by Annam's axe [[Sky Cleaver]]. Tavis then used the magic of Sky Cleaver to reveal to each brother, even in their undeath, that Lanaxis had betrayed them. After Ottar, Obadai was the second undead giant to understand the treachery. He and the other dead giants turned and charged at Lanaxis instead, but Lanaxis created a magic shield to protect the portico from their onslaught. Nicias eventually broke through the shield with his [[morning star]], but then Lanaxis killed each of them a second time with his sword. Obadai fell after his brother Masud and before Vilmos.
