        "Relationships": "Graven was the child of [[Wilaver Chandler|Wilaver]] and [[Caryn Chandler]], and brother of [[Jandove Midler|Jandove]]. He was the uncle of her two sons [[Normon Midler|Normon]] and [[Thoben Midler|Thoben]].",
        "History": "During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], the [[drow]] forces of [[Vicala Szind]] attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the [[Thread of the Weave]]. Unknown to the drow, the houseservant [[Maisby]] had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of [[Purple Dragons]] and then a team of [[adventurer]]s to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.\n\nGraven was kept bound up in the master bedroom with his sister Jandove under the watch of bickering drow looters."
