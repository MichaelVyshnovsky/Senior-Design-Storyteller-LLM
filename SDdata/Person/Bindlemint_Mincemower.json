        "mainbody": "Bindlemint Mincemower was a gnome living in Gnomengarde in the late 15 century DR.\nBindlemint joined the community of Gnomengarde sometime shortly after it experienced an attack by a rampaging mimic. Not long later, she accompanied the small kingdoms two foremost inventors, Dabbledob Plasterpatch and Fibblestib Pinebark, to deliver their latest invention, the Gnomengarde grenade, to representatives from the town of Leilon. The town had requested magical aid because it was beset by powerful enemies, as the three gnomes soon had to contend with. Upon their arrival at the agreed meeting place of Dumathoins Gultch, they were attacked by undead servants of Ularan Mortus, one of Leilons chief enemies. While Dabbledob and Fibblestib were unable to escape, Bindlemint fled for Leilon to seek help, but along the way, she was attacked by a wereboar servant of Leilons other great foe, Fheralai Stormsworn. Luckily, she was found by the representatives from Leilon before she sustained more than superficial injuries."
