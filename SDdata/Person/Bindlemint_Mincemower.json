        "mainbody": "'''Bindlemint Mincemower''' was a [[gnome]] living in [[Gnomengarde]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Bindlemint joined the community of Gnomengarde sometime shortly after it experienced an attack by a rampaging [[mimic]]. Not long later, she accompanied the small kingdom's two foremost inventors, [[Dabbledob Plasterpatch]] and [[Fibblestib Pinebark]], to deliver their latest invention, the ''[[Gnomengarde grenade]]'', to representatives from the town of [[Leilon]]. The town had requested [[magic]]al aid because it was beset by powerful enemies, as the three gnomes soon had to contend with. Upon their arrival at the agreed meeting place of [[Dumathoin's Gultch]], they were attacked by [[undead]] servants of [[Ularan Mortus]], one of Leilon's chief enemies. While Dabbledob and Fibblestib were unable to escape, Bindlemint fled for Leilon to seek help, but along the way, she was attacked by a [[wereboar]] servant of Leilon's other great foe, [[Fheralai Stormsworn]]. Luckily, she was found by the representatives from Leilon before she sustained more than superficial injuries."
