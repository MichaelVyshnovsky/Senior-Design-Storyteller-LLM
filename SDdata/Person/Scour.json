        "mainbody": "Scour was a Voidharrow demon who entered Toril through a gate from another universe with his \"sibling\" Murmur hundreds of years before the Spellplague. Scours consciousness was scattered into many pieces but Murmur was apparently able to revive much of Scours mind.\nBy 1480 DR, Scour was in Luskan, manifesting as a swarm of mutated vermin. Scour infected many inhabitants with the Fury plague, which caused victims to go into a homicidal rage. Scour attacked an assembly of Luskans gangs, killing many people. He was confronted in Luskans underground by Kalen Dren, Myrin Darkdance, and Sithe and defeated. Sithe sacrificed herself by using her innate abilities to open a portal to the void where she took the remaining fragments of Scour.\nScours corporal form, such as it was, consisted of a mass of mutated vermin.\nCategoryInhabitants of the Far Realm\nCategoryInhabitants\n2sp9zpqxv5qv4rayvhfpueubtp0iipk"
