'''Chop''' was a [[bugbear]] who had been enthralled by [[Absolute]] and forced to commit numerous atrocities in its name during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Pretty faces go chop...faces? No - no faces,only meat. Never think, never stop. Only chop. Chop. CHOP.|Chop.}}

==Description==
Chop had a bald head but exceptionally hairy body that was constantly covered in blood and viscera.

==Personality==
Chop was not left with much of anything resembling a personality. His psyche had been stripped away by his master, the [[elder brain]] known to its cultish followers as the Absolute.

==Activities==
The only activity Chop could perform was to slaughter [[humanoid]]s and extract their brains for the Absolute. These brains were then used to create [[intellect devourer]]s who would be included within the elder brain's hive mind.
