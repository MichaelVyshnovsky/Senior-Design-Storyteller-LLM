Chop was a bugbear who had been enthralled by Absolute and forced to commit numerous atrocities in its name during the late 15 century DR.
Chop had a bald head but exceptionally hairy body that was constantly covered in blood and viscera.
Chop was not left with much of anything resembling a personality. His psyche had been stripped away by his master, the elder brain known to its cultish followers as the Absolute.
The only activity Chop could perform was to slaughter humanoids and extract their brains for the Absolute. These brains were then used to create intellect devourers who would be included within the elder brains hive mind.
