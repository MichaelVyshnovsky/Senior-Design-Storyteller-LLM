        "mainbody": "afelnoseikedehnaar, also known as Winter Fang was one of the oldest living white dragons, who prolonged his existence using the Old Ones Word of Power artifact.\nWinter Fang was a cruel creature who felt superior to shorter-lived beings. Even at the wyrms ancient age, Mafelnoseikedehnaar was terrified of aging, the fear that eventually led Winter Fang to exist within a magical snowglobe.\nMafelnoseikedehnaar possessed all the abilities of an ancient white dragon, as well as advanced arcane knowledge of the Creator Races.\nThe entirety of the pocket world inside the magic snowglobe was under full control of Mafelnoseikedehnaar. There the dragon reigned over eternally battling, dying, and reborn dwarves and dryads. The dragon kept the ancient artifact, the Word of Power, close by at all times.\nMafelnoseikedehnaar originated in Torils ancient times, hatched at some point long after the Creator Race that ruled north Faerun vanished from the face of the world. Through the course of his long life, the white dragon developed a fear of death. When Winter Fang felt the first signs of old age enfeeble him, the dragon made a vow to not let the natural weakness of mortality to conquer him.\nWinter Fang sought out an ancient Creator Race artifact, one of the Words of Power. The dragon used it to create a pocket world, a haven from the ravages of time, that would keep Winter Fang alive indefinitely. Mafelnoseikedehnaar harnessed the artifacts power to achieve immortality and gave eternal life to dwarf and dryad slaves to keep the dragon entertained. Mafelnoseikedehnaar and the slaves all vanished from Toril and remained eternally alive within a magic snow-globe, a pocket world of the white dragons design.\nBy 1372 DR, Mafelnoseikedehnaar was one of the oldest dragons in the Realms when the Hero of Neverwinter embarked on a quest to retrieve the Creator Races Words of Power in order to stop Morag, the Queen of the Old Ones. Winter Fang did not desire to release the artifact, as he would eventually die of old age without it, which led to the confrontation that the ancient white dragon did not survive."
