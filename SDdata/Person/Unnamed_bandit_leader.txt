This '''unnamed bandit leader''' was a [[human]] bandit in the [[Bandit camp (Mere of Dead Men)|bandit camp]] near the [[Mere of Dead Men]] on the [[Sword Coast North]].

==History==
When the [[Kalach-Cha]] came to the bandit leader, the leader was calm, as his plans had been foiled and had no power to resist. The Kalach-Cha had three choices for dealing with the leader: leave him in peace, kill him, or persuade him to join the [[Graycloaks of Neverwinter]] (the last idea sounding quite insane to him).
