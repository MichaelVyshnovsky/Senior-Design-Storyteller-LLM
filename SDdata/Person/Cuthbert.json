He claimed to have read all of them carefully.\nWhen in combat, Cuthbert wielded a battleaxe and wore steel armor.\nEarl Cuthbert always sent his taxes to Castle Hartwick on time, a matter that did not go unnoticed by the queen.\nIn 1366 DR, when Princess Brianna returned from her abduction by Goboka, Cuthbert was one of the first of the earls to support Brianna in deposing her father King Camden.\nDuring the battle in Cuthbert Castle against the false Prince Arlien, Earl Cuthbert tried to buy the queen, Tavis, and Avner time by blocking the doorway to the folio room. His battleaxe was unable to break through Arliens magic armor, and the ettin slew him with a single blow that cleaved both his armor and his sternum."
