Haldan was a thief in Bloodstone Village in 1357 DR.
Haldan was the main source of gossip in the village (often inaccurate). He liked to stay at the Inn of the Clowns.
In 1356 DR, Haldan collaborated with a bandit army for some money. In 1357 DR, he was not impressed by Gareth Dragonsbanes party.
Haldan wanted to always be with the winning side. He did not believe in Gareth Dragonsbanes chances of victory against the bandit army, so he agreed to work for them if they would pay him.
