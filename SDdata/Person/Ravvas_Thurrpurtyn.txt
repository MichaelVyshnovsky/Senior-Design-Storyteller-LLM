During the late 1350's [[DR]], '''{{PAGENAME}}''' was the owner of the [[Whistling Wizard]] inn located in [[Voonlar]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|33}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 28: The Recent and Colorful History of the Wizard}}

==Personality==
Ravvas was a snobbish young son of a wealthy family who felt he was privileged over others. He was thin and had a nasal voice that accentuated his arrogant nature. He was often disdainful or cruel to those he considered lower in status. He had a tendency to spend money frivolously.

==History==
Sometime after coming of age, Ravvas's father got fed up with his wastrel of a son and sent him away from [[Selgaunt]] with a final gift of money and instructions to never come back. Ravvas found himself in Voonlar in the winter of the [[1356 DR|Year of the Worm, 1356 DR]], around the date the owner of the Whistling Wizard inn, [[Ansilber Klauthaudra]], was dismembered in the common room of his establishment. Within a [[tenday]] of the grisly murder, Ravvas bought the inn and took over running the Wizard.

The [[Harpers]] believed that Ravvas was killed and impersonated by an agent of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] sometime after he left Selgaunt or soon after he bought the Whistling Wizard, which puts his actual death date in 1356 or [[1357 DR]]. They also believed that this unnamed agent was himself assassinated and replaced by a [[malaugrym]] for purposes unknown. In any case, over the next few years the Whistling Wizard became a nexus for nefarious groups, such as the Red Wizards, the [[Cult of the Dragon]], the [[Zhentarim]], and the [[Tarntar]], to meet and conduct business.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|35}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 30: Endgame at the Wizard}}
