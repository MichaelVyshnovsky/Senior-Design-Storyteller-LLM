        "History": "''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], the ship on which Castisha worked was transporting a group of [[adventurers]] from [[Leilon]] to the [[Thunder Cliffs]]. Around the same time, Castisha and a number of other crew members were dissatisfied with their captain, prompting Castisha to lead a mutiny during the passage. She attempted to take control of the ship, but offered the captain a chance to leave the ship safely. Despite the mutiny, she wanted to abide by the terms of the contract that had been agreed upon with the adventurers."
