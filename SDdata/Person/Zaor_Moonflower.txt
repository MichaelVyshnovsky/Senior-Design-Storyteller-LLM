'''Zaor Moonflower''' was a [[moon elf]] and the husband of Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] and the king of [[Evermeet]].

Zaor had long dark-blue locks of hair and his eyes were blue, flecked with gold. He was exceedingly tall for an [[elf]], standing over {{SI|6|feet|long=yes}}, with a frame as muscular as a [[human]] warrior. His height and physique were inherited by his eldest sons [[Zhoron Moonflower|Zhoron]] and [[Xharlion Moonflower|Xharlion]], as well as his youngest son, [[Lamruil Moonflower]].
