Vedoran was an accomplished shadar-kai warrior from Ikemmu in the Shadowfell.  Although most inhabitants of Ikemmu worhip Tempus, Vedoran didnt have strong faith in any god.  He utilized Beshabas temple for healing and schemed with Traedis, Beshabas priest, to start an uprising in the city.
In 1479 DR, Uwan appointed Vedoran the leader of an expedition to investigate the disappearance of a scouting party lead by the witch Ilvani.  He was accompanied by several young Shadar-kai warriors including Ashok, who had been found near death in the Shadowfell several months previous.
The group found the Shadar-kai enclave in which Ilvani was held prisoner and during the rescue mission, Vedoran correctly guessed that the enclave belonged to Ashoks clan.  Vedoran took the information to Traedis who encouraged him to frame Ashok as a traitor to Ikemmu.  Vedoran took an oath to Beshaba with the intent of starting a revolt in Ikemmu.  Vedoran later had a heated argument with Tempus high priest Natan and killed the cleric.  Vedoran denounced Ashok as a traitor and murderer to Uwan and Uwan found Ashok guilty and sentenced him to imprionment for ten days, a sentence that could kill a Shadar-Kai who must have constant stimulus to avoid fading to oblivion.
Vedoran went to Ashoks cell with the intention of killing him but was surprised by Uwan.  The two fought and Vedoran seriously injured Uwan.  However, Ashok was able to kill Vedoran.
