Asojano was a chimera that dwelled within the realm of Avernus within the Nine Hells in the late 15 century DR. Asojano made its home within a colossal dragon skull near the Monument to Tiamat.
Asojano was an ally of the dragonborn Arkhan the Cruel around 1494 DR. Like Arkhan, Asojano lived its life in services to the deity Tiamat.
