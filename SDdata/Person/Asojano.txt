'''Asojano''' was a [[chimera]] that dwelled within the realm of [[Avernus]] within the [[Nine Hells]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Asojano made its home within a colossal [[dragon]] skull near the [[Monument to Tiamat]].

Asojano was an ally of the [[dragonborn]] [[Arkhan|Arkhan the Cruel]] around [[1494 DR]]. Like Arkhan, Asojano lived its life in services to the deity [[Tiamat]].
