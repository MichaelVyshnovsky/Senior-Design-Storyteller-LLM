'''Beliarge''' was a [[Zhentarim]] [[mage]] of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
At the time of his death, he wore a dark robe and many rings. He often sported a cruel smile.

==Personality==
To [[Fzoul Chembryl]], Beliarge was ambitious and capable enough to be a threat. To foes at a disadvantage, he acted courteous but arrogant.

==Abilities==
He knew a spell of paralyzation that was powerful enough to hold even [[Storm Silverhand]], and which would not be affected by anything he did, even if he ran her through in plain view.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|234-236|14}}

==History==
In late {{yearlink|1357}}, Fzoul Chembryl sent [[Beliarge]] to attack [[Tessaril's Tower]] and capture [[Shandril Shessair]] after the destruction of [[Iliph Thraun]], urging him to attack while her [[spellfire]] was depleted. He materialized in the location shortly afterwards, striking [[Tessaril Winter]] and [[Storm Silverhand]] with a paralyzing spell of his own devising, powerful enough to hold the two of them; Shandril instead escaped into the [[Hidden House]] of [[Eveningstar]]. There, she ambushed him with a sword, managing to get a decisive kill before he could react.
