        "mainbody": "Reverend Father '''Benentine Boldoran''' was the leader of the [[Ilmatari]] monastic order known as the [[Ramedaran Brotherhood]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}. He administered the [[Cloister of St. Ramedar]], a combination prison and sanitarium in the [[Starspire Mountains]] of [[Tethyr]].",
        "Description": "Father Benentine was a rotund, balding man, as of 1370 DR. He ate often and kept his bald pate polished. He wore simple clothes, having taken a vow of poverty.",
        "Personality": "The leader of the Ramedarans had a keen wit and a boisterous sense of humor, which he used to drive his staff with lighthearted cajolery and verbally fence with nobles and rulers that didn't agree with his methods or mission. He believed in the tenets put forth by [[Saint Ramedar]]â€”that the penal system should serve the public by rehabilitating criminals, reforming and educating them to reenter society, rather than be used as an instrument of retribution or a specter of deterrence.",
        "Abilities": "Despite his round belly, Father Benentine was an expert in many martial art styles.",
        "Possessions": "Having taken a vow of poverty, the Reverend Father had very few possessions of any value.",
        "Activities": "Father Benentine was in charge of about 115 other monks and [[painbearer]]s that resided and worked in the Cloister, and together they guarded and cared for approximately 225 prisoners (both criminal and political) and mentally ill patients.",
        "Relationships": "Benentine's humble nature and good humor in dealing with his subordinates earned him the great respect and loyalty of this staff, even as he drove them to meet exacting his exacting standards.  He was devotedly doting to his pet [[tressym]], [[Timoni]], who had free run of the echoing hallways and chambers of the Cloister. Only Father Benentine knew that Timoni was actually a young [[bronze dragon]] named Cuprantimonitinam."
