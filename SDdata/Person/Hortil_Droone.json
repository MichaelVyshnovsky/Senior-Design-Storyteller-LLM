        "mainbody": "Hortil Droone was the Magister from  to .\nHe was cruel and quick-witted.\nBefore slaying the previous Magister, he was a mage-for-hire, a veteran warmage. Once the mantle of the Magister passed on to him, he slew a number of rivals, then faked his death and his in a city somewhere in the Shining Seas coast, where he posed as a wealthy merchant, \"Nelver Kulcharvin\", investing in a number of local businesses, including costers and a barrelworks. Through this time he improved his magic, until he finally suspected the Magister had things to do.\nHis prayers to Mystra were answered by Azuth, who revealed to him that a Magister whose service was good was one who spread magic. In response, Hortil used magic to disguise himself, prepared a cache of scrolls and a scheme to introduce magic to twenty-some apprentices. Then he began to pose as a \"Immgar Orlam\", a hedge wizard in a traveling carnival, who played with children after each performance selecting only those who were fascinated more than afraid, he found a number of candidates. Unfortunately, while visiting one of his older apprentices, he was ambushed by the sorceress Phambra Chalyphar, who slew him.\nAfter his death, Hortil Droone wanted to keep teaching, but Mystra refused. Of the possible fates he was offered, he became instead the Royal Crown of Westgate."
