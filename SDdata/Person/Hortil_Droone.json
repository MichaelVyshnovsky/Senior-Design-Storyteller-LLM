        "History": "Before slaying the previous [[Magister]], he was a mage-for-hire, a veteran warmage. Once the mantle of the Magister passed on to him, he slew a number of rivals, then faked his death and his in a city somewhere in the [[Shining Sea]]'s coast, where he posed as a wealthy merchant, \"Nelver Kulcharvin\", investing in a number of local businesses, including costers and a barrelworks. Through this time he improved his magic, until he finally suspected the [[Magister]] had things to do.\n\nHis prayers to [[Mystra]] were answered by [[Azuth]], who revealed to him that a Magister whose service was good was one who spread magic. In response, Hortil used magic to disguise himself, prepared a cache of scrolls and a scheme to introduce magic to twenty-some apprentices. Then he began to pose as a \"Immgar Orlam\", a hedge wizard in a traveling carnival, who played with children after each performance; selecting only those who were fascinated more than afraid, he found a number of candidates. Unfortunately, while visiting one of his older apprentices, he was ambushed by the sorceress [[Phambra Chalyphar]], who slew him.\n\nAfter his death, Hortil Droone wanted to keep teaching, but Mystra refused. Of the possible fates he was offered, he became instead the Royal Crown of [[Westgate]]."
