Ekuriyah Abd al-Wajib was the general of the Dutiful Mamluk Society in Qudra in 1367 DR.
She served as the active voice for the Dutiful on the Mamluk Council because Hatit Abd al-Wajibs duties as emir prevented him from having a say on council matters.
Ekuriyah was the protege of emir Hatit Abd al-Wajib,
