'''Imsha''' was a [[sorceress]] and [[cleric]] of [[Chauntea]] and a [[Hathran]] of the [[Witches of Rashemen]].

==Activities==
She and the other telthor, [[Tamlith]], provided wisdom and guidance to the living witches of Rashemen. They talked only of important matters, especially the security of Rashemen, and didn't like idle chatter.

==History==
{{Incomplete|The article lacks the information from ''[[Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer]]''}}
In death, her spirit became one of two [[telthor]]s tied to the [[Red Tree]], a legendary [[aspen]] tree located within the [[Immil Vale]] in [[Rashemen]], by [[1372 DR]].
