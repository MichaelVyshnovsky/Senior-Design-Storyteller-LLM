        "Activities": "He was a retired battle [[wizard]] and at some point in his past lost one of his legs and didn't get it magically replaced. It was suspected that he paid a large amount of his profits to the Ruling Council of the city in order for the more blasphemous of the seedier elements of his business to be allowed to passâ€”keeping female drow slaves for prostitution."
