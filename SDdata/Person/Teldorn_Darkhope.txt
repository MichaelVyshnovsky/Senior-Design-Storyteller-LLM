Teldorn Darkhope was the ruler of the city of Mintar, having conquered it with a Zhentarim-sponsored army of Iyachtu Xvim, before 1372 DR.
After the conquest on Mintar, Teldorn, and Fzoul Chembryl forged the artifact known as the Scepter of the Tyrants Eye.
His presence in Mintarn, and his vow to slay any who opposed him, forced the Pursuers of Knowledge within the city to hinder his goals by covert methods.
