        "Activities": "Drivvin was the main advisor of his sister [[Erelal Freth]] in her plans to conquer all Undermountain, especially against [[House Auvryndar]]. Usually he resided inside [[Spiderwatch Keep]], the main Freth headquarters in the [[Maze Level]] with his sister.",
        "History": "Around the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]] after a series of very devastating battles, Drivvin was busy with devising a way to summon a [[goristo]] in order to impress the [[minotaur]]s that were enemies of House Freth, by convincing them that he had summoned an envoy of [[Baphomet]] and they must obey him. However he knew he did not have the magical abilities to succeed alone. [[Tendra Nightblade]] and [[Mateen Shadowdusk]] offered him the help of [[Halaster Blackcloak]] himself in the matter in exchange for Drivvin becoming his next assistant. Drivvin was conflicted because he didn't want abandon his House to go with Halaster."
