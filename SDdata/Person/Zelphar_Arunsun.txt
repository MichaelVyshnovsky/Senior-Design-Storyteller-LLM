Cassandra Thann
Zelphar Arunsun was a powerful human wizard, originally from Neverwinter. He was the son of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun and married Lhestyn. His children were Khelben Arunsun the Younger, who was often confused with the Blackstaff, and Cassandra Thann, matriarch of the winemaking House Thann. Zelphar was killed by magical means, although his killer was never discovered.

In 1311 DR, Zelphar was killed by Bigbys crushing hand, a spell cast by a lich of the Twisted Rune, as a favor to the Shadow Thieves.
