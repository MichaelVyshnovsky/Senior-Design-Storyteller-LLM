        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Bowser attended the year-end celebration festival in the town of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]]. The alesmith took his first attempt at winemaking â€“ [[Dark Maiden Wine]], to the wine-tasting and grading competition. Even though the completion rules dictated Bowser could only bring one variety of wine, they said nothing about ale, so the dwarf brought all twelve types of ales of his making."
