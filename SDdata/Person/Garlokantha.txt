Garlokantha was a gold dragon living in the Forest of Tethir as late as 1370 DR. She was saved by the Company of Eight in 1354 DR from the hands of some evil adventurers, including the drow Tleobar.
Garlokantha preferred isolation and lived alone in her cave in the northeastern region of the forest, but about once every four years, she would take a humanoid form and travel through Tethyr and Amn to observe other races.
