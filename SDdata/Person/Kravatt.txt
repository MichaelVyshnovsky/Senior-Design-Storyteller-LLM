{{quote|''I could drop' my coinpurse - maybe that'd spice things up a bit.''|Kravatt}}

==Description==
Kravatt was a light-skinned [[gnome]] with long brown curly hair. He had dark brown eyes and grossed in fanciful jackets and vests.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, the gates between the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate and its more affluent [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] were closed, monitored by the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries and allowing only the wealthy and current residents of the Upper City through. Kravatt was among the Baldurians who sought passage to the Upper City, suffering through the long lines and rude Fists. While in line, Kravatt contemplated "accidentally" dropping a pouch of [[silver]] [[coin]]s to "invigorate" tired Fists and speed up the queue.
