Niwa Sutai was a samurai member of the Niwa clan and overseer of Kabe in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
In Kabe, he led a company of four samurai and ten bushi. He also commanded two warships, each with ten sailors and fifteen bushi. All these armed men upset the villagers, who needed to provide food for Sutai and all his men.
Sutai was the nephew of Niwa Hirotada and the great-great-grandson of the great Niwa Ozuchi, who saved the charters of the Niwa line.
