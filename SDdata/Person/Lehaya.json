Since such individuals were usually nobles, Lehaya balanced things by frequently pardoning commoners brought before her for minor crimes minor offenses. Because of her famous \"mercy\", she was given the nickname \"Mother Law.\"\nLehaya used her fame to hide her extracurricular interest studying the Virushead, \nIn 1479 DR, as Queen Arathane opposed the experimentation with the Virushead, and fearing the other Stewards will not support her, Lehaya sent her wizards to study the Virushead in secret. \nWhen the threat of a war between Akanûl and Tymanther became inminent later that year, Lehaya was the only one of the Stewards who didnt wanted to battle against the dragonborn. However, she did not oppose her fellow Stewards when they decided to sent the army to help Tchazzar against the Tymantherans."
