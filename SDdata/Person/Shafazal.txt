Shafazal was a shair inhabiting the deserts near the Free City of Muluk in .
Shafazal was short at  and chubby. She usually wore at least a dozen pieces of jewelry which jingled every time she moved. She enjoyed exotic perfumes.
Shafazals familiar was a fanatical sand gen named Abdul.
Shafazal owned an astrolabe of entrapment, a jellaba of scintillating colors, a wand of magic missiles, a wand of polymorphing, a scroll of protection from genies, and two potions of healing.
Originally from Huzuz, Shafazal spent much time adventuring and studying magic before she decided to settle down and construct her own tower. She hoped to attract the attention of an architect genie to aid in this process.
