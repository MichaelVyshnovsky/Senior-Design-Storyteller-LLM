'''Shafazal''' was a [[sha'ir]] inhabiting the deserts near the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free City]] of [[Muluk]] in {{Yearlink|1367}}.{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Shafazal was short at {{SI|4'11|'"|c|long=yes}} and chubby. She usually wore at least a dozen pieces of jewelry which jingled every time she moved. She enjoyed exotic perfumes.

==Relationships==
Shafazal's [[familiar]] was a fanatical [[sand gen]] named [[Abdul]].

==Possessions==
Shafazal owned an ''[[astrolabe of entrapment]]'', a ''[[Robe of scintillating colors|jellaba of scintillating colors]]'', a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]'', a ''[[wand of polymorphing]]'', a ''[[scroll of protection from genies]]'', and two ''[[Potion of healing|potions of healing]]''.

==Activities==
Originally from [[Huzuz]], Shafazal spent much time adventuring and studying magic before she decided to settle down and construct her own tower. She hoped to attract the attention of an [[architect genie]] to aid in this process.
