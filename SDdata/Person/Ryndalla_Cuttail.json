After narrowly escaping from the clutches of [[Agarta the Breaker]] and her arena, Ryndalla helped organize a counterattack with the surviving Rats against the [[Battlemaster's Arenas]]. She sent a team guided in by [[Martildae]] in order to rescue any captive Riverside Rats, resulting in a deadly confrontation with Agarta in her own arena."
