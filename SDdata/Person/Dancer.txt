Dancer was a goblin lookout in the Western Heartlands.
Dancer had yellow-brown skin and light blue tattoos over his body. He wore heavy armor and a matching helmet. He appeared to be fairly laid-back.
In the late 15 century DR, Dancer patrolled a cliff ledge that led into a goblin camp. The camp housed several goblinoid members of the Cult of the Absolute.
