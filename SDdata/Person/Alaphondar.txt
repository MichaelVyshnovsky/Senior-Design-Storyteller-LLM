Lord '''Alaphondar Emmarask''' was one of the leading [[sage]]s in service to the royalty of [[Cormyr]] in [[Suzail]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Alaphondar had a magical stone that could summon the High Wizard [[Vangerdahast]].

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], during the [[abraxus affair]], Alaphondar was disguised as a stooped, stout merchant with missing teeth. He assumed the name of "Flammos Galdekund", so that he and Queen [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]] could hide in [[Waterdeep]] until the plot against the crown could be resolved.
