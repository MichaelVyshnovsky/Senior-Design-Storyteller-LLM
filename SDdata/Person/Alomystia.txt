'''Alomystia''' was a [[ranger]] of the [[Reaching Woods]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

In the mid-1200s DR, Alomystia was in the possession of the Walking Tower, believed to be a relic of ancient [[Netheril]]. It took the form of a massive statue, standing many stories tall, and it wandered the Reaching Woods seemingly at random or as if seeking something. Alomystia's fate is unknown.
