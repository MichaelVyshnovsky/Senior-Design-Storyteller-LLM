        "mainbody": "'''Haerun Mhammaster''' (or \"Haerund\") was a historian and sage of [[Waterdeep]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "His main field of expertise was in history and the culture of [[demihuman]]s, namely [[dwarves]], [[elves]], [[gnome]]s, and [[halfling]]s, including their art, music, legends, and folklore.  He was also knowledgeable in [[cryptography]] and the [[architecture]] and [[engineering]] of dungeons and subterranean constructions.",
        "Description": "Greatly aged, he was hunchbacked, shrunken, and wrinkled. He was said to be as dusty as his books.",
        "Activities": "Staying always within his library, Haerund didn't seek out clients. Instead, he had friends at the [[Elfsong Tavern]] close by who, if they found trustworthy folks in need of his aid, sent them to his door.",
        "Home": "He lived in a rowhouse on the [[Street of Bells]] in the [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]]. His rooms and library were musty and dusty, but contained many pieces of [[elf]]-made statuary.",
        "Relations": "[[Johanna Kherrispehril]] was his apprentice for a time some time prior to [[1368 DR]]."
