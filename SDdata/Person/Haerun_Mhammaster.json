        "mainbody": "Haerun Mhammaster (or \"Haerund\") was a historian and sage of Waterdeep in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHis main field of expertise was in history and the culture of demihumans, namely dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings, including their art, music, legends, and folklore.  He was also knowledgeable in cryptography and the architecture and engineering of dungeons and subterranean constructions.\nGreatly aged, he was hunchbacked, shrunken, and wrinkled. He was said to be as dusty as his books.\nStaying always within his library, Haerund didnt seek out clients. Instead, he had friends at the Elfsong Tavern close by who, if they found trustworthy folks in need of his aid, sent them to his door.\nHe lived in a rowhouse on the Street of Bells in the Castle Ward. His rooms and library were musty and dusty, but contained many pieces of elf-made statuary.\nJohanna Kherrispehril was his apprentice for a time some time prior to 1368 DR."
