        "mainbody": "ujibar, or more commonly known as Mujibar the Foolish in a legendary cautionary tale, was a rogue of the Ul-shim Guild in Calimport, who lived in the late 13 century DR.\nBy the , Mujibar accumulated a crippling amount of gambling debt to various dangerous underground organizations of Calimshan that threatened his life. In desperation, he turned to a powerful dao merchant named Khan Zohrin-Ka. The djinn offered Mujibar a gamble – a simple card game of chance. If Mujibar won, all of his debts would be paid off. If Zohrin-Ka won, then the rogue would owe the djinn his soul.\nThe game they played consisted of ninety cards, numbered from one through nine on ten cards each. Each player was to roll two dice and pull the number of the cards dictated by the roll. The cards were drawn from the decks top, and the lowest overall sum added from the cards won. The game started with Khan rolling \"2\" and drawing \"7\" and \"4\". When Mujibar rolled, his result was \"10,\" and he carefully drew ten cards from the deck without looking at the numbers and not showing them to the opponent. To everyones shock – the rogue pulled all cards marked with \"1\", making the total less than that of the djinni.\nRelieved, Mujibar demanded his winnings while Khan raged. The elemental merchant was bound to obey the deal and pay, but that didnt mean Zohrin-Ka could not kill his opponent first for stacking the deck and cheating. Mujibar was cut down by Zohrin-Kas scimitar, his pockets were filled with the winning money, and his body – was dumped in a shady alley in  Calimport.\nThree days later, the rogues body remained in the alley, but the gold was all gone. Instead, the coins were replaced by thousands of empty ale bottles, remnants of a party of legendary proportions, still told by Calimports drunks well into the late 14 century DR. Poor and drunks of Calimshan were hopeful for another Mujibar the Foolish.\nIn the , the game set of Mujibar the Foolish was displayed in the curio shop that belonged to a planeswalking wizard Mintassan in the city of Westgate. Mujibars legend was written on a neat little plaque near the card deck."
