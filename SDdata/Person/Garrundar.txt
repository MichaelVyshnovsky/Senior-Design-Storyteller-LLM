'''Garrundar the Vile''' was an old [[black dragon]] who made his home in the [[Pirates' Skyhold|Pirate's Skyhold]] north of [[Neverwinter]].

==History==
At one time, the sky pirates of [[Bartholomew Blackdagger]] tried to capture Garrundar but they failed spectacularly and the black dragon pursued them back to their hideout. Garrundar took control of the [[lizardfolk]] that lived there and he weaved a powerful [[spell]] that cursed the pirates into undeath and bound them. In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Company Yargo]], needing a base and more sky ships, sent an adventurer to confront the dragon. The adventurer fought and killed him.
