{{quote|Back to work, ya worthless slugs!|Tobias}}

==History==
One day in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Tobias oversaw a chain-gang of prisoners as they cut blocks of ice from a river. He ordered [[Holga Kilgore]] and [[Edgin Darvis]] to shut up and get back to work. Then, when a prisoner fell through the ice into the river below, threatening to pull the whole chain-gang in after him, Tobias broke the [[chain]] with his [[longsword]], sacrificing the prisoner to save the others. Tobias just told them to return to work. Edgin opined he was in a bad mood that day.

==Description==
He was huge.
