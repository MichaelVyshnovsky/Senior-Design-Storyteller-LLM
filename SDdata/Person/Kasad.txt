Kasad, or One-Eye Kasad, was a disfigured human sergeant of the watch in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
A bar fight during his youth left Kasad with a ghastly facial injury and the loss of an eye.
Kasads greed meant that he was easily bribed as a guard.
Since his disfigurement left his social life rather lacking, Kasad always seemed to be on duty at one of the gates or participating in civil patrols. He bore his fate well, attacking his work with stoic determination.
Kasad wore lamellar armor and wielded a magical scimitar.
