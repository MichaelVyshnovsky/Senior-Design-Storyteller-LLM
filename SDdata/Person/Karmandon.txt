'''Karmandon''' was a [[Netherese]] [[rogue]] and fashionista who owned [[Karmandon's Finery]] in [[Karsus Enclave]] until its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Personality==
Karmandon was a skilled and relentless pathological liar. He was particularly adept at verbally backstabbing his own associates, then denying all wrongdoing through a combination of logical reasoning and rhetorical agility. Despite these efforts, he was still well-known as an prolific liar.

==Activities==
Karmandon sold fashionable clothing, sets of jewelry, and other accoutrements, but his shop started to shrink with the rise of [[Chanragoupta's Exotic]]. Unable to compete in the field of business, he turned to vicious rumor-mongering in the hopes of destroying his rival's reputation.
