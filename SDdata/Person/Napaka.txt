Nine trickster gods
Queen Napaka was the last monarch to rule over the city of Omu in Chult. Her reign ended upon her death, which occurred some time during or before the late 14 century DR.
Queen Napaka believed it was her divine right to conquer the people and lands beyond her city. In life and in death, she wanted nothing more for the city of Omu to thrive.
Like the people of her city, Napaka worshipped the Nine trickster gods, and believed they watched over her people, in place of Ubtao, the lost patron of Chultan pantheon. Over time she came to learn they were not true deities, but charlatans that tricked the Omuan people.
The queen was entombed in a black, burial dress and adorned with a mask that resembled a hornet.
Napaka was the granddaughter of Zalkoré, the former queen of Omu who was transformed into a medusa and resided within the ruins of Nangalore.
She was herself grandmother to Nepartak, who died when she was only ten years old, and the great-grandmother of Princess Mwaxanaré.
Napaka was served dutifully by her bodyguard Lukanu, who was unfortunately trapped within a mirror of life trapping when the city of Omu fell.
When Queen Napaka was in her later years, the malevolent lich Acererak decided to slay the Nine trickster gods and subjugate the citizens of Omu. The queen refused to abandon her people, but rather offered herself to the undead overlord, in an attempt to spare their lives. Acererak did not accept the terms, but was so impressed by Napakas selflessness that―after slaying her―he placed her remains within a special crypt in the Chambers of Horror in the Tomb of the Nine Gods.
