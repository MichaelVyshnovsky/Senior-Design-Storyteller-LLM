        "mainbody": "Tazmon Iridar was a fisherman inhabiting the city of Yhep along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe was actually a spy sent by an unknown party from the city of Derlusk within the Border Kingdoms. By 1370 DR, Tazmon was tasked with discovering the secret behind Yheps lucrative scarlet pearl trade. Barring that, Tazmon would attempt to steal several of the pearls and bring them back to Derlusk."
