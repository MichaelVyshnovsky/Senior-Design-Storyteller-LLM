        "mainbody": "Daeghun Farlong was a male elven inhabitant of West Harbor on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR.\nFollowing his wifes death, Daeghun was grim and harsh, especially to his foster child, the Kalach-Cha. He expects his orders to be respected and completed. Nevertheless, he was shown to be sensitive, as he defended the Kalach-Cha from being attacked by the undead and went to search for his foster child after the attack on the Mere of Merdalain.\nAn eminently skilled ranger, Daeghun was considered to be one of the finest archers around the Mere of Dead Men. He favored the use of the longbow in combat and was not above using poison on his arrows.\nDaeghun often went into the swamp to hunt animals, to trade their fur with the merchants. He attended the Archery Contest at the Harvest Fair. Finally, he joined the defense at Crossroad Keep, to scout out the enemy.\nHe was the adoptive father of the Kalach-Cha, and the half-brother of Duncan.\nDaeghun was a scout of West Harbor, who was skilled with the bow. He was a friend of the Kalach-Chas mother, Esmerelle, and had a wife, Sheila. However, both women were lost in the First Shadow War. Due to this, Daeghun adopted the Kalach-Cha, but remained grim.\nHe raised the Kalach-Cha as a villager. During the Harvest Fair of 1374 DR, he tasked the Kalach-Cha to trade with Galen for a duskwood bow. He also oversaw the Archery Contest, where people could shot bottles as targets. When bladelings and duergar attacked, he attacked the last wave, then healed the surviving villagers. He ordered the Kalach-Cha to retrieve a silver shard, then to go to Neverwinter to Deaghuns half-brother, Duncan.\nWhen the Kalach-Cha became a Knight Captain, Daeghun enlisted himself for the aid of Crossroad Keep, scouting on the enemy. He also aided his adoptive child when Garius ordered the undead to attack. After hearing about the news of the fate of the King of Shadows and his adoptive child, Daeghun went to search for the Kalach-Cha.\nWhen the Kalach-Cha returned to the village, Daeghun was glad his adoptive child was alive. And may attend the wedding of his child with Gann/Safiya."
