'''Ilsa Wisemantle''' was a [[noble]] from [[Neverwinter]] who had an interest in the safety of [[Phandalin]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|38}}{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|49}}

==Personality==
Ilsa was brave and kind. She sought to help those who needed it, even [[evil]] creatures, and would throw herself in harm's way to protect others despite the fact that was not a warrior.

She had some knowledge about medical care.

==Activities==
While investigating goings-on around Phandalin, Ilsa took up residence in a sparsely furnished cave at the base of the [[Sword Mountains]] which had once been home to a group of [[yuan-ti]] who had been driven out by an [[Gavmogon|unknown entity]] and subsequently captured some of the people of Phandalin to transform into fellow monsters.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|33}}

==Relationships==
Ilsa was a friend of [[Sildar Hallwinter]], and became a trusted ally of the [[Town Council of Phandalin]].

==History==
Following [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s publication of ''[[Volo's Guide to Monsters (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to Monsters]]'', in which he highlighted the town of Phandalin,{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|6}} Ilsa began to take an interest in the town. She arrived in the town shortly after to investigate a spate of troubles plaguing the town, including monster attacks, strange [[magic]]s, and virulent madness. Unknown to her, many of these were caused by the machinations of the [[beholder]] [[Gavmogon]]. 

She first took up residence in a cave that had been used by yuan-ti who had briefly terrorized the region. There, she soon befriended a sick [[mind flayer]] named [[Cerali]], who was driven from its colony aboard a downed [[nautiloid]] in the Sword Mountains after its [[elder brain]] was driven mad. She nursed the mind flayer back to health until Sildar Hallwinter was able to send a group of [[adventurer]]s to help remove the threat to the region posed by the elder brain. She then returned to Phandalin to continue her investigations.

She subsequently heard rumors of an explorer named [[Aladair]], who was likewise investigating the threats to Phandalin. She learned that Aladair believed that the chaos and madness in the region was being caused by a beholder (Gavmogon) lairing beneath a temple near [[Wave Echo Cave]], and subsequently came to agree with this assessment after Aladair disappeared into said lair. She took her information to the Town Council of Phandalin, and helped a group of [[adventurer]]s find the lair.
