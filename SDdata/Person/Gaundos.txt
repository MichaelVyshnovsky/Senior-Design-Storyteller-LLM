'''Gaundos''' was a strange [[illusionist]] and follower of [[Leira]] inhabiting [[Waterdeep]], City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Gaundos went to extremes to ensure that no one knew anything about him including what he really looked like, where he lived, etc. He employed the ''[[change self]]'' [[spell]] frequently to disguise his appearance, usually several times per day. Gaundos could be contacted via the bartender [[Elgorel]], whom he spoke often with, at the [[Swords' Rest]] [[tavern]] in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Southern Ward|Southern Ward]]. He would tutor others in the use of [[magic]] and cast spells for a fee in order to raise money to further his own pursuit of [[illusion]] magic.

==Possessions==
Gaundos always wore a ''[[necklace of missiles]]'' for protection.
