        "mainbody": "'''Turadaer''' was a [[brass dragon]] who was mentioned in legends about [[Stormwreck Isle]].",
        "History": "Turadaer was one of the three great [[metallic dragon]]s who defeated the great [[red dragon]] [[Sharruth]] long ago. Legends say that he, the [[bronze dragon]] [[Astalagan]], and the [[gold dragon]] [[Clyssavar]] joined forces to battle Sharruth and confined her beneath the ocean floor.\n\nIt is unknown how exactly Turadaer died, but it was centuries prior to the late 1400s [[DR]]. At that time, on Stormwreck Isle there was a [[Dragon's Rest|cove with a magic pool]] still giving restoration to those entering its waters. It was the place of death of a brass dragon, presumably Turadaer.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1481}},{{Stormwreck-time}}, a [[blue dragon]] [[Dragon aging|wyrmling]] named [[Sparkrender]] had taken up residence in the [[Clifftop Observatory]] on Stormwreck Isle and attempted to harness the power of the island's fallen dragons. For this cause, he ordered his [[kobold]] followers [[Mek]] and [[Minn (kobold)|Minn]] to build and paint sculptures of the five great dragons, Turadaer among them. When a group of adventurers attempted to stop the wyrmling's ritual, the effigy of Turadaer provided the power of the long-dead dragonâ€”'Turadaer's Tricks' caused the adventurers and a bronze wyrmling named [[Aidron]] to shimmer and spark with brass-hued light."
