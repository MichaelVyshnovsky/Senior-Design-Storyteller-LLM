        "mainbody": "Turadaer was a brass dragon who was mentioned in legends about Stormwreck Isle.\nTuradaer was one of the three great metallic dragons who defeated the great red dragon Sharruth long ago. Legends say that he, the bronze dragon Astalagan, and the gold dragon Clyssavar joined forces to battle Sharruth and confined her beneath the ocean floor.\nIt is unknown how exactly Turadaer died, but it was centuries prior to the late 1400s DR. At that time, on Stormwreck Isle there was a cove with a magic pool still giving restoration to those entering its waters. It was the place of death of a brass dragon, presumably Turadaer.\nAs of the ,, a blue dragon wyrmling named Sparkrender had taken up residence in the Clifftop Observatory on Stormwreck Isle and attempted to harness the power of the islands fallen dragons. For this cause, he ordered his kobold followers Mek and Minn to build and paint sculptures of the five great dragons, Turadaer among them. When a group of adventurers attempted to stop the wyrmlings ritual, the effigy of Turadaer provided the power of the long-dead dragonâ€”Turadaers Tricks caused the adventurers and a bronze wyrmling named Aidron to shimmer and spark with brass-hued light."
