        "mainbody": "'''Alvaerele Tasundrym''', also known as the '''Silent Chosen''', was a [[half-elf]] [[wizard]] who was both a [[Magister]] and a [[Chosen of Mystra]].",
        "History": "Alvaerele was a sage who specialized in healing, good food, and beneficial [[herb]]s for [[human]]s and [[demihuman]]s. During her free time, Alvaerele had managed to master minor [[magic]]. She lived in [[Zazesspur]].\n\nIn the {{Yearlink|576}}, after Magister [[Annath Sunfall]] renounced [[Mystra]] and all [[magic]] because of his failed experiments, his position was offered to Alvaerele during a grand feast that she had been invited to in exchange for procuring some rare [[wine]]. When [[Azuth]] appeared before her, two other [[wizard]]s at the feast immediately attacked. Azuth turned away their [[spell]]s, apologized for appearing in such a public place and wiped everyone's memories of his appearance (though onlooking kitchen staff retained theirs). Later, Alvaerele accepted Azuth's offer but timidly informed him that she would concentrate her efforts on her work as a sage over and above her magisterial spellcraft. Azuth loved her for that and she enjoyed his personal protection from then on.\n\nIn the {{Yearlink|592}}, while out collecting herbs, she encountered a sick man. When she went to minister his illness, he spat forth a gout of spell-born [[acid]]. Azuth shielded her from the attack, and Alvaerele petrified the offending mage, turning his acidic spit into an everlasting fountain, creating the site that became known as [[Wizardgout Water]]. Upset at having to mete out similar punishments to her attackers and how they would try to reach her through her friends, she petitioned Mystra for another method to serve. Mystra made Alvaerele a Chosen and [[Ozgor Hyelvel|Ozgor \"the Black Scourge\" Hyelvel]] was granted the position in her stead.\n\nSince then, Alvaerele was tasked with guarding the most powerful secrets of magic, such as the location of the [[Srinshee]]'s resting place. Alvaerele always performed her tasks in an alternate form or invisibly and spent her free time in secluded magical groves, which earned her the moniker of the Silent Chosen.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, Alvaerele helped defend [[Glarondar]] from a [[Thay]]an attack while the [[Simbul]] was away. Five years later, Alvaerele killed twelve [[Red Wizard]]s who were attacking [[Velprintalar]] in an attempt to draw out the [[Simbul]] (who again, was away at the time) and sent the magical trap they were planning to use against rivals of its creators, thereby causing internal strife in [[Thay]].\n\nAlvaerele later participated in the [[High Magic]] Ritual of Myriad on the [[Feast of the Moon]], the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, to cleanse part of the [[High Moor]] and restore [[Faer'tel'miir]], a lost city of [[Miyeritar]]."
