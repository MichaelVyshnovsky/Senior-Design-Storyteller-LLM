'''Farlin''' was a member of [[The Guild]] crime gang in [[Baldur's Gate]] and an Envoy of [[Nine-Fingers]] to the [[Stone Lord]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|Nine-Fingers sends her love, arsehole. Your Stone Lord's a dead man walking.|Farlin}}

==Description==
Farlin was a [[rock gnome]] woman with a pale skin tone and green eyes. She wore a [[leather]] [[helmet]] and [[leather armor]] dyed in [[emerald]]-greenâ€”the Guild's telltale color. She was armed with two [[dagger]]s: a mundane one, and an [[enchanted]] ''[[Gleamdance dagger]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Farlin led a gang of Guild members in dealing with the dreaded [[Stone Lord]] and his men. The new kingpin secretly served the [[Absolute]] and was trying to remove the Guild's influence from across the Gate. Farlin's group faced a band of the Stone Lord's men led by the [[tiefling]] [[Cairos]], under the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge in [[Rivington]], hoping to seize their illegal goods haul. However, the meeting devolved into a battle. Farlin's and her squad's fate remained uncertain, whether they were killed by the gangsters or survived and returned safely to the Guild's safehouse.
