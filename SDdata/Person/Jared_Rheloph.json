        "mainbody": "Jared Rheloph, nicknamed the Pious, was a human cleric of Ilmater and adventurer and a member of the Company of the Sundered Orc in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nFive adventurers—Lorar, Pelops, Jared Rheloph, Cassandra Rulmac, and Wynara Rulmac—came together in Daggerford relatively recently as of 1368 DR and soon headed for Waterdeep, not yet even having a name for their company. En route, they encountered a small orc raiding band and destroyed them, so they named themselves for this event.\nIn Waterdeep, they went to the Yawning Portal inn and began exploring the dungeons of Undermountain as adventurers do. In the , they elected to locate a supposed treasure hoard on the second level, the Arcane Chambers, which the Waterdhavian merchant-adventurer Essimuth Lanys claimed to have sighted. They ventured down the well just after sunset on Eleint 2, and had not yet returned by the end of the month. The Tymoran priest Adama Miiralin stationed at the inn recorded this in his monthly report to High Priestess Seenroas Halvinhar.\nIn fact, all five of them had been captured by drow slavers in the Arcane Chambers and were soon to be transported to Skullport."
