'''Narnorn''' was mysterious [[thief]] who ruled [[Mreyelundar]] in [[1479 DR]].

==Background==
Narnorn was a thief of legendary status in [[Laerakond]], and its true identity was unknown. It was the true power behind the throne of Mreyelundar, although [[Trusk Rantyne]] was in charge of day-to-day government of the city. All the gangs in the city also swore fealty to Narnorn.
