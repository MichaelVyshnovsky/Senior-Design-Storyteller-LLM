Elden Vargas was a businessman in Neverwinter.
Elden was, before the Spellplague a War Wizard of Cormyr. However, to augment his psychic powers he entered into a pact with Asmodeus and when his superior discovered this they attacked Elden. In the battle, Karis, the Rashemi witch wife of Elden, lost her mind, so Elden started planning how cure her.
Soon, he became a successful trader on the Sword Coast, but also joined forces with the Ashmadai cult. In 1479 DR, Elden arrived in Neverwinter with Karis but his wife suffered a collapse and, thanks to Mordai Vell, Elden took her to Helms Hold. However, Mordai used the situation to control the wizard. Elden started having his minions kidnap people in order to conduct experiments on them to one day cure Karis. However, the experiments produced only a number of blabbering idiots. Elden also tried to frame Mordais Ashmadai for the kidnappings.
At last, he found a possible cure for Karis and invaded Helms Hold with his mind-thrall minions, including Chartilifax, to retake her. He performed a ritual on top of Helms Cathedral in order to cure Karis by absorbing the storm into her. He was defeated by the adventurers however.
Elden had a natural charm and a ruthless business acumen.
