'''Oskar Fevras''' was a renowned painter that hailed from [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|There is nothing so depressing as learning one's true value.}}

==Personality==
He was a thoughtful and contemplative man that still somehow managed to get himself into precarious situations despite not acting rashly.

==Abilities==
While he was born a commoner, Oskar's artistic talent attracted the attention of the [[Nobility of Baldur's Gate|Baldurian nobility]].

==Relationships==
Oskar fell for a woman that he believed to be the love of his life. All seemed well together until he was courted by [[Lady Jannath]] of the [[Jannath]] patriar family. Both of Oskar's love interests also acted as patrons of his artistic works. Oskar was known to the business with a powerful [[mummy lord]] of the Lower City â€“ [[Mystic Carrion]], who procured a ''[[torch of revocation]]'' for the painter in [[1492 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Oskar became torn when he had to choose between the two women in his life, the noblewoman Lady Jannath or the woman that truly held his heart. To clear his mind and think things over, Oskar left the city for the open air of the countryside and began painting. Scandal broke out in the city and news of Oskar's affair with Lady Jannath spread.

Unfortunately, with news of Oskar's exploits out he made a ripe target for blackmailers and other criminals. He was abducted by a [[Zhentarim]] slaver named [[Brem]] and taken to the [[Zhentarim hideout (Risen Road)|Zhentarim hideout]] underneath the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn.
