Chou Yueng was the garrison commander at the fort of Yanajalan in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra in the midâ€“14 century DR.
His father hailed from Tu Lung, making Yueng a "half-foreign barbarian" in Kuong eyes. He married a member of an aristocratic house, but others believed this was the only way he achieved his post.
Yueng was considered overzealous in his duties, even extorting "road fees" from travelers to guarantee their safe passage. Those from outside the kingdom who refused to pay risked being imprisoned for up to ten days and their property being confiscated.
