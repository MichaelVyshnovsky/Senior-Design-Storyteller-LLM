        "mainbody": "'''Juetta Baelcrest''' was a brewmistress and the proprietor of the [[Old Dirty Dwarf]] inn and tavern in the city of [[Helm's Hold]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Juetta directed the Old Dirty Dwarf to cater to newcomers to Helm's Hold. While she welcomed [[spellscarred]] individuals into her establishment, some of her staff went against her wishes and discouraged their patronage.\n\nIn addition to running the inn and tavern, Juetta regularly tended the taproom bar herself.",
        "History": "Ever the intrepid entrepreneur, Juetta managed to keep the inn open and running during the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}.\n\nShe stepped down as innkeeper  of the Old Dirty Dwarf some time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, when it was taken over by [[Kharissa Anuvien]] and renamed the Venturer's Rest."
