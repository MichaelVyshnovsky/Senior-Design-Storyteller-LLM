AlAif was a warrior Mtair Dhafir tribe during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He was considered to be the most fearsome Mtairi warrior during his time. His face bore a scar brought on by the slash of a dagger as well as four claw marks that were left by a lion.
AlAif was a man of honor that believe that people should honor the traditional ways of the Bedine. He was particularly distrustful of all forms of magic.
AlAif garnered great trust and respect from Sheikh Sabkhat, leader of the Mtairi people.
The stalwart warrior was distrusting of the Zhent warrior Zarud, when he appealed to Sheikh Sabkhat for an alliance in the . When it was revealed that Zarud and his assistant had used magic in their talks, AlAif broke the tradition of hospitality and took his jambiya to Zaruds throat. AlAif and the sheikhs daughter Ruha managed to talk some sense into Sabkhat, and the agreement was not formalized nor anyone physically harmed. AlAif disagreed with the sheikhs decision not to strike back against the invaders.
That night Zarud was killed by the Harper agent Lander, his throat slit in the same manner that AlAif previously threatened. All signs of the Zhents death pointed to Ruha and her brother-in-law Kadumi of the Qahtani. Sheikh Sabkhat arranged for both of them along with Lander to be bound and confined to a single tent until they were to be given over to the Zhentarim as compensation. AlAif freed the pair, took the blame for Zaruds death, and gave them supplies to make their escape from the Mtairi camp.
