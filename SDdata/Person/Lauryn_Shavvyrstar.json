        "mainbody": "Lauryn Shavvyrstar was a woman of the hamlet of Sevenecho in the Vast. \nShe worked as a chambermaid at the The Worried Wyvern inn circa 1370 DR. She was also in a romantic relationship with proprietor and innkeeper Beliost Sevenechoâ€”as were three fellow chambermaids, Mreeiel Klintar, Chyndrie Stormwind, Noelin Tlestlin. However, the four women got along well with one another, and commonly named Beliot as \"the chief adventurer in our band\". They even referred to him as \"Chief Adventurer\" when speaking to patrons of the inn, instead of more proper terms like \"innkeeper\", \"master of the house\", or \"hostler\", which led to some confusion."
