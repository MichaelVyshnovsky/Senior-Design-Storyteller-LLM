        "mainbody": "'''Rangrim''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Ilmater]] and a member of the [[Lords of Imphras II]] of [[Impiltur]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the [[1373 DR|Year of the Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], while [[Rage of Dragons|dragons flew rampant]] across [[Faer√ªn]], [[Sambryl|Queen Sambryl]] agreed to send a small contingent to the [[Gray Forest]] to destroy a [[Cult of the Dragon]] hideout at the suggestion of the [[avariel]] [[Taegan Nightwind]]. Rangrim volunteered to guide the expeditionary force, which included six [[bronze dragon]]s.\n\nHowever the expedition was ambushed by cult forces. During the assault, the dragon [[Quelsandas]] revealed himself as a spy of [[Sammaster]] and caught the Impilturan soldiers by surprise. Rangrim and Taegan managed to kill the traitorous bronze, but the paladin died in the process."
