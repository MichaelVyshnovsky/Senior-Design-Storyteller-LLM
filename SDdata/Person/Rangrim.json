        "mainbody": "Rangrim was a paladin of Ilmater and a member of the Lords of Imphras II of Impiltur during the 14 century DR.\nIn the Year of the Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, while dragons flew rampant across Faer√ªn, Queen Sambryl agreed to send a small contingent to the Gray Forest to destroy a Cult of the Dragon hideout at the suggestion of the avariel Taegan Nightwind. Rangrim volunteered to guide the expeditionary force, which included six bronze dragons.\nHowever the expedition was ambushed by cult forces. During the assault, the dragon Quelsandas revealed himself as a spy of Sammaster and caught the Impilturan soldiers by surprise. Rangrim and Taegan managed to kill the traitorous bronze, but the paladin died in the process."
