'''Blackwood''' was a [[human]] officer of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}
{{quote|You're about to lose your head, and ''this'' is what you're concerned with?|Blackwood to Holga }}

==Description==
He had long hair and a beard.

==Possessions==
Blackwood owned a ''[[darksteel greataxe]]'' with a telescoping haft that was forged by [[Ghelryn Foehammer]] of [[Triboar]]. He cleaned it with boiled [[linseed oil]] once a month, but Holga thought this should be once every seven days or so to as it was displaying rusting. 

==History==
[[File:Honor Among Thieves - Blackwood, Holga, and Edgin.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''Blackwood shows Holga and Edgin around the city of Neverwinter to one of its quaint little back-alley on-the-spot executions.'']]
Blackwood became a loyal henchman of Lord [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] and his [[wizard]] advisor [[Sofina]] when they took power in Neverwinter in the late 1490s DR.{{HAT-time}} After Sofina captured [[Edgin Darvis]] and [[Holga Kilgore]] in [[Castle Never]], Forge ordered Blackwood to take them back to the [[Revel's End]] prison and collect the bounty on them. But Sofina whispered in Blackwood's ear that he should discreetly kill them instead. He and his soldiers led the pair into a shadowy back alley to execute them. But Holga recognized Blackwood's axe and keenly asked about its make, use, and maintenance, even criticized his laxness. All this bought time for Holga to pry loose a paving stone and use it as a weapon as she escaped and defeated the guards. Blackwood recovered and tried to get Holga from behind, but was clobbered by Edgin's reinforced [[lute]]. Holga caught and kept the axe.

Later, Sofina sent for [[Dralas]] and his band of six fellow [[Thayan]] assassins. Arriving by boat on the [[Neverwinter River]], Dralas met Sofina, Blackwood, and some of his soldiers at the docks. Sofina ordered Dralas to dispatch Blackwood and his soldiers because they had failed to stop Edgin and Holga's escape. Dralas slew them all single-handedly.
