'''Rory "Reacher" Starkbuckle''' was a [[human]] hostler at the [[Yawning Portal]] inn in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

''Circa'' [[1375 DR]], the lad worked for the stablemaster [[Tarlgarth Vathar]] alongside [[Burgaun Malsim]]. They sought his respect above all. If trouble broke out at the inn and Durnan was unavailable or incapacitated, he would get Durnan's horn and blow it to summon the [[Red Sashes]].
