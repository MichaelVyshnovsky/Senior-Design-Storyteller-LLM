'''Sergor''' was a warrior of [[Damara]].

==History==
Sergor was a sergeant in Damara's army, stationed at a small garrison in the [[Tomrav]]
village, near the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]]. In [[1491 DR]], despite an alliance with a local [[goblin]] tribe, a large group of [[bugbear]]s, led by [[Hrar]], attacked the village and captured many hostages, seizing control of the village and the road to the monastery. Eventually, an adventuring party hired for a mission at the monastery defeated a bugbear patrol, and Sergor then asked their help to free the hostages, including his family, and to defeat the bugbears.
