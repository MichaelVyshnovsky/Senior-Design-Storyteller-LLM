        "History": "Just after the start of the [[War of the Silver Marches]], Axelcrantz sensed a menace caused by a [[drow]] [[artifact]] in the [[Underdark]] near the city. He sensed that to recover this object he needed a particular adventuring party that would arrive in [[Mithral Hall]] in some time.\n\nHowever, followed by two [[drow]], Axelcrantz abandoned Mithril Hall. He left a letter and orders that it be delivered to the adventurers when they arrived. In the letter, he predicted that they would meet in [[Citadel Adbar]]. All went as he had foreseen and Axelcrantz met the adventurers in Citadel Adbar, explaining about the artifact they needed to destroy.\n\nStudying the recovered [[Wand of Tir'Lien]] and thanks to visions sent by [[Moradin]], Axelcrantz discovered the [[drow]] wanted to use the [[Fell Fortress]], at the border of the [[Shadowfell]], to summon an [[undead]] army. He hired the adventuring party to stop this evil plan. Thanks to the Wand, the Fell Fortress was sealed.\n\nLater, Axelcrantz went to [[Blingdenstone]] and called the adventurers, asking them to investigate problems in the trade between the [[deep gnome]] city and [[Gracklstugh]].",
