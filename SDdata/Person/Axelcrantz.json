        "mainbody": "Axelcrantz was a dwarf mystic in 1484 DR.\nJust after the start of the War of the Silver Marches, Axelcrantz sensed a menace caused by a drow artifact in the Underdark near the city. He sensed that to recover this object he needed a particular adventuring party that would arrive in Mithral Hall in some time.\nHowever, followed by two drow, Axelcrantz abandoned Mithril Hall. He left a letter and orders that it be delivered to the adventurers when they arrived. In the letter, he predicted that they would meet in Citadel Adbar. All went as he had foreseen and Axelcrantz met the adventurers in Citadel Adbar, explaining about the artifact they needed to destroy.\nStudying the recovered Wand of TirLien and thanks to visions sent by Moradin, Axelcrantz discovered the drow wanted to use the Fell Fortress, at the border of the Shadowfell, to summon an undead army. He hired the adventuring party to stop this evil plan. Thanks to the Wand, the Fell Fortress was sealed.\nLater, Axelcrantz went to Blingdenstone and called the adventurers, asking them to investigate problems in the trade between the deep gnome city and Gracklstugh.\nCategoryDwarves\nCategoryMystics\nCategoryWorshipers of Moradin\nCategoryInhabitants of Citadel Adbar\nCategoryInhabitants of Luruar\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nqyd9tw0crbwuk0iyfkj9cwr7ka46p1z"
