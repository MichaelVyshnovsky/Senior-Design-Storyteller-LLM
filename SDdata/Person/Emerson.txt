'''Emerson''' was the foreman of the [[Nashkel mines]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|There be problems in the lower level, where we lost some workers. The men talk of things a-movin below, but who's to say. The earth, she hides many things from sight.}}

==Possessions==
He was armed with a simple [[club]].

==History==
Emerson was in charge of the mines in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, when the [[iron ore]] within was tainted and entirely unusable. Unbeknownst to him they were plagued with [[kobold]] minions under the direction of [[Mulahey]], a devotee of [[Cyric]] and a pawn of the [[Iron Throne]].
