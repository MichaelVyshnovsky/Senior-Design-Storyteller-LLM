        "mainbody": "'''Ilmus Gallaway''' was a merchant living in [[Caer-Dineval]] during the 11th century [[DR]].",
        "History": "During [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Ilmus Gallaway sent a shipment of supplies to aid [[Easthaven]] in the coming winter for [[Gaspar]], but the caravan was ambushed by an [[ogre]] raider and his [[orc]] henchmen.\n\nIn the years that followed, Ilmus' business grew and the caravan routes expanded past Easthaven and [[Lonelywood]]. By the time the [[Gallaway Trading Coaster]] was established, it had trading depot across the [[Ten-Town]]s and traded with farther settlements such as [[Luskan]] and [[Shaengarne Ford]]. Subsequently, age and love for [[Cormyrian brandy]] caught up with Ilmus Gallaway and his family had to take over the business's daily activities and travel. [[Rawleigh Gallaway]], Ilmus's son, guided the coaster to prosperity. In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Ilmus's granddaughter who inherited his fiery personality and short temper, [[Deirdre Gallaway]], was put in charge of the [[Gallaway Trade Depot]] in [[Targos]]."
