'''Din Caldwell''' was a member of the [[Caldwell]] [[patriar]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}

==Description==
He was a short and balding man with a dark fringe of hair a mustache. He wore turquoise [[robe]]s with a golden [[sash]]. He walked with the aid of a cane.

==History==
In the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Lord [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] of [[Neverwinter]] revived the [[High Sun Games]], a blood-sport in which [[adventurer]]s would battle monsters in a maze in the newly built [[Neverwinter arena]]. Din Caldwell was one of a number of rich, powerful, and unscrupulous people who came to bet big on the Games and brought their riches with them. However, they needed a secure place to store their riches. To this end, Forge offered the use of [[Castle Never]]'s treasure vault, but Din and the others wished to see its security for themselves. Thus, Forge his advisor [[Sofina]] showed Din Caldwell and [[Porb Piiradost]] around the castle, boasting of its upgraded security and suitability for storing their wealth in its vault, which was protected with a powerful ''[[Mordenkainen's arcane seal]]''. Din laughed when Forge joked about the former lord who'd banned the Games, [[Dagult Neverember]], being in a vegetative state. However, they were interrupted when Sofina sensed the presence of a [[wild shape]]d [[druid]]—[[Doric]]—spying on them, but she escaped Sofina and the castle guards.

Nevertheless, Din and the others trusted their wealth to Forge Fitzwilliam. This would prove to be unwise as Forge stole it all and, during the High Sun Games, tried to abscond the city with it. Meanwhile, Din and the others bet on the contestants and the monsters; Din idly asked Porb if he'd ever eaten [[displacer beast]] flesh, but Porb declared it too gamey for his liking. Din later bet '20,000' on the [[Gray Hands]]. Both their fortunes were later lost, scattered over the streets of Neverwinter for the common people to collect. But Din was not to know because, while he was watching and betting on the Games, Sofina revealed herself as a [[Red Wizard of Thay]]{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Legendary Magic Items}}
