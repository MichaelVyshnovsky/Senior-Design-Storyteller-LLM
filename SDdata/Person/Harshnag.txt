'''Harshnag the Grim'''<ref group="note">''[[City of Splendors: Waterdeep]]'', as well as ''[[Storm King's Thunder]]'' lists this character as being named ''Harshnag'', while the ''[[Heroes' Lorebook]]'' calls him ''Harshnagg''. 

==Description==
Harshnag was particularly burly-looking, even for a frost giant. He had skin as white as snow, light blue eyes and pale blue hair which he often kept tied back in a braid.

==Possessions==
Harshnag was known for wearing the skull of a [[white dragon]] as a [[helmet]]. His main weapon was the legendary ''[[Gurt's greataxe]]''. He was once also known to wear a suit of enchanted [[plate mail]].<ref>{{cite book/City System|5}}

==History==
Harshnag was exiled from his tribe of frost giants, who lived in the [[Spine of the World]] mountains, for his rather genteel demeanor. He wandered south to explore the Realms beyond his home and eventually made his way down to [[Waterdeep]]. 

Taken back by the presence of a frost giant near the city, the Gray Hands moved to intercept the giant interloper. Their leader, a [[ranger]] by the name of [[Jardwim]], was so impressed by the giant's polite response, invited Harshnag to join their ranks. He made his home in a cave in [[Mount Sar]], and was summoned by means of a ''[[sending]]'' spell by his fellow [[Gray Hand enforcer]], a [[wizard]] named [[Maliantor]].

At some point during the 14{{th}} century, Harshnag was gifted the ''[[Gurt's greataxe|legendary greataxe]]'' of [[Gurt]], the ''Lord of the Pale Giants'', by [[Open Lord]] [[Piergeiron the Paladinson|Piergeiron]], in recognition for his service to the city of Waterdeep.

Following the shattering of the ordning in the late 1480s DR, Harshnag took it upon himself to slay evil giants who were terrorizing the people of the North. He was a key player in the conflict between the [[storm giant]] [[Hekaton]] and the [[blue dragon]] [[Iymrith]], leading a party of adventurers to a temple of [[Annam All-Father|Annam]] known as the [[Eye of the All-Father]], where they were able to consult an oracle to divine a solution to the ordning's collapse.
