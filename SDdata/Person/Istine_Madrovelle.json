Marvels and perils beyond imagining await those who travel beyond this realm.<br/>Why, I have heard that in the [[Demonweb]], a rift to an [[Eberron|entire other world]] has been made.\n|Istine\n}}\nDuring the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] and the extended [[Lolth]]-related situation with [[Eberron]], Istine stayed in [[Eveningstar]] to monitor and coordinate efforts against the Spider Queen, including sending teams into Lolth's own domain and striking at her there. She was unusually well-informed about the world of [[Eberron]] during these operations."
