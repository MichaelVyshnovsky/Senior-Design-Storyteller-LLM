        "History": "Sindar the Warrior died centuries before his final resting place in the [[Elven Catacombs]]' First Cellar was disturbed by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and their grave-robbing [[drow]] allies in [[1369 DR]]. His body was laid to rest within one of the decorated crypts of elven heroes of the City of Song, alongside [[Arianna]] the Archer, [[Erik Sliphand]], Magister [[Luther]], [[Bannoc]], and [[Shyla]]. Their sarcophagi were corrupted by the wild magics unleashed during the Weeping War, cursing the fallen heroes with the [[undead]] existence as [[wraith]]s, forever guarding the artifacts they were interred with."
