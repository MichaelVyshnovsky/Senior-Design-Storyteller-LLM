        "mainbody": "Sindar the Warrior was a venerated hero of Myth Drannor who perished before the citys fall in the Weeping War in 714 DR.\nSindars most prized possession was his scimitar of slaying, the blade that served him in life and stayed by his side in death.\nSindar the Warrior died centuries before his final resting place in the Elven Catacombs First Cellar was disturbed by the Cult of the Dragon and their grave-robbing drow allies in 1369 DR. His body was laid to rest within one of the decorated crypts of elven heroes of the City of Song, alongside Arianna the Archer, Erik Sliphand, Magister Luther, Bannoc, and Shyla. Their sarcophagi were corrupted by the wild magics unleashed during the Weeping War, cursing the fallen heroes with the undead existence as wraiths, forever guarding the artifacts they were interred with."
