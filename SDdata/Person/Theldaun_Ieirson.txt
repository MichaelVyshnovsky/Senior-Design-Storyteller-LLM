'''Theldaun "Firehurler" Ieirson''' was an aging [[wizard]], active in the early-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Theldaun was an old man and experienced wizard. He harbored opinions that adventuring life was not a fun and exciting vocation. Instead, it was filled with danger, especially for wizards whose life could be ended with another mage's stray spell. Firehurler put his musings into a [[book]] – ''[[Teachings of an Angry Old Mage]]''.{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}
