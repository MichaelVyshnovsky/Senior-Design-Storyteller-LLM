'''Glouroth''' was a [[dragon aging|mature adult]] [[Shadow dragon]] that resided in the [[Deep Wastes]] between the [[Lake of Shadows]] and [[Maerimydra]]. He made his lair in the [[Wailing Cliff]], an odd place where the [[Plane of Shadow]] bled into the [[Material Plane]].  

==Description==
Ever slinking in the darkness of his lair, Glouroth generally cloaks himself in shadows to mask his appearance.

==Personality==
Beneath a veneer of charm and serenity Glouroth is a being of roiling hatred and rage. When conversing with others the [[shadow dragon]] murmurs soothing platitudes in a hissing whisper, all the while consumed with thoughts of gore and death.

==History==
In his younger years Glouroth dallied with a group of [[Kir-lanan]]s, even managing to father a daughter from them in the form of the [[Half-dragon]], [[Phaikkul]].

In [[1372 DR]], [[drow]] refugees from the beseiged city of [[Maerimydra]] called upon an ancient pact they had with the [[dragon]] to grant them safe passage past the [[Wailing Cliff]].

==Relationships==
===Kir-lanan===
Although Glouroth lived with two groups of Kir-lanan, who both payed homage to him in certain ways, he took little notice of them beyond the offerings the occasionaly brought him.

===Drow===
As the lair of Glouroth resided upon the main route between the city of Maerimydra and the [[drow]] outpost of [[Szith Morcane]], this meant that they had to come to a certain number of arrangements concerning their realtionship. This took the form of a pact which meant the drow could garner free passage from both the kir-lanans and Glouroth through the Wailing Cliff. In addition, [[priestess]]es of [[Lolth]] knew a further stipulation of the pact that meant they could speak a code word to the shadow dragon telling him "I am a captive, please destroy my captors".
