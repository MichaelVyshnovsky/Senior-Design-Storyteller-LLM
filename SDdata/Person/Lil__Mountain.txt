'''Lil' Mountain''', was a [[familiar]] who served [[Kursh Do Ran]], a [[dwarf|dwarvish]] [[sha'ir]] planeswalker from [[Zakhara]] and a member of a trans-dimensional organization called the [[Order of the Eternals]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Lil' Mountain was a [[daolani]] with a [[mahogany]]-colored skin and the hair the color of [[coal]]. He was a taller specimen, standing at {{SI|1.25|ft|long=yes}} and weighting almost {{SI|80|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Personality==
Like his master, Lil' Mountain was a boisterous and spirited creature. He spoke his mind and had no reason to be polite or show respect to anyone but more powerful [[genie]]s, and even when dealing with the geniekind, Lil' Mountain was lippy. He was often in a gloomy mood.

==Abilities==
Like others of his kind, the daolani posesed a powerful [[infravision]] with an impressive distance of {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}}. As a familiar, he could detect danger aimed at Lil' Mountain and would travel the planes on command to fetch [[spell]]s for the Dwarven Mage, of virtually any rarity, both [[arcane]] and [[divine]].

==History==
When the Order of the Eternals elected to hold its 1,238{{th}} annual [[Symposium]] in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], in order to secretly investigate its unusually high levels of magical energies and planar incursions, Kursh Do Ran was among the guests and members who stayed at [[Glittering Star Inn]] for the multi-day event, accompanied by his loyal familiar, Lil' Mountain.
