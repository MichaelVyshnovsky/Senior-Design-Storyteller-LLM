Velomar Dauntcastle was the Magister from  to .
Velomar Dauntcastle had a fat, bearded figure.
He was boisterous, bold, gregarious, and loud. He was infamous for his loud singing, his loud voice, his loud fistfights, and his mockery of the speech and mannerisms of ladies of station, whose dresses he was not averse to donning while decrying their hypocrisy.
Velomar had developed variant monster summoning spells that fetched swarms of stirges, giant wasps, and other flying creatures. He also had developed a curse that soaked someones head with a tipple of whatever drink he was drinking at the moment. At least one of his spells could broadcast the sayings of those he magically eavesdropped on.
Before becoming the Magister, Velomar Dauntcastle was once poisoned by a tavernmaster who hated sorcery. He had become feared by the pompous and the high, and become a folk hero to others, through his magical eavesdroppings, his exposing of the dishonest, and his general mislike of hypocrisy.
He was offered the office of the Magister by Azuth this was referred to as "one of the High Ones impish moments" by Mystra. His tenure as magister did little to change his habits he simply memorized more spells for battle. He also developed a spell that, as revenge on the tavernmaster who poisoned him, caused a tipple of every drink he had to wash over his head.
His tenure as the Magister ended when he was attacked by a dozen swordsmen, hired by a jealous husband whose wife he had seduced. He kept casting spells to protect her, and managed to slay both the husband and six of the swordsmen by collapsing the balcony on which the first one stood on top of the latter however, the remaining six swordsmen managed to finally run him through. He had over sixty sword-thrusts in him before his death.
After his death, Velomar Dauntcastle became a shadowstaff, who sometimes took flesh to rescue young mages and inspire them. He was said to be entertaining to Mystra and bards both as a shadowstaff, due to his still boisterous habits.
