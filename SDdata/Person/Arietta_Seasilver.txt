'''Arietta Elbetrina Ifig Seasilver''' was a [[Cormyr]]ean noblewoman of [[Seasilver|House Seasilver]] in [[Marsember]], and the [[chosen]] of [[Siamorphe]].{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|23}}{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|108}} She took a role in some critical events in [[Faer√ªn]] during the [[Second Sundering]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|284}}

==Personality==
True to the teachings of Siamorphe, Arietta believed that the nobility of the Realms had a duty to serve their land and its people above their own interests.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|25}}

==Activities==
In order to get away from the life of a young noblewoman, Arietta would masquerade as a [[bard]] named '''Elbertina''' and perform at [[The Old Oak]] tavern.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|48}}

==Possessions==
Among Arietta's most prized possessions were her [[yew]] [[bow|hunting bow]] and her [[lyre]].{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|30}} She even had a quiver of [[magic]]al [[arrow]]s that were personally made by the great [[War Wizard]] [[Glathra Barcantle]].{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|34}}

==Relationships==
Arietta  was the daughter of Grand Duke [[Farnig Seasilver|Farnig]] and Grand Duchess [[Elira Seasilver]]. She had a contentious relationship with her mother, and believed her father was not dutiful to his subjects.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|24}}

She was well-served by her lady-in-waiting [[Odelia]],{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|38}}

During her adventures Arietta grew close to two of her companion, the city guard [[Kleef Kenric]],{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|164}} and the [[heartwarder]] [[Joelle Emmeline]], the latter with whom she became a lover.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|232}} With Joelle's love and Kleef's trust and devotion, she overcame a crisis of identity and uncovered her powers as Siamorphe's chosen.

==History==
Arietta grew up as a bright and dutiful young woman, wholly devoted to the teachings of Siamorphe. While she had never received any sort of divine vision or mandate, she had periodic dreams that featured the Divine Right. Afterwards, the priests and priestesses at the temple began to lavish praise and favor upon Arietta, to the point where she believed herself to be Siamorhpe's chosen.

When the [[shadovar]] armies assaulted Marsember, on [[Uktar 2]] of the {{YearlinkName|1486}},{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|3}} Arietta was placed under strict protection in her family's estate by orders of her father. She was to be kept safe until the family could sail to [[Elversult]] aboard their ship, the ''[[Wave Wyvern]]''.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|25}}

Arietta escaped Marsember with Kleef Kenric, [[paladin]] follower of the dead god [[Helm]], and two Chosen, [[Malik el Sami]], follower of [[Cyric]], and Joelle Emmeline, follower of [[Sune]]. Malik and Jeolle had a mission from their gods to take the ''[[Eye of Gruumsh (relic)|Eye of Gruumsh]]'' to the earth [[primordial]] [[Grumbar]]'s temple in the [[Underchasm]]. Arietta decided to help them, for a time under the guise of Elbertina.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|75}}

The group traveled with the ''Eye'' across the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to the lands of the [[Vilhon Reach]], and all the way through the [[Chondalwood]] forest. As the group was rafting down the a rover to the [[Underchasm]] Arietta was confronted with a hurtful "truth" posed by Malik: that she was not Siamorphe's actual chosen, and her "powers" had merely been an after effect of Kleef's leadership as a follower of Helm. Arietta fell for Malik's hurtful words, and doubted her abilities and importance for much of their journey.

Eventually, the party reached the Underchasm and [[Sadrach's Spire]]. When the group was confronted with the great rage of the [[plaguechanged]] [[Sadrach]] himself, Arietta proved she was indeed Siamorphe's chosen. With the support of her lover Joelle, and the confidence of Kleef,{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|283}} Arietta commanded the noble presence necessary to step past the Sadrach and his magic, allowing the group to deliver the ''Eye'' to the temple of Grumbar.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|284}}

A short time later, Malik betrayed his companions in a final desperate attack to slay Arietta in the name of [[Cyric]]. Joelle tackled the traitorous man to save her lover, sacrificing her own life in the process.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|288}} While she suffered great loss, Arietta and Kleef managed to escape Sadrach's Spire, setting free the people that were trapped within. They began their journey back to their home in Cormyr, as noblewoman and devoted knight.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|295}}
