He was the fourth member of his lineage to hold this position. Rimaq dreamed that [[Zakharan pantheon|Pantheist Enlightenment]] would prevail through the entire Land of Fate. He corresponded regularly with [[Alyana al-Azzazi]], the Grand Caliph's trusted vizier, knowing that influencing her was the best way to further his goal.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Rimaq was rumored to be the cause of many troubles and disasters striking the [[Pearl Cities]] region found on the opposite side of the [[Golden Gulf]]. Though troubles in the Pearl Cities certainly benefited Rimaq, he was not a malevolent person who would willingly cause such misfortune."
