        "mainbody": "Rimaq al-Nimar, also called the Most Reverend Father or Most Humble Servant of the Enlightened Gods, was a moralist and emir of Itiraf in the Cities of the Pantheon region of Zakhara.\nAround 1367 DR, Rimaq al-Nimar was the emir of Itiraf and the most influential leader in the League of the Pantheon.\nIn addition to being the emir of Itiraf, Rimaq was also the head of the League Conclaveâ€”the governing body for the Pantheist League. He was the fourth member of his lineage to hold this position. Rimaq dreamed that Pantheist Enlightenment would prevail through the entire Land of Fate. He corresponded regularly with Alyana al-Azzazi, the Grand Caliphs trusted vizier, knowing that influencing her was the best way to further his goal.\nRimaq was rumored to be the cause of many troubles and disasters striking the Pearl Cities region found on the opposite side of the Golden Gulf. Though troubles in the Pearl Cities certainly benefited Rimaq, he was not a malevolent person who would willingly cause such misfortune."
