        "mainbody": "Esarhaddon was the youngest of the leaders of the Enclave in Unther in 1357 DR.\nEsarhaddon planned to transform the Enclave into a political entity and attempt the conquest of the land. He had made contacts with the bandit leader Furifax in order to spare the Enclave from the rebellion.  \nEsarhaddon was young and impulsive, brilliant but impatient. He wanted Unther to become a magocracy and hated Gilgeam. He was so impatient that he might decide to support Furifaxs plans. Esarhaddon was more interested in politics than magical research.  \nEsarhaddon was the apprentice of Isimud. He had a great following among the young apprentices but none of the masters supported his magocracy idea."
