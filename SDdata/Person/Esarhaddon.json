        "mainbody": "'''Esarhaddon''' was the youngest of the leaders of [[the Enclave]] in [[Unther]] in [[1357 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Esarhaddon planned to transform the Enclave into a political entity and attempt the conquest of the land. He had made contacts with the bandit leader [[Furifax]] in order to spare the Enclave from the rebellion.",
        "Personality": "Esarhaddon was young and impulsive, brilliant but impatient. He wanted Unther to become a magocracy and hated [[Gilgeam]]. He was so impatient that he might decide to support Furifax's plans. Esarhaddon was more interested in politics than magical research.",
        "Relationship": "Esarhaddon was the apprentice of [[Isimud]]. He had a great following among the young apprentices but none of the masters supported his magocracy idea."
