'''Elgun''' was a citizen of [[Port Llast]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Elgun went in search of tree spirits, [[dryads]], to see what he could do about them. On his way, though, he saw the village of [[Ember]] destroyed. Elgun came back home, but began telling stories of how he defeated Ember's attackers.

The [[Kalach-Cha]] could have gathered information about Ember and confronted Elgun with the knowledge. Elgun would hesitate, but if undeniable proof was given, Elgun would explain the real story of what had happened.
