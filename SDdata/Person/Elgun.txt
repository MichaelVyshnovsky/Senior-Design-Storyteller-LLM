Elgun was a citizen of Port Llast on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR.
Elgun went in search of tree spirits, dryads, to see what he could do about them. On his way, though, he saw the village of Ember destroyed. Elgun came back home, but began telling stories of how he defeated Embers attackers.
The Kalach-Cha could have gathered information about Ember and confronted Elgun with the knowledge. Elgun would hesitate, but if undeniable proof was given, Elgun would explain the real story of what had happened.
