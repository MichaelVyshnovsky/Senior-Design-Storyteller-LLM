==Relationships==
Y'zleth had a companion snake named [[Ssura]]. The two were both devotees of the god [[Merrshaulk]] and remained connected to his later of the Shrine of Fangs.

==History==
After a troublesome [[geonid]] stole the idol of Merrshaulk from the Shrine of Fangs, T'zleth and Ssura compelled passersby to have it retrieved. They offered some of the accumulated knowledge in exchange for its safe return.
