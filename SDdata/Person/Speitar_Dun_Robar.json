I'll remember your death fondly.\n|Speitar\n}}\nDuring the Darkening, Speitar served [[Vicala Szind]] as an officer when their forces struck the outlying farmsteads around [[Eveningstar]] while other drow attacked the village proper. Their surprise attack captured the [[Midler farmhouse]] and the entire [[Midler]] family, who were held hostage in their own home and interrogated by Vicala for information about the Thread of the Weave. Speitar handled the lesser drow while they waited, who were dissatisfied with the lack of combat and treasure to be found, but he and his forces were overcome by a group of [[adventurer]]s sent to rescue the family."
