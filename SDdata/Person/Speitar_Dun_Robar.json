        "mainbody": "peitar DunRobar was a skilled drow Blademaster of House DunRobar that fought in the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar and the hunt for the Thread of the Weave during the Darkening in the 1480s DR.\nSpeitar wore his hair in a mohawk.\nSpeitar had a grandiose self-perception, considering himself an unsurpassed fighter.\nDuring the Darkening, Speitar served Vicala Szind as an officer when their forces struck the outlying farmsteads around Eveningstar while other drow attacked the village proper. Their surprise attack captured the Midler farmhouse and the entire Midler family, who were held hostage in their own home and interrogated by Vicala for information about the Thread of the Weave. Speitar handled the lesser drow while they waited, who were dissatisfied with the lack of combat and treasure to be found, but he and his forces were overcome by a group of adventurers sent to rescue the family."
