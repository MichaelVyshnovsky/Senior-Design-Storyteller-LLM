Holvan was a warrior in service to the Cult of the Dragon in the mid-14 century DR.
Holvan was unhappy with the task of capturing Shandril Shessair, and feared for what may happen to them.
Holvan and Brasker were sent to the caravan led by Orthil Voldovan from Scornubel to Waterdeep in late , which the spellfire wielder Shandril Shessair had boarded. They were ordered to capture her, though neither liked their chances of success. During one of the ambushes the caravan faced, they accidentally blabbed about their allegiance within earshot of Shandril, who was hiding inside a wagon.
Brasker and Holvan slew Praulgar, revealing him as a Zhentarim, in an attempt to ingratiate themselves with Shandril. However, when they introduced themselves by name, Shandril had already overheard them to be Cult members, and launched spellfire at their eyes, blinding them Narm finished them off with a knife.
Their allegiance was known to the Zhentarim scriers Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle, and to the Red Wizards in the service of Hulrivior.
