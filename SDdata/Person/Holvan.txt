'''Holvan''' was a warrior in service to the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Holvan was unhappy with the task of capturing [[Shandril Shessair]], and feared for what may happen to them.

==History==
Holvan and [[Brasker]] were sent to the caravan led by [[Orthil Voldovan]] from [[Scornubel]] to [[Waterdeep]] in late {{yearlink|1357}}, which the [[spellfire]] wielder Shandril Shessair had boarded. They were ordered to capture her, though neither liked their chances of success. During one of the ambushes the caravan faced, they accidentally blabbed about their allegiance within earshot of Shandril, who was hiding inside a wagon.

Brasker and Holvan slew [[Praulgar]], revealing him as a Zhentarim, in an attempt to ingratiate themselves with Shandril. However, when they introduced themselves by name, Shandril had already overheard them to be Cult members, and launched spellfire at their eyes, blinding them; Narm finished them off with a knife.

==Rumors & Legends==
Their allegiance was known to the [[Zhentarim]] scriers [[Hlael Toraunt]] and [[Korthauvar Hammantle]],{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|272|16}} and to the [[Red Wizard]]s in the service of [[Hulrivior]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|309|18}}
