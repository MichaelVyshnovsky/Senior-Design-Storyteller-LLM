        "Relationships": "She was well-served by two apprentices, the sisters [[Penny]] and [[Piniwin]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Hazel and her apprentices were sent to the [[Blacklake District]] to study the sludge that had become so prevalent in and around the [[Blacklake]], as it had developed strange and worrying properties. She maintained a small, mobile laboratory and campsite defended by members of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] against sludge-covered [[zombie]]s and members of the [[Nashers]] and [[Dead Rats]]. Due to the risk, she hired an adventurer to collect samples of certain kinds of sludge or in certain locations. At one point her research was disrupted when [[Nashers]] stole her supplies, thinking they were [[potion]]s, and also needed these retrieved. Finally, she could test whether the sludge was animal, vegetable, mineral, or [[undead]], or if it was a hibernating [[black pudding]].\n\nWhatever it was, she got her answer when [[Therzt]], a self-proclaimed [[Chosen]] of [[Ghaunadaur]], summoned sludge-covered [[zombie]]s from out of Blacklake to attack the waterfront. Hazel led the defense while Piniwin and Penny sought aid from adventurers; aided by her [[alchemist's fire]], they defeated Therzt and the undead.\n\nAfterward, Hazel went to [[Ebon Downs]], where she paid adventurers to collect certain [[mushroom]]s and slivers of the [[Deathknell Shard]] crystal. It was safer there."
