        "mainbody": "Albryn Telnhand was a gnome leatherworker who lived in the Dock Ward of the city of Waterdeep in the 13 century DR.\nCirca 1226 DR, Albryn invented a factory machine known as the pressbow. Though some disputed this claim, saying that the machine had been around since much earlier and that Albryn had merely refined it. Whatever the truth, this device would go on to become the namesake for the alleyway that Albryns workshop stood alongside of &mdash Pressbow Lane."
