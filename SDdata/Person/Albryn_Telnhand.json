        "mainbody": "'''Albryn Telnhand''' was a [[gnome]] leatherworker who lived in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of the city of [[Waterdeep]] in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1226 DR]], Albryn invented a factory machine known as the [[pressbow]]. Though some disputed this claim, saying that the machine had been around since much earlier and that Albryn had merely refined it. Whatever the truth, this device would go on to become the namesake for the alleyway that Albryn's workshop stood alongside of &mdash; [[Pressbow Lane]]."
