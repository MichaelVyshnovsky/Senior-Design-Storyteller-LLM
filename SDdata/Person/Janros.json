        "mainbody": "Captain '''Janros''' was a [[wood elf]] officer in the [[Neverwinter Guard]] who served his [[Neverwinter|home city]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|Watch your back. The enemy is everywhere.|Captain Janros}}",
        "Relationships": "He worked with a number of skilled members of the Guard, including [[Creed (human)|Sergeant Creed]], [[Gaelen|Scout Gaelen]], and [[Quickfoot|Private Quickfoot]].",
        "History": "Janros was a veteran soldier.\n\nFollowing the [[Siege of Neverwinter]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Captain Janros was tasked with defending Neverwinter against the [[orc]]ish occupiers of the [[Many-Arrows]] kingdom under commander [[Vansi Bloodscar]]. He led the guardsmen in first containing the orcs and then reclaiming the [[Neverwinter/River District|River District]] from them.{{NWDistricts}} He had soldiers guard the gates and man the walls, and barricaded off parts of the ruined district so they could protect the other districts, but this left the Guard's numbers stretched thin. Thus, Janros regularly recruited [[adventurer]]s to target important orc leaders and disrupt their war effort.\n\nDuring that assignment, Sergeant Creed asked an adventurer to find lost dispatches from slain Neverwintan couriers and complete their delivery to Janros. From these, Janros managed to uncover the whereabouts of a holdout [[Nashers]] cell led by [[Karr Nevrim]], who colluded with the orcs. Hence, to prevent him undermining the city's security, Janros dispatched the adventurer to invade their sewer base and slay Karr.\n\nAfterward, Janros worked with the same adventurer to check the barricades and district walls to ensure the orcs were not breaking through, recover their stolen supply crates, and eliminate key warband leaders within the Many-Arrows hierarchy, such as their taskmasters and [[Kartok Paingiver]], who'd fortified the old [[Merchant Guild Hall]]. Meanwhile, he accepted the [[Proudfist]] clan's defection and had [[half-orc]] adventurers target [[spellscarred]] orcs.\n\nWith the Guard and the city secured and the orcs weakened, Janros was ready to strike back. He asked the adventurer to go behind orcish lines to meet Private Quickfoot and Scout Gaelen, who would give them more missions striking the orcs' core. Finally, a team of adventurers penetrated the [[Cloak Tower]], so they could defeat Vansi Bloodscar, and her lieutenants [[Makred|Makred the Foul]] and [[Throg|Throg the Ravenous]], finally ending the war."
