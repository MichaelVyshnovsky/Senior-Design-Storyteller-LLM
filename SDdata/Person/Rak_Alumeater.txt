'''Rak Alumeater''' was a [[gnome]] [[apothecary]] inhabiting [[Zhentil Keep]]'s [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Rak owned [[Rak's Apothecary]] on [[Zhent Avenue]]. He sold all kinds of [[potion]]s, medicines, and [[spell component]]s. He also sold poisons, but only after feeling out potential buyers first.

Though he was quite an accomplished [[alchemist]], Rak was nearly insane from the constant exposure to dangerous chemicals. His antics and experiments drove all of his neighbors away.
