Rak Alumeater was a gnome apothecary inhabiting Zhentil Keeps Foreign Quarter during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Rak owned Raks Apothecary on Zhent Avenue. He sold all kinds of potions, medicines, and spell components. He also sold poisons, but only after feeling out potential buyers first.
Though he was quite an accomplished alchemist, Rak was nearly insane from the constant exposure to dangerous chemicals. His antics and experiments drove all of his neighbors away.
