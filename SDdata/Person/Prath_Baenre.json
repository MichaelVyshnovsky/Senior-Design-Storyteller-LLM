        "mainbody": "Prath Baenre was a young drow wizard of House Baenre in Menzoberranzan.\nPrath was described as very stocky, with bulging biceps. Gromph Baenre believed that Melee-Magthere may have been more suited for him, given his martial demeanor.\nCirca the , Prath was in his first year of study at Sorcere. He was very loyal to Gromph Baenre, slicing his own pinky finger when a piece of flesh was needed for a spell during the Siege of Menzoberranzan.\nSoon afterwards, in order to allow him to infiltrate House Agrach Dyrr to destroy the phylactery of the Lichdrow Dyrr, Gromph disguised himself as Prath and disguised Prath as Gromph. Gromph chose Prath over Nauzhror Baenre in part because he was worried that Nauzhror would get delusions of grandeur.\nWhen Gromph disguised himself as Prath and entered Praths rooms, he noticed the use of a frivolous spell that said \"Welcome back Master Prath\" and also a series of scrolls containing progressively complicated transmutations. After seeing his room, Gromph decided that Prath had some unforeseen potential."
