        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], Musanna led a patrol of her fellows in order to rescue her prince, [[Ulatha Mesavir]], who had been kidnapped by the [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]]. Musanna and her fellows inspected the ruined [[Fort Dalton]], where they defeated some cultists and met an adventuring party hired to destroy a bandit group active near [[River Lis]]—in truth, the same cultists. Musanna likely joined the adventurers in their mission.{{Cite adventurers league/Dark Rites at Fort Dalton|11}}"
