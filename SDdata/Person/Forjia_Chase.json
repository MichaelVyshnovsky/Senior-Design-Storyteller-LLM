        "mainbody": "Forjia Chase was a rogue and operative of the Zhentarim in 1375 working within the city of Melvaunt.\nIn 1361 DR, at the young age of seven, Forija fled Zhentil Keep as it was assaulted by the armies of Cyric. Orphaned from the conflict, she was to be sold into bondage at a slave camp near Phlan by Zhent slavers. Forija escaped however, able to carve out a life on the street through thievery. Later, after working for her former captors for a time as a messenger and a runner, Forjia was able to set out on her own.\nForjia had short, curly dark hair that was unevenly cut, and her face seemed to always have a layer of dirt covering it."
