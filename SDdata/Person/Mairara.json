        "mainbody": "Mairara was a Zhentarim apprentice in the mid-14 century DR.\nShe kept her glossy black hair long. Her hands were clawed.\nMairara was treacherous, ambitious, However, she wanted to prove herself, and expected no more mercy than she gave. For whatever reason, she misliked the idea of lovers being driven against each other, or perhaps, her masters more bloodthirsty side.\nShe knew at least one spell of lightning that struck many from a distance. She also knew a spell that converted a dead gargoyle into two fresh ones.\nShe was apprenticed to Gathlarue. The two were romantically involved,\nAs of late , Mairara was with Gathlarue and Tespril at Marsember with sixteen Zhentilar as an escort when they set out to capture Shandril Shessair. The group scried on Shandril all the way, until they moved personally at Irondrake Rock.\nDuring the battle, Mairara employed a spell that converted a shattered gargoyle into two gargoyles, both of which she controlled."
