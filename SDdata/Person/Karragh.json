        "mainbody": "arragh the Skin-Cleaver was a nefarious dwarven criminal, active in Daggerford circa 1372 DR.\nKarragh was a burly well-armed and well-armored dwarf with red hair. His ears was split in three braids decorated with golden rings. He had noticeable large bulbous nose and larger than average ears. His eyes glowed with feral anger.\nKarragh was an angry and aggressive dwarf, almost to the level where one would question his sanity.\nThe house Karragh lived in was filled to the brim with barrels of alcohol. The table by the fireplace had a pile of stolen gold, and the locked and trapped loot chest held an enchanted helm, Penfalls Pot.\nThe Skin-Cleaver himself carried a potion of bulls strength, a gold ring, a piece of malachite, and a garnet.\nIn 1372 DR, Karragh, along with his three heartless and sinister mates resided in Daggerford, in a small house, adjacent to the citys southern gate, also known as the Farmers Gate. They kept an eye on merchant caravans leaving through the gate, and given opportunity, follow them, ambush, and then share the loot between themselves. One evening, they were partaking alcoholic beverages when a group of adventurers, led by the hero of Daggerford enters the unlocked building. The dwarves in feral unreasonable anger attacked the adventurers, but were killed in the scuffle."
