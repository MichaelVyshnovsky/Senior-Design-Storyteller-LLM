        "History": "Aswal was aware that many of the neighboring city-states were toppled by the people when their rulers refused to accept the Law of the Loregiver and [[Zakharan pantheon|enlightenment]]. Deeply troubled by this, he invited the entourage of warriors and mystics who brought the word of enlightenment into his city to a private audience. He met with these messengers of Fate for five days and five nights, and then deliberated with himself for another five days and five nights before finally accepting the Law of the Loregiver into his city. Upon his acceptance, Aswal stepped down from his throne and helped the messengers spread the word of the Loregiver throughout Zakhara.\n\nAswal was succeeded by his oldest child who renamed In'aash to mark the beginning of a new era of enlightenment. The new city was called [[Muluk]]."
