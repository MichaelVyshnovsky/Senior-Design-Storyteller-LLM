Soot''' was an author who dedicated their life to understanding [[evil]]s of the world, and writing about how they could be overcome.\n\n{{Quote|It has been too long, dear reader, since we last sat together. I wish it was because I'd been travelling far and wide, working to bring you more tips and tricks on how to triumph over evil. Alas, that was not the case.|''Excerpt from Elizabeth's work, ''[[A Brush with Evil: On Hags|A Brush with Evil]]''.}}",
        "History": "In their career, Elizabeth wrote a treatise on how to best outwit and overcome the deceitful nature of [[hag]]s. Unfortunately, those recommendations were not enough, as Elizabeth was actually compelled into service with a [[green hag]], and taken captive as her servant for over two years. \n\nDrawing from that experience, Elizabeth wrote ''[[A Brush with Evil: On Hags|A Brush with Evil]]'', which offered new advice on how to escape the machinations of evil hags: run away and pray the hag does not chase you down."
