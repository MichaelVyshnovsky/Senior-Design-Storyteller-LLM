'''Bransuldyn Mirrortor''' was a [[gnome]] cleric of [[Oghma]] in [[Berdusk]] in [[1359 DR]].

==Activities==
Bransuldyn, a former adventurer, managed the local temple to Oghma. Often he used his collection of disguises and went unnoticed in the city gathering lore and listening. Then, using some personally created [[spell]]s, Bransuldyn recorded what he had learned.

==Rumors==
Rumors said that Bransuldyn still adventured and he had found passages to the [[Underdark]], where he had put his treasure, which was protected by a deadly trap.
