        "mainbody": "oraboros was a pit fiend who was trapped within Ammon Jerros haven in the Sword Mountains, for the purpose of empowering the warlock, around 1374 DR.\nHe was in a constant feud with several of the other imprisoned demons and devils, but broke free when Baalbisan convinced Shandra Jerro to spill her blood to undo the magic that bound the demons to the haven.\nOnce he returned to Baator, Koraboros began to plot revenge upon Jerro for imprisoning him. Eventually he was able to lure Jerro to the ruined farm his granddaughter Shandra had once owned. Koraboros appeared before Jerro and attacked him, but Jerro was able to overcome the pit fiend with the assistance of his newfound ally, the Kalach-Cha and companions.\nThe Kalach-Cha later journeyed to the Academy of Shapers and Binders in Thay, where two pit fiends, Oronock and Thaelka, informed them that Koraboros had suffered a painful \"demotion ceremony\" for his failure to defeat Jerro."
