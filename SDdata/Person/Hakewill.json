        "mainbody": "Hakewill was a Netherese arcanist who taught at the Alchemical Seminary in Eileanar before its destruction in .\nHakewill specialized in the field of elemental fire, its applications, and the Inner Planes. He taught the subjects at the Seminary and took his students from basic principles to the most advanced concepts, taking care to make sure everyone understood the material. Despite his caution, his class suffered several fatalities, though the sense of danger only made his classes more popular. He covered topics such as the mechanics of the Inner Planes, the methods and philosophy behind opening portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire and drawing forth pure flame, and the various ways that fire could be molded and used for different purposes, whether solidified for use in catapults, imploded in fireballs, or turned to liquid that could be poured into confined underground spaces for pest removal."
