'''Daardendrien Turan''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Tymanther]] and the patriarch of [[Clan Daardendrien]] in [[1487 DR]].<ref group="note">See Notes.

==Relationships==
Turan was the father of the [[Thymari]] hero [[Daardendrien Medrash]] and of [[Daardendrien Nijana|Nijana]].<ref group="note">See Notes.

==History==
In [[1486 DR]], Turan was determining whether to appoint his son, Medrash, as a candidate for the title of [[Vanquisher]] or if he should look for a better candidate. While Medrash was a war hero of the [[Invasion of Tymanther|invasion of 1479 DR]] and had won fame in foreign courts since, he was also a [[god]] worshiper, something that would lessen his chances to win the elections.

After [[Kepeshkmolik Tarhun]] was killed in the wake of the [[Second Sundering]] and the [[First Tymanther-Unther War]], Turan was one of the elders who voted for [[Yrjixtilex Kallan]] as the next Vanquisher. He also gave his support to [[Kepeshkmolik Dumuzi]] when he petitioned the elders to give official support to the rites of [[Enlil]].
