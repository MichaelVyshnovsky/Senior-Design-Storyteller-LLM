Rueldarr was the innkeeper of the Flaming Griffon inn in Mordulkin in Chessenta in the early 1370s DR.
In the winter of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Rueldarr rented rooms to Ythnel Duumin, Kestus Aentius, Muctos Dapritus, and Kohtakah, whod just escaped to Mordulkin from Luthcheq. He sent and received messages for them.
He wore a green tunic and brown linen vest, with a very thick mustache.
