'''Briglynn''' was a mystic of the [[Earthmother]] and a shopkeeper in [[Skullport]].

==History==
Briglynn was born with [[Anithlynn]] and [[Kaitlynn]] on board a [[Moonshae Isles]] ship to a mystic of the Earthmother, [[Celya]], who lost most of her energy in childbirth. The triplets were taught from birth the mysteries of mystics. By their thirteenth birthday, Celya had died.

==Personality==
Briglynn was the most passionate of the triplets and the most self-centered. She was a quiet free spirit. She sometimes doubted her vocation and her bond with her sisters, but still loved them.

==Activities==
Briglynn managed with her sisters the [[Sisters Three Waxworks]]. She was however often busy with personal projects.
