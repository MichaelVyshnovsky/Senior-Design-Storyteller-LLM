        "History": "Wylan was a high-ranking member of the Cult of Black Earth who was disguised as a low-ranking member of the temple of [[Tymora]] in Mulmaster.\n\nAround [[1490 DR]], he resurrected his sister, [[Aleyd Burral]], after her corpse was taken from [[Phlan]].\n\nIn [[1491 DR]], Wylan was one of the chief supporters of [[Selfaril Uoumdolphin]] in his return to power, hoping to destroy the [[Church of Bane]] that had stopped the earth cultists' expansion in the city.{{Cite adventurers league/The Sword of Selfaril|15}} \n\nLater, Wylan supported his sister in creating an army in order to retake Phlan but used this opportunity to corrupt her into advancing the earth cult's cause.{{Cite adventurers league/Black Heart of Vengeance|16}} Corrupted, Aleyd began to want revenge against all her detractors, fully supported by Wylan, including a cell of the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]] and [[Ardet Peytir]] and his family.{{Cite adventurers league/Black Heart of Vengeance|5}} At last, however, an adventuring party hired by [[Blades (Mulmaster)|Blade]] [[Cora Peytir]] uncovered the truth and defeated Wylan and his minions.{{Cite adventurers league/Black Heart of Vengeance|21}}",
        "Personality": "On the surface, Wylan was a jovial and friendly individual, wanting to enjoy the finer things in life. He was quick to offer a drink, a joke, or (more commonly) both. However, it was all a facade: in truth, he was full of determined malice and passion for his cause. He usually encouraged bold actions as a sign of his (false) devotion to Tymora.{{Cite adventurers league/Black Heart of Vengeance|16}}"
