        "mainbody": "Wylan Burral was a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Black Earth in Mulmaster.\nWylan was a high-ranking member of the Cult of Black Earth who was disguised as a low-ranking member of the temple of Tymora in Mulmaster.\nAround 1490 DR, he resurrected his sister, Aleyd Burral, after her corpse was taken from Phlan.\nIn 1491 DR, Wylan was one of the chief supporters of Selfaril Uoumdolphin in his return to power, hoping to destroy the Church of Bane that had stopped the earth cultists expansion in the city. \nLater, Wylan supported his sister in creating an army in order to retake Phlan but used this opportunity to corrupt her into advancing the earth cults cause. Corrupted, Aleyd began to want revenge against all her detractors, fully supported by Wylan, including a cell of the Cult of the Eternal Flame and Ardet Peytir and his family. At last, however, an adventuring party hired by Blade Cora Peytir uncovered the truth and defeated Wylan and his minions.\nOn the surface, Wylan was a jovial and friendly individual, wanting to enjoy the finer things in life. He was quick to offer a drink, a joke, or (more commonly) both. However, it was all a facade in truth, he was full of determined malice and passion for his cause. He usually encouraged bold actions as a sign of his (false) devotion to Tymora."
