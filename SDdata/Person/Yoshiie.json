        "mainbody": "'''Yoshiie''' was a bandit leader in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Yoshiie led a bandit gang with more than 200 members, including [[korobokuru]], with a [[kensai]] second-in-command and sometimes a [[wu jen]] in his service. They were based in a secluded valley.",
        "Personality": "Yoshiie achieved his position through the use of fear, force, and brainpower. His men were like his children to him, but he was a stern \"father\" as the gang knew him. Yoshiie was protective and kind to his gang members, but had a harsh and unforgiving discipline. He received help from [[Kate Kenkichi]], but knew that one day his gang would split."
