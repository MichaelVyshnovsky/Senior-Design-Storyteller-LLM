        "mainbody": "Sheikh '''Utaiba''' was the leader of the [[Raz'hadi]] tribe of the nomadic [[Bedine]] people in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|If I understood magic better, I would ask for more of an explanation. For now, however, I will have to trust that the gods knew what they were doing when they sent the witch to us.|Sheikh Utaiba, on the presence of the witch [[Ruha]].}}",
        "Description": "While Utaiba had a the athletic build of a man in his beard had just begun to start going gray. He had intense, dark eyes that stood out from the rest of his features.\n\nThe sheikh preferred to wear a rather heavy [[jellaba]].",
        "Personality": "Utaiba was a wise and level-headed leader, often acting as a mediator when his fellow sheikhs became contentious and their passions took hold of them.",
        "Relationships": "He had a strong friendship and well-earned camaraderie with Sheikh [[Sa'ar]] of the [[Bait Mahwa]] tribe.",
        "History": "During the [[Zhentilar]] aggression against the Bedine in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Utaiba and his tribe became unable to leave their home at the Well of the Chasm oasis, due to the Zhent camp formed nearby. Fortunately, they received assistance from Sheikh Sa'ar and the Bait Mahwa. the two tribes were able to join forces and route the allied Zhents and their [[asabi]] mercenaries at the [[Battle of the Chasm]].\n\nFollowing the battles, Utaiba and Sa'ar brought together the sheikhs of thirteen other Bedine tribes to the sacred [[Elah'zad]] oasis to confer on what was to be done with the Zhentarim threat. They ultimately decided to fight as one united people, gathering all the Bedine within over a [[tenday]]'s ride away from the oasis. \n\nAfter leading the Bedine victory against the asabi at the [[Battle of the Fissures]], Utaiba and the Raz'hadi joined the other Bedine tribes in a final siege against the Zhent forces that were occupying the ruined city of [[Orofin]]. The Raz'hadi stayed in reserve, protecting the witch [[Ruha]], until she could blow open a hole in the ruined keep's walls and the tribe's warriors could rush through and defeat the malevolent outlanders. The plan was successful, and Utaiba himself fought a contingent of soldiers alone until the Raz'hadi warriors were able to catch up with their fearsome sheikh."
