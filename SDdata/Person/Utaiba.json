He had intense, dark eyes that stood out from the rest of his features.\nThe sheikh preferred to wear a rather heavy jellaba.\nUtaiba was a wise and level-headed leader, often acting as a mediator when his fellow sheikhs became contentious and their passions took hold of them.\nHe had a strong friendship and well-earned camaraderie with Sheikh Saar of the Bait Mahwa tribe.\nDuring the Zhentilar aggression against the Bedine in the , Utaiba and his tribe became unable to leave their home at the Well of the Chasm oasis, due to the Zhent camp formed nearby.

The plan was successful, and Utaiba himself fought a contingent of soldiers alone until the Razhadi warriors were able to catch up with their fearsome sheikh."
