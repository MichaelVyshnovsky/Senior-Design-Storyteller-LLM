        "Description": "Caldauvur was both handsome and strong.",
        "History": "Little was recorded of Caldauvur before his tenure as the Magister; he was known to have seized a dying [[dragon]]'s hoard at some point, and used it to pay for his tuition at a magic school somewhere south of [[Westgate]]. He then moved to the northern side of the [[Sword Coast]].\n\nHe became the Magister in autumn of the {{yearlinkName|946}}, during nuptials with the previous Magister, [[Taline Telgara]], where one of her magical wards forced him back into dragonshape, as he was a weredragon. She did not survive; his first act as the Magister was to offer his life to [[Mystra]] in order to restore Taline to life. [[Azuth]] appeared to reject his offer, asking him to be as good a Magister as she was. Though he fled to the North, and failed to defend himself thereafter, either Mystra or Azuth defended him from challengers amongst both would-be Magisters and other dragons.\n\nCaldauvur returned from his hermitage in spring. He began to give classes, accepting everyone, but making his instruction both formal and harsh; he enforced ironclad discipline with spells, and taught the ethics involved in spell-hurling alongside every spell. Though both mages and rulers came to fear [[the Schooled]], as his disciples came to be known, they still respected his goals grudgingly.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|949}}, a number of malevolent mages conspired to stop him, and took the shapes and places of a community of the Schooled in a walled manor in the lower [[Dessarin Valley]]. They attacked him ''en masse'' there; though they slew him, he slew all but two of them. One was left screaming, staring, and witless, while the other survivor became the next Magister, [[Ildathchance Orlaer]]."
