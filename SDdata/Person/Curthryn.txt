'''Curthryn''' was a brigand working for the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationship==
Curthryn was working for [[Thoadrin]].

==History==
In late {{yearlink|1357}}, Curthryn was part of a series of ambushes on [[Orthil Voldovan]]'s caravan, seeking to capture [[Shandril Shessair]]; when he reported to [[Thoadrin]], he recounted in the aftermath that, of their numbers, [[Jaskel]] and likely [[Murbryn]] had perished in the first ambush.

In a later ambush, there were only two survivors among Thoadrin's forces. Curthryn wasn't amongst them.
