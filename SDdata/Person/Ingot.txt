'''Ingot''' was a [[gnoll]] bandit who once dwelt in the [[Gnoll Stronghold]] on the [[Sword Coast]], to the south-west from [[Nashkel]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Die then, wrrrretched pinklingsss!''|Ingot}}

==Possessions==
Ingot carried a unique [[enchanted]] [[halberd]] - the ''[[Chesley Crusher]]''.

==History==
Before [[1368 DR]], Ingot, along with his gnoll tribe, occupied the old abandoned keep on the coast that came to be known as the [[Gnoll Stronghold]]. In 1368 DR, the gnolls of the stronghold captured [[Dynaheir]], a [[Rashemaar]] [[wychlaran]]. Ingot expressed a desire to roast the witch and taste her flesh instead of keeping her in the stronghold's cellars. As a result, he was banished by his fellow gnolls. Embittered, Ingot wandered the area of the [[Dryad Falls]] to the stronghold's east and encouraged adventurers to conquer the Gnoll Stronghold.
