'''Bennig''' was one of the [[Blades of the Old Man]] as of {{yearlink|1374}}. On the night of [[Tarsakh 25]], he was on guard duty at the [[Fortress of the Old Man]] together with [[Galban]], though Bennig himself tried to sleep through the watch. After Galban warned him about a light he'd seen, the two met up with [[Jerumillis]]. They pursued the light into the [[Gallery of Stone Faces]], where Jerumilis was attacked, and then they found [[Lurom]]'s body.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||29}}
