'''Olohmber Starnardyn''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|1126}} to {{yearlink|1153}}.

==Appearance==
Olohmber Starnadyn was tall, skinny, with sharp eyes, a long nose, a flowing white beard, and a sonorous voice.

==Personality==
He did not care for violence and dispute, despising both brigands and the graspingly ambitious.

==History==
By the time Olohmber had been offered the office of the [[Magister]], he had already made a small fortune by manipulating the fashions of [[Chessenta]], the [[Lake of Steam]] and [[Tashalar]]. Initially viewing the Magister's spot as an honor, the challengers soon changed his opinion of it, but it changed again as he embarked in what he saw as a project "beyond mere mortal mages". As the Magister, Olohmber decided to take as his task the breeding of mages from three rural clans west of the [[Lake of Snows]], the [[Korchul]], [[Halymmitor]] and [[Sorntin]] families.

Olohmber finally perished when he discovered three enchanted ''[[staff|staves]]'' in a cave, whose properties he attempted to discern; a trap heavily damaged him and eliminated certain spells from his memory, just in time for the owner of the staves to arrive and challenge him. Olohmber was ultimately defeated by the challenger, [[Horgyl Tusselvarr]].
