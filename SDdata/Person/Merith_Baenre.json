        "mainbody": "Merith Baenre was a drow priestess of House Baenre in Menzoberranzan.\nMerith once was the daughter of a street sweeper but her considerable clerical powers convinced Yvonnel Baenre to adopt Merith as her daughter.\nAround 1361 DR, Merith was the second-most-powerful priestess of her House and Matron Mother Triel Baenre considered her for the next Mistress of Arach-Tinilith. However, Meriths poor capacity for protocol and intrigue and her extreme sadism changed Triels mind  and the Matron Mother searched for another candidate."
