        "History": "Merith once was the daughter of a street sweeper but her considerable clerical powers convinced [[Yvonnel Baenre]] to adopt Merith as her daughter.\n\nAround [[1361 DR]], Merith was the second-most-powerful priestess of her House and Matron Mother [[Triel Baenre]] considered her for the next Mistress of [[Arach-Tinilith]]. However, Merith's poor capacity for protocol and intrigue and her extreme sadism changed Triel's mind  and the Matron Mother searched for another candidate."
