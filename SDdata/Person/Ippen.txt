Ippen was an early cleric of Gond, who was later canonized by the Church of Gond as a saint of their faith.The sourcebook with the most detail on Ippen, Faiths & Avatars, does not explicitly state that Ippen is a saint. Instead, this comes from them being the namesake of St. Ippen island. They were referred to by the Church as being Gonds "first great cleric"
* Ippen was notably the namesake of Ippensheir, the sole calendar-related festival of the Church of Gond. Ippen was said to sometimes appear before Gondar clergy in need during this time.
* When missionaries from Lantan traveled to Maztica, they named the largest island in the Green Sisters archipelago after them, St. Ippen.
