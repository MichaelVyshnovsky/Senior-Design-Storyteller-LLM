        "mainbody": "arnathan was an aarakocra and one of the ten members that served on the Absolution Council, the ruling body of the Revels End prison and the group that oversaw the fates of the prisons inmates on behalf of the Lords Alliance, during the late 15 century DR.It is unknown which settlement Jarnathan represents. Available options are Amphail, Longsaddle, Mirabar, Mithral Hall, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, and Yartar.\nAs an aarakocra, he was thought to be the councilor most likely to support pardoning and releasing prisoners. He had a distinguished air.\nHe had brown feathers and wore red robes.\nthumb|right|250px|Jarnathan has his feathers ruffled.\nIn the late 1490s DR, the Absolution Council—Jarnathan, Kriv Norixius, Voss Anderton, and Jil Torbo—were to meet in Revels End to consider a pardon for Edgin Darvis and Holga Kilgore for the crimes of skulduggery and grand larceny. However, a storm delayed Jarnathans journey so the council started without him, but Edgin kept inquiring about Jarnathans absence, when hed arrive, and how unfortunate it was that hed miss out on his story. forcing him to fly them to ice below. Jarnathan was knocked out by the hard landing, but survived.\nMore than a year later, the same council met to consider Forge Fitzwilliam for pardon, but were wise to the same tricks and refused him. Forge also grabbed Jarnathan and tried to jump through the window, only to find it bricked up behind a curtain, stunning both himself and the poor aarakocra."
