However, a storm delayed Jarnathan's journey so the council started without him, but Edgin kept inquiring about Jarnathan's absence, when he'd arrive, and how unfortunate it was that he'd miss out on his story. forcing him to fly them to ice below. Jarnathan was knocked out by the hard landing, but survived.\n\nMore than a year later, the same council met to consider [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] for pardon, but were wise to the same tricks and refused him. Forge also grabbed Jarnathan and tried to jump through the window, only to find it bricked up behind a curtain, stunning both himself and the poor aarakocra."
