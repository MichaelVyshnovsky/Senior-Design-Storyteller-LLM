        "mainbody": "Byuchyuch was a goblin slave of House DoUrden in the drow city of Menzoberranzan.\nByuchyuch became an \"indentured servant\" to House DoUrden circa 1307 DR.\nIn or around 1317 DR, he was summoned by Maya and Malice DoUrden to play a part in their plan to force Drizzt DoUrden to shed blood before entering Melee-Magthere, the drow fighters academy. Malice magically turned Byuchyuchs appearance into that of a drow and Maya presented him as her champion, challenging Drizzt to a fight. Drizzt easily overcame the poor fighter. While Byuchyuch was helpless, Drizzt was magically compelled by Malice to kill him. Doing so made Byuchyuch the first being Drizzt had killed."
