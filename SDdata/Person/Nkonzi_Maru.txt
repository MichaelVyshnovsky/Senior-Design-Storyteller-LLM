Nkonzi Maru was a ranger from Katashaka and, with her husband Kwanza, joint leader of the Anaconda mercenary company and warrior society in the mid–14 century DR.
Together with her husband Kwanza, she commanded their operations in the Heartlands of Faerûn in the early 1360s DR. She was an intelligent commander who hated losing people in her corps.
She was a veteran wilderness ranger and specialized in the use of a spear. Nkonzi had several animal companions, with a white tiger and a pair of hawks.
She fought with a +3 spear of hurling and wore a necklace of chameleon power and bracers of defense.
