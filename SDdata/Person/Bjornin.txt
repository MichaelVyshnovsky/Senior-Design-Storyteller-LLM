'''Bjornin''' was a brave [[paladin]] who lived on the [[Sword Coast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Bjornin wore a [[plate mail]] and was armed with an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[spear]]. Among his other possessions, Bjornin carried a ''+1 enchanted'' [[shield]].

==History==
Some time during the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Bjornin was attacked by a band of [[half-ogre]]s some ways northwest of [[Nashkel]] in [[Amn]]. He survived the encounter, but was forced to flee to the town of [[Beregost]] in order to rest and recover.

While he was stuck in town, Bjornin stayed at the [[Jovial Juggler]] and sought out adventurers to bring justice upon his monstrous assailants.
