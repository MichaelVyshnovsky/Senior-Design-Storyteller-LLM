The '''Head Taker''' was a particularly deadly [[Tasked genie|tasked]] [[slayer genie]] inhabiting the fortress of [[Krak al-Mazhar]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{Cite dragon/268/Secrets of the Brotherhood of the True Flame}}

==Description==
Foes who proved to be worthy adversaries were rewarded by becoming trophies of the Head Taker. He proudly displayed their mummified shrunken heads across a leather [[baldric]] strapped to his muscular chest.

==Activities==
The Head Taker served as the bodyguard and personal assassin of [[Nar-Aidiya]]. Given the fierce reputation of both Nar-Aidiya and the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]], the Head Taker reveled in his position because it allowed him to display his violent nature. 

==Possessions==
The Head Taker wielded a pair of incredibly powerful magical [[great scimitar]]s called ''[[Widowmaker]]'' and ''[[Firefiend]]''. Despite the size of the weapons, he wielded both one-handed. The claws on his remaining two hands were coated with a deadly contact poison.
