        "mainbody": "'''Tasha Brightbottle''' was a [[Zhentarim]] [[hin]] [[rogue]] from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Tasha felt blessed to be born a halfling. She was deft and plucky since her early years.",
        "History": "Tasha was born into a pastoral hin community. Growing up, she gained respect from her peers for her attitude and roguish talent, helped by the woman's short stature. At a young age, Tasha was given cruel lessons in life, that sometimes one's hands were bound to be bloodied if the job was to be done. This eventually led her to join the Black Network, the dreaded Zhentarim, as a perfect [[assassin]]. Tasha enjoyed the respect the organization had for her skills and the fact that Zhents got to wear the coolest clothes only sealed the deal. When not tasked with the Network's dark business, Tasha Brightbottle enjoyed wandering towns and cities in the guise of a simple messenger. During such strolls, the hin Zhen gathered intel and assessed possible threats to her organization. In the 1490s [[DR]], aged one hundred and seventy-five winters, Tasha's work led her to the city of Baldur's Gate â€“ a hive of plots, agendas, dark secrets, and expert snooping. During her time in the Gate, Tasha found herself knee-deep in various misadventures."
