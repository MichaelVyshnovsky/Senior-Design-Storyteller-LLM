Stonespeaker Hgraam was the leader of the stone giants of Gracklstugh and a cleric of Skoraeus Stonebones in the late 14 through to late 15 centuries DR.
Hgraam was a capable leader for his people, known for his intelligence, diplomatic skills, and martial prowess. However, he was strict and demanding, but never cruel and his word was his bond. He did not much like the Council of Savants, nor did they like him. Hgraam despised the new ruler Horgar Steelshadow for his enormous ambition and the rumors of his involvement in the death of King Tarngardt
Hgraam served both as chief and shaman of the Clan Clairngorm in Gracklstugh.
In his youth, Hgraam went to the mystical library of Gravenhollow.
Circa 1486 DR, he sensed that some great evil had infiltrated the Underdark, but wasnt aware of the threats danger or extent.
In the late 1400s DR, he had some apprentices, among them Dorhun and Rihuud.
