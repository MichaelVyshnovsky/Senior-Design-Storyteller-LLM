Stonespeaker '''Hgraam''' was the leader of the [[stone giant]]s of [[Gracklstugh]] and a cleric of [[Skoraeus Stonebones]] in the late 14{{th}} through to late 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Personality==
Hgraam was a capable leader for his people, known for his intelligence, diplomatic skills, and martial prowess. However, he was strict and demanding, but never cruel and his word was his bond. He did not much like the [[Council of Savants]], nor did they like him. Hgraam despised the new ruler [[Horgar Steelshadow]] for his enormous ambition and the rumors of his involvement in the death of King [[Tarngardt]]

==Activities==
Hgraam served both as chief and shaman of the [[Clan Clairngorm]] in Gracklstugh.

==History==
In his youth, Hgraam went to the mystical library of [[Gravenhollow]].

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], he sensed that some great evil had infiltrated the Underdark, but wasn't aware of the threat's danger or extent.

==Relationship==
In the late 1400s DR, he had some apprentices, among them [[Dorhun]] and [[Rihuud]].
