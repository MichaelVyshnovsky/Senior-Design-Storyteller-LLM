        "mainbody": "Mynnsha was a priestess of Talona active in Bezantur, Thay as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR. She was the High Priestess of the Temple of Talona in that city as well as the chief priest for the entire Thayan church of Talona.\nLike the rest of her fellow priests and priestesses, Mynnsha had fanciful tattoos and scars on her body.\nShe delighted in the spread of disease and poison.\nMany in Bezantur&mdashfrom the commonfolk to the Red Wizards&mdashsuspected that Mynnsha and her followers were responsible for the many poisonings that happened throughout the city. Regardless of the truth of these accusations, Mynnsha bribed the citys authorities to leave her alone and to provide support if and when the citizenry attacked her temple in an angry mob."
