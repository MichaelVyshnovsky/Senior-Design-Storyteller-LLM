        "mainbody": "Shaundyl Berethryl was a gold elf that lived in the Hullack Forest circa the .\nShaundyl was  tall and had the physical grace typical of a gold elf. He spoke softly but had a menacing edge to his voice and mannerisms whenever he spoke to or about humans. He typically wore black clothing and carried many throwing knives on his person.\nShaundyl was extremely protective of his forest and would never willingly deal with people who burned or chopped down trees. He held a grudge against the humans of Cormyr and wanted nothing more than reclaiming the region for the elves.\nHe was a dominant force in the Hullack Forest and could command many of its beasts to protect him or do his bidding. They guarded him against hunting parties that entered the forest and got too close to his home.\nAs long as it did not involve harming the land, the water, or the trees, Shaundyl would covertly help anyone that wanted to foment unrest in Cormyr with the aim of bringing down the Obarskyr dynasty, reducing the power of the War Wizards, or just bring panic and slaughter to the relatively peaceful kingdom. Contacting him was risky. The safest method was to leave a written message in the verge of the Hullack Forest asking for a meeting at some nearby inn or holding. He was informed of intrusions into his forest and would typically find the message and then show up at the meeting place with a full retinue of guardian beasts ready for perfidy.\nShaundyl Berethryl was born in  and was over a thousand years old when Cormyr was founded. He considered humans \"bestial and unwashed\" and was angry and bitter when they were given charter to form the realm in Lythtlorn (the elvish name for the Wolf Woods)."
