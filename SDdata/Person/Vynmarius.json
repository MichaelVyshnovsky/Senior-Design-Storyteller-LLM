        "mainbody": "'''Vynmarius''' was an open [[wizard]], as well as an agent of the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]], who lived within the city of [[Athkatla]] around the year [[1370 DR]]. While his service to the Council, along with his freedom to practice the [[arcane]] in [[Amn]]'s capital, was well known, Vynmarius' allegiance was also rumored to extend to the enigmatic [[Cult of the Dragon]].\n\nDespite the openness Vynmarius enjoyed as a mage who practiced within the city, he emanated a presence of suspicion and hostility."
