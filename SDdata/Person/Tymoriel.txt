'''Tymoriel''', known as '''Tym''' by some, was an unexperienced [[elf|elven]] [[enchanter]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Tymoriel's humble possessions included non-magical [[robe]]s, a [[dagger]], and a ''[[spellbook]]'', as well as a [[component pouch]].

==History==
In the mid-14{{th}} century DR, Tymoriel the Enchanter took on an adventurer's mantle in his quest to learn more about life and [[the Art]]. Still inexperienced, Tymoriel managed to survive some ordeals, including an adventure that left him with a phobia of [[lycanthrope]]s.
