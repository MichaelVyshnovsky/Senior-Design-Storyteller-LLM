Tymoriel, known as Tym by some, was an unexperienced elven enchanter in the mid-14 century DR.
Tymoriels humble possessions included non-magical robes, a dagger, and a spellbook, as well as a component pouch.
In the mid-14 century DR, Tymoriel the Enchanter took on an adventurers mantle in his quest to learn more about life and the Art. Still inexperienced, Tymoriel managed to survive some ordeals, including an adventure that left him with a phobia of lycanthropes.
