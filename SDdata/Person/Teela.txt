Teela was a viper and a companion of the druid Kagha.
Teela could readily communicate with Kagha. It was unknown if this originated from Kaghas druidic powers, or a special bond held by the pair.
A single bite from Teela could prove deadly to smaller individuals, such as children.
Teela gladly served at Kaghas beck and call, specifically when she sought to threaten and intimidate others.
In the , Kagha took over leadership of the Emerald Grove when her superior, archdruid Halsin, went away on trek to uncover more about goings-on in the region. After a community of tiefling refugees from Elturel had been granted refuge in the grove by Halsin, and a child named Arabella from among their ranks attempted to steal the Idol of Silvanus from the druids.
Kagha used Teela to frighten the child into confessing her crime and had the viper remained poised to strike, and execute her brand of justice.
