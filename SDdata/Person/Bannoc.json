        "mainbody": "annoc, son of Enroc, was a cleric of Tyr and a venerated of Myth Drannor who died before the citys destruction in the Weeping War of 714 DR.\nBannoc famously wielded the hammer of justice, a powerful enchanted warhammer of his church. The hero took his weapon to the grave.\nBannoc was laid to rest inside a heroes crypt in the Elven Catacombs First Cellar, alongside his fellow heroes, Arianna the Archer, Erik Sliphand the rogue, Magister Luther, Shyla of Damara, and Sindar the Warrior. Their graves remain undisturbed for centuries until 1369 DR when the Cult of the Dragon invaded the ruins and allowed their drow allies to loot the catacombs of their ancient enemies. All six heroes graves were forever changed in the chaos of the Weeping War, twisted into undead perverse versions of themselves. The heroes were cursed to guard their cherished artifacts as wraiths, ready to attack anyone stupid or brave enough to steal the magic items from the sarcophagi."
