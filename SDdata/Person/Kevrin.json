        "Activities": "Kevrin whiled away his days in his quarters, which he shared with [[Shan Thar]], idly reading books on outdated magical theory and nursing strong liquor.\n\nIn the evenings, he assisted in the nightly stargazing ceremonies in the temple's outer courtyard, casting ''[[silent image]]'' to create illusions of brightened stars and animated constellations overheard as Shan Thar named and revered the astronomical bodies.",
        "History": "Kevrin was a man who did ill in his past, and to soothe his conscience he offered his services to the new Temple of Mystra in Wheloon.",
        "Personality": "Kevrin had a rather dour and resigned personality, but was a devout follower of [[Mystra]] and greatly trusting of the priests at the temple. He was rather tough.",
