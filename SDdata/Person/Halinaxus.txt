Halinaxus was a red dragon at the Fane of the Eye under Tyar-Besil during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Halinaxus toyed with the idea of allying with the Cult of the Eternal Flame. He sensed the power they had and hoped to one day seize it for himself. He liked the treasures that Vanifer promised to him, but could not decide if he should join them.
In 1491 DR, Halinaxus was in the Fanes Eternal Flame section until some adventurers infiltrated the fane and confronted him.
