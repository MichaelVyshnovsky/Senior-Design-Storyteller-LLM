{{quote|Work fast, do much in a day, keep prices low.|Ilbrelm's motto}}

==Personality==
Ilbrelm was stolid and patient, and a hard worker.

==Activities==
Ilbrelm's business made shoes, [[sandal]]s, slippers, and [[clog]]s of all sizes in mundane designs. They were produced in great quantities for low prices, but they rarely lasted longer than a season. They were commonly worn by poor folk across [[Faerûn]] who lacked the coin for better, longer-lasting footware.

Similarly, Ilbrelm hired the poor, orphans, outcasts, and disabled and deformed people in need from around [[Turmish]]. While the work was hard, he provided shelter, warmth, food, and the support of a big family of fellow employees.

His company was a supplier of the [[Sembia]]n trader [[Melvos Hammerstars]].
