Alfun Deeprock was a deep gnome cultist of Ogrémoch and a member of the Cult of the Black Earth in the Underdark beneath the Moonsea.
In 1491 DR, he and his fellow Lorn Tauth discovered that the Seed of Fel Earth, a sentient stone part of Ogrémoch, was located inside a mine near Mulmasters Underdark trading post of Fort Iron. They organized an expedition before the rightful owner of the mine, Leleanor, could claim it. However, as Alfun and Lorn found the Seed, they were confronted and defeated by an adventuring party hired by Leleanor to explore the mine.
