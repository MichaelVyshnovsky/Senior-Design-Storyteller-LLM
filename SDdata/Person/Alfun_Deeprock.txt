'''Alfun Deeprock''' was a [[deep gnome]] cultist of [[Ogrémoch]] and a member of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] in the [[Underdark]] beneath the [[Moonsea]].

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], he and his fellow [[Lorn Tauth]] discovered that the [[Seed of Fel Earth]], a sentient stone part of Ogrémoch, was located inside a mine near [[Mulmaster]]'s Underdark trading post of [[Fort Iron]]. They organized an expedition before the rightful owner of the mine, [[Leleanor]], could claim it. However, as Alfun and Lorn found the Seed, they were confronted and defeated by an adventuring party hired by Leleanor to explore the mine.
