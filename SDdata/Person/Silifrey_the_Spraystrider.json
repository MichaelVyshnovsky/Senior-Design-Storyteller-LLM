        "mainbody": "ilifrey the Spraystrider was an Illuskan wizard of around the 2 century DR. She was rumored to practice dangerous dark magic.\nAccording to the Hegredathas, a written history of the Delimbiyr Vale, Silifrey commissioned the master dwarven builder Iirikos Stoneshoulder to build the Granite Tower. However, his elven friends had heard the rumors and warned and pleaded with him not to. Iirikos ignored them, leaving them bewildered by his choice, and built the Granite Tower swiftly using summoned elementals. But, unknown to her, he also installed magical wards that would activate and destroy any who worked evil magic within its walls. Silifrey was slain before a month had passed.\nHowever, by the 14 century DR, it was still feared that Silifrey the Spraystrider had cursed the Granite Tower or that her vengeful ghost still haunted it. They even suggested her spirit sometimes went on rampages and was responsible for the regular disappearances of the populace of the village of Shining Falls that had sprung up around the tower."
