'''Urdek''' was a member of the criminal underbelly of [[Phlan]] who was one of the first victims of resurfaced ''[[pool of radiance]]'' in [[1369 DR]].

{{quote|''That's right. A quarter for each of you, a quarter for me, and a quarter for my [[stiletto|friend]] here.''|Urdek}}

==Description==
Urdek was a young man, taller and stronger than his peers. He wore a tenday stubble on his face, and his eyes were dark with malice. He did not hesitate to betray others when [[coin]] was involved. He was willing to go as far as murder to take home more of the stolen coin.

==Possessions==
Urdek was armed with his trusty [[stiletto]].

==History==
In 1369 DR, Urdek was a part of a gang of three criminals who operated out of abandoned [[Valjevo Castle]] in Phlan. On one fateful day, the three chiefs were discussing splitting the day's loot between them. Urdek being the largest man out of three, attempted to threaten them with his stiletto, demanding a larger share, only to murder one of his buddies and wounding the other. During the same moment, the dreaded ''pool of radiance'' breathed back to life, refilling the crescent-shaped hole in the ground, empty for decades. The pool devoured the dead thief and grasped the wounded one. Urdek watch in morbid curiosity as his two recent allies were twisted into [[undead]] creatures. The whole scene was witnessed by [[Kestrel]], another thief who was hiding her own loot nearby. She did not know of Urdek's fate, as she used the advancing monsters to slip away from the castle's dungeon unnoticed.
