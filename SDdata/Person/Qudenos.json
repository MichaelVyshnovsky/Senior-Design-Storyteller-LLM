        "mainbody": "'''Qudenos''' was a [[red dragon]], who called himself Master of Flames and Splitter of Skies, that lived its life in service to the [[githyanki]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "Qudenos served as as the steed for [[Kith'rak]] [[Voss]].\n\nHe was intent on battling against [[Vlaakith CLVII|Vlaakith]] and was not loyal to her but to the people.",
        "History": "He originally served the githyanki, along with other red dragons, under a pact made with the archdevil [[Tiamat]].\n\nIn the [[Faer√ªn]]ian {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Voss and Qudenos, along with other githyanki knights, traveled in pursuit of an [[illithid]] [[nautiloid]] that was in possession of a powerful [[mysterious artifact|gith weapon]]. They traversed the planes from the city of [[Yartar]] on [[Toril]] on the [[Prime Material Plane|Prime]], through [[Cania]] and [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]], and back to Toril in the region of the [[Sword Coast]].\n\nAfter beginning patrols on a stretch of the [[Risen Road]], Qudenos incinerated a group of [[Flaming Fist]] soldiers at Voss's direction.",
        "Personality": "He knew [[Orpheus]] and anticipated a new future after the wake of the Comet. He planned to join forces in rebellion against Vlaakith with an uncountable number of fellow dragons."
