Ramael the Reader was a native from Halruaa who lived in the Dalelands in 1367 DR.
One of Ramael eyes was lost during his escape from Halruaa.
Due to events that occured in his past, Ramael was a cautious individual who was always looking over his shoulder.
Accused of spell theft, which was a serious offense in Halruaa, Ramael had to fight his way out of Halruaa in order to survive. He took up residence in the Dalelands where he posed as a bard.
Ramael owned many magical items including a harp of Myth Drannor, an amulet of proof against detection and location, and a ring of mind shielding.
Ramael created several spells during his lifetime.
Ramael earned his nickname the Reader because of his fondness for ESP spells.
