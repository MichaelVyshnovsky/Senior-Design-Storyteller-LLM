'''Liam''' was a adventurer who journeyed on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|He j-just said some wizard called Lorroakan would reward us if we found it. That's all!|Liam, on the ''Nightsong''.}}

==Description==
He was a fit man, who had shaggy, short-cropped ginger hair.

==Relationships==
Liam was part of an adventuring party led by a man named [[Aradin]]. Their group also included [[Remira]], [[Barth]], and a man named [[Brian (dwarf)|Brian]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Liam was and his fellow adventurers were hired by the [[Baldurian]] [[wizard]] [[Lorroakan]] to recover an artifact known as the ''[[Nightsong]]''. To accomplish their mission, they served as guides to the [[archdruid]], Master [[Halsin]] of the [[Emerald Grove]], and made their way out to the [[Shattered Sanctum]] temple. The powerful druid had a different goal: investigating strange goings-on related to [[mind flayer]] tadpole infections in the region.

The group was caught by the [[cult of the Absolute]] during their excursion; a few made it out, but Halsin, Liam and Brain were taken prisoner within. Liam was forced to endure torture at the hands of the [[goblin]] [[Spike (goblin)|Spike]], as [[True Soul]] [[Minthara Baenre]] attempted to uncover the secret location of the Emerald Grove enclave.
