        "mainbody": "Valas Jaelre was a drow wizard who held the position of senior mage in an outpost of House Jaelre in Cormanthor.\nValas was the senior mage in an outpost of House Jaelre, which served as a launching point for attacks against the Dalelands and followers of Lolth.\nHis role was that of the primary spellcaster. Other duties of his were to supply his fellows with alchemical goods like flasks of acid, alchemists fire, smokesticks, tanglefoot bags and thunderstones, but also with magical drugs like kammarth and ziran, which were distributed by the outposts leaders. He had an own laboratory, which had resting quarters just for him, for this purpose.\nHis role in regards to defending the outpost was to assist the defensive efforts with his spells. But he was also given the right to judge an attack as too strong for the drow at his own discretion and to change his course of action to ensure the safety of his fellows. This was done by him opening a portal created by him after ensuring that the drow were close enough to escape safely with him.\nHe was the second cousin to Jezz the Lame.\nHe was the senior mage and thus the superior of Drisinil, the junior mage of the outpost.\nHe was apparently valued enough by his fellows to be given a private resting place in his laboratory, something normally not provided among the drow of House Jaelre.\nHe was a capable alchemist. He collected special fungi, which grew in the outposts privy, as ingredients for his products.\nHe was also capable of creating potions and portals. The portal in the outpost was created through his usage of a scroll of teleportation circle.\nHis duties included the organization of his fellows escape route in the face of an overwhelming attack. To ensure this, he always prepared an invisibility and a passwall spell to reach and open the portal in safety, which served as the aforementioned escape route."
