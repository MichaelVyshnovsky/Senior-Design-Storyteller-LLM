        "mainbody": "'''Valas Jaelre''' was a [[drow]] [[wizard]] who held the position of senior mage in an outpost of [[House Jaelre]] in [[Cormanthor]].",
        "Duties": "Valas was the senior mage in an outpost of House Jaelre, which served as a launching point for attacks against the [[Dalelands]] and followers of [[Lolth]].\n\nHis role was that of the primary spellcaster. Other duties of his were to supply his fellows with alchemical goods like flasks of [[acid]], [[alchemist's fire]], [[smokestick]]s, [[tanglefoot bag]]s and [[thunderstone (alchemical item)|thunderstones]], but also with magical drugs like [[kammarth]] and [[ziran]], which were distributed by the outpost's leaders. He had an own laboratory, which had resting quarters just for him, for this purpose.\n\nHis role in regards to defending the outpost was to assist the defensive efforts with his spells. But he was also given the right to judge an attack as too strong for the drow at his own discretion and to change his course of action to ensure the safety of his fellows. This was done by him opening a ''[[portal]]'' created by him after ensuring that the [[drow]] were close enough to escape safely with him.",
        "Relationship": "He was the second cousin to [[Jezz the Lame]].\n\nHe was the senior mage and thus the superior of Drisinil, the junior mage of the outpost.\n\nHe was apparently valued enough by his fellows to be given a private resting place in his laboratory, something normally not provided among the [[drow]] of [[House Jaelre]].",
        "Abilities": "He was a capable alchemist. He collected special fungi, which grew in the outpost's privy, as ingredients for his products.\n \nHe was also capable of creating potions and ''[[portal]]s''. The portal in the outpost was created through his usage of a scroll of ''[[teleportation circle]]''.\n\nHis duties included the organization of his fellows' escape route in the face of an overwhelming attack. To ensure this, he always prepared an ''[[invisibility]]'' and a ''[[passwall]]'' spell to reach and open the portal in safety, which served as the aforementioned escape route."
