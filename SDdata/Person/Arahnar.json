She does not remember who caused these injuries, how she got separated from her pack, or much about her pack, but she is determined to find them again.\nArahnar has trim build, dark hair and dark eyes. She has hawkish features. Because of her lycanthropy, she prefers loose-fitted garments that wont tear when she changes shape.\nArahnar carries both a dagger and a short sword and is equally dangerous with either.\nArahnar believed that the Circle of Vehlarr was the key to her finding her pack again. She remembered hearing legends about it when she was a child and it is holy to her people. She travelled to Scornubel with Kharran to find Angah Lalla, the fence whom she believes to possess a map to the Circle. Kharran defeated all three but not without injury to himself, and the pair seized the map and made their exit.\nArahnar discovered from the map that her pack had likely gone to Myth Lharast,\nBack in Scornubel, Avan gave Arahnar a ring with several charges of both detect lycanthrope and teleport without error so that she could use them together to become reunited with her pack, and offered to recharge the ring if she returned to him. She used the ring to transport with Kharran to the last known home of her pack, a cave in the Wood of Sharp Teeth. There\nthey encountered two hostile werewolves who attacked them. The outcome of this combat is unclear.\nCategoryWerewolves\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryThieves\nCategoryInhabitants of Scornubel\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of the Western Heartlands\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryLycanthropes\nbq1dew56dkkjr1aitxlct9czm2nngqb"
