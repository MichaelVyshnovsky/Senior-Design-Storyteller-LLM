Gwyon Ironhoof was the king of the centaurs of Evermeet in 1367 DR.
In his youth, Gwyon fought in Faer√ªn together with the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company.
In old age, he settled as a king in Evermeet but soon became bored of the peace of that kingdom and hoped to one day go back to Faerun as an agent of Queen Amlaruil Moonflower, but was too proud to ask her permission.
Gwyon was a loyal and wise leader. He kept secret his wanderlust.
Gwyon had good dealings with the elf queen Amlaruil.
