            "Gameplay": "If the [[Kalach-Cha]] gained entrance to Blacklake, then Cain would embarrass one of the performers. The Kalach-Cha could choose act in his performance, by repeating his tones, either with honest skill or having [[Grobnar Gnomehands]] repeat the tones. After each successful performance, the Kalach-Cha could impress the audience or insult Cain. Furthermore, [[Qara]] could make fireworks, [[Sand (individual)|Sand]] could insult Cain, or Grobnar could play a duet with the Kalach-Cha in the final performance. Cain would be surprised and give them a lute. If the Kalach-Cha failed, they could attack Cain with fire and get the lute back."
