'''Forgemaster Inkstain''' was a [[dwarf]] printer based in [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
In the early 1360s DR, he had a shop on Scribes' Alley in the [[Merchant District]] of Procampur, though it was little more than a lean-to against a [[teamster]]'s stable. There, he had a [[printing press]], a recent invention that he'd shipped from [[Dwarves' Deep (settlement)|Dwarves' Deep]]. From his shop, he printed cheap and low-quality pamphlets, handbills, and flyers. Perhaps surprisingly for a dwarf, he had an [[ogre]] apprentice named [[Aguul]].

==History==
He originally came from Dwarves' Deep, but later moved to Procampur.

In the [[1362 DR|Year of the Helm, 1362 DR]], the [[lama]] [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]] visited Inkstain to discuss printing his new book, ''[[A History of the Tuigan]]''. However, Inkstain quoted a price of 10,000 [[golden lion (coin)|gold lion]]s for just one copy, and 500 lions for extras, which Koja was unable to pay or raise the money for. Fortunately, the god [[Deneir]] later appeared to Koja and granted him [[gem]]s worth at least 10,000 gold pieces to pay for the costs of printing, so Koja planned to have his book printed by Inkstain the next day.

==Description==
Inkstain was named for his appearance, as he was covered all over with [[ink]] stains. His beard might have been white, but was gray with ink. He was cantankerous when working, often yelling at Aguul, but was polite to customers.
