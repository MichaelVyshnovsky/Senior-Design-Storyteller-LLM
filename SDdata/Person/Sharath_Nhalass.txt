'''Sharath Nhalass''', who was called '''the Doomed''', was the fourteenth and final [[Arkhan (title)|Arkhan]] of the [[Nhalass Dynasty]] to rule the nation of [[Raumathar]].

==Activities==
Two of Sharath's older brothers were killed by [[demon]]s sent by [[Narfell]], causing him to inherit the throne in {{Yearlink|-605}}. However, Sharath met his brother's fate later that same year and the bloodline of the Nhalass Dynasty ended with his death.

==Relationships==
Shareth was the youngest of five sons of [[Darthen Nhalass III]]. His eldest brother died with their father while invading Narfell. His next oldest brothers were [[Umathar Nhalass VI|Umathar VI]], [[Rhendar Nhalass II|Rhendar II]], and [[Tharren Nhalass|Tharren]].
