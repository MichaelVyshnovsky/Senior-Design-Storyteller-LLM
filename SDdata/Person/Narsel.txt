'''Narsel''' was a [[wizard]] who lived some time during the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was proud and foolish, often bragging about his exploits and insulting others.

==History==
Narsel was the apprentice of [[Rathdaen]]. Rathdaen gave Narsel his [[Tome of Rathdaen|tome]] of collected magic upon his death. The precious tome was later nearly destroyed when Rathdaen battled [[Sapphail]]. Sapphail called a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' down upon Rathdaen, slaying him and almost destroying the tome.
