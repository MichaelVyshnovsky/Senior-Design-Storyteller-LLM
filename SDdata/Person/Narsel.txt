Narsel was a wizard who lived some time during the 7 century DR.
He was proud and foolish, often bragging about his exploits and insulting others.
Narsel was the apprentice of Rathdaen. Rathdaen gave Narsel his tome of collected magic upon his death. The precious tome was later nearly destroyed when Rathdaen battled Sapphail. Sapphail called a meteor swarm down upon Rathdaen, slaying him and almost destroying the tome.
