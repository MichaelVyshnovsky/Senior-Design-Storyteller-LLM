        "mainbody": "'''Lakrissa''' was a [[tiefling]] from [[Elturel]] that resettled at the [[Emerald Grove]] along with others of her kin during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Plenty of us fell to monsters already. I don't see the rest of us lasting long out there.|Lakrissa, to one of the [[True Soul]]s.}}",
        "Personality": "She had a flippant if not pessimistic outlook on life, to the point of wagering [[gp|gold]] on the survival of her people.",
        "History": "When Elturel was briefly [[the Descent|pulled down]] to [[Avernus]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lakrissa and other tieflings in the city were exiled from their home. Lakrissa joined the group under the leadership of [[Zevlor]], who led them west towards [[Baldur's Gate]]. \n\nWhen the group was forced to find shelter at the Emerald Grove due to rampant [[goblin]]oid attacks, Lakrissa served as sentry looking over the [[River Chionthar]].\n\nIf the tiefling refugees managed to safely leave the Emerald Grove, then Lakrissa would join them on their journey towards Baldur's Gate. However, their convoy would be attacked in the Shadow-Cursed Lands by [[Absolute]] cultists. She and a small group of tiefling refugees would be taken prisoner and locked up under [[Moonrise Towers]].\n\nShe was in a relationship with the bard [[Alfira]] and would go on to help her partner realize her dreams of starting a school of bards."
