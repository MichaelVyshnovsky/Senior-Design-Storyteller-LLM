Lakrissa joined the group under the leadership of Zevlor, who led them west towards Baldurs Gate. \nWhen the group was forced to find shelter at the Emerald Grove due to rampant goblinoid attacks, Lakrissa served as sentry looking over the River Chionthar.\nIf the tiefling refugees managed to safely leave the Emerald Grove, then Lakrissa would join them on their journey towards Baldurs Gate. However, their convoy would be attacked in the Shadow-Cursed Lands by Absolute cultists. She and a small group of tiefling refugees would be taken prisoner and locked up under Moonrise Towers.\nShe was in a relationship with the bard Alfira and would go on to help her partner realize her dreams of starting a school of bards."
