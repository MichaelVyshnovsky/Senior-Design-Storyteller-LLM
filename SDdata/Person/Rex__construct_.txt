'''Rex''' was a [[shield guardian]] and companion of the [[rock gnome]] [[Zox Clammersham]] that lived within [[Undermountain]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Unlike other shield guardians, Rex was not keyed to a [[magic]]al [[amulet]]. As such, he could never be commanded by another individual. Thanks to Zox, Rex had a ''[[greater invisibility]]'' [[spell]] stored within itself.

Somewhat unique in appearance, Rex had gold stars and crescent moons painted on its surface.
