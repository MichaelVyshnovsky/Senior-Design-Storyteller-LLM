'''Pentical Bleth''' was a high-ranking member of the [[Bleth]] noble house in [[Westgate]] and member of the ruling [[Council of Merchants]] around [[1374 DR]].

==History==
In 1374 DR, in order to increase her power, Pentical allied with an adventurer who was fighting the [[Night Masks]]. At last, however, Pentical was captured by the Night Masks and killed by the [[vampire]] cabal that ruled the guild.
