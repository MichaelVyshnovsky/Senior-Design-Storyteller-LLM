Narl Xibrindas () was the wizard advisor of the Xanathar in Waterdeep during the early 1490s DR.
Usually Narl was in the audience chamber inside the Xanathars lair.
The familys house was destroyed and only Narl and his elder brother Soluun survived. They decided to join Bregan Daerthe.
In 1491 DR, Narl was assigned a mission to infiltrate the Xanathars Thieves Guild and get closer to the beholder crime lord. Narl was so successful that he became the only advisor of the Xanathar.
In 1492 DR, however, Narl was worried about the growing paranoia of the beholder, whod started to suspect something about the drow.
Narl was a nervous individual. He always chose his personal safety over that of his allies. He had with him a secret poison to blind the Xanathar. 
Narl had always at his side a grell bodyguard assigned by the Xanathar the grell had secret orders to dispose of the drow if it saw signs of disloyalty.
