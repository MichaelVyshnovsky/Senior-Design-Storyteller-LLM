        "mainbody": "Shristisanti, the Guardian of the Atrocity, was a massive serpentine being that dwelled within the ruins of Hisari for untold ages leading up to the late 15 century DR.\nThe guardian of Hisari had an elongated serpentine body, with a humanoid torso and snake-like head. He was approximately between  in length.While this measurement is not given, it was stated that Shristisanti was easily twice the size of a yuan-ti abomination. He had mottled yellow scales that were encrusted with some unknown mineral formations.\nShristisanti could not be harmed while in the inner chamber of the sarrukh temple of Hisari. He was seemingly protected by the same magical barrier that safeguarded the Torque within.\nWhen he remained in his lair, Shristisanti could conjure forth waves of liquefied glass and hurl it at his foes.\nShristisanti wore a bejeweled breastplate upon his torso, along with bands of gold on his upper arms.\nShristisantis whole existence revolved around retrieving the last remaining blood of the entity known as the Captive, and using it to destroy the artifact known as the Torque.\nIn the , a group of adventurers―Harp Levesque, Amhar, Liel, Kitto, and Verran―entered into Shristisantis lair in an attempt to seize the Torque and keep it out of the possession of the mage Tresco Maynard. Unbeknownst to the group, Verran had stolen the blood of the Captive and had unknowingly drawn the attention of the Torques guardian.\nShristisanti attacked the group and easily took the upper hand in the conflict. The group however used the blood to lure Shristisanti away from his lair, allowing them to score a few weakening blows with their weapons. Finally, the dwarf Amhar triggered an enormous trap set within the grand mosaics that lined the inner walls of Hisaris temple, that rapidly triggered another similar trap. Shristisanti was trapped in a chain reaction of explosions and his body was shredded by hundreds of glass and ceramic shards."
