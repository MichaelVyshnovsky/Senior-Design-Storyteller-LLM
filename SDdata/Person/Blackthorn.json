        "History": "Blackthorn was a [[half-elf]] living in the [[Gulthmere Forest]] until human expansion in the area consumed him with bitterness. Blackthorn decided to not only fight back against humanity but also conduct his personal war in one of the biggest cities of the [[Realms]]. \n\nHe went to [[Westgate]] and joined the Night Masks, using his talents as a poisoner for the guild. In time, Blackthorn learned that the guild was a very useful tool in his war and he greatly delighted in poisoning merchants involved in the timber market."
