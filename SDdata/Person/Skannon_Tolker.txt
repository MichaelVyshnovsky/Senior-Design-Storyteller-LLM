Skannon Tolker was a Red Wizard of Thay and a necromancer residing in Illefarn around 1480 DR.
Around 1480 DR, Skannon came to believe that Arvik Zaltos and his other apprentices pursued the secret of the elemental keys in order to overthrow Szass Tam, so she planned to undermine their efforts and afterward reported to Tam. However, Skannon was unveiled by the returning Arvik (in truth, the disguised rakshasa Nadir) and put in prison.
Skannon was an evil individual, preferring undead to living beings and without compassion.
Skannon was one of the four apprentices of Arvik Zaltos.
