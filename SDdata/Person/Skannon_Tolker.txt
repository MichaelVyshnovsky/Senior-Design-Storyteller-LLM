}}'''Skannon Tolker''' was a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] and a [[necromancer]] residing in [[Illefarn]] around [[1480 DR]].
==History==
Around [[1480 DR]], Skannon came to believe that [[Arvik Zaltos]] and his other apprentices pursued the secret of the elemental keys in order to overthrow [[Szass Tam]], so she planned to undermine their efforts and afterward reported to Tam. However, Skannon was unveiled by the returning Arvik (in truth, the disguised [[rakshasa]] [[Nadir]]) and put in prison.

==Personality==
Skannon was an evil individual, preferring [[undead]] to living beings and without compassion.

==Relationship==
Skannon was one of the four apprentices of Arvik Zaltos.
