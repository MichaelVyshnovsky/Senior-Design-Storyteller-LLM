'''Amra''' was the spirit of a [[moon elf]] living amongst the trees in the [[Gray Forest]] between [[Impiltur]] and [[the Vast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/The Rage||20}}

==History==
When the [[faerie dragon]] [[Jivex]] guided [[Taegan Nightwind]] to the transformed elf trees in the forest after the Impilturan forces were routed by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] on [[Tarsakh 12]] of {{yearlinkName|1373}}, Amra chose to emerge from the collective spirit and show herself as she was in life to the [[avariel]], in order to show him the glory of the city in the elves' heyday.

==Description==
In life, Amra was a head shorter than the avariel, with impish features and a palpable air of dignity. Her tresses were azure, and her slanted turquoise eyes were flecked with gold. She wore mostly blue.
