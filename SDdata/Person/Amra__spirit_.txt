Amra was the spirit of a moon elf living amongst the trees in the Gray Forest between Impiltur and the Vast in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
When the faerie dragon Jivex guided Taegan Nightwind to the transformed elf trees in the forest after the Impilturan forces were routed by the Cult of the Dragon on Tarsakh 12 of , Amra chose to emerge from the collective spirit and show herself as she was in life to the avariel, in order to show him the glory of the city in the elves heyday.
In life, Amra was a head shorter than the avariel, with impish features and a palpable air of dignity. Her tresses were azure, and her slanted turquoise eyes were flecked with gold. She wore mostly blue.
