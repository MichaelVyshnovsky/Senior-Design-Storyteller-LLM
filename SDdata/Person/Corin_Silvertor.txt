Lord '''Corin Silvertor''' was a [[human]] noble of [[Waterdeep]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
===Early Life===
Born the youngest of three sons to the noble [[Silvertor|House Silvertor]], Corin did not grow up expecting to be heir. He was a disappointment to his father, and was often whipped, leaving scars on his back that would remain as he grew up.

===Undermountain===
In the {{YearlinkName|1325}},<ref>{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} the young Corin had recently assumed the title of Lord Silvertor after his father's passing, when he was lost on a hunting trip into [[Undermountain]] below Waterdeep. The [[half-orc]] thief [[Artek Ar'talen]], called 'the Knife', was hired by Lord [[Darien Thal]] to rescue Lord Silvertor from Undermountain, and with the help of the wizard [[Beckla Shadesar]], they located the young nobleman, and the three of them battled their way through Undermountain.

==Description==
Corin was described as handsome, with golden hair and blue eyes, and a boyish face with fine, elegant features.

==Possessions==
Corin carried a slender [[rapier]].

==Abilities==
Corin was an excellent shot with a [[Shortbow|short bow]], and very fast with his rapier. He was also a capable and strategic [[Chess (game)|lanceboard]] player.

==Relationships==
Corin was grateful to Artek Ar'talen for his help, and had warm feelings for Beckla Shadesar in particular, as he invited her to join him as he returned to Waterdeep.
