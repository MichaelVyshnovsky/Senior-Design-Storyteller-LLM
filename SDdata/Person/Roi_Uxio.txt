Roi Uxio was a soldier of the Red Plumes in Yûlash in the late 15 century DR.
Roi was stationed at the Red Plumes camp in Yûlash. A silkroot addict, he often went to a secluded spot to indulge in his vice.
Roi bought the silkroot from a man named Ventria Greenglass of Hillsfars Rogues Guild.
Circa 1486 DR, during the visit of Torin Nomerthal to the city, Roi was worried he would have only one dose of silkroot left.
Roi was a coward at heart. He was scared that his superiors would discover his vice and severely punish him.
