        "mainbody": "ia was one of the hostesses of the Mermaids Arms festhall in the city of Waterdeep in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nIn 1370 DR, Tia fell victim to the increased kobold activity on the streets of Waterdeep. Driven from home by a sinister drow plot, a tribe of kobolds was forced to live in the sewers of the Dungeon Level of Undermountain and survive by raiding the surface city. During one such raid, Tia was snatched by the kobolds and was held hostage for several months until the kobolds were weakened by an agent of Khelben Arunsun investigating the crime spree. The weakened tribe was raided by the orc marauders led by Horazak, and Tia was taken to the ancient dwarven prison Horazak used as the base.\nTia knew nothing but struggle and tried to survive until she was taken by Kalmog the prisons \"warden\" who attempted to assault her. Serendipitously, the same agent of Khelbens was investigating the prison at that time and heard Tias screams and struggles. The Khelbenite slayed the abusive gray orc, setting Tia free to return to her life in Waterdeep."
