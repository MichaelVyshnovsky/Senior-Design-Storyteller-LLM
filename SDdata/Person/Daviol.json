        "mainbody": "Daviol the Frozen was an adventurer and the first owner of the pair of Aurilite magic boots â€“ the Frosts Embrace, who lived some years before the mid 14 century DR.\nDaviol, soon to be known as Daviol the Frozen, was an adventurer who was betrayed by his troupe over a sack of gold. He was left to die of exposure while trekking across the Great Glacier. As he was dying amidst the frigid wasteland, he uttered a curse with his last breath. The curse reached the year of Auril, the goddess of winter. She granted him a boon of a pair of enchanted boots that protected his bare body against the extreme cold of the glacier. Daviols new boots of the north received the name of the Frosts Embrace. Using the boon, Daviol crossed the frozen wastes in search of his treacherous companions, finding them in the safety of the closest tavern. The revenge was served and Daviols bloodlust was sated. From there, the adventurer resumed his travels across the frozen north never to be seen again."
