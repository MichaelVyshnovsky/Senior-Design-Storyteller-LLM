'''Darrom Ithal''' of [[Clan Ithal]] was the first king of [[Tethyr]] and the founder of the [[Ithal Dynasty]].

==Activities==
During the first part of King Darrom's reign, he increased the trade among the clans of Tethyr and improved its agricultural output.

==Relationships==
Darrom was the son of Chief [[Clovis Ithal II (chieftain)|Clovis Ithal II]], who was in turn the son of Chieftain [[Mong Ithal]]. He had a younger brother by the name of [[Corin Ithal|Corin]] by another mother.

Darrom fell in love with and married the daughter of the chieftain of [[Clan Tarseth]]. Her name was [[Saraala Ithal|Saraala]], and she was a [[half-elf]], the granddaughter of [[Selanlar]] of the [[Tethir (tribe)|Tethir]] tribe of [[elves]].

The two of them had two sons and a daughter. The [[Darrom Ithal II|first son]] was named after his father; the second son was named [[Silvam Ithal|Silvam]].

==History==
Darom Ithal was born in the {{YearlinkName|-237}}.

In the {{YearlinkName|-230}}, [[Calimshan]] changed its stance on newly independent Tethyr and marched on the towns of [[Ithmong]] and [[Myratma]], retaking them for Calimshan. They remained in enemy hands for nine years.

During this time, Darrom and his father, Chief Clovis, formed an alliance with Selanlar, leader of one of the tribes of [[elves]] in the [[Forest of Tethir]]. Working together for six months, Clan Ithal, six other [[Tethyrian]] tribes, and the elves formed an army to retake Ithmong from the Calishites, in what would be called the [[Second Revolt]].

During the battle known as the [[Ithmong Slaughter]], Clovis was slain during the charge against the town, being struck with numerous arrows. breaking through the enemy lies as [[Ithal Crag]]. The four brothers of [[Pasha]] [[Kalil]] were slain in the battle. In fact, the Tethyrians did not leave a single enemy survivor within two miles of the town. After the battle, Darrom mounted heads of the slain on [[spear]]s and displayed them south of the town as a warning to Calimshan in what would be called the [[Plains of Clovis]].

The other chieftains did not immediately welcome this new chief among the [[human]] clans, who was, as was already stated, barely past the age of majority. One of the other clan leader's challenged Darrom in a duel and lost the duel and his life.

[[Clan Bormul]], however, was supportive of Chief Darrom, and that powerful clan, together with the Tethir tribe helped strengthen the unity of all the clans. By the {{YearlinkName|-212}}, Darrom planned to retake Myratma by making use of the strategic advantages of the surrounding hills. In the [[Battle of the Purple Marches]], he was successful, leading the clans and their elven allies to defeat the cavalry and chariots of the Calishites. This second loss forced Calimshan to once more officially grant Tethyr its independence.

In what would become [[Founding Year (Tethyr)|Founding Year]], year 0 in the [[Calendar of Tethyreckoning]], the clans gathered to crown Darrom Ithal as their first king. He passed on leadership of Clan Ithal to his half-brother [[Corin Ithal|Corin]], but because Corin was only eight or nine years old at the time, Darrom continued to serve in dual role as Chief Regent of Clan Ithal and king of unified Tethyr.

In {{Yearlink|-211}}, King Darrom took his beloved Saraala as his queen. Being both a member of Clan Tarseth and tribe Tethir, the union helped maintain the unity of the fledgling country.

The couple had three children: first Darrom II, then Silvam in {{Yearlink|-209}}, and finally a daughter in {{Yearlink|-207}}. Sadly, little Darrom died from a fever in {{Yearlink|-206}}.

That same year, Corin came of age, and Darrom ceased his role as regent clan leader and passed on full authority of Clan Ithal to his half-brother.

In the {{YearlinkName|-200}}, Clan Bormul finished construction of a palace for the royal family, [[Ithalyr]], located on the coast in the [[Purple Hills]] region. The court was moved from Ithmong to this new location.

Darrom's reign went smoothly until an incident in the year {{Yearlink|-189}}, when Corin's elven wife died in an accident. This triggered diplomatic tensions between the humans and the elves, who demanded "justice" against the clan guard who had been guarding her when she was bit by a venomous [[snake]]. After six years, the king finally gave in to the tensions and turned over the elderly clansman to the elves, hoping to save the elven alliance, but this, in turn led to strong dissent among the other clans.

So strong was the anger over this act, that, in the month of [[Eleasis]] of the {{YearlinkName|-183}}, Darrom's brother-in-law, the now-chieftain of Clan Tarseth, [[Amir Tarseth I]], arranged for a [[deepspawn]] to be [[teleport]]ed directly into the throne room. The monster succeeded in murdering the king and fourteen of his guards.

Darrom was succeeded by his son Silvam.

When Queen [[Zaranda Star|Zaranda]] declared Ithmong to be the new seat of her power in {{Yearlink|1367}}, she renamed the city [[Darromar]], after Tethyr's first king.
