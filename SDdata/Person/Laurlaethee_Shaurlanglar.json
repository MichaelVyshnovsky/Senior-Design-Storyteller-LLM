        "mainbody": "Laurlaethee Shaurlangar was an elf of Myth Drannor who failed to kill Elminster Aumar\nShe was very frail-looking, slender as a wisp, and maybe half Elminster Aumars height, though she had perfect lips. She wore a gown during her meeting with Elminster Aumar after her meeting, she became both younger and taller by the power of Mystra, and doffed the gown on her own power.\nLaurlaethee could cast a number of spells, up to and including blood dragon.\nLaurlaethee had been the lover of Touor, and considered the Starym to be overproud fools.\nOn Kythorn 4 of , Laurlaethee Shaurglangar got into a meeting with Elminster Aumar, where she poisoned him with srindym in the moonwine she served him. When he survived, she tried to slay him with spells, slowly realizing that he really was protected by Mystra. Her last attempt at slaying him involved a blood dragon spell, but Elminster reversed the spell, preventing her death. She was then rejuvenated by Mystra."
