'''Deng Tse Chin''' was a [[shukenja]] adventurer in [[Shou Lung]].

==Possessions==
Deng was known to possess a set of [[o-yori]] that he kept in a [[rosewood]] container, a [[daikyu]] and [[quiver]], a [[spear]] with a scabbard for on his [[horse]]s,  a [[hooded lantern]], a [[book]] of poetry, and a [[map]] of [[Kozakura]]. The [[arrow]]s in his quiver included the standard variety, armor piecing, leaf head, [[screaming arrow|''screaming arrow'']]''s'', and [[fire arrow|''fire arrow'']]''s''.

His wardrobe included both cotton and silk inner and outer [[robe]]s, a hakkan (cotton trousers), a pair of [[sandal]]s and [[boot]]s, a fur [[cloak]] and hat, a obi (silk [[sash]]), a mino (rain cape), gloves, and a [[loincloth]].

He also owned, passed down him as a family heirloom, an ancient [[katana]] and [[wakizashi]] with scabbards. As well as both a thoroughbred and draft horse, for whom he owned [[barding]] and a variety of equipment for taking care of.

==History==
Growing up as an abandoned child in the [[Sheng-Ti monastery]], known as "The Sanctuary", in the city of [[Hsi-Feng]], Deng learned all about the [[Path of Enlightenment]] and the Immortal [[Fa Kuan]], patron of the monastery. He trained in [[kung fu]] of the [[Horizon]] style.

At Deng's coming of age, the abbot explained to him that a fortune in [[silver]] and [[gem]]s had been wrapped in his robes when he was found, suggesting he was of noble birth.

Deng started travelling to teach the Path's doctrines and maybe uncover the secret of his birth. After two years, in [[1358 DR]], Deng decided to attend the [[Komite]].
