        "Biography": "Glina was a wizard of [[Neverwinter Academy]], who entertained herself with gossips. Despite her father, [[Jochris]], being the headmaster of the Academy, she was [[Qara]]'s enemy. When Qara burned the stables at the Academy and went off, [[Hetha]] and Glina tracked her to [[Sunken Flagon]] inn.",
        "Gameplay": "When the Kalach-Cha and the companions persuaded the City Watchmen to work with the thieves or stay with the Watch, they would encounter Qara trading insults with Hetha and Glina. The Kalach-Cha could've resolved the matter, causing Hetha and Glina to walk away."
