'''Jay Burn-Hand''' was a [[fire genasi]] [[proxy]] of the [[fire]] god known as [[Hastsezini]], a favorite among the [[efreet]] nobility.<ref>

==Description==
Jay's body was pitch black, comparable to the color of [[coal]], and had the head of a [[hawk]]. His eyes had a white-hot glow to them.

==Activities==
At some point Jay was instructed by Hastsezini to take up residence in the [[Great Conflagration]] and observe the creatures that inhabited that [[elemental plane]], though some claimed that his reason for being there was of his own free will.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some claimed that Jay's gaze could cause any object to erupt into flames.
