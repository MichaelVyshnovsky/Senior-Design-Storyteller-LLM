        "mainbody": "Yaphyll was the Zulkir of divination in the Red Wizards of Thay who was a strong supporter of Druxus Rhym and Szass Tam. She often used her magic to keep an eye on the other Zulkirs and various Thayan enclaves throughout Faer√ªn.\nYaphyll was a slender woman, somewhat short for a Mulan, sometimes having a humorous impish expression on her face.. She looked as being in her early 30s but was known for maintaining her youth through magic. It was rumored that Yaphyll had an amulet of perpetual youth.\nLike every zulkir, Yaphyll had masked her true prowess showing off as a cute lass with a light heart and irrepressible sense of humor. Any rival should have realized though that to rise through high in the hierarchy of her order, Yaphyll possessed a ruthless heart and adamantine will as well.\nYaphyll was once an imperialist and ally of Zulkir Lauzoril. Together with the other zulkirs she tried to stand against Szass Tams aspirations to become sole ruler of Thay. In the decade between 1375 and 1385 DR, when it became apparent that the war that erupted turned into a stalemate with neither side gaining an advantage, Yaphyll switched sides and joined Szass. By then she was ready to do anything to shift the balance of power, break the stalemate, and end the war before it would destroy Thay completely. \nBut the stalemate continued and over the years Yaphyll decided to rather stand with the living than with the undead, thus switching sides again in favor of the Council of Zulkirs.. \nAs a result Szass took her prisoner in 1385 DR, binding her with powerful items of domination. He forced Yaphyll to perform the most powerful divination known to her order no matter the consequences to her own well-being, and to tell him how to arrange for a decisive victory over the other zulkirs. She performed the task and told Szass to lay a trap. She then left him with another prophecy regarding a \"white queen\" and \"black queen\". At the end of the vision Yaphyll was surrounded by a blue flame and broke free of Szass Tams power. The lich killed her with his poisonous touch trying to regain control over the diviner.\nLater it became apparant that Yaphyll saw what became known as the Spellplague. In touch with the tomorrow and affected by the spellplague, Yaphyll seized some of the blue fire, enough to break the hold of Szass Tams binding magic."
