        "History": "At some point, presumably after the fall of Netheril ({{Yearlink|-339}}), Lady Saharel became an [[archlich]]. Lady Saharel continued to watch over Spellgard as an [[archlich]] until [[1358 DR]], when she sacrificed herself in order to destroy the wizard [[Manshoon]] and defend [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]].<ref>\n\nAs of [[1479 DR]], Lady Saharel continued to exist beyond death as a kind of prophetic spirit or ghost. On rare occasions when she appeared within the ruins of Spellgard, she answered questions posed by any nearby mortals. It was said that no query was off limits. At times, in order to get Saharel to divulge information a price was required. This could take the form of repairing part of Spellgard.\n\nIt was thought that the only way to lay Lady Saharel's ghost to rest was to destroy Manshoon and all of his [[Clone|clones]].",
        "Relationships": "Lady Saharel, once a companion and lover of Elminster of Shadowdale,<ref> was known to view the [[Harpers]] with favor and the [[Zhentarim]] with hostility.<ref>"
