Andrathath was a mage.
His mask, Andrathaths Mask, was named after him.
He was known to have used all the powers of Andrathaths Mask, and to have been the only user to ever do so. He was found dead and spiritless at Dlardrageth Keep at some point.
Given the loss of his spirit, it was assumed the mask may have stored it.
