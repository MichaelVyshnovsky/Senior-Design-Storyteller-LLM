'''Besender Melairkyn''' was a possessing [[Clan Melairkyn]] [[dwarf]] [[ghost]] in [[Undermountain]] in [[1375 DR]].

==History==
Around [[1363 DR]], a [[deepspawn]], [[Xovliax]], claimed a section of the [[Melairbode]] as its lair so Besender soon possessed it. Somehow the possession became permanent and the personalities of the [[dwarf]] and of the deepspawn fused together.

So Xovliax started spawning dwarves in order to form a new dwarven community inside the dungeon, [[Murkstone]]. However, the spawned dwarves were a failure and often Xovliax sent them on suicide missions. Meanwhile, however, many dwarf outcasts and some [[duergar]] joined Murkstone.
