'''Morga Longlived''' was a [[half-orc]] [[noble]]woman from [[Waterdeep]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{Quote|She's quite nice, for a half-orc. Er, not that half-orcs aren't nice, I'm just saying, she's nice for a person... Morga is interested in learning all about the history of the [[Sword Coast]]... and she has the money to feed that interest.|Tristopher Chettlebell}}

==Activities==
She was quite wealthy, and maintained a private museum of [[artifact]]s that was jealously regarded by her peers.

==Relationships==
[[Tristopher Chettlebell]] was one of her manservants, through whom she was acquainted with heroes in [[Neverwinter]] and [[Icewind Dale]].

==History==

Morga was once an [[adventurer]] who used her amassed treasure to purchase a noble rank in Waterdeep when she retired. At some point during her career, she was killed and ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]'', thus when the [[death curse]] occurred many years into her retirement, her body began to decay. [[Priest]]s could do nothing for her, and as she began to deteriorate at an alarming rate, she traveled to the [[Cathedral of Helm]] in [[Helm's Hold]] seeking answers or (failing that) some adventurers who could sniff out the curse's cause. Having made her ability to bankroll such an adventure very public, she was approached by the [[Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]], who required funding for an expedition to [[Chult]] after having received information from an [[Makos|anonymous source]] that the cause of the death curse was located there.
