Adventurer
Morga Longlived was a half-orc noblewoman from Waterdeep during the late 15 century DR.
She was quite wealthy, and maintained a private museum of artifacts that was jealously regarded by her peers.
Tristopher Chettlebell was one of her manservants, through whom she was acquainted with heroes in Neverwinter and Icewind Dale.
Morga was once an adventurer who used her amassed treasure to purchase a noble rank in Waterdeep when she retired. At some point during her career, she was killed and resurrected, thus when the death curse occurred many years into her retirement, her body began to decay. Priests could do nothing for her, and as she began to deteriorate at an alarming rate, she traveled to the Cathedral of Helm in Helms Hold seeking answers or (failing that) some adventurers who could sniff out the curses cause. Having made her ability to bankroll such an adventure very public, she was approached by the Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge, who required funding for an expedition to Chult after having received information from an anonymous source that the cause of the death curse was located there.
