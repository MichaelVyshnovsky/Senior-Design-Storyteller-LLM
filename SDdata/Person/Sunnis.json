        "mainbody": "'''Sunnis''', called the '''Princess of Good Earth Creatures''', the '''True Stone''', and the '''Lode Mother''', was the good [[archomental]] of the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]], and thus was the opposite and nemesis of [[Ogrémoch]]. Her symbol was an hourglass with sand trickling downward.\n{{Quote|I mean very little. Ogrémoch's death means much.|Sunnis}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "Sunnis appeared as a {{SIAdj|12|ft|adj=tall}} muscular, feminine humanoid formed of rock (and consequently weighed about {{SI|4000|lb|k}}). She had intense eyes of scintillating sapphires.",
        "Personality": "Sunnis was a gentle individual who treated her servants as cherished children. Despite her kindness, she was not passive, and was no less opposed to evil than her fellow Princes of Elemental Good.",
        "Abilities": "Sunnis was the mightiest of the Princes of Elemental Good. She was fluent in both [[Terran]] and [[Celestial language|Celestial]], and could speak to and understand any creature as if under the effects of the spell ''[[tongues]]'' at all times. She possessed both [[darkvision]] and [[tremorsense]], and could [[earth glide|move through rock and soil]] like a fish through water. Though she fought with only her fists, she was a fearsome warrior.\n\nShe healed quickly from any injury, and was wholly immune to damage caused by fire and poison; nor could she be stunned, paralyzed, petrified, or put to sleep. She was highly resistant to damage caused by cold and electricity, was resistant to spells and physical damage in general, and could not be harmed by weapons without at least a moderately strong enchantment. Her mastery of earth meant that any creature attacking her on land did so at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nSunnis could mimic the effects of ''[[soften earth and stone]]'', ''[[spike stones]]'', ''[[stone shape]]'', ''[[stone tell]]'', ''[[transmute mud to rock]]'', and ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'' at will; ''[[move earth]]'', ''[[stone to flesh]]'', ''[[wall of iron]]'' (at double strength), and ''[[wall of stone]]'' (also at double strength) thrice each day; and ''[[animate objects]]'' on stone and earth only, once each day.{{Cite dragon/353/Princes of Elemental Good|43-44}}\n\nOnce each day, Sunnis could summon up to three elder earth elementals, three juvenile [[copper dragon]]s, five elder [[xorn]]s, five [[galeb duhr]]s, twelve [[pech]], eighteen [[sandling]]s, or one [[earth monolith]], to serve and aid her.",
        "Possessions": {
            "Realm": "Sunnis made her home in the Sandfall, a fortress built within a cave underneath a eternally falling column of sand, which visitors often likened to the bottom half of an [[hourglass]]. The sand drained down into what appeared to be a bottomless pit not far away from Sunnis’s fortress."
        },
        "Activities": "Sunnis spent her time battling the minions of Ogremoch and planning his eventual defeat. At other times, she left her home to travel the Plane of Earth to promote the cause of good, and in search of exotic treasures, worthy heroes, and other items of worth.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Enemies": "Sunnis was the mortal enemy of Ogrémoch, whom she truly hated. She also fought the [[dao]], opposing their habit of enslaving earth elementals, and occasionally challenged [[Crystalle]], the supposed archomental of [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Minerals|Minerals]], for similar behavior. At other times she came into conflict with [[Alu Kahn Sang]] (said to be an archomental of [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Dust|Dust]]), when he led armies on destructive raids against the earth elemmentals.\n\nShe also detested the demon lords [[Zuggtmoy]] and [[Urdlen]], on account of their minions despoiling earth, and had a long-running feud with the archdevil [[Dispater]] over some ancient disagreement.",
            "Allies": "For all her enemies, she had just as many, if not more, allies: she was allied with various members of the [[Morndinsamman]] and the [[Lords of the Golden Hills]], as well as with the giant god [[Skoraeus Stonebones]]. According to the deep gnomes of [[Blingdenstone]], she was the consort of [[Entemoch]].<ref>\n\nBecause of her inner and outer beauty, many beings sought to court her, but she remained stoic and concealed her feelings in regards to such matters.",
            "Servitors": "She was directly served by earth elementals, [[earth mephit]]s, galeb duhr, xorn, [[oread]]s, [[stone spike]]s, [[hammer archon]]s, and other creatures of elemental earth, a small number of which dwelt in Sandfall with her. On the Material plane, she was revered by [[dwarves]], [[gnome]]s (particularly [[svirfneblin]]), [[gulgar]]s, and [[earth genasi]], though she discouraged cults dedicated to her from forming. The [[stonechildren]] came the closest to truly worshiping her.\n\nSome [[druid]]s and [[stonelord]]s were known to dedicate themselves to her teachings."
        },
        "History": "Like the other Princes of Elemental Good, Sunnis was said to have been birthed by the Elemental Planes to balance out the Princes of Elemental Evil. And like her fellows, Sunnis joined the [[Wind Dukes of Aaqa]] and the side of Law during the great war between Law and Chaos in the Age Before Ages. It was during that war, at the [[Battle of Pesh]], that Sunnis first saw and battled Ogremoch. In that first battle, they fought nearly to the death, as Sunnis sought to distract Ogremoch long enough for the Wind Dukes to use the ''[[Rod of Seven Parts]]'' to defeat [[Miska]] the Wolf-Spider, and in doing so, turn the tide of the war for Law.\n\nA famous story told that Sunnis once battled the [[tarrasque]], and that while she was unable to destroy it, she used an artifact called the ''[[Sands of Slumber]]'' to force into dormancy for most of its existence.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Many rumors circulated about the True Stones. Some said she planned to lay a trap for Ogremoch and hurl him into the bottomless pit in Sandfall. Others claimed that the eternally flow of sand was a gift from a suitor from the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Dust]].\n\nStill other rumors revolved around the colossal crystal that supposedly rested in the heart of Sandfall: visitors who claimed to have seen it said it shone with blinding light and was {{SI|50|ft}} in width. Stories variously said it was the heart of a star, the finest gem ever taken from the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Minerals]], or even the source of all Earthly magical power.\n\nOf Sunnis herself, it was rumored that whenever a non-evil creature of elemental earth was hurt, she felt its pain through the earth itself. And that any person who brought her a truly unique treasure would gain a special place in her heart and be given a mysterious reward- the exact nature of which was subject to much speculation, but given her power could be quite magnificent."
