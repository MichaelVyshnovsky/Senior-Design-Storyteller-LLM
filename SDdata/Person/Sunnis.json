        "mainbody": "Sunnis, called the Princess of Good Earth Creatures, the True Stone, and the Lode Mother, was the good archomental of the Elemental Plane of Earth, and thus was the opposite and nemesis of Ogrémoch. Her symbol was an hourglass with sand trickling downward.\nSunnis appeared as a  muscular, feminine humanoid formed of rock (and consequently weighed about ). She had intense eyes of scintillating sapphires.\nSunnis was a gentle individual who treated her servants as cherished children. Despite her kindness, she was not passive, and was no less opposed to evil than her fellow Princes of Elemental Good.\nSunnis was the mightiest of the Princes of Elemental Good. She was fluent in both Terran and Celestial, and could speak to and understand any creature as if under the effects of the spell tongues at all times. She possessed both darkvision and tremorsense, and could move through rock and soil like a fish through water. Though she fought with only her fists, she was a fearsome warrior.\nShe healed quickly from any injury, and was wholly immune to damage caused by fire and poison nor could she be stunned, paralyzed, petrified, or put to sleep. She was highly resistant to damage caused by cold and electricity, was resistant to spells and physical damage in general, and could not be harmed by weapons without at least a moderately strong enchantment. Her mastery of earth meant that any creature attacking her on land did so at a distinct disadvantage.\nSunnis could mimic the effects of soften earth and stone, spike stones, stone shape, stone tell, transmute mud to rock, and transmute rock to mud at will move earth, stone to flesh, wall of iron (at double strength), and wall of stone (also at double strength) thrice each day and animate objects on stone and earth only, once each day.\nOnce each day, Sunnis could summon up to three elder earth elementals, three juvenile copper dragons, five elder xorns, five galeb duhrs, twelve pech, eighteen sandlings, or one earth monolith, to serve and aid her.\nSunnis made her home in the Sandfall, a fortress built within a cave underneath a eternally falling column of sand, which visitors often likened to the bottom half of an hourglass. The sand drained down into what appeared to be a bottomless pit not far away from Sunnis’s fortress.\nSunnis spent her time battling the minions of Ogremoch and planning his eventual defeat. At other times, she left her home to travel the Plane of Earth to promote the cause of good, and in search of exotic treasures, worthy heroes, and other items of worth.\nSunnis was the mortal enemy of Ogrémoch, whom she truly hated. She also fought the dao, opposing their habit of enslaving earth elementals, and occasionally challenged Crystalle, the supposed archomental of Minerals, for similar behavior. At other times she came into conflict with Alu Kahn Sang (said to be an archomental of Dust), when he led armies on destructive raids against the earth elemmentals.\nShe also detested the demon lords Zuggtmoy and Urdlen, on account of their minions despoiling earth, and had a long-running feud with the archdevil Dispater over some ancient disagreement.\nFor all her enemies, she had just as many, if not more, allies she was allied with various members of the Morndinsamman and the Lords of the Golden Hills, as well as with the giant god Skoraeus Stonebones. According to the deep gnomes of Blingdenstone, she was the consort of Entemoch.\nBecause of her inner and outer beauty, many beings sought to court her, but she remained stoic and concealed her feelings in regards to such matters.\nShe was directly served by earth elementals, earth mephits, galeb duhr, xorn, oreads, stone spikes, hammer archons, and other creatures of elemental earth, a small number of which dwelt in Sandfall with her. On the Material plane, she was revered by dwarves, gnomes (particularly svirfneblin), gulgars, and earth genasi, though she discouraged cults dedicated to her from forming. The stonechildren came the closest to truly worshiping her.\nSome druids and stonelords were known to dedicate themselves to her teachings.\nLike the other Princes of Elemental Good, Sunnis was said to have been birthed by the Elemental Planes to balance out the Princes of Elemental Evil. And like her fellows, Sunnis joined the Wind Dukes of Aaqa and the side of Law during the great war between Law and Chaos in the Age Before Ages. It was during that war, at the Battle of Pesh, that Sunnis first saw and battled Ogremoch. In that first battle, they fought nearly to the death, as Sunnis sought to distract Ogremoch long enough for the Wind Dukes to use the Rod of Seven Parts to defeat Miska the Wolf-Spider, and in doing so, turn the tide of the war for Law.\nA famous story told that Sunnis once battled the tarrasque, and that while she was unable to destroy it, she used an artifact called the Sands of Slumber to force into dormancy for most of its existence.\nMany rumors circulated about the True Stones. Some said she planned to lay a trap for Ogremoch and hurl him into the bottomless pit in Sandfall. Others claimed that the eternally flow of sand was a gift from a suitor from the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Dust.\nStill other rumors revolved around the colossal crystal that supposedly rested in the heart of Sandfall visitors who claimed to have seen it said it shone with blinding light and was  in width. Stories variously said it was the heart of a star, the finest gem ever taken from the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Minerals, or even the source of all Earthly magical power.\nOf Sunnis herself, it was rumored that whenever a non-evil creature of elemental earth was hurt, she felt its pain through the earth itself. And that any person who brought her a truly unique treasure would gain a special place in her heart and be given a mysterious reward- the exact nature of which was subject to much speculation, but given her power could be quite magnificent."
