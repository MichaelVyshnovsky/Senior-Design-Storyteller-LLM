        "mainbody": "alenburh Fengrath was a mercenary of the Fengrath family and the ruling Gauntlet of the village of Shining Falls in the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 13 century DR.\nOriginally a family of mercenaries, the Fengraths were hired to escort caravans between Loudwater and  the elven colony of Thelthindul. However, the last caravan, some time before 1272 DR, returned and discovered all of the citizens had vanished. The few remaining elves in the caravan refused to ever come near the place, so Walenburh and the fearless Fengraths moved into the Granite Tower and declared themselves rulers of the town, later called Shining Falls. No one contested their claim.\nGauntlet Walenburh Fengrath invited strongheart halflings to settle in the village in the 1280s DR. They came and they flourished.\nWalenburh was the great grandmother of Deogol Fengrath, the Gauntlet of Shining Falls circa 1372 DR."
