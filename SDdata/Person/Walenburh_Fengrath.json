        "mainbody": "'''Walenburh Fengrath''' was a mercenary of the [[Fengrath]] family and the ruling [[Gauntlet (title)|Gauntlet]] of the village of [[Shining Falls (village)|Shining Falls]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Originally a family of mercenaries, the Fengraths were hired to escort caravans between [[Loudwater]] and  the elven colony of Thelthin'dul. However, the last caravan, some time before [[1272 DR]], returned and discovered all of the citizens had vanished. The few remaining [[elves]] in the caravan refused to ever come near the place, so Walenburh and the fearless Fengraths moved into the [[Granite Tower (Shining Falls)|Granite Tower]] and declared themselves rulers of the town, later called Shining Falls. No one contested their claim.\n\nGauntlet Walenburh Fengrath invited [[strongheart halfling]]s to settle in the village in the 1280s DR. They came and they flourished.",
        "Relations": "Walenburh was the great grandmother of [[Deogol Fengrath]], the Gauntlet of Shining Falls ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]."
