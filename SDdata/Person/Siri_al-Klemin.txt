Siri al-Klemin was a dao inhabitant of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Siris real name was Khorasan, though he would never share that information with mortals.
Compared to his vocal companion, Siri was quiet and sullen, usually only speaking when addressed by another.
Siri was one of two dao who operated the ferry that ushered people across the mighty Al-Sarif River that bisected Huzuz.
Siri often exchanged gossip with ferry travelers. Kenai and Siri were known to make deals with the travelers as well, but evil intentions were usually hidden behind their charismatic smiles.
Siri was forced into penance by the Great Khan of the Dao for committing an unknown crime. He missed his homeland greatly and could be bribed to talk about it if paid enough.
