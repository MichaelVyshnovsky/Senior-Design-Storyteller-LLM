Kithrak Therezzyn was a githyanki that served her people as commander of Crèche Yllek, on the planet of Toril during the 15 century of the Faerûnian calendar.
Therezzyn had auburn hair and distinct facial markings that were not uncommon among the githyanki. She had a long scar running across her right eye, which was clouded over.
She dressed in typical githyanki half-plate armor, adorned with a flowing red cape. She wore a slender diadem across her brow and had several rings that pierced her long, pointed ears.
As befitting a member of githyanki military hierarchy, Therezzyn was demanding of her subordinates and appropriately deferent to her superiors.
She wielded a soulbreaker greatsword, a potent gith weapon that whispered into the mind of its wielder with the voices of the dead it had slain.
She also held in her possession a githyanki shard, a device that opened certain protective shields within the crèche.
After Rosymorn Monastery had been taken over by by the gith forces led by Mlar Rihal, Kithrak Therezzyn took over as commander of operations the newly-founded Crèche Yllek.
She had two pet wolves, which she named Uruth and Dhak.
In the , the function of Crèche Yllek was repurposed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in Faerûn shifted in balance. Chrai Wwargaz arrived at the crèche, leading the inquisition in pursuit of the Astral Prism, a device that imprisoned Orpheus, the long-lost son of Gith. Therezzyn directed her forces at Yllek to find the prism at once, in service to their queen Vlaakith CLVII.
