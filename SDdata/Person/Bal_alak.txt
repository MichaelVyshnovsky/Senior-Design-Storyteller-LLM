'''Bal'alak''', or '''Balalak the Ferocious''', was a massive [[dire boar]] that terrorized the inhabitants of [[Samargol]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Bal'alak was truly a massive fierce creature of foul temper that almost dared hunters to test their mettle. The boar's arched back was as tall if not taller than an adult [[human]]. Bal'alak's head and back were protected by natural spiny armor. Its face was adorned with great gleaming tusks and demon eyes that exuded malice.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Bal'alak became a major danger to the simple folk of [[Samarach]]. The local hunters failed numerous times to bring the beast down, and even a hefty bounty on Bal'alak could not stop the giant boar. A [[tiefling]] merchant, [[Vadin'ya]] of Samargol, offered an especially generous reward for Bal'alak's tusks, which, according to her, held great magical power.

Sister huntresses from [[Tashluta]], [[Inshula sar Mashewe]] and [[Kwesi sar Mashewe]], attempted to hunt down the giant boar but barely escaped with their lives as Kwesi was injured by the beast.
