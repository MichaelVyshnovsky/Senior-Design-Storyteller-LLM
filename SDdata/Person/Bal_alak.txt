Balalak, or Balalak the Ferocious, was a massive dire boar that terrorized the inhabitants of Samargol in the late 14 century DR.
Balalak was truly a massive fierce creature of foul temper that almost dared hunters to test their mettle. The boars arched back was as tall if not taller than an adult human. Balalaks head and back were protected by natural spiny armor. Its face was adorned with great gleaming tusks and demon eyes that exuded malice.
By the , Balalak became a major danger to the simple folk of Samarach. The local hunters failed numerous times to bring the beast down, and even a hefty bounty on Balalak could not stop the giant boar. A tiefling merchant, Vadinya of Samargol, offered an especially generous reward for Balalaks tusks, which, according to her, held great magical power.
Sister huntresses from Tashluta, Inshula sar Mashewe and Kwesi sar Mashewe, attempted to hunt down the giant boar but barely escaped with their lives as Kwesi was injured by the beast.
