'''Urbone''' was a [[troglodyte]] chieftain in [[Cormanthor]].

==Activities==
Urbone was the leader of a troglodyte tribe that venerated [[Dretchroyaster]].

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], Urbone was ready to destroy the heretical [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell led by [[Silakul]] when some adventurers infiltrated the lair of Dretchroyaster and they defeated Urbone.

==Personality==
Urbone and his tribe truly worshiped Dretchroyaster like a true god. Thus he greatly disliked Silakul and his fellows, who saw the dracolich only as an instrument of power. He ruled with cunning and patience.
