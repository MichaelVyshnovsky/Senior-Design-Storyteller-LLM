        "mainbody": "'''Rorry''' was a farmer from [[Liam's Hold]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "Farmer Rorry was a black-haired [[gnome]] who was not used to big cities and often looked at city-folk and adventurers with admiration.",
        "History": "In 1372 DR, farmer Rorry traveled to Daggerford along with his fellows [[Gaslo]] and [[Hevesar Dimpet]] to seek help with the mysterious disappearances of the cattle from [[Wild Pastures]]. The farmers oF Liam's Hold were unable o find helm among the militia, nor the temple of [[Lathander]]. Eventually, they  came across a group of adventurers who offered their help. Rorry, alongside his fellow farmers left Daggerford for Liam's Hold as soon as the temporary city lockdown was lifted and the gates were open."
