        "mainbody": "'''Degasus Tarensun''' was a minor [[assassin]] of the [[Night Masks]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Degasus was born in the [[Caravan Cities]] but grew up in [[Westgate]] after being abandoned at the city's docks at the age of six. He was adopted by a Night Masks cell that used him as a runner and lookout while teaching him all they knew about living on the streets.\n\nLater, Degasus's natural charisma impressed the wizard [[Tersonm]], who taught him to read, write, and to recognize spells. Degasus made a series of very difficult assassinations and became a rising star assassin among Westgate's nobles."
