'''Grimboot''' was a [[duergar]] thug who lived in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He worked as a debt-collected for the local thieves' guild in [[Brampton]] and was a patron of the [[Low Lantern]] tavern.

Grimboot was known for being rather gruff and had the distinctive physical trait of being cross-eyed.
