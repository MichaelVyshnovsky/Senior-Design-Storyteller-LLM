        "mainbody": "aeryk Andolhyn was a noble in Suzail during the late 15 century DR.\nHe was sharp-featured, with a forked beard that was waxed to stay that way.\nHe owned a coach.\nOn the original day of the Council of the Dragon, after sending poison smoke into Castle Obarskyr to force a delay, the vampire archmage Manshoon enslaved the mind of Naeryk Andolphyn while the latter was at a tavern. On the day after, Naeryk Andolphyn had Lord Danthalus Blacksilver ride to court in his coach the two made small talk about the things they saw from the coach, such as a noble arrived with very much an army of his own, a coach pulled by what appeared to be lions, how mad the War Wizards would be about that, and cheeses and wines from far away, such as Sembian soft sharpsnip."
