        "Abilities": "Nyzeil Nighthammer was a tough and bullheaded [[fighter]], trained in the use of [[hammer]]s in battle.",
        "Equipment": "The [[duergar]] was armed with a [[warhammer]] and a [[shield]].",
        "History": "Nyzeil Nighthammer and Oagla'ta came together sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1310}}. Both women were bigger, stronger, and much more kind-hearted than most males of their races, Nyzeil, among duergar, and Oagla'ta, among [[half-orc]]s. The couple traveled to the city of [[Silverymoon]], where they became targets of harassment and bigotry from the town watch. [[S'feria Ranul]], a kindly [[drow]] [[Silverstar]] of [[Selûne]], witnessed the treatment and got involved, sheltering the couple from prejudice. Grateful and realizing they shared faith and values, Nyzeil and Oagla'ta joined S'feria Ranul's adventure troupe  - the [[Sisters of the Blood Moon]].\n\nNyzeil and her partner were the group's muscles, being more formidable than most males in battle. One fateful night, the trip encountered a [[goblin]] ambush in a forest outside Silverymoon. Serendipitously, three adventuring heroes came along the site of the battle and rushed to their aid. The heroes were a [[rock gnome]] [[rogue]] [[Kylei Shadowhand]], her twin sister [[wizard]] [[Hylei Shadowhand|Hylei]], and a [[ranger]] [[Half-elf]] [[Nevae Quar]]. The group dispatched bandits with ease, battling in synch, S'feria became enamored with the new allies' battle prowess and convinced them to join her adventuring band.\n\nIn 1310 DR, S'feria Ranul received a letter – a plea for help from the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. Despite the promise of [[gold]] and fame, S'feria led her Sisters to the northern city, answering its pleas for help."
