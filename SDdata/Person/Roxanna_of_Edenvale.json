            "Bryan the Bold": "[[File:Matchmaker Mayhem Bryan 2.jpg|thumb|right|Bryan giving Roxanna a second chance.]]\n:As his army made camp outside [[Herne's Wood]], Bryan issued his challenge to Roxanna, declaring that he would invade the kingdom the next day. Roxanna therefore met him in bloodforge battle. Bryan was victorious, so Roxanna angrily and begrudgingly accepted to have him as a suitor.\n\n:However, Bryan offered Roxanna a second chance, with a second bloodforge battle to be fought in the [[Web Mountains]]. For a prize, he would hide an expensive dowry in the mountains if she in turn offered the keys to the palace. The first to get the other's prize could do as they wished without further malice. Bryan was successful, seizing Roxanna's keys.\n\n[[File:Matchmaker Mayhem Bryan 3.jpg|thumb|right|Roxanna meeting secretly with Bryan at Edenvale Castle.]]\n:Despite this, Bryan the Bold now turned shy, declining to enter Edenvale Castle and worrying his lack of noble lineage would bring dishonor on Roxanna if she wed him, a mere vassal. This time, it was Roxanna who made him a proposal: her father was now plotting to marry her off anyway, but she preferred Bryan to any other, and so invited him to take Edenvale Castle and seize her father's crown.\n\n:Finally, Bryan wooed Roxanna, they fell in love and were wed, ruling jointly over Edenvale, much to her father's chagrin. They had many children (at least three) as potential heirs, which worried neighboring kingdoms.",
            "Roxanna of Edenvale": ":Bryan issued an ultimatum to Roxanna, threatening to invade Edenvale unless she married him. Instead, Roxanna defended her realm in a bloodforge battle outside Edenvale Castle, and was victorious.\n\n:Fearing her presence would draw further assaults on the realm, Roxanna quit Edenvale Castle with a handful of her [[basal golem|followers]]. They ventured deep into the Web Mountains to avoid the suitors. However, [[Connor the Clever]] tracked Roxanna down and insisted she honor her challenge and face him in a bloodforge battle, which she won.\n\n:Afterward, Roxanna relocated to a remote forest camp in Herne's Wood, where she intended to remain until her coronation day, without being pestered by suitors. However, she would get no reprieve. The last few hopefuls had banded together and pursued her. From a camp in nearby ruins, they attacked simultaneously so one of their number could win the challenge and the bride. However, Roxanna successfully fended them all off.\n\n[[File:Matchmaker Mayhem Roxanna 4.jpg|thumb|right|Roxanna retires from rule and rides off down the road.]]\n:Maintaining her independence and defeating all comers, Roxanna succeeded her father and happily ruled alone as queen. When she got tired of royal service, she abdicated in favor of an adventuring career."
