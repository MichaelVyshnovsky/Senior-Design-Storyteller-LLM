        "mainbody": "rorm was a War Wizard of the late 14 century DR.\nPer Pheldemar, Brorm cooked Vangerdahasts favourite spinach pie. He also took magic activity to be likely his fault, strongly implying that Brorm was known to his fellows to be a War Wizard.\nWhen the merchants Malakar Surth and Aumun Tholant Bezrar were mind-controlled by Harnrim Starangh to do as much damage as possible in the vicinity of the sanctum near Mouth o Gargoyles where the retired Royal Magician Vangerdahast was doing research on a secret task, the War Wizard Pheldemar initially mistook their use of explosives to be the reckless castings of Brorm."
