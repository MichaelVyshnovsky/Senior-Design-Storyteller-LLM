'''Wilfred Brewbanks''' was a traveler along the [[High Road]] between [[Neverwinter]] and [[Luskan]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Description==
Wilfred was bald, but had a full, light brown beard.

==History==
Some time around {{Yearlink|1490}}, Wilfred and his brother [[Richard Brewbanks|Richard]] joined the merchant's caravan of [[Tollin]] and his crew going from Neverwinter to Luskan, accompanied by members of the [[Order of the Burning Dawn]]. However, Richard, who was carrying a very valuable ancient [[elf|elven]] antique, went missing during the journey, and members of the caravan's group were attacked by mercenaries, an assault that was set up by the treacherous [[Martumal]].
