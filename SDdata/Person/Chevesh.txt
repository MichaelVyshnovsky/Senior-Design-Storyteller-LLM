'''Chevesh''' was a powerful [[human]] [[wizard]] who liveed in a marble tower in [[Airspur]].  He was widely regarded by the citizens of Airspur to be crazy and most people avoided his tower.  Chevesh was suspected of summoning demons and was investigated by [[Demascus]].  However, the investigation cleared him of demonic associations.  Chevesh would have liked nothing more than to be a firesoul [[genasi]] and was researching methods to turn humans into firesouls.  His tower was guarded by an [[azer]].
