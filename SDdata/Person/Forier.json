The lord sponsored treasure-hunting adventuring parties sent into the Orsraun Mountains. In the , the Company of the Sabred Tooth, guided by ranger Forier, stumbled across the horde of the blue dragon Anaglathos. The cunning wyrm saw it as an opportunity and killed the rangers wolf companion Emerald, taking its place. Along with Forier and the adventurers, Anaglathos marched across Turmish and presented the stolen dragon hoard to Sjorn. This audience ended abruptly as the blue dragon revealed himself and slaughtered Lord Sendreth, and presumably, Forier, taking over the mantle of the Lord of Turmish."
