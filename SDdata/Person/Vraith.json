        "mainbody": "'''Vraith''' was a [[wood elf]] female and a commander in the [[Order of Blue Flame]] located in the city of [[Ormpetarr]]. She held the rank of [[Accordant]]. She possessed a [[spellscar]]. Vraith was inspired through visions sent by the [[Sharn]] to attempt to enlarge the [[Plaguewrought Land]] around Ormpetarr through the [[Ritual of the Border]]. She was convinced that she would be able to join with the Sharn if she pleased them by unleashing the [[spellplague]].",
        "History": "She was born in [[1345 DR]] in the [[Chondalwood]]. In [[1385 DR]], the [[Spellplague]] appeared in her dormitory room at the wizard academy and touched her, forming the spellscar on her chest.\n\nVraith devised a ritual to extend the border of the Plaguewrought Land. She convinced [[Gregor|Brother Gregor]] that she intended to find a way to capture rogue areas of spellplague that remained in [[Faer√ªn]] and enlisted Gregor to create a potion that partially blocked the effects of the spellplague, which would allow [[pilgrim]] volunteers to survive long enough to complete the ritual.\n\nWhen Vraith learned that [[Duvan]] was immune to the spellplague, she ordered him captured and experimented on. Duvan later escaped with the help of [[Slanya]]. During the [[Festival of Blue Fire]] in [[1479 DR]], Vraith recruited hundreds of pilgrims for the Ritual of the Border. Duvan returned with [[Tyrangal]] and Slanya and disrupted the ritual, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of pilgrims and caused Vraith's soul to merge with the [[magic]]al border of the Plaguewrought Land. In [[1479 DR]], she wove her spirit into the Plaguewrought Land and was trapped and lost forever in a fate worse than death.",
        "Abilities": "Vraith's spellscar enabled her to merge the souls of the volunteers while performing the Ritual of the Border.",
        "Appearance": "She was slim and delicate. She had pale gray eyes and blonde hair."
