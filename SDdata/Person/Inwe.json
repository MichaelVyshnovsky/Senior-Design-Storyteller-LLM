After he left, the druid [[Kagha]] took over leadership of the Emerald Grove and tasked Inwe and the other druids with performing the ''[[Rite of Thorns]]''. This ritual would disguise the location of the grove from outsiders and prevent anyone else like [[Elturel|Elturian]] [[tiefling]] refugees from threatening its wellbeing. Inwe felt pride at being among the druids chosen to before the rite."
