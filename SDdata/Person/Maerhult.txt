Maerhult was a male bard.
In Nightal of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, he visited The Drunken Dragon tavern in the city of Tsurlagol in the Vast. There he met the adventurer Shaless, who was displaying a selection of curious harps and beautiful, magical blades that shed apparently looted from devils in Myth Drannor. Maerhult examined two of her harps and pronounced them to be genuine works of old Myth Drannor, and to be rare magical items.
