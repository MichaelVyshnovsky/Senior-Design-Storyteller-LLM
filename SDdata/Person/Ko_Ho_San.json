        "History": "Ko Ho San was a member of the mercantile [[Ko clan]] and a powerful wu jen. He was said to have once buried an entire town in a mudslide for an offense by the mayor's son to a Ko grandniece.\n\nIn 1358 DR, after one of his brothers, [[Ko Lei Kho]], governor of [[Akari]] island, told him about the menace of the [[Opawang]] defeated the year before, he started to investigate the [[Black Leopard Cult]], together with his grandson [[Ko La Ko]]. Thanks to a suggestion from La Ko, Ho San found a link to [[H'sin-to]], at the mouth of the [[Fenghsintzu River]] in [[T'u Lung]]. So he hired some adventurers to accompany Ko La Ko to there in order to investigate.",
        "Personality": "Ko Ho San was kindly and polite to a fault, unless people crossed his path."
