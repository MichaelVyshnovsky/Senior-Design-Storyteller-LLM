'''Eku''' ({{Pronounce|EE|koo|refs=}}) was a [[couatl]] working as a guide out of [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Disguised as a [[human]], she took the form of a middle-aged [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] woman, {{SI|5.5|ft|long=yes}} tall and {{SI|110|lb|k|long=yes}}, and wearing light-blue [[robe]]s. She had a walking stick carved to resemble a stylized couatl.

==Activities==

}}
Eku was a skillful jungle guide. She made regular trips to [[Nangalore]] to retrieve rare flowers, and could also lead the way to [[Orolunga]], where she knew that a powerful [[Saja N'baza|oracle]] dwelt. 

She was among the few people in all of Chult who knew the location of the lost city of [[Omu]], although she was cautious about revealing this fact. She was well-versed in the city's ancient history as well as the [[Legend of the Nine Gods]]. 

==Personality==
Eku would only work with travelers of good nature, and in fact sought out clients who were willing to help her battle the forces of [[evil]]. She believed that there was strength in unity, and warned all visitors to Chult to be wary of imposter guides promising to lead them to [[gold]].

==Relationships==
Eku had good relations with the [[aarakocra]] of [[Kir Sabal]]. She bore much love and respect for the folk of [[Mbala]] before they were tricked and devoured by the [[green hag]] [[Nanny Pu'pu]], whom she counted as among the worst evils in Chult and encouraged heroes to rid the jungle of her evil.

Operating as a jungle guide out of Port Nyanzaru meant that she worked for the [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant prince]] [[Jobal]], and had to pay him a portion of any earnings. While she charged the same rate as his other guides&mdash;5 [[gold piece]]s per day with a one-month advance&mdash;she had little need for money, and so donated to charity whatever she did not pay to Jobal.

==History==
When the [[death curse]] struck [[Toril]],{{ToA-time}} Eku sought out heroes to put a stop to it. She cooperated with the merchant prince [[Jessamine]], who required a number of dangerous favors from Eku's group&mdash;such as slaying the [[Great Ape]]&mdash;before her [[diviner]]s concluded that the source of the curse lay in Omu.

}}
As the location of Omu came to be known to [[adventurer]]s, Eku traveled there to scout the ruins and find a safe place for a camp. She sought to aid any who would drive the evil of [[Acererak]] out of the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]]. To that end, she began communing with the entombed [[Nine Trickster Gods|Trickster Gods]], and worked to gain their trust and to grow their strength in hopes of discovering what secrets they knew. From them, she learned of the existence and nature of the ''[[Soulmonger]]'', and ultimately of the [[atropal]] which it fed. Her activities soon attracted the attention of the [[yuan-ti]] within the [[Fane of the Night Serpent]], and brought her into conflict with [[Fenthaza]].
