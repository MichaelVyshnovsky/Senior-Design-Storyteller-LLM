Ruula Splitfang was an oscray warrior from the Malatran Plateau, active in the late 14 century DR.
Ruula was a massive unattractive hulking woman. She was not bright but for what she lacked in intelligence she made up in sheer strength. Ruula Splitfang carried a huge collection of spears.
In the late 14 century DR, the Tribe of the Wise Ones became aware of a looming threat of the evil spider katanga. The Mother of a Thousand Young was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles with ravenous spider creatures. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Ruula Splitfang was assigned to a group of more experienced heroes of the Living Jungle. Ruulas band was heading into the spider katanga caverns, past the living quarters, and straight into the most dangerous part of the lair â€“ the nest to face the Mother.
It was unknown if Ruula survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the Village of the Wise Ones for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and natures healing.
