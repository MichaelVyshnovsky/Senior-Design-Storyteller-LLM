'''Roland the Minstrel''' was a [[minstrel]] in the [[Oasis of the White Palm]] the time of [[Khalitharius]]' release in {{yearlink|1356}}.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|66}}

==Possessions==
Roland's only possession of note was a [[lute]].

==Activities==
Roland sometimes wandered the oasis,{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|67}} but from dawn to dusk he was just plucking notes out of his lute in the common room of the [[Sandvoyagers' Guild]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|71}} Though he was secretive and didn't answer many questions, he preferred to give the impression he knew a great deal.

What he knew was limited to a few facts. First amongst them was that [[Martek]] had originally created the ruins under the Oasis as well as those at [[Phoenix]], long before they were dedicated to [[Set]]; he still chose to hide his Star Gems in them. He also knew that Martek, the greatest mage of his time, had foreseen the future and left a gift to the Sultanate of the tribes, giving them the knowledge of where the Great Good slept, to be loosed when the Great Evil (almost certainly [[Khalitharius]]) came. He also knew that the ancient city of Phoenix was located west by northwest of the Oasis. He knew that Martek had delivered unto the Pharaohs of his day the five gems known as the Star Gems of Mo-Pelar, Shah-Pelar, Khan-Pelar, Aga-Pelar, and Melos-Pelar, items of great mystery, but his greatest creation was actually his own citadel.

Finally, he knew a bit of Martek's Epic.
{{quote|When the evil walks our land again,
will nomadic princes come to set
his power into the first bride's hand,
that good and evil are then met.

Then will needs be,
Five Star Gems see,
To my tomb be borne hither,
and hope shall not wither.
Open the gates to my sphere of power,
and put off evil in its appointed hour.|Martek's Epic}}
