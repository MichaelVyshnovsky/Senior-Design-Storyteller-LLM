        "mainbody": "amanda was a Talontar blightlord vampire operating in the Rawlinswood as of . She was the right hand of the Talontyr, whom she served directly.\nShe was a thin woman in form-fitting black armor, so tightly articulated that it might as well be a second skin. Her nails were midnight black, matching her lacquered armor.\nBeing a vampire, she was capable of extracting energy or vitality with her attacks, and of using a gaze that crushed the volition of the living. Furthermore, she could summon to herself an aura of biting, stinging vermin. Her vampiric strength granted her the ability to tear down walls in a pinch. She had some meager capability to cast arcane spells, allowing her to trigger some magical items.\nIn , she was assigned to escort Fallon and Araluen to The Close, after Anammelech perished. Fallon missed the hour of their meeting, so she sought him out in Under-Tharos.\nAfter taking refuge in an old hermitage for the day, the team led by Marrec caught up with them. After her insect armor was slain by the priests petrifying gaze and Fallon betrayed them, slaying Lex, she fled together with Bonehammer by using a scroll that Lex had created ahead of time. Even in this refuge, she was soon cornered by the adventurers, and after they destroyed Bonehammer, she fled to The Close, together with the Rotting Man.\nShe aided him in the fight against Marrecs party by activating a lingering control over Ususi Manaallin, which persisted until Elowen slew the vampire with one of the powers of the sword Dymondheart.\nShe had four vampire underlings of her own, named Absalme, Bonehammer, Ezekial and Lex."
