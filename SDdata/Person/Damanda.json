        "Description": "She was a thin woman in form-fitting black armor, so tightly articulated that it might as well be a second skin. Her nails were midnight black, matching her lacquered armor.",
        "Abilities": "Being a vampire, she was capable of extracting energy or vitality with her attacks, and of using a gaze that crushed the volition of the living. Furthermore, she could summon to herself an aura of biting, stinging vermin. Her vampiric strength granted her the ability to tear down walls in a pinch. She had some meager capability to cast arcane spells, allowing her to trigger some magical items.",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|1373}}, she was assigned to escort [[Fallon]] and [[Araluen]] to [[The Close]], after [[Anammelech]] perished.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|165-171|17}} Fallon missed the hour of their meeting, so she sought him out in [[Under-Tharos]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|244-246|26}}\n\nAfter taking refuge in an old hermitage for the day, the team led by [[Marrec]] caught up with them. After her insect armor was slain by the priest's petrifying gaze and Fallon betrayed them, slaying [[Lex]],{{cite book/Lady of Poison|254-258|27}} she fled together with [[Bonehammer]] by using a scroll that Lex had created ahead of time.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|260-262|28}} Even in this refuge, she was soon cornered by the adventurers, and after they destroyed Bonehammer, she fled to The Close, together with the Rotting Man.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|265-270|28}}\n\nShe aided him in the fight against Marrec's party by activating a lingering control over [[Ususi Manaallin]], which persisted until [[Elowen]] slew the vampire with one of the powers of the sword ''[[Dymondheart]]''.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|284-286|30}}",
        "Relationships": "She had four vampire underlings of her own, named Absalme, Bonehammer, [[Ezekial]] and Lex.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|215-217|22}}"
