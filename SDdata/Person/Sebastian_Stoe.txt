'''Sebastian Stoe''' was a boy in [[Mulmaster]] in [[1491 DR]].

==Relationships==
Sebastian was the son of [[Blazen Stoe]]. He was interested in [[Ilva]].

==History==
In 1491 DR, Sebastian fell in love with Ilva, a girl who worked in a bar. She introduced him to meetings held by a strange [[dwarf]] prophet. Believing Ilva to be totally inappropriate for a Blade's son, Blazen confronted Sebastian, urging him to break off the relationship but instead he ran away from home. An adventuring party hired by Count Stoe eventually saved him from a strange flame at the meeting room.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|17}}
