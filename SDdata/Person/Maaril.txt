'''Maaril''' ({{pronounce|MAYR|ill|refs=

==Description==
Maaril was handsome with dark eyes and liked to wear dark green or purple robes. He had a pointy black beard.

==Relationships==
Maaril was on good terms with [[Meleghost Starseer]] of the [[House of Wonder]].

Maaril bargained with the Riddling Dragon, [[Grimnoshtadrano]] for the services of his juvenile offspring, [[Khavalanoth]] until he matured into a [[dragon aging|young dragon]]. He did so by allowing Grimnosh to enter Waterdeep and take revenge on [[Iriador Wintermist]].

Maaril also had a black cat [[familiar]] by the name of [[Frethian]].

==Activities==
Maaril was known for throwing parties for adventurers returning to Waterdeep, where he would quiz them about monsters slain and items recovered. He would sometimes use this information to send his gargoyle and golem minions from his tower to attack and steal any magic items he coveted. 

==History==
Maaril was fostered at the House of Wonder when it was a temple of [[Mystra]]. Once he became powerful enough, he summoned a [[demon]] to kill his mentor, [[Lhoril Delhiirnyn]], and framed a rival apprentice for the murder. He stole the Dragonstaff from his master and took over the Dragon Tower.

Maaril once had a staring match with the mage [[Tessalar Hulicorm]] in the Great Library of the [[House of the Moon]] temple to [[Sel√ªne]]. It lasted through the afternoon and evening and only ended at moonrise. The curators still talked of it by [[1370 DR]], and feared what devastation their magic might have wrought.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, he was among the many powerful mages [[Khelben Arunsun]] brought together to cleanse part of the [[High Moor]] and restore [[Faer'tel'miir]], a lost city of [[Miyeritar]].<ref>

He lived in Waterdeep as an eccentric mage until he disappeared after the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]].

Just before disappearing, Maaril entrusted the custody of the ''Dragonstaff'' to the [[gold dragon]] [[Aurinax]].
