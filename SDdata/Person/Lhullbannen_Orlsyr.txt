'''Lhullbannen Orlsyr''' was a [[human]] [[fighter]] and the owner and innkeeper of [[The Wizard's Hand]] in the village of [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Everwinking Eye: At Home in Maskyr's Eye|21}}

==Relations==
Lhullbannen was the son of [[Riothar Orlsyr]], the builder of The Wizard's Hand.

He had a very large wife and four daughters described as beautiful tomboys.

==Activities==
Aged 53 ''circa'' [[1357 DR]], Lhullbannen had retired from the life of a fighter, but was too busy with the running of the inn to train any would-be warriors, short of a significant payment and being well-disposed to the student. Of course, he was also very particular about the running of the inn and was unwilling to leave the day-to-day business of the inn to his wife and daughters, expecting they wouldn't run it to the same high standards.
