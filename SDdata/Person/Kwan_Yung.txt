'''Kwan Yung''' was a [[Shou]] [[monk]] from the [[Standing Tree Monastery]] and the father of [[Kwan Shang-Li]]. He was considered to be a great scholar.	

==Description==
Kwan Yung was short, standing only as high as his son's shoulder.

==History==
As a young man, he traveled all over [[Faer√ªn]]. He fell in love with an [[elf|elven]] [[ranger]] and married her against his family's wishes. After his wife was killed by pirates, Kwan Yung traveled around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] on various missions for his monastery.

In [[1479 DR]], he helped his son to recover two rare and dangerous tomes from [[Caelynna]].
