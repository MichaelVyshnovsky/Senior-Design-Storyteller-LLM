'''Shestandeliath Narhanna''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Tymanther]] and a scion of [[Clan Shestandeliath]] in the late 15th century [[DR]]. She was a direct descendant of [[Haizverad]]. 

==History==
While investigating the murder of [[Verthisathurgiesh Baruz]] and [[Shestandeliath Parvida]], [[Mehen]] interrogated Narhanna, who took the place of her father, [[Shestandeliath Geshthax]], in the investigation. However, Narhanna didn't want to help Mehen and didn't answer his questions, teasing him instead about his exile from [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]].

Narhanna was Clan Shestandeliath's candidate for the elections to choose the new [[Vanquisher]], which were expected to be celebrated in [[1487 DR]].

On [[Hammer 9]] of 1487 DR, Geshthax sacrificed himself in order to activate the [[Breath of Petron]] so he could raise an earth barrier to surround [[Djerad Thymar]] and protect the city against [[Gilgeam]]'s forces. Although Geshthax didn't die by using the artifact, he was left impaired and Narhanna succeeded him as the new matriarch of Clan Shestandeliath.
