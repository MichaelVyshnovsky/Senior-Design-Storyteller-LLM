Coralynn Winsail was an inhabitant of Yûlash in the late 15.
Coralynn cared for her four mastiffs at the Red Plumes camp in Yûlash.
Circa 1486 DR, Coralynn disliked all the trouble caused by the visit of Torin Nomerthal to the city.
Coralynn was chosen to be in the Hillsfar contingent during the allied assault to Maerimydra. She was sent as messenger to advise about the apparition of the Mother.
Coralynn was interested only in her mastiffs. She attacked anyone who tried to harm them.
