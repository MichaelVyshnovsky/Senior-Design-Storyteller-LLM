'''Laviar Illistine''' was a member of the famed [[Illistine]] family and the King of [[Chondath]] in the mid-to-late 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].

==History==
King Laviar Illistine was holding the throne of Chondath in the {{YearlinkName|267}}, when the logging cities of [[Timindar]] and [[Orbech]] were wiped off the face of Toril during the [[Battle of Fallen Trees]]. Elves of [[Chondalwood]] attacked the logging camps after Chondath ignored their warnings about intrusion into their homelands. Outraged, Laviar sent his troops, 10,000 Chondathan mercenaries, into Chondalwood. The King allowed the mercenaries to loot and take anything they could claim during the war, free of taxes. The retaliatory strike became known as the [[Crushed Helm Massacre]] – the Chondathan army and a force of elves clashed 50 miles into the Satyrwood. The Illistine troops were swiftly destroyed when [[voadkyn]] giants joined the fray. Only 200 Chondathan survived.

Laviar Illistine had no resources to deal with the wood giants, and he decided to focus on other trades. Chondathan foresters and woodcutters from destroyed cities moved to the edges of the [[Nunwood]] and founded the city of [[Hlath]]. The new city provided Chondath with lumber, nowhere as abundant as what was harvested in the Chondalwood.

In the {{YearlinkName|270}}, Anthony Illistine attempted an invasion of the neighboring nation of [[Turmish]]. He amassed Chondathan forces at the borders of Turmish, the act that was not unnoticed. The looming threat led to Turmish merchant houses banding together under the rule of the new leader – [[Alesam Mischwin]]. Laviar attacked, and his forces met their match. This conflict became known as [[the Stalemate]] as neither side could gain the upper hand nor wanted to retreat. Eventually, Laviar ordered retreat after Turmite forces moved to the city of [[Xorhun]]. The war interfered with Chondathan logging operations, and Turmish won the Stalemate.

After the end of Lavitar's tumultuous reign, the rulership of Chondath remained with the Illistine family at least as late as the {{YearlinkName|400}}.
