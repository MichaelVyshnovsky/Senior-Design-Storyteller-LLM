'''Salana''' was a [[pahari]] [[Elemental mage|sea mage]] inhabiting the waters of the [[Great Sea]] near [[Zarastro's Isle]] near the [[Corsair Domains]] in {{Yearlink|1367}}.{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
In her natural form, Salana's lower body was that of a large fish, while her upper body resembled a [[human]] woman. Her scales were [[ruby]] red in color. Her red hair and striking green eyes made her quite attractive. While immersed in sea water she was capable of changing her form into that of a teenage girl who stood {{SI|5'6|'"|c}} tall. She was quite oblivious to her beauty and never wore clothes regardless of her form. If threatened while underwater she would change into the form of a small red fish in order to escape. She was 60 years old as of 1367 DR.

==Personality==
Though young and naive, Salana was intelligent and headstrong. She was never afraid to voice her opinion.

==Abilities==
Salana usually had the following [[spell]]s memorized: ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[friends]]'', ''[[light]]'', ''[[sea sight]]'', ''[[fog cloud]]'', ''[[mirror image]]'', and ''[[converse with sea creatures]]''.

A kiss from Salana would grant the recipient the ability to breathe underwater for a full day.

==Possessions==
Salana's [[spellbook]] contained spells inscribed on purple shells she wore as a belt. Her [[material component]]s were kept in a pouch of woven kelp.

==Activities==
She was quite adventurous and enjoyed exploring shipwrecks and undersea ruins.
