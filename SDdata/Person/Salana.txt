Salana was a pahari sea mage inhabiting the waters of the Great Sea near Zarastros Isle near the Corsair Domains in .
In her natural form, Salanas lower body was that of a large fish, while her upper body resembled a human woman. Her scales were ruby red in color. Her red hair and striking green eyes made her quite attractive. While immersed in sea water she was capable of changing her form into that of a teenage girl who stood  tall. She was quite oblivious to her beauty and never wore clothes regardless of her form. If threatened while underwater she would change into the form of a small red fish in order to escape. She was 60 years old as of 1367 DR.
Though young and naive, Salana was intelligent and headstrong. She was never afraid to voice her opinion.
Salana usually had the following spells memorized charm person, friends, light, sea sight, fog cloud, mirror image, and converse with sea creatures.
A kiss from Salana would grant the recipient the ability to breathe underwater for a full day.
Salanas spellbook contained spells inscribed on purple shells she wore as a belt. Her material components were kept in a pouch of woven kelp.
She was quite adventurous and enjoyed exploring shipwrecks and undersea ruins.
