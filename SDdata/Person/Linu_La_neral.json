        "mainbody": "Linu Laneral was a female moon elf cleric of the elven goddess Sehanine Moonbow. She hailed from the city of Evereska. \nLinu was clumsy (some said unfortunate), often causing accidents in her wake. She had a somewhat naive worldview but was well liked by many people for her constantly positive outlook and her kindheartedness to others. She had a great deal of humorous lines and stories, including how she met her (later deceased) husband."
