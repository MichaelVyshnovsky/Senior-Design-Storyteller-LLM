She hailed from the city of [[Evereska]]. \n\nLinu was clumsy (some said unfortunate), often causing accidents in her wake. She had a somewhat naive worldview but was well liked by many people for her constantly positive outlook and her kindheartedness to others. She had a great deal of humorous lines and stories, including how she met her (later deceased) husband.<ref>"
