Beltyn was an early mage of Toril.While a date is unknown, the chronology of the Book of Bats suggests Beltyn was alive a long time before the midâ€“12 century DR.
The spell Beltyns burning blood was created by, or at least attributed to, Beltyn.
Curiously, the wine-based poison lhurdas was also known as "Beltyns Last Drink", but it is unclear if there is a connection.
