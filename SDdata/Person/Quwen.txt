Lord Quwen was the ruler of Ormath in the Shining Plains in 1370 DR.
Quwen often led the citys patrols outside the walls of the city in order to clear the road of bandits. In 1370 DR, he was concerned by reports of lizardfolk activities in the Wetwood none of the squads he had sent were heard from again.
Quwen was a true warrior at heart.
