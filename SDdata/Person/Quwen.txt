Lord '''Quwen''' was the ruler of [[Ormath]] in the [[Shining Plains]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Quwen often led the city's patrols outside the walls of the city in order to clear the road of bandits. In 1370 DR, he was concerned by reports of [[lizardfolk]] activities in the [[Wetwoods|Wetwood]]; none of the squads he had sent were heard from again.

==Personality==
Quwen was a true warrior at heart.
