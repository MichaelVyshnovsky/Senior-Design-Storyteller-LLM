'''Brack'thal Xorlarrin''' was a [[drow]] [[wizard]] of [[House Xorlarrin]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Prior to the [[Spellplague]], Brack'thal was a powerful wizard favored by [[Matron Mother]] [[Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin]]. The Spellplague turned him half-mad and half-comatose. After the death of the house patron, [[Horroodissomoth Xorlarrin]], Zeerith turned to her own son for heirs, producing [[Ravel Xorlarrin|Ravel]] from his loins.

Brack'thal was ordered by his mother to accompany the expedition led by Ravel to [[Gauntlgrym]] in the {{YearlinkName|1463}}. But empowered by his ability to tame the [[fire elemental]]s and frustrated with his increasingly weak position in the family, he sabotaged the Forge and set fire elementals to attack the workers. While doing so, he was confronted by [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], [[Artemis Entreri]], and [[Dahlia Sin'felle]], who were trying to reach the pit of the [[primordial]] [[Maegera]]. He attacked them and Entreri drew the killing blow.

==Skills==
Brack'thal was skilled in [[elemental magic]]. He learned his wizardry before the Spellplague, so his repertoire was considered outdated by the new "spellspinners" of House Xorlarrin. However, his old-fashioned magic worked better against fire elementals than that of the spellspinners.

==Possessions==
Brack'thal had a magical [[ruby]] ring that controlled fire elementals. Just before his death at the hands of Artemis Entreri, this ring was taken from him by Drizzt Do'Urden.

==Relationships==
Brack'thal was the son of [[Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin]]. He was both the half-brother and father of [[Ravel Xorlarrin]].
