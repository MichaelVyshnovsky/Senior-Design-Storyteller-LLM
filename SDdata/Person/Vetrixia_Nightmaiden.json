        "mainbody": "Vetrixia Nightmaiden was a devoted cleric of Velsharoon the Vaunted operating in the Delimbiyr Vale circa 1372 DR.\nVetrixia wore dark robes of her faith, contrasted by her pale skin.\nThe cleric openly carried an intimidating large black enchanted +1 whip. Nightmaiden carried a hempen rope. She wore no armor as Vetrixia was confident in the protection of her deity, her ring of protection, and being immune to all death magic. A periapt of wisdom decorated her pale neck.\nDuring her venture into Umgatliks shrine, Vetrixia carried scrolls of divine power and stone bones, as well as a crystal vial of potion of death armor.\nBy the , Vetrixia Nightmaiden was an established cleric of the god of necromancers who received a special gift from her deity. She could intuitively detect the undead, even if others believed it to be a god. A bumbling scholar from Waterdeep, Savant Gumbril, uncovered the location of the shrine of Umgatlik, whom he believed to be a lost Netherese god. His accidental discovery reached the ears of the Church of Velsharoon and Vetrixia immediately knew that the enigmatic Umgatlik was no god but an ancient and immensely powerful Netherese lich. The church tasked Vetrixia with infiltration of Gumbrils excavation team under the guise of a laborer. But as the bumbling fool gained entrance to the ancient tomb in the Crabs Claw Coast, the Nightmaiden was knocked out cold before she could assassinate the scholar.\nVetrixia was burning with rage and a desire to punish her attacker. She did not care whoâ€”the entire excavation group had to die. The cleric wanted to send their souls to Velsharoon and raise the bodies as her undead slaves. Vetrixia approached a new force from the city of Daggerford, the so-called Hero of Daggerford, offering him arcane power and ancient treasures in exchange for helping her to summon the ancient lich. It was not recorded if the Hero agreed to the proposition, but that did not stop Vetrixia from returning to Gumbril.\nWithin the crypt, Vetrixia Nightmaidens true agenda was revealed. She served Umgatlik, a would-be god who once had a following and organized worship, now locked away in a planar prison. Even if the Hero refused to get involved, the cleric would attempt to manipulate Savant Gumbril into doing her bidding through promises of riches and academic successes. However, a cleric of Kelemvor, Jared Deathstalker, was part of the expedition and was sure to try and prevent unleashing the lich onto Toril once again.\nIf the Netherese lich were to be unleashed thanks to Vetrixias machinations, his reward was the clerics murder and being raised as an undead apparition and servant."
