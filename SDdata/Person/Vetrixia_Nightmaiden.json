        "mainbody": "'''Vetrixia Nightmaiden''' was a devoted [[cleric]] of [[Velsharoon]] the Vaunted operating in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].\n{{quote|''Velsharoon has blessed me with his great powers. I am never wrong.''|Vetrixia Nightmaiden}}",
        "Description": "Vetrixia wore dark [[robe]]s of her faith, contrasted by her pale skin.",
        "Possessions": "The cleric openly carried an intimidating large black [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[whip]]. Nightmaiden carried a [[Hemp (plant)|hempen]] [[rope]]. She wore no armor as Vetrixia was confident in the protection of her deity, her ''[[ring of protection]]'', and being immune to all [[death magic]]. A ''[[periapt of wisdom]]'' decorated her pale neck.\n\nDuring her venture into [[Umgatlik's shrine]], Vetrixia carried [[scroll]]s of ''[[divine power]]'' and ''[[stone bones]]'', as well as a crystal vial of ''[[potion of death armor]].''",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Vetrixia Nightmaiden was an established cleric of the god of [[necromancer]]s who received a special gift from her deity. She could intuitively detect the [[undead]], even if others believed it to be a god. A bumbling scholar from [[Waterdeep]], Savant [[Gumbril]], uncovered the location of the shrine of Umgatlik, whom he believed to be a lost [[Netherese]] god. His accidental discovery reached the ears of the [[Church of Velsharoon]] and Vetrixia immediately knew that the enigmatic [[Umgatlik]] was no god but an ancient and immensely powerful Netherese [[lich]]. The church tasked Vetrixia with infiltration of Gumbril's excavation team under the guise of a laborer. But as the bumbling fool gained entrance to the ancient tomb in the [[Crab's Claw Coast]], the Nightmaiden was knocked out cold before she could assassinate the scholar.\n\nVetrixia was burning with rage and a desire to punish her attacker. She did not care whoâ€”the entire excavation group had to die. The cleric wanted to send their souls to Velsharoon and raise the bodies as her undead slaves. Vetrixia approached a new force from the city of [[Daggerford]], the so-called [[Hero of Daggerford]], offering him arcane power and ancient treasures in exchange for helping her to summon the ancient lich. It was not recorded if the Hero agreed to the proposition, but that did not stop Vetrixia from returning to Gumbril.\n\nWithin the crypt, Vetrixia Nightmaiden's true agenda was revealed. She served Umgatlik, a would-be god who once had a following and organized worship, now locked away in a planar prison. Even if the Hero refused to get involved, the cleric would attempt to manipulate Savant Gumbril into doing her bidding through promises of riches and academic successes. However, a cleric of [[Kelemvor]], [[Jared Deathstalker]], was part of the expedition and was sure to try and prevent unleashing the lich onto [[Toril]] once again.\n\nIf the Netherese lich were to be unleashed thanks to Vetrixia's machinations, his reward was the cleric's murder and being raised as an undead apparition and servant."
