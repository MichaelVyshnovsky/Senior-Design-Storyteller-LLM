        "mainbody": "'''Sh'derra D'zeer''' was a [[dragon aging|young]] [[amethyst dragon]] who dwelled in the southern [[Highstar Lake]] on the [[High Moor]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/Roll Call of Dragons}}",
        "Relationships": "She had now and then spoken to two [[copper dragon]]s of the High Moor—the bad-tempered [[Aaronarra]] and very rarely the violent [[Carynnallerastis]]—and thought they were particularly foolish for the detrimental effect they had on the local ecology. On occasion, she distracted them from engaging in something especially damaging.\n\nSh'derra had talked more often with the local [[druid]] [[Bara (druid)|Bara]]. The two were in good agreement on environmental matters and Bara hoped she could persuade Sh'derra to help her preserve the High Moors ecology, but doubted the amethyst dragon would go so far as to fight for it. Otherwise, Bara thought the gem dragon was beautiful and lovely.",
        "History": "Sh'derra was settled on the High Moor and an acquaintance of Bara in the mid-1360s DR.\n\nShe was known to be still alive after the [[Dracorage]] of [[1373 DR]]."
