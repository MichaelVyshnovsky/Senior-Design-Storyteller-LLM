        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, he was part of the doomed Adbar expedition led by King [[Bromm]], which was attacked by [[orc]]s of the [[Kingdom of Many-Arrows]]. Before battle was joined, Chayne and [[Oretheo Spikes]] rallied the dwarves' battle spirit, a task Bromm thought few were better suited to. Chayne died as the main enemy force appeared, his head smashed by a [[frost giant]]â€“thrown boulder while he carried out King Bromm's command for an orderly withdrawal. His last words were \"For the love o' ye Ma's hairy back, back and stay tight!\""
