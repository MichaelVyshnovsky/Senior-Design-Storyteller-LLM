        "mainbody": "Haarn Brightoak was an half-elven druid member of the Emerald Enclave who defended the wildlife and forests of Turmish in the late 14 century DR.\nLike many other druids, Haarn Brightoak had access to druidic spells granted by his deity. He possessed an ability to take on a wild shape of beasts, one of which was an owl.\nHaarn had a bear companion named Broadfoot.\nHaarns mother was a warrior– ahuman Harper agent, and father – an elven senior member of the Emerald Circle. Haarn Brightoak followed in his fathers footsteps after his mother stopped visiting them in the forest.\nTracking the signs of a healthy young female wolf that died by unnatural means led Haarn to the mercenary group that was trespassing and hunting in the lands that hed sworn to protect. It didnt take much eavesdropping for Haarn to discover that the five hunters were responsible for the slaughter of the wolf and many others before her and further that they were killing the wolves in exchange for payment for the wolves scalps. Despite Haarns limited exposure to women and his fascination with the sole female hunter in the group, he did not exclude her from his promise to kill each of the hunters should they not leave the forest and stop hunting wolves.\nSubsequently, Haarn Brightoak and members of the Emerald Enclave clashed with a reanimated mohrg warlord Borran Klosk, who raised an army of drowned ones around the Whamite Isles to attack the capital of Turmish – Alaghôn."
