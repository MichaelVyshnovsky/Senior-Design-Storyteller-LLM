Jhasso was a merchant from the city of Baldurs Gate on the Sword Coast in the mid–14 century DR.
He originally owned Jhassos Wagons, a fast-haul transport company. However, Jhasso partnered with six other merchants—Alvund of Ormpetarr, Chond of Calaunt, Dzunn of Sheirtalar, Nammna of Milvarune, Pomphur of Almraiven, and Shield of Everlund—to form the Seven Suns Trading Coster. The "Seven Suns" referred to the seven merchants themselves. Jhassos own small merchant company was converted into a regional base for the coster.
Jhasso and the Seven Suns were in business by 1358 DR, and still going by 1374 DR.
He found the Jhasso family, part of the Nobility of Baldurs Gate by 1482 DR.
In the , a member of the Jhasso family was taken by the vampire spawns of Cazador Szarr, a vampire lord of the Lower City, prompting investigations into the disappearances of several other patriars.
Jhasso was based in Baldurs Gate, where he managed the Seven Suns regional base there.
