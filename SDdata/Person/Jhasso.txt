'''Jhasso''' was a merchant from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] on the [[Sword Coast]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
He originally owned [[Jhasso's Wagons]], a fast-haul transport company. However, Jhasso partnered with six other merchants—[[Alvund]] of [[Ormpetarr]], [[Chond]] of [[Calaunt]], [[Dzunn]] of [[Sheirtalar]], [[Nammna]] of [[Milvarune]], [[Pomphur]] of [[Almraiven]], and [[Shield (merchant)|Shield]] of [[Everlund]]—to form the [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]]. The "Seven Suns" referred to the seven merchants themselves. Jhasso's own small merchant company was converted into a regional base for the [[coster]].

Jhasso and the Seven Suns were in business by [[1358 DR]], and still going by [[1374 DR]].

He found the [[Jhasso (family)|Jhasso]] family, part of the [[Nobility of Baldur's Gate]] by [[1482 DR]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a member of the Jhasso family was taken by the [[vampire spawn]]s of [[Cazador Szarr]], a [[vampire lord]] of the [[Lower City]], prompting investigations into the disappearances of several other patriars.

==Activities==
Jhasso was based in Baldur's Gate, where he managed the Seven Suns' regional base there.
