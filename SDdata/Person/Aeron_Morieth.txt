Aeron Morieth was a half-elven wizard and shadow adept who lived in Chessenta. 
In 1367 DR, Aeron Morieth became the Stormwalker of Maerchwood.
After the destruction of Cimbars College of Wizardry in 1370 DR, Aeron managed to depose the ruling Sceptanar of Chessenta and assumed the title. However, Aeron only held this post for a few months before handing it to Melisanda of Arrabar before moving to the Maerchwood.
By 1372 DR he had attracted the attention of Shar, who expressly forbade her devotees from approaching him in any way, although they were to maintain their surveillance.
