        "mainbody": "'''Runa Vokdottir''' was a member of the [[Stone-Cold Reavers]], a group of reckless adventurers who made their living sometimes as sellswords and sometimes as brigands.",
        "Description": "Runa was a muscular woman. She had black hair and cold blue eyes.",
        "Personality": "Runa knew nothing but violence to solve her problems and considered cruelty to be normal. She was a taciturn person but when she talked, her bitter sarcasm became apparent.",
        "History": "Runa grew up in the harsh north of [[Icewind Dale]]. Later, she traveled south where she joined the Stone-Cold Reavers. The group tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] from its lair, [[Icespire Hold]]. However, Cryovain hadn't amassed any treasure yet."
