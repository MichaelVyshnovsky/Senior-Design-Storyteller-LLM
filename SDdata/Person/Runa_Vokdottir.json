        "mainbody": "Runa Vokdottir was a member of the Stone-Cold Reavers, a group of reckless adventurers who made their living sometimes as sellswords and sometimes as brigands.\nRuna was a muscular woman. She had black hair and cold blue eyes.\nRuna knew nothing but violence to solve her problems and considered cruelty to be normal. She was a taciturn person but when she talked, her bitter sarcasm became apparent.\nRuna grew up in the harsh north of Icewind Dale. Later, she traveled south where she joined the Stone-Cold Reavers. The group tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young white dragon Cryovain from its lair, Icespire Hold. However, Cryovain hadnt amassed any treasure yet."
