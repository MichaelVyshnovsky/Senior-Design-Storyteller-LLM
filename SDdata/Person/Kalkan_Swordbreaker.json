Kalkan killed many of Demascus incarnations.\nKalkan helped Murmur revive the Cult of the Elder Elemental Eye in Akan没l in 1479 DR. Kalkan ambushed Demascus at the tomb of Demascuss last incarnation but Demascus was able to kill Kalkan.\nKalkan had a bestial face and large cat-like ears. His breath smelled like carrion.\nKalkan possessed Damos, an artifact of great power that allowed him to see into the future. The fact that Damos killed anyone who used it did not trouble Kalkan because he always rose again in a new incarnation.\nCategoryDevas (aasimar)\nCategoryInhabitants of Airspur\nCategoryInhabitants of Akan没l\nCategoryInhabitants of Interior Faer没n\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer没n\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryRakshasas\n74yi7q2rrqeoc11yzbmxmvklbf858qz"
