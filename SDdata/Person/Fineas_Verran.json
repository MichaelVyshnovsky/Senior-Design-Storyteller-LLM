        "mainbody": "'''Fineas Verran''' was a mage that lived in [[Neverwinter]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{Quote|With my rod, staff and wand near at hand I feel practically invincible! The array of useful spells at my fingertips is very nearly intoxicating, which makes it all the worse to have lost all three!|Entry in Finneas' journal, 1385 DR.}}",
        "Possessions": "Fineas was proud of a collection of [[magic]]al [[implement]]s: a [[rod]], a [[staff]], and a [[wand]].",
        "History": "Finneas was plagued with misfortune the day the [[Spellplague]] struck the Realms on [[Tarsakh 29]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}. First, Fineas  left behind the rod while trading at the [[Merchant Guild Hall]] in the [[Neverwinter/River District|River District]],{{NWDistricts}} misplaced the [[staff]] while taking a rest later on, and the [[wand]] likely slipped from Fineas's satchel somewhere along the way. The moment Finneas took time to lament about these woes in a journal, [[blue fire]] rained down from the skies causing great destruction in Neverwinter and beyond. Finneas would then lose the journal too.\n\nFinneas's magical tools were rendered inert by the catastrophic event and were lost in the area. They were eventually found by an adventurer who came across Finneas's journal in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. The mage [[Riftel Farsight]] purchased them as curios."
