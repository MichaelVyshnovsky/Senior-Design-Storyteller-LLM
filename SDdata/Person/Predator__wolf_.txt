Predator was one of the two pet wolfs who belonged to an ogre bandit leader Bonegnasher from Shadowdale in the mid-14 century DR.
Predator was a grey wolf, slightly bigger than Crusher.
Both wolves, Predator and Crusher were virtually inseparable from their master, Bonegnasher, spending most of their time in the ogres lair, in the sub-levels of the Tomb of Damara.
During the time Bonegnasher occupied the ruins of the Damaras Castle, his pets served as his loyal guards. When a group of adventurers from Freedale confronted the bandits and slavers of the castle, both wolves and their owner died in a battle against them.
