'''Sabkhat el Talab''' was a sage and diviner of the [[Bedine]].

==Description==
He wore distinct clothing.

==Relationships==
For whatever reason, Sabkhat el Talab was the subject of divinations on the part of [[Cormyr]].

==History==
In {{yearlink|1368}}, Sabkhat el Talab sought out a path across the [[Scimitar Peaks]] that was shorter than the one commonly used. He went missing during the search, prompting the Crown of Cormyr to send agents to look for him. The last person to see him was a [[serpent lord]] who saw him go down a crevasse along the road.

Actually, Sabkhat el Talab had died near the center of the ''[[lifedrain]]'' effect created by a [[phaerimm]] spell within the crevasse.
