'''Mistress Noralli''' was a merchant and rumormonger of the new community of [[Spiderhaven]] inside [[Undermountain]] in [[1375 DR]].
 
==Personality==
Noralli was very amicable for a dread necromancer, having been raised to be honest and forthcoming with others. She spoke all about rumors in the community but was sometimes cryptic.

==Activities==
Noralli sold and bought goods. Among them, she sold very suspicious [[soap]]s and bought clothing, usually taken from the dead.

Noralli also appeared to operate the only carousel in all the [[Underdark]], using living animals reanimated as [[undead]]. These animals included a [[giant eagle]], three [[giant spider]]s, four [[horse]]s, and two [[mule]]s. She charged 2 [[copper piece]]s for a 5 minute ride on her carousel, but warned patrons to keep their arms away from the beasts' mouths since some tended to bite.

==Relationship==
Noralli went on adventures together with [[Jhai'edaliander Thistleberry]]. She always had with her her [[imp]] familiar [[Croat]], which masqueraded as a flying [[squirrel]].
