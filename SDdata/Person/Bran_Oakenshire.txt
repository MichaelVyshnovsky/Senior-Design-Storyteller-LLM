'''Bran Oakenshire''' was one of the [[Stalwart Lions]], masters of [[Crosswinds Keep]] as of {{yearlink|1372}}.

==Description==
Bran was six feet two, and weighed {{SI|175|pounds|k|long=yes}}. He was physically powerful, with a graying beard and hair, often dressing in workman's clothes.

==Personality==
He did not see himself as refined or cultured and saw no point to pretending otherwise.

==Abilities==
Of note, Bran was capable of tracking.

==Possessions==
Of note, Bran had captured a [[Githyanki silver sword]], which he had been able to keep in spite of numerous attempts from the gith to recover it.

==Activities==
As one of the masters of [[Crosswinds Keep]], he was oft called to its defense.

==Relationships==
He had moved to the [[Astral Plane]] with Moala Addrell, with whom he was in love.

==History==
Born in [[Waterdeep]], he served at the age of seventeen in a ship that plied the sea between that city and the [[Moonshae Isles]]. At the age of 24, he met the other members of the [[Stalwart Lions]] in a tavern near the docks of Waterdeep, and they struck out towards [[Myth Drannor]], from which they barely escaped with their lives. Over a number of commissions, they became protectors of the heartlands of [[Faer√ªn]].

At some point in his adventuring career, Bran confessed his love to fellow Stalwart Lion [[Moala Addrell]]. When she was ordered by [[Chauntea]] to make a safe spot in the [[Astral Plane]], Bran joined her there, where their lifespan would not mismatch, and helped found Crosswinds Keep.
