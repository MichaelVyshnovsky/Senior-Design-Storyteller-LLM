Bran was six feet two, and weighed . He was physically powerful, with a graying beard and hair, often dressing in workmans clothes.

Of note, Bran was capable of tracking.
Of note, Bran had captured a Githyanki silver sword, which he had been able to keep in spite of numerous attempts from the gith to recover it.
As one of the masters of Crosswinds Keep, he was oft called to its defense.
He had moved to the Astral Plane with Moala Addrell, with whom he was in love.
Born in Waterdeep, he served at the age of seventeen in a ship that plied the sea between that city and the Moonshae Isles. At the age of 24, he met the other members of the Stalwart Lions in a tavern near the docks of Waterdeep, and they struck out towards Myth Drannor, from which they barely escaped with their lives. Over a number of commissions, they became protectors of the heartlands of Faer√ªn.
At some point in his adventuring career, Bran confessed his love to fellow Stalwart Lion Moala Addrell. When she was ordered by Chauntea to make a safe spot in the Astral Plane, Bran joined her there, where their lifespan would not mismatch, and helped found Crosswinds Keep.
