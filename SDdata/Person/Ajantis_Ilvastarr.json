        "mainbody": "'''Ajantis Ilvastarr''' was a noble [[paladin]] of [[Helm]] and a knight of the [[Order of the Radiant Heart]] that lived during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|[[Evil]] will always fail against courage and honor.|Ajantis}}",
        "Personality": "Fitting for a paladin, Ajantis was known to be a self-righteous, yet somewhat naive individual.",
        "Relationships": "He was acquainted with another squire of the Radiant Heart, [[Anomen Delryn]] of [[Athkatla]].",
        "History": "Ajantis was born to the noble [[Ilvastarr]] family of [[Waterdeep]]. During his youth he received exceptional martial training learning the art of sword-fighting under the tutelage of [[Myrmith Splendon]].\n\nSome years later he joined the [[Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart]] and garnered the attention of the highly respected [[Keldorn Firecam]]. He served the elder knight as a squire and a member of the [[Radiant Heart Auxiliary]].\n\nWhen the [[iron crisis]] plagued the [[Sword Coast]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Ajantis felt a call-to-action. He sought to investigate the bandits that plagued the region in order to attain the status within his order as a full-fledged knight.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Ajantis made his way down to Amn. Some time that year, Ajantis and other knights of the Radiant Heart spent time traveling through the [[Windspear Hills]]. Unbeknownst to them, the knights had [[illusion]]s placed upon them by [[Jierdan Firkraag|Lord Jierdan Firkraag]]. The magic gave the knights the appearance of [[ogre]]s, and also made them perceive other [[humanoid]]s the same way. As a result of the illusion, Ajantis and his companions were slain by [[Abdel Adrian|Gorion's Ward]]."
