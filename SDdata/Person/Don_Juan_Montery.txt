==Description==
Don Juan was a fair-haired man of, allegedly, noble [[Cimbar]]ian blood.

==History==
Don Juan Montery swiftly advanced in rank among the Knights of the Golden Rooster within a single year. His adventures brought the knight to the attention of [[Jacinth Moonspring|Jacinth "Jackie" Moonspring]], the Society Editor of the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' [[broadsheet]]. However, it was Don Juan's sexual conquests that earned him an appearance in Jacinth's column. The Society Editor speculated that Don Juan Montery must've lost a bet because he was seen frolicking with [[Vedina Stareye]], a woman with [[Pox (plague)|pox]]-scarred face and a voice that sounded like fingernails scratching [[slate]]. Within one month, Montery was seen in the company of other ladies of the Bluff: the [[half-elven]] scout named [[Opal Starlight]] and a handsome [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]], [[Yvonne Chantel]]. Interestingly enough, Yvonne claimed to have had never been with the "Chicken Knight" herself. The latest conquest, or maybe, a target of Montery's attention, was a fellow Knight of the Golden Roosterâ€”[[Ladyhawke]]. Jackie Moonspring also noted that it was unknown if Don Juan and Ladyhawke would ever get close as the man was an infantry member, while Ladyhawke served as a city walls guardswoman.
