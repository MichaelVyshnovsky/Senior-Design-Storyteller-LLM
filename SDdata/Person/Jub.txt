'''Jub''' was a [[half-drow]] [[half-orc]] fisherman in [[Skullport]].

==History==
Jub was originally a slave saved from his slavers by [[Elkantar Iluim]] and his men. Out of gratitude he sometimes acted as a spy for [[Qilu√© Veladorn]].

Around the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Jub was almost completely melted down by the [[dracolich]] [[Daurgothoth]] while spying on the [[Selvetargtlin]]'s attack on the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]].

Later in 1379 DR, Jub was fishing with his companions when he happened to meet Leliana again as she was investigating a wizard's [[construct]].

During the attack by [[Ghaunadaur]]'s followers on the Promenade, Jub was casually there and was put inside the Pit together with [[Naxil]] by the priests that were trying to awaken the [[avatar]] of their god.
