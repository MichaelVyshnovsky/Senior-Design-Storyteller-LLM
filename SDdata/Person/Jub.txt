Jub was a half-drow half-orc fisherman in Skullport.
Jub was originally a slave saved from his slavers by Elkantar Iluim and his men. Out of gratitude he sometimes acted as a spy for Qilu√© Veladorn.
Around the , Jub was almost completely melted down by the dracolich Daurgothoth while spying on the Selvetargtlins attack on the Promenade of the Dark Maiden.
Later in 1379 DR, Jub was fishing with his companions when he happened to meet Leliana again as she was investigating a wizards construct.
During the attack by Ghaunadaurs followers on the Promenade, Jub was casually there and was put inside the Pit together with Naxil by the priests that were trying to awaken the avatar of their god.
