'''Haskar Corintis''' was the leader of [[Ormpetarr]]'s thieves' guild in the nation of [[Sespech]] in the mid and late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
As [[Thuragar Foemaster]], an [[adventurer]] of some renown, rose to rule the nation of [[Sespech]] in the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, the new Baron denounced the puppet-control of [[Chondath]] and imposed strict laws on the previously lax nation. The citizens of Sespech welcomed the new ruler and being free from [[Arrabar]]'s influence at long last. However, not all shared the sentiment. Haskar Corintis and his thieves' guild promptly rebelled against the rigid laws of Baron Foemaster. Haskar, financed by Arrabar, staged bandit raids on merchant caravans and sparked several bloody battles on the streets of Ormpetarr.
