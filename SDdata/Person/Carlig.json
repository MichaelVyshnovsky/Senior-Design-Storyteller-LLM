        "mainbody": "arlig was a duergar trader in the Underdark.\nCarlig set up a duergar trading encampment, along with Finderlig and Uder Mordin, near the underground entrance to Spellhold. He reported to Gorions Ward that he had recently seen Jon Irenicus and Bodhi travel through the Underdark towards a city called Ust Natha.\nDespite being typically xenophobic to surface dwellers, he was more than eager to trade with them. Carlig sold an array of spells and equipment. He considered himself a simple trader, and did not wish to get involved in matters concerning the drow. Despite this, he would only sell his special goods to races native to the Underdark."
