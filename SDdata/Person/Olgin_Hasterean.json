        "mainbody": "'''Olgin Hasterean''' was the [[oni mage]] leader of a tribe of noxious [[ogre]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[orc]]s who dwelt within [[Undermountain]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "Olgin was a brutish giant of an ogre whose rugged exterior hid cunning intelligence. He was a powerful spellcaster and was accompanied by summoned [[dire bear]]s at all times.",
        "Possessions": "The oni wore a pair of [[enchanted]] ''[[dragon slippers]]'' and hud many treasures within his makeshift throne room, including such items as valuable [[rogue stone]]s and a powerful ''[[harp of haunting]]''.",
        "History": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, [[Halaster Blackcloak]], the Mad Mage of Undermountain brought Olgin and many other monstrous humanoids into his underground domain. The ogre mage quickly rose to power due to his powerful magics. After Halaster's disappearance and Undermountain becoming taken over by the [[drow]], Olgin led his tribe of ogres against [[harpies]] and fey led by the so-called [[Fairy Queen]]. When [[Drogan Droganson's pupil]] entered the dungeon in search of the drow mastermind behind the recent associations in [[Waterdeep]], the hero came head to head with Olgin and his Fairy Queen foe; however, it was unknown if the oni survived the meeting. One thing was known â€“ if Olgin Hasterean was defeated, he was eager to save his life through negotiations and opening the passage to Undermountain's lower level."
