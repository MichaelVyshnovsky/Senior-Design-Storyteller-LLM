'''Janath Rendaer''' was one of the [[magelord]]s of the kingdom of [[Athalantar]].

==History==
Janath was a sarcastic individual who was one of the first magelords to join [[Belaur Aumar]]. However, he was the only magelord to befriend any of the Athalantan knights or arms-men.

He died in the magelords' assault on the [[Wyrm Tower]] in [[222 DR]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign}}
