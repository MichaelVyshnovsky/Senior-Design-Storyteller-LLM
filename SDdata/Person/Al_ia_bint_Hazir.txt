Al'ia was a skilled [[Elemental mage|sea mage]].

It was rumored that the Sultan once proposed marriage to Al'ia, to which she replied that she would rather serve at Yusef's side than at his feet. Despite this it was also rumored that she bore him several sons over the years and smuggled them out of Gana for training elsewhere in [[Zakhara]].
