Alia bint Hazir was the Chief Vizier of Gana in the Pearl Cities region of west Zakhara in 1367 DR. 
As it was widely known that Sultan Yusef al-Wadi preferred to refresh his court with new members on a regular basis, Alias position in the court of Gana was unique in that she served him for several decades. She often advised the sultan to execute compassion over harsh justice.
Alia was a skilled sea mage.
It was rumored that the Sultan once proposed marriage to Alia, to which she replied that she would rather serve at Yusefs side than at his feet. Despite this it was also rumored that she bore him several sons over the years and smuggled them out of Gana for training elsewhere in Zakhara.
