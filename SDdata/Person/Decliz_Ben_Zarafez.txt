Decliz BenZarafez was the matron mother of House BenZarafez until the early 12 century DR.
Decliz ruled House BenZarafez in Menzoberranzan, a high-ranking house that was slowly declining. In 1118 DR, Decliz tried to regain her fortune by hiring large numbers of mercenaries, but her plot backfired and Matron Malice DoUrden decided to obliterate the old House.
Zaknafein DoUrden, leading the DoUrden army, stormed the BenZarafez castle and confronted Matron Decliz. Matron Decliz offered no defenses and wanted to die in order to finally meet Lolth. To this end, she had sacrificed her two young children to the goddess. In a rage, Zaknafein beheaded Decliz and presented her head to Briza DoUrden.
