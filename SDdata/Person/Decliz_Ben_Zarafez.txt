'''Decliz Ben'Zarafez''' was the matron mother of [[House Ben'Zarafez]] until the early 12{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Decliz ruled [[House Ben'Zarafez]] in [[Menzoberranzan]], a high-ranking house that was slowly declining. In [[1118 DR]], Decliz tried to regain her fortune by hiring large numbers of mercenaries, but her plot backfired and Matron [[Malice Do'Urden]] decided to obliterate the old House.

[[Zaknafein Do'Urden]], leading the Do'Urden army, stormed the Ben'Zarafez castle and confronted Matron Decliz. Matron Decliz offered no defenses and wanted to die in order to finally meet [[Lolth]]. To this end, she had sacrificed her two young children to the goddess. In a rage, Zaknafein beheaded Decliz and presented her head to [[Briza Do'Urden]].
