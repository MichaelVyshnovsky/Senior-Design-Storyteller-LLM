Ezira Gloomdelve was a vampire and a top advisor to the mercenary lord Dalagor in Skullport in 1370 DR.
Ezira was once an adventurer until she was bitten by a vampire while relaxing in Skullport. Her master was soon killed by his bride in revenge and Ezira found herself free, at least until she met Dalagor. He made her his servant by threatening her spellbook. She lived in Dalagors mansion and could drain only slaves and was forbidden to create more vampires.
Aside from her partnership with Dalagor, Ezira had two human male vampire servants under her.
