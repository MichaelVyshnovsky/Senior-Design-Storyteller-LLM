        "mainbody": "Lord Alaphondar Emmarask was one of the leading sages in service to the royalty of Cormyr in Suzail in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nAlaphondar had a magical stone that could summon the High Wizard Vangerdahast.\nIn 1369 DR, during the abraxus affair, Alaphondar was disguised as a stooped, stout merchant with missing teeth. He assumed the name of \"Flammos Galdekund\", so that he and Queen Filfaeril Obarskyr could hide in Waterdeep until the plot against the crown could be resolved."
