KazzTemmet, the Lord of the Infernal Pit and the Master of the Twelve Blades of Gorgos, was a balor summoned by the Order of the Crippled Fang in 1373 DR.
KazzTemmet had a pair of powerful bat-like wings, and skull visage with malice-filled eyes.
The balor wielded one of the enchanted Abyssal blades that glowed with red radiance. These weapons were given to the most powerful generals of the Abyss.
KazzTemmet was a powerful Abyssal general. In the , several influential denizens of the lower planes were pulled to Toril by the Order of the Crippled Fang, under the command of archwizard Maganus. The cult unleashed the fiends on the Moonsea region, interrupting trade, sowing destruction, and attacking Zhentarim-controlled territories. KazzTemmet was bound by summonings and put in charge of the attack on the town of Voonlar. As the balors armies ravaged the city, cultists assassinated the High Priest of Bane, Gormstadd. Following the battle, KazzTemmet was ordered to stay on the Shind Road and slaughter anything, especially Zhent forces, that passed. Along with KazzTemmet, the cult summoned a powerful slaad general Grazkahn, with whom the balor shared a long and bloody animosity.
Even magically enslaved, KazzTemmet did not abandon his sinister plans. He thought the summoning to be an opportunity. If he were to slay Grazkahn and his slaadi, he would win invaluable time that would allow the blare to break free of magical bondage and stay on Toril of his own free will. Unable to slay the foe personally, KazzTemmet tested the Hero of Daggerford and his allies mettle by sending fiends against the adventurers. Seeing how formidable the Hero was, KazzTemmet offered him a deal slay Grazkahn and receive power and riches. It was unknown whether the Hero of Daggerford accepted the proposition, slew the field, or left the demon lords to their own business. One thing was sure, KazzTemmet had no intention of keeping the promise of the reward.
