        "mainbody": "'''Kellan''' was a member of the [[Sisterhood of the Silver Fire]] who was a part of the squad sent into the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] to stop the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s plot in [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "Kellan had an intense personality, a remnant of her mysterious past wielding [[sword]] and [[spell]] for someone other than the [[Lady of Mystery]]. She kept her true name a secret from all, the name she used in the past. It was the secret she was ready to kill for.",
        "Abilities": "The Sister of the Silver Fire was an astonishingly talented woman. She was intelligent, strong, dextrous, and charismatic. She honed her combat reflexes, skills with arms and armor and had an impressive talent for handling Mystra's ''[[weave]].'' Her past also granted the Sister excellent strategical and tactical prowess.",
        "Possessions": "Kellan was armed with two [[enchanted]] weapons: a ''+2 [[light mace]]'' and a ''+2 [[sling of striking]]''. She wore a ''+3 [[ring of protection]]'', an ''[[amulet of intellect]]'', and carried a ''[[Healing salve|salve of full healing]]''.\n\nAs a member of the Sisterhood, she wore a ceremonial garb of her faction - a bright white [[robe]] with blue trimmings and the star of Mystra proudly displayed in the center of her chest.",
        "History": "When the Cult of the Dragon took over the ruins of Myth Drannor in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Sisterhood of the Silver Fire swiftly assembled a squad to be sent against their sworn enemy. Kellan joined the group along with several other Sisters, and with the help of a guide – [[ranger]] [[Bronwyn]], they traveled to the occupied elven city. As the group explored the ruins collecting intel on the evil Cult's plot, they were ambushed by the dreaded [[dracolich]] [[Pelendralaar]], and survivors of the encounter scattered. One by one, the Sisters met their doom at the hands, claws, and teeth of monsters that crawled into the ruins. Kellan and Bronwyn were the only survivors. the woman gradually made way into the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]] and found a strategically sound spot where they could survive any assault of the Cult.\n\nThe women remained there at the [[Shrine of the Silver Fire]] until a group of adventures - the [[Veiled Ones]], aided [[Gloran]] and [[Ethe]], [[guardian naga]] priests of Mystra. They gladly volunteered to join the Veiled Ones on the quest to stop the Cult and its leader [[Kya Mordrayn]]. They brought brawn and magic to aid the party, as well as knowledge of ancient lore of the City of Song. They helped the Veiled Ones in finding the Guardian of the ''[[Mythal]]'', [[baelnorn]] [[Miroden Silverblade]]."
