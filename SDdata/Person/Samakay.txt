'''Samakay the Wry''' was the king of [[Golconda]] in [[Turmish]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Activities==
Samakay ruled the small kingdom of Golconda.

==History==
In [[1355 DR]], the self-styled king of [[Muktar]], [[Yrkhetep|Hetep]], started a war against Golconda.

In 1358 DR, during Samakay's war council, the spymaster [[Boubakar]] reported that one of his men had discovered that Hetep's battle plans were hidden in the small keep of [[Fort Blood]]. Convinced by Boubakar's arguments and despite Count [[Belim]]'s objections, Samakay hired an adventuring party well known to him to resolve the matter.

Soon after, however, Samakay died of old age without an heir.
 
==Relationship==
Samakay trusted only Lord [[Daud]] until the latter's death in [[1357 DR]].

==Personality==
Samakay was a just and kind ruler but knew nothing of military matters.
