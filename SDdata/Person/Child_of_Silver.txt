The Child of Silver was an up and coming halfling merchant in Huzuz in Zakhara around 1367 DR.
The Child of Silver was a moniker taken by the halfling until he proved himself worthy of his prosperous merchant families name. He planned to achieve this goal by importing rare and exotic commodities to the City of Delights. He hired an escort of body guards to keep him intact during his dealings.
He owned a philter of glibness.
