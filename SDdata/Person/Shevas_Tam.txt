Shevas Tam was one of the great Red Wizards of Thay during the 11 century DR. He was a member of the ancient and influential Tam family, and the father of the future zulkir of necromancy, Szass Tam. 
During the first century of Thays existence, the Guild of Portages was responsible for transporting goods overland, up the First Escarpment where the River Thay was not traversable by boat. They charged exorbitant fees for this service, to which Shevas Tam took particular exception. Rather than continue to pay gold to the corrupt organization, he killed their guildmaster along with most of his lackeys and transformed them into undead creatures. 
Shevas Tam thus established the long portage, a trail of sorts through which hordes of zombies carried goods from Thayan ships to another. This system of conveyance remained in use for well over 300 years and supplied the Tam family with a significant source of wealth.
