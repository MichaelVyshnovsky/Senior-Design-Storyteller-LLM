'''Hariah Highkin''' was a ruler of the kingdom of [[Doegan]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

After previous turmoil, Doegan fell into the safe and steady hands of Hariah Highkin. The capital prospered, the borders held firm, and people were happy. Nevertheless, on a quest to unify the wartorn Utter East through conquest, the leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] returned and tried to conquer Doegan, no matter the cost to the realm.
