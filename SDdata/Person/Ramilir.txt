'''Ramilir''' was an acolyte of the [[Avowed]] that lived in the great fortified library of [[Candlekeep]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Ramilir was a driven and scholar and forthright man that received much gratification from his work in the halls of Candlekeep. Despite his dedication to academia, Ramilir could be careless when given too many tasks at the same time.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, accidentally pulled the [[curse]]d book title ''[[The Scrivener's Tale]]'' from the vaults of Candlekeep and offered it to a group of adventurers by mistake. Ramilir's error led to a member of the group suffering the curse of the [[scrivener's mark]], that gradually caused them to transform into a [[petrified]] being of shadow glass.
