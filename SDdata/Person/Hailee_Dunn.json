        "mainbody": "ailee Dunn was a troublesome child from the town of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale in the late 13 century DR.\nHailee Dunn was still a precocious youth in the . She was born in Lonelywood to Tybald Dunn, a struggling cooper, and Ambere Dunn, his heavily-drinking wife. The family lived on the far northern side of town by the woods. Hailee was the only child in Lonelywood at the time and was known as a liar and prankster. She often climbed trees and peeked into the towns windows and knew all kinds of gossip. Every time a new visitor arrived at Lonelywood, she would cry and scream for help near the town well, calming her brother, who fell down and was hurt, unable to call out for help. That was a lie – Hailee did not have a brother. The adventuring group known as the Heroes of Icewind Dale may had encountered the little rascal and fell for her well prank in 1281 DR. When the new undertaker came to Lonelywood, pretending to me a simpleton, Hailee took on testing him without realizing that he secretly was an assassin. The child would throw briarcones at Purvis, and toss stones at his doors to lure him out. She also spied on Purvis through his shacks windows, watching him sit crosslegged unmoving for hours. Another victim of Hailees snooping was Kieran Nye, the proprietor of The Whistling Gallows inn, whom she witnessed walking through a magical mirror in his bedroom."
