High Lord Abbot '''Grigor Khazaar''' was the head of the [[Abbey of the Blinding Truth]] in the city of [[Westgate]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a militant [[cleric]] of [[Tyr]] who led his clergy of priests, [[monk]]s, and [[paladin]]s in a campaign against the criminal guild known as the [[Night Masks]].

==Relationships==
The high priest's rhetoric struck a chord with Westgate's conservative [[Seirkas Urdo]], and the two met fairly often, either at private dinners or after service within the temple's chapel.

The Night Masks had [[Thistle Thalavar|Lady Thistle Thalavar]] spy upon Khazaar, and report his activities to the guild's master, [[Orbakh]] (who was in fact a ''[[stasis clone|clone]]'' of the dark [[mage]] [[Manshoon]]). The Night King considered ordering the murder of the Tyrran priest, but believed his martyrdom would attract more followers of the Just Deity to his city.

In [[1372 DR]], shortly after the founding of the abbey, High Lord Abbot Khazaar appealed to the city's noble council, in an effort to rid the city of its lawless [[thieves]] and [[assassin]]s.
