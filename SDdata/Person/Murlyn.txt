'''Murlyn''', also known as '''Blind Lemon Murlyn''', was a [[human]] [[bard]] and [[wild mage]] who worked for the [[Harpers]].

==Description==
Dressed in yellow, Murlyn had graying, dark hair tied up in a ponytail, and a short beard with no mustache. He wore an eyepatch over his right eye.

==Possessions==
Murlyn owned a ''[[harp of charming]]'', which enabled him to cast ''[[suggestion]]'' on his audience. He used this power when recruiting adventurers on behalf of the Harpers. Murlyn's ''harp'' had a {{frac|1|20}} chance of causing a ''[[wild surge]]'' along with the ''suggestion'', causing strange and random effects, such as temporarily changing him to a [[gnome]], or making him exude a ''[[stinking cloud]]''.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|27|Murlyn's Harp of Charming}}

He also owned a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]'', as well as a ''[[staff of striking]]''.

==History==
Murlyn was recruited by the Harpers to undertake a mission into [[Thay]], which ended in disaster and left Murlyn completely blind. Luckily, he was rescued by the [[Brotherhood of the Yellow Rose]], who took him in and taught him "finger-runes", enabling him to cast spells once more. During the [[Time of Troubles]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], a wild spell restored Murlyn's left eye.
