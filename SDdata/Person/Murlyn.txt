Murlyn, also known as Blind Lemon Murlyn, was a human bard and wild mage who worked for the Harpers.
Dressed in yellow, Murlyn had graying, dark hair tied up in a ponytail, and a short beard with no mustache. He wore an eyepatch over his right eye.
Murlyn owned a harp of charming, which enabled him to cast suggestion on his audience. He used this power when recruiting adventurers on behalf of the Harpers. Murlyns harp had a  chance of causing a wild surge along with the suggestion, causing strange and random effects, such as temporarily changing him to a gnome, or making him exude a stinking cloud.
He also owned a pair of bracers of defense, as well as a staff of striking.
Murlyn was recruited by the Harpers to undertake a mission into Thay, which ended in disaster and left Murlyn completely blind. Luckily, he was rescued by the Brotherhood of the Yellow Rose, who took him in and taught him "finger-runes", enabling him to cast spells once more. During the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, a wild spell restored Murlyns left eye.
