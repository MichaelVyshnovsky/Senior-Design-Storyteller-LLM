'''Sirge Wintermelt''' was a scout and member of the [[Harpers]] in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1489 DR]], Sirge followed rumors of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] gathering [[orc]]s from the [[Thar]]. In doing this, Sirge discovered the [[Claws of Tiamat]] bandit gang. He was captured by them and discovered that they were not Dragon Cultists, but only crazed zealots of [[Tiamat]]. Eventually, he was freed by an adventuring party hired to clear the [[Iron Route]] of outlaws.{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|18}}

In [[1491 DR]], he possibly resurfaced in [[Mulmaster]] during an investigation of a mine in te [[Earthspur Mountains]]. He said to the adventurers that Harpers wanted to free the local miners and that most political dissidents of the city knew important secrets.{{Cite adventurers league/Mayhem in the Earthspur Mines|12}}
