        "mainbody": "'''Arvik Zaltos''' was a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] in [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1485 DR]].",
        "History": "In 1485 DR, Arvik paid the [[Clotskull]] [[orc]]s, led by [[Booga]], to attack the [[Floshin Estates]] in order to gain access to an ancient altar to [[Yan-C-Bin]] in the family crypts. A maid from the Floshin Estates survived the attack, escaped, and told Daggerford authorities about who had attacked them. Eventually, Arvik was identified and captured by Daggerford authorities. Arvik was hanged in the town square, on the rainy [[Midsummer]] of 1485 DR.",
        "Possessions": "Prior to his capture and hanging, Arvik Zaltos was in possession of ''[[The Tome of Blasphemous Magic]]'', a spellbook loaned to him by [[Szass Tam]] himself, for his mission. The book was filled with bizarre [[necromancy|necromantic]] rituals and twisted variations of existing spells."
