        "mainbody": "Arvik Zaltos was a Red Wizard of Thay in Daggerford circa 1485 DR.\nIn 1485 DR, Arvik paid the Clotskull orcs, led by Booga, to attack the Floshin Estates in order to gain access to an ancient altar to Yan-C-Bin in the family crypts. A maid from the Floshin Estates survived the attack, escaped, and told Daggerford authorities about who had attacked them. Eventually, Arvik was identified and captured by Daggerford authorities. Arvik was hanged in the town square, on the rainy Midsummer of 1485 DR.\nPrior to his capture and hanging, Arvik Zaltos was in possession of The Tome of Blasphemous Magic, a spellbook loaned to him by Szass Tam himself, for his mission. The book was filled with bizarre necromantic rituals and twisted variations of existing spells."
