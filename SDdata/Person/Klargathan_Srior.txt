Klargathan Srior was an adventurer archmage from southern Faerûn during the mid–8 century DR.
He was the haughtiest archmage in his group.
He was tall, with a spade-shaped beard, and wore golden earrings. He had long robes, too long for him to run effectively.
He carried a staff that could shrink into a baton to hang from his belt.
Amongst other spells, he could cast a spell-tree that sucked the blood and organs from those it struck, and had another spell that caused lightning to dance between sapphires within range.
He was an adventurer, in an alliance of adventurers that also included Ardelnar Trethran and Larando. Also, he had a wife.
In the , Klargathan Srior was part of an alliance of three parties that adventured together into Myth Drannor, with a total of seven wizards, two of them archwizards. But, despite the team-up, they still found themselves slaughtered by baatezu. Klargathan escaped with Ardelnar Trethran and Larando. After Larando was slain too, Ardelnar and Klargathan ran on.
Eventually Klargathan called on Ardelnar to help him make a stand the mage gave Ardelnar a kiss, asking him to pray to Tempus the kiss reached his wife. Klargathan then cast a spell-tree that blocked some of the pursuing fiends, and then used Ardelnars sapphires to empower a lightning spell that allowed him to strike at throngs of fiends in one blow. However, he was struck down in a final ambush when they were close to making it out, after following a game trail into a clearing.
