'''Klargathan Srior''' was an [[adventurer]] [[archmage]] from southern [[Faerûn]] during the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was the haughtiest archmage in his group.

==Description==
He was tall, with a spade-shaped beard, and wore golden earrings. He had long [[robes]], too long for him to run effectively.

==Possessions==
He carried a [[staff]] that could shrink into a baton to hang from his belt.

==Abilities==
Amongst other [[spell]]s, he could cast a ''[[spell-tree]]'' that sucked the blood and organs from those it struck, and had another spell that caused lightning to dance between [[sapphire]]s within range.

==Relationships==
He was an adventurer, in an alliance of adventurers that also included [[Ardelnar Trethran]] and [[Larando]]. Also, he had a wife.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|760}}, Klargathan Srior was part of an alliance of three parties that adventured together into [[Myth Drannor]], with a total of seven [[wizard]]s, two of them archwizards. But, despite the team-up, they still found themselves slaughtered by [[baatezu]]. Klargathan escaped with Ardelnar Trethran and Larando. After Larando was slain too, Ardelnar and Klargathan ran on.

Eventually Klargathan called on Ardelnar to help him make a stand; the mage gave Ardelnar a kiss, asking him to pray to [[Tempus]] the kiss reached his wife. Klargathan then cast a ''spell-tree'' that blocked some of the pursuing [[fiend]]s, and then used Ardelnar's sapphires to empower a lightning spell that allowed him to strike at throngs of fiends in one blow. However, he was struck down in a final ambush when they were close to making it out, after following a game trail into a clearing.
