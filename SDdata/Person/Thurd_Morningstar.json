During that time, Piergeiron the Paladinson and the Lords Alliance made a call to arms seeking aid against the increased criminal and monster activity pouring out of Undermountain onto the streets of Waterdeep. Thurd Morningstar aided the hand-picked adventurers sent by Piergeiron the Paladinson, connecting them with potential new recruits."
