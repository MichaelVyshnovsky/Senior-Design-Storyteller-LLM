There, he later served as a guide to anyone who came to the town seeking his services. He was well known for an inicent in which he traveled from Yartar to Triboar in a blizzard wearing only a loincloth and boots, carrying a sword and singing loudly, to bring the news whilst Triboar was snowed-in.\nWhen Volothamp Geddarm came to Triboar to write a guidebook on the region, and about Borth, Borth was pleased and thought it would bring in business. Borth advised him to cover a well-burning fire with damp turf in order to keep it alight overnight.\nBorth was good-humored, but was prone to go berserk in a fight.\nCategoryBarbarians\nCategoryGuides\nCategoryInhabitants of Triboar\nCategoryInhabitants of the Savage Frontier\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nh9lufzn2tliw05n3gclvb5qit9arf40"
