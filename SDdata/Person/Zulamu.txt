'''Zulamu''' was a [[hunting spider katanga]] and the strongest [[archer]] who served the [[Mother of a Thousand Young]] within the [[Fire Mountain]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Like other hunting spider katanga, Zulamu possessed a [[poison|venomous]] bite and could easily scale any surface. He was equally deadly in close quarters and from a great distance.

==Possessions==
The creature was clad in [[hide armor]] and carried a large wooden [[shield]], a ''[[mighty shortbow]]'', as well as a [[shortspear]].

==History==
In the Year of Tigers Curse, Malatran calendar, late 14{{th}} century DR, the [[Wise Ones]] tribe became aware of an old foe resurfacing. The leader of the evil [[spider katanga]], the Mother of a Thousand Young, was ready to birth an army of thousand ravenous younglings. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly [[poison]]s into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Zulamu was assigned guard duties that brought him face to face with a stronger and more experienced band of heroes of the Living Jungle.

It was unknown if Zulamu survived the battle when the heroes infiltrated the katanga caverns.
