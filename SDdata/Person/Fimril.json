        "mainbody": "'''Fimril''' of [[Westgate]] was a mageling of the [[Zhentarim]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He had dark eyes and wore a black robe.",
        "Personality": "To [[Sarhthor]], like most magelings of the [[Zhentarim]], Fimril was dark-hearted and ambitious. Though he bore a spark of self-doubt, he was brave, arrogant, and indeed ambitious, believing himself capable of rising to the top of the Zhentarim, and considering that people who talked back to him in a way he disapproved of could be done without.",
        "Abilities": "Fimril was able to use a slaying spell that consumed a crushed black [[pearl]] as its [[material component]], almost certainly ''[[death spell]]''. His version of the spell, however, was strong enough to kill him and his comrades too. He had also devised a unique spell that took him an entire year to construct, which created a moving barrier of all-devouring darkness, a spell powerful enough to counter [[spellfire]].{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|107-109|6}}\n\nAnother strange power of Fimril was a very draining spell that called up images from the ashes of a fire, allowing a mage to see what had transcurred while it was burning.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|74|4}}",
        "Relationships": "He'd been either trained or tested by Sarhthor. [[Lyrkon]], [[Glondar]], and [[Duthspurn]] were both part of the squad to which he was assigned.",
        "History": "Prior to {{yearlink|1357}}, Fimril was Fimril of [[Westgate]], strongly implying he'd spent a significant amount of time in that city. He'd spent at least one year, per his own recollection, developing a spell that created an all-devouring shield of darkness, capable of stopping most spells and disintegrating most material that it went through.\n\nHe was part of a meeting in late {{yearlink|1357}}, in which Sarhthor offered several magelings of the Zhentarim the assignment to hunt down [[Shandril Shessair]] for her spellfire.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|105-106|5}}\n\nThough he captured Shandril Shessair, he used a killing spell on [[Mirt]] when the latter turned up to rescue her; the spell was reflected, slaying him."
