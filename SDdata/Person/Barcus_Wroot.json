        "History": "[[File:Barcus'_amulet.png|thumb|right|300px|''Barcus holding Wulbren's amulet, which was recovered in the Lower City.'']]\nWhen Barcus dwelt in the Underdark, he bestowed an amulet upon his good friend who planned to explore the surface world. Years later, during or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Barcus himself left the Underdark for the surface city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. \n\nWhile in the [[Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate, Barcus found Wulbren's amulet, which was covered in blood. He was however, unable to find his friend. Wroot continued to search the Western Heartlands.. He planned to head back to the Underdark to his friend's home, should his search be unsuccessful.  \n\nBarcus traveled slowly in his search across the Heartlands, weighed down by the supplies he carried in his heavy backpack. He was eventually captured by [[Fezzerk]] and his band of [[goblin]] raiders, which was associated the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. They strapped the deep gnome to a functioning windmill in the village of [[Moonhaven]]. Barcus demanded to be cut loose from the quickly rotating machine."
