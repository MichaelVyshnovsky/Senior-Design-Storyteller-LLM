'''Jalaunther Ithbreeiur''' was the unofficial but true leader of the [[Shadowmasters of Telflamm]] in [[1370 DR|1370]].

==Personality==
Jalaunther was a very ambitious man with a network of agents in all major cities in the ''[[Realms]]''. His major plot was to gain total control of Telflamm then take over [[Thesk]], [[Aglarond]], [[Great Dale]] and possibly [[Impiltur]].

==Relationships==
While not the leader of the [[House of the Master's Shadow]], the local temple of [[Mask]] in [[Uthmere]], or of the Shadowmasters, Jalaunther was the driving force behind the guild. During Jalaunther's magic research, he discovered the unique ''[[shadow walk]]'' method used by the Shadowmasters.

==History==
Under Ithbreeiur's orders, Shadowmasters defeated the pirates of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] that menaced Telflamm.
