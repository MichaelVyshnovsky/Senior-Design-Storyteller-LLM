        "mainbody": "'''Adrelgus''' was a [[Red Wizard]] who was handily slain on [[Marpenoth 17]] of the {{YearlinkName|1357}} while reaching for [[The Simbul]]. His body became clasped tightly within the [[marble]] floor of the [[Hall of Scrolls and Ledgers]] inside the [[Castle Obarskyr|Royal Palace]] of [[Cormyr]], leaving [[Vangerdahast]] quite shaken.",
        "Description": "He had a few black hairs on the back of his hand.",
        "Possessions": "At some point, he had worn several rings.",
        "Legacy": "After his death, a hand was found fused with the floor of the [[Hall of Scrolls and Ledgers]] of the Royal Palace of [[Cormyr]] on [[Marpenoth 17]]; Vangerdahast was pulled in to examine the reaching appendage, freshly dead and with many of its rings palmed away. This stumped Vangerdahast, as the wards of the room were the work of hundreds of hands, meant to be impossible to bypass through legerdemain.\n\nFlailing, Vangerdahast summoned [[Khelben Arunsun]], who, having armed some of the wards, recognized the handiwork of [[Elminster Aumar]]'s traps, pointing it must've been a [[Red Wizard]] trying to elbow in on a spot where Elminster and the [[Simbul]] liked to caress and hold hands. Vangerdahast then magically poked Elminster to turn up, but instead, a white-knuckled Simbul did. On arriving, Simbul seemed ready to rub off Vangerdahast, but soon fingered Adrelgus as the possessor of the hand instead, and thumbing her nose at the strength of the wards, single-handedly waved his remains away. This was a slap in the face to Vangerdahast, who wondered aloud if more vaults on Toril were not really so tight-fisted; his observation had its finger on the wrist of matters, which Khelben handed to him.\n\n[[Mystra]] later scratched some of Vangerdahast's memories of the event into [[Elminster]], but the [[archdevil]] [[Nergal (archdevil)|Nergal]] pinched those in {{yearlink|1372}}."
