        "mainbody": "'''\"The Lady\"''' or '''\"The Green Lady\"''' was a female [[human]] [[druid]] and follower of [[Eldath]] who lived in the [[Brynwood]] forest in [[the Vast]] in the 1350s and 1360s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Going by her age, the Lady was born around [[1289 DR]]. Both her real name and her history were unknown to others, and she was known only as the Lady or the Green Lady for many years.{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|73}}\n\nIt was known, however, that she settled in the [[Misty Vale]] in Brynwood in the Vast around [[1349 DR]], where she went into semi-retirement and lived in seclusion.\n\nOn 28th [[Eleasias]] of [[1369 DR|the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], [[Dura Gerathu]], a [[ranger]] friend of the Lady, visited her to tell how he'd discovered the [[Vipers' Nest]]. She advised him to watch the place longer and learn all he could, but this led to Dura being murdered by the [[Vipers]] bandits. The bandits followed Dura's writings and came after the Lady next. Forewarned by the [[Sprite (creature)|sprites]] she lived with, she conjured obscuring mists and illusory forests to drive the terrified bandits off. [[Calispar Delgorth]], the leader of the assault, vowed to return and finish her later.{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|72}}\n\nAfterwards, the Lady sent two sprites to check on Dura, who reported his death. At the sad news, she fell into deep mourning, not eating, sleeping, nor speaking. She waited for the Vipers to return and kill her too.As [[Dungeon magazine 75|\"Into the Nest of Vipers\"]] is an adventure module, these events are officially unresolved. Successful progress would see the PCs rouse the Lady and defeat the Vipers.",
        "Abilities": "The Lady possessed the divine [[magic]] and powers of a [[druid]], including the ability to shape-change into an animal. She used [[hallucinatory forest|illusory forests]] and [[obscurement|obscuring]] mists to defend the Misty Vale.",
        "Description": "The Lady was an elderly woman of 80 years in 1369 DR, standing only 5 feet and 4 inches (1.6 meters) tall and quite frail. Her eyes were green but faded with age, and she had long, loose iron-grey hair. She typically wore a simple home-spun brown robe.\n\nShe was a worshiper of [[Eldath]].",
        "Possessions": "She owned a white [[oak]]en ''[[staff of the woodlands]]''.",
        "Allies": "The Lady was a close friend of the ranger Dura Gerathu. She shared the vale with a clan of sprites, who served and defended her.{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}"
