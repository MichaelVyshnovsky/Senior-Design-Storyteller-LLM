        "mainbody": "ylett McGinn was a busy elven wizard member of the Sorcellers Encapsulate in Daggerford circa 1372 DR.\nRylett McGinn appeared quite youthful, but like many other elves, his mannerisms betrayed his true age and maturity. His pale skin almost made him look sickly. He was dressed in opulent wizardly robes and had long red hair.\nRylett was responsible and overworked with the guilds mundane tasks and his personal arcane research. Rylett displayed annoyance bordering with disdain towards fighters and warriors preferring the company of fellow spellcasters.\nIn 1372 DR, Rylett McGinn could often be found in the Sorcellers Encapsulates guildhalls main chambers busy with his mundane tasks while directing people to the guilds library. He did not, however, let non-wizards access the guilds arcane knowledge and felt extremely irritated with constant interruptions and requests to enroll in the school from the folk he deemed unworthy."
