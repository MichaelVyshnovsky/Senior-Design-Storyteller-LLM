        "mainbody": "'''Rylett McGinn''' was a busy [[elf|elven]] [[wizard]] member of the [[Sorceller's Encapsulate]] in [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "Rylett McGinn appeared quite youthful, but like many other elves, his mannerisms betrayed his true age and maturity. His pale skin almost made him look sickly. He was dressed in opulent wizardly [[robe]]s and had long red hair.",
        "Personality": "Rylett was responsible and overworked with the guild's mundane tasks and his personal arcane research. Rylett displayed annoyance bordering with disdain towards fighters and warriors preferring the company of fellow spellcasters.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], Rylett McGinn could often be found in the Sorceller's Encapsulate's guildhall's main chambers busy with his mundane tasks while directing people to the guild's library. He did not, however, let non-wizards access the guild's arcane knowledge and felt extremely irritated with constant interruptions and requests to enroll in the school from the folk he deemed unworthy."
