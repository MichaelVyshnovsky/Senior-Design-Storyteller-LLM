'''Nilraun Dhaerlost''' was a wizard member of the [[Zhentarim]] and an ally of the [[frost giant]]s sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==Activities==
Nilraun was always obsessed with finding the [[Ring of Winter]].

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Nilraun was captured in [[Port Llast]] by frost giant minions of Jarl [[Storvald]], who also wanted the Ring of Winter.

Nilraun offered an alliance with the frost giant jarl, believing this was his best shot at finding the Ring. Secretly, Nilraun plotted to betray Storvald after finding the [[artifact]], not knowing that Storvald also plotted to betray Nilraun.

Using his magic, Nilraun identified [[Sirac|a blood relative]] of [[Artus Cimber]], the last known owner of the Ring, living in [[Bryn Shander]].

Nilraun usually tried to remain close to the jarl but when Storvald went to hunt the mage he remained in his room in [[Svardborg]].
