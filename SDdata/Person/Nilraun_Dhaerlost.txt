Nilraun Dhaerlost was a wizard member of the Zhentarim and an ally of the frost giants sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Nilraun was always obsessed with finding the Ring of Winter.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Nilraun was captured in Port Llast by frost giant minions of Jarl Storvald, who also wanted the Ring of Winter.
Nilraun offered an alliance with the frost giant jarl, believing this was his best shot at finding the Ring. Secretly, Nilraun plotted to betray Storvald after finding the artifact, not knowing that Storvald also plotted to betray Nilraun.
Using his magic, Nilraun identified a blood relative of Artus Cimber, the last known owner of the Ring, living in Bryn Shander.
Nilraun usually tried to remain close to the jarl but when Storvald went to hunt the mage he remained in his room in Svardborg.
