        "mainbody": "Princess '''Tsenya Bhrokiti''' was the royal heir of [[Ra-Khati]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Many believed that Tsenya had many qualities that were ill-suited to a future ruler. She was willful, impetuous, and self-centered. However, she was also goodhearted and possessed an innate sense of decency.\n\nHer adventurous spirit left her despising the general sense of xenophobia that dominated the entire society of Ra-Khati.",
        "Abilities": "Tsenya had a degree of training in the martial arts and the use of magic.",
        "Relationships": "Princess Bhrokiti was the daughter of the [[Tsenya Garbo|Dalai Lama]].",
        "Activities": "Princess Bhrokiti was forbidden from leaving the [[Potala]] by her father until she assumed control of the regency.\n\nAs a practicing [[wu jen]], Tsenya was required to adhere to a particular taboo or lose her powers. As a result, she could never sleep in the same room with another person.",
        "History": "Tsenya cared little for the spiritual aspects that controlled much of society within Ra-Khati. Much of this arose from the fact that her mother died during her birth, leaving her to be raised by the palace staff, who often over-indulged her to the point of spoiling the young princess."
