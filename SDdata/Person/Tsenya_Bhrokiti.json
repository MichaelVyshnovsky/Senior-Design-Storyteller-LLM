        "mainbody": "Princess Tsenya Bhrokiti was the royal heir of Ra-Khati during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nMany believed that Tsenya had many qualities that were ill-suited to a future ruler. She was willful, impetuous, and self-centered. However, she was also goodhearted and possessed an innate sense of decency.\nHer adventurous spirit left her despising the general sense of xenophobia that dominated the entire society of Ra-Khati.\nTsenya had a degree of training in the martial arts and the use of magic.\nPrincess Bhrokiti was the daughter of the Dalai Lama.\nPrincess Bhrokiti was forbidden from leaving the Potala by her father until she assumed control of the regency.\nAs a practicing wu jen, Tsenya was required to adhere to a particular taboo or lose her powers. As a result, she could never sleep in the same room with another person.\nTsenya cared little for the spiritual aspects that controlled much of society within Ra-Khati. Much of this arose from the fact that her mother died during her birth, leaving her to be raised by the palace staff, who often over-indulged her to the point of spoiling the young princess."
