        "History": "The kuo-toa led by [[Noolgaloop]] were lured by [[Halaster]] to a place where an [[otyugh]] had lived until the Mad Mage petrified it. As planned by Halaster, the kuo-toa started to worship the petrified otyugh, which Noolgaloop identified as a god called [[Bulba-Slopp]].\n\nIn [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} the aboleth Illuun arrived with its [[chuul]] and [[troglodyte]] thralls. Illuun decided to settle in the area and started to mentally enslave the kuo-toa, gaining control of the grotto. Then the aboleth transformed the grotto into a den and lived there.",
        "Activities": "Illuun usually resided inside a grotto together with two chuul thralls and used a magical projection in order to deal with visitors.",
        "Personality": "Illuun wanted more slaves for its growing empire. It had had bad dealings with adventurers in past and feared them."
