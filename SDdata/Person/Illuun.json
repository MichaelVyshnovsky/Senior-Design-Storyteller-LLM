        "mainbody": "Illuun was an aboleth in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.\nThe kuo-toa led by Noolgaloop were lured by Halaster to a place where an otyugh had lived until the Mad Mage petrified it. As planned by Halaster, the kuo-toa started to worship the petrified otyugh, which Noolgaloop identified as a god called Bulba-Slopp.\nIn 1492 DR, the aboleth Illuun arrived with its chuul and troglodyte thralls. Illuun decided to settle in the area and started to mentally enslave the kuo-toa, gaining control of the grotto. Then the aboleth transformed the grotto into a den and lived there.\nIlluun usually resided inside a grotto together with two chuul thralls and used a magical projection in order to deal with visitors.\nIlluun wanted more slaves for its growing empire. It had had bad dealings with adventurers in past and feared them."
