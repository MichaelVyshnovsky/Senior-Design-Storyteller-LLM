She was a capable ranger and was promoted to lead the Serrat scouts.",
        "Description": "Although she was yuan-ti, because she was a pureblood she appeared human in nearly all respects.

        "History": {
            "Early Life": "Zaltys was born into a small yuan-ti tribe residing in a ruined city in the jungles of Southern [[Faer√ªn]].  While still an infant, a decision was made by the low priest to sacrifice her to the tribe's anathema.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|149}}  Immediately prior to the sacrifice, the tribe was attacked by [[derro]] [[slavery|slavers]] from the [[Underdark]] and Zaltys was left lying in the jungle vegetation.

            "1479 DR": "In the summer of her 17th year, Zaltys was working as a scout for the terazul harvesters when a guard named [[Rainer]] who had been lost and presumed dead for the past seventeen years stumbled into camp.  He told a story of his capture and imprisonment in the Underdark by the derro.  This led Zaltys to believe that her clan, which she still believed to be human, had been enslaved rather than massacred. Zaltys investigated the supposed grave pit in the yuan-ti village and found it was actually a rock cover over an entrance to the Underdark and she decided to descend to the Underdark to find her tribe.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|1405}}\n\nHer cousin, [[Julen Serrat|Julen]] joined her on her expedition but he was captured by derro shortly after entering the Underdark.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|1557}}  Zaltys sent a psychic sending to Krailash using her magic ring and Krailash, her mother and a hand full of guards followed her into the Underdark.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|1733}}\n\nThe Serrat party, with the exception of Krailash and Alaia, were slaughtered by [[swordwing]]s.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|2122}}  Meanwhile, Julen managed to escape from his derro captors and was found by Zaltys.  They managed to find the derro settlement and were given an audience with the derro leader, the [[Iraska|Slime King]] who was actually an yuan-ti pureblood named Iraska.  She revealed that she was actually Zaltys great-great-grandmother or possibly great-great-aunt.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|2827}}\n\nJulen attacked Iraska, and he and Zaltys freed the slaves from the pens.  Krailash and Alaia arrived in the derro settlement at this time and Krailash sacrificed his life to close the portal to the [[Far Realm]] which the derro had opened.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|3605}}  The group escaped to the surface and Zaltys, Julen and Glory left on a trip to [[Tymanther]] to given an account of Krailash's death to his [[dragonborn]] relatives.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|3842}}"
