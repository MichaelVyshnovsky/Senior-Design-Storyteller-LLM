'''Delban''', also known as the '''Star of Ice and Hate''', was a star-like [[Elder Evil]] from the [[Far Realm]] who had taken a place among stars of [[Realmspace]]. Unlike normal stars, Delban didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.

== Description ==
Delban was an ice white star.

==History==
Delban, like the other Far Realm-infested stars of Realmspace, was somehow related to the [[Eldest]].

Delban was usually visible only in winter, but sometimes it shone without reason in any other seasons, surprising scholars who studied stars.{{Cite dragon/366/Wish Upon a Star|18}} Of all the Far Realm-infested stars, Delban was the most cruel and bitter.

Delban was one of the stars the [[warlock]] [[Japheth Donard]] sought out in [[1396 DR]], after having lost his pact with the [[archfey]] [[Neifion]].

Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a vestige of Delban's power had found its way into the domain of [[Demiplane of Dread#Barovia|Barovia]] in the [[Shadowfell]], where it offered pacts with creatures who approached it. To those few Delban bestowed the gift of controlling [[magic]]al cold, giving them the ability to use the ''[[cone of cold]]'' spell up to seven times, as well as temporary resistance to magical cold and low temperatures. Even non-[[warlock]]s could be granted this ability from the star. Those who were granted the gifts of Delban, however, became terrified of [[fire]].
