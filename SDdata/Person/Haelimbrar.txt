'''Haelimbrar''' was a [[Triadic knight]] and one of the [[Knights of Imphras II]] in [[1374 DR]].

==Activities==
Haelimbrar was one of the [[Council of Lords (Laviguer)|Council of Lords]], based in [[Laviguer]]. He was a War-Captain charged with securing the northern and western borders of the realm, a patrol route that became known as [[Haelimbrar's Watch]], but was often away on secret missions.

==Possessions==
Among his belongings were a ''+2 [[full plate]]'', a ''+1 [[heavy shield|heavy]] [[steel]] [[shield]]'' and a pair of  ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]''.

==History==
In [[1359 DR]] he disguised had joined the [[Twilight Riders]] of [[Damara]] in order to spy [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], and generally reported favorable impressions back to his fellow Lords.

Haelimbrar performed a series of other missions in disguise for the Lords. In 1374 DR, he was disguised as the lost [[Imphras V]], and posed as a squire at the court of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] in Damara.

After the crowning of King [[Imbrar II]], Haelimbrar, alongside [[Simgar]], was one of the few battle-hardened veterans of the kingdom. They cared little for diplomacy and power and rather focused on training the [[Warswords of Impiltur]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|64}}
