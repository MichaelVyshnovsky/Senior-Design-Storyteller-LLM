        "mainbody": "'''Old Bess''' was a soft-spoken jolly middle-aged woman infamous across the coastal areas of [[Faer√ªn]] for her blood-soaked pirating career in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|Wot'll ye be havin' now, dearie? Will it be a [[fish]] [[knife]] through yer gizzard, or will ye be having a sit-down on the business end of a [[pike (weapon)|pike]]?''|[[Tzigone]], imitating Old Bess}}",
        "Description": "Old Bess was a plump older apple-cheeked woman with a cheerful demeanor and could easily be mistaken for an aging, kindly milkmaid. She had naturally pale skin, roughened and darkened by the sea sun, and red hair.",
        "History": "Old Bess was active in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR and by the {{YearlinkName|1370}} was famous for her successful and bloody career as one of the most ruthless and deadly pirates that had ever sailed across the [[Great Sea]]. She was believed to be a [[Northlander]] from the [[Moonshae Isles]] due to her telltale [[Common]] language accentuated by a heavy Moonshavian drawl.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Old Bess fell ill with a high fever and spent a summer recovering at the [[Jordaini College]] in [[Halruaa]]. Customarily for the jordaini, criminals and foreigners were often taken to [[House Jordain]] to give the College's students hands-on training and demonstrations of the non-magical healing arts. Despite all predictions, the Old Shark survived and insisted on paying back her saviors. Old Bess spent her time at the college teaching young jordaini navigation, tides, currents, and entertained the youths with tales of battles. The stories were the most popular subject among the youths."
