        "mainbody": "'''Orvustia Esseren''' was a guard on the [[Sword Coast]] just before the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].",
        "Personality": "The guard was smart, tough, and talented with her [[bow]] and [[spear]] but knew nothing of the ''[[Realms]]'' outside her homeland.",
        "History": "Around [[1489 DR]], Orvustia followed the advice of her aunt and left her home on a farm near [[Baldur's Gate]] to see the world. She found work as a guard for a great caravan that, unknown to her, was full of [[Cult of the Dragon]] agents transporting treasures for the [[Hoard of the Dragon Queen]]."
