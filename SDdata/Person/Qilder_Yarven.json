        "Personality": "Knowing his own magic to be weak, Qilder Yarven preferred instead to strike first with his wands at every opportunity.",
        "Possessions": "He possessed at least seven [[wand]]s which he used for attack.",
        "History": "Originally Holbert Gruth, Qilder Yarven was an apprentice to the archmage [[Maermadrar]] of [[Sheirtalar]], until he stole two spellbooks and a coffer full of [[wand]]s. He came up with the name by combining the names of two warriors in a tavern he stopped at during his desperate flight. He hid in the [[Border Kingdoms]] for some time, always striking first at mages he encountered. He continued in this habit until [[Elminster]] practically made him [[Magister]] by placing him in the middle of the fight between [[Scsilda Starshield]] and [[Orten Imdrar]], whom the apprentice managed to slay with some help.\n\nAs the Magister, he challenged a few archmages, emboldened by his power. He succeeded twice; his third challenge, [[Maldiglas Turntower]], turned out to be more powerful than he could handle. He lost that duel, and his life."
