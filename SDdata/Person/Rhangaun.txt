Rhangaun was a male lich and a senior member of the Twisted Rune.
Dead for more than a thousand years, he was little more than a skeleton with glowing eyes.
He owned a staff of the magi.
In his mortal life, Rhangaun of Almraiven was hired to kill Cauln Aumar of Athalantar in 217 DR.
Forced into the Twisted Rune because Rysellan possessed his phylactery, Rhangaun took control after the founderâ€™s death.
