{{quote|''Perhaps I will find my way back here one day and I will put a stop to your slavery once and for all.''|Thazienne Uskevren to Szass Tam}}

==Description==
Thazienne's right wrist was scarred by a [[dog]] attack that happened when she was a child. She kept the wound a secret until it got infected. Her mother, [[Shamur Uskevren]], asked the healer to leave the scar as a reminder of Tazi's foolishness.

In [[1373 DR]], she received a mark of [[Szass Tam]] on her left shoulder, the symbol of interlocking arms, one human and one skeletal. The mark bore magic that gave Tazi the ability to lead an army of [[juju zombie]]s.<ref> The magic tattoo was damaged in the following battle with [[Eltab]] and remained on her faded to almost a smudge.

==Personality==
She was a highly spirited individual who enjoyed living a dangerous life. 

==Relationships==
She was the sister of [[Thamalon Uskevren II]] and [[Talbot Uskevren]], and half-sister of [[Larajin]] and [[Leifander]] through her father.

[[Erevis Cale]] was once in love with her but she remained unaware of it until much later.<ref> She often associated, without the knowledge of her family, with individuals in the underworld of [[Selgaunt]].

==Abilities==
Thazienne was naturally apt at breaking in wild [[horse]]s. She joined her brothers in taming wild beasts, common practice among Sembian nobility, as soon as she was old enough to ride a steed.

For a period of time, Thazienne's abilities were enhanced for her to seize control of an army of [[blooded ones]]. She survived the ritual that increased her strength, agility, given her somewhat feral rage, and granted her innate knowledge of the [[orcish]] language.
