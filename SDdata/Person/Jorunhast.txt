Jorunhast was the High Wizard of Cormyr in the early 11 to later 13 centuries DR. He was the pupil of Thanderahast and killed the regent Salember Obarskyr in 1286 DR, for which he was known as Jorunhast Kingslayer. In exile afterward, he built the Tower of Stars on Traitors Isle. Later in life, he settled in Ser么s and joined the Dukars.
Around 1018 DR, he was broad-shouldered and muscular, a handsome man to the opposite gender. By 1188 DR, Jorunhast was still broad-shouldered and handsome, with his great age barely apparent, but he had grown fat around the waist. He thought of himself as looking like a baker or Lathanderite friar. As of 1227 DR, his stomach now hung over his belt. At the time, he donned expensive robes of vivid red and black, with a mages sigil embroidered in gold thread on the breast.
As an apprentice wizard, Jorunhast fought against the red dragons who invaded Suzail in the . He rescued a young lady from a window in the burning Castle Obarskyr, but he fell out of favor with Prince Azoun II, who had been courting her. Jorunhast pursued the black dragon Thauglor and battled him in the Kings Forest. Although Jorunhast panicked when faced with Thauglor and tried to prevent Azoun from attacking before the prince laid the decisive blow, Azoun forgave him and the pair were subsequently on better terms.
When King Azoun III died in the , Prince Rhigaerd was only six years old, so Azoun IIIs brother Salember Obarskyr took the throne of Cormyr as regent. However in the , Salember plotted to kill Rhigaerd and take the throne, leading Cormyr into civil war. During a parlay, Salember attacked Rhigaerd but Royal Magician Jorunhast stepped in and slew the regent. From then on, he was known as Jorunhast Kingslayer. Jorunhasts choice made Rhigaerd disband the Royal Magician position until the , when the king appointed Vangerdahast.
After his exile, Jorunnhast settled in Ser么s and joined the Dukars as their Kupavi lorekeeper with loyalty to Gayar. After the Twelfth Ser么s War in the , he was granted a seat on the Nantarn Council,
As of 1371 DR, Jorunhasts sealed Tower of Stars still existed on Traitors Isle, an island in Prespur on the Sea of Fallen Stars.
Jorunhast worshiped Mystra.
