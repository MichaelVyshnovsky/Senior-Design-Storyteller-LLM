        "Personality": "Mad Maggie on the surface acted as a gentle grandmother but in truth she was a cruel and scheming individual. She had become obsessed with [[Zariel]]'s story as she had a great interest in the corruption of valiant souls.",
        "History": "Mad Maggie went to Avernus in search of the ultimate misery. There she found a piece of a tapestry that chronicled the history and the fall of [[Zariel]]. Wanting to know more, Mad Maggie searched all over the plane for many years for more pieces of the tapestry. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}{{BG-DiA-time}}, Mad Maggie may have met the [[hollyphant]] [[Lulu]], who inside her fractured memory knew all about Zariel.",
        "Relationships": "Mad Maggie ruled over the Knucklebones Gang, comprising many [[fey]] creatures, a collection of [[redcap]]s, her [[fiendish flesh golem]] [[Mickey]], the [[kenku]] [[Chukka]] and [[Clonk]], a pair of [[imp]]s, and a [[flameskull]]."
