'''Orox''' was a [[beholder]] ally of the Orthodox [[Church of Bane]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Orox was a beholder supporting the [[High lmperceptor of Bane]] of [[Mulmaster]].

In 1357 DR, hidden in a crate, Orox went to [[Zhentil Keep]] to help Inquisitor [[Ginali]] to kill the non-Orthodox [[Fzoul Chembryl]].

Orox tried to kill Fzoul while the latter was busy with the adventuring party possessing the [[Azure Bonds]] but was defeated.

On [[Uktar 18]] of [[1369 DR]], Mulmaster was attacked by a band of [[beholder]]s led by Fzoul Chembryl, [[Desmonda]], and [[Manxam]], killing Orox and over half the followers of Cyric in the city.
