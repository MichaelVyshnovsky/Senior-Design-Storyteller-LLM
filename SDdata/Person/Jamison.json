He was a regular customer of the Inn of the Clowns and had good connections with the woodmen. However, in truth, he was a bandit spy.\nIn 1357 DR, when Gareth Dragonsbanes party arrived at the village, Jamison tried to gather as much information about the adventurers as possible. That night, he went out of the village to send a falcon with a report about the adventurers to the Grandfather of Assassins. In answer, the Grandfather ordered Jamison to kill the adventurers."
