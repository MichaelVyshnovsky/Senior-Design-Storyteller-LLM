Satcheera was one of the few survivors.\nAfter that, Satcheera and the others chose to retire, but rather than return together to the House of the Key where theyd been happy together, they went their separate ways, to Berdusk, Neverwinter and Waterdeep. They never returned to Tavilar.\nHearing that adventurers began poked through the ruins of the House of the Key searching for treasure and turning up nothing, Satcheera remarked \"Still haven’t found our jewels? They must be looking in far too dry a place!\"\nGrowing elderly, she was the last survivor of the Turning Key, and passed away some time before 1370 DR.\nCategoryAdventurers\nCategoryMembers of the Turning Key\nCategoryBards\nCategoryInhabitants of Tavilar\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vast\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\n7y1l2bxlttwn6zibzs3nf76vtnhieea"
