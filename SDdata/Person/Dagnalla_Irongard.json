        "mainbody": "Dagnalla Irongard was a powerful wizard and ex-adventurer who retired to live in Yhaunn in the mid-14 century DR when she married into the Thingoleir family.\nDagnalla was an experienced and cunning wizard who enjoyed drinking, adventuring, and dueling.\nDagnalla was married to Strasus Thingoleir and mother of Malia, Roderio and Keph, mother-in-law to Krin Foxrun, and grandmother of Adrey. She had a deep love and respect for Strasus, who she enjoyed having mage duels with.\nAlthough she loved her children, her relationship with Keph was strained as he had no magical ability and he came to resent her and the rest of the wizarding family.\nShe earned friendships with a great deal of dwarves during her adventuring years, and they would come visit her in Yhaunn for drinks.\nDagnall was born in the rural country north-east of Waterdeep and became an adventuring mage after completing her apprenticeship. During her wanderings, she came into repeated conflict with the rival adventurer Strasus the Bold, but their rivalry eventually turned into affection. They adventured together for a time before retiring to Yhaunn and starting a family at Fourstaves House.\nIn Eleasis of 1373 DR, she provided immediate life-saving aid to her son Roderio after his accidental maiming by Keph.\nThat same month, she participated in her familys unsuccessful study of The Leaves of One Night."
