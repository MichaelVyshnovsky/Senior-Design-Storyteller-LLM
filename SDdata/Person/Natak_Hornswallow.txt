'''Natak Hornswallow''' was a merchant of [[Amn]] and a member of the [[Knights of the Shield]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Natak was a rug merchant with few contact outside his hometown of [[Athkatla]], so his invitation to join the Knights was a surprise to many. Natak used the Knights' connections to enlarge his business with the dream to someday establish the mercantile [[House Hornswallow]] as one of the premier families of the city. The truth, known to a few, was that Natak was the last illegitimate offspring of lord [[Piirlon]] of [[Zazesspur]], who died during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Ten Black Days of Eleint|Days of Terror]], and Natak had inherited his position in the Knights from him. [[House Piirlon]] was the family of Queen [[Rhinda]], making him the illegitimate cousin of king [[Haedrak Rhindaun III]].
