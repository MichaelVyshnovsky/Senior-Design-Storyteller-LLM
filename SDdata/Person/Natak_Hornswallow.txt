Natak Hornswallow was a merchant of Amn and a member of the Knights of the Shield in 1370 DR.
Natak was a rug merchant with few contact outside his hometown of Athkatla, so his invitation to join the Knights was a surprise to many. Natak used the Knights connections to enlarge his business with the dream to someday establish the mercantile House Hornswallow as one of the premier families of the city. The truth, known to a few, was that Natak was the last illegitimate offspring of lord Piirlon of Zazesspur, who died during the Days of Terror, and Natak had inherited his position in the Knights from him. House Piirlon was the family of Queen Rhinda, making him the illegitimate cousin of king Haedrak Rhindaun III.
