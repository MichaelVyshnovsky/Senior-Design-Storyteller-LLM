        "mainbody": "irdir was an inhabitant of Athkatla who became a victim of adduction in the late 14 century DR.\nTirdir was a human man with light skin and light brown hair.\nIn the , Tirdir fell victim to Am-Si and his cronies Camitis and Reti, who began kidnapping and extortion racket in Baldurs Gate. Tirdir was kept hostage until his family paid the ransom, after which Am-Si knocked the man out and buried him in a freshly dug grave in Athkatlas Grave District. Sethle, a gravedigger, was on Am-Sis payroll and allowed the criminals to dispose of the abductees, never to be found. By chance, Tirdir was found, and his life was saved. He was able to give the investigators some clues about who was responsible for the crime, along with a piece of red cloth ripped from the kidnappers clothes. The victim was terrified for his and his familys lives as the kidnappers would return with a vengeance if Tirdirs survival were known. The undertaker was interrogated, and the adventurers eventually discovered the perpetrators hideout in the Bridge District, rescuing another abductee â€“ Lady Elgea, and reportedly, ending their heinous crimes once and for all."
