Darlisan the Rover was a guide and huntsman in Vaasa in the late 15 century DR. He was one of the best hunters in Vaasa as of 1480 DR.
Darlisan was both a superb hunter and an infallible tracker. He worked guiding caravans and collecting bounties, but usually he preferred to hunt monsters in the Bleak Steppes of Haatar-Baen.
Darlisan was a man of few words. His prized possession was an ivory longbow that he had named "Loxodonta."
