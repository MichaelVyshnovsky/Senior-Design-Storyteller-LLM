        "mainbody": "ldenar Uldinath was a human swordsmith of the town of Triboar in the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was the owner of the Uldinaths Arms smithy.\nAlthough a swordsmith by trade, Aldenar produced an impressive range of high-quality smithwork of all kinds that were sold in shops found all over the North and along the Sword Coast. His eyebolts, latches, nails, and pins supported Wainwrights Wagons and all Triboars wainwrights in their success. Though the prices were slightly cheaper than normal, the metal and workmanship were to a higher standard.\nHe maintained a friendly rivalry with fellow smith Ghelryn Foehammer, owner of Foehammers Forge, which was situated across from the road from Uldinaths Arms. This carried on to his great-granddaughter, Harriet Uldinath."
