        "mainbody": "'''Aldenar Uldinath''' was a [[human]] swordsmith of the town of [[Triboar]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the owner of the [[Uldinath's Arms]] smithy.",
        "Activities": "Although a swordsmith by trade, Aldenar produced an impressive range of high-quality smithwork of all kinds that were sold in shops found all over [[the North]] and along the [[Sword Coast]]. His eyebolts, latches, nails, and pins supported [[Wainwright's Wagons]] and all Triboar's wainwrights in their success. Though the prices were slightly cheaper than normal, the metal and workmanship were to a higher standard.",
        "Relationships": "He maintained a friendly rivalry with fellow smith [[Ghelryn Foehammer]], owner of [[Foehammer's Forge]], which was situated across from the road from Uldinath's Arms. This carried on to his great-granddaughter, [[Harriet Uldinath]]."
