        "mainbody": "olvin Rowander was a somewhat successful Undermountain delver active in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nColvin Rowander was a part of Tolem Grandelwoods adventuring party in 1370 DR.\nIn 1370 DR, Colvin could often be found adventuring within Undermountain. He and his adventuring party visited the Garden of the Drow, where they left a note for future adventurers warning them of a possible drow ambush spot ahead. They also penetrated the Tomb of Ankh-Kephra and managed to survive its deadly traps, empty one of the treasure vaults, and leave a smarmy note to the future adventurers. At one point, Colvin saved the lives of his party members and Tolem Grandelwood during their visit to the Undermountain temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard overrun by undead dwarves."
