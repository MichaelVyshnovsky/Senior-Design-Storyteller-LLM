        "mainbody": "'''Colvin Rowander''' was a somewhat successful [[Undermountain]] delver active in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "Colvin Rowander was a part of [[Tolem Grandelwood]]'s adventuring party in 1370 DR.",
        "History": "In [[1370 DR]], Colvin could often be found adventuring within Undermountain. He and his adventuring party visited the [[Garden of the Drow]], where they left a note for future adventurers warning them of a possible [[drow]] ambush spot ahead. They also penetrated the [[Tomb of Ankh-Kephra]] and managed to survive its deadly traps, empty one of the treasure vaults, and leave a smarmy note to the future adventurers. At one point, Colvin saved the lives of his party members and Tolem Grandelwood during their visit to the Undermountain temple of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] overrun by [[undead]] dwarves."
