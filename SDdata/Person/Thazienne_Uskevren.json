        "mainbody": "Thazienne Uskevren was the daughter and second child of Thamalon Uskevren.\nThaziennes right wrist was scarred by a dog attack that happened when she was a child. She kept the wound a secret until it got infected. Her mother, Shamur Uskevren, asked the healer to leave the scar as a reminder of Tazis foolishness.\nIn 1373 DR, she received a mark of Szass Tam on her left shoulder, the symbol of interlocking arms, one human and one skeletal. The mark bore magic that gave Tazi the ability to lead an army of juju zombies. The magic tattoo was damaged in the following battle with Eltab and remained on her faded to almost a smudge.\nShe was a highly spirited individual who enjoyed living a dangerous life. \nShe was the sister of Thamalon Uskevren II and Talbot Uskevren, and half-sister of Larajin and Leifander through her father.\nErevis Cale was once in love with her but she remained unaware of it until much later. She often associated, without the knowledge of her family, with individuals in the underworld of Selgaunt.\nThazienne was naturally apt at breaking in wild horses. She joined her brothers in taming wild beasts, common practice among Sembian nobility, as soon as she was old enough to ride a steed.\nFor a period of time, Thaziennes abilities were enhanced for her to seize control of an army of blooded ones. She survived the ritual that increased her strength, agility, given her somewhat feral rage, and granted her innate knowledge of the orcish language."
