Berenn was a fire giant cleric and a servant of the Bhaalspawn, Yaga-Shura.
Berenn owned many gems such as emeralds and pearls. He, if not spellcasting, fought with a weakly enchanted two-handed sword. The fire giant cleric also owned a balors claw, which could be combined with another item to create a powerful artifact.
When Gorions Ward and group entered the second level of the fire giant temple in the Forest of Mir, Berenn noticed them. He let the other giants know that intruders had entered the "sacred" temple and shouted that the fire of his master could never be extinguished. He may have been slain by Gorions Ward.
