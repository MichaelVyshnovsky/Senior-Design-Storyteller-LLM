{{quote|Either watch, or leave.|Antinia the Goon}}

==Description==
Antinia was a [[human]] woman with a light skin tone, black eyes, and long straight black hair gathered in a ponytail. She was a proficient [[fighter]] who wore a simple [[breastplate]] and armed herself with two [[axe]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, was part of the same gang with [[Gal Vharranne]], [[Churg Elvek]], [[Dart Dirtwood]], [[Imprudence]], [[Nobster]], and [[Ormo]] who could be found in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate near the docks where the [[Steel Watch Foundry]] and [[Water Queen's House]] stood. Unbeknownst to most, her gang's leader, Churg, was a [[True Soul]], an individual implanted with an [[illithid]] tadpole that indoctrinated him into serving [[the Absolute]]. Under the [[Cult of the Absolute]]'s bidding, Antinia and her gang captured the famed writer and traveler [[Volothamp Geddarm]] and set to publically execute him for spreading "lies and conspiracies" â€“ talking about the Cult. The gang was confronted by the [[Absolute Adversaries]], who attempted to save the master thespian. It was unknown if Antinia and her gang survived the encounter.
