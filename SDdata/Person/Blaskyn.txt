'''Blaskyn''' was the apprentice of [[Laeral Rythkyn]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|242|16}} He betrayed her to get at ''[[Thalon's Throne]]'', but the artifact instead rendered him into the lich's host.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|255-258|17}}

==Personality==
He had an easy grin.

==Abilities==
At least one of his spells could cause rocks to fall from the ceiling, and he was very good at blasting spells.

He also had some means to follow someone who had teleported, whether through scrolls or spells, as he joined his teacher subreptitiously after she teleported.

==Possessions==
Laeral gave him the ''[[Helm of Hiding]]'' shortly before his death. He took many of Laeral's items after she was pinned by a rockfall.

==Activities==
As of mid-Kythorn of {{yearlink|1357}}, he was the apprentice of Laeral Rythkyn. He was almost ready: his final task before completing his apprenticeship had been to create a spell on his own.

==Relationships==
Per [[Thalon]], he fancied Laeral,{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|259|17}} his tutor in the Art.

==History==
As of {{yearlink|1357}}, Blaskyn had been the apprentice of Laeral Rythkyn for years. In mid-[[Kythorn]] of that year, she departed to find ''[[Thalon's Throne]]'', leaving him to watch over her home with the ''helm of hiding''. However, unknown to Laeral, he followed her; after she defeated the lich guarding ''[[Thalon's Throne]]'', he ambushed her with a rockfall and then filched many of her magical items while she was still alive. He also sat on the throne himself; unknown to him, it turned him into the undead host to [[Thalon]]'s malign intelligence.
