'''Tarman the Old''' was the Emir of [[Skalnaedyr|Phannaskul]] during the mid–14th century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Sadly, Tarman spent most of his time reliving his glory days as a warrior instead of actually administering the city. The various merchant guilds of the city made every important decision in his absence.
