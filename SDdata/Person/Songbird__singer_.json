        "mainbody": "The '''Songbird''' was the stage-name of a talented [[half-elf]] singer and actor popular in [[Turmish]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "She was known for her incredible beauty and grace.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Songbird was drawing audiences with her new cycle of ballads revolving around the mythical [[Princess Arissaea]]. However, after every show, a few people who were in her audience were found to have vanished. Those who investigated could find no cause, no connection between them, and no common elementâ€”not gender, not occupation, not place of residence, and not fortune, though as some of the missing persons to heirs to wealthy families and merchant companies, attention increased. The Songbird was interviewed; she insisted she had no idea what was behind it, although, strangely, [[divination]] magic did not appear to work on her. Authorities hired [[adventurer]]s to search for the missing persons and for those behind them."
