        "mainbody": "'''Redeye''' was the [[shaman]] chief of a [[lizardfolk]] megatribe",
        "Description": "Redeye was the largest among the lizardfolk. One menacing yellow tooth stuffed out from under slime-covered lips and hooked up towards his snout.\n\nRed color was the most prominent feature of Redeye's tribe. His scouts were heavily armed and were armored in red-dyed [[baldric]]s of pelts.",
        "Possessions": "The leader of the red-fur tribe carried an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[mace]], as well as a [[shield]] and [[javelin]]s.\n\nAmong some of the divine spells Redeye had access to were: ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[protection from evil]]'', ''[[resist fear]]'', ''[[augury]]'', ''[[chant]]'', ''[[snake charm]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[remove curse]]'', and ''[[tongues]]''.",
        "Abilities": "Redeye possessed impressive magical abilities for a lizardman and used them to gather a sizable following among the inhabitants of the Lizard Marsh.",
        "Relationships": "The megatribe under Redeye's rule constantly feuded over leadership and land with other smaller lizardmen communities of the Lizard Marsh.\n\nRedeye and his kin bore no ill will with the nearby [[Blue Feather (lizardfolk)|Blue Feather]] clan, but was willing to aid [[human]]s wronged by the Blue Feathers in order to avoid open conflict with Daggerford. Eventually, the tensions between two tribes lead to open conflicts.\n\nLizardfolk of the Lizard Marsh, including Redeye's tribe were quite advanced among other lizardmen communities. They used metal armor and weapons, domesticated various [[dinosaur]]s, and traded goods and slaves with various intelligent aquatic races of the [[Sea of Swords]].\n\n[[Amiskal]]'s great tribe had little contact with Redeye's lizardfolk but traded them [[razortalon]] eggs for raising and training, to little successes.",
        "History": "Sometime before or in early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of heroes ventured into the Lizard Marsh and allegedly slew Redeye. However by [[1357 DR]], Redeye was back and considered to be an ancient witch doctor and leader who strives to unite the lizardfolk tribes of the marsh under his leadership. Around that time, Redeye attempted several times to trade rare swamp [[bird]] feathers and local delicacies for metal weapons with the neighboring city of [[Daggerford]]. The trade offer was shut down by the city's [[Council of Guilds]] as Redeye was considered an old foe. It was estimated that about half of the lizardfolk of the marsh were following Redeye during that period.\n\nIn 1357 DR, a group of adventurers from Daggerford ventured into the Lizard Marsh following a lizardfolk raid on [[Cromm's Hold]]. Redeye's scouts spotted the possible invaders and the old witch doctor assembled a squad to contact the visitors. The hero knew that Redeye's tribe vas not responsible for the raid as the attackers wore blue colors. However, it was unknown if the adventurers entered conflict with Redeye and his agents or befriended the creature. Redeye was known to peacefully negotiate with travelers who were not aggressive towards his tribe. Occasionally, he offered rewards to adventurers for minor tasks such as exterminating a flock of [[pteranodon]]s or hunting down medicinal [[herb]]s to help stave off an epidemic of [[swamp fever]].\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], it was widely believed that Redeye who led the lizard tribes of the marsh was a [[lich]] who returned after being slain by adventurers decades earlier. The strange undead lizardman attracted the attention of various arcane organizations, both good and evil who wanted to discover the ruth behind Redeye's transformation. Around the same time Redeye and his impressive lizardfolk force threatened the city of Daggerford, demanding a payment of 10,000 [[gold]] [[coin|pieces]] from [[Pwyll Daggerford|Duke Daggerford]] annually or face war. Pwyll \"Greatshout\" Daggerford hired three bands of adventurers to confront the lizardman lich.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], Redeye came to conflict with yet another lizardfolk tribe in the Lizard Marsh. Chieftain [[Saslick]] was the lich's next target after splintering from Redeye's megatribe. However, the rival tribe was under the protection of an ancient [[black dragon]] [[Thuraskulusk]] whom they worshiped as a deity. Redeye hatched a clever plan. He stole one of the black dragon's eggs and offered a trade to a wandering [[Hero of Daggerford]] who was investigating suspicious activities surrounding the \"death\" of Pwyll Greatshout. The lizardman offered the Hero several magic items fished out of the swamps and information on a swelling hellish [[tanarukk]]a forces menacing Daggerford. In exchange, the Hero was to sneak into Saslick's hut and hide the egg there, framing the dragon's ally for the theft. Subsequently, the Hero was successful with the aid of the [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]] and her ''[[polymorph]]'' sorcery. Furious Thuraskulusk tracked the eggs back to Saslick's hut, killing the chieftain where he stood. With the dragon's protection gone, Redeye reclaimed the tribe."
