A temple guard was one of those hired to defend the new Temple of Mystra in Wheloon, Cormyr, in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR.
The temple guards patrolled the walls around the temple and stood watch in the outer courtyard and middle temple areas. Some were also responsible for feeding and managing petitioners undergoing the Mystras Sacred Trust rite and for maintaining the middle temple. Told to ignore strange noises, they remained oblivious to the true activities of the inner temple.
The guards bunked in a guard post located just outside the temple, where they spent their off-hours drinking and gambling.
Some temple guards appeared to have been recruited from the Wheloon Jail, those who chose to repent and perform holy service in exchange for their sentences being commuted. Most trusted to the priests, and some were pious followers of Mystra, ready to risk their lives for the temple.
Guards who proved especially obedient, unquestioning, and uncurious were promoted to duties deeper in the temple. Those who were especially obedient and pious and underwent Mystras Sacred Trust themselves were made into shadow guards.
The temple guards wielded longbow and longsword, and wore scale mail armor.
