Baldassar was a human fighter who was the guard captain for a village in Icewind Dale in the mid–14 century DR.
Baldassar was a loyal guard captain that fought with a blue shield and a longsword. He had light brown hair and a large moustache. He wore a grey-brown leather jerkin with brown trousers, boots and a mantle.
In the 14 century DR, a contingent of drow raided a village in Icewind Dale in search of Drizzt DoUrden. Baldassar and his men fought off many dark elves, leaving him injured. They did what they could to protect the guardhouse, but did not have the manpower to put out the fires that spread around the village. In particular, the store house was burning quickly—in there contained the supplies needed for surviving the harsh winters of the region. He was found a couple of local adventurers, who were also his good friends, outside the guardhouse, and tasked them with putting out the raging fires. Although Drizzt lived nearby the village, Baldassar did not believe that the renegade dark elf was responsible for the razing of his village. He advised the adventurers to seek out Vermulean the wise druid, as he lived far enough away that his home was likely not razed.
He may have chosen to join his friends to Menzoberranzan as a companion.
