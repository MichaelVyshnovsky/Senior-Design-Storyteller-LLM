        "mainbody": "'''Brother Delf''' was a priest of the god [[Deneir]] the Scribe, who lived at a monastery near [[Verdusk]].\n\nBrother Delf once wrote a document recounting the origins of various magical creatures. In it, he gave one of the few known accounts of the creation of the [[peryton]]s, though he may simply have been retelling an ancient legend. He told how the [[Khala]] of [[Imaskar]] had been cursed by five gods of law for their wickedness and worship of [[Bane]], and transformed into the peryton. This tale was unsupported by fact, but it did explain all their unusual [[human]] traits.\n\nThe [[ranger]] [[Talyssa Strongbow]] visited the monastery and discovered Delf's writings, and repeated it in a book she wrote about the land of [[Thar]].",
