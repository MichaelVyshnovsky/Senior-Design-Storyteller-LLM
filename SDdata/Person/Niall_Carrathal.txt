'''Nial Carrathal''', born '''Niall Cymrych''',  was a High King of [[Callidyrr]] in the midâ€“10{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the first king of the [[Carrathal Dynasty]], and although he held the title of High King of the [[Moonshae Isles]], he only ruled over Callidyrr.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|33}}

==Relationships==
He was the son of his predecessor, High King [[Tanner Cymrych]], and he was succeeded by his first son, [[Erfle Carrathal]].

==History==
Niall was born into the [[Cymrych Dynasty]] of High Kings, who traced their lineage to the legendary first High King, [[Cymrych Hugh]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|27}} and subsequently lost both control over [[Norland]] as well as possession of the ''[[Sword of Cymrych Hugh]]'' with the death of his father, High King Tanner, the family's legitimacy as well as its connection to its legendary ancestor had been badly weakened. Thus, when Niall assumed the throne in the {{YearlinkName|944}}, the rule of the true High Kings of the Moonshae Isles came to an end, and he became High King of Callidyrr only. Niall made the decision to change the family name to Carrathal at this time,{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|31}}

Niall ruled for ten years before dying of [[disease|illness]] in the {{YearlinkName|954}}.
