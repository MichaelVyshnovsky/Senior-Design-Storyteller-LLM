Regweld Harpell was a member of the Harpell family which lived in Longsaddle in the Savage Frontier.
Regweld was very fat.
The eccentric wizard loved crossbreeding animals and succeeded in making Puddlejumper, which was a mix of horse and frog.
In 1358 DR, Regweld protected Mithral Hall with his family members Bidderdoo, Bella don Delroy, and Harkle Harpell to help defend Mithral Hall.
While riding Puddlejumper in the Battle of Keepers Dale, Regweld was hit by three lightning bolts cast by enemy drow wizards as he battled a group of minotaurs.
