        "mainbody": "'''Kulshond''', known as '''The Mad Mage''', was an infamous trouble-making [[mage]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}}",
        "Activities": "He traveled all of [[Toril]], acquiring exotic [[spell]]s and playing pranks on people along the way. This included [[polymorph]]ing various creatures he encountered into other kind of creatures as the mood struck him. He could cast a ''[[dimension door]]'' as often as he liked to go where he pleased, presumably by using a [[magic item]].\n\nFor those folk he got curious about, Kulshond hardly ever showed up in person, but rather dispatched one of his ''[[watchskull]]s'' to follow and spy on them. These were created by a spell of his own invention. He could see, hear, communicate, and even speak [[command word]]s through these skulls, including multiple skulls at once, but fortunately could not cast his spells. He could cause the skull to headbutt creatures or even explode. With these ''watchskulls'', Kulshond was known to offer helpful, or taunting, remarks to those he monitored; or disrupt their spellcasting; or surprise them into dropping something vital in order to interfere with their actions, to lead them to harm, or to warn others.",
        "Personality": "His behavior was erratic. He never talked aloud, only murmured and whispered, but he often giggled.",
        "Description": "His face was concealed under a shadowy [[illusion]].",
        "History": "Originally active in the early 1300s DR, Kulshond disappeared from public view ''circa'' [[1330 DR]], giving [[Faerûn]], at least, some respite from his pranks for nearly thirty years.\n\nThen he made a surprise return in the late 1350s DR, wandering the Realms and polymorphing random merchants and noble ladies into [[frog]]s and [[weasel]]s. In [[Selgaunt]] in [[Sembia]], he ''[[vanish]]ed'' a number of surprised people, with their lovers, in various stages of courtship and undress, onto the dining tables of their spouses at a trade-moot feast, leading almost to a riot."
