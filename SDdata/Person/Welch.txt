'''Welch''' was a mercenary that fought as a member of the [[Company of Dawn]] for a time during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the Company of Dawn took on the task of assisting friends of their leader [[Thurbrand]] across a stretch of [[Cormyr]], into the [[Spiderhaunt Wood]] and into [[Shadowdale]]. The journey was disastrous and nearly the entire company was killed by [[giant spider]]s. Welch was killed fighting alongside his fellow mercenary [[Zelanz]], when an enormous red-bodied spider leapt from the trees on top of them.
