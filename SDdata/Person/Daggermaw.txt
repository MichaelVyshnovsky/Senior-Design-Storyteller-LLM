Daggermaw was a large, old, and notably aggressive hunter shark in the Sea of Swords along the Sword Coast North as of the late 15 century DR.
Daggermaw was mean and always hungry. She would attack any potential prey she saw without warning, and it was said that she enjoyed the act of killing.
In the late 15 century DR, the lighthouse at the Tower of Storms was hijacked by an anchorite of Talos and used to lure ships to their doom on the nearby rocks. These wrecks became the favorite hunting ground for Daggermaw, along with two other hunter sharks who were relatively tame by comparison.
