        "History": "In the past, the ancestors of Armun were driven from their halls by evil creatures, and had to live above ground. In this climate, the clan dwindled, and King [[Teirgoh]] had had enough. The king gathered his fellow dwarves and led them underground, in search of their ancestral home. \n\nUsing secret knowledge passed down by the royal family, they finally discovered the stone-carved halls. The halls were huge and the dwarves had to make camp close to a stone portal. Whilst they slept, the stone portal blazed with magical light, and a horde of evil [[drow]] charged them, led by [[Shindia Darkeyes]]. They fought valiantly, but were exhausted by their long weeks of travel. They finally managed to force the dark elves to retreat into the portal, but suffered enormous casualties in the process. In the battle, King Teirgoh was wounded by a poisoned dagger, and lay in eternal sleep. Unfortunately, their [[cleric]] could not do a thing. His only son, Prince [[Keirgar]], was captured during the drow invasion. With no member of the royal family among them, Armun and the rest of the dwarves no longer had access to the secret royal knowledge.\n\n{{fq\n|text=We would rather fight to our deaths than abandon our prince to the drow.\n|source=Armun\n}}\nThe dwarves spent much time recovering from the devastating attack and luckily came across a band of adventurers.
