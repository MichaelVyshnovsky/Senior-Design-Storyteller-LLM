        "Home": "He dwelled in a cave in a gorge in the hills near Ravens Bluff. The entrance was flanked with wooden totems carved to depicted [[lung dragon]]s and blocked by a wooden portcullis, painted bright red. In the late 1350s DR, hunters seeking a golden [[cave bear]] placed bear traps along the gorge, making it difficult to reach. Inside, he had a only a shrine lit by [[candle]]s, a straw sleeping math, and some food in bag.\n\nHis neighbors included [[giant scorpion]]s, the ghosts of two [[bandit]]s betrayed by one [[Bork]], and the [[werebear]] [[Zarin Marblehead]], who was the source of the golden cave bear sightings.",
        "Personality": "With not much in the way of social skills, the hermit was aloof and detached and spoke in a monotonous manner. However, if questioned, he would dispense a wide variety of religious precepts, wise aphorisms, and common sayings, usually in exchange for food.",
        "Abilities": "A highly trained monk, the old hermit was immune to all [[poison]]s; highly resistance to ''[[charm]]'', ''[[hypnosis]]'', and ''[[suggestion]]'' [[spell]]s; and little harmed by injurious [[magic]].",
