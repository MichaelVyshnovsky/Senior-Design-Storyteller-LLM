{{Quote|''You must understand. I have read the signs. Tempos will not favor either side in the coming battles. Both my people and those of the towns shall be haunted by countless deaths without honor. I have cast my spirit into the nether realm in search of a way to prevent what must not be. My vision quest led me here to find you. You are the answer I seek.''|Hjollder to the [[Heroes of Icewind Dale]]}}

==Description==
Hjollder was a large man wearing deerskins.

==Relationships==
Hjollder was a son of [[Hrethric]].

==History==
Guided by visions of the god [[Tempus|Tempos]], Hjollder was directed to [[Kuldahar]], where he hoped to find a group of adventurers capable of saving his tribe from the plans of [[Wylfdene]], a resurrected great [[warrior]] who had proclaimed himself a king of Reghedmen. It was said that this king was a mere vessel for the soul of [[Jerrod]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Hjollder arrived at Kuldahar and settled in a [[Hjollder's house|local house]]. He aimed to take the heroes he had seen in his visions to [[Hengorot (Settlestone)|Hengorot]] to stop a coming war between Reghedmen tribes and the [[Ten Towns]]. He accompanied the [[adventurer]]s on their way to [[Lonelywood]], where they had to split up.
