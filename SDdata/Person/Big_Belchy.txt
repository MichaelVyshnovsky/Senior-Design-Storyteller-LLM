Big Belchy was a unique construct, designed to resemble a dragon turtle, that was created by the Gondar clergy of the House of Inspired Hands in Waterdeep in the midâ€“14 century DR.
This construct had an internal mechanism that allowed it to exhale clouds of scalding steam, in emulation of the breath weapon that dragon turtles possessed.
In the , the clergy of the House of Inspired Hands presented their artificial dragon turtle to the Waterdhavian public on Marpenoth 3, as part of a nautical exhibition for the annual Day of Wonders. The construct managed to make one full rotation around Deepwater Harbor before sinking into the depths, becoming part of Umberlees Cache.
For the next century, the construct would remain at the bottom of Deepwater Harbor, left to accumulate barnacles on its metal shell.
Then, in autumn of the , a group of Lantanese rock gnomes under the employ of the drow mercenary Jarlaxle managed to enact repairs upon the long-abandoned construct, allowing Big Belchy to surface once more. One day, a group of adventurers cornered  in Mistshore two gun-toting agents of Bregan Daerthe, Felrekt Lafeen and Krebbyg Masqilyr, that had in their possession the stone of Golorr. Big Belchy surfaced from the water not long after, acting as their getaway vehicle to Jarlaxles flagship, the Eyecatcher. According to some accounts, the adventurers managed to inflict enough damage upon the construct to force it to sink back into the depths of Deepwater Harbor.
