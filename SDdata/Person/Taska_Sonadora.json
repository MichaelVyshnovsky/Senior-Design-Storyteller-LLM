        "mainbody": "Taska Sonadora was a sea captain in Waterdeep sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.\nTaska was an insane noble who wanted to use all her wealth on bold and foolish adventures. One of her crazy goals was to kill a white dragon. Her ship, the Bobbin Flagon, was stocked with the finest food and drink.\nIn the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Taska was possibly hired to accompany an adventuring party to Svardborg."
