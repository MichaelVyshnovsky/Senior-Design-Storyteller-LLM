        "mainbody": "'''Jemeliah''' was an employee of the [[Gallaway Trade Depot]] in [[Targos]] under the supervision of [[Deirdre Gallaway]], in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Targos? The coldest teat on the [[witch]] that's the North, '''that's''' what Targos is. Not even a starving [[wolf]] would latch onto it.''|Jemeliah}}",
        "Description": "Jemeliah was a gray-haired [[leather armor|leather]]-clad [[human]] man. Before his hair turned gray, he had a full head of red hair.",
        "Possessions": "He armed with a simple [[dagger]] and carried the ''[[Lucky Knucky]]'', a well-known Targossan lucky charm.",
        "History": "He spent half of his long life working for Gallaway Trading Coaster. Years later, when Rawleigh Gallaway, Deirdre Gallaway's father, approached Jemeliah asking for \"one last favor\" â€“ to lend Deirdre his expertise and sharp mind in Targos. By the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Jemeliah had been living in Targos for ten years, working for the Gallaway Trade Depot on top of the cliff overlooking the docks of Targos. He remained in Deirdre Gallaway's employ through the [[Legion of the Chimera]] crisis of 1312 DR. Jemeliah did not hold back criticizing the [[Targos Guard]] for confiscating Gallaway Trade Depot's goods and lumber for the town's fortification. The guard racked up a huge debt with the coaster to Jemeliah's disapproval."
