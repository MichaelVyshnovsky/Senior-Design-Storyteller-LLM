        "mainbody": "Cucathne of Whispered Temptation was a powerful marilith in the 14 century DR.\nCucathne had a typical marilith body, that being a serpentine lower-half and a feminine humanoid upper-half with six arms. She also had sharp, ragged teeth.\nShe wore a brassy crown, enlayed at its center with a black gemstone.\nCucathne commanded a number of highly intelligent, giant poisonous snakes. She kept around her lair in a shrunken state, ready to assume their proper size at any time through a contingency spell.\nSometime in the late 14 century DR, a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff traveled to Viper Forest in the Abyss. There they encountered Cucathne, having made her lair within the wreckage of the spelljammer Tarsus. With the adventurers wishing to use the spelljammer to return to the Prime Material, Cucathne made an exchange with them, offering them her lair if they would agree to take a mysterious blue gemstone and place it as an offering within one of the poor boxes of Ravens Bluffs temples. This gemstone was magical in nature, but its exact effect was difficult to discern, and it was worth roughly 50,000 gold pieces. However, she warned the adventurers that if they failed to do as she asked they would suffer a terrible curse.\nAt some point, Cucathne had obtained a copy of some kind of Cosmic Game, along with expert knowledge on how to play it, from a rogue baatezu known as Asphometh.\nLater, in the month of Hammer, in the , Cucathne traveled with a retinue of hundreds of tanarri troops to Carceri, one of the prime staging areas and battlefield of the eternal Blood War. Like many high ranking tanarri before her, she traveled to Mount Othrys, the home of the imprisoned Greater Titans, Cronus, who himself was unfamiliar with this Cosmic Game up until that point, was equally intrigued by her by her grand entertainment as he was the knowledge she was wagering and agreed to her bet.\nHowever, another group of Ravenian adventurers arrived to Mount Othrys that day He was unwilling to answer any questions that the mortals posed, but offered to gate them home if they would fight as part of his forces in the game. To the adventurers perspective, the two were playing on a large board, with a large mound of mud in the center, and several large figurines. Cucathnes choice of combatants with creatures from Cronuss own realm, a choice that unintentionally slighted the Greater Titan and one that he hoped he repay with the sudden arrival of the adventurers.\nCronus then selected rules set 172, variant H, for the game. Cucathne raised issue with his choice of ruleset, complaining that it had not been in common use for over a millennia. After arguing over this for some time, an agreement was reached, though Cucathne slithered off and coiled her tail around a pillar in the throne room out of anger. Cronus then proceeded to raise the bargain by offering Cucathne a holy sword that had been taken from a captive paladin named Uri.\nCronus explained to the adventurers that they would each be controlling one of the figures on this board. Some of the adventurers might have attempted to ask questions of Cronus during the game, but he rebuffed them with a terse response that they better not fail, as he was quite invested in winning.\nThe adventurers somehow managed to win the game on Cronuss behalf, causing him to dismiss the marilith from his presence. She disappeared, then with one mighty wave of his hand Cronus vaporized her hundreds of tanarri troops, leaving behind only a hazy mist where they once stood. When the adventurers finally earned their trip home, they discovered that \"Ravens Bluff plot ST1\" was in actuality the real Ravens Bluff, as they found the Ministry of Art to be in ruins and talk of a titanic battle having occurred there."
