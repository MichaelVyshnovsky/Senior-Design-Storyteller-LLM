'''Erelda H'tithet''' was the main [[drow]] representative in [[Mantol-Derith]].

==Personality==
Ereda was very good at concealing her scorn for others. She lived in fear of Talabrina Duskryn and did anything she said. However, Erelda personally thought she could do good business with the deep gnomes.

==Activities==
Erelda usually sold art objects, [[poison]]s, and [[obsidian]] daggers, in exchange for [[salt]] and [[gems]].

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], Erelda was, following the suggestion of [[Talabrina Duskryn]], the main opponent to re-opening the outpost to the [[deep gnome]]s of [[Blingdenstone]].
