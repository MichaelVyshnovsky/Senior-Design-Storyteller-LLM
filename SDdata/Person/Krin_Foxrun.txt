Krin Foxrun was a sorcerer who lived at Fourstaves House in Yhaunn with the Thingoleir family during the late 14 century DR.
Krin was brash and daring in his youth, though he was more temperate with age.
Krin was a talented and sorcerer. Unlike his wifes family, he used wands to cast his spells and didnt use a staff.
Krin managed to impress Strasus Thingoleir and Dagnalla Irongard with his boldness and love of Malia, and was welcomed into their home.
He was happily married to Malia Thingoleir and a loving father to Adrey Foxrun, though he was unable to help teach her magic as she had a wizards aptitude.
As a young man, he developed his innate magical talent and enjoyed causing problems with it. He came across the Thingoleir family as they travelled in the Dalelands, and he immediately fell in love with Malia. He eventually proved his worth by dueling another mage in Selgaunt to defend her honor, and joined her family at Fourstaves House.
In Eleasis of 1373 DR, he helped the Thingoleir family study the The Leaves of One Night. The same month, he joined them in defending the Stiltways from Variance Amaticks pack of shadow mastiffs.
