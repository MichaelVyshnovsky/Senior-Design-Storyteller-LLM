'''Gisloi''' was a [[tasloi]] [[cleric]] of [[Loitasloitas]] and one of the two lieutenants of the ''[[Flotilla of DEATH]]''.

==Description==
Like other tasloi, Gisloi had bright green skin, black eyes, and black hair. He stood {{SI|2'6"|ft-in|c}} tall, weighed around {{SI|60|lb|k}}, and had a somewhat pudgy build that he hid behind his clothes. Whenever he tried to speak [[Common]] it came out in a high pitch.

==Personality==
Gisloi was smarter than most of his tasloi kin, able to speak quite eloquently in their native tongue. He was also somewhat of a religious tyrant, teaching that it was heretical to disobey priests of their native faith.

==Abilities==
Gisloi was capable of casting [[spell]]s from the [[sphere]]s of [[All sphere|All]], [[Animal sphere|Animal]], [[Combat sphere|Combat]], [[Healing sphere|Healing]], and [[Protection sphere|Protection]]. He particularly knew the spells ''[[bless]]'', ''[[cure light wounds]]'', and ''[[speak with animals]]''.

==Possessions==
Gisloi typically wore a flashy set of red and yellow [[robe]]s. Like the other tasloi on the ''Flotilla of DEATH'', he was typically armed with a [[javelin]]. Notable among his possessions was a ''[[whistle of shrieking]]'', made of [[ivory]], that he wore around his neck. He would blow this whistle whenever their fleet entered a military engagement, stirring on the hearts of his fellow crewmen.

==History==
Gisloi was born sometime around the {{YearlinkName|1340}}, on the island of [[Tasloiomitasloi]].''Port of Ravens Bluff'' (pp. 42, 45) states that Charles O'Kane became Mayor 20 years ago, which would set it in [[1361 DR]]. Working backwards from this, Gisloi's birth year can be extrapolated. Sometime later [[Spitvah McGurk]] discovered the island and struck up a bargain with the native tasloi to form a small seafaring fleet called the ''Flotilla of DEATH'', wherein Gisloi would be promoted to the role of lieutenant alongside [[Farloi]]. Out of the two, he uniquely acted as a sort of spiritual and moral leader for the tasloi that made up the fleet.
