Gisloi was a tasloi cleric of Loitasloitas and one of the two lieutenants of the Flotilla of DEATH.
Like other tasloi, Gisloi had bright green skin, black eyes, and black hair. He stood  tall, weighed around , and had a somewhat pudgy build that he hid behind his clothes. Whenever he tried to speak Common it came out in a high pitch.
Gisloi was smarter than most of his tasloi kin, able to speak quite eloquently in their native tongue. He was also somewhat of a religious tyrant, teaching that it was heretical to disobey priests of their native faith.
Gisloi was capable of casting spells from the spheres of All, Animal, Combat, Healing, and Protection. He particularly knew the spells bless, cure light wounds, and speak with animals.
Gisloi typically wore a flashy set of red and yellow robes. Like the other tasloi on the Flotilla of DEATH, he was typically armed with a javelin. Notable among his possessions was a whistle of shrieking, made of ivory, that he wore around his neck. He would blow this whistle whenever their fleet entered a military engagement, stirring on the hearts of his fellow crewmen.
Gisloi was born sometime around the , on the island of Tasloiomitasloi.Port of Ravens Bluff (pp. 42, 45) states that Charles OKane became Mayor 20 years ago, which would set it in 1361 DR. Working backwards from this, Gislois birth year can be extrapolated. Sometime later Spitvah McGurk discovered the island and struck up a bargain with the native tasloi to form a small seafaring fleet called the Flotilla of DEATH, wherein Gisloi would be promoted to the role of lieutenant alongside Farloi. Out of the two, he uniquely acted as a sort of spiritual and moral leader for the tasloi that made up the fleet.
