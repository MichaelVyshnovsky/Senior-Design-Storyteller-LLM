        "History": "Cynda and Shan found many adventures together prior to joining the circus. After the circus was attacked by [[minotaur]] warriors from [[Calimport]], Cynda and her sister traveled with [[Cephas]] and [[Corvus Nightfeather]] to [[Almraiven]].\n\nCynda was abducted in Almraiven by two [[firesoul genasi]] and teleported to Calimport where she was forced to fight in the arena. Shan traveled with Corvus and Cephas to Calimport where Cephas was reunited with his father the [[Pasha]] but Shan was sent to the gladiator stables. The Pasha scheduled a fight between Cynda and Shan and made it the main event. Immediately prior to the twin's fight, Cephas tampered with the magic that [[levitate]]d the Pasha's palace and caused it to collide with the arena. In the confusion that followed, Cynda and Shan and friends were able to escape Calimport."
