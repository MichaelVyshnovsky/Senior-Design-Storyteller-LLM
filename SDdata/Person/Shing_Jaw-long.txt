'''Shing Jaw-long''' was the only outland member of the [[Corsair Council]] of [[Hawa]].

==Description==
Shing was a small, handsome man who had long black hair and dark brown eyes that sparkled with intensity. Silk robes were his garment of choice.

==Personality==
Though extremely intelligent, Shing was also loud, arrogant, stubborn, and audacious. His pride sometimes got the better of him as he could be goaded into attempting outrageous stunts to prove himself. He was given a place on the Council after proving how dangerous his flying ship could be to native [[Zakhara]]n vessels.

==Activities==
Shing and his crew used their [[dragonship]] to raid the southern coast of [[Faer√ªn]] and the [[Free Cities]] of Zakhara. They avoided the [[Foreigners' Sea]] on Zakhara's eastern coast for fear of running into [[Shou]] vessels that might report them to the emperor.

==History==
Shing grew up in a pirate family from a maritime province in [[Shou Lung]] called [[Hai Yuan]]. He worked on one of the emperor's spelljamming dragonships, where his abilities as a [[wu jen]] proved useful. After a while, his captain allowed Shing to help choose new crew members. He used this to his advantage and selected old comrades from his past. Eventually Shing and his friends overthrew the captain and took the ship for their own. They returned to [[Toril]] and decided to make their port in Hawa instead of risk the emperor's wrath by returning to [[Kara-Tur]].
