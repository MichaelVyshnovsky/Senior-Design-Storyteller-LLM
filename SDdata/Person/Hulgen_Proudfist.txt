Hulgen Proudfist was the leader of the Proudfist tribe of half-orcs in the late 15 century DR. 
The half-orc chieftain valued strength above other virtues, but recognized strength came in different forms. 
Hulgen worked to maintain the strength of the Proudfist tribe. 
The Proudfists were retainers of the orc kingdom of Many-Arrows, but Hulgen felt his tribe suffered under the oppression of their full-blooded kin. 
In the , Hulgen and the Proudfists served Vansi Bloodscar in the Many-Arrows occupation of the River District of Neverwinter and fought against the Neverwinter Guard. However, Neverwintan mage Riftel Farsight felt they could be persuaded to change sides, but the Proudfists did not trust her. She sent a half-elf adventurer to speak with Hulgen. Hulgen required this diplomat to prove their worth to himself, Dulgan, and Chalik. Hulgen tested their strength by asking them to slay the mighty ogre Thag Slabhead.
Satisfied, Hulgen asked the adventurer to join them in battle as they rose up against their Many-Arrows overseer. After that, Hulgen would bring his tribe to Neverwinters aid.
