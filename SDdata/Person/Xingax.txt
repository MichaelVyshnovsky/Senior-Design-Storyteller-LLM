'''Xingax''' was a mighty, [[undead]] [[outsider]] that originated from the [[Abyss]] who experimented with the undead and other dark, [[arcane magic]]s. He spent some time on [[Toril]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], aligned with the [[Thay]]an [[zulkir]] of [[necromancy]], [[Szass Tam]].

==Description==
===Appearance===
Like other atropal, Xingax appeared as an oversized, deformed stillborn babe. He had small rotting fingers at the ends of his twisted, shortened arms.. From his protruding belly extended a length of umbilical cord, further contributing to his likeness of an undeveloped, rotting fetus. 

Xingax was nearsighted, and required the use of an array of lenses, attached to a series of small [[steel]] arms to correct his vision.

While he was fully capable of moving on his own by means of levitation, Xingax insisted on being carried by a [[zombified]] [[hill giant]], preferring to portray himself as helpless.

===Personality===
Xingax was incapable of love, in an emotional, spiritual, or physical manner, and found the concept of sexuality curious. He was was both intrigued by the peculiar concept while simultaneously finding it repulsive. The atropal believed himself to be an inventor and an artist whose work kept him from fighting or any other mundane activity.

==Powers==
Xingax radiated an aura of malevolent energy that, when felt by others, caused them to experience bouts of vomiting, blinding headaches, and convulsions.

==History==
Before he had a chance to be born, Xingax was torn from his mother's womb by her mate, though it was unknown if the being was his father. It was believed that if his mother carried him to term and gave birth, Xingax would have been born a [[demipower]] of the Abyss. Following his "creation", Xingax spent nearly all of his existence within the Abyss.

==History==
In {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Xingax established an undead factory within a stronghold located in the foothills of [[Thaymount]] on [[Toril]]. From within, the abyssal monstrosity began raising an army of powerful, sentient, undead creatures the likes of which had either never before been seen in [[Faerûn]] or had been extinct for centuries. His ultimate aim was to conquer the nation of [[Thay]].{{Page needed}}

One of the achievements of which Xingax most proud was the transformation he had set upon the [[Rashemi]] slave [[Tammith Iltazyarra]]. He had managed to turn her into a unique breed of [[vampire]] and proudly referred to her as "daughter".

During the [[War of the Zulkirs]], Xingax was injured by the mortal [[bard]] [[Bareris Anskuld]], but repaired that damage with an enlarged hand made from shadow and an eye taken from the body of the slain [[nighthaunt]], [[Ysval]]. From these modifications, Xingax learned to wield the [[arcane]] powers the shadow-[[fiend]] had wielded, such as the ability to summon darkness that shut out daylight.

Following the [[spellplague]], Xingax's powers were temporarily lost. Rather than continuing to serve alongside the [[lich]] Szass Tam in battle, he returned to his true passion—developing new [[Necromantic sphere|necromantic]] [[spell]]s. However, in [[1385 DR]], he was slain by Bareris and his "daughter" Tammith during an assault on his fortress in Thay.
