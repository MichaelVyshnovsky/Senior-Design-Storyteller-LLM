'''Angus''' was an old [[moorhound]] owned by [[Tristan Kendrick]], Prince of [[Corwell]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Deep in his years, Angus had a worn brown face and a shaggy neck.

==History==
In [[1345 DR]], [[Daryth]] became the kennel master of Angus and Tristan's other hunting dogs.

Angus was previously the top dog of Tristan's pack, but he was quickly dominated by the new dog [[Canthus]]. Shortly afterwards, Angus was killed protecting Tristan and [[Robyn Kendrick|Robyn]] from a wild [[boar]] during a hunt.
