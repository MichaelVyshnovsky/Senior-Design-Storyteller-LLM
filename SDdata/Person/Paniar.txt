Paniar the Obese was a wizard who lived in Ravens Bluff in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Paniar lived in a gray one-story house on Magicians Row with writing on the door frame. It was the fourth of five houses.
Paniar had a weasel familiar, smoked Bittersage tobacco, and was primarily a water drinker.
Circa 1357 DR, the City Guard serving Regent of the Exchequer Vernon Condor considered Paniar the Obese for the theft of two minor magic items of historical importance from the city vaults, after suspicions and divinations tracked the thieves to Magicians Row. However, Paniar was innocent.
