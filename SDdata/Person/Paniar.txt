'''Paniar the Obese''' was a [[wizard]] who lived in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/58/The Living City: Of Wits and Wizards, A Logic Puzzle|27}}

==Home==
Paniar lived in a gray one-story house on [[Magician's Row]] with writing on the door frame. It was the fourth of five houses.

==Description==
Paniar had a [[weasel]] [[familiar]], smoked Bittersage [[tobacco]], and was primarily a [[water]] drinker.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], the [[City Guard (Ravens Bluff)|City Guard]] serving Regent of the Exchequer [[Vernon Condor]] considered Paniar the Obese for the theft of two minor [[magic item]]s of historical importance from the city vaults, after suspicions and [[divination]]s tracked the thieves to Magician's Row. However, Paniar was innocent.
