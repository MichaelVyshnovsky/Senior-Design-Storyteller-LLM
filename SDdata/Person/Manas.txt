Guard Captain Manas was a senior officer of the Yhaunn guard forces around the late 14 century.
Manas was a middle-aged, broad-shouldered, strongly-built man with strong facial features and graying hair in 1373 DR. When not in uniform, he wore plain, dark, but well-made clothes.
Manas was a direct and disciplined man, who excelled at keeping his composure. He very much preferred action to words, and respected anyone who showed courage in the face of intimidation. Due to his high rank, he was forced to learn how to interact with the rich and powerful people he would otherwise prefer to avoid.
He got along extremely well with Feena Archwood, as they were both practical-minded fighters who avoided politics whenever possible. Although neither acted on it, there was a slightly awkward romantic infatuation between the two of them.
In Eleasis of 1373 DR, he investigated the death of Cyrume, who appeared to have been mauled by a werewolf. At the behest of High Luck Colle Shoondeep, he performed a cursory investigation of Moonmistress-Designate Feena but trusted her claims of innocence. He later met Feena at a party hosted by Ammanas Aumleagarr, chatting pleasantly with her and reporting his investigation had failed to proceed any further, as the cult of Shar had hidden their actions too well.
After the Sharran attack on Moonshadow Hall, he recovered Jarull Cartcoster from captivity in the temple of Shar.
