The Brigadier was a giff shopkeeper in Skullport in 1370 DR.
The Brigadier arrived on Toril aboard a spelljammer ship in 1365. He opened a shop where he supplied people with smokepowder. He smuggled the powder from Lantan and Thay to Skullport. He could also create very good smokepower weapons, each unique to its owner. The Brigadier studied all the characteristics of an individual to provide him or her with the best gun.
The Brigadier was an unusual giff, being interested in the people of Toril. He preferred to be called the Brigadier, an honored title among giff, rather than by his own name, because he was very proud of his title.
