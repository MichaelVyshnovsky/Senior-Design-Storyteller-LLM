        "mainbody": "Father Anton Goodchance was seemingly aloof priest of Tymora in 14th century DR. He was known for lazily ambling along in his journey and would whistle a jig. His motto for life was \"fortune favors the bold\".\nIn 1369 DR he took a pilgrimage to Shadowdale, taking the route of the Northride.\nFather Anton carried with him a pair of maces."
