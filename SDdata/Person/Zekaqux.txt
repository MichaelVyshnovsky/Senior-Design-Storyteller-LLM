'''Zekaqux''' was one of the leading [[ixzan]] members of the [[Xendreth]], ruling council of [[Malydren]] in [[1370 DR]], as well as the city's high priest of [[Ilxendren]].

==History==
Zekaqux born in the year of Malydren's founding, [[602 DR]], and together with [[Phiaqiv]] was transformed into a greater [[vampire]] by an [[avatar]] of [[Ilxendren]]. In time, thank to their experience, he and Phiaqiv became the leading members of the Xendreth.

==Activities==
Zekaqux was one of the leading clerics of the city and master of the [[Ziggurat of the Demonray]]. He liked to swim in the deepest catacombs beneath the temple of Ilxendren. From this habit and his [[undead]] nature he received his nickname, "Netherhaunt".
