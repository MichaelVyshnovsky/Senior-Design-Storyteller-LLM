'''Baera''' was a [[dwarven]] surveyor that lived on the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Baera worked with [[Thrimbul]], a historian that joined the [[Clan Hillborn|Hillborn]] expedition into [[Mount Hotenow]].

==History==
When Mount Hotenow erupted in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, a network of [[Fireguard Fortress|dwarven ruins]] became uncovered within the volcano. While the city of [[Neverwinter]] was partially destroyed in the cataclysm, the years that followed saw Neverwintan people making great effort to rebuild their home. After the city was well underway towards full reconstruction, the dwarves of [[Clan Hillborn]] embarked upon an expedition into Mount Hotenow to explore their ancestral ruins and perhaps find a link to the legendary lost dwarfhold of [[Gauntlgrym]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the expedition discovered that the [[fire giant]] [[Gommoth]] and the [[cult of Maegera]] proved a threat to Neverwinter as they sought to reawaken the slumbering primordial once again. The dwarves took action to help slow the cult's progress and prevent their success. Baera worked with the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to install a trio of ''[[scrying sphere]]s'' in the caldera of Mount Hotenow to observe cult activities and gleam more information about the mad giant's activities.

Together, they learned that Gommoth planned to use a trio of precisely-aligned focusing shrines in order to complete his ritual to awaken Maegera. The hero of the city sabotaged the shrines' alignment, buying themselves enough time to slay several of Gommoth's generals, and infiltrate the [[Temple of the Primordial]].
