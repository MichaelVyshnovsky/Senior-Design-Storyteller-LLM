        "mainbody": "'''Alicia Ambergul''' was a [[Netherese]] [[lich]] residing near [[Daggerford]] around [[1480 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Alicia had no goal, instead simply residing inside her family crypt surrounded by the tombs of her husband, her sons, and her daughter. She was served by four [[mummy|mummies]] and an [[invisible stalker]]. She tried to give all visitors to the crypt one of her [[clockwork cat]]s, in order to secretly monitor them.",
        "History": "Alicia was the consort of Lord [[Reynard Ambergul]], a Netherese noble who'd become rich robbing tombs. Just for fun, he gathered a small cult to the [[Elemental Evil|Elemental Princes of Evil]], collected also some powerful [[scroll]]s and [[artifact]]s.\n\nAround [[1480 DR]], Alicia was disturbed first by an expedition led by the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Darwa Dalion]] in search of the [[earth key]] and later by an adventuring party searching for Darwa."
