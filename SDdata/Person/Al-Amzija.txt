'''Al-Amzija''' was a [[black cloud of vengeance]] that surrounded the ruins of [[Sokkar]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Though the black cloud could not enter the city, it surrounded it for miles in every direction, guarding against any intrusions.

Al-Amzija could sense any living creature within the city once the creature spent a day within Sokkar and was even aware when items from Sokkar were taken, making it the perfect deterrent for potential thieves.

The mere mention of Al-Amzija's name called the black cloud to the precise location within minutes.

==History==
Al-Amzija was summoned by the [[Undying]] to shield Sokkar upon the death of its last citizen.
