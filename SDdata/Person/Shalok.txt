Shalok was a Red Wizard of Thay in the Doomvault dungeon in 1486 DR.
Shalok was a Red Wizard assigned to the secret complex of Doomvault located under Thaymount. As one of the most loyal and fanatical followers of Szass Tam, he was tasked with the custody of the Chosen of Tymora Curran Corvalin in the deepest levels of the dungeon. Heroes from Daggerford fought him in 1486 DR, but when Shalok saw things going bad he immediately surrendered.
Despite his loyalty to Tam, Shalok was a coward at heart.
