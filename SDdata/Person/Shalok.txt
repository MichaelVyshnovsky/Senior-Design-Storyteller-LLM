'''Shalok''' was a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] in the [[Doomvault]] dungeon in [[1486 DR]].

==History==
Shalok was a Red Wizard assigned to the secret complex of Doomvault located under [[Thaymount]]. As one of the most loyal and fanatical followers of [[Szass Tam]], he was tasked with the custody of the [[Chosen]] of [[Tymora]] [[Curran Corvalin]] in the deepest levels of the dungeon. Heroes from [[Daggerford]] fought him in 1486 DR, but when Shalok saw things going bad he immediately surrendered.

==Personality==
Despite his loyalty to Tam, Shalok was a coward at heart.
