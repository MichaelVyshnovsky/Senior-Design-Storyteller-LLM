The '''luminous being''' was a mysterious entity that existed beyond the normal [[cosmology]], at the beginning and the end of time simultaneously, yet outside time and space proper.

==Description==
The luminous being was a cold and harsh entity, yet at the same time forgiving and warm.

==Lore==
Little was known about the luminous being. It was in charge of the creation and destruction of all the [[Prime Material Plane|universes]], Yet, around [[1479 DR]], it was claimed that Lord Ao served no one.<ref>
