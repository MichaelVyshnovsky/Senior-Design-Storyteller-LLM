'''Reshvemi''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Abeir]], a descendant of [[Khorsaya]], and an ancestor of [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]].

==Relationships==
Reshvemi was the direct ancestor of [[Verthisathurgiesh Anala]], [[Verthisathurgiesh Pandjed|Pandjed]], and [[Mehen]].

==History==
Reshvemi was one of the dragonborn clan leaders who took part in the [[battle of the Crippled Mountain]]. Alongside [[Iskdara]], [[Shurideh]], and [[Thuchir]], he infiltrated the [[Crippled Mountain|Celestial Mountain]] to kill the [[dragon]] overlord [[Rhodrolytharnestrix]]. Reshvemi was the one who threw the [[Eye of Blazing Rorn]] into the volcano, causing the eruption that killed the [[red dragon]].

Reshvemi survived the final battle and was one of the founders of [[Tymanchebar]], and presumably, he was one of the first patriarchs of Clan Verthisathurgiesh.
