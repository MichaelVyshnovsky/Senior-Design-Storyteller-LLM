Reshvemi was a dragonborn of Abeir, a descendant of Khorsaya, and an ancestor of Clan Verthisathurgiesh.
Reshvemi was the direct ancestor of Verthisathurgiesh Anala, Pandjed, and Mehen.
Reshvemi was one of the dragonborn clan leaders who took part in the battle of the Crippled Mountain. Alongside Iskdara, Shurideh, and Thuchir, he infiltrated the Celestial Mountain to kill the dragon overlord Rhodrolytharnestrix. Reshvemi was the one who threw the Eye of Blazing Rorn into the volcano, causing the eruption that killed the red dragon.
Reshvemi survived the final battle and was one of the founders of Tymanchebar, and presumably, he was one of the first patriarchs of Clan Verthisathurgiesh.
