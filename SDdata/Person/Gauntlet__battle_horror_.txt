Gauntlet was a battle horror (an evolved kind of helmed horror) that led the Doom Brigade under orders of the beholder Vaxall.
Gauntlet was one of the main minions of Vaxall. It led the Doom Brigade, a company of ten helmed horrors.
In 1370 DR, Gauntlet and his troop tried to stop the awakening of the Knights of the Crescent Moon, considering them a threat for its master.
Gauntlet possessed a helm of telepathy that permitted it to give orders to the helmed horrors and was equipped with Guardian, a magic sword enchanted by the lich Jhaniloth Puiral.
