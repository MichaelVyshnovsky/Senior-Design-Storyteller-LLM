        "mainbody": "'''Goboka''' was a [[shaman]] and chieftain of a tribe of [[Ice Spire ogre|ogres]] in the [[Ice Spires|Ice Spires West]].",
        "Description": "Goboka was an [[Ice Spire ogre]], a larger, smarter, and smellier subrace of [[ogre]]. Goboka had brown skin.",
        "Personality": "While few of his employers fully trusted him, Goboka was in fact completely faithful to any agreements he had negotiated.\n\nGoboka's personal dream was to exceed his grandfather in fame.",
        "Possessions": "Goboka's beautiful throne made of an assortment of bones was located in a chamber with one of the [[Mist Caves]] in the Ice Spires West.",
        "Relationships": "Goboka was the grandson of an ogre chieftain who had united all of the ogre tribes of the Ice Spires against the [[human]]s and [[giant]]s of the region. He was highly respected among the ogre tribes of the Ice Spires.\n\nGoboka maintained a working relationship with King [[Camden]] of [[Hartsvale]]. He also sometimes hired his tribe out to giant tribes.",
        "Activities": "Goboka and his ogre's performed kidnappings, raids for treasure, and military services.\n\nHe had instituted a ceremony among the ogre's of his tribe called the \"Six Day Night\". During this ritual, an individual ogre would voluntarily be abandoned in a dark and isolated cave with nothing but a small amount of water. If the ogre survived, he or she might be rewarded with a promotion among the tribe. This was seen as a demonstration of loyalty to both Vaprak and Goboka.\n\nGoboka had considered sending messengers to ogre tribes across [[Faer√ªn]] in an attempt to unite them, but he never accomplished this during his lifetime.",
        "Religion": "Goboka was a follower of both [[Vaprak|Vaprak the Destroyer]], god of ogres, and the [[Twilight Spirit]]. In fact, it was the latter being who granted Goboka his shaman powers.",
        "History": "During the [[War of the Twins]] in Hartsvale, Goboka sold the services of his tribe to Prince Camden. In exchange, he demanded Camden's firstborn daughter when she came of age. Since Camden had no children at the time, and his family strongly favored males, he agreed. In truth, Goboka was under the hire of the Twilight Spirit.\n\nIn [[1366 DR]], when his daughter Princess [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] came of age, the ogres demanded that Camden fulfill his promise. He at last agreed to allow Brianna to be kidnapped.\n\nThe [[firbolg]] [[ranger]] [[Tavis Burdun]] eventually tracked Goboka and his ogres and rescued Brianna."
