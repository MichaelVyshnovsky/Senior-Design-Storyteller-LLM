Drizzt DoUrden
Dinin DoUrden was a drow fighter of House DoUrden of Menzoberranzan. He later became a drider.
In 1297 DR, secondboy Dinin accompanied the soldiers of House DoUrden in a successful attack on House DeVir. During the battle, Dinin took advantage of an opportune moment to distract his older brother, Nalfein DoUrden, and put a sword in his back. Dinin then ascended to become elderboy of House DoUrden. That action fortuitously saved the life of newborn Drizzt DoUrden, who was to be sacrificed to Lolth as the third living son Nalfeins death was deemed an acceptable sacrifice instead.
Twenty years later, Dinin became a master at Melee-Magthere, the drow academy for fighters. He watched over his younger brother, Drizzt DoUrden, and was a member of the same training patrol, along with Masoj Hunett and Berginyon Baenre.
Dinin was recalled to House DoUrden when Drizzt graduated in order to add strength to the houses upcoming war with House Hunett.

In 1339 DR, when House DoUrden was destroyed by House Baenre he was spared by Jarlaxle under the conditions that he join the mercenary band Bregan Daerthe. He became a trusted ally of Jarlaxle until he was turned into a drider by his sister Vierna DoUrden for openly mistrusting his older sisters motives. In Viernas personal attack on Drizzt DoUrden in 1357 DR, the transformed Dinin was killed in a vicious battle with King Bruenor Battlehammer.
Dinin was brought back from the Abyss by a handmaiden of Lolth as the torment of driders did not end with death. Dinin jumped into the remove curse web that Quenthel and Yvonnel Baenre had weaved with the birth magic of Catti-brie, restoring Dinin back to drow form, along with eight hundred others. He begin life anew in Menzoberranzan under the false name of Dininae.
The restored former driders organized into a group known as the Blaspheme. Dinin grew close to its leader, Malavoselle Amvas Tol, and her lieutenant, Aleandra thanks to the fighting skills that he had learned under Zaknafein, though neither believed him to be a houseless rogue from the Stenchstreets as he claimed himself to be. While stationed in House DoUrden though, Aleandra noticed that he seemed to be expertly familiar with the buildings layout, which led her to discover his true identity. When Aleandra was captured by House Melarn, she used this knowledge to bargain herself out of being cursed back into drider form, and Dinin was soon captured and tortured by House Melarn. Dinin was forced to agree to get close enough to his estranged brother that he could murder Drizzts daughter, Brie. Fearing his fate at the hands of Lolth herself should he abandon this charge, he resolved to do so, even after his escape from Menzoberranzan and return to working for Bregan Daerthe.
Dinin often fought with a sword and dirk. After Zaknafein DoUrdens death in 1328 DR, Dinin carried his swords and wore his armor. Dinins favored weapon was his hand crossbow.
Dinin was a skilled rider of riding lizards.
Dinin was the son of Matron Mother Malice DoUrden and house patron Rizzen DoUrden. He was the brother of Drizzt DoUrden, as well as Nalfein, Briza, Vierna, and Maya.
