'''Dinin Do'Urden''' was a [[drow]] [[fighter]] of [[House Do'Urden]] of [[Menzoberranzan]]. He later became a [[drider]].

==History==
===House Do'Urden===
In [[1297 DR]], secondboy Dinin accompanied the soldiers of House Do'Urden in a successful attack on [[House DeVir]]. During the battle, Dinin took advantage of an opportune moment to distract his older brother, [[Nalfein Do'Urden]], and put a sword in his back. Dinin then ascended to become elderboy of House Do'Urden. That action fortuitously saved the life of newborn [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], who was to be sacrificed to [[Lolth]] as the third living son; Nalfein's death was deemed an acceptable sacrifice instead.

Twenty years later, Dinin became a master at [[Melee-Magthere]], the drow academy for fighters. He watched over his younger brother, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], and was a member of the same training patrol, along with [[Masoj Hun'ett]] and [[Berg'inyon Baenre]].

Dinin was recalled to House Do'Urden when Drizzt graduated in order to add strength to the house's upcoming war with [[House Hun'ett]].

===Bregan D'aerthe===
In [[1339 DR]], when House Do'Urden was destroyed by [[House Baenre]] he was spared by [[Jarlaxle]] under the conditions that he join the mercenary band [[Bregan D'aerthe]]. He became a trusted ally of Jarlaxle until he was turned into a [[drider]] by his sister [[Vierna Do'Urden]] for openly mistrusting his older sister's motives. In Vierna's personal attack on Drizzt Do'Urden in [[1357 DR]], the transformed Dinin was killed in a vicious battle with King [[Bruenor Battlehammer]].

Dinin was brought back from the Abyss by a [[Yochlol|handmaiden of Lolth]] as the torment of driders did not end with death. Dinin jumped into the ''remove curse'' web that [[Quenthel Baenre|Quenthel]] and [[Yvonnel Baenre II|Yvonnel Baenre]] had weaved with the birth magic of [[Catti-brie]],<ref> restoring Dinin back to drow form, along with eight hundred others. He begin life anew in Menzoberranzan under the false name of Dininae.<ref>

The restored former driders organized into a group known as the [[Blaspheme]].<ref> Dinin grew close to it's leader, [[Mal'a'voselle Amvas Tol]],<ref> and her lieutenant, [[Aleandra Amvas Tol|Aleandra]]<ref> thanks to the fighting skills that he had learned under Zaknafein, though neither believed him to be a houseless rogue from the Stenchstreets as he claimed himself to be.<ref> While stationed in House Do'Urden though, Aleandra noticed that he seemed to be expertly familiar with the building's layout,<ref> which led her to discover his true identity.<ref> When Aleandra was captured by [[House Melarn]], she used this knowledge to bargain herself out of being cursed back into drider form,<ref> and Dinin was soon captured and tortured by House Melarn.<ref> Dinin was forced to agree to get close enough to his estranged brother that he could murder Drizzt's daughter, [[Briennelle Zaharina|Brie]].<ref> Fearing his fate at the hands of Lolth herself should he abandon this charge, he resolved to do so, even after his escape from Menzoberranzan and return to working for Bregan D'aerthe.<ref>
==Possessions==
Dinin often fought with a sword and dirk. After [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]]'s death in [[1328 DR]], Dinin carried his swords and wore his armor. Dinin's favored weapon was his [[hand crossbow]].

==Skills==
Dinin was a skilled rider of [[riding lizard]]s.

==Relationships==
Dinin was the son of [[Matron Mother]] [[Malice Do'Urden]] and house patron [[Rizzen Do'Urden]]. He was the brother of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], as well as [[Nalfein Do'Urden|Nalfein]], [[Briza Do'Urden|Briza]], [[Vierna Do'Urden|Vierna]], and [[Maya Do'Urden|Maya]].
