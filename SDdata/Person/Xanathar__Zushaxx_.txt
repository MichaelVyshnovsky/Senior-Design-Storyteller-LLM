'''Zushaxx''' was a [[Xanathar]], the leader of the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]] in [[Waterdeep]], throughout much of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/206/The Xanathar: Crime Lord of Waterdeep|1-2}}

==Personality==
Zushaxx was paranoid and megalomaniacal. It was also more ambitious and impulsive than many previous Xanathars, and hungered for knowledge, information, and wealth.

==History==
Zushaxx was at least the fifteenth Xanathar: the corpses of thirteen previous Xanathars remained in its lair and at least one [[Xandulzrithral|previous Xanathar]] had peacefully retired from the position.

Sometime ''circa'' [[1466 DR]], Zushaxx, a relatively young beholder, took over as the Xanathar from [[Izulktur]], the previous Xanathar, who was born of the same beholder cluster. With the support of the [[drow]] servant [[Kal'dir]], Zushaxx quickly established itself as the new Xanathar. It spent the first year as the guild leader poring over the library amassed by its predecessors, which fueled a desire to amass more information.

By [[1479 DR]], it had established itself as one of the more ambitious Xanathars, and it was considering whether to break with the longstanding tradition of keeping its identity as a beholder a secret, as all of its predecessors had done.

In [[1491 DR]], the Xanathar, in cahoots with the [[mind flayer]] [[Suthool]] and the agent of [[Asmodeus]] [[Belvarra Bowmantle]], supported the plots of the [[Masked Lord]] [[Braethan Cazondur]] in order to distract the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] and the [[Open Lord]]s from its operation in [[Skullport]] and to gain power in order to expel the [[Zhentarim]] from [[Waterdeep]].

The next year, Zushaxx started a street war in Waterdeep between its guild and the [[Zhentarim]] over possession of the ''[[Stone of Golorr]]'', which was understood to be the key to finding the lost wealth embezzled from Waterdeep by [[Dagult Neverember]].{{Waterdeep-time}}

==Possessions==
Xanathar wore a ''[[ring of invisibility]]'', a ''[[ring of mind shielding]]'', and a ''[[ring of resistance]]'' on its eyestalks.

==Rumors and Legends==
Some believed that the Xanathar possessed a magical object, carried by one of its henchmen, through which it could project its eye rays and that it had put numerous [[Lords of Waterdeep]] under its control, using its Charm Ray in this way.
