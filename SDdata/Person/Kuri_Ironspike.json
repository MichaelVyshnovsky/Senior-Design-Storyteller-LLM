        "History": "Ironspike was originally a warrior from [[Amn]] who'd fought [[wyvern]]s and [[gnoll]]s in the [[Snowflake Mountains]]. After venturing to Maztica, he entered into the service of Lord [[Drakosa]] but secretly worked for Captain [[Alanza DaNosta]].\n\nIn [[1362 DR]], he was tasked with accompanying an adventuring party hired by Drakosa to find the [[Cloak of One Plume]]. In truth, in exchange for a passage back to [[Faer√ªn]], he would deliver it instead to DaNosta.",
        "Personality": "Ironspike was always ready, believing all situations to be possible traps and all creatures possible dangers. He believed the [[Maztican]]s were like children in need of strong leadership, or were savages little better than [[orc]]s."
