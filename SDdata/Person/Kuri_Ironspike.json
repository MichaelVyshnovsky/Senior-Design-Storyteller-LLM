After venturing to Maztica, he entered into the service of Lord Drakosa but secretly worked for Captain Alanza DaNosta.\nIn 1362 DR, he was tasked with accompanying an adventuring party hired by Drakosa to find the Cloak of One Plume. In truth, in exchange for a passage back to Faer√ªn, he would deliver it instead to DaNosta.\nIronspike was always ready, believing all situations to be possible traps and all creatures possible dangers. He believed the Mazticans were like children in need of strong leadership, or were savages little better than orcs."
