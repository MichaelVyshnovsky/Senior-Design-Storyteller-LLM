'''Zorak Lightdrinker''' was a [[shield dwarf]] [[vampire]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
Around the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], [[Halaster Blackcloak]] captured Zorak and bound him to a crypt inside the [[Obstacle Course]] level. Halaster put the dwarf vampire under a ''[[geas]]'' that compelled him to hunt and kill all travelers that were marked with a [[death mark]], which was gained entering into the crypt.
