        "Introduction": "Next, begin with a short introduction, to quickly tell the reader who the character is, what they are, and why they're important. As usual for wiki articles, begin with the name—or names—of the character in bold. For fun, you can treat this like a NPC's statblock or a PC's character sheet, with name, gender, race, class (alignment is typically [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:No crunch|too crunchy]]). You can follow with a mention of where they're from and what they do. For a particularly important character, or a very long article, you can also add a brief summary of other key aspects of the character: their personality, achievements, relationships with other important people, and other unique features.\n\nFor example:\n:'''Tessaril Winter''', formerly known as '''Tessar the Mage''', was a female [[human]] [[fighter]] and [[wizard]]. Previously an adventurer, she became the lord of the town of [[Eveningstar]] in [[Cormyr]]. She was beloved as an easy-going and attentive ruler, who used her magic to keep the peace. She was good friends and a one-time lover of King [[Azoun IV]], and notably had a [[tressym]] [[familiar]].\n\nThis is the common style evolved on the wiki, but you may feel a different arrangement is more effective. But please consider if it's really necessary first.\n\nCitations should be placed here, as everywhere, especially those that give a good overview, first appearance, or main appearance of the character.",
