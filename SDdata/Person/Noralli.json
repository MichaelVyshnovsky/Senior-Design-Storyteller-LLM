        "mainbody": "Mistress Noralli was a merchant and rumormonger of the new community of Spiderhaven inside Undermountain in 1375 DR.\nNoralli was very amicable for a dread necromancer, having been raised to be honest and forthcoming with others. She spoke all about rumors in the community but was sometimes cryptic.\nNoralli sold and bought goods. Among them, she sold very suspicious soaps and bought clothing, usually taken from the dead.\nNoralli also appeared to operate the only carousel in all the Underdark, using living animals reanimated as undead. These animals included a giant eagle, three giant spiders, four horses, and two mules. She charged 2 copper pieces for a 5 minute ride on her carousel, but warned patrons to keep their arms away from the beasts mouths since some tended to bite.\nNoralli went on adventures together with Jhaiedaliander Thistleberry. She always had with her her imp familiar Croat, which masqueraded as a flying squirrel."
