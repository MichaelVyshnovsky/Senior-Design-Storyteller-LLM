==Description==
Jacko was a dark-skinned [[human]] man with light brown eyes. As a Cashguard, he wore a set of uniform [[breastplate]] [[armor]] and a [[helmet]]. Jacko was armed with a two-handed [[heavy crossbow]] but also carried a [[shield]] and a [[rapier]] for close combat.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Jacko was tasked with guarding the front entrance of the Counting House in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]. He stood shoulder-to-shoulder with a fellow Cashuard Artillerist [[Erus]] who was mostly annoyed with Jacko and his tendency to talk on the job, complaining about strange sounds, discussing the bank's clients, and asking about Erus's lunch plans.
