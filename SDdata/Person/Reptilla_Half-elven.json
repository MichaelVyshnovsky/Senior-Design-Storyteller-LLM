        "mainbody": "Reptilla Half-elven was a half-elf wizard who dwelt in the Dragonspine Mountains in the early 1360s DR.\nShe was a highly dexterous mage, and skilled in making poisons.\nReptilla and her small dragon familiar, Thsst, dwelt in a cave on the sunnier side of the Dragonspine Mountains. From here, they ambushed animals and lone travelers and used them for Reptillas experiments with poisons.\nReptilla owned a staff of the serpent, bracers of defense, and a cloak of displacement, as well as a vial of curdled death.\nShe lost her staff of the serpent in the lair of a bronze dragon."
