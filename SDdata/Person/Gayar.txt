'''Gayar''' was the leader of the [[dukar]] [[Order of Kupavi]] in [[Myth Nantar]].

==Personality==
A very ancient being, Gayar was one of the most soft-spoken individuals of the city, surprising people who had had bad meetings with [[morkoth]]. He liked Myth Nantar and its energies. Deep inside, however, Gayar hoped to go back to [[Qatoris]] one day.

==History==
In [[Alturiak]] of [[1370 DR]], a xenophobic [[aquatic elf]] newly arrived in Myth Nantar killed Gayar but soon after in penance joined the dukars.
