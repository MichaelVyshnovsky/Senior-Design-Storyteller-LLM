Gayar was the leader of the dukar Order of Kupavi in Myth Nantar.
A very ancient being, Gayar was one of the most soft-spoken individuals of the city, surprising people who had had bad meetings with morkoth. He liked Myth Nantar and its energies. Deep inside, however, Gayar hoped to go back to Qatoris one day.
In Alturiak of 1370 DR, a xenophobic aquatic elf newly arrived in Myth Nantar killed Gayar but soon after in penance joined the dukars.
