'''Aster Merris''' was the regional leader of the [[Forgotten Lords]], a major prosperous trading cartel active across the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Very well, then. As a merchant, you must be as good as your word - but be careful how you use it.''|Aster Merris}}

==Description==
Aster was a young and slender woman with green eyes and shoulder-length chestnut hair. She carried herself with a curt and business-like demeanor. Aster's golden touch almost always guaranteed profit. She prided herself on the Forgotten Lords' honesty.

==Relationships==
The [[Church of Waukeen]] respected Aster Merris. She was considered to be a canny and resourceful merchant favored by [[Waukeen]]. Aster greatly distrusted [[Shadow Thieves]] of [[Amn]], especially [[Belueth the Calm]], a mercenary who might've joined merchant [[Sa'Sani]]'s operations on the [[Sword Coast North]]. She also distrusted the [[Fated Winds]] mercantile firm that was rumored to had been associated with the [[Zhentarim]]. Aster did not openly accuse the competitors of anything. However, Aster stressed her mercantile company's honesty when dealing with new costers interested in joining the Lords.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the Forgotten Lords were already an influential mercantile group that spread its dealings across the Sword Coast. After the [[Shadow War]] finished, the trade and economy were left crippled in the area surrounding [[Neverwinter]]. The Forgotten Lords were among three major trade cartels granted offices within the [[Temple of Waukeen (Neverwinter)|Temple of Waukeen]] in the city's [[Tyr's Eye]] district. The Church of Waukeen guided the revival of trade and refilling of its drained coffers of the northern city with the blessing of Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]]. Aster Merris, the Forgotten Lords' regional leader, was reassigned from the headquarters in [[Waterdeep]] to Neverwinter to supervise the newly established business.

During that period of time, a new coster joined the economy of the north. Sa'Sani led her [[Mercantile House]] to the Sword Coast and opened its headquarters in the [[Crossroad Keep]]. Two of her associates did business in Neverwinter, including interactions with the Forgotten Lords. [[Il'foss]] and [[Kizu]] disappeared soon after, secretly slain by the [[yuan-ti]] [[Forktongue]] cultists of an interloper deity, [[Zehir]]. Sa'Sani's hirelings interviewed Aster regarding the missing merchants and were given an opportunity to ally the Mercantile House with the Forgotten Lords.
