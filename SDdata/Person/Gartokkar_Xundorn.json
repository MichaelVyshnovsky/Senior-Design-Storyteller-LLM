        "mainbody": "Gartokkar Xundorn was a duergar cleric of Laduguer, a member of Clan Xundorm, and the leader of the Keepers of the Flame in the city of Gracklstugh in the late 15 century DR.\nThe Keepers of the Flame had the duty of serving the Wyrmsmith of Gracklstugh, the red dragon Themberchaud. They obeyed his every whim, keeping him happy, rich, and fat on the citys more disobedient slaves, while guarding the entrance to his lair. But they also kept Themberchaud under control through their persuasions, psionics, and appeasements, and by speaking on his behalf with others. They also secretly had the responsibility of slaying the Wyrmsmith before he grew too strong, and of replacing him with a new and more pliable hatchling. In these matters, Gartokkar led the Keepers and liaised with Themberchaud, such as by introducing visitors to him.\nIn the late 1400s DR, the Gray Ghosts thieves guild stole a red dragon egg, one intended to hatch a new Wyrmsmith, and Gartokkar and the Keepers became distracted by their renewed war on the thieves. The Keepers captured and executed the Gray Ghost leader, but he never gave up the eggs hiding place and they were shamed by their failure. In response, the Keepers refocused their security around the dragons lair and explored other options. Gartokkar hired talented mercenaries within the city, but Themberchaud too would try to recruit them as his agents, while Gartokkar would then interrogate them as to the dragons intentions. The Keepers might also have fought an open battle with the Gray Ghosts at this time, with Gartokkar battling a spectator.\nDue to the demon incursion and the madness spread by the demon lords, Gartokkar grew paranoid obsessed with the Gray Ghosts, remaining convinced they were somehow behind it and refusing to hear all evidence to the contrary, calling it a product of delusion, ignorance, or falsehoods."
