Private '''Wilfred''' was a male [[human]] living in [[Neverwinter]] in [[1479 DR]], serving as soldier in the [[Neverwinter Guard]].

==History==
Under orders from Sergeant [[Knox]], he fought against an [[undead]] horde commanded by [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] during [[the Siege of Neverwinter]]. He was the first to meet a new [[adventurer]] arriving in the city. He led the adventurer to Lt. [[Josef Linkletter]]'s camp and later fought beside the adventurer against the undead during [[the Battle of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]]. He was killed by Valindra herself during the battle.

==Legacy==
An small shrine was built in the place of his death, as the people of Neverwinter never forgot about his sacrifice to save the city from the undead.
