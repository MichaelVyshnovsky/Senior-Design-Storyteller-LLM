Private Wilfred was a male human living in Neverwinter in 1479 DR, serving as soldier in the Neverwinter Guard.
Under orders from Sergeant Knox, he fought against an undead horde commanded by Valindra Shadowmantle during the Siege of Neverwinter. He was the first to meet a new adventurer arriving in the city. He led the adventurer to Lt. Josef Linkletters camp and later fought beside the adventurer against the undead during the Battle of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge. He was killed by Valindra herself during the battle.
An small shrine was built in the place of his death, as the people of Neverwinter never forgot about his sacrifice to save the city from the undead.
