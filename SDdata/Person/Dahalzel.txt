'''Dahalzel''' was a [[Bedine]] warrior of the [[Raz'hadi]] tribe who lived in the desert of [[Anauroch]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was described as being rather "brawny".

==History==
Dahalzel fought in the vanguard during the [[Battle of the Fissures]] in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}. During the battle, Dahalzel had a spell cast upon his ''[[jambiya]]'' by the witch [[Ruha]] that made it appear as if there were eight times as many Bedine as were actually present. This granted them a great edge as they charged the [[Zhentarim]] and their [[asabi]]s.
