'''Bichan Rarkat''' was one of the Cloakmasters of [[Esmeltaran]] for the [[Shadow Thieves]] around [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Bichan's parents were killed when he was ten and soon he become a thug for the Shadow Thieves. He made a career in the local guild of enforcers and thugs until he ascended to the status of guildmaster. When his boss died in a bizarre accident involving a [[rope]] in a [[festhall]], Bichan was promoted to Cloakmaster.

==Personality==
Bichan never forgot his humble beginnings, preferring plain and simple clothes like any ordinary half-orc on the street. He, however, emanated an air of authority. Bichan had a good relationship with the other Cloakmaster of Esmeltaran and had a firm control over his operations.
