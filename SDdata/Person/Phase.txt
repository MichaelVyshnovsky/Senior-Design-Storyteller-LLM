'''Phase''' was an agent of the [[Zhentarim]], temporarily allied with [[The Guild]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Maybe you can set your sights on a dukedom next, eh?''|Phase}}

==Description==
Phase was a light-skinned [[rock gnome]] with long brown hair and hazel eyes. He wore a monk's garb, dyed in greens and yellows â€“ the colors of the Zhentarim, and was armed with [[dagger]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] of The Guild forged a temporary alliance with the Zhentarim during the strife that was brought on by the war with the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. Phase was among the Zhentish mercenaries hired by Nine-Fingers to hold the Guild's territories being claimed by the man known as the [[Stone Lord]]. Phase disliked Nine-Fingers looking down on the Zhentarim hirelings and was ready to join [[Roah Moonglow]] and [[Friol]] in their attempts to usurp the Guild for the Zhentarim. It was unrecorded if the Zhents' takeover was successful nor whether Phase survived the guild war.
