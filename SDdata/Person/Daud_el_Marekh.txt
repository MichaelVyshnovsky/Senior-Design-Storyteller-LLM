Ship captain
Daud yn Khadil el Marekh was the last bakkal of the Marekh Dynasty and the First Age of Calimshan.
Daud was originally a ship captain, but when the Sunrise Plague of  wiped out nearly the entire population of Calimport, this left him as the surviving heir of his family.
Daud ruled as bakkal for twelve years, but his power grew weaker and weaker, as few were willing to live in the former capital of Calimshan after the plague.
