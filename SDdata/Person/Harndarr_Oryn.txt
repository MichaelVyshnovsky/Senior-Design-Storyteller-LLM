Harndarr Oryn was the High Mornmaster of the temple of Lathanders Light.
Harndarr had a short and stocky build such that some believed he might have dwarven blood in his veins. Although he walked with the assistance of a stick, Harndarr was a confident and melodious orator.
Possessed of the wits to use his charm judiciously, Harndarr was one who liked to bring hope and a sense of renewal to the people of Dagger Falls.
