Andrella was the head barmaid of the Beached Leviathan, one of the most popular taverns of Neverwinter in the late years of the 15 century DR.
Andrella was usually described as a prim, proper lady.
As the head barmaid of the Beached Leviathan, Andrella managed the day-to-day affairs of the inn and tavern. Because of that, the other staff members referred to her as the "Mate" or the "First Mate", something that she accepted as a bittersweet joke. She was also very protective of Harrag, the Beached Leviathans owner, trying to protect him from Dagult Neverembers plots whenever possible.
At some point before 1479 DR, Andrellas husband was killed because some gambling debts, and she lost everything. Sometime later, she met Harrag, who, out of compassion, hired her to be a barmaid in the then recently opened Beached Leviathan. Over time, Andrella fell in love with Harrag, but never confessed her true feelings because of Harrags "free spirit" personality.
In 1479 DR, a group of Ashmadai cultists summoned two devils and attacked the Beached Leviathan, mind-controlling some of the patrons present at the moment. Andrella was present during the fight, but luckily was saved by a group of adventurers.
