'''Bandagh''' was a [[orc]] in the [[Doomvault]] dungeon in [[1486 DR]].

==History==
Bandagh was one of the many [[Chosen]] captured by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] and transported to the Doomvault dungeon for experiments. More specifically, he was the chosen of [[Yurtrus]], a minor god of the [[orc pantheon]]. Bandagh was freed from his chains by the heroes of [[Daggerford]] but he was pockmarked by years of disease.
