Bhevek Grimshackle was a halfling jailer at Grimshackle Jail near Phlan in 1489 DR.
Bhevek and his brother were only interested in money. He was filthy and bedraggled like his brother.
Bhevek and his brother Ukharim Grimshackle opened Grimshackle Jail, where they took criminals whom they ransomed to the highest bidder.
In 1489 DR, Bhevek permitted, for some money, an adventuring party to interrogate Gray Patriotss member Rathene Fel. Afterward, the adventurers dealt with a planned prison break.
