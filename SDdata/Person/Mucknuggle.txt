Mucknuggle was an elderly duergar who worked in Mithral Hall, during the reign of Haerinvureem.
The dwarf had a long gray beard.
Mucknuggle was a member of Clan Bukbukken under the command of the shadow dragon Shimmergloom.
When on patrol, the guard wore mithral chainmail and fought with a broadsword and shield.
In 1356 DR, Mucknuggle encountered Drizzt DoUrden and Artemis Entreri in the lower tunnels of Mithral Hall. In a later skirmish, Mucknuggle was killed when the assassin put a dagger through his eye when Drizzt showed the dwarf mercy.
