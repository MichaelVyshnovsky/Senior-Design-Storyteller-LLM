He may have joined a party of adventurers in their journey to Menzoberranzan.\nThe deep gnome could be found in the Temple of Dumathoin deep beneath Icewind Dale, which was populated by derro. Vlakverdling was an offering \"present\" from the drow to the derro to cement their pact. \nA slow-acting poison coursed through the deep gnomes veins, which could be cured only through the use of a fungus grown by the myconids."
