'''Elmerth Willowit''' was a [[half-elven]] [[thief]] assistant of [[Mortimer Mittlemer]], an [[illusionist]] con-artist from [[Ravens Bluff]], the Living City in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Elmerth admired Mortimer Mittlemer's intelligence and strove to become just as sharp one day. He trusted Mortimer and believed when the spouses told him all large pieces of [[jade]] were the best loot the group collected and smaller games being the only petty payment Mittlemers took. Despite being a thief, Elmerth never backstabbed his victims, believing that attacking someone from behind was wrong. However, he had no reservations about attacking individuals from the front, even if Elmerth was being ''[[invisible]]'' at the time.

==Possessions==
The thief wore an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[leather armor]] and was armed with a magical ''+2'' [[dagger]]. He carried ''[[dust of disappearance]]'', a small pack of [[candy]], a [[silver]] necklace, as well as his share of the loot – jade and [[quartz]] chunks.

==History==
Elmerth began his career as a member of Ravens Bluff's thieves' guild – [[Four Ravens]]. His membership was cut abruptly when he attempted to pickpocket valuables from a man named [[Ren (Ravens Bluff)|Ren]], who turned out to be one of the most prolific thieves of Raves Bluff. Elmerth fled the city in shame and soon after met [[Marilyn Mittlemer|Marilyn]] and Mortimer Mittlemer, in fact, by falling for one of their scams. He quickly joined the spouses in their illicit activities after they found out of Elmerth's thieving skills.

During a spring or summer of the mid-14{{th}} century DR, Elmerth joined Mittlemers on a scam aimed at traveling adventurers. Mortimer trained seven [[canaries]] with his magical [[ring]] and staged a scorched patch of grass to convince travelers he was a [[platinum dragon]]. Then he would approach travelers and ask them to support some faraway country's strife and ask for donations of [[gold]] and [[gem]]s to pay for the goodly nation's defenses against evil. As the adventurers were distracted, Marilyn and Elmerth snuck to the victims and pickpocketed any remaining valuables from them. If Marilyn failed to lift the loot, she signaled her husband with a [[mirror]], slipping away with the use of her ''cloak of elvenkind'' or a ''potion of flying''.

During a spring or summer of the mid-14{{th}} century DR, a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff, the Living City, came across the charlatan while traveling the forest. The result and successes of the interaction remained unrecorded. However, Mortimer was ready to use magic to scare adventurers into donating or fleeing using ''dust of disappearance''. Elmerth used the same magical substance to sneak up on the victims of the scams. During that time, Mortimer Mittlemer and his wife used swindled treasure to invest in a certain lending institution and a popular tavern in Ravens Bluff.

The half-elf hoped to remain with the spouses for several more months until he got more confident to embark on solo scams and thievery.
