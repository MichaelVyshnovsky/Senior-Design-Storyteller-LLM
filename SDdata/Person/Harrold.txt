'''Harrold''' was a commoner from the town of [[Trademeet]] who visited, the capital of [[Amn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Mind you, it wasn't a complete loss. There was that rather showy display of magic when that wizard blew his top earlier. That was rather invigorating, that was.''|Harrold}}

==Relationships==
Harrold and his wife shared a relationship of snappy comments, quips, and complaints aimed at each other. Harrold teased his wife because she "screamed at the sight of a [[squirrel]]."

==History==
in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Harrold, how wife Mrs. Harrold and their children traveled from Trademeet to [[Athkatla]] to visit a circus at the center of the [[Athkatla/Center District|Center District]], in [[Waukeen's Promenade]]. Unfortunately, the circus tent fell victim to a mad [[gnome]] [[illusionist]] [[Kalah]], who transformed the tent's interior into a fanciful tower filled with guests and performers, ensorcelled to appear as monsters. To the couple's disappointment and outrage, they were not allowed into the tent and ended up waiting for the crisis to reopen, despite the children losing any interest by that point. As they waited, the spouses witnessed a spell battle between [[archmage]] [[Jon Irenicus]] and [[Cowled Wizards]] that collapsed part of the amphitheater. Mrs. Harrold was terrified of the occurrence, while Harrold himself found it awfully entertaining. Harrold thought that despite the ride being awfully bumpy and uncomfortable, they ought to take the next carriage back to Trademeet, while Mrs. Harrold refused to leave until they were allowed into the tent.
