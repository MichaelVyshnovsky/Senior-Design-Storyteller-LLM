Sedric was a talented entertainer from Phlan who could often be seen performing in the bazar on the Podol Plaza in 1369 DR.
Sedric often was performing, dressed in colorful outfits, while juggling lit torches, balancing on a wheel of a cart or a wagon, and singing a ballad or some other popular ditty.
In 1369 DR, the entertainer unknowingly provided a helpful distraction for a thief Kestrel for several months straight during her stay in Nat Wylers Bell. So much that Kestrel jokingly thought of paying the bard a commission on there cut-pursing.
