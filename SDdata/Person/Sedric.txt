'''Sedric''' was a talented entertainer from [[Phlan]] who could often be seen performing in the bazar on the [[Podol Plaza]] in [[1369 DR]].

==History==
Sedric often was performing, dressed in colorful outfits, while juggling lit [[torch]]es, balancing on a wheel of a cart or a wagon, and singing a ballad or some other popular ditty.

In 1369 DR, the entertainer unknowingly provided a helpful distraction for a [[thief]] [[Kestrel]] for several months straight during her stay in [[Nat Wyler's Bell]]. So much that Kestrel jokingly thought of paying the bard a commission on there cut-pursing.
