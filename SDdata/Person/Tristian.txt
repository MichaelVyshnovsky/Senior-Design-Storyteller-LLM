Knight Commander Tristian was a dutiful cleric who joined the Shining Crusade during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Tristian was a devout follower of the Lady of Strategy, the Red Knight, as well as the Shining Lady, Caelar Argent.
He was also an avid gambler, and thoroughly enjoyed the strategic game of coroniir.
Tristian was good friends with Halasan, who served as Vigilant of the waterdhavian City Guard. The two parted ways when the War of the Shining Crusade erupted, each choosing an opposing side in the conflict.
Tristian was present at Dragonspear Castle just prior to the final battle of the Shining Crusade.
