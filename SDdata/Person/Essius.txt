Essius was a gnomish Harper who followed the High Harper Jaheira to the Shadow-cursed lands in the late 15 century DR.
Essius was a pale-skinned and blond-haired gnome with light stubble on his face. He wore a leather armor and was armed with a single rapier.
In the , Jaheira was alerted to the mysterious return of Ketheric Thorm, now a leader of a cultist army that worshiped the Absolute. Harper Essius was one of the agents who accompanied Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed lands surrounding the Moonrise Towersâ€”General Thorms seat of power.
When a group of True Souls arrived at the Last Light Inn, which the Harpers had claimed as a temporary base, Essius was among those present for the events that followed. Shortly after their arrival, Essius was locked in an argument with Ulthred, one of the Flaming Fists who served counselor Florrick, Duke Ulder Ravengard. After the Dukes abduction by the Absolute, Essius and other Harpers waited for Jaheiras orders, while the Fists waited for counselor Florricks word. It was unknown if Harper Essius survived the war with the Absolute he mightve perished after the Last Light Inn was consumed by the darkness or else he survived with the rest, storming the Moonrise Towers to end General Thorms reign.
