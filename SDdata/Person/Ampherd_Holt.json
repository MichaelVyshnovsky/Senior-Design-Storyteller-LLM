        "mainbody": "Ampherd Holt was a Zhentarim cleric of Tempus at the Citadel of the Raven in 1367 DR. \nAmpherd had an unbalanced mind, being in permanent state of battle madness. However, his sermons about the glory received from death in battle became very popular among the soldiers, and many considered Ampherd their chaplain. Boruse Temlor hated him for his popularity, and Kandar Milinal distrusted him because of his craziness."
