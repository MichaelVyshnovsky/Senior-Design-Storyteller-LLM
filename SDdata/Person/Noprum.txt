Noprum was a duergar merchant in Gracklstugh in 1484 DR.
Noprum traded weapons between Gracklstugh and Blingdenstone.
In 1484, traveling to Blingdenstone just after the start of the War of the Silver Marches, a group of drow attacked and slaughtered Noprums party without reason. Only Noprum managed to escape and arrived near the deep gnome city.
