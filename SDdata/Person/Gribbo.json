It was around that time that Gribbo caught her very own \"Pigeon\", a rather famous bard by the name of Volothamp Geddarm. Gribbo had Volo perform recitations in front of her fellow Absolutists. For the occasion he crafted an ode to their leader, Dror Ragzlin.\nGribbo knew she should hand over her prized \"Pidge\" to her superior Minthara Baenre, but was so captivated by his charm she could not bring herself to let him go."
