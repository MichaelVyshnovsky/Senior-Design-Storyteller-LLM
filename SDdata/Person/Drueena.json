        "mainbody": "Drueena was the green hag who dwelt on a \"haunted\" island in Northwest Faer√ªn in the late 15 century DR.\nDrueena appeared almost human with a gaunt, pale face. The hag carried herself as if she were old and frail, putting her weight on a cane of polished birchwood. She had long black nails and brown waist-long hair braided with tiny critter skulls, feathers, and gems. Drueena wore a hooded cloak and a green velvet dress of mosses and fungi. Her pale flesh was decorated with tattoos. A red flower tattoo was on one arm, while the other was decorated with an image of a bird with a broken neck.\nLike other green hags, Drueena had access to a collection of spells, including the ability to turn invisible. She controlled corrupted vegetations and wielded enthralling magics. Drueena could see through others lies, seeing though them, detecting their thoughts and emotions.\nAt one point in the late 1490s DR, Drueena appeared on an unnamed island on the Sword Coast in the north, not far from a tiny village. Her hut lair was located within a cavern at the islands center. From there, the hag spread murderous choking vines covered in black oily secretions. Her plants killed off birds and small animals on the island. Her presence gave the island the reputation of being haunted among locals, and with time, they began hearing voices calling them to the island, asking for help. Many people went missing on the island, becoming the hags meals, and the village hired an amateur sorcerer named Simon Aumar to investigate and rescue the missing villagers.\nWhen the sorcerer failed to return, Del and Grace found a band of \"adventurers\" to go searching for their friend and drinking buddy named Feltin. The heroes hired for the task were Edgin Darvis, Holga Kilgore, and Forge Fitzwilliam. The band found Simon wrapped by Drueenas vines still alive. Together, they faced the hag in her cavern. Drueena was not alone. She wore an enchanted golden ring that contained magics used to sling spells and enthralled a roper that followed the witchs every command. Eventually, Simon the sorcerer dispelled the hags magics, releasing the roper who did not hesitate to end Drueenas life. With the green hags demise, the vines began to die off, lifting the \"haunted curse\" from the island."
