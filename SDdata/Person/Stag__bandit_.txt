'''Stag''' was a thuggish bandit who operated in and around [[Yhaunn]] in [[1373 DR]].

==Description==
He was an aggressive and unpleasant man, and wielded a [[short sword]] in combat. He was much more talkative than his companion [[Drik]].

==Relationships==
Stag was a close associate of Drik, and took the leader role of the pair. He was also on good terms with the other disreputable patrons of [[Cutter's Dip]], such as [[Noyle]], [[Kor (Yhaunn)|Kor]], and [[Lahumbra Sashtyn]]. He was fond of calling Feena 'red bird' while menacing her.

==History==
In [[Eleasis]] of [[1373 DR]], he and Drik attempted to waylay [[Feena Archwood]] outside of Yhaunn, not knowing she was a [[werewolf]] and a [[priestess]] of [[Sel√ªne]]. She defeated the two of them handily with her unarmed skills and [[divine magic]], and left them unconscious outside the city.

A [[tenday]] later, Stag and Drik came across Feena again by chance at the Cutter's Dip tavern. This time, they turned the bar patrons against her by claiming she was a manipulative robber and a [[wild mage]], and easily had her at their mercy as they tormented her with a cruel game of [[Dip's Stagger]]. This was interrupted by [[Keph Thingoleir]], who rescued Feena purely out of personal disdain for Stag, and during a brief unarmed brawl Feena crushed his groin with her knee, leaving him incapacitated on the floor.
