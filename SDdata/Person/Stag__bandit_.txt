Stag was a thuggish bandit who operated in and around Yhaunn in 1373 DR.
He was an aggressive and unpleasant man, and wielded a short sword in combat. He was much more talkative than his companion Drik.
Stag was a close associate of Drik, and took the leader role of the pair. He was also on good terms with the other disreputable patrons of Cutters Dip, such as Noyle, Kor, and Lahumbra Sashtyn. He was fond of calling Feena red bird while menacing her.
In Eleasis of 1373 DR, he and Drik attempted to waylay Feena Archwood outside of Yhaunn, not knowing she was a werewolf and a priestess of Sel√ªne. She defeated the two of them handily with her unarmed skills and divine magic, and left them unconscious outside the city.
A tenday later, Stag and Drik came across Feena again by chance at the Cutters Dip tavern. This time, they turned the bar patrons against her by claiming she was a manipulative robber and a wild mage, and easily had her at their mercy as they tormented her with a cruel game of Dips Stagger. This was interrupted by Keph Thingoleir, who rescued Feena purely out of personal disdain for Stag, and during a brief unarmed brawl Feena crushed his groin with her knee, leaving him incapacitated on the floor.
