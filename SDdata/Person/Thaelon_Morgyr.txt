'''Thaelon Morgyr''' was a businessman and investor from [[Baldur's Gate]] and later [[Athkatla]], who owned a wide array of businesses in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was a quiet, solemn man who did not draw attention to himself and largely lived without being noticed despite his power and wealth.

==Abilities==
Thaelon possessed an extraordinary intelligence and far-sighted sense of planning, enabling him to manage his projects most effectively.

==Activities==
Thaelon owned many businesses that insinuated themselves into the gaps between other businesses, acting as a middle-man for a great many enterprises. He found this niche by the careful creation and analysis of highly detailed [[merchants' map]]s that located the weak-points in trade routes and production lines, and offered opportunities for the process to be refined and made more efficient, or simply insert himself to take advantage. His businesses did not include workshops that made goods or shops that sold them to the public, rather, he accrued his [[coin]]s by handling the goods and services for those that did. In the esteemed sage [[Elminster]]'s opinion, what Thaelon and his ilk did was "grazing," and [[Amn]] was "a country of far too many grazers."

==Relationships==
Thaelon never married and had no kin, claiming that building a family and raising children to be "inefficient, by nature." He instead built up a wide range of friendly business contacts "to build up trust, not obligations or liabilities," and was quite contented by such a life. [[Amnian]] [[adventurer]]s who worked for him found that he hired them not just to guard his assets, but to tell tales of adventure that he could live through vicariously.

==History==
Originally of Baldur's Gate and later of Athkatla, Thaelon quietly built up his business empire throughout his life, assembling a collection of merchants' maps that he designed himself and updated regularly. He came to fame on his death as the examination of his assets found his hundreds of custom merchants' maps, and an estimation of his total wealth came to at least 16,000,000 [[gold piece]]s. The late 14{{th}} and early 15{{th}} centuries DR briefly saw merchants using "doing a Thaleon" to indicate a method that saves time, money, or labor, while "proper Morgyr-work" meant a slick and savvy business tactic.
