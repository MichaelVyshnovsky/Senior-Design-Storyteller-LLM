        "mainbody": "enthar Taerhamoos was an archmage in the midâ€“-8 century DR.\nHe was a tall man, and wore a black cloak, with rich robes underneath and a gem-studded medallion.\nHe had a years-long enmity with the mage Umbregard. He was served by many golems.\nHe could cast chain lightning, and a spell akin to teleport, as well as some spell that granted him the ability to phase through materials. Another of his spells allowed him to hurl a deadly sphere of purple flames.\nHe had an enchanted medallion he could use to steady and augment his spells. He was the master of Phoenix Tower. He was also carrying a wand of some sort.\nAt the start of the Chaos of the Art in spring of the , Tenthar Taerhamoos barricaded himself in Phoenix Tower, and had his golems dig trenches right until they decayed into nothing.\nAbout two tendays later, Tenthar Taerhamoos sought out the counsel of Kadeln Parosper in the House of the Ladystar, which had its gates closed, as a mob had formed just outside. Unable to cross the gates with his spells, he learned only that the priests of Mystra knew no more than he did about the Art, and was attacked by the mob he retaliated with chain lightning before teleporting away. Back at his home, he teleported to the forest near Starmantle after learning someone had used a portal near Tangletrees to go there, suspecting the elves were on the move. He brought with himself a wedge of cheese.\nAt the woods near Starmantle, in what was then the Dead Place, he ambushed a number of Sharran Dreadspells who were distracted fighting the elven wizard Starsunder, and Tenthars rival of many years, Umbregard of Galadorna. His deadly spell appeared to cause some feedback, causing the death of Dread Sister Avroana all the way back in the House of Holy Night. They later shared a drink with Elminster Aumar, a Chosen of Mystra, who came to heal them on Mystras behalf."
