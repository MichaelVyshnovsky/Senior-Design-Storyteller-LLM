Melanith (also spelled Melinith
Queen Melanith took a crinti named Sadalar as her consort. She had a daughter named Ausitil.
After Sadalar perished during the attack of Aventine, Melanith took Nym Inthigg as her consort. They had four children together.
Melanith became queen of Dambrath when her aunt Cathakay Shintar perished while fighting a gold dragon. One of her firsts acts as queen was to decree that men would be responsible for the defense of the kingdom against growing threats from Unther, Mulhorand, or other nations.
Though Dambrath had been ruled by females for more than 200 years, the complete split between men and women occurred during Melaniths reign when she announced that men would only have power over other men. Her decree was backed by the priestesses of Loviatar.
Melanith ruled Dambrath for 156 years. Her daughter became queen upon her death.
Queen Melanith was once saved from drowning by dolphins in the Bay of Dancing Dolphins. After that harrowing experience she decreed that dolphins were a protected species within Dambrath.
