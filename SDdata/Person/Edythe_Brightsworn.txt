Lady '''Edythe Brightsworn''' was a knight of [[Lathander]] that proved her devotion to the Morninglord during the latter half of the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She was a devout [[paladin]] of Lathander who accumulated a fair amount of wealth that she used to carry out a holy quest in her god's name.

==Possessions==
Lady Brightsworn commissioned the ''[[Circlet of the Cynosure]]'', a magical headband that offered her protection from [[charm]] magic and debilitating fear.

==History==
Some time around the late 1260's [[DR]], Lady Brightsworn brought together a group of warriors to hunt down one particularly powerful [[vampire]]. The group traced the undead fiend to the [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]], the graveyard district of [[Waterdeep]], and ventured into the subterranean tunnels that held its lair.

The vampire slaughtered nearly every member of the expedition, one after the other, including Lady Brightsworn. Only one member survived, leaving the collapsed tunnels carrying the lady's enchanted circlet. The whereabouts of the vampire were entirely unknown.
