        "mainbody": "Minak al-Zafyi ran a small shop within the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nMinak was a tall and handsome elf.\nMinak sold exotic animals within the Grand Bazaar from his small tent. Customers could purchase monkeys, songbirds, falcons, partridges, cats, dogs, and peacocks. His most prized animal was a young elephant bird. Though he only kept smaller animals in his tent, he boasted that he could acquire any animal that a customer asked about.\nHe judged people based upon how his animals reacted to them. Thus, anyone well-received by his animals usually got a better deal.\nMinak owned a ring of mammal control and a net of snaring."
