        "mainbody": "The Breath of Winter was a mysterious, icy creature that hunted across Damara as of the late 15 century DR. Its true nature was unknown and hotly debated among local Damarans.\nThe monster was known to steal the heat from its prey, leaving only frozen husks to be discovered much later. Many believed that the monsters breath neutralized all heat.\nIt hunted both lone individuals and groups of creatures.\nThe monster appeared sometime after the melting of the Great Glacier began to reveal passages to the Frostfell, which was said to be infested with monsters previously unknown to Damara. By the , folk were discovering the remains of victims that appeared to have been slain by the monster many years prior.\nLocal tales that attempted to identify the monster ranged from a white dragon to undead&mdashperhaps chillborn zombies emerging from nearby Vaalathrim&mdashto a living blizzard to a giant carved from ice and clad in crystalline armor."
