        "mainbody": "The '''Breath of Winter''' was a mysterious, icy creature that hunted across [[Damara]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Its true nature was unknown and hotly debated among local [[Damaran]]s.",
        "History": "The monster appeared sometime after the melting of the [[Great Glacier]] began to reveal passages to the [[Auril's Teeth#Frostfell|Frostfell]], which was said to be infested with monsters previously unknown to Damara. By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, folk were discovering the remains of victims that appeared to have been slain by the monster many years prior.\n\nLocal tales that attempted to identify the monster ranged from a [[white dragon]] to [[undead]]&mdash;perhaps [[chillborn zombie]]s emerging from nearby [[Vaalathrim]]&mdash;to a living blizzard to a [[giant]] carved from ice and clad in crystalline [[armor]]."
