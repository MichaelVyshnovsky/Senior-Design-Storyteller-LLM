'''Jaccob''' was a [[halfling]] [[smuggler]] and [[thief]] turned tourist guide in the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Oh yes, yes. There aren't to many tourists here though... It almost seems as if there are more guides than tourâ€”...''|Overheard at Jaccob's eulogy}}

==Description==
Jaccob was a {{SI|3'6"|ft-in|long=yes}} tall hin who weighed {{SI|67|lb|k|long=yes}}. He had brown hair and hazel eyes.

==Abilities==
The halfling used [[club]]s, [[dagger]]s, and [[sling]]s in battle. He was proficient in appraisal, [[rope]] use, and could write and read in [[Common]].

==Possessions==
Jaccob's possessions included [[lock pick]]s, [[charcoal]], [[aniseed]], a hand [[lamp]], hollow [[boots]], a false [[scabbard]], a ''[[mouse cart]]'', three pet [[mice]], and an [[enchanted]] ''+2'' dagger called ''[[Longtooth]]''.

==History==
Jaccob made a name for himself working as a smuggler to and from the northern city of [[Luskan]]. His career ended in earning a large bounty on his head, forcing the halfling to flee north to the frigid Ten Towns. Some claimed he had been the second halfling to ever visit the Ten Towns. Jaccob found a fleeting temporary home while apprenticing under [[Henry Coldwater]] as a tourist guide at the [[Breakneck Resort]]. Henry saw potential and initiative in the newcomer. However, Breakneck Resort proved its name to the amateur [[snowskis|skier]]. Only the most proficient skiers and [[orc]]s returned from the slopes unharmed. A short time later, Henry Coldwater hosted a eulogy for the dearly departed Jaccob the halfling.
