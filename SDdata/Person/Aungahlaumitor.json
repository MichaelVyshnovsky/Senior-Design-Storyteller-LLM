        "mainbody": "'''Aungahlaumitor''', sometimes referred to as '''Ongall''', was the [[blue dragon]] who aided the [[Netherese]] [[Arcanist]] [[Larloch]] in his escape from the flying enclave of [[Jiksidur]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028234155/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/So_Saith_Ed_Part25_(2010-2016).zip| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 11-30-2021| date = 11-30-202}}",
        "Description": "Ongall was a gargantuan ancient blue dragon and a close ally of Larloch, the Shadow King of Netheril. It was the biggest blue dragon to have ever grace the skies of [[Toril]]. Its long and slender tail ended in a single huge barb. Its head was covered in blue-black scales, with two deeply-set eyes that glowed with malice. Another unique feature of the dragon was a crest, or by some accounts, a spiny fin that stretched from the snout to rear up in the middle of the body.",
        "Personality": "The wyrm reportedly enjoyed flying through the eyes of deadly lightning storms, with the wild electricity of the sky being captured by its many magic items. Aungahlaumitor did not tolerate other [[dragon]]s and used all spells at its disposal to destroy his scaled opponents, forcing them through magic to reveal the locations of lairs and draconic treasure hoards. it was believed that Ongall collected dozens of such hoards and had them guarded by beings magically bound to the lairs.",
        "Abilities": "By the time Ongall became familiar with Larloch, the wyrm was already a powerful creature who wielded magics far exceeding that of his kin. The ancient blue dragon was a powerful spellcaster, on par with the strongest of the Netherese arcanist. It was believed, Aungahlaumitor used its treasure trove to create and empower a horde of various [[enchanted]] items the wyrm grafted on its enormous body. These magic items were intricately linked, creating an arcane network that made Ongall a deadly juggernaut in battle.",
        "History": "Aungahlaumitor and Larloch remained close acquittance, exchanging spell formulas and weaving new magics together for three decades before the destruction of Larloch's flying [[Netherese enclave]] in [[-339 DR]]. Ongall's allyship with Larloch was so close some believed that the gargantuan beast carried and guarded the [[lich]]'s ''[[phylactery]]'' when it needed protection from the Larloch's many enemies. However, that could've been a mere legend.\n\nJiksidur's fall came in -339 DR, when the citadel hovered hover [[east Faerûn]] to spy on the rival empires of [[Narfell]] and [[Raumathar]]. A [[contingency]] spell warned Larloch that Jiksidur was facing impending doom, and he fled the city riding on Aungahlaumitor's back. Soon after, Netheril suffered [[Karsus's Folly]], all magic failed, and Jiksidur fell from the sky. It flipped over in its descent and crashed upside down into the earth, utterly destroyed under its weight.\n\nIn the spring of the {{YearlinkName|14}}, Aungahlaumitor was seen flying somewhere to the southeast, away from [[Faerûn]]. The dragon remained missing as of the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]], which could imply that the ancient wyrm was dead or left Toril."
