'''Aurgus''' was a [[dwarf]] hero of the [[Earthspur Mountains]] in [[the Vast]] sometime before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}}

Aurgus once killed a [[remorhaz]] single-handedly in the mountain pass on [[Mount Aergurl]]. The local dwarves recalled the event in their lore.
