        "mainbody": "anese the Excitable was a wizard who lived in Ravens Bluff in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nPanese lived in a green two-story house on Magicians Row. It was the fifth of five houses.\nPanese had an owl familiar, smoked Old Troll tobacco, and was primarily a coffee drinker.\nCirca 1357 DR, Panese the Excitable and Norweg the Magnificent separately stole two minor magic items of historical importance from the city vaults at approximately the same time. Paneses owl left a feather at one of the vaults. Though the thieves were unidentified, suspicions and divinations tracked them to Magicians Row. The City Guard serving Regent of the Exchequer Vernon Condor only had time to search two of the five houses before they earned their bosss ire, so they tried to deduce the culprits from what they knew of the five wizards in the neighborhood."
