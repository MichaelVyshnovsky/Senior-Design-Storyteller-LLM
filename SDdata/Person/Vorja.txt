'''Vorja''' was a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] in the [[Doomvault]] dungeon in [[1486 DR]].

==Personality==
Vorja had very little loyalty to the Red Wizards.

==History==
Vorja was a Red Wizard assigned to the secret complex of Doomvault under [[Thaymount]]. However, in 1486 DR, he was found to be disloyal to his masters and was sentence to execution and placed in a cell guarded by some [[gargoyle]]s. Luckily for him, the heroes of [[Daggerford]] arrived and eventually freed him. Vorja easily betrayed his fellow Red Wizards, giving information about the dungeon to his liberators. Afterward, he might have joined [[Syranna]] and her cell of the [[Thayan Resurrection]].
