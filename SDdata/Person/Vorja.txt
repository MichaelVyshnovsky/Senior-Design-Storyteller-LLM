Vorja was a Red Wizard of Thay in the Doomvault dungeon in 1486 DR.
Vorja had very little loyalty to the Red Wizards.
Vorja was a Red Wizard assigned to the secret complex of Doomvault under Thaymount. However, in 1486 DR, he was found to be disloyal to his masters and was sentence to execution and placed in a cell guarded by some gargoyles. Luckily for him, the heroes of Daggerford arrived and eventually freed him. Vorja easily betrayed his fellow Red Wizards, giving information about the dungeon to his liberators. Afterward, he might have joined Syranna and her cell of the Thayan Resurrection.
