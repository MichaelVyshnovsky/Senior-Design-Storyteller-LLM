        "mainbody": "'''Thyaast Ammath''' was a [[wizard]] prodigy of the [[moon elven]] noble [[House Ammath]] who survived the [[Weeping War]] by transforming herself into a unique type of a [[Specter|spectral]] [[lich]].\n\n{{quote|''...Just remember the proper components... no... wait... yes! ...my head... my aching head... one more time ... it moved! ... decomposition... so little time...''|Thyaast Ammath in her mentally deteriorated state.}}",
        "Abilities": "Thyaast was naturally skilled in calligraphy, with her personal journal of over one thousand pages filled with powerful and beautiful script.",
        "Possessions": "Most if not all things that belonged to Thyaast Ammath were stored in her underground laboratory. It was hidden in the lowest parts of the [[Elven Catacombs]], across the hall from the chasm connecting the dungeon to the depths of the [[Underdark]]. Her spacious lair was behind two heavy stone doors, accentuated by two thick support columns on both sides of them. The lab consisted of numerous labs, halls, libraries, and storage spaces, while the main hall past the entrance doors was a large room with ancient tables, chairs, bookshelves filled with decaying tomes, baubles, and decorative items that dated to the glory days of Myth Drannor. Stone-laid walls were covered in cobwebs and an occasion decorative wall rug. After Thyaast embraced [[undeath]], her presence was palpable in the lab, making living visitors feel unease, with the stale air almost crackling with her wizardly powers.",
        "History": "Thyaast was born sometime before [[664 DR]], the Year of the Falling Petals. By 664 DR, she has already been considered a promising spellsummoner of Myth Drannor, respected for her arcane talents and noble heritage. After the death of [[Aravae Irithyl‎‎]], the city's Coronal Heiress Thyaast grieved the death of a beloved ruler. She, however, was optimistic for the City of Song's future and dedicated many pages in her journal to political opinions and thoughts on possible new leaders of Myth Drannor.\n\nDuring the years that led to the [[Weeping War]] of [[714 DR]], Thyaast started seeing ill omens of Myth Drannor's eventual demise. The main sign was the disbandment and flight of [[Sakaala of the Seven Rings]], the headmistress of the [[Incanistaeum]] However, according to the notes in the wizard's journal, she was completely unaware of the swelling danger of inevitable war and the growing [[Army of Darkness]].\n\nThyaast was present in Myth Drannor during the [[Weeping War]] that started in [[711 DR]] and culminated in the City of Song's destruction in [[714 DR]]. It was likely that she was encouraged to transform herself into a lich or some exotic form of lich-like spectral undead during the war. Thyaast wrote a vow in her journal that she will never flee the city she loved and promised to use her arcane research to develop spells she could use to defend her home. Eventually, Thyaast joined the fight that raged above her laboratory. The wizard emerged from the Elven Catacombs armed with ''[[Bloodflame]]'', a powerful spell of her creation. She flung the ''Bloodflames'' at the fallen defenders of Myth Drannor. The arcane magics leaped from body to body, raising the bodies that had gone cold.\n\nHowever, what followed remained a mystery. One thing was known for sure, she has discovered the new type of necromantic magic that brought the dead back to life. The last pages of the journal were covered in the wizard's fevered arcane formulas and scribbles, unintelligible to most.\n\nAfter the war, Thyaast returned to her lair and continued working on her deadly magics. What the necromancer did not know was the fact that her spectral lich transformation would cause mental degradation. Years flew by as Lady Ammath filled her laboratory with copious miswritten, partially incomplete, or damaged spell scrolls and [[potion]]s. Scrolls with the ''Bloodflame'' magic (also called ''[[mass resurrection]]''), were scribed on rotting [[papyrus]] and incomplete; prototype potions were untested and unpredictable; her attempt at crafting a ''[[wand of slay living]]'' was misenchanted and and was missing [[gem]]stones, just like her incomplete version of a ''[[ring of invisibility]]''.\n\nBy [[1369 DR]], Thyaast accumulated a small group of powerful undead servants and a [[dark naga]] slave who were guarding the library filled with the lich's faulty treasures."
