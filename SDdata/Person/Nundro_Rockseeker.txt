}}'''Nundro Rockseeker''' was a [[dwarf]] explorer in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the youngest of the three dwarf brothers who rediscovered [[Wave Echo Cave]].

==History==
Nundro and his brothers planned to re-open the lost mine near [[Phandalin]].

After finding its location, the dwarf was captured by [[Nezznar]] ''circa'' [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} and thrown in a jail cell in Wave Echo Cave. Nezznar believed that the dwarf knew more information than he initially led on, so spared him. He was interrogated by his [[drow]] captor a couple of times per day. After his capture, a [[doppelganger]] would assume his form to add leverage to the demands of Nezznar.

Nundro was later freed, and together with [[Gundren Rockseeker]], ran the mining operations at the cave.

==Relations==
He was the younger brother of both [[Tharden Rockseeker]] and Gundren Rockseeker.
