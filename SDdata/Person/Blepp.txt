Blepp was a kobold from the Dragons Rest cloister in the late 15 century DR.
With a keen instinct for peril, Blepp maintained a steadfast belief in his uncanny luck.
His most cherished possession was an ordinary dagger and he insisted it to be magical.
Blepp shared with three other kobolds a small monastic cell in the Dragons Rest cloister cut into the cliff face. Each of the four slept on individual hammocks. Just like all the other kobolds, he worked at night because of their sensitivity to sunlight.
Circa the , Blepp and the cloister gardener Tarak were attacked by zombies when they went fishing. At the point of near-death, they were rescued thanks to the timely aid of a group of adventurers. Yet Blepp was convinced that his good luck and his "magical" dagger spared him from an inevitable demise.
