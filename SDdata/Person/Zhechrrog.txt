In the , Zhechrrogs Stone Knives tribe discovered the shipwreck of the Vigilant on Omgars Teeth. The vessel belonged to SaSani of Samargol and her trade company. The surviving crew members, including Captain Lastri Kassireh and her First Mate Kadjin were captured, while many other injured sailors were slaughtered and used as food. When SaSani sent a band of adventurers to free the halfling captain, Zhechrrog pleaded with the heroes for her life, lying in broken Common about the evil Shattered Spear tribe forcing her tribe from Samarlogh and the tribe starving. Lastri Kassireh was the last surviving sailor, and she quickly revealed the Chieftans lies and how the goblins ate First Mate Kadjin. When Chieftain Zhechrrogs lies were exposed, she proudly proclaimed war and attacked the adventurers, ending up slain.
