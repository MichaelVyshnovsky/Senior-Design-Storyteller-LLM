        "mainbody": "Lady Darlethra Greatgaunt was an eccentric old noble lady in the late 15 century DR.\nShe liked to walk, and considered Suzail to be just about level with Westgate in its danger.\nShe liked to walk, and hunt. She was also a collector of curios. While in Suzail, she stayed in a rented suite.\nShe liked to walk, and always demanded the company of a War Wizard when walking through Suzail. The War Wizards, on their part, had little appetite for accompanying her.\nDarlethra Greatgaunt owned forty-six almost identical sapphire-trimmed dresses.\nIn the aftermath of the Council of the Dragon of late Mirtul in the , Lady Darlethra Greatgaunt was abed from a failed poisoning by an unknown party her guest Mirt, in turn, was impersonating Rhauligus Helderstone. The Marchioness Immerdusk and Harper Storm Silverhand was herself impersonating Lady Greatgaunt while she slept, and during this impersonation, she was accompanied in extended walks through the streets of Suzail by the fugitive mage Elminster Aumar, who impersonated instead the War Wizard Reldyk Applecrown.\nShe was later carried out from her with no mess or noise, by someone whom Storm Silverhand was certain to be a nobles agent acting in revenge against an enemy of Rauligus Helderstone, as Mirt had already come across one enemy of Rauligus before and gotten into deep trouble. The same person slew Lady Greatgaunts cook, leaving only her head for them to find."
