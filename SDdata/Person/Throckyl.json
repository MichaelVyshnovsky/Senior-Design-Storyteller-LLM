        "mainbody": "Jandur was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 14 century DR.\nAt some point after spring started in the , the Red Wizard Harnrim Starangh assaulted the armory of the sanctum where Vangerdahast dwelt after his retirement as Royal Mage of Cormyr. In doing so, he slew three mages one with a slaying-snake spell, another by twisting his shielding magic against himself into a paralyzing field, and a third with staeradder poison. He fled after using a spell that burned out all recollections from their minds, preventing their dead bodies from responding to any questioning.\nDarthym reported Jandur as dead to the War Wizard Huldyl Rauthur, a fellow War Wizard working in the sanctum.\nIn particular, Darthym noted that Throckyl had been blown apart, and his head was separated from the rest of his body. As the man bitten by a snake was not decapitated by any spells, Throckyl mustve been one of the two guardians of the inner sanctum, strongly implying that Harnrim Staranghs spell to burn away memories could also cause bodily destruction in some cases."
