        "mainbody": "'''Eeyal''' was a female [[tortle]] guide who operated out of [[Fort Beluarian]] in [[Chult]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "By the age of 17, Eeyal had traveled from the [[Snout of Omgar]] to Fort Beluarian on foot over the course of a year, had seen [[Lake Luo]], the garden palace of [[Nangalore]], the gorge of [[Ataaz Muhahah]], and even the ruins of [[Mezro]]. She had even seen the wreckage of ''[[The Narwhal]]'' and had befriended the [[weretiger]] that lived there.",
        "Personality": "Eeyal was seen as careful and wise, and quite cautious, constantly checking for traps when traveling in wilderness. She also had a healthy respect for the [[Flaming Fist]], and would recommend that people who employed her as a guide should acquire the necessary paperwork for exploring the jungle. She also disliked underground areas like most tortles, and utilized a pair of self-crafted goggles to shield her eyes from volcanic ash."
