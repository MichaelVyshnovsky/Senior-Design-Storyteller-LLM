'''Jorildyn''' was a [[half-elf]] battlemage and a member of the [[Circle of Reilloch Domayr]].

==Description==
The half-elf had a grey-streaked beard.

==History==
In [[Alturiak]] [[1374 DR]], Jorildyn survived the attack on the [[Tower Reilloch]]. After fighting alongside [[elves]] on many occasions, Jorildyn joined up with [[Seiveril Miritar]] in traveling to [[Faerûn]] to combat the [[daemonfey]] invasion.

In the final battle against the [[daemonfey]] at the [[Vale of Lost Voices]] Jorildyn tried to kill [[Malkizid]] himself but was instead killed by the fallen [[solar]].
