'''Maerwûn Venedel''' was a [[truenamer]] at the [[House of the Unnamed]] in [[Velprintalar]] in [[Aglarond]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Her truenaming abilities were full-fledged; she had access to all sorts of [[utterance]]s, even ''recitations'' and those of the ''lexicon of the perfected map''. She could also ''see the named'', an ability through which she used an effect akin to ''[[scrying]]'' on anyone whose personal [[true name]] she knew.

==Activities==
As of {{yearlink|1373}}, she led a study group on [[truespeak]] at the House of the Unnamed.
