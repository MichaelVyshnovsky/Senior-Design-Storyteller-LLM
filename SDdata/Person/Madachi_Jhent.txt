'''Madachi Jhent''' was a disgraced nobleman of [[Waterdeep]] who proclaimed himself the High Minister of [[Ao]] before being killed sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Madachi was an infamous individual in the City of Splendors whose story spread across Waterdeep like wildfire shortly after the [[Time of Troubles]]. He was a minor noble who lost all his wealth but delved into a delusion that convinced him to lead the new church after seeing a vision of [[Ao]], the High God of [[Toril]] in his [[cloak]]. He started his preaching career proselytizing to a pen of [[pig]]s and pronounced damnations on sinners who resided in a bowl of soup. Madachi's infamy came after he started preaching gibberish to a group of poor Waterdhavians who eventually became agitated. The High Minister kicked a homeless man in the face and that act somehow cured the poor wretch's blindness (as the penniless noble was wearing [[enchanted]] [[boots]] later known as ''[[A Mad Gent's Boots]]''). This miraculous deed attracted a gaggle of followers to the so-called "High Minister." New auditions to Madachi's church lacked the fire of insanity that ignited the "High Minister's" passionate Kicking Crusade across Waterdeep.

Miraculously, Madachi Jhent's kicks did not cause the crazed minister's demise, as his followers valiantly protected him. Eventually, as the Kicking Crusade continued, minister Jhent realized his kicks did no miracles as the victims of his kicks were not suffering from illness. However, another "miracle" was taking place. As Madachi helped his victims up from the streets, his [[gloves]], later known as ''[[A Mad Gent's Gloves]]'', cured those he touched. This attracted yet another wave of followers to the misguided church.

The High Minister of Ao spent several next days touching people after kicking them, spreading the healing "miracle." But his foolish luck ended when he kicked a grimly-armored [[cleric]] of [[Bane]] in the face. The cleric was a follower of then the dead god of hatred and tyranny and retaliated by throttling the dimwitted miracle dispenser. Madachi demanded to be unhanded because "no servant of a dead god is fit to touch a servant of Ao." Despite not having divine magics at his disposal, the priest of Bane handled the "High Minister" and his gaggle of lunatics with ease.
