        "mainbody": "beholder\nGavmogon, also known as the angry eye god to some of his lesser minions, was a beholder who had been transformed into a mindwitness following his enslavement to a colony of mind flayers. He menaced the region around Phandalin in the late 15 century DR, even coming to be seen as a threat among the fey and the other beholders in the area.\nHe had a large, glowing central eye around which danced his four smaller eyes.\nGavmogon was mentally unstable and driven by a need for revenge against his mind flayer captors, which turned into a wish to destroy all other creatures that would not bend to his will. He was drunk on his own power and prone to gloating.\nGavmogon controlled a massive artifact known as the hollow of dominion, an underground chamber that channeled psychic energy to allow the wielder to commune with the minds of everything within  Naturally, Gavmogon was highly protective of his control over the hollow of dominion and especially of its control device, the dominion rod.\nGavmogon worked to exert his will over the Phandalin region, believing that he had to prove his superiority by annihilating the minds of everything around him. He agitated monsters, spread madness, and caused chaos. His presence could be detected by some creatures in the form of \"eyes in the sky\".\nGavmogon was enslaved by the elder brain of a mind flayer colony based out of a crashed nautiloid in the Sword Mountains, who transformed him into a mindwitness and gave him potent psychic powers. He managed to escape from the mind control in the late 15 century DR upon discovering the hollow of dominion, which held far greater power than the elder brain. He soon began projecting his influence on the region, leading to strange magical occurrences and more aggressive monsters. The magical disturbances he caused had the effect of attracting a coven of hags to the area, intrigued by the mysterious powers that were disturbing the fey in the region.\nGavmogon personally extended his control over monsters of Crooked Forest. At one point while there, he came across and nearly wiped out a tribe of goblins. The survivors came to revere him as a god&mdashtheir \"angry eye god\"&mdasheven as he abandoned them. The tribe took on the name of the Angry Eye, and performed sacrifices in the name of their god as they awaited his return. During one of his trips to the Forest, we was briefly glimpsed by one of the gnolls captives, Alana Hallwinter.\nAbout a year after his initial escape from the mind flayers, This had the result of driving out a group of yuan-ti lairing in the mountains, who began conducting human sacrifices at a quarry near the Old Owl Well.\nGavmogon next began to enact his plan to use the hollow of dominion to inflict madness upon the town of Phandalin and the monsters in the surrounding area."
