Kerinda Lynnrenno was a member of the Shadow Council of Shadow Thieves and the Shade of Baldurs Gate around 1370 DR.
Kerinda was a former sellsword before joining the Shadow Thieves, where she made a career until ascending to the Shadow Council.
Kerinda was a nondescript but strong woman.
Kerindas public face was running a small festhall in Baldurs Gate. Here, she met many visitors, some friends from her past as a sellsword but many others her Shadow Thieves agents. Thank to her contacts and what her employees learned, nothing that happened in the Sword Coast escaped her knowledge.
