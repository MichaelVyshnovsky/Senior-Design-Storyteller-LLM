'''Kerinda Lynnrenno''' was a member of the [[Shadow Council]] of [[Shadow Thieves]] and the Shade of [[Baldur's Gate]] around [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Kerinda was a former sellsword before joining the Shadow Thieves, where she made a career until ascending to the Shadow Council.

==Personality==
Kerinda was a nondescript but strong woman.

==Activities==
Kerinda's public face was running a small festhall in Baldur's Gate. Here, she met many visitors, some friends from her past as a sellsword but many others her Shadow Thieves agents. Thank to her contacts and what her employees learned, nothing that happened in the [[Sword Coast]] escaped her knowledge.
