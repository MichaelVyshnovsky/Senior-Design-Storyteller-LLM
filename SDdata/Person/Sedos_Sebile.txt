'''Sedos Sebile''' was a member of the [[Neverwinter Nine]] in [[1372 DR]].


==Appearance==
Sedos had light skin and brown hair, and dressed in a green shirt underneath spiked [[leather armor]].

==Relationships==
Sedos was trusted by [[Nasher Alagondar]], Lord of [[Neverwinter]].

==History==
Sedos Sebile once was a rowdy youth in the bustling streets of [[Waterdeep]]. Later she became a daring adventurer in the [[Sword Mountains]].

Sedos appeared to have finally found her place in Neverwinter as she had become a respected member of Lord Nasher Alagondar's elite guard, the Neverwinter Nine. Sedos carried out her duties with a composure that would astound those who knew her in her earlier days.

During the outbreak of the [[Wailing Death]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Sedos was put in charge of [[Neverwinter Militia]] operations in the [[Neverwinter/Peninsula District|Peninsula District]] of Neverwinter. The district was plagued with escaped criminals from [[Neverwinter Prison]], having been freed by the Head Gaoler, [[Alaefin]]. When the [[Hero of Neverwinter]] came to investigate the plague, Sedos informed them of the situation, and directed them to find a way to enter the prison and deal with Alaefin.
