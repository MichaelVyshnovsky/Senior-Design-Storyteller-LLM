Otleo Ressmon, usually known as The Fat, was a male thief who was a member of the Shadow Council of the Shadow Thieves during the 14 century DR.
True to his nickname, Otleo was an exceptionally large man.
Otleo was a career man, rising through the ranks of the guild step by hard step, starting as a common thief. His duty was to control the guilds operations in Tethyr, where he posed as a prospering merchant.
His massive size was due to cursed item that had the same powers as a +3 ring of protection.
