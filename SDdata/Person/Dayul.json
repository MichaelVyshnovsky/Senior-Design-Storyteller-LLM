        "mainbody": "'''Dayul''' was one of the [[Blades of the Old Man]] as of {{yearlink|1374}}. On the night of [[Tarsakh 25]], they became aware of an intruder in [[Sentinelspire (fortress)|Sentinelspire]]. While they were looking out for the intruder, they came across [[Lewan]] and [[Ulaan]]. On the orders of [[Weilus]], they tried to get them to return to their room; however, this led to a fight. Dayul's wrist was broken by a hammer blow from Lewan; after he was disabled, it was only Ulaan's intervention that kept Dayul from taking revenge on the young man. He was slain by swarming [[killoren]] shortly after.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||35}}"
