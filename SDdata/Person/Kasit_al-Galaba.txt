==Personality==
Kasit was know for both his soothing voice and his gossiping tongue.

==Activities==
Anyone wishing to spread a rumor need only contact Kasit to have it course through Hiyal faster than a contagion. He held to one rule that he would never blashpeme the [[Alurah bint Asrah|Sultana]] or members of the royal family. The Sultana allowed him to live because of this rule.
