Kasit al-Galaba was an elven bard living in Hiyal around 1367 DR.
Kasit was know for both his soothing voice and his gossiping tongue.
Anyone wishing to spread a rumor need only contact Kasit to have it course through Hiyal faster than a contagion. He held to one rule that he would never blashpeme the Sultana or members of the royal family. The Sultana allowed him to live because of this rule.
