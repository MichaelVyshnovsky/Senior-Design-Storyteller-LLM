        "mainbody": "Queen Connomae was a fomorian who lived in the Feywild realm of Vor Thomil during the late 15 century DR.\nConnomae protected Vor Thomil and allowed passage between her realm and Omans Isle in the Moonshae Isles. She wished to eventually expand her realm onto Omans Isle and use that as a base to envelop the rest of the Moonshae archipelago. This would provide her with a large quantity of slaves that she would sent back to the Feywild and use during an assault on the city of Shinaelestra."
