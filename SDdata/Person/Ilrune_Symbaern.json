        "mainbody": "'''Ilrune Symbaern''' was the [[baelnorn]] of [[Symbaern]] in [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Ilrune was an [[elf]] wizard who chose to become the baelnorn of his family.\n\nAround [[1310 DR]], the evil [[Shadow Shields]] adventuring company entered his family's crypt and he fought them. However, in the battle, the entrance to the crypt collapsed, killing most of the adventurers. Ilrune gained from their bodies the fabled [[Crown of stars (item)|Crown of Stars]]. However, some of the adventurers rose as [[wight]]s and fought Ilrune again and again trying to recover the Crown.\n\nIn 1370 DR, he was trying to somehow defeat the wights for good.",
        "Activities": "Ilrune wandered his family's crypt protecting the tombs of his ancestors and descendants.",
        "Personality": "Even in [[undead|undeath]], Ilrune remained elegant, polite, and deadly. He enjoyed battle but always introduced himself politely to intruders. He agreed to give adventurers who'd arrived in peace some of his treasures in exchange for permanently destroying the Shadow Shields and even to give the Crown to a good-oriented wizard."
