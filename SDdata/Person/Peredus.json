        "mainbody": "Peredus the Great was an adventurer of goodly nature whose story became a well-known folk tale in the areas surrounding Daggerford in the late 14 century DR.\nThe most well-known item that Peredus owned was his holy avenger longsword often called the Sword of Peredus. Along with the blade, the hero carried a bag of holding, and enchanted +2 chainmail, and a gem.\nPeredus the Great was an adventuring hero and a caravan guard who became renowned for his selfless deeds and his enchanted sword. The legend claimed that he was traveling with a trade caravan as they were ambushed by villainous bandits just outside Daggerford in the place known as the Western Farmlands. Peredus fell defending the merchants, and his body was thrown into an old dried well.\nSubsequently, Peredus returned to haunt the well after his final resting place was taken over by a young black dragon Sulfurus. The wyrm used the dead caravan guards bones as a chewing toy, returning and chaining Peredus to the Prime Material plane as a restless spectre. Along with the dragon, undead Peredus was one more grave danger to anyone attempting to delve into the well searching for the heros enchanted sword.\nIn 1372 DR, a roguish adventurer Burnas Tellrot learned of the location of the well and hoped to plunder the legendary heros final resting place to finance his retirement. The halfling sent several would-be adventurers to their death as all of them were unsuccessful. Eventually, Burnas enroll the aid of the Hero of Daggerford. Once the adventurer descended into the well, they became trapped, with the only way out being the way through. Peredus the Great manifested himself, offering the hero a way out in exchange for release from the undead existence. The hero confronted the evil black dragon and recovered the bones of the fabled hero. The body was submerged into a magical pool nearby, sanctifying it and releasing the restless spirit of Peredus. Before his departure into the afterlife, Peredus told the Hero of an underwater way out - through a submerged cavern that led into the Wild Hills area outside of Daggerford."
