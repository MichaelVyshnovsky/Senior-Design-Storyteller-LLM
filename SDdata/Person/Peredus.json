        "mainbody": "'''Peredus the Great''' was an adventurer of goodly nature whose story became a well-known folk tale in the areas surrounding [[Daggerford]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Peredus the glorious,<br />His stature quite impervious,<br />Aside a well stood standing thus,<br />Without a hint of wariness.<br />Standing full of watchfulness,<br />Eldritch sword in readiness,<br />Great defender Peredus,<br />Would save us from the villainous.''|[[Jorey Fontalas]]}}",
        "Possessions": "The most well-known item that Peredus owned was his ''[[holy avenger]]'' [[longsword]] often called the ''[[Sword of Peredus]]''. Along with the blade, the hero carried a ''[[bag of holding]]'', and enchanted ''+2'' [[chainmail]], and a [[gem]].",
        "History": "Peredus the Great was an adventuring hero and a caravan guard who became renowned for his selfless deeds and his enchanted sword. The legend claimed that he was traveling with a trade caravan as they were ambushed by villainous bandits just outside [[Daggerford]] in the place known as the [[Western Farmlands]]. Peredus fell defending the merchants, and his body was thrown into an old dried well.\n\nSubsequently, Peredus returned to haunt the well after his final resting place was taken over by a young [[black dragon]] [[Sulfurus]]. The wyrm used the dead caravan guard's bones as a chewing toy, returning and chaining Peredus to the [[Prime Material plane]] as a restless [[spectre]]. Along with the dragon, undead Peredus was one more grave danger to anyone attempting to delve into the well searching for the hero's [[enchanted sword]].\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], a roguish adventurer [[Burnas Tellrot]] learned of the location of the well and hoped to plunder the legendary hero's final resting place to finance his retirement. The halfling sent several would-be adventurers to their death as all of them were unsuccessful. Eventually, Burnas enroll the aid of the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. Once the adventurer descended into the well, they became trapped, with the only way out being the way through. Peredus the Great manifested himself, offering the hero a way out in exchange for release from the undead existence. The hero confronted the evil black dragon and recovered the bones of the fabled hero. The body was submerged into a magical pool nearby, sanctifying it and releasing the restless spirit of Peredus. Before his departure into the afterlife, Peredus told the Hero of an underwater way out - through a submerged cavern that led into the [[Wild Hills]] area outside of Daggerford."
