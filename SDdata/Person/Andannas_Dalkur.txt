Dalkur hailed from Secomber, later moved to Tharsult, and finally settled in Candlekeep. Before 1487 DR, someone killed him and used his appearance to infiltrate the monastery.
In 1487 DR, Elminster Aumar found Dalkurs body under Candlekeep. He also decided to use Dalkurs disguise to infiltrate the monastery and find the one who killed Dalkur.
Dalkur was an acquaintance of Elminster, who considered him a good writer.
