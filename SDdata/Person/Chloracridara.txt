ChloracridaraDemihuman Deities, on page 119, instead names the dragon Choloracridara. was an old female green dragon who lived in the partially standing temple to Corellon Larethian in the ruined Eaerlanni settlement of Mhiilamniir. She had lived there for more than six hundred years by 1372 DR.
Rabidly paranoid, Chloracridara claimed the whole city and its environs as her domain, making it too hazardous for elven pilgrims to visit any of the temples.
