        "mainbody": "Myrineyl Baenre was the First Priestess of House Baenre circa 1484 DR.\nMyrineyl had been groomed from infancy to rule. However, she developed a sadistic side. She had a strange fascination with surface elves and had always at her side a slave attendant of this race. These attendants, however, rarely survived long and always needed to be replaced.\nMyrineyl was equally talented in divine and arcane magic.\nMyrineyl was the firstborn of matron mother Quenthel Baenre. In 1480 DR, she was in her last year in Arach-Tinilith.\nIn later years, she and Quenthels sister SosUmptu Baenre competed for the title of First Priestess. The appointment of her aunt as matron mother of the restored House DoUrden probably granted the First Priestess position to Myrineyl."
