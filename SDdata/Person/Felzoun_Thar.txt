Felzoun Thar was a dwarf tavern owner inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the midâ€“14 DR.
His fierce reputation matched his bristling red beard. He appeared to have a limitless amount of energy as he bustled about his tavern.
Felzoun owned a tavern named after himself called Felzouns Folly which was located in Waterdeeps Trades Ward.
He always carried a pair of throwing axes hidden beneath his apron.
