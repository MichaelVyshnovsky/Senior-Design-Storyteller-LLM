'''Hol Halstrom''' was a farmer and an inhabitant of the village [[Hilltop]] in the [[Silver Marches]].

In [[1372 DR]], he called [[Piper]] a fool for his rantings on the "coming death." Piper proclaimed Halstrom would be dead within a week. A few days later, Halstrom's corpse was found at the edge of the village, nearly decapitated.<ref>
