'''Jeggred Baenre''' was a [[draegloth]], the offspring of [[Matron Mother]] [[Triel Baenre]]'s union with the [[demon]] [[Belshazu]]. He followed her every command, and served as her personal bodyguard, assassin, and executioner.

==Description==
Jeggred was {{SI|8'1"|ft-in|long=yes}} He had a beastlike face that looked like a [[drow]], and silver hair covering his chest, shoulders, and loins. He had four arms: The upper arms ended in long, sharp claws; the lower were humanoid hands. He had yellowed fangs, as well as rows of teeth as sharp as needles. He had particularly foul breath.

Jeggred did not perform [[Reverie]]; he slept.

==Personality==
Jeggred was not known for his intelligence, though he was far from stupid as Jeggred delighted in bloodshed and had a coldly murderous mind that found glee in malice.

==Abilities==
Jeggred was able to use his upper clawed hands as a weapon and his lower humanoid hands to manipulate items, such as a [[crossbow]] he wielded. He was immune to fire and resistant to electricity.

==Possessions==
Although Jeggred primarily relied on his prodigious draegloth abilities and strength, Triel ensured that her son was outfitted with items suited to both his stature and talents.

*A protective black [[Piwafwi]].
*Set of [[Bracers of the Blinding Strike]] that greatly enhanced his attacking speed.
*A finely wrought leather [[Belt of power|belt]] which increased his already formidable physical prowess.
*A unique amulet detailed with an visage of a demonic face, twisted in wrath, which toughened Jeggred whilst [[greater magic fang|enchanting his claws]] with magic.

==History==
Born in [[1362 DR]] to [[Triel Baenre]], Jeggred quickly grew to maturity due to his [[Draegloth]] heritage. By [[1366 DR]], Jeggred was fully grown.

During his time in [[Menzoberranzan]], he served many roles for his mother, notably as her bodyguard, an assassin and executioner for many years.

In [[1372 DR]], Jeggred was commanded to accompany [[Quenthel Baenre]] in her journey to investigate the [[Silence of Lolth]].

Once Danifae had secured the loyalty of Jeggred, she utilized him for her own purposes, one of which was ordering him to kill [[Ryld Argith]] in order to hurt [[Halisstra Melarn]], her former mistress. Ryld succeeded in cutting off his small right hand (which was later restored by Quenthel and Danifae), but Jeggred nonetheless killed him and ate his heart, taunting the mage [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] about it afterwards.

His life ended in the [[Demonweb Pits]], shortly after taunting Pharaun as the mage lay paralyzed, watching his doom—a swarm of spiders—approach. Soon afterwards, Quenthel returned from Lolth's city and punished her nephew for his treachery against her, leaving his torn body for the swarming spiders to feast upon.

==Relationships==
Jeggred was the son of [[Triel Baenre]], [[matron mother]] of [[House Baenre]], and the [[glabrezu]] [[Belshazu]], to whom he felt no particular connection.
