==Description==
Peete was a [[human]] with the weathered complexion of an older man. He had a light skin tone and short hair whitened by age.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Peete could be found in the docks of the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate, where commoners could buy fresh [[fish]]. The docks were attacked by a band of [[sahuagin]] when the area was visited by the [[Absolute Adversaries]]. The fish-men jumped from the water all around Peete, terrifying the old man. It was unknown if Peete survived the attack. If he were to survive, he would express his gratitude and voice concern over the sahuagin bodies smelling up the docks.
