        "mainbody": "'''Azrok''' was a [[hobgoblin]] warlord in [[Undermountain]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Usually, Azrok sat on his throne assisted by his wife and lieutenant [[Lurkana]] and six [[goblin]]s, two [[bugbear]]s, and four hobgoblins, plus two [[worg]]s.",
        "History": "Azrok was born blind in a hobgoblin clan in Undermountain. Normally, his disability would doom him but Azrok's mother, a powerful [[sorceress]], crafted for him a ''[[dagger of blindsight]]'' that permitted him to see as a normal hobgoblin. In time, Azrok became the leader of his clan and with great wisdom settled his people inside the [[Sargauth Level]] where they prospered, killing the local [[grimlock]]s and [[troglodyte]]s. Azrok even sired an heir and his people renamed themselves the [[Legion of Azrok]].\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} [[Kessandro Rosznar]] went to met Azrok in order to start a [[slavery|slaving]] business together but instead Azrok killed the young Rosznar for his failing to show the proper respect to the warlord.\n\nSome time after, some [[duergar]] thieves of [[Clan Ironeye]] stole Azrok's magical dagger. Using this advantage, the [[drow]] of [[House Auvryndar]] managed to settle in the level without too many attacks from Azrok's army. His wife and lieutenant Lurkana tried to cover for Azrok's weakness but her efforts were ruined by a [[mind flayer]] ambassador of [[Skullport]] who used some [[intellect devourer]] infiltrators to spread the truth about Azrok's condition. Many of his bugbearÂ and goblin minions abandoned Azrok and went to Skullport to join the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]. Afterward, Azrok feared an invasion from [[Skullport]] into his dominion and a very probable new attack by House Auvryndar.",
        "Relationship": "Azrok's subjects believed him to be blessed by [[Maglubiyet]] and he encouraged this rumor.",
        "Possessions": "Azrok possessed a magical dagger that permitted him a normal vision despite being blind."
