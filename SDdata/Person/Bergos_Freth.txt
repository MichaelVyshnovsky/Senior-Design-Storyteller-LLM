'''Bergos Freth''' was a [[drow]] commander of [[House Freth]]'s assassin forces operating in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1369 DR]].

{{quote|O you trespassers, when the bright [[angel]]s come for you, tell them it was [[Lolth]], Queen of Darkness, who sent your spirits screaming up into the light, and Bergos of the great House Freth, who was her instrument.|Bergos Freth to the [[Veiled Ones]].}}

==Description==
During her mission to Myth Drannor, Bergos wore tight black clothes that hid her true armor underneath. Her face was covered by a black, masked skull-tight hood through which she wore her long white hair in a thick ponytail.

==Possessions==
Bergos Freth was outfitted with a strong and enchanted ''+1'' drow [[chainmail]], a magical ''+1'' drow [[shortsword]] and several [[healing salve]]s. She often started combat using her [[longbow]].

==History==
In 1369 DR, the drow houses Freth and [[House Kilsek|Kilsek]] helmed the expedition into the subterranean parts of the ruined City of Song, Myth Drannor. House Freth was led by [[Dreydre Freth|Dreydre]] and [[Greyanna Freth]], with Bergos Freth commanding the house's elite assassin vanguard squad. The drow established a solid foothold in the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]], creating a well-defended underground stronghold. During that year, another dark force occupied Myth Drannor, the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. Treacherous Freth drow entered into a secret alliance with the cultists, betraying their House Kilsek allies. Freth were allowed to access all the ancient surface elven artifacts they could smuggle out of the Catacombs while Kilsek drow were either murdered and raised as [[undead]] servants of the Cult or stripped of their souls and forced into servitude.

Bergos had a squad of elite commandos under her control that consisted of eight male masters of covert combat, a high priestess of Lolth, and two trained guard [[arraccat]]s. She used her natural drow ability to summon a ''[[darkness]]'' cloud to mask her troops' movements in the Elven Catacombs.

Bergos met her death when her drow came into direct confrontation with the group of adventurers known as the [[Veiled Ones]], a makeshift band assembled by [[Elminster Aumar]] to confront the Cult of the Dragon. Shortly after the adventurers' first arrival in the Elven Catacombs via the previously inactive ''[[gate]]'', the ''Circle of Ualair'', that connected [[Speculum Grounds]] and the catacombs, they were greeted by Bergos proudly standing in front of a cloud of magical ''darkness''. She threatened the trespassers and promised to end their lives in the name of the Queen of Spiders. The Veiled Ones cunningly taunted the drow woman into revealing two of her commandos as a show of strength in the face of cocky adventurers and eventually tricked her into stopping the ''darkness'' revealing her entire squad, giving the adventurers an upper hand. Unfortunately for her, Bergos could not overpower the Veiled Ones and was slain.
