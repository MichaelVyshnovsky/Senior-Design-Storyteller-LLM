Kueh-Ku was an assassin and a member of the Shadow Thieves around 1370 DR.
Kueh-Ku was a vicious and evil person.
During a mission, Kueh-Ku acquired a strange black gem that somehow burrowed its way into her flesh, buried in the center of her left palm. This gem absorbed all magic cast against Kueh-Ku but also made her unable to use magic items. Nobody knew if the gem was a sort of ioun stone and would burn out or if it was a permanent power. Initially, she tried to get it removed but soon found it very useful.
The higher powers of the Shadow Thieves considered Kueh-Ku to be a key agent in their plots against the Lords of Waterdeep.
