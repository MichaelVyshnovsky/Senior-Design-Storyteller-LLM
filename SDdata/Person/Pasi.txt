'''Pasi''' was a [[tiefling]] explorer who made her fortune exploring [[Tier Lathadun]] in the [[Underdark]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The Ruins of Tier Lathadun held many treasures that were discovered by Pasi, who helmed multiple delves into the cavern, armed with her favorite ''[[enchanted]]'' bludgeon â€“ ''[[Doorknocker]]''. Pasi's life ended some years before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, when she slipped off a rocky edge and fell a thousand feet into the dark depths of the Underdark. Her weapon was believed lost along with Pasi's body until it reappeared in 1372 DR.
