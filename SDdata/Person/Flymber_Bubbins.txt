Flymber Bubbins was an aspiring acolyte of the Open Hand Temple of Ilmater located in the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Flymber and Homer Bubbins were born some years before the  in the town of Beregost in West Faer√ªn. At some point, Homer Bubbins set out to pursue a career as a member of the clergy of Ilmater in Baldurs Gate. Despite what he said in his letters, Homer did not become the "right-hand temple manager" under Father Lorgan, but joined the criminal organization known as the Guild. Eventually, in 1492 DR, Flymber Bubbins followed in his twins footsteps and left Beregost to join the Open Hand Temple. Mama Bubbins happily announced that in her birthday letter to Homer.
