'''Flymber Bubbins''' was an aspiring acolyte of the [[Open Hand Temple]] of [[Ilmater]] located in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Flymber and [[Homer Bubbins]] were born some years before the {{YearlinkName|1492}} in the town of [[Beregost]] in [[West Faerûn]]. At some point, Homer Bubbins set out to pursue a career as a member of the clergy of Ilmater in Baldur's Gate. Despite what he said in his letters, Homer did not become the "right-hand temple manager" under Father [[Lorgan]], but joined the criminal organization known as the [[Guild]]. Eventually, in [[1492 DR]], Flymber Bubbins followed in his twin's footsteps and left Beregost to join the Open Hand Temple. [[Mama Bubbins]] happily announced that in her birthday letter to Homer.
