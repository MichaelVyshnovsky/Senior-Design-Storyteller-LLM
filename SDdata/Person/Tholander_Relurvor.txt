'''Tholander Relurvor''', also known as '''Tholander the Mighty''', was the king of the [[realm of the Mount]] in the middle of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Tholander was a large muscular man with great charisma and smooth, pleasing voice.

==Personality==
Not smart enough to actually rule, but smart enough to realize it, Tholander hired and ennobled some of the most vicious [[Ravenaar]]s in exchange for them ruling in the shadows and acting as tutors for one of his own sons to prepare him to rule. He was known to give superfluous titles to such allies, such as ''"Grand Duke Most Awesome Belborst of the Gilded Banners"''.

==History==
Tholander became king of the ''realm'' after his father [[Xavander Relurvor|Xavander]] was killed by a more powerful [[wizard]] he tried to swindle. He had many children, most of which were assassinated by his son [[Helemvo Relurvor|Helemvo]] soon after the king's decease.
