        "mainbody": "'''Densil Wizardfoe''' was an [[adventurer]] in [[Cormyr]] with the [[Magebanes]] company in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Densil had a strong distrust and disdain for [[magic item]]s and [[spell]]s, and refused to use or work alongside them.",
        "Abilities": "Lacking magical enhancement, Densil was a strong and powerful warrior on his own merits.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Densil and [[Floryn Spellshatter]] attended a party at [[Thistleflame Keep]], held by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] for King [[Azoun IV]]'s birthday. They stayed the night in the Keep and were briefly considered suspects after Lord Thistle's apparent murder, but their refusal to use any magic ruled them out."
