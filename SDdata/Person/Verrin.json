        "History": "In [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, the treasonous nobleman Marlin Stormserpent stole the ''[[Wyverntongue Chalice]]'' from [[Castle Obarskyr]] in [[Suzail]]. He used an exit passage leading into the basements beneath [[the Old Dwarf]], a nearby tavern, where the gate was to be unlocked by his accomplice, Verrin. However, he found Verrin was working with [[Marlazander]] and had left the gate locked.\n\nMarlin then unleashed his [[stirge]], [[Thirsty]], which quickly stabbed Verrin in the neck, leaving a mortal wound. Marlazander, in turn, fled, only to be slain by an undead warrior, [[Targrael]]."
