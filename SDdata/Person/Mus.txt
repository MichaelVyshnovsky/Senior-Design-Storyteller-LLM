Mus was an ogre mage living on Jazirat al-Sadaf in the Crowded Sea in 1367 DR. He was the head of a family of ogre mages.
The oni planned to unleash a horde of sartani on the other islanders of Jazayir al-Sartan. He was able to summon the sartani by using special magical shells gifted to him by Karrrga.
Mus had a collection of magical shells that could be used to summon and control sartani once dropped into sea water.
