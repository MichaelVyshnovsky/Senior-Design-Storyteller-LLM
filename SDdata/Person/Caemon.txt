Caemon was a priest of Amaunator in Hillsfar.
During a pilgrimage, he came across the Cult of the Dragons hunting lodge in the Greypeak Mountains and was captured by Talis Kasterel. However, he received good treatment, not like Craggnor and Miresella. Caemon suspected that this was because she wanted to convert him or to use him as a sacrifice to Tiamat.
