        "A noble does not rule simply by decree or by law, but by the sufferance of those ruled. A noble puts the well-being of the people before her own, or else she is unfit to rule.\n| Her Royal Highness Queen Zaranda, Monarch of Tethyr\n}}": "=Description==",
        "mainbody": "randa was very tall, standing at six feet, one inch, and had an athletic build. and strong, white teeth.

        "Description": "Zaranda was very tall, standing at six feet, one inch, and had an athletic build. and strong, white teeth.

She sometimes bound her hair back in a silver-colored ribbon.",
        "Personality": "Zaranda was the epitome of free-spiritedness; she decided her own destiny. This trait is probably why she gave up her training as a mage at an early age; she preferred the savage excitement of a fighter's life over that of a studious pupil.\n\nShe could be calm, however, when the situation called for it, such as during matters of court or negotiations. Her temper would still flare, though, if injustice or violations of freedom or privacy occurred, and she would never negotiate over hostages.\n\nDespite her free-spirited nature, Zaranda hated being late.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Romantic": "Zaranda's independent personality was clearly seen in her romantic relationships, where she tended to be the one to both initiate and end relationships.",
            "Family": "Queen Zaranda had three children with Haedrak, two girls and a boy&mdash;triplets. Zaranda was the first Tethyrian royal to have triplets in the 500 years since [[Alisande Bormul|Queen Alisande]]. [[Sybille Rhindaun|Princess Sybille]], [[Coram Rhindaun|Prince Coram]], and [[Cyriana Rhindaun|Princess Cyriana]] were born, in that order, in the month of [[Flamerule]] in [[1370 DR]]. (\"Sybille\" and \"Cyriana\" were the names of the daughter and granddaughter of Queen Alisande, respectively.) \n\nZaranda was an orphan, and not much else is known about her early childhood.",
            "Adventuring Companions": "Her companions with whom she adventured were originally known as the \"Company of the Star\", but later became [[Star Protective Services]]. Among them were:\n\n* [[Shield of Innocence]], an [[Orog]] [[paladin]]\n* [[Vander Stillhawk]], a [[human]] [[ranger]]<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note1\">''[[Heroes' Lorebook]]'' lists Vander as a wood elf archer/[[ranger]], while ''[[Champions of Valor]]'' lists him as a human fighter. ''[[Lands of Intrigue (boxed set)|Lands of Intrigue]]'' mentions him several times but is uncharacteristically silent on the matter of his race and class. ''[[War in Tethyr]]'' describes him in detail as a human ranger raised by elves, so that is what is stated here.\n* [[Chenowyn]], Zaranda's \"apprentice\", a [[Dragon aging|young]] [[ruby dragon]] disguised as a human whom Zaranda treated as a daughter\n* [[Golden Dawn]] or \"Goldie\", Zaranda's intelligent, talking horse\n* [[Gisbertus]], a [[bugbear]] and Zaranda's chief steward and chamberlain\n\nAfter her crowning, many of the members of Star Protective Services became the [[Warriors of the Star]], the elite service sworn to protect the king and queen of Tethyr. Vander Stillhawk was their first leader.",
            "Other Close Friends": "During the campaign against the [[Tuigan Horde]], Zaranda met and became friends with [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Onyx the Invincible]], [[Timoth Eyesbright]], Vander Stillhawk (who later joined Star Protective Services), [[Kyrin Hawkwinter]], and [[Zelphar Thann]].\n\nDuring the early stages of the Reclamation Wars, she met the members of the Company of Eight, with whom her ideals were closely matched. These adventurers too became her good friends."
        },
        "Faith": "Zaranda publicly converted to the religion of Siamorphe, which was a sign to her people of her nobility.",
        "Abilities": "Zaranda was especially proficient in the use of the saber, battle axe, dagger, and boar spear. She strongly preferred melee combat, but could shoot a crossbow if necessary. She was skilled at mounted combat, able to strike foes on both sides of her horse with her saber.\n\nShe was skilled in the knowledge of the planets and stars but was opposed to the idea that they could predict anyone's future.\n\nShe routinely used magic in her battles.  Two of her favorites were a fireball and the sleeping spell, the latter being the first spell she taught Chenowyn.",
        "Possessions": {
            "Mundane Items": "Her horse, Golden Dawn, was outfitted in a [[Calishite]] saddle,",
            "Magic Items": "[[Crackletongue]] was Zaranda's magical saber, both from her adventuring days and afterward. It was named such due to its ability to \"crackle\" with blue flame in the presence of evil enemies.\n\nHer most commonly worn crown was the \"Queen's Diadem\". It was a simple weave of silver, gold, and [[mithral]], decorated in a wave pattern with stars and goblets. It protected her from mind-reading spells. The \"Monarch's Crown\" was her state crown. It too protected from mind-reading but also afforded several other magical protections. It was made of gold, silver, and bronze with mithral, rubies, and garnets. It featured a carved image of Siamorphe's goblet. She found it uncomfortable to wear. Both crowns were so enchanted by [[Elminster]] and [[Alustriel]].\n\nZaranda's scepter was a solid silver rod with the head of a lion with diamond eyes. It acted as a rod of absorption. It, too, was created by Elminster. When in court, Zaranda always had the scepter in hand, though Haedrak and Court Vizera [[Perendra Raslemtar]] could also wield it."

        "History": {
            "Early Career": "[[Image:War in Tethyr.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|''Zaranda Star in combat, from the cover of the novel ''[[War in Tethyr]]''.'']]\nZaranda started her adventuring career as a wizard, under the tutelage of [[Alshayn]],<ref group=\"note\" name=\"tutor\">Book 1 of the [[Lands of Intrigue (boxed set)|''Lands of Intrigue'' boxed set]] names the [[dragon]]-in-disguise [[Nyadnar]] as her tutor, but the novel ''[[War in Tethyr]]'' makes it clear that Nyadnar was not her tutor but her employer, the one who hired her to steal the [[brazen head]] from [[Thay]]. but soon bored of the training.\n\nIn 1360 DR, as a young mercenary, Zaranda Star fought against the Tuigan Horde while at [[Aglarond]] She was titled as a Captain during that conflict.\n\nZaranda returned to Tethyr and, in [[1362 DR]], purchased [[County Morninggold]] and its titles from the [[Order of the Silver Chalice]].{{Countess Morninggold dates}} Sometime before the beginning of [[1366 DR]], Zaranda set off on a mercantile voyage that took her to places such as [[Thay]] and [[Unther]], and she returned with a caravan of goods destined for [[Zazesspur]]. She accepted an [[orog]] named [[Shield of Innocence]] into her group, something which would normally be frowned upon. When her group arrived in Zazesspur in [[Mirtul]] of 1366, they were arrested by the Council on the order of Baron [[Faneuil Hardisty]], but they escaped before they could be imprisoned.",
            "The Reclammation Wars": "{{main|Tethyrian Interregnum#Reclamation Wars}}",
            "Coronation & Wedding": "Haedrak and Zaranda were married in three separate ceremonies on [[Kythorn 30]] of 1369 DR at the [[Convent of St. Rhynda]]. During the final ceremony, performed by a priestess of Siamorphe, the couple were bathed in light, a divine sign of their nobility.\n\nTheir coronation occurred in the following month, at Faerntarn. Again, the blessings of Siamorphe were upon them, for the crowns placed themselves magically upon Zaranda and Haedrak's heads.",
            "Conflicts at the Borders": "In [[Ches]] of [[1370 DR]], [[Riatavin]] and [[Trailstone]] defected from Amn and requested to join Tethyr, giving Queen Zaranda her first real diplomatic conundrum.\n\n[[Teldorn Darkhope]] attacked and captured the town of [[Kzelter]] in [[Mirtul]] of the same year, forcing Zaranda to send troops to two fronts at the same time."

        "Activities": "[[Image:Zaranda & Haedrak.png|thumb|right|300px|''King-Consort Haedrak Rhindaun III and Queen-Monarch Zaranda Star in their throne room in Faerntarn circa 1370 DR.'']]\nIn her new role as queen, Zaranda made several changes to the Kingdom of Tethyr in hopes of unifying the people. She removed the noble titles of earl and baron, leaving only counts and dukes. She move the capital city from Zazesspur to Ithmong, which was more central, and renamed it \"Darromar\" in honor of King [[Darrom Ithal]], the first king of Tethyr, and she renamed many other lands and titles as well to what they were during the time of the [[Queens' Dynasty]].\n\nThe queen promised to hold court at least twice per year&mdash;at [[Greengrass]] and [[Highharvestide]]. She was the only one permitted to rule in matters of \"high justice\" over other members of the royalty. She was responsible for maintaining armies for the protection of all Tethyr.\n\nQueen Zaranda was advised by a \"Royal Privy Council\" consisting of the following members:\n* King Haedrak III\n* Duchess Vajra Valmeyjar\n* Duke [[Alaric Hembreon]]\n* Duke [[Tardeth Llanistaph]]\n* Duke [[Llachior Blackthorn]]\n* Duke [[Inselm Hhune]]\n* Duchess [[Marilyn Haresdown]]\n* Duke [[Mirthal Aendryr]]\n* Duke [[Allain Kevanarial]] aka Foxfire\n* Lord-Mayor [[Lyrminor Vineshigh]]\n* Lord [[Rauthomyr]]\n* Lord [[Vorn Ghalmrin]]\n* Lady [[Simonne Whitebrow]]\n* Archdruid [[Arkaneus Silvermane]]\n\nIn her first Highharvestide court, Zaranda established the [[Loyal Order of Innocents]] in honor of her friend Shield of Innocence who sacrificed himself saving Zazesspur."
