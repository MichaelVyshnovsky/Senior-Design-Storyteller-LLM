        "Description": "Lallara was seemingly pale and vital but her age showed in the lines at the corners of her eyes, mouth, and soft flesh beneath her chin. She wore several rings on her fingers.",
        "Personality": "A particularly decadent and extremely chaotic woman, she counted herself among the (albeit unreliable) allies of [[Szass Tam]]. and enjoyed practicing on her slaves. She also collected unusual [[magic item]]s."
