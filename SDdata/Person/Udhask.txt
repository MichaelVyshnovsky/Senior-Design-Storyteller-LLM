'''Udhask''' was a [[deep gnome]] [[ghost]] in [[Blingdenstone]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When the [[drow]] attacked Blingdenstone in [[1371 DR]], he tried to reach for his loot when he died of a heart attack. For unknown reasons, he rose as a ghost. Thereafter, every time someone approached his remains he relived his death in a loop, attacking and scaring people.

If someone recovered his remains and put it in the catacombs, he would find peace.
