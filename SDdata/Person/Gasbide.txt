'''Gasbide''' was a [[myconid]] [[architect]] and leader of the [[Circle of Builders]] in [[Neverlight Grove]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
A loyal follower of [[Phylo]], Gasbide was corrupted by [[Zuggtmoy]] and began dreaming of bizarre, elaborate structures no myconids would ever need, which were inspired by visions of [[Abyss|Abyssal]] palaces.

==History==
When, ''circa'' [[1486 DR]], Zuggtmoy's will twisted most of the Circle, Gasbide fell to madness and began to become curious about buildings on the surface. He had the aim of constructing, maybe with the help of [[Araumycos]], a tower taller than [[Yggmorgus]] that could possibly connect the [[Underdark]] to the surface.
