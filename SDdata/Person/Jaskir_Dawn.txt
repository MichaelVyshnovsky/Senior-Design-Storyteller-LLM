'''Jaskir Dawn''' was a captain of the [[Hellriders]] of [[Elturel]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 2|8-10}}
{{Quote|You can put your faith in [[Zariel|fallen angels]]. I'll put mine in [[the Companion]].|Jaskir Dawn to [[Helene]]}}

==Personality==
Jaskir was dedicated to [[Thavius Kreeg]], the High Overseer of Elturel, whom he attributed with summoning the Companion to free Elturel from its [[vampire]] rulers. His aspirations were to serve loyally and to raise his children in peace.

}}
At some point prior to the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Jaskir was tasked with safely delivering the sage [[Shandeir]] to Elturel. They were accompanied on this journey by [[Falaster Fisk]] and [[Sylvira Savikas]]. They chartered passage with the [[White Sails Company]] aboard the ''[[Hesperornis]]''. When the ship detoured to [[Mintarn]], Jaskir protested but was overruled by Shandeir.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 2|12-14}}{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|6-7}}
