        "mainbody": "Gevandra Mallowthar, lovingly nicknamed the Evening Rose, was the first Lady of Graces in service of the Court of King Foril Obarskyr I of Cormyr in the early-to-mid–15 century DR.\nGevandra was a stunningly beautiful woman with dark blue eyes and hair. Her uncanny hair color was natural and by many accords, was the result of her half-elven bloodline. These features earned her the Evening Rose moniker.\nAs a lady of the Court, Gevandra resided within a suite in the Court of Cormyr. Her quarters were in the western end of the Royal Court, along with the receiving room, connected to the suites via a circular staircase. The receiving room was named Font of Grace, while the chambers were later named after Gevandra Mallowthar—the Rose Rooms.\nGevandra Mallowthar left her office in the , and was succeeded by Brunzarra Hethcanter, the second Lady of Graces of Cormyr."
