        "mainbody": "Argens Bruil was the heir of House Bruil in Melvaunt in 1374 DR.\nAs a paladin-in-training, Argens had developed the abilities to detect and smite evil-doers, heal wounds, and embolden allies. In addition, Argens was adept in the use of the longsword and a fine horseman.\nArgens was also skilled carpenter.\nAs the heir of house Bruil, Argens had access to a great deal of items and wealth. However when adventuring he was noted to don a suit of finely-crafted half-plate and shield. He wielded a magical longsword and a shortbow in combat.\nArgens was undergoing paladin training at the Temple to Tyr in Melvaunt, studying under the cleric Jens Galt, who often told about his adventures in Thar.\nArgens was chosen as the heir of his House despite being a bastard, owing to the bad relationship between Lord Vanth Bruil and his older son Halmuth Bruil.\nIn 1374 DR, he helped to rebuild a local hostelry that had been destroyed by fire. However, secretly he met with his friends Elaint Marsk, Kalman Leiyraghon, Kara Calaudra, and Oreal Nanther, planning to go on adventure, with the support of the dwarf mercenary Dorn Crownshield.\nThey found a \"treasure map\" (in truth, a trap devised by Bremen Leiyraghon) and went on adventure in Thar, only to be captured by the orog Daazlag and his orc minions.\nArgens was imprisoned in a cave in XÃ»l-Jarak with all his friends."
