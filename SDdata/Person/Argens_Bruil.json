        "Abilities": "As a [[paladin]]-in-training, Argens had developed the abilities to detect and smite evil-doers, heal wounds, and embolden allies. In addition, Argens was adept in the use of the [[longsword]] and a fine horseman.\n\nArgens was also skilled carpenter.",
        "Possessions": "As the heir of house [[Bruil]], Argens had access to a great deal of items and wealth. However when adventuring he was noted to don a suit of finely-crafted [[plate mail|half-plate]] and [[shield]]. He wielded a [[magic]]al longsword and a [[shortbow]] in combat.",
        "Activities": "Argens was undergoing [[paladin]] training at the Temple to [[Tyr]] in Melvaunt, studying under the [[cleric]] [[Jens Galt]], who often told about his adventures in [[Thar]].",
        "History": "Argens was chosen as the heir of his House despite being a bastard, owing to the bad relationship between Lord [[Vanth Bruil]] and his older son [[Halmuth Bruil]].\n\nIn 1374 DR, he helped to rebuild a local hostelry that had been destroyed by fire. However, secretly he met with his friends [[Elaint Marsk]], [[Kalman Leiyraghon]], [[Kara Calaudra]], and [[Oreal Nanther]], planning to go on adventure, with the support of the [[dwarf]] mercenary [[Dorn Crownshield]].\n\nThey found a \"treasure map\" (in truth, a trap devised by [[Bremen Leiyraghon]]) and went on adventure in Thar, only to be captured by the [[orog]] [[Daazlag]] and his [[orc]] minions.\n\nArgens was imprisoned in a cave in [[XÃ»l-Jarak]] with all his friends."
