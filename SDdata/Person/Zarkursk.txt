Zarkursk was the evil old black dragon who was an enemy of the dwarves of Clan Stonehand sometime before 1372 DR.
Zarkursk laired within a swamp in close vicinity to Clan Stonehands mine. Given their close proximity, the dragon and the dwarves developed a bitter rivalry that culminated in Clan Stonehands young warriors planning and executing a fateful attack on Zarkursk. They successfully slew the beast and inherited the sizable hoard that consisted mostly out of precious gems.
