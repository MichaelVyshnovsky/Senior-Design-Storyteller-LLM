        "mainbody": "ukhosh was an illithid advisor or Matron Mother Azurna during her holy quest to recover the Flame Sword of Lolth in 1370 DR.\nRukhosh was the name that was given the illithid by his drow allies. He valued his self-preservation and well-being of his hive over the loyalty to Azurnas drow.\nLike other mind flayers who knew of Sangalor, the minds flayer who chose individualism and worshiped Oghma in Waterdeep, Rukhosh considered even speaking his name to be disgusting and offensive.\nAzurna and her drow arrived to Undermountain shortly after Halaster Blackcloaks disappearance during Halasters Higharvestide in 1369 DR. There she started the hill quest for the long-lost artifact of the Spider Queen. She managed to strike an alliance with a mind flayer hive and received a trusted advisor - Rukhosh, who loyally guided her efforts against Waterdeep and assembling allies and troops.\nIn 1370 DR, a capable adventurer and an agent of Khelben Arunsun set out to investigate and stop the dire threat to the City of Splendors. Subsequently, the Khelbenite reached the main stronghold of the drow in Undermountain. There he came face to face with Rukhosh in the barracks of the dark elf lair. Rukhosh saw the inevitable defeat of Azurnas alliance and offered the adventurer aid in exchange for the mind flayers life and safety of the hive. This encounter helped the Khelbenite in snatching one of the spider pieces needed to find the Flame Sword of Lolth."
