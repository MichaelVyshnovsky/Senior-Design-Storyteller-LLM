        "mainbody": "'''Rukhosh''' was an [[illithid]] advisor or Matron Mother [[Azurna]] during her holy quest to recover the ''[[Flame Sword of Lolth]]'' in [[1370 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Rukhosh was the name that was given the illithid by his [[drow]] allies. He valued his self-preservation and well-being of his hive over the loyalty to [[Azurna]]'s drow.\n\nLike other mind flayers who knew of [[Sangalor]], the minds flayer who chose individualism and worshiped [[Oghma]] in [[Waterdeep]], Rukhosh considered even speaking his name to be disgusting and offensive.",
        "History": "[[Azurna]] and her drow arrived to [[Undermountain]] shortly after [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s disappearance during [[Halaster's Higharvestide]] in [[1369 DR]]. There she started the hill quest for the long-lost artifact of the Spider Queen. She managed to strike an alliance with a mind flayer hive and received a trusted advisor - Rukhosh, who loyally guided her efforts against Waterdeep and assembling allies and troops.\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], a capable adventurer and an agent of [[Khelben Arunsun]] set out to investigate and stop the dire threat to the City of Splendors. Subsequently, the [[Khelbenite]] reached the main stronghold of the drow in Undermountain. There he came face to face with Rukhosh in the barracks of the dark elf lair. Rukhosh saw the inevitable defeat of Azurna's alliance and offered the adventurer aid in exchange for the mind flayer's life and safety of the hive. This encounter helped the Khelbenite in snatching one of the ''spider pieces'' needed to find the ''Flame Sword of Lolth''."
