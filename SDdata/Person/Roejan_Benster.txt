'''Roejan Benster''' was a Veteran Thief of the [[Shadowmasters of Telflamm|Shadowmasters]] of [[Telflamm]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
Roejan was a scheming man with an ugly appearance but an agreeable personality. By 1370 DR, his devotion to [[Mask]] began to wane. His supreme goal was the position of Guildmaster, but Roejan had too few cronies under him. He wanted to expand the ranks of those loyal to him, hoping to challenge [[Keshna Finlothleer]] one day or to be in the right place in case she encountered an "accident".

==History==
In 1370, Roejan was a powerful member of the Shadowmasters, with a retinue of a dozen followers.
