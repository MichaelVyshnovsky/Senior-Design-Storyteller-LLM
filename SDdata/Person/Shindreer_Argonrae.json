However, in [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} [[Vlonwelv Auvryndar]] feared Shindreer's ambition and sent her to battle [[House Freth]]'s army in the Troglodyte Warrens, hoping for her death but Shindreer proved harder to kill. She was supported by a summoned [[hezrou]] in the middle of the ferocious battle with Freth troops. If nobody intervened, Shindreer won the day.",
