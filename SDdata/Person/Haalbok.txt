'''Haalbok''' was a leading citizen of [[Farr Windward]]. He developed an intricate plan to free the colony.

==Description==
The intelligent old man dressed in a leather shirt and wore a [[coif (clothing)|coif]]. He had dark eyes and black facial hair.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], Haalbok and [[Ougo]] devised a scheme to free the colony, who were being held against their will. Haalbok feigned his death, and the inhabitants erupted in a huge celebration, stretching the spy network of their enemies. During this time, Ougo met with the [[Heroes of Ascore]] and acquired a branding iron, which marked people as citizens of the colony. Haalbok used white greasepaint and his artisan skills to disguise Ougo as a statue, who was then successfully smuggled out of Farr Windward. Ougo then branded the leader of [[Orlumbor]], [[Tulgar Wrighttson]], and he was forced to let the colony go free.
