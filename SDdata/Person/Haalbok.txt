Haalbok was a leading citizen of Farr Windward. He developed an intricate plan to free the colony.
The intelligent old man dressed in a leather shirt and wore a coif. He had dark eyes and black facial hair.
In 1358 DR, Haalbok and Ougo devised a scheme to free the colony, who were being held against their will. Haalbok feigned his death, and the inhabitants erupted in a huge celebration, stretching the spy network of their enemies. During this time, Ougo met with the Heroes of Ascore and acquired a branding iron, which marked people as citizens of the colony. Haalbok used white greasepaint and his artisan skills to disguise Ougo as a statue, who was then successfully smuggled out of Farr Windward. Ougo then branded the leader of Orlumbor, Tulgar Wrighttson, and he was forced to let the colony go free.
