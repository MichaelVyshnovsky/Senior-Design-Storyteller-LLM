Uhndek was the lizardfolk leader of the Khoroshen tribe, based in the marshland of the Evermoors in the 1370s DR. 
Uhndek had a crocodile companion named Dross.
Uhndek was short and stocky.
Uhndek owned a suit of well-made crocodile-hide armor and carried a spear, Semuanyas Fang, which had been adorned with human finger bones and carved runes. He also owned a crocodile-tooth necklace.
In 1374 DR, Uhndek and the tribe were hired by First Speaker Tessarin Alaurun in defense of Nesmé, but Uhndek betrayed the city and made an agreement with the trolls to work together in attacking Nesmé the lizardfolk would gain the city and the trolls the surrounding moors. The meeting to agree to this plan was interrupted by Alauruns aide, Chaver Tegarech, who was captured and taken to mines below Baeniff Tor.
