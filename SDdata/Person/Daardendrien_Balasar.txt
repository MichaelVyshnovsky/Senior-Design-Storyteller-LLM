'''Daardendrien Balasar''' was a [[dragonborn]] warrior member of [[Clan Daardendrien]] and a high-ranking member of the [[Lance Defenders]] in [[1479 DR]]. 

==Description==
Balasar was considered a runt, for a dragonborn and ocher colored scales.

==Abilities==
He was capable of breathing frost.

==Relationships==
He was a close friend of his clanmate [[Daardendrien Medrash]] and the husband of [[Kanjentellequor Biri]]. 

==Personality==
Balasar was described as frivolous, immature and irresponsible. Like most dragonborn, Balasar didn't followed the teachings of any deity.

==History==
In 1479 DR, Balasar was sent to [[Luthcheq]] as member of a diplomatic party sent to assist ambassador [[Ophinshtalajiir Perra]]. This became a problem when, soon after, the [[Thymari]] diplomatic delegation was kicked out of [[Chessenta]] as the dragonborn had no evidence to prove their innocence, and Balasar was forced to return to Tymanther.

During the travel back home, a [[Topaz dragon|topaz]] ''taaldarax'' (one of the players of [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]'s ''[[xorvintaal]]'') attacked Perra and her delegation, but with the help of Medrash, Khouryn, and his [[Brotherhood of the Griffon|men]], the dragonborn were able to drive away the dragon.

Upon arriving in Tymanther he found his native land [[Invasion of Tymanther|under attack]] by [[Stone giant|ash giants]] from the [[Black Ash Plain]]. Medrash, Balasar and Khouryn led a small unit of Daardendrien warriors in an expedition to investigate the giants motives, but they were overwhelmed. As they fled, they encountered members of the [[Platinum Cadre]] in an operation to exterminate ash giants, and seeing what the followers of [[Bahamut]] were capable of, they joined them until they returned to [[Djerad Thymar]].

Balasar became suspicious of [[Nala]], the Platinum Cadre's [[cleric]], and decided to infiltrate the order. He was initiated into the order's rites although he didn't fully open himself up to [[Bahamut]]'s power (which was actually [[Tiamat]]'s). 

Balasar was part of the Platinum Cadre forces during [[Vanquisher]] [[Tarhun]]'s joint military operation against the giants. Although Nala didn't wanted to attack at the same time the other Thymari military forces did it, Balasar was able to convince his "brothers-in-arms" to join into the fray. Balasar, Medrash, Nala and [[Patrin]] fought toe to toe in order to save Tarhun's life.

After following [[Raiann]], Balasar found Nala's secret apartments in the catacombs beneath Djerad Thymar. Later, he returned to the site with Khouryn and Medrash and discovered an altar to Tiamat, uncovering Nala's true role as a priestess of Tiamat. Balasar's accusations led to a duel between Medrash and Patrin, the Cadre's leader, that Medrash won.

Balasar also took part in the operation to laid siege to [[Ashhold]] and to kill the [[green dragon]] [[Skuthosiin]]. During the battle, Balasar killed Nala. As a reward for his deed, he was reassigned to the Lance Defenders and promoted to the rank of knight, a high-ranking position within the military.	

When Khouryn Skulldark returned to Tymanther and warned them about [[Tchazzar]] plan's to invade the dragonborn nation, Balasar was assigned to a mission to destroy [[Gestaniius]] and liberate [[High Imaskar]] from her forces, so the Imaskari would lend their aid to the Thymari. Balasar and his friends were sent to Luthcheq to escort ambassador Perra, who wanted to reinstate the diplomatic relations between Tymanther and Chessenta. However, when they reached the city, the [[Battle of Luthcheq]] had already begun. Balasar took part in the battle, helping the helping the Chessentan forces to destroy the [[dracolich]] [[Alasklerbanbastos]].

He later went to [[Dracowyr]] alongside Medrash, Biri, the Brotherhood of the Griffon and the surviving dragons of the Battle of Luthcheq. Together, they put an end to Brimstone's ''xorvintaal''. After that, he returned to Tymanther, were he intended to marry Biri, although reluctantly.
