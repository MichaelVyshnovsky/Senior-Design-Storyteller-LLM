        "mainbody": "'''Jolthur Jathlet''' was the patriarch of the [[Jathlet]] merchant family in [[Delzimmer]] until his demise ''circa'' the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]]. He had a long reign as head of the family and was still in his prime when a suspicious riding accident took his life. He was succeeded by his widow, [[Elsraea Jathlet|Elsraea]], but she did not have much influence over Jolthur's many brother and uncles, some of whom were powerful mages, and she became mainly a figurehead in a male-dominated clan. Jolthur was the father of [[Dolrur Jathlet|Dolrur]], one of many sons and nephews that were also trying to make a name for themselves in Delzimmer and elsewhere."
