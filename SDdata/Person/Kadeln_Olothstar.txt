'''Kadeln Olothstar''' was a male [[wizard]] who was one of the most powerful [[magelord]]s of [[Athalantar]] and was killed by [[Elminster Aumar]].

==History==
Kadeln was a powerful member of the magelords from the start of their power, second only to [[Neldryn Hawklyn]], together with [[Seldinor Stormcloak]]. His demise came when Elminster returned to Athalantar and fought the magelord [[Taraj Hurlymm]]. Taraj was a close ally of Kadeln and summoned him, but Elminster and his allies killed the two mages.
