Kadeln Olothstar was a male wizard who was one of the most powerful magelords of Athalantar and was killed by Elminster Aumar.
Kadeln was a powerful member of the magelords from the start of their power, second only to Neldryn Hawklyn, together with Seldinor Stormcloak. His demise came when Elminster returned to Athalantar and fought the magelord Taraj Hurlymm. Taraj was a close ally of Kadeln and summoned him, but Elminster and his allies killed the two mages.
