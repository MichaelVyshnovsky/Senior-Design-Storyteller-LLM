        "mainbody": "Maelstrom, Trackless Sea\nHekaton (), also known as the Storm King, was the ruler of the storm giants―and in fact all of giantkind―until sometime after the War of the Silver Marches in the late 15 century DR. As his glorious reign came to an end, Hekaton suffered great indignities in his final years. The Storm King was slain, transformed into an undead monstrosity, and tortured in the Nine Hells, before finally finding peace in the afterlife of Stormhold.\nthumb|left|300px|The fury of Hekaton, the Storm King.\nKing Hekaton wielded respect and fear as his primary means to uphold the ordning―the social structure of all giantkind―and keep the lesser giant races in line. His command over them were bolstered by the numerous powerful artifacts he wielded.\nHe was not without doubt or introspection however. In his final years, Hekaton lost his connection with the members of the giant pantheon and most importantly their patriarch, Annam All-Father. Hekaton came to the belief that the era of the giants were at an end, and the small folk (as giants called them) were set to inherit the Realms of Faerûn. While his outlook was shaken to its core in life, the soul of the beleaguered king suffered even worse fate in undeath.\nWhile Hekaton the king of storm giants was a commanding figure, Hekaton became highly resistant to magic, could not be turned by normal means, and could not be transported to any other plane of existence without his masters approval. Hekaton could still teleport himself in with a crack of thunder and conjure great storms to bring crashing down upon his foes.\nAs the king of the storm giants, Hekatons symbol of office was the Korolnor Scepter.\nHekaton was for a time the proud owner of the Wyrmskull Throne, a dwarven artifact from the long-lost kingdom of Shanatar. He also boasted one of the dwarves Ruling Scepters, which along with the throne, were gifted to him by his wife Neri.\nHekaton did not much like the small folk of the Realms, though Queen Neri was quite fond of them. and collaborated with them in time of need.\nThe king did not fully trust his elder daughters Mirran and Nym, believing them unfit to lead the storm giants. Beyond Niri, he only trusted his youngest daughter, Princess Serissa, and his younger brother, Imperator Uthor.\nAlong with his daughters, King Hekaton raised the young storm giant Thellan as his own ward.\nOn Tarsakh 17 the , King Hekaton and his brother Uthor sailed back to their home of Maelstrom from a diplomatic meeting, when their ship was attacked by three leviathans. During the battle, Hekaton channeled the power of the Wyrmskull Throne within his vessel and summoned a spectral blue dragon to turn the gargantuan elementals away.\nHekaton ruled over the storm giants directly, but asserted his authority over all races of giants. At some point during the late 15 century DR, the gods of the giants no longer answered Hekatons prayers and the king came to believe that storm giants no longere deserved their position at the top of the ordning. Hekaton was shaken by this stark and dramatic change, but his wife Neri reassured him that the future was then in the hands of the small folk.\nThank to Neris belief and several omens that had arose, Hekaton decided to appoint Serissa as ruler of the storm giants. Serissa agreed with her mothers belief that the time of the giants was over. This appointment however angered Hekaton and Neris older daughters, Mirran and Nym.\nSome time circa the late 1480s DR, Neris dead body was found on a small isle on the western coast of Faerûn. Hekaton exploded in rage and was only barely calmed by his daughter Serissa. He nearly launched a war against all the small folk of the Sword Coast, but settled on vowing to find Neris killer. The storm giant court suffered a second disaster when the ordning was finally shattered by Annam All-Father.\nUnfortunately the distraught king was deceived by his elder daughters, Mirran and Nym, along with their new ally the blue dragon Iymrith, who masqueraded as a fellow storm giant.\nthumb|right|350px|King Hekaton left in bondage, stuck aboard the Morkoth in the Trackless Sea.\nKing Hekaton was lured into a trap devised by members of the Kraken Society. Posing as agents of the Lords Alliance, they captured the storm giant ruler and bound him with enchanted chains that kept him in a state of stasis. They set him adrift in the Trackless Sea aboard a shielded squid ship called the Morkoth.\nEventually, King Hekaton was set free from his captors by a band of adventurers and returned to assume the Wyrmskull Throne in Maelstrom. He thanked his liberators for their intervention and directed his forces to take revenge upon Iymrith at her lair in the Anauroch desert.\nSome time later, Hekaton invited the mercenary Zehira Deryan to Maelstrom, to discuss how the recently-acquired Iltkazar Scepter could be used to awaken powers of the Wyrmskull Throne. By the time Zehira and her allies arrived the king had once again been captured, and both he and the throne were taken from Maelstrom. as directed by an figure from the Hells.\nKing Hekaton was killed outright some time during his abduction. Hekaton was raised as an enormous death knight at the Citadel in Thaymount, in service to the lich-king Szass Tam.\nIn Hekatons absence, Princess Serissa emerged as the new leader of the storm giants. She devoted herself to uncovering the truth of her fathers disappearance and recover the Wyrmskull Throne. Meanwhile the undead Hekaton employed a group known as the Ebon Wings\nHekaton then traveled to a hidden fortress in the Thunder Peaks, where the Red Wizards were attempting to bring back the first dracolich Shargrailar. A group of intrepid adventurers defeated the Red Wizards, destroyed the undead Shargrailar once again, and put an end to the death knight Hekaton. Unfortunately, the Storm Kings soul languished within an infernal prison in Kostchtchies Maw on Avernus, the 1 plane of the Nine Hells. During his imprisonment, Hekaton routinely tortured by the pit fiend called Duracles. His soul was left a mere shadow of its form during the kings life.\nAfter being employed by Princess Serissa to uncover the whereabouts of Hekatons soul, the adventurers that stopped the undead king then ventured into his mindscape and learned much about his life. When they finally encountered Hekatons consciousness, the group saw him enveloped in a black whirlpool of self-loathing and overwhelming fear. Serissas heroes spoke to the Storm King and reminded him of his glorious past. Just as they convinced him of his worthiness of an afterlife in Stormhold, the entire group were pulled out of Hekatons mindscape to the citadel of Malsheem in Nessus the 9 layer of the Nine Hells.\nHekaton appeared again in Avernus, held in bondage by Asmodeus the Lord of the Nine. The mortal adventurers that had come so far to liberate the Storm King signed an infernal contract with Asmodeus, guaranteeing the release of his soul from the Hells. Hekaton then ascended upwards from the Lower Planes to Stormhold, with both his existence on the Prime Material plane and his suffering finally at an end."
