'''Hathfell''' was an [[ettin]] inhabiting [[Oman's Isle]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|11}}

==Activities==
Hathfell was granted rulership over the ruins of the [[Iron Keep]] after other [[giant]]s on the isle slew the [[northlander]]s who previously lived there. Hathfell, along with his [[orc]] and [[ogre]] followers, were tasked with preventing the Iron Keep from falling into enemy hands. They trapped [[Iron Bay]] to prevent vessels from sailing toward the keep for an attack by sea.
