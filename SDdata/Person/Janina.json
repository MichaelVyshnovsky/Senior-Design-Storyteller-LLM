        "mainbody": "'''Janina''' was an inhabitant of [[Baldur's Gate]] who died some years before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Janina was a [[human]] woman with fair skin tone and blonde hair.",
        "History": "Janina was a mother who loved his son but she was deeply unhappy in life. She felt remorse over her feelings and self-destructive behavior. Janina planned to run away from her family and found a handsome man who offered her a trip away from the city. The woman collected coin to pay for the passage into the life she thought to be worth living. However, that was not to be. Janina died sometime in or shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1492}} as was evident by her body's lack of decay. She was buried in the [[Lower City Graveyard]], not far from its mortuary. Janina grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and her body risen as a [[zombie]] by [[Nina Dortmell]], a talented child with a [[gift]], who was trying to [[resurrect]] her recently deceased brother."
