Shadowmoon Crystalembers, also known as Cindermoon, was a druid and leader of the Elder Circle of the Emerald Enclave during the 14 and 15 centuries DR.
In her early life, she was a human druid living in the Chondalwood, where she fell in love with the elf Freiwin Crystalembers. They decided to travel to Evermeet in order to marry but in the Winterwood Shadowmoon was killed by goblins. However, she was resurrected in Evermeet as a wild elf by Queen Amlaruil Moonflower using mysterious spells. She went back to the Vilhon Reach to protect the lands where she lived with her lover by 1370 DR.
Shadowmoon represented elves among the three members of the Elder Circle. For a long time, she led the Elder Circle under the name Shadowmoon. However, following the Spellplague of 1385 DR, which altered natures ecosystems, Shadowmoon succumbed to a Shar-induced madness. She changed her name to "Cindermoon" and slowly descended into insanity.
Finally, in 1486 DR, the boy prophet of Lathander, Stedd Whitehorn, arrived and successfully cured Cindermoon. She finally regained her wits, and proclaimed that all should call her Shadowmoon again. She started to reorganize the Emerald Enclave.
