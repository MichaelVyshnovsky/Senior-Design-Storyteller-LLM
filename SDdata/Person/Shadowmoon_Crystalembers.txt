'''Shadowmoon Crystalembers''', also known as '''Cindermoon''', was a [[druid]] and leader of the Elder Circle of the [[Emerald Enclave]] during the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==History==
In her early life, she was a [[human]] druid living in the [[Chondalwood]], where she fell in love with the [[elf]] [[Freiwin Crystalembers]]. They decided to travel to [[Evermeet]] in order to marry but in the [[Winterwood]] Shadowmoon was killed by [[goblin]]s. However, she was resurrected in [[Evermeet]] as a [[wild elf]] by Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] using mysterious [[spell]]s. She went back to the [[Vilhon Reach]] to protect the lands where she lived with her lover by [[1370 DR]].

Shadowmoon represented elves among the three members of the Elder Circle. For a long time, she led the Elder Circle under the name Shadowmoon. However, following the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], which altered nature's ecosystems, Shadowmoon succumbed to a [[Shar]]-induced madness. She changed her name to "Cindermoon" and slowly descended into insanity.

Finally, in [[1486 DR]], the boy prophet of [[Lathander]], [[Stedd Whitehorn]], arrived and successfully cured Cindermoon. She finally regained her wits, and proclaimed that all should call her Shadowmoon again. She started to reorganize the Emerald Enclave.
