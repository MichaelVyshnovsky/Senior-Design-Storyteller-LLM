Aurbangras was a young white dragon.
In 1484 DR, during the Darkening in Luruar, Aurbangras and his father Arauthator were allied with the drow Quenthel Baenre and Gromph Baenre. The two dragons allowed Tiago Baenre to ride one of them into battle. The dragons believed that by doing this they could court the favor of Tiamat and bring "it" back (what "it" refers to is unclear).
In the closing stages of the War of the Silver Marches Aurbangras was killed.
Aurbangras was the son of Arauthator, better known as "Old White Death," and presumably of his mate Arveiaturace.
