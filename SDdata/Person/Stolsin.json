        "mainbody": "tolsin, the Grinder of Tribes, was a Rashemi barbarian working for Sathra in Laothkund until . He was slain by Gage, raised, and then slain again.\nStolsin was a towering man with thickly muscled arms, and many tattoos that marked him as a member of the tribes of Rashemen. His beard was festooned with stone trinkets.\nIn death, his tattoos writhed and squirmed as if with life of their own, and tendrils of shadow appeared to animate him. His maul and mouth also dripped with an inky miasma, and his tongue was swollen and dry.\nWhile alive, Stolsin was dangerously boisterous, continuing to extol his deeds even during combat. In death, not so much.\nIn life, Stolsin handled an immense, gray stone maul without trouble. He still did so in death, also feeling no pain.\nStolsin carried around an immense maul as his weapon.\nStolsin became a thug for Sathra of the Shadow Tongue in Laothkund until . He continued to serve under her for a little time after dying.\nBy , Stolsin had destroyed walking dead in the outskirts of Thay, and dared the cold drakes icy lair somewhere. While working as one of Sathras Shadow Tongue thugs in Laothkund, however, he was slain by Gage, wielding Angul, or perhaps by Angul wielding Gage.\nSathra raised him as undead so as to track Gage down into the Yuirwood, using a link that Stolsin had with his killer once he tracked down Gage, Stolsin attacked again. Neither Gage nor Kiril claim to have struck down Stolsin. Kiril claims to have struck down Sathra it is possible that Sathras necromancy petered out with her."
