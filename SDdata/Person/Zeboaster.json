        "mainbody": "'''Zeboaster the Blunt''' was a [[sage]] who hailed from [[Ordulin]] in [[Sembia]] in the 1350s [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Zeboaster had a distinguished and effete nature, notorious for his sarcasm, wit, and overly honest comments.",
        "Skills": "His particular specialty was [[human]] history and theology around the [[Dragonreach]].",
        "Description": "He perfumed his beard.",
        "History": "Zeboaster argued that stiff-necked chivalry was an anachronistic relic of a simpler and more primitive time and the traditional [[knight]] or [[cavalier]] was obsolete. He did so in the royal court of King [[Azoun IV]] of [[Cormyr]], noted cavalier. Zeboaster soon went back on the road.\n\nZeboaster once named the god of suffering [[Ilmater]] \"the Stupid God\"\n\nHe called the [[zulkir]]s of [[Thay]] the \"Dumb Wizards of Thay\" after they failed to conquer [[Rashemen]].\n\nZeboaster once attempted a prank in the presence of [[Vangerdahast]] of [[Cormyr]] by falsifying a mage's sigil, and brought upon himself the ''[[Trifold Curse of Mystra]]''. A glowing apparition followed him about for some time, pointing and accusing \"Falsely done!\" which rather spoiled dinner parties he attended.<ref>\n\nZeboaster nicknamed the [[Council of Seven Burghers]] of [[Harrowdale]] the \"Council of Seven Stones\" after its members paid no attention to his suggestions to put a little life in the town.<ref>\n\nAfter the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], Zeboaster described the transition of the followers of the god of the dead [[Myrkul]] to the new [[Cyric]] as \"merely changing the name on the letterhead and putting a purple sunburst around the skull outside the temples.\" The Myrkulytes called him \"Zeboaster the Still Aliveâ€”For Now\".<ref>\n\nZeboaster, perhaps predictably, went missing in late 1358 DR. He had actually gone into hiding."
