'''Kepeshkmolik Tarhun''' was a [[dragonborn]] [[warlord]]<ref group="note">[http://slushlush.com/2015/05/on-playing-a-dragonborn-in-the-forgotten-realms-part-1/ In her blog], [[Erin M. Evans]] originally said Tarhun's clan was most likely Linxakasendalor. However, this was said at least 7 months before Ashes of the Tyrant was published, and Erin herself said that this information wasn't technically canonical. and the [[Vanquisher]] of [[Tymanther]] in [[1479 DR]], who maintained the dragonborn's hardline agenda of [[dragon]] hatred. 

==Description==
Tarhun was a hulking dragonborn, bulkier than any common dragonborn.

==Abilities==
He was capable of breathing lightning.

==History==
Tarhun and [[Mehen]] served at the same time on the [[Lance Defenders]] when they were young. They even patrolled together, but never became friends.

In 1479 DR, although Tarhun was frustrated about potentially losing [[Chessenta]] as an ally after ambassador [[Ophinshtalajiir Perra|Perra]] was banished from that nation, and even more because he couldn't help them in the war against [[Threskel]] and his ruler, [[Alasklerbanbastos]], he did not have a choice but to focus all of his efforts on protecting Tymanther, which was being besieged by [[Stone giant|ash giants]]. In order to improve their odds in the conflict, Tarhun hired [[Khouryn Skulldark]] of the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] to train his troops in dwarven battle techniques.

After the Lance Defenders had obtained a few victories, Tarhun personally led all the dragonborn military forces—Lance Defenders, [[Platinum Cadre]], and [[Thymari#Clans|clans]]' private warbands—in a final, desperate battle against the giants. However, he was gravely wounded while fighting a red [[dragonspawn]]. His life was saved thanks to the efforts of [[Daardendrien Balasar|Balasar]], [[Daardendrien Medrash|Medrash]], [[Nala]], and [[Patrin]]. The gamble paid off, and the [[thymari]] were able to defeat the giant invading forces.

After he recovered from his wounds, Tarhun asked the dragonborn [[wizard]] [[Kriv]] to devise a [[counterspell]] to disrupt the dragonspawn-controlling [[orb]]s Nala had created, so the thymari military forces could have a chance in the battle against the giants. After [[Kanjentellequor Biri|Biri]] uncovered the [[green dragon]] [[Skuthosiin]] as the true mastermind of the giants, Tarhun led another joint military operation, this time to lay siege to [[Ashhold]] and to kill Skuthosiin.

After killing the green dragon, Tarhun sent Medrash, Balasar, Biri, Khouryn, and the Platinum Cadre to kill the [[blue dragon]] [[Gestaniius]] and to secure the military aid of [[High Imaskar]] in a potential war against Chessenta.

In [[1486 DR]], asked [[Verthisathurgiesh Anala]] asked Tarhun for permission to recall all the exiled members of [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]] and offer them to reinstate them into the clan. Tarhun conceded the permission. 

On [[Nightal]] of the same year, Mehen sought out Tarhun to ask him for help to stop a [[maurezhi]] servant of the [[god]]-king [[Gilgeam]], who was killing citizens of [[Djerad Thymar]]. Tarhun agreed to help him, and personally led the [[Adjudicators]] to take care of the matter. However, he was ambushed by the demon, who took the appearance of [[Ophinshtalajiir Sepideh|Sepideh]], and when Tarhun lowered his guard, the maurezhi killed him.
