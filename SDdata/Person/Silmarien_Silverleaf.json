        "mainbody": "Silmarien Silverleaf was a moon elf from the realm of Synnoria in the Moonshae Isles.\nSilmarien dressed in a blue shirt, green pants, and tall, brown leather boots. Over her shoulders was draped a purple cloak, as well as her lengthy gray hair.\nAmong Silmariens possessions were an ensorceled suit of chain mail, a magical long sword that made her more effective in combat versus giants, a pair of gauntlets of ogre power, and a girdle of many pouches.\nIn response to Synnorias dwindling population, Silmarien took it upon herself to travel across Faer√ªn in search of male elves, hoping to attract some of them back to Synnoria for breeding."
