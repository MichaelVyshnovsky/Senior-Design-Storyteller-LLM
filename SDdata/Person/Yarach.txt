'''Yarach''' was a white-furred [[gnoll]] belonging to the [[Frosthunger Horde]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Yarach appeared to be extremely confident and well-fed.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, after many [[goblinoid]] members of the Frosthunger Horde fled [[Dragonscar Gorge]] for [[Shimmersky Valley]] in order to escape the hard labor imposed upon them by [[Shattercrown]], Yarach was charged with leading a group of gnolls to guard the entrance from the Valley to the Gorge.

A group of [[adventurer]]s tasked to drive the Horde from the Valley and sever their connection to the Gorge ended up attacking and defeating the overconfident Yarach. However, they were not able to prevent the gnoll from crying out with a series of yelps that echoed into Dragonscar Gorge and alerted the other gnolls of the Horde.
