'''Nyressa Flass''' was a [[vampire]] and the [[Zulkir]] of [[Necromancy]] of the [[Red Wizards]] or [[Thay]] as of the 12{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was famously known as '''the Vampire Zulkir'''.

==History==
Nyressa was a member of the noble [[Flass]] family of Thay and served as the Zulkir of Necromancy prior to the {{YearlinkName|1157}}. That year, [[Szass Tam]] led a group of Red Wizards to slay her. Per Red Wizard custom, a Zulkir could only be removed from office if there remained no possibility for their ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]'' or return as an [[undead]] being, thus Nyressa had to be completely destroyed with an [[oak]]en stake through the heart and a liberal application of ''[[fireball]]s''. Szass Tam then assumed her position as Zulkir of Necromancy.

As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the story of her demise remained one of the best known examples used by the Red Wizards to explain the need to utterly destroy a Zulkir before they could be replaced.
