        "mainbody": "'''Crazyface''' was an adventuring [[cleric]] of foul morals who worked with [[Shagbag]] and, at one time, with the [[dwarf]] [[berserker]] [[Korgan Bloodaxe]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Crazyface was a pale-skinned [[human]] male with a head of blonde hair. He wore no [[armor]] and was armed with a simple [[quarterstaff]].",
        "Abilities": "As a cleric, Crazyface had a variety of [[divine]] magic [[spell]]s at his disposal, including ''[[slay living]]'',''[[righteous magic]]'', ''[[draw upon holy might]]'', ''[[animate dead]]'', and ''[[mental domination]]'', among others.",
        "History": "In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Crazyface was part of an adventuring band that consisted of Shagbag, Korgan Bloodaxe, [[Scrooloose]], [[Stitch (adventurer)|Stitch]], [[Hogbelly]], and [[Cutter (adventurer)|Cutter]]. The band collected valuable tomes for [[Pimlico]] of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]]. One day, the group erupted into violence over an especially prized bounty, ending the lives of Hogbelly, Stitch, and Cutter and leading to Korgan parting ways with the group. In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Crazyface accompanied Shagbag and Scrooloose in confronting the old ally over the ''[[Book of Kaza]]'' the dwarf was searching. The outcome of the confrontation was unknown; however, all three lives were said to had been cut down by the dwarven berserker and his allies atop the [[Copper Coronet]] in Athkatla."
