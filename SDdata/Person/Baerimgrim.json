        "mainbody": "Baerimgrim was a king of Galadorna during the midâ€“8 century DR.\nThe man was rather indifferent to threats of violence, and was strongly tempted to make fun of such even when bedridden. He disliked scheming, too. He still wanted to do right by his land.\nBy the end of his life, he looked like a thin, frail husk.\nHe was childless, and served by five barons Tholone, Belundrar, Hothal, Feldrin, and Maethor. All of them had blood ties to the throne. His court mage was Ilgrist, who was a close friend.\nHe carried an enchanted ring of some sort, which had some unknown protective powers it made it dangerous to try and attack him from close by.\nDuring the last decade of Baerimgrims reign, starting around , Lord Tholone had willfully disregarded the royal decrees of the king. In the , King Baerimgrim rode to Tholones lands with a retinue of armed knights ready to demand his renewed oath of loyalty and back taxes. However, the king was attacked along the way by the green dragon Arlavaunta, leading to the wounds that left him bedridden for the last year of his life.\nDuring the royal moot called by King Baerimgrim in the subsequent , which was held to search for a successor among his barons, the king had to be lashed to his throne. Baerimgrim heard entreaties from Hothal, who discussed a truce with the Lords of Laothkund, and then from the others, who converged on Lord Tholone as the heir, with Belundrar as his seneschal Feldrin agreed to support the arrangement, on the condition that Hothal be eliminated right away and Maethor later assassinated. The King agreed to all those conditions, and agreed to make Tholone the successor.\nA spell  cast by Ilgrist then killed Tholone and the king.\nIt was said that Arlavaunta attacked King Baerimgrim on Tholones orders."
