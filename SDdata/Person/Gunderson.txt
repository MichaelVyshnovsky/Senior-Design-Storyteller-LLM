Mayor Gunderson was the leader of Rothé Valley Village, the biggest settlement in the valley after which was named, during the late 15 century DR. He lived a previous life as an adventurer, claiming to have traveled from Luskan to the far off Moonshae Isles.
Having lived a dangerous life on the road, Gunderson was more world weary than many farmers and residents of Rothé Valley. He was truly dedicated to keeping them safe and content in the pastoral valley they called home.
Gunderson loved to tell stories about his adventuring days, such as one involving an ill-advised sea voyage to the isle of Lantan, and another that saw him and his brother tracking a gnoll necromancer all the way to the City of Sails to the north.
He had at least two known siblings, including one sister that claimed some elven blood in her lineage. His niece Cella was considered half-elf by birth, and earned her keep as a grocer in town.
Gunderson began his adventuring life as a young man, when he joined the wizard Rucksam in his travels across the North. While his journeys took him far and wide across the western breadth of Faerûn, according to his stories at last, Gunderson eventually returned to settle down in his home village and was eventually elected as its mayor.
In the , Mayor Gunderson faced a great challenge when drow slavers began abducing farmers and townsfolk in Rothé Valley and overran its village with monstrous spiders. He worked with a local hero from Neverwinter to help keep the villages citizens safe, and even rescue members of his own family that were taken hostage and nearly fed to an enormous arachnid known as a Daughter of Lolth. Under Mayor Gunderons direction, the hero ventured into the Underdark to slay the leader of the drow expedition, and after having rallied their adventuring party, broke into the Temple of the Spider to defeat High Priestess Syndreth once and for all.
