'''Mayor Gunderson''' was the leader of [[Rothé Valley Village]], the biggest settlement in the [[Rothé Valley|valley]] after which was named, during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He lived a previous life as an adventurer, claiming to have traveled from [[Luskan]] to the far off [[Moonshae Isles]].

==Personality==
Having lived a dangerous life on the road, Gunderson was more world weary than many farmers and residents of [[Rothé Valley]]. He was truly dedicated to keeping them safe and content in the pastoral valley they called home.

==Activities==
Gunderson loved to tell stories about his adventuring days, such as one involving an ill-advised sea voyage to the isle of [[Lantan]], and another that saw him and his brother tracking a [[gnoll]] [[necromancer]] all the way to the [[City of Sails]] to the north.

==Relationships==
He had at least two known siblings, including one sister that claimed some [[elven]] blood in her lineage. His niece [[Cella Gunderson|Cella]] was considered [[half-elf]] by birth, and earned her keep as a grocer in town.

==History==
Gunderson began his adventuring life as a young man, when he joined the wizard [[Rucksam]] in his travels across [[the North]]. While his journeys took him far and wide across the western breadth of [[Faerûn]], according to his stories at last, Gunderson eventually returned to settle down in his home village and was eventually elected as its mayor.

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Mayor Gunderson faced a great challenge when [[drow]] slavers began abducing farmers and townsfolk in [[Rothé Valley]] and overran its village with monstrous [[spider]]s. He worked with a [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|local hero]] from [[Neverwinter]] to help keep the village's citizens safe, and even rescue members of his own family that were taken hostage and nearly fed to an enormous arachnid known as a [[Daughter of Lolth]]. Under Mayor Gunderon's direction, the hero ventured into the [[Underdark]] to slay the [[Sarkon'Iss|leader of the drow expedition]], and after having rallied their [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|adventuring party]], broke into the [[Temple of the Spider]] to defeat High Priestess [[Syndreth]] once and for all.
