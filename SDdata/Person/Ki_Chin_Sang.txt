{{quote|I am glad for you. Now go away. You're distracting me.|Ki Chin Sang}}

==Possessions==
Ki Chin Sang guarded the Key of the Master's Crypt that unlocked [[Nan Kung Chi]]'s tomb.

==History==
Ki Chin Sang died many moons before the late 14{{th}} century DR. His undeath was spent guarding the Crypt of Durkon in [[Shou Lung]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the crypt faced an [[illithid]] incursion led by [[Goxxa]] the [[alhoon]]. The mind flayers consumed the ancient preserved minds of the crypt's dead and sought the ''[[Claw of the Black Leopard]]''. At the same time, a [[vampire]] [[thief]] named [[Hexxat]] arrived at the tomb on the behest of her master [[Larloch]], who sought the tomb's magical treasureâ€”the ''Claw of the Black Leopard''. Ki Chin Sang stood guard at Nan Kung Chi's tomb and demanded anyone seeking entrance to defeat six of Nan Kung Chi's trusted undead lieutenants.
