Father Anton Goodchance was seemingly aloof priest of Tymora in 14th century DR. He was known for lazily ambling along in his journey and would whistle a jig. His motto for life was "fortune favors the bold".
In 1369 DR he took a pilgrimage to Shadowdale, taking the route of the Northride.
Father Anton carried with him a pair of maces.
