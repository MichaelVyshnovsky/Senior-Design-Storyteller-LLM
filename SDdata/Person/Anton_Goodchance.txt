Father '''Anton Goodchance''' was seemingly aloof [[priest]] of [[Tymora]] in 14th century [[DR]]. He was known for lazily ambling along in his journey and would whistle a jig. His motto for life was "''fortune favors the bold''".

In [[1369 DR]] he took a pilgrimage to [[Shadowdale]], taking the route of the [[Northride]].

==Equipment==
Father Anton carried with him a pair of [[mace]]s.
