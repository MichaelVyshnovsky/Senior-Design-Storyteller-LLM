        "mainbody": "Harkon Lukas was the wolfwere Darklord of Kartakass in the Demiplane of Dread, who formerly lived in Cormyr.\nAs a shapechanger, Harkon assumed a variety of forms. He could become a dire wolf, take a wolf-like hybrid form, or assume the shape of either a male or female human.\nAs a female human, Harkon was an awesomely beautiful woman with black, waist-length hair, dark brown eyes, and a mesmerizing smile who often wore a gold vest over a white blouse with scarlet pantaloons tucked into her boots.\nAs a male human, he liked to appear as a  tall, well-muscled handsome man with a lions mane of black hair and an expertly trimmed beard with a long, pointed mustache. He tended to wear a gold coat over a white ruffled shirt with blue silk trousers tucked into riding boots. He also favored a blue wide-brimmed hat with a feather stuck in it, a belt with a silver buckle and small pieces of jewelry. All of his costumes were always accompanied by a monocle.\nWhatever clothes he wore, they were always loose-fitting in case he had to turn into his  tall hybrid form.\nthumb|Harkon Lukas as a creature of the night.\nBorn somewhere in Cormyr,\nHarkon Lukas was a particularly large and unusually curious wolfwere. In time his normally solitary kin quickly grew tired of his constant questions, but thought better of fighting him, instead shunning him. Desiring more and more social contact, Harkon made a plan (another action anathema to his kind) to form his own tribe outside of his family, but found no more acceptance than he had with them.\nHarkon grew angry and for a time vented his anger on all of the livestock and innocent humanoids that he came across. When he eventually calmed down he sought solace with those same humanoids and developed a fascination with men. He trained as a bard and became a wandering minstrel, surviving off small farm animals and the homeless in an attempt to hide his true nature. Although he felt superior to others of his race, he felt that he lacked purpose and began to plan again, thinking to claim rulership over Cormyr. At the time Harkon was largely unfamiliar with the kingdom in which he inhabited, not knowing of its War Wizards and having the misconception that Cormyr was a sparsely-settled land that merely a handful of crafters, woodcutters, and traveling merchants called home.\nWhile making his plans one night, he failed to notice the enveloping mist that transported him to Barovia in the Demiplane of Dread. Once he realized that he was no longer in Cormyr, he became angry again, thinking that the fates had robbed him of his destiny to rule Cormyr. He went on another killing spree, this time targeting wolves and werewolves and eventually came across Strahd Von Zarovich, who almost killed him. Harkon fled into the mists of the Plane and emerged in a realm built for him by the Dark Powers known as Kartakass.\nHarkon was known to possess a berserking longsword, a masterwork light crossbow, bracers of armor +3, a cloak of charisma +2, a ring of protection +3, and a wand of sleep.\nHarkon possessed some skill in creating new spells. One such creation was wolfsong â€“ a spell that, unwittingly to the caster, attracted wild wolves from the surrounding areas. He often taught the spell to the bards he found troublesome."
