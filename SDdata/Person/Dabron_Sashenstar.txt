==Personality==
The favored son of the Sashenstars, Dabron was a charming and witty man with a quick and hearty laugh and always ready to shake hands or slap a fellow on the back. He made friends quite quickly and inspired a lot of trust in them and others. He was renowned for his leadership ability, his fairness and generosity, and he wielded a great deal of influence.

==Abilities==
Dabron Sashenstar was a hardy and highly skilled explorer and [[ranger]], as well as a capable and talented [[merchant prince]]. He also also a brilliant [[fighter]], expert in the [[longsword]], in fighting with two weapons, and from [[horse]]back. He was a master of fighting [[human]]s, [[giant]]s, and [[magical beast]]s.

As befitting a seasoned explorer, Dabron knew a number of languages: [[Chondathan]], [[Damaran]], [[Dwarven]], [[Illuskan]], [[Tethyrian]], plus of course [[Common]], in both the [[Calant]] (spoken on the [[Sword Coast]]) and [[Skaevrym]] (spoken in Sossal) dialects.

Due to his experience as a [[ranger]], Dabron could cast a few natural [[Divine magic|divine spells]]. As a merchant prince he picked up a few [[arcane]] spells as well and received minor blessings from the [[deities]] [[Gond]], [[Lliira]], [[Shaundakul]], and [[Waukeen]], granting him luck, resistance to cold, mental resilience against magical compulsion and fear, and greater skills in trade and crafts.

==Equipment==
By 1374 DR, Dabron possessed many magical item along with a large amount of wealth in riches, [[potion]]s, and investments totaling around 17,500 [[gold piece]]s in value. Among his wealth of magical items was the ''[[Icemail of Orloebar]]'', a ''+5 [[greater cold resistance]] [[invulnerability]] [[mithral]] [[chain shirt]]''; the [[longsword]] ''[[Grayflame]]'', a ''+3 [[outsider|evil outsider]] [[Bane (property)|bane]] [[flaming burst]] [[longsword]]''; the ''[[Snowbeard's avalanche axe]]'', which was a ''+2 [[thundering]] [[handaxe]]''; and [[Misthunter]], a ''+1 [[animal]] bane [[distance]] [[composite longbow]]''. He also owned a pair of ''[[boots of the winterlands]]'', a ''[[necklace of fireballs]]'', a ''[[headband of intellect]]'' and a ''[[periapt of wisdom]]'', plus a ''[[Heward's handy haversack]]'' and a ''stone horse [[figurine of wondrous power]]'' that conjured a mechanical destrier.

In [[1368 DR]], Dabron was seen wearing [[plate mail]] armor and wielding a ''+1 [[morningstar]]'' and a ''[[heavy crossbow of accuracy]]''.

==Relationships==
Dabron was married to [[Eishaera Sashenstar]], herself an equally talented merchant princess.

Dabron was the nephew of [[Aldeth Sashenstar]], whom he succeeded as patriarch of House Sashenstar and senior member of the Merchant's League.The ''Baldur's Gate'' game has Dabron appear as the brother of Aldeth, though the sourcebooks ''Forgotten Realms Adventures'' and ''Power of Faerûn'' make it canon that he is his nephew.

As head of both organizations, Dabron commanded the resources of House Sashenstar and the Merchant's League. He employed a number of specialists to assist him in business. He also had over 1600 followers, most of whom were merchants in his employ but some of whom were [[expert]]s, [[fighter]]s and [[rogue]]s. Eight of them were placed in the rival [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]] and thirteen were in the [[Firehands Group]].

His greatest rivals were the members of the [[Iron Throne]] merchant company.

==History==
===Expedition to the Great Glacier===
Dabron Sashenstar was born to House Sashenstar and into the merchant aristocracy of Baldur's Gate. He was a favored scion of the house.

In the 1350s DR, Dabron Sashenstar left Baldur's Gate and made an exploratory journey into [[Faerûn]]'s far [[Northeast Faerûn|northeast]] in an expedition sponsored by the Merchant's League, which was headed by House Sashenstar. and became the first westerner to visit and detail the country of the [[Sossrim]].

At one point, Dabron and his band also discovered the tower of the long-dead [[mage]] [[Caddelyn]] on a mountain north of the Great Glacier. They camped there and explored the tower, and found within the [[spellbook]] known as [[Caddelyn's Workbook]]. They examined the tome and began copying down its secrets, but lacked the time to finish the task, leaving the book where they found it as they continued their expedition. They later returned the same way and again camped at the tower, but found Caddelyn's Workbook gone.

===First Caravan to Sossal===

By [[Tarsakh]] of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Dabron had returned from his expedition in triumph. The Merchant's League published a [[chapbook]] detailing Dabron's travels and his achievements. All this attention enhanced the Merchant's League's profile and importance among the merchant consortiums of the Western Heartlands.

Dabron next planned to build a series of waytowers through [[Damara]] to mark his mapped route, and [[Irlentree]] of the League intended to mount a trade expedition of his own once spring arrived. This course of action was likely to lead Dabron and the Merchant's League into conflict with the newly formed [[Iron Throne]] mercantile alliance.

In any case, little happened for the next few years, perhaps as a result of the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], and Dabron spent the time in Baldur's Gate as one of the city's most notable citizens. Three years later, in the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]], Dabron himself launched the first trade expedition to Sossal. But this was during the invasion of the [[Tuigan Horde]], and a troop of horsemen caught Dabron's caravan and he disappeared. Nothing more came of trade with Sossal and the Merchant's League was nearly bankrupted.

In fact, Dabron was captured by a [[Tuigan]] tribe. While his family thought him dead, he was, in reality, living as a slave in the [[Endless Wastes]]. Such was his influence though that he eventually earned his freedom and was adopted as a full member of the tribe.

Some time on his journeys between the Great Glacier and Sossal, Dabron came across the treasures of the lost [[dwarf]] realm of [[Dareth]], acquiring the ''[[Icemail of Orloebar]]'' and ''[[Snowbeard's avalanche axe]]'', named for King [[Orloebar Snowbeard]] of Dareth.<ref group="note">Dabron's relationship to the lost dwarf realm of Dareth is not known, but the statblock in ''Power of Faerûn'' gives him two powerful magical items sharing names with King Orloebar Snowbeard, founder of Dareth, strongly implying he explored the ruins of Dareth or came across one of the sites the dwarves fled to at its fall. The date of Dabron's discovery of these items is unknown; it has been placed here because it is the latest opportunity for him to find them and because the [[Mountains of Dareth]] lie at the edge of the Endless Wastes.

===Return to Baldur's Gate===
Finally, Dabron received a divine vision from [[Shaundakul]] the Helping Hand, god of explorers, showing that his family was about to fall. So he returned home to Baldur's Gate in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. He arrived less than a day after the death of his uncle, [[Aldeth Sashenstar]], the patriarch of the family, much to the family's relief, and took his place within the [[tenday]]. He also succeeded him as senior member of the Merchant's League.<ref>The ''[[Baldur's Gate (game)|Baldur's Gate]]'' game has Aldeth go on a hunting trip to the [[Cloak Wood]] and run afoul of [[druid]]s in [[1368 DR]]. ''If'' the player intervenes and sides with the druid [[Seniyad]] against Aldeth, then Aldeth is slain. In this case, Dabron subsequently appears in Baldur's Gate to confront the player and seek vengeance for the death of Aldeth. However, ''[[Power of Faerûn]]'' makes it clear he returned in 1372 DR in time for Aldeth's death, negating this possible outcome of ''Baldur's Gate''. Nevertheless, the similar circumstance of his return suggests that, if had returned in 1368 DR, he likely had the same vision, just four years earlier.

Dabron found House Sashenstar long in decline, but his return breathed new life into the family. The Merchant's League was also failing. Thus, he set about restoring the fortunes of House Sashenstar and the League, which he reorganized as a [[priakos]]. But first he had to challenge the [[Iron Throne]]'s monopoly on the trade in weapons in the Heartlands. For this, he gained the backing of the dukes of Baldur's Gate.

Finally, following years of provocation by the Iron Throne, the [[Grand Dukes]] of Baldur's Gate decided to recruit Dabron Sashenstar to break their monopoly. In a meeting on [[Ches 4]] in the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], the Dukes informed Dabron that a [[Sembia]]n merchant called [[Richtar|Rieltar]] was suspected of being responsible for the Throne's effort to start a war between Baldur's Gate and [[Amn]], and he was spending the winter in his mansion outside [[Daerlun]]. Dabron had House agents abduct Reiltar on the [[Ches 12|12th]] and brought him to Baldur's Gate for questioning by [[cleric]]s of [[Waukeen]] who served the House. By the [[Ches 19|19th]], Reiltar was revealed as an alias of [[Richtar]], "the Red Man", a senior leader of the Iron Throne, and the history of the Iron Throne's founding was learned.

On [[Tarsakh 1]], Dabron met with [[Tuth]], an adventurer suspected to be an important member of the [[Knights of the Shield]] secret society, and tried to enlist their aid. They met again on the [[Tarsakh 15|15th]]: the Knights of the Shield agreed to remove [[Sfena]], the [[tiefling]] leader of the Iron Throne, from power in exchange for lucrative trade concessions in [[Balduran]], Baldur's Gate's colony in [[Maztica]]. The next day, the [[devil]]-god [[Gargauth]], secret patron of the Knights of the Shield, captured Sfena and imprisoned her in his dungeons. Her loss began to divide the remaining leaders.

===Arms Caravan to Hillsfar===

}}
The Merchant's League began sponsoring a sizable caravan to transport steel weapons and armor from Baldur's Gate to [[Hillsfar]], with Dabron Sashenstar at its head. News and rumors about it spread throughout the [[Caravan Cities]] by [[Tarsakh 29]], and it was seen as deliberately provoking the Iron Throne. Sure enough, on the [[Tarsakh 30|30th]], assassins working for the Throne murdered agents of the League in [[Arabel]], [[Irieabor]], and [[Scornubel]], almost simultaneously.

Nevertheless, Dabron Sashenstar led his famed caravan east out of Baldur's Gate on [[Mirtul 11]]. However, on [[Kythorn 7]], as the caravan passed through the [[Sunset Mountains]], it was ambushed by [[Zhentilar]] forces from [[Darkhold]]. Dabron and his team repelled them, but they were forced to retreat to [[Hluthvar]] and recover. On the [[Kythorn 9|9th]], [[Zhentarim]] agents assassinated four Iron Throne leaders, as they also sought to seize control of the arms trade in the Heartlands from the failing Iron Throne. The next day, Zhentil Keep proclaimed that all trade in "instruments of tyranny" was solely in the purview of the [[church of Bane]], the Black Lord.

Meanwhile, Dabron's caravan left Hluthvar again on the [[Kythorn 10|10th]], and journeyed to Irieabor. They were again attacked by Zhentilar soldiers as they crossed the [[Bridge of Fallen Men]] on the [[Kythorn 17|17th]]; they beat them back but at a high cost. The much-troubled caravan finally reached Arabel on the [[Kythorn 23|23rd]]. The following [[Kythorn 24|day]], Iron Throne agents attacked the Merchant's League warehouse in Arabel, but were solidly defeated.

In Arabel on [[Kythorn 25]], Dabron Sashenstar made public announcements declaring the monopoly of the Iron Throne to be broken and denying the Zhentarim's control of the arms trade. But, rather than go on to Hillsfar as planned, Dabron sold his weapons and armour right there in Arabel, taking advantage of conflicts in [[Cormanthor]]. There, he received bids from quartermasters serving the armies of Hillsfar, Sembia, [[Seiveril's Crusade]], and even Zhentil Keep.
