'''Rumpadump''' was a [[myconid|myconid sprout]] of [[Neverlight Grove]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationship==
Rumpadump was a friend of [[Stool]].

==Personality==
Rumpadump was quite introverted, in contrast to its companion Stool's outgoing nature. Rumpadump would rather stay back from social encounters and would not release its rapport spores until it was vital.

==History==
Rumpadump lived in Neverlight Grove in the "troupe" of [[Voosbur]]. Directed by [[Zuggtmoy]]'s will, Voosbur led its troupe to [[Gracklstugh]] to collect [[bigwig]] and [[pygmywort]] mushrooms. Rumpadump was the only one that remained free from Zuggtmoy's corruption, and was concerned that Voosbur's "strange spores" had affected the rest of myconid community.
