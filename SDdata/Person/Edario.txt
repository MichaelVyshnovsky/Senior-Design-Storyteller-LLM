'''Edario''' was a villager of [[Highcliff]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Edario was Highcliff's blacksmith, who specialized in crafting armor. However, he was disappointed, since he did not have much business. Later, Edario was asked to join [[Crossroad Keep]] to offer his services.
