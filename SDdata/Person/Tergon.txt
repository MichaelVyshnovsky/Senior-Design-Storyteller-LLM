Tergon was a Neverwintan hero.
In the 10 century DR, the Forge of Spells was used to create various magical items. Tergon was to be made a breastplate that could resist the breath of dragons and provide extra protection against any incoming hits. The human mages of the mine summoned a spectator to watch over the magical creations. However, in 951 DR, a savage group of orcs invaded the area, slaying the mages and others in the mines. Nothing else was known about the history of Tergon.
Circa 1491 DR, his enchanted breastplate was still guarded by the same spectator.
