Infinity was a half-elven adventuring diviner in the 14 century DR.
Infinity was a tall and athletically built half-elf male with long blond hair and pale skin.
Infinity traveled with his trusty quarterstaff, a cloak of elvenkind, and a ring of protection +1.
Infinity learned the art from his father, a retired adventurer due to a blinding curse that ended his career early. Thanks to spending his youth caring for his father, Infinity became proficient in crafting healing potions. In his adult life, Infinity was an adventurer himself, traveling with a group of warriors as their friend and healer.
