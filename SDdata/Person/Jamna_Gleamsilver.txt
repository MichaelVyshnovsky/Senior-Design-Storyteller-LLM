'''Jamna Gleamsilver''' was a [[gnome]] [[assassin]] and a member of the [[Zhentarim]].

==History==
At the start of the [[Tyranny of Dragons]], <span>inÂ </span>[[1489 DR]] Jamna was tasked with a mission to investigate the recent uprising of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. She deduced that they were gathering treasures for the [[Hoard of the Dragon Queen]] and boarded a caravan full of hidden cultists that transported parts of the hoard to the final destination. During the journey, Jamna killed a too-curious cultist disguised as a caravan guard.

===Gameplay===
After the assassination, adventurers could discover Jamna and needed to decide what do with her. She would potentially offer her help against their common enemy.
