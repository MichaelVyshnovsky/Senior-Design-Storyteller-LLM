        "mainbody": "'''Vaxall''', also known as '''Vaxall of the Dying Gaze''' and as '''Xavlal''' to the [[Zhentarim]], was one of the oldest [[beholder]]s in [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Relationships": "Vaxall was a lesser agent of the [[Twisted Rune]]. Vaxall had many minions, among them its elite servants:  the [[battle horror]] [[Gauntlet (battle horror)|Gauntlet]], the [[flameskull]] [[Skullpyr]] and the [[Doom Brigade]], a company of ten [[Helmed horror]]s.",
        "History": "Vaxall was the most powerful beholder of the [[Alimir Hive]] outlander community, which was based out of the beholder city of [[Zokir]]. Its desire was to create a beholder nation on the surface consisting of the [[Arnaden region]], [[Calimshan]], eastern [[Tethyr]] and [[Erlkazar]]. In [[1230 DR]], Vaxall forged an alliance with [[Jhaniloth Puiral]] and, while becoming an [[elder orb]], learned the secrets of magic from her. Since Jhaniloth's destruction in [[1330 DR]], Vaxall began work on a plan to make his desires come true.\n\nIt began by unifying some of the fractious eye tyrants of the Alimir Hive then, in the wake of the [[Time of Troubles]], approached [[Teldorn Darkhope]], ''[[polymorph]]ed'' into the guise of a much younger beholder calling itself '''Xavlal'''. Xavlal offered Darkhope an alliance with a group of beholders that it claimed to represent and together, Xavlal and Darkhope seized power in the city of [[Mintar]] in [[1362 DR]].<ref>{{cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|51}}\n\nThe [[Knights of the Black Gauntlet]], as they had come to be known, came to ally with the [[Zhentarim]] when Teldorn became a member. The Black Network already had a tradition of alliances with beholders so Vaxall retained his influence as long as he feigned allegiance to them.\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], the Knights conquered [[Kzelter]] but it was Vaxall who halted the Knights' advance at that city. It had discovered in the writings of the Oracle of the Deepwash, a reference to the \"[[Knights of the Crescent Moon|Sleeping Legion]]\", who could have been a threat to Vaxall's ambitions. Vaxall elected to try and destroy this force before they could get in its way.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|52}}\n\nVaxall once possessed the ''[[Fanged Shield of Shyk Korort]]'' until it was stolen by [[Aldannar's Band]]. In an act of revenge for the theft, Vaxall annihilated the elven community in the [[Thornwood]] where two of that group's members hailed from.<ref>\n\nVaxall worked to refound the [[beholder cult]]s of the Arnaden Region and placed agents in cities who spread disinformation about the weaknesses of beholders."
