'''Jethro Munroe''' was the leader of a gand of ne'er-do-wells wovharassed inhabitants of [[Liam's Hold]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Jethro was a big and burly brutal-looking loud man, very much the opposite of his younger brother [[Methro Munroe|Methro]]. His face was decorated with many scars. He was an opportunistic and greedy man.

==History==
In 1372 DR, Jethro Munroe, along with his "family members," [[Methro Munroe]], [[Yage Munroe]], [[Sossi Munroe|Sossi "Munroe"]], and [[Fang (dog)|Fang]], camped out on the outskirts of the hamlet of Liam's Hold along the [[Trade Way]]. The gang of vagrants quickly became a nuisance and danger to the community after they started harassing and roughing up local farmers. To guarantee the safety of her village, Mayor [[Wilsey]] listed the help of the individual known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. The adventurer was investigating mysteriously disappearing cattle on the [[Wild Pastures]] and was considered a trusted ally. Mayor offered the Hero the [[Stronghold (Liam's Hold)|Stronghold]] - a small keep outside of the hamlet that once belonged to evil cultists of [[Bhaal]], in exchange for driving the Monroe vagrants away without bloodshed.
