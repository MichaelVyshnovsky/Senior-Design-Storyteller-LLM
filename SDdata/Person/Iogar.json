        "Description": "Iogar wore the uniform [[armor]] of a Zealot of the Absolute – a fur-cloaked night-blue armored garb and a metal [[helmet]]. He had pleasant facial features punctuated by facial [[tattoo]]s and hazel eyes.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Iogar was among those who joined the new religion that sprang in the [[Western Heartlands]]. He was stationed within the Moonrise Towers – the fortress controlled by the Absolute's warlord – General [[Ketheric Thorm]]. Iogar directs new arrivals to the Absolutist army cams as the Moonrise Towers were fully populated. Like many other members of the cult, Zealot Iogar's fate remained unknown as he could've perished in battle when the [[High Harper]] [[Jaheira]] and her [[True Soul]] allies stormed the Moonrise."
