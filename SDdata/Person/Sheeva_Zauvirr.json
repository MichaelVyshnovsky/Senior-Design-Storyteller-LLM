        "mainbody": "'''Sheeva Zauvirr''' was the matron mother of [[House Zauvirr]] until the early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Sheeva ruled [[House Zauvirr]] in [[Ched Nasad]]. In [[1018 DR]], however, she outraged Matron Mother [[Yvonnel Baenre]] and she sent a [[Bregan D'aerthe]] team, composed of [[Jarlaxle]], [[Arathis Hune]], and [[Zaknafein]], to kill her, in collaboration with [[House Nasadra]] and [[Ssipriina Zauvirr]]. After a devious political plot, Sheeva was ousted from her position and exiled from Ched Nasad.\n\nWith a few followers, she went into the [[Underdark]]. However, Jarlaxle, Arathis Hune, and Zaknafein still needed her head and lured Sheeva's group into a trap. During the fighting, only three males survived and Jarlaxle, with a creative use of his [[portable hole]], managed to kill Sheeva despite her many magical protections.",
        "Relationship": "[[Ssipriina Zauvirr]] was her youngest daughter. One son and a daughter of Sheeva followed her after she was exiled from Ched Nasad.",
        "Personality": "Sheeva believed herself better than Matron Baenre and even [[Lolth]]. She fall in love with her image in the mirror, a condition called by drow [[affliction of mirrors]]."
