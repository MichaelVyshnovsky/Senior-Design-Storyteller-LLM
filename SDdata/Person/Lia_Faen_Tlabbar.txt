'''Lia Faen Tlabbar''' was a disgraced [[drow]] [[warlock]] member of [[House Faen Tlabbar]] who ended up residing in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Like many other drow, Lia was ambitious woman and she believed that the surface dwellers were too weak-willed to dominate others.

==History==
Lia was born into the drow House Faen Tlabbar of [[Menzoberranzan]]. She once had the favor of the [[matron mother]], living a life of cruelty and machinations. She proved to be too ambitious and suffered the matron mother's wrath. Lia was exiled into the depths of [[Underdark]]. Desperate and starving, Lia began hearing strange whispers of the entity called [[Zargon]]. With time, the being unlocked depths of mind in the exile drow and led her to the surface world. Now invigorated with a new grand purpose, Lia made her way to the city of Baldur's Gate. Under orders from her otherworldly patron, Lia set out to accumulate power and status in the city to one day have enough to bring Zargon to the [[Prime Material plane]]. In her ambitious search for power, Lia of Hose Faen Tlabbar embarked on adventures and misadventures in the city alongside some other spirited individuals in the 1490s [[DR]].
