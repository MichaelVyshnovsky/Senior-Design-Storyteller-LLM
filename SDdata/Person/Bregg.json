In his fury, Bregg, and those berserkers loyal to him, slew dozens of [[hathran]]s within the first few hours of his rebellion. Bregg and his followers continued to fight until the {{YearlinkName|194}}, when he was killed. As a result of this rebellion, the wychlaran began wearing masks to hide their identities from the public as a safety measure."
