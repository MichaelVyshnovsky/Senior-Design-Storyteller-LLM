        "mainbody": "Jasper Banff was a priest of Tempus who lived within the deitys temple located in the Cloud Peak Mountains.\nWhen the avatar of Tempus appeared in far-off Battledale during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, Jasper and some of his fellow comrades heeded the call of their deity. They left the safety of their home in Amn for the Dalelands far to the east.\nWhen they returned to their temple nearly a decade later, in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, they found their brethren were slain and the holy site taken over by Gamaz and other monks of the Order of the Dark Moon. Before he could escape from the worshipers of Shar, Jasper was imprisoned behind a cage that was magically sealed and could only be opened by answering a riddle."
