        "Description": "When wandering the city, Faceless dressed in a dark cloak to hide his grotesque ruined face. His once [[elf|elven]] features were reduced to a mask of blank white and green goo.",
        "Personality": "He was extremely impatient and somewhat reckless.",
        "History": "He was an accomplished master in Sorcere. He specialized in creating new spells and combining magical effects to enhance their power. Many of the spells taught at Sorcere were the result of his work. He was horribly disfigured after one of his magical combinations backfired and melted the flesh from his face.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1296}}, Gelroos secretly met with [[Malice Do'Urden]], a meeting arranged by [[Jarlaxle]] of [[Bregan D'aerthe]] at the command of Matron Mother [[Yvonnel Baenre]], in a room deep beneath [[Sorcere]]. Gelroos gives Malice a scroll tube containing a powerful spell of “birth magic” in hopes of gaining a healing salve from Malice. He was forbidden from even looking at the scroll by his priestess associates at [[Arach-Tinilith]]. Although it is later revealed that he made a copy of the scroll himself. The magic contained in the scroll was that which was to provide the destructive power necessary for [[House Do'Urden]] to overthrow and destroy [[House DeVir]].\n\nWhile attempting to eradicate [[Alton DeVir]], Gelroos was slain by his brother and student [[Masoj Hun'ett]] with a [[crossbow]]."
