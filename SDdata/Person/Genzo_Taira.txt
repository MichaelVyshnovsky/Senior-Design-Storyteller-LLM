'''Genzo Taira''' was a [[samurai]] adventurer in [[Shou Lung]].

==Personality==
Genzo was a natural leader, instinctively taking charge of any situation, even despite protests from his companions. He preferred quick action to long planning, and had issues fighting alongside women. He adhered strictly to the [[bushido code]]. Nobody could contest his honor, courage, and obedience.

==Relationship==
Genzo was deeply loyal to his daimyo Sugawara.

==History==
Born in [[Kozakura]], Genzo was the youngest man to earn a command from his daimyo, General [[Takenaka Sugawara]].

In [[1358 DR]], Genzo led an attack against the castle of [[Takenaka Okawa]], a rival of his master Sugawara, in [[Iwari Province]]. The castle was burned to the ground. In order to save him from [[ninja]] sent by Ogawa, Sugawara commanded him to travel to [[Shou Lung]]. While in Shou Lung Genzo decided to attend the [[Komite]].
