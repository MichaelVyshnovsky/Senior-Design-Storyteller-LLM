        "mainbody": "Hiero Lue was a bard member of the Dead Eyes, a criminal group from the Lower City that named itself for the grim trophies they collected from the enemies in the late 15 century DR.\nHiero was a dwarvish man with a stern face and a bulbous nose. He had a light skin tone and small dark eyes. The dwarf had well-styled hair dyed blonde, a trimmed beard, and a mustache of light mousy brown color. He wore the flashy green garb of a bar and wielded a simple rapier or a hand crossbow in combat. His instrument of choice was a lute.\nThe bards favorite spells included cloud of daggers, hypnotic pattern, and cure wounds.\nIn the , the Dead Eyes set out to perform a job that would end up setting the gang against the Guild and its leader, Ninefingers. The Guild did not take competition lightly and sent thugs to take care of the Dead Eyes. The band survived and relocated to a new lair. Unbeknownst to Aideen Ni Chuirc â€“ the gangs leader, one of her men was a traitor. Hiero Lue uncovered the secret stash where Aideen hid the loot, including the Guilds coin, and sent a note to Ninefingers, informing the Guild of the Dead Eyes lair and the hidden stashs location. Hiero asked Ninefingers to strike at the hideout swiftly as Maggie Ni Chuirc, the leaders sister, was furious when she discovered Hiero found out her sisters secret. Maggie wanted to kill the bard but reported him to Aideen, who, in turn, stated that once the job was done, she would end the treacherous bard herself. Maggie did not like the idea of keeping the bard alive that long but conceded that her sister knew better as the groups leader. It was unknown if Hiero Lue and the Dead Eyes survived an attack from the Guild or other eager adventurers of Baldurs Gate."
