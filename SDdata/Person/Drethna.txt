Drethna was a half-orc worshiper of Talos and a member of the anchorites of Talos active in southern Neverwinter Wood in the late 15 century DR.
Drethna was a divine spellcaster in service to the god Talos.
In addition, she was a shapechanger who could freely take on the shape of a common wild boar.
In the late 15 century DR, the anchorites of Talos used their magic to send a number of ankhegs to attack a logging camp in Neverwinter Wood, and Drethna was placed in charge of observing whether anyone came to interfere. Rather than to fight, however, she preferred to simply keep watch in her boar shape, and to race off to the anchorite base at the Woodland Manse if she spotted anyone new or suspicious in the forest.
