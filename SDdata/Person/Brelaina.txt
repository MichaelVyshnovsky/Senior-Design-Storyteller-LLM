'''Brelaina''' was the captain of the [[City Watch (Neverwinter)|Watch]] of [[Neverwinter]].

==Description==
[[File:Brelaina appearance.jpg|thumb|left|''Brelaina's appearance.'']]
Brelaina was typically dressed as a soldier. She had a Watch uniform, which she kept it in a good condition. She was attractive.

==Personality==
Brelaina, unlike [[Cormick]], was a good diplomat and thought about her next steps wisely. While she did not want to pester people too much, she expected her soldiers to display some loyalty, competence, and discipline.

==History==
After the city guardhouse was burned and the [[Kalach-Cha]] and companions started to work for the Watch, they needed to go to the Merchant Quarter where her office lay. Brelaina would task them with jobs like stopping bandit shipments, raiding a [[smuggler's warehouse]], and rescuing [[Fihelis]]. Once done, she would give them a pass to [[Blacklake District]].

When the Kalach-Cha was accused of being a murderer, Brelaina had a new task: to go to [[Gannish Estate]] and complete a transaction. Once finished, she would offer a reward. Later, she appeared to be talking with [[Aldanon]] about [[Zhjaeve|the prisoner]] that was held in [[Crossroad Keep]].
