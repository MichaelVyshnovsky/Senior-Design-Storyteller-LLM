'''Theodoric''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Tempus]] in the [[Chondath]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Activities==
Theodoric was the patriarch of Tempus in Chondath and a scholar specializing in the old [[Chessentan Empire]].

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], the [[arcanaloth]] [[Yrkhetep]] manipulated him, making Theodoric insane. Totally mad, Theodoric used the [[Staff of Skulls]] given to him by the [[yugoloth]] to raise an [[undead]] army and lead them to battle.

Theodoric faced in battle the [[Company of the Singing Dawn]], the [[Llandrydd's Steel]], and [[Enhanen]]'s men.

==Personality==
Theodoric suffered schizophrenia. In order to use the staff, he had developed a second personality: an evil cleric from the time of the Chessentan Empire.
