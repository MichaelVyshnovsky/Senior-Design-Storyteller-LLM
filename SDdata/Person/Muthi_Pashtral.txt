Muthi Pashtral was the owner of the Swayback Camel Inn in Bralizzar.
He was unsightly and noisome, making most people queasy about eating in his establishment.
His inn was frequented by camel drivers of evil dispositions, positioning it uniquely for the sharing of rumors about the comings and goings of slavers and such.
