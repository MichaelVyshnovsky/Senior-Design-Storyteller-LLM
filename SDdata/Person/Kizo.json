        "History": "Kizo's entire career consisted of dragging the overeager merchant's wagon across the [[Sword Coast]]. The beast accompanied its owner to the hamlet of [[Liam's Hold]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, where Yani Pavani forced her interior decoration skills on the [[Hero of Daggerford]]â€“the new proud owner of the [[Stronghold (Liam's Hold)|Stronghold]] keep. When the duo's work was over, Yani decided to stay in the quaint town for a while, and Kizo was happy to chew on the hamlet's abundant over-ripe greenery."
