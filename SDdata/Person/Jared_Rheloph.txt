'''Jared Rheloph''', nicknamed '''the Pious''', was a [[human]] [[cleric]] of [[Ilmater]] and [[adventurer]] and a member of the [[Company of the Sundered Orc]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/227/The Reports from Undermountain|16}}

==History==
Five [[adventurer]]s—[[Lorar]], [[Pelops]], Jared Rheloph, [[Cassandra Rulmac]], and [[Wynara Rulmac]]—came together in [[Daggerford]] relatively recently as of 1368 DR and soon headed for [[Waterdeep]], not yet even having a name for their company. ''En route'', they encountered a small [[orc]] raiding band and destroyed them, so they named themselves for this event.

In Waterdeep, they went to the [[Yawning Portal]] inn and began exploring the dungeons of [[Undermountain]] as adventurers do. In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, they elected to locate a supposed treasure hoard on the second level, the [[Arcane Chambers]], which the Waterdhavian merchant-adventurer [[Essimuth Lanys]] claimed to have sighted. They ventured down the well just after sunset on [[Eleint 2]], and had not yet returned by the end of the month. The [[Tymoran]] priest [[Adama Miiralin]] stationed at the inn recorded this in his monthly report to High Priestess [[Seenroas Halvinhar]].

In fact, all five of them had been captured by [[drow]] [[slavery|slavers]] in the Arcane Chambers and were soon to be transported to [[Skullport]].
