        "mainbody": "Caligope was a halfling priest of Brandobaris in the 13 century DR.\nCaligope suffered from arachnophobia.\nThe greatest enemy in Caligopes life was an evil elven wizard by the name of Eli-Makar. Makars wizard tower filled with abnormal varieties of spiders and the tower itself was surrounded by a hedge maze full of giant spiders. For over a year Caligope was so deathly afraid of its arachnid guardians that he refused to even look at the tower. Eventually, he sought to conquer his fear by crafting an enchanted club known as the Evil Spider Crusher of Doom. Through use of the club he managed rob Eil-Makar blind and slaughter dozens of his spiders along the way."
