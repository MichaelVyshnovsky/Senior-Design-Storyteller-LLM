'''Phaerl Godeep''', known as the '''Rebel Mage''', was a male [[drow]] mage of [[House Godeep]] in [[Menzoberranzan]]. He gained notoriety by revolting against the decrees of the priestesses who ruled the city.

He was ultimately captured and [[polymorph (wingless wonder)|polymorphed]] into the helpless and humiliating form of a [[wingless wonder]]. He was presumed to remain trapped like this by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].
