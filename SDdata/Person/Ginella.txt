'''Ginella''' was the chief of the staff of [[Helm Dwarf-Friend]] in [[Sundabar]] in [[1373 DR]].

==Description==
Ginella was a burly and severe elder woman.

==History==
In 1373 DR, Ginella greatly suspected the new companion of her lord, and she was right, because it was [[Aliisza]] in disguise. Ginella made it her duty to watch her.
