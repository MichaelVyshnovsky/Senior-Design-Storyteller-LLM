        "mainbody": "abgar was a sage who wandered the forests and plains of Faer√ªn circa 1358 DR.\nThe sage wore white rags that matched his unkempt hair and beard, and had a green pouch containing herbs around his neck. The old man hobbled as he walked, and had a raspy voice.\nIn 1358 DR, he came across the Heroes of Ascore, and was able to discern their situation. Rabgar told them about the evil forces they would have to face in the near future, and bolstered their resolve. He advised them to seek out three dungeons, and speak to the dwarves of the land, which would lead to great strength and secrets."
