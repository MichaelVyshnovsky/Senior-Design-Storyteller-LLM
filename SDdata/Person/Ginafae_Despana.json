        "mainbody": "Ginafae Despana was a drow who was transformed into a drider, some time before 1311 DR.\nGinafae once lived in Rilauven as a drow. After she was transformed into a drider, she lead a group of driders from the same city and rallied them to join with the Legion of the Chimera. Some time later, the legion made a deal with her, in exchange for the help of the driders. Viciscamera, a chamber that would turn drow into driders, was traded to her. These driders were more bloodthirsty than usual, and many became insane. The drow of Rilauven could recognize Ginafae on sight, and would kill her and the other driders without hesitation.\nShe later wished to sever ties with the evil legion and, upon the suggestion of an adventuring group in 1311 DR, she turned to her powerful brother, Malavon Despana, for answers. Malavon used his impressive magic to turn his sister back into a drow, and she was very thankful to the party of adventurers. In return, she bestowed upon them two powerful items, an enchanted house insignia and piwafwi cloak, on behalf of House Despana."
