'''Hrolf the Unruly''' was a [[human]] captain of the [[Ruathym|Ruathen]] pirate ship ''[[Elfmaid (ship)|Elfmaid]]''. 

==Description==
The captain was a large, broad-shouldered man with skin tanned by the sun and wind. His extremely light-colored braided hair was streaked through with light gray. He had blue eyes, a large mustache, and a beard.

He apparently had a terrible singing voice.

==History==
In [[1361 DR]], he was imprisoned in [[Skullport]] but he escaped from jail with the help of [[Liriel Baenre]]. 

Hrolf was killed as part of a conspiracy against [[Ruathym]] in [[1361 DR]]. His funeral consisted of a large ceremony featuring a funeral bonfire intended to send him and the ''Elfmaid'' into the halls of [[Tempus]]. In honor of him, Liriel changed the figurehead of the ''Elfmaid'' into a figure of Hrolf.

==Relationships==
===Moira===
[[Moira]] was Hrolf's wife. She was short and stout with gray eyes and red cheeks and lived alone on [[Tetris]], a small island in the [[Moonshaes]]. She and Hrolf only ever saw each other during his brief stops there, but that suited them both just fine.

===Xzorsh===
When the [[sea elf]] [[Xzorsh]] was a child, Hrolf saved his life. He pledged to always protect the ''Elfmaid'' and her crew, usually by following it. Hrolf's relationship with Xzorsh was revelatory of Hrolf's particular care for [[elves]].

===Liriel Baenre=== 
Not long after [[Liriel Baenre]] freed Hrolf from prison in Skullport and joined his crew in [[1361 DR]], the two began developing a close relationship. In Ruathym, Liriel stayed with Hrolf at his house and viewed him as a father, as he viewed her as a daughter. She greatly mourned his death.
