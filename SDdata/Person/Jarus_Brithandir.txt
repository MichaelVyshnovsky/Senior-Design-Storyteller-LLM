|We were investigating these ruins when our party got separated in an ambush.<br/>Since then, I've been searching for my friends, and fighting to stay alive. These caves are a lot larger than we expected. I even found a passage that led down into the [[Underdark]].
|Jarus}}
Around the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, Jarus Brithandir and his fellow adventurers [[Helayna]], [[Popkin Shortshanks]], [[Liantor Stoneborn]], [[Kirina Aelorothi]], and [[Tristran of Daggerford]] found an [[Netherese tomb (Stonelands)|ancient tomb]] at the bottom of a crevasse in the [[Stonelands]] of Cormyr. They began dungeon-delving the complex and overcame some [[undead]] defenders before heading further in through a hidden passageway. They found a long series of caves leading deep underground, overcame more hostile inhabitants, and were eventually ambushed by a team of [[Clan Daeronnax]] [[kobold]]s that served the great [[red dragon]] [[Daeronnax]]. The party was split up during the intense fighting, and only Popkin Shortshanks managed to escape the caves entirely. Unable to rescue her friends on her own, she immediately traveled to [[Eveningstar]] to find help.

Popkin found a second party of adventurers willing to assist, and sent them on to the tomb to find her friends. The adventurers discovered Jarus Brithandir after a fierce battle in which he slew a band of walking dead and perched himself on a pile of stones to catch his breath. They gave Jarus a trinket [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] with the ''[[word of recall]]'' [[spell]] that swept him back to the safety of Eveningstar.
