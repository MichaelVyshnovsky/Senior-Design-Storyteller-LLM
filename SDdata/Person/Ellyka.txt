'''Ellyka''' was a [[tiefling]] woman who lived on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She had light pink skin, white hair, and two black curved horns that extended upwards.

==Personality==
She described herself as just "another fool" just trying to survive in the world.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Ellyka encountered a group of [[githyanki]] led by Kith'rak [[Voss]] and his [[red dragon]] steed, facing off against a contingent of [[Flaming Fist]] soldiers at a canyon crossing. She made sure to stay clear away from the group and not draw any unwanted attention to herself.

The body of Ellyka could later be found in the dungeons of [[CrÃªche Y'llek]], having been interrogated by the githyanki whilst searching for the Blood of Lathander.
