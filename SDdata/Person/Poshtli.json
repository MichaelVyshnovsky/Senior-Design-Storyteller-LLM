        "History": "Poshtli was the nephew of [[Naltecona]] and one of his wisest advisors.\n\nIn [[1361 DR]], Poshtli sensed something was wrong and went in search of answers. After a stop at the [[House of Tezca]], where he received a vision from the [[Sunstone (lake)|Sunstone]], he went to [[Ulatos]] in time to save [[Erixitl]]'s life from one of the [[Ancient Ones]].\n\nHe befriended both Erixitl and [[Halloran]] and together they decided to work for peace between [[Nexal]] and the [[Golden Legion]], which had just arrived from [[Faer√ªn]].\n\nPoshtli went back to Nexal but thanks to the plots of the worshipers of [[Zaltec]], a battle was fought between the legionaries and [[Nexalan]]s. Afterward, Naltecona decided to submit to the Legion's leader [[Cordell]]. When Naltecona was taken hostage by the legionaries, Poshtli was named substitute regent.\n\nWith the help of Erixitl and Halloran, Poshtli tried to free his uncle, a key player in stopping Zaltec's plots, but they failed and so started the [[Night of Wailing]].\n\nPoshtli survived and helped lead the column of refugees. He joined Halloran's party at [[Twin Visages]] and was decisive in killing both [[Coton]] and [[Darien]], banishing both Zaltec and [[Qotal]] from [[Maztica]].\n\nAt last he decided to live in the new city of [[Tukan]]."
