Patriarch Thyrius Jorman was the head priest of the temple of Oghma in Reddansyr during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Unlike some other Oghmite priests, Patriarch Thyrius was stringent with the knowledge his clergy bestowed upon to others. 
He was aided in his priestly duties by a group of 14 assistants.
