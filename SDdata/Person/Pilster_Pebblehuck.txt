'''Pilster Pebblehuck''' was a [[halfling]] baker in [[Elturel]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relations==
He and his wife [[Merrywile]] had three children.

==History==
When the whole city of Elturel was transported to [[Avernus]], first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], in the {{YearlinkName|1494}}, Pilster and his family hid in their bakery's basement. When their food started to run out, Pilster ventured into the streets to look for supplies, but was discovered in an alleyway by an [[imp]]. But [[Perchillux]] offered Pilster a deal: enough food for a month in exchange for his very soul. Desperate, Pilster considered signing the convoluted contract printed on parchment made from halfling skin. Adventurers might have intervened then, possibly determining the contract to be a trap that would have given Perchillux not just Pilster's soul, but those of all his family, and slaying or scaring the imp off.
