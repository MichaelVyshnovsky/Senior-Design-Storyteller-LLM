Haravak was a wandering half-orc ranger in Thar in 1374 DR.
In 1374 DR, Haravak witnessed an adventuring party being abducted by some orcs, as well as large-scale orc activities around the Xûl-Jarak citadel. He hoped to sell this information to anyone interested, like the Lords of Melvaunt, the Zhentarim, or others.
Haravak was always with his wolf companion Grùnhawr.
