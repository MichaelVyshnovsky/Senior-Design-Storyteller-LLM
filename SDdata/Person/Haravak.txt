'''Haravak''' was a wandering [[half-orc]] [[ranger]] in [[Thar]] in [[1374 DR]].

==History==
In 1374 DR, Haravak witnessed an adventuring party being abducted by some [[orc]]s, as well as large-scale orc activities around the [[Xûl-Jarak]] citadel. He hoped to sell this information to anyone interested, like the Lords of [[Melvaunt]], the [[Zhentarim]], or others.

==Relationship==
Haravak was always with his [[wolf]] companion [[Grùnhawr]].
