        "mainbody": "'''Myshik Morueme''' was a [[Half-dragon|half]]–[[blue dragon]] [[hobgoblin]] and a member of [[Blood of Morueme|Clan Morueme]].",
        "Description": "Myshik had blue leathery wings with which he could glide but not fly.",
        "Abilities": "Myshik was able to use a breath weapon of electricity. He could apparently ride a [[giant fly]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Myshik was sent by his uncle, [[Nahaunglaroth]] the [[blue dragon]], to follow and defeat [[Kaanyr Vhok]], who was encroaching on the territory of Clan Morueme. In exchange, he would receive the honor of the clan. Myshik met up with Vhok and [[Zasian Menz]], a priest of [[Cyric]], in [[Sundabar]] during an assault of the [[Scoured Legion]] and joined them as they traveled through the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. One night as they rested in an extradimensional mansion (activated by an archway given to Vhok by Nahaunglaroth), Myshik slew their guide, [[Kurkle]], and stole the mansion, trapping Vhok and Zasian inside. They escaped, however, and Myshik intercepted them at the [[City of Brass]] just as they passed through a portal to the [[House of the Triad]].\n\nMyshik followed the two through the portal some time later, arriving inside the belly of the [[storm dragon]] [[Tekthyrios]], who was being possessed by Zasian. Not knowing this, Myshik allied with his dragon cousin and aided Zasian in freeing [[Kashada|Kashada the Nightwraith]]. The three then traveled to [[Dweomerheart]], where they were able to create a disturbance that allowed them to steal [[Azuth]]'s [[Old Staff|staff]], which Cyric used to slay [[Mystra]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}.\n\nIn the magical backlash from Mystra's death, Myshik was merged with the [[astral deva]] [[Micus]] to form an insane abomination, with Myshik's face emerging from Micus's gut and the rest of his body emerging from behind like a centaur. Micus-Myshik was captured by the [[marilith]] [[Vhissilka]] and later [[Dominate person|dominated]] (by use of a cuff) by Vhok to taunt the [[angel]] [[Tauran]] in the [[House of the Triad]]. Micus-Myshik was then trapped by a spell cast by the [[drow]] wizard [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] and slain by the knight [[Kael]]. As Micus-Myshik died, Myshik's head let loose a final blast of lightning magic that killed Pharaun.",
        "Possessions": "Myshik wielded an axe, which had been stolen from a [[dwarf|dwarven]] tomb long ago.\n\nMyshik carried a light crystal.",
        "Relationships": "Myshik's father was [[Roraurim]] the blue wyrm, who was the brother of [[Nahaunglaroth]], the leader of Clan Morueme."
