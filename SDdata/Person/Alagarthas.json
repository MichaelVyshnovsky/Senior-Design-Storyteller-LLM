        "mainbody": "Alagarthas was a wild elf prince of the Misty Forest in the 15 century DR.\nAlagarthas considered himself the heir apparent of ancient Miyeritar and dreamed of one day ruling a similar kingdom. He planned to offer his allegiance to the dwarves of Mount Illefarn in order to gain strong allies. Alagarthas had the breeding, the intelligence, and the charisma of a future great leader, not to mention superior fighting skills.\nLike many of his kin, Alagarthas wielded shortswords and a longbow into battle, and he was dressed in a suit of magical studded leather armor +1 made from dragonhide.\nAlagarthas was the son of Melandrach, the king of the Misty Forest. However he disagreed with his father about the elves future and wanted to resurrect the ancient nation of Illefarn and rule it.\nAround 1480 DR, when fire elementals destroyed the woods of Laughing Hollow, with his goals in mind, he and his retinue abandoned the Misty Forest and went to help the local wood elves in order to get away from his fathers woodland court and make a name for himself and his cause.\nAfter several failed attempts to drive off the Green Dragon Chuth, Alagarthas was approached by a Hag named Endelyn Moongrave, who claimed that he would defeat the Dragon, but would be killed in the process. She offered him an alternate future, which could only come true if the prince came to the Feywild domain of Prismeer for a year. After a year that seemed to drag on forever, Alagarthas found that he had only one way home, a path that would only become visible if he managed to light eight beacons. However, his attempts to light them were constantly thwarted by a band of actors that Endelyn had transformed into Perytons.\nAlthough he was trapped in the Feywild for a time, Alagarthas got his wish, as Chuth, along with Prince Neronvain, was thwarted by a group of adventurers."
