'''Ssuntyr''' was a [[wizard]] and vengeful former cobbler and ex-Elder of the Council of the village of [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Everwinking Eye: At Home in Maskyr's Eye|21}}{{Cite polyhedron/58/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|25-26}}

==Activities==
''Circa'' [[1341 DR]], Ssuntyr was discovered to have dealings with [[drow]] and even worse creatures of the [[Underdark]]. Worse still, he had used [[magic|his art]] to make a neighbor ill and force her to sell him her farm prior to her death. The Council deposed the villain and the villagers drove him out of the village, but the fight turned bloody, seriously injuring two farmers and killing a third, [[Thurl Northmane]]. Finally, [[Arbrest Thunwyllun]] pierced Ssuntyr with his [[pitchfork]] and [[Hulthoon Maer]] almost lopped off one of his hands with his [[axe]], but Ssuntyr escaped through a ''[[portal]]'' of fire opened by a [[magical device]].

But Ssuntyr survived these grievous injuries and arrived at his hideout in the [[Giantspike Mountains]] near the town of [[Kurth (town)|Kurth]]. He used [[potion]]s to heal his other wounds, but [[regenerate|regrowing]] his almost-severed hand took much more time, expense, and effort to achieve.

So, to earn back some coin, Ssuntyr had to become an [[adventurer]] and a mage-for-hire under an array of false identities in [[Iriaebor]], [[Teziir]], and [[Westgate]]. After several years of this, he was a far more capable worker of magic, and ready to get his revenge against his old neighbors. 

Using his ''polymorph'' magic to pose as an itinerant seed merchant, ''circa'' [[1357 DR]], Ssuntyr planned to return to Maskyr's Vale and take a room at [[The Wizard's Hand]] inn. Then he would begin using his magic to murder the older villagers, his contemporaries from sixteen years ago, and kill as many as he could until he was caught out. His plot would risk casting suspicion on any other strangers who happened to be in the village at the time, and he would be only too happy to frame them for his crimes.As a short adventure idea, Ssuntyr's plan is described in future and present tense, suggesting he had not begun his murders or even arrived in Maskyr's Eye as of the time of writing.

==Personality==
Ssuntyr was cunning, cautious, patient, and coldly efficient in carrying out his crimes.

==Abilities==
He prepared [[spell]]s of ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[hold portal]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', and ''[[web]]''.

==Possessions==
Ssuntyr wore a ''[[ring of protection]] +6'' and a ''[[ring of the ram]]''. He possessed [[scroll]]s of ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[polymorph other]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', ''[[remove curse]]'', and ''[[wizard eye]]''. He also created ''[[feather token]]s'' of his own design that placed a short-lived ''[[silence]]'' on the user. He was also armed with a ''[[wand of fireballs]]'' and had two ''[[Potion of extra-healing|potions of extra-healing]]''.

==Tactics==
Ssuntyr's plan was to use his ''invisibility'' and ''silence'' magic to avoid detection as he lay in wait from atop roofs and stone walls and strike at his targets with ''magic missiles''. He would attack when they were alone and circumstances were best whenever he could. Then he would flee into the forest to hide until his magic renewed.

He planned to target [[Khonduil Ammargath]], the local [[cleric]] of [[Tymora]], last so that he could capture and interrogate and finally kill him at his leisure. Ssuntyr believed Khonduil had some knowledge about or even a link to the magical legacy of the [[archmage]] [[Maskyr One-Eye]], and he wanted to extract all the information he could and then search for it himself.
