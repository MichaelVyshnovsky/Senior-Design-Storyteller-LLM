Tawn was a traveling performer that performed a tumbling act with their siblings in various cities during the late 15 century DR.
Tawn and their siblings were somewhat peculiar. When out in town together, they sometimes only gave rude grunts and curt nods to anyone that approached them as a group. Only when someone proved particularly entertaining did they even offer their names.
Tawn was one of three triplets, along with Tane and Tine.
Either Tawn or one of the other siblings had a bag of  magic dust that would expand into a large cloud when thrown to the floor. It was used in the act that they performed.
Some time during the 1480s DR, Tawn, Tane, and Time, along with the rest of their troupe, stopped in the city of Phlan on the Moonsea North. When not performing their act for the citys residents, the trio stopped in at Madame Freonas Tea Kettle.
