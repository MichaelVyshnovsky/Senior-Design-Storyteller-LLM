Helgore Ulitarathulm was a shadovar special agent.
Helgore, Maerandor, and three other shadovar were trained personally by the High Prince Telamont Tanthul of Thultanthar under the orders of Shar to become the personal blades of the High Prince.
In 1487 DR, Telamont gave Helgore and Maerandor their missions. Helgore would go to Myth Drannor.
He managed to infiltrate the city and went to the crypts. There he battled and destroyed many Baelnorn liches but at last Helgore was killed by the coronal Ilsevele Miritar.
