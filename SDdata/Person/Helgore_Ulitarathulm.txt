'''Helgore Ulitarathulm''' was a [[shadovar]] special agent.

==Activities==
Helgore, [[Maerandor]], and three other shadovar were trained personally by the High Prince [[Telamont Tanthul]] of [[Thultanthar]] under the orders of [[Shar]] to become the personal blades of the High Prince.

==History==
In [[1487 DR]], Telamont gave Helgore and Maerandor their missions. Helgore would go to [[Myth Drannor]].

He managed to infiltrate the city and went to the crypts. There he battled and destroyed many [[Baelnorn lich]]es but at last Helgore was killed by the [[coronal]] [[Ilsevele Miritar]].
