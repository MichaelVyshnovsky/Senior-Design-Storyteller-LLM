        "History": {
            "The Horde Wars": "In [[Tarsakh]] of [[1360 DR|the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]], Torg was the first ruler to respond via letter to King Azoun IV's call for a crusade against the [[Tuigan Horde]], with Torg committing 2000 dwarven soldiers to the [[Army of the Alliance]]. This helped sway other allies to the cause.\n\nTorg, Alusair and the 2000 dwarves set out and camped south of [[Uthmere]] in the [[Great Dale]], where Azoun and his Court Wizard [[Vangerdahast]] were to meet them. Torg sent an escort to meet them, but the escort disappeared. Azoun and Vangerdahast [[teleport]]ed outside the camp instead, and Torg berated [[Pryderi mac Dylan]] and another sentry for trying to capture them for spies. Torg sent Pryderi to take a patrol and find the escort while he showed Azoun around the camp and discussed tactics, and Azoun reunited with Alusair. Pryderi and Vangerdahast returned with news that orcs had slain the escort, and Torg chose to wait for the orc army to attack.\n\nThe orcs arrived and turned out to be the army sent by [[Zhentil Keep]] to join the Alliance, led by [[Vrakk]]. Torg prepared to withdraw his force from the Alliance rather than fight alongside orcs, and doubted a cause that had such allies, until Azoun reminded him of his honor and commitment to the crusade. Torg agreed to stay but demanded blood-payment, the deaths of the three orcs responsible for the slain escort. Torg, Alusair and the dwarves then marched to [[Telflamm]] rather than travel by ship, or travel with the orcs.\n\nTorg marched his army past [[Forest of Lethyr]] rather than risking going through it, fearing [[elves]] and other forest-folk would lay traps for them. When the [[centaur]]s of [[Tribe Pastilar]] rode out to greet them, Torg in his distrust was curt and impatient with both their herald and their chieftain, [[Jad Eyesbright]]. Though the centaurs gave food and offered guides through their forest that would speed their journey, Torg accepted the food but rejected their offer, insulting Jad by suggesting the centaurs were allied with their enemies and intended to lead them into a trap. The centaurs left.\n\nThus the Earthfast dwarves arrived late at the [[First Battle of the Golden Way]] on the 3rd of [[Flamerule]], a costly delay for the Army of the Alliance, Torg commanded his troops well, first fending off 5000 horsemen and crushing them between dwarven phalanxes. Then he wanted to stay and collect Tuigan heads as trophies in the Earthfast fashion, but was dissuaded by Alusair. The dwarves supported the remaining Alliance army and were just in time to save their infantry from being wiped out by the Tuigan.\n\nTorg later participated in discussions on strategy with Azoun, Vrakk and other leaders, agreeing to Azoun's plan to have the dwarves dig hundreds of small holes in a defensive barrier to cripple the Tuigan horses and halt their charge. After Vrakk requested to serve in Azoun's king's guard in the next battle, Torg demanded to be allowed to serve too.\n\nIn the [[Second Battle of the Golden Way]] on the 5th of Flamerule, the [[Tuigan]] [[Khahan]], [[Hoekun Yamun]], charged for Azoun, but Torg stood before him, apparently desiring the honor of slaying the khahan and taking his head. Yamun rode at Torg, who dodged out of the way and was exposed to attack. Ironlord Torg was slain and later trampled into the mud.\n\nFollowing the battle, the dwarves interred their dead and Ironlord Torg in a stone cairn on the battlefield, and left the next day, returning to Earthfast."

Thus his colors were red and black; Azoun IV decided they represented \"blood and thunder\".\n\nTorg and his elite guard all wore a black [[surcoat]] emblazoned with the phoenix-and-hammer symbol."
