'''Jussko Kwahn''' was a [[bard]]ic [[Harper]] agent in [[Cormyr]] during the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}
{{Quote
|I am a Harper. You have heard of our order? I came in search of a [[Oriphaun Huntsilver|missing nobleman]]. 'Tis a long tale - but I believed the Druid [[Halsaime]] might help me find him. And I thought the [[Peron Uthe|master of this house]] might just lead me to Halsaime.
|Jussko in [[Uthe Lodge]]
}}
==Description==
He had bright orange-red hair and pale skin, wore nondescript gray light armor and carried a [[bow]].

==Personality==
{{Quote
|Well met! I had grown weary of nought but bark and leaves for company. You are aware… this place is far from safe? But of course you are. Danger's an old song in your songbook, I can see.
|Jussko in Uthe Lodge

Jussko was rather grand and verbose, as befitting a bard.

==History==
{{Quote
|Wait, wait! Hold back! Nobody touch [[Halsaime's staff|that staff]]! I have a scroll for this!<br/>There, I fixed it. I mean, we fixed it. Thanks for your, uh, help.

Following the [[Shadovar invasion of Wheloon]] and [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]]'s disappearance with a ''[[Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll|Nether Scroll]]'', Jussko joined [[Rina Belostos]]'s team of Harpers in [[Eveningstar]] to try and get a handle on the situation, only to arrive during a [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar|massive drow invasion]]. He and his partners [[Tarim Inavule]] and [[Kirinel Zay]] determined that the [[druid]] [[Halsaime]] knew something, and tried to find the elusive druid through the [[ranger]] [[Peron Uthe]] at [[Uthe Lodge]]. Unfortunately, Peron was functionally dead, having been transformed into a [[red musk zombie]] at the [[Eveningstar War Hospital]], and had "infected" his home with a horde of monstrous creatures led by the insane [[dryad]] [[Sylvie]]. Jussko infiltrated the plant-choked home, not enjoying the reception, and eventually met up with [[adventurer]]s sent in by the concerned local [[Eolynn Arva]]. Together they overcame the [[wood woad]] [[Falcata]] and destroyed the dryad Sylvie, saving the day.

Deciding that the druidic situation was more immediately pressing, Jussko, Kirinel, and Tarim changed focus to Halsaime himself and began scouting out [[Thorngap]] in order to find the hidden refuge at [[Druid's Deep]]. Once again, he arrived well before the adventurers sent to assist him, and Halsaime caught and [[petrified]] him. Fortunately for Jussko his backup showed up before anything worse could happen, and Halsaime was killed in battle, breaking the flesh-to-stone transformation upon him. Jussko took a moment to recover, then produced a special magical scroll for that exact situation—one that (mostly) safely destroyed the [[Halsaime's staff|evil staff]] that had subverted Halsaime and caused the whole disaster.
