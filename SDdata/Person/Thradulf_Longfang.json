        "mainbody": "Thradulf Longfang was a chieftain of the Red Tiger tribe of Uthgardt barbarians living in the Cold Wood in the midâ€“14 century DR. He led the tribe with a heartless demeanor and his wrath struck fear into his own people.\nAlthough he had the authority as chieftain of the Red Tigers, he was in reality a puppet of the tribes shamans.\nHe was known among his own tribe as a particularly cruel individual.\nThradulf was born the nephew to Adalwulf Longfang, a wise and long-ruling leader of the Cold Wood barbarians. His cousin Shinoras, Adalwulfs son, was in line to succeed his father as ruler but was killed while out on a hunting expedition. Thradulf, who had become a strong voice among the tribesmen, became Adalwulfs heir and ascended as chieftain in 1368 DR."
