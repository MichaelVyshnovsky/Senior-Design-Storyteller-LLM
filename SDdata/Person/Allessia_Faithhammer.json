        "mainbody": "llessia Faithhammer was a human cleric of Helm from Secomber.\nAllessia was summoned to Baldurs Gate from her home in Secomber by her mentor, Huros. She came to the city in hopes of defending it from the threat posed by Eldrith the Betrayer and her Dark Alliance. However, by the time of her arrival, Eldrith had already been defeated and her Onyx Tower banished from Toril. Instead, she found herself pitted against the designs of Mordoc SeLanmere as well as other nefarious forces in the Western Heartlands.\nShe had the option of working for the Church of Helm in Baldurs Gate, which was run by Huros, and of donating large sums of gold to the church to fund various projects, including an orphanage, additional fortifications to the city walls, and a warship to help defend the harbor of Baldurs Gate. Allessia also had the option of traveling to an unholy mausoleum on the churchs orders. There, she would have to defeat a small army of undead creatures led by Goreth Vileblack, a cleric of Cyric.\nAllessia was very devoted to the Church of Helm and followed its doctrine of shielding the innocent from harm. She saw her work as a divine duty and for the greater good.\nthumb|Allessia performing flame strike on zombies.\nAs a cleric of good alignment, Allessia could turn undead, either sending lesser undead fleeing or disintegrating them completely.
