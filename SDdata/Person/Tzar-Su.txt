'''Tzar-Su''' was a malicious [[spirit]] in [[Shou Lung]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
In 1358 DR, Tzar-Su unleashed a [[gorgon]] he had created from the [[Qui Ren]] family's plowing ox inside the [[House of Qui Ren]]. He  unleashed the monster because he was offended he not personally been invited to the inn (he was a spirit who took offense at all manner of slights, real and imagined). However, some adventurers and the [[wu jen]] [[Ko Ho San]] were on hand to deal with the gorgon and Tzar-Su.
