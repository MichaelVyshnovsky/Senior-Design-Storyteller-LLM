'''Brianne Dragonsbane''' was queen of the [[Kingdom of Bloodstone]] in the mid–15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Brianne Dragonsbane was assassinated in the {{YearlinkName|1459}}, and the civil unrest caused by this event distracted the Kingdom of Bloodstone from the mustering army of the [[Warlock Knights]] in [[Vaasa]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}

Shortly before her death, she had an illegitimate son named [[Kaggen Entreri]]. The pregnancy was kept a secret from all but her most trusted advisors.
