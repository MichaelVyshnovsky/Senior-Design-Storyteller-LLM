        "mainbody": "Zook was a yellow faerie dragon in Cormanthor in the late 15 century DR.\nThe goddess Mielikki herself tasked Zook with a mission to protect the Cormanthor woodlands.\nCirca 1486 DR, a family of jackalweres established themselves in the area and Zook didnt have the power to defeat them, so she used her magic powers to scare away people until an adventuring party arrived.\nZook was a little too dour for a faerie dragon. Although she enjoyed a joke at another persons expense as much as the next faerie dragon, Zook simply didnt laugh as long about it. Zook liked company, so her tactic of scaring people away was difficult for her.\nZook was an ally of the Harpers."
