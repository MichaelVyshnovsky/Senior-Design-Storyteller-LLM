        "Activities": "The goddess [[Mielikki]] herself tasked Zook with a mission to protect the Cormanthor woodlands.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], a family of [[jackalwere]]s established themselves in the area and Zook didn't have the power to defeat them, so she used her magic powers to scare away people until an adventuring party arrived.",
        "Personality": "Zook was a little too dour for a faerie dragon. Although she enjoyed a joke at another person's expense as much as the next faerie dragon, Zook simply didn't laugh as long about it. Zook liked company, so her tactic of scaring people away was difficult for her.",
        "Relationship": "Zook was an ally of the [[Harpers]].{{Cite adventurers league/Harried in Hillsfar|28}}"
