Huntileir was a dwarven weaponsmith in Tilverton in the 14 century DR.
Hunteleir was  tall and 3 feet wide. He possessed extraordinarily thick muscles, particularly the biceps. He had a thin white beard around the edge of his jaw.
He always carried at least four throwing axes, which he was very proficient with.
Around 1358 DR, Huntileir ran a weapons shop in Tilverton, making and selling axes, swords, and a variety of other implements.
