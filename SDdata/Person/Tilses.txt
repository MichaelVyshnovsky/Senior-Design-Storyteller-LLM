Tilses was a tiefling member of the Hellriders, protectors of the holy city of Elturel, during the late 15 century DR.
Tilses had light red skin and curly black hair she kept short.
She wore a suit of padded armor and carried with her a longsword.
Tilses served with the Hellriders until the disaster known as the Descent befell Elturel in the . After the city was pulled briefly down to the plane of Avernus in the Nine Hells, all of the citys tieflings – including those in the Hellriders – were exiled from the city. Tilses joined Commander Zevlor as he led a group of his people west along the Risen Road towards Baldurs Gate, and aided him as the group took refuge at the Emerald Grove druidic enclave.
