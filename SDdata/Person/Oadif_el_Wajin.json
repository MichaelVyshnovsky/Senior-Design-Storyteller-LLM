        "mainbody": "'''[[Alzhedo dictionary#A|Amhir]]<ref group=\"note\">''Amhir'' was usually a naval rank, not a rank of the [[Amlakkar]]. Perhaps because [[Teshburl]] was so navy-oriented, the Amlakkar there used naval ranks instead of land-based military ranks. Oadif el Wajin''' was a [[half-elf]] officer of [[Amlakkar|el Amlakkar]] in the naval town of [[Teshburl]] in [[Calimshan]].",
        "Personality": "Oadif was an individual who truly wanted to see the best in his community. Unfortunately, he doubted that this was possible, because of all of the corruption in [[Nallojal|el Nallojal]] and in the [[Mond el Vitendi|sultan's]] government. Nevertheless, he wanted to do more to help others who were suffering.",
        "Relationships": "Oadif's best friend was [[Kanar el Ehrat]], a clumsy hulk of a man known as \"the Ox\". As of [[1370 DR]], Oadif had no idea that the clumsiness was an act; Kanar was in fact the sixteenth [[Red Rysal]] and was contemplating asking Oadif to join him in the role, since the two men shared the same opinions on the state of their town. Kanar's only hesitation was that Oadif had no magical training, and at least one of the persons holding the role of Red Rysal was traditionally a [[wizard]].",
        "History": "Oadif was once named '''Kamal'''. He was one of the [[Alzhedo dictionary#J|jhasinni]] of the bitter, old wife of [[Pasha]] Nadjar in the town of [[Volothamp]]. After suffering this abuse in the slave system of Calimshan, he escaped and fled all the way west. Throughout his youth (from the point of view of a half-elf) he took on many different guises, until he found himself with a new name as an officer in the town watch of Teshburl."
