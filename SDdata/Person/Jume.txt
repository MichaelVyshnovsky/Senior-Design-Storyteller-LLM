Jume was a wizard of Baldurs Gate who lived several hundred years before the Time of Troubles, presumably in the 11th century DR. She was renowned for her contributions to the Art in the field of illusion spells, despite not being an illusionist herself.
She was known as having a good-humored nature and for being clever of wit, specifically in how she crafted illusions.
Her personal spellbook, the arcanabula of Jume, was still educating arcane spellcasters as of 1359 DR. Among several, more common spells, it contained four that could be attributed to her creation.
*Dark mirror
*Prismatic eye
*Shadow gauntlet
*Shadow hand
