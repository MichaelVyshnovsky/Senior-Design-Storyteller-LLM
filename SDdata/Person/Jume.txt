'''Jume''' was a [[wizard]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] who lived several hundred years before the [[Time of Troubles]], presumably in the 11th century [[DR]]. She was renowned for her contributions to [[the Art]] in the field of [[illusion]] [[spell]]s, despite not being an illusionist herself.

==Personality==
She was known as having a good-humored nature and for being clever of wit, specifically in how she crafted illusions.

==Works==
Her personal [[spellbook]], the [[arcanabula of Jume]], was still educating arcane spellcasters as of [[1359 DR]]. Among several, more common spells, it contained four that could be attributed to her creation.

===Crafted spells===
*''[[Dark mirror]]''
*''[[Prismatic eye]]''
*''[[Shadow gauntlet]]''
*''[[Shadow hand]]''
