==History==
Agnes Shveitz was a woman who was murdered, presumably being one of the many victims of the [[Cult of Bhaal]], in or shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. She was survived by her wife, Droona Shveitz – a [[gold dwarf]]. Agnes was buried in the [[Lower City Graveyard]], next to the [[Hhune Mausoleum]]. The gravestone was etched with a single inscription: "Beloved Agnes Shveitz. Her smile shined like a thousand suns." In 1492 DR, Agnes's wife, Droona, could often be seen mourning at the gravestone. However, her grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and the woman's body – risen as a [[zombie]] by [[Nina Dortmell]], a talented child with the [[gift]], who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother.
