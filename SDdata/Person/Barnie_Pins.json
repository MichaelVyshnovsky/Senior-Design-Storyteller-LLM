Don't want my sheep to die, either. This Absolute thing on the horizon STINKS. Not in the good way a sheep stinks, but in the bad way that a corpse does. So if any of you are out there, can you fix it?''|Barnie Pins}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the fledgling religion of [[the Absolute]] emerged and turned into a cultist crusade with an army moving from the [[Moonrise Towers]] to the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. While some citizens were preoccupied with the \"threat\" of refugees or felt protected, Barnie Pins was terrified of the impending doom. Being faithless, Barnie knew nothing about prayers, gods, nor religion. He supposed that a [[sheep]] sacrifice would be in order to pray for salvation. But in desperation, Barnie left a prayer note in [[Stormshore Tabernacleâ€Ž]], asking a god, any god, to hear his pleads and solve the threat."
