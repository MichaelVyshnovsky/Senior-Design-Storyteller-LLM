'''Haresk Malorn'''<ref group="note">On page 34 of [[The Dalelands (sourcebook)]] his name is spelled "Haresk" while on page 37 it is spelled "Heresk", twice. was the High Councilor and Mistran of the [[Council of Six (Mistledale)|council]] that ruled over [[Mistledale]], the [[Dalelands]], between [[1367 DR|1367]] and [[1372 DR]]. He also commanded the [[Riders of Mistledale]], Mistledale's mounted defenders. Despite this, Haresk was known as more of a wise and compassionate merchant rather than a true warrior.Despite this, Haresk was well liked by the people of Mistledale.

The high councilor would carry a black "''[[Rod of Peldan|rod of office]]''", and there was speculation that Haresk's rod of office was in actuality a ''[[rod of rulership]]''. He would very appear at the head of his troops, but if he was required to do so, he would use as much magical armor and protective magic as possible.

The [[House of the High Councilor]] was Haresk Malorn's residence and it was the largest building in [[Ashabenford]]. It was also used by the Council of Six as a nearly official seat of government.

==History==
As there were more attacks from the [[drow]] as of 1372 DR, Haresk felt that he might have to step down for someone with more military experience.
