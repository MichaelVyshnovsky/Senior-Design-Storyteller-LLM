'''Bruenor Battlehammer I''' was a [[dwarf]] of [[Clan Battlehammer]] and the 2{{nd}} King of [[Mithral Hall]], and the namesake of the more widely known 8{{th}} and 10{{th}} king of Mithral Hall, [[Bruenor Battlehammer]].<ref>

==History==
He was the youngest of [[Gandalug Battlehammer]]'s three sons, and inherited the throne despite not being the oldest but rather the most fitting. Bruenor led a thousand dwarves of the clan to [[Mithral Hall]] and commenced work on building the Undercity.

Towards the end of his life, Bruenor faked his death so he could abdicate his throne and go on a final adventure free of responsibility.<ref>

It was his personal battle armor that became the official royal armor of all future Battlehammer kings.
