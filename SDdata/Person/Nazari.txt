'''Nazari''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Abeir]], and one of the ancestors of [[Clan Kepeshkmolik]].

==History==
Nazari was one of the seven wise elders who raised [[Shasphur]]. She was considered the wisest among them.

One day, Shaspur came up with a plan to free the dragonborn slaves from the [[gold dragon]] [[Raurokhymdhar]]. His plan, however, had a flaw: he could not save the elders. Nazari consulted with the other elders, and then convinced Shaspur to flee without them. Nazari was killed by Raurokhymdhar while misleading the dragon so Shaspur and the other slaves could flee to freedom.
