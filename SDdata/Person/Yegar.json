        "mainbody": "Lord Yegar was the ruler of Citadel Rashemar during the mid 14 century DR.\nYegar was arrogant and grossly incompetent. Despite this, he still wielded a great deal of political power within Rashemen.\nLord Yegar dispatched patrols to monitor the Sunrise Mountains. He spent most of his time pressing Rashemens rights to the copper mines located in Murgh√¥m. He claimed this because of ancient borders and not present day alignment."
