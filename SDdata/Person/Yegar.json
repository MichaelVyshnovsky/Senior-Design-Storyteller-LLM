        "Personality": "Yegar was arrogant and grossly incompetent. Despite this, he still wielded a great deal of political power within [[Rashemen]].",
        "Activities": "Lord Yegar dispatched patrols to monitor the [[Sunrise Mountains]]. He spent most of his time pressing Rashemen's rights to the copper mines located in [[Murgh√¥m]]. He claimed this because of ancient borders and not present day alignment."
