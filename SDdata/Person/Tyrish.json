        "mainbody": "yrish was a legendary Pharaoh from the days of Mulhorandi antiquity.\nTyrish was considered ancient many human generations before the 14 century DR. The legends of Tyrish talked about the Pharaoh possibly possessing divine powers. Ancient female slaves were said to pray to Tyrish during the full moon after giving birth to daughters. Legends claimed that if their prayers were heard, Tyrish sent them a magic stiletto, later known as Winged Blight. The knife was used to mutilate the womens daughters in order to save them from being perceived as valued by slavers, eventually leading to the girls freedom. With each child cut, Winged Blight grew slightly bigger.\nThe authenticity of these stories was unknown however, by the early 14 century DR, Winged Blight was to the size of a massive greatsword."
