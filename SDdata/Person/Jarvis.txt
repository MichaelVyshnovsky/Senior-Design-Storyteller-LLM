'''Jarvis''' was one of the [[Maces of Elversult]] that guarded over [[Moonstorm House]], the mansion-castle of the city's Lady Constable and Lady Lord.

{{Quote|There's no need for calling names. She was only trying to be considerate â€” and that's a rare thing for [[Vaerana Hawklyn]].|Jarvis to [[Ruha]], for calling Vaerana an "impatient she-[[camel]].}}

==Description==
He was a massive and intimidating man who spoke with distinct authority. He had brown eyes and dark, slicked-back hair.

==Relationships==
The dutiful guard directly served at the pleasure of Lady Constable [[Vaerana Hawklyn]].

==History==
Jarvis watched over the [[Harpers]] agent [[Ruha]] when she was given shelter in the Pearl Tower of Moonstorm house in the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, following a days-long, exhausting mission infiltrating the [[Ginger Palace]].
