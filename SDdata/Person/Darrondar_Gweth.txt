'''Darrondar Gweth''' was head priest of [[Tempus]] in [[Daggerford]] around [[1485 DR]].
 
==History==
Darrondar was a soldier in [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|Waterdeep's militia]] but retired after a skirmish in which most of his company was slaughtered.

Around 1485 DR, he was visited by Alwern (in truth, the disguised [[rakshasa]] [[Nadir]]). He convinced Darrondar to go to [[Dragonspear Castle]] to perform a ritual to strengthen the wards on the portal to the [[Nine Hells]]. However, when he arrived there, "Alwern" betrayed Darrondar to the [[vampire]]s of [[Voltan Szarlnaxi]]. This supposed betrayal broke Darrondar's spirit and he became the vampires' thrall.

After discovering the disappearance of Darrondar, Sir [[Isteval]] deduced most of the truth and hired an adventuring party to rescue the priest.

==Personality==
Darrondar was moved by survivor's guilt and was devoted to honoring the memory of his fallen friends. He had lost his spirit for battle.
