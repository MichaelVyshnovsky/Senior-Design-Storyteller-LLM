'''Cileroc''' was a privateer and an investor who lived in [[Imdolphyn]] in [[1479 DR]].

==Activities==
Cileroc was an investor who had spent much of his fortune in a number of dockside businesses in Imdolphyn. Thanks to his business acumen he became the favorite of Lord [[Othmeera Talask]] in 1479 DR, and was about to be promoted to the rank of "Imdarm-Lord".

Unknown to most people, however, was the fact that he was one of the members of the dreadful [[Cult of Reborn Flame]].

==History==
Cileroc began its career as a privateer of Lord Othmeera, some years before 1479 DR. He made a good fortune and rose in Imdarm society thanks to his service to the lord of the city.

In [[1480 DR]], he may have been killed by a band of adventurers who discovered his ties with the Cult of Reborn Flame.
