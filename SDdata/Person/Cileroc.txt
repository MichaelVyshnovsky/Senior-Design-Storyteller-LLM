Cileroc was a privateer and an investor who lived in Imdolphyn in 1479 DR.
Cileroc was an investor who had spent much of his fortune in a number of dockside businesses in Imdolphyn. Thanks to his business acumen he became the favorite of Lord Othmeera Talask in 1479 DR, and was about to be promoted to the rank of "Imdarm-Lord".
Unknown to most people, however, was the fact that he was one of the members of the dreadful Cult of Reborn Flame.
Cileroc began its career as a privateer of Lord Othmeera, some years before 1479 DR. He made a good fortune and rose in Imdarm society thanks to his service to the lord of the city.
In 1480 DR, he may have been killed by a band of adventurers who discovered his ties with the Cult of Reborn Flame.
