        "mainbody": "High Moonmistress '''Jolara Nightnever''' was a [[Church of Sel没ne|Sel没nite]] priest and the leader of [[Moonshadow Hall]] in [[Yhaunn]] during the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|757}}, during her time at Moonshadow Hall, Jolara was informed of the charges laid against the [[New Moon Pact]] by High Moonmistress [[Brima Chintamn]] of [[Bright Lady's Tower]] in nearby [[Chancelgaunt]]. Believing that the Pact had indeed fallen to the heresy of believing [[Shar]] and [[Sel没ne]] the same being, she supported the charges and condoned the extermination of the Pact.\n\nUnknown to Jolara, the priestess [[Asha the Silent]] who arrived later that year was in fact the wolf Halftail, transformed into a human by Sel没ne in order to protect the legacy of the Pact, and who eventually succeeded Jolara as High Moonmistress."
