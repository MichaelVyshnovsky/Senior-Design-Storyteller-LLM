'''Kadar al Ilmater''' was a [[Calishite]] [[human]] [[monk]] of [[Ilmater]], a member of the [[Order of St. Uzurr]], the Abbot of the [[Cloister of St. Uzurr]], and leader of the city of [[Uzurr]] in [[Lapaliiya]] ''circa'' [[1373 DR]].

==History==
Sometime ''circa'' [[1370 DR]], Kadar learned of the cruel process by which [[yuan-ti]] transformed humans into [[tainted one]]s and [[broodguard]]s. Seeing a terrible suffering, he focused on finding a means to undo the process and restore victims to full humanity. Though still unsuccessful, a spy for the yuan-ti [[House Eselemas]] operating within his Order reported that he was nearing a solution.

In response, [[yuan-ti pureblood]]s began infiltrating Uzurr on [[Eleasis 1|Eleasias 1]], the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], with the aim of assassinating Kadar.<ref name=tGHotR-p153>
