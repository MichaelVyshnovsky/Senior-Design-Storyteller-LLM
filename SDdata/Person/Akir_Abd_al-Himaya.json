This responsibility actually rotated between the various mamluk societies on a monthly basis, but the Defenders were responsible when the other groups were absent from the city.\n\nAkir Abd al-Himaya did not hold much power on the [[Mamluk Council]], so he often traded favors in exchange for support for his personal goals regarding the Defenders."
