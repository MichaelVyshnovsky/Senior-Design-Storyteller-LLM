        "mainbody": "Akir Abd al-Himaya was the commander of the Defenders Mamluk Society in Qudra in 1367 DR.\nAkir and his Defenders were responsible for the security and defense of Qudra. This responsibility actually rotated between the various mamluk societies on a monthly basis, but the Defenders were responsible when the other groups were absent from the city.\nAkir Abd al-Himaya did not hold much power on the Mamluk Council, so he often traded favors in exchange for support for his personal goals regarding the Defenders."
