        "mainbody": "'''Treth Halonter''' was a [[blueflame ghost]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], once an adventurer among [[the Nine]], in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He had been bound to the ''[[Wyverntongue Chalice]]''.",
        "Personality": "He was a little less talkative than Relve Langral.",
        "Possessions": "He carried a sword, even as a ghost.",
        "Description": "He was taller than [[Relve Langral]]; while a blueflame ghost, he smiled constantly.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|307-308|29}}",
        "Relationships": "While human, Treth Halonter had been one of [[the Nine]], a band of adventurers led by [[Laeral Silverhand]]. As a blueflame ghost, he was controlled by [[Marlin Stormserpent]], and then by [[Cymmarra]], a sorceress.",
        "Abilities": "When a blueflame ghost, Treth Halonter could walk through walls, and drain away the life force of the living. He could not, however, be made to attack another blueflame ghost.",
        "History": "Treth Halonter was a warrior among the Nine.{{cite book/The Savage Frontier|52}} [[Tharnadar]] of [[Dragonrock]], all but stating that Treth had died prior to that moment in time.{{cite book/The Seven Sisters|32}} The object in which he'd been bound, the ''Wyverntongue Chalice'', had also almost certainly become his prison prior to its being presented to [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]] in life, and thus, would have been such prior to {{yearlink|1390}}.\n\nWhile a blueflame ghost, Treth Halonter claimed to have been a warrior among the Nine, reduced to madness before death by the evil [[Myrkul]] and then transformed into a [[blueflame ghost]] upon it. He had been called forth at some point prior to 1479 DR. This calling could only have happened prior to 1437 DR as well, as the item containing him, the ''[[Wyverntongue Chalice]]'', had been largely unreachable for anyone but Marlin Stormserpent at least that long.\n\nAfter testing the command to return to the item to his satisfaction in the [[Dragonskull Chamber]] of [[Castle Obarskyr]], Marlin commanded him and fellow blueflame ghost Relve Langral go find and kill [[Seszgar Huntcrown]] in [[Suzail]]. In executing the command, the two went on a rampage. Every time they met someone on the streets, Relve asked if they'd seen Seszgar Huntcrown, with Treth adding immediately if they'd seen him recently. The duo killed anyone who didn't know where he was. Their rampage ended when they came across [[Belgryn Murenstur]]; they intimidated the man into leading them to [[the Bold Archer]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|228-230|21}}\n\nAfter slaying the Huntcrown heir, the two took his corpse to Marlin Stormserpent at [[Stormserpent Towers]]; he called on them to throw it in the furnace.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|245-247|23}} They were called on afterwards to kill [[Jharakphred]], an artist for hire, after the later painted for Marlin the likenesses of [[Draskos Crownsilver]] and [[Gariskar Dauntinghorn]], who were to be the ghosts' next target.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|259-260|25}} Later, frightened out of his wits about the death of his trusty servant, [[Gaskur]], Marlin used the ghosts to watch over him in his sleep.\n\nOn the evening after the disastrous [[Council of the Dragon]], Treth Halonter and Relve Langral were sent into the palace as part of another plan, this time hatched by Marlin Stormserpent and [[Traevyn Illance]] both, in which Marlin would make himself out to be the one who stopped those ghosts.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|141-142|15}} Along the way, however, they were spotted by one of the [[Lords of Waterdeep]], [[Mirt]], by the understeward [[Corleth Fentable]], by the evil [[archmage]] [[vampire]] [[Manshoon]], who was riding on Corleth Fentable's mind at the moment,{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|159|17}} and finally by the renegade wizard [[Elminster Aumar]]. The ghosts were attacked before reaching the palace.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|160-161|17}}\n\nRelve Langral was almost destroyed by one of Elminster's spells;{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|166|18}} returning to Marlin Stormserpent, who allowed the two ghosts to rest, on Halonter's advice; the ghost was quite distressed about the injuries they'd received.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|188-190|20}} His next use of the ghosts was to try and capture him some breakfast in the wilderness after he fled Suzail; unfortunately for him, the only creature they were able to kill was a [[bear]], as everything else fled the unnatural entities.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|239|25}}\n\nThe Wyverntongue Chalice was seized by [[Cymmarra]] after she slew Marlin Stormserpent; she was building her own collection of those ghosts,{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|266|28}} which she mobilized towards the [[Bold Blazon]] at the [[Festival of Handras]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|321|34}} She later pursued Elminster into a secret cave after he retrieved the belt buckle of Lord [[Calantar (Lord)]], secretly a ''blueflame item'', wielding her retinue of ghosts against him there. She stopped using the blueflame items after [[The Simbul]], restored by the belt buckle, slew her.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|329-335|35}}"
