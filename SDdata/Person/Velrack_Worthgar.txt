sea captain
Velrack Worthgar, also known as the Roaring Giant, was a wealthy investor and retired sea captain from Athkatla as of the late 14 century DR.
By the late 14 century DR, Velrack Worthgar was long retired and was profiting from an active investing business. He financed privateering ships that targeted vessels on behalf of those who had coin and could afford the illicit activity. His sizable mansion stood in one of the most affluent districts of Athkatla â€“ the westerly part of the Gem District on the Four Fountains Lane, across the street from the Hallowturrets House.
