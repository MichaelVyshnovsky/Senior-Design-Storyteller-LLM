        "mainbody": "'''Talarenne''' was a young but seasoned human [[fighter]], mercenary, and a long-time friend and companion of the [[Hero of Daggerford]].",
        "Description": "Talarenne was a tall athletic woman with long flowing dark brown hair who often had a mischievous smile on her face.",
        "Personality": "Tala was a lively person who kept her spirits up, despite trouble and bad weather. She was alway ready for a fight.",
        "Possessions": "Talarenne always kept her trusty [[longsword]] called ''[[Kalias]]'' at her side.",
        "History": "Talarenne and the hero of Daggerford knew each other for many years before the faithful events of 1372 DR. They worked and adventured together, saving each other's lives countless times. One notable adventure of the couple was battling the great [[Two-Headed Wyvern of Stamislot]] under the cover of the nights in the pouring rain. Tala saved the hero's life by pulling their neck away from the hungry [[wyvern]]'s maw all while the other head of the monster bit Tala's own backside.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], Falias Emberthumb hired Talarenne and her friend and companion to accompany his caravan from [[Waterdeep]] to [[Daggerford]]. As they traveled along the [[Trade Way]], not far from Daggerford, a group of bandits (in reality, [[Zhentarim]] agents) ambushed the merchant's caravan. As soon as the fighting started, Tala was absorbed by a bright magical light and was spirited away, leaving her friend fending for their life against disguised Zenths.\n\nTalarenne was an accidental capture as she looked fairly similar to one of the caravan's passenger, [[Astriel Shalyn]], an agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]] heading to Daggerford to investigate recent upheavals. The Zhentarim agents were tasked with using the ''scroll'' of ''[[binding]]'' that magically reduced her in size and trapped inside an enchanted orb known as a ''[[binding prison]]''."
