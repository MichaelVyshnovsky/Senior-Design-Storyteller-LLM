        "mainbody": "alarenne was a young but seasoned human fighter, mercenary, and a long-time friend and companion of the Hero of Daggerford.\nTalarenne was a tall athletic woman with long flowing dark brown hair who often had a mischievous smile on her face.\nTala was a lively person who kept her spirits up, despite trouble and bad weather. She was alway ready for a fight.\nTalarenne always kept her trusty longsword called Kalias at her side.\nTalarenne and the hero of Daggerford knew each other for many years before the faithful events of 1372 DR. They worked and adventured together, saving each others lives countless times. One notable adventure of the couple was battling the great Two-Headed Wyvern of Stamislot under the cover of the nights in the pouring rain. Tala saved the heros life by pulling their neck away from the hungry wyverns maw all while the other head of the monster bit Talas own backside.\nIn 1372 DR, Falias Emberthumb hired Talarenne and her friend and companion to accompany his caravan from Waterdeep to Daggerford. As they traveled along the Trade Way, not far from Daggerford, a group of bandits (in reality, Zhentarim agents) ambushed the merchants caravan. As soon as the fighting started, Tala was absorbed by a bright magical light and was spirited away, leaving her friend fending for their life against disguised Zenths.\nTalarenne was an accidental capture as she looked fairly similar to one of the caravans passenger, Astriel Shalyn, an agent of the Lords Alliance heading to Daggerford to investigate recent upheavals. The Zhentarim agents were tasked with using the scroll of binding that magically reduced her in size and trapped inside an enchanted orb known as a binding prison."
