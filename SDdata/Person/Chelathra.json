        "Abilities": "Tyvbolt Arsurath confirmed that she had no ability for magic. However, in response, he decided to instead alter her body, embedding wands in her arms, and make her capable of spitting slaying spells by grafting ever more magic items in her.",
        "History": "She was gifted to Tyvbolt Arsurath during his tenure as the [[Magister]], sometime between {{yearlink|537}} and {{yearlink|544}}. He became obsessed with making her his assistant; she lacked talent for magic, though, and rather than give up, he decided to experiment on her with spells, grafting wands and other magic items on her body. He also used magic to heighten her beauty.\n\nShe turned her arsenal on him in {{yearlink|544}}, when [[Annath Sunfall]] attacked Tyvbolt in the aftermath of the Magister's attack on two red dragons. Weakened from the battle, the Magister called on her to slay the challenger, but she attacked him instead. Tyvbolt destroyed her."
