        "mainbody": "Othovir was a shopkeeper in Triboar sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.\nOthovir was a handsome and charismatic male human of Illuskan stock.\nOthovir cared greatly about his good name. He became angry if he found out someone was looking into his private life or his past.\nHe was a skilled leatherworker and made his living making harnesses for horses and other domesticated beasts. He was a natural spellcaster, able to cast a few sorcerer spells. He was also proficient with a rapier.\nHe was the owner and proprietor of Othovirs Harness Shop in Triboar.\nOthovir created tack and harnesses out of elk hide that were works of art. His skill was unsurpassed in the Dessarin Valley and his designs prized among the nobles of Waterdeep who kept horses. He hunted and skinned the elk himself, selling the meat and other parts to the Lionshield Coster outpost in town.\nOthovir was a member of the noble Margaster family in Waterdeep but moved to Triboar and dropped his surname when some of his family tried to convert him to worship Asmodeus in secret. Because of his abhorrence for the corruption spreading through his family, he never spoke about his past, his nobility, or his family ties."
