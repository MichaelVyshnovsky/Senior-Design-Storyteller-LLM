        "History": {
            "Meeting Arklem Greeth": "Nyphithys first visited Arklem Greeth in [[1371 DR]], after the [[Archmage Arcane]] had fled the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] and hid in [[Mirabar]] following an attempt on his life. It was while the Archmage was wounded and contemplating his fate that she played to her strengths, using Arklem's frailty of body and spirit to seduce him with her charms. By the time he revealed to her his desire for lichdom, he was already willing to be her partner. Helping him to gather the necessary ingredients and knowledge, she guided his transformation into a lich.\n\nTogether, they returned to [[Luskan]] to kill those who had assaulted the Archmage and, with the help of Nyphithys' devilish allies, purged the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] of all those Arklem did not consider loyal. Once the dust had settled and the rebuilding process was underway, Arklem honored the bargain with Nyphithys and agreed to redirect the Brotherhood's focus towards the newly established [[Silver Marches]].",
            "Maugrim's takeover": "In [[1372 DR]], [[Maugrim]] took control of the Host Tower, spreading his influence and gaining a large faction of followers. He only needed to cement his position by removing the current Archmage Arcane, Arklem Greeth, trapping him and severing most of his magic. He began removing all who did not follow him, leading to a power struggle within the tower. Maugrim had Nyphithys trapped in a similar way, as she was the only one who had the ability to free Arklem and also because killing her would only return her to her home plane, from which she could return and interfere in Maugrim's plans. When she encountered the [[Hero of Neverwinter]] in her prison in the Host Tower, she asked them to free her from her magical binding so that she could assist Arklem to retake the tower from Maugrim.<ref>",
            "Many-Arrows negotiations": "Around [[1376 DR]], she was sent as an emissary to the Kingdom of [[Many-Arrows]]. Escorted by two other erinyes and several [[bearded devil]]s, she met with King [[Obould]] in secret. However, unknown to Nyphithys, Obould had sent word to King [[Bruenor]] that the Hosttower of the Arcane had sent emissaries to him, and had set an ambush consisting of his own troops as well as those of King Bruenor, including [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], [[Catti-brie]], and [[Thibbledorf Pwent]].\n\nNyphithys conducted negotiations with Obould and [[Regis]] over the terms of an alliance, offering the backing of the Hosttower of the Arcane so Obould could expand against the Silver Marches, as well as using her physical charms to attempt to seduce the Orc King. Obould pretended to go along with it briefly, before accusing Nyphithys' offer of being an attempt to enslave the [[orc]]s to be used as fodder for the [[mage]]s. The devil was taken aback by the accusation, and Obould ordered the attack.\n\nNyphithys and her erinyes companions took to the sky; she ordered them to bind Obould, but she was shot down by Catti-brie's bow, ''[[Taulmaril]]''. Forced to the ground, she engaged and was defeated by Drizzt in single combat before being killed by Obould, who had managed to free himself and slice her in half with a single stroke of his [[greatsword]], banishing her to the [[Nine Hells]] for a century.\n\nBruenor complained to Obould that she would have made a good prisoner, but Obould retorted that she made a better trophy. Arklem Greeth was indeed saddened by the loss of his favored servant, but given his heartless nature, it is likely Obould was correct."
