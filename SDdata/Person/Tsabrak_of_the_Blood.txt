Tsabrak of the Blood was the head of the College of Necromancy and one of the members of the Conclave of Sshamath in the city of Sshamath in the year 1372 DR.
In 1377 DR, Qarlynd Melarn told the priestess of Eilistraee Miverra that everyone knew that Master Tsabrak was a vampire.
In 1379 DR Tsabrak acted as moderator of a debate between the College of Ancient Arcana and the College of Baeqeshel Magic to decide which would be elevated as the new official eleven college of the city.
Later Tsabrak unfroze Qarlynd Melarn, permitting him to speak in front of the Conclave, despite this being a breech of protocol.
