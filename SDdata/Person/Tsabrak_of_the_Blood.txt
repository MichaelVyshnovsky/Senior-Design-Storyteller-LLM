}}'''Tsabrak of the Blood''' was the head of the [[College of Necromancy]] and one of the members of the [[Conclave of Sshamath]] in the city of [[Sshamath]] in the year [[1372 DR]].

==History==
In [[1377 DR]], [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] told the priestess of [[Eilistraee]] [[Miverra]] that everyone knew that Master Tsabrak was a [[vampire]].

In [[1379 DR]] Tsabrak acted as moderator of a debate between the [[College of Ancient Arcana]] and the [[College of Bae'qeshel Magic]] to decide which would be elevated as the new official eleven college of the city.
Later Tsabrak unfroze [[Q'arlynd Melarn]], permitting him to speak in front of the Conclave, despite this being a breech of protocol.
