        "mainbody": "'''Adimarchus''', called '''the Demon Prince of Madness''', was a [[demon lord]] and the former ruler of the abyssal layer of [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 507: Occipitus|Occipitus]].",
        "Description": "Adimarchus had two forms, and could shift between them at will. The first one was reminiscent of his past self as a [[planetar]]: a beautiful androgynous angel with pale purple skin, a pair of metallic golden wings, and black eyes. While similar in stature, his second form had ash-black skin and white eyes, and the wings were replaced by four shadowy tentacles ending in lamprey's maws. In both forms, Adimarchus' right eye burned with a smoking flame, a sign bestowed on any creature destined to rule Occipitus.",
        "Powers": "As the ruler of Occipitus, Adimarchus could draw tremendous evil power from the fabric of the layer itself. He could remake the landscape with a wave of his hand, and could control [[magic]] use across the layer. He had the power to create powerful [[mummy]] lords{{Cite dungeon/107/Test of the Smoking Eye|62}} and to summon other [[tanar'ri]] and he had access to various spell-like abilities.\n\nAs the Demon Prince of Madness, Adimarchus had the power to plant fragments of his consciousness into the minds of distant creatures, even on different planes.\n\n[[File:Adimarchus angelic form.png|thumb|left|150px|''The angelic form of Adimarchus.'']]",
        "History": "Adimarchus was a fallen planetar who once led a demonic army with the goal to invade [[Celestia]]. During that battle and in order to contain the invasion, the angels detached a portion of the plane and cast it into the [[Abyss]], where it merged with the existing layer of Occipitus.\n\nAdimarchus survived the battle, and became the ruler of the layer by incorporating the wreckage of Celestia into Occipitus, becoming a demon lord in the process. As a demon lord he often waged war against his most powerful rival, the demon lord [[Graz'zt]].\n\nDuring his reign, Adimarchus created the Test of the Smoking Eye, a difficult challenge that would be used to find a suitable successor should anything happen to him.\n\nAfter several hundred years of rule, Adimarchus was betrayed by Athux, the son of Graz'zt, and disappeared from Occipitus.{{Template:Cite book/Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss|65}} He was imprisoned in [[Orthrys]], the first layer of [[Carceri]], where he was driven to madness.{{Cite dragon/360/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Graz'zt, the Dark Prince|13}} Some sages suggested that Adimarchus's deposition, together with [[Waukeen]]'s imprisonment in [[Azzagrat]] in {{Yearlink|1370}} and his numerous other schemes, was a component of Graz'zt's plot to unify all demons of the Abyss.{{Template:Cite dragon/360/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Graz'zt, the Dark Prince|13-14}}{{Template:Cite book/For Duty & Deity|3}}"
