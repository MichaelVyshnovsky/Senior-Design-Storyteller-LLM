'''Ethra Dralas''' ({{Pronounce|ETH|ra|_|DRA|las}}) was a member of the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]], and held the position of [[Zulkir]] of [[Abjuration]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night|3}}

==Description==
As a member of the Red Wizards, Ethra dressed in crimson [[wizard]] [[robe]]s{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night|19}} and her skin was adorned with Thayan-style tattoos. 
==Personality==
Ethra was single-minded in pursuit of her goals.{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night|10}}{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night|20}}
==Abilities==
Ethra was a potent [[abjurer]], and was adept at casting many [[spells]] quickly. She bore special Thayan ''[[tattoos of absorption]]'' which allowed her to absorb the [[magic]] of spells cast at her. 

Prior to any potential combat, she would secure a number of safeguard spells for herself, including ''[[Death ward (spell)|death ward]], [[foresight]], [[freedom of movement]], [[mirror image]],'' and ''[[true seeing]]''. She also developed a contingency plan for particularly dangerous situations which involved instructing her [[simulacrum]] to ''[[polymorph]]'' her into a giant [[gorilla]] if the battle turned against her. This contingency also entailed Ethra casting ''[[tongues]]'' on herself prior to combat so that she could continue to use her spells while in the gorilla form.
==Possessions==
Ethra was known to make liberal use of [[potion]]s and [[scroll]]s. She wore a ''[[scarab of protection]]'' and carried a [[dagger]]. She also possessed an [[amulet]] which controlled a [[shield guardian]], although she gave this to her simulacrum.
==Relationships==
Ethra was a loyal servant of [[Szass Tam]], and in turn her underlings included the [[necromancer]] [[Sanir Lolka]], the [[Banite]] [[cleric]] [[Vend Ma'non]], and several [[Thayan knight]]s.

She was also frequently accompanied by a [[simulacrum]] which she had convinced her underlings was in fact a twin-sister named [[Hetra]].
==History==
Shortly following the events of the ''[[Death Curse]]'' in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Ethra was sent to [[Chult]] by [[Szass Tam]] to collect the residual energies of [[Acererak]]'s ''[[soulmonger]]'' and use it to release [[Dendar]], the [[primordial]] Night Serpent, from her prison beneath the [[Peaks of Flame]].{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night|5}} Tam had been fooled into believing that Dendar had visited him and his servants in their dreams, promising to fulfill her purpose to end all life on [[Toril]] and to leave the Red Wizards as rulers over an [[undead]] world if they freed her. In truth, this was a ruse devised by the [[lich]] [[Rhaugilath]], who sought to trick both the Thayans and a party of [[adventurer]]s into clashing over the ''soulmonger'''s power, ultimately to claim it for himself in order to break free of his servitude to the Shadow King [[Larloch]].{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night|6}}

Ethra arrived in Chult and collected several fragments of the ''soulmonger'', storing its power inside [[opal]] pendants. By the time she proceeded to the [[Maze of Ubtao]] to locate the [[Iron Doors]] that held Dendar imprisoned, she had collected several such pendants, but not as many as she would have liked. Nevertheless, she successfully penetrated the Maze and arrived at the Iron Doors, although along the way she suffered many casualties, including her cleric, Vend Ma'Non, and one of her knights, [[Oscillok]]. She then managed to begin opening the doors before Rhaugilath's adventurers confronted her.
