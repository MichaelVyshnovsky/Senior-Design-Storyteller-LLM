'''Harazos Thelbrimm''' was a [[human]] [[fighter]] and a [[Gauntlet (title)|Gauntlet]] of the city of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Serving alternatively as Gauntlet of the Eastern Marches''[[Gray Hunt]]'' has Harazos as Gauntlet of the Western Marches, despite all other adventures and materials in ''[[Legacy of the Green Regent]]'' establishing him as Gauntlet of the Eastern Marches. It may be that he began as western Gauntlet then switched to eastern, that this is a rotating position, or that he was filling in between [[Jaida Zerezeal]] and [[Isyan Kiy'sisnos]]. Harazos Thelbrimm was one of the joint commanders of the Loudwater militia. He served under the command of High Lord [[Nanathlor Greysword]] and later [[Kalahar Twohands]].

==History==
He held this position by [[1357 DR]], and remained in the role through the 1360s [[DR]]. He was a veteran of many battles against [[goblin]]s, [[giant]]s, the [[Zhent]] forces of [[Llorkh]], and more.

During the [[Night of the Blood Moon]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, both Gauntlets Harazos and Kalahar happened to be out of the city when [[Malar]]-worshiping [[lycanthrope]]s assaulted Loudwater for two nights straight. Harazos and Kalahar returned in time for the third night and organized the defense of the city.{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/A Fellowship Rises}} Shortly after, Nanathlor Greysword passed away and while Kalahar became the High Lord of Loudwater, Harazos remained as Gauntlet.

==Personality==
Harazos was a battle-hardened old soldier, with a stern and grizzled manner, no-nonsense approach, and commanding authority. He did not like the so-called savage [[humanoid]]s like goblins, whom he regarded as pests.

==Description==
He was bald but bearded. He had a noticeable jagged scar running the right corner of his mouth and down his neck; he grew the beard to conceal it, but wasn't successful.

==Rumors & Legends==
Accounts varied on where Harazos got his distinctive facial scar; some said it was inflicted by a champion of the Zhent-serving Mayor of [[Llorkh]], [[Geildarr Ithym]], while others claimed it was made by High Lord Kalahar Twohands himself.
