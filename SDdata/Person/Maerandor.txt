Maerandor was a shadovar special agent.
Helgore, Maerandor, and three other shadovar were trained personally by the High Prince Telamont Tanthul of Thultanthar under the orders of Shar to become the personal blades of the High Prince.
For a time, Maerandor was one of the shadovar agents who had the mission to steal spells and magic items from dragons lairs.
In 1487 DR, Telamont gave Helgore and Maerandor new missions. Maerandor would go to Candlekeep. Alongside all the shadovar spies who had infiltrated the monks, he fought against Moonstars and Red Wizard infiltrators, but in the end the shadovar all died.
