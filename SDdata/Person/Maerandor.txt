'''Maerandor''' was a [[shadovar]] special agent.

==Activities==
[[Helgore]], Maerandor, and three other shadovar were trained personally by the High Prince [[Telamont Tanthul]] of [[Thultanthar]] under the orders of [[Shar]] to become the personal blades of the High Prince.

==History==
For a time, Maerandor was one of the shadovar agents who had the mission to steal [[spell]]s and [[magic item]]s from [[dragon]]s' lairs.

In [[1487 DR]], Telamont gave Helgore and Maerandor new missions. Maerandor would go to [[Candlekeep]]. Alongside all the shadovar spies who had infiltrated the monks, he fought against [[Moonstars]] and [[Red Wizard]] infiltrators, but in the end the shadovar all died.
