        "mainbody": "'''Ssibalentanamas''' was the priest in charge of the [[yuan-ti]] breeding program that took place in the catacombs beneath the [[Cathedral of Emerald Scales]] in the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. He was also the First Consort of the ruler of [[Hlondeth]], [[Dediana Extaminos]].",
        "Activities": "As the First Keeper of the Sacred Eggs, Ssibalentanamas controlled the [[Yuan-ti#Sub-breeds|histachii]] that guarded and tended the hundreds of yuan-ti eggs that were incubated in brood chambers deep below the Cathedral of Emerald Scales. Ostensibly, he was breeding an army to defend Hlondeth, but only he and the high priestess [[Medusanna Mhairdaul]] knew the full extent of the program.\n\nAs the First Consort, he attended Dediana Extaminos, but he was not the father of [[Dmetrio Extaminos]].",
        "Relationships": "Ssibalentanamas was in a unique position, being the ally of Medusanna and the consort of Dediana, since the two females detested each other and came close to trading blows on at least a few occasions.",
