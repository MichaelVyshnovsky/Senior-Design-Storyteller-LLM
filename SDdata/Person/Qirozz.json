        "mainbody": "'''Qirozz''' ({{Pronounce|kir|ROZ|refs={{Cite adventurers league/Consequences of Choice|15}}}} was an [[archdevil]] duke of the [[Nine Hells]] who served the Lord of the First, [[Zariel]].{{Cite adventurers league/Consequences of Choice|29}}<ref group=\"note\">The title \"Archduchess\" is used to describe her despite this usually being reserved for the [[Lords of the Nine]].",
        "Description": "Qirozz had purple skin and large horns.{{Cite adventurers league/The Breath of Life|17}}",
        "Personality": "Qirozz was an ever-vain devil who enjoyed finding and exploiting the weaknesses of her foes, and was particularly fond of baiting and toying with paladins by testing their faith and competence. She liked entertainment and when hosting her balls sought both to enjoy herself and ensure her guests did as well. She was known to make bold challenges to those whose presence she enjoyed, inviting them to activities of their choosing, often exerting herself in the process of strenuous ones and needing to take quick rests as a result.\n\nAll that in mind, Qirozz was still possessed of a respect for proper form and etiquette and was fully capable of being politically minded in her plans and demeanor. She was too good a tactician to allow things like boredom to undermine her strategies.",
        "Possessions": "Qirozz wore jewelry on each finger and a ceremonial [[breastplate]] inlaid with carved bone.\n\nQirozz's most prized possession was her [[Fetid Chalice]], an item of exquisite and terrible beauty fashioned from the skull of a [[celestial]]. The canine cranium was bedecked with [[gem]]s, gilded with [[arcane]] symbols, and inlaid with [[gold]]. She was proud of the item and would gladly brag about how she obtained it.",
        "Realm": "Qirozz's estate was a citadel in the midst of a vast, cratered plain, a tower-like fortress carved out of a [[basalt]] formation and protected by a {{SIAdj|20|ft|long=yes|adj=tall}} wall.{{Cite adventurers league/The Breath of Life|6}}{{Cite adventurers league/Consequences of Choice|28}} Several members of her large army of devils defended the stronghold.",
        "Activities": "Every six hundred and sixty-six days, Qirozz hosted a ball to show off her chalice.{{Cite adventurers league/The Breath of Life|8}}",
        "Relationships": "Qirozz was known to ride into battle on the back of an [[Dragon aging|ancient]] [[red dragon]].{{Cite adventurers league/Consequences of Choice|13}}\n\nQirozz enjoyed the presence of [[Zaralais]] the [[androsphinx]] at her balls, for reasons beyond him. For his part, he only came because he was afraid of her and was extorted into attending.{{Cite adventurers league/The Breath of Life|19}}",
        "History": "Qirozz predated Zariel's rise to power in Avernus and managed to keep her position as a tactician even after she took over the layer.{{Cite adventurers league/Consequences of Choice|27}}\n\nEons ago, Qirozz was locked in combat with [[adventurer]]s who summoned to their aid the [[hound]]-headed [[angel]] [[Verwyr]]. In the end both the adventurers and the angel were slain, and Qirozz decided to strip the flesh from the celestial and fashion its skull into the Fetid Chalice.{{Cite adventurers league/The Breath of Life|2}}\n\nSomewhere around the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] the Fetid Chalice became unusable for Qirozz, for any liquid poured into it became [[holy water]]. Unbeknownst to Qirozz, fragments of Verwyr lingered on within the goblet, and she was responding to a supernatural \"call from on high\" for aid. The duchess persisted with her parties despite the chalice's condition,{{Cite adventurers league/The Swarmed Heart|4}} Using her [[divine]] powers, Dara returned the long-dead angel to life with a kiss on the forehead.{{Cite adventurers league/The Breath of Life|9}}\n\nWhen she learned of the theft of the chalice, she destroyed all the furniture of one of her rooms in a rage, eventually calming down while remaining highly annoyed by the robbery and worried about the hit to her prestige. As such, she sought a new prize or noteworthy deed to complete to restore her damaged reputation."
