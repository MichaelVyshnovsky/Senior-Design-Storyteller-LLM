        "History": "When [[Rorskryn Mreldrake]] fled Castle Obarskyr through a ''portal'' to the [[King's Tower]] in [[Marsember]], transformed into a woman, he was spotted at the portal by the [[War Wizard]] [[Ellard Gauntur]], who'd been deployed to capture him. Ellard figured out that was Mreldrake transformed from a stain on his clothes, and pursued.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|51-52|6}} Two sentries were deployed by the [[War Wizard]] [[Ellard Gauntur]] on the Marsember side of the portal: Berent Thallowwood and [[Mandron Saldar]], so that Rorskryn could not return easily.\n\nWhile the two sentries speculated, the [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]] sent after them the [[death knight]] [[Targrael]]; she quickly slew Berent without him even noticing."
