Lady Alvilda Margaster was a member of House Margaster in the late 15 century DR.
Alvilda was the cousin of Lady Inkeri Margaster.
In the , the halfling rogue Regis met Alvilda and Lady Inkeri Margaster at the Driftwood Tavern near Neverwinter. The Margasters held a party there and during the dances Regis gained from his dance partner Alvilda some useful information about Inkeris plots.
Later that year, Alvilda gave birth to a baby girl named Sharon, who appeared somehow corrupted, perhaps as a result of the familys trade in demonic phylacteries, Their conflict came to a head when Alvilda and Inkeri managed to capture Regis and Dahlia Sinfelle, who had infiltrated the Margaster estate in Waterdeep. Instigated by Sharon, the two cousins fully transformed into demons and fought each other, until Alvilda beheaded Inkeri.
