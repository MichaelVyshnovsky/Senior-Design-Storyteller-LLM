Windharrow was a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Howling Hatred at the Temple of Howling Hatred in Tyar-Besil during the Elemental Evil crisis.
He was at heart an opportunist. Windharrow was loyal to Aerisi Kalinoth as long as he feared her power. However, confronted with danger to his life or a richer offer, he would betray the air cult without a backward glance.
In battle, Windharrow wielded a rapier and wore studded leather.
Born as Harald Grayspear, he was a rake and a bandit until he met Aerisi Kalinoth when she was still with her family. Harald charmed and flattered his way into her favor. When Aerisi joined the Cult of the Howling Hatred, Harald, now renamed by his lady as Windharrow, loyally followed. Aerisi instructed him to gather a band of flutists from the ranks of new converts to the air cult, the Windwyrds.
In 1491 DR, Windharrow was with his flutist minions at the Temple of Howling Hatred in Tyar-Besil until he was confronted by some adventurers.
