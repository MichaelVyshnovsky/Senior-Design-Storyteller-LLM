Vur'din led a group of summoner ritualists at the outpost in service to Mistress [[Laerion'vyr]], a high priestess of [[Lolth]]. Unusually for [[Lolthite]] drow they summoned a number of [[slaad]]i as minions, including [[red slaad|red]], [[green slaad|green]], and [[blue slaad|blue]] varieties, and the powerful [[gray slaad]] [[Il'tharis the Terrible]], which he kept enslaved with a control gem.
