'''Othimturac''' was a [[shadow dragon|shadow]] [[white dragon]] bred by the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] of [[Karsoluthiyl]].

==History==
As part of an experiment, the Jaezred Chaulssin of Karsoluthiyl crossbred various kinds of [[chromatic dragon]]s with [[shadow dragon]]s in order to create a more suitable race. However, only Othimturac, the white dragon offspring, survived (the Jaezred speculated that it was his immunity to cold that permitted his survival). He was later used as a guard for the tower of [[House Oussgym]], the local Jaezred headquarters. In [[1374 DR]], he was eventually defeated by an adventuring party that had infiltrated the tower.
