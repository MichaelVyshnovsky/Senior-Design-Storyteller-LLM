        "History": "In the spring of the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, Fleebo was a member of a band of robbers who happened to stop an extended family of foresters from [[Forest of Tethir|Tethir]] led by a man named [[Wyancott]]. While the leader of the bandits questioned Wyancott, [[Star Protective Services]] arrived to rescue them. When he stood atop a wagon and aimed his weapon at [[Zaranda Star]], Fleebo was shot dead by an [[arrow]] through his forehead from [[Vander Stillhawk]]. Zaranda then used his dead body in a failed attempt to teach her ward [[Chenowyn]] about death."
