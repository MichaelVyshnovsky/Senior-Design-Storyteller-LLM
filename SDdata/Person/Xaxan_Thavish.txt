Xaxan Thavish was a member of the Cult of the Eternal Flame in Mulmaster.
The priest was a vain and fastidious sociopath. He tried to keep himself always immaculately clean. While Xaxan presented a friendly facade, he was full of envy and resentment. He greatly disliked water cultists. He was a notorious womanizer.
Xaxan was a cleric affiliated with the Cult of the Eternal Flame. He had a sexual relationship with the wife of his superior until the latter found out.
The cultist wielded a quarterstaff in battle.
In 1491 DR, after being discovered having sex with his superiors wife, Xaxans superior offered him two options&mdashbecome a flameskull or join an expedition into the sewers of Mulmaster sponsored by the Cult of the Crushing Wave. Xaxan chose the latter and was sent to find the tomb of an ancient kuo-toa mystic devoted to Olhydra and Bwimb. However, a band of troglodytes attacked their camp, killing the leader of expedition, a warrior named Vyrlo Trath, and this left Xaxan as the highest-ranking member present.
At last, an adventuring party hired to investigate the body of a flumph, which Xaxan had earlier killed, found and confronted him.
