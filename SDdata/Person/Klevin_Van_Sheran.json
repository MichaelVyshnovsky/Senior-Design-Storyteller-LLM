        "mainbody": "evin was a young [[human]] man from [[Tethyr]], but since moving to Chult, he had adopted the manner of a native [[Chultan]]. He had tanned skin, green eyes, and dark hair (which he dyed black).{{Cite adventurers league/In Search of Secrets|4}}",
        "Description": "Klevin was a young [[human]] man from [[Tethyr]], but since moving to Chult, he had adopted the manner of a native [[Chultan]]. He had tanned skin, green eyes, and dark hair (which he dyed black).{{Cite adventurers league/In Search of Secrets|4}}",
        "Personality": "Klevin loved and was fascinated by Chultan culture, and went to lengths to immerse himself in the traditions and styles of his new home. He was eager to share his knowledge of Port Nyanzaru and worked to protect it when he could. However, he was also deeply selfish and put his own interests before the goals of the Lords' Alliance. He was polite, but could be surprisingly nasty to those who did not respect his requests.\n\nHe preferred to converse in the [[Chultan language]] whenever possible, if for no other reason than to demonstrate that he knew how to speak it (almost) perfectly.",
        "Activities": "Klevin was the owner and trader at the [[Weave of Life]], a large and thriving shop in the western end of the [[Grand Souk]] in the [[Market Ward]] of Port Nyanzaru.{{Cite adventurers league/Over the Edge|6}} His shop sold many Chultan clothes and other wares. Klevin penned pamphlets detailing the local culture of Port Nyanzaru, which he also sold.\n\nIn his capacity as a Lords' Alliance representative, he had a web of contacts around the city{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|9}} and he asked that other Lords' Alliance agents report to him. He kept tabs on all ships coming and going from the city as well as on potential threats to Port Nyanzaru, even tracking of the movements of [[yuan-ti]] tribes as far afield as the [[Peaks of Flame]] and [[Sky Lizard Mountains]].",
        "Relationships": "Klevin was not well respected by the people of Port Nyanzaru. However, his position allowed him to maintain a number of important connections in the city, including with local merchants, the [[Citizens' Brigade]], and the [[Zindar|harbormaster]]. His fellow Lords' Alliance agents included [[Arreni Goldbirth]].\n\nHe occasionally cooperated with representatives from other factions within Port Nyanzaru, such as when several of them elected to hire the mercenary [[Pozzanna Lordeaux]] to secure a stronghold within the Chultan jungle,{{Cite adventurers league/Over the Edge|4}} when they rallied behind [[Hawkdriver Mazugulak]] to drive back an [[undead]] attack on the city,{{Cite adventurers league/Rotting Roots|3}} or when they came together under [[Alastar Bol]] to send agents to investigate undead forces stemming from the ruined city of [[Matolo]].",
        "History": "Klevin was sent to Chult by the Lords' Alliance at the request of his father.{{Cite adventurers league/Putting the Dead to Rest|4}}\n\nDuring the events of the [[death curse]] around {{Yearlink|1490}},{{ToA-time}} Klevin sought help from adventurers to investigate a smuggling ring operating out of [[Tiryki Anchorage]], which was run by [[Sanuya]], who was given a piece of the ''[[Dreamer's Amulet]]'' by [[Nahurali]].\n\nAfter the death curse had ended and undead began assailing Port Nyanzaru, Klevin tasked his agents with finding anyone behind these attacks who could be brought to justice and&mdash;more importantly&mdash;be made to pay for the damage that had been caused.{{Cite adventurers league/Putting the Dead to Rest|5}} He also began to fear that [[yuan-ti]] had infiltrated his faction's ranks, and so sent an agent to the [[Tomb of Ihl]] to acquire the means to flush out the spies under the guise of investigating possible activity by cultists of [[Dendar]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Search of Secrets|17}}\n\nWhen the [[Maze of Ubtao]] was found, Klevin had the idea to order one of his agents to dispose of an indestructible [[magic]]al [[dagger]] inside that [[dungeon]] so as that it could not be found and used to incriminate an ally of the Lords' Alliance, who had used it in a crime of passion.{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night|3}}"
