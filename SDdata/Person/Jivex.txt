'''Jivex''' was a [[faerie dragon]] from the [[Gray Forest]] and a member of the mixed human and draconic group that defeated [[Sammaster]].

==Abilities==
Jivex was skilled in the arts of [[illusion]], preferring to deceive and trick his opponents rather than blast them into little bits and pieces.

==Appearance==
Like all faerie dragons, Jivex was extremely small by dragon standards, no more than the length of a man's arm from snout to tail. His scales had an iridescent hue.
