'''Oluubarga''' was a [[gelugon]] in [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1373 DR]].

==History==
Oluubarga was one of the many [[devil]]s who'd settled in Myth Drannor.

In 1373 DR, his master the [[pit fiend]] [[Aglaeroch]] ordered Oluubarga to lead a group of devils to the [[Abarat's Folly]] tower in order to gain control of the [[portal nexus]] inside and so spread their army over all [[Faer√ªn]].
