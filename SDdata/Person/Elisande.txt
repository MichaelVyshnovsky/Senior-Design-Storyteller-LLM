Elisande () was a young girl in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Elisande lived in a small village on an isle not too far from Phlan. She lived with her parents until they both died of illness. From that day on, Elisande waited for an opportunity to leave the village.
So when an adventuring party arrived in the village investigating rumors of dracoliches and ghost ships , she tried by all means to befriend them. 
She moved to Phlan until the coup of the Cult of the Dragon took the city. After she escaped from Phlan, Elisande found a place to stay at Mulmasters Underdark outpost of Fort Iron. Here she was possibly involved in another adventure that same year.
Elisande briefly attended a celebration for Mielikki in the village of Elventree circa 1486 DR.
Later, Elisande was inside a passage to the upperdark near the village of the Stop.
Later, in Sporedome, Elisande joined in the planning of the assault on Maerimydra.
At the Undying Temple, Elisande helped stop Grazzts ritual to resist Vizeran DeVirs spell and was revealed to be a Chosen of Cyric.
Elisande was always fascinated with the world outside the village. Unlike her fellow villagers, she hoped to someday leave. She acted cordially with outsiders, asking for all kinds of information about the world.
Elisande always traveled with a blind goat.
