'''Elisande''' ({{Pronounce|ELL|ih|sand}}{{Cite adventurers league/The Malady of Elventree|31}}) was a young girl in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|22}}
  
==History==
Elisande lived in a small village on an isle not too far from [[Phlan]]. She lived with her parents until they both died of illness. From that day on, Elisande waited for an opportunity to leave the village.

So when an adventuring party arrived in the village investigating rumors of [[dracolich]]es and [[ghost ship]]s , she tried by all means to befriend them.{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows over the Moonsea|15}} 

She moved to Phlan until the coup of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] took the city.{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|17}} After she escaped from Phlan, Elisande found a place to stay at [[Mulmaster]]'s [[Underdark]] outpost of [[Fort Iron]]. Here she was possibly involved in another adventure that same year.

Elisande briefly attended a celebration for [[Mielikki]] in the village of [[Elventree]] ''circa'' [[1486 DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Malady of Elventree|8}}

Later, Elisande was inside a passage to the [[upperdark]] near the village of [[the Stop]].{{Cite adventurers league/Quelling the Horde|10}}

Later, in [[Sporedome]], Elisande joined in the planning of the assault on [[Maerimydra]].{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|11}}

At the [[Undying Temple]], Elisande helped stop [[Graz'zt]]'s ritual to resist [[Vizeran DeVir]]'s [[spell]] and was revealed to be a [[Chosen]] of [[Cyric]].{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|46-47}}{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|70}}

==Personality==
Elisande was always fascinated with the world outside the village. Unlike her fellow villagers, she hoped to someday leave. She acted cordially with outsiders, asking for all kinds of information about the world.

==Relationship==
Elisande always traveled with [[Ausuriel|a blind goat]].
