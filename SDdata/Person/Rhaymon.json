Later, Rhaymon intended to fight against the armies of [[Bane]] in the [[second battle of Shadowdale]].\n\nAfter the battle, however, when all believed Elminster dead, Rhaymon came to believe that Adon and Midnight were the culprits and testified against them in the process.{{cite book/Tantras|19-21|1}}\n\nSome time later, Rhaymon died from an accident. Midnight met his spirit on the [[Fugue Plane]] and he gave some advice to her about [[Myrkul]]'s realm.{{cite book/Waterdeep|249-253|14}}"
