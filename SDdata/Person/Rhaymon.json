        "mainbody": "haymon was a human priest of Lathander in Shadowdale in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nDuring the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, he met the then-mortal Kelemvor, Midnight, Cyric, and the ex-cleric Adon when they arrived in the dale to seek advice from Elminster. Later, Rhaymon intended to fight against the armies of Bane in the second battle of Shadowdale.\nAfter the battle, however, when all believed Elminster dead, Rhaymon came to believe that Adon and Midnight were the culprits and testified against them in the process.\nSome time later, Rhaymon died from an accident. Midnight met his spirit on the Fugue Plane and he gave some advice to her about Myrkuls realm."
