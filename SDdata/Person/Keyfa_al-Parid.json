Because of her love of the sea, she wished to \"never be in danger from drowning.\" The dao granted the wish for Keyfa, but used to opportunity to cruelly twist the meaning of the wish so that she could never leave dry land. Since that day, Keyfa would magically teleport back to land if she strayed into the water or spent time on a ship that was not docked.\nKeyfa owned a magical scimitar and a telescope of true vision."
