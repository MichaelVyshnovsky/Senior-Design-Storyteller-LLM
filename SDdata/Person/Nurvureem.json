        "mainbody": "'''Nurvureem''', also known as the '''\"Dark Lady\"''', was a ''draa'zekyl'' [[shadow dragon]] with a fell reputation among the inhabitants of the [[Dessarin Valley|Dessarin River Valley]]. She maintained several different lairs, though she favored the ruined manor-house of [[Rundreth Manor]].{{Cite dragon/249/Wyrms of the North: Nurvureem}}",
        "Personality": "As of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]] took on the persona of enigmatic and beautiful [[drow]] woman, referred to by locals as \"the Dark Lady\".\n\nShe did not abide disruptive visitors and cared little for those who tried to ingratiate themselves as allies.",
        "Relationships": "Nurvureem had a predilection for young, handsome male [[human]]s. She enticed them to her by using [[illusion]]s to appear as a beautiful woman wearing very little in the way of clothing. Those who remained peaceful might be allowed to leave alive, often after falling in love with her. \n\nThough if she discovered that these so-called \"Faithful Few\" had spread her secrets (such as in the case of the [[bard]] [[Inder Braelen]], who wrote a ballad about her), those men quickly disappeared. Most men however, were eaten as not only did she enjoy the company of young human men, she also particularly enjoyed the taste of their meat.",
        "History": "Nurvureem was born in the {{YearlinkName|1241}} shortly after her mother was captured by the [[malaugrym]]. Nurvureem was the daughter of [[Mauzzkyl Jaezred]], the Patron Grandfather of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] but she was lost when the kidnappers were killed by Jaezred Chaulssin [[assassin]]s.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|3}}\n\nNurvureem was not noted in history again until the {{YearlinkName|1304}} when she was discovered roaming the lands southeast of [[Triboar]] between there and the borders of the [[High Forest]]. She slew at least three other [[dragon]]s and many more [[wyvern]]s before she was discovered by the Jaezred Chaulssin in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. The [[drow]] let her be, content to observe her until they detected a threat or the possibility of their history being exposed through her.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Nurvureem succumbed to the [[Rage of Dragons]], killing several [[Cult of the Dragon|dragon cultists]] who had come to try and transform her into a [[dracolich]] before destroying the village of [[Uluvin]]. After the Rage had passed, she aided Cult rebels in [[Yartar]] to drive out their leaders, [[Pox (lich)|Pox]] and [[Saurglyce]], before informing the local authorities of their presence a few months later.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, elemental cultists approached her to propose an alliance. She declined the offer and devoured most of them, letting a few live to report their failure. Though curious about the cults, she wanted simply to be left alone."
