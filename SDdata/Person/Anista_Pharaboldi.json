        "mainbody": "'''Anista Pharaboldi''' was the matriarch of the noble [[House Pharaboldi]] of [[Arrabar]] before her death in [[1373 DR]].",
        "Description": "The Pharaboldi matriarch had a haughty high-pitched voice.",
        "Personality": "Anista was a proud ruler of the Pharaboldi estate and its many grand vegetation-filled chambers, gardens, and a collection of noble [[steed]]s.",
        "Relationships": "Anista Pharaboldi had a husband and three children, [[Denrick Pharaboldi|Denrick]], the youngest of the three; [[Lobra Pharaboldi]], and the oldest son – [[Jerephin Pharaboldi]].\n\nAnista Pharaboldi represented her family within a sneak coin cabal of several powerful merchant families of Arrabar who attempted to claim power via money and profiteering from an orchestrated war. The organization included [[Grozier Talricci]] of [[House Talricci]], his family wizard [[Bartimus]], [[Dregaul Matrell]] of [[House Matrell]], as well as the corrupt Grand Trabbar [[Lavant]] of the [[Temple of Waukeen (Arrabar)|Temple of Waukeen]].",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, Anista Pharaboldi secured courtship between her boarish son Denrick Pharaboldi and a noble of the House Matrell, [[Emriana Matrell]], to the young woman's displeasure. Emriana was bound by tradition to pay social visits to the House Pharaboldi, accompanied by her mother and grandmother.\n\nAnista Pharaboldi's life was ended on [[Tarsakh 13]], [[1373 DR]], by her power-hungry son's [[dagger]] plunged into the matriarch's chest.\n\nAnista Pharaboldi's legacy became obvious during the joint funeral of the matriarch and her murderous son Denrick who met justice and payment by [[Beshaba]]'s ill luck, after falling off the balcony of the Matrell estate. The funeral took place on [[Tarsakh 16]] and among the attendees were the members of Anista's cabal. The conspirators convinced Lobra Pharaboldi, the estate's new head, that Vambran Matrell was the villain solely responsible for the House Pharaboldi's tragedy. Lobra tasked her husband – Falagh Mestel, to heal the revenge plot while the cabal's plans to instigate a war with [[Hlath]] and [[Reth]] continued their course."
