Hamida was a skilled saluk and dancing girl in the streets of Huzuz, the City of Delights, around 1367 DR.
Hamida dressed in elegant attire which served as a testament to her success as a performer. She often wore a yellow and black full-length gown of silk that rustled softly as she danced. She wore a tightly cinched purple belt around her waist to reveal her sultry curves. As was common with many street performers in the Cities of the Heart, Hamidas face was unveiled. She wore a headdress accented by exotic bird feathers from the Crowded Sea.
Hamida had a young assistant and follower named Haki.
