'''Hamida''' was a skilled [[sa'luk]] and dancing girl in the streets of [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, around [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Hamida dressed in elegant attire which served as a testament to her success as a performer. She often wore a yellow and black full-length [[gown]] of silk that rustled softly as she danced. She wore a tightly cinched purple belt around her waist to reveal her sultry curves. As was common with many street performers in the [[Cities of the Heart]], Hamida's face was unveiled. She wore a headdress accented by exotic bird feathers from the [[Crowded Sea]].

==Relationships==
Hamida had a young assistant and follower named [[Haki]].
