Brarindra Harbright was one of the proprietors of the newly opened Roaring Dragon House just outside of Waterdeep circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
Brarindra was quite skilled at running a large gambling hall operation. On her shifts she oversaw the many escorts, servers, coin keepers (people who ran the games), tellers, and over forty mercenary guards at the Roaring Dragon.
She had many duties during the day-to-day operation of a popular night spot. One of them was acquiring beasts and monsters to battle in the pit for the crowds entertainment. It was known in some circles that she had a standing offer of 600 gold pieces for any unintelligent, healthy monsters that were able to put up a good fight for the clientele.
Brarindra was the niece of Drengar Harbright, proprietor of the High Flagon inn and gambling hall, one of the other Harbright family businesses. He had the Roaring Dragon House built and put her and her brother, Thoalur, in charge. They took turns working twelve-hour shifts, occasionally relieved by other members of the Harbright clan.
