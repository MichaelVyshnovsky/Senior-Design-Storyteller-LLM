        "mainbody": "Daluth was a Sharran faithful during the mid-8 century DR.\nHe was a bald man with purple and black robes. He spoke with a thick drawl.\nHe looted a plethora of magic from Karsus Keep.\nDaluth was one of Elryns dreadspells. He was not greatly loyal in extreme situations.\nAs a dreadspell, he wielded borrowed arcane power.\nDaluth was one of the dreadspells sent with Elryn to find and slay a Chosen of Mystra near Westgate two tendays into the Chaos of the Art in the . During the first leg of the trip, he had Uldus Blackram lead the way, while a knife to the mans back. During the first leg of their trip, Uldus Blackram was killed by Ilbryn Starym, an elven wizard they chanced upon.\nOnce they found the ruin, Karsus Keep, Daluth helped loot it of valuables. Once their looted magic failed against Azuth, despite bringing down the ruin, they fled.\nWhen Dread Sister Klalaera appeared and herded them back against Azuth, they were stopped partway by Umbregard and Starsunder, two mages that appeared suddenly. During the battle, after being injured by a beam that bared the flesh of his shoulder and the Dreadspells subsequently being reduced to just two, Daluth struck with a wand against Klalaera upon death, her body to become animated by the power of Darklady Avroana. He was killed by a bolt of dark flame sprouting from her mouth, which left hardly anything of him."
