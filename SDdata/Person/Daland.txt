Daland was a wandering cleric in service of Kelemvor, the God of Death in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Following the death of Myrkul during the Time of Troubles, the new God of Death took the perished deitys mantle. The Church of Kelemvor was sending its clerics to claim Myrkuls shrines and temples. Daland was one of the priests tasked with finding and consecrating the old gods sites. In 1370 DR, Daland discovered the old Temple of Myrkul in Undermountain and took it upon himself to perform the consecration. When he reached the site in the temples crypt, he picked up and read a cursed scroll and became unable to move, like a living statue. Serendipitously, an agent of Khelben Arunsun came across the paralyzed cleric while searching for an artifact. The Khelbenite agreed to use the unfortunate priests potion of dragons blood to consecrate the dead gods shrine, breaking the curse and rescuing Daland.
