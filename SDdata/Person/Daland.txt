'''Daland''' was a wandering [[cleric]] in service of [[Kelemvor]], the God of Death in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Following the death of [[Myrkul]] during the [[Time of Troubles]], the new God of Death took the perished deity's mantle. The Church of Kelemvor was sending its clerics to claim Myrkul's shrines and temples. Daland was one of the priests tasked with finding and consecrating the old god's sites. In [[1370 DR]], Daland discovered the old Temple of Myrkul in Undermountain and took it upon himself to perform the consecration. When he reached the site in the temple's crypt, he picked up and read a cursed [[scroll]] and became unable to move, like a living statue. Serendipitously, an agent of [[Khelben Arunsun]] came across the paralyzed cleric while searching for an artifact. The [[Khelbenite]] agreed to use the unfortunate priest's ''[[potion of dragon's blood]]'' to consecrate the dead god's shrine, breaking the curse and rescuing Daland.
