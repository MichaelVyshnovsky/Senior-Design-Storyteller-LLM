        "mainbody": "Wadsworth was a Helmite priest in Maztica in 1362 DR.\nTogether with his fellows Delian and Elkhound, Wadsorth was a missionary in the village of Maju, on the plains between the Chuapli Forest and the Narabatun Jungle. He acted as a spokesman amongst the priests.\nIn 1362 DR, Wadsworth and his fellow priests told an adventuring party hired by Bishop Devane about the priestess Mirandos, Each of the priests put forward their own theories on the mysterious disappearance.  Wadsworth believed shed fallen into temptation after reading something in the Maju scrolls and fell astray, Delian believed her to have been kidnapped by Payit \"savages\" seeking revenge for the burning, and Elkhound believed her to have fallen under some sort of a curse from the books and fled into the night.\nAs proof of their claims, the three Helmite priests then presented a partially-burnt map that they had found in Mirandoss private quarters. The map depicted one of the coasts of Far Payit, north of the Bilchak River, with marks denoting the lost city of Ixtzul and a route leading to it from the north. Wadsworth proposed that the mark on the map was indeed meant to indicate some sort of lost city. Elkhound speculated it was marking some sort of tower where dark sorcery was being conducted. And Deilan theorized it was a secret base for Payits rallying together to launch an attack on the Amnians. The priests then informed the adventurers that Amnian soldiers had combed the area two tendays prior, as far south as the Narabatun Jungle, but had turned up nothing.\nHaving learned all that they could from the priests, the adventurers tried to take off on the horses that had been provided to them, but the three priests insisted that the adventurers leave the horses behind on the grounds that they were property of the Church of Helm."
