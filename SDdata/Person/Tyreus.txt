'''Tyreus''' was an [[archmage]] from the world of [[Ravnica]] who came to [[Faerûn]] in search of the ''[[Stone of Creation]]'' during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|What cowards. What a lack of vision.|Tyreus.}}

==Description==
Tyreus had light skin.

==Personality==
The powerful mage was heavily motivated by the death of his parents, and his helplessness to protect them.

Over time, Tyreus became increasingly spiteful and selfish. This was a form of insecurity, taken by Tyreus to give himself more time to think through situations.

Tyreus saw every realm as potential future conquests, or viewed resources solely as means to an achieve his goals.

==Abilities==
Tyreus sought to accumulate enough [[magic]]al power to fulfill the grand future for which he was destined. His study of the arcane arts were focused largely on [[illusion]]s, ones that were so precise, they manifested in real and tangible ways. He viewed his illusions as the key to manipulating others, and manifesting his fate.

He knew and regularly utilized the spell ''[[linked glyphs]]'', as well as ''[[mighty fortress]]'', ''[[maze]]'', and ''[[plane shift]]'', among others.

==Possessions==
Tyreus amassed a significant fortune of [[gp|gold coins]] and art objects, totaling over 18,000 [[gp]] in value.

==Activities==
In defiance of his father's wishes, Tyreus began studying arcane magic as a teenager.

==Relationships==
Tyreus was the son of [[Ayraea]] and [[Tyberio]], and the grandson of [[Sylvene]], a [[planewalker|planewalking]] adventurer originally from Ravnica. When his parents died of illness, Tyreus blamed them for the tragedy. He believed that if he was allowed to study arcane magic earlier in life, he would have had the power to save their lives. 

At some point, Tyreus placed a ''[[geas]]'' on the [[elemental]] [[spirit]] named [[Exul]], and treated the extraplanar being as his personal minion.

Tyreus' tremendous abilities and ambition attracted many other power-hungry wizards. He believed he could only form genuine relationships once he had accumulated enough power and his own realm. For a brief time, Tyreus formed a tenuous partnership with the [[Red Wizard]], Morwena Veilmist. She attempted to convince Tyreus they could acquire power together, but quickly learned the archmage was only focused on his own ends. Unfortunately, they never developed any real trust with each other.

==History==
{{Quote|He's only out for himself. He's a powerful mage already, but he cannot see himself or others well enough to recognize how dangerous he is. What a waste.|[[Morwena Veilmist]].}}

Tyreus was born and raised on the planar city of Ravnica. He studied magic in secret during his youth, in defiance of his parents' wishes. When he was a teenager, plague struck his him, claiming the lives of his parents, Tyberio and Ayraea. After their deaths, he poured himself into his studies, hoping to gain enough knowledge to regain control over his life.

At some point during the late 15{{th}} century, Tyreus and his elemental servant Exul traveled to the [[Wizard's Barrow]] in the [[High Moor]] in search of a great [[tome]] bound in white [[leather]]. His exploits attracted the attention of several Red Wizards, including Morwena Veilmist, and her apprentices.

Tyreus and Morwena traveled to a secluded [[demiplane]] once formed by Tyreus' grandmother Sylvene. During their visit, the archmage flew into a fit of rage when [[Seero]]―one of the demiplane's caretakers―apparently took on a likeness that resembled Tyreus' father. Tyreus killed Seero in his anger. Aghast at the situated, Morwena departed from Tyreus' company, then aware that goals did not truly align with each other.

Tyreus' journey took him to the Sylvene's familial crypt, where he believed powerful magic remained. It was there that Tyreus recovered one of the whole ''[[Stone of Creation|Stones of Creation]]''.
