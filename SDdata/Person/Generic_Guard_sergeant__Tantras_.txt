A member of the Guard of the city of Tantras in the Vast was a sergeant, also called a "longsword".
Sergeants of the Guard were outfitted in blue oiled plate mail armor emblazoned with the coat of arms of Tantras three silver stars over a silver breaking wave on a field of royal blue, called the "blue and silver". They carried longswords and maces.
Sergeants led the 14-strong units of men-at-arms that patrolled the city. When multiple units were involved, they took orders from officers.
