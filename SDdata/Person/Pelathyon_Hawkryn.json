        "mainbody": "'''Pelathyon Hawkryn''' was an [[Impiltur]]an [[wizard]] from the noble [[Hawkryn]] family who lived in the city of [[Hlammach]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. His family owned many [[moonstone]] mines in the [[Earthfast Mountains]] and garnered much wealth from their operation.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}",
        "Abilities": "Pelathyon was notable for his \"moonstone magic\" in which he took advantage of the innate power of moonstone to use carefully measured amounts of it as substitutes for most of the organic [[material component]]s in his [[spell]]s.",
        "History": "In the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], Pelathyon founded the [[Moonstone Manse]], an academy for the [[the Art|arcane arts]] that specialized in [[magic]] related to the manipulation of [[Weave|the Weave]] and [[gem]]s and other valuable minerals, particularly moonstone.\n\nWhile some believed this school was simply a self-serving endeavour to increase his family's wealth, others believed it garnered favor from [[Mystra]] and brought prestige to the [[Easting Reach]] within the world of [[Faer√ªn]]ian [[mage]]s."
