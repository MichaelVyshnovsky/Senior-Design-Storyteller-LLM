        "mainbody": "Pelathyon Hawkryn was an Impilturan wizard from the noble Hawkryn family who lived in the city of Hlammach during the 14 century DR. His family owned many moonstone mines in the Earthfast Mountains and garnered much wealth from their operation.\nPelathyon was notable for his \"moonstone magic\" in which he took advantage of the innate power of moonstone to use carefully measured amounts of it as substitutes for most of the organic material components in his spells.\nIn the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, Pelathyon founded the Moonstone Manse, an academy for the arcane arts that specialized in magic related to the manipulation of the Weave and gems and other valuable minerals, particularly moonstone.\nWhile some believed this school was simply a self-serving endeavour to increase his familys wealth, others believed it garnered favor from Mystra and brought prestige to the Easting Reach within the world of Faer√ªnian mages."
