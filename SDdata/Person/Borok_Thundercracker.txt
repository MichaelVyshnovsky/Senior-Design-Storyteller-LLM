'''Borok Thundercracker''' was a [[dwarf|dwarfish]] hero who lived long before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Borok's fame came after he led several successful military campaigns against [[giant]]s and other "tall vermin" that menaced dwarven communities at the time. His [[enchanted]] [[war hammer]] faced many opponents, gaining its name – ''[[Borok's Fist]]'', the weapon that was called his "little iron fist" by Borok's [[elf|elven]] allies behind his back. Many thought the weapon to be ''[[bless]]ed''. Subsequently, Borok Thundercracker's war hammer left the dwarf's possessions, eventually ending up in the city of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]].
