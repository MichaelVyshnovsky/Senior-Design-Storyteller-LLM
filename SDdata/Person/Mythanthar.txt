'''Mythanthar''' was an [[elf]] [[archmage]] of [[Cormanthyr]].

{{quote|''This tale is quite old. It is said that Mythanthar himself created [[portal]]s throughout the city, great gateways of magic that the people were glad to use. He put upon these gateways his great seal. In days of old, the Ways were open to all. But when the Wars came, many of the Ways were sealed, and have been sealed ever since.''|[[Beriand]]}}

==Personality==
His focus was so extreme, the [[Srinshee]] used to joke about it.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|292|15}}

==Description==
He was slight, aged, and dressed in simple robes.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|275-277|14}}

==Abilities==
Mythanthor lost the ability to cast elven high magic to an accident.

He had developed the ''[[glasshields]]'' spell, as a powered down from his stronger ''[[glasshields (greater)|glassshields]]'' version.{{cite book/The Fall of Myth Drannor|60}} He was also one of the Srinshee's three apprentices who learned the greater version of ''[[Srinshee's spell shift]]''.{{cite book/The Fall of Myth Drannor|61}}

Amongst other spells, he knew one that enveloped targets in a golden sphere, cutting them in half.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|299-300|15}} One of his abilities allowed him to block rays of fire with a gesture, and he knew a spell to redirect numerous spells at once towards a different target.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|346-347|20}} He possessed a [[mantle (Cormathan)|mantle]].

==History==
He was once a student of the Srinshee. Around {{yearlink|-2750}}, 3000 years prior to {{yearlink|241}}, he had been developing "[[spell field]]s" from mantles, for use by their war captains.

Mythanthor spent his last centuries researching the possibility of creating a spell linking [[Elven high magic]] with common wizardly magic after an accident that stripped him of the ability to cast elven high magic. When in {{yearlink|241}}, the Coronal announced he was working on a ''[[mythal]]'' that would allow the Opening to proceed on their terms, Mythanthor became immediately the target of several assassination attempts, including one by [[Haemir Waelvor]] and several [[Starym]] which resulted in the destruction of [[Starfall Turret]], where he was working.

On {{yearlink|261}}, he thwarted an assassination attempt from [[Llombaerth Starym]], in which the Lord Speaker of the Starym deceived his apprentice, [[Elminster Aumar]], into casting ''[[lifequench]]'' on [[Nacacia]], his other apprentice, to augment an ''[[antimagic field]]'' on Mythanthar's present hideout. Unknown to Llombaerth, Mythanthor not only prevailed over the field with a [[spell shear]], but had also prevented the ''lifequench'' spell with a ''[[seeming]]'', and used this to reveal Llombaerth's plan to frame Elminster;{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|337-338|19}} He fought against the Starym in the coup that followed.

Mythanthor infused his own life-force in the spell laying the ''mythal'' that took place immediately after the coup; in truth, he became himself the ''mythal''.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|4-6}}

==Legacy==
Though he recorded the spells to create the ''mythal'' in ''[[Mythanthar's Folio]]'', the book went missing from the [[Vault of Ages]] not long after, while his notes went missing from his tower.{{cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 5}}

Another feat of magic accomplished by Mythanthar was a network of magic gateways placed around the city of Myth Drannor and its underground structures. These portals were still operational as late as the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], despite being sealed and protected. Some of them were unlocked in 1369 DR by the [[Veiled Ones]].

A monument dedicated to Mythanthar was erected in front of the [[Speculum]] in Myth Drannor. The statue remained undamaged into the late 14{{th}} century DR.

==Trivia==
''[[Mythanthor's Orb]]'' may or may not be related to him, but it was almost certainly named after him.{{cite book/Hellgate Keep|15-16}}
