'''Flar''', also rendered as '''Flarr''', was a warrior and [[adventurer]] who was a leader of the [[Company of the Gryphon]] up to the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. Notably, Flar was a wielder of  ''[[Namarra]]'', the Sword That Never Sleeps.{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|22}}

==History==
At some point, the Company of the Gryphon killed a [[goblin]] wielding an [[enchanted]] sword named [[Ghaur]]. Flar, the company's then leader, claimed the sword and found it was the legendary ''Namarra'', which the goblins of the [[Valley of Khedrun]] had looted in the plundering of [[Mirabar]] during the [[Goblin Wars]] in {{yearlink|753}}.It is unclear when this occurred. The sources say the goblins had the sword "for almost two hundred seasons", but it is unknown if this is meant to be 200 years (''e.g.'', 200 winters) or only 50 years (four seasons per year). Moreover, Namarra's timeline has been stretched by later dating, so it can only be some time between c. 800 DR or c. 950 DR and the 1270s DR. As the timeline is stretched, both presumed dates are difficult to fitâ€”Flar may have the sword for up to ~470 or ~320 years and seems very long-lived.

Later, to pay for training in the combat arts, Flar gave ''Namarra'' to [[Thulmar One-Eye]] of [[Port Llast]] around the 1270s DR.
