        "History": "Sandrew hailed from the [[Silver Marches]] and in [[1358 DR]] he was working at the [[Halls of Inspiration]] in [[Silverymoon]].\n\nHe later settled in Waterdeep, ''circa'' [[1362 DR]], with the objective of building a temple and a library worthy of his god and the City of Splendors. As part of this effort he recruited many clerics from his former temple.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{DDTS}} on the 17{{th}} and 18{{th}} of Eleint, Sandrew was officiating the wedding ceremony between the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]] [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] and [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]]. The event was swept away by a whirlwind of sinister plots around the wedding.\n\nHe was later one of four clerics of Oghma among the many powerful mages that [[Khelben Arunsun]] brought together in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, in order to cleanse part of the [[High Moor]] and restore [[Faer'tel'miir]], a lost city of [[Miyeritar]]."
