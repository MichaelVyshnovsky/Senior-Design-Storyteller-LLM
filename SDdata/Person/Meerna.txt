Meerna was a deep gnome Burrow Warden of Clan Ironhand, who lived in the city of Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR. She was part of an unfortunate excursion to the Underdark that led to much of her clan being killed or captured by the Cult of the Absolute.
Meerna had gray skin and mane of white hair gathered in a bushy ponytail.
Meerna kept a detailed book of reports during the exodus to the Underdark. The books last entry on the "Expedition #42" reported on the trip to the northern quadrant and a discovery of two potential mining sites and a vein of arandur. The book stated that the gnomes began mining under the supervision of Meernas brother Welso, who she thought to eventually make a fine Burrow Warden.
In the , Meerna, her brother Welso, and the other deep gnomes of Clan Ironhand journeyed down to the Underdark from Baldurs Gate, on a mission to uncover the mythical substance known as runepowder. While searching for the long-lost site known as Grymforge, they were attacked by cultists of the Absolute led by Gekh Coal and other duergar slavers. Meerna was among those who survived and was condemned to working for the cultists at the Grymforge. It was likely Meerna had perished in a lake of lava, kicked into it by the True Soul Nere while within the Grymforge.
