'''Meerna''' was a [[deep gnome]] Burrow Warden of [[Clan Ironhand]], who lived in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was part of an unfortunate excursion to the [[Underdark]] that led to much of her clan being killed or captured by the [[Cult of the Absolute]].

==Description==
Meerna had gray skin and mane of white hair gathered in a bushy ponytail.

==Activities==
Meerna kept a detailed book of reports during the exodus to the Underdark. The book's last entry on the "Expedition #42" reported on the trip to the northern quadrant and a discovery of two potential mining sites and a vein of [[arandur]]. The book stated that the gnomes began mining under the supervision of Meerna's brother [[Welso]], who she thought to eventually make a fine Burrow Warden.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Meerna, her brother Welso, and the other deep gnomes of Clan Ironhand journeyed down to the Underdark from Baldur's Gate, on a mission to uncover the mythical substance known as ''[[runepowder]]''. While searching for the long-lost site known as [[Grymforge]], they were attacked by [[Cult of the Absolute|cultists of the Absolute]] led by [[Gekh Coal]] and other [[duergar]] slavers. Meerna was among those who survived and was condemned to working for the cultists at the Grymforge. It was likely Meerna had perished in a lake of lava, kicked into it by the [[True Soul]] [[Nere]] while within the Grymforge.
