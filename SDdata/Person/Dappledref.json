        "mainbody": "Dappledref was a human beggar and con man.\nHe was fair of skin and brown of hair. He dressed in a drab, sleeveless tunic, fastened at the waist with a belt.\nDappledref had no qualms about conning people or begging for their money. In fact, he found it preferable to the alternative of outright stealing from them. Dappledref was not motivated by profit, merely by avoiding having to do honest work for a living.\nNot a wealthy man, Dappledref owned little more than the rags on his body and a tin cup to collect alms.\nDappledrefs favorite scheme was to pose as a blind man, begging for coins. Other schemes included selling sham potions, and falsely posing as a priest for a new god. He rarely made much money on his grifts."
