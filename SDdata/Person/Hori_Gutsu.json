        "mainbody": "Hori Gutsu was a samurai retainer of the Niwa clan, who ran a posthouse in Kozakura in 1357 DR.\nIn a very tranquil posthouse inside a Niwa shoen, located at an equal distance between Tamanokuni and Kuda, he led a company of ten samurai and thirty bushi, plus twenty servants, mostly from the Hori clan.\nHori was very proud of his position and took any kind of flaw in the performance of the posthouse as a personal offense. If someone lied about a flaw, then Hori would seek revenge against the slanderer."
