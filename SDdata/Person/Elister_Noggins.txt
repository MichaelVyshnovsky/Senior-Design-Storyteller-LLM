'''Elister Noggins''' was a [[rock gnome]] priest of [[Gond]] from [[Loudwater]].

==History==
Elister lived in Loudwater as a clockmaker with his friend the clockwork [[construct]] [[Tick Tock]].

In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], he was captured by some [[stone giant]] raiders that took him to their thane [[Kayalithica]] when Elister said he knew about Loudwater's defenses. The stone giant put him inside a pouch tied to her [[mithral]] belt while waiting for her minions to check if the gnome told the truth about his city's defenses.
