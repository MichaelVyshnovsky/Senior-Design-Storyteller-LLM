He always acted in unison with his mate [[Venomindhar]], also called Venom, and nobody realized they were in fact two dragons.",
        "History": "Settling in the Emerald Vale in {{Yearlink|-982}}, they corrupted the area until it became known as [[Tangled Vale]].\n\nThey also killed many [[centaur]]s during this age.\n\nThe female Venom, Venomindhar, was slain in battle in {{YearlinkName|-249}}.\n\nThe male Venom was eventually confronted and killed by the [[moon elf]] warrior [[Jassin Aunglor]] in the {{YearlinkName|-206}}.\n\nAt one point they sired an heir, [[Vendemniharan]], who later joined the [[Cult of the Dragon]]."
