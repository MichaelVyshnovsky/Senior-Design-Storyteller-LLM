        "mainbody": "Maatsuki was a hengeyokai wu jen and member of the Iridescent Peacock Society based in Dojyu in Kozakura around 1431 on the Kozakuran Calendar (1357 DR).\nAs a traveling magic-user, Maatsuki often wandered far from Dojyu. While she might try to join an adventuring group to spend the time, she would turn on them and cause havoc if she saw an opportunity to do so and advance the Iridescent Peacock Societys cause.\nMaatsuki would also try to recruit suitable, evil wu jen into the Society, and kill those who declined.\nShe was mischievous and moody."
