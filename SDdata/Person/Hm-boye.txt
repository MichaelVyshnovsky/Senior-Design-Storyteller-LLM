Hm-boye was a human warrior who lived in the city of Procampur in the Vast in the early 1360s DR.
Though his mother apparently came from somewhere in Kara-Tur, Hm-boye only ever remembered living in Procampur. He lived in a rough neighborhood in the harbor district, near the wharves. Though he was no criminal, the city guards often tried to arrest him on sight anyway.
Hm-boye was capable of acrobatic martial arts and more conventional weapon techniques.
He owned a ring of jumping.
