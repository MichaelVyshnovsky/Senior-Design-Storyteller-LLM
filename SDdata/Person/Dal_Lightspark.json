        "mainbody": "'''Lightspark''' was a [[gold dwarf]] [[Harper]] who followed the High Harper [[Jaheira]] to the [[Shadow-cursed lands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''The forest... no escape... the darkness turns all... twists all...''|Essius}}",
        "Description": "At the time of his death, Lightspark had a bald head and a beardless face. He wore a blue [[tunic]], [[leather]] [[bracers]] and [[boots]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Jaheira was alerted to the mysterious return of [[Ketheric Thorm]], now a leader of a [[Cult of the Absolute|cultist army]] that worshiped [[the Absolute]]. Harper Lightspark was one of the agents who accompanied Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed lands surrounding the [[Moonrise Towers]]—General Thorm's seat of power.\n\nWhen the Harpers found shelter in the [[Last Light Inn]], protected by [[Selûne]]'s magic, Lightspark was among the scouts who left the safety of the inn and ventured into the shadow-cursed lands in search of gaps in cultist defenses. He discovered that the cultist caravans that moved to the Moonrise Towers found a way of remaining unaffected by the deathly shadowmagic. However, Harper Lightspark did not get a chance to deliver his findings to the High Harper. He was found dead in the shadow-cursed lands, consumed by the curse."
