He wore a blue tunic, leather bracers and boots.\nIn the , Jaheira was alerted to the mysterious return of Ketheric Thorm, now a leader of a cultist army that worshiped the Absolute. Harper Lightspark was one of the agents who accompanied Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed lands surrounding the Moonrise Towers—General Thorms seat of power.\nWhen the Harpers found shelter in the Last Light Inn, protected by Selûnes magic, Lightspark was among the scouts who left the safety of the inn and ventured into the shadow-cursed lands in search of gaps in cultist defenses. He discovered that the cultist caravans that moved to the Moonrise Towers found a way of remaining unaffected by the deathly shadowmagic. However, Harper Lightspark did not get a chance to deliver his findings to the High Harper. He was found dead in the shadow-cursed lands, consumed by the curse."
