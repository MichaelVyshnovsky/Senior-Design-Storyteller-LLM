==Description==
Anita was a [[human]] woman with a tan skin, straight brown hair, and hazel eyes.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Anita and [[Elias Fischer]] suffered a terrible loss. The couple's seven-year-old daughter [[Lily Fischer|Lily]] was murdered, leaving her parents grief-stricken. Anita and Elias planned on burying their daughter in the [[Lower City Graveyard]], but the undertaker carpenter, [[Ulkov Sully]], demanded a priority fee for a coffin due to a massive backlog of funerals caused by the skyrocketing numbers of murders in the Gate. Without paying the fee, something the Fischers could not do, it would've taken a month of wait time. Anita and her husband tried their best to get Lily buried via negotiations and demands from the [[Valmorba]] and her mortuary.
