        "mainbody": "'''Miltinda''' was the romantic partner of the scholar [[Wently Kelso]], who lived in [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].",
        "History": "Miltinda was mentioned in Kelso's journals, which were compiled into ''[[The World Beneath Waterdeep]]''. Kelso claimed to have taken jewellery from his exhibition for her. When he returned from under the city, Miltinda bade goodbye to Kelso once again when he began his journey to [[Torzac]]. Kelso noted that he would return to Waterdeep at the time of [[Highharvestide]], to spend it with her. However, close to the date of the festival, the guard captain, [[Oltec]], found a carriage that was attacked, along with Kelso's journals."
