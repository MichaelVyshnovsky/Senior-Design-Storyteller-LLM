'''Hilario Varota''' was a middle class inhabitant of the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''You've got to talk to the locals if you want the true story about Stelmane's death. The gazette would never print all the juicy details. I hope they stitched up the pieces before they sent the body to the family. If they could find them all, that is.''|Hilario Varota}}

==Description==
Hilario was a male [[rock gnome]] light brown wavy curls and amber eyes. He wore a fine quality doublet of bright colors.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, Hilario Varota could be found in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]], gossiping with his [[dwarf|dwarvish]] friend, [[Megthanet]]. Megthanet expressed her disgust with the food at a local eatery, the [[Elfsong]] tavern, and the two discussed the death of Duke [[Belynne Stelmane]]. Hilario was adamant that only the locals knew knew the story of her death, and not the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette.''
