        "mainbody": "The man only known as '''Tief of Selûne''' was one of the very few tieflings in [[the Vast]] and a prominent [[Selûnite]] adventurer from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Tief of Selûne had some feline features.",
        "History": "As reported in the [[Kythorn]] issue of the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}{{LCRB}}, Tief of Selûne participated in a grand [[Greengrass]] celebration in Ravens Bluff. [[Clio Hesperin]], a journalist of the ''Trumpeter'' reported that Tief of Selûne got into a catfight with the [[mage]] named [[Metamorphisis Cateyes]] over a tub of [[catnip]].\n\nSoon after, Tief of Selûne, alongside many other prominent Selûnites, participated in the recovery of the ''[[Selûne Orb]]'', an [[artifact]] hidden in the [[Earthfast Mountains]]. This adventure was joined by Dame [[Leiren Hollybow]], who later reported on it on the pages of the ''Trumpeter.'' The adventure began at a banquet organized by Sir [[Lorien Keltree Darkarrow]] at the [[Temple of Selûne (Ravens Bluff)|Temple of Selûne]] at which the temple's clergy revealed that the artifact's location was divined and that those who would recover the relic would have a chance of heading the Temple of Selûne. Tief of Selûne and others headed head first into the adventure through a ''[[gate]]'' opened for them. During the quest, the group faced [[undead]] [[gnoll]]s, a strange [[dwarf]], dozens of [[cyclops]]es, a dangerous descent into a spiraling cavern, and lastly, the artifact's guardian – an ancient [[topaz dragon]]. Tief of Selûne took the brunt of the dragon's dehydrating [[breath weapon]] in the battle. The tiefling was severely hurt and turned into a desiccated husk of a man, close to death. The adventurers had to use the ''[[fly]]'' [[spell]] to transport him back to the city. Once back, the adventurers applied their hands on the artifact to find out which of them was chosen by the goddess to lead the temple. [[Alric Markonnen]], [[Darren of Selûne]], Dame Valas Stargazer-Blackmantle, and Dame [[Amanda Redmoon]] were all instructed to touch the artifact and receive the goddess' blessing, making them the new leaders of the temple. However, Tief, in his weakened state, touched the artifact unprompted and was struck dead."
