        "mainbody": "The man only known as Tief of Selûne was one of the very few tieflings in the Vast and a prominent Selûnite adventurer from the city of Ravens Bluff, active in the late 14 century DR.\nTief of Selûne had some feline features.\nAs reported in the Kythorn issue of the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter of the , Tief of Selûne participated in a grand Greengrass celebration in Ravens Bluff. Clio Hesperin, a journalist of the Trumpeter reported that Tief of Selûne got into a catfight with the mage named Metamorphisis Cateyes over a tub of catnip.\nSoon after, Tief of Selûne, alongside many other prominent Selûnites, participated in the recovery of the Selûne Orb, an artifact hidden in the Earthfast Mountains. This adventure was joined by Dame Leiren Hollybow, who later reported on it on the pages of the Trumpeter. The adventure began at a banquet organized by Sir Lorien Keltree Darkarrow at the Temple of Selûne at which the temples clergy revealed that the artifacts location was divined and that those who would recover the relic would have a chance of heading the Temple of Selûne. Tief of Selûne and others headed head first into the adventure through a gate opened for them. During the quest, the group faced undead gnolls, a strange dwarf, dozens of cyclopses, a dangerous descent into a spiraling cavern, and lastly, the artifacts guardian – an ancient topaz dragon. Tief of Selûne took the brunt of the dragons dehydrating breath weapon in the battle. The tiefling was severely hurt and turned into a desiccated husk of a man, close to death. The adventurers had to use the fly spell to transport him back to the city. Once back, the adventurers applied their hands on the artifact to find out which of them was chosen by the goddess to lead the temple. Alric Markonnen, Darren of Selûne, Dame Valas Stargazer-Blackmantle, and Dame Amanda Redmoon were all instructed to touch the artifact and receive the goddess blessing, making them the new leaders of the temple. However, Tief, in his weakened state, touched the artifact unprompted and was struck dead."
