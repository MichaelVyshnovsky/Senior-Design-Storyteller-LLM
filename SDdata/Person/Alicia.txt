'''Lady Alicia''' was the head of the [[Zhentarim]] wizards at the [[Citadel of the Raven]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].

==History==
Alicia grew up in [[Zhentil Keep]] and soon she joined the Zhentarim. Under the tutelage of [[Manshoon]] Alicia was elected to the [[Council of Lords (Zhentil Keep)|Council of Lords]]. She escaped the siege of the Keep by [[Cyric]]'s horde in [[1368 DR]] thanks to Manshoon, and in 1370 DR, after the [[Manshoon Wars]] broke out, [[Fzoul Chembryl]] appointed her Mage-Protector of the Citadel with equal rank as the military commander [[Kandar Milinal]].

Alicia plotted to became the consort of the Great Tyrant of [[Bane]], Fzoul himself. She was also one of the few to maintain a business relationship with Lord [[Taradril Aumraven]] in order to control the [[Anauroch]] routes and skim much of the profits.

Her estate was located in the central section of Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Inner Quarter|Inner Quarter]] on [[Wyrms' Way]].
