Lady Alicia was the head of the Zhentarim wizards at the Citadel of the Raven in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Alicia grew up in Zhentil Keep and soon she joined the Zhentarim. Under the tutelage of Manshoon Alicia was elected to the Council of Lords. She escaped the siege of the Keep by Cyrics horde in 1368 DR thanks to Manshoon, and in 1370 DR, after the Manshoon Wars broke out, Fzoul Chembryl appointed her Mage-Protector of the Citadel with equal rank as the military commander Kandar Milinal.
Alicia plotted to became the consort of the Great Tyrant of Bane, Fzoul himself. She was also one of the few to maintain a business relationship with Lord Taradril Aumraven in order to control the Anauroch routes and skim much of the profits.
Her estate was located in the central section of Zhentil Keeps Inner Quarter on Wyrms Way.
