'''Iyraclea''', or simply '''the Ice Queen''', was a female [[human]] [[cleric]], [[divine disciple]], and [[hierophant]] of [[Auril]] the Frostmaiden living within the [[Great Glacier]]. Ancient and mighty, she was the self-proclaimed Ice Queen of the glacier.The Ice Queen is said to be a [[lich]] in ''[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]'', but later sources stat her as a living human. This article adopts the later view.
{{Quote|The Ice Queen built her palace in the [[Great Glacier]] after the fashion of lost [[Jhoth没n]] and long sought its secrets, styling herself its new Empress.|A [[giant]] legend.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of the Frozen Wastes: The Great Glacier}}}}

==History==
Formerly of [[Halruaa]], In time, she constructed an ice castle and assembled a monstrous army, including some [[ice devil]]s.

Eventually, out of [[Myth Ondath]], a city renowned for peace and harmony between races, came explorers who provoked the rage of the Ice Queen. She sent her armies against the pacifist city countless times, but the magical defenses of the ''[[mythal]]'' always turned aside her spells. Seeking a way to bypass these wards, she learned of a powerful [[artifact]] from another [[plane]]. Apparently with the assistance of Auril herself, Iyraclea stole the ''[[Gatekeeper's Crystal]]'' from the hands of the [[Gatekeeper]] in the [[Outlands]].

In [[Eleint]] of the [[632 DR|Year of Burning Skies, 632 DR]], she sent an army commanded by the [[lich]] [[Vrandak|Vrandak the Burnished]], her greatest general, to lay siege to Myth Ondath for one final assault. She also raised great winter storms that lashed the city throughout the year, in an attack called the [[Ice Queen's Winter]].

In the [[633 DR|Year of Chasms, 633 DR]], after an 11-month-long siege, Iyraclea sent Vrandak to sneak into the city. Using two pieces of the ''Gatekeeper's Crystal'', Vrandak nullified the [[Eldath]]yn priests' power to turn [[undead]] as well as all [[necromancy|necromantic]] magic for 50 miles (80 kilometers). Together, Iyraclea and Vrandak used the whole ''Gatekeeper's Crystal'' to destroy the city of Myth Ondath, including its ''mythal''. However, the power of the artifact was too great and Iyraclea's army and her general Vrandak also vanished during the destruction, and the pieces of the ''Gatekeeper's Crystal'' were scattered and lost.

In the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], [[Sammaster]], master of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], who had triggered a premature [[Rage of Dragons]] that year, proposed an alliance to Iyraclea, and she agreed. Sammaster sent to her the [[white dragon]] [[dracolich]] [[Zethrindor]] and a host of [[dragon]]s. Zethrindor helped Iyraclea to conquer all the Great Glacier and afterward they marched over [[Sossal]]. The conquest of the [[druid]]ic nation proceeded well until [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]] approached Zethrindor, whispering that Iyraclea plotted to betray Sammaster with power hidden in ruins in the [[Novularond|Novularond Mountains]]. Soon, the white dracolich went to the ruins hoping to achieve that power for himself. Iyraclea also discovered that information and marched to the same location. [[Dorn Graybrook]]'s adventuring party arrived at the ruins, and a terrible three-sided-battle broke out. Zethrindor killed the Ice Witch during the fighting.

After Iyraclea's death, Auril elevated her to become one of her exarchs and set her to work foiling the plots of [[Akadi]]'s spies within the [[Land Under Eternal Ice]].{{Cite dragon/367/Hall of the Frostmaiden|61}} Meanwhile, she was survived by an ''[[iceborn]]'' [[clone]] of herself hidden in a great vault beneath the [[Delhalls]] in [[Vaasa]], who believed that it was the true Iyraclea.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|5}}

==Personality==
Iyraclea was almost the personification of the goddess Auril's cold fury.

==Description==
Iyraclea had long golden-hued hair. Her skin bore gray and white sigils of Auril's holy symbol.

==Activities==
Iyraclea was the ruler of the Great Glacier.

Around [[1372 DR]], Iyraclea was known for her habit of using magic to kidnap healthy young [[wizard]]s from Sossal, [[Damara]], and Vaasa, for an unknown but no doubt evil purpose. Some wondered if she stole their life essences to extend her own unnatural lifespan, while others feared she was building an army of mages, who served her through loyalty or some form of coercion. Others dreaded that she was harnessing their magical power to extend the Great Glacier into the [[Cold Lands]] once more.

Iyraclea was very interested in discovering the lost [[giant]] civilization of [[Jhoth没n]], which was thought to be buried somewhere below the Great Glacier. One of her gelugon servants, [[Tosvin]], had actually discovered a portal leading to one of the cities of Jhoth没n, but he kept his discovery from her.

==Abilities==
As a high-ranking [[cleric]], she wielded great divine magic, commanding the domains of [[Air domain|Air]], [[Storm domain|Storm]], and [[Water domain|Water]]. She created a few mighty [[spell]]s of her own: ''[[cold claws]]'', ''[[ice fist]]'', and ''[[icerazor]]''.

She once used a ''[[miracle]]'' to make herself utterly immune to the effects of cold.

As a [[divine disciple]] of Auril, she was resistant to divine magic and the magic of [[outsider]] creatures; she could communicate telepathically with all outsiders that either served her goddess or were [[neutral evil]], to a distance of 60 feet (18 meters); and could 
[[Imbue with spell ability|grant the use of her spells]] to her servants. Furthermore, she had transcended her natural form to become an outsider, a creature of the divine, herself, becoming resistant to fire and electricity, able to ward herself with ''[[protection from good]]'', and highly influential with fellow followers of Auril.

As a [[hierophant]], her [[spell]]s were more powerful, her [[negative energy]] spells were more potent against [[neutral good]] beings, and her arm's-reach spells could hit foes up to 30 feet (9 meters) away. Furthermore, she could cast ''[[cone of cold]]'' and ''[[ice storm]]'' innately, a few times a day.

She was somehow unnaturally long-lived.

In addition to her skills as a priestess, spell-wielder, and a ruler, she was also a capable warrior, an expert in wilderness lore and a survival, and a crafter of magical weapons and armors.

==Possessions==
Iyraclea bore a ''[[staff of frost]]'', though it lacked the ''[[wall of frost]]'' power. She went into battle wielding a ''+3 [[icy burst]] [[battleaxe]]'', ''+5 [[mighty]] [[icy burst]] [[composite shortbow]]'' with ''+5 [[arrow]]s'', carrying ''+5 moderate [[fortification]] [[large steel shield]]'', and wearing ''+5 [[fire resistance]] [[full plate]]''. She also wore a ''[[ring of evasion]]'' and a ''[[ring of freedom of movement]]'', an ''[[amulet of natural armor]] +3'', a ''[[cloak of resistance]] +2'', and a ''[[periapt of wisdom]] +6''. She also owned and made use of a ''[[rod of absorption]]'', a ''[[rod of flame extinguishing]]'', and a ''minor [[circlet of blasting]]''.

A holy book of the [[Church of Auril]], ''[[Revelations of the Icedawn]]'', was directly bestowed upon Iyraclea by her goddess and was kept in her possession.{{Cite dragon/312/Faiths of Faerun: Prayers of the Frostmaiden|62}}

==Base==
Iyraclea dwelt in or beneath a castle of sculpted ice lying somewhere in the northernmost part Great Glacier, but few ever saw it and lived to speak of it.

==Relations==
The Ice Queen was served by a number of [[ice devil]]s, or [[gelugon]]s, known as the "[[Icy Claws]] of Iyraclea".

[[Elminster]] once knew Iyraclea. He considered her as one candidate for Augury 14 of the [[Caleph Auguries]], telling of a woman with eyes of moonlit snow, whose anger would cause pain to the land, but he doubted she would destroy the Realms.
