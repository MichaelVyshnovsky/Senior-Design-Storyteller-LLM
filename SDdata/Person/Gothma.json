        "mainbody": "'''Gothma''' was a legendary fabled giant [[vampire bat]] who was said to live underneath [[Gillian's Hill]]'s graveyard, feeding on stray cattle.",
        "Description": "Little was known about the legendary beast. However, a big statue dedicated to Gothma was constructed in the crypt where stories said he lived. The locals eventually made it a tradition to leave small gifts to the monster at the statue, such things as coins, jewelry, [[potion]]s, and other precious knickknacks. Worryingly, the same chamber that held Gothma's stature was a home to a large population of [[bat]]s.",
        "History": "The myth of Gothma was a long-standing scary story told to the children of Gillian's Hill, but even adults sometimes looked up into the night sky with a feeling of gnawing agitation. The dreaded vampire bad was blamed for disappearances of the hamlet's [[sheep]]s and [[cows]] as the stories said the monster swooped from the sky, snatching the beasts away. Some older farmers told a tale about a group of destitute folk who lost too much of their livelihood to Gothma. Armed with [[pitchfork]]s and [[torch]]es, they set out against the bat, venturing into the crypts under the graveyard where the creature laired. According to the story, the farmers were turned into [[vampire]] lords who were cursed with the unlife of servitude to Gothma.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], a [[vampirism]]-like plague-stricken the folk of Gillian's Hill. Some locals, including the mad hermit [[Mabda]], thought that it was Gothma who cursed the peasants, raising them to unlife after the burial. However, it was not true. As the [[Hero of Daggerford]] discovered, some locals saw a [[necromancer]] [[Daxiong]] who wore a cape that made him look like a bat. He made a laboratory in the crypt underneath the graveyard. The necromancer was not responsible for the plague, instead using the corpses of the disease's victims to perform his vile experiments."
