'''Willeth Lionson''' was a [[tharchion]] of [[Thaymount]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was put in charge of the gold mines ''circa'' [[1362 DR]].
{{quote|''Dear Willeth, I do admire your resolve. The council chose well when they selected you. But I am low on patience today.''|Maligor}} 

==Description==
Willeth was squat with a broad, sturdy frame and a barrel-like chest. He had a bald head, which was a sign of status in Thay. His head was decorated with a drawn pale-orange four-clawed paw, the symbol of Malar the Beastlord. The tharchion's clothes were sturdy and of good expensive quality.

==Personality==
Willeth was loyal to the Council of Zulkirs and to Thay, even when faced with torture and death.

==Relationships==
Tharchion Willeth Lionson was selected by the Council of Zulkirs to oversee the [[Thayvian gold mines]] with Maligor's help but remained unaffiliated with individual zulkirs.

==History==
In [[1362 DR]], Willeth Lionson was captured by [[Maligor]], the Zulkir of Transmutation as a part of the wizard's plot to usurp control over Thay. The Red Wizard's gnolls captured Willeth on his way to [[Tantras]] to purchase new mining equipment. His scheduled two-week absence gave Maligor time to carry out his scheme.

Captured Willeth was tortured and, under the influence of the ''[[friends]]'' spell, ended up revealing all the information the Red Wizard was after. He disclosed the locations of traps, the mines' defenses, and the daily production of [[gold]], as well as the newly discovered abundant new vein. Taking control over Thay's gold was fundamental for Maligor's plan. He planned on using his horde of [[darkenbeast]]s to take over the mines and putting his trusted assistant [[Asp (spirit naga)|Asp]] in charge.

After Willeth's usefulness ended, Maligor fed the tortured man to his [[gnoll]] friends. Afterward, he assembling the bones and clothes that were left behind into a sack to be secured to prevent his opponents using magic to communicate with the dead.
