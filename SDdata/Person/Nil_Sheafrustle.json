        "Description": "Nil was stout and too paunchy for a gnome. He was nervous and fidgety individual who continually checked and tested his equipment to ensure everything was in working order.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Nil Sheafrustle commuted from Lantan to the illegal logging operation in [[Samarach]] every morning. His tasks included camp's mechanisms maintenance. Nil belonged to a wealthy gnome family that invested into the operations, so he had personal stake in ensuring the ''portal'' stayed operational. In 1374 DR, Nil was authorized to pay bounties for killing nasty pests and more dangerous creatures that roamed the areas around the camp."
