        "mainbody": "Narthund Delzhour was a sage inhabiting Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nNarthunds areas of expertise included astronomy, astrology, numerology, geology, and mineralogy. His services were quite cheap and at least half of his fees were paid in ale at his favorite tavernâ€”the Elfstone Tavern. However, given his excessive taste for ale, Narthund was only coherent in the early evening."
