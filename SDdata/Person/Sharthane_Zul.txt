Sharthane Zul was the human high priest of Cyric who presided over the House of Cyric in Bezantur in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. As the most influential member of the church of Cyric in Thay, he was one of the most powerful individuals in that realm as of the late 1360s DR. His influence was said to rival that of the zulkirs.
He was a masterful politician as well as suspected of being both a sadist&mdashamusing himself with a private underground torture chamber&mdashand a masochist&mdashknown to willingly give up his life energies in exchange for sexual favors from a succubus.
Sharthane presided over the largest congregation of Cyric-worshipers in all of Thay at the House of Cyric. He lived on the temple grounds in a personal mansion, which was opulent enough to have been the home of a king. He had hundreds of personal slaves.
He was known to traffic with tanarri for information and entertainment.
During the ongoing Thayan civil conflicts of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Sharthane was careful to maintain neutrality lest his political power be tested by the Red Wizards.
