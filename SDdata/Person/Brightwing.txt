'''Brightwing''' was a female [[griffon]], linked to the war-[[mage]] [[Aoth Fezim]].

==Description==
Brightwing was'(2.7 meters) long. Like all griffons, she had a [[lion]]'s body and the wings, forelegs, and head of an eagle. She had scarlet eyes.

She was named Brightwing because even as a cub her feathers had been a lighter shade of gold than normal. Though her beak and throat were not made for articulating [[human]] speech, she could communicate with Aoth, who understood her clacks and squawks. Brightwing loved horseflesh for feed.

==History==
Brightwing almost died in [[1384 DR]] during the [[War of the Zulkirs]], impaled by the [[sword]] of one of [[Szass Tam]]'s [[undead]] champions.
