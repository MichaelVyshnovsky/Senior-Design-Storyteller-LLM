Frizzt BozWevial was a drow wizard and a distant relative of the adventurer Drizzt DoUrden.
Frizzt had night-black skin and a mane of white hair. He had a very pronounced nose, large ears, and a sharp chin. He dressed in a black robe and flame-patterned leather boots, and carried a medallion around his neck.
He owned a robe of the archmagi as well as an amulet of life protection.
Frizzt was gifted his magical robe and amulet at a young age by his distant, famous relative, Drizzt DoUrden. Frizzt found the gift irresponsible, feeling he was much too young to be granted such powerful items. Ultimately, he kept the gifts, and later attempted to use them against Drizzt.
