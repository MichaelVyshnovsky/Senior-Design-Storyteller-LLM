Naldorltyrr Melarn was a drider and weapons master of House Melarn in 1479 DR. 
Naldorltyrr was appointed as weapons master in 1469 DR after the elder boy and previous weapon master was killed at a party. This was a scandal in the city because no drider had never held such a powerful position. However, Naldorltyrr proved that his ability with weapons was unrivaled in his house. He was constantly challenged by rivals, but Naldorltyrr had defeated them all.
