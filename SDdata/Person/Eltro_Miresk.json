        "mainbody": "'''Eltro Miresk''' was the founder of a [[Miresk's School of Thaumaturgy|school of magic]] and the first Magus Senior of the [[Conclave of Silverymoon]].\n\n{{Quote|The novice who knows all the ways an ''[[unseen servant]]'' can be useful is worth six reckless ''[[fireball]]''-hurlers. Or more.\"|Magus Senior Eltro Miresk}}",
        "Description": "Miresk was tall and lean and liked to wear black robes. Wherever he went, he was followed by a set of three floating magical [[rods]], which his students named \"[[Triad (magic item)|''The Triad'']]\".",
        "Personality": "Eltro Miresk was haughty, but he was also a superb teacher. Miresk believed in balance and taught that magic use should be tempered with other natural forces. He encouraged the creative use of simpler \"everyday\" spells over reckless use of the more powerful ones.",
        "Abilities": "Miresk was an exceptionally powerful mage with a vast array of spells at his disposal. He was also particularly skilled in [[alchemy]], arcana and spellcraft, and the knowledge of history. He knew a good deal about nature, religion, and the [[planes of existence]] as well.",
        "Possessions": "\"''The Triad''\" was said by his students to provide the Magus Senior with the powers of several ''[[ioun stone]]s'' in addition to acting like a ''[[wand of negation|rod of negation]]'' and a source of limitless ''[[unseen servant]]'', ''[[hold portal]]'', and ''[[hold monster]]'' spells. Miresk could use any of these powers without actually having to make contact with the floating ''Triad''.",
        "History": "Miresk founded a school of magic from his home in Silverymoon, named [[Miresk's School of Thaumaturgy]]. When High Lady [[Alustriel Silverhand|Alustriel]] founded the Conclave of Silverymoon in [[1369 DR]], she appointed Eltro Miresk as its first Magus Senior, and his original school became a part of the larger institution.",
