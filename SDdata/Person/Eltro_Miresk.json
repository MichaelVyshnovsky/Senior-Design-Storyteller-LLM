        "mainbody": "Eltro Miresk was the founder of a school of magic and the first Magus Senior of the Conclave of Silverymoon.\nMiresk was tall and lean and liked to wear black robes. Wherever he went, he was followed by a set of three floating magical rods, which his students named \"The Triad\".\nEltro Miresk was haughty, but he was also a superb teacher. Miresk believed in balance and taught that magic use should be tempered with other natural forces. He encouraged the creative use of simpler \"everyday\" spells over reckless use of the more powerful ones.\nMiresk was an exceptionally powerful mage with a vast array of spells at his disposal. He was also particularly skilled in alchemy, arcana and spellcraft, and the knowledge of history. He knew a good deal about nature, religion, and the planes of existence as well.\n\"The Triad\" was said by his students to provide the Magus Senior with the powers of several ioun stones in addition to acting like a rod of negation and a source of limitless unseen servant, hold portal, and hold monster spells. Miresk could use any of these powers without actually having to make contact with the floating Triad.\nMiresk founded a school of magic from his home in Silverymoon, named Miresks School of Thaumaturgy. When High Lady Alustriel founded the Conclave of Silverymoon in 1369 DR, she appointed Eltro Miresk as its first Magus Senior, and his original school became a part of the larger institution.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryInhabitants of Miresks School of Thaumaturgy\nCategoryInhabitants of Southbank\nCategoryInhabitants of Silverymoon\nCategoryInhabitants of Luruar\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryTeachers\nl1i7cnot8bnrjvqnwbiyybssfwzo91g"
