'''Hoytir''' was a young stablehand who worked for the noble [[House Pharaboldi]] until his death in [[1373 DR]].

==Description==
Hoytir was a good man by all accounts. Despite what his murderers claimed, Hoytir was not courting [[Jithelle Skolotti]], a maid from the same noble house who was killed alongside him.

==History==
On [[Tarsakh 10]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Hoytir and Jithelle were murdered at an alley in [[Arrabar]] by Captain [[Dressus]] and men dressed as the [[Municipal Guard of Arrabar]]. The killers drew three blue circles on the young people's foreheads, framing them to have claimed to be [[wizard]]s â€“ a crime punishable by death. Their murder was ordered by a sneak coin cabal between Pharaboldi, [[Matrell]], [[Talricci]], and the corrupt Grand Trabbar [[Lavant]] of the [[Church of Waukeen]]. The young woman bedded [[Denrick Pharaboldi]], a scion of a merchant who had his eyes on marriage to a daughter of house Matrell. A bastard child was an inconvenience. Jithelle and Hoytir were reported to be a couple, and their bodies were cremated to stop the real Guard of Arrabar from magically interrogating the victims as per the procedure.

Justice was brought to Hoytir's name by [[Vambran Matrell]] who successfully investigated the murder he accidentally witnessed.
