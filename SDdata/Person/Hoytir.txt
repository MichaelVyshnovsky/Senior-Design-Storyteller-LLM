Hoytir was a young stablehand who worked for the noble House Pharaboldi until his death in 1373 DR.
Hoytir was a good man by all accounts. Despite what his murderers claimed, Hoytir was not courting Jithelle Skolotti, a maid from the same noble house who was killed alongside him.
On Tarsakh 10 of the , Hoytir and Jithelle were murdered at an alley in Arrabar by Captain Dressus and men dressed as the Municipal Guard of Arrabar. The killers drew three blue circles on the young peoples foreheads, framing them to have claimed to be wizards â€“ a crime punishable by death. Their murder was ordered by a sneak coin cabal between Pharaboldi, Matrell, Talricci, and the corrupt Grand Trabbar Lavant of the Church of Waukeen. The young woman bedded Denrick Pharaboldi, a scion of a merchant who had his eyes on marriage to a daughter of house Matrell. A bastard child was an inconvenience. Jithelle and Hoytir were reported to be a couple, and their bodies were cremated to stop the real Guard of Arrabar from magically interrogating the victims as per the procedure.
Justice was brought to Hoytirs name by Vambran Matrell who successfully investigated the murder he accidentally witnessed.
