'''Goldy''' was one of the [[horse]]s that belonged to the noble [[Pharaboldi]] family of [[Arrabar]] ''circa'' [[1373 DR]].

==Description==
Goldy was a gentle and smaller horse with a palamino coat, a tan-golden color.

==History==
Goldy and the other Pharaboldi horses were cared for by [[Turcan]], the family's stablemaster. In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Goldy was [[saddle]]d up to be ridden by [[Emriana Matrell]], the unwilling object of [[Denrick Pharaboldi]]'s affections. The young couple was to take a ride around the Pharaboldi family estate and partake in a picnic.
