Dhamir led the Second Banedeath in Darkhold, purging all non-Cyric followers. Impressed, Sememmon offered Dhamir command of the keep, which he quickly accepted, becoming the leader of the Cyricist Zhents there. But Dhamirs aims were greater he wanted to assume control of the Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse and use them to advance in the Zhent hierarchy. He also started plotting an evil crusade against eastern powers like Mulhorand and Iyachtu Xvim.
