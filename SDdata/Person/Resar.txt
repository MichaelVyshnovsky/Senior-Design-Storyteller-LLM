'''Resar''' was a [[wizard]] of [[Halruaa]] who lived during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was a rather unscrupulous individual and was not above killing those he perceived as "loose ends" with regards to his goals.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Resar traveled to [[Baldur's Gate]] to find and recover a crashed [[Halruaan Skyship]]. Some of the items that were essential to their construction had been recovered by the mage [[Shandalar]] and his daughters.

Resar and his fellow Halruaans did not want the secret of their creation to leak to the rest of the Realms. He worked alongside [[Alatos Thuibuld|"Ravenscar" Thuibuld]] and his thieves' guild in order to complete his mission.
