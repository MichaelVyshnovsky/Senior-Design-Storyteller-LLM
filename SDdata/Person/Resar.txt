Resar was a wizard of Halruaa who lived during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He was a rather unscrupulous individual and was not above killing those he perceived as "loose ends" with regards to his goals.
In the , Resar traveled to Baldurs Gate to find and recover a crashed Halruaan Skyship. Some of the items that were essential to their construction had been recovered by the mage Shandalar and his daughters.
Resar and his fellow Halruaans did not want the secret of their creation to leak to the rest of the Realms. He worked alongside "Ravenscar" Thuibuld and his thieves guild in order to complete his mission.
