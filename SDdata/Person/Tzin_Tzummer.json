He owned at least a sword, boots, and a night robe.\nHe helped in the day-to-day rule of the realm. Possibly, more than that. He also served as a Herald.\nWhen Shandril, Mirt, and Narm Tamaraith arrived at Eveningstar in the , they were rebuffed by the guards at the door of Tessarils Tower Tzin joined the guards shortly after noticing the commotion through his window. He tried to convince the interlopers to spend the night at a tavern instead and come back in the morning. Mirt instead proved himself to be a Harper and bore King Azoun IVs favor, but before Tzin could decide what to do with them, Tessaril herself came down to let them all in."
