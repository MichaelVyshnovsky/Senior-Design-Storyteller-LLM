'''Velasta T'sarran''' was a [[drow]] [[cleric]] of [[Kiaransalee]] and one of the twin nieces of [[Dorina T'sarran]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
A strongly built female drow, Velasta had a rounder face than most other drow. She wore darkened drow [[chainmail]] and wrapped herself in a large black cloak. A prominent symbol of Kiaransalee was often displayed around her neck. Velasta appeared identical in practically every way to her sister, [[Velina T'sarran|Velina]].

==Personality==
Velasta T'sarran was a drow of erratic moods, alternating between haughty and charming when dealing with others. However, she harbored nothing but contempt for her twin sister.

==Abilities==
An experienced drow cleric, Velasta had a solid command of [[divine magic]] and was able to cast spells like ''[[flame strike]]'' and ''[[slay living]]'' in defense of her deity. In addition to this, she could craft both [[magic]]al arms and armor, and magic [[wand]]s.

Velasta, like her sister, was an adaptive combatant and could adjust her tactics effectively when given the opportunity or when prepared.

==Possessions==
As a member of [[House T'sarran]], Velasta was outfitted with gear befitting a priestess of her station. She wore a [[magic]] set of ''[[elven chain|drow chain]]'', a ''[[cloak of resistance]]'' and ''[[ring of counterspells]]''. In combat, she would wield a ''[[Corrosive (weapon quality)|corrosive]] [[dagger]]'' and an [[magic|enchanted]] [[shield]]. In addition, after the plundering of [[Szith Morcane]], she managed to acquire a number of caches of [[Lolth]]ite treasure that she stored in her room.

==Relationships==
Velasta had a deep rivalry with her identical twin sister, Velina T'sarran, to the extent that both of them would happily engineer situations where the other could be "accidentally" killed off. This hatred was only exacerbated after the coup of Szith Morcane when Velasta acquired the larger share of the plunder.

==History==
As a female of House T'sarran, Velasta had been schooled as a [[cleric]] of Kiaransalee along with her identical twin sister, Velina. However, over the years, both sisters had developed an abiding hatred for each other. In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, during the [[Silence of Lolth]], Velasta and her sister worked with the rest of their house in overthrowing the Lolth-worshiping drow of [[Maerimydra]]. Subsequently, they were sent to track down any refugees from the city under the supervision of their aunt, Dorina T'sarran, and made their way to the drow outpost of [[Szith Morcane]].

While her sister was assigned to the raiding parties by Dorina, Velasta was made part of a hunter-killer team of drow that was only assembled to deal with true threats to Szith Morcane.

At some point after [[Marpenoth 27]], a group of adventurers launched a raid on Szith Morcane, Velasta and Velina were defeated but subsequently raised as [[undead]] [[revenant]]s.

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Velasta sought vengeance against Archmage [[Solom Ned'razak]], who had arranged the deaths of her and her sister. Velasta tried to profit off the [[fire giant]]s' invasion to take control of the outpost but undeath gave her was patience and she had no need to hurry.{{Cite adventurers league/Szith Morcane Unbound|17}}
