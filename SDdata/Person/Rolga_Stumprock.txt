'''Rolga Stumprock''', also known as the defender of the [[Great Hall]], was a revered [[dwarf]] of [[Myth Drannor]] who died long before the advent of the [[Weeping War]].

==Possessions==
Rolga was the owner of the unique [[enchanted]] [[short sword]] called the ''[[Shadowhisper]]''.

==History==
Rolga Stumprock was interred within an interconnected series of dwarven tombs in the lowest level of the [[Elven Catacombs]] of Myth Drannor. The entrance to the tombs was indicated by a sign, engraved in languages of dwarves, humans, and elves, that read "Last Repose of the Stout Folk of Myth Drannor". These tombs were protected by [[iron golem|dwarven statues]] and the spirits of its inhabitants that were ready to destroy anyone who tried to claim the enchanted arms laid within the tombs, without paying the levy first.
