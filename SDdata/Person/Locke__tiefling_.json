He was outcast from his city following after it was briefly pulled down into the [[Nine Hells]], and forced to find new home elsewhere.\n\n{{Quote|Arabella tried to steal their idol. Druids lost their damn minds about it - they need it for their precious ritual|Komira, while trying to save her daughter.}}",
        "Description": "He had pink-red skin and medium brown hair..",
        "Relationships": "Locke and his partner [[Komira]] had a daughter named [[Arabella]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Elturian tieflings were forced out of the city as refugees, forced to find a new home somewhere on the [[Sword Coast]]. They were fortunate to find temporary safe haven at the [[Emerald Grove]], by grace of Master [[Halsin]]. That security was ended however when a druid named [[Kagha]] tried to seal away the grove from the tieflings, by means of a [[Rite of Thorns|ritual]].\n\nWhile at druidic enclave, Locke and Komira's daughter Arabella tried to steal the ''[[idol of Silvanus]]'' from the druids, in order to nullify the ritual. Arabella was taken by Kagha and her allies, and forced to answer for her misdeed. Locke, Komira, and several other tieflings tried to take Arabella back, but were unsuccessful, and turned away by druids of the enclave."
