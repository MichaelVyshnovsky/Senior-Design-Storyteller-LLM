        "mainbody": "'''Zarys''' was the leader of the [[Zhentarim]] operating out of a [[Zhentarim hideout (Risen Road)|hideout]] beneath the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|You're dead the moment you steal from the Zhentarim. No matter who you are.|Zarys.}}",
        "Activities": "{{Quote|If you've got coin to spend and problems to solve, the Zhent will relieve you of both.|Zarys, on whether her organization were merchants or mercenaries.}}\n\nZarys oversaw her group as they smuggled and sold illicit goods from their hideout. She allowed them to dabble in other income streams such as kidnapping and potential ransom of captives.",
        "Relationships": "She was brought into the Zhentarim by her fellow agent [[Rugan]], but eventually rose above him within the organization's hierarchy.",
        "History": "When Grand Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]] was abducted from Waukeen's Rest in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Zarys ordered her men to prepare for the demolition of their underground hideout. She knew that Baldurian authorities would have to blame someone for the Duke's disappearance and would not allow Zhentarim operations to be compromised.\n\nAt the same time she was coordinating the special delivery of a sealed strongbox to some unidentified noble in [[Baldur's Gate]]. For the survival of her group it was imperative that the packed not be opened and [[iron flask|its contents]] removed."
