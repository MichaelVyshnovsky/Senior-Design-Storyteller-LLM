'''Lefty''' was a left-handed [[orc]] gladiator who fought in the [[Arena (Hillsfar)|Arena of Hillsfar]].

==Description==
The Hillsfar arena was divided into levels of prowess, and Lefty was declared the best of the lowest level. Though he only championed the first level of the arena, he was said to be strong, and did not shy away from a fight. His fighting tactics were to drop his guard and then strike from the left almost all of the time.

==History==
Lefty fought in the arena ''circa'' [[1358 DR]]. He was defeated by numerous adventurers, such as [[Granite (dwarf)|Granite]]. [[Mhai Prittee]] had once been fooled by a fellow mage, [[Wak Rathar]], who teleported him into the arena, only to be knocked out by Lefty's quick quarterstaff strike.
