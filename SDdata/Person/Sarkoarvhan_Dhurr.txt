Sarkoarvhan Dhurr was a clerk and author who lived in Tethyr in the 14 century DR.
Sarkoarvhan was a mild-mannered and shy man.
Sarkoarvhan worked as a clerk in Tethyr, enduring the treatment of cruel and pompous masters and clients. Unable to contain himself any longer, he poured his feelings and experiences into writing the novel Arauntril Lady Death, Lady Flame. The biting and lurid prose proved extremely popular across the Heartlands, leading to an anonymous author creating the even more extreme sequel Arauntril Scourged. Although he was initially greatly upset by the imitation, once Dhurr had the chance to read it he found it quite delightful.
