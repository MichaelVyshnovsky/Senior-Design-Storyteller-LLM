'''Sarkoarvhan Dhurr''' was a clerk and author who lived in [[Tethyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Sarkoarvhan was a mild-mannered and shy man.

==History==
Sarkoarvhan worked as a clerk in Tethyr, enduring the treatment of cruel and pompous masters and clients. Unable to contain himself any longer, he poured his feelings and experiences into writing the novel ''[[Arauntril: Lady Death, Lady Flame]]''. The biting and lurid prose proved extremely popular across the [[Heartlands]], leading to an anonymous author creating the even more extreme sequel ''[[Arauntril Scourged]]''. Although he was initially greatly upset by the imitation, once Dhurr had the chance to read it he found it quite delightful.
