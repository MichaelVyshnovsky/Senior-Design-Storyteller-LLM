Nabil al-Rashad was a horse trader who lived in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Though he did not own a stall or stable, Nabil could be found nearly everywhere within Huzuz selling horses. The quality of his stock ranged from poor to excellent, but the vast majority of them were stolen. He catered to questionable clientele.
Many of his clients rode out from Huzuz only to encounter a group of desert riders who were eager to retrieve their property. These customers typically did not survive long enough to return to Huzuz and complain to Nabil.
