Guffaw Gravelstock, or Guffaw the Stone Eater, was a deep gnome transmuted by Arcturia in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR, Guffaw was plucked by Arcturia from his Underdark mine and taken to Arcturiadoom, where she altered him to possess a voracious appetite for worked and carved stone. He felt wholly compelled to eat any such stone he encountered and had to limit how much he could devour.
