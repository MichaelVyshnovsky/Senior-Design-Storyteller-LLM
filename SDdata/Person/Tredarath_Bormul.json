        "mainbody": "\"King\" Tredarath Bormul was Tethyrian prince who perished during a period of royal infighting and intrigue in the 10 century DR.\nTredarath was the son of King Teremir I of the House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul, with an elder brother and a sister whose names were lost to history.\nWhen Mhoaran set about slaying the members of the Queens Dynasty in the , Prince Tredarath plundered a royal vault and fled with his followers. Seeking to either found a new realm far to the north, or raise a rebellion against his murderous cousin, his retinue passed through the swamps at the mouth of the Winding Water near Lathtarls Lantern but got lost in a fog bank. Weighed down with all the royal regalia and treasure, Tredarath and his hundred-strong band of armsmen drowned in the water and quicksand while being assailed by the hungry denizens of the swamp, never to be seen again. The only traces of the lost king-to-be were the occasional coins and a jeweled dagger found by local residents, and a gold crown seen worn by a lizardman."
