        "mainbody": "'''Ilhundyl''', known as '''the Mad Mage''', was a powerful [[wizard]] of the early 3{{rd}} century [[DR]] who briefly ruled the [[Calishar Emirates]] and was considered one of the most notorious and deadly wizards of his age.{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|31,34}}",
        "History": "Formerly of the city of [[Volothamp]] in [[Calimshan]], then part of the [[Shoon Empire]], Ilhundyl conducted terrible experiments and openly summoning and dealing with [[demon]]s from the [[Abyss]], which he proved unable or unwilling to control. Soon, the [[Calishite]] satraps could no longer overlook this, especially after they learned he was using the fiends to kill them.\n\nThe Mad Mage wiped out a number of [[Tethyrian]] garrisons in the [[Tejarn Hills]] the [[224 DR|following year]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|231}}, Ilhundyl conquered the largest settlement of the newly established [[halfling]] realm of [[Meiritin]]. He then named himself ruler of the Calishar Emirates. The Shoon Empire was unable to send an immediate military response because of low-level unrest in the south of the empire near [[Shoonach]]. He reign as a cruel sorcerer-tyrant from his so-called [[Castle of Sorcery]] and dominated the land within his magic, and countless people fled north in fear of his magic.\n\nHaving been told by Lord Mage [[Dunsteen]] that Ilhundyl was the best living source of knowledge on the working of [[magic]], [[Elminster Aumar]], then known as Elmara, at the beginning of the young wizard's career, visited him at his Castle of Sorcery. She effortlessly passed through his maze of [[illusion|illusory walls]] and ''[[portal]]'' traps, pits, and worse, and impressed the Mad Mage enough to grant her an audience. Ilhundyl bade her to grow powerful and quest for and then sacrifice [[Ondil]]'s ''[[Book of Spells]]'', while arranging for her death. However, thanks to the intervention of [[Mystra]] herself, Elminster survived Ilhundyl's trap and the Mad Mage received a blank [[spellbook]].\n\nYears later, Elminster, now a powerful wizard, decided to begin his campaign against evil wizards by facing Ihundyl. Confronting him in the summer of the {{YearlinkName|238}}, they fought a terrible battle; Elminster won but only with the help of his tutor, [[Myrjala Talithyn]], who killed Ilhundyl with her ''[[spellfire]]'' to rescue him.",
        "Personality": "He was called the Mad Mage because he had strange whims and pursued them vigorously, heedless of whatever and whoever he destroyed in the process.{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|35}} He obsessively valued his life and privacy against all those who sought to stop him."
