Cecil Proudfoot was a halfling who lived on the Sword Coast North during the late 15 century DR.
He spent some of his time at the Broken Crown inn, located along the High Road north of Neverwinter.
When Neverwinter was being rebuilt in the 1470s DR, following the cataclysmic eruption of Mount Hotenow in the , numerous bands of halflings made their way to the city. Unfortunately many of the halfling caravans were assaulted by bandits and their belongings were scattered across the High Road.
To aid his fellow Hin, in the , Cecil identified the sites of recent attacks and sought out a fellow halfling adventurer to recover the supplies and building materials left behind, including construction cobblestones, vittles, and barrels of some liquid for the Lionheart Clan. With these, halfling immigrants to Neverwinter would build new homes. Cecil even learned of a small band of displaced ghostwise halflings, led by Gilern Ghostwise, and had the adventurer find them so they could help each other against local marauders.
