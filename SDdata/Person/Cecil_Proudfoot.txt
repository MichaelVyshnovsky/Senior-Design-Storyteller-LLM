'''Cecil Proudfoot''' was a [[halfling]] who lived on the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
He spent some of his time at the [[Broken Crown]] inn, located along the [[High Road]] north of [[Neverwinter]].

==History==
When Neverwinter was being rebuilt in the 1470s DR, following the cataclysmic eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] in the {{Yearlink|1451}}, numerous bands of halflings made their way to the city. Unfortunately many of the halfling caravans were assaulted by bandits and their belongings were scattered across the High Road.

To aid his fellow [[Hin]], in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Cecil identified the sites of recent attacks and sought out a fellow halfling [[adventurer]] to recover the supplies and building materials left behind, including construction cobblestones, vittles, and [[barrel]]s of some liquid for the [[Lionheart Clan]]. With these, halfling immigrants to Neverwinter would build new homes. Cecil even learned of a small band of displaced [[ghostwise halfling]]s, led by [[Gilern Ghostwise]], and had the adventurer find them so they could help each other against local marauders.
