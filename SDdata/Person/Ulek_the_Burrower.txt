Ulek the Burrower was a goblin sapper who served the Legion of the Chimera in the early 14 century DR.
In the , the town of Targos in Icewind Dale became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legions surprise attacks involved teleporting a troop of goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. A group of goblin sappers made it into the basement of one of the warehouses in the docks, led by Ulek the Burrower. Once inside, a goblin leader named Rukwurm, used a magic scroll provided by Phaen of the Rags that transported more goblins into Targos. Eventually, a group of adventurers from Luskan discovered the collapsed smugglers tunnels and disposed of both goblin leaders while slaughtering their marauding troops.
