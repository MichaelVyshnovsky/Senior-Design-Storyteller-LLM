'''Maestro Zalan''' was a fencing teacher of [[Lyrabar]] in [[Impiltur]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/The Rage||12}}

After [[Taegan Nightwind]]'s academy was burned down by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, he immediately began talking to [[Stedd]], Taegan's provost, despite it being very early in the morning of [[Ches 13]]. The [[avariel]] suspected that Zalan was attempting to hire Stedd to be his provost, and thought that the latter might have to disclose their secrets; he briefly considered issuing a challenge to Zalan, but was talked out of it by [[Corkaury Mindle]].
