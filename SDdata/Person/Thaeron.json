        "mainbody": "'''Thaeron''' (also known later as '''Durthar Morgath''') was a swordmaster who was employed by Lord [[Elmaer Oraun]] of [[Harrowdale]] during his reign for around five years between 1175 and 1185 DR (sources are not precise with dates). He died in the [[second inter-dale war]] in [[1356 DR]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/Harrowdale}}",
        "History": "During the reign of Elmaer Oraun over Harrowdale, Thaeron was swordmaster. He disappeared, along with Elmaer and Elmaer's son Eramonn, during the [[Battle of Marak's Stile]], in which [[Halvan the Dark]] seized control of Harrowdale, and it was rumoured that elven magic had prevented their deaths.\n\nSome fifty years later, traders reported seeing Thaeron along with Elmaer Oraun in [[Elventree]], escorting an elven \"great lady\", appearing not to have aged at all.\n\nIn [[1351 DR]], \"fey blue mage-fire\" was seen above a farm on a hill in Harrowdale, owned by three brothers, Torstan, Ulbaern and Durthar Morgath from [[Sembia]]. The next morning, the wizard [[Arauntan of Selgaunt]] reports that despite the brothers walking and talking in the same way, their appearances had become those of Erammon Oraun, Elmaer Oraun, and Thaeron.\n\nIn [[1356 DR]], during the [[second inter-dale war]], Thaeron, or Durthar Morgath, depending on which account is to be believed, rallied troops from northern Harrowdale, before declaring himself \"Thaeron, Rightful Swordmaster of Harrowdale\", and was killed in the battle."
