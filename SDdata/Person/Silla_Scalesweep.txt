'''Silla Scalesweep''' was a [[halfling]] fisherwoman from [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She later moved to the town of [[Leilon]], which was being rebuilt.

==Description==
Silla was a young, highly chatty halfling woman with lengthy braided hair. She was proficient with the harmonica and enjoyed performing in front of an audience.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], Silla traveled from Neverwinter to Leilon in the hopes of being hired as a fisher by [[Valdi Estapaar]], the town's fisheries overseer. On her way, she stayed at the [[Wayside Inn]] and accidentally witnessed an [[undead]] attack. The undead had been created by a cult of [[Myrkul]]. A group of [[adventurers]] was able to defend the inn against the attack. Silla then accompanied the adventurers on their way to Leilon.
