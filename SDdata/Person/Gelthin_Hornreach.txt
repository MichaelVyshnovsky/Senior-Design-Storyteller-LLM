Before becoming the Magister, Gelthin was a backstreet potion brewer and amulet constructor in Calimshan.

Before becoming the Magister, Gelthin was a backstreet potion brewer and amulet constructor in Calimshan, born in the Sword Coast north. After being offered the position by Azuth, he moved back to the Sword Coast north, where he took residence in a ruin of an abandoned empire, striking a deal with a local vampire.
He took the magic of those whom the vampire killed, and experimented with it, looking to create spells which could be boosted by wearing certain magical amulets. Though he kept clear records, he achieved little and spread nothing before he was caught unaware by Hortil Droone and promptly slain without delay.
Many believed Gelthins hideout was actually inhabited by a lich, including the one that eventually slew him.
