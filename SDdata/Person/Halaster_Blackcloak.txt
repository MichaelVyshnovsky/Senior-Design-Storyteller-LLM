'''Halaster Blackcloak''' (formerly '''Hilather Blackcloak''' {{Pronounce|HILL|a|thur|refs={{Cite adventurers league/A Wrinkle in the Weave|12}}}}) was a notorious, ancient, and utterly insane [[wizard]] who resided within his lair, the infamous [[Undermountain]].

==Personality==
Halaster seemed, in a word, insane. He muttered and chuckled to himself ceaselessly and had difficulty holding the thread of any conversation or debate for very long. Nevertheless, he remained fully aware of threats and hazards, and reacted and defended himself with great speed and efficiency. While in Undermountain, he had only rare moments of lucidity, but if he was ever outside the dungeon, he became lucid for much of the time.

At these times, Halaster was cold, well-mannered, and dignified and fastidious and meticulous in his habits, though still thoroughly evil. He did not tolerate any insult or insolence in any case and remembered any offense or help given his way. He pushed to have his own way in all things, heedless of the havoc or harm done to others in the way.

His main hobbies were collecting new monsters and kinds of [[magic]]. However, having lived for millennia, he finds very little that he hasn't seen before. Thus, until such things came along, Halaster meddled in politics and goings-on in the world according to his whims for his own entertainment.

He was more gregarious as a young man, creating and hosting [[magefair]]s and [[spellmoot]]s, and taking many apprentices. However, as his power grew, he dealt more and more with beings from other [[planes]], which led to his growing madness.

==Abilities==
As a mighty [[archmage]], Halaster Blackcloak had a vast array of spells and magical powers at his command. Among them, he could make use of ''[[contingency]]'' spells and [[clone]]s of himself to ensure his survival in any spell-battle.

Inside Undermountain, he could command all kinds of [[construct]]s, including [[crawling claw]]s, [[helmed horror]]s, and various [[golem]]s. He also made use of its countless traps and surprises, such as a "moving [[portal]]" that could pick up either himself or his victims and deposit them somewhere else.

In addition to his great magical prowess, Halaster was well-versed in many areas, from [[gem]]-cutting to engineering to the breeding, care, and containment of monsters, both alive and undead, particularly from those hailing from other [[plane]]s.

==Possessions==
As well as Undermountain itself, Halaster owns hundreds of [[magic item]]s, some quite powerful, which were hidden in caches throughout Undermountain. However, he was known to always wear a ''[[ring of protection]] +5'', a ''[[ring of regeneration]]'', and/or a ''[[horned ring]]''; a ''[[robe of eyes]]''; and up to twenty [[Animated object|flying]] ''+1 [[dagger]]s''.

==Activities==
He was said to be often "hidden in the walls" of Undermountains, namely his own private network of secret passages there.

Halaster was serious about the game [[nine-pin]], which he played in a private room of the [[Growling Groghouse]], a tavern deep in Undermountain.{{Cite adventurers league/Last Orders at the Yawning Portal|29}}

==History==
===Hilather of Imaskar===
History does not record where and when Halaster hailed from, and it was only suspected that he was older than [[Elminster]].

In fact, he was named Hilather and came from the [[Raurin]] in the [[Imaskari Empire]] during its Late period (from {{Yearlink|-3920}}). A young prodigy, Hilather rose to become one of the foremost [[archwizard]]s of the empire. When the fellow Imaskari mage [[Madryoch|Madryoch the Ebon Flame]] created the [[Shadow Stone]] and plotted to take over the empire, the heroic young Hilather went to the fortress of [[Metos]], challenged Madryoch, and finally bound him within the [[Demiplane of Imprisonment]], thus saving Imaskar. He became Lord Hilather, and an [[Artificer (Imaskari)|Imaskari artificer]].

However, during the ultimate fall of Imaskar in {{Yearlink|-2488}}, Hilather escaped to a secret Imaskari stronghold concealed deep under Imaskar's [[Giant's Belt Mountains|western mountains]] and entered a ''[[temporal stasis]]''.

Eventually, Hilather emerged from the temporal stasis and began to explore [[Faer√ªn]]. In the {{YearlinkName|128}}, after arriving in the [[Shoon Imperium]], Hilather was hired by the Imperial Court to research a more secure means of binding [[fiend]]s to obey their summoners. Hilathar based himself in the remote emirate of [[Torsil]], which lay on the [[Sword Coast]] north of the [[Cloud Peaks]], where he worked from an abandoned tower. [[132 DR|Four years later]], Hilather delivered the thirteen ''[[Demonshield]]s'' to [[Qysar]] [[Amahl Shoon IV]], then disappeared.)

It's thought Hilather changed his name to Halaster in the belief it would sound grander and more appropriate for a great mage.

===Halaster of Waterdeep===
In the {{YearlinkName|168}}, a mage calling himself Halaster Blackcloak and only later realized to be Hilather, arrived at the foot of [[Mount Waterdeep]] together with his apprentices, collectively called "[[Seven|The Seven]]". In the center of the Deepwater Plateau, northwest of the flourishing seaside farms, Halaster began construction of [[Halaster's Hold]] with a tower and fortified ramparts, with smaller towers for his apprentices. He summoned fell beings from other [[plane]]s to do the work. But Halaster refused to release the creatures after they constructed his Hold, instead sending them into the caverns to build more and more subterranean chambers. Later sages believed his association with such creatures had corrupted him, causing him to grow in power but also in madness.

Soon, he claimed the [[Underhalls]] of the [[Clan Melairkyn]] and started to explore. Meanwhile, the Seven desired to establish their own subterranean holdings and departed Halaster's Hold in the {{YearlinkName|307}}. They left it abandoned and the people of the surface settlement, then known as Blackcloak Hold, shunned it in a belief it was cursed.

By [[309 DR]], Halaster had complete control over the near-endless tunnels and caverns, having exterminated their denizens, and began constructing the largest and most deadly dungeon imaginable, Undermountain. By that time, Halaster had become completely mad and wanted nothing to do with the outside world. He left his hold to live in Undermountain itself, allowing the keep to fall into ruin. Several of his apprentices came looking for him; he slew two before demanding the rest help him fortify his dungeon even more. One refused and managed to escape: [[Jhesiyra Kestellharp]], who would later become [[Magister]] and would provide what little was known about Halaster, the Mad Mage. 

Centuries later, in the {{YearlinkName|668}}, a number of mages from across [[Cormanthyr]] and especially in [[Myth Drannor]] started to vanish, the cause unknown. The only sign was visible portals in Myth Drannor crackling and flashing blue lightning. This was the work of Halaster, now kidnapping mages at random and banished them into the Underhalls. After ten years of this, the [[Guild of Naturalists]] realized Halaster was behind it and it was payback for their collection of monsters from Undermountain. Their rescue mission does not come back. They give up their expeditions, but fail to destroy the portal linking their [[guildhall]] and Undermountain.

By the early 11{{th}} century DR, the now city of Waterdeep had expanded to encompass the ruins of Halaster's Hold. In the {{YearlinkName|1007}}, [[Ahghairon]] cast magical wards on the ruins to stop its hazards getting out into the city.

===Modern History===
On [[Higharvestide]] of the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], two members of the [[Twisted Rune]] managed to kidnap Halaster Blackcloak from inside Undermountain. The [[lich]] [[Priamon "Frostrune" Rakesk]] and the [[alhoon]] [[Ralayan|Ralayan the Ocultacle]] used a ''[[ring of multiple wishes]]'' to summon the Mad Mage to [[Stardock]] where they could scrape the secrets of Undermountain from his mind. Halaster's kidnapping allowed the madness of the dungeon to escape in a chaotic event known as [[Halaster's Higharvestide]]. ''[[Gate]]s'' began randomly transporting creatures from Undermountain to places throughout the Realms, causing havoc and destruction everywhere. A group of adventurers hired by the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] managed to reach Stardock and free Halaster. The Mad Mage immediately returned to Undermountain, which quelled the chaos of the dungeon and ended the terror of Higharvestide.

While tainted by the goddess [[Shar]] in 1369 DR, Halaster plotted to steal the secret of ''[[silver fire]]'' from the goddess [[Mystra]] and her [[Chosen]], using [[drow]] and the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]]. This was foiled by the [[Seven Sisters]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, [[Elminster]] was inadvertently sent to the [[Nine Hells]] while defending the [[Dalelands]] from the [[Shadovar]]. [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] made a bargain with Halaster that she would try to cure his insanity if he rescued Elminster from Hell. Halaster agreed, and entered [[Avernus]]. Though he was unsuccessful, and had to be rescued in turn by [[Alassra Silverhand]], Mystra kept her word, and managed to partially cure him. She then proceeded to blast [[Asmodeus]] with Halaster's insanity.<ref>

===Death===
Shortly after dawn on [[Eleint 30]], the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, an earthquake struck Waterdeep. Though the city suffered little damage, many people there saw visions of Halaster screaming, his eyes ablaze with rage, sorrow, and swimming stars. Arcane [[magic]] users who saw the visions also reported scenes of destruction in the vast maze of Undermountain: pillars cracking and crumbling, chasms and rifts opening, and explosions of sparks. Those brave enough to investigate quickly discovered that Halaster had inadvertently killed himself while attempting a powerful ritual; as he died, he hurled desperate visions and compulsions to people all across the [[Faer√ªn|continent]].

===Return===
In fact, Halaster's ritual had not slain the Mad Mage, but instead scattered his essence across the planes, with the influence of the [[Spellplague]] preventing it from being reformed within one of his clones hidden in Undermountain.{{Cite dragon/409/Character Themes: Citizens of Splendor|3-5}}

After the [[Second Sundering]] in the 1480s DR, with the Spellplague finally ended and magic restored to its former stability, Halaster was able to recorporate himself and returned to Undermountain, resuming his normal activities as if he had never been gone.{{speculation}}

==Relationships==
===Halaster's Apprentices===
Several of Halaster's apprentices became extremely powerful in their own right, though all would become infected with his madness.
* [[Shradin Mulophor]]: Shradin was a powerful [[Netherese]] [[necromancer]] who'd survived the [[Netheril#The Fall|collapse of his civilization]]. In [[1148 DR]], he learned of [[Sargauth Enclave]] and petitioned to become an apprentice to the Mad Mage. Halaster agreed and also allowed him to take the Enclave as his own. Shradin, calling himself the "Lord of Bones", turned the Enclave into [[Skullport]], a neutral way-station in the [[Underdark]], permanently linking Undermountain to the [[Underdark]].
* [[Trobriand]]: Called "the Metal Mage", Trobriand had a gift for building metal [[construct]]s and monstrosities.
* [[Muiral]]: Called "the Misshapen", Muiral was originally a great warrior who served as Halaster's bodyguard. He later became an apprentice to the Mad Mage and used his power to augment his considerable strength and fighting prowess. Finally, as the madness of Undermountain overcame him, he grafted his body onto a [[giant scorpion]].<ref>
* [[Arcturia]]: Much like Muiral, Arcturia's madness led her to experiment with bodies, both hers and others. Perhaps Halaster's most ambitious apprentice, she was known for her cruel experiments with [[polymorph]]ing others to suit her whims.
* [[Jhesiyra Kestellharp]]: For reasons unknown, Jhesiyra transformed herself into a living ''[[wish]]'' spell to escape from Halaster, but he brought her back to Undermountain. She later ruled over other [[living spell]]s in Undermountain's Citadel of the Bloody Hand. Driven half mad by her transformation, she rules over the living spells the Mad Mage forced her to create, and it is uncertain whether she is truly aware of Halaster's demise.
* [[Maerlyn]]: Otherwise lost to time and history, Maeryln was a human who specialized in absorption of arcane powers, memories, and souls. It was rumored that Halaster took her on because of her resistance to the [[Spellplague]] that he somehow knew was coming. She was consumed by her own experiments when she summoned a lifedrinker [[specter]] that drained away her memories and life-force and existed only as a [[ghost]].<ref>
* [[Ibbalar Thrul]]: A willing apprentice to the Mad Mage after becoming disgruntled and a pariah of Waterdeep.
* [[Nickademus]]: An arch-wizard architect responsible for the creation of a temple complex to [[Auril]] made entirely of ice in [[1312 DR]].

===Halaster's Heirs===
While the term "[[Halaster's Heirs]]" formerly referred to the surviving apprentices of Halaster, it later referred to an arcanist academy on the Dungeon Level of Undermountain formed by Trobriand and Muiral.

===Halaster's Clones===
As part of his many preparations to escape death, Halaster created a number of clone-bodies to receive his consciousness, which he kept locked in protective stasis and located throughout Undermountain and the lower reaches of Waterdeep. When Halaster died prior to the Spellplague, it was possible that one or more of these clones was activated and set free by [[1479 DR]], although this is not confirmed.

These clones could look very different to Halaster, with different ages, sexes, and species. Each could develop their own individual personality and abilities, but would have Halaster's mind occupying their subconscious, occasionally fighting for dominance over their body. They might have become [[adventurer]]s in hopes of finding some way to expel this shade of Halaster from their mind, while striving to preserve their individual existence.

A common trait of these clones was that, owing to the influence of the Spellplague upon the stasis magic that had preserved them, each had a unique relationship with time. The clones did not physically age, and were impressively resistant to diseases, growing more immune as they grew stronger. Those that developed their powers eventually gained limited abilities to manipulate time, a trait that manifested in unnatural speed and reflexes. More unusual manipulations of time were seen in the hands of some clones, but were not a universal power. Likewise, some clones displayed more resistance to mental assaults than others, which they attributed to the need to frequently engage in mental struggle with Halaster's mind within their own.

===Others===
Halaster, at some point, was close enough to [[Gale Dekarios]] that Gale asked Halaster to take care of his [[tressym]] [[familiar]] [[Tara]] in his absence during [[Absolute crisis|the events of 1492 DR]].<ref>
