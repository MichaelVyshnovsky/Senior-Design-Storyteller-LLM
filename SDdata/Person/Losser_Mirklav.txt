'''Losser Mirklav''' ({{Pronounce|LOSS|er|_|MER|klav|refs=}}) was a [[lightfoot halfling]] [[necromancer]] in [[Waterdeep]] during the early 1490s [[DR]].
 
==Activities==
Losser hid inside a closed shop in the [[Trades Ward of Waterdeep]].

==History==
In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} if the [[Xanathar]] managed to obtain the ''[[Stone of Golorr]]'', he entrusted the Stone to [[Grinda Garloth]]. She agreed to take custody of the Stone but changed her mind and decided to use it for herself, ordering her [[familiar]] to hide it.

By chance, Losser decided to raid the [[Grindoth]] mausoleum in the [[City of the Dead (Waterdeep)|City of the Dead]] and found the Stone. He hired [[Volkarr Kibbens]] and [[Urlaster Ghann]] in order to enter the City of the Dead.

However, Losser was easily found by some [[kenku]] agents of the [[Xanathar]].

==Relationship==
Losser had two [[human]] apprentices, [[Retchyn]] and [[Kreela]], who lived with him.
