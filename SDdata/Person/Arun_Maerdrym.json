He was a powerful mage.\nAruns wife was Arielimnda. His son was Khelben Arunsun.\nKhelben and his father did not have a close relationship. In fact, Arun had only seen Khelben nine times since his seventh birthday, and he rarely had much to say to him.\nAruns first wife Arielimnda was murdered by the vampire Palron Kaeth. He married a second time, to an elven woman,In the prologue of the novel Blackstaff, when Khelben mysteriously arrives to help his father defend his family from the phaerimm, Arun says, \"Calarel saw a reunion written in the stars today. What are you doing here, son?\" It is possible that Calarel is the name of his new elven wife. with whom he started a family.

Despite this, he was allowed to keep his elven family name.\nArun joined the Harpers in Twilight in .\nArun married fellow Harper, Arielimnda, who was a human ranger. In the , the two had a son. Since the boy was considered human, he was not permitted to take the Maerdrym name. Arun further decided to follow an ancient tradition by not giving him a first name either, instead giving him the freedom to choose his own name once he had earned it.\nArun was killed in 464 DR, while on a journey west across the Sword of Anauroch with his new elven family. While defending them from an ambush of phaerimm, he was joined by his son Khelben, who had been sent there by a dream from Mystra. While in combat with the phaerimm, they learned that the ambush was planned by Palron Kaeth, the vampire who had murdered Arielimnda. She somehow planned to use their blood to destroy the Sharnwall. Arun and his son were low on spells, and inside a protective sphere, they realized that the only way to stop the vampires plans was to sacrifice themselves. They shared a final moment, in which Arun told his son that he was proud of him and that he wished that he could have learned his name in that lifetime. Arun then struck the Duskstaff of Sarael with his former wifes Lupinaxe, killing them both—and presumably their foe—and transforming the surrounding desert into a crater of glass. Khelben would later be resurrected by Mystra to become a Chosen of Mystra, and he took the name of his father as his last name."
