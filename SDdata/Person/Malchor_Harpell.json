        "mainbody": "'''Malchor Harpell''' ({{Pronounce|MAL|core|_|HAR|pell|refs=}}) was a member of the [[Harpers]] that hailed from the [[Harpell]] family of [[Longsaddle]]. He resided in the [[Tower of Twilight]], which stood east of the [[Neverwinter Wood]].",
        "Personality": "Even though Malchor was [[Khelben Arunsun]]'s second-most powerful follower, other than [[Laeral Silverhand]], he was also the most skeptical of the [[Moonstars]].\n\nAlthough Malchor was a Harpell, he did not share the eccentric ways of his cousins and deigned to live away from Longsaddle.",
        "Abilities": "The wizard spent most of his time training other [[mage]]s along with researching magical items and their creation. Specifically, he mastered the art of crafting ''[[staff of the magi|staves of the magi]]'' and ''[[wand]]s of [[magic missile]]'', as well as ''[[ring]]s'' of ''[[feather fall]]'' and the ''[[ring of warmth]]''.",
        "Possessions": "Along with the items he regularly created, Malchor carried a ''[[lurker cloak]]'' and a ''+3 [[ring of protection]]'' when he traveled.",
        "Relationships": "As of the mid–1350s [[DR]], Malchor had a teenaged apprentice who was the son of wealthy family. Malchor made him take a vow of silence, which he believed would help teach him the discipline needed for his studies of magic.\n\nHe himself was a student of the first [[Blackstaff]], [[Khelben Arunsun]].",
        "History": "Malchor was a member of the [[Company of Crazed Venturers]].\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1356}}, Malchor gave the [[scimitar]] ''[[Twinkle]]'' to the renegade [[drow]] [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], '.\n\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1370}} he defected from the [[Harpers]] to the Moonstars.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] struck the Realms in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, Malchor and his tower disappeared from Neverwinter Wood. \n\n''Circa'' late [[1487 DR]], Malchor was alive and competed with other [[archmage]]s for the possession of the [[Lost Spell]] during a [[spellstorm]], as well as informing his fellow \"captive\" [[archwizard]]s that he currently was spending his efforts on securing the future of [[Faerûn]], through the making of strong family ties.",
        "Works": "Malchor wrote a book about Khelben and Laeral called ''[[Two Mages' Legacies]]''."
