Diaytha was a drow priestess who acted under the orders of the Bhaalspawn Sendai.
The drow captain fought with an array of spells as well as a highly enchanted darksteel shield and a drow full plate.
Diaytha was tasked with stopping Gorions Ward from reaching her mistress, at any cost. Sendai told her that if she did not complete this task, she would be killed by her hand. Diaytha challenged Gorions Ward to kill Ogremoch in combat. After the wards party was successful, she awaited them in the adjacent chamber. Diaytha had several allies under her command, including a hive mother, an abishai, and a vampire.
