'''Diaytha''' was a [[drow]] [[priestess]] who acted under the orders of the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Sendai]].

==Possessions==
The drow captain fought with an array of [[spell]]s as well as a highly enchanted [[darksteel]] [[shield]] and a drow [[full plate]].

==History==
Diaytha was tasked with stopping [[Gorion's Ward]] from reaching her mistress, at any cost. Sendai told her that if she did not complete this task, she would be killed by her hand. Diaytha challenged Gorion's Ward to kill [[Ogremoch]] in combat. After the ward's party was successful, she awaited them in the adjacent chamber. Diaytha had several allies under her command, including a [[hive mother]], an [[abishai]], and a [[vampire]].
