        "mainbody": "Asaudrae Daerantree was a human priestess of Mielikki who lived in Amphail on the Sword Coast North in the 11 century DR. She was the origin of the annual Rite of the Stag Lass celebrated in that village.\nThanks to a gift of Mielikki, Asaudrae had a special power to change into the form of a stag. (Some scholars tried to correct this to a doe, the female deer, but were mistaken.)\nShe spent many of her days in stag form, exploring the nearby forest and learning about its flora and fauna.,\nOne day, Asaudrae was surprised by ignorant nobles from Waterdeep on a hunting trip who shot and wounded her with their crossbow bolts and javelins. She fled back to the village with the hunters in pursuit. Local folklore maintained that the hunters continued to assail her even after she reverted to her injured human form, but the nobles denied any such knowledge of her true nature. Asaudrae stumbled into the Stag-Horned Flagon, bleeding from quarrels in her flesh and begging for help, but died on the bar just as the hunters arrived with knives drawn.\nEver since that day, according to the locals, the Rite of the Stag Lass was performed annually in some form or other. Some villagers and most Mielikkians believed that Asaudrae was the Lady of the Forest herself and that their settlement and the Stag-Horned Flagon were sacred to her."
