One year, a terrible plague ravaged the region, and his childhood sweetheart fell victim to the disease. Aventgar was outraged over the injustice of life and embarked on a path of becoming a paladin, thinking that if the universe was unjust, he would right it. He traveled from village to village performing good deeds, leaving people asking, \"who was that magnanimous man?\" in his wake.\nSometime in the 14 century DR, Aventgar Pureblade was among adventurers interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve an equally mysterious magical orb from its depths."
