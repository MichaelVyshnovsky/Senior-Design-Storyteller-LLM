        "mainbody": "adventurer\nUndevver Thort was a wizened retired adventurer turned shopkeeper, living in the city of Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.\nUndevver was known for having an odd sense of humor and a keen interest in new or strange artifacts. He especially took interest in any that had some sort of story attached to them.\nHe was regularly seen walking around with and leaning upon a cane, which some local rumors suggested was \"more than just a cane\".\nBeginning sometime after the rampage of the Walking Statues of Waterdeep in 1385 DR, Undevver lived in and ran the curios shop Thorts Findings out of the head of what once was the Walking Statue known as the Swordmaiden. He displayed the items in his shop with little placards written in his beautiful, flowing handwriting.\nUndevver was an ally of the Harpers organization. To aid their cause, he decked his shop out with hidden rooms to serve as safe-houses for Harper agents or Harper contacts."
