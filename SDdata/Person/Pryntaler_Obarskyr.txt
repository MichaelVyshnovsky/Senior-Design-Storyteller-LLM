'''Pryntaler Obarskyr''' was King of [[Cormyr]] from the {{YearlinkName|1187}} to the {{YearlinkName|1210}}. He was the son of [[Palaghard I]] and [[Enchara]].

==Description==
Pryntaler had broad shoulders and blue eyes. He kept his brown hair and beard trimmed very short. After his health began to fail, his hair turned gray and he lost weight to the point he was almost considered gaunt.

==Personality==
Pryntaler had a fiery temper. In his youth, he was bold and rash. It was not until his health turned for the worse that he became more diplomatic and considerate. He seemed to gain wisdom and an awareness of people and events in the context of history.

==Abilities==
He was an excellent dancer and, in his later years, his writings demonstrated remarkable tact and penmanship.

==Relationships==
Pryntaler's father was Palaghard Obarskyr I and his mother was warrior queen Enchara of [[Esparin]].The surname Crownsilver comes from {{Cite web/Candlekeep forum| title = Cormyr Dynasty?| author = Nevorick| topicid = 2765| postid = 93175| date = 2005-07-08}} citing an unknown but supposedly official source. with whom he had one son, [[Dhalmass Obarskyr|Dhalmass]].

After conquering [[Hullack Forest]], Pryntaler allowed the Lord of Hullack, [[Eltrym Drauthglas]], to keep his title and stewardship of the land. Pryntaler and Eltrym eventually became friends that enjoyed playing [[chess (game)|chess]] and discussing the younger generation of nobles over a glass of [[wine]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1188}}, Pryntaler met with a group of Sembians (consisting of [[Kodlos]], [[Homfast]], Lady [[Threnka]], Old [[Bennesey]] and [[Jollitha Par]]) to discuss the border between [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]] and the ownership of the city of [[Marsember]]. During the discussions that lasted many days, Pryntaler was attacked by an [[abraxus]], which poisoned [[Juarkin Crownsilver|Juarkin]] and [[Thessilion Crownsilver]]. The High Wizard of Cormyr, [[Jorunhast]], disabled the abraxus with a ''[[lightning bolt]]'' and it was used as a diplomatic tool to force the Sembians to concede that Marsember was not in their territory.
