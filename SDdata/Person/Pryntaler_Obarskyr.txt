In the , Pryntaler met with a group of Sembians (consisting of Kodlos, Homfast, Lady Threnka, Old Bennesey and Jollitha Par) to discuss the border between Cormyr and Sembia and the ownership of the city of Marsember. During the discussions that lasted many days, Pryntaler was attacked by an abraxus, which poisoned Juarkin and Thessilion Crownsilver. The High Wizard of Cormyr, Jorunhast, disabled the abraxus with a lightning bolt and it was used as a diplomatic tool to force the Sembians to concede that Marsember was not in their territory.
