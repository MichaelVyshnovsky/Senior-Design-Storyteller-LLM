They stopped at the Waukeens Rest inn, where the entourage fell victim to the Cult of the Absolutes ambush in which Ulder Ravengard was kidnapped. Florrick and her Fists marched towards the Moonrise Towers to rescue the Duke but were waylaid by the dangers of the Shadow-cursed lands. Fist Jehlar and the rest found shelter in the Last Light Inn, where they met High Harper Jaheira and her Harpers, who sought to end the life of General Ketheric Thorm, the leader of the Absolutes army. When the survivors encountered a man wearing naught but rags â€“ a fellow Flaming Fist who had somehow survived in the cursed lands for a century, Jehlar took upon herself to care for the man. Flame Art Cullagh was found walking but soon after being taken to the Last Light Inn, collapsed catatonic, only mumbling lyrics of some ancient song. Fist Jehlar was attempting to help the man and find a way to awaken him in case he had any information about the kidnapped Duke \nWhen a group of True Souls arrived at the Last Light Inn, Jehlar was among those present for the events that followed. It was unknown if she survived the war with the Absolute she might had perished after the darkness consumed the Last Light Inn, or else she survived with the rest, storming the Moonrise Towers to end General Thorms reign."
