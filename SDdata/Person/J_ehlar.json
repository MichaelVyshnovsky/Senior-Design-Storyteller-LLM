        "Description": "J'ehlar had shoulder-length black hair and she wore a set of [[splint armor]] with a [[tabard]] over it decorated with the Flaming Fist cast.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Fist J'ehlar was a member of a Flaming Fist troop that accompanied Counselor Florrick and Duke Ravengard on a mission to [[Elturel]]. They stopped at the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn, where the entourage fell victim to the [[Cult of the Absolute]]'s ambush in which Ulder Ravengard was kidnapped. Florrick and her Fists marched towards the [[Moonrise Towers]] to rescue the Duke but were waylaid by the dangers of the [[Shadow-cursed lands]]. Fist J'ehlar and the rest found shelter in the [[Last Light Inn]], where they met High Harper [[Jaheira]] and her [[Harper]]s, who sought to end the life of General [[Ketheric Thorm]], the leader of the Absolute's army. When the survivors encountered a man wearing naught but rags â€“ a fellow Flaming Fist who had somehow survived in the cursed lands for a century, J'ehlar took upon herself to care for the man. Flame [[Art Cullagh]] was found walking but soon after being taken to the Last Light Inn, collapsed catatonic, only mumbling lyrics of some ancient song. Fist J'ehlar was attempting to help the man and find a way to awaken him in case he had any information about the kidnapped Duke \n\nWhen a group of [[True Soul]]s arrived at the Last Light Inn, J'ehlar was among those present for the events that followed. It was unknown if she survived the war with the Absolute; she might had perished after the darkness consumed the Last Light Inn, or else she survived with the rest, storming the Moonrise Towers to end General Thorm's reign."
