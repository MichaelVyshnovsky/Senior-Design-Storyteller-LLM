        "mainbody": "'''Maerele Oromanche''' was the eldest of the many [[Oromanche]] siblings and the head of a prominent [[Mosstonian]] merchant family in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Maerele, like virtually all members of the family, was described to have \"dark, lush good looks.\" She was a bombastic and flamboyant woman with a strong and daring personality.",
        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Oromanche clan was one of the most successful merchant organizations in [[Tethyr]] and the town of Mosstone. Maerele Oromanche was the matriarch of the clan who shepherded her much younger siblings: [[Elklund Oromanche|Elklund]], [[Odyle Oromanche|Odyle]], [[Imraphar Oromanche|Imraphar]], [[Olora Oromanche|Olora]], [[Emruelle Oromanche|Emruelle]], and [[Haladeira Oromanche|Haladeira]]. Most contributed to the family's mercantile activities. [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]] was a good friend of the matriarch."
