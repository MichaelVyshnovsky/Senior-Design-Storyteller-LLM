        "mainbody": "Maerele Oromanche was the eldest of the many Oromanche siblings and the head of a prominent Mosstonian merchant family in the late 15 century DR.\nMaerele, like virtually all members of the family, was described to have \"dark, lush good looks.\" She was a bombastic and flamboyant woman with a strong and daring personality.\nBy the late 15 century DR, the Oromanche clan was one of the most successful merchant organizations in Tethyr and the town of Mosstone. Maerele Oromanche was the matriarch of the clan who shepherded her much younger siblings Elklund, Odyle, Imraphar, Olora, Emruelle, and Haladeira. Most contributed to the familys mercantile activities. Elminster of Shadowdale was a good friend of the matriarch."
