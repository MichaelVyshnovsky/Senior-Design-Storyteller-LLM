Derval Ironeater was the last King of Clan Ironeater who went on to become a blacksmith in Daggerford.
Derval Ironeater was a stout and muscular dwarf with dark red hair and a grown out beard. His body was decorated with the shining metal ink tattoos that were a family secret of the Clan Ironeater. Working tiredly in his smithy, he often smelled of body odor, something he referred to as "sweatin like a pign the pot".
Derval was a gruff and loud individual who could come off as rude but, in reality, was friendly, and full of crude jokes. He referred to elves as "tree huggers" in jest.
Derval had three children who worked as stonemasons.
Derval and his daughter Veiti Ironeater shared a loving relationship even though they were quite different. Derval preferred for his daughter to work the forge and hone her skills rather than adventure or dream about the past glories of Illefarn, a trait he thought both Veiti and her mother shared.
He was the grandfather of Ignal Ironeater, who had been his proxy at meetings with the Smiths Guild for decades.
Derval possessed a +1 battleaxe, a +3 hammer, a set of +1 plate mail, a shield, and a ring of telekinesis.
Derval traveled to Daggerford with his brothers Derwin and Korin and their families around 1270 DR. Korin disappeared in 1350 DR and they never heard from him again. Clues suggested the dwarven brothers originated from Illefarn.
By 1370 DR, Derval was a respected blacksmith, councilor, guildmaster, and the proprietor of Dervals Bright Blade, working there alongside with his daughter, Veiti Ironeater.
He lived in a house in the south section of Daggerford near the drill field.
Derval died in late 1484 DR.
