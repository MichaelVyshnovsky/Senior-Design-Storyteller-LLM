        "mainbody": "'''Hendris Teinel''' was the landlord of the [[Scarlet Shield]] inn in the town of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/\"Extermination\" Plot Recap}}<ref group=\"note\">Referred to as \"the patron of the Scarlet Shield\", it is unclear if Hendris is meant to be the innkeeper and/or the owner (the definite article 'the' suggests he is not merely a customer). Nothing connects Hendris to the otherwise-unnamed innkeeper of the Scarlet Shield described in other sources. This article interprets \"patron\" to mean property owner or landlord, which is an older meaning of the word.",
        "Activities": "Around [[1372 DR]], Hendris promised free meals nightly at the Scarlet Shield to any [[adventurer]] who could bring him back a piece of the [[Fools Finger]] obelisk. These rosy-red magical stones he carved into small shields and sold to merchants leaving for [[Waterdeep]]. Apparently they were quite popular there among adventurers and nobles, who used them to make their drinks cold and glow. Despite the quality of the Scarlet Shield's food, many adventurers took him up on this for the sake of a ready source of food, and almost as many made it back with one of the stones. However, Hendris required them to be at least as big as his own, sizeable, big toe."
