'''Balrik Daershun''' was a male [[bandit]] in the [[Dalelands]].

==History==
Balrik fought for [[Lashan Aumersair]] in his war of conquest of the Dalelands. After the defeat of Lashan, Balrik with three other companions turned to banditry.

However, in early [[1358 DR]], the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]]'s [[Sharantyr]] defeated them in a brief skirmish, impressing the arriving [[Elminster Aumar]].
