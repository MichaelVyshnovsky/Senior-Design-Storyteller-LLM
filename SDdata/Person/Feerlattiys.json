        "mainbody": "Feerlattiys was a sahuagin captain of the City of Caverns in the late 1360s DR.\nThe captain was curious about, and intrigued by, those other than his own kind.\nFeerlattiys was skilled with the spear and the crossbow. He utilized different types of bolts, from paralytic to biting bolts.\nWhen outsiders reached the City of Caverns in 1369 DR, the captain and High Priestess Senityili greeted them. At first, they could not understand, so the priestess called upon Sekolah to grant them understanding of their language. The curious captain asked the priestess if the foreigners could understand them, and if they were potentially dangerous. He trusted in the high priestess, and believed that Gorions Ward was the chosen of Sekolahs prophecy. The captain supported the rebel cause of Prince Villynaty."
