}}'''Anthraxus the Decayed''' ({{Pronounce|Ã¦n|THRAK|sus|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}}|audio=Anthraxus.ogg}}) was the ruler of the [[Blood Rift]].{{Fact}}

==Description==
Anthraxus has [[darkvision]], and [[blindsight]]. He speaks [[Abyssal]], [[Common]], [[Primordial]], and he has [[telepathy]]. He also hovers and can [[teleport]].

==History==
Anthraxus was once an unenhanced [[ultroloth]], but a coven of [[night hag]]s transformed him into an [[altraloth]], tasking him with destroying a crusade of [[paladin]]s. Once he had fulfilled his contract with the hags, in approximately {{Yearlink|-1522}}, Anthraxus violently wrested the Wasting Tower from his predecessor to become the reigning Oinoloth of the [[yugoloth]] race.

In approximately [[1357 DR]], an [[arcanaloth]] called [[Yrkhetep]] became unusually obsessed with the [[Vilhon Reach]], seeking to usurp Anthraxus and take over the [[Siege Malicious]] of Khin-Oin through an artifact called the ''[[Infinity Train]]''. To stop Yrkhetep's plans, Anthraxus subtly intervened on the side of Good. When he uncovered Yrkhetep's full plans, he lured the arcanaloth to his home plane to confront him directly.

Anthraxus was ousted by the ultroloth [[Mydianchlarus]] at some point between [[1357 DR]]<ref group="note" name="present1">The "present day" in ''[[Swords of the Iron Legion]]'', when Anthraxus was still in power. and [[1369 DR]].<ref group="note" name="present2">The "present day" in ''[[Faces of Evil: The Fiends]]'', when Anthraxus had already been ousted. Not through violence, but by Mydianchlarus whispering a secret in Anthraxus's ear so profound and disturbing that he was compelled to leave Khin-Oin and move on. As of 1369 DR he was wandering the [[Fiendish Planes]], petitioning the various [[god]]s of [[evil]] to serve as their proxy, using riches hidden in keeps and safehouses throughout the Fiendish Planes to finance his schemes, and hoping to employ a team of [[adventurer]]s to force their way into Khin-Oin and keep Mydianchlarus distracted while he confronted the usurper directly.{{Cite dragon annual/1997/Pox of the Planes|105}} These schemes must have worked, because by approximately [[1379 DR]] he had regained his throne.
