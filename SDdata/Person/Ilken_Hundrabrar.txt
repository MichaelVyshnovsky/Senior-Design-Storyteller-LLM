'''Ilken Hundrabrar''' was a shopkeeper dealing in repaired furniture and clothing in [[Harrowdale]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He also maintained a hidden profession as a [[toad]] breeder.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Monster Breeding for Fun and Profit}}

==History==
Sometime prior to running his shop, Hundrabrar was an apprentice [[gem]]-cutter and jewel-maker under [[Hulgur Yond]], a legendary "jewel-master". After his master was eaten by a [[gray render]] under mysterious circumstances, he fell out of the profession.
