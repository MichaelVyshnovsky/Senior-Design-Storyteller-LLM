Ilken Hundrabrar was a shopkeeper dealing in repaired furniture and clothing in Harrowdale in the late 15 century DR. He also maintained a hidden profession as a toad breeder.
Sometime prior to running his shop, Hundrabrar was an apprentice gem-cutter and jewel-maker under Hulgur Yond, a legendary "jewel-master". After his master was eaten by a gray render under mysterious circumstances, he fell out of the profession.
