'''Kesten "Steelglance" Orthalin''' was a warrior and [[adventurer]] of the 13th century [[DR]]. He was the leader of the [[Grimblades]] [[adventuring company]].

==History==
Kesten and the Grimblades were thought to have plundered a number of ruins in the lands around the eastern [[Inner Sea]].

In the late 13th century DR, Kesten came into the possession of a magical [[short sword]] and had the sage [[Arthylmas]] of [[Saerloon]] identify the blade. It was ''[[Sarghathuld]]'', a legendary relic of [[Roldilar]] and [[Impiltur]], and lost since [[1127 DR|the Year of the Luminar Procession, 1127 DR]], a century and a half before.

However, barely three seasons later, Kesten and the Grimblades were slain by the [[green dragon]] [[Urnalithorgathla]] in her lair in the [[Spiderhaunt Wood]] in the [[Dalelands]]. Their bones and ''Sarghathuld'' laid among her treasure hoard for over ninety years.{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|90}}
