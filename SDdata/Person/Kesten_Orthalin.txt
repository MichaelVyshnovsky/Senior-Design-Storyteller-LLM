Kesten "Steelglance" Orthalin was a warrior and adventurer of the 13th century DR. He was the leader of the Grimblades adventuring company.
Kesten and the Grimblades were thought to have plundered a number of ruins in the lands around the eastern Inner Sea.
In the late 13th century DR, Kesten came into the possession of a magical short sword and had the sage Arthylmas of Saerloon identify the blade. It was Sarghathuld, a legendary relic of Roldilar and Impiltur, and lost since the Year of the Luminar Procession, 1127 DR, a century and a half before.
However, barely three seasons later, Kesten and the Grimblades were slain by the green dragon Urnalithorgathla in her lair in the Spiderhaunt Wood in the Dalelands. Their bones and Sarghathuld laid among her treasure hoard for over ninety years.
