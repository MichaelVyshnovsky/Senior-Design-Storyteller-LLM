Whelgar Taerncole was a human man of the city of Wheloon in Cormyr. He was a former adventurer and proprietor of the Sleeping Cat restaurant.
Whelgar was once an adventurer and a member of the Easy Blades Adventuring Band, a group often suspected of smuggling. He later retired.
Before 1358 DR, he bought the Sleeping Cat tavern in Wheloon. Sick of the brawling, Whelgar got rid of both taproom and wine cellar, and developed the place as a restaurant instead. By around 1369 DR, the Sleeping Cat had steadily become a proper, quality restaurant under Whelgars ownership.
