'''Whelgar Taerncole''' was a [[human]] man of the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. He was a former [[adventurer]] and proprietor of the [[Sleeping Cat]] restaurant.

Whelgar was once an adventurer and a member of the [[Easy Blades Adventuring Band]], a group often suspected of smuggling. He later retired.

Before [[1358 DR]], he bought the [[Sleeping Cat]] [[tavern]] in Wheloon. Sick of the brawling, Whelgar got rid of both taproom and wine cellar, and developed the place as a restaurant instead. By around [[1369 DR]], the Sleeping Cat had steadily become a proper, quality restaurant under Whelgar's ownership.
