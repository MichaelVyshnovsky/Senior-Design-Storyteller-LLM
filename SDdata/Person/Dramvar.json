        "mainbody": "Dramvar was an eladrin noble and the Master of the Spire of Summers Mist on the Watch on Forevers Edge, together with Eloar.\nHe had platinum-colored hair, bound-up in a knot, and a pale visage.\nDramvar was quite pleasant and gregarious, though he still wasnt used to humans displaying certain levels of skill.\nHe was fond of Taal.\nDramvar carried an enchanted, glimmering bow of silvery wood. Though it was unstrung, it created a thread of light to use as string when held. During his visit to the Spire of Winters Peace, he was wearing platinum-colored clothes.\nAt a point in time equivalent to the , Dramvar joined Eloar in a trip to their neighboring spire, the Tower of Winters Peace, where they sought to talk to Malyanna. Her castellan, Taal, informed them that her absence continued and that she was in the world rather than the Feywild they invoked the Articles of the Compact, requesting Taal provide access to her chambers, so that they may be examined for suspicious activity. Though Taal acquiesced, he ambushed and slew them shortly afterwards. He discarded their bodies over Forevers Edge later.\nTaal replicated Dramvars handwriting later, claiming that the two eladrin nobles hed slain had decided to remain at Winters Peace for a full tenday."
