Awagi Nukichi was a writer of biographies in Kara-Tur.
A copy of Awagis biography of Emperor Joon Tsao Choo—an apparent conflation of the ancient emperors Kujawa and Tan Chin—was kept in the biography reference section of the Great Library of Perpustakaan by circa . It covered Tan Chins corruption and the destruction of Kuo Meilan, as well as made mention of the later destruction of Tempat Larang.While Ronin Challenge makes several references to Joon Tsao Choo, Awagis biography on page 67 is clearly that of the already-established Tan Chin, retelling his fall at Kuo Meilan and appending a disaster striking Tempat Larang a few years afterward. While Joon Tsao Choo could have been Tan Chin completely, The Grand History of the Realms later retconned this, inventing the much-earlier Anok-Imaskar, placing the settlement and destruction of Tempat Larang within its time, Kujawas death 170 years later, and Tan Chins empire centuries after that. Thus, in-universe, Awagis story appears to be a mistaken conflation of the falls of both empires and emperors.
