        "mainbody": "'''Korgan Bloodaxe''' was a violent [[dwarven]] mercenary that worked out of the city of [[Athkatla]] in the late 1360s [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''\"Aye this be a grand enough lot. Mayhap I won't be needin' to kill ye all anytime soon.\"''|Korgan}}",
        "Description": "He had a distinct belly that was presumed to be caused by his excessive consumption of alcohol.",
        "Personality": "Korgan had a particularly crass sense of humor. He readily insulted others and appreciated when they responded in kind. Conversely, he genuinely enjoyed violence and admired those who displayed great skill in combat.\n\nSurprisingly he enjoyed writing poetry as well. Some verses were eloquent and concise while others were crude limericks scrawled into the walls of privvies.",
        "Relationships": "Among the members of Korgan's crew of ne'er do wells and thugs were [[Shagbag]], Crazyface, Scrooloose, Stitch, Hogbelly, and Cutter.",
        "History": "Tragically, Korgan's mother died while she was still pregnant with him. His father had to intervene to ensure the baby dwarf would live. Only five years later,his father died as well and Korgan and his three brothers were left orphaned.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Korgan and his crew were hired to retrieve the ''[[Book of Kaza]]'' from a crypt beneath Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Grave District|Grave District]]. Unfortunately a bloody fight broke out, causing the group to disband and abandon the task as hand.\n\nKorgan spent over a [[tenday]] simultaneously killing members of his crew and seeking out other adventurers within the [[Copper Coronet]] to aid him with the book's recovery.\n\nBy that time however, the rest of Korgan's former allies had rallied together to retrieve the ''Book of Kaza'' and killed their former employer Pimlico."
