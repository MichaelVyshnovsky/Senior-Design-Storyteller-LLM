        "mainbody": "hovel was the quasit who served as familiar to the necromancer and former Red Wizard Ilyn Toth.\nShovel was a malicious little creature that found exceptional joy in terrorizing and eviscerating innocent folk. Her favorite activity was eating babies.\nThe quasit had mixed feelings about her former master. Shovel thoroughly enjoyed assisting with Toths necromantic work, but was annoyed when she was wasnt called or fed. Shovel did not seem to care much about having a new master, and treated them with the same aloof indifference. Her true passion was the mayhem.\nThroughout their time together, Ilyn Toth and Shovel managed to kill nearly a half dozen residents of Moonhaven, inter their corpses within an underground cemetery, and raise them as undead monstrosities."
