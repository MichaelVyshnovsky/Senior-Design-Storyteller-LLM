'''Nhalbert Taluth''' was the ex-mercenary and ex-soldier from [[Cormyr]] who retired and opened a store called [[Taluth's Shrewd Flight]] in [[Mosstone]], [[Tethyr]], in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Taluth's Shrewd Flight was a small store that sold masterfully crafted [[bow]]s, [[bowstring]]s, [[quiver]]s, and [[arrows]]. The goods were expensive but reasonably priced for the quality.

==History==
Nhalbert Taluth was an expert sharpshooter. He learned his skills with the bow during his days commanding archers of Cormyr. When he left the Dragon Throne's army, Nhalbert took on a mercenary trade as a marksman-for-hire. His work earned him a foul reputation as his arrows pierced over a dozen nobles of the [[Vilhon Reach]]. Once he was no longer welcomed in the Vilhon, Nhalbert joined a trading caravan who moved west. Bandits ambushed the caravan, and in the struggle, Nhalbert tumbled under a speeding wagon, losing a leg in the process. He survived that brigand ambush by the skin of his teeth. The injured archer showered the bandits with all of his arrows, keeping them at bay long enough for the surviving caravaners to rescue him.

With his new [[peg leg]], Taluth was unable to effectively lay in ambush and practice his marksmanship as a bow-for-hire, unable to go to war as a soldier. Instead, he retired to a quaint wooden town of Mosstone along the [[Trade Way]]. He used his archery and fletching skills to make a login selling masterfully crafted goods to local [[ranger]]s and traveling caravans.

==Rumors & Legends==
Local Mosstonians believed that Nhalbert Taluth knew [[elf|elven]] magic that helped him grow good quality straight saplings in the grove where he gathered wood for his trade, to the east of the city walls.
