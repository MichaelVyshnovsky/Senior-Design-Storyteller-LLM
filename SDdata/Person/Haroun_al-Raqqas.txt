'''Haroun al-Raqqas''' was the caliph of [[Wasat]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/Land of Fate/Adventurer's Guide to Zakhara|69}}

==Description==

Haroun was also referred to as "Blood of the First Caliph" as he was indeed a descendant of the [[First Caliph]], though his lineage was quite diluted.

==Possessions==
The caliph wore a magical ring that could summon a powerful [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerer]] to his aid at a moment's notice.
