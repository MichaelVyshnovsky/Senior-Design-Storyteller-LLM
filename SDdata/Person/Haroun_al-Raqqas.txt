Haroun al-Raqqas was the caliph of Wasat in 1367 DR.
Harouns eyes were always bleary.
Haroun acquired the position of caliph after the untimely fatal accident of his predecessor. Harouns quick wit and family tree earned him the title, which he later came to regret.
Haroun was also referred to as "Blood of the First Caliph" as he was indeed a descendant of the First Caliph, though his lineage was quite diluted.
The caliph wore a magical ring that could summon a powerful sorcerer to his aid at a moments notice.
