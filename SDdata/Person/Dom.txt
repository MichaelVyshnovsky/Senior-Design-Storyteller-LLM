'''Dom''' was the baker at [[Thistleflame Manor]] and servant of Lord [[Partic Thistle]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
Dom was a huge, round man, with a bald head and a red face.

==Personality==
He was hugely self-important and arrogant, and had a monomaniacal focus on baking to the exclusion of all other topics.

==Activities==
Dom was the Manor's baker, and spent much of his time baking or preparing to bake. He dominated the kitchen when he worked, demanding utter quiet so that he could concentrate. Despite his histrionics, or perhaps because of them, his culinary creations were legendary in Suzail.

==Relationships==
The cooks in the kitchen, [[Nora and Dora|Nora, Dora]] and [[Malda]] found his antics tiresome.
