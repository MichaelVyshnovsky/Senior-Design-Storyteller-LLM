Hexabaal was an otherworldly foulspawn seer that appeared on Toril for a brief time in the late years of the 15 century DR.
It appeared as if Hexabaal once entered into an infernal contract with an entity from the Nine Hells in order to gain some of her powers, possibly Asmodeus himself given the specifications of the contract as it appeared in the summoning circle.
Hexabaal was a rival of the Prophet Rohini, leader of the Ashmadai in the time leading up to her imprisonment.
Some time during or before the , Hexabaal was bound within a summoning circle in Helms Hold by Rohini. The Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge made a deal with Hexabaal to weaken the circle enough for the foulspawn to escape, and in exchange Hexabaal told the hero of a secret entrance to the Helms Hold sanatorium so they could kill Rohini.
Over a decade later, during the Elemental Evil crisis, Hexabaal remained bound to the Prime Material plane by a series of wards in Helms Hold. The wards had to be regularly reinforced by a specific ritual, the specifications of which were known to the hedge wizard Nottin.
