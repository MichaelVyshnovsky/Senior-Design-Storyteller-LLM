'''Hexabaal''' was an otherworldly [[foulspawn]] seer that appeared on [[Toril]] for a brief time in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
{{Quote|There is a seer nearby who has need of a [[summoning circle]]. Hexabaal, I think his name is.<ref group="note">While Hexabaal is given a masculine pronoun by [[Gurzek Balegaze]], she is referred to as such by [[Nottin]] and [[Aldwin Graves]] multiple times in ''[[Neverwinter: Elemental Evil]].'' If you look for the outermost rings, the most damning clauses are usually filled in there. Quite fine print though. Look closely.|[[Gurzek Balegaze]], on the specifications of Hexabaal's infernal contract.}}

It appeared as if Hexabaal once entered into an [[infernal contract]] with an entity from the [[Nine Hells]] in order to gain some of her powers, possibly [[Asmodeus]] himself given the specifications of the contract as it appeared in the summoning circle.

Hexabaal was a rival of the Prophet [[Rohini]], leader of the [[Ashmadai]] in the time leading up to her imprisonment.

==History==
Some time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Hexabaal was bound within a summoning circle in [[Helm's Hold]] by Rohini. The [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] made a deal with Hexabaal to weaken the circle enough for the foulspawn to escape, and in exchange Hexabaal told the hero of a secret entrance to the Helm's Hold [[sanatorium]] so they could kill Rohini.

Over a decade later, during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis, Hexabaal remained bound to the [[Prime Material plane]] by a series of [[ward]]s in Helm's Hold. The wards had to be regularly reinforced by a specific [[ritual]], the specifications of which were known to the hedge wizard [[Nottin]].
