'''Koraboros''' was a [[pit fiend]] who was trapped within [[Ammon Jerro]]'s haven in the [[Sword Mountains]], for the purpose of empowering the [[warlock]], around [[1374 DR]].

==History==
He was in a constant feud with several of the other imprisoned [[demon]]s and [[devil]]s, but broke free when [[Baalbisan]] convinced [[Shandra Jerro]] to spill her blood to undo the magic that bound the demons to the haven.

Once he returned to [[Baator]], Koraboros began to plot revenge upon Jerro for imprisoning him. Eventually he was able to lure Jerro to the ruined farm his granddaughter Shandra had once owned. Koraboros appeared before Jerro and attacked him, but Jerro was able to overcome the pit fiend with the assistance of his newfound ally, the [[Kalach-Cha]] and companions.

The Kalach-Cha later journeyed to the [[Academy of Shapers and Binders]] in [[Thay]], where two pit fiends, [[Oronock]] and [[Thael'ka]], informed them that Koraboros had suffered a painful "demotion ceremony" for his failure to defeat Jerro.
