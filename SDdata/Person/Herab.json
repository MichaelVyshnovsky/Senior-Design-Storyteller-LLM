The Barracuda traveled alongside the Sword Coast from the city to a hidden cove on the Crabs Claw Coast. Her ship carried smuggled arms and armor for a swelling orc and tanarukk horde, all part of the nefarious Zhent ploy. The horde paid him hefty amounts of gold and able-bodied slaves. Luckily, the Hero of Daggerford investigated suspicious activities of the Mariners Alliance and discovered the suspicious shipping activities of Herabs. The Hero followed up on the clues and discovered an orc hideout in the Wild Pastures south Daggerford. From there, the adventurers followed the clues to a hidden pirate cove filled with smuggled goods, and recently captured slaves, including Jerick, a shepherd with whom the Hero of Daggerford had dealings recently. Captain Herab faced the Hero of Daggerford in battle, aided by a massive tanarukk leader and a loyal beast of Xvim. Despite her battle prowess, Herab was no match for the Hero, and the pirate Zhen was killed in battle. Her death returned to the Hero, their kidnapped friend, Talarenne, and eventually led to the citys being safe from the Black Network takeover."
