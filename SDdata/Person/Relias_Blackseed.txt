Relias Blackseed was a halfling master maker of musical instruments who lived circa early 11 century DR.
Relias renown came from his creation of the Cittern of War. The instrument was blessed and enchanted by the clerics of the Church of Arvoreen, making it a truly remarkable magic item. Despite the Cittern of War being masterfully crafted, Relias did not create it for personal use. It was sold to the bard named Gallow Deely, who used the cittern to compose many a song about adventurers and their heroic deeds.
