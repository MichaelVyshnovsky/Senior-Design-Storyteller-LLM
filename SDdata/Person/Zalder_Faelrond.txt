Camp Vengeance, Chult
Zalder Faelrond was a knight Torm and member of the Order of the Gauntlet, who lived in Camp Vengeance in Chult during the late 15 century DR.
Some time during or before the 1490s DR, Zalder was traveling through the jungles of Chult, when he was ambushed and kidnapped by the coven of hags known as the Sewn Sisters. He was then imprisoned within the Cradle of the Death God, in the terrifying Tomb of the Nine Gods.
