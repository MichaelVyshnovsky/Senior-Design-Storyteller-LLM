Believe me, I know something about knocking heads together. Of course, if I were one of the Fists, I'd make sure things got straightened out in these streets double-quick.|Bombasto the Barbarian}}",
        "Description": "Bombasto was a middle-aged [[human]] man with a tanned skin tone. He had blue eyes, a bushy braided light brown beard, and a clean-shaven head. His face and scalp were decorated with simple geometric lines and designed [[tattoo]]s. He wore a simple set of barbarian clothes and a massive [[greataxe]].",
        "Posessions": "Bombasto carried a journal written in large and loose handwriting, collecting memories of Bombasto's adventuring and juvenile pranks.",
        "Relationships": "Bombasto's traveling companion was [[Dame Guisarme]], with whom he seemed to have a flirtatious and friendly-antagonistic relationship. She thought the barbarian's schemes and ideas were crazy but ended up getting involved in them anyway, but not before receiving a compliment from Bombasto and responding to it with a slap.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Bombasto was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. He was often seen dining or enjoying drinks with his mercenary adventuring companion, Dame Guisarme.\n\nOne of Bombasto's adventures was his and Dame Guisarme's stand against [[hobgoblin]] raiders who held a wagonload of [[beer]]. Bombasto was thirsty and suggested the adventurers trade a wagonload of [[donkey]] [[shit]] for the hobgoblins' beer. Despite Dame Guisarme considering the idea crazy, Bombasto went on pushing a wagon of manure off a hill. It rolled down and pushed the hobgoblins' cart of beer forward, slaying in its place. Guisarme grabbed the beer wagon down in a ravine.\n\nDuring their time at the Elfsong Tavern, Bombasto and Guisarme contemplated accepting a job in East [[Chult]], guarding extractive safari out of [[Fort Beluarian]] with bonuses paid to all survivors."
