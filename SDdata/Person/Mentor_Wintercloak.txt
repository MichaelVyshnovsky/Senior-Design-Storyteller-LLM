'''Mentor Wintercloak''' was a mysterious [[human]] [[archmage]] who lived for some time in [[Myth Drannor]] in [[Cormanthyr]].

==Relationships==
He was a close ally of [[Aubaudameira Dree|Alais Dree]].

==History==
Mentor was born in the {{YearlinkName|219}}.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|4-6}}

As a member of the [[Incanists' Society]], Mentor helped found and direct the [[Incanistaeum]] magic school. In the {{YearlinkName|667}}, he was the only human member of the early [[Council of Twelve]].

From [[426 DR]] to [[440 DR]] Mentor tutored the young [[Khelben Arunsun]] (at that time still unnamed). In the {{YearlinkName|659}}, Mentor also tutored the young [[Uthgardt]] mage [[Tulrun]]. During this period, Mentor was believed to have collected new [[spell]]s created by his apprentices in a tome titled ''[[The Wizards' Workbook]]'', which found its way into the possession of the wizard [[Flamsterd]] of [[Moonshae Isles|the Moonshaes]], who scribed a copy for his friend [[Elminster]].{{Cite dragon/69/More Pages from the Mages|71}}

However, in the {{YearlinkName|682}}, Mentor, together with [[Nacacia|the Masked]] and their four [[gnome]]s apprentices, left the city.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, he was among the many powerful mages alongside Tulrun as his former student Khleben Arunsun brought them together to cleanse part of the [[High Moor]] and restore [[Faer'tel'miir]], a lost city of [[Miyeritar]].<ref>
