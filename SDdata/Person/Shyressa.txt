Shyressa was a vampire and a member of the Twisted Rune. She slew the vampire that created her and began to study magic. She gained a Runemaster seat in the 1360s DR. She enjoyed playing cat-and-mouse games with people who drew her attention. She created many fire spells that give off dark flames in order to be more subtle in the night hours when she was active.
