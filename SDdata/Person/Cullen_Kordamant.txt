'''Cullen Kordamant''' was a priest of [[Oghma]] at the [[Domes of Reason]] in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] and the Grand Patriarch of the [[Church of Oghma]], a pontiff widely recognized as the "Voice of Oghma" on [[Toril]]. His disappearance during the [[Time of Troubles]] triggered a lasting schism in the church.{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|71}}

==History==
Worshipers of Oghma swore by Kordamant's word, and the entire church hierarchy, which was well-organized and established, was dedicated to his service and spirit. However, this all changed during the [[Time of Troubles]], in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], when Kordamant vanished without a trace from his home in Procampur, as did much of his immediate clergy.

The disappearance was a subject of much mystery and speculation. Unfortunately, answers from Oghma and other gods were confusing and contradictory, providing no clear solution.

With the Oghmyte church left without an ultimate head, the mystery caused a growing split into rival factions, disagreeing along hierarchical and theological lines. In Procampur, the [[Orthodox Church of Oghma]] stated that Kordamant had ascended to semi-divinity and was currently serving Oghma and, until he was proven dead or the god named a replacement or commanded otherwise, Kordamant was still the only true Patriarch and they would not recognize any replacement. On the other hand, the [[Oghmanyte Church in Exile|Oghmanyte Church]] in [[Sembia]] and the [[Pursuers of Pure Knowledge]] in [[Mintar]] claimed that a new Patriarch had in fact already been appointed by Oghma himself, and naturally put forward their own competing candidates. This remained unresolved more than a century later. Later, there arose a belief or heresy, depending on the faction, suggesting that Kordamant's fate had been concealed by Oghma as a test of faith for his priests, to determine whether they would hold to the quest of discovering and recording knowledge, or if they would fall prey to power struggles and reinterpretations of scripture.
