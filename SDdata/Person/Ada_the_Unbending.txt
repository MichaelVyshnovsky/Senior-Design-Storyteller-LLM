Ada the Unbending was one of the retired adventurers inhabiting Nellie Thursday Home for Experienced Adventurers sometime in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Despite her advanced age, Ada remained a fiery individual. She was only  and weighted . Ada had graying blonde hair and blue eyes.
Ada was a well-armed and armored woman. She wore an enchanted set of +2 splint mail and a magic +1 shield. Her magic warhammer named Gavel had a +3 enchantment and a ring of regeneration adorned Adas finger. She also possessed a 3-D mirror.
As a cleric, she was trained in wielding hammers, maces, lassos, and staves. Due to her profession, Ada also possessed extensive knowledge of the code of law, healing, and religion and also knew her way around a rope. Ada the Unbending knew several languages Common, Elvish, Dwarvish, and Centaur.
As a cleric, Ada the Unbending could use divine magic to turn undead and could cast spells from astral, charm, combat, creation, divination, guardian, healing, necromantic, protection, and sun spheres. She also had minor access to the elemental sphere magic.
Ada the Unbending joined Nellie Thursday Home for Experienced Adventurers after retiring from service to a local temple to Tyr, and serving as a judge for three decades, at the age of sixty-seven, and entrusting its leadership to her daughter – Adonyne. Despite not being old enough to retire, Ada wanted to let Adonyne spread her wings. In her retirement, Ada began penning her memoirs titled Justice for All.
Ada the Unbending mesmerized a fellow Nellie Thursday inhabitant – the aging adventurer and womanizer Ratha Rann. To impress her, Ratha Rann joined Ada and several other aging adventurers on an adventure that ended up dragging them across several worlds, including the jungles of Quorsit and the demi-plane of Kansas.
