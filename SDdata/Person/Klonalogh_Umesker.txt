'''Klonalogh Umesker''' was an inhabitant of the town of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]] around [[1370 DR]].

Klonalogh was the foreman of a corps of engineers and stonemasons paid by the civic authorities of both Ravens Bluff and Tantras to maintain the massive multi-span bridge over the [[Fire River]] in Mossbridges. They could never be persuaded to risk or sabotage the bridge.

However, they were corrupt in other areas. For a hefty bribe, they would conceal bodies, treasure, and telltale items in the bridge pilings, where they might remain for a good long time. Klonalogh was head of this operation too.

The foreman's office could be found three doors north of [[The Blushing Gynosphinx]], past two rooming houses, on the east side of the road.
