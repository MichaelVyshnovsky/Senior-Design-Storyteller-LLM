==History==
Pynroth lived with nine other non-[[human]] children in [[Madame Delilah's Home for Orphaned Children]] in [[Hillsfar]] until First Lord [[Torin Nomerthal]] proclaimed again the [[Great Law of Humanity]], expelling all non-humans. Luckily, Pynroth and the others were housed by [[Ebenz Farbough|Ebenz]] and [[Bea Farbough]], two farmers without children, in a farmhouse near the city. Pynroth lived there for two years.{{Cite adventurers league/Harried in Hillsfar|9}}

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Pynroth was in the rebellious teenager phase and left the home.{{Cite adventurers league/Harried in Hillsfar|10}} He was attacked by some wild [[dog]]s but was protected by [[Beralt]] of the [[Emerald Enclave]] and saved by some [[adventurer]]s who happened to be near the farmhouse.{{Cite adventurers league/Harried in Hillsfar|11}}
