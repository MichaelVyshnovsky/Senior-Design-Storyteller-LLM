Pynroth was a tiefling youth in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Pynroth lived with nine other non-human children in Madame Delilahs Home for Orphaned Children in Hillsfar until First Lord Torin Nomerthal proclaimed again the Great Law of Humanity, expelling all non-humans. Luckily, Pynroth and the others were housed by Ebenz and Bea Farbough, two farmers without children, in a farmhouse near the city. Pynroth lived there for two years.
Circa 1486 DR, Pynroth was in the rebellious teenager phase and left the home. He was attacked by some wild dogs but was protected by Beralt of the Emerald Enclave and saved by some adventurers who happened to be near the farmhouse.
