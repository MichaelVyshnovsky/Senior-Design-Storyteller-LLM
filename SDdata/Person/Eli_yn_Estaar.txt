'''Eli yn Estaar''' was an [[ink]]-maker who owned a shop in the city of [[Calimport]].

==Possessions==
Eli was the owner of Eli yn Estaar's Inks, which was located in his two-story row home in [[Calimport/Quill Ward#Jhaapir Sabban|Jhalal Drudach of Jhaapir Sabban]] in [[Calimport/Quill Ward|Quill Ward]].

==Activities==
Eli was one of a small number of ink-makers who could be paid to poison quills or ink to use in assassinations. If paid enough, Eli had no qualms about simply carrying out assassinations himself.
