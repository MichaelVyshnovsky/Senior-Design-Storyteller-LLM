Grumshar was a half-orc local chief of the Xanathars Thieves Guild in Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR.
Grumshar managed a hideout for the Xanathars Thieves Guild in the sewers of the Dock Ward.
Around 1491 DR, he brutally directed the interrogation of Floon Blagmaar after the kidnapped young noble arrived in his headquarters, even impressing his guest the mind flayer Nihiloor. Heavily tortured, Floon was on the verge of death when adventurers hired by Volothamp Geddarm found him after defeating Grumshar.
Grumshar was in league with a gazer that protected an entrance to his hideout.
