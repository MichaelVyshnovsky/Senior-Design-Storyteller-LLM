Ghelkyn Stormwind was a wizard in Kheldell in the Sword Mountains in the late 14 century DR.
Once he was a student of Khelben Arunsun. He was totally focused in his magic research.
In the midâ€“1360s DR, he aided the loggers of Kheldell by levitating their cut timber as they transported them to waiting horse teams, who would then transport them to Red Larch for sale.
