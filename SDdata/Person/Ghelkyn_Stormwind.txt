'''Ghelkyn Stormwind''' was a [[wizard]] in [[Kheldell]] in the [[Sword Mountains]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Once he was a student of [[Khelben Arunsun]]. He was totally focused in his magic research.

In the midâ€“1360s DR, he aided the loggers of Kheldell by [[Levitate|levitating]] their cut timber as they transported them to waiting [[horse]] teams, who would then transport them to [[Red Larch]] for sale.
