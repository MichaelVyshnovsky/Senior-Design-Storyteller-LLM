'''Mistletan''' was a [[half-elf]] [[druid]] who kept a solitary watch over his area of the [[Border Forest]].

==Description==
Mistletan's long, brown hair framed his symmetrical, light-skinned features. He had pointed ears, the left of which was decorated with a crescent moon earring. His left eye was green whilst his right was brown. Mistletan wore a crescent moon medallion around his neck, and otherwise wore dark green clothing.

==Possessions==
At all times, Mistletan carried a ''[[wand of flame extinguishing]]'', as well as a ''[[medallion of ESP]]''.

==Activities==
Mistletan resided in the area of the Border Forest southeast of [[the Sword]] of [[Anauroch]]. As the only druid in this region, Mistletan warded his forest from [[Zhentarim]] hunters looking for game, and from [[Asabi|laerti]] hunters looking for people to eat.
