Mistletan was a half-elf druid who kept a solitary watch over his area of the Border Forest.
Mistletans long, brown hair framed his symmetrical, light-skinned features. He had pointed ears, the left of which was decorated with a crescent moon earring. His left eye was green whilst his right was brown. Mistletan wore a crescent moon medallion around his neck, and otherwise wore dark green clothing.
At all times, Mistletan carried a wand of flame extinguishing, as well as a medallion of ESP.
Mistletan resided in the area of the Border Forest southeast of the Sword of Anauroch. As the only druid in this region, Mistletan warded his forest from Zhentarim hunters looking for game, and from laerti hunters looking for people to eat.
