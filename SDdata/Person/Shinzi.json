Orphaned, she was adopted by Dalfred Noakes as a step-daughter and was more important as a spy.\nOutwardly, Shinzi acted as a promoter for her step-fathers inn, the Narbondels Shadow in the Eastmyr district. In truth, she spied on the drow, searching for a sign of weakness to use against them.\nShinzi was adopted by Dalfred, who used her as one of his spies."
