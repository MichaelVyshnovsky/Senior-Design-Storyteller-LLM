        "History": "Khara Sulwood grew up in [[Arabel]] hearing tales of her great-grandfather's ruling days, and decided that when she came of age she would return to the [[Dalelands]] and pick up his mantle once again.<ref name=WotSQ-p20>\n\nKhara Sulwood was proclaimed Lady of Shadowdale at dusk on [[Marpenoth 12]] in the {{YearlinkName|1487}}, after the death of [[Addee Ulphor]].<ref name=EGP-ST />\n\nUnder her leadership, Khara facilitated the arrival of numerous [[fey]] beings into the dale and its surrounding forests, prompting a shift in local woodcutting practices towards a cooperative approach of forest management. This change led to an expansion in berry and mushroom farming. Additionally, she granted the [[Harpers]] permission to utilize [[Storm Silverhand]]'s farmhouse for purposes such as training, retirement, and healing. Furthermore, Khara worked to restore amicable relations with [[Cormyr]], appointing [[Daethia Rowanmantle]], granddaughter of [[Kortyl Rowanmantle]], as the permanent envoy.<ref name=EGP-ST />\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1490}}, Khara noticed a decline in her mental faculties, prompting her to initiate the training of successors. In [[Nightal]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, she resigned from her position as lord and entrusted the [[Twisted Tower]] and rule of Shadowdale to [[Mareldraea Hawkguard]].<ref name=EGP-ST />\n\nKhara then retired to Storm's farmhouse, where she intended to spend her remaining days enjoying domestic tasks and reading from a varied library.<ref name=EGP-ST />"
