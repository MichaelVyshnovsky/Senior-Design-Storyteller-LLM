        "mainbody": "Sithe was a half-genasi, half-demon warrior who worked as an enforcer for the Dead Rats gang in Luskan. Although she was half-demon, she very much disliked being referred to as a demon.\nSithe had black skin and black eyes. Rather than hair, she had tendrils of darkness leaking from her scalp. She usually dressed in black silks.\nSithe could open a portal to the void whenever she liked. She was an expert swordswoman and was even capable of defeating Kalen whom she often sparred with.\nSithe carried a large black axe and was very proficient in its use.\nSithe was the product of an involuntary coupling between her windsoul genasi mother and a demon. In 1480 DR, Sithe was ordered by Toytere, the leader of the Dead Rats, to capture Myrin Darkdance so the Rats could deliver her to the Coin Spinners gang. Sithe attacked a dwarven caravan by herself, killing many dwarves and capturing Myrin.\nWhile at the Dead Rats headquarters, Myrin was made to think she was actually chosen as queen of the Rats in order to keep the powerful wizard under control. Kalen Dren traveled to Luskan to rescue Myrin but found she didnt want to be rescued and stayed with Myrin at the Drowned Rat. During this time, Myrin and Kalen began investigating the cause of the Fury plague and Sithe ventured out with the pair on several forays.\nSithe worked with Kalen to subdue the gangs of Luskan over a ten-day span and was at the king-making gathering of the gangs Kalen called. Later, Sithe traveled with Kalen and Myrin to the Luskan underground and confronted the demon Scour who was the source of the Fury. Sithe sacrificed herself by using her innate abilities to open a portal to the void where she took the remaining fragments of Scour. She did not return and was presumed dead by her companions.\nCategoryHalf-demons\nCategoryWindsoul genasi\nCategoryGenasi\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryInhabitants of Luskan\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryMembers of the Dead Rats\nCategoryMembers of the Dustclaws\ngn587a02oty2jiwbsjuxnuoklzxflk0"
