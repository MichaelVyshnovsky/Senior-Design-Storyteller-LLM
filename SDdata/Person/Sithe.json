        "History": "Sithe was the product of an involuntary coupling between her [[windsoul genasi]] mother and a demon.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|5563}} In [[1480 DR]], Sithe was ordered by [[Toytere]], the leader of the Dead Rats, to capture [[Myrin Darkdance]] so the Rats could deliver her to the [[Coin Spinners]] gang. Sithe attacked a [[dwarf|dwarven]] caravan by herself, killing many dwarves and capturing Myrin.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|364}}\n\nWhile at the Dead Rats headquarters, Myrin was made to think she was actually chosen as queen of the Rats in order to keep the powerful [[wizard]] under control. [[Kalen Dren]] traveled to Luskan to rescue Myrin but found she didn't want to be rescued and stayed with Myrin at the [[Drowned Rat]]. During this time, Myrin and Kalen began investigating the cause of the [[Fury]] plague and Sithe ventured out with the pair on several forays.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|4971}}\n\nSithe worked with Kalen to subdue the gangs of Luskan over a ten-day span and was at the king-making gathering of the gangs Kalen called. Later, Sithe traveled with Kalen and Myrin to the Luskan underground and confronted the demon [[Scour]] who was the source of the Fury. Sithe sacrificed herself by using her innate abilities to open a portal to the void where she took the remaining fragments of Scour.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|6237}} She did not return and was presumed dead by her companions.",
