        "mainbody": "orloun Hethel was a veteran member of the Purple Dragons in Suzail during the late 15 century DR.\nAround 1479 DR, Hethel and four more Dragons acted as escorts for the War Wizard of Cormyr Ellard Gauntur in his pursuit of the renegade Rorskryn Mreldrake. They caught up to Rorskryn as he used a portal to Marsember, while in the shape of a woman Ellard Gauntur figured out that it was Rorskryn transformed from a stain on her clothes, and they pursued through the portal. Then the evil vampire archmage Manshoon sent the death knight Targrael after them to hide Mreldrakes trail.\nTargrael found Hethel at Ildools Veil atop the Kings Tower in Marsember he was coming out, asking for Ellard Gauntur to come and see something, when he saw the man, just slain by the death knight. Hethel gave her a brief fight, but was overcome almost immediately."
