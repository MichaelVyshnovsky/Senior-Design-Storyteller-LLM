        "History": "Around [[1479 DR]], Hethel and four more Dragons acted as escorts for the [[War Wizard of Cormyr]] [[Ellard Gauntur]] in his pursuit of the renegade [[Rorskryn Mreldrake]]. They caught up to Rorskryn as he used a portal to [[Marsember]], while in the shape of a woman; Ellard Gauntur figured out that it was Rorskryn transformed from a stain on her clothes, and they pursued through the portal. Then the evil [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]] sent the [[death knight]] [[Targrael]] after them to hide Mreldrake's trail.\n\nTargrael found Hethel at [[Ildool's Veil]] atop the [[King's Tower]] in Marsember; he was coming out, asking for Ellard Gauntur to come and see something, when he saw the man, just slain by the death knight. Hethel gave her a brief fight, but was overcome almost immediately."
