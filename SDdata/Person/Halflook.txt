Halflook was a frost giant shaman in the late-14 century DR.
Around 1366 DR, Halflook presided over all of the frost giant tribes as grand shaman.
Around sometime that year he experienced a powerful omen from the Twilight Spirit. He then went on to become one of its prophets and manipulated the grand shaman of the fire giants into agreeing to a decree. This decree stated that Skarg, then Jarl of the frost giants, should abdicate his throne in favor of someone more tolerant of the Twilight Spirits desires.
The frost giant shaman Hjurm was a pupil of his.
