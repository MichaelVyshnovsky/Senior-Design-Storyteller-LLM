Halflook was a [[frost giant]] [[shaman]] in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Around [[1366 DR]]{{Giantcraft date}}, Halflook presided over all of the frost giant tribes as grand shaman.

Around sometime that year he experienced a powerful omen from the [[Twilight Spirit|Twilight Spirit.]] He then went on to become one of its prophets and manipulated the grand shaman of the [[fire giant]]s into agreeing to a decree. This decree stated that [[Skarg]], then Jarl of the frost giants, should abdicate his throne in favor of someone more tolerant of the Twilight Spirit's desires.

==Relationships==
The frost giant shaman [[Hjurm]] was a pupil of his.
