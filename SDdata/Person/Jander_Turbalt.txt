'''Jander Turbalt''' was the captain of the ship ''[[Morning Bird]]'' based in [[Tharkar]] in the [[Utter East]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Jander was fat and craven.

==Personality==
Jander was cowardly and incompetent. He lost all his last scraps of courage and dignity after the sinking of the ''Morning Bird'' and only despair, rage, and shame remained to drive him.  

==History==
Captain Turbalt was hired by a mysterious individual named [[Belmer Droon]] to transport himself and his hirelings under the cover of night from Tharkar to [[Eldrinpar]] in [[Doegan]]. The voyage turned out to be a dangerous one as shortly after sailing the ''Morning Bird'' was chased by a grim-looking black ship. The black ship bombarded the ''Bird'' with [[fire pot missile]]s and terrifying ''[[boneball]]s'', making the passengers and the crew fight for their lives. Narrowly escaping the pursuers, thanks to Belmer's skill and [[magic item]]s, the ''Morning Bird'' found itself besieged by [[Umberlee]]'s ''[[ghost ship]]'' and its [[sea zombie]]s.

After appeasing the Bitch Queen, the ''Morning Bird'' was caught up with by the ''[[Black Dragon (ship)|Black Dragon]]'', helmed by the infamous captain [[Orim Redbeard]]. Belmer Droon managed to convince the pirate captain to leave them alone, even though one of his hirelings, [[Kurthe Lornar]], was getting ready to take over the ''Bird'' and pursue Orim Redbeard, blinded with vengeance. Kurthe Lornar himself was killed in a duel with Belmer over the attempted mutiny.

Soon after, the ''Morning Bird'' sprouted leaks, likely because of Orim Redbeard's magic, rotting the hull of the ship. The crew and passengers had to evacuate the sinking ship and swim with their belongings to the shores of Doegan. Jander and a big group of his sailors survived the sinking alongside the Sharkers but the captain blamed the loss of his ship upon Belmer and the Sharkers.

Turbalt's resentment over the ship's loss was only exacerbated by the apparent threat of [[fiends]] and monsters who roamed the wilderness of Doegan. One by one, all the sailors were killed by the fiends and only the Sharkers and Jander Turbalt remained.

After arriving in Eldrinpar in Doegan, Jander revealed to the paladins from [[Waterdeep]] led by [[Miltiades]] the true identity of Belmer Droonâ€”the famed assassin [[Artemis Entreri]], hoping they would avenge the loss of his ship. He said he'd been held captive for the last week by the Sharkers. After hearing his betrayal, Entreri calmly drew a small blade and threw it at Turbalt's head, instantly killing him.
