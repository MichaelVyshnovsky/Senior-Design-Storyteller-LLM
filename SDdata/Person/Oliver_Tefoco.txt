Oliver Tefoco was the proprietor of Beehive Goods and Wares general store in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
In the late 15 century DR, Oliver appeared to be a middle-aged human man with a light skin tone and a wild head of curly dark brown hair and bushy mutton-chops. He had brown eyes and wore a monocle over his left eye. He was known for his tasty home cooking.
He had a spouse, Kroyce Tefoco, and a large family. Their two youngest children, Hemjax and Maggie, lived with them above the shop. His oldest child, Bubbles Tefoco, lived in the Stonyeyes district of the city with her family and the newborn Dorimara, whileCrowell and Thegglis traveled with merchant caravans along the Sword Coast North, and Dariel Tefoco served as a Flaming Fist mercenary. Olivers kids, Blunce Tetoco and Harvel Tefoco were amongst the most recently approved applicants to join the Flaming Fist in 1492 DR.
In the , as the Cult of the Absolute threatened the Gates safety, Olivers family were forced to leave the city for their own safety, traveling to Kroyces family in Beregost. Kroyce asked Oliver to close the store and join the family in Beregost, in Uncle Sternwells shed, but Oliver refused. All through the Absolute crisis, Beehive remained abuzz but Oliver struggled to make ends meet. During that time, Nortales Hostel, a shelter for refugees, asked Oliver for any supplies he would be willing to donate. In turn, Beehive Goods and Waress own supplier, Durinbold & Oathoon, Provisioners, suspended deliveries of food and dry goods until trade caravans could enter the Gate.
