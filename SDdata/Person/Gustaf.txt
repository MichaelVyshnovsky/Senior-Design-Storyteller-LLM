Gustaf was a human who lived in Neverwinter in the late years of the 15 century DR.
Gustaf was a rival of his nearly identical twin brother, Rodrik. Gustaf was considered to be the "evil" brother.
As of 1479 DR, Gustaf was a regular of the Beached Leviathan. He was a purveyor of stolen goods and rare magic, taking advantage on the taverns popularity to make contacts for his illicit deals. Gustaf usually disguised himself as his brother to thwart Rodriks plans to make him return to "the good path". He never raised his sword against his brother, however.
In 1479 DR, Gustaf located an entrance to Gauntlgrym. He sold that information to the Ashmadai.
