        "mainbody": "'''Alatian''' was the apprentice of a reclusive [[lich]] and arcane researcher [[Estera]], sometime before [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "During his apprenticeship, Alatian scoured countless graveyards on behest of his undead master. Wearing ''[[Alatian's Spell Shroud]]'', folk who witnessed him in the daed of night often mistook the apprentice for a [[ghost]], thanks to the ''Shroud's'' eery blue glow. Eventually, Alatian was rewarded for his tireless work with eternal life as a lich."
