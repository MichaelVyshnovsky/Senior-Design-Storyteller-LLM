        "mainbody": "arys Guin was a magic-user and adventurer that traveled with the Company of the Lynx alongside his twin brother Bartholeme for a while during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nLess than a week before the Time of Troubles began in the , the Company of the Lynx took on a job to recover a group of magically-protected pouches that were found on a recently-dead dragon whose remains lay on the bank of the Wyvernwater river. Both Parys and Bartholeme refused to removed the arcane traps that sealed the documents within the pouches, believing it to be powerful magic from a far-off land.\nKnorrel Talbot, the leader of the adventuring company, hired a woman named Midnight to complete th job the brothers refused, with the intent of killing her after she filled her purpose. Midnight learned of the documents true origin and knowing their value, fled from the group in the dead of night. The entirety of the Company of the Lynx went after her, with Parys and Bartholeme leading the pursuit. Each member save for Midnight was struck down in a terrible inferno of blue magic, the result of a sincere prayer made by the young woman to her patron goddess Mystra."
