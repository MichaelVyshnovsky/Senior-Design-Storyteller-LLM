        "History": "After [[Bane]]'s resurrection in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Cyric's High Priest [[Gormstadd]] returned to worshiping his old deity, transitioning the [[Dark God Reformed]] temple to its Banite roots. This greatly dissatisfied the Mad God, as the following year, the {{YearlinkName|1373}} brought the Order of the Crippled Fang upon the Moonsea, a mysterious cult associated with Cyric. One of the Crippled Fang's attacks fell on the city of [[Voonlar]]. An army of [[fiend]]s was unleashed inside the town's walls, with the Banite clergy being their main target. Even though Voonlar was successfully defended with the aid of the [[Hero of Daggerford]], most members of Bane's church were slain, and Gormstadd himself was incinerated inside the temple by the Zacharus, who was put in charge of the raid by the Cult's master â€“ archmage [[Maganus]]. Zacharus and his summoned [[green slaad]]i were slain by the Hero of Daggerford during the Cult's stand in the Dark God Reformed."
