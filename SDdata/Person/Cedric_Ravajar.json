        "mainbody": "Cedric Ravajar was a human man, once a leader of the Red Brigade mercenaries and later a leader of the Vipers bandits.\nCedric Ravajar was a mercenary for much of his adult life. He was also best friends with Soren Whitespear for many years, before either of them joined the Red Brigade as mercenaries.\nAfter four years of service, Cedric rose to lead the Red Brigade as its Captain, due to combat ability and charisma. Soren served as his second-in-command. In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR, he accepted Calispar Delgorth into his force and included the priest in all of the companys decisions. The two men became firm allies, perhaps even friends.\nIn the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, while on a routine scouting expedition for a minor noble, two Brigade scouts reported a dead magic zone in the Brynwood forest. Cedric kept the find secret, telling only Calispar, and the two scouts disappeared shortly afterwards. During the mission, Cedric met Dura Gerathu, a ranger of Brynwood.\nLater that year, Cedric announced his retirement and disbanded the Red Brigade. In fact, he wished to go into business for himself. A trusted few, including Soren and Calispar, departed with Cedric and returned to the dead-magic zone, where they reformed into the Vipers, a bandit group. They built their base, the Vipers Nest, within the dead-magic zone, and began raiding merchant caravans going through the Glorming Pass, all under Cedrics leadership.\nOn the 29th Eleasis, the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, Cedric spotted and recognized Dura as he studied the Vipers Nest. To prevent the ranger from revealing its location, he sent Calispar and his bandits to eliminate him.\nCedric was very proud of the Vipers Nest, and appreciated how it had helped his Vipers grow wealthy.\nCedric Ravajar was a fighter and specialized in the two-handed sword.\nHe was 6 feet and 5 inches (1.95 meters) tall and weighed 250 pounds (113 kilograms), with a excellent muscular and athletic build. He had long red hair worn in a pony-tail, light green eyes, and often had red stubble as he went days between shaving.\nIn combat, Cedric Ravajar wore chainmail and used a two-handed sword, a magical shortsword, and daggers.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryMembers of the Red Brigade\nCategoryMembers of the Vipers\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vipers Nest\nCategoryInhabitants of Brynwood\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vast\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryMercenaries\nCategoryBandits\nqa6kpza7da56zhimf3q0lnfrnsvm2dy"
