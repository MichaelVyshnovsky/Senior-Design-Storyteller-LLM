        "mainbody": "'''Cedric Ravajar''' was a [[human]] man, once a leader of the [[Red Brigade]] mercenaries and later a leader of the [[Vipers]] [[bandit]]s.",
        "History": "Cedric Ravajar was a [[mercenary]] for much of his adult life. He was also best friends with [[Soren Whitespear]] for many years, before either of them joined the Red Brigade as mercenaries.\n\nAfter four years of service, Cedric rose to lead the [[Red Brigade]] as its [[Captain]], due to combat ability and charisma. Soren served as his second-in-command. In [[1367 DR|the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]], he accepted [[Calispar Delgorth]] into his force and included the priest in all of the company's decisions. The two men became firm allies, perhaps even friends.\n\nIn [[1368 DR|the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], while on a routine scouting expedition for a minor [[noble]], two Brigade scouts reported a [[dead magic zone]] in the [[Brynwood]] forest. Cedric kept the find secret, telling only Calispar, and the two scouts disappeared shortly afterwards. During the mission, Cedric met [[Dura Gerathu]], a [[ranger]] of Brynwood.\n\nLater that year, Cedric announced his retirement and disbanded the Red Brigade. In fact, he wished to go into business for himself. A trusted few, including Soren and Calispar, departed with Cedric and returned to the dead-magic zone, where they reformed into the [[Vipers]], a [[bandit]] group. They built their base, the [[Vipers' Nest]], within the dead-magic zone, and began raiding merchant caravans going through the [[Glorming Pass]], all under Cedric's leadership.\n\nOn the 29th [[Eleasis]], [[1369 DR|the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], Cedric spotted and recognized Dura as he studied the Vipers' Nest. To prevent the ranger from revealing its location, he sent Calispar and his bandits to eliminate him.",
        "Personality": "Cedric was very proud of the Vipers' Nest, and appreciated how it had helped his Vipers grow wealthy.",
        "Abilities": "Cedric Ravajar was a fighter and specialized in the two-handed [[sword]].",
        "Description": "He was 6 feet and 5 inches (1.95 meters) tall and weighed 250 pounds (113 kilograms), with a excellent muscular and athletic build. He had long red hair worn in a pony-tail, light green eyes, and often had red stubble as he went days between shaving.",
        "Possessions": "In combat, Cedric Ravajar wore [[chainmail]] and used a two-handed sword, a magical [[shortsword]], and [[dagger]]s.{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}",
