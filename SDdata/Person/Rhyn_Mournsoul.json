        "mainbody": "Lord Rhyn Mournsoul was a moody young noble of Cormyr in the mid-to-late 14 century. Despite appearing a foppish dandy, he was a surprisingly skilled fighter.\nRhyn was thin, miserable-looking man who dressed entirely in black. He hollow cheeks and sad eyes.\nHe seemed to be perpetually depressed and trapped in angst, unable to enjoy life. His purpose in life seemed to be to indulge in romantic tragedy and inflict it upon others. Such was his dreadful personality, only his noble blood allowed him to circulate in Cormyrean high society. He greatly appreciated the grim works of Alanis Dirgesong.\nHe wore an enchanted +4 leather jerkin, and had a +3 rapier on his hip. He carried a black rose in case he ever needed to contemplate tragedy and beauty, and a book of his own excruciating romantic poetry.\nIn the , he attended a royal event at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail, sharing a room with Mendryll Belarod.\nLater, he stayed at the Journeys Rest inn near Thunderstone and encountered the famous bard Alanis Dirgesong, who shared his taste in music and general outlook in life. His night was ruined by Ryanna and Moria, a pair of vampires who used it as a hunting ground. Fortunately for Rhyn, as a noble he was too important for them to risk attacking him.\nAfterwards, Rhyn had his heart broken by a womans rejection and he decided to kill himself, only to have great difficulty finding a poison that did so painlessly. He caught up with Mendryll again, and was tempted by the bards offer of near-certain death by adventuring in the Stonelands, where he assisted in defeating the army of Lord Vorik Aris. Miraculously, he survived the struggle completely unharmed."
