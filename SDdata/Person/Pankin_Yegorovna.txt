Pankin Yegorovna (pronounced PAN-kin YAY-gore-OVE-nuh) was one of the Blades of Mulmaster.
Pankin had a daughter, Riasa Yegorovna.
Pankin was one of the Blades and also owned many trading vessels.
At one point, his wife died and he had the responsibility of caring for his daughter Riasa.
In 1491 DR, however, she became a disciple of Thylius Caramitru. Riasa and Thylius performed a demonstration of Yellow Breath at a party held for Aleyd Burral. After Pankin was informed of his daughters activities, he decided to lock her in the Tower of Blades.
