        "mainbody": "'''Elizzaria Whitehand''' was the [[Grand Mairshar]] of [[Tasseldale]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She had powers over the defense, foreign relations and the administration of justice within the dale. For the most important matters, she consulted the [[Tassel Elders]].",
        "Description": "Near the end of her reign as Grand Mairshar Elizzaria had gray hair and looked rundown and tired after over a decade of rule. She was known for dealing with others in a blunt and direct manner and very obviously wanted to retire.",
        "Possessions": "Among Elizzaria's belongings were a [[Item enchantment|magical]] ring that allowed her to change her appearance, though its exact nature or enchantment were unknown. On occasion, she would use it to enjoy a drink at the [[Royal Flagon]] in disguise, and listen to the Tassadran of [[Tegal's Mark]].",
        "History": "In her youth, Elizzaria was an adventurer, swordswoman and [[priest]]ess of [[Tymora]]. After a doctrinal dispute with the rest of the [[church of Tymora]], she returned to Tasseldale and joined the [[Mairshar]]s. Over time, Elizzaria rose up the ranks and, in [[1352 DR]], was appointed Grand Mairshar by her predecessor.\n\nBy 1367 DR, Elizzaria was on the verge of retirement and was training her successor, a cheerful [[paladin]] named [[Erich Inshiland]]."
