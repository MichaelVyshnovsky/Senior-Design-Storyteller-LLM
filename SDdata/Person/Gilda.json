She could always be found in the inns taproom, greeting guests and escorting them to their seats or rooms on the second floor. When priestess Tasina Alcrest was staying at the inn before her departure aboard the Midnight Rose, a group of thugs who were claiming to be Captain Allendrys men were escorted to the priestess chambers by Gilda.
