        "mainbody": "'''Gilda''' was an innkeeper and a serving maid from [[The Golden Apple]] inn in the [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Docks District]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Gilda was a pleasant enough older [[human]] woman with a light skin tone and light brown hair gathered in a loose bun.",
        "History": "Gilda was in the Golden Apple's employ by the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. She could always be found in the inn's taproom, greeting guests and escorting them to their seats or rooms on the second floor. When [[priestess]] [[Tasina Alcrest]] was staying at the inn before her departure aboard the ''[[Midnight Rose]]'', a group of thugs who were claiming to be Captain [[Allendry]]'s men were escorted to the priestess' chambers by Gilda. The criminals were mercenaries hired by Tasina to guard her on the trip to Neverwinter and beyond. However, she had no [[coin]], and the men were ready for violence. The true crewmen of Allendry's ship, [[Eater-of-Garm]] and [[Nisar Zayid]], arrived just in time to get a key from Gilda, to receive an annoyed comment from her about too many of Allendry's men running around, and to save the priestess and escort her to the ''Rose''."
