'''Archmeagan''' was an [[arcanist]] of ancient [[Netheril]] who lived in [[Eileanar]], the Karsus Enclave, until its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==History==
When Archmeagan's close friend [[Parzal the Outrageous]] was imprisoned after dealing with his traitorous partner [[Mortimar]], she took temporary ownership of his [[QM III]] business. He intended to take control of the business again on his release, but chose to take a long vacation outside of Netheril that meant that he survived [[Karsus's Folly]]â€”unlike Archmeagan.
