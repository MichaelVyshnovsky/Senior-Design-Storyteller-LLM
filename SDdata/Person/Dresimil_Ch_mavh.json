In the , Dresimil was supervising the re-activation of the ancient drow mythal in the cavern when her drow accidentally released the rogue Jack Ravenwild from his imprisonment inside the mythal.\nJack escaped and Dresimil devoted some resources to recapturing Jack. Ultimately, she lent drow warriors to the slaver Fetterfist for an attack on a social gathering of Ravens Bluff nobles.\nThe attack was repelled and a large force led by Myrkyssa Jelan descended to the Underdark to free nobles captured in the raid and Dresimil was killed by Myrkyssa during the battle."
