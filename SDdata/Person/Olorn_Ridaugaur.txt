'''Olorn Ridaugaur''', titled the '''War King''', was the postâ€“[[Time of Troubles]] ruler of [[Dunspeirrin]], a position he held onto past the [[Spellplague]] and [[Second Sundering]]. Despite his impressive reputation, his wife, War Queen [[Ovdana Xothcorlar]], was considered by some sages to be the one truly in charge of the city.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionic Races and Classes (Blues, Duergar, and Elans)}}

==Description==
Olorn was described as a dark-skinned and tall [[duergar]], almost {{SI|12|ft}} in height.

==Possessions==
Olorn wielded the ''[[Barakuir Scepter]]'', one of the [[Ruling Scepters of Shanatar]], though he only had access to its power to function as a magical club.

==Activities==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Olorn was seeking the command words of the ''Barakuir Scepter'' so that he might claim the [[Wyrmskull Throne]]. Even after the [[War of the Silver Marches]], this goal was seemingly not achieved.

==History==
Separated by more than 100 generations, Olorn and his issue were the last scions of [[Taark Shanat]], founder of [[Shanatar]].

Olorn came of age during the Time of Troubles, when his mother served as the avatar of Deep Duerra. By the end of the event, he had ascended the Underthrone.

==Rumors & Legends==
Olorn claimed to be the son of [[Deep Duerra]] and grandson of [[Laduguer]], a claim supported by his unusual appearance and Duerra's actions in the body of Dunspeirrin's Queen Mother during the Time of Troubles.
