'''Reveilaein Brant''' was a rogue member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the [[Dragon Coast]] region in [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Reveilaein was a young Cult member tasked with the construction of their citadel at the [[Well of Dragons]], working under [[Vargo Kent]]. However, while exploring the Well, a group of [[ogre]] miners under the command of Wearer of Purple [[Arleanda]] found a secret chamber. Arleanda was uninterested but Reveilaein was intrigued and secretly found in the chamber a tablet blessed by the dragon god of secrets [[Kalzareinad]]. He discovered that the tablet explained a ritual to turn a [[half-dragon]] into a special kind of [[dracolich]] called a [[kaemundar]], and sort to transform himself, a mere [[human]].

Knowing that his master Vargo was originally a normal [[human]] and had become a half-dragon through another ritual Reveilaein devised a plan and infiltrated his master's room, stealing the scroll detailing this ritual. Vargo immediately sensed the thief and went to stop him but Reveilaein managed to ''[[teleport]]'' himself away from the Well.

Relocating to [[Arabel]], he searched for a [[cleric]] of Kalzareinad in order to use the tablet he had found. Thank to a [[diviner]], he found [[Morven Vance]], a cleric of Kalzareinad and disciple of [[Maldraedior]]. Morven agreed to Reveilaein's offer and joined his plot. Later Reveilaein and Morven gathered a retinue of cultists around them and founded a new cell of the Cult of Dragon in the Dragon Coast, planning to use the ritual upon the local [[dragon turtle]]s. The group settled in an abandoned lighthouse in the area between [[Teziir]] and [[Westgate]]. They recruited a local [[wyrmling]] [[green dragon]] called [[Eldrisithain]] and more important the dragon turtle [[Tsenshivah]] to whom Reveilaein promised the power to kill the local fishermen, which had killed her mate.

==Personality==
Reveilaein was always fascinated with the idea of becoming immortal. He was overambitious, always trying things over his possibilities.

==Relationships==
Reveilaein was the apprentice of Vargo Kent but his master did not believe in his capabilities and usually ignored him.
