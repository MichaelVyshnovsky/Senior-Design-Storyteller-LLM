        "mainbody": "'''Marfulb''' was an especially intelligent [[ice toad]] that dwelled within the icy caves in the island of [[Oyaviggaton]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She served as advisor to the isle's draconic ruler, [[Arauthator]].",
        "Abilities": "She was exceedingly skilled at organization and governance, and had a particular interest in the natural sciences.",
        "Possessions": "Among the belongings of wealth stored on Oyaviggaton was a wealth of scientific data pertaining to the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. This information amassed by Marfulb was the culmination of years of observation and study. She took great pride in its documentation.",
        "Activities": "Marfulb led their fellow ice toads in devoted service to the [[white dragon]] Arauthator. They helped maintain their frozen island home of Oyaviggaton, and safeguarded Arauthator's immense hoard of wealth. Marfulb knew the exact amount of wealth that could be found in the island along with its location.\n\nThe loyal ice toad also documented all the actions taken by Arauthator, including the histories of all his battles and his mating habits.",
        "Relationships": "Marfulb and the ice toads were peaceful with the [[Ice Hunters]] tribe that lived on Oyaviggaton. In fact the tribal hunters caught food, such as [[bird]]s, [[fish]], and [[seal]]s, that they fed to the ice toads.",
        "History": "As of the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Marfulb had spent about 40 years living on Oyaviggaton."
