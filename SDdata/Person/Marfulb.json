        "mainbody": "arfulb was an especially intelligent ice toad that dwelled within the icy caves in the island of Oyaviggaton during the late 15 century DR. She served as advisor to the isles draconic ruler, Arauthator.\nShe was exceedingly skilled at organization and governance, and had a particular interest in the natural sciences.\nAmong the belongings of wealth stored on Oyaviggaton was a wealth of scientific data pertaining to the Sea of Moving Ice. This information amassed by Marfulb was the culmination of years of observation and study. She took great pride in its documentation.\nMarfulb led their fellow ice toads in devoted service to the white dragon Arauthator. They helped maintain their frozen island home of Oyaviggaton, and safeguarded Arauthators immense hoard of wealth. Marfulb knew the exact amount of wealth that could be found in the island along with its location.\nThe loyal ice toad also documented all the actions taken by Arauthator, including the histories of all his battles and his mating habits.\nMarfulb and the ice toads were peaceful with the Ice Hunters tribe that lived on Oyaviggaton. In fact the tribal hunters caught food, such as birds, fish, and seals, that they fed to the ice toads.\nAs of the 1480s DR, Marfulb had spent about 40 years living on Oyaviggaton."
