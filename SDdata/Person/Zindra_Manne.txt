Zindra Manne was an elderly human commoner, displaced by The Absolute, and as a refugee, sought shelter in Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Zindra had a fair skin, wrinkled and weathered by time. The cranky old woman had mousy-gray hair and was dressed in a simple blue dress.
In the , an army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldurs Gate, displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Zindra found her way to the Rivington district outside the city walls, but, like all other refugees, she was refused entrance. The womans tent was located near a warehouse that was run by the Flaming Fist, used for collection and storage of rations and other supplies for the refugees.
