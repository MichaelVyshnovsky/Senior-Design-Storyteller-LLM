'''Zindra Manne''' was an elderly [[human]] commoner, displaced by [[The Absolute]], and as a refugee, sought shelter in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Zindra had a fair skin, wrinkled and weathered by time. The cranky old woman had mousy-gray hair and was dressed in a simple blue dress.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, an army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Zindra found her way to the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] district outside the city walls, but, like all other refugees, she was refused entrance. The woman's tent was located near a warehouse that was run by the [[Flaming Fist]], used for collection and storage of rations and other supplies for the refugees.
