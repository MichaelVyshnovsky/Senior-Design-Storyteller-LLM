        "mainbody": "Xaven Tanorthis was an alchemist in the Shattered Tower of Maerimydra and later of Szith Morcane in the late 15 century DR.\nWhen, circa 1486 DR, the fire giants of Maerimydra started a war against Szith Morcane, Xaven worked with the archmage Solom Nedrazak, the ruler of the outpost, to create a means of purging the giants of the demonic blood that powered them. However, before Xaven completed the research, Szith Morcane fell to the giants and Xaven was captured. Xaven was sold to the yugoloth collector Maram il Vass and Solom Nedrazak, who eventually escaped, hired an adventuring party to find and free him.\nAt last, the adventurers managed to free Xaven from the yugoloth and took him to Sporedome to meet with Solom. Xaven and Solom restarted their research, but to complete the experiment they sent the adventurers to Maerimydra to obtain some samples of fiendish blood. The adventurers returned with a fiendish fire giant prisoner and with this subject Xaven and Solom successfully completed their research."
