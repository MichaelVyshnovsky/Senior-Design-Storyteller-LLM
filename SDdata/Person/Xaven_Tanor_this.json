        "History": "When, ''circa'' [[1486 DR]], the [[fire giant]]s of Maerimydra started a war against Szith Morcane, Xaven worked with the [[archmage]] [[Solom Ned'razak]], the ruler of the outpost, to create a means of purging the giants of the [[demon]]ic blood that powered them. However, before Xaven completed the research, Szith Morcane fell to the giants and Xaven was captured. Xaven was sold to the [[yugoloth]] collector [[Maram il Vass]] and Solom Ned'razak, who eventually escaped, hired an adventuring party to find and free him.\n\nAt last, the adventurers managed to free Xaven from the yugoloth{{Cite adventurers league/It's All in the Blood|23}} and took him to [[Sporedome]] to meet with Solom.{{Cite adventurers league/It's All in the Blood|24}} Xaven and Solom restarted their research, but to complete the experiment they sent the adventurers to Maerimydra to obtain some samples of fiendish blood.{{Cite adventurers league/It's All in the Blood|25}} The adventurers returned with a [[fiendish]] fire giant prisoner and with this subject Xaven and Solom successfully completed their research.{{Cite adventurers league/It's All in the Blood|37}}"
