'''Theod''' was a female [[troglodyte]] [[barbarian]] who roamed the [[Deep Wastes]] on raids for her tribe.

==Description==
Theod wore studded [[leather armor]] and [[gauntlets of ogre power|gauntlets]] on her raids. She typically wrapped herself in a cloak and wielded an oversized [[morningstar]].

==Personality==
She took great enjoyment in battle, especially close-quarters fighting. Theod's sojourns were often motivated by the allure of acquiring treasure from those she defeated.

==Abilities==
A fine tracker, Theod was an experienced traveler in the [[Underdark]] and was quite good at listening to her quarry's movements. In battle, although not overly strong, she was a furious combatant who wielded an oversized morningstar with deadly effect. If needed, Theod could shift her attacks to smash an opponent's weapon or intersperse vicious swipes of her claw between her morningstar's blows. Despite her [[barbarian]] rages leaving her heedless to attacks, Theod could rely on her uncanny reflexes and [[troglodyte]] stench to see her through a fight.

==Possessions==
On Theod's hunts, she was well-equipped with a number of [[magic]]al items. She wore ''[[studded leather armor]] +2'', a ''[[cloak of resistance]] +2'', and a ''[[ring of protection]] +1'' on her finger. A set of ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'' helped improve her strength above average and wield her giant-sized ''[[morningstar]] +2'' more effectively. In battle, she would make careful use of her ''[[javelin of lightning]]'' and her [[potion]] of ''[[haste]]''.

==Relationship==
Theod worked ably alongside [[Skred]], a fellow barbarian in their raiding group. Both of them respected the commands of their leader, [[Latar]], and followed his clever battle plans, even if it meant delaying attacks or attacking from range. 

==History==
Hailing from a [[troglodyte]] settlement in the [[Deep Wastes]], Theod became one the most experienced warriors in the raiding group led by [[Latar]], a cleric of [[Laogzed]]. In [[1372 DR]], Theod joined with Latar, [[Skred]], and many other troglodytes to cause mayhem in the tunnels between [[Szith Morcane]] and [[Maerimydra]]. However, after causing much chaos, the group's numbers waned and they started to become desperate to find some real plunder before returning home.
