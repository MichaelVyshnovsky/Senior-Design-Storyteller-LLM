        "mainbody": "'''Ulquar''' was a [[jackalwere]] priest of [[Malar]] in [[Undermountain]] in [[1479 DR]].",
        "History": "In 1479 DR, Ulquar heard about a room sacred to [[Selûne]] inside Undermountain where the [[lycanthropy]] curse was suppressed. Seeing this as an abomination, Ulquar went to take control of the place and re-educate in Malar's ways all the [[lycanthropes]] he found there.\n\nArriving in the room, posing as an [[elf]] cleric of Malar, he managed to convince two [[human]] [[werewolves]], [[Josephus Blaze]] and [[Mizah Sheloran]], to embrace their bestial side.",
