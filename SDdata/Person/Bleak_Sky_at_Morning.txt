'''Bleak Sky at Morning''', or '''Bleak Sky''' for short, was an [[ice hunter]] [[shaman]] who ruled over the village of [[Icewolf]] in the mid-1300s [[DR]].

==Description==
Bleak Sky wore a large metal helmet, a huge furred coat and set of gloves. The shaman also carried a [[spear]] and a [[shield]].

The ancient shaman ruled over 200 people, and was said to have incredible patience and a sense of humor.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], the ruler himself guarded the entrance to the steepest climb of the [[Ice Peak]]. Bleak Sky and his ancestors, for about 600 years, had watched over the entrance to the great climb. The [[Heroes of Ascore]], having proved their might and loyalty to goodly folk across [[Faerûn]], wished to ascend the peak—they needed to stop the [[Zhentarim]] and their allies from acquiring [[Freezefire]]'s gem. Bleak Sky at Morning granted them permission.
