        "mainbody": "aptain Frederick was the loyal guard captain leader of Daggerford circa 1372 DR.\nCaptain Frederick was a muscular man with very short dark hair. He wore Daggerfords guard uniform of gold and blue colors.\nFrederick was loyal and approachable, yet carried himself with sense of authority. He was polite and helpful.\nCaptain Frederick loved the Happy Cow tavern for its friendly owner, good food, and frothy drink.\nFrederick distrusted Dratharion of the Griffons. Even though he had nothing against mercenaries he was suspicious of the man and his secrecy. Frederick thought that not being able to know of the mercenaries operation blinded him as a leader and prevented him from serving Daggerford to the fullest. Dratharion also gave Frederick a bad gut feeling.\nCaptain Frederick knew Wikkers who was accused of murder and being insane. He did not believe the man to be dangerous nor mad, only unethical and unruly.\nBefore Frederick joined the city militia, he hones his skill serving with mercenary companies.\nIn 1372 DR, Frederick was in charge of the guard forces of Daggerford and had to share the barracks with recently hired mercenaries, the Griffons following Duke Pwyll Daggerfords mysterious \"death\". He did not approve of the presence of the military group hired by the new Duke Matagar Bugo. During that time, Daggerford was facing a crisis of dramatically increased bandit activity (in reality Zhentarim agents posing as thugs), which left the city guard understaffed and gave the duke both power and approval from the population on bringing it the outside forces. Another crisis was happening right outside of the city, in the Wild Pastures as the shepherds were mysteriously loosing livestock to invisible creatures, but due to not having enough manpower, Captain Frederick was forced to deny the farmers plea for help, asking instead a group oof adventurers to investigate the strange happenings. And another thing he needed adventurers help with was a group of Chultan wild elves who took residence not far from the Trade Way in the Lonely Barrens. The wild elves took over the land that did not belonged to them and embossed an embargo on the local farmers, cutting their access to fresh water.\nWhen the city was under the lockdown under the order of Matagar Bugo, Frederick was placed under a gag order, prohibiting him from discussing the reasons, to his deep displeasure."
