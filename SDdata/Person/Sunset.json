        "mainbody": "Sunset was a pegasus who lived in the Moonwood with his twin sister Sunrise.\nSunset was so named because his mane had reddish tinges down the length of his body. He was about sixteen hands high with strong muscles.\nThe pair were rescued from giants by the moon elf Tarathiel a few years prior to 1370 DR and, after this, they served as winged mounts for him and his partner, Innovindil."
