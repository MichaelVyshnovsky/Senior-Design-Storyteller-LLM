It was written to [[Dran Draggore]], the evil high priest of Darkmoon. The letter, penned by Kelso, wrote to Dran as if they knew each other.

            "Descent under Waterdeep": "Some time before the [[Heroes of Waterdeep]]-to-be embarked on their first task, Wently and his expeditionary group descended into [[Waterdeep/Sewers|the sewers beneath Waterdeep]], led by their guide, [[Bennet]]. Wently translated several runes around the catacombs, and triggered many traps and hidden doors (often accidentally). After much adventuring, his group found a hidden staircase, leading to the fabled dwarven ruins below the city. The team managed to descend to [[Xanathar]]'s lower sanctum, where they finally met the evil [[beholder]]. They somehow managed to escape his wrath, and arrived at the surface.",
