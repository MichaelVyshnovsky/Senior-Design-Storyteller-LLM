==Description==
At the age of 28, ''circa'' [[1350 DR]], Vala was a tall and strong, muscular [[human]] woman. She was a truly charismatic and nimble individual, despite her warrior's training and build. She wore her blond hair short, and Vala's pale skin was accentuated by her [[silver]]ed [[long sword]] and bright [[elfin chain]]mail. She carried a powerful [[enchanted]] ''+4'' silver [[shield]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1350}}, the cities of the [[Moonsea]] were abducted by an alliance of evil forces, including the deity of tyranny [[Bane]]. One of the factions that allied with the god, came from the snowy nation of [[Vaasa]]. The Banite Vaasans used powers of [[earth elemental|earth]] and [[fire elemental]]s to tunnel from Vaasa to the Moonsea North underneath the [[Galena Mountains]], as all passes were blocked off at the time. Vala became aware of the plot and rushed to oppose the Vaasans. Desperate for air, she hired a band of [[hill giant]]s to battle the looming threat.

Serendipitously, the same tunnels underneath the Galena Mountains hid an ancient ruined city swallowed by the earth in the ages past. Vala tasked the hill giants to excavate the ruins and fight its ancient guardians in search of artifacts that could turn the tide of the invasion. The magic items created by a [[wizard]] from [[Thar]]: ''[[Crucible of the Tyrant's Flame]], the [[Lindenwood Staff]], the [[Worldstone]],'' and ''the [[Oakroot Staff]]'' were buried with the town they were created in and held the power to wrestle the control over the [[elemental]] away from the Banite Vaasans.

It was unrecorded whether Vala succeeded in stopping the Vaasans on her own, or if she was aided by the heroes of [[Phlan]], or a group of her old [[Silver Blades|Silver Blade]] allies.

In the early 1360s [[DR]], Vala traveled away from the her cold homelands. She passed the town of [[Skull Crag]] where she met a group of adventurers who later became the town's heroes. She left Skull Crag humming an old amazonian tune and went on her way before the troubles in the area really began.
