        "History": "The Reaper was a kensai retainer of the [[Ito family]] who died in their castle's burning in [[647 DR]]. Thanks to the ''[[ancient curse]]'' and a [[Krakentua (Ito-jo)|krakentua]]'s influence, he did not truly die, but continued to haunt the castle as the first of the seven weapon masters. Finally, in 1360 DR, an adventuring party hired by [[Michimori Uemon]] to recover the Seven Swords fought and destroyed him."
