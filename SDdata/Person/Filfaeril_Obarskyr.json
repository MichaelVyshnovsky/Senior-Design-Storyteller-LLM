        "mainbody": "Queen Filfaeril Selazair Obarskyr, n√©e Filfaeril Selazair, was the queen of Cormyr and wife of King Azoun IV during the 14 century DR.\nFilfaeril had ice-blue eyes and silky, golden blonde hair, like honey, which reached her waist. Her figure was slender and she had pale skin. with a symmetric face, high cheekbones, and an upper lip that had the shape of a bow. \nAccording to one courtier of Cormyr she possessed a look that was sharper than any dagger.\nFilfaeril stood at . \nThe was a brilliant and intuitive individual who always voiced her opinion. She was not overbearing, maintained the regal grace befitting her role in the Cormyrean court. She demonstrated heroic patience throughout her years, a trait that stood in contrast to her oft-contentious husband and daughter Alusiar.\nWhile Filfaeril had a strong will of her own, she tended towards introspection during her youth. She often thought long about what she wanted most, and discreetly made subtle actions and minor manipulations to fulfill those wants.\nShe had two older sisters Avraele and Narlneeme.\nFilfaerils husband was King Azoun IV. Azoun was drawn to her more for her extremely sharp mind rather than her beauty, and trusted her as his truest confidant and discerning advisor. It was said Azoun kept no secrets from his queen they were entirely open about their individual lovers, and partners they would share together. Kin\nQueen Filfaeril had a personal advisory relationship with Khelben Arunsun of Waterdeep. She often sought his council on matters of the spellcasters of the north, in secrecy from any scrying wizard that might be spying on her, including Vangerdahast Aeiulvana, the Royal Wizard. She communicated with Blackstaff via a cracked overgrown enchanted lion statue in the Royal Gardens.\nShe enjoyed true and loyal relationships with several of Cormyrs Lady Lords, including Myrmeen Lhal of Arabel and Tessaril Winter of Eveningstar.\nFilfaeril founded a small secretive band of loyal agents, known as her Blades. These agents helped conduct her more informal diplomatic missions, which often involved working alongside fellow Harpers, including some of Mystras chosen. The queens Blades remained willing to slay and die in her memory after her death.\nFee was an exceptional rider and serviceable archer. Her true skill was demonstrated by her prowess wielding a sword and dagger in melee combat, or using throwing knives when facing foes at range.\nFilfaeril wore a Royal Cormyrian signet ring which allowed the Royal Magician of Cormyr, Vangerdahast, to know her location and communicate with her via telepathy.\nThe Queen owned an enchanted amulet that protected her from the scrying spell and similar magical  ways of spying on someone.\nFilfaeril carried a silver-mounted body flask and a razer-sharp hairpin enchanted with death magic.\nUnbeknownst to her husband, Filfaeril was involved with the Harpers and acted as an agent on their behalf in Cormyr, regularly meeting with Dove Falconhand.\nShe was skilled at chess and was a published writer. Her book, Thoughts from a Throne, was first put to print in 1379 DR.\nFilfaeril was born Filfaeril Selazair on Mirtul 4, 1311 DR, the last member of House Selazair, a minor noble Cormyrean family. Her father was none other than Elminster, the famous sage of Shadowdale. Fee was a small child who was especially intelligent for her age, one that would be considered an \"old soul\". In her youth, Fee was personally tutored in numerous disciplines, including riding, martial combat, military tactics, and strategic gaming.\nFor a time she ran the familys beer business, while also conducting business with the Harpers. It was during that time that she first attracted the attention of Azoun. He knew early in their courtship that Filfaeril was the life partner he had sought for some time.\nAlthough Filfaeril bore Azoun a son, Foril Obarskyr on Mirtul 1, 1332 DR, the prince was assassinated by the Fire Knives on Uktar 11, 1334 DR. This was an event that the Queen never fully recovered from.\nWhen Azoun was brought near death by the abraxus incident in 1369 DR, it was rumored that Filfaeril was so stricken with grief that she was taken away to the Spires of the Morning in Eveningstar. This was not true, as she had withdrawn to the Hidden Chambers in the royal palace in Suzail. A flight of flying daggers and helmed horrors was unleashed into the private apartment in Eveningstar where the queen was supposed to be staying, killing four Purple Dragon knights and under priests guarding the war wizardess who was posing as the queen.\nFilfaeril assumed the appearance of merchants wife Aglarra Galdekund in order to hide in Waterdeep during the abraxus affair. The change in mannerisms and voice was blamed on an illness, that the couple had to travel to Iritues Firesprings in southern Amn in order to address. Filfaerils appearance at that time was changed to become short and masculine, with a pot belly and a large, pimpled chin.\nDuring the rule of her daughter, Alusair the Steel Regent, Queen Fee remained in court and offered her skills as a diplomat to best aide the Forest Kingdom. Queen Filfaeril remained the true ruler of Cormyr for a period of five years, from 1379 to 1384 DR, ending with the birth of her grandson, Azoun Obarskyr V. Filfaeril enjoyed complete and well-deserved authority in court as monarch, while Alusair as regent was seen as the \"hero\" among of the realm.\nThe dark mage Manshoon once commissioned a lewd chapbook entitled Filfaeril Bound and Willing in an attempt to publicly shame and discredit Queen Fees reputation."
