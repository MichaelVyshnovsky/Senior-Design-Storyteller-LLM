'''Rakor''' was a [[black dragon]] who dwelled in the [[Evermoors]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}

==Relationships==
Rakor had dealings with the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

==History==
[[File:Rakor.png|thumb|right|350px|''Rakor dives right in.'']]
''Circa'' [[1400 DR]],<ref group="note">The battle is undated but is "a century ago" from the date of ''Honor Among Thieves'', which is itself undated but assumed to be the late 1490s DR. The {{yearlinkName|1402}}, is a likely candidate. Rakor and a Cult of the Dragon army battled a force of the [[Uthgardt]] [[Elk tribe]] for control of the ''[[helmet of disjunction]]'', a relic with the power to break all [[magic]]. In the conflict known as the [[Battle of the Evermoors]], the Elk warriors outnumbered the Dragon Cultists, but Rakor more than made up for that by flying overhead and vomiting [[acid]] on the barbarians' ranks. Stanhard ordered a retreat and entrusted the helmet to his fastest rider, [[Ven Salafin]], to get it away from Rakor however he could, before the chief was dissolved as well.<ref> Ven passed it to [[Xenk Yendar]] as he too died,<ref group="note">It's unknown how and why the Elk tribe had the ''helmet of disjunction'', nor why Rakor and the Cult of the Dragon wanted it beyond its magical and monetary value. The product description for the Rakor Nerf blaster toy describes as Rakor as unleashing acid breath on adventures who dared challenge him or touch his treasure, which, though standard procedure for dragons, is perhaps meant to imply the Elk tribe stole the Helmet from his hoard. This at least fits the Elk tribe's usual habits.
