==Description==
Eldgull was a [[human]] [[albino]] man and a hard worker who felt at home aboard a ship, more than he ever did on land.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the ''Wicked Wench'' was among several ships that carried reinforcements of mercenaries and adventurers from the city of [[Luskan]] to [[Targos]], to aid the town's defense against the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. Eldgull was working aboard the ship at the time and befriended the group of adventurers who would later become the heroes of the [[Ten-Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].
