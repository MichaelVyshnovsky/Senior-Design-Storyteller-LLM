Pelandro Rahavillar was the shipwright who ran Pelandros Peerless Shipyards of Teziir on the Dragon Coast in the late 15 century DR.
Pelandro was a handsome, flamboyant womanizer, and a romantic who had six wives. The aging shipwright carried a cane and his personality bore a wistful nostalgia.
By the late 15 century DR, Pelandros shipyards were known for building old-fashioned naval battle caravels that could be used as warships and merchants vessels.
