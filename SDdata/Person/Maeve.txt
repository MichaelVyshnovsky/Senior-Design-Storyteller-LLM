'''Maeve''' was a [[half-elven]] Feloguard that stood watch over the "special" clients of [[Felogyr's Fireworks]] shop in [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Maeve had a blush, fair skin, and hazel eyes. She wore her light brown hair tightly gathered into a bun.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] planted its roots in Baldur's Gate and ravaged the [[Western Heartlands]], Felogyr's Fireworks shop fell under the cult's sway. Its proprietor, [[Avery Sonshal]], was made into a [[True Soul]] and used the shop as a front for the cult's terrorist activities. During that time, Maeve was employed as a Feloguard, standing guard of the shop's second floor and its clerk Tamara, who serviced "friends of Felogyr," selling them the shop's more dangerous weaponized stock, like bombs and ''[[smokepowder arrow]]s''. Maeve knowingly or unknowingly also guarded the shop's third floor that was off-limits to all but the [[Banite]] members of the Cult of the Absolute.
