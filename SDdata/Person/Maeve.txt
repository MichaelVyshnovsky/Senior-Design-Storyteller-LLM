Maeve was a half-elven Feloguard that stood watch over the "special" clients of Felogyrs Fireworks shop in Baldurs Gate in late 15 century DR.
Maeve had a blush, fair skin, and hazel eyes. She wore her light brown hair tightly gathered into a bun.
In the , as the Cult of the Absolute planted its roots in Baldurs Gate and ravaged the Western Heartlands, Felogyrs Fireworks shop fell under the cults sway. Its proprietor, Avery Sonshal, was made into a True Soul and used the shop as a front for the cults terrorist activities. During that time, Maeve was employed as a Feloguard, standing guard of the shops second floor and its clerk Tamara, who serviced "friends of Felogyr," selling them the shops more dangerous weaponized stock, like bombs and smokepowder arrows. Maeve knowingly or unknowingly also guarded the shops third floor that was off-limits to all but the Banite members of the Cult of the Absolute.
