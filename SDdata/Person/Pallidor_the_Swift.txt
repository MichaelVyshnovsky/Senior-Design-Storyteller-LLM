Pallidor the Swift was a wood elf storyteller from the Wood of Sharp Teeth.
Palidor was considered one of the more venerable elves of his community, and his stories were held in high esteem. It took him some time to build trust and share his stories with outsiders.
At some point, Pallidor was interviewed for and his story included in the book Oral Histories of Faer√ªn. He shared the tale of the ancient war between the gith and illithids, where the gith earned their freedom from the illithid empire.
