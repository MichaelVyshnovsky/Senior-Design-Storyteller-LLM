A year later, a young priest of Chauntea named Larn came across the abandoned winery. He restored the vineyard and resumed its wine production. During that time, he befriended a duo of fun-loving satyrs, Quellonis and Harmon. The two fey were regular guests of Larns, tasting new wines, singing songs, and playing music late into the night.\nHowever, that friendship was cut abruptly when the medusa mage named Samanthiss and her consort, the maedar Vorlon, found the winery and decided to take over. Larn was petrified by the medusa, while Vorlon assumed the identity of the vintner. The couple continued operating the winery for the following decade. Vorlon showed remorse over Larns fate but came to love winemaking. Larns stone body was kept in good condition if the medusas ever needed food.\nThe satyrs soon realized what had happened but could not challenge the powerful monsters openly. Quellonis and Harmon decided to bide their time, spy on the medusas, and plan revenge. Circa the , a group of adventurers was tasked with investigating the winery, and their investigation led the group into a harpy ambush. The friendly satyrs interrupted the harpies charm songs with a song of their own played on magic pipes. The friendly satyrs told the heroes everything they uncovered about the winery and its slithering masters. Subsequently, the satyrs information aided the heroes in either slaying the inhabitants of the winery or forging a business relationship, freeing Larn from his petrified state."
