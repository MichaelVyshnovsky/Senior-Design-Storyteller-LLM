'''Firble''' was a [[svirfneblin]] councilor of [[Schnicktick|King Schnicktick]] in [[Blingdenstone]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He also had secret dealings with [[Jarlaxle]], who traded information with him.

==Description==
The [[deep gnome]] had stubby fingers and was going bald. Firble stood about {{SI|3'6"|ft-in}} tall and weighed around {{SI|80|lb|k}}.

==Personality==
Firble could be impatient, and though he feared Jarlaxle, he was willing to press the [[mercenary]] for information, even if the [[drow]] pressed back. The deep gnome hated all types of light sources, including torchlight.

==Possessions==
Instead of wearing metal armor, Firble dressed in long smooth [[robe]]s.

==History==
Around [[1357 DR]], Firble grew more and more suspicious and fearful of the [[drow]] creeping around in the [[Underdark]]. After "prompting" from [[Belwar Dissengulp]], Firble agreed to escort [[Catti-brie]] to the drow city of [[Menzoberranzan]].

===Death===
After the [[Battle of Keeper's Dale]], Belwar Dissengulp carried Firble's body away from the battlefield.
