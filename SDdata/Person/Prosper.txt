Prosper was a tiefling warlock and adventurer on the Sword Coast.
Prospers motivation for adventuring was to amass wealth and power.
The focal point of his powers was his Book of Shadows, which contained his greatest secrets and that was protected from prying eyes by several gruesome curses.
He was part of an adventuring troupe with the elven paladin Galea, the human wizard Sefris, and the dragonborn barbarian Vrondiss.
Prosper claimed to have gained his warlock powers after winning a bet with an ancient and powerful being that he would not name.
