Yarjack Blamreld was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
He flung loose hairs from his beard when deep in thought. He felt he was getting in on years.
His beard was scraggly, and he had a bulbous nose.
Presumably, he had abilities to divine something about dead bodies.
He was known by name to Glathra Barcantle.
He was a War Wizard.
In the wake of the violence that erupted during the Council of the Dragon, Glathra Barcantle wanted to make sure Lareikaun and Yarjack Blamreld checked the bodies of the lords that died during the attempt on King Foril Obarskyr Is life.
He was later commanding the War Wizards who sought to capture Marlin Stoneserpent, whose mission swiftly turned to rescuing the people at Stormserpent Towers. Through the aftermath, he took note of the character of a freshly recruited War Wizard, Caldor Raventree, who reported to him, and coordinated with a number of priests and Purple Dragon troops.
