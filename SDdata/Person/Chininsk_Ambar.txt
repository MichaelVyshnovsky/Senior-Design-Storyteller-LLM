'''Chininsk Ambar''' was a [[cleric]] who stayed in [[Phoenix (city)|Phoenix]] to the last. He owned a house full of follies, and was served by [[El-Tarifa]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|91}}

==Overview==
Chininsk Ambar may have been amongst the priests that cursed [[Krinos Pandipolous]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|92}} However, he stayed to the last in the city of Phoenix.

His house included a number of follies, such as a counter-intuitive door, a fake wall on his library, a fake deathtrap, and a ballroom that forced people traversing it to dance in order to safely cross. He stayed in it to the end, accompanied by his majordomo, [[El-Tarifa]]: an [[aerial servant]] of exceptional loyalty.
