'''Torrin Ironstar''', or '''Daffyd Raltin''', was a [[human]] [[adventurer]] and a member of the [[Order of Delvers]] from [[Eartheart]].{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle}}{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|243}}

==History==
===Early Life===	
Torrin was born Daffyd Raltin{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|480}} to human shopkeepers in the town of [[Hammergate]] just outside Eartheart. As a young boy, Torrin helped around his parents' shop. When Torrin was seven, the shop was robbed and Torrin picked up a magical dwarven [[mace]], activated the magic and killed the robber, something that only a dwarf was supposedly able to do. Even though his father consulted a [[loremaster]] who claimed that non-dwarves could use magical dwarven weapons,{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|1327}} Torrin's use of the mace lead to his lifelong belief that he was really [[Morndin|a reincarnated dwarf]] of the extinct [[Ironstar]] clan. At some point, Torrin left his parents and moved into Eartheart proper where he was adopted by the [[Thunsonn]] clan.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|633}}

===Stoneplague===
In the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Torrin traveled into the [[Underdark]] to purchase a [[teleportation]] rune from a shady dwarf. The dwarf had a strange condition that made his skin look like dried mud and his eyes like white marbles.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|160}}

Shortly afterward, his young nephew [[Kier Thunsonn|Kier]] stole a [[griffon]] from Eartheart's griffon pens and rode to an [[earthmote]] drifting over the [[East Rift]]. Torrin followed Kier and together they found a cache of [[gold]] bars in a cave.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|821}} Although they were unable to loot the cache, the city guard retrieved the stash. The bars were contaminated with the [[Stoneplague]], which was unleashed on Eartheart.<ref>{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|?}}

Torrin deduced that the contaminated gold was the source of the Stoneplague. He used his teleportation rune to teleport to [[Eralynn Thunsonn]] in the dwarven city of [[Sundasz]].{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|2621}} While in Sundasz, Torrin was able to trick several of the dwarves who made the tainted gold bars into meeting him. After a fight, he interrogated one of the dwarves and learned the gold came from Moradin's [[Moradin's Vein|River of Gold]], which had been cursed by the [[duergar]] of [[Drik Hargunen]] through the use of [[rune magic]]. Torrin reported this information to the Council of Eartheart but they declined to allow him to go along on the raid to destroy the duergar magic.<ref>{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|?}}

Instead, Torrin teleported into Drik Hargunen and discovered the rune magic inside a giant [[geode]]. Torrin was able to destroy the magic with the help of several raiders from Eartheart. Torrin, however, was killed by the destruction of the rune magic.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|4358}}

After his death, his soul journeyed to [[Moradin]]'s realm and the god allowed Torrin to be reincarnated as a dwarf in honor of his service to the dwarven people. Decades later, Torrin was reincarnated as Kier's son.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|4441}}

==Personality==
Although Torrin was undeniably reincarnated by Moradin as a dwarf decades after his death, it was unknown whether his belief that he had a dwarven soul in his human body was correct.<ref>{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|?}}

==Relationships==
Torin was a close friend of [[Eralynn Thunsonn]] and several other members of the Thunsonn clan. He was considered an uncle to Kier Thunsonn. He had a frosty relationship with his human parents and rarely visited them.<ref>{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|?}}

==Equipment==
Torrin carried a magical dwarven mace and used goggles that allowed him to see in the dark.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|156}} He also carried the standard issue Delvers' magic backpack, which only he could open.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|960}}

==Description==
Torrin had a full red beard with silver hammers tied to the braids.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|300}}
