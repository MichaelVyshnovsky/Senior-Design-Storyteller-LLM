        "mainbody": "The Camber Fosrick stories were well known in Cormyr, even in the farming town of [[Ghars]], in the mid-1360s DR, with many people familiar enough with them to reference them in conversation or use \"Camber Fosrick\" as a byword for a skilled detective, such as Captain [[Flim]] and [[Lukas Spoondrift]].\n\nThe servant [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] loved the thrilling tales, complex plots, and the character of Camber Fosrick himself. He even compared Fosrick's approach to the concepts discussed in ''[[Thought and Its Processes]]''. Jasper occasionally fancied himself as being like Camber Fosrick when monitoring goings-on in the [[Bold Bard]] tavern,<ref> tracking footprints, or needing to bolster his courage. The Camber Fosrick stories would in fact be his only training and basis for investigating the murders of [[Dovo]] and [[Grodoveth]] on behalf of his master Benelaius in [[Eleint]] of 1367 DR.\n\nThe young [[War Wizard]] [[Lindavar]] was also well-read in the Fosrick tales and quoted them to others.\n\nHowever, [[Benelaius]], a retired War Wizard, scholar, and part-time consulting cogitator himself, derided the Camber Fosrick stories as \"drivel\" and \"tripe\" that would rot the readers' brains if they weren't already rotted enough to want to read them in the first place. The Ghars library, curated by [[Phelos Marmwitz]], did not stock any of the Camber Fosrick books, but only \"serious literature\".\n\nNevertheless, a copy of ''The Adventures of Camber Fosrick'' was kept in no less than the great temple-library of [[Candlekeep]] by [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "In the stories, Camber Fosrick was a \"great consulting cogitator\" who solved various crimes and mysteries such as smuggling, robberies, and murders, typically with elaborate and exciting plots. His approach focused on logic, deductive reasoning, and putting together apparently unrelated clues to come to a rational conclusion. and playing tricks. For example, to prove a man was a murderer, Fosrick suddenly threw a ball at him, which he caught in his allegedly unusable left hand (Jasper found this did not work nearly so well in practice). The stories often culminated in Fosrick assembling all the suspects in one place, laying out the facts, and revealing the culprit.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = A brave and steadfast heart can overcome any fear.\n| source = Camber Fosrick\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nFosrick was portrayed as courageous and gallant, the kind of man who'd laugh at [[ghost]]s.",
        "Bibliography": "Camber Fosrick stories were published in installments in certain cheap journals and gathered into collections. Fans who came to the series later purchased second-hand issues to collect unread stories, but might find themselves with part 3 of 4 not knowing how it began, let alone how it ended.\n\nOne Camber Fosrick publication was ''[[The Adventures of Camber Fosrick]]'', an anthology of six short stories, including \"The Adventure of the Battledale Billhook\".",
        "History": "Camber Fosrick was created by Lodevin Parkar, a scribe of Cormyr. The Camber Fosrick stories were in publication through [[1365 DR]].\n\nNew stories were still being published around [[1367 DR]] and were well known around Cormyr at the time.",
