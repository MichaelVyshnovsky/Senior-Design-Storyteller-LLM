'''Muzlim''' was a small lap [[dog]] belonging to [[Mayella Meadowbrock]] of the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
{{fq
| text   = Muzlim, what's wrong with you? The nice man only wanted to pet you. I'm sorry, Mayor Tobald, I don't know what came over him.
| source = Mayella to Muzlim
| float  = 
| width  = 
}}
Mayella took Muzlim with her when she went out with her father, the merchant [[Barthelm Meadowbrock]], to the [[Bold Bard]] tavern on [[Eleint 16]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}. However, Muzlim growled and snapped at Mayor [[Tobald]] and Mayella chided the dog. Later, Muzlim was frightened by [[Dovo]] the blacksmith's assistant when he came to pester Mayella, when Dovo and Rolf brawled, and Mayella carried the fearful dog out under her arm.

==Personality==
Although yappy, Muzlim turned out to be a very good judge of character.
