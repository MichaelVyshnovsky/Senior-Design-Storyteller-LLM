'''Yampa''' was the name of a [[water buffalo]] that was considered holy in the [[Padhran religion]].

Yampa carried the [[Enlightened One]] to "the realms of perfection"

By the midâ€“14th century [[DR]], a room called the Hall of the Water Buffalo lay within the [[Horseshoe Temple]] in the [[Quoya Desert]]. It housed a large statue of Yampa.
