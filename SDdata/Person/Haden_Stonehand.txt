'''Haden Stonehand''' was a [[bloodforge]] mage operating out of the [[Serpent Valley]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

Haden Stonehand was a hardy soul who made a home in the harsh Serpent Valley. The leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]], who aimed to unify the Utter East through conquest, came to challenge Haden in a contest of bloodforge warfare.
