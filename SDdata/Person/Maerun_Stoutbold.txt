'''Maerun Stoutbold''' was a merchant in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]] around [[1367 DR]]. He ran a shipbuilding company out of both Suzail and [[Marsember]] that dealt in the repair and sale of ships, nets, and masts.

==History==
He had not been found to have broken the law but he was well known to be the person to speak to for silent passage on a ship. Although Maerun was caught by a [[War Wizards|War Wizard]] with two bound females, he hired a [[Sembia]]n mage to claim they were creatures [[Polymorph (spell)|polymorphed]] into [[human]] form for safe transportation. Maerun spent his winters in Marsember.
