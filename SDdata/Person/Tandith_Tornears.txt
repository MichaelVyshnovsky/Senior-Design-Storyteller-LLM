'''Tandith Tornears''', also known as '''Tandi Earsgone''', was an [[Oni mage|ogre mage]] who lived within the [[Forest of Amtar]] in [[Dambrath]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1373}}. 

==Activities==
Tornears led a raider band made up of [[human]]s, [[half-orc]]s and [[orc]]s and would attack travelers on the road between [[Channathgate]] and the [[Landrise]]. Most of their loot was taken from [[gold dwarves]] from the [[Great Rift]]. The town of [[Three Swords]] hunted Tandith and his bandits, to no avail.
