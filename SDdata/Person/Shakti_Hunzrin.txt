'''Shakti Hunzrin''' was a powerful traitor-priestess of [[Lolth]] and [[Vhaeraun]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She hated [[Liriel Baenre]], pursuing her across [[Faerun]] and trying to kill her several times, but she was not successful. 

==Description==
Shakti was solid by drow standards, even plump, and had hard red eyes. She was nearsighted from birth, but in [[1361 DR]] she was able to heal herself by the power of Lolth and Vhaeraun. During her time in the [[Abyss]], she was reshaped and became lithe and more attractive, which was noted with surprise by [[Gromph Baenre]].<ref>

==Personality==
Shakti had no sense of humor.

Shakti's greatest passion was [[rothé]] farming—she was in charge of [[House Hunzrin]]'s rothé herds on the [[Isle of Rothe]] in [[Lake Donigarten]]. In fact, she initially didn't want to be a priestess, but she appreciated the power it gave her.

==Possessions==
Shakti's weapon of choice, like that of her family, was an enchanted [[pitchfork]], although she later relied more on her snake-headed whip conferred upon her when she became a high priestess. All the snake heads from her whip died in her confrontation with Liriel and later deteriorated to bones, but they were enchanted as [[undead]] snakes and functioned as the regular whip of a high priestess.<ref> These snakes could also go hunt on their own.{{fact}}

==Relationships==
Shakti allied herself with many others in her pursuit of Liriel, including [[Matron Mother]] [[Triel Baenre]], [[Gromph Baenre]], [[Nisstyre]] and the [[Dragon's Hoard]], the [[illithid]] [[Vestress]] of [[Ascarle]], [[High Captain]] [[Rethnor]] of [[Luskan]], and [[Gorlist]].

She had an [[oni]] bodyguard named [[Korokai]].

==History==
While seeking revenge against her rival Liriel, Shakti approached [[Nisstyre]], a known follower of Vhaeraun, and offered to become a "traitor priestess" serving both Lolth and Vhaeraun and offering her services to Nisstyre. She placed a magic [[ruby]] on Nisstryre's forehead, allowing her to see through it, speak with Nisstryre and even to mentally harm him. She monitored his activities with it until his demise at Liriel's hands.{{fact}}

In {{YearlinkName|1361}}, Shakti was ordained a high priestess, despite not having completed all her years at [[Arach-Tinilith]]. She was tasked with returning Liriel to Menzoberrazan, which prompted her alliance with [[Rethnor]] and the [[Kraken Society]]. After failing to capture Liriel, she met her again in [[Ascarle]], where she challenged her to a ''[[nai'shedareth]]'', but Liriel swiftly dispatched her by sending her into the Abyss. She would wander amidst the mists, defending herself from [[demon]]s and [[incubus|incubi]] until a [[yochlol]] appeared before her. She gave her a ''[[piwafwi]]'', a soul bubble, a [[spider silk]] dress, and enchanted her [[whip]], bringing it back as an [[undead]] weapon. Then they took a ''[[portal]]'' back to the Material Plane.<ref>

After her sojourn in the Abyss, she went back to Menzoberrazan, where she told [[Triel Baenre]] of her failure to retrieve Liriel, but showing her that she still had the favor of Lolth. She also allied with Gromph Baenre, telling him that Liriel died and that she could take her place as an informant and ally. Everyone showed her much more respect and deference after her return. With her older sister dead of a wasting disease, in which she may have been involved, she became the eldest daughter, who would become matron mother one day.<ref>

Being tasked with Liriel's return to Menzoberrazan, she employed the [[Dragon's Hoard]], now under [[Gorlist]], who was obsessed with killing Liriel. They tracked her down to [[Rashemen]], where they confronted the forces of Rashemen and those of [[Eilistraee]] in a fight that led to Liriel healing the bond between the land and the spirits, but leaving the link between the magic of the Underdark and the surface untouched, thus allowing magic from the Underdark to be used in the Land Above. Shakti killed [[Ysolde Veladorn|Ysolde]] during the fight and escaped the priestesses of Eilistraee. She then finally faced Liriel, who repeated her refusal to go back to Menzoberrazan. Liriel gave her the [[Windwalker (artifact)|Windwalker]] (now spent and useless) and a [[wychlaran]]'s mask, allowing Shakti to appear as Liriel and avoiding House Baenre's prying eyes on the surface. She finally left without violence, alleging that if she could overcome drow's uncontrolled hate, she could be anyone's equal.<ref>

Shakti became Matron Mother of House Hunzrin in the {{YearlinkName|1412}} and began exerting control over the day-to-day essential resources of Menzoberranzan.<ref>

By the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, Shakti was strongly allied with [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]].
