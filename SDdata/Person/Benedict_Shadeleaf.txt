'''Benedict Shadeleaf''' was a [[rogue]] that worked for [[Company Yargo]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was an associate of a certain [[unnamed cloaked man]] that operated in the city of [[Neverwinter]].

==History==
When the leaders of Company Yargo announced their planned expedition to [[Pirates' Skyhold]] aboard ''[[Buccaneer's Tear]]''in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Benedict was the first person to volunteer his services as a scout. Having some knowledge about the code system utilized by [[Bartholomew Blackdagger]], he was eager to get his hands on the infamous Pirate King's personal ledgers. 

He worked with an [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|adventurer]] from Neverwinter to recover these documents from within the [[earthmote|flying isle]]'s [[Pirates' Skyhold#Notable Locations|Market Square]], along with one of Blackdagger's remaining intact treasure chests. Without revealing what exactly was stashed away inside, Benedict arranged for them to be sent over to his contact in the Jewel of the North.
