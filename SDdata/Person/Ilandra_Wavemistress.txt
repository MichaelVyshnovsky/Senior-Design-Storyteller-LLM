Ilandra was a woman with deeply tanned skin and long, greenish-black hair. She usually dressed in a sea-green tunic, with leggings of the same color, and a cape colored deep aqua.
Ilandra was a charismatic leader and a good sailor. She hated Hillsfar for its racist policies and always harassed ships of that city.
Ilandra was bullied and driven out of Hillsfar for her half-elven heritage, and so she gathered some like-minded people and decided to go into piracy in order to get revenge on the societies that spited them. She become a very good pirate. Her ship was the Mingledblood.
