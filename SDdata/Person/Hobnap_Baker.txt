'''Hobnap Baker''' was a member of prominent [[hin]] [[Baker chaka]] of [[Durpar]] and the leader of the only [[Thieves' Guild (Shining Lands)|Thieves' Guild]] of the [[Shining Lands]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Despite his profession, Hobnap Baker lacked the greed that was so often prevalent among members of the thieves' guilds. He did, however, appreciate the challenge of the profession. Hobnap established honorable laws within the guild, demanding that the poor never be touched by their fellow thieves. Even though not every member was willing to comply.

==Possessions==
He was a wealthy hin who was always armed with his [[enchanted]] ''+2'' [[dagger]].

==History==
Hobnap created his guild on a dare. Everyone said a thieves' guild could not exist in the Shining Lands, and the halfling loved a good challenge. During his career, Hobnap pulled a multitude of high-profile heists that garnered him more notoriety than he was comfortable with. At one point in the {{YearlinkName|1367}} Hobnap pulled one of the most notorious stunts â€“ he snuck into a [[Council of Merchants]]' meeting in [[Heldapan]] and acquired some invaluable intel, later sold to the highest bidder. The information leak became public, and the Council placed a heft reward on the perpetrator's head. If Hobnap Baker were ever discovered, his entire fortune and everything he's ever owned would be confiscated by the Durpari government. Being rich, the halfling, and no interest in being discovered and captured. If the existence of the gild were ever to be uncovered, the Durpari were to surely turn over every stone in an attempt to squash the organization. If that were to pass, Hobnap Baker would be long gone back in [[Luiren]].
