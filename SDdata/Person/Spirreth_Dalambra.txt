'''Spirreth Dalambra''' was a drow [[mage]] retainer of [[House Freth]] in the [[Troglodyte Warrens]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
Spirreth was the second-in-command of the Freth troops in the Troglodyte Warrens, under his master [[Beranica Freth]]. They battled the [[House Auvryndar]] army. However, in [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Beranica was killed by some [[demon]]s and Spirreth assumed total command. He was supported by two summoned [[chasme]] in the middle of a ferocious battle with Auvryndar troops. If nobody intervened, Spirreth lost the day and escaped alone.

==Personality==
Spirreth had the task of reporting the death of Beranica to her older sister [[Erelal Freth]]; in a desperate ploy, he hoped to send to her some strangers and accuse them of being Beranica's killers.
