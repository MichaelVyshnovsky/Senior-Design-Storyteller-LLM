Spirreth Dalambra was a drow mage retainer of House Freth in the Troglodyte Warrens in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Spirreth was the second-in-command of the Freth troops in the Troglodyte Warrens, under his master Beranica Freth. They battled the House Auvryndar army. However, in 1492 DR, Beranica was killed by some demons and Spirreth assumed total command. He was supported by two summoned chasme in the middle of a ferocious battle with Auvryndar troops. If nobody intervened, Spirreth lost the day and escaped alone.
Spirreth had the task of reporting the death of Beranica to her older sister Erelal Freth in a desperate ploy, he hoped to send to her some strangers and accuse them of being Beranicas killers.
