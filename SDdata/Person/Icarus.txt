'''Icarus''' was a veteran [[Elf|elven]] admiral and also the captain of the [[Armada (spelljammer)|armada]] ''[[Arrow of Justice]]'' in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Icarus was known to be a colorful individual.

==Personality==

His experience in over fifteen battles had conferred him an unyielding integrity.

One of Icarus's interests was to reactivate the haunted derelict elven base orbiting [[Karpri]].

==Activities==
Icarus worked exclusively in [[Realmspace]]. On top of his command of the ''Arrow of Justice'', he also commanded an elven [[Spelljammer|spelljamming]] fleet consisting of the following vessels:
* 7 [[Armada (spelljammer)|armadas]];
* 1 [[monarch armada]];
* 50 [[flitter]]s;
* 12 [[Man-o-war|men-o-war]];
* 1 [[radiant ship]];
* 5 [[eel ship]]s.

==History==
In the early days of the [[War of the Spheres]], Icarus's armada had intercepted several [[vodoni]] attacks, but always too late to be of any help. In one such attempt, the ship intercepted a group of adventurers with valuable information on the vodoni. The ''Arrow of Justice'' promptly escorted them to the [[Rock of Bral]] to participate in the first meeting of the [[Free Space Alliance]] in order to assess the threat of a vodoni invasion.

The ''Arrow of Justice'' also served as the Alliance flagship throughout the war and in the final battle against the Vodoni.
