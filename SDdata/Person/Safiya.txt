'''Safiya''' was a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and one of the companions of the [[Kalach-Cha]].

==Activities==
Unlike many Red Wizards, Safiya was uninterested in struggling for power, and preferred scholarly research and practice of [[arcane magic]]. Safiya was interested in magic that transformed and creating [[construct]]s. She worked as an instructor at the [[Academy of Shapers and Binders]], of which her mother [[Nefris]] was the headmistress.

==Personality==
She appeared shy on the rare occasions when she smiled, apparently for lack of practice. Yet she had mental resilience from her upbringing in Thay. The Kalach-Cha inferred that her somewhat sheltered upbringing as the headmistress's daughter might have had something to do with her being "less ruthless" than other Red Wizards.

==Description==
Safiya had golden-hued skin, delicate features, and almond-shaped dark eyes, and appeared beautiful to most eyes. She shaved her head bald, for it was adorned with the fine tattoos of a Red Wizard.

==Relations==
Safiya had a [[homunculus]] [[familiar]] named [[Kaji]]. It was one of her first creations and she was quite fond of it.

==Abilities==
As a [[wizard]], Safiya was specialized in the school of [[transmutation]] (and restricted from both [[conjuration]] and [[illusion]]). As a [[transmuter]], she was dedicated to building and shaping objects, and was skilled at crafting enchanted weaponry and armaments.
