        "mainbody": "Gaurin was an imp who also was Jesanta Berils familiar in the mid-late 14 century DR.\nA favourite tactic of the imp and his mistress was to have him touch targets while carrying her harm spell.\nCuriously, Gaurin wasnt known to be evil.\nJesanta Beril bound Gaurin after learning how to bind demons from Fareeansis, then disguised as an old sage named Benedict Jesanta named the imp after her late tutor in the Art. Curiously, Gaurin wasnt a demon but a devil."
