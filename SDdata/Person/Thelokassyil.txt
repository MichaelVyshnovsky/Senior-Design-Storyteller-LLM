Thelokassyil was a sahuagin baron, who advised King Ixilthetocal.
The baron was very xenophobic, hating outsiders. He believed that non-sahuagin humanoids were no more worthy than crab meat, and were only useful for consumption or sacrifices.
The baron fought with three main weapons a quarterstaff, a spear and a crossbow. The crossbow was loaded with poisonous bolts of biting.
Old sahuagin tales told of outsiders who would decide the fate of the City of Caverns. Gorions Ward may have arrived in the city with his adventuring party, and the baron advised his monarch to kill them.
