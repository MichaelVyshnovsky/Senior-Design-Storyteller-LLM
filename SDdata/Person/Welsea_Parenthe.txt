Welsea normally stuck to the shadows, but when forced by circumstances to go into the open, she tried to conceal her features. She spoke clearly, carefully, and quietly, never raising her voice. Welsea never discussed her [[undead]] condition.

==History==
Welsea one of the [[Zhent]] delegates in the resistance against [[Vorgansharax]]. She helped the [[Lord Sage of Phlan]] to send adventurers to explore [[Yarash]]'s pyramid.
