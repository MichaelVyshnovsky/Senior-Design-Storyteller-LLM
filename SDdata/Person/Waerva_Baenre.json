        "mainbody": "'''Waerva Baenre''' was a [[drow]] priestess of [[Lolth]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] and a member of [[House Baenre]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The priestess always wished to elevate her status in drow society. She often liked to get massages at the [[Silken Rack]].",
        "History": "During the [[Silence of Lolth]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Waerva sought to increase her power by framing the ambassador of [[Ched Nasad]], [[Faeryl Zauvirr]], with plotting against [[Matron Mother]] [[Triel Baenre]]. However, Faeryl managed to survive an assassination attempt ordered by Waerva, thanks to the aid of [[Bregan D'aerthe]], who'd been recruited by Triel to investigate the matter.<ref>\n\nFaeryl spoke to Triel, telling her that to end the Silence of Lolth they needed to ally Menzoberranzan and Ched Nasad. Triel agreed with Faeryl and vowed to find the person responsible for the false accusation against Faeryl.<ref> When Waerva discovered this, she tried to escape from Menzoberranzan, fearing the wrath of the matron mother. However, she was ambushed and presumably killed by some [[kobold]]s, former slaves who had escaped after [[Syrzan]]'s failed insurrection."
