'''Farad al-Meisal''' was a [[janni]] inhabiting the [[Ubar|Lost City of Ubar]] within the [[High Desert]] of [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

Farad served as Vizier to the Amir of Ubar. Since the Amir's health took a turn for the worse, Farad adopted the role of the de facto ruler of the city to ensure the daily needs of the city were met.
