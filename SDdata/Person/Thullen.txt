Thullen was the benevolent brother of the cloud giant countess Sansuri sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR He lived in Lyn Armaal with Sansuris family. Usually Thullen acted as babysitter of the children of Sansuri.
Thullen was in many ways the opposite of his sister, he disliked violence, was gentle and soft-spoken and not interested in gaining power or influence. However he made an oath to protect Sansuri. The only thing that made him truly angry was when others tried to harm his niece and nephew.
