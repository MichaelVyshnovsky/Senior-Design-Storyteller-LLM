        "mainbody": "Selvek Serelim was a merchant that operated alongside his brother Noohar on the Sword Coast during the late 15 century DR.\nHe had some form of mutism and communicated exclusively by means of sign language.\nSome time during the 1480s DR, Selvek and Noohar were transporting wooden carvings from the elves of Cormyr across the Sword Coast. Unbeknownst to them, the caravan they traveled with was full of agents of the Cult of the Dragon. The cultists were transporting wealth of riches they had stolen for use in a ritual that could summon their goddess Tiamat to the Realms."
