Dzunn was a merchant from the city of Sheirtalar in Lapaliiya in the 14 century DR.
Dzunn partnered with six other merchants—Alvund of Ormpetarr, Chond of Calaunt, Jhasso of Baldurs Gate, Nammna of Milvarune, Pomphur of Almraiven, and Shield of Everlund—to form the Seven Suns Trading Coster. The "Seven Suns" referred to the seven merchants themselves. Dzunns own small merchant company was converted into a regional base for the coster.
Dzunn and the Seven Suns were in business by 1358 DR, and still going by 1374 DR.
