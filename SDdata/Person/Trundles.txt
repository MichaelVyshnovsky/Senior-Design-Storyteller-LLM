LL. McV. Trundles or Doctor Trundles was a businessman in the Bloodstone Lands around 1357 DR and 1359 DR.
Doctor Trundles managed the Circus of Doctor Trundles, a collection of monsters.
In 1357 DR, Doctor Trundles took his circus to the Damaran city of Valls with his loyal assistant Tanaroo Quinson. However, a bulette freed itself and other monsters, and Trundles fainted in shock. Tanaroo hired some adventurers to capture the monsters before they killed someone.
In 1359 DR, after capturing new monsters, Trundles went back for a new tour in Impiltur with more security measures. Tanaroo acted as ringmaster with Trundles staying behind the scenes.
Trundles owned a wand of wonder.
Trundles always traveled with his loyal assistant Tanaroo Quinson.
