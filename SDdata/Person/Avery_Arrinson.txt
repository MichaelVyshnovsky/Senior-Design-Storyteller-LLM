Avery Arrinson was a proxy of Fenmarel Mestarine on Fennimar in Limbo.
He protected Fennimar from undesired creatures and aided travelers in the realm. He usually worked in secret, such as by stocking Fennimars waystations or disturbing aggressive wildlife to drive off invaders.
Averys native forest tribe was all but wiped out by orcs while he was out hunting alone. When he returned, the survivors made a scapegoat of him and banished him. He wandered until he found a portal to Sigil and used it to travel to Fennimar.
