Niro Longtooth was a brigand in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).
The oppressive Niro Longtooth extorted the folk of Vanesci Hamlet into giving up their food supplies, else the town would be raided. When the leader of the Legendary Campaign returned, with followers starving for food, the villagers had none to spare. The leader surprised Longtooth, confronting the bandits in a bloodforge battle in the streets and fields of the town.
