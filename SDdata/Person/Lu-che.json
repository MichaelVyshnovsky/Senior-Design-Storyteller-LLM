        "Activities": "Lu-che, training under Master [[Taembak Duahl]] in [[Shou Tu'lung]], earned a 6th-degree black belt in the [[Four Keys]] style of [[kung fu]].\n\nLu-che acted as the commander of the sohei detachment at the [[Temple of True Enlightenment]] in [[Suijeng]]. As was the custom of the temple, Lu-che and his men taught martial arts to local people for a modest fee. From this practice, Lu-che became known across the province as Sensei Lu-che.",
        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], Lu-che went to participate at the Komite, which was held on the grounds of his temple. He had many advantages by fighting in a familiar place and knowing well the tournament's rules, but many would expect his victory, putting Lu-che under tremendous pressure. Lu-che managed to finish among the tournament's finalists."
