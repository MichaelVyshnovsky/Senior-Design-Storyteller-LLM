        "mainbody": "onecarver was the village shaman of the Ice Hunters tribe that dwelled on the isle of Oyaviggaton as of the 1480s DR.\nThe shaman was not openly trusting and kept a discerning eye on anyone outside of her tribe. She understood that her people could not thrive under the heel of the white dragon Arauthator, and wished them to flee from Oyaviggation.\nBonecarver lived in a small yurt somewhat separated from the village, decorated with tokens to the tribes totem spirits and whalebone scrimshaw.\nShe would openly speak with anyone that was considered an ally or who had earned a place within their tribe. Unfortunately, she was compelled by Arauthator to poison some that ventured to their frozen island, and offered to the ice toads that dwelled in the caves within.\nBonecarver and the village chief Barking Seal spoke for their people whenever approached by outsiders.\nSome time in the 1480s DR, Barking Seal and Bonecarver greeted a band of adventurers from the Sword Coast at their village."
