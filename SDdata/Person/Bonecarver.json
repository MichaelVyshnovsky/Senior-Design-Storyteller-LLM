        "mainbody": "'''Bonecarver''' was the village [[shaman]] of the [[Ice Hunters]] tribe that dwelled on the isle of [[Oyaviggaton]] as of the 1480s [[DR]].{{ToD-time}}",
        "Personality": "The shaman was not openly trusting and kept a discerning eye on anyone outside of her tribe. She understood that her people could not thrive under the heel of the [[white dragon]] [[Arauthator]], and wished them to flee from Oyaviggation.",
        "Activities": "Bonecarver lived in a small yurt somewhat separated from the village, decorated with tokens to the tribe's totem spirits and whalebone scrimshaw.\n\nShe would openly speak with anyone that was considered an ally or who had earned a place within their tribe. Unfortunately, she was compelled by Arauthator to [[poison]] some that ventured to their frozen island, and offered to the [[ice toad]]s that dwelled in the caves within.",
        "Relationships": "Bonecarver and the village chief [[Barking Seal]] spoke for their people whenever approached by outsiders.",
        "History": "Some time in the 1480s DR, Barking Seal and Bonecarver greeted a band of adventurers from the [[Sword Coast]] at their village."
