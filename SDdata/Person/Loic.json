        "History": "In {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Halsin]] of the Emerald Grove offered safe haven to the [[tiefling]]s of [[Elturel]] who were exiled from their home city following [[the Descent]]. When the tiefling child [[Arabella]]tried to steal the ''[[idol of Silvanus]]'' from the grove's altar—thereby ensuring the tieflings could remain within the grove longer—the druids offered mixed responses among their members. Loic wished that the tieflings would leave voluntarily, as he felt the druids could no longer harbor their company."
