Baerann Kordeemur was a famous composer of Mulhessen, considered to be the most prestigious tunesmith of Sembia by some in the 15 century DR.
Baerann was a handsome, womanizing man with a white beard.
Baerann created many "court dances," popular among the nobles and the upper-crust societies throughout the Heartlands of Faer√ªn. His compositions were complex pieces of swelling music that regularly stopped for a mere beat before continuing on in a swirl of fantastic and bombastic melodies, only to stop and continue over and over again.
