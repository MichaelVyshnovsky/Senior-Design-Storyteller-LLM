        "Activities": "Within the city of Zazesspur, Jinjivar sold items such as magical [[hourglass]]es that flipped themselves back over and [[broom]]s that could sweep floors on their own.\n\nAs the longest member of the City Council in 1370 DR, Jinjivar was officially its leader; however, he often let Duchess [[Lucia Thione-Hhune]] override his decisions, since she was nobility. In addition to his role as Council lord, he also represented the district where he lived, the [[Zazesspur/High City/Carpets District|Carpets District]].\n\nFor unknown reasons, Jinjivar was often absent from the council and the city.",
        "Relationships": "Jinjivar claimed to be the son of a chieftain of nomads living in [[Calim Desert]] and a daughter of the [[pasha]]<ref group=\"note\">It is not clear whether his reference to \"the pasha\" was to Pasha [[Balik]], former ruler of Zazesspur, or to [[Syl-Pasha]] [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]], the ruler of [[Calimshan]] at that time. by a ''[[jhasina]]''. In his adulthood in [[Tethyr]], he continued to maintain many contacts within Calimshan.",
        "History": "Jinjivar grew up in the Calim Desert as a nomad.\n\nDuring the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]], he had fanatic followers who wore colors of blue and purple. These goons often clashed with the thugs of [[Anakul|Anakul the Just]], another member of the Council at that time when anarchy in the city was rampant.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Jinjivar returned from wherever he had been for the previous year Marquis Enzo had been a Council member along with Jinjivar, but after the Council voted to proclaim [[Zaranda Star]] as queen, the marquis secretly sided with [[Yusuf Jhannivvar]] during the [[Second Siege of Myratma]]. After Zaranda was victorious in the siege, the marquis tried to flee, but Jinjivar captured him and held him until Zaranda and her forces returned to the city. The Marquis Enzo was later beheaded for his crimes against the crown."
