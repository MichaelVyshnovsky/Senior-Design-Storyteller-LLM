        "Description": "He was an aging but large man with a huge white mustache. He ruled with a conservative fair style, preferring to consult local religious leaders before making political decisions. This made him well-loved not only with the people of Alamontyr but also the people of the [[Realm of the Smoking Star]] to the west.",
        "Background": "The forty [[Griffon Knights]] were Bardran Thulmaer's personal guard and upholders of the peace in Alamontyr. Although the Shield Duke was popular with his people, he had not named a successor, leading to much speculation about who would succeed him."
