'''Jasmal''' was a [[shield dwarf]] [[sage]] and [[cleric]] of [[Dumathoin]] inhabiting [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She had a light beard and smiled most of the time unless she suspected she was being lied to.

==Activities==
Jasmal was well-known for her knowledge of engineering, architecture, stonecraft, weaponry, and the fauna of the [[Sword Coast]]. She wintered in Waterdeep but spent the rest of the year wandering [[northwest Faerûn]] in search of ancient [[Delzoun]] artifacts and observing wildlife. While within the City of Splendors Jasmal could usually be found in her room in the [[Warrens]] in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] or at [[Selûne's Smile]].
