Pruj was a goblin chieftain that led a group of his kin as part of the Hordes of Dragonspear, during the Second Dragonspear War of the midâ€“14 century DR.
Chief Pruj was well known and respected among his kind. It was speculated that he had delusions of grandeur as he was quite courageous, a trait that was uncommon among the goblinoid races.
Pruj led a group of 500 goblins serving in the Marauders contingent of the Dragonspear hordes.
