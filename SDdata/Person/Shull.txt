'''Shull''' was a young [[duergar]] who lived in the city of [[Gracklstugh]] in the [[Northdark]]. It was unknown if Shull was a fictional character or real person, but his story was immortalized in the book, ''[[Fables of Faer√ªn]]''.

{{Quote|I am here to learn.|Shull.}}

==Abilities==
He had some latent [[psionic]] powers, including the ability to project troubling whispers in the minds of others.

==History==
Shull was not content with his meager ability, and sought out more powers with the hope of taking over his clan. Shull sought out the [[Godfather]] of Gracklstugh and was directed to solicit the [[mind flayer]] [[Ir]], another powerful psionicist. Shull embarked on a long voyage, fighting off [[cloaker]]s and [[aboleth]]s, and finally made it to the mind flayer's lair in a deep chasm.

Ir taught Shull how to read the minds of others and bend them to his will. But Shull was not content, and wished to destroy others' minds outright. Ir granted Shull's wish and bestowed upon him a blessing that would allow him to shatter a single mind but once, before the power became lost forever.

Shull returned home to Gracklstugh, confident and eager to supplant the Godfather. Shull demonstrated his ability; he uttered the command word of his new power and immediately shattered his own skull. The Godfather was pleased his lesson was complete.
