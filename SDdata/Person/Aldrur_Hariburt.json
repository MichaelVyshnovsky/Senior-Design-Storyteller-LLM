        "mainbody": "'''Aldrur Hariburt''' was a [[Heralds (local)|local herald]] based in [[Myratma]], [[Tethyr]], in [[1372 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Aldrur was a pompous bureaucrat with an inflated sense of importance.",
        "Abilities": "As a [[Heralds of Faerûn|Herald]], he was an expert in blazonry and the protocol of nobility.",
        "Possessions": "Aldrur Hariburt was comfortably wealthy.",
        "Activities": "Chastus served the [[Marilyn Haresdown|Duchess of the Purple Marches]] in the capacity of Herald over non-noble blazonry, including miller's marks, guild symbols, merchant fleet flags, trading coster badges, and other symbols of commerce around Myratma.\n\nHariburt was driven to prevent the untrained masses from designing heraldic devices on their own, which he saw as the exclusive charter of the Heralds. He was obsessed with ruining the business of [[Ilmurk Jongrath]], a miller who designed and painted simple blazons on shields and other accouterments in his spare time. Aldrur petitioned for fines, arrest warrants, and even ducal censure against Jongrath, but to no avail.",
        "Relationships": "Hariburt and his fellow Herald from [[Darromar]], [[Chastus Beldrorn]], were particularly nettled by an amateur heraldist named Ilmurk Jongrath. They accused him of usurping their authority, undercutting their prices, and generally being unfit to practice heraldry in any capacity. Jongrath was not in violation of any law and the two heralds could not get [[Marilyn Haresdown|Duchess Haresdown]] to agree that official action should be taken against him. Consequently, Beldrorn and Hariburt resorted to spreading rumors in various circles that Jongrath was an outright thief, a [[Calishite]] spy, and a revolutionary out to overthrow the new (as of the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]]) power structure of [[Tethyr]].",
