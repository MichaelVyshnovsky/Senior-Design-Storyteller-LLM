Dendrand Olaundran was a member of the Olaundran merchant family in Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR.
Dendrand was getting on in years, but unlike his brother Gauthklaun, he was still sharp and capable.
Alert for any sign of disrespect, he was a vindictive man that never let a slight go unanswered, always getting his revenge sooner or later.
Dendrand was an accomplished and dangerous wizard.
Dendrand was a brother of Gauthklaun Olaundran, the patriarch of the clan, and uncle to Yolaun and Bezrar.
