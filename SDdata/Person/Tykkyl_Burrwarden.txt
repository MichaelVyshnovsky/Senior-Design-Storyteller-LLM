'''Tykkyl Burrwarden''' was a shopkeeper in [[Skullport]].

==Activities==
Tykkyl, with his twin sister [[Tohkkal Burrwarden]], managed the shop [[Clockwork Wonders]].

==Personality==
Tykkyl was the dreamer of the [[Burrwarden]] twins. He was prone to bouts of inspirational ranting and activity. He dropped whatever he was doing and began sketching out a newly formulated idea on any nearby piece of [[paper]], napkin, or tablecloth. Often his ideas were of no application, but sometimes he devised a truly new development. Tykkyl was a pacifist at heart, and so unable to to harm someone.
