Parok Mirami was a well known askar guide for the Grand Bazaar in Huzuz.
Parok charged 1 dirham per hour for his guide services. Customers who hired him almost always found what they were seeking at the Grand Bazaar.
Parok loved pastries and was one of the reasons the Bakers pastry shop did so well.
Several merchants made deals with Parok to guide customers their way. These included the Al-Farif spice shop, the Al-Cinel shop for rare items, and the Al-Danafi house.
Parok spent many years at the Grand Bazaar and knew the area well. He paid attention to gossip and had a great feel for what was going on in the Bazaar.
