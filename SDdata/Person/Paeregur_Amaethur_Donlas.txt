'''Paeregur Amaethur Donlas''' was a warrior in the [[Frostfire Banner]] adventuring party during the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
His voice was deeper than that of his two comrades, [[Arvas]] and [[Faldast]].

==Possessions==
At the time of his death, he had a sword, a new helm, new armor, and an elaborate codpiece.

==History==
Paeregur was a member of the Frostfire Banner when they took on High Duke [[Horostos]]'s assignment to search for the reason why all animals larger than one's hand, as well as most people, were vanishing on the road between [[Starmantle]] and [[Ripplestones]].

They were ambushed on their first night out of Starmantle by a chiming mist, [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]]. [[Rolian]] and Paeregur noticed the chiming in the night. Paeregur went off to check up on Avras, who was on watch, and found him turned into a husk that collapsed into dust at the slightest touch. Rolian was attacked in the same way right there. He cried out to wake up the rest, and regrouped with [[Lhaerand]] and [[Phostral]]; the mist did the same thing to Phostral, and Lhaerand jumped off a cliff rather than be slain. Paeregur was last, and the mist killed him slowly, taking one limb at a time.
