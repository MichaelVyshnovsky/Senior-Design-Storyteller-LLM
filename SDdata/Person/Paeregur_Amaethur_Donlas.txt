Paeregur Amaethur Donlas was a warrior in the Frostfire Banner adventuring party during the midâ€“8 century DR.
His voice was deeper than that of his two comrades, Arvas and Faldast.
At the time of his death, he had a sword, a new helm, new armor, and an elaborate codpiece.
Paeregur was a member of the Frostfire Banner when they took on High Duke Horostoss assignment to search for the reason why all animals larger than ones hand, as well as most people, were vanishing on the road between Starmantle and Ripplestones.
They were ambushed on their first night out of Starmantle by a chiming mist, the Slayer. Rolian and Paeregur noticed the chiming in the night. Paeregur went off to check up on Avras, who was on watch, and found him turned into a husk that collapsed into dust at the slightest touch. Rolian was attacked in the same way right there. He cried out to wake up the rest, and regrouped with Lhaerand and Phostral the mist did the same thing to Phostral, and Lhaerand jumped off a cliff rather than be slain. Paeregur was last, and the mist killed him slowly, taking one limb at a time.
