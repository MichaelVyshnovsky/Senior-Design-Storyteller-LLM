'''Jesse Hearthe''' was a mage who lived in [[Vanesci Hamlet]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

Jesse Hearthe was a popular mage who commanded great political influence at all levels in the Utter East. Although she had retired to Vanesci Hamlet for a number of years, she still manipulated matters behind the scenes.

She denounced the [[Legendary Campaign]], which aimed to unify the war-torn Utter East through conquest. To defend their honor, the leader of the campaign faced Hearthe in a bloodforge battle.
