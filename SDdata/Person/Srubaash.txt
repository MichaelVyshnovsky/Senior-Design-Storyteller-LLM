'''King Srubaash''' was the [[goblin]] ruler of the [[Neidlig]] tribe in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Srubaash led his tribe with cunning and diplomacy, forming alliances with other communities and avoiding warfare whenever possible. His ultimate intent was to build a realm similar to [[Hlundadim]], unifying goblins, [[orc]]s, and other [[humanoid]]s. Thanks to his successes and belief in his grand destiny, he styled himself King, rather than Chieftain of his tribe.

==History==
Srubaash claimed to have been visited by a mysterious spirit that urged him to rebuild the ancient realm of Hlundadim. Following this experience, he began assembling an increasingly expansive multi-racial realm, making Neidlig the largest and most powerful force in the Goblin Marches by the 1360s DR.
