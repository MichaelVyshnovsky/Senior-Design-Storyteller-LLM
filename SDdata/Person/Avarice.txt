Avarice was a tiefling scholar of the Arcane Brotherhood who devoted herself to the archdevil Levistus. For a time, she dwelled within the keep at Caer-Dineval alongside the Knights of the Black Sword.
Unlike other tieflings that had red, purple, and other colors of skin, Avarices skin had no pigment as she had albinism.
Avarice was an especially vicious individual who demonstrated great confidence and contempt for those she saw beneath her. She had no trust for any other individuals, save (in part) for her two gargoyles.
Quite befitting an evoker, Avarice found great joy in witnessing destruction. She sought even greater happiness during her pursuit of fame and glory among her peers in the Arcane Brotherhood, though they were yet to be achieved.
Among her possessions was a staff of frost and a personal spellbook made of white leather and vellum.
Avarice had a great rivalry with her fellow Brotherhood wizard Vellynne Harpell.
While she was acquainted with Kadroth, head of the Knights of the Black Sword, she did not become involved in their activities at the keep. She did avail herself of the cults resources, such as assistants to accompany her on expeditions.
She had a fiendish raven familiar called Skelm, and two gargoyle companions, Gargle and Gurgle.
At some point in her life, Avarice sold her soul to Levistus for greater powers. The archdevil appeared to the tiefling in her dreams, granting her guidance.
Some time around , Avarice received a vision to visit the Ten Towns and seek out the "Black Sword". She especially wanted to recover the personal spellbook of the Netherese arcanist Iriolarthas.
