'''Avarice''' was a [[tiefling]] scholar of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] who devoted herself to the [[archdevil]] [[Levistus]]. For a time, she dwelled within the [[Caer-Dineval keep|keep]] at [[Caer-Dineval]] alongside the [[Knights of the Black Sword]].

==Description==
Unlike other tieflings that had red, purple, and other colors of skin, Avarice's skin had no pigment as she had [[albinism]].

==Personality==
Avarice was an especially vicious individual who demonstrated great confidence and contempt for those she saw beneath her. She had no trust for any other individuals, save (in part) for her two [[gargoyle]]s.

Quite befitting an [[evoker]], Avarice found great joy in witnessing destruction. She sought even greater happiness during her pursuit of fame and glory among her peers in the Arcane Brotherhood, though they were yet to be achieved.

==Possessions==
Among her possessions was a ''[[staff of frost]]'' and a personal ''[[spellbook]]'' made of white [[leather]] and [[vellum]].

==Relationships==
Avarice had a great rivalry with her fellow Brotherhood wizard [[Vellynne Harpell]].

While she was acquainted with [[Kadroth]], head of the [[Knights of the Black Sword]], she did not become involved in their activities at the keep. She did avail herself of the cult's resources, such as assistants to accompany her on expeditions.

She had a fiendish [[raven]] [[familiar]] called [[Skelm]], and two gargoyle companions, [[Gargle]] and [[Gurgle]].

==History==
At some point in her life, Avarice sold her soul to Levistus for greater powers. The archdevil appeared to the tiefling in her dreams, granting her guidance.

Some time around {{YearlinkName|1489}}, Avarice received a vision to visit the [[Ten Towns]] and seek out the "Black Sword". She especially wanted to recover the personal ''spellbook'' of the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Iriolarthas]].
