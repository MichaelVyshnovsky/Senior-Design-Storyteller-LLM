'''Weregund''' was a trader in who owned the General Store in the town of [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]].

==Biography==
Weregund was a longstanding plant of [[Zhentil Keep]] in the town. Although his stock was the more limited of the two stores in town, his was considered the town's trading post as his store larger and he was the one who regularly traded with passing caravans.

During the [[Zhentarim]] occupation of Shadowdale in [[1374 DR]], Weregund's identity as a spy was only known to [[Scyllua Darkhope]] and [[Eregul|Eregul the Freestave]]. Weregund set up an underground resistance movement called the [[Free Shadowdale Alliance]] that merely served to allow the trader to pass on any plans of action against the occupying force to the Zhentarim.

==Description==
The large trader was known to walk with a limp.

==Personality==
Weregund had a reputation for greed and cowardice but his neighbours also erroneously believed him to be loyal to [[Shadowdale]], marking him as an adept liar.

==Relationships==
The merchant had a wife [[Meershand]], a son [[Dabragund]], and a daughter [[Dletagund]].<ref>
