Broog-Norb was an ettin found into the Temple of the Black Earth in Tyar-Besil during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Broog-Norb was a particularly large and grumpy ettin. Broog-Norb wasnt a follower of the Cult of the Black Earth.
In 1491 DR, Broog-Norb found a way to Tyar-Besil. He only had a temporary truce with the earth cultists, who were careful to stay out of his way. He usually resided in the abandoned kitchen until some adventurers infiltrated the temple and confronted and defeated him.
