Werond Torophar was a teamster on the Sword Coast just before the Tyranny of Dragons.
Werond was a quiet but romantic woman. She mastered her animals like no other on the Trade Way, but at heart she was a starry-eyed romantic, capable of making strong men cry over her tales of unlucky past loves.
Werond was one of the best teamsters in the Western Heartlands.
At the start of the Tyranny of Dragons, inÂ 1489 DR she acted as lead teamster for a great caravan that, unbeknownst to her, was full of agents of the Cult of the Dragon transporting treasures for the Hoard of the Dragon Queen.
