'''Drannin Splitshield''' was an evil [[dwarf]] of [[Mithral Hall]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Personality==
Drannin was a self-serving individual who believed that, due to his heritage, he was owed better than he received. When he didn't receive the accolades, he began to see everyone in his way as the problem, trying to keep him down, and he vowed to do whatever it took to turn the tables. Drannin believed that with ''[[Orcsplitter]]'' in his possession he could establish himself as a powerful lord among his clan, and finally win the respect he thought he deserved.

==Possessions==
Drannin's most prized possession was a [[shield guardian]]. He stole the amulet that controlled it from a [[sorcerer]] some years back.

==History==
Like his cousin [[Gargosh Blusterhelm]], Drannin was intent on claiming the legendary axe ''Orcsplitter''. In [[1491 DR]], he devised a new plan: dupe his cousin Gargosh into finding the axe for him.

So, just after Gargosh gained the support of the [[Lords' Alliance]] and hired some adventurers to search for the [[axe]] in the [[Halls of the Hunting Axe]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]], Drannin kidnapped his cousin and replaced him with a [[doppelganger]] loyal to him.

At last, at the tomb of [[Torhild Flametongue]], Drannin and his cohorts showed up in front of the adventurers to claim the prize but the adventurers easily defeated them.
