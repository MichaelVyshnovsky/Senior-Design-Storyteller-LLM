        "mainbody": "Arvas or Avras was a warrior in the Frostfire Banner adventuring party during the midâ€“8 century DR.\nHe had a bit of a reputation for drink. He laughed with his comrades when they brought that up, but sarcastically so.\nHis voice wasnt as deep as Paeregurs.\nHe carried a sword and wore a cowl.\nArvas was a member of the Frostfire Banner when they took on High Duke Horostoss assignment to search for the reason why all animals larger than ones hand, as well as most people, were vanishing on the road between Starmantle and Ripplestones.\nThey were ambushed on their first night out of Starmantle by a chiming mist, the Slayer. Avras took first watch when his comrade Paeregur checked up on him, hearing the tinkling bell-like sound, he found Avras had been reduced to a skull and a husk that collapsed into ash at the slightest touch."
