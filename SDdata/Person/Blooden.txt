'''Blooden''' was a [[succubus]] and mistress of the [[Deep Crest]], the breeding grounds of the [[Abyss]].

She was one of the [[demon]]s and [[devil]]s bound to [[Ammon Jerro]] in order to increase his [[warlock]] power.

She appeared to have an infatuation with [[Koraboros]], despite the fact he was devil and she was a demon. She commented rather casually that she had mated with many mortal men, even those of [[celestial]] descent, but none had survived her violent mating habits.<ref>
