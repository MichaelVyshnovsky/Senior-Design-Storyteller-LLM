Blooden was a succubus and mistress of the Deep Crest, the breeding grounds of the Abyss.
She was one of the demons and devils bound to Ammon Jerro in order to increase his warlock power.
She appeared to have an infatuation with Koraboros, despite the fact he was devil and she was a demon. She commented rather casually that she had mated with many mortal men, even those of celestial descent, but none had survived her violent mating habits.
