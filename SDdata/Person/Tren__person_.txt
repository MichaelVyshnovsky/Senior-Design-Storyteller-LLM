'''Tren''' was a farmer's son enslaved by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
Tren was a homely but strong young man, with a muscular body of a farmer.

==History==
In 1369 DR, Tren was one of the unfortunate villagers captured by the Cult of the Dragon's slavers. Alongside [[Wenta]], [[Jorsh]], and [[Ristim]], the folk were taken to the Cult's slave pens in the ruined [[Darnarest's tower]].
