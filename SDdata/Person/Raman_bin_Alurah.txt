Imam Raman bin Alurah was a moralist priest of Najm and a prince of Hiyal around 1367 DR.
Raman was thin and tall. His gift for elaborate planning made him one of the Sultanas most dangerous sons.
As Imam, Raman led the religious following of Najm in Hiyal. He also served as the official keeper of Najms mosque in the city. As a devoted moralist, Raman had close ties with the Pantheist League who hoped to instill their beliefs in Hiyal.
Though not the youngest child of Alurah bint Asrah, he was her youngest son.
