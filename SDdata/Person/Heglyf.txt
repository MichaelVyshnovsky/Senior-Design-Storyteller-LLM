'''Heglyf''' was the leader of the infamous adventuring troupe of occultist hunters called the [[Band of the Key]], active many years before the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Heglyf was a skinny, mustached man whose weapons of choice were [[crossbow]]s, as they could remain armed and cocked for long periods of time, unlike [[bow]]s.

==History==
Long before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Heglyf led the Band of the Key in an endless quest to find and retrieve evil magical texts from the hands of villains. Heglyf was mostly remembered for commissioning a new type of [[enchanted]] [[bolt]]—the ''[[tranquil bolt]]''—from a group of [[Deneirian]] [[priest]]s. The bolts were especially useful against spellcasters as they rendered mages and other spellslingers ''[[silent]]''.
