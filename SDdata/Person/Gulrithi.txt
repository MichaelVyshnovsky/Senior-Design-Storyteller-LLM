'''Gulrithi''' was a very old [[dark naga]] [[necromancer]] who sought to extinguish the [[Shrine of the Silver Fire]] in [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1369 DR]].

==Abilities==
Gulrithi was a powerful spellcaster and a necromancer who was served by risen [[wight]]s and [[mohrg]]s.

==Possessions==
Gulrithi carried an ''[[amulet of perfect health]]'' and [[enchanted]] [[dagger]] called ''[[Delvendoor's Chisel]]''.

==History==
At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Gulrithi created a lair within the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The dark naga hated [[Mystra]], the goddess of magic, and attempted to defile the Shrine of the Silver Fire nearby. The shrine was maintained by two [[guardian naga]] priestesses of the Lady of Mysteryâ€”[[Ethe]] and [[Gloran]]. Gulrithi lured the [[cleric]]s into a magical trap. The two nagas remained in stasis until a group of [[adventurer]]s known as the [[Veiled Ones]] slew Gulrithi and his mohrgs and master wights. The heroes broke the ''head pole'' that maintained the stasis trap, releasing the [[Sisterhood of the Silver Fire|Sisters of the Silver Fire]].
