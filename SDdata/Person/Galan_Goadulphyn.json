        "History": "Galan was a warrior of Cormanthor.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|184-185, 190|9}}\n\nLater, while wandering the forest in hunger, he came across a mushroom farmer; he was so hungry that he reached for the mushrooms before realizing they belonged to someone. The farmer briefly tried to fight but found himself far overmatched, then mistook mistook him for the new [[human]] armathor, and worried about offense, offered him all he carried. After seeing him slay a [[stirge]] without even looking, the farmer became convinced of his puissance, and yielded his packed lunch. Though puzzled, he was too hungry to refuse.\n\nHe returned to the city in {{yearlink|261}} carrying a wealth of stolen [[dwarven]] gems in his boots; he was mistaken for a human by a patrol on the road, though he tried not to get spotted. Learning humans and dwarves were allowed in the city vexed him somewhat, but he still gave away a [[ruby]] to the armathor in charge, mostly as mockery- regretting the loss of a ruby almost instantly.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|361-362|Epilogue}} Later he saw many elves flying under the power of the ''[[mythal]]''; he thought to attempt to burgle a home or two while they were distracted, but he was stopped by [[Symrustar Auglamyr]], who kissed him and enspelled all his gems to fly off his boots.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|376-377|Epilogue}}\n\nAt the time of the laying of the ''mythal'', he was the last of his line and used to disappear for months on end. However, by {{yearlink|651}}, he had married a human woman who bore him a son, [[Thallan Goadulphyn]]. He had since set himself to the task of restoring his house."
