        "mainbody": "Galan Goadulphyn, also Galan the Gallant, was an inhabitant of Myth Drannor in the 3 century DR.\nHe had only one eye. After falling off a sheer rock face, he became disfigured to the point of being nearly unrecognizable as an elf.\nHe was an excellent throw with the knife.\nGalan was a warrior of Cormanthor.\nLater, while wandering the forest in hunger, he came across a mushroom farmer he was so hungry that he reached for the mushrooms before realizing they belonged to someone. The farmer briefly tried to fight but found himself far overmatched, then mistook mistook him for the new human armathor, and worried about offense, offered him all he carried. After seeing him slay a stirge without even looking, the farmer became convinced of his puissance, and yielded his packed lunch. Though puzzled, he was too hungry to refuse.\nHe returned to the city in  carrying a wealth of stolen dwarven gems in his boots he was mistaken for a human by a patrol on the road, though he tried not to get spotted. Learning humans and dwarves were allowed in the city vexed him somewhat, but he still gave away a ruby to the armathor in charge, mostly as mockery- regretting the loss of a ruby almost instantly. Later he saw many elves flying under the power of the mythal he thought to attempt to burgle a home or two while they were distracted, but he was stopped by Symrustar Auglamyr, who kissed him and enspelled all his gems to fly off his boots.\nAt the time of the laying of the mythal, he was the last of his line and used to disappear for months on end. However, by , he had married a human woman who bore him a son, Thallan Goadulphyn. He had since set himself to the task of restoring his house."
