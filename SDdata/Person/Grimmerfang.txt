'''Grimmerfang''' was a male [[orc]] and [[Orc-King]] of the orcish kingdom of [[Vastar]] in the late 6th and early 7th centuries [[DR]].

==History==
After Vastar suffered eight bloody years of civil war following the death of [[Ologh]] the [[Overking]], Grimmerfang won the war when he defeated his last rival for the throne, then ceremonially spitted, cooked and devoured them. Becoming Orc-King Grimmerfang in [[580 DR|the Year of the Loose Coins, 580 DR]], he took Ologh's court at the [[Hollow Mountain]] for himself, which he renamed "Mount Grimmerfang". With this, he ended warfare amongst the orcs of Vastar, at least for a short time.

However, taking advantage of the orcish strife, [[dwarf|dwarves]] were encroaching from the west, spreading underground and applying increasing pressure on the orcs. Meanwhile, Vastar suffered repeated defeats to the [[elf|elves]]. Finally, armed with [[orcslayer]] blades, the dwarves surged out of the mountains and slaughtered the orcs. Vastar fell in [[610 DR|the Year of the Spellfire, 610 DR]], and Grimmerfang was slain in his namesake mountain. The orcish survivors were driven north and south into the mountain peaks as the dwarves founded [[Roldilar]].
