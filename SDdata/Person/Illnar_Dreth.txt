'''Illnar Dreth''' was a crazed arsonist in the city of [[Konigheim]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

During the Festival of [[Talos]] in Konigheim, Illnar started a fire in the heart of the city. It spread swiftly to nearby buildings then grew into a huge blaze that threatened to destroy the whole city. The leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] discovered Illnar was the culprit and decided to punish them in a [[bloodforge]] battle amidst the burning city.
