Madame Iyvdanya was a cleric of Savras and fortune-teller in Skullport in the mid–14 century DR. She ran the Madam Ivydanyas Fortunes Revealed business.
She hailed from Cormyr, but was established in Skullport by 1370 DR.
She rented and ran her trade out of a boxy two-story apartment in Skullports Lower Port area. One floor was dedicated to the business and was in fair condition.
Iyvdanya predicted the fates and futures of those who came to her, and she did brisk business with the superstitious sailors and pirates who passed through the Port of Shadow. She charged according to a clients wealth, from 10 silver pieces to 5 gold pieces for a reading. Her techniques varied she read palms, tea leaves, cards, oracle sticks, or even the patterns of wax droplets from a jiggled burning candle.
If she sensed bad fortune for a client—a common happening—she suggested a remedy based on folk traditions to ward off bad luck. One example was wearing clothes inside out for a tenday. In particularly bad cases, she sold a good-luck charm bearing the holy symbol of Tymora for 10 gold pieces (she had a deal with Ramoras Guile Shipping to get from Waterdeep) or else referred them to the Sisters Three Waxworks for one of theirs.
In addition to her divine magic gained as a priestess, Iyvdanya had some psionic powers as a wild talent. She was capable of aura sight, object reading, and precognition.
She was half-deaf.
