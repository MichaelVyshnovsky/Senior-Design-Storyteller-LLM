        "History": "Losiir was a githyanki soldier from [[crèche K'liir]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, he was a member of a group of [[Githyanki#Relationships|githyanki dragon rider]]s chasing a [[mind flayer]] nautiloid to obtain the [[Astral Prism]]. During the assault on the nautiloid, Losiir was captured. Mind flayers inserted a tadpole into his eye thus beginning the process of [[ceremorphosis]]. He managed to escape the capsule where he was detained when the ship was in [[Avernus]]. Losiir headed to the [[Spelljamming helm|nautiloid's helm]] while trying to take control of the [[vessel]] and fighting the attacking [[imp]]s. He planned to get to a crèche where he could be cleansed of the tadpole via a [[zaith'isk]].\n\nHowever, Losiir and the tadpole in his head died in the crash of the nautiloid. Some said that they saw a githyanki corpse on the [[Ravaged Beach]] while the others insisted that his body was hidden by Lae'zel when she woke up after the crash.{{Speculation}}"
