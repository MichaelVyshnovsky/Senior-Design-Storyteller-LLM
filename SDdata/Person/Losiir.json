        "mainbody": "Losiir was a githyanki warrior who traversed the planes in service of the githyanki Lich Queen, Vlaakith CLVII.\nLosiir was acquainted with Laezel.\nDuring the assault on the nautiloid, Losiir wore a githyanki half-plate and githyanki boots. As a fighter he used a longbow and a scimitar. He also had two potions of healing, a scroll of revivify, and a tourmaline ring. Losiir had a githyanki silver sword, but he lost it after being captured by mind flayers.\nLosiir was a githyanki soldier from crèche Kliir. In the , he was a member of a group of githyanki dragon riders chasing a mind flayer nautiloid to obtain the Astral Prism. During the assault on the nautiloid, Losiir was captured. Mind flayers inserted a tadpole into his eye thus beginning the process of ceremorphosis. He managed to escape the capsule where he was detained when the ship was in Avernus. Losiir headed to the nautiloids helm while trying to take control of the vessel and fighting the attacking imps. He planned to get to a crèche where he could be cleansed of the tadpole via a zaithisk.\nHowever, Losiir and the tadpole in his head died in the crash of the nautiloid. Some said that they saw a githyanki corpse on the Ravaged Beach while the others insisted that his body was hidden by Laezel when she woke up after the crash."
