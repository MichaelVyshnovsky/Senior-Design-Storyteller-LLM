        "mainbody": "human\nGulthias was a vampire of another world and a follower of the great wyrm Ashardalon.\nGulthias was fanatical and insane. Even after his masters death he believed that the dragon could return in some way. This belief would later prove true. Over time, he stopped seeing any distinction between his faith and the necromancy he practiced.\nAfter his masters consort was murdered in an event known as the Wrath of Ashardalon, which would later cause the great wyrms supposed death at the hands of the druid Dydd, Gulthias and other followers decided to turn themselves into undead to await the return of the great wyrm whom they believed to be a living god.\nHowever, in a remote citadel, adventurers pierced Gulthiass heart with a stake. From the stake mixed with the vampires blood emerged a tree known as the Gulthias tree.\nSomehow, Gulthias returned.\nMost of the cultists led by the vampire went to populate a place known as the Nightfang Spire, a tower carved into the claw of some colossal creature. Surrounded by undead servants, girallons, flesh golems, and a mooncalf he protected the undead heart of Ashardalon.\nAlthough Gulthias had no known presence on Toril, tales of him and the Gulthias tree reached as far as the Yawning Portal tavern in Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR."
