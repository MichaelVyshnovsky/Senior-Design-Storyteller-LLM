        "mainbody": "'''Wak Rathar''' was a wizard living in [[Hillsfar]] in [[1367 DR]]. As an old friend of Lord [[Maalthiir]], he was permitted to do all he wished.",
        "Personality": "Wak had a sick sense of humor. He enjoyed sending people into the [[Arena (Hillsfar)|Arena]] for only the sport of it. One of this tricks was offering adventurers a demonstration of magic, then disappearing and leaving a pile of [[gold]] behind, gold he later claimed was stolen. Alternatively, Wak would ask \"want to see a magic trick?\" and disappear with the unwitting victim's magic items.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Wak Rathar targeted adventurer [[Mhai Prittee|Mhai the Mage]], offering to show him a magic trick. Mahai fell for such ploy once before and promptly turned the old mage down. As of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Wak Rathar's eccentric and cruel antics made him even less popular than Lord Maalthiir. Due to this foul reputation, [[Mordak Brelliar]] was virulently advising the city's ruler to distance himself from the old wizard. Mordak's advice came from fear of Rathar's future grab for power."
