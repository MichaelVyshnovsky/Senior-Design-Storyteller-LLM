'''Frulam Mondath''' was a member of the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] of [[Severin Silrajin]], holding the rank of Wearer of the Purple.

==Relationships==
Mondath considered [[Langdedrosa Cyanwrath]] her right-hand, and often kept the [[half-dragon]] at her side.

==History==
She was the leader of the Cult army in the assault on [[Greenest]], and Langdedrosa Cyanwrath usually followed her directives. At the Cult's camp near the city, Frulam deferred to the [[half-dragon]] [[Rezmir]], who was her superior.

When adventurers raided the camp, Frulam fought them but was easily defeated and captured. She hesitantly told the adventurers what she knew about the Cult's plan to summon [[Tiamat]], which was minimal.

Later, Frulam was held captive by the [[Harpers]] for trial.
