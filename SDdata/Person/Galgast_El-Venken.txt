'''Galgast El-Venken''' was the [[ulitharid]] leader of the [[Sept of Ill'Ghact]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
Galgast originated from a [[drow]] host of [[House Oblodra]] in [[1358 DR]] and the psionic powers of his host permitted the birth of an ulitharid. Later in the same year, [[Methil El-Viddenvelp]] disappeared in the wake of the drow defeat in the assault on [[Mithral Hall]]. It was only natural that Galgast assumed the leadership of the Sept, which he led from that point on.

==Personality==
Galgast considered himself the natural leader of his fellows and used them as subordinates, and this was true: in [[illithid]] society, only the [[elder brain]] was more revered than an ulitharid. He inherited the will of Methil and was determined to finish his work of creating a new elder brain.
