Janik Darni was the proprietor of the Darni House in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Janik catered to wealthy merchants and caravan-masters by offering an assortment of fine food and skilled services.
Once a servant of Jisan at a mosque, Janik was allowed to leave the mosque to pursue his passion for business. Janik remained a devoted follower of Jisan and even kept a small mosque devoted to the goddess of plenty within his caravanserai.
