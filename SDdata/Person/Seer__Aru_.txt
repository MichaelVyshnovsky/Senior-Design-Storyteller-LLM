'''"The Seer"''' was the nickname of an elderly [[human]] man in the town of [[Aru]] in [[Wa]] with a reputation for clairvoyance in the 1770s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==Description==
He was very old, with bent back, a wrinkled and shriveled appearance, thin and unkempt white hair, and pale and translucent skin, yet with piercing blue eyes.

==Activities==
No one in Aru knew his real name; they called him "the Seer" partly out of sarcasm, partly for his reputation. He claimed he could look through the "veil of the world" and "glimpse" truths hidden from mortals, albeit only at certain times and in certain circumstances, only for brief periods and beyond his control. His words were cryptic, even nonsensical, and he could forget them completely moments later. He might just have been dismissed as a senile crank, but just enough of his glimpses turned out to be true that many folk in Aru gave them some consideration. On the other hands, there were also times when he just wildly wrong. Stories were told about how amazing accurate he had been, though these had little factual basis.

==History==

In high summer of {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, the Seer might have hurried up to a group of adventurers investigating [[Takako Shimizu]]'s nightmares and the monster in the [[daimyo]]'s [[donjon (Aru)|Donjon]]. A local tried to prevent him from bothering them, but he shared with them some of his glimpses about them, and then immediately forgot it. Nevertheless, his ramblings could just about have fitted how the investigation would proceed.
