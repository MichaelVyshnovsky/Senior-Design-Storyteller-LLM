Damian Krale was a worshiper of Shar who was tasked by the Mistress of the Night to unite cells dedicated to her worship throughout the Western Heartlands. The ultimate goal of his endeavours was mostly a secret and only a few of the leaders of the cells knew what it was.
Krale was a massive man with a booming voice, both of which served to enhance the force of his impressive personality.
In battle Damian wielded Shadowstone, an enchanted heavy mace that was also a minor artifact created by Shar.
