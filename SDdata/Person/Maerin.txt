'''Maerin''' was an [[Illuskan]] [[arcanist]] around the time of the [[Fall of Netheril]].

==History==
In the [[-335 DR|Year of Seven Spirits, &minus;335 DR]], Maerin contacted [[Immar Fardelver]] and other [[dwarven]] artisans from [[Delzoun]] to commission the building of [[Gauntlgrym]]. The work was completed in the [[-321 DR|Year of Hollow Hills, &minus;321 DR]].

Maerin was the wizard who rediscovered [[Maegera]] after Maegera was lost in a large chamber filled with molten rock. She was put there in {{Yearlink|-22900}} by a group of [[dwarves]] of the great Northkingdom of [[Delzoun]].<ref>
