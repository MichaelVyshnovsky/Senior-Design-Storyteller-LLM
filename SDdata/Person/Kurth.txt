Kurth was the leader of Ship Kurth and one of the five High Captains of the city of Luskan in 1367 DR. Due to the traditions of the High Captains, his real name was rarely used but it is highly likely that he is not the first High Captain Kurth. Along with his peers he was an experienced adventurer and a former pirate. 
Kurth had a black beard and was hot-tempered.
He lived within Kurth Tower in Closeguard Island, and was said to have a teleport ring that could whisk him there instantly. He also possessed a ring of regeneration. 
Ironically, Kurth was also a former friend of Nasher before the two became bitter enemies. According to rumors, their fallout was largely due to the twos mutual affection for Ophala Cheldarstorn.
