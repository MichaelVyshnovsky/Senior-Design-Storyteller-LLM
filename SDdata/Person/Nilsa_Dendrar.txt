Nilsa Dendrar was the oldest child of the Dendrar family of Phandalin in the 15 century DR.
Her father was a woodcarver, called Thel, and her mother was called Mirna. She had a younger brother, Nars.
In 1491 DR, the Redbrands caused much trouble in her home village, and slew her father, Thel. The remaining members of her family were kidnapped, and taken to Tresendar Manor, where they were to be sold as slaves.
