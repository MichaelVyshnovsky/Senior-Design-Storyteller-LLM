'''Mycontil''' was an archmage who lived in [[Halruaa]] during ages past.

==Activities==
Mycontil oversaw the destruction of a large group of barbarian invaders from [[Dambrath]], valiantly giving his life to defend Halruaa against the enemy. Mycontil's force of only 500 was able to utterly repel the invading force of over 40,000.
