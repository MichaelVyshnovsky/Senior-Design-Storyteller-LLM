        "Personality": "He had an imposing presence that he liked to use to more efficiently diffuse disputes during the course of his job. He took pride in his work and his city, and had little patience for any who would bring harm to either. He kept his business honest, although he was not above retaliating against those who crossed him.\n\nHe tended to like [[adventurer]]s,{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|5}} He was very knowledgeable about the goings-on around Port Nyanzaru.",
        "Abilities": "He was a considerably powerful sorcerer, and made frequent use of [[magic]] to do his job: he used ''[[Clairaudience/clairvoyance|clairvoyance]]'' to quickly inspect ships' holds, ''[[detect thoughts]]'' for dealing with visiting ship captains, ''[[dominate beast]]'' to pacify nervous [[dinosaur]] beasts of burden, ''[[knock]]'' for inspecting closed containers, and ''[[message]]'' to deliver orders to his dockworkers.",
        "Activities": "As harbormaster, Zindar was responsible for keeping track of shipping manifests and for running the docks, including managing the traffic in the [[Port Nyanzaru/Warehouse District|Warehouse District]] and dealing with the hundreds of minor disputes and problems that arose each day across the [[Port Nyanzaru/Harbor Ward|Harbor Ward]]. Doing so frequently meant that he was not present in his [[Harbormaster's Office (Port Nyanzaru)|office]], but messages for him could be left with his clerks.{{Cite adventurers league/A Lesson in Love|3}}\n\nHe was well-paid by the city's [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant princes]] for his services.",
        "History": "In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Zindar had permission from the merchant princes&mdash;specifically from fellow Ytepka member [[Zhanthi]]&mdash;to offer a reward of 2,000 [[gold piece]]s for the capture of the pirate ships known as the ''[[Dragonfang (ship)|Dragonfang]]'', the ''[[Emerald Eye (ship)|Emerald Eye]]'', and the ''[[Stirge (ship)|Stirge]]''. He also offered 500 gold pieces for the capture of the captains of any of these ships."
