'''Priscilla Auck''' was the sister of [[Feringal Auck|Feringal]], lord of [[Auckney]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Priscilla was domineering and controlling over her younger brother's actions, in part because of her desire to rule Auckney herself. She tended a beautiful garden in Castle Auck, perhaps the only fact that endeared her to [[Meralda Ganderlay]], Feringal's betrothed.

==Relationships==
Priscilla was the older sister of Feringal, whom she called "Feri." Their father was [[Tristan Auck]], who died when Priscilla was about 10 years old.

She looked down and even despised Meralda, Feringal's betrothed, until she was led to believe that Meralda had been raped.

She and [[Temigast]] were secretly lovers.
