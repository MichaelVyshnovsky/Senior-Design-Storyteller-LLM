'''Wiri Fleagol''' was a slave of the [[fire giant]]s in [[Ironslag]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Wiri was captured by fire giants and taken to Ironslag where she worked as a miner together with many other [[gnome]]s and [[dwarves]], overseen by [[salamander]] guards.
