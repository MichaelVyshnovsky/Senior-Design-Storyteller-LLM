        "mainbody": "Theskul Mirroreye was one of the rulers of Boareskyr Bridge around 1360 DR.\nBased in Boareskyr Bridge, Theskul, along with Barim Stagwinter, became one of the de facto rulers of that place, protecting it from trolls, brigands, wolves, and worse. He planned to build an abbey dedicated to Tyr with the idea of one day building a small kingdom centered in Boareskyr linked to north Faerûn and the Sunset Vale by strong fortresses at Dragonspear Castle, the Way Inn, Scornubel, and Triel.\nTheskul was fearless and a good judge of people, but lacked patience with those who tried to twist the rules. He believed in an ordered Faerûn, a task he set to accomplish one farm at a time.\nTheskul had a strained relationship with the sorceress Aluena Halacanter, whom he believed to be over-tolerant and suspected to be a Harper."
