        "mainbody": "'''Theskul Mirroreye''' was one of the rulers of [[Boareskyr Bridge]] around [[1360 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Based in Boareskyr Bridge, Theskul, along with [[Barim Stagwinter]], became one of the ''de facto'' rulers of that place, protecting it from [[troll]]s, brigands, [[wolves]], and worse. He planned to build an abbey dedicated to [[Tyr]] with the idea of one day building a small kingdom centered in Boareskyr linked to [[north Faerûn]] and the [[Sunset Vale]] by strong fortresses at [[Dragonspear Castle]], the [[The Way Inn|Way Inn]], [[Scornubel]], and [[Triel]].",
        "Personality": "Theskul was fearless and a good judge of people, but lacked patience with those who tried to twist the rules. He believed in an ordered [[Faerûn]], a task he set to accomplish one farm at a time.",
        "Relationship": "Theskul had a strained relationship with the sorceress [[Aluena Halacanter]], whom he believed to be over-tolerant and suspected to be a [[Harper]]."
