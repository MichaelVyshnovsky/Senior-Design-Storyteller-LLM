        "mainbody": "High Harper Jaheira was a half-elf Circle of the Land druid of Tethyrian noble descent who served as an agent of the Harpers during the 14 and 15 centuries DR. Working alongside her husband Khalid, the future Baldurian Duke Abdel Adrian, and other heroes of the Realms, Jaheira continued fighting against those who would defile nature for many years. Later in life, she played a role in the fight against the Absolute crisis, which threatened Baldurs Gate, and the lands of the Sword Coast beyond.\nJaheira had the typical youthful appearance of half-elves during her youth, circa the mid–14 century DR. Due to her Tethyrian heritage, Jaheira did appear older, albeit at a much slower rate. After nearly a century-and-a-half-long life on Toril, Jaheira retained much of her youthful vigor but showed notable signs of aging.\nShe had tan skin that had accumulated a number of scars over the years. Her hair was either a chestnut brown or dirty blonde, which she often wore brushed back, bound in rows of beads. \nJaheira was strong-willed and resolute in her convictions whenever she spoke to others. She believed the only way to protect the natural world of Faerûn was to take direct action. She had an acerbic wit and often demonstrated a flippant attitude towards death. Despite her boldness, there were certain events in Jaheiras life that gave her a great sense of doubt and consternation.\nOver the many decades of her life, she trusted others less easily but remained wise enough to know when she could let her guard down, as well as acquiring a sense of humor, especially when referring to her own age.\nJaheira kept with her at all times her harper pin, She also safeguarded two powerful weapons, a staff of the ram, and a Belm scimitar from Kara-Tur. Arguably, her most prized possession was Khalids Gift, an anniversary present from her late husband, kept safe in the sanctuary underneath Jaherias home in Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR. Another item of note hidden away in the High Harpers sanctuary was the Rite of the Timeless Body assembled by Jaheira over the years. The ritual remained unfinished by 1492 DR, and Jaheira seemingly came to terms with her age until the events of the shadow-cursed lands, when she began rethinking the Rite and possibly completing it and continuing the good fight.\nAs a druid, Jaheira could take the form of several animals, including that of a wolf or bear. From her time spent as an agent of the Harpers, she had access to the spell Harpers call.\nWhen casting druidic magic, Jaheira felt different emotions depending on the nature of the spell. She often felt serene when casting healing magic or rage if a spell was especially harmful.\n|Mila Pesic\nJaheira had a very different personality than that of her husband. Jaheira was bold and willful, almost to the point of stubbornness, while Khalid was nervous and often lost his wits in battle. Regardless, the two were very much in love with one another.In the Baldurs Gate novel, Jaheira and Khalid have a strained relationship due to his infidelity. She liked to believe that her and Khalids personalities complemented each other, forming a true balance, but that was her druidic training talking. She was self-aware to admit to herself that she, in reality, was attracted to Khalids rump and loved his habit of only talking when he had something to say.\nDuring their time with the Harpers, Jaheira, and Khalid became good friends with the sage Gorion and were acquainted with such people as Elminster. Throughout their travels together, Jaheira became quite close with Imoen, though at times she saw the young mage as childish and naive. Her friendship with the Rashemaar berserker Minsc remained so strong, that she would readily risk life and limb to see him free from peril or imprisonment. Minsc came to consider Jaheira as the Wychlaran―a wise spellcaster woman―whom he was personally destined to protect with his life. Jaheira did not believe in such superstitions. \nAs of the late 15 century DR, Jaheira had a house in the city and cared for at least five foster children. Two of them were already grown up, the hammer-wielding half-elf Rion, and the half-orc mushroom druid Jord, while the other three were younger humans, the royalty-dreaming Jhessem, the fighter-in-training Fig, and the stuttering Tate. Underneath her home, in the sanctuary, Jaheiras animal allies could be found – a messenger badger and a small group of the informant rats.\nIn her many years of Harper work in Baldurs Gate, Jaheira crossed paths with Nine-Fingers of The Guild – Astele Keene. Despite having opposite morals and methods, their goals aligned, and eventually, the two gained a type of mocking affection for each other. Keene poked fun at Jaheira, calling her \"grandmother\" and made an offering to Kelemvor when she thought the half-elven High Harper died in the Shadow-cursed Lands in 1492 DR.\nthumb|Jaheira in the late 15 century DR.\nBeneath her home, Jaheira kept a small, personal grove - a rare sight in the city of Baldurs Gate. Hidden within her grove was a small cave, in which Jaheira housed her most treasured possessions, all that were greatly sentimental to her.\nIt was within her sanctuary that Jaheira worked on an ancient druidic ritual, the rite of the timeless body. This would allow her to extend her life even longer than that of other half-elves.\nJaheira was born in the 14 century into a noble Tethyrian family aligned with King Alemander IV. She was but a child during the Ten Black Days of Eleint on the eve of the Tethyrian Interregnum.\nJaheira was orphaned when her parents were killed by a mob of angry peasants. Fortunately, she was saved by one of the serving girls during the uprising, fleeing her familys castle with her to the Forest of Tethir. Soon after, they met an enclave of druids, that later accepted Jaheira into their community. She took on the role of a druid in service to the Oak Father Silvanus.In the novel, Jaheira venerates the deity Mielikki.\nAt some point Jaheira met Dermin Courtierdale, the man who introduced her to the Harpers and mentored her in the ways of their teachings. While with the Harpers, Jaheira met and fell in love with Khalid, a fellow half-elf who hailed from Calimshan. Despite the stark contrast in their characters, the two married in a short time during a simple ceremony on a gloomy rainy day in the Dalelands. The couple recited their vows, standing upon an upturned cart. Later in life, Jaheira sometimes wondered in amusement if their vows actually counted as Khalid stuttered so much while trying to recite his part.\nSometime in her earlier life, Jaheira spent some time as a thrall in an illithid colony.\nAt some point, Jaheira and her associates exposed the Calishite businessman Baron Ployer as a breeder of slaves, destroying his reputation within the realm.\nIn the , Jaheira and Khalid were sent on behalf of the Harpers to investigate the iron crisis and the Nashkel mines. They stayed at the Friendly Arm Inn and awaited the arrival of their friend and fellow Harper, Gorion. Unfortunately, Gorion was slain as he tried to smuggle his adopted son Abdel Adrian out of Candlekeep to safety. Jaheira and Khalid welcomed them and shared their plans to investigate the troubling goings-on that afflicted the Sword Coast.In the novels, Jaheira accompanies Abdel Adrian as they investigate and put an end to the iron crisis.\nJaheira accompanied Abdel to the Undercity of Baldurs Gate during the young Bhaalspawns final confrontation with his half-brother Sarevok Anchev.\nIn order to get inside the fort, Jaheira sought an abandoned temple of Bhaal that had recently been repurposed by Cyricists. During her journey she picked up the warrior-skald Voghiln and reunited with her ally who was then regarded as the Hero of Baldurs Gate.\nFollowing the defeat of the Shining Crusade in the , Abdel Adrian was framed for murder, briefly imprisoned in Baldurs Gate, and discreetly released from holding. Jaheira and Khalid were quick to join up with them once again, alongside their friends Imoen, Minsc, and Dynaheir. Soon after they set out from Baldurs Gate, the adventurers became clouded by mist and captured by a group of Shadow Thieves.\nJaheira woke up in a dungeon deep beneath the city of Athkatla in Amn. Some of her fellow companions were also imprisoned, while others, such as Khalid, had already been killed. Their captor was the elven wizard from Suldanessellar who had fallen from their grace, Jon Irenicus.In the  Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn novel, Jaheira joins Abdel Adrian in his quest against Irenicus. The exact role Jaheira played in the lives of her allies after fleeing from the dungeon was unknown, but her adventures continued on far and wide across west Faerûn. One such adventure led Jaheira to the city of Neverwinter, where she went undercover, taking on the wildshape of a goat. The druid was forced to break the cover and the wildshape to stop a murder.\nthumb|right|250px|Mature Jaheira in the late 15 century DR.\nNot long after her time with Abdel and his companions, Jaheira and her fellow Harpers fought alongside druids of Emerald Enclave in their crusade against Ketheric Thorm and the forces of Shar at Moonrise Towers. About the , the unified force managed to defeat the malevolent Thorm and imprison him within his familys mausoleum in Reithwin. Unfortunately, the united army was scattered when Ketheric Thorm brought down the shadow curse upon the lands, permanently twisting them for well over a century.\nSome time later, Jaheira made herself a home in Baldurs Gate. Due to her lifes calling, she was forced to spend much time away from her adopted and foster children, much to their chagrin. It was because of her children that she continued to live within a city that remained such a blight on the natural world.\nIn the , Jaheira and Minsc fought alongside each other once again. The duo was the first to uncover information about the emerging threat posed by the cult of the Absolute. Unfortunately, Minsc raged head-first into battle, and they lost any opportunity to rally greater numbers. Jaheira unfortunately, was forced to leave Minsc behind in order to share news of the cult.  \nAfterward, Jaheira received Harper agents reports about frequent cult activities within the shadow-cursed lands, east of Baldurs Gate, and led a group of Harpers there to investigate. To her surprise, the High-Harper encountered Ketheric Thorm, a man she thought killed and buried, leading the Absolutes army. The High Harper shot an arrow into Ketherics face, only to witness Ketheric pulling it out, healing immediately right in front of her eyes. Knowing she could not fight Ketheirc and his forces within the shadow-cursed lands directly, she fled with her Harper agents. Eventually, Jaheira found a safe haven, the roadside Last Light Inn, protected by the Selûnite cleric named Isobel, whose magic held the shadow curse at bay. She understood the grave threat the cult of the Absolute posed to the folks of the Sword Coast and beyond and did her part to maintain the safehouse near the cults headquarters at Moonrise Towers. Jaheiras family had only heard from her once during her stay, a mere seven words sent over by sending. Her message was, \"Im sorry, you know what to do,\" a message that meant that Jaheira perished in the line of duty and signaled her foster kids to leave the doomed city. That message, however, was ignored, and Jaheiras children remained in the Gate, later reuniting with her, unsurprised to see their mother alive. Despite Jaheiras words, she raised her children well, and they insisted on staying in Baldurs Gate to help against the armies of the Absolute."
