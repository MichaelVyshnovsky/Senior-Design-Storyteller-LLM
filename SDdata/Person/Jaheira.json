        "mainbody": "High Harper '''Jaheira''' was a [[half-elf]] [[Circle of the Land]] [[druid]] of [[Tethyr]]ian noble descent who served as an agent of the [[Harpers]] during the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. Working alongside her husband [[Khalid]], the future Baldurian Duke [[Abdel Adrian]], and other heroes of the Realms, Jaheira continued fighting against those who would defile nature for many years. Later in life, she played a role in the fight against the [[Absolute crisis]], which threatened [[Baldur's Gate]], and the lands of the [[Sword Coast]] beyond.\n\n{{Quote|...I'm wise and old enough to recognize a sliver of hope when it crawls out of the dark.|Jaheira.}}",
        "Description": "Jaheira had the typical youthful appearance of half-elves during her youth, ''circa'' the mid–14{{th}} century DR. Due to her [[Tethyrian]] heritage, Jaheira did appear older, albeit at a much slower rate. After nearly a century-and-a-half-long life on [[Toril]], Jaheira retained much of her youthful vigor but showed notable signs of aging.\n\nShe had tan skin that had accumulated a number of scars over the years. Her hair was either a chestnut brown or dirty blonde, which she often wore brushed back, bound in rows of beads.",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|This city is a blight on the landscape! 'Tis better to have let the land grow wild!|Jaheira, regarding the cityscapes of Faerûn.[[File:Jaheira - Blight.mp3]]}}\n\nJaheira was strong-willed and resolute in her convictions whenever she spoke to others. She believed the only way to protect the natural world of [[Faerûn]] was to take direct action. She had an acerbic wit and often demonstrated a flippant attitude towards death. Despite her boldness, there were certain events in Jaheira's life that gave her a great sense of doubt and consternation.\n\nOver the many decades of her life, she trusted others less easily but remained wise enough to know when she could let her guard down, as well as acquiring a sense of humor, especially when referring to her own age.",
        "Possessions": "Jaheira kept with her at all times her ''[[harper pin]]'', She also safeguarded two powerful weapons, a ''[[staff of the ram]]'', and a ''[[Scimitar of speed|Belm]]'' scimitar from [[Kara-Tur]]. Arguably, her most prized possession was ''[[Khalid's Gift]]'', an anniversary present from her late husband, kept safe in the sanctuary underneath Jaheria's home in Baldur's Gate in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Another item of note hidden away in the High Harper's sanctuary was the ''[[Rite of the Timeless Body]]'' assembled by Jaheira over the years. The ritual remained unfinished by [[1492 DR]], and Jaheira seemingly came to terms with her age until the events of the ''shadow-cursed lands'', when she began rethinking the ''Rite'' and possibly completing it and continuing the good fight.",
        "Abilities": "{{Quote|...when Minsc does as Minsc does, and charges in to make a mess: Jaheira does as ''Jaheira'' does, and finds a way to save us all anyway.|Minsc, the ranger.}}\n\nAs a druid, Jaheira could take the form of several animals, including that of a [[wolf]] or [[bear]]. From her time spent as an agent of the Harpers, she had access to the [[spell]] ''[[Harper's call]]''.\n\nWhen casting druidic magic, Jaheira felt different emotions depending on the nature of the [[spell]]. She often felt serene when casting healing magic or rage if a spell was especially harmful.",
        "Relationships": "{{Quote|The Harpers' movement grows, but it needs sunlight to blossom. We can be that light.|Jaheira.{{Cite MTG|CLB|237|{{MTGc|Jaheira, Friend of the Forest||CLB|#=237}}|[[Mila Pesic]]}}}}\n\nJaheira had a very different personality than that of her husband. Jaheira was bold and willful, almost to the point of stubbornness, while Khalid was nervous and often lost his wits in battle. Regardless, the two were very much in love with one another.In the [[Baldur's Gate (novel)|Baldur's Gate novel]], Jaheira and Khalid have a strained relationship due to his infidelity. She liked to believe that her and Khalid's personalities complemented each other, forming a true balance, but that was her druidic training talking. She was self-aware to admit to herself that she, in reality, was attracted to Khalid's rump and loved his habit of only talking when he had something to say.\n\nDuring their time with the Harpers, Jaheira, and Khalid became good friends with the [[sage]] Gorion and were acquainted with such people as [[Elminster]]. Throughout their travels together, Jaheira became quite close with [[Imoen]], though at times she saw the young mage as childish and naive. Her friendship with the [[Rashemaar berserkers|Rashemaar berserker]] [[Minsc]] remained so strong, that she would readily risk life and limb to see him free from peril or imprisonment. Minsc came to consider Jaheira as the [[Wychlaran]]―a wise spellcaster woman―whom he was personally destined to protect with his life. Jaheira did not believe in such superstitions. \n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Jaheira had a house in the city and cared for at least five foster children. Two of them were already grown up, the hammer-wielding [[half-elf]] [[Rion]], and the [[half-orc]] mushroom druid [[Jord]], while the other three were younger humans, the royalty-dreaming [[Jhessem]], the fighter-in-training [[Fig (person)|Fig]], and the stuttering [[Tate]]. Underneath her home, in the sanctuary, Jaheira's animal allies could be found – a messenger [[badger]] and a small group of the informant [[rat]]s.\n\nIn her many years of Harper work in Baldur's Gate, Jaheira crossed paths with Nine-Fingers of [[The Guild]] – [[Astele Keene]]. Despite having opposite morals and methods, their goals aligned, and eventually, the two gained a type of mocking affection for each other. Keene poked fun at Jaheira, calling her \"grandmother\" and made an offering to [[Kelemvor]] when she thought the half-elven High Harper died in the Shadow-cursed Lands in 1492 DR.",
        "Activities": "[[File:Jaheira wallpaper.jpg|thumb|''Jaheira in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].'']]\nBeneath her home, Jaheira kept a small, personal grove - a rare sight in the city of Baldur's Gate. Hidden within her grove was a small cave, in which Jaheira housed her most [[Khalid's gift|treasured possessions]], all that were greatly sentimental to her.\n\nIt was within her sanctuary that Jaheira worked on an ancient druidic ritual, the ''[[rite of the timeless body]]''. This would allow her to extend her life even longer than that of other half-elves.",
        "History": {
            "Early Life": "Jaheira was born in the 14{{th}} century into a noble [[Tethyr]]ian family aligned with [[Alemander IV|King Alemander IV]]. She was but a child during the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]] on the eve of the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]].\n\nJaheira was orphaned when her parents were killed by a mob of angry peasants. Fortunately, she was saved by one of the serving girls during the uprising, fleeing her family's castle with her to the [[Forest of Tethir]]. Soon after, they met an enclave of [[druid]]s, that later accepted Jaheira into their community. She took on the role of a druid in service to the Oak Father [[Silvanus]].In the novel, Jaheira venerates the deity [[Mielikki]].\n\nAt some point Jaheira met [[Dermin Courtierdale]], the man who introduced her to the Harpers and mentored her in the ways of their teachings. While with the Harpers, Jaheira met and fell in love with Khalid, a fellow half-elf who hailed from [[Calimshan]]. Despite the stark contrast in their characters, the two married in a short time during a simple ceremony on a gloomy rainy day in the [[Dalelands]]. The couple recited their vows, standing upon an upturned cart. Later in life, Jaheira sometimes wondered in amusement if their vows actually counted as Khalid stuttered so much while trying to recite his part.\n\nSometime in her earlier life, Jaheira spent some time as a thrall in an [[illithid]] colony.\n\nAt some point, Jaheira and her associates exposed the Calishite businessman [[Baron Ployer]] as a breeder of slaves, destroying his reputation within the realm.",
            "Sword Coast Adventures": "In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Jaheira and Khalid were sent on behalf of the Harpers to investigate the [[iron crisis]] and the [[Nashkel]] mines. They stayed at the [[Friendly Arm Inn]] and awaited the arrival of their friend and fellow Harper, Gorion. Unfortunately, Gorion was slain as he tried to smuggle his adopted son [[Abdel Adrian]] out of Candlekeep to safety. Jaheira and Khalid welcomed them and shared their plans to investigate the troubling goings-on that afflicted the Sword Coast.In the novels, Jaheira accompanies Abdel Adrian as they investigate and put an end to the iron crisis.\n\nJaheira accompanied Abdel to the [[Undercity]] of Baldur's Gate during the young [[Bhaalspawn]]'s final confrontation with his half-brother [[Sarevok Anchev]].\n\nIn order to get inside the fort, Jaheira sought an [[Temple of Bhaal (Forest of Wyrms)|abandoned temple]] of [[Bhaal]] that had recently been repurposed by [[Cyricist]]s. During her journey she picked up the warrior-[[skald (kit)|skald]] [[Voghiln]] and reunited with her ally who was then regarded as the Hero of Baldur's Gate.",
            "Time in Amn": "Following the defeat of the Shining Crusade in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Abdel Adrian was framed for murder, briefly imprisoned in Baldur's Gate, and discreetly released from holding. Jaheira and Khalid were quick to join up with them once again, alongside their friends Imoen, Minsc, and [[Dynaheir]]. Soon after they set out from Baldur's Gate, the adventurers became clouded by mist and captured by a group of [[Shadow Thieves]].\n\nJaheira woke up in a dungeon deep beneath the city of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]]. Some of her fellow companions were also imprisoned, while others, such as Khalid, had already been killed. Their captor was the [[elven]] [[wizard]] from [[Suldanessellar]] who had fallen from their grace, [[Jon Irenicus]].In the [[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (novel)| Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]] novel, Jaheira joins Abdel Adrian in his quest against [[Irenicus]]. The exact role Jaheira played in the lives of her allies after fleeing from the dungeon was unknown, but her adventures continued on far and wide across [[west Faerûn]]. One such adventure led Jaheira to the city of [[Neverwinter]], where she went undercover, taking on the wildshape of a [[goat]]. The druid was forced to break the cover and the wildshape to stop a murder.",
            "Return to the Heartlands": "[[File:Jaheira concept bg3.png|thumb|right|250px|''Mature Jaheira in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].'']]\n{{Quote|It is every Harper's hope to be a light that drives out darkness. But I've lived long enough to see so many of those lights burn out, while the shadows cling stubbornly on.|Jaheira.}}\n\nNot long after her time with Abdel and his companions, Jaheira and her fellow Harpers fought alongside druids of [[Emerald Enclave]] in their crusade against [[Ketheric Thorm]] and the forces of [[Shar]] at [[Moonrise Towers]]. About the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{Thorm-time}} the unified force managed to defeat the malevolent Thorm and imprison him within his family's mausoleum in [[Reithwin]]. Unfortunately, the united army was scattered when Ketheric Thorm brought down the [[shadow curse]] upon the lands, permanently twisting them for well over a century.\n\nSome time later, Jaheira made [[Elerrathin's home|herself a home]] in Baldur's Gate. Due to her life's calling, she was forced to spend much time away from her adopted and foster children, much to their chagrin. It was because of her children that she continued to live within a city that remained such a blight on the natural world.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Jaheira and Minsc fought alongside each other once again. The duo was the first to uncover information about the emerging threat posed by the [[cult of the Absolute]]. Unfortunately, Minsc raged head-first into battle, and they lost any opportunity to rally greater numbers. Jaheira unfortunately, was forced to leave Minsc behind in order to share news of the cult.  \n\nAfterward, Jaheira received Harper agents' reports about frequent cult activities within the [[shadow-cursed lands]], east of Baldur's Gate, and led a group of Harpers there to investigate. To her surprise, the High-Harper encountered [[Ketheric Thorm]], a man she thought killed and buried, leading the [[Absolute]]'s army. The High Harper shot an arrow into Ketheric's face, only to witness Ketheric pulling it out, healing immediately right in front of her eyes. Knowing she could not fight Ketheirc and his forces within the shadow-cursed lands directly, she fled with her Harper agents. Eventually, Jaheira found a safe haven, the roadside [[Last Light Inn]], protected by the [[Selûnite]] cleric named [[Isobel Thorm|Isobel]], whose magic held the shadow curse at bay. She understood the grave threat the cult of the Absolute posed to the folks of the Sword Coast and beyond and did her part to maintain the safehouse near the cult's headquarters at [[Moonrise Towers]]. Jaheira's family had only heard from her once during her stay, a mere seven words sent over by ''[[sending]].'' Her message was, \"I'm sorry, you know what to do,\" a message that meant that Jaheira perished in the line of duty and signaled her foster kids to leave the doomed city. That message, however, was ignored, and Jaheira's children remained in the Gate, later reuniting with her, unsurprised to see their mother alive. Despite Jaheira's words, she raised her children well, and they insisted on staying in Baldur's Gate to help against the armies of the Absolute."
