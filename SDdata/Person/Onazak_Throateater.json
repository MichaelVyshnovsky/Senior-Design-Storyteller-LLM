        "mainbody": "nazak Throateater was a hill giant proxy of the Giantish power known as Grolantor.\nOnazak was quite a strong hill giant, having been chosen by Grolantor as a proxy for that reason.\nDespite being a hill giant, Onazak was quite intelligent, more so than she let on. She wouldnt hesitate to manipulate those who got in her way.\nOnazak spent much of her time roaming the Steading and spreading disunity among the various stockades inhabited by the hill giant petitioners of that divine realm, turning their attention ever closer to Grolantor in the process.\nThe other hill giants in the Steading didnt give much thought to Onazak being a leader because of her gender, though this just allowed her to play around with politics in the realm however she saw fit."
