        "mainbody": "urthe Lornar was a slave turned pirate who was a loyal crew-member of the Kissing Shark helmed by Blackfingers Ralingor circa 1371 DR.\nKurthe was a big, very tall, heavily muscled human Konigheimer.\nLike many other escaped slaves, Kurthe had a hot temper. He often acted aggressively even towards his fellow crew members. Most people who interacted with him noticed his constantly scowling face.\nKurthe was a competent pirate who could easily use improvised weapons and daggers. He preferred direct approach to combat that lacked finesse. He often lost his cool in combat and fell into uncontrollable rage.\nAfter the Kissing Shark was destroyed, Kurthe Lornar became the de facto leader of the surviving Sharkers.\nThe only person who he was affectionate with was his fellow crew-member Sharessa \"The Shadow\" Stagwood.\nEven after his old captains, Blackfingers Ralingors death, Kurthe remained passionately loyal to him, to a fault.\nThe Kissing Shark was not the first ship Kurthe sailed with, the firs one was attacked and burnt down by Doegan Dogs in Port Halovar.\nSometime in 1371 DR, the pirate ship of Kissing Shark was destroyed in a blast of smoke powder. The captain of the ship Blackfingers Ralingor perished and only seven of the Sharkers survived. The ex-slave from Konigheim,  Kurthe \"Longshanks\" Lornar was one of them. Together the Sharkers saved one chest off the Kissing Shark. Later, the group found themselves in the tavern of Donders Dancing Masques in Tharkar. There a mysterious benefactor named Belmer Droon rescued them from one of the frequent bar fights, and help the Sharkers avoiding the brutal law enforcement of the Daggers of Tharkar.\nOnce the Sharkers and their savior reached the safety of Ankle Bells, Belmer revealed his agenda, he were too pay generously to a group of mercenaries to perform a mission in the capital of Doegan. After the pirates agreed, Belmer had their writs signed and they embarked on a mission to find and assassinate a noblewoman, Eidola of Neverwinter.\nUnder the cover of night, in secrecy, the group boarded the ship Morning Bird. Soon after the ship left the port, it came under an attack from an unknown black ship that bombarded the Bird with fire pot missiles and terrifying bone balls that melted away in the flames revealing dancing floating armed skeletons. The Sharkers and their benefactors managed to fight off the undead and evaded the black ship with the aid of Balmers box of mists and a prayer-token of Umberlee. The box transported ship into a different part of the sea away from the pursuit, but the prayer token of the fickle goddess summoned her servants on board of the ghost ship. The ship spawned the dreaded sea zombies and the crew of Morning Bird had to appease Umberlee by tossing their valuables overboard.\nDuring the short respite, the suspicious employer mixed an exotic drug yulchass powder in with the crews food. The powder has a side effect of making its imbibers truthful. This made the Konigheimer even more suspicious of their boss, even though Belmer had good reasons. The ship followed them, somehow tracking them. After a long search, the Sharkers and  Belmer found a magical scrying device hidden on the bottom on the Sharker chest..\nSoon after, the mysterious black ship, now identified as the Black Dragon, caught up with the Morning Bird. The pursuing captain was the infamous Orim Redbeard, the pirate responsible for the death of Blackfingers Ralingor. Kruthes short temper and rabid devotion to his old captain pushed him to attempt to attack Redbeard. Belmer knowing to expect it hit the tall Konigheimer over the head knocking him out. Orim Redbeard realized that he pursued the wrong ship, and left the Sharkers in peace. Meanwhile, Kurthe Lornar came back to his senses, fuming with rage over the what he perceived as betrayal. He attacked the benefactor in blind rage, while his fellow Sharkers stayed out of combat. Belmer showed uncanny skill and finesse avoiding Kurthes brute attacks. Giving the hotheaded pirates plenty of warnings, Belmer continued leaving cuts and slices on Konigheimers body. The pirate never stood down and died soaked in his own blood with Belmers dagger in his neck.."
