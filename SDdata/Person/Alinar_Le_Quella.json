        "Activities": "Alinar's passion was hunting but in a very unorthodox way: he always used blunt arrows because he liked tracking and locating his targets, not killing them. Alinar was vegetarian. Sometimes Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] sent Alinar on missions to [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Personality": "Alinar was a friendly and outgoing individual. However, during missions he showed a cool professional mind and would not let anything and anyone menace Evermeet.",
