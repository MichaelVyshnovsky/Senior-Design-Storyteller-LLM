Alinar was vegetarian. Sometimes Queen Amlaruil Moonflower sent Alinar on missions to Faer√ªn.\nAlinar was a friendly and outgoing individual. However, during missions he showed a cool professional mind and would not let anything and anyone menace Evermeet.\nAlinar wielded one of the Baneblades of Demron, Dragathil.\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryMoon elves\nCategoryArchers\nCategoryHunters\nCategoryInhabitants of Evermeet\nCategoryInhabitants of the Trackless Sea\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\ndwr44d7j924e4n1insedu7zm8frh10s"
