'''{{PAGENAME}}''' was the leader and major stakeholder of the [[Shield Trading Company]], headquartered in [[Voonlar]],{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|23}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 18: The Finest Beds in Town}} some years before the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]], through at least the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. Zaravron was originally a trader in textiles but he greatly expanded the business into a large merchant house that had caravan routes throughout the [[Dalelands]] and the [[Moonsea]] region in [[north Faerûn]]. Despite the great influence of the [[Zhentarim]] in the same geographical and economic regions, Zaravron managed to keep the Shield Trading Company independent and unaffiliated with that organization.

In his later years, Zaravron became somewhat of a recluse and was seldom seen in public.
