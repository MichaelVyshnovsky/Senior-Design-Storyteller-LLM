was the leader and major stakeholder of the Shield Trading Company, headquartered in Voonlar, some years before the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR, through at least the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. Zaravron was originally a trader in textiles but he greatly expanded the business into a large merchant house that had caravan routes throughout the Dalelands and the Moonsea region in north Faerûn. Despite the great influence of the Zhentarim in the same geographical and economic regions, Zaravron managed to keep the Shield Trading Company independent and unaffiliated with that organization.
In his later years, Zaravron became somewhat of a recluse and was seldom seen in public.
