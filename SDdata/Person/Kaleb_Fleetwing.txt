Kaleb Fleetwing was the messenger of Lord Partic Thistle, and served him at Thistleflame Keep circa 1369 DR.
Kaleb had a wiry build, with rakish good looks and a perpetual smirk.
Kaleb was easily excited and dragged into competitions.
Kaleb had boots of speed that aided in his job of running messages, as well as a simple short sword and club. He was also entrusted with Lord Thistles signet ring.
As the Lords messenger, he was often seen dashing back and forth across Suzail delivering dispatches. He was usually the first person in the household a person would interact with when summoned.
Kaleb was friends with the steward Travis Ormaster, but had a one-sided competition with the gardener Berke Glorata over who was more popular with the ladies. He didnt get along well with the handyman Borin Woodbracer, who was friends with Berke.
