'''Kaleb Fleetwing''' was the messenger of Lord [[Partic Thistle]], and served him at [[Thistleflame Keep]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
Kaleb had a wiry build, with rakish good looks and a perpetual smirk.

==Personality==
Kaleb was easily excited and dragged into competitions.

==Possessions==
Kaleb had ''[[boots of speed]]'' that aided in his job of running messages, as well as a simple [[short sword]] and [[club]]. He was also entrusted with Lord Thistle's signet ring.

==Activities==
As the Lord's messenger, he was often seen dashing back and forth across [[Suzail]] delivering dispatches. He was usually the first person in the household a person would interact with when summoned.

==Relationships==
Kaleb was friends with the steward [[Travis Ormaster]], but had a one-sided competition with the gardener [[Berke Glorata]] over who was more popular with the ladies. He didn't get along well with the handyman [[Borin Woodbracer]], who was friends with Berke.
