        "mainbody": "Zetharmas was a tiefling warlock in the Plane of Shadow in 1374 DR. \nZetharmas was rumored to be the scion of a powerful demon lord, but nobody knew if this was true. He was one of the main leaders of the Church of Cyric faction involved in the Despayrs plot in 1374 DR. Zetharmas was the one that materially opened the hole in the Weave. He and his fellow Cyricists resided in the Monastery of Ebon Dome on the Plane of Shadow for the duration of the plot. However, an adventurers party defeated him."
