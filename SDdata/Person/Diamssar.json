        "mainbody": "Diamssar was a representative of the Triceratops Society in Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the late 15 century DR. Secretly, he was actually a spy for a group of yuan-ti.\nHe had pale skin and dressed in dark clothes.\nHiss skills with deception hid his true fanatical nature.\nHe was in possession of a potion of healing and a jeweled dagger. \nDiamssar worked with the Harper agent Soggy Wren, whom he had been manipulating into finding the pieces of a Dreamers Amulet that had been smuggled into Port Nyanzaru by his yuan-ti masters. He was affiliated with Lekhet, a yuan-ti pureblood.\nHe had a pet giant poisonous snake. \nDuring the events of the death curse around 1490 DR, Diamssar was a double agent for a group of yuan-ti while working as a representative of the Triceratops Society. For the Triceratops Society, he worked outside the public bathhouse. His secret yuan-ti business operated out of the abandoned Northside Market Textile House warehouse in the Market Ward."
