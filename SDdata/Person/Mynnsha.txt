'''Mynnsha''' was a [[priestess]] of [[Talona]] active in [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the High Priestess of the [[Temple of Talona (Bezantur)|Temple of Talona]] in that city as well as the chief priest for the entire Thayan [[church of Talona]].

==Description==
Like the rest of her fellow priests and priestesses, Mynnsha had fanciful [[tattoo]]s and scars on her body.

==Personality==
She delighted in the spread of disease and poison.

==Activities==
Many in Bezantur&mdash;from the commonfolk to the [[Red Wizards]]&mdash;suspected that Mynnsha and her followers were responsible for the many poisonings that happened throughout the city. Regardless of the truth of these accusations, Mynnsha bribed the city's authorities to leave her alone and to provide support if and when the citizenry attacked her temple in an angry mob.
