        "mainbody": "'''Nexlit''' was the leader of cattle-raider tribe of [[xvart]]s of the [[Cloud Peaks]] area west of [[Nashkel]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Possessions": "Nexlit the Xvart was armed with a simple [[short sword]].",
        "History": "As of [[1368 DR]], Nexlit led his tribe to raid, kill, and capture [[cow]]s from the local farmers. One such raid was led to the [[Lonely Peaks]] where Nexlit's xvarts attempted to massacre [[Hulrik]]'s bovine companion. Nexlit believed that his tribe was protected by [[Ursa]] the [[cave bear]] who resided nearby. He called the bear kind; however, Ursa felt no particular kinship with the diminutive humanoids and was likely to rend them as it was to rend any adventurers trying to stop xvart cattle raids."
