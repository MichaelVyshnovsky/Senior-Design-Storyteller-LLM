'''Karna Stonekeel''' was a shipwright of [[New Sarshell]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
During the late 14{{th}} century DR, Karna Stonekeel was one of the most sought-after shipwrights of New Sarshell; her dwarven crew had a reputation for quick and efficient work, though not one for sailing. The shipwright had a famously long backlog.

==History==
In {{yearlink|1396}}, Captain [[Thoster]] retained her services to repair the [[Green Siren]] after returning from [[Xxiphu]] with the ship.{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP|112|10}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Though after Thoster's return from Xxiphu, Karna Stonekeel told him that the amount he'd paid for repairs would do for the lumber and canvas, Thoster later related to Anusha that he'd paid the shipwright a king's ransom.
