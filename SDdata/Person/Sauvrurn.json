        "mainbody": "'''Sauvrurn''' was a nobleman from [[Marsember]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "He was not enthusiastic about the prospect of bedding [[Alusair Nacacia Obarskyr]], and treason, for all his antipathy regarding the [[Obarskyr]]s, was still a prospect he was jittery about.",
        "Appearance": "He sounded cultured, and used a strong, musky perfume.",
        "Relationships": "He conspired together with [[Thandro]] as a member of the [[Rightful Conspiracy]].",
        "Possessions": "He'd been able to gather together a comb that slew lice, a head for a walking stick that always knew north, and three more baubles from his family.",
        "History": "Sauvrurn and Thandro discussed their involvement in a future assassination attempt on [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]] and Alusair, respectively queen and princess regent of [[Cormyr]], in {{yearlink|1373}}. He was reticent to do much, but Thandro reassured him enough to get him to participate in the planned assassination. He had gathered five minor baubles in advance, and could muster twelve swordsmen; he was instructed to head for a lamppost near [[Thelvarspike Lane]] in advance of their attack on [[Thundaerlyn Hall]]. Their discussion happened in a warehouse full of [[Selgauntan glowstone]]s, which prevented them from being scried on, but unknown to them, two merchants and fugitives, [[Malakar Surth]] and [[Bezrar]] were eavesdropping on them."
