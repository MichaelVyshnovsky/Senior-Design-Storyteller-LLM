Arriving in the Port of Shadow, Kesra quickly solidified the TanorThals influence, mostly disturbing Malakuths businesses.\nKesra was the niece and representative of Matron Mother Haelra TanorThal. Her older cousins, Ilmra TanorThal and Olorae TanrorThal, saw her success as a threat and planned for her removal. Malakuth despised her, more for her Houses crimes than personally."
