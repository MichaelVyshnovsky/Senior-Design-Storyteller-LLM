'''Jak Timberline''' was a [[human]] man from the village of [[Pengallen]] in the [[Silver Marches]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a farmer.

==Description & Personality==
Jak was an old man, with gray, thinning hair and a wrinkled, tanned face. He said he did not care about a person's race, and took the effort to pronounce Drizzt's name correctly.

==History==
In the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1357}},<ref> Jak was at the bar of the local inn when [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] arrived. Jak wasn't afraid of the [[drow]] [[elf]] like [[Aganis]] the barkeep, and said he had heard stories of Drizzt's good deeds at [[Mithril Hall]]. He also informed Drizzt that the [[goblin]] [[Nojheim]], whom the drow had recaptured, was a slave of [[Rico Pengallen]].
