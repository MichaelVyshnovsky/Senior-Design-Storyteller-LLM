}}'''Antatlab of the Shaking Stones''' was the head of the [[College of Elemental Magic]], the College that gathered all wizards with the most exotic specializations, and one of the members of the [[Conclave of Sshamath]] in the city of [[Sshamath]] in the year [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Rumors said Antatlab was a secret worshiper of [[Vhaeraun]].

In [[1379 DR]], Antatlab was totally against the proposal by Master [[Guldor Zauviir]] to elevate [[T'lar Mizz'rynturl]], Master of [[Bae'qeshel]] Magic, as a new member of the Conclave. This was because Antatlab thought the bardic traditions were not true magic.
