'''Rinda''' was the author of the ''[[Cyrinishad]]'' and the ''[[True Life of Cyric]]''.

==Personality==
Rinda genuinely cared for people around her, especially those less fortunate. She was very serious in her duty to keep secret the ''Cyrinishad'', in order to keep it out of evil hands.

==History==
Rinda was born to a scribe in [[Zhentil Keep]] and grew up in a slum. In [[1368 DR]], her father failed to create a magic book for the god [[Cyric]] and out of desperation said that Rinda was more able than him. Cyric's minions abducted her and made Rinda write the ''Cyrinishad''. Noticing her talents, the gods [[Oghma]], [[Mystra]], and [[Mask]] instructed Rinda to also write the ''True Life of Cyric'' to counterbalance the evil of the ''Cyrinishad''. In the end, the plotting around the two books caused the destruction of Zhentil, but thanks to Oghma's protection Rinda managed to escape, with orders to keep the ''Cyrinshad'' away from ''all'' gods. From that day, Rinda wandered [[Toril]]. In [[1371 DR]] near [[Candlekeep]] the [[Chosen]] of [[Cyric]] [[Malik el Sami]] lied his way into Candlekeep and butchered several innocents in his hunt of the ''[[Cyrinishad]]'', including a monk of the [[Avowed]], along with Rinda and her protector Gwydion.
