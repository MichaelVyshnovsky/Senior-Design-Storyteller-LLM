Master '''Garron Ersemm''' was a skilled horseman and horse breaker and captain of the cavalry under the control of the Countess of [[Calimmon]], Lady [[Kyrin Hawkwinter]]. He was also her fiancé, having come with her from [[Waterdeep]] during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Reclamation Wars|Reclamation Wars]].

Garron was almost perpetually happy and was well-loved by the young horse soldiers of Tethyr's cavalry.

A worshiper of [[Torm]], Garron joined the [[Loyal Order of Innocents]] after its creation by [[Zaranda Star|Queen Zaranda]] in [[1369 DR]]. Garron spent time at least four times a year at [[Fortress Faithful]] a [[Tyr]]an keep.
