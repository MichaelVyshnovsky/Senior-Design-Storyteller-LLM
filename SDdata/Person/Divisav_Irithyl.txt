'''Divisav Irithyl''' was the first son of [[Kahvoerm Irithyl]] and the second of the family line to attempt to draw the [[Rulers' Blade]] and become the [[Coronal]] of [[Cormanthyr]] in {{Yearlink|-2900}}. Unlike his father and all of his line to follow, Divisav failed on account of his greed and was consumed by the [[elfblade]]. He died instantly in a bout of arcane green fire. The blade was thus passed to Kahvoerm's youngest great-grandson, [[Sakrattars Irithyl]], who become second Coronal.
