'''Inshula sar Mashewe''' and her sister [[Kwesi sar Mashewe]] were huntswomen and bounty hunters active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Inshula was a tall and beautiful [[Tashlutan]] woman, just like her sister. However, despite her beauty, her steely gaze and muscular body betrayed her vocation and strength. Some compared her body language to that of a strung [[bow]], ready to shoot an [[arrow]] at any moment.

==Possessions==
Inshula sar Mashewe. She also carried a deck of cards which she consulted when seeking guidance from her deity – [[Savras]]. He wore a set of unique [[enchanted]] [[Inshula's armor|hides]] and ''[[Inshula's Preyhunter|Preyhunter]]'' [[crossbow]].

==Relationships==
Inshula spent most of her life traveling and hunting alongside her sister Kwesi. Her [[animal companion]] was a pitch-black fierce [[panther]] named [[Areghaeb]].

==History==
Inshula and Kwesi sar Mashewe were huntresses in training from the city of [[Tashluta]]. The women honed their skills in tracking dangerous beasts. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the sisters traveled by sea to the hidden nation of [[Samarach]] and organized hunting expeditions from the city of [[Samargol]]. Their goal was to become stronger and more experienced to travel back home to Chult across the dangerous mountains that separated the two regions of the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. During one of their hunts, the sisters came across a legendary giant [[dire boar]] [[Bal'alak]]. Inshula and Kwesi showered the beast with [[bolt]]s but could not slay it. Retreating, Kwesi was injured and was forced to make a living dispensing bounties for monster parts in Samargol at the behest of the city's guards as she healed. Inshula, however, was still willing to hunt beasts and offered her services to traveling adventurers. Unlike Kwesi, Inshula was impatient and did not want to deal with Samargol's governors, thinking them cowards.

Eventually, Inshula sar Mashewe traveled to the [[Sword Coast]] and spent some time hunting there. However, with time she developed a longing for home and subsequently reunited with Kwesi, and they both returned to Tashluta.
