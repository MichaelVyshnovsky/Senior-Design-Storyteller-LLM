Inshula sar Mashewe and her sister Kwesi sar Mashewe were huntswomen and bounty hunters active in the late 14 century DR.
Inshula was a tall and beautiful Tashlutan woman, just like her sister. However, despite her beauty, her steely gaze and muscular body betrayed her vocation and strength. Some compared her body language to that of a strung bow, ready to shoot an arrow at any moment.
Inshula sar Mashewe. She also carried a deck of cards which she consulted when seeking guidance from her deity – Savras. He wore a set of unique enchanted hides and Preyhunter crossbow.
Inshula spent most of her life traveling and hunting alongside her sister Kwesi. Her animal companion was a pitch-black fierce panther named Areghaeb.
Inshula and Kwesi sar Mashewe were huntresses in training from the city of Tashluta. The women honed their skills in tracking dangerous beasts. In the , the sisters traveled by sea to the hidden nation of Samarach and organized hunting expeditions from the city of Samargol. Their goal was to become stronger and more experienced to travel back home to Chult across the dangerous mountains that separated the two regions of the Chultan Peninsula. During one of their hunts, the sisters came across a legendary giant dire boar Balalak. Inshula and Kwesi showered the beast with bolts but could not slay it. Retreating, Kwesi was injured and was forced to make a living dispensing bounties for monster parts in Samargol at the behest of the citys guards as she healed. Inshula, however, was still willing to hunt beasts and offered her services to traveling adventurers. Unlike Kwesi, Inshula was impatient and did not want to deal with Samargols governors, thinking them cowards.
Eventually, Inshula sar Mashewe traveled to the Sword Coast and spent some time hunting there. However, with time she developed a longing for home and subsequently reunited with Kwesi, and they both returned to Tashluta.
