        "Activities": "Zundaerazylym sometimes took the place of Moonstone Mask workers who were sick, making herself look exactly like the worker. Ophala Cheldarstorn led her employees to believe that it was she who was the source of this magic. She sometimes helped Ophala by smuggling guests out of the Moonstone Mask in her laundry basket, who needed to leave undetected for a number of reasons. On several occasions, she flew members of the Lord's Alliance out of Neverwinter.{{Cite dragon/259/Wyrms of the North: Zundaerazylym}}",
        "Relationships": "Zundaerazylym's most trusted friend and ally was [[Ophala Cheldarstorn]], her boss at the Moonstone Mask, and one of the few that knew her true nature. Cheldarstorn even kept the dragon's hoard magically hidden (somewhere other than underground or inside the Moonstone Mask or Bright Weaves Laundry).{{Cite dragon/259/Wyrms of the North: Zundaerazylym}} Zundaerazylym had a good relationship with the female adventuring company the [[Galadran Company]] and their patron, the [[copper dragon]] [[Galadaeros]].\n\nShe liked adventurers but was wary of unfamiliar wizards, mercenary companies, and secret organizations. She disliked tyrants and bullies, often teaching them a (non-fatal) lesson in Neverwinter.{{Cite dragon/259/Wyrms of the North: Zundaerazylym}}"
