'''Taeglyn''' was a carpenter that lived on the [[Sword Coast]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Digging.... too quickly. Felt tunnel... collapsing. Kept going. Better dead than... worg meat.''|Taeglyn}}

==Relationships==
He had two children, including a son named [[Galan]].

==Possessions==
Taeglyn's shoe had the image of a heart placed upon it by his son Galan. It was a reminder of his son that Taeglyn could look to when away from his family.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Taeglyn was traveling to [[Baldur's Gate]] when he was captured by [[goblin]] raiders loyal to the [[Cult of the Absolute]] and taken to the [[Shattered Sanctum]]. He died that same year while trying to tunnel out of his cell, not willing to allow himself to be fed to the goblin's [[worg]]s.
