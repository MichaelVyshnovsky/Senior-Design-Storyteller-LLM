'''Brielbara''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]] living in [[Baldur's Gate]] on the [[Sword Coast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was one of the most notable mages in the city ''circa'' [[1358 DR]]. She was known for developing many new [[spell]]s.

==Relations==
She was the daughter of the [[Archmage]] [[Briel]]. In her library, she had her father's personal memoirs, ''[[A Life Lived in the Shadows of Death]]''.<ref>

She was once married to the mage [[Yago]], but had a brief affair with the adventurer [[Coran]], the result of which was a [[half-elf]] daughter, [[Namara (half-elf)|Namara]]. Yago was enraged, but Coran did not know of his daughter.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Yago cursed Namara, leaving her dying. Brielbara sought aid from mercenaries to steal ''[[Yago's Book of Curses]]'' from his room at the [[Low Lantern]], so she could lift the curse.
