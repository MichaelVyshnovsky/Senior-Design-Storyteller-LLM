Zammzt Everharn was a drow-dragon (draazekylyn) and one of the eight patron fathers of the Jaezred Chaulssin. Specifically, he was the Patron Father of Ched Nasad.
Zammzts humanoid form was notably plain, with most characters comparing his features to those of a common artisan or slave. It was often noted that if not for his compelling charisma and shrewd negotiating skills he would likely be very limited in Underdark society due to his nondescript face.
Zammzt was involved in the slave uprising in Menzoberranzan during the Silence of Lolth. Shortly after, Zammzt was a key (but secret) figure in the destruction of Ched Nasad in 1372 DR. He instructed the duergar Clan Xornbane, who had been hired by Matron Mother Ssipriina Zauvirr, to act prematurely in attacking House Melarn, thus drawing House Zauvirrs wrath, and action to brought about the downfall of the city.
