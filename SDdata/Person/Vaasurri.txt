Vaasurri was a killoren who lived with his human friend Uthalion in a secluded grove in the Spur Forest. Like most killoren, he was highly attuned to the natural world.
In 1479 DR, one of Uthalions old friends, who was on a mission to rescue a young genasi from a cult, sought their aid as guides to the ruined city of Tohrepur. In Tohrepur, Vaasurri and friends killed Lord Khault, the leader of the cult, but were forced to kill the captive genasi.	
Vaasurri carried a bone sword.	
Vaasurri had green skin. His hair and eye color changed depending on the aspect of nature he was currently manifesting.
