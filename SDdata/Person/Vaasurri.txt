'''Vaasurri''' was a [[killoren]] who lived with his [[human]] friend [[Uthalion]] in a secluded grove in the [[Spur Forest]]. Like most killoren, he was highly attuned to the natural world.

In [[1479 DR]], one of Uthalion's old friends, who was on a mission to rescue a young [[genasi]] from a cult, sought their aid as guides to the ruined city of [[Tohrepur]]. In Tohrepur, Vaasurri and friends killed [[Khault|Lord Khault]], the leader of the cult, but were forced to kill the captive genasi.
