        "mainbody": "Porb Piiradost was a member of the Piiradost noble family of Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.\nHe had graying dark hair and dark eyes. He wore silver robes, a belt, and rings beneath a green cloak.\nIn the late 1490s DR, Lord Forge Fitzwilliam of Neverwinter revived the High Sun Games, a blood-sport in which adventurers would battle monsters in a maze in the newly built Neverwinter arena. Porb Piiradost was one of a number of rich, powerful, and unscrupulous people who came to bet big on the Games and brought their riches with them. However, they needed a secure place to store their riches. To this end, Forge offered the use of Castle Nevers treasure vault, but Porb and the others wished to see its security for themselves. Thus, Forge his advisor Sofina showed Porb Piiradost and Din Caldwell around the castle, boasting of its upgraded security and suitability for storing their wealth in its vault, which was protected with a powerful Mordenkainens arcane seal. Porb had to ask why Forge had revived the games, but Forge deflected with a joke. However, they were interrupted when Sofina sensed the presence of a wild shaped druid—Doric—spying on them, but she escaped Sofina and the castle guards.\nNevertheless, Porb and the others trusted their wealth to Forge Fitzwilliam. This would prove to be unwise as Forge stole it all and, during the High Sun Games, tried to abscond the city with it. Meanwhile, Porb and the others bet on the contestants and the monsters Din idly asked Porb if hed ever eaten displacer beast flesh, but Porb declared it too gamey for his liking. Both their fortunes were later lost, scattered over the streets of Neverwinter for the common people to collect. But Porb was not to know because, while he was watching and betting on the Games, Sofina revealed herself as a Red Wizard of Thay"
