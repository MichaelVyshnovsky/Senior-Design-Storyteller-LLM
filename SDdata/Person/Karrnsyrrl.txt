Karrnsyrrl was an ancient red dragon that wracked havoc across Daggerford, the surrounding Sword Coast, and even islands off the Sea of Swords during the late 15 century DR.
After being released unto the Realms, Karrnsyrrl enjoyed a partnership with the malevolent rakshasa named Nadir.

Prior to the slaadi invasion of Daggerford that broke out some time during or around the , Karrnsyrrl was trapped within a long lost iron flask that was recently recovered by the rakshasa Nadir. While the exact circumstances of the events were unclear, it was known that Nadir used the Ambergul Blade to unstop the cork from the flask, and let loose Karrnsyrrl upon the Realms.
The ancient dragon erupted from Daggerford Castle in a raging inferno and ravaged the town. He snatched in his claws the nobleman Christos Tellos, who had previously uncovered the iron flask, and flew him away from the city. and as far to the southwest as Corwell, on the isle of Gwynneth in the Moonshaes. While in there, Karrnsyrrl was turned away by a ki-rin named Daiwon.
A group of adventurers tracked Karrnsyrrl along his path of destruction, and eventually made their way to the Sword Mountains on the Sword Coast North. After delving into the crypt of Uruth Ukrypt, the adventures became imminently aware that both Karrnsyrrl and Nadir were about to attack them.
