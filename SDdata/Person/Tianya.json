        "mainbody": "Tianya was an adventuring half-elven druid member of the The Winter Rose from the North Faer√ªn.\nTianya was quite beautiful. She wore black leathers and kept her black hair shoulder-length. She carried a quarterstaff and had her trusty sling ready.\nSome time long before the , Tianya was abandoned by her parents, who did not wish a child to ruin their \"perfect\" lives. Growing up alone, Tianya picked up on the role of a druid who took care of the wilderness that was her home. Eventually, by chance, she met Sirge de La Sunya of Athkatla and his companion Kepp Trapmaster and later joined them as a member of the adventuring fellowship of the Winter Rose. With the group, she traveled to the Monastery of the Yellow Rose where they were joined by a tiefling monk Naleen, and two more adventurers, Llendril Coe of the Hand of the Seldarine and Dalwynd Meadsbreath. Together they became known as self-proclaimed defenders of the North."
