        "Appearance": "Tianya was quite beautiful. She wore black [[leather]]s and kept her black hair shoulder-length. She carried a [[quarterstaff]] and had her trusty [[sling]] ready.",
        "History": "Some time long before the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, Tianya was abandoned by her parents, who did not wish a child to ruin their \"perfect\" lives. Growing up alone, Tianya picked up on the role of a druid who took care of the wilderness that was her home. Eventually, by chance, she met [[Sirge de La Sunya]] of [[Athkatla]] and his companion [[Kepp Trapmaster]] and later joined them as a member of the adventuring fellowship of the Winter Rose. With the group, she traveled to the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]] where they were joined by a [[tiefling]] [[monk]] [[Naleen]], and two more adventurers, [[Llendril Coe]] of the [[Hand of the Seldarine]] and [[Dalwynd Meadsbreath]]. Together they became known as self-proclaimed defenders of the North."
