        "mainbody": "was the alias used by an illithid archmage that had taken up residence in the Whistling Wizard inn located in Voonlar sometime before the conflict known as the Battle at the Bar. It magically disguised itself as a tall, male human and claimed to be from Westgate on the Dragon Coast.\nWhen the battle erupted, the fighting spread throughout the inn and the surrounding grounds. Klondras was drawn into the conflict somewhere on the upper floor above the common room against members of the Harpers. The heavily and haphazardly enchanted bar was near the focal point of the spell battle taking place between members of the Tarntar (a crime syndicate from Sembia) and the Simbul, six of her apprentices, and Storm Silverhand. Some freak combination of spells and enchantments caused the bar to explode violently, collapsing part of the upper floor down into the common room. At that moment, Klondras was in the middle of shapeshifting to a new form and the flying debris and fall caused major brain damage. Unable to transform, cast spells, or use its mind powers, it was last seen fleeing into the forest, screaming in distress.\nCategoryMind flayers\nCategoryArchmages\nCategoryInhabitants of the Whistling Wizard\nCategoryInhabitants of Voonlar\nCategoryInhabitants of the Moonsea\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nnwj5oi7mrx9s5a3bvxdmcua4e4ll5jl"
