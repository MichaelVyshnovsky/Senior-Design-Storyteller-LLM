'''Kirsoph Vinson''' was a member of the [[Vinson]] family of [[Amn]] in the late 13{{th}} to early-to-mid 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. He was the Lord of House Vinson from [[1299 DR]] and the first Dahaunarch on the [[Council of Six]] from [[1333 DR]] to [[1342 DR]].


==Personality==
Such was his stinginess that he was nicknamed the "Kobold Lord".

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1342}}, a mere nine years after the Council of Six was formed, Kirsoph, though then still relatively young, grew impatient for advancement and prestige and ordered his agents to kill the Pommarch. However, the Kobold Lord evidently did not pay them enough, for the Pommarch bribed Kirsoph's agents with double their annual salary to betray and kill their master. With his death, the Vinsons faded into obscurity.
