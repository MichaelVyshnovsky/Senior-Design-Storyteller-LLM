Kirsoph Vinson was a member of the Vinson family of Amn in the late 13 to early-to-mid 14 centuries DR. He was the Lord of House Vinson from 1299 DR and the first Dahaunarch on the Council of Six from 1333 DR to 1342 DR.
Such was his stinginess that he was nicknamed the "Kobold Lord".
In the , a mere nine years after the Council of Six was formed, Kirsoph, though then still relatively young, grew impatient for advancement and prestige and ordered his agents to kill the Pommarch. However, the Kobold Lord evidently did not pay them enough, for the Pommarch bribed Kirsophs agents with double their annual salary to betray and kill their master. With his death, the Vinsons faded into obscurity.
