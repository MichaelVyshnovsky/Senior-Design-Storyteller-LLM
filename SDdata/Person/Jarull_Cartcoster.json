        "mainbody": "'''Jarull Cartcoster''' was a young man of [[Yhaunn]] who fell afoul of a [[Sharran]] plot in [[1373 DR]].",
        "Description": "Jarull was a large, powerfully built man. His [[orc|orcish]] ancestry granted him heavier features and a grayish cast to his skin.",
        "Relationships": "Jarull's paternal grandmother was an orc, and his [[half-orc]] father had died early in his life on a foolish adventure. His only remaining family member was his mother [[Hane Cartcoster|Hane]], who was perpetually worried that her son would also meet a poor end. He paid no heed to her worries.\n\nHe met [[Keph Thingoleir]] as a teenager, and the two of them became inseparable friends who caroused and brawled across the city.",
        "History": "In [[Kythorn]] of the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]] he voluntarily joined the secretive [[Temple of Shar (Yhaunn)|Temple of Shar]], only to be held prisoner by [[Variance Amatick]], who tortured him and denied him food and water. In this time, Variance stole his identity and used his persona to manipulate Keph into joining the cult and falling under her influence.\n\nWhile he was missing from home, his mother had Keph arrested and interrogated on suspicion of his involvement, and had [[Strasus Thingoleir]] attempt to [[Divination|magically divine]] his location, to no effect.\n\nWhen Keph refused to have any more dealings with the cult, Variance revealed the real Jarull and used him as a hostage to ensure Keph would continue serving her interests.\n\nJarull was finally rescued by Guard Captain [[Manas]] after two tendays, physically and mentally broken. He was then sent to the [[Rack of Glory|temple of Ilmater]] for treatment and recovery."
