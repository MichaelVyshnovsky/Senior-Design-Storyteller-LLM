Little Erik was a bandit thug in the Moonsea in 1489 DR.
Erik believed that a hag had cursed him and he would die when he heard a screeching cry. Thus tis sound often paralyzed him fear.
Little Erik was one of the two lieutenants of the Gray Patriots bandit group under Sahnd Krulek. During a meeting with another bandit group, the Claws of Tiamat, an adventuring party hired to clean the Iron Route of outlaws caused havoc and in fighting Little Erik was killed.
