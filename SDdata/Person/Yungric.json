        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Yungric was known to be a stereotype of an old, mad, cackling alchemist. It was surprising that with all the mad concoctions, the man's eyebrows remained unsinged. Despite eccentricities, Yungric's skills as a miracle worker made his a popular alchemist for hire in Neverwinter."
