        "mainbody": "Dimble was a rock gnome living in Gnomengarde in the late 15 century DR.\nDimble was responsible for producing the oil that fueled Gnomengardes lanterns and inventions. He operated the complicated contraption that pressed Gnomengardes unique red mushrooms to extract their oil. From each big specimen, Dimble could extract four flasks of oil.\nLike all the other gnomes in Gnomengarde, Dimble had some training as a wizard in addition to his innate abilities. In combat, he preferred to attack with spells like ray of frost and magic missile."
