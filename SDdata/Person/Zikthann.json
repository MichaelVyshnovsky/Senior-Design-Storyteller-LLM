        "mainbody": "Zikthann of the Six Scepters was a human lich living in Sshamath in the year 1370 DR. \nZikthann was a wizard from Illusk. After the fall of his country in 1244 DR, he wandered around north Faer√ªn for many years, eventually entering the Arcane Brotherhood to become one of the Old Ones. While exploring the Netherese Caverns, Zikthann covertly followed a Sshamathan patrol to the city. He acted as chief trade representative of the Host Tower of the Arcane in Sshamath, although Zikthann never told his fellows the source of the spells and magic items he exported to Luskan, giving him tight control over the new magic."
