'''Edowin''' was a [[True Soul]] of [[the Absolute]] who joined [[Cult of the Absolute|her cult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Wait. Protect them.|Edowin directing a stranger to care for his charges.}}

==Description==
The [[dwarven]] cultist had white-gray hair, he kept brushed back with two loose braids, and wore a full beard. Edowin wore a black quilted tunic over an embroidered green shirt and green pants, with [[leather]] boots. He adorned himself with a necklace bearing the symbol of the Absolute.

Edowin had implanted within his head a [[mind flayer]] tadpole.

==Relationships==

He was closely followed by two devoted followers, his siblings [[Andrick]] and [[Brynna]]. The young cultists all-but worshipped Edowin, and were completely lost without him.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Edowin and his followers were directed to recover recover a ''[[mysterious artifact]]'' which had fallen from a [[nautiloid|mind flayer vessel]] that crashed down to [[Faer√ªn]] after traveling across several [[planes of existence]]. During their mission, Edowin was gravely wounded by an [[owlbear]] who had left her den in a nearby cave.

His last dying words were asking someone he saw as a fellow True Soul to take care of Andryick and Brynna. He truly cared for their wellbeing, beyond their devotion to the Absolute.
