'''Thail''' was a [[wizard]] adventuring in the [[Company of the Bright Spear]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was older than his companions.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|25-27|2}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005||2}}Were this to include [[Delg]], that'd render Thail either a [[half-elf]] or an [[elf]]. Shandril's attestation that she never saw elves suggests he's a half-elf, but no mention is made of this fact. It is possible Thail is just oldest amongst the humans.

==Abilities==
Thail could cast a [[spell]] that launched projectiles of light, almost certainly ''[[magic missile]]'', and considered within his power a spell that put foes to sleep, almost certainly ''[[sleep]]''.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|32-35|2}}

==Possessions==
He owned at least one [[spellbook]],{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|29-30|2}} He carried a ''[[potion of healing]]''.

==Relationships==
He largely deferred to his companions.

==History==
Prior to [[Mirtul 6]] of the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Thail had gathered from records in [[Suzail]] that elves had lived by the [[Sember River]].

Thail was a part of the Company of the Bright Spear on that date, when they stopped at [[the Rising Moon (inn)|the Rising Moon]] in [[Highmoon]]. There, after [[Lynxal]] of the company was slain, the whole company's valuables were robbed by [[Shandril Shessair]], who asked to join them to replace their [[thief]]. They rode from Highmoon to [[Myth Drannor]]. Along the way, when confronted by heavy mist, Thail was ambivalent on whether they should continue within the mist or wait until it lifted. He was the first one to notice the water when they reached the edge of the [[Semberflow]] by evening. He was also the one to identify the best place to cross the river. He fought alongside the company when they were attacked afterwards, deciding not to use a spell to make their foes fall asleep given the situation, on [[Mirtul 12]].

After [[Elminster]] interfered by making their foes flee, Thail was sent to collect the company's [[horse]]s.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|38-40|2}} Shandril left to scout ahead following the attackers' caravan. When she returned after following a detachment sent to kill their pursuers, Thail rendered aid upon her when she was injured fighting the detachment.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|43|2}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|47-51|3}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005||3}} He perished on [[Mirtul 20]].

The wizard's demise was confirmed later by [[Delg]] and Elminster.
