Brace Ulmemur () was a member of the Waterdeep City Watch in the 14 century DR.
Brace was very loyal to friends but was liable to hunt a betrayer to the end of the world. He was a little paranoid and distrustful of people he didnt know.
Brace was an adventurer devoted to Tymora but every adventuring party he joined was decimated by monsters. In time, most adventurers said that Brace was "kissed by Beshaba" and nobody wanted him in their party any more. So Brace joined the City Watch to have a regular income and home.
