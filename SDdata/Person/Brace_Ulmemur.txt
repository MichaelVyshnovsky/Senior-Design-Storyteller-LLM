'''Brace Ulmemur''' ({{Pronounce|BRAY|sss|_|ull|MEM|urr|refs=}}) was a member of the [[Waterdeep]] [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Brace was very loyal to friends but was liable to hunt a betrayer to the end of the world. He was a little paranoid and distrustful of people he didn't know.

==History==
Brace was an adventurer devoted to [[Tymora]] but every adventuring party he joined was decimated by monsters. In time, most adventurers said that Brace was "kissed by [[Beshaba]]" and nobody wanted him in their party any more. So Brace joined the City Watch to have a regular income and home.
