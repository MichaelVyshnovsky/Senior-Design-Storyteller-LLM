Gulmarin Reldacap was a brilliant inventor and cleric of Gond in Essembra in 1370 DR.
Gulmarin was very arrogant and stuffy old man, and he believed himself to be above ever being ousted from his position. He was also a pacifist and disliked change, especially from young people, an attitude that was rather strange for a Gondsman to have. He cared nothing about the complains he received, instead being totally focused on his projects.
He generally refused to aid anyone, save for the most dedicated of Gondar. He judged such people to be those who made large monetary contributions, were conservative, and that were respectful.
Gulmarin managed the House of Gond in Essembra with the aid of three lesser priests. Over the years while working there he made advancements cart suspension, candle molds, and dry ingredient measurement that saw adoption elsewhere.
Gulmarin invented a wide array of items These inventions included, but were not limited to, the following locks that required three keys to open, oil lamps that refueled themselves by taking in lamp oil from a reservoir when needed, box jigs that allowed for the cutting of boards and posts in the same way repeatedly, sliding metal lids for tin buckets to keep out unwanted pests or water, and cage spits that allowed for greater ease in roasting small fowl over a fire.
Due to his production of new inventions, he always managed to elude being removed from office whenever a Gondar envoy came to inspect him.
Two of the temples lesser priests, Oldbrin Stonelun and Targarth Snowul, recognized Gulmarins genius and were content to assist him with his inventions. But another, Caldeen, resented his frictious attitude and neglect for his office Outside of the temple, his attitude garnered numerous complaints from the faithful and rumors increasingly spoke of Gulmarin possibly being removed one day because of these complaints.
