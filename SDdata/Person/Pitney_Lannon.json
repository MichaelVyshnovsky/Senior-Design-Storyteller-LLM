        "mainbody": "'''Pitney Lannon''' was a [[human]] inhabitant of the village of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Watch yourself in here, travelers. Full of traps and nasties. Best of luck to you!''|Pitney Lannon}}",
        "Relationships": "Pitney's wife was [[Ginni Lannon]], a fellow soldier. They had four children â€“ [[Pitney Junior Lannon|Pitney Junior]], [[Kiri Lannon|Kiri]], [[Kyl Lannon|Kyl]], and [[Kaye Lannon]].",
        "History": "Pitney was a soldier, and he loved drinking [[Lazlo Buckman|Lazlo]]'s famous [[Harvest Mead]]. During the fight with [[bladeling]]s and [[duergar]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Pitney was injured defending his family and o. The [[Kalach-Cha]] could've healed him to get him back into the battle. Soon after, the [[Mere of Dead Men]] was briefly consumed by a short but deadly conflict known as the [[Second War of the Shadow]]. Pitney survived the [[King of Shadows]]'s onslaught and returned as a veteran back to the recovering and rebuilding village. Later, when the town's [[mage]], [[Tarmas]], disappeared, he and Ginni Lannon volunteered to follow the wizard's tracks and attempt the rescue. Pitney and Ginni discovered Tarmas captured by [[lizardfolk]] within the [[Dragon Caves]] south of West Harbor. They quickly returned the man back to the village. However, unbeknownst to the Lannons, the Tarmas they retrieved was a magically disguised [[black dragon]]. When the deception was revealed, Pitney joined the soldiers in defending the village against [[Voaraghamanthar]] and [[Waervaerendor]], who wanted to take over the village and its Harvest Mead brewery. It was up to adventurers to aid the soldiers or the dragons."
