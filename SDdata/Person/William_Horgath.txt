Duke William Horgath, most commonly know as William the Lazy, was the eighth duke of Arcata in Damara in 1357 DR and 1359 DR.
In 1357 William the Lazy, in league with the Grandfather of Assassins, gathered an army to conquer the Barony of Bloodstone. However his troops were defeated by the Bloodstone army led by Gareth Dragonsbane. He surrendered to Gareth that imposed to him no penalties.
At 1359 DR William was deeply unpopular in his own lands, so much so that in the mining village of Sudrav, it was not uncommon for effigies of him to be burned.
