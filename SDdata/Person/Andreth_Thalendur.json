        "mainbody": "'''Andreth Thalendur''' was a [[War Wizards|War Wizard]] who served the [[Royal Court of Cormyr]] in [[Suzail]] under the direct command of the Royal Magician [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, Andreth Thalendur was placed in charge of [[enchanted|enchanting]] ''[[speaking-stone]]s'' that were in wide use among Coryrean nobles, court, and the War Wizards. Andreth found himself abusing access to the ''speaking-stones'' of his creation. However, he always claimed to have been trained to hear the words of the nobles but not listen to them. In 1348 DR, following the [[Battle of Hunter's Hollow]], Andreth Thalendur was confronted by the [[Crownsilver]] nobles â€“ [[Maniol Crownsilver]] and his wife [[Jalassa Crownsilver|Jalassa]], who demanded an audience with the King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]. Maniol attempted to manhandle Andreth, but the smug wizard calmly and politely allowed the nobleman to grab his enchanted robes. Diminutive blue-white arcs of electricity zapped the Crownsilver treasonous fingers away. Andreth informed the nobleman that the War Wizards were testing these enchanted robes on behalf of Vangerdahast. Andreth informed the Royal Magician of the angry Crownsilver, who held the audience instead of the King, as Andreth returned to listening in through Crownsilvers' ''speaking-stone''."
