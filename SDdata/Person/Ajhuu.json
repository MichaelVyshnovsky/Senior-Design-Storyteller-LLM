Ajhuu was one of several powerful [[genies]] who broke from Calim's alliance to establish their own realms.<ref name=EotSS-pp11-12/>\n\nBy the time Calim returned to his seat of power in [[Calimport]], the city of '''Ajhuutal''' had already been built. Calim was determined to bring the rogue genies back under his exclusive control and waged war on Ajhuu, starting the [[Steam Clashes]]. Calim won the wars but they took a heavy toll on both sides and the surrounding land.<ref name=EotSS-pp11-12/>",
