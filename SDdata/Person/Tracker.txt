'''"Tracker"''', also known as '''Alisheen Starnshield''', was a [[ranger]] and a [[Harper]] agent active in [[Anauroch]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Tracker lent aid to good-natured folk who traveled or lived in Anauroch, usually protecting them from [[orc]]s and [[lamia]] and the desert's hazards.

==Description==
Though Tracker donned many different mundane and magical disguises, when out of disguise he appeared to be a man of grim expression and wild hair, and clad in often-repaired and decaying armor. Tracker revealed he was female only to close friends.

==Personality==
Thanks to the many disguises, Tracker had a mysterious reputation, but had a wry humor.

==Abilities & Tactics==
Tracker wore [[leather armor]] and wielded a [[longsword]] and [[dagger]] together in combat. He favored the [[spell]]s ''[[animal friendship]]'', ''[[invisibility to animals]]'', ''[[speak with animals]]'', and ''[[hold animal]]'', as well as ''[[entangle]]'', ''[[goodberry]]'', and ''[[tree]]''.

==Possessions==
He lived out of a cellar in an unnamed, abandoned village somewhere south of [[Ascore]]. His cesspit nearby was signposted "Last Dungeon Before [[Waterdeep]]" as a joke. He had over 4 [[pp]] in wealth on hand.
