'''Beb-Shuur''', along with his esteemed colleague [[Xianga]], was a member of the short-lived [[Order of Theorosophers]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Vugu's theories were viewed by other philosophers with scorn fueled by envy. These so-called "scientists" hide behind tomes of empirical data. They cannot break free from years of theoretical indoctrination. They are to be pitied.''|Beb-Shuur}}

==Description==
Beb-Shuur's clothes and body language betrayed his completely self-absorbed nature. He spent his days engrossed in intellectual narcissism. He was a fawning university reject.

==History==
Beb-Shuur and Xianga both followed the teachings of the doctrine of Theorosophy formulated by Master [[Vugu]] of [[Cormyr]]. Unlike Philosophy, Theorosophy was not based on logic and empiricism, instead relied on deductive reasoning and intuition. In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, both Master Theorosophers, Beb-Shuur, and Xianga, pondered the world and their role in the Order of Theorosophers atop the [[Blade Cliffs]], to the southwest of the town of [[Daggerford]]. Beb-Shuur exercised his impressive Theorosopher skills observing the siege camp filled with the knight of Sir [[Griswald]]. He deduced that it was a traveling circus because the camp had brightly-colored tents, good-looking men, and women performing drills. That was Beb-Shuur's initial assumption, and the doctrine of Theorosophy dictated he reinforced the assumption via deductive reasoning, believing that intuition was the key to understanding the true nature of the multiverse.

Beb-Shuur and Xianga argued over who would become the Master Theorosopher of the Order of Theorosophers following master Vugu's demise. His death came when he lept off a cliff believing that his physical body served as an anchor that kept the human spirit from flying. Vugu thought that the experiment served to prove that intuition was superior to empiricism, and as the next Master Theorosopher, both Beb-Shuur and Xianga wanted to follow their master's suit.

In reality, Vugu of Cormyr committed suicide, being swallowed by despair, seeing what idiocy his doctrine of Theorosophy was reduced to. His true thoughts and feelings were written in a journal washed ashore not far where his body plummeted atop the jagged rocks. When shown the journal, Beb-Shuur denied its authenticity based on a gut feeling as dictated by Theorosophy. Subsequently, both sages convinced each other that the only way to decide who was worthy of the title and leadership role was to follow Vugu's example. Both dimwitted men died after jumping off a cliff.
