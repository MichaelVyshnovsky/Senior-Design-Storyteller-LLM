Around 1367 DR it joined together with the nearby [[Shrine of Silvanus (Waterdeep)|Shrine of Silvanus]] to form a temple complex known as the [[Shrines of Nature]], which he operated jointly with the other shrine's high priest, [[Anarakin Iriboar]].<ref><ref group=\"note\" name=\"Temple\">The '''Shrines of Nature''' first appear in the ''[[City of Splendors (boxed set)]]'', which is set during [[1367 DR]]. Preceding sourcebooks ''[[City System]]'' ([[1357 DR]]), ''[[Waterdeep and the North]]'', (also 1357 DR), ''[[The Savage Frontier]]'' ([[1358 DR]]), and ''[[Volo's Guide to Waterdeep]]'' ([[1363 DR|1363]] - [[1367 DR]]) all feature the shrines within it as separate and unrelated structures."
