'''Nithimra Hawkyns''' a member of the [[Hawkyns]] merchant family and a daughter of [[Torgrym Hawkyns]] who resided in [[Athkatla]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Like her sisters [[Amaerathae Hawkyns|Amaerathae]] and [[Galonquil Hawkyns|Galonquil]], Nithimra was a tall and attractive woman.

==Personality==
Nithimra Hawkyns was a pleasant and warm individual who cared little about Amnian formalities and etiquette.

Raised in wealth, among art, revelry, and festivities, Nithimra, like all members of her family, was a talented singer and dancer. She possessed high tolerance for alcohol and could remain clear-minded throughout all the many nights of Hawkyns family revelries in the clan's sprawling [[Hallowturrets House]] mansion.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Nithimra and her two sisters were the only surviving children of plump and pleasant Torgrym Hawkyns. Her brothers had perished years prior as well as Torgrym's wife.
