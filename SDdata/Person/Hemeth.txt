'''Hemeth''' was a [[duergar]] arms dealer from [[Gracklstugh]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], the [[dwarf]] heard that the village of [[Sloobludop]] had started a civil war, so he went there in order to sell his weapons to both factions. However, Hemeth was captured by cultists, led by [[Bloppblippodd]], who wanted to sacrifice him to a new god named [[Leemooggoogoon]], the Deep Father (who was, in truth, the [[demon lord]] [[Demogorgon]]).
