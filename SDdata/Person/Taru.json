        "mainbody": "'''Taru''' was a [[spinning spider katanga]] [[cleric]] who served the [[Mother of a Thousand Young]] within the [[Fire Mountain]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "Like other inhabitants of the Malatran Plateau, Taru worshiped spirits of the land, and like other spider katanga, he worshiped the extraplanar evil of the [[Tamara (Malatra)|Tamara]]. Taru was devoted to death and channeled his devotion into [[Death domain|death]] and [[fire domain]] spells. This faith made him fearless and spirits granted him such magics as ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[death knell]]'', ''[[searing light]],'' and others.\n\nAs a spider katanga, Taru could scale any wall with ease and create ensnaring ''[[web]]s''. His bite was venomous.",
        "Possessions": "The spinning spider katanga cleric decorated himself with skulls of twenty-seven different creatures. He was armed with an [[obsidian]] [[dagger]], and a vast collection of ''[[spell fetish]]es''.",
        "History": "In the Year of Tigers Curse, Malatran calendar, late 14{{th}} century DR, the [[Wise Ones]] tribe became aware of an old foe resurfacing. The leader of evil [[spider katanga]], the Mother of a Thousand Young, was ready to birth an army of thousand ravenous younglings. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly [[poison]]s into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Taru was stationed within the katanga's web room, alongside a katanga archer named [[Ramu]]. The room was draped in thick spiderwebs with desiccated bodies of small animals tangled up in them as well as immature spider katanga and ordinary spider young.\n\nIt was unknown if Taru survived the confrontation with a group of heroes of the Living Jungle when they infiltrated the katanga caves. However, it was likely Taru fought to the death as he feared nothing and venerated death."
