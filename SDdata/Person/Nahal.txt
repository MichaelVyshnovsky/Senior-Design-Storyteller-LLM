'''Nahal''' was a [[wild mage]] and [[spell]] inventor.

==Description==
Nahal the Incorrigible was the student of [[Hornung]], the "king of the wild mages". However, her teacher accidentally ended up on [[Oerth]], and Nahal set out on a search for him, even though she didn't know his location. and ''[[Nahal's nonsensical nullifier]]''.

==Personality==
Always curious, Nahal experimented with how [[wild magic]] affected the Realms. The curious Nahal wanted to use her untamed powers for a good cause, and so used her knowledge of wild magic to help others control it.

==Possessions==
The skilled wild mage owned a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]'', a ''[[wand of wonder]]'', and a ''[[warp marble]]''.

==Rumors & Legends==
Chants around [[Sigil]] claimed that Nahal (along with her teacher, Hornung) taught [[Quake]], a [[chaotic]] wild mage of the [[Xaositect]]s.
