'''Myrintara''' of the Masks was a [[Harper]] [[sorceress]] of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She was tall, with large green eyes and glossy black hair.

==Abilities==
Myrintara had a unique ability to work spells of concealment stronger than most.

==Activities==
She operated a pleasure house in [[Zhentil Keep]]. It was a palatial home.

==Relationships==
She'd been a lover of [[Mirt]] at some point.

==History==
Myrintara had been a lover of Mirt "before he got fat", in her words, strongly implying it had happened over half a century prior.

In late {{yearlink|1373}}, Mirt took [[Shandril Shessair]], [[Belarla]] and [[Oalaerone]] to Myrintara's establishment through the sewers, looking for a way to hide from the Zhentarim, at least temporarily.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|296-300|20}} Though she wasn't all too enthused to see him, she did cast a spell of concealment on Shandril before they parted.
