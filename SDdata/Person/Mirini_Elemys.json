        "mainbody": "Mirini Elemys was an elven former slave of Sschindylryn during the mid-1480s DR who escaped to Cormyr.\nMirini had long brown hair, gray eyes, and pale skin. In her escape, she was dressed in ragged bits of clothing with no shoes.\nMirini was resourceful, driven, and dedicated, and devoted her efforts towards destroying her tormentors.\nMirini was taken from her woodland home in a drow slave raid, and spent years as a prisoner of House Avithoul, a drow House famed for its slavery. She was handled by Solul the Slavebreaker, a particularly vicious drow man, and brutalized into submission with physical and magical tortures. Finally, she was controlled with a drow slave collar, which kept a slaves body obedient to the commands of the nearest slavemaster even as their mind rebelled.\nDuring her time there, Mirini earned the (relative) good graces of the House Matron, Balbaste Avithoul, and was given special treatment—that is, kept close to more easily torment on a whim. This allowed Mirini to closely observe Avithouls compound and their portals which led elsewhere in the Underdark. Around the time of the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, Mirini finally managed to disable her own slave collar through luck and diligence (normally a lethal trick to attempt), and having won control of her own body, she stole a wand of invisibility, leapt through one of the Matrons portals, and fled through the Underdark to freedom.\nMirini eventually made her way to Eveningstar and was interviewed by the Wizard of War Aptem Mews about her escape. The details she provided gave great insights into the inner structure of the drow invasion—particularly the alliance between Houses Avithoul, Szind, and DunRobar, and the finer details of Avithouls own operations. With the support of Cormyrs military, Mirini organized the downfall of House Avithoul by smuggling in agents disguised as slaves. The raid was a great success, and a full-fledged slave revolt broke out, killing many members of House Avithoul and depriving them of their valuable merchandise. This also helped weaken the alliance between the three houses and greatly affected their war against Cormyr."
