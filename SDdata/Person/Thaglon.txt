'''Thaglon''' was a trader in [[Waterdeep]] as of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
He was a trader.

==History==
In late {{yearlink|1357}}, [[Mirt]] related unto [[Asper]] that Thaglon traded [[Amn]]-work of [[steel]] and [[silver]], presumably some sort of jewelry or furniture, for half of what he should've asked because of "starvation down there", presumably implying a famine in Amn. Mirt added he was able to unload two warehouses' worth of rotting nut-marrows.
