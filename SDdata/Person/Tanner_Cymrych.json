        "mainbody": "'''Tanner Cymrych'''  was a High King of the [[Moonshae Isles]] in the first half of the 10{{th}} century [[DR]]. He would become the last monarch to hold the true title of High King until the ascension of High Queen [[Alicia Kendrick]] over four centuries later.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|33}}",
        "Relationships": "He was a member of the [[Cymrych Dynasty]] and the second son of his predecessor, High King [[Byron Cymrych II]]. His son and heir was [[Niall Carrathal|Niall]], who would go on to end the Cymrych Dynasty by renaming it to the [[Carrathal Dynasty]].",
        "History": "Niall assumed the throne of the High King in the {{YearlinkName|902}}, following the death of his father.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|27}}\n\nIn the [[944 DR|forty-second year of his reign]], his grip on the Moonshae Isles shattered when he conceded the northern islands to the \"[[Northmen]]\", who had invaded and settled them over the preceding century.\n\nThat same year, he led his men to combat a [[giant]] incursion in the [[Myrloch Vale]] led by a [[firbolg]] chief. Although his forces prevailed, Tanner himself was slain, and his legendary ''[[Sword of Cymrych Hugh]]''&mdash;a symbol of the office of High King&mdash;was carried off by his enemies as they retreated. As a result, his son was unable to maintain the authority of the High King, and his domain shrank to include only the realm of [[Callidyrr]].\n\nThe ''Sword of Cymrych Hugh'' would remain lost until it was recovered centuries later by [[Tristan Kendrick]]."
