        "mainbody": "Kaross was an ambassador for the Shadovar of Netheril in the Shadowfell city of Evernight during the late 15 century DR.\nShe was a powerful spellcaster in the Netherese tradition.\nShe resided in the Shadovar Embassy of Evernight and had a handful of shadar-kai bodyguards.\nOne of her responsibilities was to safeguard the secrets of the Shard of Night and its use by the Netherese to spy on Neverwinter. She slew many Neverwintans who came close to learning of this.\nKaross was granted citizenship by the Tribunal of Evernight, which allowed her to operate safely within the city despite the many ravenous undead.\nDuring the crisis appearance of the Cloaked Ascendancy in Neverwinter, Kaross was slain in a plot orchestrated by the Red Wizard Myros in which a hero from Neverwinter was sent to kill her and claim her essence. The hero did so, and unwittingly negated the protection that had been granted to them by the Tribunal upon killing the likewise protected Kaross."
