Hitch was an adventurer active in the late 15 century DR.
Quick-witted and roguishly charming, Hitch had ambitions of amassing a fortune of gold. He was not particularly proud of his mildly nefarious past.
He was equally proficient at using his daggers for stabbing and for throwing.
Hitch owned a pair of boots of spider climbing, as well as a ring of true sight, and an immovable rod.
Originally from Durpar, Hitch was practically born into a life of miscreancy. He fell in with the Zhentarim for a while, but eventually broke ties and established himself as an adventurer of some note on the Sword Coast.
