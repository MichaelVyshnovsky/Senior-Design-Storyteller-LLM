        "mainbody": "Sakrysta Golthard was a skilled wizard inhabiting Tulmon along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nSakrysta had dark unkempt hair. She usually wore bizarre garments.\nShe had a fierce temper and was passionate about her interests.\nSakrysta pursued a variety of get-rich-quick schemes, usually hiring adventurers to scour locations for select items. Her efforts had mixed results including some that were beneficial, a few curses, and being enslaved by a lich for a decade. She acquired a strange gelatinous creature that she kept stored in a chest. When she let the creature crawl across her body it augmented her magical powers, but at the cost of draining some of her vitality."
