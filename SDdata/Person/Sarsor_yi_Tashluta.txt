'''Sarsor yi Tashluta''' was an enforcer in the service of the [[Rundeen]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Sarsor was a [[yuan-ti pureblood]] of the [[House Se'Sehen|Se'Sehen]] tribe in [[Tashalar]]. With the support of the [[Rundeen#Organization|Grand Yrshelem]], who knew his true heritage, he infiltrated the Rundeen under the alias of a contortionist from [[Tashluta]]. He used his racial abilities to twist his body in order to grapple the people he was ordered to punish, which gave him the nickname '''the Rope'''.
