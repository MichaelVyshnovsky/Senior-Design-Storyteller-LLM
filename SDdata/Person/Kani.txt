'''Kani''' was a [[Crab hengeyokai|crab]] [[hengeyokai]] [[bushi]] adventurer in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Kani had lived almost all his life on a barren seashore with his friends [[Rabbit (hengeyokai)|Rabbit]] and [[Tanuki]]. They played tricks together, and Kani was content to watch human fishing ships but mind his own business.

In [[1356 DR]], however, out of boredom, curiosity, and dissatisfaction, he decided to go explore the [[human]] world.

==Possessions==
Kani was armed with a [[spear]] and [[buckler]] and carried a wicker backpack with a coarse [[blanket]], [[spices]], and a little money.
