Kani was a crab hengeyokai bushi adventurer in Miyama Province in Kozakura in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Kani had lived almost all his life on a barren seashore with his friends Rabbit and Tanuki. They played tricks together, and Kani was content to watch human fishing ships but mind his own business.
In 1356 DR, however, out of boredom, curiosity, and dissatisfaction, he decided to go explore the human world.
Kani was armed with a spear and buckler and carried a wicker backpack with a coarse blanket, spices, and a little money.
