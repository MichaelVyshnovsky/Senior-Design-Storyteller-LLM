        "mainbody": "Safana was a noble-born treasure hunter and former pirate who adventured across the Sword Coast during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nSafana was extremely flirtatious and often used her wiles to manipulate the actions of others.\nFitting to her character, Safanas kiss could enrapture the minds of others.\nDespite saying otherwise Safana was quite fond of her paramour Coran. She reacted strongly when she found out he became involved with another woman.\nSafana was born into a noble family of Calimshan and lived in the grand metropolis of Calimport. While she enjoyed a life of leisure and opulence she found the constraints set in place by her father too much to bear.\nAs a young teenager Safana ran away from home and joined up with a group of pirates that manned the ship known as the Exzesus. She joined them during their raids along the Sword Coast for some time until she ran afoul of the ships captain after trying to overly influence his actions.\nAs of the , she was searching the lost treasure of the famous pirate captain Black Alaric near the Seawatcher lighthouse.\nSome time after the end of the iron crisis she became involved with the elven adventurer Coran. The two stayed together in Baldurs Gate for some time until he proved to be less than faithful. In Uktar of that year the couple split up and Safana decided to join the Flaming Fist expedition that formed in response to the Shining Crusade.\nThe pair reunited some time over the next few months and moved to Corans cabin within the Forest of Tethir. While Coran believed they had genuinely resumed their romance, Safana reconciled with him for a more nefarious reason. She sought to draw out the Hero of Baldurs Gate, use Lanfear and her pack of wolfweres to slay him, and collect the sizable bounty that was placed upon his head. As it turned out, Lanfear, who was in love with Coran, double-crossed her and slew her during the encounter."
