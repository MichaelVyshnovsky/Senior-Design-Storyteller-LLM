        "mainbody": "'''Safana''' was a noble-born treasure hunter and former pirate who adventured across the [[Sword Coast]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''\"When I'm good, I'm very, very good. But when I'm bad, I'm better\"''|Safana}}",
        "Personality": "Safana was extremely flirtatious and often used her wiles to manipulate the actions of others.",
        "Abilities": "Fitting to her character, Safana's kiss could ''[[charm person|enrapture the minds]]'' of others.",
        "Relationships": "Despite saying otherwise Safana was quite fond of her paramour [[Coran]]. She reacted strongly when she found out he became involved with another woman.",
        "History": "Safana was born into a noble family of [[Calimshan]] and lived in the grand metropolis of [[Calimport]]. While she enjoyed a life of leisure and opulence she found the constraints set in place by her father too much to bear.\n\nAs a young teenager Safana ran away from home and joined up with a group of pirates that manned the ship known as the ''[[Exzesus]]''. She joined them during their raids along the [[Sword Coast]] for some time until she ran afoul of the ship's captain after trying to overly influence his actions.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, she was searching the lost treasure of the famous pirate captain [[Black Alaric]] near the [[Seawatcher]] lighthouse.\n\nSome time after the end of the [[iron crisis]] she became involved with the [[elven]] adventurer Coran. The two stayed together in [[Baldur's Gate]] for some time until he proved to be less than faithful. In [[Uktar]] of that year the couple split up and Safana decided to join the [[Flaming Fist]] expedition that formed in response to the [[Shining Crusade]].\n\nThe pair reunited some time over the next few months and moved to Coran's cabin within the [[Forest of Tethir]]. While Coran believed they had genuinely resumed their romance, Safana reconciled with him for a more nefarious reason. She sought to draw out the [[Hero of Baldur's Gate]], use [[Lanfear]] and her pack of [[wolfwere]]s to slay him, and collect the sizable bounty that was placed upon his head. As it turned out, Lanfear, who was in love with Coran, double-crossed her and slew her during the encounter."
