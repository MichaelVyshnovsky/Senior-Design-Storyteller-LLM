'''Gurnik Tapfinger''' was a [[deep gnome]] priest of [[Callarduran Smoothhands]] and a member of the [[Stoneheart Enclave]] in [[Blingdenstone]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Gurnik was at the [[Speaking Stone]] sanctuary. Here, he hired a party of adventurers (who were escaping from [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]]) to enter the closed [[Rockblight]] section of the city and reconsecrate the [[Steadfast Stone]] temple.
