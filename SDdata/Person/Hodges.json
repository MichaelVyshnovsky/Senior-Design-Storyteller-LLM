        "mainbody": "Brother Hodges was an Ilmatari priest that lived in Baldurs Gate.\nThe priest strongly felt for the loss of his wife, but dealt with it the best he could. Hodges was treasured by the community and was known to help out anyone in need. He would even go as far as petitioning the Flaming Fist, Parliament of Peers, and even the dukes of the Gate, to have mercy on those of the Outer City.\nThis Ilmatari priest was known to talk with others around the Gate, especially poor citizens, whom very much enjoyed the chats. These poor residents visited the priest at his shrine, even when the priest had nothing to give them.\nHodges attempted to bring dignity to the practice of bringing corpses down to a tomb underneath the shrine he kept watch over.\nBrother Hodges had two children (Hansen and Sissa), who served as his acolytes. He had a wife, however, she had passed away prior to 1472 DR.\nIn 1482 DR, Hodges maintained the Shrine of the Suffering, a major shrine to Ilmater. A decade later, a carrion crawler began to feast on bodies beneath the shrine Hodges maintained. The halfling cleric was unable to pluck up the courage to take on the creature."
