Aideen Ni Chuirc, sister to Maggie Ni Chuirc, was the leader of the Dead Eyes, a criminal group from the Lower City that named itself for the grim trophies they collected from the enemies in the late 15 century DR.
Aideen was a human woman with a light skin tone and mousy-gray hair in a bun. As a mage, Aideen wore a simple robe of gray and carried an enchanted +2 staff.
Some of the spells Aideen could weave included blur, fireball, firebolt, and lightning bolt.
In the , Aideen Ni Chuirc and the Dead Eyes set out to perform a job that would end up setting them against the Guild and its leader, Ninefingers. Aideen worked with a local criminal not affiliated with the Guild, Brinks to pull the heist off. But the Guild did not take competition lightly and sent thugs to take care of Aideen. Her band survived and relocated to a new lair, of which Brinks was informed via a letter scribbled on a beer advertisement pamphlet. Unbeknownst to Aideen, one of her men was a traitor. The bard Hiero Lue uncovered the secret stash where Aideen hid the loot, including the Guilds coin, and sent a note to Ninefingers, informing the Guild of the Dead Eyes lair and the hidden stashs location. The hiding spot was unknown to even Aideens own sister, Maggie Ni Chuirc. It was unknown if Aideen and the Dead Eyes survived an attack from the Guild or other eager adventurers of Baldurs Gate.
