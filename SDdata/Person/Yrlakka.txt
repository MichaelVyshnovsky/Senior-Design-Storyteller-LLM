'''Yrlakka''' was a [[githzerai]] [[zerth]] and member of the [[Sha'sal Khou]], who dwelt in the [[Obstacle Course]] level of [[Undermountain]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
As a member of the Sha'sal Khou, Yrlakka sought the unification of the [[githyanki]] and the githzerai into a single [[Gith (race)|gith race]]. He hoped that his activities in Undermountain could show both the githyanki and his disciples that a cooperation between the two groups was advantageous.

He treated all creatures that were not [[mind flayer]]s or in league with them with cautious respect and instructed his pupils to do the same.

==Possessions==
Yrlakka carried a ''[[wand of magic detection]]'' on his belt and hid a crystal [[vial]] with a ''[[potion of resistance|potion of fire resistance]]'' strapped to his ankle.

==Activities==
Yrlakka led and mentored four other zerths: [[Azal]], [[Ezria]], [[Rishindar]], and [[Vond]]. While in Undermountain, they attacked mind flayers on sight but did not engage directly in the conflict between the githyanki and the mind flayers from [[Seadeeps]]. As observers, they were monitoring the conflict while standing ready to assist in case the githyanki required help.

==Relationships==
His pupils considered him a father figure.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} Yrlakka's most headstrong pupil Ezria was captured by the githyanki in the [[Crystal Labyrinth]] while scouting their forces and looking for weak spots in their defenses. Yrlakka's group was ready to reward and offer assistance to anyone who could help them reunite with Ezria.
