'''Lorcan''' was a [[cambion]] and the sole son of the [[succubus]] (formerly [[erinyes]]) [[Invadiah]].{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|2025}}

==Description==
Lorcan was described as extremely handsome with black eyes and red skin.{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|187}}

==Personality==
To amuse himself, and possibly to gain bargaining power with higher-ranking [[devil]]s, Lorcan collected [[warlock]]s and had a complete set of the [[Toril thirteen]] warlocks.

==Relationships==
As a thoroughly evil cambion, Lorcan didn't really care about anyone although he seemed to have a grudging affection for Farideh, if only because she completed his Toril thirteen collection. He had a rivalry with his cambion sister [[Sairche]]. Lorcan despised and feared his fifty-eight erinyes half-sisters.

==History==
[[File:Brimstone Angels cover.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lorcan, facing off against [[Havilar]] and [[Farideh]].]]
In [[1477 DR]], a young [[tiefling]] named [[Havilar]] from Arush Vayem was experimenting with [[magic]] when she accidentally summoned Lorcan from [[Malbolge]]. Lorcan decided Havilar's twin sister [[Farideh]] would make a better warlock so he tricked her into entering into a warlock pact.{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|344}} The barn in which the summoning took place exploded after Lorcan was dismissed back to [[Nine Hells|Hell]]. When the villagers discovered what had happened, they expelled the twins and their [[dragonborn]] father [[Verthisathurgiesh Mehen|Mehen]] from the village.{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|13-30}}

After their exile from the village, the trio went on the road to work as bounty hunters. Lorcan occasionally dropped in on Farideh to teach her new spells and give her advice, but Mehen was so hostile to the cambion that Lorcan began appearing to Farideh only when she was by herself. In [[1478 DR]], the twins and their father were pursuing a bounty on the [[Sword Coast]] and journeyed to the city of [[Neverwinter]].<ref>{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|?}}

Unknown to Lorcan, his mother was involved in the [[archdevil]] [[Glasya]]'s machinations in Neverwinter to start a conflict between the evil [[deity]] [[Asmodeus]] and the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]. Lorcan preferred to remain out of Glasya and Invadiah's plots but was dragged into the mess when Farideh and Havilar were discovered by a succubus named [[Rohini]], who was working as Invadiah's agent. Lorcan acted to protect Farideh, defeating several of his erinyes sisters and protecting her from [[Ashmadai]] cultists. Lorcan was dragged back to [[Malbolge]] after the final battle between the Sovereignty and Invadiah's forces. He expected to be executed for his interference in Glasya's plot but was instead only imprisoned in [[Osseia]].{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|7401}}
