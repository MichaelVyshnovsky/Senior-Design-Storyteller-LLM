Princess '''Darseera''' was the "Lost Princess" immortalized in the ballad [[Lost Princess Road (ballad)|"Lost Princess Road"]].{{Cite dragon/268/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Princess Road|88}}

==History==
{{Fq|text=The Princess went by night into the garden, a-weeping at the match her father the King had set for her, and was seen to flee up the hill, under the watching moon. Guards were doubled around the garden wall, but she came not over. When the sun rose, she came not out, nor was there to be found, from one blossom-scented end of the fair place to the other, any sign of her. The King had it hacked down and burned in his rage, but he found no Princess ever again.|source=from a manuscript held in [[Candlekeep]], written by the sage Kalvaerus ''circa'' the [[167 DR|Year of the Deep Wellspring, 167 DR]].}}
According to the ballad and to the research recorded by the sage [[Kalvaerus]] of [[Calimshan]], Darseera mysteriously disappeared one moonlit night from the well-guarded garden of her father's keep in the [[Purple Hills]] of the young nation of [[Tethyr]] almost three centuries before [[Dalereckoning]] began.{{Cite dragon/268/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Princess Road|89}}<ref group="note">The names of the years set down by [[Augathra the Mad]] include the [[-261 DR|Year of the Lost Princess, &minus;261 DR]], but the source does not explicitly state that this is the year she disappeared. What it does state is a range of years that make it a plausible guess.

In addition to the mystery of the date of her disappearance, it was also unknown who Darseera's father was. [[Elminster]], the Sage of [[Shadowdale]], suggested it was probably King [[Toroth (Tethyr)|Toroth "the Tyrant"]] who had six daughters from four different wives and was known to have conquered several neighboring realms, including one named [[Glaeron]], in the early days of Tethyrian independence.

According to famed explorer [[Volothamp Geddarm]], Princess Darseera did the same thing he did over one and a half millennia later: stumbled into a ''[[portal]]'' that was only active when the moon shone upon it. Indeed, Volo was on a bare hill (the site of a former fortress) in the Purple Hills on a moonlit night when he was accidentally transported to the far-eastern border of [[Amn]]. He went on to investigate and map out the entire network of ''portals'' known as [[Lost Princess Road]] from the ballad of the same name. In his writings on the subject, Volo admitted that the fate of the Princess remained unknown.
