        "mainbody": "Evan Ghastkill the Younger was the scion of the prominent Ghastkill family of Nashkel around 1370 DR.\nEvan the Younger was (in the opinion of his family) a headstrong, dull, impatient, and overly arrogant fellow.\nEvan was the child and heir of Lord Evan Ghastkill and Cara.\nHis father Lord Evan had been very ill for a long time and was not expected to live through 1370 DR. While Evan the Younger was anxious to take up his fathers role, both his mother Cara and his uncle Berrun believed that Evans poor personal traits made him incapable of effectively managing the familys considerable finances."
