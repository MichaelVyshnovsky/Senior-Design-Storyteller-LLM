'''Banak Brawnanvil''' was a [[dwarf]] and late king of [[Mithral Hall]] in the late 14{{th}} and early 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==History==
He commanded the army of Mithrall Hall in the {{YearlinkName|1370}} after King [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] was struck by magic and put into a coma. He defended against the [[orc]]s led by [[Urlgen Threefist]]. During the battle with an army of orcs commanded by [[Obould Many-Arrows|King Obould Many-Arrows]], Banak was struck in the back by an orc's spear as he leaped into a hole. [[Thibbledorf Pwent]] was forced to break the spear to free him<ref> and severed his spine, leaving him without the use of his legs. The dwarf priests were unable to heal the damage with their spells.<ref>

After that, Banak he used a [[wheelchair]] that was made for him by the Mithral Hall dwarves.

In the {{YearlinkName|1409}}, Banak was made the eleventh king of Mithral Hall, after Bruenor abdicated by faking his death. Within a few decades, he passed away and his son [[Connerad Brawnanvil|Connerad]] took his place as king.

==Relatives==
Banak was King Bruenor Battlehammer's cousin, making him Bruenor's closest living relative and the first candidate for the throne of Mithrall Hall, if the king died.<ref>{{ Cite book/The Lone Drow/MMP|93|7}}
