Banak Brawnanvil was a dwarf and late king of Mithral Hall in the late 14 and early 15 centuries DR.
He commanded the army of Mithrall Hall in the  after King Bruenor Battlehammer was struck by magic and put into a coma. He defended against the orcs led by Urlgen Threefist. During the battle with an army of orcs commanded by King Obould Many-Arrows, Banak was struck in the back by an orcs spear as he leaped into a hole. Thibbledorf Pwent was forced to break the spear to free him and severed his spine, leaving him without the use of his legs. The dwarf priests were unable to heal the damage with their spells.
After that, Banak he used a wheelchair that was made for him by the Mithral Hall dwarves.
In the , Banak was made the eleventh king of Mithral Hall, after Bruenor abdicated by faking his death. Within a few decades, he passed away and his son Connerad took his place as king.
Banak was King Bruenor Battlehammers cousin, making him Bruenors closest living relative and the first candidate for the throne of Mithrall Hall, if the king died.
