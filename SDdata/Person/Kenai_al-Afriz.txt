Kenai al-Afriz was a dao inhabitant of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Kenais real dao name was Shahraman.
Kenai spoke with a sly voice that contained a hint of conspiracy behind it.
Kenai was one of two dao who operated the ferry that ushered people across the mighty Al-Sarif River that bisected Huzuz.
Kenai enjoyed exchanging tales of gossip with travelers on the ferry, especially if the stories marred the reputations of others.
Kenai was forced to serve as a ferryman because of an unknown crime committed on the Elemental Plane of Earth.
