'''Khuralosothantar''', or in short '''Khuralos''', was a [[bronze dragon]] in [[Seros]].
 
==History==
Born in [[612 DR]], Khuralos laired within the slopes of [[Mount Halaath]]. On a few occasions, the [[dukar]]s of [[Myth Nantar]] asked his counsel but most of the time he slept.

He was awakened by the catastrophic end of the [[Twelfth Serôs War]]. He kept an eye on the situation, especially in Myth Nantar, quietly eliminating some [[sahuagin]] groups.

In [[1370 DR]], Khuralos was pondering what was the best way to help, as did the city's paragons that knew of his presence.

==Personality==
Khuralos loved to eat sahuagin for the challenge of eating something that could fight back. He was a curious and amiable dragon but sometimes his curiosity overcame him and Khuralos "borrowed" interesting things.
