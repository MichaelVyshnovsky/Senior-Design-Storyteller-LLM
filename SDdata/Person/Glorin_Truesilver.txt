'''Glorin Truesilver''' was a member of the [[Truesilver]] noble house of [[Cormyr]] in the early-to-mid 5{{th}} century [[DR]] and a founding member of the [[Purple Dragons]].

==History==
In the 420s DR, Glorin was part of the Purple Dragons, then an [[adventuring company]] comprising several Cormyrean nobles, alongside [[Elvarin Crownsilver]], [[Jotor Turcassan]], [[Omalra Dracohorn]], and [[Dintheron Bleth]].

Then, when the kingdom collapsed after the treacherous [[Melineth Turcassan]] sold the city of [[Suzail]] to the pirate lord [[Magrath the Minotaur]] in the {{YearlinkName|429}}, the Purple Dragons remained loyal to King [[Duar Obarskyr|Duar "Longyears" Obarskyr]]. They formed the core of a rebel army under the king's command and strove for three long years to retake Cormyr from the pirate lord.

Finally, in the {{YearlinkName|432}}, Glorin was along those rebels when they stormed [[Dhedluk (town)|Dheolur]]. There, Duar slew Magrath, allowing them to ultimately retake the kingdom.

==Relatives==
Glorin's cousin was Elvarin Crownsilver.
