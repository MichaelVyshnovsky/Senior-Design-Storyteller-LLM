        "mainbody": "'''Erelal Freth''' was the [[drow]] leader of [[House Freth]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Advised by her brother [[Drivvin Freth]], Erelal directed her plans to conquer all Undermountain, especially against [[House Auvryndar]]. Usually she resided inside [[Spiderwatch Keep]], the main Freth headquarters in the [[Maze Level]] with her brother. She continued to direct her troops even during pregnancy.",
        "History": "Around the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]] Erelal ordered the imprisonment and torture of [[Hatchrin Alet'taz]], the father of her undorn child, following the accusation of a plot to poison the unborn child after childbirth (in truth, this was a false accusation planted by Drivvin).\n\nIn her military campaign, after a series of very devastating battles against the [[minotaurs]], Erelal ordered Drivvin to resolve the matter after [[Lolth]] said to her that the key to her conquest was the [[Troglodyte Warrens]]. Meanwhile, Erelal welcomed [[Tendra Nightblade]] and [[Mateen Shadowdusk]], emissaries from [[Shadowdusk Hold]], who offered an alliance. Erelal was very nervous, having heard about various defeats. Eventually, she would concede anything in order to save herself and the next child."
