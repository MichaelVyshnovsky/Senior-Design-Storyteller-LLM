        "mainbody": "relal Freth was the drow leader of House Freth in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.\nAdvised by her brother Drivvin Freth, Erelal directed her plans to conquer all Undermountain, especially against House Auvryndar. Usually she resided inside Spiderwatch Keep, the main Freth headquarters in the Maze Level with her brother. She continued to direct her troops even during pregnancy.\nAround the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR Erelal ordered the imprisonment and torture of Hatchrin Alettaz, the father of her undorn child, following the accusation of a plot to poison the unborn child after childbirth (in truth, this was a false accusation planted by Drivvin).\nIn her military campaign, after a series of very devastating battles against the minotaurs, Erelal ordered Drivvin to resolve the matter after Lolth said to her that the key to her conquest was the Troglodyte Warrens. Meanwhile, Erelal welcomed Tendra Nightblade and Mateen Shadowdusk, emissaries from Shadowdusk Hold, who offered an alliance. Erelal was very nervous, having heard about various defeats. Eventually, she would concede anything in order to save herself and the next child.\nErelal had eleven sons and daughters, specifically three sons and eight daughters, one not yet born."
