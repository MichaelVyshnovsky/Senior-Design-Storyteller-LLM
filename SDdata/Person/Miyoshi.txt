Miyoshi was a spirit folk kensai in Kuda in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Miyoshi was the current pupil of the great swordsman Junyu.
Miyoshi was a good fighter but had a wild temperament. He never truly mastered the techniques taught by Junyu, but was so talented that the master was very reluctant to send him away. He never spoke about his past.
