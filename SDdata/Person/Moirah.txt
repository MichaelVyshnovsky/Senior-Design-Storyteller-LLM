Moirah was a worker at the Jewel tavern in Ormpetarr.
Moirah was a slight woman with a small build and dark, raven-colored hair. She wore jasmine perfume and gauzy blue and purple silks to wrap her body, layering them enticingly to hide her desirable parts. She left her navel exposed, below which was her nearly translucent spellscar.
Moirahs spellscar gave her control over another persons wild passions.
