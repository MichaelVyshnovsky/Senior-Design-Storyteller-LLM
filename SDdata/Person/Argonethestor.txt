'''Argonethestor''' was a brewer, scholar, a retired adventurer, and a powerful [[mage]] who studied under [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]] of [[Cormyr]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Good, you're here! I can't believe it, a visiting [[archmage]] is casting a [[spell]] for you! Of course, most of the deans are deeply involved in their own research...''|Argonethestor}}

==Description==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, Argonethestor was a tall and thin man in his twilight years.

==Personality==
Argonethestor was a paranoid sort, wary of people, especially those whom his [[dog]] [[Fluff]] didn't like.

==Relationships==
Argonethestor's trusted and beloved companion was his yuppy female dog named Fluff, who was sensitive to evil and malicious magic items.

==History==
Argonethestor of [[Cormyr]] had a long life. He studied magic and [[transmutation]] the Royal Magician of Cormyr himself, Vangerdahast Aeiulvana, and alter, had a fruitful career of an adventurer. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Argonethestor left his adventuring life behind and focused his time on scholarly pursuits, study of magic, and brewing.

On the 17{{th}} of [[Flamerule 17|Flamerule]], the {{YearlinkName|1374}},{{LCRB}} Argonethestor was visiting the [[Wizards' Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] to study the secrets of old [[dwarf|dwarven]] brewing. During that time, the Ravenian temple of [[Mystra]] – the [[Halls of Mystery]], recovered an evil artifact that belonged to [[banelich]]es – the ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]'', penned by the deity [[Bane]] himself. Argonethestor's associate in the Wizards' Guild, [[Sebastian Silverlocke]], Dean of [[Abjuration]] and [[Knight of the Mystic Flame]], approached the man and asked for his magical help on behalf of the temple. Argonethestor was a spell-caster trustworthy enough to keep that request secret and powerful enough to cast a potent version of the ''[[teleportation circle]]'' on the group of goodly heroes of the Living City tasked with transporting the [[book]] to [[Harris Redfire]] in [[Dragon Falls]].

Then, the adventurers met the foreign wizard at or around eight bells. He was amused by the temple's request but agreed to cast the spell nevertheless, despite it being a long casting process. During the preparation, Argonethestor held a lengthy discussion with a dwarvish adventurer about the brewing practices of the stout folk of the [[Vast]]. But when the chanting and preparations were done and [[amber]] dust was spread around the circle, Fluff attempted to jump and attack the adventurers. However, Argonethestor suspended the barking dog in the air with a quick spell.
