Andranth Glarvreth was a very successful merchant in Cormyr during the late 15 century DR.
Glarvreth wanted by all means to become a noble, resenting actual nobles for his failure so far.
Glavreth and Relgadrar Loroun had an icy relationship after the earlier refused to meet with the latter, twice.
Andranth was an importer, supplying other sellers with ironmongery and glasspane products. He also conspired to be ennobled.
His manor had a stone lions head atop the gate, and was several stories tall. The feasting hall was high-beamed, with a wall covered in magnificent reliefs of hunting figures, while the opposite had monumentally high windows.
Andranth Glarvreth was born in Suzail. By , he hadnt yet become a nobleman this rankled him enough that hed so far rebuffed two invites by Relgadrar Loroun to become friends and make common cause against the Crown. He had since hatched a plan, aided by some Sembian-aligned cabal, in which hed assembled first an armory in the middle of Suzail, to better seize power should civil war erupt.
In the day originally scheduled for the Council of the Dragon, Andranth invited Relgadrar Loroun, a noble he regarded before as a rival, to dinner, almost certainly seeking his support. Mind-controlled by the vampire archmage Manshoon, Relgadrars bodyguard, Burrath, then told them that some men had followed Relgadrar along the way, to which Andranth sent out several of his bullyblades into the street to hunt those down.
However, before dinner could start, assassins led by Kormoroth of Westgate burst in through the windows and Andranth Glarvreth fled through a secret tunnel. Burrath, after avenging his Lord, followed Andranth asking who was the killer, Andranth explained Kormoroth had been the one Andranth slew. He then dropped a portcullis on the secret tunnel, and fled alone, leaving Burrath to find a different way out.
