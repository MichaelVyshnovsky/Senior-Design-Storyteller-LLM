        "mainbody": "'''Renault Abrecht''' was a [[priest]] of [[Bane]] and the commander of the [[Thay]]an garrison at [[Veil (town)|Veil]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Possessions": "He wore [[chainmail]] and carried a [[mace]].",
        "Abilities": "He stayed close to his subordinates in combat, fighting with mace and spell while waiting for the perfect moment to call down dark blessings to heal his allies and harm his enemies.",
        "Activities": "Renault operated out of the [[occupied temple|temple in Veil]]. As the Thayan commander, he held court there, and as a [[Banite]] priest, he held services there and endeavored to convert the village's inhabitants (both living and undead). His true objective was to convert these people to be loyal to him personally.",
        "Relationships": "He conspired to stage a coup against the local Thayan leaders of Veil and [[Surcross]],",
        "History": "Renault saw an opportunity to gain more converts when Veil came under attack by the [[Netherese enclave]] [[Kolthunral]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, which had led to dire circumstances in the village. He dreamt of amassing an army of converts whom he would lead down the [[Shadowfell Road]] to find some unsuspecting place in [[Faer√ªn]] to invade. On his way out, he further intended to collapse the [[Shadow Veil]], the massive [[planar]] rift used by his Thayan overlords to access the Shadowfell Road."
