'''Jurrg''' was an [[orc]] adept in [[Thar]] in [[1374 DR]].
 
==History==
Around [[1369 DR]], Jurrg received a dream from [[Gruumsh]] showing that a leader would soon emerge from the [[Underdark]] to lead the orcs of Thar to glory. So Jurrg went with her brother [[R没lgar]] to the [[X没l-Jarak]] citadel to welcome the leader. There, she met three just-arrived [[orog]]s: [[Naazlog]], [[Daazlag]], and their leader [[Thrull]]. She proclaimed them "sons of [[Gruumsh]]" and Thrull the new king of Thar. Together, they started to build the new kingdom.

In 1374 DR, R没lgar found the [[Hammer of Gruumsh]] and Jurrg saw this as a sign that the time of Thrull's rule was near. Meanwhile, thanks to Daazlag, the orcs captured the scions of five powerful noble houses from [[Melvaunt]]. Jurrg planned to ritually sacrifice them in the crowning ceremony for Thrull.

Jurrg was in her cave inside X没l-Jarak, waiting to perform the ceremony to proclaim Thrull king of all Thar.

==Relationship==
Jurrg had always with her her [[rat]] familiar [[Snyrr]].
