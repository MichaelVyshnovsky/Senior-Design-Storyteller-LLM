        "mainbody": "'''Rian Nightshade''' was the [[Zhentarim]] envoy to the [[Council of Waterdeep]] during the [[dragon]] crisis of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Rian acted under two principles: logic and greed. All her actions were in accordance with this.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], under orders from her masters, Rian approached the Council of Lords of Waterdeep and offered help against the rising menace of [[Tiamat]] and the [[Cult of the Dragon]], for which she gained a seat at the Council. She officially acted as one of the advisers of Lord [[Dagult Neverember]] and most of the councilors chose to ignore her real loyalties. Rian approved of all plans to stop the Cult, even the most cruel, and was in favor of an alliance with [[Thay]].\n\nRian was very interested in gaining control of [[Xonthal's Tower]] for the Zhentarim, and away from the adventuring band hired by the Council."
