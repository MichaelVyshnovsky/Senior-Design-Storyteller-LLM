'''Mol the Great''' was the captain of an [[orc]] tribe that splintered into feuding groups, the other group was led by the chieftain [[Zud]]. These groups resided in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Personality==
Mol the Great strived to rule with feat and strength. He often left dead bodies of his opponents as a warning for Zud and the cultists.

==Possessions==
The main Mol's possession of note was the ''[[orcish lead mace]]'', powerful, and extremely heavy bludgeon.

Among other items he owned was an enchanted ''+2'' [[longbow]], a quiver of enchanted ''+2'' [[arrow]]s, two enchanted ''+1'' chain shirts +1, and a ''[[ring of cold]]''.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], chief Zud's tribe was occupying territory in the ruins of Myth Drannor. Due to the internal power struggle the tribe was fighting for power and territory with the group of orcs led by Mol the Great, the tribe's captain. As well as both groups antagonizing the newly arrived [[Cult of the Dragon]].

Later the same year, both forces of the tribe and the cult encountered a a group of adventurers from [[Phlan]] making their way to the center of the ruins, [[Castle Cormanthor]] to stop the cult's nefarious plans of conquering the Moonsea region. The adventurers confronted Zud, along with two of his most loyal advisers, an orc [[shaman]] and an orc [[witch doctor]] in the Main Halls of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]]. Soon after Zud's death, Mol fell to the same group of adventurers..
