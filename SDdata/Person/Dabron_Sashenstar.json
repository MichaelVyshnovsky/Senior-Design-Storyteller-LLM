        "mainbody": "By Tarsakh of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Dabron had returned from his expedition in triumph. The Merchants League published a chapbook detailing Dabrons travels and his achievements. All this attention enhanced the Merchants Leagues profile and importance among the merchant consortiums of the Western Heartlands.\nDabron next planned to build a series of waytowers through Damara to mark his mapped route, and Irlentree of the League intended to mount a trade expedition of his own once spring arrived. This course of action was likely to lead Dabron and the Merchants League into conflict with the newly formed Iron Throne mercantile alliance.\nIn any case, little happened for the next few years, perhaps as a result of the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, and Dabron spent the time in Baldurs Gate as one of the citys most notable citizens. Three years later, in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR, Dabron himself launched the first trade expedition to Sossal. But this was during the invasion of the Tuigan Horde, and a troop of horsemen caught Dabrons caravan and he disappeared. Nothing more came of trade with Sossal and the Merchants League was nearly bankrupted.\nIn fact, Dabron was captured by a Tuigan tribe. While his family thought him dead, he was, in reality, living as a slave in the Endless Wastes. Such was his influence though that he eventually earned his freedom and was adopted as a full member of the tribe.\nSome time on his journeys between the Great Glacier and Sossal, Dabron came across the treasures of the lost dwarf realm of Dareth, acquiring the Icemail of Orloebar and Snowbeards avalanche axe, named for King Orloebar Snowbeard of Dareth.Dabrons relationship to the lost dwarf realm of Dareth is not known, but the statblock in Power of Faerûn gives him two powerful magical items sharing names with King Orloebar Snowbeard, founder of Dareth, strongly implying he explored the ruins of Dareth or came across one of the sites the dwarves fled to at its fall. The date of Dabrons discovery of these items is unknown it has been placed here because it is the latest opportunity for him to find them and because the Mountains of Dareth lie at the edge of the Endless Wastes.\nFinally, Dabron received a divine vision from Shaundakul the Helping Hand, god of explorers, showing that his family was about to fall. So he returned home to Baldurs Gate in the . He arrived less than a day after the death of his uncle, Aldeth Sashenstar, the patriarch of the family, much to the familys relief, and took his place within the tenday. He also succeeded him as senior member of the Merchants League.The Baldurs Gate game has Aldeth go on a hunting trip to the Cloak Wood and run afoul of druids in 1368 DR. If the player intervenes and sides with the druid Seniyad against Aldeth, then Aldeth is slain. In this case, Dabron subsequently appears in Baldurs Gate to confront the player and seek vengeance for the death of Aldeth. However, Power of Faerûn makes it clear he returned in 1372 DR in time for Aldeths death, negating this possible outcome of Baldurs Gate. Nevertheless, the similar circumstance of his return suggests that, if had returned in 1368 DR, he likely had the same vision, just four years earlier.\nDabron found House Sashenstar long in decline, but his return breathed new life into the family. The Merchants League was also failing. Thus, he set about restoring the fortunes of House Sashenstar and the League, which he reorganized as a priakos. But first he had to challenge the Iron Thrones monopoly on the trade in weapons in the Heartlands. For this, he gained the backing of the dukes of Baldurs Gate.\nFinally, following years of provocation by the Iron Throne, the Grand Dukes of Baldurs Gate decided to recruit Dabron Sashenstar to break their monopoly. In a meeting on Ches 4 in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, the Dukes informed Dabron that a Sembian merchant called Rieltar was suspected of being responsible for the Thrones effort to start a war between Baldurs Gate and Amn, and he was spending the winter in his mansion outside Daerlun. Dabron had House agents abduct Reiltar on the 12th and brought him to Baldurs Gate for questioning by clerics of Waukeen who served the House. By the 19th, Reiltar was revealed as an alias of Richtar, \"the Red Man\", a senior leader of the Iron Throne, and the history of the Iron Thrones founding was learned.\nOn Tarsakh 1, Dabron met with Tuth, an adventurer suspected to be an important member of the Knights of the Shield secret society, and tried to enlist their aid. They met again on the 15th the Knights of the Shield agreed to remove Sfena, the tiefling leader of the Iron Throne, from power in exchange for lucrative trade concessions in Balduran, Baldurs Gates colony in Maztica. The next day, the devil-god Gargauth, secret patron of the Knights of the Shield, captured Sfena and imprisoned her in his dungeons. Her loss began to divide the remaining leaders.\nThe Merchants League began sponsoring a sizable caravan to transport steel weapons and armor from Baldurs Gate to Hillsfar, with Dabron Sashenstar at its head. News and rumors about it spread throughout the Caravan Cities by Tarsakh 29, and it was seen as deliberately provoking the Iron Throne. Sure enough, on the 30th, assassins working for the Throne murdered agents of the League in Arabel, Irieabor, and Scornubel, almost simultaneously.\nNevertheless, Dabron Sashenstar led his famed caravan east out of Baldurs Gate on Mirtul 11. However, on Kythorn 7, as the caravan passed through the Sunset Mountains, it was ambushed by Zhentilar forces from Darkhold. Dabron and his team repelled them, but they were forced to retreat to Hluthvar and recover. On the 9th, Zhentarim agents assassinated four Iron Throne leaders, as they also sought to seize control of the arms trade in the Heartlands from the failing Iron Throne. The next day, Zhentil Keep proclaimed that all trade in \"instruments of tyranny\" was solely in the purview of the church of Bane, the Black Lord.\nMeanwhile, Dabrons caravan left Hluthvar again on the 10th, and journeyed to Irieabor. They were again attacked by Zhentilar soldiers as they crossed the Bridge of Fallen Men on the 17th they beat them back but at a high cost. The much-troubled caravan finally reached Arabel on the 23rd. The following day, Iron Throne agents attacked the Merchants League warehouse in Arabel, but were solidly defeated.\nIn Arabel on Kythorn 25, Dabron Sashenstar made public announcements declaring the monopoly of the Iron Throne to be broken and denying the Zhentarims control of the arms trade. But, rather than go on to Hillsfar as planned, Dabron sold his weapons and armour right there in Arabel, taking advantage of conflicts in Cormanthor. There, he received bids from quartermasters serving the armies of Hillsfar, Sembia, Seiverils Crusade, and even Zhentil Keep."
