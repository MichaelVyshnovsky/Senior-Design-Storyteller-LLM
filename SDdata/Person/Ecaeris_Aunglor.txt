Ecaeris Aunglor was the Spell-Captain of the AkhFaer in Cormanthor in 650 DR.
Ecaeris was apprentice to Spell-Major Alea Dahast and the younger sister of Ajaar Aunglor XII, the lord of the Aunglor clan. 
Ecaeris had assimilated all the lessons of Alea, despite not having her experience and secrets, to help oppose the elder Houses. She questioned everything she learned. A perfectionist, Ecaeris hated making even the slightest of mistakes but was very tolerant of other peoples mistakes. She was fascinated by humans and this worried her parents.
Rumors said Ecaeris studied at the Windsong Tower.
