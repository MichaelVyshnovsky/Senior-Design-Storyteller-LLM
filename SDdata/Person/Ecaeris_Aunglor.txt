'''Ecaeris Aunglor''' was the Spell-Captain of the [[Akh'Faer]] in [[Cormanthor]] in [[650 DR]].

==Relationship==
Ecaeris was apprentice to Spell-Major [[Alea Dahast]] and the younger sister of [[Ajaar Aunglor XII]], the lord of the [[Aunglor]] clan. 

==Personality==
Ecaeris had assimilated all the lessons of Alea, despite not having her experience and secrets, to help oppose the elder Houses. She questioned everything she learned. A perfectionist, Ecaeris hated making even the slightest of mistakes but was very tolerant of other people's mistakes. She was fascinated by [[human]]s and this worried her parents.

==Rumors==
Rumors said Ecaeris studied at the [[Windsong Tower]].
