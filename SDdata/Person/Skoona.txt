{{quote|''Welcome, traveller. Remember, this ain't the Blushing Mermaid, it's the Elfsong, so behave yourself.''|Enforcer Skoona}}

==Personality==
Despite her severe appearance, Skoona was a lonely soul. She sometimes lamented her job, saying that people often forgot of the hearts of those with huge muscles like hers.

==Possessions==
Skoona wore a set of [[chain mail]] with a maroon [[tabard]]. She carried her two [[scimitar]] whilst patrolling the Elfsong Tavern.

==History==
Skoona guarded the Elfsong alongside a suit of [[animated armor]] the staff referred to as [[Klank]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The pair never bothered to stop altercations between clientele and only really protected the inn's other staff members.
