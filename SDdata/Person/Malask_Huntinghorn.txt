'''Malask Huntinghorn''' was the heir of the [[Huntinghorn]] family and a royal guard in [[Cormyr]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
He formed part of [[Alusair Obarskyr]]'s retinue in {{yearlink|1373}}.

==Relationships==
He was one of Alusair's bedmates.

==History==
Malask Huntinghorn was in Alusair's retinue when she was dismissed by [[Elminster Aumar]] one night in early spring of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, when he took [[Royal Magician]] [[Caladnei]] to meet with [[Vangerdahast]]; the old [[mage]] refused to take Alusair, thinking this a matter that did not call for her. She began to vent her frustrations on a sapling; he told her not to, foolishly, and she demanded he spar with her, attacking him savagely. She broke his nose; after that, their fighting eventually devolved into rutting.
