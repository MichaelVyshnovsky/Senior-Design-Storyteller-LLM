        "mainbody": "Professor Gast was a demilich hobgoblin who taught at the Dungeon Academy.\nAs a demilich, Gast appeared as nothing more than the skull of a hobgoblin surrounded by magical blue fire. He wore spectacles and had a wheezing voice.\nWhile the Dungeon Academy banned all forms of undead from the premises, an exception was made for Professor Gast.\nGast refused to admit that he had ever died, believing himself to still be a living hobgoblin. He had a fear of mirrors. He was very intelligent, but often talked for long periods in a dull tone. He was also self-important. \nBefore becoming a demilich, Gast had been a wizard. As a demilich, he had the power to hover in the air and invisibly manipulate objects.\nGast taught History of Horrible Humans at the Dungeon Academy. He taught classes by lecturing and used sticks of chalk to mark a chalkboard. Gast would send students to detention for interrupting. He was known to conduct experiments.\nNearly every student at the Dungeon Academy detested Gast, and it was likely that some of the staff did as well.\nAs a living hobgoblin, Gast once traveled from the Dungeon Academy on a journey to Waterdeep. The purpose of this trip was to educate others on how dangerous adventurers could be. He was caught and killed by humans, and returned to the Dungeon Academy as a demilich.\nOne winter, Zellidora Stormclash interrupted one of Gasts History of Horrible Humans classes, during a lecture on her biological mother Allidora Steelstrike and the Steelstrike Family. He sent her to detention.\nSome time later, during the Tourney of Terror, Gast searched dormitories of the Dungeon Academy for the escaped necromancer Carrion. He did not notice the Danger Club and Tavian Truescale who were sneaking around."
