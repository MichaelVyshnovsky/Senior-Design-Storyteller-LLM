        "Description": "As a demilich, Gast appeared as nothing more than the skull of a hobgoblin surrounded by magical blue [[fire]]. He wore [[spectacles]] and had a wheezing voice.\n\nWhile the Dungeon Academy banned all forms of [[undead]] from the premises, an exception was made for Professor Gast.",
        "Personality": "Gast refused to admit that he had ever died, believing himself to still be a living hobgoblin. He had a fear of [[mirror]]s. He was very intelligent, but often talked for long periods in a dull tone. He was also self-important.",
        "Abilities": "Before becoming a demilich, Gast had been a [[wizard]]. As a demilich, he had the power to hover in the air and invisibly manipulate objects.<ref \nname=\"NHApb-p35-40\"/>",
        "Activities": "Gast taught History of Horrible Humans at the Dungeon Academy. He taught classes by lecturing and used sticks of [[chalk]] to mark a [[chalkboard]]. Gast would send students to detention for interrupting. He was known to conduct experiments.",
        "Relationships": "Nearly every student at the Dungeon Academy detested Gast, and it was likely that some of the staff did as well.",
        "History": "As a living hobgoblin, Gast once traveled from the Dungeon Academy on a journey to [[Waterdeep]]. The purpose of this trip was to educate others on how dangerous [[adventurer]]s could be. He was caught and killed by [[humans]], and returned to the Dungeon Academy as a demilich.\n\nOne winter, [[Zellidora Stormclash]] interrupted one of Gast's History of Horrible Humans classes, during a lecture on her biological mother [[Allidora Steelstrike]] and the [[Steelstrike Family]]. He sent her to detention.\n\nSome time later, during the [[Tourney of Terror (tournament)|Tourney of Terror]], Gast searched dormitories of the Dungeon Academy for the escaped [[necromancer]] [[Carrion (necromancer)|Carrion]]. He did not notice the [[Danger Club]] and [[Tavian Truescale]] who were sneaking around."
