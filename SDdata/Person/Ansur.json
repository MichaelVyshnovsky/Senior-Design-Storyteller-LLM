        "History": "[[File:Ansur and Balduran.webp|thumb|right|350px|''A mural depicting the occasion Ansur and Balduran first met, their time together in Baldur's Gate, and Balduran departing for his last voyage.'']]\nAnsur and Balduran once traveled together far north to the [[Great Ice Sea]], north of the [[Endless Wastes]], in search of the [[Great Spire of the Ice Sea|Great Spire]] built by [[Gondar]] [[gnome]]s. On another occasion, they made the perilous trek together across the [[Calim Desert]].\n\nAfter their years adventuring, the pair transformed the small settlement of [[Gray Harbor]] into a bustling city. That city later came to be known as Baldur's Gate.\n\nAt some point during or after the mid–11{{th}} century DR, Balduran embarked on one final adventure, without Ansur, one that would see his ship capsized and fortunes turn for the worse. In search of new and greater wealth, he alone sought the fabled treasure that remained beneath [[Moonrise Towers]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. It was there that he was captured by a mind flayer colony, infected with an [[illithid]] tadpole, underwent [[ceremorphosis]], and was enslaved by an [[The Absolute|elder brain]].\n\n{{fq\n| text   = You are the greatest thing that ever happened to me, Ansur.

I may no longer feel my feelings, but I know yours and yours are agony.\n| source = ''Excerpt from a letter written by Balduran.''\n| float  = left\n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}\nFortunately for Balduran, Ansur freed him from the clutches of the elder brain's influence and returned him to safety. Ansur called upon every healer he could to cure Balduran from his affliction, but Balduran refused, believing his transformation was a boon rather than a curse.\n\nAs a last resort, having exhausted hope of reversing Balduran's transformation, Ansur approached Balduran in his sleep and attempted to kill him in an act of \"mercy\". But Balduran awoke and stood his ground and killed Ansur first, in a heartbreaking act of self-preservation. Wielding his ''[[Balduran's Giantslayer|giantslayer greatsword]]'', Balduran slew Ansur and left his remains within the Dragon's Sanctum deep inside [[Wyrm's Rock]] isle.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = Be free, Ansur.

        "Rumors & Legends": "{{Quote|He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once... Since then the city has faced countless threats - but the Baldurians overcame them all. There was never any need to call upon the wyrm. But this time, things are different.|Counsellor Florrick.}}\n\nIt was the legend of Ansur―the slumbering, guardian dragon―that Duke Ravengard held faith in. It was said that the wyrm could be called upon in times of great need, when the city faced true peril. Only a truly worthy champion could pass through the Wyrmway and stir Ansur from its state of dormancy. The truth of course, was far more complicated than the legend suggested.\n\nAnsur's life and his adventures with Balduran, along with allusions to his state as an undead guardian, were told in the epic poem ''[[The Legend of Ansur]]''."
