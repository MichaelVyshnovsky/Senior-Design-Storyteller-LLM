'''Draygo Quick''' was a powerful [[Netherese]] [[warlock]].

==History==
Draygo Quick was a noble in the [[Netheril|Nethril Empire]].

Draygo Quick maintained a home in a compound near [[Gloomwrought]] in the [[Shadowfell]] where he imprisoned [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] for quite some time and petrified [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] and [[Artemis Entreri]]. The prisoners were rescued when the compound was assaulted by [[Bregan D'aerthe]] at the request of [[Jarlaxle]].

Like Parise Ulfbinder, Draygo Quick had an intense interest in the [[Chosen]] of the [[gods]]. He suspected that [[Ruqiah]]/[[Catti-brie]] was the Chosen of [[Mielikki]], and for a time he wondered if Drizzt Do'Urden was the Chosen of [[Lolth]], although he later rescinded that idea in favor of [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] being favored of Lolth.

==Relationships==
Draygo Quick was friends with [[Parise Ulfbinder]], another Netherese noble.

In [[1469 DR]], Draygo Quick was continuing to work with Bregan D'aerthe; [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]] agreed to share information he gathered from working with the [[illithids]] in return for forgiveness for his assault on Quick's home.
