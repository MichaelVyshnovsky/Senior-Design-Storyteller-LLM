Draygo Quick was a powerful Netherese warlock.
Draygo Quick was a noble in the Nethril Empire.
Draygo Quick maintained a home in a compound near Gloomwrought in the Shadowfell where he imprisoned Drizzt DoUrden for quite some time and petrified Dahlia Sinfelle and Artemis Entreri. The prisoners were rescued when the compound was assaulted by Bregan Daerthe at the request of Jarlaxle.
Like Parise Ulfbinder, Draygo Quick had an intense interest in the Chosen of the gods. He suspected that Ruqiah/Catti-brie was the Chosen of Mielikki, and for a time he wondered if Drizzt DoUrden was the Chosen of Lolth, although he later rescinded that idea in favor of Dahlia Sinfelle being favored of Lolth.
Draygo Quick was friends with Parise Ulfbinder, another Netherese noble.
In 1469 DR, Draygo Quick was continuing to work with Bregan Daerthe Kimmuriel Oblodra agreed to share information he gathered from working with the illithids in return for forgiveness for his assault on Quicks home.
