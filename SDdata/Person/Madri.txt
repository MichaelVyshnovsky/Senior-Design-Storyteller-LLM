'''Madri''' was a [[human]] woman and an important official in [[Halruaa]].{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|}}

==History==
Prior to the [[Spellplague]], she became lovers with the [[Deva (aasimar)|deva]] [[Demascus]]. Unfortunately for Madri, Demascus was ordered by an unknown [[deity|god]] to assassinate her, which he did by strangulation.

Around the year [[1479 DR]], some power called Madri's spirit back from the dead. The entity known as [[Fossil]] claimed her soul was linked to Demascus' sword [[Exorcessum]] and it was the sword's power that called her spirit.{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|1656}} She made common cause with Fossil to hurry the reincarnation of the [[Rakshasa]] [[Kalkan]], Demascus's arch enemy. She spied on Demascus in [[Airspur]], apparently hoping to watch his demise at the hands of enemies. However, when Demascus was trapped by a cave-in on [[Ithimir Isle]], Madri gave him a teleportation device that extricated him and saved his life.{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|3211}}

==Relationships==
Madri hated her former lover and killer Demascus, even going so far to ally with his enemies. However, her heart later softened and it she seemed to continue to hold some affection for the deva.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|}}
