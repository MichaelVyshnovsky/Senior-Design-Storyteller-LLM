Madri was a human woman and an important official in Halruaa.
Prior to the Spellplague, she became lovers with the deva Demascus. Unfortunately for Madri, Demascus was ordered by an unknown god to assassinate her, which he did by strangulation.
Around the year 1479 DR, some power called Madris spirit back from the dead. The entity known as Fossil claimed her soul was linked to Demascus sword Exorcessum and it was the swords power that called her spirit. She made common cause with Fossil to hurry the reincarnation of the Rakshasa Kalkan, Demascuss arch enemy. She spied on Demascus in Airspur, apparently hoping to watch his demise at the hands of enemies. However, when Demascus was trapped by a cave-in on Ithimir Isle, Madri gave him a teleportation device that extricated him and saved his life.
Madri hated her former lover and killer Demascus, even going so far to ally with his enemies. However, her heart later softened and it she seemed to continue to hold some affection for the deva.
Although she was some sort of ghost, she seemed to be more substantial than most, able to pass as a human most of the time. Her consciousness would come and go and she would often flicker out of existence only to reappear later.
Madri had dark skin and eyes described as stormy as a genasis.
Madri enjoyed smoking tabac.
