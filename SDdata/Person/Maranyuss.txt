'''Maranyuss''' was a [[night hag]] who was personally kicked out of the [[Nine Hells]] by [[Asmodeus]] himself.

She found herself in [[Waterdeep]] and set up a bookshop called [[Curious Pages]] that specialized in esoteric books. At some point, she met the [[Deva (aasimar)|deva]] [[Jinnaoth Ir'Gadohn]] and since they both hated Asmodeus, they entered into an uneasy alliance. Mara helped Jinn stop the ritual of the [[First Flensing]], which would have allowed Asmodeus to enter Waterdeep.

==Appearance==
Mara normally wore an illusion of beauty which made her appear as a dark-haired woman. In her natural form, she was a hideous purple hag.
