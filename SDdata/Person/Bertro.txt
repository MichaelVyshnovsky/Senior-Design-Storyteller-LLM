Bertro was an adventurer with the Brightstar Sash in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He had much swagger.
He was a member of the Brightstar Sash.
Bertro joined the Brightstar Sash before Caladnei did. He was in the party when they recovered one particular treasure, which included 6,000 gp. He died at a later date, during a climb in the Great Rift. Caladnei remembered him fondly enough, comparing the swagger of the new recruits to his own.
