==History==
Pusavril was a weaver and [[net]]maker. Her husband [[Traylir]] died in the last battle of the [[Twelfth Serôs War]] protecting the High Mages. Afterward, she resettled in Myth Nantar and started a net-making business there. She still felt the loss but the atmosphere of the city gave her hope and Pusavril decided to remained there for stability.
