        "mainbody": "The Dark God was a mysterious figure who defiled the Temple of Lathander in Myth Drannor and sought to obtain the Codex of the Planes from Acwellan.\nThe Dark God wore a black tattered robe with a hood. In his human-like guise, his face looked like that of a regular human (or humanoid) with brown eyes, but in his true form it was sunken and skull-like, with green eyes.\nAround 1358 DR, the Heroes of Waterdeep were telling their tale of Darkmoon in a tavern, when the Dark God in human form appeared, beseeching them on behalf of his \"master\" to liberate the city of Myth Drannor from an evil lich called Acwellan. After the heroes accepted the quest, he teleported them to the Burial Glen west of the city. After the heroes defeated Acwellan, the Dark God showed up and stole the Codex of the Planes from him. With the Codex, he opened a portal to a dimension that allowed shadows to spread around the Temple of Lathander and defile it. On the top level of the temple, the heroes confronted the Dark God, who revealed his true form and that he had tricked them into weakening Acwellan so that he could acquire the Codex, which would allow him to plague the world with shadows, destroying everyone and everything in their way. However the heroes were able to kill his minions, before destroying the Dark Gods physical form, which put his plans to ruin."
