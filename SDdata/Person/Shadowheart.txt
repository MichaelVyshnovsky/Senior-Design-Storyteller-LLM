'''Shadowheart''', previously known as '''Jenevelle Hallowleaf''', was a [[half-elf]] [[cleric]] of [[Shar]] who became involved with the machinations of [[the Absolute]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
{{quote|A woman with shadows for eyes—deep as the [[Darklake]].|[[Gale]]}}
[[File:Jenevelle Hallowleaf as a child.png|thumb|right|330px|''Jenevelle Hallowleaf's fateful meeting with Viconia DeVir.'']]
Shadowheart had black hair left to hang down on the sides and tied up in a ponytail at the back with multiple rings. She wore a circlet over her fringe, [[leather]] [[glove]]s, and a [[chain shirt]] that was emblazoned with symbols of her faith.

A mystic wound that looked like a black dot appeared on the back of Shadowheart's right hand. It inflicted agonizing pain upon her from time to time, especially when she interacted with items associated with [[Selûne]] or Shar.

==Personality==
Shadowheart was a devout Sharran with a strong sense of duty, seeking to carry out Shar's will with almost single-minded fervor. Fitting for someone of her faith, Shadowheart held the goddess Selûne and her followers in extremely low regard, often referred Selûne as Moon Witch.

Due to the special mission she was given, Shadowheart tended to be hostile and wary against any githyanki she encountered.

Shadowheart had a wry sense of humor and freely voiced her opinions of others, however negative. Regarding personal matters, she was known to be secretive and private, not abiding her boundaries being disrespected. Still, she was willing to confide in those she respected when given the space to do so on her own terms.

Due in part to a traumatic childhood memory, Shadowheart had a debilitating fear of [[wolves]].

Her favorite flower was the [[night orchid]].

==Possessions==
Shadowheart carried a [[mace]] and a [[shield]], along with two ''[[potion of healing|potions of healing]]'', and several [[scroll]]s: two of ''[[revivify]]'' and one of ''[[detect thoughts]]''.

==Abilities==
Like many other Sharran devotees, Shadowheart was trained from childhood in various methods of subterfuge, such as stealth, manipulation, donning disguises, and torture. As a [[cleric]] of the [[trickery domain]], she was capable of [[Divine magic|divine spellcasting]].

She apparently could not swim.

==History==
{{Quote|It's called faith. Duty. It doesn't have to add up to me so long as I serve. I'm part of a bigger plan – one that will be revealed in time.|Shadowheart.}}

As a girl, Jenevelle Hallowleaf lived with her parents, [[Arnell Hallowleaf]], an [[elf]] [[werewolf]], and [[Emmeline Hallowleaf|Emmeline]], a [[human]], both devoted followers of [[Selûne]]. As a child of [[Selûnite]]s, Jenevelle underwent a rite of passage involving finding her way home alone from the woods. However, a Sharran group led by Mother Superior [[Viconia DeVir]] interrupted Jenevelle's trial. Shadowheart's father learned of the Sharrans' plan from a spy caught near their village, transformed into his wolf form, and tried to rescue his daughter. He found Jenevelle at the same time as the Sharrans, yet was defeated by them. Jenevelle was captured and raised by Viconia in [[Baldur's Gate]] as a cleric of Shar herself, named Shadowheart. Her parents were also captured as hostages in the same Sharran church. The Sharrans twisted Shadowheart's memories of the event, enhancing her fear of wolves and erasing the truth of her father's attempted rescue.

During her time as a young Sharran initiate, she still had doubts over the faith and teaching of her mentors, according to Mother Superior Viconia. She was instructed by Sharrans to torture her captive parents from time to time, and surrendered her memory to Shar to make sure she wouldn't recall anything. A mark was inflicted on her hand that linked her parent's torment to her. Whenever Shadowheart deviated from her faith, she would suffer agonizing pain. She grew close to a purple-haired [[tiefling]] girl known as [[Nocturne]], who was also a Sharran initiate. The two young girls would spend time together in a hidden cave within the church to escape their stressful training.

''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Shadowheart was among a group of Sharrans sent on a suicide mission to obtain an extremely powerful and [[Astral Prism|mysterious artifact]] from githyanki and tasked with returning it to Baldur's Gate. The group was led by [[Caldan Darkwood]], and consisted of [[Buddug Vriss]], [[Kurk Deepcroft]], [[Dreena Covely]], with Shadowheart serving as its healer. Prior to leaving, she willingly agreed to have her memories erased from her mind. She was promised they would be restored to her upon successful completion of her mission.

Some time later, Shadowheart successfully stole the artifact from githyanki as the sole survivor of her group. However, the half-elf was captured by [[mind flayer]]s and taken aboard a [[nautiloid]] while trying to fleed, where an illithid tadpole was inserted into her via her eye. After the nautiloid was taken down by [[githyanki]] and their [[red dragon]] mounts, Shadowheart found herself in the [[Western Heartlands]], awakened with new powers. She immediately tried to find a healer. However, the dark cleric began to wrestle with a source of uncontrollable magic, as well as her faith to the Mistress of the Night.
