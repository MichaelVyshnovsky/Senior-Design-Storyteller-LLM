        "mainbody": "'''Ossavitor''' was a [[great wyrm]] [[dragon]] of unknown sex and breed who lived during the time of the [[First Flowering]].{{Cite dragon/237/Wyrms of the North: Eldenser}}{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Eldenser, \"The Worm Who Hides in Blades\"}}{{Cite web enhancement/Roll Call of Dragons}}\n\nReputedly, around {{Yearlink|-18000}}, Ossavitor successfully developed a magical means by which a dragon could attain immortality, a goal vitally important to dragonkind. In effect, [[Ossavitor's Way]], as it became known, would allow a dragon to live forever in three separate dragon bodies. By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], many dragons like [[Eldenser]] had pursued it, while other dragons and the [[Cult of the Dragon]] had tried to destroy all evidence of the Way.\n\nAs for its originator, Ossavitor was presumed to have long ago either moved to another [[plane]] or to have died, which may cast some doubt on how effective the Way really was."
