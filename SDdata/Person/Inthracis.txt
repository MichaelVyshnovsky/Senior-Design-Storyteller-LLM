}}'''Inthracis''' was an [[ultroloth]] [[Necromancy|necromancer]] who lived in [[Corpsehaven]] in the [[Blood Rift]].

==Description==
Inthracis was a clone and kept clones of himself in reserve for his death.

==History==
In [[1373 DR]], Inthracis was approached by the [[god]] [[Vhaeraun]], who demanded that Inthracis kill the three priestesses who were candidates to become the ''[[Yor'thae]]'' (Chosen of Lolth): [[Quenthel Baenre]], [[Danifae Yauntyrr]], and [[Halisstra Melarn]]. As a reward, Vhaeraun promised Inthracis a higher position. Inthracis reached the [[Demonweb Pits]] at the [[Pass of the Soulreaver]] and there battled Quenthel, Danifae, Halisstra, [[Jeggred Baenre]], and [[Pharaun Mizzrym]]. They defeated the regiment, however, and Inthracis was killed by Pharaun. His death was not permanent, however, as he had another clone body to revive in.

==Relationships==
Inthracis's main rival was [[Kexxon]] the [[oinoloth]], Archgeneral of the Blood Rift.

One of Inthracis's lieutenants was [[Nisviim]], an [[arcanaloth]] [[enchanter]]. Inthracis had power over him because he knew his true name.

Inthracis had two [[canoloth]] pets named [[Carnage]] and [[Slaughter]]. Both of them are strongly loyal to him.{{Cite web/Character Profile: Inthracis}}
