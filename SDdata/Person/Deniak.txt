Deniak was a splinter Cult of the Dragon leader and spellcaster and the brother of Delina.
|
As a child, he seemed normal and playful, For some reason, as an adult, he didnt like to hear the Elven language.
As a young child, Deniak attended magical studies with his sister, Delina, clearly surpassing her in skill. He even berated her for her lack of ability. This led to the first appearance of her wild magic, This consumed him with ambition, finally leading him to the Cult of the Dragon, though he later broke from the main group.
His reason for leaving the mainstream Cult of the Dragon appeared to be that he didnt believe in serving dragons. Instead, he wanted to be equal to dragonkind. His ambition led him to use a Cult ritual to take the power of magic from his sister, imbuing him with heightened and draconic magic energies. The ritual had a strange effect as it turned Deniak into a red dragon.
Deniak seemed maddened by his transformation, taking a mad ride over the city, finally being taken down by having a grappling hook in his wing and sent down into a building. Stuck under the rubble, his head emerged to attacking the party, after suffering some attacks he bit down hard on Minsc. Minsc threw Boo whom took out an eye, then Shandies last arrow took out the other. But the final blow came from the magics of his sister and a stab of Minscs sword.
