'''Yamato Sheng''' was a monk of the [[Path of Enlightenment]] in [[Kudoku]] and secretly one of the [[Five Deadly Shadows]] in [[1479 DR]].{{Cite dungeon/195/The Five Deadly Shadows|1-19}}

==Activities==
Yamato was a wandering monk of the [[Konjo]] sect of the Path. He was also a powerful martial artist.

==History==
The wealth of Kudoku attracted Yamato and the others of the Five Deadly Shadows. They slowly infiltrated the city, corrupting everything.

When rumors of the corruption reached the ears of the provincial governor in 1479 DR, she sent the magistrate [[Hiro Yun]]. Step by step, Hiro efficiently shut down all the gang's operations and arrested most of its members until only the five leaders remained. At this point, Hiro challenged the assassins but in the end was defeated. After the Hiro's defeat Yamato defeated the master of the monk [[Jushiro]] becoming the new top-ranking monk in the town.

Later an adventuring party confronted and defeated him.

==Personality==
Yamato always accused Jushiro of being weak. If defeated, Yamato would finally understand the evil of his ways.
