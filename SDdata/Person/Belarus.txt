'''Belarus''' was a loyal warrior who worshiped the Lord of Battles, [[Tempus]].

==History==
In ancient times, Belarus was stationed at a fortress where they fought in honor of Tempus. Much time after the devout warrior passed, the [[Abbey of the Sword]] was founded upon this hold after the [[Time of Troubles]].
