        "mainbody": "'''Smothertree''' was a name given to one of the [[holdfast vine]]s, an unusual kind of [[vine blight]] native to [[Forestfall Fen]]. It was the largest and most dangerous of the holdfast vines as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Like its fellow holdfast vines, Smothertree was awoken from its dormancy beneath the swamp by the bloodshed between the [[Queenstooth]] [[kobold]]s and [[Muckgrunter]] [[troll]]s during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It grew strong and powerful on their freshly spilled blood.\n\nIt was eventually slain by a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Waterdeep]], at which point its body was reabsorbed into the swamp."
