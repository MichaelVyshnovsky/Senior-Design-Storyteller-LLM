        "mainbody": "Grash Crackbacker was a slow-witted priest of Bhaal.\nA pale-skinned half-orc, Grash dressed in an intricate red-and-black robe. Atop his head rested a golden crown with two red gemstones, and his wide-nosed face bore an aggressive scowl.\nGrash had an inclination towards cruelty. He was sorely lacking in intelligence, to the extent that it was considered doubtful he would rise further in the clerical hierarchy of Bhaal.\nGrash possessed incredible strength, which he used to his advantage when employing the \"bear hug\", his favorite attack.\nAmong Grashs possessions were a suit of mundane plate mail, as well as an unholy symbol."
