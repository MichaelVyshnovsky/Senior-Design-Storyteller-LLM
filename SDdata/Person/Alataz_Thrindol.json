        "mainbody": "'''Alataz Thrindol''' was a merchant from the city of [[Telflamm]] who once resided in the small town of [[Ravilar's Cloak]] in [[Turmish]].",
        "Description": "Alataz was a grim-looking man with a shaved head. The merchant was renowned for nerves of steel and sharp blades that discouraged his competitors from crossing the man.",
        "History": "Before settling in the Ravilar's Cloak, Alataz Thrindol had a rich career and many travels under his belt. Alataz spent about a dozen years at the Cloak before embarking on another journey.\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Ravilar's Cloak's inhabitants discovered a bag of [[emerald]]s valued at more than 686,000 [[gold]] [[coin]]s. The discovery was made in a drained cesspit near Alataz Thrindol's house. The locals quickly assumed that the treasure belonged to the wealthy merchant who's been gone from his home in the Clock for seven years at the time of discovery.\n\nAlataz's fate remained unknown as his home was claimed by [[Rastar of the Blades]], a factor from [[Calimshan]]."
