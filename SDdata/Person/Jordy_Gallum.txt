Lord '''Jordy Gallum''' was the Count of [[Greenshores]] in [[Tethyr]] and that kingdom's Sheriffs' Chancellor.

==Personality==
Jordy Gallum had been described as "the epitome of a Greenshores man". He was thoughtful and peaceful but could become aggressive if his people were threatened. He loved the outdoors.

==Relationships==
Jordy was longtime friends with both [[Tardeth Llanistaph]] and [[Marilyn Haresdown]] of the [[Company of Eight]]. He served with the latter while in the army of Tethyr before the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]]

Jordy was married to a woman from Mosstone named [[Shaern Gallum|Shaern]]. His younger brother, [[Emmakk Galum|Emmakk]] took over for him as constable of Mosstone after Jordy's promotion to count.

==Activities==
As Sheriffs' Chancellor of Tethyr, Lord Gallum was responsible for the oversight of all law-enforcement in the kingdom.

==Holdings==
Jordy ruled from [[Kirgard]], which had formerly been used to garrison troops for Mosstone and [[Port Kir]]. Neither Jordy nor his wife were comfortable living in the manor, since they had lived in Mosstone for over 40 years.

==History==
Jordy was born and brought up in the town of Mosstone. After serving in the army of Tethyr before the kingdom's collapse, Jordy served as chief of the constabulary of his home town.

During [[Zaranda Star]]'s rise to become queen of Tethyr, Jordy was one of the ones to support her, despite the misgivings of his townsfolk. After she became queen, she appointed him ruler over the whole county.

In [[Eleint]] of [[1370 DR]], Count Gallum worked with Dukes [[Llachior Blackthorn]] and 
[[Allain Kevanarial]] to organize troops against the forces of the [[ogre mage]] [[Sothillis]].
