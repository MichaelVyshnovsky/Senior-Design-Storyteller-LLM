'''Shurrs''' was the [[viper]] ''[[familiar]]'' of [[Bishimzon]], a [[wizard]] member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
Rexin was a tiny [[magical beast]].

==Abilities==
Rexin could swim and, like other vipers, possessed a venomous bite. Rexin's venom, once in the target's bloodstream, dealt damage to constitution. Like other ''familiars'', Rexin shared an empathic link with her master. Handragath could channel magic and cast spells through his ''familiar''. Rexin could speak to his master and other snakes.

==History==
In 1369 DR, Shurrs resided in [[Darnarest's tower]] alongside Bishimzon and a small [[Cult of the Dragon]] slaver operation. Bishimzon, under [[Handragath]]'s leadership, was capturing local villagers and able-bodied adventurers to send them through a portal in the tower's basement to [[Myth Drannor]], where they were doomed to work for the cult or be murdered and turned into undead servants.
