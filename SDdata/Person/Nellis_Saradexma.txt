'''Nellis Saradexma''' was an [[Imaskari]] [[human]] [[wizard]] who served as the ambassador of [[High Imaskar]].

==Description==
Nellis was tall and thin, and had gray lines, like those of [[genasi]], adorning his skin in intricate patterns.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], Nellis served as the ambassador of High Imaskar in [[Tymanther]]. When ambassador [[Ophinshtalajiir Perra|Perra]] was banished from [[Chessenta]], she discovered that High Imaskar and [[Akan√ªl]] had began diplomatic relationships. Nellis was summoned by [[Vanquisher]] [[Tarhun]] to explain this, but the Imaskari was unable to do so.

When [[Tchazzar]] began to prepare to invade Tymanther, Tarhun sent Nellis, alongside the [[paladin]] [[Daardendrien Medrash|Medrash]], [[Daardendrien Balasar|Balasar]], [[Kanjentellequor Biri|Biri]], [[Khouryn Skulldark]] of the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]], and the [[Platinum Cadre]], back to High Imaskar in order to procure the military aid of the Imaskari to help them halt the invading Chessentan forces. After Empress [[Ususi Manaallin|Ususi]] agreed to help the dragonborn, Nellis was tasked with aiding them during the operation to search for and destroy [[Gestaniius]].
