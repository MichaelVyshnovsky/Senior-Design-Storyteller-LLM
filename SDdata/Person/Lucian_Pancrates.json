        "mainbody": "'''Lucian Pancrates''' was an apprentice scholar who lived in the city of [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "Lucian studied under the master [[spellcaster]] [[Tualo|Tualo the Bright]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Lucian was present at Tualo's house when the learned master performed a [[ritual]] with the use of a tome called ''[[Transmogrifications of the Spellplague]]''. The ritual went awry however, as the book had been altered by the malevolent [[moon elf]] [[Rhazzad]], opening a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Far Realm]]. Lucian survived the encounter, but Master Tualo was not so fortunate."
