        "mainbody": "Alchra Diagott was a lich conjurer who became trapped in the Underdark soul-entrapment device called the Facet sphere.\nThe lich carried many scrolls for powerful spells delayed blast fireball, summon nishruu, and spell turning.\nPrior to 1369 DR, Alchra became trapped in the third-from-right facet of the Facet sphere. Unlike others, he managed to retain his mental stability. Even after been released, he would \"reward\" his liberators by going all out in attempting to kill them."
