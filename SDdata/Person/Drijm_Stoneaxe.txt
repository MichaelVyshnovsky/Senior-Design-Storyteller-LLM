Drijm Stoneaxe was a dwarven advisor to Dagult Neverember in Neverwinter during the late 15 century DR.
Drijm helped to coordinate the efforts of adventurers in accordance with Lord Neverembers goals for Neverwinter, such as by directing them to work with specified adventuring companies at the Trade of Blades.
He worked alongside the likes of Shay Morningstar, Sudbury, and Silwen Wiltfen in his service to Lord Neverember.
He was familiar with the wizard and merchant Heironymous Glim.
When the ruins of Sharandar and Gauntlgrym were rediscovered circa 1479 DR, Drijm helped to coordinate their exploration and reclamation, relying on the efforts of adventuring groups like the Delzoun Explorers and the Luskan Corsairs.
