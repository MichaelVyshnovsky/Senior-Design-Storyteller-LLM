        "mainbody": "Morganth the Mysterious was an adventuring wizard in the mid-late 14 century DR.\nThough he was white-bearded, Morganth had very youthful-looking features.\nMorganth was quite brilliant.\nOf note, he was armed with a quarterstaff and a dagger.\nHe was an adventurer.\nMorganth had studied alongside Sethel, a local scribe, and was in good standing with Netheril, a local wizard.\nThe adventuring party he was a part of in Freedale included him alongside Beldar, Delvar Ironfist, Silverleaf Halfmoon, Slinker, and Lordan.\nMany years before the mid-to-late 1360s DR, Morganth had studied alongside Sethel, a scribe that also settled in Freedale.\nMorganth the Mysterious was part of an adventuring group in Freedale that may have rescued Taran Goldenstar, recovered the Orb of dragonkind, faced Gunter Weiss in Harrow Hill, and perhaps explored Azazabus dungeon under Mount Dread. He had previously purchased spells from the local wizard, Netheril."
