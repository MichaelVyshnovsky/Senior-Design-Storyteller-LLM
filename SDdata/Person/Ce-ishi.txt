'''Ce-ishi''' was an aging [[shukenja]] and healer in the town of [[Aru]] in [[Wa]] in the 1770s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==Activities==
He ran an infirmary in the Castle District, overseeing three medics of lesser skill.

==Abilities==
He commanded some divine magic, with a focus on healing, preparing the [[spell]]s ''[[calm]]'', ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[chant]]'', ''[[slow poison]]'', ''[[withdraw]]'', ''[[cure blindness]]'', and ''[[death's door]]''. The infirmary had a ''[[potion of healing]]'' in store, but Ce-ishi would only use it in an emergency.

He was proficient in religious knowledge and etiquette. He had some basic training in [[jujutsu]], but did not keep weapons or armor.

==History==
Around 1775 ([[1357 DR]]), Ce-ishi may have treated the injuries of a group of adventurers after they ambushed by [[ninja]].
