Karani had blonde hair and light skin.\nAs was appropriate for the priestess of a war god, Karani was fierce in battle.\nKarani owned an obsidian knife, a magical sling, a very powerful ring of protection, and two Quaals feather tokens (bird and tree).\nShe maintained a good friendship with the paladin Taxa, and the two shared many adventures."
