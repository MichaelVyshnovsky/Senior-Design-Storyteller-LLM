Susprina Arkhenneld was a drow apprentice of Elminster and daughter of the drow lich Calimar Arkhenneld.
Susprina was a beautiful drow lady with white hair and ruby red eyes. She had delicate features.
The apprentice was not a typical female drow, and was very apprehensive and modest around others.
She studied under Elminster Aumar, but also relaxed alongside him. Susprina was known to bathe in a pool whilst drinking spiced drow wine alongside her mentor.
Susprina was said to be working on a sequel to the tome of drow lore, The High History of the Drow.
