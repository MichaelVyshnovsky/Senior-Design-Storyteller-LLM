        "mainbody": "Lyressa was an amnesiac undead rogue who stood against the sinister Order of the Crippled Fang alongside the Harper agent Sharalyn Lockleaf in the late 14 century DR.\nFor a walking corpse, Lyressa appeared to be astonishingly well-preserved. Most casual observers were likely to miss that her skin was deathly pallid, and no breath passed her lips. Lyressa wore highly perfumed clothes and armor, hooded and blue, yet a hint of decay could still be detected in the air around her.\nDespite lacking the malice of undead creatures, Lyressa inspired fear and terror everywhere she went. Because of that, she began wearing deeply hooded clothes, soaked in perfumes and spices to mask her true nature. She often recoiled from people that approached her, pretending to want privacy and stopping them from peeking under the cloaks hood. When she opened up to the allies, her attitude changed to that of friendly self-deprecating sarcasm.\nLyressa wore a magical tunic and was armed with an enchanted +2 short sword, a +2 light crossbow, and carried a small wooden +2 shield. A ring of protection could be seen glistening oh her finger.\nLike other undead, Lyressa needed no food or water. She did not need to rest and was immune to all poisons and diseases. The undead rogue was unable to consume healing potions, just like healing magic, it caused her bodily harm. Strangely enough, her unique undead body regenerated knowledge with time. Lyressa called it \"remembering itself\". Wounds closed up, and torn limbs regrew with enough time.\nLyressa awoke in her undead state in the  shackled to a slab of stone. She had no memories of the past, with only her name and a face of a young boy imprinted in her mind. Lost and confused, she managed to escape. Lyressa wandered North Faerûn and learned to love its beautiful Savage Frontier and cold winters. Eventually, Lyressa was able to gather nuggets of information about her condition in Suzail. She learned that the man responsible for it was Dragoth the Bone Mage but finding him was almost impossible as he masterfully eluded the law of Cormyr. Lyressa was torn between wanting to find the necromancer and forcing him to tell her everything about the other life. At the same time, the undead woman was terrified of actually learning of her past. Lyressa felt she mightve not been a good person before death. Eventually, she started feeling creeping loneliness and headed to the closest settlement.\nIn the winter of the , strife and discord shook the trade routes of the Moonsea. A sinister new organization rose to terrorize the southern Moonsea region the Order of the Crippled Fang. It was known for flooding the roads with fiends from lower planes. Lyressa wandered Faerûn with little memory of her past until she found herself in the Boring Pig Tavern of Voonlar at the same time as an army of fiends poured into the city, unleashed by the Order of the Crippled Fang. During the siege, Lyressa defended the patrons of the Pig by jumping on the back of a ravenous green slaad who broke through the taverns barred doors. She gave the hellish toad a kiss of steel to everyones drunken delight.\nWhen the Hero of Daggerford approached Lyressa, following talks of a capable adventurer who stood against fiends, the undead was surprised he did not recoil in disgust or tried to slay her where she stood. Despite the detachment of her state, Lyressa wanted to help the locals, seeing how Voonlar was sure to fall on hard times and famine with continued attacks. Together, they gathered a small group of other heroes of the siege and embarked on a quest to stop the Order of the Crippled Fang."
