        "mainbody": "'''Lyressa''' was an amnesiac [[undead]] [[rogue]] who stood against the sinister [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] alongside the [[Harper agent]] [[Sharalyn Lockleaf]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''You're the first person I've spoken to that hasn't screamed and reached for the [[pitchfork]] when they learned my true nature. I might be dead, but I can pick a lock or sneak around as well as anyone. It's a pleasure to travel with you.''|Lyressa to the [[Hero of Daggerford]]}}",
        "Description": "For a walking corpse, Lyressa appeared to be astonishingly well-preserved. Most casual observers were likely to miss that her skin was deathly pallid, and no breath passed her lips. Lyressa wore highly [[perfume]]d clothes and armor, hooded and blue, yet a hint of decay could still be detected in the air around her.",
        "Personality": "Despite lacking the malice of undead creatures, Lyressa inspired fear and terror everywhere she went. Because of that, she began wearing deeply hooded clothes, soaked in perfumes and [[spice]]s to mask her true nature. She often recoiled from people that approached her, pretending to want privacy and stopping them from peeking under the cloak's hood. When she opened up to the allies, her attitude changed to that of friendly self-deprecating sarcasm.",
        "Possessions": "Lyressa wore a magical ''[[Lyressa's tunic|tunic]]'' and was armed with an [[enchanted]] ''+2'' [[short sword]], a ''+2'' [[light crossbow]], and carried a small wooden ''+2'' [[shield]]. A ''[[ring of protection]]'' could be seen glistening oh her finger.",
        "Abilities": "Like other undead, Lyressa needed no food or water. She did not need to rest and was immune to all [[poison]]s and [[disease]]s. The undead rogue was unable to consume ''[[healing potion]]''s, just like healing magic, it caused her bodily harm. Strangely enough, her unique undead body regenerated knowledge with time. Lyressa called it \"remembering itself\". Wounds closed up, and torn limbs regrew with enough time.",
        "History": "Lyressa awoke in her undead state in the {{YearlinkName|1370}} shackled to a slab of stone. She had no memories of the past, with only her name and a face of a young boy imprinted in her mind. Lost and confused, she managed to escape. Lyressa wandered [[North Faerûn]] and learned to love its beautiful [[Savage Frontier]] and cold winters. Eventually, Lyressa was able to gather nuggets of information about her condition in [[Suzail]]. She learned that the man responsible for it was [[Dragoth the Bone Mage]] but finding him was almost impossible as he masterfully eluded the law of [[Cormyr]]. Lyressa was torn between wanting to find the necromancer and forcing him to tell her everything about the other life. At the same time, the undead woman was terrified of actually learning of her past. Lyressa felt she might've not been a good person before death. Eventually, she started feeling creeping loneliness and headed to the closest settlement.\n\nIn the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, strife and discord shook the trade routes of the [[Moonsea]]. A sinister new organization rose to terrorize the southern Moonsea region: the Order of the Crippled Fang. It was known for flooding the roads with [[fiend]]s from [[lower planes]]. Lyressa wandered [[Faerûn]] with little memory of her past until she found herself in the [[Boring Pig Tavern]] of [[Voonlar]] at the same time as an army of [[fiend]]s poured into the city, unleashed by the Order of the Crippled Fang. During the siege, Lyressa defended the patrons of the Pig by jumping on the back of a ravenous [[green slaad]] who broke through the tavern's barred doors. She gave the hellish toad a kiss of steel to everyone's drunken delight.\n\nWhen the [[Hero of Daggerford]] approached Lyressa, following talks of a capable adventurer who stood against fiends, the undead was surprised he did not recoil in disgust or tried to slay her where she stood. Despite the detachment of her state, Lyressa wanted to help the locals, seeing how Voonlar was sure to fall on hard times and famine with continued attacks. Together, they gathered a small group of other heroes of the siege and embarked on a quest to stop the Order of the Crippled Fang."
