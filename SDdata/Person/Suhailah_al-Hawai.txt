Suhailah al-Hawai was a minor member of the Corsair Council of Hawa.
Suhailah was sturdy like most dwarves and possessed blue eyes and brown hair. 
Her acidic tongue earned her fame, or infamy, throughout Hawa. She was happiest while on her ships and enjoyed working on them instead of sitting in on boring meetings.
A long career as a smuggler provided Suhailah with plenty of skills common to most rogues. She possessed a keen intellect, which translated well regarding ship improvements for speed and design.
A minor member of the council, Suhailah was typically too busy to attend meetings.
