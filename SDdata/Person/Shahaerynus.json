        "mainbody": "Shahaerynus was a drow sage who documented the history of his race.\nShahaerynus dedicated time in an attempt to document the drow of the Underdark. This, however, was a difficult task, as Lolth-worshiping drow tended to \"rewrite history\" by pretending traitors to the Spider Queen never existed.\nLong before the 14 century DR, the sage penned a tome known as The High History of the Drow. Many years later, Elminsters apprentice, Susprina Arkhenneld, began work on a sequel to the sages great work."
