'''Fela Thesk''' was an unfortunate priestess of [[Selûne]] from [[Glister]] who was accused of heresy.

}}

Fela and her sisters [[Mirela Thesk|Mirela]] and [[Iwna Thesk|Iwna]] tended to the shrine at the then-trade moot of Glister until [[1180 DR]], when they were accused of participating in the [[New Moon Heresy]]. The three sisters did not survive the accusations, and it was only in [[1194 DR]] that a formal inquest into the matter was performed by the [[House of the Moon (Thentia)|House of the Moon]] in [[Thentia]]. The House of the Moon came to the conclusion that the charges were false and that only Selûne could judge them, formally absolving them of any misdeeds.

The accounts of this tragedy eventually found their way to [[Moonshadow Hall]], and were discovered in [[1373 DR]] by High Moonmistress [[Dhauna Myritar]] as part of her investigations.
