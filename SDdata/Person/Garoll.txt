Garoll was a commoner and a frequent customer at the Copper Coronet in Athkatlas River District in the late 14 century DR.
Garoll was a human male with fair skin and brown hair who was fond green garments.
As of the , Garoll could often be found drinking at the Copper Coronet. He drunkenly tried to befriend strangers asked them to buy him a drink. He was also overly-talkative about Coronets "special" entertainment offered by the proprietor at the time, Lehtinan. When Garoll came into coin we wanted to partake in the taverns backroom gambling on dog fights, illegal and deadly gladiatorial fights, opium trade, and prostitution.
