        "mainbody": "Kolgrim was the leader of the Bruenghor Clan in 1374 DR.\nThe head of the Bruenghor Clan had light brown hair. His facial hair was parted into two braids and a mustache. He wore a brown jerkin, fastened with a thick brown belt with a metal buckle. He carried a shortsword.\nCirca 1374 DR, Kolgrims clan were forced out of their mines by drow, and they ascended to the surface. He led a group of his dwarves to light a signal fire at the top of Burning Eye to alert the dwarves of Easting. That plan didnt come to fruition, as the ice dragon, Ciraxis, attacked them and froze many of them solid. The dwarf with the key to the mines was one of the frozen, and Kolgrim retreated, finding himself stuck in an icy cave.\nSome time later, the adventurers Kromlech, Vahn, and Adrianna, found Kolgrim extremely wounded. Kolgrim asked if they were the reinforcements from Easting, but they wished to tend to his wounds. Kolgrim, however, knew it would be futile, and he instead told them to light the signal fire before the dark elves broke out of the mines. The dwarf leader told them to take the flask and find the other members of his clan carrying the fuel and tinder. After the request, Kolgrim died from his wounds."
