        "mainbody": "'''Kolgrim''' was the leader of the [[Bruenghor Clan]] in [[1374 DR]].",
        "Description": "The head of the Bruenghor Clan had light brown hair. His facial hair was parted into two braids and a mustache. He wore a brown jerkin, fastened with a thick brown belt with a metal buckle. He carried a [[shortsword]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1374 DR]], Kolgrim's clan were forced out of their mines by [[drow]], and they ascended to the surface. He led a group of his [[dwarves]] to light a signal fire at the top of [[Burning Eye]] to alert the dwarves of [[Easting]]. That plan didn't come to fruition, as the [[ice dragon]], [[Ciraxis]], attacked them and froze many of them solid. The dwarf with the key to the mines was one of the frozen, and Kolgrim retreated, finding himself stuck in an icy cave.\n\nSome time later, the adventurers [[Kromlech]], [[Vahn]], and [[Adrianna]], found Kolgrim extremely wounded. Kolgrim asked if they were the reinforcements from Easting, but they wished to tend to his wounds. Kolgrim, however, knew it would be futile, and he instead told them to light the signal fire before the dark elves broke out of the mines. The dwarf leader told them to take the flask and find the other members of his clan carrying the fuel and tinder. After the request, Kolgrim died from his wounds."
