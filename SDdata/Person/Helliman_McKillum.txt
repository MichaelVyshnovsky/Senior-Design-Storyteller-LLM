Helliman McKillum was a human priest of Tempus in the 14 century DR.
Helliman McKillum was a simple warrior worshiper of the Lord of Battles when he used his expertise in sword-fighting to rescue a village. He was inducted into the Church of Tempus after that heroic deed and quickly claimed the rankings within the organization.
Later, he set out on a search for a legendary sacred chalice.
