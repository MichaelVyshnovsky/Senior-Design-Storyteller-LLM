==History==
Helliman McKillum was a simple warrior worshiper of the Lord of Battles when he used his expertise in sword-fighting to rescue a village. He was inducted into the [[Church of Tempus]] after that heroic deed and quickly claimed the rankings within the organization.

Later, he set out on a search for a legendary ''sacred chalice''.
