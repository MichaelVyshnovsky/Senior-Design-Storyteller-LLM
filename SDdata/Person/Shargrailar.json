Shargrailar went on to become the most powerful dracolich in the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and a loyal ally of Sammaster.\n\nShargrailar's demise occurred during the hunt for [[Shandril Shessair]]. After Shandril destroyed two dracoliches and an archmage of the Cult, Shargrailar decided to resolve the matter himself and ambushed the girl and her friends. However, her ''[[spellfire]]'' proved too powerful even for Shargrailar and the dracolich was destroyed for good.",
