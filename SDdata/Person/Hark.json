        "mainbody": "'''Hark''' was the leader of a group of [[goblin]]s sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].",
        "History": "Hark and his fellow goblins lived in the [[Ardeep Forest]]. In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]] the [[elves]] managed to expel them from the forest.\n\nHark relocated the goblins to a cave near the [[Nightstone]] village. Thanks to the [[cloud giant]]s' bombardment, Hark managed to capture the fleeing villagers.",
        "Personality": "Hark was a reasonable person. He always preferred to bargain than fight."
