'''Zalkoré''' ({{Pronounce|zawl|KOR|ay|refs=}}) was a [[medusa]] that dwelled within the [[Chult]]an ruins of [[Nangalore]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Originally she was the beautiful, but exceedingly vain, queen of [[Omu]] who made one infernal dealing that sealed away her tragic fate.

==Activities==
During her life as a medusa, Zalkoré grew a variety of hallucinogenic plants, such as certain lotuses, to form the vision of her lost true love.

==History==
Zalkoré exuded narcissism during her years as regent of Omu. This vanity was indulged by Zalkoré's retinue until it poisoned her mind. She made a deal with an [[erinyes]] to ensure that her youthful beauty would never be taken from her. The [[baatezu]] responding by turning Queen Zalkoré into a medusa, which in turn got her dethroned and exiled to the gardens of [[Nangalore|Ka-Nanji]].

==Relationships==
As queen, Zalkoré had a closely-trusted general [[Thiru-taya]] who also acted as her consort. He passed away some time after the queen's transformation. Although she believed otherwise, he remained faithful and true to her throughout his whole life.
