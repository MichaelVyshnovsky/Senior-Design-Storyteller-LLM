The Bride was an ancient titaness who was the consort of the primordial Cirotralech, and that was sealed alongside him in Fimbrul, Laerakond. 
The Bride had three heads and three sets of arms. The hair in each of her heads was colored with different shades of blue. 
In 1480 DR, the primordial cult known as the Sons of Winter was able to release the Bride from her slumber. While a band of adventurers was able to destroy the cult, the Bride fled the battlefield and began her preparations for the eventual revival of Cirotralech.
