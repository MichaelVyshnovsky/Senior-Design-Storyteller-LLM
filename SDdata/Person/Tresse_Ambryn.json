        "History": "Unlike many of her fellow jewelers, Tresse showed no passion in her craft. Her work was motivated only by profit. Despite lack of passion, Tresse was a very skilled jeweler with her services in high demand. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Tresse was offering her skills and services to the adventurers and defenders of Neverwinter, the Jewel of the North."
