Gethmedra Darmov () was a crime lord in Mulmaster in 1491 DR.
Her arena made Gethmedra popular among the citys elite, but she knew that, for her poor birth, she would never move among them. Gethmedra liked to display her power and cruelty, by showing to her guests the head of her last enemy.
Gethmedra was a crime lord in the city. Using the Black Blade and Bloody Boar tavern as cover, she ran a gladiator arena.
In 1491 DR, an adventuring party approached her in order to question one of her gladiators, Bh√∫n Ludwakazar the Stone Dwarf, about troubles in a nearby mine.
