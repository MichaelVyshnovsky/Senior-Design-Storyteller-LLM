Surely you cannot be my captors, come to torment an old man within his glass prison! You look like none others I have seen here.''|Frennedan}}",
        "History": "Frennedan was captured by [[archmage]] Jon Irenicus some time before [[Abdel Adrian]]'s escape from the dungeon. The doppelganger was locked away in a prison cell with glass walls, unable to get out. Frennedan presented himself as a portly old man to the Bhaalspawn, begging for help and claiming to be frail and dying after countless magical experiments. The doppelganger had no intention to attack his rescuer and intended to simply flee the imprisonment, however, whether he was successful remained unrecorded."
