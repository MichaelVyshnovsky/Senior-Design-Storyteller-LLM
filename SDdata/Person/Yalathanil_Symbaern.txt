Yalathanil Symbaern was a reclusive sun elf wizard.
As of 1368 DR, he was the patriarch of House Symbaern and was at least 1000 years old.
Yalathanil once possessed a magical staff that was rumoured to have been able to send its wielder back in time by a few minutes in order to change the outcome of unfavourable events. It was not known whether he still possessed the staff, nor whether accounts of the staffs powers are accurate.
