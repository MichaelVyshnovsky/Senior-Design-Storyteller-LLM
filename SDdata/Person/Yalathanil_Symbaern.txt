'''Yalathanil Symbaern''' was a reclusive [[sun elf]] wizard.

==Activities==
As of [[1368 DR]], he was the patriarch of House [[Symbaern]] and was at least 1000 years old.

==Possessions==
Yalathanil once possessed a magical staff that was rumoured to have been able to send its wielder back in time by a few minutes in order to change the outcome of unfavourable events. It was not known whether he still possessed the staff, nor whether accounts of the staff's powers are accurate.
