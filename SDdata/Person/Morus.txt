Morus was a king of Impiltur, of the Durlarven Dynasty, during the late 7 century DR. He reigned from the Year of the Covenant, 673 DR to the Year of the Bloodfeud, 675 DR.
King Morus ascended to the Golden Throne when his father, King Bellodar III, passed away from natural causes. Unfortunately, Morus descended into madness over the course of two years and grew paranoid about his newly acquired power. He accused his brother Alathos of attempting to seize the crown for his own.
The two brothers fought each other in a wild sword-fight and Alathos was forced to kill his brother. Following the duel, Alathos I ascended as the new king of Impiltur.
