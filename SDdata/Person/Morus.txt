'''Morus''' was a king of [[Impiltur]], of the [[Durlarven Dynasty]], during the late 7{{th}} century [[DR]]. He reigned from the [[673 DR|Year of the Covenant, 673 DR]] to the [[675 DR|Year of the Bloodfeud, 675 DR]].

==History==
King Morus ascended to the Golden Throne when his father, [[Bellodar III|King Bellodar III]], passed away from natural causes. Unfortunately, Morus descended into madness over the course of two years and grew paranoid about his newly acquired power. He accused his brother [[Alathos I|Alathos]] of attempting to seize the crown for his own.

The two brothers fought each other in a wild sword-fight and Alathos was forced to kill his brother. Following the duel, Alathos I ascended as the new king of Impiltur.
