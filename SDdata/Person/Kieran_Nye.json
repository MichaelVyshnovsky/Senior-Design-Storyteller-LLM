Very well, if you must know...I am an exile from an organization so paranoid and extreme that they would slay me for daring to break from their tentacular grasp. This organization is known as the Host Tower of the Arcane. Based in Luskan, they are a group of malefic wizards bent on gaining personal power at all costs.

        "Description": "Kieran was a light-skinned [[human]] man with graying hair, and he preferred to wear teal mage's [[robes]]. He spoke with a typical southern Tethyrean accent.",
        "History": "Kieran Nye was an old [[Tethyr]]ean [[wizard]] who at one point was a member of the organization that would eventually be known as the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]]. Kieran deserted, and the Host Tower wanted him dead, so he kept his past affiliation a secret.\n\nSometime before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, he purchased the Whistling Gallows inn after [[Skeld]], the original proprietor, died.",
        "Possessions": "The evidence of Kieran's past was hidden within a mage laboratory behind a [[mirror]] in his room on the inn's first floor. That was where he kept his expansive collection of [[enchanted]] curios. Kieran was willing to sell and trade in magical trinkets with those who discovered his Arcane Brotherhood past as a bribe to keep that secret.\n\nKieran's collection of magical devices was quite expansive. It included a number of [[spell]] [[scroll]]s, a ''[[scarlet/blue ioun stone]]'', ''[[Jamison's sling]]'', ''[[Xainlaphar's flying skull]]'', ''[[Zilzanzer's Magnificent Dart]]s'', the ''[[Dagger of Safe Harbor]]'', and ''[[Thrym extract]]'' bottles."
