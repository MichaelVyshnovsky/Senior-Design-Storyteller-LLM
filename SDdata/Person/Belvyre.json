While Belvyre was working on a solution for the dying plant life, he was introduced by his friend Saarvin to two other companions investigating the Everlasting Rime, the [[barbarian]] named [[Runa]] and a mysterious [[warlock]] called [[Amos]]. During their first meeting, Amos suggested they journey to an underground cavern that led to a [[Ythryn|magical city]] that was buried deep beneath the [[Reghed Glacier]].\n\nThe group set out across Icewind Dale for the glacier, and were eventually forced to take refuge in a cave to keep safe from the elements.{{Cite comic/At the Spine of the World 2|10-17}} He took Belvyre to an underground cavern full of sacred winter plants, which were nourished by the magic of a ''[[primordial shard]]''.

As his companions arrive to save him, Belvyre confronted Amos and urged him help save the [[duergar]] that would be inadvertently killed by the imminent disaster. He urged his freinds to spare Amos' life and protected him from their vengeance.{{Cite comic/At the Spine of the World 4|8-14}} As lava burst forth from the depths of the cavern, and the ground shook beneath them, Amos gave the ''frostbrand'' to Belvyre so he could save himself, their companions, and the unwary duergar.

Working together, the companions escaped to safety and stood poised ready to uncover the secrets of the long lost magical city.{{Cite comic/At the Spine of the World 4|15-19}}"
