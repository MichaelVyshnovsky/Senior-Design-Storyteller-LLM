        "mainbody": "Kriknar was a member of the Xanathar Thieves Guild in Waterdeep around 1370 DR.\nKriknar usually traveled around the city heavily cloaked and painted, in order to pass as an ugly half-orc.\nKriknar and the other members of its tribe (who worked on different teams) worked as slavers for the Guild, not for money but for the chance to hunt intelligent beings. Often, they were given useless slaves or purchased their own with the money they were paid and hunted the slaves for fun. Kriknar enjoyed its job and would never quit.\nIt learned to use a sword instead of its claws."
