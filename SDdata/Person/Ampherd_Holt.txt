'''Ampherd Holt''' was a [[Zhentarim]] [[cleric]] of [[Tempus]] at the [[Citadel of the Raven]] in [[1367 DR]]. 

==Personality==
Ampherd had an unbalanced mind, being in permanent state of battle madness. However, his sermons about the glory received from death in battle became very popular among the soldiers, and many considered Ampherd their chaplain. [[Boruse Temlor]] hated him for his popularity, and [[Kandar Milinal]] distrusted him because of his craziness.
