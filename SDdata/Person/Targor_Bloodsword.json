        "mainbody": "argor Bloodsword was the ambitious leader of a goblinoid war band of the Cragmaw tribe.\nTargor led three other hobgoblins and a pair of wolves in his contingent. He was by far the most powerful of the band, being a very robust one of his kind.\nThe strong hobgoblin had long wished to overtake King Grol as the leader of the entire Cragmaw tribe. Given the opportunity, Targor was ready to take it.\nIn 1491 DR, Targor and his contingent set out of Cragmaw Castle. They encountered a hunting party of up to four elves, and were successful in slaying them. The hobgoblins severed the heads of the elves, and shoved them into bags."
