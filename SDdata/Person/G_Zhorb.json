        "History": "G'Zhorb commanded a horde of beholders in Undermountain, but was himself subservient to [[Halaster Blackcloak]], the dungeon's vastly powerful master. Halaster ensured the loyalty of G'Zhorb and his minions by constructing a magical device that contained a tiny space that beholders were unable to see, threatening to unleash the imperceptible space on all of [[Faer√ªn]]. This horrified G'Zhorb, and drove him near insanity, but also ensured he remained a faithful servant of Halaster."
