        "mainbody": "GZhorb, which roughly translated to the All-Seeing Eye in the Beholder language, was a powerful beholder in Undermountain beneath Waterdeep.\nGZhorb commanded a horde of beholders in Undermountain, but was himself subservient to Halaster Blackcloak, the dungeons vastly powerful master. Halaster ensured the loyalty of GZhorb and his minions by constructing a magical device that contained a tiny space that beholders were unable to see, threatening to unleash the imperceptible space on all of Faer√ªn. This horrified GZhorb, and drove him near insanity, but also ensured he remained a faithful servant of Halaster."
