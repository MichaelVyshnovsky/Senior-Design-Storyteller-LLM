        "mainbody": "Kasnchil was the baron of the city of Surbar in Ulgarth around 1367 DR.\nKasnchil was the most corrupt and greedy of Ulgarths barons, and this affected his legal judgments. He permitted all kinds of trade through Surbar, which made it a popular port and a prosperous city, but this knew no limits even Dambrathan pirates could dock there to resupply and refit. However, the serfs thought he made the city prosper."
