        "mainbody": "'''Kasnchil''' was the baron of the city of [[Surbar]] in [[Ulgarth]] around [[1367 DR]].\n\nKasnchil was the most corrupt and greedy of Ulgarth's barons, and this affected his legal judgments. He permitted all kinds of trade through Surbar, which made it a popular port and a prosperous city, but this knew no limits: even [[Dambrath]]an pirates could dock there to resupply and refit. However, the serfs thought he made the city prosper."
