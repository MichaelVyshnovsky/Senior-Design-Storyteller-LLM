'''Diyab''' was a [[divine magic|divine spellcaster]] and devotee of the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Sarevok]] who lived in the Realms during the mid−14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Template:Cite game/Baldur's Gate}}

==Activities==
Diyab worked under [[Zhalimar Cloudwulfe]] alongside his fellow agents [[Aasim]], [[Alai]], [[Gardush]], and [[Naaman]]. Together they sought to advance Sarevok's plans and goals over those of the [[Iron Throne]].

==Possessions==
He wielded a ''+1 [[warhammer]]'' and carried with him a number of [[potion]]s and oils.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, Diyab and his allies were sent by the Iron Throne to the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] to advise [[Thaldorn]] in his negotiations with [[Tar (emissary)|Emissary Tar]], who represented the Baldurian [[Council of Four]]. Right before the meeting, the Diyab and the others were defeated by [[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions.
