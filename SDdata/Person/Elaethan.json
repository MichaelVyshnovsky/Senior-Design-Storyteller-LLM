        "mainbody": "Elaethan was an elf wraith guarding the Sacred Vale in Cormanthyr in the 3 century DR.\nHe was a wispy white shadow, trailing off into smoke below the waist.\nElaethan had grown rather aggressive about protecting the Vale, and showed the beginning of some sadistic tendencies.\nHe could mind-read people. He was also largely unaffected by spells that destroyed undead, or even chain lightning. \nHe was a guardian of the Sacred Vale.\nOne of his fellow guardians was named Norlorn.\nIn , Elaethan arrived at the scene after Elminster Aumar escaped Heldebran. He mind-read Heldebran as the mage threatened them after his fellow Noldorn left Heldebran at the mercy of his own mage-killer, slaying him and then the mage-killer itself, he remarked that the mage shouldve suffered more."
