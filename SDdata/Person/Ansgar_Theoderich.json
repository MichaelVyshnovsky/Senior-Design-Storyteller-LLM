        "Activities": "Haemaster Ansgar was a priest at the [[Lyceum of the Black Lord]] in Phlan, the temple whose clergy venerated Iyachtu Xvim in what was seen as dissident by the greater [[church of Bane]]. Ansgar preached that Bane truly died during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century and that Xvim took on his divine father's form and name in order to garner greater power and more worshipers.",
        "History": "At some point Ansgar was abducted to the [[Lyceum of the Black Hand]] and was tortured by devotees of Bane to divulge these perceived heretical beliefs."
