Sovereign Spaw was the ruler of Ebonlake Grotto, a myconid community in the Underdark situated near the Ebonlake.
Spaw could communicate to non-myconid by use of spore clouds that lingered around Ebonlake Grotto.
It also had the ability to raise the bodies of the dead as spore servants, zombie-like husks that served as mindless followers and protectors.
Spaw kept a treasury in Ebonlake Grotto, which house the powerful drow item, Shadow of Menzoberranzan.
In the , duergars aligned with the cult of the Absolute raided the Ebonlake Grotto and slew many of the myconids young. Spaw raised several of the raiders as spore servants and sought out ways to take out vengeance on the cult and its duergar slavers. Spaw also offered safe haven to the gnome woman Thulla, who was grievously injured by the raiders.
The duergar also attacked the myconid sovereign Glut, and destroyed its entire circle. Spaw received an appeal for aid from Glut, but chose to ignore its requests outright.
