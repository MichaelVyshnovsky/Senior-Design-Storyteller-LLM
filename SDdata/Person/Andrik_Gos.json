        "mainbody": "Andrik Gos () was a mad artist in Mulmaster.\nAndrik was the nephew of Zor Faltyn Gos, one of the Blades of Mulmaster.\nAndrik was always an artist and a painter. Around 1491 DR, when the Blades competed with each other over the arts, Andrik was generously sponsored by his uncle.\nHowever, true success arrived only with his patron Doril Cire, secretly a cultist of the Cult of the Eternal Flame. Thanks to the infusion of elemental fire in his paintings, his works attracted more people. Doril manipulated him into creating a masterpiece that could summon an elemental blast that would destroy the city. Afterwards, his talent vanished completely, leaving Andrik despondent."
