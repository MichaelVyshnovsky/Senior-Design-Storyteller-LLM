Tim Goldenhand was a novice elf adventurer and mage.
Tim was mocked by his fellows by his cowardice and lack of ability.
The elf was a mage, still getting used to casting spells. The only spell he had learned was magic missile.
From his own accounts, his parents were slain when he was a babe, and he was raised by wolves for two decades. Eventually, a beautiful ranger became entranced by his mysterious wildness and took him from the forest. Some time later, he met his fellow adventurers, Bondari and Nanoc in a tavern. The group foolishly decided to enter a cavern to the Underdark, and they encountered the mad wizard Iycanths creations. The creatures quickly petrified the trio, turning them to stone.
