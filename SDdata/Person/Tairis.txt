}}'''Tairis''' was an employee of [[Kalas Winters]], who worked as a barmaid at the [[Wolf's Pelt Inn]] in the [[Icewind Dale]] community of [[Targos]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Description==

==Personality==
Even though Tairis was not particularly attractive or eloquent, she happily flirted with the guests of the inn, looking for a good husband.

==History==
Around [[Tarsakh]] in [[1369 DR]], Tairis worked behind the bar in Wolf's Pelt Inn, but often came out to wait on tables, if [[Parcilla]] needed aid.
