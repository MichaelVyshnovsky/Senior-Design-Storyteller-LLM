Hhoort was a troglodyte in the Wormwrithings in the late 15 century DR.
Hhoort was the mate of Chieftain Sslaar.
Circa 1486 DR, Sslaar had a disagreement with his war chief Hslaat about the ownership of a magic sword. Soon a civil war started between Sslaars and Hslaats loyalists. Hslaat ordered warriors to capture Hhoort, hoping to bargain her for the sword.
