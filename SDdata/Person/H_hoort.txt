'''H'hoort''' was a [[troglodyte]] in the [[Wormwrithings]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
H'hoort was the mate of Chieftain [[S'slaar]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], S'slaar had a disagreement with his war chief [[H'slaat]] about the ownership of a magic [[sword]]. Soon a civil war started between S'slaar's and H'slaat's loyalists. H'slaat ordered warriors to capture H'hoort, hoping to bargain her for the sword.
