'''Hideo''' was the inventor of the [[enchanted]] [[kama]] called ''[[Hideo's kama]]'', found in [[Faer√ªn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Long before the {{YearlinkName|1342}}, framers of the [[Kyo prefecture]] were menaced by marauding pirates; in order to defend themselves, the farmer folk took up kama, lacking actual weapons. Hideo was the creator of these kama that ensured the farmers' survival. Despite being the architect of the farmers' survival, eventually, Hideo fell out of favor and died in poverty, spending a fortune on ''Hideo's kama'' and arming the locals.
