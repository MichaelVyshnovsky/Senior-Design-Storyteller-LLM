'''Berun''', once known as '''Kheil''', was one of the [[Blades of the Old Man]], an order of [[assassin]]s from [[Sentinelspire (fortress)|Sentinelspire]]. After his death, he was resurrected by [[Chereth]], and retrained as a [[druid]] servant of [[Silvanus]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||Prologue}}

==Appearance==
In {{yearlink|1374}} he was taller than most of the men in the steppes, with lean and hard features, seasoned with wind and sun. He had a single, long braid.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||1}}

==Personality==
Per [[Talieth]], as related by [[Valmir]], Kheil was not much of a talker.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||8}} Talieth, too, confirmed that Kheil killed for coin and often for much less, as he enjoyed killing very much.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||17}}

As Berun, he seemed seemed to present none of those qualities.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||5}}

==Abilities==
Kheil was a top-level assassin, the best amongst the Blades of the Old Man. While disabling [[Sauk]] and his assassins, Berun had cast ''[[summon swarm]]''.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||10}} He had also unlocked the powers of ''[[Erael'len]]'' after his master, Chereth, revived him.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||36}} Even as Kheil, Berun was quite cognizant of eastern spices.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||9}}

==Possessions==
Berun had a rune-carved bow of yew, and one of his arrows was threaded with poisonous [[blue hemlock]] thread.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||2}} After the [[Jalesh Rudra]] of 1374 DR, he also carried a stone hammer, likely enchanted, and a ''[[starstone]]'' shedding a blue-green glow.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||28}}

==History==
Kheil was originally an orphan from [[Elversult]] before [[Alaodin]] took him in and trained him as an assassin.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||34}} While in Sentinelspire, Kheil became close with the hunter Sauk,{{cite book/Sentinelspire||5}} and became a lover of the Old Man's daughter, Lady [[Talieth]]. Per [[Sauk]], Kheil was used for sending a message with the kill, rather than attempting a stealthy slaying, for he was a cold-blooded killer.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||7}} Talieth confirmed this, attesting to Kheil's bloodthirst.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||14}} and had feelings for him even a decade later.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||20}}

On [[Mirtul 2]] of {{yearlink|1365}}, Kheil was sent to slay [[Chereth]] of the [[Masters of the Yuirwood]]{{cite book/Sentinelspire||11}}

The two parted ways after {{yearlink|1369}}, after a fight against raiders from the [[Ganathwood]]. These raiders had struck a farm, killing all but a boy, [[Lewan]], who became Berun's apprentice in turn.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||4}} The leader of the party was his old friend, Sauk, who sought his help in slaying the Old Man of the Mountain, lying to Berun that his master, Chereth, was being tortured by Alaodin. Though Berun was sympathetic to their plight, he would've preferred to come back in force with a number of druids. That was a nonstarter for the assassins, who valued the secrecy of their home. They rebuffed his offer to accompany them if they released Lewan, preferring to keep him as a captive for leverage.

Berun eventually found an opportunity to escape when Sauk split his party, looking to hunt some yaqubi he expected to carry gold from a recent sale.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||12}} While buried under the earth and unconscious, he had a vision of his master, Chereth, calling for his help.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||26}} The earth released him in time for the Jalesh Rudra of [[Tarsakh 19]]; he regained some of his strength with the aid of [[Perch]]. [[Lebeth]] came to him in the evening, and they performed the ceremony of the Jalesh Rudra together. She left him supplies in the morning, including an enchanted stone hammer and a new ''starstone''.

He immediately departed for Sentinelspire, hoping to rescue Chereth and Lewan. He arrived on [[Tarsakh 25]], and made his way through a number of assassins.>{{cite book/Sentinelspire||29}} Once inside, managed to fight off [[Sauk]] before [[killoren]] stopped him in behalf of the Old Man of the Mountain.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||35}} When he entered the [[Tower of the Sun]], he met with his old master, Chereth, who had been impersonating Alaodin. Chereth intended the destruction of civilization across Faer√ªn with a supervolcanic explosion in Sentinelspire, only needing yet ''[[Erael'len]]'' to do this. Unable to abide this, Berun chose to oppose his old master one final time.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||36}} The two fought for a long time, but it was only the timely interventions of Sauk, Talieth, and Lewan that stopped Chereth, at the cost of Berun's life.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||40}}
