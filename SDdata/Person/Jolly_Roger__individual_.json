        "mainbody": "Jolly Roger was a sailor that captained the three-masted rig Lolli in the 14 century DR, sailing the Sea of Fallen Stars on behalf of Goldsteins Zakharan Imports.\nJolly had a grungy look to him.\nThough he was a quite strict man, Jolly loved adventure often swapping them with whoever he conversed with.\nJolly wielded a scimitar as his weapon of choice.\nSometime in the 14 century DR, a group of adventurers in Ravens Bluff were tasked by Harbormaster Calvin Longbottle with tracking down a ship that had been terrorizing the Sea of Fallen Stars in the prior few weeks, rumored to be the ghost ship Strongwind. Unable to lend them a ship due to the crisis, and with the citys Merchants Guild being unwilling to lend Calvin one, the group was forced to go find a ship they could book passage on. One of three possible ships they came across was the Lolli, however, Captain Roger informed them that his ship was booked and if they wished to buy out the ship for 200 gold pieces they would need to speak with his boss, Steven Goldstein."
