Wruz Olglmar was a drow in Gauntlgrym in the Underdark in 1484 DR.
Wruz was a drow who was captured by a mind flayer sect led by Thlorrog. He was used as a slave and guinea-pig for the illithids experiments until an adventurer sent by Soren Ravaris broke into the laboratory and freed him. Wruz had already become an illithid host, but before he succumbed to death he directed the adventurer to destroy most of the illithids resources.
