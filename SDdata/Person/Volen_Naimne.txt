'''Volen Naimne''' was an [[elf|elven]] jeweler for hire from the city of [[Neverwinter]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Volen was already known as a virtuoso and visionary, who treated his work as art, instead of trade. Eventually, Volen parted ways with the jewelry shop that made him famous due to creative differences. Since then, the elf had been performing jewelry work for hire in Neverwinter, offering his services to [[adventurer]]s and defenders of the city.
