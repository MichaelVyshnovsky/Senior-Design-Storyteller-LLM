        "mainbody": "Duromil the Fearless () was a rogue in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.\nDuromil was very good at hiding his true nature as thief and no one in the city suspected him, a sign of his great ability.\nDuromil posed as an average fighter who frequented the inns and taverns of the Castle Ward of Waterdeep but in truth he was a very capable thief who waited for the right occasion to steal precious items. Occasionally, he really worked for Blazidon One-Eye if times were lean. Sometimes, Duromil accompanied adventuring parties as a fighter-for-hire and secretly stole from them. However, he was always very cautious, declining to act if there was even the slightest chance of failure."
