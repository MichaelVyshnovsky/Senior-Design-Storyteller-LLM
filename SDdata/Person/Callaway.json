        "mainbody": "allaway was a hard-working older human farmer who lived in Gillians Hill, a small hamlet along the Trade Way circa 1372 DR.\nCallaway was a hardy worker who spent most of his life under the sun, evidently from his tanned skin. He had a weather-beaten face, gray hair, and bushy sideburns. He tended to talk in a caustic manner as he preferred to work, leaving little time for oratory practice. He also was very superstitious, refusing to talk about strange goings-on or even diseases that plagued the town in 1372 DR. He swished anyone who asked about such things to protect the young ones from such \"evil talk.\"\nCirca 1372 DR, Callaway could be found tending vegetable fiends and cows just outside Torleths Treasures. He often told strangers off, assuming them to be traveling salesmen.\nDuring the time Gillians Hill was affected by a strange vampirism-like plague, the Hero of Daggerford was asked to investigate the disease. When the adventurers arrived in the hamlet, they met Callaway, asking him about Mabda, a local mad hermit who was thought to have some information on the plagues origins. Callaway thought the old healer woman to be a complete loon, nevertheless helped the heroes to her tent on the edge of Gillians Hill."
