Shaelen Masthew was the speaker of Termalaine, in the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale, during the late 15 century DR.
Speaker Masthew was a charming individual and welcoming presence within her hometown. While not exceptionally cunning, she had good judgement and learned much about politics throughout the years.
She was rather stocky and often wore her blonde hair in a pair of long braids.
Shaelen was originally the representative for Termalaines previous speaker, but called for a new election when her predecessor passed from sickness.
