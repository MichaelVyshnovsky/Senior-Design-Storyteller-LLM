Lortej Thul was a halfling thief from Tantras who later moved to Scornubel.
Dressed in a green shirt and dark vest, Lortej had short, slicked-back black hair, light skin, and a prominent nose.
He was familiar with every lock in Scornubel Hall, and was interested in most of the citys halfling women.
Lortej began his career as a thief in the city of Tantras, but was eventually forced to flee after acquiring a reputation much greater than his talents. He moved to Scornubel, where he found employment as an investigator for one of the citys High Advisors, Burdan Hlathiman.
