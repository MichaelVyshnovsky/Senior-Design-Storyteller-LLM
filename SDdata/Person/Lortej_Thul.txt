'''Lortej Thul''' was a [[halfling]] [[thief]] from [[Tantras]] who later moved to [[Scornubel]].

==Description==
Dressed in a green shirt and dark vest, Lortej had short, slicked-back black hair, light skin, and a prominent nose.

==Personality==
He was familiar with every lock in [[Scornubel Hall]], and was interested in most of the city's halfling women.

==History==
Lortej began his career as a thief in the city of Tantras, but was eventually forced to flee after acquiring a reputation much greater than his talents. He moved to Scornubel, where he found employment as an investigator for one of the city's High Advisors, [[Burdan Hlathiman]].
