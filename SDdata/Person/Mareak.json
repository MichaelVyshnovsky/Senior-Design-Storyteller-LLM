Mareak, along with several others, wished to pass through the gate, but some sort of \"city shield\" had been stolen from the Harbormasters Office. The toll collector of the gate, Nant Thangol, demanded everyone be searched, and to acquire fees from them. Mareak was very unhappy about this, and planned to convince the Heroes of the Wide to have a word with Thangol. Specifically, he wanted to heroes to sympathise with him and help the poor folk home to their dinners."
