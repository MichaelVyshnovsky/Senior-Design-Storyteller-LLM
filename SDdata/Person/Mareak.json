        "History": "In [[1482 DR]], not long after [[Abdel Adrian]]'s death on [[Returning Day]], there was a large holdup at the [[Basilisk Gate]]. Mareak, along with several others, wished to pass through the gate, but some sort of \"city shield\" had been stolen from the [[Harbormaster's Office]]. The toll collector of the gate, [[Nant Thangol]], demanded everyone be searched, and to acquire fees from them. Mareak was very unhappy about this, and planned to convince the [[Heroes of the Wide]] to have a word with Thangol. Specifically, he wanted to heroes to sympathise with him and help the poor folk home to their dinners."
