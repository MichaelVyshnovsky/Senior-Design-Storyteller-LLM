'''Kei Bot Li''' was a general in the army of [[Shou Lung]].

==History==
Kei Bot Li was the competent general of the provincial [[Army of Hungtze]].

In [[1359]], War Minister [[Kwan Chan Sen]] choose Kei Bot Li as one of the five generals that would help General [[Batu Min Ho]] in the campaign against the [[Tuigan Horde]].

Kei Bot Li often vehemently disagreed with Batu's unorthodox tactics. Finally, during the siege of [[Shou Kuan]], without Batu's orders, Kei Bot Li and two other generals ordered a suicidal charge that killed most of their army.

Batu considered Kei Bot Li a traitor and quickly executed him himself.
