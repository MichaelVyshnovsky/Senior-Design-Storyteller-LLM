Kei Bot Li was a general in the army of Shou Lung.
Kei Bot Li was the competent general of the provincial Army of Hungtze.
In 1359, War Minister Kwan Chan Sen choose Kei Bot Li as one of the five generals that would help General Batu Min Ho in the campaign against the Tuigan Horde.
Kei Bot Li often vehemently disagreed with Batus unorthodox tactics. Finally, during the siege of Shou Kuan, without Batus orders, Kei Bot Li and two other generals ordered a suicidal charge that killed most of their army.
Batu considered Kei Bot Li a traitor and quickly executed him himself.
