        "mainbody": "thiiyr Velthrann was a sage of the city of Tsurlagol in the Vast in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHis lifes work was his study of the magic swords of the Royal Guard of King Imphras I and King Imbrar I of Impiltur. These swords were among Soargars Legacy, a collection of the relics of Old Impiltur put together by Mage Royal Soargar, but long since lost. Othiiyr dedicated himself to recording the legends around them, and pieced together the histories of eleven surviving swords Ashram Dornavver, or Demonbane Ellendrin, the Weeping Blade Felthann, or Liluths Summertongue Galathos Iltornar, the Goretooth Malagar, the Burnfang Palreth Sarghathuld, or Orcbane Tendar, the Wailer and Ulfindos, the Corsair Scourge.\nOthiiyr assisted the Knights of Imphras II in their continuing quest to find the lost swords of Soargars Legacy.\nHe was able to examine at least one of these swords himself when, in the Year of the Behir, 1342 DR, the thief Gort brought him Ellendrin to identify. Othiiyr offered to buy the sword, but Gort refused, hinting that a contact in the Moonsea had already contracted him to retrieve it. Gort left Othiiyrs house and that was the last anyone admitted to seeing the thief and Ellendrin again.\nIn the late 1350s DR, an unnamed female human adventurer presented another magic sword to Othiiyr for identification. He found it to be the famed lost Telvarans Enchanted Blade. But the client teleported away without even paying, so Othiiyr revealed the finding to othersâ€”when a client didnt pay, it was permitted to break the traditional bond of secrecy meant to exist between sages and clients.\nHe was still working with the Knights as of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, though the above swords were still missing.\nOthiiyr was a regular correspondent with fellow sage Elminster of Shadowdale, and told him all about the swords Ashram, Ellendrin, Galathos, Malagar, and Sarghathuld."
