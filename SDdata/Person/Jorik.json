He discovered it had once been part of a village that had been destroyed by the [[King of Shadows]], so he re-established it as a tavern.\n\nWhen the [[Kalach-Cha]] and [[Khelgar Ironfist]] came to the inn in [[1374 DR]], Jorik asked them to defeat the invaders and if they did he would trade with them and give information about [[Neverwinter]]."
