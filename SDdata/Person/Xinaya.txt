Xinaya was a drow acolyte of Lolth from Velkynvelve in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1486 DR, she was leading a patrol when an adventuring party escaped from the drow outpost. She was telepathically contacted by her superiors near Neverlight Grove and was ordered to search and see if the escaping group was in or near the Grove. However, meeting the myconids there, Xinaya accepted the hospitality of Phylo, who gave her and her minions to Yestabrod to be food and sacrifices to Zuggtmoy. At last, the adventuring party she was ordered to search found Xinaya just before her death, and she asked them to warn Menzoberranzan of the danger of Zuggtmoy.
