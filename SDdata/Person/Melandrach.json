        "mainbody": "'''Melandrach''' was the king of the [[wild elves]] of the [[Misty Forest]] in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].",
        "History": "Melandrach was the king of the Misty Forest long before [[1344 DR]].\n\nAround [[1347 DR]], Melandrach fought with an adventuring party against [[goblin]] bands near [[Daggerford]] and later helped the adventurers to enter [[Illefarn]]. \n\nFor a long time, he opposed the [[Retreat]], thinking it was a rash decision. His cautious nature proved a problem in his rapport with his more impetuous sons [[Neronvain]] and [[Alagarthas]], which ended with his son Neronvain being exiled. It was his prudence, however, that convinced the elves of his kingdom and of the [[High Forest]] kingdom to send him as their main delegate to the [[Council of Waterdeep]] in [[Waterdeep]] around [[1489 DR]]..",
        "Personality": "Melandrach was a very cautious and reflective ruler. True to his elven ancestry, he spent a long time thinking and pondering all options before making a decision."
