        "mainbody": "Melandrach was the king of the wild elves of the Misty Forest in the 14 and 15 centuries DR.\nMelandrach was the king of the Misty Forest long before 1344 DR.\nAround 1347 DR, Melandrach fought with an adventuring party against goblin bands near Daggerford and later helped the adventurers to enter Illefarn. \nFor a long time, he opposed the Retreat, thinking it was a rash decision. His cautious nature proved a problem in his rapport with his more impetuous sons Neronvain and Alagarthas, which ended with his son Neronvain being exiled. It was his prudence, however, that convinced the elves of his kingdom and of the High Forest kingdom to send him as their main delegate to the Council of Waterdeep in Waterdeep around 1489 DR..\nMelandrach was a very cautious and reflective ruler. True to his elven ancestry, he spent a long time thinking and pondering all options before making a decision."
