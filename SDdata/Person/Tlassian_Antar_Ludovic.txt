==History==
Antar was the chief smith of Clan Tlassian in 1479 DR. In his youth, he was trained by a renowned [[dwarf]] master smith known as [[Kvelic Forkbeard]]. Antar was the only non-dwarf who was recognized as a master smith by Kvelic. His armors were so coveted across [[Faer√ªn]], that even dwarf smiths, including Kvelic's other students, went to [[Djerad Thymar]] to buy them.
