Justran Daehl was one of the owners of the Helm at Highsun tavern in Red Larch and secretly a member of the Cult of the Crushing Wave during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Justran managed the Helm at Highsun tavern along with Garlen Harlathurl. He also spied on citizens with the aid of fellow cultist Ghileeda.
In 1491 DR, Justran noticed some adventurers hired to find a diplomatic caravan that had disappeared near the city. They probably uncovered him.
