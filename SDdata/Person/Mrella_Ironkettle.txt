Mrella Ironkettle was a gnome farmer in the village of Hundelstone circa 1360 DR.
Mrella had a stout body with bowed legs and a hooked, broken nose. The faint stench of compost and dung typically clung to her body.
She had an amiable personality.
Mrella notably owned a apron of many pockets that she always wore. She also wore filthy boots that were homespun and came up almost to her waist. Beneath her home she had cellar-caverns where she stored the mushrooms and vegetables she farmed.
Mrella primarily farmed root vegetables such as carrots, parsnips, and radishes.
