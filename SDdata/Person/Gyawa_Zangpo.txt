Gyawa Zangpo was a me-zu oni who lived in Takshang on the slopes of Ghalyi Shan in the Hordelands.
Like many oni, Gyawa had a short temper, flying into fits of rage at the slightest provocation.
His odd behavior caused many rumors about him, such as a claim that he had a vast treasure of stolen items hidden in a secret room of his hermitage.
Gyawa served out his sentence on Toril at Takshang. Freedom would only be granted when he carried the bundles of 10,000 travelers to the top of the mountain pass. Eager for freedom, Gyawa asked every traveler if he could help them. His hot temper usually scared the travelers away before he could help.
