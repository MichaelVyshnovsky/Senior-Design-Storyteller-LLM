Human
Diana Cloppington was an individual who worked at the Witchlight Carnival as a ticket-taker for the carousel.
Due to a deal she made with a hag of the Hourglass Coven, Diana was cursed with a physical form that resembled a piebald centaur.
While she was personable and charming, Diana bore an inner sadness that became apparent over some time.

A side effect of Dianas curse left physically incapable of discussing certain topics without retching up tree sap.
When she was still a human, Diana lost her beloved warhorse to some unknown fate. Hoping to be reunited with her steed, Diana ventured into the Feywild realm of Prismeer, and sought after Granny Skabatha Nightshade. Rather than bring Dianas horse back, Granny Nightshade fused Dianas body with that of her mount, transforming her into her form that so closely resembled a centaur.
After Diana ran away from Prismeer, she encountered Mister Light, one of two partners who ran the Witchlight Carnival. Mister Light felt for Dianas plight, and offered her both a job and home within the traveling Fey carnival.
