'''Brian''' was a [[dwarf]] [[adventurer]] who journeyed on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Brian was part of an adventuring party led by a man named [[Aradin]]. Their group also included [[Remira]], [[Barth]], and [[Liam]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Brian and his fellow adventurers were hired by the [[Baldurian]] [[wizard]] [[Lorroakan]] to recover an [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Nightsong]]''. To accomplish their mission, they served as guides to the [[archdruid]], Master [[Halsin]] of the [[Emerald Grove]], and made their way out to the [[Shattered Sanctum]] temple. But the powerful druid had a different goal: investigating strange goings-on related to [[mind flayer]] tadpole infections in the region.

The group was caught by the [[cult of the Absolute]] during their excursion. Brian was cut to pieces by the goblins and turned into a spit roast for their feast celebrating a successful assault on [[Waukeen's Rest]]. One of the goblins, [[Klagga|Tracker Klagga]], took all his belongings, including a pair of blue pants and some poetry written by the dwarf serving as a map leading to the Nightsong.
