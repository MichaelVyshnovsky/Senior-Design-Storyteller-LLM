Brian was a dwarf adventurer who journeyed on the Sword Coast during the late 15 century DR.
Brian was part of an adventuring party led by a man named Aradin. Their group also included Remira, Barth, and Liam.
As of the , Brian and his fellow adventurers were hired by the Baldurian wizard Lorroakan to recover an artifact known as the Nightsong. To accomplish their mission, they served as guides to the archdruid, Master Halsin of the Emerald Grove, and made their way out to the Shattered Sanctum temple. But the powerful druid had a different goal investigating strange goings-on related to mind flayer tadpole infections in the region.
The group was caught by the cult of the Absolute during their excursion. Brian was cut to pieces by the goblins and turned into a spit roast for their feast celebrating a successful assault on Waukeens Rest. One of the goblins, Tracker Klagga, took all his belongings, including a pair of blue pants and some poetry written by the dwarf serving as a map leading to the Nightsong.
