'''Razor''' was a [[cat]] belonging to [[Benelaius]], a retired [[War Wizard]], at his cottage outside the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Along with [[Grimalkin]], Razor was one of almost a hundred cats in Benalaius's possession. They served him as companions, guardians, and agents, and were good judges of character. He could communicate silently with them.

==Personality==
{{fq
| text   = A coal black cat with yellow eyes, he was notoriously testy, and when I trod, quite by accident, on the end of his tail, he erupted into a spitting, clawing, biting tornado. His fangs sank deeply into my ankle, and with that final ''bon mot'' he scurried down the stairs to seek a less hazardous berth.

Razor was infamously irritable and quick to attack with the claws and fangs for which he was named. Nevertheless, he did enjoy being tickled under his chin.

==Description==
Razor had fur as black as [[coal]] and yellow eyes.

==History==
Returning home late on the night of [[Eleint 16]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Benelaius's servant [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] inadvertently stepped on the sleeping Razor's tail. Razor responded by spitting, scratching, and biting his ankle.

After midnight on [[Eleint 20]], Razor was one of a number of cats present at the meeting of townsfolk Benelaius called to reveal the murderer of [[Dovo]] and [[Grodoveth]], as well as an [[Iron Throne]] spy ring. Benelaius had Razor bite Mayor [[Tobald]] on the ankle to make him limp, as part of this plan to frame him for the crimes he was already complicit in.
