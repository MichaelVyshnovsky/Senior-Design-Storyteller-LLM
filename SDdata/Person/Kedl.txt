'''Kedl of the Three Rings''' was an [[enchanter]] [[mage]] of some repute from the town of [[Phlan]], active some years before the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Kedl was a man who valued quality fashionable clothing, jewelry, and other accessories.

==History==
During his life, Kedl of the Three Rings developed and perfected the technique that allowed him to wear three [[enchanted]] [[ring]]s simultaneously. In addition to the magic jewelry, he wore enchanted defensive [[Silver bracers of Kedl|polished silver bracers]]. Eventually, Kedl sold his magic bracers to finance the purchase of more powerful enchanted rings. Several years later, Kedl of the Three Rings was killed in an [[orc]]ish raid on Phlan.
