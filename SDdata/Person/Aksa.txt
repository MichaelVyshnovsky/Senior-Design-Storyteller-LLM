Aksa was a famous Netherese arcanist that lived during the Golden Age of Netheril, credited with inventing many basic and advanced spells used in later years.
The arcanist appeared as a fierce and surly man who had untidy hair.
Aksa was interested in the formulation of destructive spells and thus was known as the Destroyer. He also took an interest in alteration spells that changed or repaired living and non-living material.
Unlike others of his field who were often calm and composed, Aksa was the opposite. He was spontaneous and engaged in sudden, unplanned activities and was hard to get close to as a friend. Despite appearing overly intense and bad-tempered, this was actually an act of sorts, and he cared a lot for other people, especially children. He regularly took breaks from his magical research to go out in public disguised as a street vendor (this disguise never worked), and would provide performances for children and adults that were both very entertaining and contained meaningful messages for the audience.
Aksa was born in . The fierce arcanist experimented with several types of spells throughout his life. He created his first spell, mending, at only 21 years old in . When he developed his disintegrate spell and tested it in his home, he expected it to remove an entire wall, but bored a number of one-inch holes instead. Utterly fascinated by the odd behaviour of the spell, he cast it twice more and unintentionally caused the entire northern face of his house to collapse from the structural damage. Aka was unruffled by the minor disaster and simply set about altering the spell and testing it on the southern side of his house while builders worked to repair what he had destroyed. In , the Destroyer finally met his end.
