        "mainbody": "'''Firzu''' was a shady merchant who sailed past the town of [[Reithwin]], along the [[River Chionthar]], sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Firzu was a notorious merchant who regularly tried to sail past Reithwin's toll house without paying the toll for the trade goods he transported. The toll house workers confiscated a [[silver]] and [[gold]] chalice from Firzu's shipment, but soon after, it disappeared from the vault to [[Gerringothe Thorm]]'s disdain. Firzu's life ended sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{Thorm-time}} when the town was plunged into the darkness and turned into the [[shadow-cursed lands]]. His charred body, still wearing an [[enchanted]] ''[[Firzu's ring of trading|ring of trading]]'', was stored in the [[House of Healing (Reithwin)|House of Healing]]'s morgueâ€”likely murdered by the wicked [[Sharran]] [[Thorm]] family for avoiding the tolls."
