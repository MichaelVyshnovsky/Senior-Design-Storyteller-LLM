'''Halsin''' was the [[wood elf]] [[archdruid]] of the [[Emerald Grove]] on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He led his people in service to the Oak Father, [[Silvanus]].
{{Quote|Grace is bestowed by nature, not me.|Grand Druid Halsin.}}

==Description==
He had an imposing figure as a [[Wood elf|male wood elf]], and was described as a "bear of an elf". He suspected his "bearish" figure was due to a [[half-orc]] ancestral link or some other species. He shared a face similar to his father, abeit unscarred. He received the scar on his face during an incident while he was shapeshifted as a [[bear]]—a she-bear in mating season had mistaken him and was offended by his discouragement.

==Personality==
Despite his tenacity in combat, Halsin was a gentle, honest elf, and treasured the sanctity and beauty of nature. Though a powerful healer with a lofty title, Halsin was humble and patient, but willing to act with force if the need arisen. He was a strong leader who was highly respected among his fellow druids. He was polyamorous and he viewed carnal pleasures as a natural calling; one of Halsin's core beliefs was that desire should flourish wherever it found purchase.

==Abilities==
As an experienced druid, Halsin was a skilled [[Wild shape|shapeshifter]] of the [[Circle of the Moon]]. He was capable of transforming himself into a mighty [[cave bear]].

He was skilled in [[Herbalism kit|herbalism]] and [[Alchemist's supplies|potions]] as a healer. He also had skills in woodcarving.

==Relationships==
{{Quote|My Dear Nettie,

I entrust you with the circlet to open the library. Wear it always. If you need to enter the vault, talk to Rath. He has the rune, but won't give it to anyone, so be sure you have good reason to ask. Protect my research while I'm gone and take care of the animals. Don't give fish to Tuffet, she's getting lazy. |Master Halsin.}}
Halsin was served well by his fellow druid [[Rath (druid)|Rath]], and several others. While the senior [[Kagha]] served as archdruid in his stead, she [[Shadow Druids|hardly]] shared Halsin's outlook on leadership. He had an apprentice named [[Nettie]].{{Quote|I had a friend when I was young, long ago. He played with me in the forests where I grew up... but eventually, I realized no one else had heard of him. It was Thaniel, of course. Nature was my very first friend. I get older, but he hasn't changed a day.|Halsin.}}As a child, he became strongly bonded and a playmate with a [[nature spirit]], [[Thaniel]] of the [[Western Heartlands]]. He realized his belief after age 110, coming-of-age, to be a serious protector of nature for his friend.

He was the last of his line, with the [[Wood elf|rest]] buried in the [[High Forest]] under the [[Grandfather Tree]]. From then on, he dedicated himself to the Emerald Grove as his family and to Silvanus as his teacher.

==History==
[[File:Halsin.png|thumb|''Halsin in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].''|316x316px]]
In his youth as a druid, Halsin foolhardily visited the [[Underdark]] to experience its otherworldly fauna's beauty, but was captured by a [[drow]] [[matron mother]] and stayed in her House for three years as her imprisoned consort.

In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, on [[Uktar 6]], Halsin sent two newer recruited druids north to help a village blighted with two years of failed crops. On [[Uktar 9]], Halsin decided to pay a visit to a sudden [[Baldur's Gate]] group camping nearby the next day for harming nature that killed the cubs of a fox. Two bears and the fox already came to the [[Emerald Grove]] to alert the druid. On [[Uktar 10]], Halsin tried to reason with the pioneering group, but they did not valued nature and wanted to 'farm the land and make a new city of their own' so the druid had to make a creative move. By [[Uktar 12]], Halsin secretly instigated a mudslide to bury half their farming equipment and made the rest useless. He also received reports of a [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] to a village south, therefore, sent three rangers to investigate. If the target was true, he would contact the [[Oakenhall|House of Silvanus]] for aid.

Sometime around the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{Thorm-time}} Halsin came into conflict with [[Ketheric Thorm]] and the army of [[Dark Justiciars]] he had formed in the [[Underdark]]. While Halsin's [[Emerald Grove]] and the allied [[Jaheira|Harpers]] commanded by [[Khelben Arunsun|Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] emerged [[Ketheric Thorm's war|victorious]], the great druid could not prevent them [[Shadow-cursed Lands|bringing shadow]] upon the lands around the [[Moonrise Towers]]. His Archdruid was lost to the curse, and Halsin succeeded by leading the survivors away. His friend [[Thaniel]], a nature spirit connected to the [[Western Heartlands|Western Heartlands']] wilderness near the Moonrise Towers, was also cursed by Ketheric.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Halsin opened up his grove to a group of [[tiefling]]s that had fled west from the city of [[Elturel]] as of [[Eleint 14]].

That same year, accompanied by his apprentice healer [[Nettie]], Halsin encountered a drow who had been infected with a [[mind flayer]] tadpole, but had yet to undergo the process of [[ceremorphosis]]. The pair returned to the Emerald Grove to conduct an examination of the non-ceremorphed drow's corpse. Intrigued and worried about this, he began traveling west to the Moonrise Towers alone, meeting up with [[Aradin]] and his adventuring mercenary party along the way since [[Marpenoth 2]]. Unfortunately, by [[Uktar]], Halsin was captured by the [[goblinoid]] members of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], and imprisoned as a [[bear]] by [[Goblin|goblins]] within the ruined [[Selûnite]] temple referred to as the [[Shattered Sanctum]].
