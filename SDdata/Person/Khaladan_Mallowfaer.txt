'''Khaladan Mallowfaer''' was the Master of Revels at [[Castle Obarskyr]], in [[Suzail]], during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was dark-hearted, cowardly, sneering, and upset at people having the right to keep secrets from him. Lord Harkuldragon considered him greedy, conceited, and snake-like in his maliciousness.

==Activities==
As Master of Revels, he was in charge of formal protocols.

==Relationships==
The man feared [[Ganrahast Aeiulvana]], and resented anyone who could hide information from him.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|190|18}} As far as [[Manshoon]] knew, he was kinless, unmarried, and loveless.

==History==
During one of the fugitive [[Elminster Aumar]]'s covert entrances into [[Castle Obarskyr]] in [[Suzail]], he used an amulet that was almost certainly a ''[[medallion of thoughts]]'' to scout through walls. One of the people he discovered in this way was Khaladan Mallowfaer, whom he caught talking to an exhausted senior chamberjack, [[Halance Tarandar]]; Mallowfaer needled him about why he was so tired, to which he claimed confidentiality at Royal Magician Ganrahast's request. That was enough to get Mallowfaer to back off.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|151-152|14}}

Later, after Ganrahast and [[Vainrence]], another high-ranking War Wizard, went missing, Khaladan Mallowfaer argued with the Steward [[Rorstil Hallowdant]], who disagreed with many of the changes he had tried to make to the ceremonies in response.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|316-318|30}}

After the calamitous [[Council of the Dragon]], Lord [[Harkuldragon (Lord)|Harkuldragon]] had intended to have him assassinated, for the crime of having found out something of Harkuldragon's own treasons; however, that didn't come to much, as the Lord found himself killed shortly after.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|289-290|31}}

==Rumors & Legends==
He was rumored to be as much of an overweening, vile-hearted man as he actually was.
