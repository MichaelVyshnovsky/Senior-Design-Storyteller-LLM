Khelessa Draga was a spy of the Lords Alliance in Menzoberranzan during the late 15 century DR.
Khelessa was a high elf from Silverymoon. She joined the Lords Alliance and was tasked with the mission of infiltrating Menzoberranzan disguised as a drow.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, she stopped contacting her superiors.
Later, however, she approached an expedition led by some adventurers hired by Bruenor Battlehammer to investigate the threat of a demon lord and told them about an ambush of a drow battalion against them.
