        "mainbody": "Omar Haraad was the mayor of Amkethran, although this was mainly just in name, as the village was controlled by the Bhaalspawn Balthazar.\nIn the late 1360s DR, Balthazar and his mercenaries essentially took control of the village Omar managed. After the occupation, Omars residents were starving and dying all over the village by 1368 DR.\nHis daughter, Asana, stole money from Balthazars mercenaries, and they threatened to kill her. He commented that her actions were wrong, but her motives were pure, as she wished to feed the citizens. He cried out to the masses to stand up against the \"brutes\" that invaded his town. Gorions Ward may have saved his daughter from public execution."
