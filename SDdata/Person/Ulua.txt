Ulua was a member of the noble House Uoswiir of Menzoberranzan and a half-sister of its scion, Vhaidra Uoswiir, in the late 14 century DR.
Ulua, like her half-sister, fled Menzoberranzan when much of her family was slaughtered by rival houses. Ulua was unsure if her sister survived the slaughter, receiving conflicting reports from her contacts. Subsequently, Ulua reconnected with Vhaidra, who took to the adventuring life. During that time, Ulua conducted operations to regroup House Uoswiir survivors and eliminate its rivals.
With Vhaidras financing the operation, Ulua eventually learned the location of the monastery of the Dark Ravensâ€”the assassins hired by the rival houses to execute House Uoswiir. The Dark Ravens were a splinter esoteric order of the Black Raven Monastery who pledged themselves to become the most lethal among assassins. Vhaidra stormed this monastery and found its archimandrite, Draezen Direhand. He dismissed Ulua on the grounds that she was only of half-Uoswiir blood and said that House Uoswiir would die with Vhaidra. Once the half-sister returned to Baldurs Gate, Ulua informed her that she had already sent agents to destroy the monastery, having heard of her success and that, when Vhaidra was ready to take up her place as head of the Uoswiir household, she would not stand alone.
