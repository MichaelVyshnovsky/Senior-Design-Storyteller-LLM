Zina was one of the favorite watchdogs of the Durinbold patriar family of Baldurs Gate, who died sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.
Zinas sarcophagus contained her body, an elixir of cloud giant strength, a stuffed owlbear chewtoy, and a beak from a real owlbear.
By the , Chief Houndmaster Pol was long dead and interred within the Durinbold Mausoleum of the Lower City Graveyard, surrounded by the interred bodies of his favorite beasts, Gordis, Rocky, and Zina. The trainer and his three dogs ended up as ghosts that would attack anyone who dared to invade and disturb the Durinbold family tombs. Zinas sarcophagus was inscribed with "Lionheart Zina, fierce watchdog â€“ at night, no one dared to pass her post."
