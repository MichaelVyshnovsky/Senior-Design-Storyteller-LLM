'''Zina''' was one of the favorite [[dog|watchdogs]] of the [[Durinbold]] [[patriar]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]], who died sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Zina's sarcophagus contained her body, an ''[[elixir of cloud giant strength]]'', a stuffed [[owlbear]] chewtoy, and a beak from a real owlbear.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Pol (houndmaster)|Chief Houndmaster Pol]] was long dead and interred within the Durinbold Mausoleum of the [[Lower City Graveyard]], surrounded by the interred bodies of his favorite beasts, [[Gordis]], [[Rocky]], and Zina. The trainer and his three dogs ended up as [[ghost]]s that would attack anyone who dared to invade and disturb the Durinbold family tombs. Zina's sarcophagus was inscribed with: "Lionheart Zina, fierce watchdog â€“ at night, no one dared to pass her post."
