'''Darkas the Storyteller''' was a half-elven woman who dwelled in [[Memnon]] in [[Calimshan]] through the 13th and 14th centuries [[DR]].

At over a century old by [[1370 DR]], she was gray-haired and had only one eye, but it remained keenly observant.

She had a very good memory of her long life in Memnon, and clearly knew all the rumors and happenings about the city. The secrets she knew were suggested in her songs. She was popular with almost everyone in Memnon, and was very influential politically.
