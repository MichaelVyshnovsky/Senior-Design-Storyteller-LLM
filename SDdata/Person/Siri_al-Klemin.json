Kenai and Siri were known to make deals with the travelers as well, but evil intentions were usually hidden behind their charismatic smiles.\nSiri was forced into penance by the Great Khan of the Dao for committing an unknown crime. He missed his homeland greatly and could be bribed to talk about it if paid enough."
