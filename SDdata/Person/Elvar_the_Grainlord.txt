Elvar the Grainlord was the ruler of the small village of Triel.
Elvar was generally a reasonable lord when it came to trade, though he had two mild obsessions. The first was his fear that the community might run out of food, and the second was his never-ending search for the right deity to worship.
Elvar had a hunger for news and items such as food, firewood, and food-preservation items. Those who brought such items were given a feast.
