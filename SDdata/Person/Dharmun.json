On the night of [[Eleasis 10]], the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, a [[black firedrake]] that had been sent to attack  the canal site by the [[Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rym√ºt]] went into Dharmun's tent and snatched his teammate away. Dharmun ran away to get help. He, [[Ivar Devorast]], and [[Hrothgar Deepcarver]] went in pursuit of the drake. They found it on the [[Naga Plains]], but in the ensuing fight, Dharmun was melted to death by the drake's fire/acid breath weapon. Afterward, Devorast and Hrothgar succeeded in killing the drake."
