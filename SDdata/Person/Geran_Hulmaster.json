        "mainbody": "'''Geran Hulmaster''' was a powerful [[human]] [[swordmage]] and a member the ruling [[Hulmaster]] family of [[Hulburg]] on the coast of the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Geran stood {{SI|6'2\"|ft-in|long=yes}} tall and had shoulder-length brown hair that was cut short in the front.",
        "Possessions": "Geran Hulmaster wielded a Myth Drannan [[backsword]] that he earned in service to the [[Coronal]] of [[Myth Drannor]]. He has also wielded the sword ''[[Umbrach Nyth]]'', the Sword of Shadows, which was created for Geran by King [[Aesperus]] during his raid on Griffonwatch to dispatch the [[runehelm]]s that were created by Rhovann. The sword itself was a double-edged [[broadsword]] with a blade of an unknown black metal. The hilt was wrapped in dark pebbled leather, and its pommel was a flat disk in which small glyphs were inscribed around a large [[onyx]] gemstone. It was a sword forged of shadow and meant to dispose creatures of shadow. Geran also had a lightly enchanted suit of [[leather armor]].",
        "Relationships": "Geran was the cousin of [[Kara Hulmaster]], the regent of Hulburg.",
        "History": "Geran was formerly a member of an adventuring group, the [[Company of the Dragon Shield]]. After retiring from adventuring, Geran partnered with a [[ghostwise halfling]] named [[Hamil Alderheart]] to form the [[Red Sail Coster]] in [[Tantras]]. Geran later left his position with the Red Sail Coster to study sword magic in [[Myth Drannor]] under the tutelage of the [[gold elf]] swordmaster [[Daried Selsherryn]]. However, he was banished permanently from Myth Drannor in the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, for maiming a [[moon elf]] mage named [[Rhovann Disarnnyl]] in a duel over the affections of a moon elf maiden.\n\nWhen Rhovann seized power in Hulburg in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Geran was exiled to [[Thentia]] with the rest of the [[Hulmaster]] clan. Geran engaged in several clandestine missions to destabilize Rhovann's rule and was captured by Rhovann while attempting to infiltrate Hulburg the {{YearlinkName|1480}}. As retribution for his maiming by Geran, Rhovann dissolved Geran's right hand with magical acid. Geran was rescued by his friends [[Sarth Khul Riizar]], Hamil, and [[Miyra]], who traveled with him to the [[Shadowfell]] to destroy the magical device Rhovann used to animate his [[golems]]. Geran later slew Rhovann in a battle at [[Griffonwatch Keep]] and took Rhovann's magical silver hand to replace the hand Rhovann destroyed. With Rhovann dead and the golems disabled, the Hulmasters were able to retake control of Hulburg."
