Amdramnar hoped to make [[Sharantyr]] his mate one day.\n\nLater, following hints discovered in the writings of the long-dead Shadowmaster High [[Melvydur]], Amdramnar found a secret grotto inside the castle.<ref> However, using a separate way, his rival [[Argast]] also found it. They decided to temporarily cooperate to discover the secret of this place. Afterward, both decided to travel to [[Faerun]].<ref> Upon their arrival they were attacked by some members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] but thanks to their shapechanging powers, Amdramnar killed all the cultists. After arriving in [[Daggerdale]], Amdramnar and Argast learned about the death of Elminster during the [[second battle of Shadowdale]].<ref>\n\nLater they went in disguise into the [[Tower of Ashaba]] in order to collect more information about Elminster.<ref> Upon the arrival of [[Tantor Dauntinghorn]], envoy of King [[Azoun IV]] of [[Cormyr]], Argast and Amdramnar posed as the [[War Wizard]] delegates [[Luthtor]] of [[Suzail]] and [[Shaerl Amcathra|Shaerl Mourngrym]] in order to gain information.<ref>\n\nAmdramnar was killed by [[Itharr]] and [[Belkram]].<ref>"
