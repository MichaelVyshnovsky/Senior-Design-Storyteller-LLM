        "mainbody": "Thoran was a shadar-kai warrior in the ruin of Spellgard.\nThoran was once the apprentice of a cabal of Shadowfell sages until he was exiled for stealing forbidden tomes. In his exile, he started studying the secrets of Netheril, becoming an expert on Netherese spells to bind an arcane spirit. After reading \"The Analects of Kuryon\", Thoran understood that his perfect victim would be Lady Saharel.\nIn 1479 DR, Thoran and an army of minions took control of the central tower of Spellgard with the intent to find and enslave the Lady."
