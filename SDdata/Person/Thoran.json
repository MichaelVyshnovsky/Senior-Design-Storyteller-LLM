In his exile, he started studying the secrets of [[Netheril]], becoming an expert on Netherese spells to bind an arcane spirit. After reading \"[[The Analects of Kuryon]]\", Thoran understood that his perfect victim would be Lady [[Saharel]].\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], Thoran and an army of minions took control of the central tower of Spellgard with the intent to find and enslave the Lady."
