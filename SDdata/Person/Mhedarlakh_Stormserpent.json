        "mainbody": "Mhedarlakh Stormserpent was the patriarch of House Stormserpent in the late 15 century DR.\nIn his dotage by the time he became patriarch, Mhedarlakh was doddering along.\nMhedarlakh had become patriarch of House Mhedarlakh at some point during the 15 century DR.\nMhedarlakhs sister-in-law was Narmitra Stormserpent. Marlin Stormserpent was his nephew.\nAt some point in the 15 century DR, Narmitra Stormserpent shrewdly had the senile Mhedarlakh become patriarch after the death of her husband. Mhedarlakh was the acting head, but he was neither head nor heir of the House, which was extremely frustrating for their fellow nobles as he was neither a reliable source nor capable of binding the house in agreements."
