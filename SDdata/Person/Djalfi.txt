Master Djalfi was a Red Wizard of Thay and an instructor of the Academy of Shapers and Binders.
Djalfi was one of the most notorious teachers at the Academy of Shapers and Binders. He was one of the few in the academy who was not involved in the feud between the Founder and Araman, so when Araman seized power inside the academy, Djalfi continued his work.
However he decided to help his former student and fellow instructor Safiya and the Kalach-Cha to secretly enter the building.
