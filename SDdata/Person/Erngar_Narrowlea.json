        "mainbody": "Gentle Father '''Erngar Narrowlea''' was a priest of [[Lathander]] in [[Voonlar]] during the time period roughly corresponding to the term of Bron (sheriff) [[Buorstag Hlammythyl]], until at least [[1372 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Erngar was a forward-looking person who noticed details and speculated on how they might impact future events. He was kindly and helped those in need.",
        "Activities": "His primary duty was to tend the [[House of Holy Light]], the shrine to the Morninglord in Voonlar, along with a few lay persons. In addition to nurturing the open-to-all herb garden around the shrine, he sold ''[[potion of extra healing|potions of extra healing]]'' and [[holy water]] to the many visitors that stopped by while passing through Voonlar.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Bron and the [[Cyric]]ists of the [[Dark God Reformed]], Erngar did what he could to upset their plans without drawing attention to himself. He also assisted other followers of Lathander by providing small loans for business purposes.",
        "Possessions": "Father Narrowlea tried to keep at least twenty large [[glass]] [[jar]]s of holy water on hand for sale at the shrine. His supply of healing potions was usually limited to six, replenished every [[tenday]] by mid-level priests of Lathander who passed through town.",
