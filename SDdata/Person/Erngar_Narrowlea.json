        "mainbody": "Gentle Father Erngar Narrowlea was a priest of Lathander in Voonlar during the time period roughly corresponding to the term of Bron (sheriff) Buorstag Hlammythyl, until at least 1372 DR.\nErngar was a forward-looking person who noticed details and speculated on how they might impact future events. He was kindly and helped those in need.\nHis primary duty was to tend the House of Holy Light, the shrine to the Morninglord in Voonlar, along with a few lay persons. In addition to nurturing the open-to-all herb garden around the shrine, he sold potions of extra healing and holy water to the many visitors that stopped by while passing through Voonlar.\nUnbeknownst to the Bron and the Cyricists of the Dark God Reformed, Erngar did what he could to upset their plans without drawing attention to himself. He also assisted other followers of Lathander by providing small loans for business purposes.\nFather Narrowlea tried to keep at least twenty large glass jars of holy water on hand for sale at the shrine. His supply of healing potions was usually limited to six, replenished every tenday by mid-level priests of Lathander who passed through town.\nCategoryClerics\nCategoryPriests and priestesses\nCategoryPriests of Lathander\nCategoryWorshipers of Lathander\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryInhabitants of Voonlar\nCategoryInhabitants of the Moonsea\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\n0aunw6hy36b1z5w1apro9u63q57jomg"
