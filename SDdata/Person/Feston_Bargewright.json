        "mainbody": "Feston Bargewright was an innkeeper and the founder of the settlement of Bargewright Inn within the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nOnce, he was the proprietor of a simple wayside inn standing alone atop a hill beside the ford. However, after numerous attacks from bandits and brigands, Feston elected to fortify the hill. This feat was accomplished with the help of several Waterdhavian merchants whom Feston had encouraged to join him to share the costs. Bargewright Inn was well-established by 1358 DR.\nFeston owned and operated the Bargewright Inn itself. The Bargewright Inn sold a chilled green wine from Mintarn given that it was an acquired taste, Volothamp Geddarm suspected Feston stocked it because he had a taste for it.\nHe also chaired the Council of Directors that served as the local government.\nHis brother Aldon Bargewright, was a ranger who led the local militia and worked as the stablemaster. By 1370 DR, Aldon had succeeded Feston as chairman of the Council of Directors.\nA descendant and namesake, Feston Bargewright, was innkeeper around 1486 DR."
