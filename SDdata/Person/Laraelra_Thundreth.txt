Laraelra Thundreth (), also known as The Captain, was a the proprietor of the Low Lantern tavern in Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR.This race, class, and age of this character appears to completely change from Murder in Baldurs Gate to Baldurs Gate Descent into Avernus. In the first sourcebook (set a decade prior to the latter), she is stated to be a middle-aged half-elf rogue (described as a sorceress too, but a rogue in terms of class). In the latter sourcebook, she is stated to be a middle-aged human mage. It is unknown how this character (assuming it is the same one and not someone else taking on this identity) changed race, class, and decreased in age over time, whether it be an in-universe or an out-of-universe reason. For the purposes of this wiki, the most recent information is favored.
She ran a very permissive establishment, allowing her patrons to conduct nearly any manner of business while they drink and gamble. She even allowed them to indulge in barroom fights with one another, so long as she received compensation for any damages.
Within her cabin in the Low Lantern, Laraelra kept a trapped treasure chest that held some of her valuables, including her personal correspondence and spellbook.
Her familiar was a crab that enjoyed sitting atop her shoulder.
In the 1480s DR, Laraelra caught the attention of both Torlin Silvershield and Ulder Ravengard. Torlin sent his goons to investigate her potential activities with the Guild, whilst Ulder sent the Flaming Fist to turn her establishment upside down and seize her. She attempted to flee by lowering a rope ladder towards her escape dinghy. Laraelra planned on bargaining with her captors by offering them an expensive jeweled necklace.
