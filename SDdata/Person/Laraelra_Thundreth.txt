'''Laraelra Thundreth''' ({{pronounce|lah|RAIL|rah|THUN|dreth}}), also known as '''The Captain''', was a the proprietor of the [[Low Lantern]] tavern in [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref group="note" name="change">This race, class, and age of this character appears to completely change from ''[[Murder in Baldur's Gate]]'' to ''[[Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus]]''. In the first sourcebook (set a decade prior to the latter), she is stated to be a middle-aged [[half-elf]] [[rogue]] (described as a sorceress too, but a rogue in terms of class). In the latter sourcebook, she is stated to be a middle-aged [[human]] [[mage]]. It is unknown how this character (assuming it is the same one and not someone else taking on this identity) changed race, class, and decreased in age over time, whether it be an in-universe or an out-of-universe reason. For the purposes of this wiki, the most recent information is favored.
{{Quote
|The only '[[evil]] [[god]]s' in the Gate are the swine who run it â€” the [[Flaming Fist|Fist]], [[patriar]]s, and [[the Guild|Guild]]. They're all dirty. At least the Guild is truthful about how it operates.
|Laraelra Thundreth
}}

==Abilities==
She ran a very permissive establishment, allowing her patrons to conduct nearly any manner of business while they drink and gamble. She even allowed them to indulge in barroom fights with one another, so long as she received compensation for any damages.

==Possessions==
Within her cabin in the Low Lantern, Laraelra kept a trapped treasure chest that held some of her valuables, including her personal correspondence and [[spellbook]].

==Relationships==
Her [[familiar]] was a [[crab]] that enjoyed sitting atop her shoulder.

==History==
In the 1480s DR, Laraelra caught the attention of both [[Torlin Silvershield]] and [[Ulder Ravengard]]. Torlin sent his goons to investigate her potential activities with the Guild, whilst Ulder sent the Flaming Fist to turn her establishment upside down and seize her. She attempted to flee by lowering a [[rope ladder]] towards her escape dinghy. Laraelra planned on bargaining with her captors by offering them an expensive jeweled [[necklace]].
