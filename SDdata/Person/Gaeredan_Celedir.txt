Gaeredan Celedir was the chief aide to Admiral Marianon Silmara, elven ambassador to Bral.
Gaeradan was an elf with silver hair. He wore a pair of bracers of defense.
Gaeredan had a quiet and somewhat withdrawn personality. 
As aide to Admiral Silmara, Gaeredan rarely left her side and excelled in advising her and in keeping her up to speed on the intentions of other notable persons in the asteroid city. 
As a wizard, he was skilled in spells such as domination and hold monster, in addition to many lesser ones. 
Besides his magic bracers, Gaeredan owned a magic quarterstaff, a wand of frost, and a ring of truth. He sometimes used potions of speed or of healing. 
When Gaeredan became aide to the ambassador, he had already lived on the Rock of Bral for some 40 years.
