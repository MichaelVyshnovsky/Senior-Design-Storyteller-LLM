Chvar Eldenbow was the field agent of the Moonstars for the Western Heartlands in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Chvar was always a knowledge seeker, gaining the informal title of "Loreseeker". In his travels through the entire Western Heartlands and along the Sword Coast he discovered much lore hidden in wilder territories.
In 1370 DR, Chvar was chosen to be field agent of the Moonstars for the North.
