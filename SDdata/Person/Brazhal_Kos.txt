'''Brazhal Kos''' was a powerful [[enchanter]] and a member of the [[Red Wizard]]s of [[Thay]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
For many years, the nobles of Thay led hunting parties out on the waters of [[Lake Thaylambar]] in an effort to kill some of the great [[dragon turtle]]s that inhabited its icy depths. While this was extremely dangerous, and often led to disaster, Brazhal Kos developed a means to actually enslave the famed beasts in the year [[1371 DR]].

Kos created a [[magic]]al harness that bent the creature's will to his own and granted him dominion over its actions. He then offered his services to [[Homen Odesseiron]], the [[tharchion]] of [[Surthay (tharch)|Surthay]], likely to aid the ruler's efforts at military control over [[Lake Mulsantir]] in his constant struggles with [[Rashemen]] to the north.
