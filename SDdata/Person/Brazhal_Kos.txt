Brazhal Kos was a powerful enchanter and a member of the Red Wizards of Thay during the 14 century DR.
For many years, the nobles of Thay led hunting parties out on the waters of Lake Thaylambar in an effort to kill some of the great dragon turtles that inhabited its icy depths. While this was extremely dangerous, and often led to disaster, Brazhal Kos developed a means to actually enslave the famed beasts in the year 1371 DR.
Kos created a magical harness that bent the creatures will to his own and granted him dominion over its actions. He then offered his services to Homen Odesseiron, the tharchion of Surthay, likely to aid the rulers efforts at military control over Lake Mulsantir in his constant struggles with Rashemen to the north.
