        "mainbody": "'''Burnas Tellrot''' was a shady fortune-seeking adventurer from [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' 1372 DR.\n\n{{quote|''If you mean  do I cut purses and rob little old ladies of their valued [[gem]]s and [[jewelry]], the answer is \"no\". My plans go far beyond such petty, small-minded endeavors.''|Burnas Tellrot}}",
        "Description": "Burnas Tellrot kept his face hidden in the shadows of his woolen [[cloak]]'s hood. He claimed he hid his face due to terrible hideous scarring.",
        "History": "In 1372 DR he was staying at the [[Happy Cow]] inn searching for mercenaries. He asked anyone interested to listen to the tale of ''[[Peredus]] the Great'' that [[Jorey Fontalas]], the [[bard]] entertainer of the Happy Cow gladly performed. Burnas Tellrot was searching for the well, mentioned in Jorey's poem, as it indicated the spot where the hero of legends has perished. Burnas was hoping to find the magic sword that was prominently featured in the legends of ''Peredus the Great''.\n\nBurnas Tellrot was offering to split the loot he  was hoping to lift off the hero's long-dead body, with anyone willing to help the shady halfling find the final resting place in the well. Burnas hoped to use the treasures of Peredus to finance his retirement."
