        "mainbody": "relin Starbrow was the Roadwarden, the leader of the Roadwarden Guard, stationed in the Skull Crag Keep in the Storm Horn Mountains of Cormyr in the 14 century DR.\nArelin Starbrow was married to Morudel of Marsember, with whom she sired several children, including a fellow Roadwarden Guard – heroic Vidruand, and the problem child and a notorious vandal Dazmilar.\nBy the early 1360s DR, Arelin Starbrow was a renowned hero of Skull Crag and a beloved Roadwarden. Locals often shared tales of Arelins and her son, Vidruands heroics. Her career and life ended when she and the Chief of the Roadwarden Guard, Sir Dutiocs, were ambushed by monsters of an encroaching horde. Sir Dutiocs rushed back to the Skull Crag Keep with Arelins body, leaving behind the symbol of the office she wielded in battle – the Arms of the Roadwarden.\nSome time later, a rakshasa who forged an alliance between ogres and oni mages of the Storm Horns took on Arelin Starbrows guise to trick adventurers and their companion Arderiel. However, the ruse failed and Arelins memory remained untainted."
