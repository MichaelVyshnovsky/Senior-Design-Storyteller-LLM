"Lady" Alyth Elendara was the Elfsong Tavern bartender and owner during the 14 century DR.
Lady Alyth was charming and charismatic she was widely praised for her stew and patrons of the Elfsong, who would gladly aid her if she was threatened.
She believed that her tavern was a refuge for the less recognized civilians of Baldurs Gate. These patrons were willing to defend themselves with their blades, if necessary, and stood against thievery. Alyth noted that this rule was as successful as it was not. Lady Elendara, though not the bartender, was happy to sell a variety of beverages to customers.
As of 1366 DR - 1368 DR, the female half-elf owned this well known tavern in Baldurs Gate. She bought the establishment for 50,000 gp from its previous owner, an aged warrior. 
In 1419 DR, she had a son named Alan. After a few decades she passed down proprietorship of the Elfsong to him, along with the family money-lending business.
