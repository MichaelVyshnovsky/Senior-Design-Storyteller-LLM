'''Gratus''' was a male [[human]] living in [[Scardale]] before and during the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Gratus was originally the Minister of Propaganda in the regime of Lord [[Lashan Aumersair]]. When his lord was defeated, he surrendered to the allied forces and for this was not prosecuted like his fellow members of Lashan's government.

Gratus later become a shoemaker but had some dealings with the underworld of Scardale and knew well the thief [[Varden]].

When the god [[Bane]], after the [[Battle of Shadowdale]], ordered the [[Zhentilar]] armies to conquer Scardale to use it to then threaten [[Tantras]], Gratus became a leader in the [[Sembian Resistance]], composed of all the forces in the dale fighting the [[Zhent]]s. When Varden returned from a mission with the heroes [[Midnight]] and [[Adon]], Gratus came to believe that they could cause havoc for Bane, so he offered the help of the Resistance to the heroes.{{cite book/Tantras|145-217}}
