        "mainbody": "'''Morwen Daggerford''' was the sister of the duke of [[Daggerford]] around [[1485 DR]]",
        "Activities": "Morwen usually trained with the militia and paid regular visits to the shrine of [[Tempus]]. She was the Master of Arms of the duchy and the military commander of the castle but many believed her a better duke than [[Maldwyn Daggerford]].",
        "History": "Around [[1486 DR]], Morwen inherited the title from Maldwyn when the practice of primogeniture was suspended in the town of Daggerford. She also joined the [[Lords' Alliance]].\n\nNot long after she began her rule, Lady Morwen was captured by Baroness [[Wynne Cromm]] and placed into the dungeon of [[Cromm's Hold]]. A [[succubus]] named [[Pencheska]], disguised as Lady Morwen, ruled Daggerford in her stead.<ref>",
        "Personality": "On the surface, Morwen was not an amiable person but in truth, she had a noble heart. People believed her to be a more capable leader than Maldwyn and blamed the laws or primogeniture, but Morwen was content with her position."
