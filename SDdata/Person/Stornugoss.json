        "mainbody": "Ghustil '''Stornugoss''' was a [[githyanki]] healer of [[Crèche Y'llek]], on the planet of [[Toril]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''Let the istik with you speak, and I will decide what respect you are owed.''|Ghustil Stornugoss}}",
        "Description": "[[File:Ghustil Stornugoss space science.png|thumb|''Ghustil Stornugoss' examination of an [[illithid]] tadpole.'']]\nStornugoss had geometrically pleasing facial markings and shortly-cut hair. She wore a [[wizard]]'s [[robe]] and a multilayered ocular [[lens]] over her left eye.",
        "Possessions": "Stornugoss owned an ''[[aberration hunters' amulet]]'', that protected her and gave her an advantage in dealing with psionics, intelligence, and mind-affecting magic.",
        "Relationships": "One of Stornugoss' most often seen patients was [[Varrl]], who needed healing at least 47 times in a short period of time. Ghustil suggested [[Sa'varrsh Kethk]] do something on the githyanki who was a great strain on the Crèche's resources.",
        "History": "[[File:Ghustil Stornugoss Zaith'isk.png|thumb|''Ghustil Stornugoss firing zaith'isk up.'']]\nStornugoss, along with other gith of what would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the [[Rosymorn Monastery]] of [[Lathander]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[West Faerûn]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the [[mind flayer]]s in [[Faerûn]] shifted in balance. The gith sought for the ''[[astral prism]]'', the [[artifact]] that imprisoned [[Orpheus]], the long-lost son of [[Gith]]. During that time, Ghustil Stornugoss occupied the Crèche's doctor's office, from whence she performed her experimentation and research into the new illithid threat of the [[Absolute]].\n\nShe also ran the device called ''[[Zaith'isk]]'', which was said to be able to cure [[gith]] of an illithid tadpole infection. Stornugoss was well aware of the fact that ''Zaith'isk'' did not heal but extracted the minds of the infected gith, ending their lives. When a gith became infected, she encouraged them to use the device. If, by some very unlikely circumstance, an infected individual survived the procedure, Stornugoss made an excuse, leaving them in the doctor's chambers, locking the door, meanwhile preparing a cadre of gith warriors to slay the survivors."
