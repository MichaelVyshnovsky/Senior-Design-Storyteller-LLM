'''Gisnervi''' was a renowned [[brass]]worker from the [[City of Brass]] in the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], active before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Gisnervi created a powerful set of [[enchanted]] ''[[Storm armor (City of Brass)|storm armor]]'', intended to be a gift to the son of the City of Brass's sultan. The brassworker's enemies intercepted the armor as it was delivered and placed a ''[[curse]]'' on the gift. Gisnervi was disgraced as the ''curse'' took hold, and the brassworker was banished to the [[Prime Material plane]]. Eventually, Gisnervi befriended a blacksmith from the city of [[Neverwinter]], [[Samir]]. He was able to break the curse placed upon the ''storm armor'', restoring Gisnervi's honor.
