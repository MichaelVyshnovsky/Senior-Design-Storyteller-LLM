Rhykdeq was an enterprising ixzan merchant in Sloopdilmonpolop in 1370 DR.
Rhykdeq regularly ferried goods up and down the Deepdrain. His nickname derived from the fact that Rhykdeq used brown mold and spells to freeze his cargo into slow-melting cylindrical blocks of ice, to make it easier to transport.
