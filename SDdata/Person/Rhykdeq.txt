'''Rhykdeq''' was an enterprising [[ixzan]] merchant in [[Sloopdilmonpolop]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Rhykdeq regularly ferried goods up and down the [[Deepdrain]]. His nickname derived from the fact that Rhykdeq used brown mold and spells to freeze his cargo into slow-melting cylindrical blocks of ice, to make it easier to transport.
