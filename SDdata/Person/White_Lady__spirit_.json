        "mainbody": "The '''White Lady''' was the [[spirit]] of a deceased woman that appeared over [[Lac Dinneshere]] While she was treated as something of a tourist attraction by some in the town of [[Easthaven]], the White Lady possessed a dark and malevolent nature.\n\n{{Quote|We live in dark times. Perhaps the spirit of the White Lady can help. Aren't you curious to hear what she has to say?|The self-styled [[bard]] [[Rinaldo]], to a group of adventurers.}}",
        "Description": "When she manifested in her physical form, the White Lady appeared as a thin and gaunt woman with long white hair. Anyone that came close enough to her spectrak would evoke her visage, that of a malevolent grinning skull.",
        "Abilities": "The spirit of the White Lady could be evoked by the performance of a séance.\n\nIf the White Lady's incorporeal form were destroyed, her spirit would merely return to Lac Dinneshere.",
        "Activities": "[[File:Rinaldo seance.jpg|thumb|280px|''Rinaldo contacting the spirit of the White Lady.'']]\nThe White Lady could later appear before those that were present at a séance that summoned her. On these occasions the White Lady attempted to possess these individuals and force them to drown themselves within the icy waters of her lake.\n\nWhile she rarely appeared on land, the White Lady was known to take the form of a woman taken captive within the [[Easthaven Town Hall]]. She would pose as an innocent victim bound to a ship's figurehead, one carved from [[chardalyn]] in the form of a [[demon]].",
        "History": "It was said that the White Lady was once a mortal woman married to a notoriously stingy man that perished in the waters of Lac Dinneshere. Both her husband and all his accumulated wealth sunk to the bottom of the Lac Dinneshere when his boat capsized upon its waters. The White Lady had no memories about her death or that of her beloved.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the self-styled [[bard]] [[Rinaldo]] who frequented the White Lady Inn offered communion with the [[specter|spectral]] form of the White Lady. He drew in adventurers to regale them with her story and offer hope that she could answer any questions troubling them.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Legends of the White Lady were well-known in the town of Easthaven."
