        "mainbody": "'''Labrand''', also known as '''Larbrand,''' was a [[Halruaan]] [[wizard]] who performed a peculiar feat beneath [[Thindol]].{{Cite dragon/257/Wyrms of the North: Valamaradace}}{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Valamaradace, \"the Dragon Queen\"}}",
        "History": "In [[336 DR]], after acquiring a powerful [[artifact]] called the [[Crown of the Mountain]], Labrand used the Crown's power to tunnel beneath Thindol, connecting [[Cape Talath]] with the [[Thingulph]] via a massive subterranean waterway. Some speculated that Labrand hoped to create a shortcut for trade without the need to sail around the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. However, Labrand's addition of air vents leading to the surface at random intervals along the passage ensured that raging current flowed through the underground passage, making it impossible for ships to safely sail through. This passage would later be known as [[Labrand's Folly]]."
