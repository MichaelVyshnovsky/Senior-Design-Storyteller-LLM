'''Hezza''' was a pawnbroker of [[Lyrabar]]. He had a shop in [[Lutemaker Street]]. In {{yearlink|1373}}, the spy [[Gorstag Helder]] stole an [[emerald]] pendant from him on the night of [[Hammer 16]] for the [[Cult of the Dragon]], under the orders of the local Wearer of Purple, [[Cylla Morieth]]. After he found the emerald in a strongbox, Hezza surprised him; though the thief claimed to work on behalf of the [[Harpers]], Hezza was indifferent. Gorstag knocked him out during their fight and then ran away.{{cite book/The Rage||2}}

Hezza was a barrel-chested man with tufts of curly brown hair sticking every which way, or at least when he was woken up at night. He wielded a [[falchion]].
