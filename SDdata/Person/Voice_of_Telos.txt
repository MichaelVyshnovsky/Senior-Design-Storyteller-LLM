The '''Voice of Telos''' was the mysterious political and religious leader of the [[Warlock Knights]] who ruled [[Vaasa]] in all but name in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|79}}

==Description==
The Voice was careful to make sure that no one was able to discern their appearance, race or gender. They were only seen while wearing long, plain robes, and only communicated via [[telepathy]] with their subjects in order to hide their voice.

In truth, the Voice of Telos was a male human of [[evil]] alignment who had lived to be unnaturally old.

==Activities==
The Voice ruled the Warlock Knights as the leader and thirteenth member of the [[Ironfell Council]], and all Warlock Knights bowed to his authority. and the Voice called for the Knights to heed the entity's unconscious thoughts and dreams.

The Voice also led the [[Luminaries]], a sect of hand-chosen [[warlock]]s who served as the equivalent of [[priest]]s of Telos.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}}

Incurring the Voice's wrath&mdash;such as by slaying a Knight-Vindicator&mdash;might prompt a decree that the offender was to be killed on sight and then delivered to the Voice to be eternally encased in an ''[[ironfell]]'' [[coffin]]. Such a decree led to every Knight and [[shardsoul]] in Vaasa being made aware of the offender's identity and appearance.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Perilous Bastion|29,31}}

==History==
The Voice rose to power after being the first one to discover the [[primordial]] [[Telos]] lying in the crater created when it fell from the sky during the [[Spellplague]]. With the power gained from that encounter, the Voice founded and organized the Warlock Knights of Vaasa, and soon took control of the entire realm. As of the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, the Voice was the eldest of the Warlock Knights and wielded power equivalent to that of a king. The only member of the Ironfell Council who openly questioned the Voice's authority was [[Mansard Kanaoth]], although even he dared not do so in public.
