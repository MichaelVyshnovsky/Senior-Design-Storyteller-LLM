Sulimra, nicknamed the Dark Rose, was a medicine maker who settled in the town of Hultail in Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
Sulimra was a young and beautiful woman with black hair, dusky skin, and huge brown eyes.
By the late 15 century DR, Sulimra relocated from her home in Turmish and rented out two back rooms from Widow Trawny, whose home was located on the southern outskirts of Hultail in Cormyr. Even though she was a recent transplant to the port town, Sulimra made a name for herself by growing herbs and mixing medicines for the locals, as well for her command of art and painted portraits.
