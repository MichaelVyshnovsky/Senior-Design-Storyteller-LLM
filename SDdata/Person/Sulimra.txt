'''Sulimra''', nicknamed '''the Dark Rose''', was a medicine maker who settled in the town of [[Hultail]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Sulimra was a young and beautiful woman with black hair, dusky skin, and huge brown eyes.

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Sulimra relocated from her home in [[Turmish]] and rented out two back rooms from Widow [[Trawny]], whose home was located on the southern outskirts of Hultail in Cormyr. Even though she was a recent transplant to the port town, Sulimra made a name for herself by growing [[herb]]s and mixing medicines for the locals, as well for her command of art and painted portraits.
