        "mainbody": "'''Garlow''' was a lifelong servant and an attendant who worked for the owner of a large townhome in [[Baldur's Gate]] and eventually inherited it sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''After all, there's no point in denying the undeniable, which, until that moment, I had obscured with the million minor tasks by which I measured my life. Yes, the polishing, the scrubbing, the pouring of wine and tea and deference into my master's cup - all of it had surrounded and obscured the essential truth of my life, like a phalanx now fallen. I had wasted my years, one by one, and now there were hardly any left to me at all.''|Garlow's \"inklings\" put to [[paper]].}}",
        "History": "Garlow spent most of his life working in his master's home in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]. His lifelong service was rewarded with the master died. Garlow inherited the entire mansion. Despite the inheritance, Garlow found himself consumed by the regret of a life wasted. He penned a journal he simply called \"Inklings\" and made a bucket list for his own retirement: to climb a [[tree]], have a truly exceptional [[sandwich]], spend day just reading, visit the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]], get a massage, go for a swim in the [[River Chionthar]], buy a new coat, and lastly, get a [[cat]]. Later, Garlow decided to leave the manse behind and leave for [[Calimshan]] to spend the rest of his life traveling from there. He left a kind letter to whoever would claim \"Old Garlow's Place,\" asking them to take care of the place that was his entire life. However, the place was not cared for; it remained abandoned in the {{YearlinkName|1492}} when it was inspected by [[Ardent Low]], the [[Council of Four]] Liaison, who proclaimed it to be in gross violation of the city by-laws 38a-39c and condemned in accordance with by-law 42a. Liaison Low left a notice on Garlow's home, and recommended the owner to contact the local [[Builders' Guild (Baldur's Gate)|Builder's Guild]] representative in regards of immediate repairs."
