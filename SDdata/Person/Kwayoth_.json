        "mainbody": "'''Kwayothé''' ({{Pronounce|kway|OH|thay|refs=}}) was a [[Merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant prince]] in [[Port Nyanzaru]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She dealt in [[fruit]]; libations such as [[wine]], [[ale]] and [[tej]]; and goods that aided with life in the jungle, such as [[oil]], [[perfume]], and [[insect repellent]].\n\n{{Quote|It's a simple thing I ask, yet its consequences are complex and far‐reaching|Kwayothé{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|7}}}}",
        "Description": "She was a beautiful [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] woman{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|18}} who dressed in fine [[silk]]s and [[feather]]s.",
        "Personality": "Kwayothé was a thoughtful but sadistic individual who was fond of torture. Her demeanor was so calm as to be vaguely menacing,{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|21}}  She was unafraid to use her beauty and her wiles to manipulate others. although she herself was the type to communicate with her servants with a mere snap of her fingers.\n\nShe worshiped [[Kossuth]], the [[god]] of fire. As such, she preferred to use hot [[coal]]s for torture.",
        "Activities": "As a merchant prince, Kwayothé was involved in the governing of Port Nyanzaru from the palace of [[Goldenthrone]]. Her monopoly over a wide array of goods meant that anyone wishing to buy or sell such goods within the city had to go through her or her intermediaries.",
        "Possessions": "She owned a lavish and airy villa located on the lower slopes of [[Throne Hill]] in Port Nyanzaru's [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]]. This was both an opulent mansion and a veritable fortress, with defenses and mercenary guards in place to deter intruders. Kwayothé decorated her home with [[bowl]]s of fresh fruit and her servants kept it well-lit with [[oil lamp]]s and [[brazier]]s (in honor of Kossuth). The whole villa was filled with the overwhelming smells of perfume and fruit.\n\nKwayothé always wore a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Kwayothé maintained relations with both male and female consorts who doubled as her bodyguards and were well-trained in unarmed combat.\n\nShe maintained a network of [[spies]] who provided her with valuable information. and was unafraid to wield them in service of her personal agenda. \n\nShe was one of seven merchant princes in Port Nyanzauru,\n\nShe was on good terms with [[Alastar Bol]], the ranking member of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] in her city.",
        "History": "Kwayothé grew up within and spent much of her life in Port Nyanzaru. While she was very poor in her youth, she became quite wealthy in adulthood. Her destitute upbringing instilled in her a hatred of noble-born individuals.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century DR, she was one of the wealthiest individuals in all of Port Nyanzaru, and had many suitors who gave her gifts. This included one [[yuan-ti]] agent who gave her a piece of the ''[[Dreamer's Amulet]]''.\n\nAt some point in the late 15{{th}} century DR, it was brought to Kwayothé's attention by the Ytepka Society that a man named [[Omala]] had purchased [[dancing monkey fruit]] through black market channels. Her preferred means of punishing him was to send him through [[Executioner's Run]].\n\nWhen the fiendish pirate [[Idrianne Smoke]] attacked Port Nyanzaru during the events of the [[death curse]].{{ToA-time}} Kwayothé sought to strike a bargain with the [[Port_Nyanzaru/Old_City#Government|beggar prince]] [[Pock-Marked Po]] to enlist his [[thieves]] into service alongside her mercenaries.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|22}}"
