'''"Thessaly Malaeda"''' was the assumed name of a [[succubus]] agent of the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Hillsfar Reclaimed|5,9}}

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], the succubus posed as Thessaly Malaeda, the recently arrived sister of [[Davon Malaeda]], the closest advisor of First Lord [[Torin Nomerthal]] (in truth, Davon had been replaced by the [[incubus]] [[Ruexohn]]). Thessaly seduced Nomerthal and Ruexohn convinced him that he needed to marry Thessaly. So the First Lord organized the First Lord's [[Midsummer Masquerade]] ball in order to announce his marriage to all the wealthiest citizens of Hillsfar.

As planned, at this point an [[elf]] assassin (in truth, a [[fiendish]] [[doppelganger]]) ruined the announcement of the marriage by attacking Thessaly. Ruexohn and Thessaly prepared to escape but an adventuring party hired by [[Elanil Elassidil]] to gather intelligence about Hillsfar unveiled them and fought and killed them.{{Cite adventurers league/Hillsfar Reclaimed|18-19}}
