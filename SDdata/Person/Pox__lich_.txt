Pox was a female lich and a leader of the Cult of the Dragon cell in Yartar in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Pox hated everyone from Zhentil Keep and the Zhentarim. She had a close bond with Saurglyce. She observed from afar the founding of Luruar, planning future plots against it.
In the past, Pox appeared to have had some bad dealings with Zhentil Keep and the Zhentarim.
She claimed to have become a lich using a copy of the Tome of the Dragon, but this claim was suspect as the other copies of the tome described only the process to create a dracolich. What was known was that one day Pox arrived in Yartar riding the white dragon dracolich Saurglyce, her partner. They began to gather followers to establish a Cult cell in the city.
In the , after the Rage of Dragons, the drow-dragon Nurvureem aided Cult rebels to drive Pox and Saurglyce out of Yartar.
