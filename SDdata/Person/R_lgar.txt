'''Rûlgar''' was an [[orc]] [[ranger]] and [[rogue]] in [[Thar]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].
 
==History==
Around [[1369 DR]], Rûlgar went with his sister [[Jurrg]] to the [[Xûl-Jarak]] citadel in search of a fabled orc leader that Jurrg had seen in a dream sent by [[Gruumsh]]. There they met three just-arrived [[orog]]s: [[Naazlog]], [[Daazlag]], and their leader [[Thrull]]. Jurrg proclaimed them "sons of Gruumsh" and Thrull the new king of Thar. Together they started to build a new orc kingdom.

Around [[1374 DR]], Rûlgar found the ''[[Hammer of Gruumsh]]'' in a cave in the [[Galena Mountains]] and Jurrg saw this as a sign that the time of Thrull's rule was near. Meanwhile, thanks to Daazlag, the orcs captured the scions of five powerful noble houses of [[Melvaunt]]. Jurrg planned to ritually sacrifice them in a crowning ceremony for Thrull.

When adventurers came in search of the scions, Rûlgar was in the temple to Gruumsh inside Xûl-Jarak together with Thrull and four orc warriors, waiting for the start of the ceremony to proclaim Thrull king of all Thar.
