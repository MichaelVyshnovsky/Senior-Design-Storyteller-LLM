'''King Rogdok''' was a [[hobgoblin]] ruler that took over a small band of [[goblin]]s in the [[Cloud Peaks]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
While Rogdok's goblins considered him their king, he saw them in much less favorable terms.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, a tribe of goblins came to worship a [[wild mage]] by the name of [[Adoy]], who they believed was [[Bargrivyek]] the [[goblinoid]] deity of cooperation and territory. Curious as to why a large number of goblins appeared so suddenly, Rogdok went to investigate.

Seeing an opportunity, Rogdok imprisoned Adoy and used his control over the goblinoid "deity" to appoint himself as the king of the tribe.

At some point he and his hobgoblins killed a local [[ranger]] by the name of [[Rilsa]].
