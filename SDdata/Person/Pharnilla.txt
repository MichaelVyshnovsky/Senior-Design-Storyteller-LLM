In the , during the Absolute crisis, Pharnilla could often be found peddling the Baldurs Mouth Gazette across the street from Beehive Goods and Wares in the Lower City alongside Dellys, with whom Pharnilla took breaks. He didnt like taking breaks, thinking them boring and lamented not being able to read his own stock to pass the time.
