Doctor Braum was a medical doctor of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Doctor Braum treated the people of Ghars his skills were adequate, but not great. For a second opinion, people went to the retired War Wizard Benelaius behind Braums back Benelaius thought Braum to be a good man and didnt want to offend him by letting this be known. One difficult patient was Mayor Tobald. Braum found nothing wrong with him save his gout and advised him to eat less. Naturally, Tobald thought this absurd and claimed Braum "couldnt cure a nosebleed with a wagon load of cotton".
Braum made house calls.
When the beheaded body of blacksmiths assistant Dovo was found dead on the morning of Eleint 17, the , Doctor Braum was among those summoned to the crime scene. Although shocked by the grisly sight, Braum maintained his professionalism and was the first to identify the broken glass as coming from a lantern. and tried to ascertain how the killing blow was made (but turned out to be mistaken).
