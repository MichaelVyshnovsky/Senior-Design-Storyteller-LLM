'''Luthvaerynn''' was a possibly female [[malaugrym]] in [[1479 DR]] in [[Telflamm]].

It was involved in both licit and illicit businesses in that city using trade and the black market. All of its identities were female and it liked the [[humanoid]] form more than its original form, and maintained it even when threatened.{{Cite dungeon/206/Ecology of the Malaugrym|1-6}}
