'''Husam al-Jana''' was a [[winged cat]] who lived in the [[Royal Harim of Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Husam prowled the halls of the harem searching for intruders. He was rarely seen by others. Sometimes he could be glimpsed napping in the harem courtyard.

==Relationships==
He adopted one of the [[Grand Caliph]]'s wives, [[Halima]], as his own.

==Rumors and Legends==
Rumor stated that this creature was once a man who lost a wager to the Grand Caliph.

==History==
Years before, an adventurer named '''Husam bin Waleed''' came to the Grand Caliph with a proposal: he would bring the Grand Caliph one of the famed winged cats ([[jana-nimr]]) if he would be allowed to marry a woman from the Royal Harim. Intrigued, [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]] brought Husam to view the women of his harem. An [[elf|elven]] beauty named Halima stood out above the rest, and Husam selected her. Khalil agreed to the bargain and Husam left in search of the jana-nimar. After finally locating a group of the elusive cats, Husam was accosted by a much larger jana-nimar, who actually spoke to him. Husam tried to lie his way out of the situation but the large cat saw right through the deceit and transformed Husam into a winged cat.

Husam eventually returned to the Royal Harim. Khalil was pleased because he believed he was finally in possession of a rare jana-nimar. Halima recognized that the cat had the same exact earring that Husam wore. Khalil realized what happened and was pleased because he got what he wanted without having to break his word. Husam remained close with Halima every day after that.
