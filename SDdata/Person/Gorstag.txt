'''Gorstag''' of [[Highmoon]] was an adventurer in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], and the innkeeper of the [[The Rising Moon (inn)|The Rising Moon]] inn in [[Deepingdale]] since. He was the foster father of [[Shandril Shessair]].

==Personality==
Gorstag loved night snacks, and strong cheeses.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|36|2}} He had many tales to tell of Deepingdale's early days and his own adventuring exploits both.
==Description==
He had kind, jovial eyes.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|121|7}}

==Abilities==
He favored the battle-ax. Even in his later years, he was handy with the axe and kept the peace in the inn.

==Activities==
Gorstag was the innkeeper in [[The Rising Moon (inn)|the Rising Moon]] from around {{yearlink|1341}} for at least close to 30 years.

==Relationships==
Gorstag married [[Lureene]], one of his employees. Other employees of his' included [[Shandril Shessair]], his adoptive daughter whom he tried to provide with a normal life, the late cook [[Korvan]], and [[Rhiia Duskmantle]], who later replaced Korvan.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|118|6}} He had adventured with [[Dammasae]].

==Possessions==
Gorstag was the owner of the Rising Moon inn.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|298|20}} At the end of his adventuring career, he owned some gems.{{cite book/Hall of Heroes|47}}

Gorstag had an amulet that blocked several forms of detection, almost certainly an ''[[Amulet of proof against detection and location]]'', taken from a [[necromancer]] he had slain.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|371-373|20}} He also owned a ''[[Luck medallion of Tymora]]''.

==History==
===Adventuring (to 1341 DR)===
{{quote|''Save your breath for running.''|Gorstag, on fighting [[undead]].}}

Gorstag had adventured together with Dammasae.{{cite book/Cult of the Dragon|59}} He described adventuring pains as forgettable.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|34|2}}

After Dammasae gave birth to her daughter Shandril in Elturel, she remained there for eight months before departing for Shadowdale. Gorstag accompanied the family in the trip, but the group was ambushed at the [[Bridge of Fallen Men]]. Garthond died; Dammasae and Gorstag were both heavily injured, and though he sought healing at [[High Horn]], it was too late to save Dammasae.{{cite book/Heroes' Lorebook|111-112}} He and the infant Shandril were ultimately the only survivors. The responsibility of hiding her fell squarely on him. Gorstag took the baby to [[Deepingdale]], hoping to leave her with the elves and make for the [[Tower Tranquil]], where he'd loot Garthond's belongings for Shandril to have; the elves warned him the Tower was now a Cult redoubt, annexed into the lair of [[Rauglothgor]]. Instead, he bought an old inn, once belonging to his father, counting on his relative obscurity to hide him from the Cult.


===Innkeeping (from 1341 DR)===
{{quote|''More treasure? What're you gonna do with it all, lad? Eat it? Build another castle? Well, that'll be nice. Make this one pink, will ye?|Gorstag of [[Highmoon]], said to [[Theremen Ulath]], {{yearlinkName|1365}}{{Cite polyhedron/92/The Everwinking Eye: Treasures of the Vast, Part Four}}}}

While in the position of innkeeper and Shandril's tutor, Gorstag had once taken on Shandril on the bet she could not consume a great blandreth of soup by herself.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|42|3}} He taught Shandril of innkeeping trade.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|87|5}}

In [[Mirtul 6]] of the {{YearlinkName|1357}},{{cite book/The Forgotten Realms Atlas|105}} Gorstag broke a fight when the visiting [[Company of the Bright Spear]] lost its thief, [[Lynxal]], slain while pickpocketing a local man, [[Ghondarrath]].{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|15-17|1}} The next morning, Shandril ran off with the Company of the Bright Blade, leaving a note behind.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|20|2}} Per [[Elminster]], Gorstag was quite pained by that.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|116|6}}  During that time, one of his maids, [[Lureene]], became close to him, hoping to ease his pain.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|357-358|20}} Gorstag spoke at length with Narm during that evening, learning of Shandril's foes, and explained at length what he knew of her parents.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|361-367|20}} He offered Shandril an amulet protecting against detection and location, which she accepted.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|60|3}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|367-368|16}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|378-379|21}}

However, his cook, Korvan, was a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], and informed on Shandril's arrival; Gorstag had to slay the man, just as the newlyweds had left the inn.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|381-386|21}} He later fought off and slew [[Sintre]], a [[Malaugrym]] impersonating a priestess of [[Oghma]].{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|370-373|16}} The events took place over the next day, [[Flamerule 9]].

Unknown to him, Shandril later briefly scried on him while he was together with Lureene, to no greater consequence, at some point before her next contact:{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|257|15}} He received another contact from her later that month, close to or on [[Flamerule 22]],{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/The Hooded One (2004)/09-11 - Spellfire Timeline}} after Shandril destroyed the [[Wizards' Tower]] in the [[Citadel of the Raven]], learning that Shandril was with child.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|333|Epilogue}} After Shandril's immolation and death on [[Flamerule 27]],{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|376|Epilogue}}

Decades later, Gorstag was considering expanding the inn. By that point he studiously avoided saying anything about Shandril; recently, a secret shaft was discovered beneath his establishment.

==Rumors & Legends==
Gorstag told that the ''amulet of proof against detection and location'' he kept was pilfered from an evil necromancer, whose brother was beat to death by an 8-year old armed who drew him out of his tower by throwing rocks at the window. He didn't elaborate.

Some rumors flew that Gorstag may have been Shandril's father.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|230-235|13}}

Per [[Volothamp Geddarm]], Gorstag said he had met the Deeping Princess, but he wasn't anywhere near old enough for that. Also according to Volo, someone had rented the hidden space recently discovered beneath the inn, but Gorstag would not say who.
