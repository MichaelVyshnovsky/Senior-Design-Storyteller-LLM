Eloem Elchantragar was a merchant in the city of Delzimmer in southeast Faer√ªn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. He dealt in ceramics and pottery, specializing in importing luxury items from Amn, Sembia, and Tethyr.
Eloem was a hard-working and energetic man.
Eloem owned a pottery import business and a large house or a small mansion in Delzimmer.
In the 1370s DR, a wave of ethrael fraud was plaguing the well-to-do in Delzimmer. Ethrael was the Delzemaeran system of deeding, registration, and insurance for goods and property. Eloem was a successful merchant whose fortunes were on the rise, and one of many victims whose ethrael was either forged or stolen and sold to a rich and gullible outlander in a distant land.
Late one night, the Elchantragar household was alarmed to find fifty armed retainers breaking into the domicile and demanding they vacate the premises that were allegedly owned by Ildel Morusk, a wealthy stonecarver from Selgaunt. Altercations broke out and some blood was spilled before Eloem, his neighbors, and some quickly hired mercenaries managed to stem the rather violent capture and eviction operation until the nagra (the local law enforcement) showed up to quell the chaos and begin to sort things out.
Morusk was extremely indignant about his supposedly legal purchase of the property but was eventually persuaded to take up temporary residence rent-free in one of the nagra-owned minor mansions seized for payment of civil or criminal fines. Morusk finally relinquished his claim when Elchantragar gave him a sizable sum of money, ostensibly as a commission to hunt down and kill the Sembian conman that had wronged them both. Ildel Morusk and his entourage departed a few days later.
