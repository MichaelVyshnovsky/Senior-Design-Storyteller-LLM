'''Zehla''' was the proprietor of the [[Hungry Man]] inn of [[Cormyr]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|In case you have forgotten, blood has never been spilled in my establishment. While I'm alive, it never will be.}}

==Personality==
She was a caring and compassionate elderly woman that went out of her way to help others, especially those in need.

==Possessions==
Zehla kept a small cache of ''[[healing potion]]s'' in the back room of her establishment, in case of emergencies.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Zehla helped a friendly acquaintance of hers, a guardsman by the name of [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]], by providing care for his suddenly-ill employer, [[Caitlan Moonsong]]. She provided aide to the teenage girl, along with a bed to rest for the night. As Caitlan recovered the following morning, Zehla took her side during a disagreement with Kelemvor and convinced the grizzled mercenary to take on the [[magic-user]] [[Midnight]] along on their journey beyond Arabel.

Later, [[Myrmeen Lhal]] thoroughly questioned Zehla about her connection to Kelemvor Lyonsbane, and surprisingly the two women became friends. The Lady Lord was known to visit the Hungry Man Inn without her bodyguards.
