'''The Rook Widow''' was a witch who was said to have known the the secrets of the last [[Shoon Dynasty|Shoon Emperor]], [[Amahl Shoon VII]], so she was exiled to [[Pelath's Isle|the Rookery]] in the [[Nelanther Isles]], where she made her home. Her cause of death was unknown but as of [[1370 DR]] she still walked on the island as a [[ghost]].
