Crelt was a blind gnomish clairsentient.
Crelt had white hair and a thick, yet groomed white beard. A stern expression was etched on his light-skinned face. He wore leather armor and carried a club.
He was a pleasant individual, but had a dislike for too-helpful people, feeling he could do fine on his own. Crelt took his training as a psionicist very seriously.
Although he frequently employed his psionic abilities, he was still a generally competent person without them.
He owned a suit of leather armor +3, a club +2, as well as a ring of invisibility.
Crelt was born blind, and did not venture into the larger world before reaching middle age.
