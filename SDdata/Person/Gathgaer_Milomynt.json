        "mainbody": "Gathgaer Milomynt was a cleric of Shar in the Dark Army of the Night and a slaver in Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nGathgaer posed as a healer and seller of medicines and other treatments,\nIn fact, he was a slaver who kidnapped people of no importance or power, There, he sent them through a two-way keyed portal within an iron maiden in his house that led to a sarcophagus in the second level of Undermountain.\nHe had a beak-like nose, brown eyes that were beady but alert, and brown hair he kept cut short. He habitually wore dark robes and carried a mace on his belt.\nGathgaer appeared to have plain and simple tastes and comforts.\nOn Drawn Sword Alley in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep, he lived in a dilapidated two-story row-house.\nFrom the parlor, a door led to the back room with the bricked-up, unused corner fireplace with shared brick chimney. Gathgaer used this area for work and storage, and it had a big table a cabinet containing bottles and flasks of medicine, possibility even potions and crates of simple foodstuffs, with cheese wheels, round loaves of hard bread, and bottles of sherry, in keeping with Gathgaers simple tastes. There was also a long rack for hanging both clothes and sausages long one wall, and behind it was an iron maiden, with door left open to show the spikes inside. In fact, these were illusory and the interior was a portalâ€”once the door was shut, anyone inside was spirited away to the sarcophagus in Undermountain.\nAdjoining this room, beside the stairs, were jakes and a washroom. The ordinary wooden stairs connected to the second story, used as a basic living area. The bedroom had a rickety four-poster bed Gathgaer kept his coins hidden in a hollow bedpost. He kept his main wealth stashed inside the chimney, in a sack hanging down the lower part and able to pulled up by lifting the hearthstones on the upper-floor fireplace. It held gold coins and silver trade bar totaling over 850 gp.\nThe Undermountain chamber holding the sarcophagus had plenty of rope and wall-mounted rings for binding captives to await collection. Upon arrival, a dozen crawling claws under Gathgaers control would grab them and drag them out of the sarcophagus. To return via the portal, one required a command word known only to Gathgaer (ondreth).\nAs well as his mace, Gathgaer had a ring of protection +2 and a ring of free action, as well as an eye of winking (command word gulruu). But the key to his kidnapping was a steel needle concealed his belt buckle and coated in a sticky, clear poison that caused deep sleep on contact Gathgaer was not himself immune. The poison he kept stashed in a secret compartment behind a loose stone in the chimney of his house, accessed via the back room.\nBeing a cleric, Gathgaer commanded divine magic, preparing various common spells and whip of Shar."
