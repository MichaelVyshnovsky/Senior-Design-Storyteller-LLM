        "mainbody": "'''Gathgaer Milomynt''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Shar]] in the [[Dark Army of the Night]] and a slaver in [[Waterdeep]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Gathgaer posed as a healer and seller of [[:Category:Medicines|medicines]] and other treatments,\n\nIn fact, he was a slaver who kidnapped people of no importance or power, There, he sent them through a two-way keyed ''[[portal]]'' within an [[iron maiden]] in his house that led to a sarcophagus in the second level of [[Undermountain]].",
        "Description": "He had a beak-like nose, brown eyes that were beady but alert, and brown hair he kept cut short. He habitually wore dark [[robe]]s and carried a [[mace]] on his [[belts|belt]].",
        "Personality": "Gathgaer appeared to have plain and simple tastes and comforts.",
        "Home": "On [[Drawn Sword Alley]] in the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep]], he lived in [[Gathgaer Milomynt's residence|a dilapidated two-story row-house]].\n\nFrom the parlor, a door led to the back room with the bricked-up, unused corner fireplace with shared brick chimney. Gathgaer used this area for work and storage, and it had a big table; a cabinet containing bottles and flasks of medicine, possibility even [[potion]]s; and crates of simple foodstuffs, with [[cheese]] wheels, round loaves of hard [[bread]], and bottles of [[sherry]], in keeping with Gathgaer's simple tastes. There was also a long rack for hanging both clothes and [[sausage]]s long one wall, and behind it was an iron maiden, with door left open to show the spikes inside. In fact, these were illusory and the interior was a ''portal''â€”once the door was shut, anyone inside was spirited away to the sarcophagus in Undermountain.\n\nAdjoining this room, beside the stairs, were jakes and a washroom. The ordinary wooden stairs connected to the second story, used as a basic living area. The bedroom had a rickety four-poster bed; Gathgaer kept his coins hidden in a hollow bedpost. He kept his main wealth stashed inside the chimney, in a sack hanging down the lower part and able to pulled up by lifting the hearthstones on the upper-floor fireplace. It held [[gp|gold coin]]s and [[silver]] [[trade bar]] totaling over 850 [[gp]].\n\nThe Undermountain chamber holding the sarcophagus had plenty of [[rope]] and wall-mounted rings for binding captives to await collection. Upon arrival, a dozen [[crawling claw]]s under Gathgaer's control would grab them and drag them out of the sarcophagus. To return via the ''portal'', one required a command word known only to Gathgaer (''ondreth'').",
        "Possessions": "As well as his mace, Gathgaer had a ''[[ring of protection]] +2'' and a ''[[ring of free action]]'', as well as an ''[[eye of winking]]'' ([[command word]] ''gulruu''). But the key to his kidnapping was a steel needle concealed his belt buckle and coated in a sticky, clear [[poison]] that caused deep sleep on contact; Gathgaer was not himself immune. The poison he kept stashed in a secret compartment behind a loose stone in the chimney of his house, accessed via the back room.",
        "Abilities": "Being a [[cleric]], Gathgaer commanded [[divine magic]], preparing various common [[spells]] and ''[[whip of Shar]]''."
