        "mainbody": "ew Hackinstone was a shield dwarf posing as a jungle guide in Port Nyanzaru during the late 15 century DR.\nHew was missing his left arm as the result of an encounter with the red dragon Tzindelor.\nHe was a bold and confident guide and combatant, and claimed both that he was unafraid of anything and that he had both visited and perfectly remembered \"every\" mountain, gorge, trail, and crevice in Chult.\nHew posed as a jungle guide in Port Nyanzaru, but with the goal of gathering adventurers to take his revenge on Tzindelor. \nHe used his one arm to wield his battleaxe.\nAccording to Hew, he and his kin had once been the operators of Wyrmheart Mine in southwestern Chult until the dragon Tzindelor seized it from them in the midâ€“14 century DR. About 37 years later, Hew was subsequently part of a five-dwarf expedition that sought to reclaim and reopen the Wyrmheart Mine, but unfortunately, Tzindelor ambushed them at the bottom of the mine shaft and burned alive all of Hews companions. The dragon allowed Hew to escape so that his failure could haunt him, but not before she took his arm (and some of his sanity).\nThree years later, at the same time as the death curse struck Toril, Hew was in Port Nyanzaru making promises that he could lead expeditions anywhere they wanted in Chult, but actually planning to find a party of brave adventurers and lead them only to Wyrmheart Mine. \nBy the time the death curse had ended, Hew had found his way alone to Shilku Bay (not far from the mines) where he encountered a party of champions from the Sword Coast. After asking them honestly to help him slay the dragon and reclaim the mine, the champions agreed to aid him. They battled through Tzindelors kobold minions, first seizing the mines forge and then slaying the dragon."
