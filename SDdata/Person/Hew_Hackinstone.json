About 37 years later, Hew was subsequently part of a five-dwarf expedition that sought to reclaim and reopen the Wyrmheart Mine, but unfortunately, Tzindelor ambushed them at the bottom of the mine shaft and burned alive all of Hew's companions. The dragon allowed Hew to escape so that his failure could haunt him, but not before she took his arm (and some of his sanity).\n\nThree years later, at the same time as the [[death curse]] struck [[Toril]],{{ToA-time}} Hew was in Port Nyanzaru making promises that he could lead expeditions anywhere they wanted in Chult, but actually planning to find a party of brave adventurers and lead them only to Wyrmheart Mine. \n\n{{Fq\n| text = Once the forge is lit, one dwarf can hold this place against many.\n| source = Hew Hackinstone\n}}\nBy the time the death curse had ended, Hew had found his way alone to [[Shilku Bay]] (not far from the mines) where he encountered a party of champions from the [[Sword Coast]].
