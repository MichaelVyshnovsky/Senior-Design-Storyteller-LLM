'''Asanta''' was a [[human]] woman living in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. She was one of the proprietors of the [[Wyvern Watch Inn]].

==Relationships==
Asanta was the daughter of [[Buldegas Mhaerkoon]], and sister to [[Baerill]]. They chatted constantly and had noisy arguments.

==History==
Buldegas Mhaerkoon was the long-time owner of the Wyvern Watch Inn, but following the devastation of the neighboring city of [[Arabel]] during the [[Goblin War]] in [[1370 DR]], Buldegas chose to relocate there and build a new inn. He took away his money and some of his best employees and left his daughters in charge of the Wyvern.

Asanta and Baerill had recently taken charge by [[1374 DR]]. They conveniently forgot Buldegas's instructions about watering down the drink, and their regular banter and arguing was a popular form of entertainment there. This made the Wyvern more popular with patrons.
