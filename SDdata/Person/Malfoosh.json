        "mainbody": "Malavoselle Amvas Tol was a drow of House Amvas Tol who was turned into an enormous drider called Malfoosh. She was in the service of Zhindia Melarn in the early 15 century DR.\nDuring the foundation of Menzoberranzan, Malavoselle was weapon master to Matron Dunnada Amvas. However, Dunnada proved to be a heretic and her house was destroyed and Matron Yvonnel Baenre turned Malavoselle into a drider. Afterward, she served Lolth in the Abyss.\nIn 1488 DR, after a retriever had presumably killed Drizzt and a demon army advanced through Gauntlgrym and Margaster allies had conquered Luskan and Port Llast, the yochlols Eskavidne and Yiccardaria granted to Zhindia the command of an army of risen driders. Among them, Malfoosh was granted leadership and even the living driders of House Melarn submitted to her sheer power. She reported to Matron Zhindia the progress of their armies.\nMalfoosh led the drider army near Gauntlgrym when they met a drow scouting party. After Malagdorl Armgo nearly tried to attack her, Minolin Fey asked to speak with her and discovered the story of Malavoselle Amvas Tol.\nDuring the final battle between Zhindia and the army of Menzoberranzan, the spells of Quenthel Baenre and Yvonnel Baenre II managed to turn the driders back into drow again, in a miraculous event. Malfoosh became Malavoselle Amvas Tol once more.\nShe remained the leader of the former driders in their march back to Menzoberranzan together with the drow army.\nIn the , she led the Blaspheme, her legion of former driders, in skirmishes against forces loyal to Lolth. Twice she fought against Malagdorl Armgo. The first time she was saved by Dinin DoUrden. The second time, however, it was Malagdorl who killed her in single combat by tearing out her throat with his teeth. Malagdorl considered ending her, but then left her on the ground for a slow death."
