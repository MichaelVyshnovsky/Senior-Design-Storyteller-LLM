        "mainbody": "Dorath Wyvernspur was a dowager matriarch of the Wyvernspur family circa 1358 DR and one of the very few Wyvernspurs able to transform into an actual wyvern when using the familys heirloom, a mummified wyverns spur.\nDorath Wyvernspur was a tall, robust older woman with thin lips and a hawk-like nose, similar to many other members of the Wyvernspur family. She wore her black-streaked-with-grey hair in a tight bun. She had a perfect stiff and proper posture and body language.\nEven though she raised him, she constantly nagged her great-nephew Giogioni Wyvernspur for his clumsy and unlucky mishaps and his adventure-lust that he shared with his long-dead father. The nagging only got worse after he dishonored the family by ruining a wedding celebration while imitating King Azoun Obarskyr IV.\nGiogi thought Dorath to be a horrible gossip and too friendly with King Azouns court wizard, Vangerdahast.\nAt one point, Dorath had a pet land urchin. Due to another one of Giogionis misadventures, it was eaten by a giant snake.\nIn 1357 DR, Dorath was present at the wedding of Gaylyn and Frefford Wyvernspur at the Dimswart Manor outside of Suzail. During the celebration, a sellsword named Alias, being controlled by mysterious forces, attempted assassination of Giogioni. The young nobleman survived the attempt, but, as always, was nagged by Dorath and blamed for the scuffle."
