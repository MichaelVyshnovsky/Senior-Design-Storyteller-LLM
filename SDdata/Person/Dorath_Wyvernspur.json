        "Description": "Dorath Wyvernspur was a tall, robust older woman with thin lips and a hawk-like nose, similar to many other members of the Wyvernspur family. She wore her black-streaked-with-grey hair in a tight bun. She had a perfect stiff and proper posture and body language.\n\n{{fq\n| text   =\nHer black hair, which she wore in a severe bun, was streaked with steel-gray strands. More streaks had appeared, and her squint had grown more pronounced, but, otherwise, time had not touched her much. It wouldn't dare.\n| source = [[Giogioni Wyvernspur]]\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}",
        "Relationships": "Even though she raised him, she constantly nagged her great-nephew [[Giogioni Wyvernspur]] for his clumsy and unlucky mishaps and his adventure-lust that he shared with his long-dead father. The nagging only got worse after he dishonored the family by ruining a wedding celebration while imitating King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]].\n\nGiogi thought Dorath to be a horrible gossip and too friendly with King Azoun's court wizard, [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana|Vangerdahast]].",
        "Possessions": "At one point, Dorath had a pet [[land urchin]]. Due to another one of Giogioni's misadventures, it was eaten by a [[giant snake]].",
        "History": "In [[1357 DR]], Dorath was present at the wedding of [[Gaylyn]] and [[Frefford Wyvernspur]] at the [[Dimswart Manor]] outside of [[Suzail]]. During the celebration, a sellsword named [[Alias]], being controlled by mysterious forces, attempted assassination of Giogioni. The young nobleman survived the attempt, but, as always, was nagged by Dorath and blamed for the scuffle."
