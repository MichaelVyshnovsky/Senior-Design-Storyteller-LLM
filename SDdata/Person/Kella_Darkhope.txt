'''Kella Darkhope''' was a [[Zhentarim]] agent who operated in [[Nightstone]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], some time following the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==Relationships==
The leader of the Seven Snakes [[Xolkin Alassandar]] was in love with Kella, although she did not harbor the same feelings towards him.
==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]] Kella went to Nightstone posing as an itinerant monk. In truth she had originally planned to occupy the village in name of the [[Zhent]], driving away the [[Lionshield Coster]] and bullying Lady [[Velrosa Nandar]]. For this she had recruited the help of the [[Seven Snakes]]. However, a bombardment from a [[cloud giant]] castle left the city almost abandoned and defenseless, changing Kella's plan into just waiting for the arrival of her associates and conquering the city. She remained hidden in the village's tavern while the [[goblin]] raiding the various buildings.
