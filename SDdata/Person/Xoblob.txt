'''Xoblob''' was a [[deep gnome]] shopkeeper in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Xoblob managed the [[Old Xoblob Shop]] in [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]]. He also spied for the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]].

==History==
Xoblob survived the detonation of a [[gas spore]] in the [[Underdark]], which caused him to inherit a few [[beholder]] mannerisms and memories. Driven by a compulsion for power, the deep gnome settled in Waterdeep and bought the Old Xoblob Shop. First he tried to rename the shop after himself but everyone kept calling it the Old Xoblob Shop. So he decided instead to restore the old name and changed his personal name to Xoblob.

A few years after settling in Waterdeep, in [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} Xoblob witnessed the kidnapping of [[Renaer Neverember]] and [[Floon Blagmaar]] by some [[Zhentarim]] agents but was reluctant to speak about it.
