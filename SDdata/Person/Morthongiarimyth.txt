'''Morthongiarimyth''', also known as the '''Starshine Duke''', was a [[dragon]] ruler of [[Abeir]], in the centuries before the [[Spellplague]].

==History==
[[Emycharianatris]] was the owner of [[Nala (ancestor)|Nala]], before the [[dragonborn]] earned her freedom.

One day, Nala, in order to free some dragonborn families from slavery, including her own, used light tricks to scare Morthongiarimyth until he went mad.
