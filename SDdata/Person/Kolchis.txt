Kolchis was a lizardfolk cleric of Tiamat living in Unther in 1374 DR.
Kolchis was a celebrant at the Altar of Scales temple inside Unthalass.
Kolchis grew in the undercity of Unthalass without contact with any of his kin. At one point, he joined the church of Tiamat. 
Kolchis was cruel and twisted. He was loyal to his goddess but like all his fellow lizardfolk he respected only power and always followed the person with the strongest position inside the temple.
