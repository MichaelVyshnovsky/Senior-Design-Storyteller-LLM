'''Panese the Excitable''' was a [[wizard]] who lived in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/58/The Living City: Of Wits and Wizards, A Logic Puzzle|27}}

==Home==
Panese lived in a green two-story house on [[Magician's Row]]. It was the fifth of five houses.

==Description==
Panese had an [[owl]] [[familiar]], smoked Old Troll [[tobacco]], and was primarily a [[coffee]] drinker.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], Panese the Excitable and [[Norweg|Norweg the Magnificent]] separately stole two minor [[magic item]]s of historical importance from the city vaults at approximately the same time. Panese's owl left a feather at one of the vaults. Though the thieves were unidentified, suspicions and [[divination]]s tracked them to Magician's Row. The [[City Guard (Ravens Bluff)|City Guard]] serving Regent of the Exchequer [[Vernon Condor]] only had time to search two of the five houses before they earned their boss's ire, so they tried to deduce the culprits from what they knew of the five wizards in the neighborhood.
