        "mainbody": "Cullen Kordamant was a priest of Oghma at the Domes of Reason in the city of Procampur in the Vast in the midâ€“14 century DR and the Grand Patriarch of the Church of Oghma, a pontiff widely recognized as the \"Voice of Oghma\" on Toril. His disappearance during the Time of Troubles triggered a lasting schism in the church.\nWorshipers of Oghma swore by Kordamants word, and the entire church hierarchy, which was well-organized and established, was dedicated to his service and spirit. However, this all changed during the Time of Troubles, in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, when Kordamant vanished without a trace from his home in Procampur, as did much of his immediate clergy.\nThe disappearance was a subject of much mystery and speculation. Unfortunately, answers from Oghma and other gods were confusing and contradictory, providing no clear solution.\nWith the Oghmyte church left without an ultimate head, the mystery caused a growing split into rival factions, disagreeing along hierarchical and theological lines. In Procampur, the Orthodox Church of Oghma stated that Kordamant had ascended to semi-divinity and was currently serving Oghma and, until he was proven dead or the god named a replacement or commanded otherwise, Kordamant was still the only true Patriarch and they would not recognize any replacement. On the other hand, the Oghmanyte Church in Sembia and the Pursuers of Pure Knowledge in Mintar claimed that a new Patriarch had in fact already been appointed by Oghma himself, and naturally put forward their own competing candidates. This remained unresolved more than a century later. Later, there arose a belief or heresy, depending on the faction, suggesting that Kordamants fate had been concealed by Oghma as a test of faith for his priests, to determine whether they would hold to the quest of discovering and recording knowledge, or if they would fall prey to power struggles and reinterpretations of scripture."
