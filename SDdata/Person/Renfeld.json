        "mainbody": "'''Renfeld''' was a member of the [[Harper]]s who clandestinely operated in the City of Coin, [[Athkatla]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Reward? *groan* I... I have nothing to offer you... aside from my gratitude and those of my friends. Please... I do not have much time...''|Renfeld}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Renfeld was ambushed on the streets of Athkatla. His assailants injected him with fast-acting [[poison]]; luckily, a group of adventurers led by [[Abdel Adrian]] walked in on the attack. However, they were too late to stop the poisoning. Renfeld was unable to move and already had attempted to unsuccessfully ''[[neutralize poison]]''. The man asked the adventurers to bring his dying body to a large building in Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Wave District|Wave District]], the [[Galvarey Estate]], secretly a Harper safehouse. His Harper allies could cure the affliction, but Renfeld needed to be taken there post haste. It was unknown if Abdel Adrian managed to deliver the dying man to the Harper agent [[Rylock]] in time to save his fleeting life."
