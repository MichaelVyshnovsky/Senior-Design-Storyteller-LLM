'''Urnalithorgathla''' was a female [[wyrm]] [[green dragon]] that once laired in [[Spiderhaunt Wood]] in the [[Dalelands]].{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|90}}

==History==
Around the 1270s DR, Urnalithorgathla slew the [[Grimblades]] adventuring company in her lair, and left their bones amidst her treasure. She took the sword ''[[Sarghathuld]]'', wielded by their leader [[Kesten Orthalin]], for her hoard, and it lay there for over ninety years.

Finally, Urnalithorgathla was slain by a force of [[dwarf|dwarves]] led by [[Borlin]], who claimed ''Sarghathuld'', prior to [[1364 DR]].
