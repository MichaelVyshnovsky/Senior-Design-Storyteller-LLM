Urnalithorgathla was a female wyrm green dragon that once laired in Spiderhaunt Wood in the Dalelands.
Around the 1270s DR, Urnalithorgathla slew the Grimblades adventuring company in her lair, and left their bones amidst her treasure. She took the sword Sarghathuld, wielded by their leader Kesten Orthalin, for her hoard, and it lay there for over ninety years.
Finally, Urnalithorgathla was slain by a force of dwarves led by Borlin, who claimed Sarghathuld, prior to 1364 DR.
