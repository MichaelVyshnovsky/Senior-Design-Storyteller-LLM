'''Unimak Giantskull''' was the head of a band of [[arctic dwarves]] that lived in the isolated settlement of [[Frostrill]] within the [[Silver Marches]] around the year [[1372 DR]]. Although he had no official title, he acted as the spokesperson and leader for his kin.

==Activities==
Unimak led his fellow ''Inugaakalikurit'' in guarding their hunting grounds from local northern neighbors while avoiding the groups of [[giant]]s that lived nearby. However, they would regularly hunt [[orc]]s within the region, an endeavor whose undertaking was aided by their ''war-leader'', [[Nunima Orc-eater]], and ''hunt leader'' [[Aniva Icefoot]].
