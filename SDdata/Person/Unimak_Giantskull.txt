Unimak Giantskull was the head of a band of arctic dwarves that lived in the isolated settlement of Frostrill within the Silver Marches around the year 1372 DR. Although he had no official title, he acted as the spokesperson and leader for his kin.
Unimak led his fellow Inugaakalikurit in guarding their hunting grounds from local northern neighbors while avoiding the groups of giants that lived nearby. However, they would regularly hunt orcs within the region, an endeavor whose undertaking was aided by their war-leader, Nunima Orc-eater, and hunt leader Aniva Icefoot.
