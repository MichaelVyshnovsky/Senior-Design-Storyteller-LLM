Eloar was an eladrin noble and the Mistress of the Spire of Summers Mist on the Watch on Forevers Edge, together with Dramvar.
She wore elaborate, stylish black leather armor, and carried a rapier.
During her fight with Taal, Eloar made use of short-range teleportations, a blinding effect alongside her rapier attack, and even became invisible for a brief period.
At a point in time equivalent to the , Eloar joined Dramvar in a trip to their neighboring spire, the Tower of Winters Peace, where they sought to talk to Malyanna. Her castellan, Taal, informed them that her absence continued and that she was in the world rather than the Feywild they invoked the Articles of the Compact, requesting Taal provide access to her chambers, so that they may be examined for suspicious activity. Though Taal acquiesced, he ambushed and slew them shortly afterwards. He discarded their bodies over Forevers Edge later.
Taal replicated Dramvars handwriting later, claiming that the two eladrin nobles hed slain had decided to remain at Winters Peace for a full tenday.
