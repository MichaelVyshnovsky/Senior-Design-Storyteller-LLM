However, an adventuring party hired to defeat Old Gnawbones, who had previously destroyed most of hobgoblin strongholds in the forest, attacked the Zartrusss main camp and Garbul was killed in the fighting.\nGarbul possessed the Green Dragons Mask, once part of his masters hoard but sold it to Alandra, who sent it to Neronvain."
