'''Jon Talvick''' was one of the neighbors of the ex-[[Harper]] [[thief]] named [[Edgin Darvis]] in the town of [[Targos]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Jon and his wife [[Veri Talvick|Veri]] lived next door to Edgin and were friends of his deceased wife [[Zia]]. When Ed was left alone with a newborn, Jon's family happily babysat young [[Kira]]. Jon's nine-year-old daughter [[Miriam Talvick|Miriam]] adored the newborn and happily took care of her when Edgin needed help.

Jon and his family babysat Kira when Edgin and his new friend [[Holga Kilgore]] embarked on their first heist: [[Pendro's Pawnshop]] in Targos. Nine years later, in the 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} Jon and Veri's youngest child, [[Sief Talvick|Sief]], accompanied his father to the [[Trip and Shuffle]] tavern for dinner and to listen to a red-haired [[hin]] [[minstrel]]'s crooning. That was the night when a marauding band of [[gnoll]]s attacked the tavern after finding their way into Targos. In the chaos and brawl, gnolls got away with the stolen loot and grabbed the four-year-old Sief, leaving Jon distraught, but with his ankle broken, he could not run and rescue his son.

Edgin, Holga, and their new thieving ally, [[Forge Fitzwilliam]], set out to find the marauders and recover their stolen gold, unaware of a kidnapped child sure to become the hyenas' next meal. After a wild fight and cunning use of a nestful of hungry [[stirges]], Sief was rescued and returned to Jon, and it awas the deed that made Edgin and his crew the local heroes.
