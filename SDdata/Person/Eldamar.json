        "mainbody": "Eldamar, the Dreadlord, was a powerful lich that was frozen into a huge glacier.\nEldamar was a studious mage and worshiper of Tyr who was obsessed with immortality. He was incredibly stubborn, and would not listen to the advice of others on the topic of extending his life.\nApproximately 375 years prior to the mid-14 century DR, Eldamar and his twin brother, Oswulf, constructed a castle in the low area between the peaks of the Dragonspine Mountains. The castle became known as the Castle of the Twins. Over the following quarter of a decade, Verdigris, a mining town, was established below the castle. Both Eldamar and his brother would guide the town, which would become very prominent.\nThe mage began to research how to become immortal, and when his studies became advanced, he transformed himself into a lich. He believed that his brother would not stand for this and would recruit others to slay him. In order to protect himself, and still fearing death even as a lich, he hired evil creatures to assist him. It was then that he took on the name Dreadlord.\nAs his hordes overtook and ruined the town of Verdigris, he built winding mazes and traps throughout the area.\nThe Silver Blades, led by his twin, would force monsters out of the ruined town. However, Oswulf was unwilling to slay his brother. Instead, he gathered the spellcasters of his group. They researched a spell and cast it upon the valley, freezing both it and Eldamar inside a huge glacier."
