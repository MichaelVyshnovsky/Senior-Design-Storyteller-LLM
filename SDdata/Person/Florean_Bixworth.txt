{{quote|''Didn't know standing in the street was a crime.''|Florean Bixworth}}
==Description==
Florean was a young [[human]] man with a light skin tone and blue eyes. He had long golden blonde hair and short trimmed facial hair. Florean wore a commoner's jacket, red [[tunic]], and [[leather]] trousers.
==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Florean Bixworth and his husband found themselves unjustly detained by [[Flaming Fist|Fist]] [[Elthira Gossen]] during what was meant to be a promenade through the Lower City of the Gate. The couple, taking a rest due to Florean's aching leg, appeared suspicious to the overzealous Fist patrolwoman. Despite their innocence and only wanting to return home, Florean and Drongo were subjected to unwarranted accusations and harassment for simply loitering.
