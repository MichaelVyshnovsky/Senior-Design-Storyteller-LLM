Leustrarax was the barbarian shaman leader of the Bear-Tooth tribe sometime before 1372 DR.
Leustraraxs most notable possession was a set of enchanted heavy armor - Deep Dark Red. The armor was taken as a trophy from an ambitious knight who attempted to expand his fiefdom into the Bear-Tooth tribes territory. Soon after, the Bear-Tooth tribe was attacked by the Bloody Tusk‎‎ orcs. Along with the warriors of his tribe, Leustrarax turned back the tide of battle after a series of relentless assaults. The barbarians pushed orcish forces back into the craves they poured out of. Leustrarax armed himself with Deep Dark Red, which allowed him to see in the pitch darkness of the orc caves, and ventured in. Subsequently, Leustrarax killed the chieftain of Bloody Tusk‎‎s with a single poisoned arrow.
