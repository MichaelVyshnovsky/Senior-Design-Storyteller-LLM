'''Noolgaloop''' was a [[kuo-toa]] high priest in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
The kuo-toa led by Noolgaloop were lured by [[Halaster]] to an island on a grotto inside the [[Twisted Caverns]], where an [[otyugh]] had lived until the Mad Mage [[petrified]] it. As planned by Halaster, the kuo-toa started to worship the petrified otyugh, which Noolgaloop identified as a god called [[Bulba-Slopp]].

In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} the [[aboleth]] [[Illuun]] arrived in the area and started to mentally enslave the local kuo-toa, gaining control of the grotto. Seeing Bulba-Slopp was ineffective against the aboleth, Noolgaloop declared the petrified otyugh not worthy of worship any more and decided to create a new god to protect them.

==Activities==
Noolgaloop led the kuo-toa community inside the Twisted Caverns and was at war with the invading [[aboleth]] and its thralls. Noolgaloop was busy trying to erect the idol of the new god he had devised, [[Klaabu]], using some carcasses gathered by his minions and planning to reclaim the kuo-toa holy shrine from the control of the aboleth.

==Personality==
Noolgaloop truly believed he could create a god to protect his people.
