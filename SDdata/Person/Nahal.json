        "mainbody": "Nahal was a wild mage and spell inventor.\nNahal the Incorrigible was the student of Hornung, the \"king of the wild mages\". However, her teacher accidentally ended up on Oerth, and Nahal set out on a search for him, even though she didnt know his location. and Nahals nonsensical nullifier.\nAlways curious, Nahal experimented with how wild magic affected the Realms. The curious Nahal wanted to use her untamed powers for a good cause, and so used her knowledge of wild magic to help others control it.\nThe skilled wild mage owned a pair of bracers of defense, a wand of wonder, and a warp marble.\nChants around Sigil claimed that Nahal (along with her teacher, Hornung) taught Quake, a chaotic wild mage of the Xaositects."
