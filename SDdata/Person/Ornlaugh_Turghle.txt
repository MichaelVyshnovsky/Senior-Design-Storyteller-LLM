'''Ornlaugh Turghle''' was a [[doppelganger]] who posed as a merchant in the city of [[Reddansyr]] on the [[Dragon Coast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
In his disguised form, Ornlaugh was a portly man, constantly gasping for air.

==History==
By the time the doppelganger was discovered, he had impersonated Ornlaugh Turghle for over a decade. As the merchant, Ornlaugh dealt in moneychanging, sold [[iron]]mongery, locks, hinges, and fastenings of all types, and ran a merchant fleet. Many of the folk who purchased locking mechanisms from the disguised doppelganger believed that the items were somehow [[enchanted]], allowing doppelgangers to creep into their homes, slay and replace the good folk of Reddansyr. What happened to the real Ornlaugh was unknown, but he was unlikely to have had survived.
