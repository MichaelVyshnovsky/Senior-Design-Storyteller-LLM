'''Admiral Bluenose''' was an infamous Dread Pirate servant of [[Umberlee]], the Bitch Queen, who lived sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Admiral Bluenose served his goddess even after displeasing her. As a punishment, Umberlee sent a lightning to strike Bluenose, however, the Dread Pirate survived the ordeal. He later donned a set of [[enchanted]] [[Umberlant]] chains called ''[[Stormscale]]'', designed in honor of the Bitch Queen's [[sahuagin]] servants. Admiral Bluenose spent time trying to make amends with his deity, eventually parting ways with the magic chainmail sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.
