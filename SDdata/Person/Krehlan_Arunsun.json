        "mainbody": "'''Krehlan Arunsun''' was the son of [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] and [[Laeral Silverhand]] and the fourth [[Blackstaff]].",
        "Description": "Krehlan was silver-haired from birth.",
        "Personality": "Laeral noted in ''[[Lifelong with Regrets]]'' (published [[1391 DR]]) that Krehlan had his father's temper.",
        "History": "Laeral was pregnant with Krehlan by the end of the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]].<ref group=\"note\">This suggests Krehlan was probably born in [[1375 DR]].\n\nUnlike his parents, Krehlan was not a [[Chosen of Mystra]], but was still a highly skilled spellcaster, sufficient to become a [[Blackstaff]]. Krehlan became [[Blackstaff]] in the [[1400 DR|Year of Lost Ships, 1400 DR]].\n\nIn the [[1415 DR]], Krehlan and the Grand Mages of [[Rhymanthiin]] dissipated the ''[[kiira N'Vaelhar]]'', which held the spirit-templates and combined knowledge of Khelben Arunsun, [[Tsarra Chaadren]], and [[Kyriani Agrivar]], and bound its magic to [[Blackstaff Tower]] and its twin in Rhymanthiin, [[N'Vaerymanth]].\n\nAround [[1424 DR]], Krehlan was killed by [[Chartham Dellenvol]]. His successor was [[Ashemmon]] of Rhymanthiin. Krehlan's spirit-template went on to reside within Blackstaff Tower, along with the spirit-templates of the other former Blackstaffs."
