'''Aunsible Durn''' was a smith in the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. His [[Aunsible Durn's smithy|smithy]] had no name, for there was no other in town.

==Activities==
A skilled smith, Durn forged agricultural tools like [[horseshoe]]s, plowshares, and [[scythe]]s, and even various [[polearm]]s. People traveled for miles to purchase his wares, or at the least the tools. Local farmers with a bit of wealth to spare liked to outfit their workers with [[polearm|bill]]s, [[halberd]]s, and [[pike (weapon)|pike]]s from Aunsible Durn. Hence he did good business and good work.

He was assisted in his work by [[Dovo]]. Durn found him to be a good worker, but recognized his many failings. He ordered him to keep his pranks and philandering well away from the smithy and his business, and not to annoy the customers.

==Personality==
While working, Aunsible Durn focused on his task and said little, but when free he was open and talkative.

He assessed the smith in [[Hultail]] as "no artist with an [[anvil]]".

==History==
Durn came to Ghars and set up shop there shortly after the [[Purple Dragons]] garrison did. Their presence and the services of craftsfolk such as Durn helped the village grow into a town. He was well established by the mid-1360s DR.

In the first several days of his employment, Dovo, fancying himself a prankster, put a burr under his friend [[Argys Kral]]'s saddle so it threw him when he mounted. Durn chewed Dovo out for that and he carried out no more of his pranks, at least at the smithy.

In [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, the king's envoy [[Grodoveth]] went to the smithy to get his horse re-shoed. Dovo annoyed him with questions and Grodoveth hit him for being too rough with his [[horse]]. A few days later, on [[Eleint 16]], Dovo was found dead and Durn was left with a heavy workload to do alone. In the evening, [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] went to the smithy to speak with Durn as part of his investigation. Over [[tea]] in the apartment above, Durn related what kind of man Dovo was and his recent history. Durn considered trying to help Dovo's widow and children.
