'''Constulgrael''' was a [[dragon aging|very old]]{{Cite web enhancement/Roll Call of Dragons|4}}In ''Secrets of the Magister'', Constulgrael is described as a great wyrm; the later source, the ''Roll Call of Dragons'', describes him as just very old. [[black dragon]] and the only true [[dragon]] to become [[Magister]]. He reigned from [[983 DR]] to [[986 DR]].

==History==
In [[983 DR]], Constulgrael went on a hunt, intending to slay all other male black dragons he encountered, to slay dragons of other kind if it was possible without danger, and to find a female black dragon for a mate. Sleeping in a swamp, he encountered [[Malune Nalonkrivar]], the reigning Magister, who landed atop his back. Constulgrael surprised Malune and easily killed him, but was [[teleport]]ed by a ''[[contingency]]'' spell to a hilltop cairn where Malune stored a cache of healing magic. Tearing his way out of the wizard's cairn, the power of the Magister entered into Constulgrael. Bewildered, the dragon asked [[Mystra]] for answers and soon [[Azuth]] appeared to explain. They made a bargain, Azuth provided the dragon with Malune's spells, and Constulgrael promised to spread magic in the Realms.

In time, he come to enjoy his position, though he caused destruction in some cities in [[Thay]] when fighting with wizards challenging him. Eventually, a party of [[Red Wizards of Thay]] decided to hunt him down, greatly weakening him before Constulgrael met his doom in the [[Howling Caverns]] by [[Meldryn Jalensifer]].
