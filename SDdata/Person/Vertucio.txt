'''Captain Vertucio''' was a member of the [[Order of the Sapphire Crescent]], the [[Church of Waukeen]]'s personal mercenary army, in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Vertucio was a strict commander, fully loyal to the Order and the Church of Waukeen. Even though he was quite fond of [[Vambran Matrell]], he did not allow disobedience.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Captain Vertucio was the commanding officer of Vambran Matrell of the noble merchant [[House Matrell]] of Arrabar. Vambran's troops, his two friends, Sergeants [[Adyan Mercatio]] and [[Horial Rohden]], as well as their trade vessel the ''[[Lady's Favor]]'', were under Captain Vertucio's command. On [[Tarsakh 13]] of 1373 DR, Captain Vertucio was ordered to deploy the entire army of the Sapphire Crescent under orders from the [[Temple of Waukeen (Arrabar)|Temple of Waukeen]]'s Grand Trabbar [[Lavant]]. Captain Vertucio turned down Vambran Matrell's requests for personal time despite several requests and the grand celebration of his sister's sixteenth birthday. The deployment orders came as a way of stopping Vambran's investigation into Lavant's corruption and his sneak coin cabal's illicit activities.

To the lieutenant's surprise, he was offered an excuse to delay the deployment under a false pretense. [[Grolo Firefist]] covered for Vambran as he attended his sister's birthday celebration, where the cabal's plot rapidly unfolded. As Vambran was gone for a suspiciously long time, Captain Vertucio dispatched a squad of Crescents to rein him in. Unwittingly, the mercenaries aided the ensued struggle. As a result, Vambran Matrell received a disciplinary rebuke from Vertucio. A punishment in symbol only.
