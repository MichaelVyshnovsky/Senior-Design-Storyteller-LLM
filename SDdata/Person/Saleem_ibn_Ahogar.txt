Saleem ibn Ahogar was an inhabitant within the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Saleem was a representative of the jann of the High Desert and the leader of the jann in Huzuz.
A charmer to the core, Saleem was even able to coax smiles out of the ironclad Alyana al-Azzazi and Rahmah al-Zahir. He ensured they always had a pair of janni bodyguards.
Saleem was the personal bodyguard of the Grand Caliph, Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir. Saleem also guarded the Grand Caliph whenever he attended the Royal Harim.
Though he was technically a subordinate of Jiraad, the noble marid treated Saleem as an equal, gaining his loyalty and respect.
Saleem wielded a powerful magical great scimitar with defender properties.
