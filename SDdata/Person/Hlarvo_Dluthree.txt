'''{{PAGENAME}}''' was the owner of the [[Flying Stag]], an inn that catered to well-to-do travelers in [[Voonlar]], as of the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. Hlarvo was formerly a skilled carpenter with dreams of opening his own inn. His skeptical wife [[Valladonra Dluthree|Valladonra]] goaded him into it by snidely observing that he would follow his dream when "stags learned to fly".{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|22}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 17: A Place to Stay}}
