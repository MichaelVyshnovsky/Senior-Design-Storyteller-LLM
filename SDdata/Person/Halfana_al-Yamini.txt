'''Halfana al-Yamini''' was an [[oathbinder genie]] who worked for the [[Everlasting]] in [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Halfana was summoned when eight [[rafiq]]s prayed to [[Hajama]], and the ''[[lamp of devotion]]'' was filled with rich, and possibly magical, [[incense]] and lit. A [[da'i]] set the conditions of an oath for a new supplicant, and Halfana sealed the obligation.
