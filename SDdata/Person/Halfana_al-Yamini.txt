Halfana al-Yamini was an oathbinder genie who worked for the Everlasting in Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Halfana was summoned when eight rafiqs prayed to Hajama, and the lamp of devotion was filled with rich, and possibly magical, incense and lit. A dai set the conditions of an oath for a new supplicant, and Halfana sealed the obligation.
