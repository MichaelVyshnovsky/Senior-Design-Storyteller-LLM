High Moonmistress '''Brima Chintamn''' was the [[Church of Selûne|Selûnite]] high priest of [[Bright Lady's Tower]] in [[Chancelgaunt]] during the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|757}}, Brima laid charges of heresy against the [[New Moon Pact]], an order of militant [[lycanthrope]]s that had gained much wealth and power while remaining independent from the temples of the faith. Accusing them of revering [[Shar]] as a facet of [[Selûne]], Brima contacted ten other high priests of the faith to legitimize the accusations, including [[Rian Liurandel]], [[Zarran Tonnos]], [[Bero Falabara]], and [[Jolara Nightnever]]. These charges were formalized and laid out in a written record on [[Kythorn 18]] of that year, and the forces of Selûne's church were sent against her own champions.

The Pact was destroyed, with [[Tyver Thorndrove]], [[Niree Swifthands]], [[Brant Hallower]], [[Qualise Domo]], [[Rade]], and [[Enshu Venerun]] among those killed. The [[wolf]] [[Halftail]] managed to escape by Selûne's grace, but the lands and assets of the Pact were seized and taken by the temples, and the historical record intentionally obscured and so that the Pact was only known for its alleged heresy.

Shortly after the destruction of the Pact, Bright Lady's Tower was abandoned and razed, and no temple of Selûne was rebuilt in Selgaunt afterwards. The records from the Tower were sent to [[Moonshadow Hall]] in [[Yhaunn]], where Halftail, as [[Asha the Silent]], came to be High Moonmistress and served Selûne by protecting the Pact's legacy.

==Rumors & Legends==
Evidence found by [[Dhauna Myritar]] and [[Feena Archwood]] showed that the charges against the New Moon Pact were falsified, indicating that [[Selûne]]'s displeasure fell upon Brima and her temple afterwards.
