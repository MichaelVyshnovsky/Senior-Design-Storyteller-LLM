High Moonmistress Brima Chintamn was the Selûnite high priest of Bright Ladys Tower in Chancelgaunt during the 8 century DR.
In the , Brima laid charges of heresy against the New Moon Pact, an order of militant lycanthropes that had gained much wealth and power while remaining independent from the temples of the faith. Accusing them of revering Shar as a facet of Selûne, Brima contacted ten other high priests of the faith to legitimize the accusations, including Rian Liurandel, Zarran Tonnos, Bero Falabara, and Jolara Nightnever. These charges were formalized and laid out in a written record on Kythorn 18 of that year, and the forces of Selûnes church were sent against her own champions.
The Pact was destroyed, with Tyver Thorndrove, Niree Swifthands, Brant Hallower, Qualise Domo, Rade, and Enshu Venerun among those killed. The wolf Halftail managed to escape by Selûnes grace, but the lands and assets of the Pact were seized and taken by the temples, and the historical record intentionally obscured and so that the Pact was only known for its alleged heresy.
Shortly after the destruction of the Pact, Bright Ladys Tower was abandoned and razed, and no temple of Selûne was rebuilt in Selgaunt afterwards. The records from the Tower were sent to Moonshadow Hall in Yhaunn, where Halftail, as Asha the Silent, came to be High Moonmistress and served Selûne by protecting the Pacts legacy.
Evidence found by Dhauna Myritar and Feena Archwood showed that the charges against the New Moon Pact were falsified, indicating that Selûnes displeasure fell upon Brima and her temple afterwards.
