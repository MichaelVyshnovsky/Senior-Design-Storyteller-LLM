'''Mikaal Dannihyr''' was a [[human]] male and the head of the Dannihyr mercantile family in [[Eshpurta]], which gave him a seat on the [[Shield Council of Eshpurta|Shield Council]] as of early [[1370 DR|1370 DR, the Year of the Tankard]].. Mikaal was the aging grandson of [[Rhinnom Dannihyr]], the [[Iltarch]] (chief intelligence officer) of Amn, whom most of the family believed to be dead. The Dannihyr family was in a weak position because of honor debts to the Vymmar family, which held deeds to half the Dannihyr clan's holdings.
