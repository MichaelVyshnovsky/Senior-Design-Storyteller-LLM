Mikaal Dannihyr was a human male and the head of the Dannihyr mercantile family in Eshpurta, which gave him a seat on the Shield Council as of early 1370 DR, the Year of the Tankard.. Mikaal was the aging grandson of Rhinnom Dannihyr, the Iltarch (chief intelligence officer) of Amn, whom most of the family believed to be dead. The Dannihyr family was in a weak position because of honor debts to the Vymmar family, which held deeds to half the Dannihyr clans holdings.
