Gruel was the leader of a Zhentilar press gang in the village of Snowmantle during the mid-14 century DR. The half-orc and his crew were regulars of the Singing Dryad "tavern", which was in-fact a mess hall for the occupying Zhent soldiers.
He was an outright stupid thug, who was easily incited to violence despite orders to refrain from the overseeing Zhentarim wizard Ragnoth.
