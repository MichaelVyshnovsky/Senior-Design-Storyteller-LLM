'''Gruel''' was the leader of a [[Zhentilar]] press gang in the village of [[Snowmantle]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The [[half-orc]] and his crew were regulars of the [[Singing Dryad]] "tavern", which was in-fact a mess hall for the occupying [[Zhent]] soldiers.

He was an outright stupid thug, who was easily incited to violence despite orders to refrain from the overseeing [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]] [[Ragnoth]].
