'''Beluarion''' was [[human]] [[fighter]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a senior officer of the [[Flaming Fist]] ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].

==History==
During the early 1360s [[DR]], Beluarion and [[Nenon]] led an expedition of some 150 Flaming Fist mercenaries, as well as six hired [[elf]] guides, into the [[Chult|jungles of Chult]]. Although the expedition was a success, Beluarion and half their forces lost their lives trekking through the overgrown wilderness. Nenon went on to lead the Flaming Fist settlement of [[Fort Beluarian]].
