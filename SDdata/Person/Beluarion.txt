Beluarion was human fighter of Baldurs Gate during the midâ€“14 century DR. He was a senior officer of the Flaming Fist circa 1358 DR.
During the early 1360s DR, Beluarion and Nenon led an expedition of some 150 Flaming Fist mercenaries, as well as six hired elf guides, into the jungles of Chult. Although the expedition was a success, Beluarion and half their forces lost their lives trekking through the overgrown wilderness. Nenon went on to lead the Flaming Fist settlement of Fort Beluarian.
