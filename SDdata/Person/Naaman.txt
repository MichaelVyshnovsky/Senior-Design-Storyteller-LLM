Naaman was a roguish spellcaster who aligned himself with the Sarevok, the manipulative Bhaalspawn who rose to power during the midâˆ’14 century DR.
Naaman worked alongside numerous companions including Gardush, Aasim, Diyab, Alai, and their leader Zhalimar Cloudwulfe. While acting under the authority of the Iron Throne, the group sought to advance Sarevoks agenda throughout the Sword Coast.
He wore a pair of bracers of defense as a means to protect himself. He carried a variety of weapons on his person, including numerous types of daggers and a myriad of magical scrolls.
In the , Naaman and his group were sent by the Iron Throne to Baldurs Gate as advisors to the agent Thaldorn, to aid in his negotiations with Emissary Tar and the citys Council of Four. This meeting never occurred, as Sarevoks half-brotherAbdel Adrian and his companions thwarted their efforts.
