'''Naaman''' was a roguish [[spellcaster]] who aligned himself with the [[Sarevok]], the manipulative [[Bhaalspawn]] who rose to power during the mid−14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Template:Cite game/Baldur's Gate}}

==Activities==
Naaman worked alongside numerous companions including [[Gardush]], [[Aasim]], [[Diyab]], [[Alai]], and their leader [[Zhalimar Cloudwulfe]]. While acting under the authority of the [[Iron Throne]], the group sought to advance Sarevok's agenda throughout the [[Sword Coast]].

==Possessions==
He wore a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]'' as a means to protect himself. He carried a variety of weapons on his person, including numerous types of [[dagger]]s and a myriad of [[magic]]al scrolls.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, Naaman and his group were sent by the Iron Throne to [[Baldur's Gate]] as advisors to the agent [[Thaldorn]], to aid in his negotiations with [[Tar (emissary)|Emissary Tar]] and the city's [[Council of Four]]. This meeting never occurred, as Sarevok's half-brother[[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions thwarted their efforts.
