Skeld Steelhelm was a dwarf adventurer from Mithral Hall who joined a group of fellow dwarves aiding Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR.
He was a companion of Gord Roundshield of Citadel Felbarr,Skeld refers to a "handful of heroes" and lists these four dwarfholds, but only names Gord. As Skeld, Gord, Taggot, and Tori all give Lore entries about their respective dwarfholds and have dwarf-specific quests, it may be assumed that all four were part of the same group.
In the , the four dwarf companions came to Neverwinter to offer their aid to the beleaguered city. Skeld helped to coordinate their efforts where it was needed, but Gord charged off into the Tower District to wage a one-dwarf war on the Many-Arrows orcs occupying the area. Skeld asked a fellow dwarf adventurer to check up on Gord and ask him to return.
