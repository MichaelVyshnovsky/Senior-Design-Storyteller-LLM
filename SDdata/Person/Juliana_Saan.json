        "mainbody": "Juliana Saan was a young ranger and tavern owner inhabiting Snowmantle in Daggerdale during the  mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nShe stood  tall. Many considered her to be an attractive woman.\nJuliana was brave but a bit naive.\nCirca 1369 DR, Juliana inherited the Singing Dryad tavern when her father was slain by Zhentilar soldiers when they first occupied the town. Slaves under the command of the Zhentarim wizard Ragnoth were assigned to help her run the tavern since it was used as a mess hall by the Zhentilar.\nShe did her best to smuggle extra food and water to the slaves, but was under the watchful eye of a Banite priest named Noth.\nShe carried a longsword, dagger, and quarterstaff."
