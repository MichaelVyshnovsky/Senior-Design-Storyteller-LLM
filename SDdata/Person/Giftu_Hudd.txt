Giftu had a pale skin, bulbous nose, and light brown beard. He wore a simple leather skullcap and a leather jerkin.
In the , an army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldurs Gate, displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Giftu Hudd and his sibling found their way to the city walls and were allowed to enter the Lower City, unlike many other refugees who were refused entrance due to lack of coin or paperwork. Giftu was happy to be protected by the city walls, confident their could withstand the Absolutist siege.
