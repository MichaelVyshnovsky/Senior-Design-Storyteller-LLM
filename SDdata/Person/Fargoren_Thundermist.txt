'''Fargoren Thundermist''' was a [[voadkyn]], or wood giant, who lived in the forests in [[Shadowdale]] around the year [[1369 DR]].

==Personality==
Fargoren was suspicious and quiet of most races, but friendly to [[elves]]. He would not necessarily talk to or assist travelers in the woods, nor would he attack them on sight.
