Aralagath Tarsil was the Magister from  to .
As a boy he was uncannily beautiful.
He was known to have spells akin to wizard eye, fly, invisibility, and wraithform.
Originally the favourite pet of Pasha Eiruidin Ondaru, after the latter was assassinated by Ongraunnathan the Blind in  and presented as alive with magic, Aralagath was tested for magic, alongside many people in the Palace, by Ongraunnathan. Realizing those who demonstrated skill disappeared, Aralagath pretended to fail to cast any spell. However, during moments when his master was drunk on whiteworms in wine, Aralagath practiced with new intensity, reaching basic competency in the Art by the time another sorcerer challenged and slew Ongraunnathan by turning his own flying zombies against him, some time after .
Aralagath escaped with three of Ongraunnathans tomes in the confusion though the challenger sent three zombies against him, he eventually lost them. After that, he became a traveling hermit that sometimes snuck into wizards abodes to copy their spells, spending much effort on thwarting the ensuing pursuit and always returning the spellbooks afterwards. In few years, he had developed a number of new spells that was uncommon for mages much more gifted Azuth offered him the position of the Magister at this time.
As the Magister, Aralagath continued to move about, mainly active in the lands north of Calimshan along the Sword Coast, though he ventured a little into the Sea of Fallen Stars. He also created a casting ground on a Cormyrean hill overlooking the Whitewater, teaching some nearby dwelling children of its powers, and dropping in on some mages to furnish them with a spell.
Aralagath was accidentally killed by Orten Imdrar, who used a high-explosive spell to enlarge a flooding mine. The spell blasted apart the top of some natural caverns, and the Magister who thought he was safely sleeping above them.
