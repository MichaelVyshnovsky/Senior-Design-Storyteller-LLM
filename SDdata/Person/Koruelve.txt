'''Koruelve''' was a senior officer of the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenary company during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==History==
Following the heavy losses of their senior leadership during the perilous expeditions the Flaming Fist embarked upon in the early 1360s DR, Koruelve was one of the few surviving officers aside from [[Grand Duke|Duke]] [[Eltan]], [[Scar]] and [[Moruene]]. They would serve with the new generation of leaders within the mercenary organization, which included [[Lendali Firehair]], [[Morgan Redwing]], and [[Skot-sar]] of [[Berdusk]].
