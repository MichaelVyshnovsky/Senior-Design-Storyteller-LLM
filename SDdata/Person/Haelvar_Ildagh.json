        "Description": "Haelvar Ildagh was vulture-like and balding.",
        "Personality": "Haelvar preferred 'Grimskull' to his own name. He saw all people as cattle, with [[wizard]]s being simply those whose benefits could be greatest if correctly husbanded. Near the end of his life, he became obsessed with divine edicts.",
        "History": "Before his tenure, Haelvar's life had been a long series of assassinations, alliances, and escapes in his quest to become magically more powerful. After slaying [[Horgyl Tusselvarr]] and becoming the Magister, Haelvar neglected the less powerful, instead focusing his aid on those who were established, hard-working, and creative, so as to have magic he could steal. Though this generated advances in spellcraft, it did not lead to more magesâ€”and those he aided turned out to have tyrannical streaks of their own.\n\nDuring a [[Magefair]], Haelvar witnessed the mage [[Tolamn]] of [[Shussel]] launch a surprise attack on his fellows; the mage, alongside two others that tried to use the chaos to launch sneak attack on wizards, was ''[[feeblemind]]ed''. Afterward, the dead were resurrected by [[Azuth]] and [[Mystra]], who had never spoken to him throughout his tenure. The Magister was shaken by the intervention, and became very observant of divine edicts, to the best of his ability.\n\nLater in his life, Haelvar began to crave company. He was looking for candidates when one lass in his arms melted back into his true form, that of [[Isilger Mountrant]], and slew him."
