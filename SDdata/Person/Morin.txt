'''Morin''' was a gladiator who fought in the [[Arena (Hillsfar)|Arena of Hillsfar]].

==Description==
Morin was an extremely tough opponent, but was not perfect. Due to the feathered [[helmet]] he wore, he would often give away where he would strike, due to the movement of the feathers. He would also raise his [[staff]] in the direction he was going to attack before he actually initiated the attack.

==History==
Morin fought in the arena ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].
