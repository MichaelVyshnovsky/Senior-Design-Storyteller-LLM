        "mainbody": "'''Stevvin Hightower''' was the mayor of the hamlet of [[Pilver's Creek]] in the late mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Stevvin Hightower was thin and sharp-nosed. He wore, even while working, a many-pocketed robe. While in command of a force, he wore his helmet and carried a sword.",
        "Possessions": "Though he owned a breastplate and sword, they simply collected dust. He kept an ebony, spiral-cut staff in easy reach, even while working.",
        "Abilities": "Stevvin could use a spell that created a bolt of lightning to sear enemies, most likely ''[[lightning bolt]]''. He also knew another spell, almost certainly ''[[fireball]]''. {{cite dragon/343/Rivals|62-63}} He also had spells like ''[[magic missile]]''. {{cite dragon/343/Rivals|64-65}}",
        "History": "In the late mid-14th century DR, Stevvin Hightower posted a bounty of 1000 [[gold pieces]] for a white dragon, convinced it had been killing people around the hamlet. [[Dorn Graybrook]] and [[Raryn Snowstealer]], respectively a fugitive [[half-golem]] arena fighter who stood convinced of killing his master and a [[snow dwarf]], came the same day for the bounty; he finally agreed to hire both of them and split the reward according to the work they did. Raryn eventually determined the dragon was actually a [[cryohydra]], but Stevvin did not care to change the posting.\n\nHowever, after they slew a cryohydra, Stevvin attacked Dorn and Raryn, aiming to keep the money for himself, then take the money for Dorn's bounty. After they were captured, Stevvin was warned another hydra was afoot, but ignored the warning. The hydra struck his camp later that evening; though his two prisoners came to his aid at first, they turned on him afterwards, and took him hostage as they fled by boat."
