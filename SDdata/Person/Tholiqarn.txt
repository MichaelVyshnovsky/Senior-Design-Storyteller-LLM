'''Tholiqarn''' was a [[mind flayer]] active in the [[Northdark]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Tholiqarn was one of a number of mind flayers who followed [[Qholillaroon]] to establish a colony in the [[Heartcoil Deeps]] with the ultimate goal of threatening [[Waterdeep]]. However, Tholiqarn was the first of his bretheren to encounter a party of [[adventurer]]s sent by [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Open Lord]], [[Laeral Silverhand]], to investigate the chaos that the mind flayers' arrival had caused. Tholiqarn was forced to fight them without the aid of any thralls, and was defeated.
