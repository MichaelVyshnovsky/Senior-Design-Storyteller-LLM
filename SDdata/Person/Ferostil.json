On that month, they stopped at [[the Rising Moon (inn)|The Rising Moon]] in [[Highmoon]]. While they celebrated their exploits at the inn, the company's thief, [[Lynxal]], was slaid by a local veteran after trying to pickpocket him. When returning to their room later, Ferostil discovered his shield missing; the maid at the inn, Shandril Shessair, announced she had stolen them. Predictably, they hired her as the new thief.\n\nDuring the next day, while the company decided whether to wait out the afternoon's mist or proceed in it, Ferostil's vote was for proceeding; when they made camp afterwards, he was assigned second watch.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|29-30|2}} Ferostil fought in the battle that came on [[Mirtul 12]],{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|33-36|2}} He voted for pursuing the mule train afterwards.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|38|2}} They pursued it to the [[Gates of Doom]] in the [[Oversember Vale]] in [[Mirtul 20]], where he was slain by a lightning spell, almost certainly ''[[lightning bolt]]'', cast by a magic-using sentry.\n\nThe dwarven adventurer Delg confirmed his death two months later.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|375|16}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005||21}}"
