        "History": "At first, Sarhthor appeared to be a member of the Zhentarim and one of the most favored assistants of [[Manshoon]] in the hunt for the ''[[spellfire]]'' of Shandril Shessair.<ref>\n\nHowever, when Shandril arrived in [[Zhentil Keep]] intent on destroying the Zhentarim for killing her friends, aided by [[Mirt]] and some [[Harper]] agents in disguise, it was revealed that Sarhthor was a Harper agent sent to infiltrate the Zhentarim a long time before. By then, however, nobody knew where Sarhthor's true loyalty lay. At first, he appears to want to use Shandril to dominate the Zhentarim. But at last, as [[Fzoul Chembryl]] threw a javelin at Shandril, Sarhthor protected her with his body. Before he died, he told Shandril how to use the ''[[Crown of Fire]]''.<ref>",
