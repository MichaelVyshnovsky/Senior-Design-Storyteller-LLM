        "mainbody": "winkin was a fearless and loyal secretary and assistant of Mayor Wilsey of Liams Hold in the late 14 century DR.\nTwinkin was a diminutive Hin woman with short red hair. She wore dark blue finery and a triangle head scarf the same color. She was busy and effective at her job, and prideful of her superior organizational skills.\nIn 1372 DR, Twinkin spent most of her time at the mayors house, aiding her with running the hamlet and making sure no visitors snuck past her without an appointment.\nSometime in the early fall of 1372 DR, an agent of the Lords Alliance, Astriel Shalyn, worked alongside the Hero of Daggerford in investigating strange occurrences surrounding the \"death\" of Pwyll Daggerford. After fleeing from Daggerford, Astriel spent time in Liams Hold, mingling with locals in order to become liked by the locals. When time was right, she tricked secretary Twinkin to run to Nells Pie Shop to pick up breads that the Mayor, allegedly, asked for. While the Mayors home was unattended, Astriel made an impression of the key to the Stronghold and returned it back to Wilseys desk. This trickery gave her access to the abandoned temple, a safe house while she waited for the Hero of Daggerford to claim the keep for themselves."
