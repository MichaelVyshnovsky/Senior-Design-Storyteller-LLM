'''Aumlar Chaunthoun''' was a [[Zhentarim]] mage of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was no fool, and was willing to limit his goals when facing something dangerous.

==Abilities==
He had forged a number of treaties and wills with his own hand. He'd also slain and impersonated a number of people.

One of his spells was a stolen [[Mulhorandi]] magic that, consuming horse bones, created a cloud of death that stole the lives of horses to power itself. Another spell, a dream-whisper or whisper-link, allowed him to eavesdrop on the thoughts of a number of people, requiring a hair of each as a material component.

Of note he had the ability to control numerous wands at once from a distance.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|235-242|14}} Another of his spells was a short-range teleportation.

==Possessions==
He was carrying a number of [[wand]]s. He also had a ''[[potion of healing]]'' and a ring that blocked many magics, but which he did not expect to block ''spellfire''.

==Relationships==
[[Sememmon]] counted him as someone to respect. During his last mission, he had two bodyguards. The red wizard Pheldred counted as one rival.

The red wizards under [[Hulrivior]] were aware of his presence in the place.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|310|18}}

==History==
As of late {{yearlink|1357}}, Aumlar Chaunthoun had been sent to three different missions as a Zhentarim mageling, and returned successful from each, gaining the organisation control over three or more [[Sembia]]n companies, a number of influential merchants from [[Tethyr]] and [[Amn]], one old-coin family from the same land, all unwittingly. One guildmaster in [[Waterdeep]] was aware of his control, but had not raised objections, fearing reprisal. Some years prior, he had cursed [[Pheldred]], a [[Red Wizard]], so that his hands turned into manacles at the most inconvenient times.

That year, Aumlar Chaunthoun was sent to seize ''[[spellfire]]'' from [[Shandril Shessair]], and to that end he impersonated a finecarver of pipes and horns named '''Theldarace Norlaund''', though he expected he would not succeed at the task and should instead concentrate on learning about spellfire or slaying rivals. During one of the ambushes before [[Triel]], Aumlar cast a spell to try and capture the thoughts of Shandril and Narm.

After confirming his spell worked he discovered he'd been scried on. However, the sensor was dismissed immediately, and before he could draw any conclusions he was attacked by the [[Red Wizard]] Pheldred. The battle burned many of his wands and left him gravely injured, but he was the victor. The [[Cult of the Dragon]] agents [[Krostal]] and [[Malivur]] tried to slay him afterwards and he fled with a spell, taking himself towards [[Narm]] and Shandril; the latter hurt him greatly, but it was [[Arauntar]] who ultimately killed him.

[[Korthauvar Hammantle]] and [[Hlael Toraunt]] confirmed his death afterwards.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|271|16}}

==Rumors & Legends==
[[Drauthtar Inskirl]] thought it trouble if he got spellfire.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|218|13}}
