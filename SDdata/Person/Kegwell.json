        "mainbody": "'''Kegwell''' was a house guard for the noble [[Seasilver]] family of [[Marsember]] who served during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "When two of the god's [[chosen]], [[Joelle Emmeline]], and [[Malik el Sami]] were traveling through Marsember, they made their way into the Seasilver estate and were stopped by the lord's majordomo [[Greymace]]. Kegwell and his fellow house guards were summoned to the scene, and he was given a parcel wrapped in cloth by Malik. Kegwell was ordered to take it directly to Grand Duke [[Farnig Seasilver]] aboard the ''[[Wave Wyvern]]'' as it would protect the lord."
