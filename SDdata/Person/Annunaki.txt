'''Annunaki''' was the ruler of [[Messemprar]] in [[Unther]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Annunaki was busy trying to survive the rebel siege on the royal palace.

==Personality==
Annunaki was one of the most brutal men in Unther. He was also scheming and ambitious with the secret goal to become the ruler of Unther instead of [[Gilgeam]]. Annunaki was too proud to accept a negotiation with the rebels or to surrender.
