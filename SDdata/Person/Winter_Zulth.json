        "History": "Winter was raised in Waterdeep and worked at the [[Horizon's Sails]] as a [[map]]-maker. He used his position for the Moonstars' cause by collating  maps and logbooks from exotic places like [[Zakhara]], [[Maztica]], and [[Kara-Tur]] and producing unique maps that were extremely valuable to explorers and navigators. He could also provide a ship for the Moonstar's needs upon request."
