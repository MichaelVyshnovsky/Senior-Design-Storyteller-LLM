Dowell Harpell was a member of the Harpell family and their spokesman in the late 15th century DR. He also served as Longsaddles representative on the council of the Lords Alliance.
Dowell was an adept enchanter, but was a notably unskilled evoker.
Dowell took the Harpell name following his marriage to Penelope Harpell. 
He helped Penelope in teaching magic to the reborn Catti-brie.
Sometime prior to the 1480s DR, Dowell met and fell in love with Penelope during a battle with a hill giant king in which Dowell was nearly eaten alive, but was saved by his future wife. 
As of 1489 DR, he was recognized as the spokesman for all of Longsaddle at the Lords Alliances council.
