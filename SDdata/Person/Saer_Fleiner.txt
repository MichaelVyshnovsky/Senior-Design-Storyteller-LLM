==Description==
Saer Fleiner was a [[dwarf|dwarvish]] woman with a clean-shaven face and dark brown hair, gathered in a braid and formed into a tight hairstyle. She had a light freckled skin and green eyes. Fleiner wore embroidered finery of green and golden colors.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, the gates between the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate and its more affluent [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] were closed, monitored by the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries and allowing only the wealthy and current residents of the Upper City through. Saer Fleiner was terrified of the cultist army that loomed over over city and was outraged by Baldur's Gate shutting the gates. The dwarf believed that the Upper City had more than enough space for everyone.
