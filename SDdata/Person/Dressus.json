His facial hair was unkempt, and his dark eyes were deeply set, accentuated by dark circles from lack of sleep. He had a gruff voice and, according to his employers, was not very bright. His bluff could be detected by Dressuss habit of biting his thumb fingernail when stressed.\nIn the , Dressus worked for a cabal of three noble families of Arrabar and the Temple of Waukeens corrupt Grand Trabbar Lavant. On orders from the cabal, Dressus led a band of henchmen disguised as the Municipal Guard of Arrabar to murder Jithelle Skolotti and Hoytir, two young servants of House Pharaboldi, to hide a bastard Pharaboldi child that was to be born. Dressus executed the youths and painted a circle mark on their foreheads, framing the servants as wizard imposters, a crime punished by death in Chondath. The deed was witnessed by Vambran Matrell and his sister Emriana Matrell. Young nobles suspected foul play, and Vambran used the locate object spell to track Dressus the following day. Unbeknownst to Vambran Matrell, Captain Dressus outlived his usefulness to the cabal. The guard captain was sent to a warehouse where he was killed by a leechwalker, the same monster that was used to ambush Vambran Matrell in an attempt to stop his investigation into the murder."
