        "mainbody": "'''Suryris''' was an honorable white [[minotaur]] duelist of the [[Orsraun Mountains]] in [[Turmish]], active some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Suryris wandered the Orsraun Mountains in the [[Vilhon Reach]], searching for opponents to feed his battle lust. Unlike many of his kin, Suryris treated the battle and his opponents honorably, never killing bested opponents. He wielded his powerful [[enchanted]] [[halberd]], later known as ''[[Suryris's Blade]]'', when crossing blades with other combatants.\n\nSuryris was bested in a duel only once after a fierce battle that lasted for many hours and only ended after the minotaur's opponent broke his [[sword]]. Suryris feared being defeated and inched closer to losing during the battle, and despite his opponent being disarmed, the minotaur conceded and gifted the opponent with his magic halberd. The astonished fighter accepted the gift and told the story of the white bull from the Orsraun Mountains to anyone who listened."
