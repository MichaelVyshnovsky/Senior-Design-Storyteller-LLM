        "Personality": "Laeroth was truly very old but like Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] he had decided to remain on [[Toril]] instead of going to [[Arvandor]]. He had inherited most of the wisdom and memories of the previous high mages. Laeroth was always pressured by his responsibilities, always being silent and purposeful with limitless patience and loyalty."
