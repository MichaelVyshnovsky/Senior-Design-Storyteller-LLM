He had inherited most of the wisdom and memories of the previous high mages. Laeroth was always pressured by his responsibilities, always being silent and purposeful with limitless patience and loyalty.\nDuring Nimesins War in 1371 DR, Laeroth was at the Tower of the Sun leading the defenders of the isle. However, just after he teleported the bladesinger Shanyrria Alenuath to the Sunrise Tower, the Tower of Sun was destroyed by a powerful spell from one of the Circle Singers of Kymil Nimesin."
