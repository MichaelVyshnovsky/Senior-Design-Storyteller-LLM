'''Ilstan Narbrace''' was a veteran member of the [[Purple Dragons]] in [[Suzail]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Around [[1479 DR]], Hethel and four more Dragons acted as escorts for the [[War Wizard of Cormyr]] [[Ellard Gauntur]] in his pursuit of the renegade [[Rorskryn Mreldrake]] to [[Marsember]] through a portal. They found their renegade in the shape of a woman, but Gauntur recognized their quarry because of a stain in Mreldrake's robes right at the moment of crossing through the portal; as they expounded on this to their retinue, Ilstan quickly pushed their leader through the same portal. Then the evil [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]] sent the [[death knight]] [[Targrael]] after them to hide Mreldrake's trail.

Targrael caught up to Ilstan Narbrace while running up a flight of stairs at the king's tower in [[Marsember]] on the other side of the portal, and punched her sword through his helm, without any fight.
