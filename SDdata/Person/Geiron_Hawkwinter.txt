Lord '''Geiron Hawkwinter''' was a Royal [[Corlann]] of [[Faerntarn]], the royal palace of Queen [[Zaranda Star|Zaranda]] and King [[Haedrak III]]. In this role, he maintained the royal quarters.

He was the favorite nephew of Lady [[Kyrin Hawkwinter]], the Countess of [[Calimmon]].

==Personality==
Like his aunt Kyrin, Geiron had a strong will, having even snuck away from home to join Prince Haedrak's army at only twelve years of age.

==Activities==
In the month of [[Tarsakh]], in [[1370 DR]], Tethyr sent troops to reinforce [[Trailstone]], which had seceded from [[Amn]] the previous month. At only 14 years of age, Geiron was sent along with the troops to serve as a scribe and general aide.

==Relationships==
Geiron was the son of [[Jornos Hawkwinter]], the twin brother of Kyrin Hawkwinter, making Geiron a grandson of [[Eremoes Hawkwinter]] of [[Waterdeep]].

During the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Reclamation Wars|Reclamation Wars]], Geiron was tutored by the Lady [[Perendra Raslemtar]], from whom he received high praise.

Geiron also sought training in the arcane arts from [[Gamalon Idogyr]], which took some courage on his part, for the lad was afraid of the Court Sage's [[gem]] eye.
