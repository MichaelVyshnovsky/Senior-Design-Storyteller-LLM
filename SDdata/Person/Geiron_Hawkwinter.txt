Lord Geiron Hawkwinter was a Royal Corlann of Faerntarn, the royal palace of Queen Zaranda and King Haedrak III. In this role, he maintained the royal quarters.
He was the favorite nephew of Lady Kyrin Hawkwinter, the Countess of Calimmon.
Like his aunt Kyrin, Geiron had a strong will, having even snuck away from home to join Prince Haedraks army at only twelve years of age.
In the month of Tarsakh, in 1370 DR, Tethyr sent troops to reinforce Trailstone, which had seceded from Amn the previous month. At only 14 years of age, Geiron was sent along with the troops to serve as a scribe and general aide.
Geiron was the son of Jornos Hawkwinter, the twin brother of Kyrin Hawkwinter, making Geiron a grandson of Eremoes Hawkwinter of Waterdeep.
During the Reclamation Wars, Geiron was tutored by the Lady Perendra Raslemtar, from whom he received high praise.
Geiron also sought training in the arcane arts from Gamalon Idogyr, which took some courage on his part, for the lad was afraid of the Court Sages gem eye.
