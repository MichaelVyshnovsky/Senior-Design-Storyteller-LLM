        "mainbody": "sbeel was a moon elf who was at once both blessed and cursed by Tymora and Beshaba to become a sentinel charged with watching over the Stone of Tymora.\nAsbeel was to watch the bearers of the stone without interfering, only acting to ensure that upon the death of the current bearer, the Stone found its way to the next bearer.\nAt some point during the centuries of watching over the bearers, Asbeel became disenchanted with his role and began interfering, even slaying more than a few of the bearers. For this, Asbeel was cursed to wear the visage of a demonic elf any time he was not in a temple to one of the Sisters of Luck.\nAsbeel became an arch-enemy of Maimun.\nHe had a demonic phylactery housed inside Brevindon Margaster and they worked in tandem."
