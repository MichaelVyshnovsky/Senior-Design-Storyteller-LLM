'''Syleen Wintermoon''' was the leader of the [[Stone-Cold Reavers]], a group of reckless adventurers who made their living sometimes as sellswords and sometimes as brigands.

==Description==
Syleen was a lean woman with red hair that she wore in a ponytail.

==Personality==
Syleen went on risky adventures, enjoying the adrenaline rush that they brought. She had a brash demeanor and was a notorious liar, assuming the people around her to be dishonest as well.

==History==
Syleen grew up in [[Neverwinter]], before becoming an adventurer and eventually the leader of the Stone-Cold Reavers. The group tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] from its lair, [[Icespire Hold]]. However, Cryovain hadn't amassed any treasure yet.
