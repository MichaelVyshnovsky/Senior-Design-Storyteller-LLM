Syleen Wintermoon was the leader of the Stone-Cold Reavers, a group of reckless adventurers who made their living sometimes as sellswords and sometimes as brigands.
Syleen was a lean woman with red hair that she wore in a ponytail.
Syleen went on risky adventures, enjoying the adrenaline rush that they brought. She had a brash demeanor and was a notorious liar, assuming the people around her to be dishonest as well.
Syleen grew up in Neverwinter, before becoming an adventurer and eventually the leader of the Stone-Cold Reavers. The group tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young white dragon Cryovain from its lair, Icespire Hold. However, Cryovain hadnt amassed any treasure yet.
