==Relationships==
Crowell was a son to Oliver and [[Kroyce Tefoco]], and had a number of siblings. The oldest of them was [[Bubbles Tefoco]], who lived in the [[Stonyeyes]] district of the Gate with her family and the newborn [[Dorimara]]. another older sibling was [[Dariel Tefoco]] who served the [[Flaming Fist]]. Thegglis' brother [[Thegglis Tefoco|Thegglis]] was a fellow caravan guard, and the youngest siblings [[Hemjax Tefoco|Hemjax]], [[Maggie Tefoco|Maggie]], and others, still lived with Oliver and Kroyce as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] threatened Baldur's Gate's safety, Thegglis and Crowell were stuck with their [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]] caravan at [[Boareskyr Bridge]]. The caravan's return to the gate was postponed due to the cult's threat and the city gates being closed. During their travels, the older caravan guards taught Thegglis and Crowell much of the trade, according to the letter home Thegglis penned for Crowell, who could not yet write.
