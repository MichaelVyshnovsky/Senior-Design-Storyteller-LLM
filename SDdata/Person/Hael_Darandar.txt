'''Hael Darandar''' was a [[human]] from [[Skelkor]], [[Laerakond]], and the main diplomat of that empire as of [[1479 DR]].

==Background==
As of 1479 DR, the Empress [[Dragon]] [[Gauwervyndhal]] had tasked Darandar to improve the diplomatic and commercial relationships of Skelkor with the other countries of Laerakond. However, most people didn't trust Darandar because of the reputation of the dragon empire.
