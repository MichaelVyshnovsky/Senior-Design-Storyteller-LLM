Nerren Prentiyuel was the Magister from  to . He was the founder of short-lived settlement of Liontongue in the Shining Lands.
He was calm, careful, shy, and soft-spoken, and hated traveling. He lacked the scheming, ambitions, and diversions of mightier mages of his time, such as those of Myth Drannor.
Though he lacked the fame, accomplishments, and might of the leading mages of the day, but he had created a number of spells, such as slow cold, a spell that chilled large quantities of foodstuffs and which guaranteed him riches. He had also begun creating some new and variant combination spells at the time of receiving the office.
After extensive consultation with Mystra and Azuth, he decided that he would sooner approach the task of spreading magic by creating his own settlement to teach magic than by traveling himself. Accordingly, he founded Liontongue on the banks of the Liontongue River.
Nerren was slain by five mages, but slew them as he died. However, this left Liontongue leaderless, and his pupils slew each other, being in turn slain by brigands who sought the bounty of Liontongue. The hamlet was reduced to barely foundations only thirty years after his death.
