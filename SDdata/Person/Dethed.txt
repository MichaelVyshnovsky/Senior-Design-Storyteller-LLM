'''Dethed''' the Death Lich was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] and [[lich]] who formulated several death-based [[spell]]s.

==Personality==
The Death Lich was obsessed with death. He spent much of his life in an isolated environment studying [[death magic]] in the [[Ioulaum (enclave)|enclave of Ioulaum]]. Dethed devoted much of his life to creating spells that trapped and killed living beings, which he enjoyed a great deal.

==History==
Dethed was born in {{YearlinkConvert|1869|NY}}. At only 25 years old, the talented arcanist turned himself into a lich. Dethed's deathly antics finally caught up to him in {{YearlinkConvert|2021|NY}}. As he took no students of his own, he performed spells on an apprentice of another Netherese arcanist. Dethed took control of the apprentice with his ''trap the soul spell'', which was frowned upon by the enclave's archwizard, Ioulaum. Ioulaum himself killed the Death Lich after he found this out.
