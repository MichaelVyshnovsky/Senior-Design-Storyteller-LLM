        "mainbody": "'''Bundrigo Dalastarra''' was a [[halfling]] man of the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]]. In the mid–14th century [[DR]], he held the civic official position of the [[Regent of City Works]] and the heraldic office of [[The Ravencoat]], but proved rampantly corrupt.",
        "Personality": "Bundrigo was cheerful and good-natured, though also considered sly.",
        "History": "Bundrigo Dalastarra held the position of Regent of City Works in Ravens Bluff for a number of years. In that position, he operated a huge and well-oiled system of bribery, kickbacks, and informers, the greatest ever known in Ravens Bluff. He paid his hardworking officials well, though some believed the money ultimately came from pirates.\n\nBundrigo died during Ravens Bluff's war with [[Myrkyssa Jelan]] in the summer of the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], though he was nowhere near the fighting. An unknown killer hacked him multiple times with a heavy bladed weapon, then left his body as a heap of smoldering ashes.\n\nScandal erupted as all Bundrigo's crimes were uncovered, with all his closest aides and associates implicated in his misdeeds. [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Arvin Kothonos]] had a difficult time finding anyone in the Regency with any experience who wasn't tainted by Bundrigo's web of corruption. Finally, Kothonos appointed the low-ranking but honest [[Lastraeya Indomurr]] as Acting Regent. She soon overhauled the Regency and left not even a whiff of corruption.",
