'''Krikendolt''' was an unusual [[barbazu]] in [[Avernus]], first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During one of the many battles of the [[Blood War]], a [[vrock]] hit Krikendolt's head, causing him a brain injury that unknown to everyone switched his alignment to [[chaotic good]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1494}},{{BG-DiA-time}} [[Zariel]] ordered Krikendolt and four of his fellows to burn Avernus trees before they grew into thickets and blossomed with [[abyssal chicken]]. However, Krikendolt pitied the chickens and when his companions found about this, they started to pressure him to kill the chickens or face death.
