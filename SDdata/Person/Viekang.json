She \"cured\" him of his randomized teleportation ability.\nOn Returning Day, in the , Viekang interrupted Grand Duke Abdel Adrian when he was addressing the Baldurian citizens within the marketplace of Baldurs Gate. He and his allies assaulted the Grand Duke and a chaotic fight broke out.\nIt was unknown which of the two men died in the battle, but it was clear that the victor transformed into the Slayer. The monstrous creature was subsequently defeated by the combined efforts of the Watch and band of visiting adventurers. Unbeknownst to all, the death of the final two Bhaalspawn and Bhaals avatar resulted in the god of murders return to the Faerûnian pantheon."
