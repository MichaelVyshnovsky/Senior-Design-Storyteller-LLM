Wanting to become a hero, Szordrin instead secretly infiltrated the Keep in order to kill the [[dwarven]] king [[Connerad Brawnanvil]].\n\nHe used a secret passage to enter the keep with some orc minions but, while exploring a passage, he was discovered and defeated by an adventuring party. Before he could tell much, Szordrin was killed by his magic ''[[mask of whispers]]''.",
