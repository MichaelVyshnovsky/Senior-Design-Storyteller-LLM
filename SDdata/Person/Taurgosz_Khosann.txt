'''Taurgosz Khosann''' was the leader of the [[Blacktalons]] mercenary company based in [[Iriaebor]].

==Description==
He stood over {{SI|7|ft}} tall, weighed about {{SI|350|lb|k}} and had strength enough to wield some two-handed weapons in one hand.

==Personality==
Tenhammer ruled with an iron fist and only listened to a few close and trusted allies.

==Possessions==
His favorite weapon was his huge [[warhammer]]. He wore a magical suit of [[chain mail]] to battle.

==History==
He earned his nickname, "Tenhammer," while bidding to take over the leadership of the Blacktalons some time during the 1350s [[DR]]. He was said to have slayed ten people with a single swing from his hammer.

Under his leadership the Blacktalons became a more reputable and less criminal organization.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Taurgosz and his Blacktalons worked along side the mercenaries of the [[Chill]] during the [[iron crisis]] of that year. The two groups led raids on caravans traveling along the [[Coast Way]], delivering any iron they recovered to their overseer [[Tazok]]. While Taurgosz and the leader of the Chill believed they were working for the [[Zhentarim]], they were in fact being used as puppets by [[Sarevok Anchev]] and the [[Iron Throne]].
