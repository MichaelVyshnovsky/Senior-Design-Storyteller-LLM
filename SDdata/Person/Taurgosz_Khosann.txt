Taurgosz Khosann was the leader of the Blacktalons mercenary company based in Iriaebor.
He stood over  tall, weighed about  and had strength enough to wield some two-handed weapons in one hand.
Tenhammer ruled with an iron fist and only listened to a few close and trusted allies.
His favorite weapon was his huge warhammer. He wore a magical suit of chain mail to battle.
He earned his nickname, "Tenhammer," while bidding to take over the leadership of the Blacktalons some time during the 1350s DR. He was said to have slayed ten people with a single swing from his hammer.
Under his leadership the Blacktalons became a more reputable and less criminal organization.
In the , Taurgosz and his Blacktalons worked along side the mercenaries of the Chill during the iron crisis of that year. The two groups led raids on caravans traveling along the Coast Way, delivering any iron they recovered to their overseer Tazok. While Taurgosz and the leader of the Chill believed they were working for the Zhentarim, they were in fact being used as puppets by Sarevok Anchev and the Iron Throne.
