'''Marchyan the "Mad Witch"''' was a woman who lived secluded in the [[Thunder Peaks|Thunder Peak mountains]] in the eastern region of [[Cormyr]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She lived within an alpine citadel and commanded an army of [[orc]]s that served her bidding.

==History==
In [[Ches]] of [[1356 DR]], a herdsman traveled into her refuge, finding all of her orc thralls dead, and Marchyan in a complete stupor, repeatedly and ceaselessly saying the words: ''Dove! Dove! Smashed the black star...''. Her body was burned by the herder before he reported his discovery to the merchants of nearby [[Arabel]].
