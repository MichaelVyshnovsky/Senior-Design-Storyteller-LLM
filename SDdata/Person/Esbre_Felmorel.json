        "Activities": "Esbre Felmorel habitually hosted banquets in his castle.",
        "History": "He had faced at least one [[fiend]] at some point prior to {{yearlink|761}}. Later, he came to be under spell-thrall from his wife Nasmaerae.\n\nIn spring of the {{yearlinkName|761}}, Esbre Felmorel hosted a banquet that was attended by Barundryn Harbright, Thessamel Arunder, and a mysterious wanderer, called only [[Elminster Aumar|Wanlorn]]. The dinner led to many digressions about philosophy, history, and governance. The wandering Wanlorn was seeking a woman by the name of [[Dasumia]], and Esbre briefly mentioned the Lady of Shadows who ruled lands to the east.\n\nNasmaerae tried to steal magic from a sleeping Wanlorn's mind that night. In response, [[Azuth]] warned her not to, and broke all her spells, including the one holding her husband thrall to her; he also informed her that if she tried to do any of that again, the means of her prying would be taken from her. Esbre immediately came to her with a dozen soldiers, and forced her to employ the spell again, most likely having been informed by Azuth himself as well. The spell required his chamberpot and a knife, which he had his soldiers provide. With the casting, her magic was shorn from her by Azuth's power. Lord Esbre then declared they'd worship Azuth in that house forevermore.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|559-562|3}}\n\nDuring the chaos of the [[Art]] in the {{yearlinkName|767}}, Esbre Felmorel's wizards were unable to cast spells; he was resolute to continue standing in force against all foes, though his wife was less sanguine about it.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|723|19}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "His feasts had a good reputation, and those who spoke of him in fear preferred to use his moniker of \"the Mantimera\".{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|549|3}}"
