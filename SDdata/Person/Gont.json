        "History": "Gont was fighting a drow war party with his group near the gates of [[Ust Natha]], where he became trapped by a device known as the Facet sphere. He was not trapped in the strange device for too long, because his mind was still sound. He may have been freed by [[Gorion's Ward]], and after this, Gont told them of the surrounding areas, such as a [[kuo-toa]] camp to the east."
