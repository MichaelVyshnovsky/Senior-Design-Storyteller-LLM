        "mainbody": "Gont of Riatavin was a human thief from Riatavin who became trapped in the right-most chamber of the Facet sphere whilst fighting a group of drow in 1368 DR.\nHe fought with a standard short sword and leather armor.\nGont was fighting a drow war party with his group near the gates of Ust Natha, where he became trapped by a device known as the Facet sphere. He was not trapped in the strange device for too long, because his mind was still sound. He may have been freed by Gorions Ward, and after this, Gont told them of the surrounding areas, such as a kuo-toa camp to the east."
