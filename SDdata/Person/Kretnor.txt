'''Kretnor''' was the shaman and healer of the [[Golden Mane]] [[wemic]] pride that roamed across [[the Shaar]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. A devour follower, she led the worship of [[Nobanion]] within the tribe, particularly on [[Festival of the Pride|holy days]] and organized offerings to the King of Beasts.{{Cite web enhancement/Wemic Camp|4}}

==Description==
She was a particularly beautiful lioness, with striking red hair and a number of tattoos of beasts on her arms and face.

==Activities==
Kretnor was a skilled healer, and spent much of her time crafting restorative items such as ''[[potions of healing]]'', unguents, and [[Keoghtom's ointment|salves]].

Every once in a while, to keep her skill and prove her abilities to herself and the rest of her pride, Kretnor would escape for a couple days to hunt on her own. She would usually return with a large, and often dangerous, quarry. Kretnor looked forward to when she could transform into the shape of other animals.

==Relationships==
In addition to the worship and healing services she provided to the pride, Kretnor was a spiritual advisor, particularly to their leader [[Shaq'ar]]. While Kretnor was greatly appreciated for all she did for her kin, the fact that Shaq'ar only used her abilities as a healer during combat or hunts left her feeling restricted and unappreciated.

She was greatly aided by her [[hawk]] companion [[Silvin]], who acted as a scout for both Kretnor and the Golden Manes.

==Possessions==
Among Kretnor's possessions were a ''[[ring of animal friendship]]'' and a clear spindle ''[[ioun stone]]''.

==History==
Kretnor had borne three cubs in her life, all males who would go on to lead prides of their own.

Upon his return to the pride, the dark wemic [[Beren]] began courting Kretnor, which continued on for some time. While she appreciated his interest, her intuition about his true nature told her not to give in to his advances.
