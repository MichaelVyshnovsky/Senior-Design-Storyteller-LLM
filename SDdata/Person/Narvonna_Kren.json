        "mainbody": "Narvonna Kren was the Red Wizard zulkir of evocation in Thay during the 13 and 14 centuries DR. She was also the founder of the influential Kren family, which held strong in Thay for well over a hundred years.\nIn 1201 DR, Kren formed an alliance with her fellow zulkirs Szass Tam and Nymor Thrul, in an attempt to invade the lands of nearby Aglarond. The necromancer lich Tam and the illusionist Thrul were masters of opposing schools of magic and thus were extremely mistrustful of one another. Kren, who was newly appointed to the Council of Zulkirs, was forced to navigate the potential dangers of this precarious coalition.\nWhile Tam assaulted the Watchwall with undead hordes, the legion of gnolls, orcs, and human soldiers snuck through the Yuirwood into Aglarond. Unfortunately, the undisciplined soldiers became bogged down in the forest and were intercepted by the full forces of the Gray Sisters. Szass Tam and Nymor Thrul blamed one another for the fiasco, and their bickering led to the death of the great illusionist. However, Narvonna Kren emerged from the conflict as a level-headed leader with a strong reputation among her fellow leaders in Thay.\nNarvonna died while fighting in the country of Rashemen in the year 1347 DR. Her daughter, Azhir attempted to avenge her death with a number of attempted invasions into the northeastern realm."
