        "mainbody": "'''Narvonna Kren''' was the [[Red Wizard]] [[zulkir]] of [[evocation]] in [[Thay]] during the 13{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. She was also the founder of the influential [[Kren]] family, which held strong in Thay for well over a hundred years.",
        "History": "In [[1201 DR]], Kren formed an alliance with her fellow zulkirs [[Szass Tam]] and [[Nymor Thrul]], in an attempt to invade the lands of nearby [[Aglarond]]. The [[necromancer]] [[lich]] Tam and the [[illusionist]] Thrul were masters of opposing [[school of magic|schools of magic]] and thus were extremely mistrustful of one another. Kren, who was newly appointed to the [[Council of Zulkirs]], was forced to navigate the potential dangers of this precarious coalition.\n\nWhile Tam assaulted the [[Watchwall]] with [[undead]] hordes, the legion of [[gnoll]]s, [[orc]]s, and [[human]] soldiers snuck through the [[Yuirwood]] into Aglarond. Unfortunately, the undisciplined soldiers became bogged down in the forest and were intercepted by the full forces of the [[Gray Sisters]]. Szass Tam and Nymor Thrul blamed one another for the fiasco, and their bickering led to the death of the great illusionist. However, Narvonna Kren emerged from the conflict as a level-headed leader with a strong reputation among her fellow leaders in Thay.\n\nNarvonna died while fighting in the country of [[Rashemen]] in the year [[1347 DR]]. Her daughter, [[Azhir Kren|Azhir]] attempted to avenge her death with a number of attempted invasions into the [[Northeast Faer√ªn|northeastern]] realm."
