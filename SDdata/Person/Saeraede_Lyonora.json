        "mainbody": "human\nSaeraede Lyonora, better known as the Slayer, was a Netherese human sorceress turned into a unique undead creature that awakened in the midâ€“8 century and went on a slaying rampage following Elminster Aumar.\nWhen not slaying mindlessly, Saeraede was charming, but duplicitous and depraved, with utter scorn for anyones life save her own, and very deliberate about its depravity. Also, despite it issuing from her, the twinkling sound she made while moving really got on her nerves.\nMost of the time, the Slayer was just a faintly visible mist, which made a sound like bells as it moved. It could turn into a whirlwind, or take other forms, becoming a morass of claws and jaws.\nWhen aping the form she had in life, Saeraede Lyonora had green eyes, glossy black hair to her slim waist, broad shoulders, and tufty eyebrows, though she made a point of projecting a figure that was taller, slimmer, and more buxom than she remembered herself to be.\nThe Slayer possessed a startling ability to devour living flesh in less than a heartbeat, leaving little but bones behind As a formless thing, she was able to flow through small cracks, even shutter chinks. It also had the ability to turn into a ghostly mass of jaws, with barbed tentacles and long claws protruding from it. It was able to thwart many wards easily, though upon taking damage in that shape, it returned to its mist form. When it had drawn enough power, the Slayer could even thwart the magic of gods.\nSaeraede Lyonora was also a sorceress, and could cast at least one offensive, acidic spell, capable of reducing a man to sludge in moments. Her ghostly form was susceptible to spells such as shatterstar, which targeted incorporeal entities. She could also project images, and scry with spellspheres, even towards distant mages. Given time, she could also warp existing magic, no matter how powerful, to ensure it responded only to her touch. While she could coalesce enough to move physical objects, that required her to expend much energy that she could only recover by stealing lifeforce.\nSaeraede collected a number of feminine dresses in particular from passing caravans one of them was blue and ruffled, one was black with slits, and another was red, with gem-highlighted dragons along the hips.\nIn her undeath, Saeraede had taken two lovers, both of which she drained to death Brandagaeris and Sardon.\nSaeraede Lyonora considered that in life, she had been a feared sorceress.\nShe was later disturbed, first by the Chosen of Mystra Elminster Aumar, and then, years later, by a nameless band of adventurers that included Iyriklaunavan, an elf wizard, and Nuressa, a warrior, on Mirtul of the . Elminster Aumar had become trapped in the tomb somehow and, after being disturbed by the adventurers, escaped. Shortly after, the runes went haywire and a strange mist was released from the giant coffin the Slayer perceived that the creatures that had disturbed the tomb still lived.\nLater, in mid-spring of the , the mist followed Elminster Aumar, who had first disturbed its grave, to Castle Felmorel it followed him inside, and when he left in the middle of the night, it followed him outside. Along the way, it took a detour, passing through Torntlars Farm, where the farmer Habaertus Ilynker swung his hoe into the misty body out of curiosity. The mist struck him, leaving only a wind-scoured skeleton. The misty entity continued to pursue Elminster, lingering longer in places where hed been, like the hill near Tressets Ringyl, where it showed signs of distraction and hunger. Afterwards, it headed for the path between Aerhiots Field and Salopars Field, where it consumed the farmer Nuglar and his three oxen.\nThe entity then resumed its tracking, heading for Moonshorn Tower, where Elminster had been. There, it somehow forced the doors open, and flowed up into the repository for Netherese texts and trinkets. There, it was interrupted by the tower guardian, Mardasper Oblyndrin, who struck it with a shatterstar spell though it was effective, she endured it and retaliated, killing him with a spell.\nIn the , the entity assaulted the tower of Yintras Bedelmrin, devouring all the deer that grazed around it one night before squeezing in through a window that was ajar. It was, however, repelled by the mage, who was wielding a blessing from Azuth himself. At some point during or after the crowning of the sorceress Dasumia as queen of Galadorna, the mysterious being assaulted Glymril Gard, slaying the mage Klandaerlas Glymril, the Master of Wyverns in that isolated castle. Late into the year, it remained close to Elminster and followed him into Galadorna when he became the Court Mage, staying near the spires of the House of the Unicorn the entity fled into the streets after the goddess Mystra revealed herself.\nLater, it had taken residence in a ruined keep between Starmantle and Westgate, which belonged to Karsus of Netheril, whom Saeraede Lyonora had been aware of. This structure was called Karsus Keep.\nIn the early spring of the , the monster had gained the nickname of \"the Slayer\" after settling in a section of the forest near Starmantle between Oggles Stream and Rairdrun Hill, and completely depopulating it of any animal life larger than a mouse, giving the area the name the Dead Place. It also eliminated merchants that passed by, livestock that got too close, farmers, woodsmen, a patrol of Duke Horostoss men, and even a large force led by a priest of Tempus. The thing was not spotted by griffon riders the Duke sent a band of adventurers after it, the Frostfire Banner, which it eliminated without encountering any difficulties. Afterwards, it schemed to lure mages to Karsuss Keep.\nEventually, no one in Reth or Westgate would take on the assignment of slaying the monster, having heard of the fate of all who faced the Slayer. She managed to draw Elminster to the Keep, where he was attacked by adventurers she killed the adventurers and then lured him with her own twinkling down a well, leading him into a hidden throne room.\nSaeraede Lyonora cast a spell to shut the well entrance, to trap Elminster there without him noticing, and then pretended to require a ritual to be freed. Upon being freed, she promised Elminster the use of those runes and their secrets. She then tried to trick him into a different casting, Saeraede protected Elminster in those last few moments, to ensure she could feed on him herself. However, just as she was on the cusp of regaining full form and life, she was stabbed through the heart by Ilbryn Starym. When he pulled his sword out to try and strike at Elminster, Saeraedes bulk exploded furiously, reducing Ilbryn to ash in return."
