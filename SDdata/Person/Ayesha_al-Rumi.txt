Ayesha al-Rumi was a holy slayer inhabiting Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Ayesha wore bright white robes that covered her entire body save for her intense dark eyes.
As the most skilled agent of the Flamedeath Fellowship in Huzuz, Ayesha spent most of her time in a hidden temple to Kossuth. She was aware that Qirmiz min Hudid thought of her as a rival for the attention of men, so she avoided her at all cost, focusing her time on more important matters such as converting followers to Kossuth and punishing those who resisted.
