Lord Ilphemon was an Imaskari nobleman. After the fall of the Empire, he founded the city of Deep Imaskar, which his successors ruled for nearly two thousand years.
In the year -2488 DR, Lord Ilphemon fled to an uncharted corner of the Underdark with a small group of retainers and family. These Imaskari refugees fled in  to the Underdark, taking the Third Imaskarcana with them in -2481 DR, Lord Ilphemon would found the city of Deep Imaskar in the Earthroot area of the Underdark. He commissioned a written story of the Imaskar at some point, which would be kept in the Purple Library of Deep Imaskar.
His descendants would rule Deep Imaskar until -634 DR when a cabal of necromancers overthrew them.
