'''Kazmil-urshula-kelloakizilian''', or '''Urshula''', was a [[black dragon]] who claimed to be the progenitor of all black dragons in the [[Bloodstone Lands]]. He became a [[dracolich]] around [[1368 DR]], with his spirit found in a [[phylactery]] concealed in a [[book of creation]], a relic of the Witch-King [[Zhengyi]].

{{Quote|You are of the inferior race, the short-lived and infirm. You presume the death of Urshula, but Urshula is older than the oldest memories of your race. And Urshula will remain when the memory of you has faded from all the world!|Urshula}}

==History==
Urshula was already an ancient and powerful wyrm with his own [[goblin]] worshipers by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] when a party of [[Dwarf|dwarves]] awoke him slumbering in a bog near the town of [[Palischuk]] in [[Vaasa]], and the dragon proceeded to attack the town, enraged that people had settled on "his" land. This caught the attention of the Witch-King Zhengyi in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, and the [[lich]] began courting the dragon with offers of dracolichdom.

Years later, in [[1368 DR]], Urshula's soul was used to power one of [[Zhengyi's relics]], a book of creation, and reformed in a large chamber in the lower parts of a [[Castle Perilous]] replica.

He was fought by a party comprising [[Artemis Entreri]], [[Jarlaxle]], [[Athrogate]], and a few others, eventually losing the battle. Urshula's half-decomposed dragon body was mostly destroyed by a magical dragon pendant, designed to be hung over doorways as a defensive ward, owned by Artemis Entreri (gifted to him by Jarlaxle). Once more, Urshula's spirit became trapped in the dragon phylactery, one of two (similarly working) phylacteries in Jarlaxle's possession.
