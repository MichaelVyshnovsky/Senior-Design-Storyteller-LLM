Kazmil-urshula-kelloakizilian, or Urshula, was a black dragon who claimed to be the progenitor of all black dragons in the Bloodstone Lands. He became a dracolich around 1368 DR, with his spirit found in a phylactery concealed in a book of creation, a relic of the Witch-King Zhengyi.
Urshula was already an ancient and powerful wyrm with his own goblin worshipers by the midâ€“14 century DR when a party of dwarves awoke him slumbering in a bog near the town of Palischuk in Vaasa, and the dragon proceeded to attack the town, enraged that people had settled on "his" land. This caught the attention of the Witch-King Zhengyi in the , and the lich began courting the dragon with offers of dracolichdom.
Years later, in 1368 DR, Urshulas soul was used to power one of Zhengyis relics, a book of creation, and reformed in a large chamber in the lower parts of a Castle Perilous replica.
He was fought by a party comprising Artemis Entreri, Jarlaxle, Athrogate, and a few others, eventually losing the battle. Urshulas half-decomposed dragon body was mostly destroyed by a magical dragon pendant, designed to be hung over doorways as a defensive ward, owned by Artemis Entreri (gifted to him by Jarlaxle). Once more, Urshulas spirit became trapped in the dragon phylactery, one of two (similarly working) phylacteries in Jarlaxles possession.
