        "Description": "Alyana's appearance remained unknown and it was said that even the Grand Caliph himself had never seen her without her veil. She usually wore blue robes with rich brocade from the finest [[Umara]]n fabrics. While in public her face was hidden behind a veil, which only revealed her steel gray eyes.",
        "Personality": "The vizier was a formidable and independent woman, who spurned any and all suitors. She deemed loneliness a small price to pay for her independence and position in Huzuz.",
        "Possessions": "Alyana possessed a ''[[ring of wizardry]], [[ring of protection]] +3, [[bracers of defense]] AC 3, [[staff of the winds]], [[wand of paralyzation]]'', and numerous potions and scrolls.",
        "History": "Alyana was the central figure at court in Huzuz for four straight decades. She was also the royal tutor for the Grand Caliph for many years and still treated him like an insolent student long after their formal lessons ended.  Alyana even moved her living quarters to the royal place in order to keep a closer eye on him and make sure he did not lapse back into his adventuring ways.\n\nShe was in charge of the [[Magical Legion]] and procured many of their unique supplies."
