        "History": "Telarthir lived many centuries before [[1372 DR]], and by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], he, nor his dynasty, nor his kingdom was remembered. His final resting place was within a well-hidden tomb in the [[Brush of Barbs]] of [[Delimbiyr Vale]]. [[Telarthir's tomb]]'s location was known to only few and several maps that led to it existed and were sold for mere change, though to be fakes.\n\nIn his eternal rest, Telarthir was preserved as a [[warrior mummy]] who along with his servant [[skeleton warrior]]s guarded the tomb. An unwitting aspiring adventurer [[Fernigold the Younger]] gained entrance to the tomb but was slain by the mummy."
