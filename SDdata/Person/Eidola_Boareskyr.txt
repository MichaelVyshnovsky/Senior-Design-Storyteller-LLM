'''Eidola of Neverwinter''', a scion of the [[Boareskyr]] family, was the bride of [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] in [[1371 DR]]{{DDTS}}. Their marriage was instrumental in securing a trade route between [[Waterdeep]] and [[Kara-Tur]].
{{quote|I comfort myself with the thought of her beauty. Somewhere, her bright, silvery eyes look upon something. Somewhere, her long auburn hair casts its shadow on some rock or blade of [[grass]]. Her smile, with its thousand mysteries and thousand thousand promises, somewhere enchants someone.|Piergeiron the Paladinson}}

==Description==
Eidola had bright, silvery eyes, long auburn hair, and pearly white teeth.

==Personality==
Eidola was outgoing and focused on the things she wanted to achieve. She was not cruel, but was very demanding and adored luxury.

==Abilities==
Eidola was a capable fighter who knew her way around [[plate armor]] and a [[sword]]. She was able to fight off a doppelganger with nothing but a hot iron brand bar.

The doppelganger who consumed Eidola and assumed her personality and identity, also devoured several other creatures, giving her a selection of shapes and abilities to take on. These shapes included a [[shadow mastiff]], a [[giant crocodile]], an [[elf|elven]] wizard named [[Jarin]].

==Relationships==
Eidola very quickly charmed Piergeiron with both her personality and looks. It helped that she was the striking image of his long-dead love [[Shaleen]], whom he was often thinking about later in life.

[[Rulathorn]], the commander of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] of Waterdeep thought Eidola of Neverwinter to be artificially beautiful, cold and calculating, and that when she lovingly looked into Piergeiron's eyes, she looked at her own reflection in them.

==History==
Lady Eidola met her husband-to-be Piergeiron when he followed a scream to the side of a road. The young field-plate-armor-wearing woman was shaking a tree in front of her. The screaming was coming from a [[kobold]] on the tree who'd stolen Eidola's money purse. Piergeiron offered to help, and without waiting for acceptance started chopping the tree with his battleax. Only after the tree fell he noticed that the kobold had been coaxed off the tree a while before by Eidola using a piece of jerky. She quickly made a scaly friend and captured Paladinson's heart. Unbeknownst to all but [[Khelben Arunsun]] and [[Aleena Paladinstar]], Lady Eidola was killed and consumed by a [[greater doppelganger]] of the [[Unseen]]. The aberrant shapeshifters used a long-trapped soul of one of Piergeiron's wives â€“ Shaleen, to mold shapeshifter Eidola's appearance and personality. The Unseen planned on magically enslaving the Open Lord and ruling through him over the City of Splendors.

At some point, Khelben and Aleena came up with a temporary plan to render the doppelganger harmless. Open confrontation was out of question as Eidola exerted some strange influence over her paramour. The Blackstaff and his apprentice crafted an [[enchanted]] ''[[girdle of righteousness]]'' that locked the greater doppelganger into its current personality and shape. They managed to trick Eidola into putting the [[belt]] on and its magic effectively turned her into an ordinary human woman, unable to remove the girdle.

On the [[Eleint 17|17{{th}}]] and the [[Eleint 18|18{{th}}]] of [[Eleint]], the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep Piergeiron Paladinson and Eidola of Neverwinter held a lavish wedding ceremony at the Chapel of Ao in [[Piergeiron's Palace]].

The wedding was also used to create a trading pact with the Boareskyr family allowing the caravans from Waterdeep to pass through [[Boareskyr Bridge]], making many factions of Waterdeep unhappy. Piergeiron was worried about Eidola's safety and had his trusted bodyguard [[Madeiron Sunderstone]] keeping her safe.

The first attempt on Eidola's life came when she was lured away from the guests by a serving girl, in reality, a [[doppelganger]]. Eidola used a hot [[fire poker]] to attack the creature as Piergeiron finished it off.

Another malicious plot against the newlyweds came from a gues, [[Laskar Nesher]]. The fat businessman was attempting to blackmail Eidola with information about her mysterious past. The next nefarious player in the convoluted plot was the [[Master Mariners' Guild]]. Its members were seemingly planning an assassination, foiled by a young noble, [[Kastonoph Nesher|Kastonoph "Noph" Nesher]], son of Laskar.

The third attempt on Eidola's life was stopped by [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]], who confronted and killed a group of doppelgangers posing as the lady's handmaidens during the ceremony. All of the swirling plots though ended up being a mere distraction. A set of beautiful candles given as a wedding gift was used during the ceremony, but summoned a group of [[basal golem]]s that took on the forms of warriors, causing havoc and slaughter in a cloud of magical ''[[darkness]]''. Piergeiron the Paladinson fought bravely but Eidola was abducted and taken to the faraway [[Utter East|Utter East.]]

The blushing bride was abducted by the desperate Mage Emperor [[Aetheric III]] of [[Doegan]], who hoped that Waterdeep would send an army to look for Lady Eidola. The ruler plotted on using the said armies to battle for his kingdom's safety against the army of [[fiend]]s and the [[Fallen Temple]]. Instead, Khelben assembled a small band of paladins to helm the rescue operation. The group included heroes of [[Phlan]], [[Kern Desanea]] and [[Miltiades]]. Secretly, BLackstaff hired an assassin to dispose of the doppelganger making sure she never returned to Waterdeep. The assassin was [[Artemis Entreri]].

Eventually, the paladins found the bride in the royal palace of [[Eldrinpar]] in the kingdom of Doegan. Noph Nesher thinking Eidola was a human, was tricked into removing her ''girdle of righteousness'', unlocking her shapeshifting powers. She revealed her true nature by mangling the youth in her giant crocodile shape.

The doppelganger's body was destroyed by Miltiades and her soul was released from the gem by Khelben Arunsun, sending Eidola into afterlife.
