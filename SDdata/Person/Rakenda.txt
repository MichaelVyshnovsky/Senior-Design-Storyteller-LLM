Entertainer
Rakenda was an elderly tiger who was living out his last years in Marigolds Menagerie in the mid-14 century DR.
Rakenda was rather peaceful and gentle around other people. He always let out a rumbling purr whenever the Menageries proprietor stopped by to see him.
For much of his life Rakenda was one of the animal performers in the Mooney & Sons Circus, where he worked alongside the in-training member Marigold Mufflefoot, until he became too old to continue performing. Marigold worried for weeks that Rakenda might be killed or let loose into the wild, until he came to the idea of the Menagerie and suggested it to Isbeau Navarne, thus insuring that Rakenda could live out the last of his days in peace.
Rakenda was rather popular among the children who visited Marigolds Menagerie and he always attracted an audience whenever he went out into the facilitys exercise yard.
