'''Paereth Vandurn''' was a swordcaptain in [[Suzail]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Paereth Vandurn was a swordcaptain with the [[Purple Dragons]].

==History==
Paereth Vandurn was keeping watch at [[Castle Obarskyr]] in Suzail at some point after [[Mirtul 26]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, before the [[Council of the Dragon]]. When the fugitives [[Storm Silverhand]] and [[Elminster Aumar]] tried to sneak into the castle disguised as the Royal Magician [[Ganrahast]] and Lord Warder [[Vainrence]], Paereth Vandurn was fooled by their disguises, but [[Rorskryn Mreldrake]] spotted them, and pointed out the deception to the swordcaptain. He agreed to hold the two until they could be examined; the two didn't fight.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|172|16}}

Vandurn and his soldiers escorted the men to a holding room to wait; the swordcaptain received a few verbal jabs from the imposters, and a few snickers from his own men throughout the process, which he handled with some difficulty because of the confusing situation.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|181-182|17}}
