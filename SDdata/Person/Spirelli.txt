Spirelli was a giant talking snail who was the only non-human member of the Blade Council of Lomatra in the early 13 century DR.
Spirelli was a human-sized snail. His eyes were on the ends of prehensile eyestalks, which had the habit of swiveling to look at both sides of an argument at once.
Bubbles foamed under his shell when he was upset.
When in battle, he rode on the back of a horse and wore a helmet. 
Spirelli was a very charismatic individual and a persuasive speaker. He could also be underhanded and conniving, using his wealth to further his own ends.
Spirelli was extremely wealthy. He owned two palaces, a golden pleasure barge, and a large mercenary company. He was the owner of about half of Lomatra in the Blade Kingdoms, including the city hall. He was known to travel in a sedan chair.
Spirelli was not originally from Lomatra, although his exact origins were unclear. According to Lorenzo Utrelli, he came to Lomatra around the  from a forest that could have been the Chondalwood. He originally went by a different name, which sounded like Boble-boop. He brought with him a large supply of mother of pearl, which he exchanged for considerable wealth. Following his arrival in Lomatra, Spirelli started paying taxes, which entitled him to citizenship. Over a year later, he became a mercenary commander by hiring a large mercenary company. He spent nearly 200,000 ducats becoming a Blade Captain.
In the winter of the , Spirelli made a late appearance at the meeting of the Blade Council of Lomatra. He argued in favor of Lomatra remaining allies with Sumbria. In their next meeting his vote was interrupted by Miliana Mannicci and Lorenzo Utrelli who used a scheme involving peppercorns to outvote him.
Some weeks later, Spirelli rode alongside Orlando Tropello in the aftermath of the battle with Ugo Svar√©zi, and failed to buy the favor of Orlando or his soldiers.
