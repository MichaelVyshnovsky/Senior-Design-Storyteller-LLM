Sissa was an Ilmatari acolyte that maintained the Shrine of the Suffering.
The residents of Baldurs Gate very much cherished Sissa, their sibling, and father, Brother Hodges.
In 1482 DR, Sissa worked with her father in Baldurs Gate. During this time, neither Sissa nor Hanse were old enough to marry, but were in 1492 DR.
