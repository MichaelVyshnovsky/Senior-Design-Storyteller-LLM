'''Father Jamad''' was the head priest of [[St. Faelar's Cloisters]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
In [[Kythorn]] of 1370, the Cloister suffered an attack of arson, and Father Jamad was one of the survivors and witnesses. He claimed that he saw a "heavily cloaked [[wizard]]" cast and control a ''[[flaming sphere]]'' while laughing. Some suggested this wizard was [[Tara el Viilam]], but Jamad was unable to identify her conclusively.
