Father Jamad was the head priest of St. Faelars Cloisters in 1370 DR.
In Kythorn of 1370, the Cloister suffered an attack of arson, and Father Jamad was one of the survivors and witnesses. He claimed that he saw a "heavily cloaked wizard" cast and control a flaming sphere while laughing. Some suggested this wizard was Tara el Viilam, but Jamad was unable to identify her conclusively.
