Whenever passing through Rothé Valley he made sure to stop by its local village.\nHe took on a boy from Rothé Valley Village as his traveling ward, brining him along on his journeys in the North.\nIn the , Rucksam created his own namesake tunnel in Rothé Valley in order to gain quicker passage between its village and some nearby farms. This won him a wager with the old farmer Fergus Gunderson. Local farmers were taken aback at the appearance of a new and mysterious passageway but accepted the traveling wizards explanation."
