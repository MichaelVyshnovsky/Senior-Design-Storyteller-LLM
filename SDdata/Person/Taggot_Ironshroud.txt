'''Taggot Ironshroud''' was a [[dwarf]] [[adventurer]] from [[Sundabar]] in the [[Silver Marches]] who joined a group of fellow dwarves aiding [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{Quote|Dwarven history is something that should be cherished, not sold.|Taggot}}

==Personality==
He had a strong affinity for the history of the [[dwarven]] people and considered himself an ally of the other free folk of [[the North]].

==Relationships==
He was a companion of [[Skeld Steelhelm]] of [[Mithral Hall]], [[Gord Roundshield]] of [[Citadel Felbarr]], and [[Tori Hammerheart]] of [[Citadel Adbar]].Skeld refers to a "handful of heroes" and lists these four dwarfholds, but only names Gord. As Skeld, Gord, Taggot, and Tori all give Lore entries about their respective dwarfholds and have dwarf-specific quests, it may be assumed that all four were part of the same group.

Taggot was a known associate of Sergeant [[Yates]] of the [[Neverwinter Guard]]. He had a low opinion of one [[Melkhor Goldseeker]], believing him to be greedy, unscrupulous, and a shame to the dwarven people.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the four dwarf companions came to Neverwinter to offer their aid to the beleaguered city.

Taggot worked out of the [[Broken Crown]] inn on the [[High Road]], helping the folks of Neverwinter with the [[Blackdagger Bandits]] that plagued the area around [[Raven Cliff Beach]]. He worked with fellow dwarven adventurers to collapse some [[goblin]] tunnels that were dug into the nearby cliffs.

Also around that time, he led the efforts to search the caves near [[Cragmire Keep]] for artifacts from the ancient dwarven kingdom of [[Delzoun]]. He sought to retrieve them in order to preserve dwarven culture, rather than make a profit of them like the avaricious Melkhor.
