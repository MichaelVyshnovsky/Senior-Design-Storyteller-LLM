        "mainbody": "'''Vlaakith I''', also known as the '''Lich-Queen''', was the second prolific leader of the [[Gith (race)|gith]] people,{{Cite dungeon/100/The Lich-Queen's Beloved|97-98}} and the first of at least one-hundred-fifty-seven rulers of the same title. She began the millennia-long dynasty of [[undead]] queens that ruled over the war-hungry [[githyanki]] of the [[Astral Plane]].",
        "Personality": "While she proved an adept leader, ever-efficient in her manipulations, Vlaakith I was a wholly treacherous individual. She held no true loyalty to her allies, and over time continued to serve only her own selfish interests.",
        "Relationships": "She was once the most trusted advisor of [[Gith]], the singular individual after which both the githyanki and [[githzerai]] peoples were named.",
        "History": "Vlaakith I emerged notable among the gith people when they rebelled against the ancient [[Illithid Empire]], under the leadership of Gith. To garner allies in their struggle,{{Cite dragon/377/Tu'narath City of Death}} Vlaakith I did however compel Gith to descend into the [[Nine Hells]] and meet with [[Ephelomon]], consort to [[Tiamat]], the evil queen of the [[chromatic dragon]]s. A pact between the two powers was forged: [[red dragon]]s were granted to the gith warriors,<ref group=\"note\">The ''[[Monster Manual 5th edition]]'' states Gith herself returned from the Nine Hells. This is contradicted in other source material. The pact was upheld, and many red dragons served Gith's descendents for millenium that followed. Vlaakith would, as Gith supposedly decreed: \"Carry on the Eternal Crusade\" in her name.\n\nAs Gith was forced to enter negotiations on behalf of her people by herself, it appeared to the gith people she had perished. In truth however, Gith sacrificed herself for her peoples' success and continued freedom. Vlaakith meanwhile was given the opportunity needed to seize power for herself.There is some ambiguity in some source material as to which Vlaakith various actions are attributed. ''[[Monster Manual 5th edition]]'' directly refers to to the [[undead]] Vlaakith that replaced Gith as leader of their people. As such, the moniker \"lich-queen\" can still be attributed to her. Additionally, ''[[Dragon magazine 377]]'' refers to the 'Lich Transformation' ritual (capitalized as a proper noun), and suggest it is a common practice among holders of the Vlaakith title. \n\nGith's son [[Orpheus]] was one of the few aware that Vlaakith had betrayed the rebel-queen. He led Gith's honor guard in a second rebellion against Vlaakith I. This conflict came to be known as the [[War of the Comet]]. While Orpheus and Gith loyalists fought with terrible ferocity, the True Heir was bested by Kith'rak [[Voss]] and imprisoned within the ''[[Astral Prism]]''.\n\nAfter the complete ascendance of Vlaakith I as their leader, there emerged a rift between opposing factions of the gith people. [[Zerthimon]] emerged as a powerful spiritual leader who led the emergent [[githzerai]], while Vlaakith I led the githyanki to the [[Astral Plane]],\n\nHaving crushed their immortal foes, Vlaakith realized the war-hungry githyanki people required a singular purpose to keep them united. She made the 'grand proclamation' that the githyanki must be recognized as the true rulers of the Prime Material Plane. Each world within would be theirs for the taking, to shape and remold as she saw fit. Any githyanki warrior that proved themselves in battle could themselves achieve 'ascension', and be welcomed to her divine court."
