        "mainbody": "'''Beniago''' was a lieutenant and later the captain of [[Ship Kurth]] in [[Luskan]]. In reality he was a [[drow]] under the guise of a [[human]] who was a high-ranking lieutenant for [[Bregan D'aerthe]].",
        "Description": "In human form, Beniago appeared as a tall red-haired man. His human disguise did not age (wizards had told him it would be too difficult), so he told others he was a [[half-elf]] so that they did not get suspicious about his longevity or unchanged appearance.\n\nBy [[1484 DR]], Beniago claimed to be more comfortable in his human form than in his natural drow form.",
        "History": "Beniago was previously a member of [[House Baenre]]. The father of his cousin [[Tiago Baenre]] betrayed him, forcing him to join [[Bregan D'aerthe]]. In [[1463 DR]], he was the highest-ranking agent of Bregan D'aerthe, only under [[Jarlaxle]], [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]], and [[Valas Hune]]. Luskan was considered his territory.\n\nIn [[1463 DR]], Beniago was second to Luskan's [[High Captains of Luskan|High Captain]] [[Kurth]]. However, at some point prior to [[1483 DR]], he ascended to become High Captain Beniago Kurth, the most powerful of the five High Captains. Ship Kurth had the largest fleet in the city (twice as large as the next Ship's), largely due to its \"alliance\" with Bregan D'aerthe.",
        "Possessions": "Beniago carried a mysterious jeweled [[dagger]] which strikingly resembled [[Artemis Entreri|Artemis Entreri's]]. Beniago had an earring which enabled him to take the guise of a [[human]].",
        "Relationships": "Beniago was a member of the [[Menzoberranzan|Menzoberranyr]] [[House Baenre]]; he was Matron Mother [[Quenthel Baenre]]'s nephew and [[Tiago Baenre]]'s cousin."
