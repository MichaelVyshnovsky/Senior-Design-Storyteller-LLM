        "mainbody": "eniago was a lieutenant and later the captain of Ship Kurth in Luskan. In reality he was a drow under the guise of a human who was a high-ranking lieutenant for Bregan Daerthe.\nIn human form, Beniago appeared as a tall red-haired man. His human disguise did not age (wizards had told him it would be too difficult), so he told others he was a half-elf so that they did not get suspicious about his longevity or unchanged appearance.\nBy 1484 DR, Beniago claimed to be more comfortable in his human form than in his natural drow form.\nBeniago was previously a member of House Baenre. The father of his cousin Tiago Baenre betrayed him, forcing him to join Bregan Daerthe. In 1463 DR, he was the highest-ranking agent of Bregan Daerthe, only under Jarlaxle, Kimmuriel Oblodra, and Valas Hune. Luskan was considered his territory.\nIn 1463 DR, Beniago was second to Luskans High Captain Kurth. However, at some point prior to 1483 DR, he ascended to become High Captain Beniago Kurth, the most powerful of the five High Captains. Ship Kurth had the largest fleet in the city (twice as large as the next Ships), largely due to its \"alliance\" with Bregan Daerthe.\nBeniago carried a mysterious jeweled dagger which strikingly resembled Artemis Entreris. Beniago had an earring which enabled him to take the guise of a human.\nBeniago was a member of the Menzoberranyr House Baenre he was Matron Mother Quenthel Baenres nephew and Tiago Baenres cousin."
