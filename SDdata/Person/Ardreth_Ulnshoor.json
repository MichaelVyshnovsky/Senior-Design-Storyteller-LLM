        "mainbody": "'''Ardreth Ulnshoor''' was the shopkeep of [[Uncrimmon's Trophies & Sundries]] in [[Mosstone]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Ulnshoor was thought to be a creepy inexpressive man by many residents of Mosstone.",
        "Personality": "Ardreth was mainly interested in his trade and used his magic [[amulet]] to read minds, deterring thieves and scammers. However, he also enjoyed little probing of all of his clients as he liked knowing people he dealt with.",
        "Abilities": "Ardreth Ulnshoor possessed all abilities of [[doppelganger]]s, and he liked to take on the shape of an [[illithid]] to terrify would-be thieves.",
        "Possessions": "Ardreth possessed the ability to read minds, something that spread all sorts of rumors about him throughout the town of Mosstone. In reality, the ability came from his ''[[medallion of ESP]]'', the enchanted item he used to detect and track thieves and scammers. He was also armed with [[blowdart]]s, dipped in sleeping [[poison]].",
        "History": "It was unknown when or how Ardreth Ulnshoorr came to work for [[Uncrimmon]], the mysterious [[beholder]] owner of Uncrimmon's Trophies & Sundries. However, one thing was clear, as per [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s research, Ardreth feared his many-eyed employer.\n\nAt some point, rumors of Ardreth Ulnshoor being an illithid attracted the attention of local [[Harpers]]. The investigation revealed that the shopkeep was, in fact, a doppelganger who was seen shapeshifting into a mind flayer when dealing with thieves. As Ardreth was not doing anything evil, the Harpers left him alone but placed an enchantment on his ''ESP medallion'' that allowed them to listen in when the doppelganger was using the item.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Many Mosstonians believed Ardreth Ulnshoor to be a disguised mind flayer who, on occasion, let the ruse go, exposing his aberrant nature when dealing with thieving customers."
