        "mainbody": "rdreth Ulnshoor was the shopkeep of Uncrimmons Trophies & Sundries in Mosstone in the 14 century DR.\nUlnshoor was thought to be a creepy inexpressive man by many residents of Mosstone.\nArdreth was mainly interested in his trade and used his magic amulet to read minds, deterring thieves and scammers. However, he also enjoyed little probing of all of his clients as he liked knowing people he dealt with.\nArdreth Ulnshoor possessed all abilities of doppelgangers, and he liked to take on the shape of an illithid to terrify would-be thieves.\nArdreth possessed the ability to read minds, something that spread all sorts of rumors about him throughout the town of Mosstone. In reality, the ability came from his medallion of ESP, the enchanted item he used to detect and track thieves and scammers. He was also armed with blowdarts, dipped in sleeping poison.\nIt was unknown when or how Ardreth Ulnshoorr came to work for Uncrimmon, the mysterious beholder owner of Uncrimmons Trophies & Sundries. However, one thing was clear, as per Volothamp Geddarms research, Ardreth feared his many-eyed employer.\nAt some point, rumors of Ardreth Ulnshoor being an illithid attracted the attention of local Harpers. The investigation revealed that the shopkeep was, in fact, a doppelganger who was seen shapeshifting into a mind flayer when dealing with thieves. As Ardreth was not doing anything evil, the Harpers left him alone but placed an enchantment on his ESP medallion that allowed them to listen in when the doppelganger was using the item.\nMany Mosstonians believed Ardreth Ulnshoor to be a disguised mind flayer who, on occasion, let the ruse go, exposing his aberrant nature when dealing with thieving customers."
