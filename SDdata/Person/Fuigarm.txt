'''Fuigarm''' was a mute [[giant]] who served as bodyguard to [[Aman Al-Raqib]] of [[Bralizzar]] near the [[Raurin]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Fuigarm was about {{SI|8'3"|'"|long=yes}} and weighed {{SI|450|pound|k|long=yes}}. His head was completely hairless, with large ears that stuck out. His eyes were small, appearing as pinpoints of light, his face was normally expressionless, and he never smiled.

==Personality==
He was highly observant and very intelligent, and stoic. He was loyal unto death.

==Abilities==
Besides being a skilled fighter, Fuigarm was possessed of heroic strength. He also knew a special sign language, known only to him and to his master. When he protected someone on the streets, the odds of pickpockets were considerably reduced.

==Possessions==
Fuigarm carried an exceedingly powerful magical [[scimitar]], a magical [[dagger]] of superior strength, and a [[silk]] ''[[shirt of protection]] +1'' that provided incredible defense against missiles. He also carried a [[silver]] medallion that marked him as a resident of [[Bralizzar]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1356 DR]], Fuigarm may have been directed by Aman to escort adventurers in his employ around Bralizzar.
