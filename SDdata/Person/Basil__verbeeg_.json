        "Description": "Basil was more than eight feet tall, with gangly arms, stooped shoulders, and thick bowed legs. He had a large belly. His eyebrows and scrawny beard were coarse and gray.",
        "History": "Basil met and befriended [[Tavis Burdun]], just moments before the princess [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] was kidnapped. He and the orphan [[Avner]] accompanied Tavis in the rescue mission. In time, he became a good friend of both Tavis and Brianna. Unfortunately during the final battle against the [[Twilight Spirit]], Basil's body was permanently deformed."
