        "mainbody": "'''Jarhild Stoneforge''' was a [[shield dwarf]] [[fighter]] and a member of the [[Order of the Burning Dawn]].",
        "Personality": "Jarhild was exceptionally brave and protective of others, especially her friends. She valued honor above all, but was also stubborn to a fault. Jarhild did not take kindly to insults, whether about her appearance or her ability. She was always ready for a fight, and was tough, sturdy, and strategically experienced enough to make her a force to be reckoned with. She joined the Order of the Burning Dawn since it allowed her to fight evil and protect the innocent, and get paid doing it.",
        "History": "A member of the proud Stoneforge clan, Jarhild traced her dwarven lineage back to [[Clan Battlehammer]] of [[Mithral Hall]]. She was the daughter of [[Nysrin Stoneforge]] from [[Mirabar]], where her parents had moved just before she was born. She grew up in Mirabar, where her family worked as smiths, and she often helped her father in the forge growing up. Her mother was not always supportive of her adventuring career, and especially after the death of her siblings, Jarhild was pressured to take on the role of sole heir to the Clan. However Jarhild was supported in her choice by her aunt [[Gwennan]], and was even given her old sword as a token of faith.\n\nWhen the Order of the Burning Dawn was nearly wiped out by the [[Knights of the Gilded Eye]], Jarhild joined the effort to avenge her fallen guildmates.She traveled for a time with the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]], as well as [[Illydia Maethellyn]], [[Larethar Gulgrin]], and [[Hommet Shaw]]."
