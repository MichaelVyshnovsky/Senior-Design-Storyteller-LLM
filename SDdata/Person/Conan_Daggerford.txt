Duke Conan Daggerford was the ruler and head–of–state of Daggerford during the early 14 century DR.
Like the other dukes of Daggerford, Conan wielded the duchys sword of state, Lawflame.
He had a son Pryden who went on to succeed him as duke, and another son Llewellyn, who was born out of marriage. Duke Conan eventually granted  his illegitimate son a knighthood. 
Duke Conan was perhaps most well known for granting Daggerford its own sovereign authority. He formed the Council of Guilds and empowered them to run the towns day–to–day operations.
