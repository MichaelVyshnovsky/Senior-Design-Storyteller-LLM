'''Duke Conan Daggerford''' was the ruler and head–of–state of [[Daggerford]] during the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Like the other dukes of Daggerford, Conan wielded the duchy's sword of state, ''[[Lawflame]]''.

==Relationships==
He had a son [[Pryden Daggerford|Pryden]] who went on to succeed him as duke, and another son [[Llewellyn Longhand|Llewellyn]], who was born out of marriage. Duke Conan eventually granted  his illegitimate son a knighthood. 

==History==
Duke Conan was perhaps most well known for granting Daggerford its own sovereign authority. He formed the [[Council of Guilds]] and empowered them to run the town's day–to–day operations.
