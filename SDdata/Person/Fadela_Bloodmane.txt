'''Fadela Bloodmane''' was a member of the [[House of Nasr]] of the [[High Desert]] of [[west Zakhara]], and their likely successor, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p39">

==Personality==
Fadela was a rambunctious individual who thirsted for adventure. 

==Description==
Fadela's nickname, ''Urf-al-Dam'' or Bloodmane, stems from her dark red hair which had the color of dried blood. This rare hair coloration led many to believe her father was a [[janni]] or an outlander.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p39"/> 

==History==
Fadela was captured by accident by [[mamluk]] "recruiters" since they believed her to be an outsider because of her striking hair. Her mother ended up breaking into the tower of Emir [[Hatit Abd al-Wajib]] in [[Qudra]] to demand her release.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p39"/> 

==Relationships==
Fadela was the eldest child of Sheikh [[Nadia umm Fadela]]. [[Amar bin Nadia]] was her younger brother.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p39"/>
