        "Activities": "Ramas owned the [[Angry Coxswain]] tavern located in the central section Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] along the waterfront where [[Odd Street]] joined [[Dock Street (Waterdeep)|Dock Street]]. He was secretly a slaver who worked with his brewer, [[Orth Ironchisel]], to [[magic]]ally transport victims to [[Mulhorand]] via a ''[[Angry Coxswain Portal|portal]]'' found within the tavern. Ramas would employ [[Drejjd]] from the [[Unseen]] so that it would appear the victims had not disappeared."
