'''Marskyn''' was an inhabitant of [[Westgate]] in the mid-8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|767}}, Marskyn had doubled the pay offered to mercenaries for stopping [[the Slayer|Saeraede Lyonora]], on behalf of the Duke of [[Westgate]]. He still couldn't find any more people in the city willing to take the job, however.
