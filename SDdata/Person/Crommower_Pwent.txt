'''Crommower Pwent''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[battlerager]] and a dear friend and traveling companion of [[Gandalug Battlehammer]], the First King of [[Mithril Hall]].Judging by his clan name and relationship to Gandalug, Crommower appears to be a relative, if not a direct ancestor, of [[Thibbledorf Pwent]].

==Description==

Crommower was a dirty dwarf with a black beard and a clean-shaven head to secure the spiked helmet on his head. He wore bladed armor and boasted the furious battlerager mentality.

==History==
Around {{Yearlink|-643}}, Gandalug Battlehammer left Mithril Hall with Crommower and the two adventurers descended into the depths under the dwarven stronghold. 

While exploring, they ran into [[drow]] soldiers, including [[Yvonnel Baenre]], and Crommower died slaying many enemies.
