Crommower Pwent was a dwarven battlerager and a dear friend and traveling companion of Gandalug Battlehammer, the First King of Mithril Hall.Judging by his clan name and relationship to Gandalug, Crommower appears to be a relative, if not a direct ancestor, of Thibbledorf Pwent.
Crommower was a dirty dwarf with a black beard and a clean-shaven head to secure the spiked helmet on his head. He wore bladed armor and boasted the furious battlerager mentality.
Around , Gandalug Battlehammer left Mithril Hall with Crommower and the two adventurers descended into the depths under the dwarven stronghold. 
While exploring, they ran into drow soldiers, including Yvonnel Baenre, and Crommower died slaying many enemies.
