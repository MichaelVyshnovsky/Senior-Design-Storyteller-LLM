Theyre their doors right next to each other with Very Well-Equipped Voyager door to the south and Artful Armourer to the west. Each of the shops had a sign with its name. However, once a customer entered either door, they quickly realized that both doors led to a single. Molars home could be accessed from the back of the shop, and it had a second entrance at the back of the building."
