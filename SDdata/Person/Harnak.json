        "mainbody": "'''Harnak the Butcher''' was a powerful [[hobgoblin]] warrior of the the [[Red Fang]] Marauders in the [[Trollbark Forest]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''You dare oppose me?! HA HA HA! I'll wash this inn's walls with your blood!''|Harnak the Butcher}}",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Red Fang Marauders targeted the environs of [[Baldur's Gate]], striking at traveling caravans from a base that was well hidden and one of its lairs in the caverns of the Trollbark Forest. The goblin raiders attacked [[Randalla Brasshorn]]'s caravan that traveled from [[Waterdeep]] to the Gate, capturing and dragging several caravaners, including Randalla, to the cavern depth. Caravaners who survived rushed to the village of [[Wayfork]], not realizing that it was also under attack by the marauders led by Harnak the Butcher. The hobgoblin broke into the [[Wayfork Inn]] where the raid survivors found shelter. Harnak's butchery came to an end when a group of six heroes confronted the marauders at the inn and slew him."
