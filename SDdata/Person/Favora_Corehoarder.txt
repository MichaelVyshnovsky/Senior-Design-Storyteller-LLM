Favora Corehoarder was a gnome priest of Garl Glittergold living in Gnomengarde in the late 15 century DR.
Favora was courageous and selfless. She was willing to risk her life to protect others.
Favora joined the community of Gnomengarde sometime shortly after it experienced an attack by a rampaging mimic. She was an integral member of the small militia that the tiny kingdom had organized since that event.
