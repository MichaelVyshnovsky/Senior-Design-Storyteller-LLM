In 629 DR, Thanderahast was not yet High Wizard, and suspected Luthax of treachery, when he discovered that Luthax and Elmariel Emmarask were planning to assassinate King Draxius Obarskyr using a magical beast from the ruins of Netheril. Thanderahast was able to warn the King in time and Draxius slew the beast.
By 900 DR, Thanderahast was High Wizard of Cormyr
With his pupil Jorunhast, Thanderahast battled the red dragons in 1018 DR when they invaded Suzail, and helped to extinguish the burning city and Castle Obarskyr using magical weather summoning. He then battled Thauglor on the back of a wyvern, and was badly burned by the dragons acid breath.
