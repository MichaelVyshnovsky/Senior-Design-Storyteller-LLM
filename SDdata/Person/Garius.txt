'''Garius''' was a [[rogue]] active in the [[Moonshae Isles]] during the late 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|32}} 

==Personality==
As a thief, Garius had no issue with harming others for the sake of profit, but he despised those who acted for the sake of wanton cruelty.

==History==
Garius traveled the world before joining the [[Doomed Legion]] to serve Prince [[Ketheryll]] at the [[Castle of Skulls]]. Although bound to serve and protect the Prince, Garius instead came to despise his evil master.

According to local legends on [[Gwynneth]], Garius managed to flee the Castle of Skulls on the night that it became [[curse]]dâ€”the [[Summer Solstice]] in the {{YearlinkName|299}}. However, the truth was that he was caught by Ketheryll, who used his [[magic]] to transform the rogue into a cheap [[tin]] [[knife]].

In the following centuries, the Castle would become a haunted place in which an [[undead]] Ketheryll dwelt. To lure victims to his lair, Ketheryll used his magic to cast [[illusion]]s over Garius to make the cheap knife appear to be made of [[platinum]] and [[gem]]s and then planted him in the nearby forest to attract treasure-hunters. Garius also gained the ability to point in the direction of Ketheryll and the Castle as a way to ensure that adventurers would find their way there.

In the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, the [[halfling]] [[adventurer]] [[Pawldo]] and his companion [[Stefanik]] sought out the castle after the latter found the Garius knife. The pair dared to delve into the castle seeking treasure, but encountered the monstrous Ketheryll. Garius helped them to fight him off by using its pointing power to help Pawldo determine which of multiple copies was the real Ketheryll.
