        "mainbody": "ari Agneh was the former tharchion of Priador, a region and town of Thay.\nMari was deposed by the zulkir Aznar Thrul, who then proclaimed himself tharchion of Priador. Mari appealed to Szass Tam and his allied zulkirs to help her keep her position, but they declined. When Thrul learned of her petition, he took her prisoner to abuse as his slave and sexual plaything.\nThe blood fiend Tsagoth was sent to find her. When he did, he transformed her into a blood fiend–like creature and convinced her to slay Aznar Thrul. During his next attempt at abusing her, Mari revealed her new identity to Thrul and turned into a savage being without conscience. She killed Thrul only to be slain shortly after by the tharchions Red Wizards.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryBlood fiends\nCategoryTharchions\nCategorySlaves\nCategoryInhabitants of Priador\nCategoryInhabitants of Thay\nCategoryInhabitants of the Unapproachable East\nCategoryInhabitants of East Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\n0lqnwi95xxja904k5refmlnq1v1c7oc"
