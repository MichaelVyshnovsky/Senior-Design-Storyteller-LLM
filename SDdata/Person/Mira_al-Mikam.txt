Mira al-Mikam ran a barber shop within the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Young and beautiful, Mira exemplified elven grace.
Mira was well-respected as a barber and singer. She decorated her shop with crystal vases and flowers.
Miras first adventure as a younger elf led to the death off all her companions. She carried a distaste for adventuring with her ever since that tragic event.
