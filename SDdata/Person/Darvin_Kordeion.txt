'''Darvin Kordeion''' was a mage of [[Thentia]]. Though reluctant, he was instrumental to the effort to thwart [[Sammaster]]'s plans in the [[Rage of Dragons]] of the {{yearlinkName|1373}}.{{cite book/The Rage||1}}

==Description==
Darvin was a pink-jowled, plump mage who liked to wear white and silver robes.

==Personality==
Darvin struck most people as nervous, timid, and even cowardly.

==Abilities==
While stalling Sammaster's guardians at the [[Dracorage mythal]], Darvin employed several spells.{{cite book/The Ruin}}

==History==
On the [[Mirtul 27]] meeting of Thentia's guild, Darvin revealed his concerns about working against Sammaster. However, when offered an ultimatum by [[Firefingers]], he relented and agreed to continue. On [[Kythorn 6]], Darvin was one of the wizards that believed the merchants from [[Zhentil Keep]] were involved in the effort to slay the mages working on the decryption, and he was the last to relent.

The imposter amongst the mages attempted to deceive a captured [[Jivex]] and [[Taegan Nightwind]] that he was actually Darvin Kordeion on [[Kythorn 10]], alongside other magical compulsions. On [[Flamerule 8]], he was briefly attacked by Jivex because of this stratagem, but Taegan Nightwind saw through it.
