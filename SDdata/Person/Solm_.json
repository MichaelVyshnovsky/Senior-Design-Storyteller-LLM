        "mainbody": "olmé was one of the seven liches who created Crenshinibon, and was later consumed by it.\nSolmé of Gharr had learned of a way to live for millennia on reaching old age, young children were identified and Solmés life force placed into them. Solmés transformation into a lich came before the last incarnation grew into an adult, so it eternally appeared as a child.\nSolmé was a rival of a fellow lich, Fetchigrol. In order to spawn undead, Solmé would travel to the Shadowfell to directly raise an army, whereas Fetchigrol would reanimate those who had fallen. Fetchigrol believed he had been bested by Solmé."
