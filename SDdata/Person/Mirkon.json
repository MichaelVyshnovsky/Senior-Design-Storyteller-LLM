Afterwards, all the tieflings in the city were exiled from their home and forced to live as refugees in the wilderness. Fortunately, they found temporary safe haven at the [[Emerald Grove]] druidic enclave.\n\nAt some point, Mirkon was wandered outside the enclave and became entranced by a song he heard. The singing unfortunately came from a group of [[harpies]] who were attempting to lure him away to his doom."
