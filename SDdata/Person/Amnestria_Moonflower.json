        "mainbody": "'''Amnestria Moonflower''' (later known as '''Z'beryl''') was the daughter of [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] and [[Zaor Moonflower]] and therefore a princess of [[Evermeet]]. She was also mother to [[Arilyn Moonblade]].",
        "Description": "Amnestria was considered extremely beautiful, a feature inherited from her mother [[Amlaruil Moonflower|Amlaruil]], with the rare and prized hair color of deep blue inherited from her father [[Zaor Moonflower|Zaor]]. Her eyes were blue flecked with gold. Arilyn apparently bore a resemblance to her, as [[Elaith Craulnobur]] mistook Arilyn for Amnestria at first glance.",
        "Personality": "Amnestria was described as possessing a \"rare spirit and inner fire.\"  She was very intelligent and perceptive. She was often lighthearted.  It was said that she possessed an intensity that did not match the serene court of her birthhome in Leuthilspar. [[Elaith Craulnober|Elaith]] viewed her as having a \"humanlike\" nature.",
        "History": "Amnestria inherited [[Arilyn's moonblade|her moonblade]] from her great-aunt, [[Thasitalia]], who had been away from Evermeet. After her death, the moonblade was passed on to Arilyn.\n\nAmnestria grew up on Evermeet with Elaith Craulnobur. They were distantly related. They were later betrothed until Elaith's family [[moonblade]] rejected him.  Elaith went into self-imposed exile, but not before Amnestria became pregnant.  Elaith left Evermeet before Amnestria could inform him of the pregnancy.  The only other person to know of the pregnancy was Amnestria's youngest brother [[Lamruil Moonflower|Lamruil]].  With the self-imposed exile, their betrothal was nullified.\n\nAmnestria left Evermeet to thwart Elaith's plans to despoil the ancient burial grounds of Aryvandaar when only four months pregnant.  It is possible that a moonblade could still have chosen Amnestria and Elaith's abandoned bastard son and lost Prince of Evermeet, however no record of what happened to the child exists.\n\nAmnestria met and fell in love with the [[human]] [[ranger]] [[Bran Skorlsun]]. They had a child together, [[Arilyn Moonblade]], Amnestria's second. However, their relationship and the child were seen as a secret disgrace. In an attempt to bridge both worlds, Amnestria used her moonblade to create an ''elfgate'' [[portal]] that linked Evermeet and [[Faer√ªn]]. However, when the elves of Evermeet learned of this, they caused the sword to be dismantled so that the portal could not be used.\n\nCirca [[1321 DR]], Amnestria went into exile in [[Evereska]], where she took the name ''Z'beryl'' and raised Arilyn alone without ever telling her about her heritage. Z'beryl, a capable warrior-mage, took a teaching position at the [[College of Magic and Arms]] in Evereska. However, she was killed by common thugs (likely sent by [[Kymil Nimesin]], who had also sent an assassin after her in [[1321 DR]]) when Arilyn was less than 15 years old."
