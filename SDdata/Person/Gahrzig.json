        "mainbody": "'''Gahrzig''' was a [[wemic]] chief and mercenary who worked for [[Pristoleph]], a powerful figure in the city of [[Innarlith]], on several occasions during the 14{{th}} century DR.",
        "History": "Senator Pristoleph began building an army at [[Firesteap Citadel]] in the [[Firesteap Mountains]] south of Innarlith in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, with the intention of invading the city-state and overthrowing Ransar [[Salatis]]. He hired a large number of wemic mercenaries from the [[Shaar]] as part of his army, including Gahrzig and his tribe. He paid them with magic weapons.\n\nGahrzig was present in the final assault on the [[Palace of Many Spires]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, which ended when Salatis's own bodyguards murdered him and power was handed over to Pristoleph. Gahrzig and his wemics were present with Pristoleph outside the door of Salatis's bedchamber when the bodyguards presented the body of their former ruler to Pristoleph.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a faction of senators united together against Ransar Pristoleph and Gahrzig with his wemics again fought for Pristoleph in the civil war that ensued. He was wounded by [[acid]] from a [[black firedrake]] during street fighting, but survived.<ref>"
