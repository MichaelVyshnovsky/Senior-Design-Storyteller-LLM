Mol Flesz was a high-ranking member of the "Coin Guard", the city guard of Imdolphyn, as of 1479 DR.
Mol was an honorable man, with the high sense of honor typical of a dragonborn. Despite this, rumors abounded that he accepted bribes to overlook certain less than legal contraband coming through the city.
