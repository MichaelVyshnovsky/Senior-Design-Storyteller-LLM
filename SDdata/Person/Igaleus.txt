'''Igaleus''' was one of the [[elf|elven]] slaves captured by Chieftain [[Saslick]]'s [[lizardfolk]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Igaleus was a large man. After capture, his lower jaw was striped with long red scars, reminiscent of trauma left by a spiked [[mace]]. The fresh and raw torn flesh attracted ravenous swamp [[flies]].

==History==
In the early fall of [[1372 DR]], Igaleus, along with his brothers, worked as a hunter in the vicinity of the [[Lizard Marsh]]. They hunted and foraged fresh meat for a huge [[orc]]ish army led by a terrifying [[devil]] [[Gorgomorz]]. Igaleus harbored no goodwill towards the orcs or their [[Lower Planes]] master, but they paid for meat very well. Igaleus' hunters picked the lands clean and started diving into the Lizard Marsh, following herds of [[white-tailed deerâ€Ž]]. Eventually, the hunting party was ambushed by Saslick's lizardfolk, and Igaleus was snatched. He spent several weeks in captivity until the [[Hero of Daggerford]] infiltrated the lizard tribe while wearing the [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh|Green Hag's of Lizard Marsh]] ''[[polymorph]]''. Igaleus promised to lead his fellow slaves away from danger, through the marsh, and to safety if he were given a key from the lizardfolk slave pen keeper, easy to spot by his size and a large wart on the snout. However, it was unknown if the Hero helped the slaves, angering the entire village of lizardfolk and their [[black dragon]] patron - [[Thuraskulusk]].
