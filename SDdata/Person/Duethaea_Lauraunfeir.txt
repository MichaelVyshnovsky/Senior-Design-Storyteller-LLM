Duethaea Lauraunfeir () was a Chosen of Mystra of the Delimbiyr Vale in the 9 century DR.
She was tall and very skinny, more hard-bitten than beautiful, and often dressed in a rigid leather greatcoat that reached her ankles.
She was spirited and difficult, but gregarious enough to mingle. She also liked very strong drink.
Duethaea was strong in the Art.
She wore two enchanted bracers that launched a number of spells.
Her family saw her as difficult. She had been trained by Elminster Aumar.
She liked to mingle in taverns all around the Savage North.
Duethaea met her match in the Battle of Blades Afire, where she attacked heedlessly and was ultimately mortally wounded by the demonic foes.
