'''Baedelkar the Thaumaturge''' was a [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]] in [[Ordulin]].

==History==
Baedelkar was a rising hope inside the Zhentarim. On [[Flamerule 16]] of [[1358 DR]], Baedelkar was at the [[Winking Will-o'-the-Wisp Pleasure Palace]] playing with the [[Lady of the Red Sash]]. However, his fellow [[Nentor Thuldoum]] arrived with orders from [[Manshoon]] to depart immediately. The Lady of the Red Sash revealed herself to be a [[malaugrym]] and killed Baedelkar before he could act.
