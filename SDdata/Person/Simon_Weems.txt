Simon Weems was an unfortunate insurance salesman from the settlement of Lake Geneva in the land of Wisconsin on Earth who briefly traveled to Toril.
He had a short beard and mustache and wore glass spectacles, a strange gray fabric outfit in three pieces, a brightly colored strip of cloth knotted around his neck like a noose, highly polished black leather short boots, and a gold bracelet. This outlandish appearance prompted the locals of Havenmere to assume he was some sort of demon, monster, or harbinger of death.
During his time on Toril, Weems was confused and helpless, not fully understanding where he was or what had happened.
Weems was a rather sedentary and unfit man, unused to physical labor or exertion. He had a condition that required a specific "amino acid" in his diet that was not found on Toril, meaning his life there would be short.
Weems had a variety of odd implements on his person, including a stopped wrist-clock called a "Rolex", an inert "pager", and a gold pen with an empty internal ink reservoir worth about 1 gp.
Sometime in the 14 century DR, a spontaneous gate transported Simon Weems to Toril along with a creature called the Demon, appearing in the village of Havenmere. The villagers took him for a monster and quickly subdued the confused planeswalker, tying him up to be burnt on a pyre. Before he could be turned to ash, he was rescued by passing adventurers who proceeded to investigate the situation, with the assistance of the learned local Senecus.
Presuming that a "vector balance" was in effect between Weems and the Demon, the adventurers quested forth and captured the beast, ideally reuniting the two and sending the both of them home to their respective planes.
