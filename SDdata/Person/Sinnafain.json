        "mainbody": "Sinnafain (also spelled Sinnafein She was also the leader of the elves of the Moonwood.\nAs leader of the elves of the Moonwood, Sinnafain was sympathetic to groups (such as Casin Cu Calas) that killed or harassed orcs in protest of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows. She often pardoned these vigilantes.\nIn Sinnafains first encounter with her future husband, Tosun Armgo, his sword, Khazidhea, persuaded him to attack her, but he refrained from hurting or killing her. The two later married and had two children, Teirflin and Doumwielle Armgo, while living in the Moonwood.\nAt some point, Tosun started a \"contest\" between his children for one of them to win possession of Khazidhea. Doumwielle won and killed her brother in 1484 DR after he attempted to take it from her. She fled and her parents followed. Along the way, they were pursued by orcs. Tosun, apparently having reverted to his old ways, slashed Sinnafains legs and left her for dead. However, instead of killing her, the orcs captured her and Lorgru traded her back to the Moonwood for political clout.\nSinnafain was married to Tosun Armgo for decades. She had two children with him Teirflin and Doumwielle Armgo. Teirflin was killed by Doumwielle just prior to Tosun slashing Sinnafains legs and joining Doumwielle in her journey to the Underdark."
