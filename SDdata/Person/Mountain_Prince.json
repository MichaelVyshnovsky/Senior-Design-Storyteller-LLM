        "mainbody": "The Mountain Prince was a skilled yikarian warrior inhabiting the World Pillar Mountains in 1367 DR.\nThe Mountain Prince carried scars from his many battles.\nAs one of the Seven Sages, the Mountain Prince ruled over one of the large provinces of the Yikarian Empireâ€”the Bronze Falcon. Given the Bronze Falcons location near the dense forests found east of the World Pillar Mountains, the Mountain Prince was mostly responsible for eliminating any threats to the Empire from that direction. He often rode at the head of his army into battle.\nThe Mountain Prince personally taught the Lotus Emperor how to use a sword. He was believed to have the Emperors confidence."
