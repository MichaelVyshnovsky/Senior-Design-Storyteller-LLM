Kriga Moonmusk was the great chief of the Blue Bear Tribe during the late 15 century DR.
Despite her advanced age, Kriga was exceptionally shrewd.
When traveling throughout the North, Great Chief Kriga was transported in a fur-covered litter that was carried by four Blue Bear tribesmen.
Krigas daughter, Hydia, was a fearless warrior.
