'''Demitrick''',<ref group="note">The only name given for this character is "Old Scout". This article assumes he has the same name as his son, Pilot Demitrick, for convenience, but other interpretations are possible. nicknamed '''Old Scout''', was a fisher and rebel of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was the father of [[Pilot Demitrick]].

==History==
Demitrick and his wife owned and operated three small boats to fish [[Maer Dualdon]] in the 1350s DR. Their catches were good and were shipped as far away as [[Triboar]] and [[Leilon]] in the south.

But during the [[Battle of Icewind Dale]], in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, [[Akar Kessell]]'s forces surrounded and seized Targos. Many inhabitants of the town hid and barricaded themselves within their homes, preferring to let time and the elements take the lives of the savage invaders. However, the Old Scout and a few others took up arms and actively fought Kessell's minions. He, along with three trusted comrades, carried out guerrilla strikes on Kessell's forces, targeting patrols and supply caravans. After three days of this, to find out who was responsible, Akar Kessell tortured several citizens of Targos, and then captured Pilot's mother to force the Old Scout to surrender himself. Once he had them, Kessell killed them both as an example of his tyrannical will, leaving Pilot orphaned.
