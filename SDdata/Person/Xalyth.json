        "mainbody": "Xalyth, also known as Nal, was a female drow trader and fencer of gems and spell components in Menzoberranzan in 1370 DR.\nHer fortune came from her relations with nine suppliers, from Ammryyr of Skullport, a male drow worshiper of Vhaeraun, to Ubelein Shubelith, a duergar of Underspires nicknamed \"Fatreek\".\nXalyth was fearless and fairly trustworthy. She had a sharp tongue, but was slow to anger. Her nickname was formed from the initials of \"Not A Lady\"."
