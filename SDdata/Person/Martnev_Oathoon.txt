'''Martnev Oathoon''' was [[Durinbold & Oathoon]]'s Valued Customer Disciplinarian clerk and a member of the [[patriar]] [[Oathoon]] family in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Durinbold & Oathoon faced supply chain difficulties due to caravans not being able to freely enter the city. Martnev Oathoon, sent out a notification letter to [[Oliver Tefoco]] of [[The Bee Hive]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]], informing him of the suspension of food and dry goods deliveries that would eventually renew when the crisis ended. During the same year, Pammella Nortale of [[Nortale's Hostel]], was in debt to Durinbold & Oathoon and missed a month's payment. The provisioners demanded her to make a minimum payment or be tuned over to the [[Fist Repossessions]].
