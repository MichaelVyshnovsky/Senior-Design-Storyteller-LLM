Lord '''Wyllyck Caldwell''' was a very important [[patriar]] in [[Baldurian]] society and was the most likely candidate to become a duke following [[Abdel Adrian]]'s death.

==Description==
Wyllyck was the aging noble patriarch of the [[Caldwell]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]]. The Caldwells were one of the oldest families in the Gate, and under Wyllyck's leadership, sustained their great wealth. Wyllyck, however, did not hoard his wealth, and instead distributed a lot of it to charity. Because of this and several other reasons, Wyllyck Caldwell was very well regarded, not just in the [[Upper City]], but city-wide. He even invested into businesses in the [[Lower City]], giving him great repute in the area. In addition to general charitable works, he donated very generously to the [[Church of Last Hope]], [[Shrine of the Suffering]], [[Watchful Shield (shrine)|Watchful Shield]], and the [[High House of Wonders]].

==Personality==
Wyllyck was said to be very modest, talented, and philanthropic. He was more interested in studying, discussing alchemy, and conducting charity work, and thus declined invitations to noble galas. He believed most other patriars were too concerned with their own pleasure in order to care about the Lower and [[Outer City]]. Caldwell was against [[the Guild]], though that did not stop him from looking into issues within the Outer City.

==Possessions==
In addition to his manor, he owned two caravels, ''[[Sweetseed]]'' and ''[[Abelea]]''.

==Activities==
Caldwell could often by found in the [[Wide]], studying alongside his fellow alchemists.

==Relationships==
The Caldwell patriarch was liked all over Baldur's Gate. Many persons and organizations were impressed with Wyllyck, including Duke [[Torlin Silvershield]], the [[Parliament of Peers]], and even his political rival, [[Ulder Ravengard]].

Wyllyck had an intelligent wife, [[Abelea Caldwell]], who was skilled at finance and business management.

The only heir of the [[Dlusker]] family, [[Guinever Dlusker]], married into Wyllyck's family.

==History==
In the early-mid 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Wyllyck's [[pear]] and [[apple]] orchards became infected with a rotting [[disease]]. The skilled alchemist searched for a cure, though the orchards naturally recovered. During his investigation, he discovered a new way to treat wood, whereby timber was safeguarded from water. Wyllyck's new treatment method was even better than any sort of polish or paint. His wife, Abelea, made use of her husband's great discovery, causing the family to become even richer and more affluent.

In [[1482 DR]], the [[Parliament of Peers]] planned on electing Wyllyck Calwell to become a duke and thus part of the [[Council of Four]]. Wyllyck had very strong support from existing dukes, and citizens from all around Baldur's Gate. However, Caldwell never became duke.
