She was described as being rather slender, particularly in regard to her squat sister Cori.
Allie was the more pleasant and endearing of the Shorard sisters.
At the Northern Light, Allie was tasked with greeting patrons and cleaning its numerous rooms.
Allie and Cori often argued about how to run the Northern Light. Allie believed Cori was too frivolous with their operating money.
