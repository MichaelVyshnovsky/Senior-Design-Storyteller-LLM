'''Norbus Ironrune''' was a [[shield dwarf]] prospector in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Together with his business partner, [[Dazlyn Grayshard]], he discovered the ruins of the [[temple of Abbathor]] in the [[Sword Mountains]].

==Description==
Norbus seemed brusque and acted overly wary. He enjoyed joking around with Dazlyn.

==Possessions==
Norbus and Dazlyn owned a pair of ''[[sending stones]]''.

==History==
When prospecting for [[gold]] in the Sword Mountains southwest of [[Phandalin]], Norbus and Dazlyn came across the ruins of a temple of [[Abbathor]] and a nearby [[Dwarf|dwarven]] settlement that had been buried by a landslide a long time ago. In the following months, the two dwarves excavated the ruins until they encountered the [[ochre jellies]] that had infested the temple.

When a group of adventurers came to the excavation site and warned Norbus and Dazlyn of the young [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] who had settled in the area, the dwarves hired the adventurers to clear the temple of the [[Ooze|oozes]]. As payment, they offered their ''sending stones''.
