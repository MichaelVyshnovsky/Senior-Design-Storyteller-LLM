        "mainbody": "Yosh al-Nasr, or the Eagle, was a Maztican Eagle Knight living in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.\nHis real name was Yax Cautli.\nWhile living in Maztica with his sister, Yosh sailed across the Trackless Sea with the hopes of seeing Faer√ªn. His ship was blown off course and wrecked during a violent storm, yet he and his sister were able to survive by clinging to a piece of flotsam, though they were separated at sea. Yosh was eventually rescued by sailors who transported him to Qudra on the shores of Zakhara. He was able to narrowly avoid becoming a slave.\nYosh wanted to discover the fate of his sister, Taxatl, who was in fact a member of the Royal Harim of Huzuz. He used his unique skills to earn work as an elite bodyguard while he searched for his sister.\nYosh owned some bizarre, at least by Zakharan standards, equipment including a maca and a matching set of feathered armor and headpiece."
