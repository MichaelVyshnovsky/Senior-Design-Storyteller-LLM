        "mainbody": "'''Jacoby''' was a master blacksmith who ran a smithy in the [[Crossroad Keep]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Jacoby had the appearance of a typical [[Tethyrian]] man â€“ busy skin, brown eyes, and dark hair. He wore his curly hair trimmed short and a well-maintained thin mustache. His face was permanently blushed with the sun from years of hard and determined work. Staring into hot metal left his lips dried and cracked, and hearing diminished. Despite his somewhat rugged appearance, his eyes gleamed with passion every time he examined a masterfully crafted new weapon.",
        "History": "Jacoby opened his forge in the fortress of the Crossroad Keep shortly after it was reclaimed by [[Neverwinter]] with the aid of the soon-to-be-famous Knight-Captain known as [[Kalach-Cha]]. Jacoby continued his work in service of the fortress and its occupants in the years that followed the [[Shadow War]], eventually leading his services to the merchant name [[Sa'Sani]] when she was granted residence within Crossroad Keep."
