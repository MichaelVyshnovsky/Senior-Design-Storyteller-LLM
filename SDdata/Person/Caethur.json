        "mainbody": "Caethur was a moneylender of Waterdeep in the late 14 century DR.\nCaethur was spiteful and sadistic, finding great pleasure in ruining people who borrowed money from him, willing to kill even those who repaid him in full.\nHe favored brainburn poison. He wore numerous golden rings, and wielded a daggerclaw.\nWhile lending money, Caethur had more than once walked out of a room full of dead men.\nThe number of dead guards of his had made it very expensive to hire any more.\nIn an early spring evening of , Caethur met with five debtors in a discreet room overlooking Jembril Street in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep. His debtors included Kamburan, Hammuras, Aldurl Nael, and two others, demanding either their payment or the deeds to their shops. He brought two guards with himself both guards carried hand crossbows, their ammo poisoned with brainburn. Though Kamburan and Hammuras made their payment, the moment Aldurl failed to, he killed him. He then had his guards slay all the others, for witnessing the murder afterwards, he killed his own guards, so thered be no witnesses to the murder. Taking all valuables from their bodies, he left.\nLater as he walked, he was ambushed by Narnra Shalace, a thief, who distracted him by throwing a few coins from a rooftop and then leapt down on him, striking him down. She was not able to steal anything, though, as the man walked not far behind a Watch patrol. He survived, but per the watchmen, had suffered crippling neck wounds that may make it difficult for him to speak for a long time."
