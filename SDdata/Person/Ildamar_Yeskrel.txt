Ildamar Yeskrel was the head of a wealthy and influential family of Tarmalune as of 1479 DR.
Ildamar believed that he and a few other trusted nobles were descendants of the original founders of Tarmalune, and as such they deserved to be nobility. To achieve that end, he bought many buildings in the districts of Arendermore and Dawnside, and tried to buy influence over those he could not own.
He also ran a band of spies who operated throughout Tarmalune, and also manipulated criminals and a few merchants to sway the Council of Tarmalune when he wanted them to do things his way.
