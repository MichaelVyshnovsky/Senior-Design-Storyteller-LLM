'''Ildamar Yeskrel''' was the head of a wealthy and influential family of [[Tarmalune]] as of [[1479 DR]].{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|55}}

==Activities==
Ildamar believed that he and a few other trusted nobles were descendants of the original founders of Tarmalune,{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|53-54}} and as such they deserved to be nobility. To achieve that end, he bought many buildings in the districts of [[Tarmalune/Arendermore|Arendermore]] and [[Tarmalune/Dawnside|Dawnside]], and tried to buy influence over those he could not own.

He also ran a band of spies who operated throughout Tarmalune, and also manipulated criminals and a few merchants to sway the [[Council of Tarmalune]] when he wanted them to do things his way.
