'''Atherton Cooper''', better known as '''Sneakabout''', was a [[halfling]] [[thief]] of the village of [[Black Oaks]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Playing a part in the [[Time of Troubles]], he wielded the magic sword ''[[Godsbane]]'' before it was stolen from him by the mortal [[Cyric]].

==Personality==
Atherton liked to show off his tracking skills. He was found very entertaining by [[Kae Deverell]] and his men.

==Relationships==
Sneakabout had many allies: [[Radnor]], the [[Cormyr]]ian ranger; [[Midnight]], the [[magic-user]] from [[Deepingdale]], and Midnight's companions, [[Kelemvor]] and [[Adon]].

==History==
===Early Life===
Sneakabout stole ''Godsbane'' from its previous owner before killing him, but not before the sword's former owner had been driven mad by it.

===Time of Troubles===
During the Time of Troubles in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Sneakabout's village was attacked, looted, and razed by a [[Zhentilar]] force. During the battle, Cyric stole ''Godsbane'' from Sneakabout, as well as Atherton's pony.

Shortly after, Sneakabout met Midnight, Kelemvor, and Adon when they arrived in the area and halflings of his ruined village robbed them blind. He instead aided them and offered to guide them in their subsequent journeys. However, in truth, Sneakabout was under a curse and driven to recover his sword.

However, when they caught up with Cyric and the Zhentilar in the Bonerun valley of the [[Sunset Mountains]], the maddened Sneakabout attacked Cyric while trying to recover the blade ''Godsbane'', but was slain by Cyric.

===After Death===
After Sneakabout died, his spirit went to the [[City of Judgment]] on the [[Fugue Plane]], being considered one of the [[False]] for his cursed need for the sword. Midnight met him there and learned his past. Sneakabout helped Midnight find her way around [[Bone Castle]], although he complained constantly that he would be the one to drive Adon into the [[Wall of the Faithless]], and that nothing could be changed now.

After Midnight ascended to godhood, Midnight, now Mystra, sent [[Yondalla]] to investigate the case of Atherton Cooper.<ref>
