Atherton Cooper, better known as Sneakabout, was a halfling thief of the village of Black Oaks in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR. Playing a part in the Time of Troubles, he wielded the magic sword Godsbane before it was stolen from him by the mortal Cyric.
Atherton liked to show off his tracking skills. He was found very entertaining by Kae Deverell and his men.
Sneakabout had many allies Radnor, the Cormyrian ranger Midnight, the magic-user from Deepingdale, and Midnights companions, Kelemvor and Adon.
Sneakabout stole Godsbane from its previous owner before killing him, but not before the swords former owner had been driven mad by it.
During the Time of Troubles in the , Sneakabouts village was attacked, looted, and razed by a Zhentilar force. During the battle, Cyric stole Godsbane from Sneakabout, as well as Athertons pony.
Shortly after, Sneakabout met Midnight, Kelemvor, and Adon when they arrived in the area and halflings of his ruined village robbed them blind. He instead aided them and offered to guide them in their subsequent journeys. However, in truth, Sneakabout was under a curse and driven to recover his sword.
However, when they caught up with Cyric and the Zhentilar in the Bonerun valley of the Sunset Mountains, the maddened Sneakabout attacked Cyric while trying to recover the blade Godsbane, but was slain by Cyric.
After Sneakabout died, his spirit went to the City of Judgment on the Fugue Plane, being considered one of the False for his cursed need for the sword. Midnight met him there and learned his past. Sneakabout helped Midnight find her way around Bone Castle, although he complained constantly that he would be the one to drive Adon into the Wall of the Faithless, and that nothing could be changed now.
After Midnight ascended to godhood, Midnight, now Mystra, sent Yondalla to investigate the case of Atherton Cooper.
