        "mainbody": "'''Maerae''' was one of the two barmaids of the [[Copper Coronet]], a rowdy tavern in the [[Athkatla/River District|River District]] of [[Athkatla]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Just like [[Jalith]], Maerae was a surprisingly cheerful well-endowed young woman. She lived in a run-down and dangerous district of Athkatla that made her brave and persevering individual.",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Maerae worked alongside [[Jalith]] at the Copper Coronet. Both women were paid only in food and drink. The Copper Coronet allowed them little time to make [[coin]]. The only time they had was dawn-to-highsun â€“ the allotted sleeping time away from the tavern. As a way of income, Maerae was hired to run errands and perform various tasks during her off time. She did not fear getting down and dirty while performing hired labor and, occasionally, showed impressive acting skills when performing certain jobs disguised as a hasty wealthy woman. Despite her hard life, Maerae showed no interest in swindling her clients."
