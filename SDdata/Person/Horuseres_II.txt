Horuseres II was the fifth pharaoh of Mulhorand.
Horuseres II was born in -30 DR. He ascended to the throne of pharaoh of Mulhorand in 4 DR, after the former pharaoh Horuseres I had disappeared.
In 857 DR, a man by the name of Huriot was brought before the pharaoh under the conviction of grave robbing. The man managed to persuade Horuseres II to let a game of chance decide his fate, with a loss resulting in his execution and a victory resulting in being sold off into slavery.The pharaoh of this historical event was left vague. However, since the sourcebook Old Empires is set in 1357 DR and these events were said to have occurred "five centuries ago," that would place it during the time of Horuseres IIs reign.
Huriot pulled out his dice of chancelessness, whose magic nature was instantly detected by the pharaoh and had their effect reversed by his divine power. Huriot planned to lose the game on purpose as a display of honesty, hoping it might earn him a pardon, but with their effect reversed he had instead won and was sold into slavery for life.
Horusres IIs reign came to an end in 921 DR, when he was slain by a green dragon known as Chathuulandroth. The tomb constructed for him in the Great Vales Land of the Dead would end up being one of the greatest in Mulhorands history, being carved out of an entire mountainside.
