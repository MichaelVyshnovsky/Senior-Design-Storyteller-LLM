Olla al-Funun was an ambassador of the island kingdom of Afyal.
Olla was known to be a very open and cheerful woman. Known for her tactful nature and trouble-free smile.
Olla was a member of the royal court of Rogostos khedive, Samia al-Said, in 1367 DR. During this time she actively served the khedive, helping her to reconcile the various factions within her court, acting as an advisor and negotiator for several sides. With each passing year the khedive relied more and more upon her.
Olla was one of the few within the royal court of Rogosto that had more than a passing interest in learning about the race that created the citys famed towers. If a pristine tower was ever found in the rugged wilderness of the Ruined Kingdoms, she would reward the finders for its contents and their story.
