'''Olla al-Funun''' was an ambassador of the island kingdom of [[Afyal]].

==Personality==
Olla was known to be a very open and cheerful woman. Known for her tactful nature and trouble-free smile.

==History==
Olla was a member of the royal court of [[Rog'osto]]'s khedive, [[Samia al-Sa'id]], in [[1367 DR]]. During this time she actively served the khedive, helping her to reconcile the various factions within her court,{{AQ-time}} acting as an advisor and negotiator for several sides. With each passing year the khedive relied more and more upon her.

==Activities==
Olla was one of the few within the royal court of Rog'osto that had more than a passing interest in learning about the race that created the city's famed towers. If a pristine tower was ever found in the rugged wilderness of the [[Ruined Kingdoms]], she would reward the finders for its contents and their story.
