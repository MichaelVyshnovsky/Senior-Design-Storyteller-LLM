Brabras was a bullyblade for Lord Traevyn Illance in the late 15 century DR.
Brabras looked impassible.
Another bullyblade he worked with was Rorn.
The man was a bullyblade for Traevyn Illance.
Brabras was one of the bullyblades protecting Traevyn Illance when the latter met with Morligul Downdagger, who had just captured Rauligus Helderstone (actually Mirt the Moneylender) for him. Unknown for him, they were being pursued by the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar Brabras was quickly disabled after the mage conjured a veil of darkness around him, then enspelled him into a deep sleep.
After his master found him sleeping, Elminster, then impersonating Morligul Downdagger, told him that Brabras had been laid low by a wench, and that Rorn had gone off to chase her.
