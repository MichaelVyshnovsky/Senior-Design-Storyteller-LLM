'''Brabras''' was a bullyblade for Lord [[Traevyn Illance]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Brabras looked impassible.

==Relationships==
Another bullyblade he worked with was [[Rorn (Suzail)|Rorn]].

==Activities==
The man was a bullyblade for [[Traevyn Illance]].

==History==
Brabras was one of the bullyblades protecting Traevyn Illance when the latter met with [[Morligul Downdagger]], who had just captured [[Rauligus Helderstone]] (actually [[Mirt]] the Moneylender) for him. Unknown for him, they were being pursued by the fugitive [[wizard]] [[Elminster Aumar]]; Brabras was quickly disabled after the mage conjured a veil of darkness around him, then enspelled him into a deep sleep.

After his master found him sleeping, Elminster, then impersonating Morligul Downdagger, told him that Brabras had been laid low by a wench, and that Rorn had gone off to chase her.
