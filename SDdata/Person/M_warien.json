The Eye's power corrupted his island, drove M'warien mad and allowed him to be discovered by those wanting to claim the Eye for themselves. The [[cloud giant]] Lord [[Dworkin]], tempted by the Eye, attacked M'warien's isle from a [[cloud palace|floating castle]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Mysterious Isle|7}} In the chaos, M'warien's isle was also invaded by an aboleth, [[sahuagin]], members of the [[Kraken Society]], and [[sea elves]] led by their Princess [[Iridansa]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Mysterious Isle|8}} \n\nM'warien used his crystal golems to defend his lair from the invaders, but he was overwhelmed by Dworkin's forces. Dworkin used a magical [[rod]] to disable the powers of the Eye of Xxiphu and steal it for himself. M'warien became distraught and violent at the loss of the Eye.{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of Xxiphu|11}}"
