        "mainbody": "'''Dietr''' was a [[halfling]] soul residing in the halfling sphere of heaven, the [[Green Fields]] in [[1372]].\n\nDuring his second confrontation with the lichdrow Lord [[Dyrr]], the [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]], [[Gromph Baenre]], was physically sent by his enemy to the Green Fields. Here, Gromph met Dietr, who was enjoying his afterlife. However, after meeting with a living being, Dietr was reminded of his mortal life and his loved ones who remained in the Realms, especially his mother in [[Luiren]]. So, when Gromph went back to [[Toril]], Dietr followed him.\n\nHowever, arriving in the [[Menzoberranzan]] [[Bazaar (Menzoberranzan)|Bazaar]], Dietr, having abandoned the heaven, became a [[Mummy#Variants|huecuva]]. Gromph felt no sympathy for Dietr and forced him to go up against the Lichdrow; Dietr was easily destroyed."
