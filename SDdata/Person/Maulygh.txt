Maulygh was one of the magelords of the kingdom of Athalantar.
Maulygh was a master wizard from Unther who was hired by the prince Felodar Aumar in Calimshan to fight the magelords of Athalantar. However, Maulygh quickly joined the ranks of the magelords instead.
In a fatal dinner in Hastarl in 229 DR, he was one of the magelords killed by the Magister together with Neldryn Hawklyn.
