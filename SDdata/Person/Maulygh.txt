'''Maulygh''' was one of the [[magelord]]s of the kingdom of [[Athalantar]].

==Biography==
Maulygh was a master [[wizard]] from [[Unther]] who was hired by the prince [[Felodar Aumar]] in [[Calimshan]] to fight the magelords of Athalantar. However, Maulygh quickly joined the ranks of the magelords instead.

In a fatal dinner in [[Hastarl]] in [[229 DR]], he was one of the magelords killed by the [[Magister]] together with [[Neldryn Hawklyn]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|26-37}}
