        "mainbody": "'''Otaaryliakkarnos''' was a [[wyrm]] [[silver dragon]] follower of [[Bahamut]] who lived in [[Cormanthor]].",
        "History": "In [[650 DR]], Otaaryliakkarnos served as the companion of the [[moon elf]] [[Avourel Omberdawn]]. She taught him a lot of battle tactics, which earned him respect among his peers. \n\nDuring the last [[Rage of Dragons]], in [[1373 DR]], the [[Sisterhood of Essembra]] sought out Otaaryliakkarnos and offered the watch her while she slept, so she could withstand the effects of the Dracorage. Due to this and because of the Sisterhood open help to the [[dragonborn of Bahamut]], Otaaryliakkarnos became an staunch ally of the [[Song dragon|song]] [[half-dragon]] sisters.\n\nShe was chosen to be part of [[Protanther]]'s council in [[1489 DR]]. In the guise of a [[human]] named '''Elia''' she invited a delegation from the [[Council of Waterdeep]] to speak in front of the dragons. A band of adventurers sent by the Council of Waterdeep may have convinced her to ally with humanoid races to stop the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and [[Tiamat]]'s plots.",
        "Personality": "Otaaryliakkarnos was a righteous follower of Bahamut who had great faith in the humanoid races, with only some doubts concerning dwarves. She believed that under dragons' guidance and by following Bahamut's teachings, the lesser races could learn true and correct behavior. She always placed great value on a being's life, and if dragons' lives could be spared by an alliance with humanity, it would be a worthy arrangement."
