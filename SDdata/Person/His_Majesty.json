        "Personality": "His Majesty was exceptionally haughty, even when compared to cats that claimed no royal heritage. \n\nHe was also quite territorial: the mere presence of others nearby inflicted upon him great personal harm. He would occasionally allow others nearby if only to ''briefly'' admire his beauty and grace.",
