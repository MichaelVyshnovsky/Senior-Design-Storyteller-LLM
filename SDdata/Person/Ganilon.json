While some of the [[Kelemvor]]ites were killed, Ganilon, [[Severin]], and [[Winlof]] were all being in crypt's in the [[Pauper's Field]] cemetery of Neverdeath under the orders of [[Valindra Shadowmantle]], so they could be used for dark [[Thay]]an ''[[ritual]]''s.\n\nGanilon was rescued by an [[adventurer]] who was hired by the senior doomguide, [[Volahk]]. Ganilon was the last of the group to be rescued."
