'''Chuth''' ({{Pronounce|chooth|refs=}}) was an adult [[green dragon]] that lived in the [[Misty Forest]]. 

==History==
Chuth was born in the [[Ardeep Forest]] in [[942 DR]]. From his younger days he started to hunt and devour [[elves]]. In time Chuth focused himself to hunt mostly elves of royal lineage, always disguised by an ''[[invisibility]]'' [[spell]] and frequently moving from forest to forest in order to avoid being found and killed.

Chuth at one point joined the [[Cult of the Dragon]], and had agreed to become a [[dracolich]] in {{yearlink|1373}} as the [[Rage of Dragons]] of that year was expected to last forever. He changed his mind and ate the cultists in his enclave shortly after the Rage ended.{{cite book/The Ruin||Epilogue}} 
Around [[1485 DR]] Chuth was near the [[Laughing Hollow]] to hunt prince [[Alagarthas]].

Afterward, despite his previous actions he became the companion of the exiled [[elf]] prince and cult member [[Neronvain]] at some point after. Together, they coordinated raids against the elvish inhabitants of the Misty Forest until they were eventually defeated by a band of adventurers.

==Personality==
Chuth enjoyed the thrill of the hunt. In his youngest days he believed that eating elves could grant him immortality but in time he abandoned this stupid idea.
