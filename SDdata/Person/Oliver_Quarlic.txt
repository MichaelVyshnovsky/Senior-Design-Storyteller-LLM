'''Oliver Quarlic''' was a [[Gur]] monster hunter from a tribe led by [[Ulma]] that traveled along the [[Sword Coast]] and [[Western Heartlands]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''Perhaps the gods have abandoned us. Perhaps they have abandoned all of Faer√ªn.''|Oliver Quarlic}}

==Description==
Oliver was a tan-skinned Gur with a thin scar across the bridge of his nose, a brown beard, and a shaved head. He had a ring in his nostril and pierced ears. As an archer, he was dressed in a light set of [[leather armor]] and carried a [[longbow]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Oliver Quarlic's monster hunter tribe found itself targeted by the [[vampire]]s of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the [[Absolute]] crisis when the Gurs camped in the [[Rivington]] district of Baldur's Gate, along with a small army of refugees displaced by the conflict. To the Gurs' horror, the tribe's children were abducted by the vampires under orders from [[Cazador Szarr]]. Oliver's superstitious nature though that the gods had abandoned the tribe and that they were likely [[curse]]d, despite Ulma's assurance of it not being the case.
