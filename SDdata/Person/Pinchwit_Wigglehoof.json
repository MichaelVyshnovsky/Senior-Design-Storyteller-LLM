        "mainbody": "inchwit Wigglehoof was a gnome goatherd in Leilon in the late 15 century DR.\nPinchwit bred a herd of giant goats that provided large quantities of milk and meat. She also sold their goat hair, prized for its warmth and tensile strength.\nPinchwit worked as a goatherd for Dagult Neverember and the rebuilt town of Leilon, so her profits belonged to the town.\nCirca 1491 DR, part of Pinchwits flock was to be sold to a wealthy trader from Waterdeep for a large profit. Elmar Barthen, owner of Barthens Provisions in Phandalin, had negotiated the deal. The goats had to be transported from Leilon to Phandalin as part of the arrangement. The Leilon town council hired a group of adventurers to protect Pinchwit and her goats on the seven-day journey. During their travels, the goats were spooked by wyverns and had to be rounded up by Pinchwit and the adventurers. Later, the herd was attacked by a group of ogres on the prowl that the adventurers fought back. In the end, Pinchwit and her flock arrived safely at Phandalin."
