'''Doxon''' was a member of the [[Shadow Thieves]] in [[Athkatla]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
Doxon was an intelligent and charismatic individual. He liked to visit festhalls and attend parties where he could woo beautiful women, but he was interested only in those of fair complexion.

==Activities==
Doxon worked as an assassin in Athkatla for the Shadow Thieves. However, he sometimes disappeared for months on strange missions. It was believed he had access to ''[[teleportation]]'' or ''[[gate]]'' spells, but for an unknown reason he never shared this with fellow Shadow Thieves.
