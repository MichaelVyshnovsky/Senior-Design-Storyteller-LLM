'''Wrathburn''' was a [[wight]] that dwelt at the edge of the village of [[Throden]] in [[Forestfall Fen]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Their corpse effectively stood guard on the path to the lair of the [[black dragon]] [[Vorazidrar]].

==Possessions==
Wrathburn wielded a [[sword]] and was recognizable by their skull-decorated [[breastplate]], which was the only piece of their [[acid]]-damaged armor that had survived intact into the 15{{th}} century DR. His rotted clothing bore the marks of their northern homeland.

==History==
At some time in the early 15{{th}} century DR or earlier, Wrathburn was an [[adventurer]] from the distant [[North Faerûn|north]] who came to Throden, where they were slain by Vorazidrar and her [[lizardfolk]] minions. Their body subsequently reanimated in [[undeath]], serving as a warning to those who would challenge Vorazidrar.
