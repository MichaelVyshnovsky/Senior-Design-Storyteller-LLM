Wrathburn was a wight that dwelt at the edge of the village of Throden in Forestfall Fen as of the late 15 century DR. Their corpse effectively stood guard on the path to the lair of the black dragon Vorazidrar.
Wrathburn wielded a sword and was recognizable by their skull-decorated breastplate, which was the only piece of their acid-damaged armor that had survived intact into the 15 century DR. His rotted clothing bore the marks of their northern homeland.
At some time in the early 15 century DR or earlier, Wrathburn was an adventurer from the distant north who came to Throden, where they were slain by Vorazidrar and her lizardfolk minions. Their body subsequently reanimated in undeath, serving as a warning to those who would challenge Vorazidrar.
