'''Prath Baenre''' was a young [[drow]] [[wizard]] of [[House Baenre]] in [[Menzoberranzan]].

==Description==
Prath was described as very stocky, with bulging biceps. Gromph Baenre believed that Melee-Magthere may have been more suited for him, given his martial demeanor.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Prath was in his first year of study at [[Sorcere]]. He was very loyal to [[Gromph Baenre]], slicing his own pinky finger when a piece of flesh was needed for a spell during the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]].

Soon afterwards, in order to allow him to infiltrate [[House Agrach Dyrr]] to destroy the [[phylactery]] of the [[Dyrr|Lichdrow Dyrr]], Gromph disguised himself as Prath and disguised Prath as Gromph. Gromph chose Prath over [[Nauzhror Baenre]] in part because he was worried that Nauzhror would get delusions of grandeur.

When Gromph disguised himself as Prath and entered Prath's rooms, he noticed the use of a frivolous spell that said "Welcome back Master Prath" and also a series of scrolls containing progressively complicated [[transmutation]]s. After seeing his room, Gromph decided that Prath had some unforeseen potential.
