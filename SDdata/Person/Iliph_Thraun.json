        "mainbody": "Iliph Thraun was a spellfire wielder and lich lord. He was involved in the hunt for Shandril Shessair in late .\nIliph Thraun had been reduced to a mere skull while white, it was yellowed. Its eyesockets harbored two pale, flickering lights. Its voice was hollow, punctuated by its chittering teeth.\nIt was disdainful of the Harpers.\nIliph Thraun was most unique in his ability to wield spellfire, which he possessed in life in death, he was able to drain spellfire from fellow wielders, making their control of it more tenuous in the process. As a lich, he could cast a number of spells, presumably including disintegrate, magic missile, lightning bolt, at least one acid-based spell, and at least one spell to render itself invisible, almost certainly invisibility.\nOf note, there were ways of controlling the lich that were not available for use against other liches. Spells that drained lifeforce or those that created fire or lightning could be used to feed the lich by turning them into spheres, and centering them on the skull a spell of governance over undeath, almost certainly control undead, and a masking charm, presumably nondetection, could be combined with the word \"Calauthas\" such a combination allowed anyone to control the lich from anywhere through the use of a skull-shaped charm carved from its thighbone. However, the lich became aware of the identity of whoever controlled it.\nIliph Traun could also be controlled with a brass cage holding a fist-sized black gem hanging from a neck-chain. The device allowed a wielder to see out of the lichs eyes and control it completely, without it being aware of any influence upon it.\nThe lich lord maintained itself through spells which required him to regularly train apprentices on their casting.\nIliph Thraun was known to a number of beholders at least two of them, Zulthondre and Xarlraun, had baubles that granted complete control of the lich.\nIn the mid-14 century DR, Iliph Trauns memories went back a thousand years.\nIn late , Manshoon was introduced to Iliph Traun by Zulthondre, who offered him as the ideal hunter for Shandril Shessair, thanks to the lich lords ability to absorb her spellfire and then wield it after the lich departed for the task, the beholder brought up the lich lords controllability due to flaws in the process of its construction. Xarlraun, another beholder, offered a similar control to Fzoul Chembryl shortly after that.\nIliph Thraun continued to watch Shandril since at least her arrival to Tethgard. He fed on Shandril, invisibly, both after Tethgard, while still in Hullack Forest, It continued to tail her stealthily through the battle at Irondrake Rock. Throughout this chase, Thraun was controlled directly by Manshoon, who preferred the lich lord not reveal itself after his death, Iliph sought out Shandril directly to confront her and consume her spellfire.\nThe lich lord struck Eveningstar, seeking Shandril it broke into Tessarils Tower, slaying many of the guards and the watch before reaching her. In the process, it severely injured Narm Tamaraith, all but killing him, and severely injured Shandril Shessair, stopping only briefly when Sarhthor attempted to control it using Manshoons tokens and methods. Finally, after Elminster and Storm Silverhand intervened, Shandril was able to overload the skull with spellfire, and slew it. After the fight, Shandril learned her unborn child had perished in the fight, due to the lichs draining."
