        "mainbody": "'''Bert \"The Weasel\" Adams''' was a [[red cap]] boatswain of the [[Blushing Mermaid]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the time [[Captain Grisly]] was replaced by the [[green hag]] [[Auntie Ethel]] as the owner of Blushing Mermaid, Bert resided at the Mermaid, alongside other hag's crewmen, spending their days drinking and partying. Bert was masquerading as a human sailor, keeping his [[fey]] nature a secret. It was unclear if the Bert \"The Weasel\" Adams identity was stolen from a slain sailor or was a fabrication."
