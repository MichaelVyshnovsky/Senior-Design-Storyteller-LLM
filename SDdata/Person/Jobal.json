        "Description": "Jobal's dark skin was riddled with scars he had acquired in his younger years.",
        "Personality": "Sly and confident, Jobal was never shy about exploiting a weakness, especially in his business dealings.",
        "Activities": "{{Fq\n| text = Beware Jobal and his no-good flunkies! That merchant prince is as trustworthy as a sack of [[snake]]s, as are most of his \"guides.\"\n| source = Rival guides [[River Mist]] and [[Flask of Wine]] \n}}\nBy law, all guides in Port Nyanzaru were required to register themselves with Jobal and to provide him with a \"fair\" portion of their earnings or of the treasures they found while on the job. This law extended to guides hired by any type of group entering the Chultan jungles, from treasure hunters to miners to trappers to merchants. Anyone found to have been paid as a guide without having registered with Jobal could be beaten, blinded, or killed as punishment.\n\nJobal likewise controlled the sale of sellsword and mercenary services within the city.\n\nAs one of the seven merchant princes, he participated in the governing of Port Nyanzaru from the palace of [[Goldenthrone]]. He was known to sometimes conduct important meetings while in the [[sauna]]s of [[bathhouse]]s in the city.",
        "Possessions": "Jobal owned a lavish villa in Port Nyanzaru that was well-fortified and defended by loyal guards. The walls of this villa were draped in [[silk]]s and decorated with [[tapestries]] and mounted [[beast]] heads.",
        "Relationships": "{{Fq\n| text = I have eyes everywhere.

        "History": "Jobal worked as a guide and [[adventurer]] in his youth. He made his fortune when he and his party recovered a great trove of [[gold]] and [[gem]]s, but Jobal was conveniently the only person to survive the hordes of jungle [[dinosaur]]s and [[undead]] that they faced. He returned to Port Nyanzaru alone in a [[canoe]] overflowing with treasure. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, he was one of the wealthiest people in the city.\n\nFollowing the departure of [[Amn]] from Port Nyanzaru, the city became heavily reliant on mercenaries for its defense. In the years leading up to the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} foreign treasure hunters seeking to raid Chultan tombs became more common in Port Nyanzaru, leading to a rise in the profitability of the jungle guide business.\n\nWhen Port Nyanzaru came under attack by [[fiend]]ish pirates led by Captain [[Idrianne Smoke]], Jobal's spies were responsible for identifying an opportunity to disrupt her plans as she raided the [[Royal Docks (Port Nyanzaru)|Royal Docks]]."
