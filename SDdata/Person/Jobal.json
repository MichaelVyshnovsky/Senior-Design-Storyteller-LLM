        "mainbody": "obal (), also known as Jobal the Spider, was one of the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru during the late 15 century DR. He hired out professionals that aided expeditions into the jungle, namely guides and mercenaries.\nJobals dark skin was riddled with scars he had acquired in his younger years.\nSly and confident, Jobal was never shy about exploiting a weakness, especially in his business dealings.\nBy law, all guides in Port Nyanzaru were required to register themselves with Jobal and to provide him with a \"fair\" portion of their earnings or of the treasures they found while on the job. This law extended to guides hired by any type of group entering the Chultan jungles, from treasure hunters to miners to trappers to merchants. Anyone found to have been paid as a guide without having registered with Jobal could be beaten, blinded, or killed as punishment.\nJobal likewise controlled the sale of sellsword and mercenary services within the city.\nAs one of the seven merchant princes, he participated in the governing of Port Nyanzaru from the palace of Goldenthrone. He was known to sometimes conduct important meetings while in the saunas of bathhouses in the city.\nJobal owned a lavish villa in Port Nyanzaru that was well-fortified and defended by loyal guards. The walls of this villa were draped in silks and decorated with tapestries and mounted beast heads.\nJobal had a companion and lover named Aazon Talieri, who he trusted to no end. Aazon acted as the chief spy for the merchant prince. Jobal further had many spies who kept him abreast of secrets in his city, including his network of guides, who reported to him about their clients.\nAmong Jobals registered guides were Azaka Stormfang, Eku, Faroul and his companion Gondolo, Hew Hackinstone, Musharib, Salida, and the druid Qawasha. These guides were empowered not only to offer their services, but to advertise at the local taverns as well as at the harbormasters office.\nJobal was aware that the Zhentarim operated their own network of illicit jungle guides in his city&mdashsuch as Flask of Wine and River Mist&mdashwho attempted to undercut his rates. This prompted him to make it very clear that this was unacceptable and that these guides would be cruelly punished if they were caught.\nAs with all merchant princes, Jobals monopoly was protected with the help of the Ytepka Society.\nJobal worked as a guide and adventurer in his youth. He made his fortune when he and his party recovered a great trove of gold and gems, but Jobal was conveniently the only person to survive the hordes of jungle dinosaurs and undead that they faced. He returned to Port Nyanzaru alone in a canoe overflowing with treasure. By the late 15 century DR, he was one of the wealthiest people in the city.\nFollowing the departure of Amn from Port Nyanzaru, the city became heavily reliant on mercenaries for its defense. In the years leading up to the death curse, foreign treasure hunters seeking to raid Chultan tombs became more common in Port Nyanzaru, leading to a rise in the profitability of the jungle guide business.\nWhen Port Nyanzaru came under attack by fiendish pirates led by Captain Idrianne Smoke, Jobals spies were responsible for identifying an opportunity to disrupt her plans as she raided the Royal Docks."
