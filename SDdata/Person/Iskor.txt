Iskor was a water wraith from Elemental Plane of Water.
Iskor acted as a broker of information acting on the behalf of a water god worshiped in the Inner Planes and by sea creatures of Faer√ªn. She however wanted more power for herself.
The illithid Vestress of Ascarle bargained an agreement with Iskor and she provided the illithid with some extraplanar creatures like some nereids.
In 1361 DR, the archmage Gromph Baenre summoned Iskor and convinced Shakti Hunzrin to bargain an agreement with her in order to locate Liriel Baenre. Shakti agreed. Using the water ways, Iskor went to Ascarle and reported the conversation to Vestress, proposing to add the drow to the agents of the Kraken Society. Vestress liked the idea and Iskor explained that Shakti was in search of a renegade drow wizard, the same girl who was causing trouble to Vestress too.
During the attack on Ruathym, Iskor was sent to attack some water elementals.
Iskor had to obey to Gromph Baenre because he knew her true name. She was a trusted ally of Vestress of Ascarle.
As a water wraith, Iskor could communicate with all sea creatures and also summoned some from her home plane.
