'''Iskor''' was a [[water wraith]] from [[Elemental Plane of Water]].

==Activities==
Iskor acted as a broker of information acting on the behalf of a water god worshiped in the [[Inner Planes]] and by sea creatures of [[Faer√ªn]]. She however wanted more power for herself.

==History==
The [[illithid]] [[Vestress]] of [[Ascarle]] bargained an agreement with Iskor and she provided the illithid with some extraplanar creatures like some [[nereid]]s.

In [[1361 DR]], the archmage [[Gromph Baenre]] summoned Iskor and convinced [[Shakti Hunzrin]] to bargain an agreement with her in order to locate [[Liriel Baenre]]. Shakti agreed. Using the water ways, Iskor went to Ascarle and reported the conversation to Vestress, proposing to add the [[drow]] to the agents of the [[Kraken Society]]. Vestress liked the idea and Iskor explained that Shakti was in search of a renegade drow wizard, the same girl who was causing trouble to Vestress too.

During the attack on [[Ruathym]], Iskor was sent to attack some [[water elemental]]s.

==Relationships==
Iskor had to obey to Gromph Baenre because he knew her [[true name]]. She was a trusted ally of Vestress of [[Ascarle]].
 
==Powers==
As a water wraith, Iskor could communicate with all sea creatures and also summoned some from her home plane.
