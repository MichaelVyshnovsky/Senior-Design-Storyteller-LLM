}}'''Elgoeror Indethym''' was a [[wizard]] and a member of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the 1360s DR. He had a penchant for seducing noblewomen and fraudulently siphoning money from them. One of his marks eventually caught on to his schemes and killed him.

==Description==
Elgoeror was devilishly handsome.

==Personality==
He was a smooth-talking ladies' man that thought he was very clever.

==Abilities==
When not swindling noblewomen out of their wealth, Elgoeror Indethym was an accomplished wizard that developed a [[spell]] that could carve a stone surface into an exact copy of another stone surface that the caster touched.

==History==
During the 1360s DR, the [[House of Stone]] was a focus of activity for adventurers that realized the edifice was no longer being guarded by the [[elves]] of [[Ardeep Forest]].{{Cite dragon/273/The New Adventures of Volo: The House of Stone|75}} It became a fad among the nobles in Waterdeep to hire an adventuring band to bring back one of the many stone murals that decorated the dangerous halls and display it as a status symbol outside a villa. As the supply of carved panels became more scarce and difficult to retrieve, Elgoeror saw an opportunity and researched a spell that could engrave a copy of a stone surface onto another block of stone. He made quite a profit creating copies of carvings until news of the scheme got out and the fad faded. The spell he developed was apparently known only to him and was lost upon his death.

Elgoeror was murdered by one of his noblewoman lovers who stabbed him with a hairpin.

==Rumors & Legends==
According to those willing to talk about such things, most of what he swindled was never recovered.
