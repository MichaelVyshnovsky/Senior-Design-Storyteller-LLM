        "History": "When she was turned into a vampire in Amn, she had a vision of being reborn as a queen of the [[Feywild]]. Through research that mostly consisted of consulting sages and then drinking their blood, she found information that led her to believe the city of [[Karador]] contained a ''[[portal]]'' to the Feywild and she worked to obtain a position of power in Amn's colony on Snowdown.\n\nOnly her closest confidants knew her true nature."
