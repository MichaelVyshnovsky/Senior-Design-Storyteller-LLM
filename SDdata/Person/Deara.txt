'''Deara''' was a [[priest]]ess of [[Deneir]] at the [[temple of Deneir (Procampur)|temple of Deneir]] in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] in the early 1360s [[DR]].

Deara desired to create the perfect [[scribe]], and so in the temple's vaults she sculpted and animated a [[clay golem]]. In one particular test, ''circa'' [[1362 DR]], the golem drove a [[quill]] through a wooden writing desk, smashing it in the process. Thereafter, the golem was put to work as a guard and porter in the temple's main hall.
