Deara was a priestess of Deneir at the temple of Deneir in the city of Procampur in the Vast in the early 1360s DR.
Deara desired to create the perfect scribe, and so in the temples vaults she sculpted and animated a clay golem. In one particular test, circa 1362 DR, the golem drove a quill through a wooden writing desk, smashing it in the process. Thereafter, the golem was put to work as a guard and porter in the temples main hall.
