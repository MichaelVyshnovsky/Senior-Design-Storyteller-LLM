'''Gjellani''' was a [[howling dragon]], one of the many [[planar dragon]]s summoned by [[Sammaster]] on [[Nightal 6]] of the {{yearlinkName|1373}} to protect the ''[[dracorage mythal]]''.{{cite book/The Ruin||13}}

It was assigned during the battle to prevent the mages of [[Thentia]] from entering the Heart of the Rage, and it successfully struck them with its breath weapon. The timely intervention of [[Jivex]] and [[Taegan Nightwind]] bought them enough time to counterattack, and it was finally slain shortly after.
