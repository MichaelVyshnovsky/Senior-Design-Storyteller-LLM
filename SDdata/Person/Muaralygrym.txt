'''Muaralygrym the Dark''' was a [[mage]] of [[Raven's Bluff]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. He collected all of the ''[[Tears of the Dragon]]'', which got him slain by [[Inhil Lauthdryn]].

==History==
He was said to be the darkest-hearted mage of the city. In the {{YearlinkName|1294}}, Muaralygrym the Dark sent his [[gargoyle]]s to Raven's Bluff, where they took every single last of the ''[[Tears of the Dragon]]'' spilled over the city by grieving [[gold dragon]] [[Tlanchass]]. For this, he was later sought out and slain by Inhil Lauthdryn, the [[Magister]]; the next Magister, [[Aralagath Tarsil]], confirmed that he was no more shortly after.
