        "mainbody": "'''Rhaugilath''' ({{Pronounce|RAW|gill|ath|refs={{Cite adventurers league/Putting the Dead to Rest|3}}}}), known as '''\"the Ageless\"''', was a [[Netherese]] [[human]] [[archlich]]. He was the former Lich-King of the enclave of [[Orbedal]] in ancient [[Netheril]] and later one of the servitor [[lich]]es of [[Larloch]] the Shadow King of [[Warlock's Crypt]], titled \"the Shackled Scribe of Larloch\".",
        "History": "Rhaugilath was once the ruler of the enclave of Orbedal in [[High Netheril]], and was known as the Lich-King of Orbedal. In this position, he was an archrival to [[Larloch]] of the enclave of [[Jiksidur]].\n\nIn the [[-339 DR|Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR]], Netheril suffered [[Karsus's Folly]], all [[magic]] failed, and Orbedal fell from the sky to crash-land on the [[Sword Coast]], near the mouth of the [[Winding Water]]. Rhaugilath and his [[phylactery]] survived the impact, but he was buried and trapped by rubble in a small pocket.\n\nMany years later, Rhaugilath was discovered and freed from the rubble—by his archrival Larloch, who'd found and claimed Orbedal for his own. A vicious battle erupted between the two. Larloch was victorious and he bound Rhaugilath to serve him. He became the first of Larloch's lich servitors, as Orbedal became the infamous [[Warlock's Crypt]].\n\nHe was still there by [[1374 DR]],{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night}}",
        "Activities": "Rhaugilath dedicated himself to writing Netheril's complete [[history of Netheril|history]], compiled in his great work, ''[[Of the Fall of Netheril]]''. However, he considered the [[Netherese Diaspora]] after Netheril's fall to be an integral part of the history, as well as the expected restoration of [[Netheril]], thought to be only beginning in 1374 DR. Thus his book was never likely to be finished, and it reached several volumes. Larloch reviewed each chapter when it was completed, and they were delivered to [[Candlekeep]] to be archived in the library there.\n\nOccasionally, Larloch allowed Rhaugilath to use either a ''[[dream]]'' or ''[[nightmare (spell)|nightmare]]'' spell, at Larloch's choosing, to send a vision to some being Rhaugilath had [[scry|scried]] upon. Rhaugilath used these visions to grant some small piece of Netherese lore to the targeted individual. Reportedly, those who received such visions heard Rhaugilath sigh and Larloch chuckle as the vision ended."
