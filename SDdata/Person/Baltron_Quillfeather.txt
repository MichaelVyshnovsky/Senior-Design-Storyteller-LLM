'''Baltron Quillfeather''' was a scholar and a member of the [[Harpers]] based at [[Twilight Hall]] in the city of [[Berdusk]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a bookish young man with a high-pitched, whiny voice.

==History==
During the [[Dracorage]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the Harpers of Twilight Hall sent Baltron to [[Baldur's Gate]] to apprentice with [[Velsaert]], an expert on [[dragon]]s. Baltron's purpose was to study all that was known about the Dracorage in order to inform his superiors on how to proceed. Unfortunately, Velsaert was secretly a dragon and had himself succumbed to the Dracorage. Irritated by his incessant questions, he transformed and attacked Baltron with his claws. It is unknown if he survived.
