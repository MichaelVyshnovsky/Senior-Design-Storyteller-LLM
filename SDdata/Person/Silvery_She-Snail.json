        "mainbody": "The \"Silvery She-Snail\" was the stage-name of a famous nightclub dancer of Sembia.\nHer act was quite successful, thanks in part to a number of flying illusion spells developed by an archmage. This mage, powerful and reclusive, became so infatuated with the She-Snail that he kidnapped her. But he wooed her successfully and she retired sometime in the early 1360s DR to marry him.\nThe Silvery Sembian Snail tavern in Wheloon, Cormyr, was named after the Silvery She-Snail."
