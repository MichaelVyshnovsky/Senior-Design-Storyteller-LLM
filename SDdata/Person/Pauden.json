        "mainbody": "'''Pauden''' was a [[Shadow Druids|Shadow Druid]] from the dark [[druid circle]] in [[Amn]], based in the northeast of [[Trademeet]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|You there! You will go back the way you have come! This area is under care of the druids of Tethir, and if you do not leave, you will face nature's wrath!|Pauden}}",
        "Description": "Pauden was a pale male [[human]] with red hair.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Pauden's druidic circle from [[Tethyr]] fell under the sway of Shadow Druid [[Faldorn]] and her aggressive ways, who replaced the Great Druid [[Gragus]]. Druids became cruel and hardened, dispensing nature's punishment to civilized people of the southern edges of [[Amn]]. At some point, the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Abdel Adrian]] was asked to solve the [[dire animal]] attacks on Trademeet. Subsequently, the adventurer and his companions discovered that the onslaught was the doing of the Shadow Druids. Pauden was unwilling to spill blood. Instead of attacking the Bhaalspawn, he left them with a warning of Faldorn remaining with the druidic grove and becoming unbeatable as long as she remained there. [[Cernd]], a druid companion of Abdel Adrian, was familiar with the druids of Tethyr, having left them a while back. Pauden recognized his old ally and told him of the circle's new direction."
