        "mainbody": "Deathsleep was a green dragon who made his home in the Neverwinter Wood on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR.\nDeathsleep was mostly green with yellow eyes. He had golden-yellow scales on his belly. Deathsleeps wings were a mix of green and yellow.\nDeathsleep was malicious and very aggressive against strangers frequenting the road near his lair.\nHe survived by robbing and killing travelers and traders who passed along a road not far from his lair.\nHe was focused on destroying Neverwinter Wood and killing random passersby in order to gain sustenance and treasure.\nAfter a streak of killings, robberies, and forest destruction, Deathsleep was probably killed by a party of adventurers consisting of an elf, human, dragonborn and dwarf who ventured into the Neverwinter Wood to stop his activities."
