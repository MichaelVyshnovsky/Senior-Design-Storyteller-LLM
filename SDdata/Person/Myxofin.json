        "mainbody": "Myxofin was a watersoul genasi and the Steward of the Sea of the Four Stewards of Akanûl in 1479 DR.\nMyxofin was a corrupt, greedy, and smart individual.\nAs the Steward of the Sea, Myxofin was in charge of all the business-related rulings and policies of Akanûl.\nMyxofin was a more corrupt Steward of the Sea than his predecessors, and he profiteered from Akanûls treasury, getting his ill-gotten profits through intermediaries and investing in businesses both legal and illegal, as well as in the black market. In preparation for his retirement, and trying to cover his success, in 1479 DR he had sent his agents to negotiate with the ambassadors of Aglarond, Chessenta, High Imaskar, and Netheril, in the hopes of buying some real estate in one of these countries and to go live there after retirement.\nIn the , Myxofin was in favor of a war between Akanûl and Tymanther. He was convinced to change his opinion by Aoth Fezim of the Brotherhood of the Griffon, when he returned to Myxofin an ancient relic of his family, the Brooch of the Tide Masters, which had been lost during the Spellplague."
