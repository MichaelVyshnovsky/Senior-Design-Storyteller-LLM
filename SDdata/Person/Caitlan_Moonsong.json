        "mainbody": "'''Caitlan Moonsong''' was an innocent teenage girl that lived in [[Cormyr]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] that, through no choice or decision of her own, she played a critical role in the struggles between the gods in the world-shaping event known as the [[Time of Troubles]]. She briefly served as the [[avatar]] for the goddess [[Mystra]] before their shared destruction.",
        "Description": "She was a waifish girl that looked thin and near-starved, no more than 15 years old during the time of her adventures.",
        "Personality": "Aspects of Caitlan's personality seemed to contradict one another. While she was still a child often acted as such, at times she showed wisdom learnedness well beyond her years.",
        "History": "During the [[Avatar Crisis]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the goddess Mystra was trapped by the God of Strife [[Bane]] at [[Castle Kilgrave]] in [[Cormyr]]. Mystra used a unique ''[[geas]]'' spell to compel Caitlan Moonsong to seek out a suitable [[avatar]] for her in the form of the [[magic-user]] [[Midnight]], along with \"worthy warriors\" to aid her in this quest.\n\nAfter a tiring and single-minded search for Midnight, Caitlan came upon the gruff mercenary [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]] in [[Arabel]] and deemed him worthy enough. As Caitlan shared with Kelemvor and his allies [[Adon]] and [[Cyric]] about her mistress' peril, By chance or fate, Midnight confidently joined their table and Caitlan became immediately transfixed to her amulet, which held a portion of Mystra's essence. and Kelemvor took the young girl over [[Zehla]] at the [[Hungry Man]] inn to rest and recover. After waking up, Caitlan demanded that Kelemvor take Midnight with them on their journey and would not accept any objection.\n\nThe group left Arabel in short time an rode out, passing through weird and unfamiliar landscape that had been altered by changes in [[the Weave]] due to the absence of Mystra. Due to the lack of recognizable landmarks, the group became lost and Caitlan herself stopped speaking, stricken with fear at the effects [[wild magic]] had on the natural world.\n\nWhile Kelemvor, Midnight and the others were asleep, Mystra offered Caitlan the means to fly to Castle Kilgrave at once, as the non-corporeal form of the goddess was alone in a cell with the monstrous avatar of Bane. Caitlan snuck into the castle with ease and witnessed a confrontation between the two gods.  When Caitlan's companions awoke to find her missing, they immediately set out for pursuit towards Castle Kilgrave.\n\nThe group of adventurers battled through their respective personal demons while venturing through Bane's domain, but reunited unscathed and quickly made their way to find Caitlan and Mystra. The proximity of Midnight's necklace empowered the goddess of magic and gave her the strength to merge her incorporeal form and Caitlan's soul into the young girl's body and wound Bane's avatar to where he had to flee. Taking back her essence in Midnight's amulet, Mystra was reunited with [[the Weave]].\n\nThe goddess of magic remained within Caitlan's body and reshaped it in her preferred image. Mystra marched upon the [[Celestial Stairway]] but was ultimately destroyed by [[Ao]]'s chosen guardian [[Helm]]. Caitlan Moonsong was no more."
