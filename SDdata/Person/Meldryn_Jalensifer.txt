'''Meldryn Jalensifer''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|986}} to {{yearlink|998}}.

==History==
Meldryn came upon the idea to slay the previous Magister after looting a stronghold of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] northwest of the [[Vilhon Reach]], discovering spells that could create [[skeletal dragon]]s and [[zombie dragon]]s. He lured [[Constulgrael]] to the [[Howling Caverns]], where he had laid down zombie and skeleton [[dragon]]s, and then struck the Magister with spells and summoned monsters when he appeared. Eventually, Meldryn slew the dragon.

Once he had the office of the Magister, Meldryn created a number of constructs to speak for him, dedicating all of his time to hiding and misdirecting mages who sought to challenge him. Even though [[Mystra]] pointedly gave him the ''[[scepter of Mystra]]'' in {{yearlink|994}} with orders to give it to a minor mage, he performed that action and immediately returned to hiding. Mystra reminded him in dreams and visions that the Magister was supposed to spread magic; in response, he wrote down dozens of copies of ''[[Jalensifer's Trident]]'' and went on a whirlwind tour to spread them.

He was eventually ambushed in his hidden lair in the [[Star Mounts]] by a challenger, but rather than attack, he responded with visible relief, and asked only for a few days in order to explain his situation at leisure instead of running and hiding. Though suspicious, his challenger accepted. A few days later, [[Sarndaen Dalabar]], the challenger, slew the [[Magister]] with three ''[[meteor swarm]]s'' in quick succession, just to make sure.

==Rumors & Legends==
Meldryn's ability to stay undetected was excellent, leading some to suspect a [[psionic]] wild talent was involved.
