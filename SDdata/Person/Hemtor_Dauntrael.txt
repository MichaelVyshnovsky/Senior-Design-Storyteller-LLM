'''Hemtor Dauntrael''' was the fabled child of [[Shalima Dauntrael]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Hemtor's father was a [[marilith]], and originally he would've slain his mother in childbirth, but she whelmed powerful sorcery to alter his nature while still in the womb. While he still had a wild temperament all his life, he only developed a few demonic traits. Finally, he became a hiresword and died fighting pirates in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], proving sterile before that point.
