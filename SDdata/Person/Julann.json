        "mainbody": "'''Julann''' was a member of the [[Wychlaran]] of [[Rashemen]] who traveled to the [[Sword Coast]] on her ''[[dajemma]]'', accompanied by her [[Rashemaar berserkers|berserker]] bodyguard [[Rigah]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{Quote|''\"I wonder if birds ever die of old age while they're flying and fall RIGHT out of the sky?\"''|Julann}}",
        "Personality": "Julann was prone to impulsive decisions and regularly acted on her whims. While she freely trusted others, her judgement as to their motives was somewhat misguided.",
        "Relationships": "She had a complicated relationship with Rigah. While he looked to her for guidance and wisdom he thought her actions to be guided by nothing more than randomness.",
        "History": "Julann and Rigah departed from Rashemen on their ''dajemma'' to seek out the [[Bhaalspawn|child]] of [[Bhaal]] who was referred to in the [[Prophecies of Alaundo|prophecies]] of [[Alaundo]].\n\nThe pair traveled for years, often making their decisions based on little more than Julann's whims. When they heard about the rumors of a divine being in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Julann and Rigah considered joining up with the [[Shining Crusade]]."
