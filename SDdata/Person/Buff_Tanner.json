        "Description": "Buff Tanner was a [[human]] male with a dark skin tone, dark brown eyes, and black hair he kept slicked back. His beard and mustache were well-trimmed.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Buff Tanner was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. He could often be found in the large company of friends, including [[Cyndirie Vand]], occupying one of the large guest tables at the tavern. Like every citizen of the Gate, Buff had strong opinions on the refugee crisis caused by the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. He claimed to feel bad for all those displaced refugees but thought it was not the city's responsibility to take them all in, believing that it was the plan of the Absolute to destabilize the city and drain its resources."
