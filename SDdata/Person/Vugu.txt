Master '''Vugu''', was the founding member of the short-lived [[Order of Theorosophers]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''...the blathering idiots use empiricism simply to bolster their twisted, quasi-spiritual view of the world and have begun promoting this new pseudo-science in all the trade journals. Worse still, they've named me as their mentor...My reputation is in tatters, without that, I am nothing...''|Excerpt from Vugu's journal.}}

==History==
Master Vugu finalized his doctrine on Theorosophy fifteen years before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. His academic work resulted in the formation of the Order of Theorosophers, something that became a bane of his existence. Initially, Master Vugu's concept was simple: an individual should not discount deep, psychic urges and the motivations of their subconsciousness when attempting to validate an unproven hypothesis. Vugu stated that the scientific approach ignored the individual's primeval mind and over-relied on clinical data.

Vugu took two pupils, [[Beb-Shuur]] and [[Xianga]], who failed to understand the Master's teachings to Vugu's exasperation. Both men were fawning academia rejects who focused on the "syntax" of Vugu's words rather than their meaning. For Beb-Shuur and Xianga, Theorosophy was in active opposition to perception based on logic and empiricism. Instead, they relied on deductive reasoning and intuition. Vugu's life's work became a quasi-spiritual pseudo-science, and as Beb-Shuur and Xianga ventured into the world, they accredited the creation of the Order of Theorosophers to Master Vugu. This devastated his standing within academia and philosophical communities of [[Faerûn]].

With his reputation destroyed, Master Vugu committed suicide by jumping off the dangerous [[Blade Cliffs]] to the southwest of [[Daggerford]]. His tattered journal that recorded Vugu's true thoughts about Theorosophy was saved ashore not far from the cliff where he died. When the journal was recovered, Beb-Shuur and Xianga denied its authenticity based on a gut feeling as dictated by Theorosophy. Subsequently, both "sages" convinced each other that the only way to decide who was worthy of the title and leadership role was to follow Vugu's example. Both dimwitted men died after jumping off a cliff.
