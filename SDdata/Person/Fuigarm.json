        "mainbody": "Fuigarm was a mute giant who served as bodyguard to Aman Al-Raqib of Bralizzar near the Raurin in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nFuigarm was about  and weighed . His head was completely hairless, with large ears that stuck out. His eyes were small, appearing as pinpoints of light, his face was normally expressionless, and he never smiled.\nHe was highly observant and very intelligent, and stoic. He was loyal unto death.\nBesides being a skilled fighter, Fuigarm was possessed of heroic strength. He also knew a special sign language, known only to him and to his master. When he protected someone on the streets, the odds of pickpockets were considerably reduced.\nFuigarm carried an exceedingly powerful magical scimitar, a magical dagger of superior strength, and a silk shirt of protection +1 that provided incredible defense against missiles. He also carried a silver medallion that marked him as a resident of Bralizzar.\nCirca 1356 DR, Fuigarm may have been directed by Aman to escort adventurers in his employ around Bralizzar."
