'''Brynn Osstra''' was a farmer that lived in [[Nightstone]] with his family during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Brynn and his husband [[Thelbin Osstra|Thelbin]] farmed [[wheat]] within the safe confines of the walled village they called home. The couple lived in a cozy cottage with Brynn's mother, sister, and his nephew [[Broland Osstra|Broland]].

==History==
Some time during the latter half of the 1480s [[DR]], the Osstra family home was partially destroyed when [[cloud giant]]s assailed Nightstone with stones from the sky. The village's residents fled for shelter in a nearby cave network but encountered a band of [[goblin]]s led by [[Hark|Boss Hark]]. Many of the townsfolk were slain while others were taken as prisoners.

While Brynn, Thelbin, and Broland managed to survive the traumatic ordeal, Brynn's mother and sister were not so fortunate.
