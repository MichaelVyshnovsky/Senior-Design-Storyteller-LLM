'''Mekrath''' was a powerful [[elf|elven]] [[wizard]] in [[Athkatla]], [[Amn]]. 

==Possessions==
Mekrath held a very important gem in his altar. His captive, [[Haer'Dalis]] claimed that it was stolen from him by the wizard. He fought with a quarterstaff, and wore a robe of fire resistance.

==History==

|source=Haer'Dalis
}}
The wizard set up his lair above the Athkatlan sewers. Mekrath was not very tolerant of visitors, especially thieves, and when he found [[Haer'Dalis]] thieving in his lair, he enslaved him. The elven wizard may have asked of [[Gorion's Ward]] a task. The ward could have killed Mekrath or performed this task for him for Haer'Dalis' freedom.

Upon the freedom of Haer'Dalis, the once-slave read out a poem he had composed.
