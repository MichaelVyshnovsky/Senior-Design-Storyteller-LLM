Savyels AkaPillihp was a bounty hunter active in Thay during the 14 century DR. 
He was the namesake of the "Ward of Savyels", the entrance bailey of the version of the Flaming Brazier temple that stood in Bezantur as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Local tales in Bezantur claimed that the Ward of Savyels earned its name when Savyels foiled a salamander lords assassination attempt on Eternal Flame Mythalanir, the high priest of Kossuth of the Flaming Brazier.
