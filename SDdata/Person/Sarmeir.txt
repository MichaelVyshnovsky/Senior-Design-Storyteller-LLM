'''Sarmeir''' was a [[War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
After spring began in the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, [[Harnrim Starangh]] made a quick raid near [[Mouth o' Gargoyles]] on the sanctum of [[Vangerdahast]], then retired from his post of [[Royal Mage]]. After he slew three [[War Wizard]]s and escaped, the War Wizard [[Huldyl Rauthur]] ordered [[Darthym]], who'd just reported the losses, to wake Sarmeir and have the two of them stand guard in the armory, where two people had been slain.
