'''Orsin''' was a [[Deva (aasimar)|deva]] [[Shadow walk|shadowalker]] from [[Telflamm]].

==History==
Orsin lived many lives, always as deva, [[aasimar]], or similar [[celestial]] being.

In [[1484 DR]], Orsin went in search of the son of [[Erevis Cale]]. He arrived near the Abbey, helping the pilgrims going to the [[Abbey of the Rose]] to find the right way. There he spoke with [[Vasen Cale]], discovering he was the son of Erevis. He said to Vasen that they were friends in multiple lives so he wanted help Vasen also in this life. For this Orsin decided to always follow him.
