        "History": {
            "Encounter with Sunbright": "During Netheril's [[Shadowed Age]], Lady [[Polaris]] assigned her high steward, [[Candlemas]], a mission to acquire an ancient tome. The steward planned to send the [[barbarian]], [[Sunbright Steelshanks]] to fetch it, provided Sunbright survived his encounter with the One King in Tinnainen. However, the One King himself had heard of the ancient arcane tome, and wished it for himself. Thus, when the barbarian met with the One King, he was tasked to acquire it. Sunbright's companion, [[Greenwillow]], had been taken captive by the king, and the king would only let her go unmolested if Sunbright was successful. Without a second thought, or a choice, the barbarian set out to the south.\n\nReaching the lair of Wrathburn, Sunbright knew he should not sneak in, for the chances of him surviving were very small. As he was about to charge, Candlemas's [[raven]] appeared and told him more information, and about the vanity of the great red dragon. Sunbright, now gaining confidence, strode into the den and confronted Wrathburn.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = You pick a painful but noteworthy suicide, fleshy morsel.\n| source = Wrathburn to Sunbright\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}\nIt first seemed as if Wrathburn would strike the barbarian, but Sunbright began to sing its praises.
