Retsotnert Doogrick lived many years before [[1372 DR]], then he was fondly remembered by his beloved grandson Purfbin in his many conversations with the Hero of Daggerford during their time together. According to Purfbin, Retsotnert lived in the Doogrick clan burrows somewhere south of [[Daggerford]]. Purfbin's favorite happy memory from his childhood was when Retsotnert invented a flying machine that became the talk of the entire burrow, cobbled out of twigs, cogs, and grease. The machine made a terrifying clattering ruckus when grandpa cranked the machine up, scaring all the neighbors' children. Retsotnert invited his grandson to partake in the flying machine's maiden journey. The duo shared the cockpit as the invention "soared into the sky." They managed to fly for several feet when the master cog gave out, and the machine collapsed. Even though the flight was not particularly successful, the gnomes laughed so hard at the incident they forgot to make repairs and try the machine again. Many years later, this incident was the happy memory that brought nostalgic tears to Purfbin Doogrick's eyes.

Another unforgettable memory of Retsotnert was when he invented a [[corn]]-picking machine. It left Purfbin's nightmares filled with corn-ears whizzing past his head with a terrifying velocity.
