'''Raphael''' was a [[cambion]] [[devil]] that tried to convince mortals to sign a pact with him.

==Description==
Raphael had deep red skin, large double horns, curved ears, and burning orange eyes. Twin wings sprouted from his back and he had a spade-tipped tail. He wore regal clothing, particularly colored red or embroidered blue. He sometimes assumed the form of a middle-aged human man, with white, tanned skin and brown slicked back hair.

Unlike the alluring and attractive facade that was his humanoid form, Raphael's ascended form was a vision of horror. Standing taller than a [[human]] even at a hunch, the ascended fiend bore wings, a tail, and a burning mane of fire. His simple horns became a complex crown of infernal bone framing a snouted face. This face had two additional faces erupting from either side of his cheekbones, giving Raphael a total of four orange hellish eyes. His entire being glowed with infernal flame and fearsome tusks erupted from each of his mouths.

==Relationships==

Raphael was the son of [[Mephistopheles]], the [[archdevil]] of [[Cania]], the eighth layer of the [[Nine Hells]]. Being an heir of the archdevil granted him much more power and higher rank than a lot of devils. However, Raphael was annoyed by his father getting ahead of him and snatching the [[Crown of Karsus]] after [[Karsus's Folly]], and his stingy behavior of locking the crown in his treasure vault rather than putting it to good use.

He had a tense relationship with an [[orthon]] named [[Yurgir]]. When Yurgir had to fulfill a contract with him, Raphael seized the opportunity to trap the orthon with the contract so that he could never interfere in his affairs.

A pair of [[dwarf]] sisters had associations with Raphael. One named [[Korrilla Hearthflame]], who served Raphael willingly as his agent. The other one was known only as [[Hope (dwarf)|Hope]], who refused to serve Raphael by any means. Raphael was annoyed and intrigued by Hope's resilience towards his deal and keeping her own hopes, so he imprisoned Hope in his lair and tortured her in horrific ways to make her surrender one day.

At some point, a servant of Raphael bought him a young boy named [[Enver Gortash]] from Baldur's Gate. Raphael raised and kept the boy in his dungeon until Gortash escaped the House of Hope.

Raphael may have assisted a tiefling child [[Mol]] to escape the Shadowlands were she to survive the siege of the [[Emerald Grove]]. Mol may have signed a contract, selling her soul in return for Raphael becoming her patron.

Raphael was the lover of an [[incubus]] named [[Haarlep]]. The incubus was planted there on the orders of Mephistopheles, likely without Raphael's knowledge, to distract his wayward spawn.

==Abilities==

He was very good at "getting into people's heads" and leading them astray. He used flowery language, the promise of salvation, and the threat of despair to better manipulate those he targeted.

In combat, Raphael was a fearsome enemy. He had several lesser cambions at his beck and call, and could even compel the orthon Yurgir, with whom he had a contract, to fight on his behalf. With the ability to detect invisible creatures, attack multiple times with a flurry of talons, high defenses, and a complete immunity to fire, the fiend was dangerous indeed.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|-339}}, Raphael witnessed the catastrophic event of Karsus's Folly and the fall of [[Netheril]]. The mighty power of the Crown of Karsus caught his attention and he came up with a goal of using the crown to reunite the Nine Hells. Unfortunately, his archdevil father Mephistopheles took the crown and locked it away. Raphael waited for the opportunity to snatch the crown for himself ever since.

During or before the {{YearlinkName|1391}}, Raphael was contacted by an architect of the [[Thorm]] family who wished to end the [[Dark Justiciars|Dark Justiciar]] army of his former master [[Ketheric Thorm]]. Raphael granted the deal with the architect in exchange for his soul. He sent the orthon Yurgir to fulfill the contract but manipulated the situation to trap the orthon by the contract's terms.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a mysterious [[mind flayer]] captured various individuals, including the [[cleric]] [[Shadowheart]] and monster-slayer [[Wyll]], aboard his [[nautiloid]] ship. The mind flayer had inserted an illithid tadpole into their eyes, and the victims began to feel strange effects. After the nautiloid crashed, some captive adventurers left the wreckage, and traveled together around the [[Western Heartlands]], eventually making camp on several occasions.

At some point, Raphael appeared before the adventurers and transported them to the [[House of Hope (demiplane)|House of Hope]]. He offered them a lavish banquet in an exquisite dining hall within. Raphael offered them an opportunity to rid them of these tadpoles and halt the process of [[ceremorphosis]], but only if they entered into an [[infernal contract]] with him.

==Trivia==
Raphael was fond of a [[Cormyr]]ean [[The Mouse Smiled Brightly|lullaby]], for which he considered himself akin to the [[fox]] referenced in the lyrics.

According to Haarlep, Raphael's incubus consort, the cambion's bedroom preference was always below and never on top.
