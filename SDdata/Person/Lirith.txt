'''Lirith''' was a [[dragonborn]] elder, leader of the  [[Inquest]], and one of four overseers of the [[Abeir]]an city of [[Xorvintroth]]. Lirith and their colleagues enjoyed an afterlife; their consciousnesses were preserved as spectral echoes in the [[Astral Plane]], despite the deaths of their dragonborn bodies.{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|14-15}}

==Description==
Like other Inquest leaders, Lirith wore a set of [[robe]]s decorated astronomical symbols and imagery of the arcane embroidery. They also each wore a metallic necklace that featured a large medallion depicting a crown of viridian crystals.

While in the Astral Plane, Lirith and the other Inquest elders appeared to wear these very crowns, which allowed them to avoid detection by roaming [[astral dreadnought]]s.

==History==
Along with the other Inquest elders, Lirith's consciousness was transferred to a [[brain in a jar]] after their death. While researching the [[Far Realm]], their astral forms became trapped in the Astral Plane itself. After that point, they arranged for their dead bodies and still-living brains to be transported elsewhere in Xorvintroth. 

At some point the being known as the [[Emissary of the Nine Eyes]] granted them a vision of a 'viridian planet' that would serve as an ideal new world for the dragonborn people. This planet would allow them to create new lives for themselves, free from constant strife and warfare. The Inquest immediately set to work on constructing the [[bridge of stars]], a means by which they could travel from Abeir to this new world. Unfortunately, their work would never be completed. 

After an unknown amount of time, ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, the living brains of Lirith, [[Ukthet]] and [[Krektesh]] were discovered within the ruins of Xorvintroth. They were all quite shaken after encountering the people that awoke them, uncertain of their surroundings and concerned about their fellow [[Graoul]].{{Cite adventurers league/Volatile Thoughts|14}}
