==Desription==
Oloric was a [[human]] man with a square face, ridden with wrinkles and scars. He had a sun-kissed skin, long blone hair, and icy blue eyes.

==Posessions==
Oloric kept a small [[book]] within which he diarized his thoughts and perspectives on what he saw in life.

==History==
Oloric fell on bad luck sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when he bacame unable to write to support his livelyhood. Desperate, Oloric turned to the [[House of Grief]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate where he went through the ''Mapping of the Heart'' ritual to cure his "[[melancholy|melancholic heart]]" and remove the memories of hiw writer's career. After the ritual, Oloric Witmirth could be found the same old Elfsong Tavern, not being able to recognize people he knew before but visibly being happier. He claimed that after the memories of being a writer wer taken away, his problems went away too. He no longer was a wreck, a writer who could not write.
