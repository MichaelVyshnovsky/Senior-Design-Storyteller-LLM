Shalima Dauntrael was a sorceress from Baldurs Gate, whose legend was passed down in the Dauntrael clan.
She was said to have never married, but to seek to conceive a child the man she ultimately went to was a marilith in disguise, and the child would slay her upon birth. In response, she sought every spell she could muster from a dozen mages (some given willingly, some not as much) to alter the nature of her child without slaying it. Her child, whom she named Hemtor, ultimately had only a few tanarri traits upon birth.
