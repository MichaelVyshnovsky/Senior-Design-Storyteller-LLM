'''Reinhar II''' was an [[Arkaiun]] warchief from [[Dambrath]].

==Activities==
After the death and defeat of [[Reinhar I]] at the hands of [[Mycontil]] in [[Halruaa]], Reinhar II assumed command of the remaining forces of invading Arkaiun. They immediately set out for Dambrath, struggling on a grueling march through the [[Walls of Halruaa]] before arriving home two months later. Only 1,000 of the initial 40,000 who invaded Halruaa survived to return to Dambrath.

Reinhar II ruled as effectively in defeat as his father did while at war. He pulled all remaining warriors home, knowing they were exposed to attack from outside forces.
