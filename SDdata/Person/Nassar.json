        "mainbody": "'''Nassar''' was a [[priest]] of [[Kossuth]], the frontman of the [[Heart of Bane (band)|Heart of Bane]] who utilized flames and pyrotechnics in his shows, and a part of the [[Bard's Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "By [[Uktar]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{LCRB}} Nassar found his calling as a devote [[cleric]] of Kossuth, the Tyrant Among Fire and the single of a bardic band. His singing was often described as wailing on the pages of the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' [[broadsheet]]. Nassar assembled like-minded performers: [[Everett Taber]] who played ''[[drums of panic]]'', [[Firmal]] with his [[illithid bagpipes]], [[Vanduhar Gerenstalt Eisnerâ€Ž]] and his ''[[Illmataran organ of pain]]'', and [[Havoc Sen Thornclaw]] with his ''[[ax of deafening and destruction]]''. It was Nassar's call to pick a controversial name for the band. The Heart of Bane band was named after the infamous [[Heart of Bane|relic]] of the same name. Nassar believed that such a grand name was sure to attract a great number of listeners. In Uktar, the Bard's Guild plastered the city with posters that advertised that the Heart of Bane would be making an appearance at a performance aimed at helping the city's morale. Coincidentally, the previous month's performance was led by another follower of Kossuth.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the ill-conceived advertisement attracted the attention of a band of [[tanar'ri]] led by a [[marilith]], as the planar beings were attracted to the relic's dark [[magic]], plaguing the city at the time. The ensuing slaughter took the lives of a dozen innocents, and the Bard's Guild was lit aflame, with the guild being severely damaged. The demonic attack was ended by a [[Golden Rooster Patrol]] led by Sir [[Kirth Sonath-Pann]]. In the fallout of the performance, Nassar and his band went into hiding, leaving only a spokesperson to proclaim their innocence. The proceedings from the show were never paid to Nassar's group as the Bard's Guild claimed that the box office was ransacked by a [[nabassu]]."
