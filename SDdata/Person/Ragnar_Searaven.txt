Ragnar Searaven was a human fighter pirate of the Great Sea, active in the 14 century DR.
Ragnar Searaven created a well-hidden lair in a cave somewhere on the coast of the Great Sea, not far from a small village of little note. The pirate paid for spellcasters to ward the cave and seal it with magics to not be accessible to anyone but Ragnar himself. The cave was turned into a library, filled to the brim with tomes of arcane knowledge the pirate gathered from around the world. All books had one topic in common â€“ shipbuilding. Searaven made it his lifes goal to collect knowledge and treasures to build a truly marvelous and unsinkable magical pirate ship. He dreamt of impregnable armored hulls, ensorcelled sails, and a crew of fiercely loyal buccaneers.
Sometime in the 14 century DR, Ragnar Searaven was among the ambitious fortune seekers who were interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths.
