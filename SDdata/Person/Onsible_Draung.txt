wizard
Onsible Draung was a wizard that lived in Saerloon, Sembia, until the , when he was abducted and sold into slavery.
Onsible was a recluse that lived in a tower in a walled compound on the west side of Saerloon.
He was quite good at subduing creatures with magic. He was the inventor of the spell Onsibles key.
In the cellars of his tower, he had a captured deepspawn that he used to produce smaller creatures to feed his larger ones.
Onsible collected various fantastic and monstrous creatures from his travels. He used some of them as guardians.
Someone with a grudge against Draung hired a pirate named Endreth Molipher to kidnap the wizard, cut off his hands, cut out his tongue, blind him, and deliver him to a galley in Westgate where he would be forced to serve the rowing slaves. Onsible put up a good fight and his monstrous guards almost killed Molipher, but the wizard ultimately lost the battle. Molipher tortured Draung and learned about the deepspawn, which gave him a career-changing idea. After delivering Onsible to Westgate, Molipher returned to Saerloon and acquired the deepspawn with the help of some lesser wizards that were squabbling over the remains of Onsibles estate.
