        "mainbody": "andirna was a tiefling woman from Elturel that was kicked out from her home city along with others of her kind, following the Descent of Elturel into the Nine Hells during the late 15 century DR.\nShe helped her community by guarding the supplies fellow refugees kept and took her responsibilities very seriously.\nAfter leaving the city, Pandirna and the Elturian tieflings were forced to seek asylum at the Emerald Grove after they were harried by goblin attacks while traveling west from Elturel to Baldurs Gate along the Risen Road.\nWhile on guard duty in the tieflings home in the grove known as the Hollows, Pandirna hoped to gain an advantage over would-be goblin attackers and drank some unknown potion given to her by Ethel. While the brew offered her tremendous strength and bravery, it briefly left her with no feeling in her legs."
