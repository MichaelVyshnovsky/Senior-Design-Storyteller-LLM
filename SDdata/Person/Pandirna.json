And fearless. But the old lady, she warned me of side effects. Should have listened. Now I'm stuck guarding crates.|Pandirna, to one of the [[True Soul]]s.}}",
        "Activities": "She helped her community by guarding the supplies fellow refugees kept and took her responsibilities very seriously.",
        "History": "After leaving the city, Pandirna and the Elturian tieflings were forced to seek asylum at the [[Emerald Grove]] after they were harried by [[goblin]] attacks while traveling west from Elturel to [[Baldur's Gate]] along the [[Risen Road]].\n\nWhile on guard duty in the tieflings home in the grove known as the [[Hollows]], Pandirna hoped to gain an advantage over would-be goblin attackers and drank some unknown [[potion]] given to her by [[Ethel]]. While the brew offered her tremendous strength and bravery, it briefly left her with no feeling in her legs."
