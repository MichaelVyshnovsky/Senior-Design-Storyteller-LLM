        "mainbody": "Maera was a member of the Company of the Anvil adventuring company in 1370 DR.\nMaera was a lithe half-elven woman. She was exceptionally skilled with a whip.\nMaera was passionate and liked to be at the center of attention.\nMaera was the partner of Bramas Thorntree and, thanks to this, also the second-in-command of the Company. Her brother was Merap, also a member of the group.\nMeara and her brother Merap were old allies of Bramas Thorntree, like all in the Company of the Anvil.\nIn 1370 DR, she joined the Company, and together they recovered the Sondarr Scepter from a long-forgotten dwarven tomb in the Starspire Mountains. They had been ordered to maintain a low profile and, on their return journey on Uktar 10, stopped at the Blue Badger Inn in the village of Toralth for drink.\nLater that night, three dwarves, Bapar Ghalmrin, Odak Truesteel, and Soram Battlebellow, entered the tavern seeking the Sondarr Scepter. However, the dwarves accidentally engaged in a brawl with the Shields of the Highland adventuring company. Maera and the others in the Company covered for Bramas and joined in the brawl, so that he could use this as an opportunity to escape with the scepter, but the dwarves eventually caught up with him and recovered it."
