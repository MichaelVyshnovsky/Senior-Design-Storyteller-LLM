'''Madoc''', more commonly known as '''Madoc the Uncouth''', was a shady merchant from the region of the [[Moonsea]] and a disgraced member of the [[Zhentarim]] in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Madoc was a short and stout balding [[dwarf]] with graying beard.

==Personality==
Madoc the Uncouth was a rude and easy-to anger person who was generally considered a poor company. Despite the attitude, Madoc was a successful merchant. He valued a cold [[ale]] and a warm lass on his knee.

==Possessions==
[[File:Madoc and his caravan.png|thumb|''Madoc the Uncouth, his smoking pipe, at a campfire.''|380x380px]]
Madoc ran a small caravan that traveled across the cities of the Moonsea. A [[halfling]] carpenter and caravaner [[Anders (halfling)|Anders]] was his only employee. Madoc's caravan worked with the Shield Trading Company in the city of Voonlar.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Madoc took his caravan from the [[Dalelands]] to the city of [[Voonlar]]. Weary of vengeance of his previous employer - the Black Network, and the recent fiend raids on the Moonsea, Madoc spared no expense in hiring a well-known hero from the city of [[Daggerford]] for 10,000 [[gold]] [[coin|pieces]]. The trip took them several days, and just within eyeshot from Voonlar, the caravan wagon lost its wheel, causing Madoc to fall into a rage. Thankfully, the repair was swift, and the caravan reached the city before a brewing storm hit the road. However, Anders, Madoc's hand did not do diligence, and the wagon completely fell apart as the caravan entered Voonlar, barely reaching the Shield Trading Company. Predicting the dwarf's anger, Anders scampered away before being held responsible for the disastrous end of the journey.

Soon after the entry, Madoc and the Hero of Daggerford were confronted by a member of Voonlar's watch, demanding they leave the streets as soon as possible – the city was under curfew under the orders of [[Bron]] [[Buorstag Hlammythyl]]. The Bron felt that the fiend armies summoned by the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] were soon to attack Voonlar. After taking care of the merchandise, Madoc retired to his room in the [[Swords Meet]] inn, offering the Hero an opportunity for further employment.

The dwarf was reaching advanced years and hoped to retire and settle somewhere warmer and calmer than the Moonsea. To do just that, Madoc embezzled half the profits from a caravan to [[Sembia]]. His old allies, the Zhentarim, did not approve. By happenstance, Swords Meet was a dining spot for Bron Buorstag Hlammythyl, High Priest [[Gormstadd]], and several Zhen agents when Madoc was staying in Voonlar. They noticed and confronted Madoc over the theft. The dwarf revealed his affiliation to the Hero of Daggerford and begged for his help. Despite the adventurer's involvement, the Bron challenged the Hero to a duel over the head of his treacherous employer.

Outside the Swords Meet, intoxicated brute Buorstag clashed with the Hero but was knocked out cold. Despite the agreement to spare the dwarf's life if the Hero emerged victorious, Gormstadd simply ordered Madoc's execution, which swiftly ended his life.
