Baroness Wynne Cromm was a commander in the Lizard Marsh in the late 15 century DR.
Wynne ruled over Cromms Hold, a keep that watched over the Marsh in order to detect all signs of lizardfolk activities.
Wynne arrived in Cromms Hold around 1465 DR and spent five years rebuilding her familys hold, which had fallen into disrepair. 
Around 1485 DR, the Red Wizard of Thay Arvik Zaltos manipulated the black dragon Thoss Fyurnen to extort the water altar in Cromms Hold from Wynne,  who agreed to give the dragon the altar in exchange for her soldiers lives.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Wynne conspired with the succubus Pencheska to capture the Duchess of Daggerford, Morwen Daggerford.
