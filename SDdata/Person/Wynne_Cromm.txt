Baroness '''Wynne Cromm''' was a commander in the [[Lizard Marsh]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Wynne ruled over [[Cromm's Hold]], a keep that watched over the Marsh in order to detect all signs of [[lizardfolk]] activities.
==History==
Wynne arrived in Cromm's Hold around [[1465 DR]] and spent five years rebuilding her family's hold, which had fallen into disrepair. 

Around [[1485 DR]], the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Arvik Zaltos]] manipulated the [[black dragon]] [[Thoss Fyurnen]] to extort the [[Elemental water sphere|water altar]] in Cromm's Hold from Wynne,  who agreed to give the dragon the altar in exchange for her soldiers' lives.
 
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Wynne conspired with the [[succubus]] [[Pencheska]] to capture the Duchess of [[Daggerford]], [[Morwen Daggerford]].
