        "mainbody": "'''Phaedrus''' was a [[hollyphant]] messenger who served both [[Lathander]] and [[Seker]].",
        "Description": "As was typical of hollyphants,<ref name=BG-DiA-p237\"> Phaedrus appeared as a winged, golden-furred [[elephant]] measuring {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} in length. His feathery wings were white, his tusks had a [[silver]]-like gleam, and his [[diamond]]-esque eyes refracted light in a full rainbow of colors. Owing to a previous encounter with a [[death knight]], his left ear featured a large nick.",
        "Personality": "Although cheerful by [[human]] standards, Phaedrus was serious and aggressive compared to other hollyphants. He was insightful and his humor had a sardonic streak.\n\nPhaedrus had a vendetta against the [[undead]] ever since his confrontation with a death knight. This vendetta was the driving factor behind his service to Lathander and Seker.",
        "Abilities": "As a hollyphant, Phaedrus had both [[magic]]al and [[psionics|psionic]] abilties. He constantly ''[[detect evil|detected evil]]'' within a radius of {{SI|20|yard|long=yes}}, and had powers equivalent to the spells ''[[banishment]]'', ''[[bless]]'', ''[[cure serious wounds]]'', ''[[flame strike]]'', ''[[heal]]'', ''[[light]]'', ''[[protection from evil]]'', ''[[raise dead]]'', and ''[[teleport without error]]''. He also had access to the sciences ''[[aura sight]]'', ''[[mindlink]]'', and ''[[precognition]]'', as well as the devotions ''[[danger sense]]'', ''[[identity penetration]]'', ''[[invisibility (psionic)|invisibility]]'', ''[[know direction (psionic)|know direction]]'', ''[[know location]]'', and ''[[post-hypnotic suggestion]]''.\n\nPhaedrus could also make the hollyphant's hallmark trumpet-calls, which would manifest as either a concussive blast powerful enough to damage buildings, an eardrum-shattering sound that [[deaf]]ens those caught in its wake, or a shower of \"sun-sparkles\" composed of [[positive energy]].",
        "Activities": "In his capacity as a divine messenger, Phaedrus would typically send [[adventurer]]s on quests that contributed to the larger struggle against the undead. Typical missions included destroying artifacts of undeath, defeating powerful undead beings, and infiltrating and breaking up undead-oriented organizations such as [[necromancer]] cabals and cults to gods of undeath. In order to facilitate these quests, Phaedrus would sometimes lead his agents to magical items useful against the undead, such as ''[[amulet versus undead|amulets versus undead]]'', ''[[wand of illumination|wands of illumination]]'', ''[[sun blade]]s'' and ''[[mace of disruption|maces of disruption]]''.\n\nPhaedrus also granted empowering boons to the faithful [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s of Lathander and Seker, and he warned against the use of ''[[animate dead]]'' lest they incur the displeasure of these deities."
