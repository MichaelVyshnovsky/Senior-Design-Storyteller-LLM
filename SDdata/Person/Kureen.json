        "mainbody": "'''Lady Kureen''' was a noblewoman from the city of [[Samargol]], [[Samarach]], ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Lady Kureen offered patronage and protection to several merchants who operated in cities and towns of Samarach. One of the traders she patronized operated in the hamlet of [[Nimbre]]. In 1374 DR, the villagers of Nimbre were accused of being associated and corrupted by the much-hated [[yuan-ti]] and the Samarach Patrol was rounding up the accused to stand trial in Samargol. Lady Kureen's merchant, however, remained unharassed, thanks to the noblewoman's influence."
