        "mainbody": "'''Dana''', whose full, [[Gnome|gnomish]] name was '''Danajustiantorala''', was a crewmember of the [[Gnomish sidewheeler|sidewheeler]] [[Unquenchable (spelljammer)|''Unquenchable'']] and later a passenger aboard the [[hammership]], the ''[[Probe]]''.",
        "Description": "Dana was a full-bosomed gnomish woman who usually dressed in typical gnomish garb, including a work [[apron]]. Her voice was sharp-toned.",
        "Personality": "Dana was not particularly known for either her good humor or her wit and often appeared disgusted with or offended by non-gnomes,",
        "Relationships": "Dana initially seemed to despise [[Teldin Moore]], the [[human]] whom her ship had rescued, at first not even being willing to speak to him. She seemed to gain respect for him, however, when he shot a pirate at a long range who was manning a [[ballista]] atop the [[Wasp (spelljammer)|wasp]] that was bearing down on them.\n\nOver the many days of their journey together, her respect for Teldin continued to grow, until it turned to affection and perhaps more. Teldin did not notice this until the beginning of the battle in which she would lose her life.",
        "History": "In [[1361 DR]], Dana was one of three other gnomes chosen by [[Horvath]] to inspect the ''Unquenchable'' for damage after it escaped from the planet [[Krynn]] with a refugee named Teldin Moore. While they were inspecting the larger vessel from a longboat, space pirates attacked, and the five were abandoned and later rescued by a [[hammership]], the ''Probe''. At first, Dana threatened the first mate of the ship, [[Aelfred Silverhorn]], at [[crossbow]] point, but she eventually relented and agreed to be taken onboard. Aelfred assigned her to duty assisting [[Bubbo]], the weapons master, with tuning the heavy weapons, and she made several modifications to the [[ballista]] turret.\n\nOn the journey from [[Krynnspace]] to [[Toril]], while in the [[Phlogiston]], the ''Probe'' was attacked by a [[neogi deathspider]]. Dana was among the four crew required to operate the forecastle ballista turret. The adjustments that she had made seemed to work exceedingly well; unfortunately, the weapon only was able to release two bolts before it was struck by return fire from the spidership and exploded, killing two of the crew.\n\nDana survived the flying shrapnel from the shattered weapon but was in shock until she was emboldened by seeing Teldin raise his sword. She drew her own [[dagger]] and prepared to fight against the impending boarding by the [[neogi]]'s slaves. Before they were boarded, however, she likely saved Teldin's life by leading him to cover, as the passing deathspider fired its [[jettison]] against the ''Probe's'' decks. Teldin last saw her as she went to tend to a wounded crewmember who had taken many wounds from the jettison shot.\n\nThe ship was indeed boarded, after first being entrapped in the neogi vessel's grappling arms. They managed to slay most of the attacking [[human]] and [[umber hulk]] slaves before finally breaking free and flying off into the flow, but only after great loss of life. At the end of the battle, Teldin was crushed to see the gnome Horvath carrying the body of a fallen Dana. \"She wanted to see you,\" he said, \"&hellip;but she went before I could reach you.\""
