Ralmek was the stable-master for the Thayan enclave within the city of Proskur around 1372 DR. It was his duty to maintain the stables stock of supplies and horses, for the enclaves high-ranking Red Wizards. He was assisted in his duties by a few stable boys, who maintained diligent cleanliness within the stables pens.
As a mid-level employee of the enclave, Ralmek was also a member of Guild of Foreign Trade.
At some point, khazark Chathin Zurn informed Ralmek that if the smell from the stables ever became too intense within the enclave she would have him shipped back to Thay as a slave.
