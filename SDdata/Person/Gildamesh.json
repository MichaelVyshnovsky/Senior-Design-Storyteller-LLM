        "mainbody": "Gildamesh was an innkeeper and the owner of the Black Stone Inn in Daggerford around 1370 DR.\nGildamesh appeared to be a gruff-looking man with angry and grim facial expression of a person looking for a fight.\nGildamesh considered his inn to be his one true love.\nGildamesh bought a former ballroom where Zhentarim agents had once committed a mass murder and turned it into an inn. Many people believed him to be a Zhent. He himself, although, insinuated dislike of the Black Network and in 1372 DR would warn his well-paying customers of the recent increase of Zhentarim activity in Daggerford and claimed that only good Zhent was a dead one."
