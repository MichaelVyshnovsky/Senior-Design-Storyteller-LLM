        "mainbody": "ray Onderquill was a novice gnome wizard in the late 15 century DR.\nCirca 1491 DR, Cray Onderquill ran an errand from Neverwinter to Waterdeep for her master. She spent one night at the Wayside Inn on the High Road. On the same night, the inn was taken over by the Cult of Talos. Cray magically disguised herself to impersonate a Talos cultist, then hid under the bed in one of the guest rooms as the cultists began snatching people. She observed that most other guests were impaled as sacrifices that Martisha Vinetalker, the innkeeper, was held captive in the cellar and that Tarbin Tul, a local bard, was taken away. The cultists tried to turn the Wayside Inn into a temple of Talos and summoned a violent thunderstorm around the inn in the process. Fortunately, a group of adventurers rescued Cray and she helped them to stop the ritual in time."
