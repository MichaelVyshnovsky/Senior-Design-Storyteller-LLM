Yaereene Ilbaereth was an elf of House Ilbaereth and the proprietor of the Elfstone Tavern, a tavern aimed at elves and half-elves in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep. She usually had a blue-green faerie dragon familiar named Pyrith on her shoulder.
Yaereene was tall with silvery eyes, and pale copper skin.
Malruthiia Chaadren was Yaereenes illegitimate half-sister. After Malruthiias death, Yaereene sorely missed her, despite her familys general view on the matter.
