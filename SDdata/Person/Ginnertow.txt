'''Ginnertow''' was a [[deep gnome]] harbormaster of [[Blingdenstone]] in [[1484 DR]].
   
==History==
Ginnertow had been the harbormaster from around [[1464 DR]], always managing the harbor without big troubles.

Just after the start of the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in 1484 DR, however, suddenly the entire harbor froze, killing many sailors and porters. The leaders of Blingdenstone ordered the closing of the harbor and Ginnertow fell into a depression, retreating into the [[Golden Hills Hearth]] festhall.

She agreed to lead to the harbor a group of adventurers hired by [[Axelcrantz]]. They discovered the culprits behind the freezing were [[fimbrul devil]]s. They went on to defeat the devils, allowing the city's harbor to open once more.

==Personality==
Ginnertow had greatly enjoyed the trade treaty with [[Gracklstugh]] because this meant more goods through her harbor.
