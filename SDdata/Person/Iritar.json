        "mainbody": "adventurer\nIritar, nicknamed \"the Dark\", was a human wizard and a Merchant Duke of the city of Calaunt in the Vast in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was also the Night Hood of the Shadowcloaks thieves guild.\nIritar was formerly an adventurer in Bellass Band, under Bellas Thanatar. Each member of the band grew wealthy by following Bellass orders.\nAround the 1330s DR, Bellass Band took power in the city of Calaunt. Bellas named himself Supreme Scepter, while Iritar and the others took the title of Merchant Duke.\nIritar the Dark was cold-hearted and sadistic, and infamous for inventively butchering those apprentices who failed him.\nIritar and the dukes grew increasingly wealthy and powerful by following Bellas and supporting his rule. In all decisions on major policies, Iritar had one vote while Bellas had two.\nIritar and the Dukes often confiscated property and magic from visitors, allegedly \"for the benefit of the city\", but mostly used it only for personal gain and use, to increase their power. They acquired a large collection of magical items this way, and still sought more. In particular, Duke Iritar was suspected to slay and rob any wizard of even middling power who stayed long in Calaunt, to secure the dukes rule.\nDuke Iritar possessed some form of magical control over the citys two barons, Uthorn and Wenszrin, who were in fact doppelgangers. Uthorn and Wenszrin served the Merchant Dukes as spies, scouts, and commanded their armies.\nIritar maintained many disguises and identities himself. Unknown to all, he was also the mysterious Night Hood, the leader of the Shadowcloaks, a thieves guild that dominated Calaunt. As the Night Hood, he assigned perilous missions to prospective members, and full members could not remove their cursed shadowcloaks without his express permission. Thanks to its curse, the Night Hood was unconcerned with his minions fleeing the city.\nHe lived in a palatial house close to the Fortress of the Five Vultures."
