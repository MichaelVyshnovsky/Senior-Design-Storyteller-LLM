        "mainbody": "'''Ishistu''' was a [[living idol|living animal idol]] once worshiped as a [[god]] by the [[Zakharan pantheon|non-Enlightened]] people of the city of [[Moradask]], in what would later be known as the [[Haunted Lands]].",
        "Description": "This living idol was constructed entirely of [[ivory]] and had large [[diamond]] eyes that were each worth around 10,000 [[gold piece]]s. It depicted a hairless [[rat]] with [[albinism]]. Inscribed upon it were words talking about the glory of perfection that was the state of being hairless.",
        "Abilities": "Like all living idols, the powers of Ishistu were proportional to the amount of worshipers they had. At the height of its power, the living idol was immune to most [[spell]]s and could only be harmed by weapons with a ''+3 [[enchantment]]''.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[800 DR]],{{AQ-time}}<ref group=\"note\">According to the source, the reign of the first Grand Caliph ended \"more than five centuries past\", but began some \"six centuries ago\", before the current time of the setting. the people of Moradask gradually grew so corrupt that they no longer cared to work to support their own decadence. At this, Ishistu and the other living idols of the city whispered to them that their neighbors were undeserving of what they had and that they should steal from them.\n\nThe next year, the First [[Grand Caliph]] of Zakhara and his armies retaliated against the plunderers, harrying them back to Moradask and plundering it themselves, stripping the temple of Ishistu and those of the other living idols of their valuables. During this short occupation by the Grand Caliph's army, the inhabitants of Moradask hid their living idols underground to ensure their safety and barricaded themselves in the farthest reaches of the city's underground catacombs, taking some of the temple valuables with them and ultimately never returning to their legendary idols.\n\nBy the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], many of Ishistu's altars and smaller stone idols remained in the city. Around this time [[Sa'ib al-Banu]] and his devoted followers, the [[Shorn]], stumbled upon the ruins of Moradask after many years of trekking across the Haunted Lands in search of a city that Sa'ib had allegedly been told about by the [[Gods of the Pantheon]].\n\nTranslating the inscriptions upon Ishistu, the two men came to find that its tenants closely matched their own and became compelled to not only protect the living idol, but to worship it. The idol spoke to Sa'ib in particular, promising to protect him and the Shorn from the monsters that inhabited Moradask's catacombs if they would adorn its altar with their hair. Tentatively they agreed and over time the beliefs of the Shorn became warped-&mdash;no longer were they worshipers of the Gods of the Pantheon, only Ishistu. Eventually the idol rewarded Sa'ib for his efforts by turning him into a [[wererat]], though one incapable of spreading his form of [[lycanthropy]] to others.\n\nAround [[1367 DR]],{{AQ-time}} the [[janni]] Sheikh [[Ardasir al-Darah]] hired a group of [[adventurer]]s to retrieve for him the missing fragments of the ancient [[Peacock Throne]] of Moradask. This quest would come to bring the adventurers into the Temple of Ishistu and eventually confront the idol itself, who would try to ''[[charm]]'' them into worshiping it. By this time the living idol had grown tremendously powerful from the Shorn's worship and ''[[polymorph]]ed'' into a [[giant rat|giant albino rat]] to confront the adventurers. After much fighting, they managed to destroy Ishistu, driving its head-priest Sa'ib to kill themselves."
