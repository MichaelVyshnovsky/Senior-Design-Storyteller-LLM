'''King Anthrus Strongarms''' was the ruler of the [[dwarves]] of [[Ironfang Deep]] in [[Turmish]], and had been so for over half a century by [[1370 DR]].

A veteran of the [[Campaign of Darkness]], King Strongarms was as a result very untrusting of the [[duergar]], even more so than he was of [[human]]s.
