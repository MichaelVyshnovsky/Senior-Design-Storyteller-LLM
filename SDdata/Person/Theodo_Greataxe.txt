Theodo Greataxe was a dwarf and commander of a small group of other dwarves who made a valiant final stand upon Dead Dwarf Bridge.
In order to give Almorel time to prepare against an invasion from Narfell, Theodo and seven other dwarves blocked their passage across Clearflow Bridge. The bodies of the enemy piled high around the brave combatants, but all eventually succumbed to their injuries.
In his final moments, Theodo shattered his magical weapon, Greataxeson, upon the bridge, cracking it in the center, before charging the enemy with only the handle of his weapon.
All eight of the dwarves who perished upon the bridge returned as undead to stand guard there for all time.
