        "mainbody": "Jasmal was a shield dwarf sage and cleric of Dumathoin inhabiting Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nShe had a light beard and smiled most of the time unless she suspected she was being lied to.\nJasmal was well-known for her knowledge of engineering, architecture, stonecraft, weaponry, and the fauna of the Sword Coast. She wintered in Waterdeep but spent the rest of the year wandering northwest Faerûn in search of ancient Delzoun artifacts and observing wildlife. While within the City of Splendors Jasmal could usually be found in her room in the Warrens in the Dock Ward or at Selûnes Smile."
