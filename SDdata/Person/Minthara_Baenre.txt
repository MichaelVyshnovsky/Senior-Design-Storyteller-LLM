Nightwarden '''Minthara Baenre''' was a [[True Soul]] and a leader within the [[cult of the Absolute]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Praise [[the Absolute]]...she will reward us well for this exquisite carnage.}}

==Personality==
Minthara oversaw the raids and attacks the cult made as an extension of the Absolute's will. She believed anyone not dedicated to the Absolute was a mere infidel.

Despite her strong and willful exterior, Minthara held feelings of great fear that she kept hidden deep within her psyche. From her perspective, she learned to harness this fear and strengthen her will.

==Abilities==
{{Quote|She will test you. If you fail, you will break; if your faith is strong, you will become something even more beautiful.|Minthara, about the Absolute.}}

Like others of her kind, Minthara shared a psychic connection with the other "True Souls" of the Absolute. She bore a brand of the Absolute, such as those that were offered by High Priestess [[Gut]].

==Possessions==
She wore a stylized suit of [[drow]] leather armor along with an ''[[amulet of misty step]]'' and wielded the unique [[mace]] ''[[Xyanyde]]''.

==Activities==
True Soul Minthara was responsible for scouting operations as well as the interrogation of its prisoners.

==Relationships==
[[File:Minthara betrayal.png|thumb|''Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!''|420x420px]]
Throughout her whole life, Minthara experienced significant loss. Many members of her family, along with her friends and former lovers, were all killed at the hands of others. Minthara's first lover was a High Priestess from the drow [[House Vandree]] of Menzoberranzan. She thought the priestess to be beautiful, elegant, and ruthless. The two adored each other, and their relationship lasted for some time until Minthara received an order to end the High Priestess. Minthara [[poison]]ed her lover and stayed at her side, whispering words of comfort until the priestess died.

Minthara controlled a camp of goblin minions alongside their High Priestess Gut, and the [[hobgoblin]] warlord [[Dror Ragzlin]]. She was directly served by the cult's torturer [[Spike (goblin)|Spike]], as well as their head scout [[Rozzak]]. The goblin named [[Klagga]] was infatuated with Minthara and often fantasized about her. Klagga hoped to spill enough blood in raids to attract the attention of the Absolute and, in turn, Minthara's.

While under the Absolute's control, Minthara adored and faithfully served [[Orin]], but her own mind deeply despised the [[changeling]] for enthralling her into the Absolute's service.

==History==
{{fq
| text   = Yes. My House trained me to be a soldier in Lolth's service, and my mother showed me how to survive the perils of society. She taught me to be resilient, and to guard my heart from those who cannot be trusted. Literally and figuratively.

Minthara received a tough and cruel upbringing. Born into the [[House Baenre]] of [[Menzoberranzan]], she survived her first assassination attempt while a newborn, suckling on her mother's breast. Her mother protected the newborn and received a dagger wound while protecting her daughter. Later, Minthara claimed that day she tasted her mother's blood mixed with [[milk]]. Years later, Minthara's own mother attempted to assassinate her and received a scar to match the one received while protecting the newborn drow.

Minthara's indoctrination into the Absolutist fate began through manipulation. The cult sent an envoy, two worshippers of the new deity. They arrived at Menzoberranzan preaching the Absolute's love. Of course, the emissaries were murdered, and their corpses became a grotesque decoration. These cultists, however, did their job. Their audacity bothered Minthara greatly. She gathered a band of loyal fighters to pay the cult a visit. When she arrived at the [[Moonrise Towers]], Minthara was greeted with praise and fanfare as a guest of honor instead of an enemy. A feast followed, thrown in Minthara's honor, during which [[Orin]] the Red, one of the cult's leaders, danced across the table, cutting the necks of Minthara's men open. The drow woman was the only survivor, favored by Orin as the shapeshifter's new toy. She personally took Minthara into the towers' cellars and held the drow as the Absolute infected her with a [[mind flayer]] tadpole, making Minthara a [[True Soul]].

The mental control of the Absolute deluded Minthara's mind. She found herself being almost infatuated by Orin the Red. The drow eagerly absorbed the shapeshifter's every word and took up arms in service of the new goddess.

When an [[illithid]] ''[[nautiloid]]'' crashed near the [[River Chionthar]] in the {{yearlinkName|1492}}, Minthara and Dror Ragzlin sent out goblin search parties to recover a ''[[mysterious artifact]]''. The pair also sought the whereabouts of a group of individuals granted powers by the Absolute but who had not yet been made into True Souls.

A short time later, she orchestrated the cult's raid on the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn, along with the attempted abduction of [[Grand Duke]] [[Ulder Ravengard]] to the cult's fortress at Moonrise Towers.

Shortly thereafter, she sought to launch an assault on the nearby [[Emerald Grove]], believing they were in possession of the artifact the Absolute desired.
