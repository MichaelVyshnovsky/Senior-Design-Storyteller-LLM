'''Keirgar''' was a [[dwarf]] prince who was captured by the [[drow]] minions of [[Xanathar]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Description==
He was heavily muscled and had long blonde hair, a long beard and blue eyes. He was a fantastic fighter, with incredible strength and unmatched physique, as well as being charismatic.

==History==
Around 1358 DR, Keirgar was captured alive by a group of drow. His clan believed that he was captured by the neighboring drow settlement, but they were actually the lackeys of the evil [[beholder]], Xanathar. An adventuring party rescued him, and returned him to his clan. Keirgar then offered to join them.
