Keirgar was a dwarf prince who was captured by the drow minions of Xanathar in 1358 DR.
He was heavily muscled and had long blonde hair, a long beard and blue eyes. He was a fantastic fighter, with incredible strength and unmatched physique, as well as being charismatic.
Around 1358 DR, Keirgar was captured alive by a group of drow. His clan believed that he was captured by the neighboring drow settlement, but they were actually the lackeys of the evil beholder, Xanathar. An adventuring party rescued him, and returned him to his clan. Keirgar then offered to join them.
