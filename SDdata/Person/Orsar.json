        "mainbody": "'''Orsar \"Greencloak\"''' was a [[half-elf]] [[wizard]] of [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. ''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], he was one of the notable mages of the city.",
        "Personality": "He was tight-lipped and reclusive.",
        "Activities": "Orsar busied himself in creating and perfecting [[spell]]s, [[magic item]]s, and [[potion]]s involving the ability to fly. He funded himself by selling his potions, but at incredible prices.\n\nSecretly, Orsar was a friend to Lord [[Dhelt]], the ruler of Elturel, and served him as a spy inside the city. He often went invisible and in a wraith form to sneak around the city, a habit unknown to the majority of Elturians."
