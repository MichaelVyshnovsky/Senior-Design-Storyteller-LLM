        "mainbody": "Orsar \"Greencloak\" was a half-elf wizard of Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the midâ€“14 century DR. Circa 1358 DR, he was one of the notable mages of the city.\nHe was tight-lipped and reclusive.\nOrsar busied himself in creating and perfecting spells, magic items, and potions involving the ability to fly. He funded himself by selling his potions, but at incredible prices.\nSecretly, Orsar was a friend to Lord Dhelt, the ruler of Elturel, and served him as a spy inside the city. He often went invisible and in a wraith form to sneak around the city, a habit unknown to the majority of Elturians."
