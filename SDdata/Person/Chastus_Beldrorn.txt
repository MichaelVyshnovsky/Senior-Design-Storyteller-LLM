Chastus Beldrorn was a local herald based in Darromar, Tethyr, in 1372 DR.
Chastus was known to be enamored with his own importance and imperious to those who challenged his authority.
As a Herald, he was an expert in blazonry and the protocol of nobility.
Chastus Beldrorn was comfortably wealthy.
Chastus served the Duchess of the Purple Marches in the capacity of Herald over non-noble blazonry, including millers marks, guild symbols, merchant fleet flags, trading coster badges, and other symbols of commerce around Darromar.
During his bitter squabble with Ilmurk Jongrath, he hired some henchmen and led them against Jongraths Mill in order to confiscate some newly painted shields displaying heraldic devices. Jongrath dissuaded them with a few well-placed crossbow bolts.
Beldrorn and his fellow Herald from Myratma, Aldrur Hariburt, were particularly nettled by an amateur heraldist named Ilmurk Jongrath. They accused him of usurping their authority, undercutting their prices, and generally being unfit to practice heraldry in any capacity. Jongrath was not in violation of any law and the two heralds could not get Duchess Haresdown to agree that official action should be taken against him. Consequently, Beldrorn and Hariburt resorted to spreading rumors in various circles that Jongrath was an outright thief, a Calishite spy, and a revolutionary out to overthrow the new (as of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR) power structure of Tethyr.
