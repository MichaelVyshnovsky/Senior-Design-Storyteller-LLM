==Abilities==
After merely speaking to someone, Kveroslava was able to discern an aspect of their character, offer them some advice, and even possibly gleam some insight into their future. While the information she gathered was often vague it was generally quite accurate.

She offered a reading to passers by for a mere 10 [[gp]].

==Activities==
Kveroslava and her family traveled with a band of Amnian merchants.

==Relationships==
Kveroslava was the matriarch of the Rom family and in her own words its heart. She had a partner in [[Mastav]] and traveled with two sons, [[Rinin]] and the elder [[Jidek]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Kveroslava and her family were stuck outside the city of [[Trademeet]] when it was blockaded by the [[genie]], [[Zahraa|Khan Zahraa]].
