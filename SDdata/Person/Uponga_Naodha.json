        "mainbody": "'''Uponga Naodha''' was a captain of the guard of [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|I do not have time to bandy words with travelers.|Uponga Naodha}}",
        "History": "During the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} Captain Naodha expressed interest to the [[Tearah Initoo|Master of the Market]] about outfitting his subordinates in [[breastplate]] [[armor]] from the [[Sword Coast]]. While he understood that the Chultan heat made such armor impractical, he had also grown frustrated with how vulnerable the guards were when faced with the monsters of the jungle. His solution was to commission a foreign [[blacksmith|smith]] to craft [[titansteel]] armor for him."
