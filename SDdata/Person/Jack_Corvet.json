        "mainbody": "'''Jack Corvet''' was an ill-fated adventurer who met his doom sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Jack Corvet took upon himself the adventuring career after receiving a lucky [[ring]] from his grandmother. Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Jack attempted to steal [[gold]]en [[chicken]] from a [[cloud giant]]. Jack overestimated his skills and he was caught in the act.  The adventurer whispered a plea upon his lucky ring and to everyone's surprise, Jack grew in size, big enough to be able to punch the giant out.\n\nWhen the chicken laid a golden [[egg]], Jack sold it and, with the money, replaced his old raggedy pair of [[boots]]. Later, Jack Corvet attempted the robbery once again, but the \"magic\" ring failed to enlarge the man. Jack was killed during that adventure and his old discarded pair of boots became known as ''[[Jack's Folly]]''."
