Morlgorn Rionthas was a semi-retired adventurer who lived in Tarmalune as of 1479 DR.
As an adventurer, Morlgorn won considerable wealth. After retiring from an adventuring life, Morlgorn used his fortune to help the poor citizens of Tarmalune, as well the honest workers of the city. He also sought to form guilds and foster informal cooperation along less
wealthy merchants, to prevent members of the Council of Tarmalune and powerful merchants from having so much political power.
