        "mainbody": "'''Jareth Grim''' was the battle-leader of the [[Blackdagger Bandits]] that plagued travelers along the [[High Road]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{Quote|...you're in charge of our raiding operations until I get back. All you need to do is keep the Blackdaggers going like nothing is wrong, Jareth, so no one gets suspicious.|Traven Blackdagger, in a letter to Jareth Grim. }}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Jareth was put in charge of the Blackdaggers' raiding operations while [[Traven Blackdagger]] accompanied the [[Red Wizard]] [[necromancer]] [[Kallos Tam]] into the [[Cragmire Crypts]] to gather [[undead]] forces and [[Malus Blackdagger]] prepared the defenses of [[Blackdagger Keep]] and an attack of [[Neverwinter]] itself. Jareth's role was to make it seem as if it was business as usual for the Blackdaggers and oppose the [[adventurer]] recruited by the [[Harpers]] to foil them. During this time, Jareth visited [[Krag Foultooth]] at [[Angelhead Mine]] for a report on their excavations there, before returning to Blackdagger Keep. Finally, Jareth's end came at the hands of the adventurer, who was directed by [[Garl Gnarlclaw]] to infiltrate Grimstorm Keep and slay the bandit captain. His death left the Blackdaggers in disarray and led to their final defeat.",
        "Activities": "While battle-leader of the Blackdaggers, Jareth based himself in a tower of Blackdagger Keep, nicknamed [[Grimstorm Keep]], likely for himself. There he lived like a pirate king, complete with his own throne."
