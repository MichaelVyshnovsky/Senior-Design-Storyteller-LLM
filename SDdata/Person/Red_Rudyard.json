        "mainbody": "Red Rudyard was the headman of the village Volkumburgh, as well as the proprietor of its sole inn the Crimson Wyrm, in the 14 century DR.\nIn 1358, in the month of Uktar some time prior to the Feast of the Moon, a group of adventurers arrived from Suzail, seeking out the scattered remains of the fabled Awtawmatawn on behalf of Amelior Amanitas. When they came to the Crimson Wyrm its proprietor served them a free round of hot cider and enquired as to whether they had ever slain a dragon before.\nEventually those adventurers retrieved all the fragments of Awtawmatawn, which Amelior proceeded to reconstruct, and the horned devil possessing it started to rampage in the village. Rudyard pleaded with the adventurers to help them against both the Awtawmatawn and the two forces falling upon their village &mdash the undead minions of Lychor and the neanderthals of Valmous. When managed to destroy the gargantuan stone golem it collapsed on top of the Crimson Wyrm, it revealed a hidden cavern beneath his inn that held the lost treasure of Lord Volkumburgh.\nOnce all the conflict had settled Rudyard ruled that both Amelior and Lychor needed to be punish for the deaths and destruction they caused."
