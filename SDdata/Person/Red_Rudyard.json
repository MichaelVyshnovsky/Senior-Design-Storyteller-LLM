        "mainbody": "'''Red Rudyard''' was the headman of the village [[Volkumburgh]], as well as the proprietor of its sole inn the [[Crimson Wyrm]], in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In [[1358]],{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} in the month of [[Calendar of Harptos|Uktar]] some time prior to the [[Feast of the Moon]], a group of [[adventurer]]s arrived from [[Suzail]], seeking out the scattered remains of the fabled [[Awtawmatawn]] on behalf of [[Amelior Amanitas]]. When they came to the Crimson Wyrm its proprietor served them a free round of hot [[cider]] and enquired as to whether they had ever slain a [[dragon]] before.\n\nEventually those adventurers retrieved all the fragments of Awtawmatawn, which Amelior proceeded to reconstruct, and the [[horned devil]] possessing it started to rampage in the village. Rudyard pleaded with the adventurers to help them against both the Awtawmatawn and the two forces falling upon their village &mdash; the [[undead]] minions of [[Lychor]] and the [[neanderthal]]s of [[Valmous]]. When managed to destroy the gargantuan [[stone golem]] it collapsed on top of the Crimson Wyrm, it revealed a hidden cavern beneath his inn that held the lost treasure of [[Lord Volkumburgh]].\n\nOnce all the conflict had settled Rudyard ruled that both Amelior and Lychor needed to be punish for the deaths and destruction they caused."
