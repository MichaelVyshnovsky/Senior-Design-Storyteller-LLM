King Coram III of House Tethyr was the eighth king of the Lions Dynasty of Tethyr.
Coram III was the third-oldest great-grandson of King Alemander I. He was the grandfather of Alemander II, who would succeed him. Coram III had two older brothers, Prince Valys and Prince Priam as well as niece and nephew named Majal and Vyshan.
During his reign, the Kings Crown, a magical relic of Tethyrian nobility, was crafted for Coram.
Coram was born in the Year of the Perilous Storm, 1112 DR.
On one dark and stormy night, Corams older brother Valys entered the family estate â€“ Carlsmere, located on The Bite of the Dragons Head Peninsula. That night became a night of tragedy when Prince Valys smothered his older brother, Prince Priam, along with royal children, Majal and her brother Vyshan. With the murders, Prince Valys ensured the crown was to be passed on to him from his great-grandfather Alemander I. However that was not to be. Coram III was a talented ranger who used his skills to track down and unveil the culprits identity. Coram challenged his brother to a duel in which he was wounded but successfully ended his murderous brothers life. Coram disemboweled Valys and burned his corpse. Following the tragedy, Coram ordered Carlsmere to be abandoned.
He was crowned in 1145, the Year of the Smiling Flame.
In the same year as his coronation, Coram III officially changed the name of his family. Previously, they had been known as House Ithal-Strohm-Bormul after this point, he mandated that they be called simply House Tethyr. Some believed that he did this to distance himself from the Bormul merchant family of Amn, who were rumored to be slave-dealers.
During his reign, the knightly order of the Champions Vigilant was founded.
Coram died in 1181 DR and was succeeded by Alemander II.
