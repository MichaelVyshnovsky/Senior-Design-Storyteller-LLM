        "Activities": "He protected Fennimar from undesired creatures and aided travelers in the realm. He usually worked in secret, such as by stocking Fennimar's waystations or disturbing aggressive wildlife to drive off invaders.",
        "History": "Avery's native forest tribe was all but wiped out by [[orc]]s while he was out hunting alone. When he returned, the survivors made a scapegoat of him and banished him. He wandered until he found a ''[[portal]]'' to [[Sigil]] and used it to travel to Fennimar."
