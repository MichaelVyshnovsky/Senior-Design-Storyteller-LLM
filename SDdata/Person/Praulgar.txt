'''Praulgar''' was a [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]] of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He pretended to be a pot seller, '''Nargalarr''', during his last mission.

==Description==
He wore robes.

==Personality==
As Nargalarr, he acted as a somewhat dim-witted man. In truth, he was a petty tyrant, hated by his guards.

==Abilities==
He had a spell-shield of sorts that could block a dagger, but would be exhausted after blocking one. One of his spells created lingering, deadly green flames.

==Relationships==
He had four guards with him. None of them liked him very much.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|163|10}}

==History==
Praulgar joined [[Orthil Voldovan]]'s caravan heading from [[Scornubel]] to [[Waterdeep]] in late {{yearlink|1357}}, shadowing [[Shandril Shessair]], who was traveling in the same caravan; he posed as a pot seller. During a chaotic ambush upon the caravan, he attempted to deceive Shandril into trusting him, but he was slain mid-sentence with two successive thrown daggers while trying to convince her he was out to protect her. His guards later struck his corpse with swords given the opportunity.

Praulgar's slayer was in turn slain by [[Narm]], per [[Hlael Toraunt]] and [[Korthauvar Hammantle]], who were scrying on the events as they unfolded.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|270-271|16}}
