        "History": "{{quote\n|There are things that should not be understood. There are things that must not be spoken. When the time comes, you'll know what to do.\n|''Tyver advising Feena on how to handle ''[[The Leaves of One Night]]''''\n}}\n\nTyver served Selûne as a werewolf of the New Moon Pact, fighting against the faith's enemies around [[Berdusk]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. In [[757 DR]], the High Moonmistress [[Brima Chintamn]] of [[Bright Lady's Tower]] in [[Chancelgaunt]] declared the New Moon Pact a heresy, and Tyver was among those captured and executed.\n\nWhen [[Feena Archwood]] investigated the mystery of the New Moon Pact in [[1373 DR]], Tyver's spirit appeared in her dreams alongside the other members of the Pact to defend and guide her through the challenges to come. After she uncovered [[Velsinore]]'s heresy and they mutually slew each other, Feena's spirit was met by a [[Shards|Shard]] escort to the afterlife, but Tyver and the other Pact members encouraged her to return to life and join the New Moon Pact herself. With the aid of [[Julith Harkspur]]'s healing, Feena was revived and ultimately continued the legacy of the Pact."
