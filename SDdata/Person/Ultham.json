        "mainbody": "'''Ultham, son of Urrekanam''', also known as '''Ultham-Urre''', was a powerful [[archmage]] and [[planewalker]] of [[Chessenta]] in the 10{{th}} or early 11{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. He created the ''[[Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre]]''.",
        "Personality": "Known to be fairly pleasant (at least for a [[wizard]]), Ultham had a great love of [[Oslin]], a small trading village near the hills where he lived. He enjoyed playing [[chess (game)|chess]] with the village elders for hours on end.",
        "History": "Although the facts are lost to history, sages theorized that, sometime during the reign of King [[Tchazzar]] ([[929 DR|929]]â€“[[1018 DR]]), Ultham predicted Chessenta's swift collapse and subsequent incessant warring. Thus, using minerals and [[gems]] found in the Hills of Maerth, he created the ''Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre'' to defend Oslin and his friends. He even stocked the inside of the pieces with supplies: water, non-perishable food, [[armor]], [[weapon]]s, equipment, and [[material component|spell components]]. Before he journeyed into the [[planes]], he left the ''Chessmen'' in Oslin, where for several years they were just used as simple chess pieces.",
        "Possessions": "He kept a slender tower in the [[Hills of Maerth]] in southern Chessenta.\n\nPresumably named for him, a [[magical item]] called a ''billet of Ultham'' (a [[metamagic rod|''lesser rod of quickened metamagic'']]) lay in the palace treasury of [[Cimbar]] and later the hoard of Tchazzar by [[1374 DR]].<ref>"
