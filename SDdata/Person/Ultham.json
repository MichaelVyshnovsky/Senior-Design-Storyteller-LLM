        "mainbody": "Ultham, son of Urrekanam, also known as Ultham-Urre, was a powerful archmage and planewalker of Chessenta in the 10 or early 11 centuries DR. He created the Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre.\nKnown to be fairly pleasant (at least for a wizard), Ultham had a great love of Oslin, a small trading village near the hills where he lived. He enjoyed playing chess with the village elders for hours on end.\nAlthough the facts are lost to history, sages theorized that, sometime during the reign of King Tchazzar (929â€“1018 DR), Ultham predicted Chessentas swift collapse and subsequent incessant warring. Thus, using minerals and gems found in the Hills of Maerth, he created the Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre to defend Oslin and his friends. He even stocked the inside of the pieces with supplies water, non-perishable food, armor, weapons, equipment, and spell components. Before he journeyed into the planes, he left the Chessmen in Oslin, where for several years they were just used as simple chess pieces.\nHe kept a slender tower in the Hills of Maerth in southern Chessenta.\nPresumably named for him, a magical item called a billet of Ultham (a lesser rod of quickened metamagic) lay in the palace treasury of Cimbar and later the hoard of Tchazzar by 1374 DR."
