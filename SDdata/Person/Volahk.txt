'''Doomguide Volahk''' was a senior [[Kelemvor]]ite priest that served in [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Activities==
As a member of the [[Eternal Order of Kelemvor]], Volahk's mission was to preserve and keep sacred the [[Neverdeath Graveyard]] in the city. 

==History==
Circa the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Volahk was tasked with leading the efforts to wrest Neverdeath from the clutches of [[undead]] forces raised by [[Thay]]an and [[Red Wizards]] like [[Jack]] and the followers of [[Valindra Shadowmantle]]. The group was met with overwhelming forces of Thayan undead that drove them to retreat to [[Doomguide's Watch]].

Volahk then sent an expedition of his fellow [[doomguide]]s into [[Pauper's Field]] to clear out the undead in that region of Neverdeath. While the expedition's leader [[Severin]] was able to send word they were preparing to descend into [[the Rift]], the group never returned. In response, Volahk worked with an acolyte by the name of [[Mina Neyman|Neyman]] and an adventurer to find Severin and defeat the [[Red Wizards]] that had captured the doomguides.

Volahk and the adventurer tracked down the other missing doomguides. [[Falstaff]] and [[Awen]] were killed and [[Stonehammer]] turned as undead, but [[Winlof]], [[Ganilon]], and [[Severin]] were merely captured, being held by the Red Wizards in various crypts.

Finally, Volahk came to realize that the a Red Wizard by the name of [[Xivros]] sought to raise the infamous [[ogre]] warlord [[Arleon|Arleon the Unforgiven]] as an undead minion to serve their cause.
