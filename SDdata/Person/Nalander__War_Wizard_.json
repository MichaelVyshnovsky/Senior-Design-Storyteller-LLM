        "Personality": "Nalander was not the most serious person: after Elminster's apparent death in an explosion in which the old mage was caught alongside a woman, Nalander commented that Elminster's body was probably the one with the less prominent chest.",
        "Relationships": "Nalander was part of a small team together with [[Rorskryn Mreldrake]] and led by [[Andram Rendarth]].",
        "History": "Nalander was a member of the trio of War Wizards that ambushed [[Elminster Aumar]], the fugitive wizard, when he tried to sneak back into [[Castle Obarskyr]] after stealing the ''[[Royal Gorget of Battle]]''. Of note, his companion Rorskryn Mreldrake weaponized the castle's wards in the area to blast him with their force, under the orders of their captain, Rendarth. While they argued on who should go sift through the remains to confirm the kill, Elminster responded by using a ''[[wand of paralyzation]]'' or similar to stop the three of them. He then gave Mreldrake a short talk about damaging the wards.\n\nAfter the tussle, [[Manshoon]], the evil [[vampire]] [[archmage]], resolved to kill him so no more mages would try to turn the wards into an attack.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|123|12}}"
