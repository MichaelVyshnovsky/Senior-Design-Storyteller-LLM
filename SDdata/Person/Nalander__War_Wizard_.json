        "mainbody": "alander was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.\nNalander was not the most serious person after Elminsters apparent death in an explosion in which the old mage was caught alongside a woman, Nalander commented that Elminsters body was probably the one with the less prominent chest.\nNalander was part of a small team together with Rorskryn Mreldrake and led by Andram Rendarth.\nNalander was a member of the trio of War Wizards that ambushed Elminster Aumar, the fugitive wizard, when he tried to sneak back into Castle Obarskyr after stealing the Royal Gorget of Battle. Of note, his companion Rorskryn Mreldrake weaponized the castles wards in the area to blast him with their force, under the orders of their captain, Rendarth. While they argued on who should go sift through the remains to confirm the kill, Elminster responded by using a wand of paralyzation or similar to stop the three of them. He then gave Mreldrake a short talk about damaging the wards.\nAfter the tussle, Manshoon, the evil vampire archmage, resolved to kill him so no more mages would try to turn the wards into an attack."
