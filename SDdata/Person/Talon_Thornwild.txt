Talon Thornwild was an expert prospector who lived in the Sword Coast North during the late 15 century DR.
Talon did not believe that the world was an unchanging place. This fact was as true to him as any other rule of nature.
He had boorish manners and awful eating habits.
Talon absolutely loved gold and wanted nothing more than to gain great acclaim for his talents as a prospector. He was not above taking things that were not his in order to reach his goal, as long as his need for something was greater that its previous owner.
