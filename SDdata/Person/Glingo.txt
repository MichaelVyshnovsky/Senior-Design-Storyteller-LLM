==Description==
Glingo was a [[human]] man with a dark skin tone, hazel eyes, and long braided brown hair, partially dyed in a gleaming blue color. He wore red face paint on his chin and blue mascara.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Circus of the Last Days returned from the [[Feywild]] and opened its gates to the inhabitants of the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]]. Glingo entertained guests by performing trapeze stunts and aspired to be an opening act for the famous clown, beloved by many, [[Dribbles]]. Glingo was present at the circus when it was revealed that the [[Cult of the Absolute]] had murdered Dribbles and replaced him with a murderous [[doppelganger]].
