        "mainbody": "Albaerlus Gudelmer was the patriarch of the wealthy merchant Gudelmer family of Athkatla in the late 14 century DR.\nAfter the death of Albaerluss wife, his business tactics became riskier, if not reckless, than before. He cared not for blackmail attempts, and his opponents always failed at attempts to seduce the man.\nAlbaerlus had four affable and beautiful daughters Raeveshara was the oldest of the Gudelmer sisters, followed by Iylandra and the youngest twin siblings – Quaerthara and Nilunele.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Albaerlus Gudelmer and his daughters resided in the family mansion, famously haunted and beautiful Dancing Dolphins House in Athkatlas resplendent Gem District. Like many merchants of Amn, Albaerlus owned properties throughout Athkatla.\nAlbaerlus Gudelmer was an ambitious and influential merchant who built the family fortune by dealing in sails and imported glassware. He sought to increase his sway in Athkatla through the formation of alliance circles he referred to as \"shieldrings.\" Each of the shieldrings was formed of a group of merchants and business people of lower social stature, banded together to effectively stand against the more wealthy and influential merchant families of Amn, such as Argrims, Copriths, and Vymmars. Membership was cemented with a written contract and the fee of 6 danters for inhabitants of Athkatla, 12 danters for those outside of the city, and up to 20 roldons for more exclusive shieldrings.\nTo show the lack of ill intent, Albaerlus Gudelmer regularly threw lavish parties in the Dancing Dolphins House for independent merchants from the city and wider Amn. During these events, Albaerlus actively promoted his views of \"a better, happier Amn for all.\" Merchants and traders from outside of Amn were always welcomed, expanding the shieldrings.\nAs of the late 14 century DR, these existed ten shieldrings, represented by ten colorfully-decorated shields that were displayed in the Dancing Dolphins House. They were Brightbar (red warhorn), Waterdeep (blue snail shell), Boldlance (red spear), Allcircle (eight golden coins), Fairseason (crossed gold and green leaves), Manymoons (sun and moon), Windcoast (three cogs), Glowcrown (three sapphires), Pearlbright (ring of five pearls), and Shiningbeast (crossed unicorn horns).\nBy the late 14 century DR, Albaerlus Gudelmer managed to avoid direct conflicts with guilds, merchant families, and the Council of Five however, his family and dealings faced some scrutiny and several investigations into the mans motives. The Council informants were always present during Gudelmer family feasts and parties thrown in the familys manse. At one point, the Council of Five set a trap for Albaerluss operations. The councils agents tried to have the merchant involve one of his shieldrings – \"Pearlbright,\" in a kidnapping and slave sale plot. Despite being promised great profits, Gudelmer turned it down.\nThrough his activities, Albaerlus managed to negotiate lower prices on various goods purchased in bulk by Athkatlan shops, allowing lower-priced goods to be available to the wider population of the City of Coin.\nAs of the late 14 century DR, the notorious criminal power – the Shadow Thieves, left Albaerlus activities unmolested, possibly allowing the merchant network to grow only to be tapped into at some later date."
