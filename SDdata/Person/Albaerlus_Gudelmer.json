        "mainbody": "'''Albaerlus Gudelmer''' was the patriarch of the wealthy merchant [[Gudelmer]] family of [[Athkatla]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "After the death of Albaerlus's wife, his business tactics became riskier, if not reckless, than before. He cared not for blackmail attempts, and his opponents always failed at attempts to seduce the man.",
        "Relationships": "Albaerlus had four affable and beautiful daughters: [[Raeveshara Gudelmer|Raeveshara]] was the oldest of the Gudelmer sisters, followed by [[Iylandra Gudelmer|Iylandra]] and the youngest twin siblings – [[Quaerthara Gudelmer|Quaerthara]] and [[Nilunele Gudelmer|Nilunele]].",
        "Possessions": "By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Albaerlus Gudelmer and his daughters resided in the family mansion, famously haunted and beautiful [[Dancing Dolphins House]] in Athkatla's resplendent [[Athkatla/Gem District|Gem District]]. Like many merchants of Amn, Albaerlus owned properties throughout Athkatla.",
        "Activities": "Albaerlus Gudelmer was an ambitious and influential merchant who built the family fortune by dealing in sails and imported glassware. He sought to increase his sway in Athkatla through the formation of alliance circles he referred to as \"shieldrings.\" Each of the shieldrings was formed of a group of merchants and business people of lower social stature, banded together to effectively stand against the more wealthy and influential merchant families of Amn, such as [[Argrim]]s, [[Coprith]]s, and [[Vymmar]]s. Membership was cemented with a written contract and the fee of 6 [[danter]]s for inhabitants of Athkatla, 12 [[danter]]s for those outside of the city, and up to 20 [[roldon]]s for more exclusive shieldrings.\n\nTo show the lack of ill intent, Albaerlus Gudelmer regularly threw lavish parties in the Dancing Dolphins House for independent merchants from the city and wider Amn. During these events, Albaerlus actively promoted his views of \"a better, happier Amn for all.\" Merchants and traders from outside of Amn were always welcomed, expanding the shieldrings.\n\nAs of the late 14{{th}} century DR, these existed ten shieldrings, represented by ten colorfully-decorated [[shield]]s that were displayed in the Dancing Dolphins House. They were: Brightbar (red [[warhorn]]), Waterdeep (blue [[snail]] shell), Boldlance (red [[spear]]), Allcircle (eight golden [[coin]]s), Fairseason (crossed [[gold]] and green leaves), Manymoons (sun and moon), Windcoast (three cogs), Glowcrown (three [[sapphire]]s), Pearlbright (ring of five [[pearl]]s), and Shiningbeast (crossed [[unicorn]] horns).",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Albaerlus Gudelmer managed to avoid direct conflicts with guilds, merchant families, and the [[Council of Five (Amn)|Council of Five]]; however, his family and dealings faced some scrutiny and several investigations into the man's motives. The Council informants were always present during Gudelmer family feasts and parties thrown in the family's manse. At one point, the Council of Five set a trap for Albaerlus's operations. The council's agents tried to have the merchant involve one of his shieldrings – \"Pearlbright,\" in a kidnapping and slave sale plot. Despite being promised great profits, Gudelmer turned it down.\n\nThrough his activities, Albaerlus managed to negotiate lower prices on various goods purchased in bulk by Athkatlan shops, allowing lower-priced goods to be available to the wider population of the City of Coin.\n\nAs of the late 14{{th}} century DR, the notorious criminal power – the [[Shadow Thieves]], left Albaerlus' activities unmolested, possibly allowing the merchant network to grow only to be tapped into at some later date."
