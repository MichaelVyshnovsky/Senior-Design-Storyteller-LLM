Korth was a lizardfolk gladiator from Kara-Tur.
Korth was a muscular lizardman with green scales that were mottled yellow, and with a pronounced yellow and orange neck ridge. He wore blue clothing, blue battle paint, and a partial suit of light armor that left his chest bare. Korth adorned himself with several animal bones and teeth, and wore a skull over one shoulder. His head was topped with a maedate.
He was famously ruthless, never sparing a single defeated foe. Korth had a fondness for appearing "strong," and liked eating fish.
Korth was known for his great skill and speed in battle.
In battle, he carried a katana and wore a personalized banner strapped to his back.
Korth was raised in a Kara-Turan fighting pit, where he learned the gladiators trade. He eventually left the arena behind, traveling the world to study the art of war.
