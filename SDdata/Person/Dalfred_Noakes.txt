Dalfred Noakes was a halfling innkeeper in Menzoberranzan in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1486 DR, Dalfred ran the Narbondels Shadow, an inn and the "finest rooming house in Menzoberranzan" in Eastmyr district. He also opposed the drow government by smuggling goods and hiding wanted people, after an altercation with a young noble of House Hunzrin left him greatly scarred.
Dalfred adopted the half-drow Shinzi and used her as one of his spies.
