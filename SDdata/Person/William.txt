'''William''' was a villager of [[Highcliff]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
William was a villager, who got tired of his life, since he had take care of his child with [[Juni]] every day (which made him look much older). The Kalach-Cha could get the task from Juni to find him. The Kalach-Cha could persuade him to go back to his house or to let him go. Afterwards, the Kalach-Cha would need to return to Juni and tell her what William did or lie to her.
