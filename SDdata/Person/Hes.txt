'''Hes''' was a merchant from the City of Coin, [[Athkatla]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Well met, and a [[pearl]] to you. Feel free to peruse my goods and ask questions, naturally.''|Hes}}

==Description==
Galoomp was a portly man with light bronze skin. He was a pleasant and friendly man who gladly welcomed guests to Athkatla and dispensed directions and establishment recommendations.

==History==
Hes's stall could be found in the grand market in Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Center District|Center District]] â€“ [[Waukeen's Promenade]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, despite reduced stock due the recent political troubles. Hes sold some mundane miscellany including [[armor]], [[weapon]]s, ammunition, and simple concoctions like ''[[antidote]]s'' and ''[[healing potion]]s''. If asked about magic items, Hes declared he has little taste for magic and directed shoppers to the [[Adventurer Mart]].
