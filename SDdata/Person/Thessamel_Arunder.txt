'''Thessamel Arunder''', the Lord of Spells, was a [[wizard]] in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
The man was cold and haughty, fearing little more than other mages.

==Relationships==
He was somewhat afraid of [[Nasmaerae Felmorel]].{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|727-730|19}}

==Description==
He was hawk-nosed and had sharp features. He favored high-collared robes of unadorned black.

==Possessions==
He wore some [[ring]]s that could be made to flicker. While by 761 he claimed to own no kingdoms, he had gained noticeable lands and a tower by 767 DR, which he sold in that year.

==History==
Thessamel Arunder had been a guest at one of the banquets of [[Esbre Felmorel]] in the spring of the {{yearlinkName|761}}, together with Barundryn Harbright and a wandering stranger, [[Elminster Aumar|Wanlorn]]. Before the dinner, Lord Esbre introduced him as being versed in matters magical and widely traveled. Beyond throwing a few barbs at Wanlorn, he also mentioned owning no kingdoms during the dinner, and choked up at the mention of the Lady of Shadows, whose name he did not know to be [[Dasumia]]; he refused to add anything about her.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|563|3}}

About a [[tenday]] prior to the chaos of [[the Art]] in {{yearlinkName|767}}, Thessamel Arunder refused violently an offer for lands and a tower he'd acquired, the [[South Spire]], and turned the merchants who made that offer into [[pig]]s for emphasis; at least one of the merchants was [[Hulder Phelbellow]]. A month later, while in the midst of bedroom antics, he signed a contract on his apprentice's belly, which made the same offer. She explained she'd tricked him in that way because of the duress placed by the chaos of the Art, as two men had come to kill him in order to settle scores in the last tenday alone. Thessamel then learned Barundryn Harbright was his new landlord and the backer for their offer.
