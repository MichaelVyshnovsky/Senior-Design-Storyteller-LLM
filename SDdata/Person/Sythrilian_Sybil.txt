The Sythrilian Sybil was a Chultan human psion seer and uncarnate dwelling in Thindol in the mid-1370s DR.
The Sybil dwelled in a cave system within the Hills of Sythrilia in Thindol.
She was an extraordinarily powerful psychic, known far and wide as a prophetess of great wisdom and skill. She was also regarded as a foremost expert in all aspects of psionics. People journeyed from across Faer√ªn to consult the Sybil or seek her guidance. Some were turned away without ever meeting her, but kept returning in the hopes of winning an audience with the reclusive psychic.
