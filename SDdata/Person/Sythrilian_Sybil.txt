The '''Sythrilian Sybil''' was a [[Chultan]] [[human]] [[psion]] seer and [[psion uncarnate|uncarnate]] dwelling in [[Thindol]] in the mid-1370s [[DR]].

==Home==
The Sybil dwelled in a cave system within the [[Hills of Sythrilia]] in Thindol.

==Reputation==
She was an extraordinarily powerful psychic, known far and wide as a prophetess of great wisdom and skill. She was also regarded as a foremost expert in all aspects of [[psionics]]. People journeyed from across [[Faer√ªn]] to consult the Sybil or seek her guidance. Some were turned away without ever meeting her, but kept returning in the hopes of winning an audience with the reclusive psychic.
