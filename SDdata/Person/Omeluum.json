        "mainbody": "meluum was an illithid born with arcane powers that managed to escape the Grand Design of its designated elder brain. It managed to find a life of independence unlike so many other illithids, and became a member of the Society of Brilliance during its travels throughout the Underdark.\nDespite its disagreeable experiences within an illithid colony, Omeluum had an appreciation for the lore and history of its people. Omeluum had a curious mind along with a drive to make the world a better place for others beyond itself.\nFitting for a resident of the Underdark, Omeluum was a skilled alchemist. Using a tongue of madness fungus and timmask spores, Omeluum could brew a moderately-poisonous potion that could bypass the effects of magical stasis.\nOmeluum owned a ring of psionic protection, an item that offered protection from the psychic lure of elder brains within the Underdark.\nOmeluum was an associate of Lenore De Hurst, a Mystran cleric and scholar that dwelled within the Arcane Tower. It was friends with the orog (or possibly hobgoblin) Blurg who expressed concern for Omeluums safety when it disappeared during its research.\nUnlike nearly all other illithids, Omeluum was born with sorcerous powers, granting it natural defenses against the psionic control the elder brain exerted over its colony. Omeluum resisted the elder brains control and fled the colony before its disappearance could be found out.\nFor some time Omeluum traveled with a lich, bringing the undead spellcaster souls in exchange for brains to feed upon. Eventually their paths in life parted and it eventually founded and joined the Society of Brilliance having done so alongside Blurg, Grazilaxx, Sloopidoop, Y, and Skriss.\nAs of the , Omeluum was studying alongside Blurg, a fellow scholar of the Society of Brilliance at the Ebonlake Grotto. It sought an alternative food source to brains for its people though its research was progressing slowly. They spoke with several adventurers that bore a strange artifact who had been afflicted by tadpoles. It was shocked to find that their tadpoles had been altered. Omeluum offered a number of different types of aid to the adventurers, though to no avail. Omeluum remarked to Blurg astoundment at the idea that their species could possibly be evolving.\nOmeluum later departed with Blurg back to Baldurs Gate. Incensed by their encounter with the adventurers, Omeluum began deeper research and eventually caught the attention of the Cult of the Absolute. Detained by Enver Gortash Omeluum was brought as a prisoner to the Iron Throne headquarters, an underwater prison. Omeluum was one of several that would later be potentially freed by the same adventurers that had set it on the course to begin with even though Omeluum encouraged saving others before itself. After this, if Omeluum survived, it thanked the adventurers and returned to the Society. Alternatively, Omeluum may had been murdered by Ptaris, a githyanki magically-raised from an egg acquitted by Lady Esther."
