Daudon yn Saibh el Yakan was the Nirdey of Memnon for the Rundeen in 1370 DR.
Daudon worked for many years as a bandit, bodyguard, and enforcer for the Rundeen until his age made it difficult to do these jobs, so he asked for a more sedentary job and was appointed as Nirdey of Memnon. Using his past acquaintances, he now used his talent to recruit men to protect Rundeen caravans and to assault non-Rundeen targets. Daudon also hired adventurers for some missions.
