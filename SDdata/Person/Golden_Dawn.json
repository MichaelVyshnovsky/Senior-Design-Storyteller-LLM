        "Possessions": "Goldie was fitted with a [[Calimshite]] [[saddle]] that had a high [[Wiktionary:cantle|cantle]].\n\nUnbeknownst to her caretakers, Goldie owned a set of loaded [[dice]].",
        "Activities": "For entertainment, Goldie enjoyed playing dice with her grooms in the palace of [[Faerntarn]].",

        "History": "In the spring of the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, Golden Dawn accompanied then-Countess and [[adventuress]] Zaranda Star on a journey from [[Thay]] to [[Zazesspur]] to sell loot.\n\nBesides serving as Zaranda's mount in combat, Goldie once assisted her mistress in taking [[Castle Lutwill]] by pretending to be '''Zizzy, the Wonder Horse''', companion of [[Fyadros]], the Incomparably Wonderful Bard, so that [[Star Protective Services]] could be snuck into the castle at night.\n\nGoldie remained Zaranda's riding mare after the latter was made queen."
