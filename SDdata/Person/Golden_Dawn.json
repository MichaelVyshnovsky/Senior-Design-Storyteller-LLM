        "mainbody": "olden Dawn was the talking horse of Queen Zaranda Rhindaun of Tethyr in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nPhysically, \"Goldie\" was a standard medium-sized war horse. However, unlike a normal horse, Goldie was intelligent and could speak. While certainly magical, she was not a familiar, and it is not known how she came to use and understand language.\nGoldie had a golden coat with a long white mane. Her ears were long and shapely for a mare,\nGoldie was a snarky, stubborn individual who was not afraid to speak her mind.\nBesides her supernatural gift of speech, Golden Dawn was intelligent and fought strategically, giving warnings to her rider. Her large, triangular ears gave her the ability to hear crowds from at least a half mile (0.8 kilometers) away.\nGoldie was fitted with a Calimshite saddle that had a high cantle.\nUnbeknownst to her caretakers, Goldie owned a set of loaded dice.\nFor entertainment, Goldie enjoyed playing dice with her grooms in the palace of Faerntarn.\nZaranda considered Goldie a true friend, Usually, Zaranda admired Golden Dawns council.\nGoldie preferred to mate with stallions who were normal horses, unable to talk.\nIn the spring of the , Golden Dawn accompanied then-Countess and adventuress Zaranda Star on a journey from Thay to Zazesspur to sell loot.\nBesides serving as Zarandas mount in combat, Goldie once assisted her mistress in taking Castle Lutwill by pretending to be Zizzy, the Wonder Horse, companion of Fyadros, the Incomparably Wonderful Bard, so that Star Protective Services could be snuck into the castle at night.\nGoldie remained Zarandas riding mare after the latter was made queen."
