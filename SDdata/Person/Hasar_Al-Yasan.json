His hair was tied into a ponytail at the back of his head, leaving the rest of his scalp bald. He had yellow eyes and cultivated a thin mustache and soul patch. Hasar wore several pieces of jewelry, including bicep bracelets and earrings, and he also wore spiked bracers covering his wrists and lower arms.\nSlightly more intelligent than the norm, Hasar preferred to attack from afar using magical whirlwinds. Only when opponents drew close would he step into the fray.\nHasar pledged to defend the city of Suj against intruders, and he felt bound to that pledge even after the settlement fell to plague around the 1260s DR. A century later he still kept his vigil, keeping curious individuals like Abu bin Sujah from entering Suj."
