        "Description": "Hasar was a muscular individual with desert-yellow skin. His hair was tied into a ponytail at the back of his head, leaving the rest of his scalp bald. He had yellow eyes and cultivated a thin mustache and soul patch. Hasar wore several pieces of jewelry, including bicep bracelets and earrings, and he also wore spiked bracers covering his wrists and lower arms.",
        "Abilities": "Slightly more intelligent than the norm, Hasar preferred to attack from afar using magical whirlwinds. Only when opponents drew close would he step into the fray.",
        "History": "Hasar pledged to defend the city of Suj against intruders, and he felt bound to that pledge even after the settlement fell to plague around the 1260s DR. A century later he still kept his vigil, keeping curious individuals like [[Abu bin Sujah]]{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|750}} from entering Suj."
