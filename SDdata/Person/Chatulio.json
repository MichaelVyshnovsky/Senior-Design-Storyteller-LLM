        "mainbody": "'''Chatulio''' was a [[copper dragon]] who helped [[Dorn Graybrook]] during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]].",
        "History": "In 1373 DR, when the [[gold dragon]] king [[Lareth]] ordered all [[metallic dragon]]s to hide in order to avoid the Rage, Chatulio was among those who disagreed, instead believing in searching for a cure. He joined his friend, the [[song dragon]] [[Karasendrieth]], in investigating [[Northkeep]] on the trail of [[Sammaster]].\n\nChatulio later helped defend the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]] against an attack by [[chromatic dragon]]s allied with the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. Afterward, he and Kara began to search through the monastery's extensive archives for lore about the ''[[Dracorage mythal]]''.\n\nChatulio eventually left the monastery, sensing he would soon succumb to the Rage. Using his powerful [[illusion]] magic to disguise himself as a black dragon, Chatulio infiltrated the chromatic dragons besieging the monastery and instigated a fight between their leader - the [[red dragon]] [[Malazan]] - and the [[green dragon]] [[Ishenalyr]], who was one of the draconic mystics known as the [[hidecarved]]. After Malazan killed the green, Chatulio succumbed to the urges of the Rage and began laughing uncontrollably, exposing himself to the assembled dragons, who immediately killed and devoured him."
