        "mainbody": "Lord '''Laerm Ryence''' was a commander of the [[Swift Cavalry]] of [[Evermeet]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He played a tragic role in the [[Return of the Archwizards (event)|series of events]] that saw the return of the [[phaerimm]] and the [[shade]]s of [[Thultanthar]] return to [[Faerûn]], his pride causing the deaths of many valiant [[elven]] warriors and [[mage]]s.\n{{Quote|I am not surprised to hear such talk from a human. The phaerimm are not threatening one of your cities.|Laerm, to [[Khelben Arunsun]].}}",
        "Description": "He had distinct silver eyes and did not hide his emotions from his facial expressions.",
        "Personality": "The elven commander was a condescending and irritable individual, especially to [[human]]s. He was ill-suited for mounted combat on the mainland of [[Faerûn]], being uncomfortable atop the great [[warhorse]]s bred by non-elves.",
        "Relationships": "He had a trusted aid in [[Bladuid]], a [[gold elf]] that shared his disdain of humans.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Lord Ryence led the Swift Cavalry as part of Evermeet's expeditionary company in defense of [[Evereska]], the last elven city on the mainland of Faerûn, as it came under threat from the recently released phaerimm. In a single day he managed to draw the ire of the [[archmage]] [[Khelben Arunsun]], where the [[Serpent's Tail]] joined with the [[Winding Water]] river. Many elves were killed by Ryence's poor decisions on the battlefield, and the survivors had to be rescued by Khelben himself, wielding his ''[[silver fire]]'' against the wretched phaerimm army."
