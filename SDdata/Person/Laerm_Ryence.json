        "mainbody": "Lord Laerm Ryence was a commander of the Swift Cavalry of Evermeet during the 14 century DR. He played a tragic role in the series of events that saw the return of the phaerimm and the shades of Thultanthar return to Faerûn, his pride causing the deaths of many valiant elven warriors and mages.\nHe had distinct silver eyes and did not hide his emotions from his facial expressions.\nThe elven commander was a condescending and irritable individual, especially to humans. He was ill-suited for mounted combat on the mainland of Faerûn, being uncomfortable atop the great warhorses bred by non-elves.\nHe had a trusted aid in Bladuid, a gold elf that shared his disdain of humans.\nIn the , Lord Ryence led the Swift Cavalry as part of Evermeets expeditionary company in defense of Evereska, the last elven city on the mainland of Faerûn, as it came under threat from the recently released phaerimm. In a single day he managed to draw the ire of the archmage Khelben Arunsun, where the Serpents Tail joined with the Winding Water river. Many elves were killed by Ryences poor decisions on the battlefield, and the survivors had to be rescued by Khelben himself, wielding his silver fire against the wretched phaerimm army."
