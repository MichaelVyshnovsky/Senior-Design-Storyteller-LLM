Valargrim Hond a mage of the late 15 century DR and the Magister of 1490 DR to 1496 DR.
Valargrim Hond was sardonic.
The man was spike-bearded.
He was a hardened duelist.
Besides a broad selection of rings and wands, Valargrim notably wielded three enchanted flying daggers of his own devising, capable of attacking on their own, and channeling his own spells. The daggers had a sapience of their own.
Before becoming the Magister, Valargrim Hond was a mercenary mage who had extensive fighting experience in the Vilhon Reach and Chessenta. In the , after conferring with Mystra, Azuth offered the office of Magister to Valargrim Hond upon the retirement of Tannathra.
He defended his office through numerous duels until the , when he was slain in the Eyes of the Beholder club in Ormpetarr, by six Red Wizards sent by Szass Tam. But his slayer never attained the powers of the office, as they were soon after killed by Handrar Rezgult, a Zhentarim mage who was staying in the city. And before he was able to attain the powers of the office, Valargrim Honds enchanted daggers struck him down, and then escaped. Thus, Azuth offered the role of Magister to Ramarthant Horaerays.
