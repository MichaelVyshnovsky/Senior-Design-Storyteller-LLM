'''Alex''' was a child of [[Highcliff]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Alex's father, [[Zachan]], told Alex about the story that thounsands of [[duergar]] fought a battle. This caused Alex and his brother, [[Andrew]], to gain confidence and go adventuring. However, they ended up near [[Highcliff Castle]], where they got cornered by a bunch of wolves. Gera and Zachan asked the [[Kalach-Cha]] to rescue their sons. Upon rescuing them, the Kalach-Cha could tell the truth there were twice as many duergar, or lie that there was no battle.
