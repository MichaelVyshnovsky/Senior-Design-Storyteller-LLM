Alex was a child of Highcliff on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR.
Alexs father, Zachan, told Alex about the story that thounsands of duergar fought a battle. This caused Alex and his brother, Andrew, to gain confidence and go adventuring. However, they ended up near Highcliff Castle, where they got cornered by a bunch of wolves. Gera and Zachan asked the Kalach-Cha to rescue their sons. Upon rescuing them, the Kalach-Cha could tell the truth there were twice as many duergar, or lie that there was no battle.
