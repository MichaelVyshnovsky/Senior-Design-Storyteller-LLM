        "History": "In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Portia and her party were hired by Lady [[Wylynd Moonstar]] of [[Waterdeep]] to find [[Umbraxakar]] the [[shadow dragon]] and transform him back into Glyster. However, she and her companions were captured by the [[Dark Army of the Night]] and Portia was enthralled by [[Keresta Delvingstone]]. Afterward Keresta used her as human shield and source of food for her [[vampire spawn]]s.",
        "Personality": "Portia started to suffer the despair of the [[Shadowfell]], believing she'd been imprisoned inside [[Vanrakdoom]] for a very long time. She thought that to redeem Umraxakar it was necessary to rid the dragon of despair but had no idea how.",
        "Relationship": "Under her [[charm]] spell, Portia believed Keresta to be a trusted friend."
