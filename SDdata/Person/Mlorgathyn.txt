'''Mlorgathyn of Selgaunt''' was a merchant around [[1487 DR]].

==History==
Mlorgathyn was a dealer in fine [[wine]]s, scents, and sauces based in [[Selgaunt]]. However his business was an obstacle to both Lord [[Sardasper Halaunt]] and [[Manshoon]], so they collaborated on swindling Mlorgathyn and all his family.
