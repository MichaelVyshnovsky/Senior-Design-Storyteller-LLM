Amaranthraxine was an amethyst dragon from Abeir that dwelled within the city of Xorvintroth. While she was once a whole entity, she existed for over a century as a spiritual echo that was stripped from a body taken over by an otherworldly entity.
In her spirit-form, Amaranthraxine could only manifest as environmental changes that appeared throughout Xorvintroth. If someone ventured into Xorvintroth, she could for example illuminate passageways in the direction she wished them to travel.
Amaranthraxines body unfortunately was taken host by the illithid elder brain Ursegol and transformed into an elder brain dragon.
Like so many other gem dragons, Amaranthraxine loved collecting and amassing treasure for her hoard.
Her personality was dramatically altered when her spirit was split from her body. Her consciousness was tormented by twisted Far Realm energies and telepathic communication became nearly impossible. At that point in her existence she wished only to find peace and rest in the afterlife.
Amaranthraxine owned a vast hoard of riches that comprised over 50,000 gp worth of Abeiran currency and amethyst gems, including one ascendant gem dragon-touched focus.
She had one known friend, a flumph by the name of Murbur.
While traveling across Abeir with her friend Murbur, Amaranthraxine came across the abandoned city of Xorvintroth and discovered the inter-planar portals to the Far Realm within. They relocated themselves to the city to ensure no malevolent forced passed through to their world.
When the Spellplague struck the Realms in the , Xorvintroth along with several other cities shifted from the world of Abeir to its sister planet Toril. During the world-changing event, Amaranthraxines spirit was infused into the walls of Xorvintroth, while her physical form eventually reappeared within the city at its new resting place.
