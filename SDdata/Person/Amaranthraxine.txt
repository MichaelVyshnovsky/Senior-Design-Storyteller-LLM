'''Amaranthraxine''' was an [[amethyst dragon]] from [[Abeir]] that dwelled within the city of [[Xorvintroth]]. While she was once a whole entity, she existed for over a century as a [[spirit|spiritual echo]] that was stripped from a [[elder brain dragon|body]] taken over by an [[Ursegol|otherworldly entity]].{{Cite adventurers league/Fall the Cold Night|13,21}}

==Description==
In her spirit-form, Amaranthraxine could only manifest as environmental changes that appeared throughout Xorvintroth. If someone ventured into Xorvintroth, she could for example illuminate passageways in the direction she wished them to travel.

Amaranthraxine's body unfortunately was taken host by the [[illithid]] [[elder brain]] [[Ursegol]] and transformed into an [[elder brain dragon]].{{Cite adventurers league/Fall the Cold Night|18-19}}

==Personality==
Like so many other [[gem dragon]]s, Amaranthraxine loved collecting and amassing treasure for her hoard.

Her personality was dramatically altered when her spirit was split from her body. Her consciousness was tormented by twisted [[Far Realm]] energies and ''[[telepathy|telepathic communication]]'' became nearly impossible. At that point in her existence she wished only to find peace and rest in the [[afterlife]].

==Possessions==
Amaranthraxine owned a vast hoard of riches that comprised over 50,000 [[gp]] worth of [[Abeir]]an [[currency]] and [[amethyst]] gems, including one ''[[ascendant gem dragon-touched focus]]''.

==Relationships==
She had one known friend, a [[flumph]] by the name of [[Murbur]].

==History==
While traveling across Abeir with her friend Murbur, Amaranthraxine came across the abandoned city of Xorvintroth and discovered the inter-planar ''[[portal]]s'' to the [[Far Realm]] within. They relocated themselves to the city to ensure no malevolent forced passed through to their world.

When the [[Spellplague]] struck the Realms in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, Xorvintroth along with several other cities shifted from the world of Abeir to its sister planet [[Toril]]. During the world-changing event, Amaranthraxine's [[spirit]] was infused into the walls of Xorvintroth, while her physical form eventually reappeared within the city at its new resting place.
