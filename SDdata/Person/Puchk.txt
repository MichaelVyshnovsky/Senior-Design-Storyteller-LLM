Old Puchk was a priest of Gruumsh within the Tornskulls tribe of orcs that dwelled within the Dead Orc Pass during the 14 century DR.
The priest was prone to frenzied bouts of rage.
Puchk watched over the Fang of Skulls and the nearby altar to Gruumsh, within Dead Orc Pass and ensured the other orcs were dutiful in their service to their god.
Old Puchk was a fervent supported of his claw-leader, Vaug the Strong. He was supported in his duties by a few younger Gruumshar priests.
