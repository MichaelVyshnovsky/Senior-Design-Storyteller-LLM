        "mainbody": "'''Ruk''' was the progenitor of the [[hill giant]] race.",
        "Description": "As chief of the hill giant kingdom of [[Ostoria]], Ruk wore a golden crown and bejeweled rings. His weapon was an ebony club.",
        "Relationships": "Ruk was one of [[Annam All-Father]]'s many terrestrial sons through his wife [[Othea]]. His brothers were [[Lanaxis]], [[Vilmos]], [[Nicias]], [[Masud]], [[Ottar]], [[Obadai]], [[Arno and Julian]], He also had four terrestrial half-brothers through his mother, including [[Dunmore]], the father of the [[voadkyn]]. He had many divine half-siblings through his father, including [[Stronmaus]], [[Hiatea]], [[Grolantor]], [[Iallanis]], [[Memnor]], [[Skoraeus]], and most likely [[Surtr]] and [[Thrym]] as well.\n\nRuk had at least one son, who was named [[Morg_(son of Ruk)|Morg]].",
        "History": "Like his other non-divine brothers, Ruk was born sometime around {{Yearlink|-30000}}. When all of the siblings were old enough, Annam granted each of them an inheritance in the great giant empire of Ostoria. and his seed became the hill giants of later millennia. \n\nThousands of years later, Annam discovered that Othea, Ruk's mother, had not been faithful, having had an affair with [[Ulutiu]]. After Ulutiu's amulet caused the [[Great Glacier]] and the [[Endless Ice Sea]] to form, Ruk and his brothers soon discovered a way to halt the amulet's magic; however, they were forbidden from doing so by their mother. Lanaxis, Ruk's eldest brother and the leader of all of them, summoned them together for a meeting in [[Voninheim]]. but he accidentally poisoned not only Othea but also Ruk and all of his other brothers except Arno and Julian and Dunmore.\n\nRuk was buried in a drumlin outside of Voninheim. There his body lay with those of his murdered brothers for about 3000 years until [[1369 DR]], when the [[firbolg]] [[Tavis Burdun]] unveiled the [[Twilight Vale]] and challenged Lanaxis. Lanaxis used powerful magic to reanimate Ruk's corpse as a [[zombie]], and he did the same with all of the other brothers. The [[undead]] giant kings attacked Tavis with the full fury of their magics, but Tavis and his companions were protected by Annam's axe ''[[Sky Cleaver]]''. Tavis then used the magic of ''Sky Cleaver'' to reveal to them, even in their undeath, that Lanaxis, their older brother, had betrayed them. Ruk and the other dead giants turned and charged at Lanaxis instead. Lanaxis created a magic shield to protect the portico from their onslaught. Nicias, the [[cloud giant]], was able to shatter the shield with his morning star, but then Lanaxis killed each of them a second time with his sword. Ruk was the second to be slain. Lanaxis cut his body completely in half and sent it crashing through one of the walls of Voninheim."
