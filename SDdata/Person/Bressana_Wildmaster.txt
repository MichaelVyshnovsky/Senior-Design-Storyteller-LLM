'''Bressana Wildmaster''' was an [[elf]] of [[New Sharandar]] who lived in the [[fey]] settlement during the late 15{{th}} century of the [[Calendar of Harptos|Faerûnian calendar]].
{{Quote|Those redcaps are nasty creatures, so willing to hurt the things we love.|Bressana, to the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]].}}

==Activities==
She worked under the leadership of [[Pelendethas Everstride]], serving at a camp on the edge of the Sharandan territory near its border with the [[Realm of Malabog]].

==History==
When [[Malabog]] the [[fomorian]] king threatened New Sharandar ''circa'' the  {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Bressana and her allies took swift action against the [[dark fey]] minions of his domain. When Malabog's [[redcap]]s attempted to induce a feral state in the region's [[portal hound]]s, Bressana led the efforts to regain the trust of the fey canines. She also worked with some adventurers from [[Neverwinter]] to heal [[dryad]] trees that had also been harmed by the malevolent redcaps.
