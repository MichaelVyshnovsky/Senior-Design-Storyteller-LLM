'''Jalaerho Kloskurmrundur''' was the Guildmaster Emeritus of the [[Stationers' Guild]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1378}}, Jalaerho had been the Guildmaster Emeritus for over ten years. He wrote down his musings and experiences in a [[book]] published in 1378 DR. His work was dramatically named ''[[A Seat That Draws Blood: Ten Years a Guildmaster]]'' and Jalaerhoe proclaimed his unfavorable attitude towards change and rebellious youth while stressing the importance of business and [[coin]] it brought.
