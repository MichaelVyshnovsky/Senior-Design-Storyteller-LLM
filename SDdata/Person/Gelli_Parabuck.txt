Gelli Parabuck was a priestess of Tymora who lived in Scardale Town in the mid-14 century DR.
She presided over the only temple of Scardale Town that survived the Second inter-dale war, called the Lap of Luck. Gelli had a cheerful disposition and was quite popular among the townsfolk of Scardale, despite their feelings of abandonment regarding the deity of luck.
