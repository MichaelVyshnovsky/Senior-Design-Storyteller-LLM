'''Gelli Parabuck''' was a priestess of [[Tymora]] who lived in [[Scardale Town]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
She presided over the only temple of Scardale Town that survived the [[Second inter-dale war]], called the [[Lap of Luck]]. Gelli had a cheerful disposition and was quite popular among the townsfolk of [[Scardale]], despite their feelings of abandonment regarding the deity of luck.
