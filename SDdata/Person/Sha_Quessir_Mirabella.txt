ShaQuessir Mirabella was rumored to be a human warrior offered acceptance into the elven knights of Myth Drannor.
If the rumors were true, Mirabella would have worn elven plate, fought with a longsword, and rode a moon-horse like all other knights.
Centuries ago, ShaQuessir was a human knight at Myth Drannor in the Elven Court.
Gold elves of Evermeet disputed this claim since all elven knights were pure-breed elves.
