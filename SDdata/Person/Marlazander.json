        "mainbody": "'''Marlazander''' was the bodyguard of [[Rothglar Illance]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Marlazander was an immense, musclebound man, whose face reflected cold menace. He was also tall.",
        "Personality": "He could get somewhat touchy-feely with associates, gloated needlessly, and was a little quick to run away.",
        "Activities": "He was the bodyguard of [[Rothglar Illance]].",
        "History": "Marlazander accompanied his master, Rothglar Illance, to the [[Open Feast]] of {{yearlink|1479}} on [[Mirtul 26]]. He was also spotted later with [[Verrin]], one of rival nobleman's [[Marlin Stormserpent]]'s men, during the latter's attempt to steal the ''[[Wyverntongue Chalice]]'' from [[Castle Obarskyr]] in [[Suzail]]. Before he could do anything to Marlin, the latter unleashed his trained [[stirge]], [[Thirsty]], which slew Verrin immediately; Marlazander tried to flee, but was cut down by the [[undead]] knight [[Targrael]] before he got very far."
