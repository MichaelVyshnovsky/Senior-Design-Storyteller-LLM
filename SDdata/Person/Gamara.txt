Gamara the Great was a Sembite human wizard and adventurer in the Stag Runners company in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Gamara was an arrogant and domineering woman, who had an inflated sense of her own ability and importance.
Gamara was a veteran mage and prepared an array of versatile spells for her purposes. They tended towards direct combat application.
Gamara wore a headband of protection and a ring of wizardry, and carried a magical staff and a wand of fire.
In the , Gamara and her allies attended a party at Thistleflame Keep hosted by Lord Partic Thistle, only to be horribly upset by a ballad performed by Mendryll Belarod that made Sembites into an object of mockery. She and the rest of the Stag Runners later ambushed Mendryll to exact "justice" on him, but were defeated by him and other adventurers.
