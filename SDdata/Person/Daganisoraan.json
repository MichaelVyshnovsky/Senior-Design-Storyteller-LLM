        "mainbody": "aganisoraan was a legendary ancient sahuagin baron of gigantic size and age.\nAfter living for at least two thousand years, he grew to a height of at least .\nDaganisoraan spent most years hibernating in an unknown location, for as long as a decade or so at a time. When active, he went on aquatic hunts, typically preying on krakens, whales, and sharkweres. This would go on for a month, after which time he would return to hibernation.\nThough content to lay dormant in his decade-long hibernation, it was believed that if ever Anguileusis, the long-dormant god of the anguillians were to return to life, then Daganisoraan would aid the sahuagins and Sekolah in the inevitable war between the two races.\nDaganisoraan was once the king of an unknown sahuagin realm, who exiled himself after centuries of boring rule.\nDaganisoraans long life, coupled with the centuries of self-isolation, made him a mythic figure to the sahuagin, who considered his earlier life as a king merely a distinct entity, unrelated to him save for a coincidental name. Regardless, the tales told of this creature were quite polarizing, with some casting him in a heroic light and others as a villain. The core element to all these tales was the fact he played the role of \"bogeyman\", sent to bring doom to the foolish and unwary."
