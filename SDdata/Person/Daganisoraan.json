        "mainbody": "'''Daganisoraan''' was a legendary ancient [[sahuagin]] baron of gigantic size and age.",
        "Description": "After living for at least two thousand years, he grew to a height of at least {{SI|30.5|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Activities": "Daganisoraan spent most years hibernating in an unknown location, for as long as a decade or so at a time. When active, he went on aquatic hunts, typically preying on [[kraken]]s, [[whale]]s, and [[sharkwere]]s. This would go on for a month, after which time he would return to hibernation.",
        "Relationships": "Though content to lay dormant in his decade-long hibernation, it was believed that if ever [[Anguileusis]], the long-dormant god of the [[anguillian]]s were to return to life, then Daganisoraan would aid the sahuagins and [[Sekolah]] in the inevitable war between the two races.<ref>",
        "History": "Daganisoraan was once the king of an unknown sahuagin realm, who exiled himself after centuries of boring rule.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Daganisoraan's long life, coupled with the centuries of self-isolation, made him a mythic figure<ref> to the sahuagin, who considered his earlier life as a king merely a distinct entity, unrelated to him save for a coincidental name. Regardless, the tales told of this creature were quite polarizing, with some casting him in a heroic light<ref> and others as a villain.<ref> The core element to all these tales was the fact he played the role of \"bogeyman\", sent to bring doom to the foolish and unwary."
