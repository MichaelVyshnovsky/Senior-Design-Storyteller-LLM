'''Tak''' was a female [[doppelganger]] in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/No Foolish Matter|12}}

==Activities==
Posing as Doctor Jubal, she managed the wandering [[Doctor Jubal's Carnival of Curiosities]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Tak—posing as a [[half-elf]]—was hired by Doctor [[Jubal]] with the promise of helping her against the [[Great Law of Humanity]] of [[Hillsfar]]. However, she found that Jubal did not truly care about it. Meanwhile, whispers in her dreams told Tak to replace all [[human]]s with crazed mirror duplicates. So Tak decided to act, subduing Jubal and taking his position.

Afterward, she began kidnapping people and replacing them with mirror duplicates created by the carnival's mirror maze while the originals remained chained inside the maze and had their souls slowly consumed by the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]]. The duplicates spread madness like an infection while the originals, without their souls, became mutated beings, totally loyal to Tak.

However, at the village of [[Hillpicket]], Tak was unveiled and killed by some adventurers.{{Cite adventurers league/No Foolish Matter|15-16}}

==Personality==
Tak truly hated Hillsfar's politics. She wanted to show everyone that nonhumans were not the monsters that the First Lord had made them out to be.
