        "mainbody": "Glorantha Steelrain was a talented bladesinger, active in the 14 century DR.\nBy her 133 birthday, Glorantha was a well-respected elven bladesinger, master of the longsword, and a one-woman army. She bore a tattoo of a great cat that signified her formidable battle prowess and complimented her cat-like grace. Glorantha made her name traveling along the Sword Coast, working to benefit her elven kin. However, few believed her deeds as the woman was prone to exaggeration, and because she traveled alone, her heroics rarely had any witnesses.\nSometime in the 14 century DR, Glorantha Steelrain was among adventurers interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths."
