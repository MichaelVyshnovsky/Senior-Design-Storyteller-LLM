        "mainbody": "Vynnia was a young dark one who was a member of the Glumguts family of dark creepers in the Shadowfell city of Evernight as of the late 15 century DR.\nVynnia was a cousin of Blackclaw, the terrifying and merciless leader of the Glumguts.\nVynnia, another cousin named Thrax, and Blackclaws son, Blackcut, weâ€™re the only members of the Glumguts who dared to cross Blackclaw. They played pranks across Evernight, embarked on sly ventures, sought excitement by harassing people who did not seem to be native to the Shadowfell, and merrily committed acts that embarrassed and hindered the aspirations of the Glumguts employers, Netheril. This in turn meant that if the the three youngsters involvement in these events were discovered, it could ruin the whole family. Before that, they ran the risk of invoking Blackclaws wrath, although they believed they would be fine because Blackcut was his son."
