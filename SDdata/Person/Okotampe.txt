'''Okotampe''' was a [[korobokuru]] [[wu jen]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Okotampe was a shaman among his tribe but left his home to found a new totem for the tribe. He met [[Onoye]] and understood her [[spirit]] nature, deciding that she was sent to him by the gods to help in his quest, so he decided to travel with her. Later, Okotampe and Onoye joined [[Doin Sanehiro]]'s group in fighting against [[Jinchin]].

They remained with Doin at the village of [[Tomobiki]] after the end of the adventure.

In late 1358 he went into a solitary trip to find a new totem in the [[Fochu Peninsula]] of [[Wa]] but the thief of his [[helm of teleportation]] by some [[Blue Kumi Bandits]] prevented Okotampe to went back to home. 

==Personality==
Okotampe didn't really need anyhing from others, living cheaply. He never bathed, wore filthy rags, spat, cursed, yelled, and was always rude. He considered [[human]]s just barbarian invaders, and his people to be more ancient and wise.
