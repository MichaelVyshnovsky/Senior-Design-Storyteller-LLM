Jierta was a female frost giant warrior in the late 15th century DR.
Jierta was one of the warriors in Jarl Greigor Kundknoddicks tribe, who allied with drow and orcs during the Darkening.
In 1485 DR, during the late stages of the War of the Silver Marches, Jierta reported to Greigor that an army from Silverymoon had defeated their orc allies. Soon after, Gregor was approached by Jarlaxle, who suggested he withdraw his troops in the wake of the imminent defeat of Many-Arrows.
