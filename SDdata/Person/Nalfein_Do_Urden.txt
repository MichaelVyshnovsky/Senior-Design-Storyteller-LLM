'''Nalfein Do'Urden''' was the elderboy and house wizard of [[House Do'Urden]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] until his death.

==History==
Nalfein studied wizardry at [[Sorcere]], the [[drow]] academy for [[wizards]] in Menzoberranzan.

In [[1297 DR]], Nalfein participated in House Do'Urden's attack on [[House DeVir]]. During the battle, [[Dinin Do'Urden]], the secondboy of House Do'Urden, distracted Nalfein and put a sword in his back. [[Maya Do'Urden]], melded to Nalfein, sensed his death and announced it, thus sparing newborn [[Drizzt Do'Urden|Drizzt]]'s life from being sacrificed to [[Lolth]] as the third living son.

==Relationships==
Nalfein was the elder brother of Dinin and Drizzt Do'Urden.  Nalfein was the long-time enemy of [[Ozomar Do'Urden]] (formerly of [[House Druu'giir]]), who defected from his house and became the house wizard of House Do'Urden after Nalfein's death.
