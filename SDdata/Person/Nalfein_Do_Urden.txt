Nalfein DoUrden was the elderboy and house wizard of House DoUrden of Menzoberranzan until his death.
Nalfein studied wizardry at Sorcere, the drow academy for wizards in Menzoberranzan.
In 1297 DR, Nalfein participated in House DoUrdens attack on House DeVir. During the battle, Dinin DoUrden, the secondboy of House DoUrden, distracted Nalfein and put a sword in his back. Maya DoUrden, melded to Nalfein, sensed his death and announced it, thus sparing newborn Drizzts life from being sacrificed to Lolth as the third living son.
Nalfein was the elder brother of Dinin and Drizzt DoUrden.  Nalfein was the long-time enemy of Ozomar DoUrden (formerly of House Druugiir), who defected from his house and became the house wizard of House DoUrden after Nalfeins death.
