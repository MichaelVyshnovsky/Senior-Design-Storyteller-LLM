        "mainbody": "'''Aizel Treemaine''' was an [[elf]] wizard in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1479 DR]].",
        "History": "In 1479 DR, Aizel was hired by the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Varriel]] to explore on her behalf a [[necromancer]]'s laboratory inside [[Undermountain]]. However, she joined the doomed [[Rutherford Urmbrusk]]'s party and disappeared.\n\nJust after Rutherford entered a secret passage, Aizel was captured by the [[vampire]] [[Dayan]], who used her for one of his experiments. She was placed inside a [[helmed horror]] guardian. To power it, a person had to die inside the armor and Dayan chose Aizel as a sacrifice. She was slowly dying from starvation and only Dayan could free her from the armor without killing her.",
