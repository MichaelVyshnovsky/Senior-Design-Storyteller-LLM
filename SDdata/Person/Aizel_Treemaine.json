However, she joined the doomed Rutherford Urmbrusks party and disappeared.\nJust after Rutherford entered a secret passage, Aizel was captured by the vampire Dayan, who used her for one of his experiments. She was placed inside a helmed horror guardian. To power it, a person had to die inside the armor and Dayan chose Aizel as a sacrifice. She was slowly dying from starvation and only Dayan could free her from the armor without killing her.\nCategoryElves\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryInhabitants of Undermountain\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nfhqcesbve6ugw6b6nz87bl0ht393m2b"
