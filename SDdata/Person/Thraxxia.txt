'''Thraxxia''' was a [[Half-fiend|half-fiendish]] daughter of the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]].

==Description==
Though she had no known [[succubus]] blood, Thraxxia physically resembled an [[alu-fiend]], with an attractive, feminine human form, upsloping eyebrows and small, batlike wings. She was, however, far more powerful, having gained the might and magical powers of a [[nalfeshnee]] through trickery and guile.

==History==
Thraxxia was the daughter of Graz'zt and a long-dead [[human]] [[monk]]. After killing three of her half-sisters to prove herself to her father, she then served as Graz'zt's personal assassin.

During the imprisonment of [[Waukeen]], Graz'zt plotted to magically disguise Thraxxia as the goddess of wealth, counting on [[Lliira]] to transfer Waukeen's portfolio to Thraxxia in Waukeen's stead. This plot was thwarted by a band of adventurers in [[1370 DR]].
