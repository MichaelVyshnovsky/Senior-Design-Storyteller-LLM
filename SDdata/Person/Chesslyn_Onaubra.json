        "mainbody": "'''Chesslyn Onaubra''' was an agent of the [[Harpers]] who operated within the city of [[Mulmaster]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Chesslyn Onaubra was a tall reserved woman with long brown hair. She appeared stern and intimidating but her eyes and voice betrayed tenderness and compassionate personality.",
        "Abilities": "As per [[Elminster]], she was an accomplished swordswoman and renowned for being an expert [[longsword]]-hurler.",
        "Possessions": "Chesslyn protected her identity with an ''[[amulet of non-detection]]'' that shielded her mind from probing by the [[Cloaks]] of Mulmaster. Chesslyn's house was used as a Harper warehouse available only to those who revealed their Harper affiliation. Her home was located in the southern part of Mulmaster, and was a humble brick and wooden structure with a spade bedroom for her fellow Harpers.",
        "Activities": "Though she kept a low profile within the city, there were a few nobles who were aware of her true identity. They kept this intel secret, hoping to one day use Chesslyn to overthrow Mulmaster's [[High Blade]].",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century DR, Chesslyn worked as a temple guard at the temple of [[Tymora]], the [[Gate of Good Fortune]] on the [[East Ride]]. From there, she was keeping an eye for the Harpers on the activities of the [[Cloaks]] of Mulmaster. In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Chesslyn Onaubra aided famed [[Volothamp Geddarm]] who arrived to Mulmaster to aid an old acquaintance. During the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] crisis in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Chesslyn Onaubra advised the [[Hero of Daggerford]] to visit the notorious [[Zhent Quarter]] of Mulmaster to find information of the Archmage [[Maganus]]'s youth in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]]."
