        "mainbody": "'''Rukwurm''' was a [[goblin]] raider member of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved teleporting goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. A group of goblin sappers made it into the basement of one of the warehouses in the docks. Once inside, Rukwurm, who led the assault, used a magic [[scroll]] that transported more goblins of the Legion to Targos, along with [[Ulek the Burrower]]. Eventually, a group of adventurers from [[Luskan]] discovered the collapsed smugglers' tunnels and disposed of both goblin leaders and their troops."
