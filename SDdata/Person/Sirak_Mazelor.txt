'''Sirak Mazelor''' was a [[drow]] merchant of [[Menzoberranzan]] working for [[House Baenre]] and their representative in [[Mantol-Derith]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Sirak liked luxurious items made by the drow. She was a sophisticated individual.

==History==
During the turmoil between the [[duergar]] and [[deep gnome]]s instigated by the [[demon lord]] [[Fraz-Urb'luu]] ''circa'' [[1486 DR]], Sirak was ready to fully conquer the trading post, but only if the [[Zhentarim]] accepted the change in government.
