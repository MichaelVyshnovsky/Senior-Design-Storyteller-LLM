        "mainbody": "Endracritar was a young male green dragon from the High Forest near Loudwater that was killed in the 14 century DR by forces from Waterdeep after he entered Kryptgarden Forest.\nEndracritar was young and bold, thinking he could challenge and defeat the ancient green dragon Claugiyliamatar who laired in Kryptgarden Forest. In truth, he was growing uneasy about Zhentarim activity around Loudwater and becoming alarmed at the might of the forces residing at Hellgate Keep in the northern part of the High Forest.\nAt some point after the , but well before 1372 DR, Endracritar prepared spells and made plans to kill or drive out Old Gnawbone from her lair in Deeping Cave. He didnt realize that Claugiyliamatar had been watching him through her scrying crystal for a long time and had divined his plan. She deftly manipulated events whereby she swindled Lord Saerlin Brokengulf of the Waterdhavian nobility out of most of the familys wealth and then destroyed the Brokengulf villa in the city, crippling Lord Saerlin and killing three of his sisters&mdasha very bold attack inside the city proper. When the expected retributive strike force arrived in Kryptgarden Forest looking for a green dragon to slay, they encountered Endracritar as he sought to probe Claugiyliamatars defenses. The young dragon was no match for the might and magic of Waterdeep and he was slain while Old Gnawbone watched from the far side of the Sword Mountains."
