{{quote|''Ha! Aye, it's that damned [[knucklehead trout]] - doesn't pass easily. Ye'd think I'd be finding fish swimmin' in my stool.''|Screed}}

==Description==
Screed was a friendly man with pale skin and dark hair. He dined on knucklehead and often flamed his flatulence on the [[fish]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the ''Wicked Wench'' was among several ships that carried reinforcements and hired adventurers from the city of [[Luskan]] to [[Targos]], to aid the city's defenses against the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. Screed was woking aboard the ship at the time and befriended the group of adventurers who would later become the heroes of the [[Ten-Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].
