'''Lindin''' was an arrogant adventuring [[fighter]] from the city of [[Waterdeep]] in the midâˆ’14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Lindin was armed with an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[longsword]], and protected by a suit of [[plate mail]] and a [[medium shield]]. He carried a ''[[potion of absorption]]'' and a ''[[potion of invisibility]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Lindin's adventuring party, led by [[Kirian]] visited the area east of [[Beregost]] known as [[Mutamin's Garden]]. There, Lindin, Kirian, [[Baerin]], and [[Peter]] antagonized travelers, fellow adventurers, and "rustic locals," provoking them into combat.
