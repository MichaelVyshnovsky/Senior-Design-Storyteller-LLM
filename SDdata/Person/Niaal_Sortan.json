        "mainbody": "iaal Sortan was a sadistic priestess of Bhaal, the god of murder, who resided in the seemingly peaceful monastery that later came to be known as the Stronghold of Liams Hold.\nAn enchanted warhammer - the Black Hammer, was Niaal Sortans favorite weapon, accompanying her on countless late-night rampages of torturing innocents.\nNiaal Sortan gained her foul reputation sometime before 1358 DR, for regularly traveling the lads surrounding Liams Hold and torturing creatures with her magical acid-spewing hammer in praise of her dark deity. During one of her evil nocturnal expeditions, Niaal Sortan was ambushed by a gang of rangers and slain. However, the rangers all were splattered by deadly acid of the the Black Hammer and perished from their injuries soon after."
