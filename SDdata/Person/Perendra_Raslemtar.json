The courtship progressed slowly, because both nobles were overworked and timid.\n\nPerendra was a tutor to [[Geiron Hawkwinter]], nephew of Countess [[Kyrin Hawkwinter]].\n\nPerendra's magical [[familiar]] was an owl, but she was also friends with a [[ki-rin]] named [[Harnoster]], whom she met while in [[Silverymoon]] with Alustriel. The latter of the two often reported to her news of what was occuring across the North.",
        "History": "[[File:Perendra.jpg|250px|thumb|''Perendra Raslemtar in her official court regalia.'']]\nIn [[1347 DR]], as the young daughter of the last baron of Elemetar (it was a barony before the [[Tethyrian Interregnum|Interregnum]], From there, they traveled to [[Waterdeep]], where Perendra spent most of her childhood.\n\nWhen she was only fourteen-years-old, her parents were killed by assassins who had tracked them from Tethyr. She was taken by [[Mirt|Mirt \"the Moneylender\"]] to Alustriel who raised her into adulthood in her palace in Silverymoon. Under Alustriel's tutelage, she grew in her magical arts.\n\nA few years before [[1357 DR]], Perendra took her leave of her foster mother Alustriel, moved to [[Voonlar]], bought and built her [[Perendra's Stronghold|Stronghold]], and joined the Harpers, whom she had always respected.\n\nIn [[1368 DR]], in the month of [[Eleasis]], when [[Elminster]] sent [[Haedrak Rhindaun III|Lhaeo]] through a portal to Voonlar, the lost prince met Perendra and found his first ally in her.\n\nThe two of them traveled by magic to Silverymoon after a few [[tenday]]s, and there they planned with [[Alustriel]] and [[Khelben]] \"Blackstaff\" how Lhaeo might be made King Haedrak III and return to Tethyr. After that, the two traveled to Waterdeep to gain further support.\n\nNear the end of the war, when [[Zaranda Star]] was a prisoner in [[Shoonach]], Prince Haedrak tasked Perendra, [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Onyx the Invincible]], and [[Ondul Jarduth]] with teleporting into [[Myratma]] and freeing the slaves there in an attempt at a distraction so the prince could rescue Zaranda. They succeeded at rescuing the slaves and performed many acts of sabotage, such as fouling the water supplies and food sources of the city and weakening the walls with magic. After avoiding detection successfully, they escaped from the city by leaping from the walls into the river and swimming to join the rest of the Loyalist army.",
        "Rumors": "Her romance with Lord Zelphar Thann was a common topic of gossip, as was her appointment to the position of vizera. In the latter case, it was bothersome to many upper-class Tethyrians that Perendra was appointed instead of Duchess-Consort [[Lawantha Blackthorn]], who was higher-ranked as a duchess and a more powerful wizardess. However, Lawantha was a [[Calishite]] by birth, while Perendra was [[Tethyrian]]. Moreover, Perendra was Prince Haedrak's first ally and had saved the future king and queen's lives on multiple occasions."
