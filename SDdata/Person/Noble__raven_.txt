'''Noble''' was a [[raven]] who lived in [[Marigold's Menagerie]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They inhabited one of the few floor-to-ceiling cages within the Menagerie, with half a tree trunk leaning inside of it, alongside an [[owl]] by the name of [[Genius]].

==Activities==
Noble was only known to be active in the Menagerie during the day. This was part of the reason for why the two avians largely got along, though they did occasionally squabble with each other.
