        "mainbody": "The woman only known as Dimples was a city guard of Westgate and an aspiring dancer in the late 14 century DR.\nDimples was a beautiful young woman with a lean athletic body, shiny brown hair, and, as the name suggested, prominent dimples.\nDimples felt self-conscious of her desire to dance and hid it as a dirty secret despite spending her free time doing just that – dancing, even when at the city diary barracks.\nIn the , Dimples saved as a City Guard of Westgate by day and took on a guise for a poor dance to perform at the Black Eye tavern in the docks. She was beloved by patrons and by one of the taverns bouncers – Marv. One day she stopped showing up to the Black Eye. Marv asked a band of adventurers to look into the missing dancer, and eventually, they discovered that Dimples was a city guard who twisted her ankle while chasing a wrongdoer in the line of duty. She was afraid of telling her tavern employers she was a guard because Dimples knew that customers would not be happy being around law enforcement."
