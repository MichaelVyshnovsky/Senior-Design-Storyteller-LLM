        "mainbody": "The woman only known as '''Dimples''' was a city guard of [[Westgate]] and an aspiring dancer in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''She's got a tall, athletic build – not like none of those soft dancers you see jiggling themselves all around. Real pretty face, too. And long brown hair, shiny as anything you ever seen. Yeah, now that you mention it, she did have real pretty dimples on her cheeks. Hey... I guess that's how she got her name, huh?''|Marv the Bouncer}}",
        "Description": "Dimples was a beautiful young woman with a lean athletic body, shiny brown hair, and, as the name suggested, prominent dimples.",
        "Personally": "Dimples felt self-conscious of her desire to dance and hid it as a dirty secret despite spending her free time doing just that – dancing, even when at the city diary barracks.",
        "History": "{{quote|''Because I wasn't dancing, and you can't prove it!''|Dimples}}<br/>\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Dimples saved as a City Guard of Westgate by day and took on a guise for a poor dance to perform at the [[Black Eye]] tavern in the docks. She was beloved by patrons and by one of the tavern's bouncers – [[Marv]]. One day she stopped showing up to the Black Eye. Marv asked a band of adventurers to look into the missing dancer, and eventually, they discovered that Dimples was a city guard who twisted her ankle while chasing a wrongdoer in the line of duty. She was afraid of telling her tavern employers she was a guard because Dimples knew that customers would not be happy being around law enforcement."
