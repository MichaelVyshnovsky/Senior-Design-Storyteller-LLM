Tekinjo Gasahan was the daimyo of Kurahito around 1357 DR.
Tekinjo was the daimyo of the coastal Kurahito province and, as the brother-in-law of the shogun, one of the Three House daimyos. He was devastated when, in 1352 DR, he discovered that his wife, his only brother, and two senior members of the tairo were plotting his assassination. Tekinjo had all of them executed and afterward did not trust anyone, except for his secret friend and advisor, Ionoi.
Tekinjo had become withdrawn and cynical, but he still possessed a sharp mind and was very perceptive. He knew that the shogunate wanted him to remarry to produce an heir, but he totally disagreed with this.
