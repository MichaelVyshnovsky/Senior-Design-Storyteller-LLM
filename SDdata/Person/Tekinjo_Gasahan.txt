'''Tekinjo Gasahan''' was the daimyo of [[Kurahito]] around [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Tekinjo was the daimyo of the coastal Kurahito province and, as the brother-in-law of the shogun, one of the [[Three House daimyos]]. He was devastated when, in [[1352 DR]], he discovered that his wife, his only brother, and two senior members of the [[tairo]] were plotting his assassination. Tekinjo had all of them executed and afterward did not trust anyone, except for his secret friend and advisor, [[Ionoi]].

==Personality==
Tekinjo had become withdrawn and cynical, but he still possessed a sharp mind and was very perceptive. He knew that the shogunate wanted him to remarry to produce an heir, but he totally disagreed with this.
