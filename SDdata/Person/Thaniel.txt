'''Thaniel''' was the [[nature spirit]] that was connected to a stretch of wilderness the [[Western Heartlands]] near [[Moonrise Towers]]. He had a connection with [[Halsin]]. His split shadow-cursed half was Oliver.

{{Quote|Thaniel is no ordinary child - he is the very spirit of this land. If this Fist knows where he is, then perhaps we can save him...save everything.|Father [[Halsin]].}}

==Description==
Thaniel appeared as a young, non-[[Asmodeus|Asmodean]] [[tiefling]] child with tan, pock-marked skin, short-cropped black hair and two antlers that resembled those of a juvenile [[deer]]. As a spirit, Thaniel did not grow, appear older, or otherwise mature as any mortals would.

Whenever Thaniel appeared the smell of [[lavender]] manifested in the senses of others.

==Abilities==
The spirit Thaniel possessed a strong connection to the land he had bonded. He could feel the individual roots of every tree found throughout.

==Relationships==
{{Quote|I had a friend when I was young, long ago. He played with me in the forests where I grew up...but eventually, I realized no one else had heard of him. It was Thaniel, of course. Nature was my very first friend. I get older, but he hasn't changed a day.|Halsin.}}

Thaniel maintained a strong bond and friendship with [[Archdruid]] [[Halsin]] of the [[Emerald Grove]]. The spirit bonded to Halsin when the [[wood elf|elven]] druid was but a mere child. After Halsin learned of the troubles that came to plague Thaniel and his lands, the mighty druid dedicated himself to restoring the spirit to its rightful home.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1391}}, [[Shar]]'s devotee [[Ketheric Thorm]] brought the [[shadow curse]] upon Thaniel's lands, a deed that warped and maligned them for many decades. As a result, Thaniel's physical form was rendered in two halves, each of which remained on a different plane than the other. Thaniel as he was known became trapped in the [[Shadowfell]], while a second new portion of Thaniel, known as '''Oliver''', remained in what came to be known as the [[shadow-cursed lands]].

Thaniel remained trapped and weakened and asleep in the Shadowfell, while Oliver was continually twisted by the shadows that plagued the land to which his spirit was bound. Each half of Thaniel's spirit remained in their respective locales for over a hundred years. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, his friend [[Halsin]] left his [[Emerald Grove|druid grove]] to save Thaniel and later his split Oliver.
