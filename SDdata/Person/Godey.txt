'''Godey''' was a sentient [[skeleton]] servant of the [[vampire lord]] [[Cazador Szarr]], who resided in the [[Szarr Palace]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Godey was a decrepit skeleton adorned in ancient decaying plate armor and a helmet. A decorative [[Szarr]] family [[ring]] adorned the creature's skeletal finger, allowing passage to sealed and secured areas of the palace.

==History==
For centuries before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Godey had been tasked with torturing and keeping Cazador's vampire spawn in line and obedient. The torture sessions sometimes lasted for days in the palace's kennels. Despite the cruelty, Godey felt no ill will towards the targets of the torture and simply considered it to be doing his job. He did, however, enjoy sweet screams of his victims.
