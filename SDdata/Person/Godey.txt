Godey was a sentient skeleton servant of the vampire lord Cazador Szarr, who resided in the Szarr Palace of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Godey was a decrepit skeleton adorned in ancient decaying plate armor and a helmet. A decorative Szarr family ring adorned the creatures skeletal finger, allowing passage to sealed and secured areas of the palace.
For centuries before the , Godey had been tasked with torturing and keeping Cazadors vampire spawn in line and obedient. The torture sessions sometimes lasted for days in the palaces kennels. Despite the cruelty, Godey felt no ill will towards the targets of the torture and simply considered it to be doing his job. He did, however, enjoy sweet screams of his victims.
