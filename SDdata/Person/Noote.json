        "mainbody": "hief Noote was the grand ruler of all the hill giant tribes throughout the Ice Spires in 1366 DR.\nBeing excluded from a conversation often upset Noote.\nChief Noote considered King Camden to be one of his most respected friends. Camdens daughter Brianna considered him to be very kind and a trustworthy ally.\nAround 1366 DR, Chief Noote developed friendly relations with the royal family of Hartsvale. As a result, the kingdoms long standing feuding with the hill giant tribes of the Spires came to an end. During that year he would make many visits to Castle Hartwick.\nSometime after winter, Noote came to Castle Hartwick on the day of Briannas birthday and brought within a satchel a present for her in the form of a half-frozen snow leopard that he had killed. He expressed some confusion at King Camdens suggestion that the carcass needed \"prepared,\" but shrugged it off and suggested they dont lose the beasts claws, noting that they could make a good collar for a wolf."
