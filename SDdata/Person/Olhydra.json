        "mainbody": "the Crushing Wavethe Well of Endless Anguish\nOlhydra, the Princess of Evil Water, was a powerful archomental from the Elemental Plane of Water.\nIn her natural state, she appeared as a huge cresting wave with two eyes like large pearls or as a shapeless watery mass about  in diameter.\nOlhydra delighted in creating dangerous and destructive manifestations of water. She was eager to smash any vessel in her realm and destroy any city and town within her reach. She could surge forth tirelessly and relentlessly, but was patient enough to know when to draw back and when to attack, eroding her opponent.\nOf all the Princes of Elemental Evil, she was the most interested in mortals. She recognized pirates and seafaring raiders as her agents, whether they knew it or not, because they reddened the water with blood and occasionally dropped treasure into her clutches. She sometimes spared the worst of them, knowing they would deliver others to her.\nOlhydra was also affiliated with the Cult of the Crushing Wave.\nNeither Olhydra nor her followers were fond of Imix and his followers.\nIn the , Olhydra made an appearance within the mountain enclave of the blue dragon Abazigal, in Calimshan."
