'''Aleema Meddlebrook''' was a [[herbalist]] from [[Neverwinter]] who traveled along the [[High Road]] between Neverwinter and [[Luskan]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Description==
Aleema had deep tanned skin and dark brown hair.

== Relationships ==
Aleema was old friends with [[Miranda]], the occult supplier in Luskan.

==History==
Some time around the {{YearlinkName|1490}}, Aleema joined the merchant's caravan of [[Tollin]] and his crew going from Neverwinter to Luskan, accompanied by members of the [[Order of the Burning Dawn]]. The trip was somewhat of a disaster, as several members of their group went missing, and members of the caravan's group were attacked by mercenaries, an assault that was set up by the treacherous [[Martumal]].
