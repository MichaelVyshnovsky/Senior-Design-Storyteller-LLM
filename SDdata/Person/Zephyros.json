In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], after the shattering of the [[Ordning (social structure)|''ordning'']], Zephyros started working to find a solution for this crisis using the ''[[contact other plane]]'' spell. This somehow led him to [[Nightstone]] village just after some others cloud giants had bombarded the place. Zephyros was instructed by a [[Planar Sphere]] creature that an adventuring party he would find there could reconstruct the ''ordning''."
