'''Erione''' was a high-ranking member of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] at the [[Temple of the Black Earth]] in [[Tyar-Besil]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Personality==
Erione resented the fact that a few priests were in the cult's command structure and wanted to demonstrate that worship could bring even greater power.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Erione and four fellow cultists managed the temple's altar. She plotted to sacrifice [[Rukhelmoth Glitterstone]] in order to control a [[black pudding]] living under the temple. However, some adventurers infiltrated the temple and confronted and defeated her and her minions.
