Erione was a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Black Earth at the Temple of the Black Earth in Tyar-Besil during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Erione resented the fact that a few priests were in the cults command structure and wanted to demonstrate that worship could bring even greater power.
In 1491 DR, Erione and four fellow cultists managed the temples altar. She plotted to sacrifice Rukhelmoth Glitterstone in order to control a black pudding living under the temple. However, some adventurers infiltrated the temple and confronted and defeated her and her minions.
