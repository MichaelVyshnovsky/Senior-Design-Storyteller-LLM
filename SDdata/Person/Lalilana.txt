Lalilana was a jungle dweller tamhi warrior and hunter from the Malatran Plateau, active in the late 14 century DR.
Lalilana was a kind-hearted woman. Even though she was scared, her moral compass sent her to the confrontation with the spider katanga because it was the right thing to do.
In the late 14 century DR, the Tribe of the Wise Ones became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded spider katanga, the Mother of a Thousand Young, was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Lalilana was among the less experienced heroes of the Living Jungle who answered the call. Lalilanas group was heading into the spider katanga caverns, past the living quarters, and straight into the most dangerous part of the lair—the nest—to face the Mother.
It was unknown if Lalilana survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the Village of the Wise Ones for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and natures healing.
