Sherm was a dealer in herbal remedies from Luskan during the late 15 century DR.
Sherm had dark brown skin and dark hair gathered in a small bun on his head. He wore a green vest over his brown clothes.
Some time around 1490 DR, Sherm had a small shop called Sherms Herbs in the Luskan market district, where he encountered the Champion of the Burning Dawn.
