'''Sir Hydel Pontifax''' was an experienced adventurer and a friend of [[Artus Cimber]]. 

==Personality==
He was a devoted follower of [[Mystra]].

==History==
Hydel Pontifax hailed from a well off Cormyrian family and at a young age was tasked with mopping his father's store to teach the boy responsibility and value of hard work.

In [[1352 DR]], he saved Artus from a prison in [[Zhentil Keep]] and together they decided to search for the ''[[Ring of Winter]]'' and were opposed by [[Kaverin Ebonhand]] and his [[Cult of Frost]] minions.

Finally, in [[1362 DR]], they found the location of the Ring in [[Chult]] but when they arrived at the designated spot they found Kaverin. In the subsequent battle, Hydel was killed but he did not go immediately to the [[Fugue Plane]]. Instead, he appeared in the [[Temple of Ubtao]] in [[Mezro]], where Hydel failed a test and was condemned by the god [[Ubtao]], who ruled over Chult, to become a [[ghost]]. However, [[Mystra]], the goddess that Hydel venerated, intervened and reclaimed his soul. Until the two gods resolved the situation, he existed as a [[spirit]] and in that form he helped Artus to finish his quest. Afterward, Hydel resided in Artus's quarters in [[Suzail]], waiting to know his final destination.
