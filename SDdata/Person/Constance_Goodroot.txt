Constance Goodroot was a young farmer in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Constance helped her parents run their beet factory. They sold most of the crop to the Red Plumes.
Circa 1486 DR, her parents died of a strange illness contracted from a drow stranger who hid in their factory. She discovered them, but tried to keep everything quiet until she was old enough to inherit the factory. However, she was discovered by a patrol of Red Plumes and some adventurers who happened to be in the area at that time.
He was a cousin to the human cook Belmourn.
