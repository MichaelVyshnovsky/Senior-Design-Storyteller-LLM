'''Vichand''' was a [[mage]] and a member of the [[Red Wizards]] who lived on the [[Sword Coast]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Despite his considerable arcane prowess, Vichand was something of a coward and could be intimidated into submission.

==Abilities==
In addition be being an adroit [[spell]]-crafter, Vichand was a skilled calligrapher. He developed unique spell, inscribed upon a ''scroll of impactful doom'', that allowed him to imbue [[negative energy]] into base substances such as stone inducing illness in those nearby the source.

==Possessions==
He wore an [[adventurer's robe]] and carried with him a ''[[wand of paralyzation]]''. By some unknown means he had come into the possession of a single feather taken from a [[planetar]].

==Relationships==
After formally leaving the Red Wizards, Vichand garnered the enmity of his fellow Red Wizard and former traveling companion [[Edwin Odesseiron]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Vichand, Edwin, and another fellow Red Wizard decided to renounce the order of [[Thay]]an wizards, and join the [[Shining Crusade]] in earnest. While they initially only meant to serve as mercenary [[spellcaster]]s, Vichand was moved by the rousing words of the [[Shining Lady]] and considered himself to be a true believer of their cause.

Vichand remained with the crusaders while they besieged [[Bridgefort]] outside [[Boareskyr Bridge]] during the [[War of the Shining Crusade]]. He planned on using the ''[[voidstone]]'' to drive out the people remaining in Bridgefort and claim victory for the crusade. The crusaders launched the great boulder into the top level of the keep and it immediately inflicted tremendous illness on many people within.
