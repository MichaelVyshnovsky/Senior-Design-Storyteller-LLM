Vichand was a mage and a member of the Red Wizards who lived on the Sword Coast during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Despite his considerable arcane prowess, Vichand was something of a coward and could be intimidated into submission.
In addition be being an adroit spell-crafter, Vichand was a skilled calligrapher. He developed unique spell, inscribed upon a scroll of impactful doom, that allowed him to imbue negative energy into base substances such as stone inducing illness in those nearby the source.
He wore an adventurers robe and carried with him a wand of paralyzation. By some unknown means he had come into the possession of a single feather taken from a planetar.
After formally leaving the Red Wizards, Vichand garnered the enmity of his fellow Red Wizard and former traveling companion Edwin Odesseiron.
In the , Vichand, Edwin, and another fellow Red Wizard decided to renounce the order of Thayan wizards, and join the Shining Crusade in earnest. While they initially only meant to serve as mercenary spellcasters, Vichand was moved by the rousing words of the Shining Lady and considered himself to be a true believer of their cause.
Vichand remained with the crusaders while they besieged Bridgefort outside Boareskyr Bridge during the War of the Shining Crusade. He planned on using the voidstone to drive out the people remaining in Bridgefort and claim victory for the crusade. The crusaders launched the great boulder into the top level of the keep and it immediately inflicted tremendous illness on many people within.
