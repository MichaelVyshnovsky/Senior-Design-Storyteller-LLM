The group came under attack by a band of [[troll]]s, who abducted several of Cerandis's scouts and planned to eat them. Cerandis enlisted the aid of the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] from nearby [[Neverwinter]] to rescue her missing scouts.\n\nLater, Cerandis sought to recruit [[adventurer]]s to defeat the [[fey]] [[Master of the Hunt]] whose exploits in the [[Realm of Malabog]] was inadvertently driving [[Malabog]]'s army into the territory of New Sharandar, threatening to overrun the small outpost."
