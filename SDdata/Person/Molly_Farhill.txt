Molly Farhill was a gnome cleric of Oghma and a mercenary in the late 15 century DR.
Molly was part of the Church of Oghma before she became a sellsword.
Molly had outstanding tactical skills, which had helped the cleric disrupt her enemies plans multiple times.
Among the spells she could cast were sacred flame, dispel magic, Oghmaâ€™s blessing, and read thoughts.
