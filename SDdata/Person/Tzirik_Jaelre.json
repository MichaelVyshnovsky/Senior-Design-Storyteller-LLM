        "mainbody": "zirik Jaelre was a drow high priest of Vhaeraun and a member of House Jaelre in the late 14 century DR.\nHe was short, stocky, and—unusual for a drow—bald. He wore black mithral plate armor with demonic figures and gold filigree, with a ceremonial veil of black silk.\nIn the , Tzirik was approached by a group of drow led by Quenthel Baenre with an old acquaintance, Valas Hune, in tow. The group was investigating the Silence of Lolth and sought a cleric of another god to inquire about their goddess. Tzirik agreed to do this service for them if they retrieved the Geildirion of Cimbar from a beholder lair in Myth Drannor. They did so and Tzirik reveled that Lolth had sealed herself away in the Demonweb Pits. The group decided to use astral projection to visit the Demonweb Pits and supplicate the goddess themselves. Tzirik escorted them. Once in front of Lolths temple, Tzirik gated in Vhaeraun, who began attacking the face of Lolth. When the other drow turned on him, he used his divine magic to push them back until Pharaun Mizzrym ordered Jeggred Baenre, who had stayed behind to guard the groups bodies, to slay Tziriks physical form, thus returning the group to the Material Plane."
