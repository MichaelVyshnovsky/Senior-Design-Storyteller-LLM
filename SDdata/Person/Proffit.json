            "March against Nesmé": "During the time that Obould Many-Arrows declared war on the [[Battlehammer]]s of [[Mithral Hall]], Proffit commanded his minions to drive the [[human]] inhabitants out of [[Nesmé]], and was successful. Many humans were killed, and several became refugees. Obould was impressed with the progress Proffit's legions had made, and suggested that the troll's army should raid the dwarven tunnels of Mithral Hall. That way, the war could continue on all fronts, and would not provoke [[Alustriel Silverhand]] of [[Silverymoon]], as surely a war out in the open would.\n\nObould and [[Gerti Orelsdottr]], who led the [[frost giant]]s of the area, met with Proffit and his forces. Together, they planned the next stages of attack, after the initial assault of the eastern gate of Mithral Hall. The task was split up between the three major forces, so Proffit led his trolls through the [[Upperdark]], whilst the others assaulted on the surface. Proffit was assigned two [[drow]] guides, [[Tos'un Armgo]] and [[Kaer'lic Suun Wett]]. His drow guides thought to tell him that he was being used by the [[orc]] king, but instead, convinced him to chase the Nesmian refugees and a potential dwarven countercharge.\n\n{{fq\n|text=Their leader, a great brute named Proffit, has eluded us.
