'''Lurandural Veltree''' was a representative of [[The Halanthor]] merchants' guild of [[Scornubel]], the Caravan City, in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Lurandural was a [[half-elven]] male with fair features and long hair.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Lurandural Veltree did business with [[Orstrar Galannavruk]] and [[Andred Kuroone]] of [[Zazesspur]] who traded in [[thael leaf]] â€“ [[pipeweed]] flavoring, [[herb]]s, [[spice]]s, and dried foods and fruits, such as [[apricot]]s. Lurandural tested Andred's merchandise using his "test pipe," carved in a peculiar manner made popular in the 1200s DR and onwards. It was carved to resemble a [[stirge]]'s skull. Lurandural's acquaintance with Orstrar and Andred was through the [[Waukeenar]] named [[Jhalanavress Tanthavur]].
