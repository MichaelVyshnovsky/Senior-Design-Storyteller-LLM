        "Personality": "Like the other druids of her enclave, Faldorn supported the use of violence in the struggle of nature against the encroachment of men. \n\nDespite her militant beliefs, Faldorn's speech and behavior were surprisingly mellow and laid-back.",

        "History": "Faldorn was born within the [[Black Raven tribe]] of [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s. When she was just an infant, she was given away to the a group known as the Shadow Druids. The enclave of druids raised her as their own.\n\nDuring the [[iron crisis]] of [[1368 DR]], Faldorn fought against the [[Iron Throne]] mercantile organization. She sought to end their mining operation that was active within the [[Cloak Wood]] forest.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Baldurian Iron Throne, Faldorn traveled south to [[Amn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. She came across a druidic circle whose grand druid had recently died. Faldorn took over leadership of the [[druid grove (Amn)|druid grove]] near [[Trademeet]] with the aid of her fellow Shadow Druids. She may had been sought out and challenged by [[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions, but the event's outcome remained unknown.\n\nAs the Shadow Druids continued for over a hundred years later well into the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The order continued their operations in memory of their former leader.<ref name=BGIII\">"
