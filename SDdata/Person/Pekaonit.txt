'''Pekaonit''' was a [[korobokuru]] chieftain in the [[Northern Wastes]] of [[Kara-Tur]].

==History==
Pekaonit inherited his position as chieftain of the village of [[Karoah]] but thanks to his violent nature he defeated or drove off all challengers. He led his fellows in constant fighting with other korobukuru tribes, [[human]]s, and [[humanoid]]s in his belief in the survival of the fittest.
