        "History": "Illistyl was born in [[Shadowdale]]. She first met the Knights while they were searching for a [[weretiger]] that had killed the thief [[Alura Durshavin]]. [[Doust Sulwood]], at that time the Lord of Shadowdale, allowed her to live in the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]] after her parents died fighting with [[Zhent]] forces.\n\nShe was tutored in the magic arts by [[Jhessail Silvertree]] and when her teacher became pregnant, Illistyl replaced her among the Knights. After Jhessail's child was born, Illistyl quickly stepped down and acted as baby-sitter for the young one while the mother returned to fight. She later took care of the magical needs of the Dalesfolk in place of the deceased [[Sylune]]."
