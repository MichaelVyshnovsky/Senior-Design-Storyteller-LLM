==Description==
Mandii was a human woman with a light skin tone, chestnut hair, and dark green eyes.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees along the way in the process. Some of the Baldurians did not take kindly to the refugees flooding the outskirts of the city, while others took to protesting. Mandii Harvestmoon was among the protestors in Rivington and believed that there should be more guards patrolling the refugee tent city, protecting Baldurians from them. She was also a supporter of the city's new Archduke [[Enver Gortash]] and his [[steel watcher]]s.
