Knucklespine was the leader of the Muckgrunter trolls of Forestfall Fen in the late 15 century DR.
Knucklespine led its fellow trolls in battles for territory within the Fen against the Queenstooth kobolds.
When a group of adventurers were sent to investigate Forestfall Fen on behalf of Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, they came into conflict with Knucklespine. They defeated it, breaking or dislocating several of its bones, but were unable to finish it off before it retreated into the muck.
