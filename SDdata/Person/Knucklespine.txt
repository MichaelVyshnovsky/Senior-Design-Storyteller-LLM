'''Knucklespine''' was the leader of the [[Muckgrunter]] [[troll]]s of [[Forestfall Fen]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Knucklespine led its fellow trolls in battles for territory within the Fen against the [[Queenstooth]] [[kobold]]s.

When a group of [[adventurer]]s were sent to investigate Forestfall Fen on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]], the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], they came into conflict with Knucklespine. They defeated it, breaking or dislocating several of its bones, but were unable to finish it off before it retreated into the muck.
