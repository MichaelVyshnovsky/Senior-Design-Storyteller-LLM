        "mainbody": "Lamet was an inhabitant of Daggerford around 1370 DR.\nLamet once lived in Port Llast but one day was arrested for the theft of a bottle of wine. Four years later, he was released from jail but exiled from the town with all his family. His household excommunicated him and so Lamet went alone to Daggerford. In 1370 DR, he was considering opening a small shop as knife sharpener.\nHis home was located in the northwest corner of Daggerford on Horse Way."
