'''Domino''' was a [[yuan-ti pureblood]] [[illusionist]] who was a servant of [[Esau Enoch]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
As a yuan-ti pureblood, Domino looked fairly [[human]]-like, but she had no hair and fine diamond-shaped scales. To hide her yuan-ti heritage when engaging with non-yuan-ti, she wore hooded [[robe]]s and [[glove]]s to cover the vast majority of her skin. She also donned a half-[[mask]] to help conceal the upper part of her face.

==Abilities==
Domino was a spellcaster who knew spells such as ''[[cause fear]]'', ''[[snake charm]]'', ''[[polymorph other]]'', ''[[sticks to snakes]]'', ''[[spook]]'', ''[[ventriloquism]]'', ''[[illusory wall]]'', ''[[hallucinatory terrain]]'', among others.

She could spit venom that caused [[blindness]].

==Possessions==
She had three ''[[darts of homing]]''.

==History==
Domino was a member of Esau Enoch's band who were run from [[Iniarv's Tower]] when it was assaulted by Sir [[Justin Melenikus]]. She and the remainder of her band fled to [[Wolfhill House]] in the [[Mere of Dead Men]] following the defeat, where she performed duties such as casting ''[[illusion]]'' spells to protect and hide the yuan-ti Laboratory.
