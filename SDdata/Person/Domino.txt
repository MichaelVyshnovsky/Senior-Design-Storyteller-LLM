Domino was a yuan-ti pureblood illusionist who was a servant of Esau Enoch in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
As a yuan-ti pureblood, Domino looked fairly human-like, but she had no hair and fine diamond-shaped scales. To hide her yuan-ti heritage when engaging with non-yuan-ti, she wore hooded robes and gloves to cover the vast majority of her skin. She also donned a half-mask to help conceal the upper part of her face.
Domino was a spellcaster who knew spells such as cause fear, snake charm, polymorph other, sticks to snakes, spook, ventriloquism, illusory wall, hallucinatory terrain, among others.
She could spit venom that caused blindness.
She had three darts of homing.
Domino was a member of Esau Enochs band who were run from Iniarvs Tower when it was assaulted by Sir Justin Melenikus. She and the remainder of her band fled to Wolfhill House in the Mere of Dead Men following the defeat, where she performed duties such as casting illusion spells to protect and hide the yuan-ti Laboratory.
