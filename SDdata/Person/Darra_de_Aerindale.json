        "mainbody": "Lady Dowager Duchess Darra de Aerindale was an aged mage member of the Order of the Eternals who originally came from the world of Oerth and eventually settled on the world of Aphonion in the Kingdom of Streams End.\nLady de Aerindale had expensive tastes and wore a lush robe of purple and a perfectly curated collection of jewelry. Her immaculate appearance was legendary, as she never allowed anyone to see her improper or messy. At the age of 78, Darra appeared much younger than a human woman of her age would normally be. She kept aging at bay through magic concoctions and dyed her hair to hide the gray.\nShe was a woman of refined manners, proud, cultured, and respectable, to the level others couldve perceived her as morose and stern. She was a lover of magic, considering spells to be intellectual feats and exercises – her favorite topic of discussion. Despite her seeming haughty appearance, Darra loved children, child-like adults, and sentient talking beasts.\nDarra was an accomplished wizard. One of her powers of note was an ever-present halo of immaterial ghostly eyes of differently-colored irises that gently looped around her head. The strange eyes allowed the Lady mage to see invisibility and improved her physical perception, making it almost impossible to surprise or ambush her.\nLady Darra de Aerindales origins were on the homeworld of Mordenkainen – Oerth. Eventually, she was no longer welcome in her home. By some means, Darra found a way to the world of Aphonion, where she settled in the Kingdom of Streams End, where she wed Lord Darius. Years passed as Darra prolonged her life through potions of longevity and application of hair dyes. She had one adopted son, Paramecium the Ferret, a sentient talking animal Darra had a soft spot for. Eventually, Lord Darius and Paramecium both passed of old age. Lady Darras second husband, Larius, died in battle shortly before she turned 78. For the most part, since Lariuss death, Darra remained alone, accompanied by her sentient animal companion, Piron the Ferret, the great-great-great-great-great-great...grand-nephew of Paramecium.\nDespite her age, Darra did not care for retirement and sought to learn new things and share her magical knowledge and wisdom. In the late 14 century DR, the Order of the Eternals, a trans-dimensional guild for magic-users of impressive power, elected to hold its 1,238 annual Symposium in the city of Ravens Bluff on the world of Toril, in order to secretly investigate its unusually high levels of magical energies and planar incursions. The Symposiums attendees included Magi Paragon the Purple, one of the High Masters of the Order, and Darra de Aerindale, along with Piron the Ferret. All the guests stayed at Glittering Star Inn for the multi-day event. Paragon the Purple, however, was a victim of an opportunistic robbery with his cloak of the art and spellbook taken, and eventually returned with some aid from the wizardly heroes of the Living City."
