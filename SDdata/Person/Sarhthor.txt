'''Sarhthor''' was a [[wizard]] and a member of the [[Zhentarim]] during the hunt for [[Shandril Shessair]].

==History==
At first, Sarhthor appeared to be a member of the Zhentarim and one of the most favored assistants of [[Manshoon]] in the hunt for the ''[[spellfire]]'' of Shandril Shessair.<ref>

However, when Shandril arrived in [[Zhentil Keep]] intent on destroying the Zhentarim for killing her friends, aided by [[Mirt]] and some [[Harper]] agents in disguise, it was revealed that Sarhthor was a Harper agent sent to infiltrate the Zhentarim a long time before. By then, however, nobody knew where Sarhthor's true loyalty lay. At first, he appears to want to use Shandril to dominate the Zhentarim. But at last, as [[Fzoul Chembryl]] threw a javelin at Shandril, Sarhthor protected her with his body. Before he died, he told Shandril how to use the ''[[Crown of Fire]]''.<ref>
