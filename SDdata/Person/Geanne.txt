Sister Geanne was an undead nurse who worked alongside Malus Thorm, a servant of the goddess Shar, of the House of Healing in the town of Reithwin throughout the 15 century DR.
Geanne was a pale-skinned, shambling, undead creature of some sentience. She had lavender hair and bladed – Geannes eyes were stitched shut. Like other sisters, she was dressed in the elaborate garb of a nurse.
Like other sisters, Geanne was armed with scalpel and had the ability to release a mind screech – a powerful psionic attack that clawed at and damaged the living creatures souls. During surgeries, the Sister used a leech.
Sister Geanne lived in the town of Reithwin in the Western Heartlands before its fall sometime before the . During that time, Geanne and other nurses performed healing and other medical procedures in Reithwins House of Healing. The nurses entertained themselves by making wagers on what sorts of foreign objects they would extract after being lodged in their patients backside orifice. Geannes bets included marbles and a flute.
At some point during the towns fall into dark worship of Shar or after the Shadow-cursed Lands consumed Reithwin in the late 14 century DR, Sister Geanne perished and was changed by the dark Shadowfell magic. As of the late 15 century DR, Malus Thorm and his nurses operated out of the House of Healing in the Shadow-cursed lands. They spent their unlives "experimenting" on innocents that either wandered, or were brought against their will, into his hospital. Malus attempted to teach his Sisters the finer arts of what he called surgery but was ultimately unsuccessful.
Sister Geannes fate after turning undead remained unconfirmed. She couldve been slain by the True Heroes of Baldurs Gate during their quest to stop the Absolute or left in peace in the shadow-consumed House of Healing.
