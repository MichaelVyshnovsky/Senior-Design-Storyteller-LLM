Elgrol Darrusk was a war hero sometime in the early history of Kh么ltar, the Iron City, located in south Faer没n.
Elgrol was a very large and corpulent man without much grace in his movement or bearing.
He was a lovable oaf who displayed courage when it counted the most.
When a horde of orcs assaulted Dubrinlar, the eastern gate through the double walls of Kh么ltar, legend has it that Elgrol held the gate single-handedly for hours before dying of his many wounds. A statue in his likeness was erected inside the guardhouse that served  Dubrinlar, and the building was named Darrusktraal after him.
The gates of Kh么ltar were constructed during the tenure of Shieldlord Angloam Dubrin (Year of the Alabaster Mounds, 577 DR, to the Year of Orcsfall, 619 DR) so Dubrinlar (named after Angloam) was also completed during this period therefore, the heroic deeds of Elgrol Darrusk took place sometime after that date.
