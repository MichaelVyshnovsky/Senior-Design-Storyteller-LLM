'''Pim Pebblefoot''' was a famed [[hin]] hero, active sometime in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Pim hailed from a humble agricultural village in the small area known as the [[Gray Hills]] in the [[Savage Frontier]]. Selfless and brave young halfling [[archer]], Pim gained renown and respect when he singlehandedly drove a band of [[fiend]]s from his village's burial grounds. Soon, his good deeds made him a hero in the village and among the surrounding communities. He quickly became praised by his elders and swarmed by village girls, despite his withdrawn personality.

The halfling hero was always seen patrolling the Gray Hills, in any weather, day or night, any time of the year. He was often seen by the local shepherd standing tall (for a halfling) atop a hill overlooking the village and its fields, armed with his trusty [[bow]] and a puffing [[smoking pipe]].

Unlike many fellow heroes, Pim Pebblefoot lived a long and glorious life. He spent some years among the [[Knights in Silver]], fighting off [[orc]]ish hoards, and drove out [[giant]]s who invaded the nearby [[Evermoors]]. Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Pim Pebblefoot's life ended a the ripe old age of 135 years. His favorite [[enchanted]] [[boots]] – ''[[The Sturdy Feet of Pim]]'', were inherited by Pim's great-nephew, an aspiring adventurer named [[Prand Pebblefoot]] who was last seen heading to the Jewel of the North – the city of [[Neverwinter]].
