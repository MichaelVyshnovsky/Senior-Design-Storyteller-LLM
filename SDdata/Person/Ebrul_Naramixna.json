Ususi seems to judge the message as befitting the personality of the Lord Apprehender, implying that she is familiar with the Lord Apprehender of 1363 DR, and that the person has not changed. Iahn Qoyllor makes no reference to any changes in the position, and refers to the Lord Apprehender as simply Lord Apprehender, strongly implying that there have not been changes since. Thus, this article makes the assumption that Ebrul Naramixna is the Lord Apprehender from at least 1363 DR to 1374 DR.",
