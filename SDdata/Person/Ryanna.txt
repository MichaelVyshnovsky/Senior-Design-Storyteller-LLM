Ryanna was a vampire who briefly took up innkeeping alongside Moria in 1369 DR.
Ryanna was a tall, attractive woman with tousled red hair and green eyes.
When acting as a human, Ryanna was cheerful, flirtatious and kind. When the time came to strike, she was perfectly predatory and heartless towards her victims.
Ryanna had the usual abilities of a vampire, including taking a gaseous form.
Ryanna carried a long sword, which she had learned to use in her life as a fighter.
Ryanna and Moria briefly operated the Journeys Rest inn near Hultail, hoping to snare lonely travelers who wouldnt be missed.
In the , Ryanna and Moria killed a married couple and their two handymen who had just finished renovating the abandoned Journeys Rest inn. Deciding to let their prey come to them, the vampires took up the inn for themselves and hired the barmaids Maris and Cora. Their first attempt was on the necromancer Ratakos, who easily overpowered them and was then immediately offered a better deal. Ratakos would create undead that would attack travelers, prompting them to take shelter instead of passing by the inn. Ryanna and Moria would drain and kill the customer, and Ratakos would then receive the fresh body for his necromantic studies.
This new plan came apart within the month, when the merchant Portis Alvermantle fled the inn after suspecting something was wrong, Lord Rhyn Mournsoul and Alanis Dirgesong were too important to risk killing, and the only other potential victims were a group of adventurers. Depending on how the adventurers protected themselves, Ryanna and Moria either bided their time, or attacked and were driven out of the Journeys Rest.
