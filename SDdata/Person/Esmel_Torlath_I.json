        "mainbody": "King '''Esmel Torlath I''', known as \"Serrus the Great,\"<ref group=\"note\">Serrus meant \"Great General\" in an obscure Amnian dialect, making his title \"Great General the Great.\" was the legendary first king of [[Amn]] and the founder of the [[Torlath]] dynasty.",
        "Possessions": "Esmel bore the magical blade ''[[Namarra]]'', \"The Sword That Never Sleeps.\" It was passed down to his descendants for several generations until Prince [[Ereskas Torlath]].{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|22}}",
        "Activities": "King Esmel set about building Amn as a proper realm with an eye to the future, not a mere warlord's domain. One of the first projects he ordered was the construction of the [[King's Arch]] over the [[River Esmel]], while one of the last was the construction of the new capital of [[Esmeltaran]], only completed the year after his death.",
        "Relationships": "Esmel's grandchildren included [[Imnel Torlath I|Imnel I]] and [[Amnur Torlath|Amnur]], each of them a heroic figure in their own right.",
        "History": "The [[Shoon Imperium]] was shattered in the {{YearlinkName|450}}, following the sacking of [[Shoonach]] and killing of Emperor [[Amahl Shoon VII]] by King [[Strohm I]] of [[Tethyr]]. A period of civil war ensued as nobles and courtiers fought among each other to claim the empty throne. In [[460 DR]] the Western Emirate of Amin was claimed by the native-born General Esmel, who declared himself the King of Amn and first of the Torlath dynasty. At the time, his domain consisted of the city-states of [[Athkatla]], [[Murann]], and [[Crimmor]], with the furthest territories extending to [[Lake Esmel]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|479}}, his son Prince Imnel led the armies of Amn against the [[ogre]]s of the [[Small Teeth]] in a series of battles called the [[Ogre Wars]]. During the battle of [[Imnel's Scar]], his son discovered the [[Armory of Nedeheim]], a cache of powerful magical giant-made weapons that were stored away in Athkatla.\n\n[[Calishite]] nobles led an expedition in [[491 DR]] to conquer and colonize the lands east of Amn, absorbing [[Valashar]] and [[Meiritin]] and building [[Eshpurta]]. Hostilities with the oppressive and violent realm would continue on and off for centuries.\n\nKing Esmel died in [[511 DR]], and was succeeded by his grandson Imnel."
