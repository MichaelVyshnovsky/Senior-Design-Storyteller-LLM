'''Bellodar III''', known as the '''Sage King''', was the monarch of [[Impiltur]] of the [[Durlarven Dynasty]] during the 7{{th}} century [[DR]]. He ruled over the kingdom from the [[642 DR|Year of Sifting Sands, 642 DR]], to the [[673 DR|Year of the Covenant, 673 DR]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}

==History==
Prior to his ascension to the Golden Throne, Prince Bellodar was married to [[Elthia|Princess Elthia]] of [[Chessagol]].{{Cite dragon/277/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Soargar's Legacy}}

===Legacy===
King Bellodar III was the first monarch to set down a unified set of laws for Impiltur, known as the ''"King's Code"''. These regulations were drawn from centuries of regional customs and practices that originated from the ancient tribes of [[Narfell]].

The ''King's Code'' remained the basis for the subsequent laws that were implemented in the realm of Impiltur and further altered by the royal dynasties that ruled in the following centuries.

King Bellodar III died in 673 DR of natural causes and was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Morus|Prince Morus]].
