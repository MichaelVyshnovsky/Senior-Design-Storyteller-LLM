Syndrith was the High Priestess of Lolth at the Temple of the Spider in the Northdark circa the late 15 century DR.
While on most occasions Syndrith appeared drow priestess, she was capable of transforming into the form of a drider.
She was served by Lord Jevahn Jhalvar and his drow warriors that stood guard over the entranceway leading to her temple, as well as Halbryn Dark Stalker, head of a band of drow assassins.
Some time during the late 15 century DR, Syndrith and her Deathweavers came into the possession of dark ritual that they sought to perform on behalf of their goddess Lolth. They began by creating some sort of interconnected energy field over the village of Rothé Valley, as part of SarkonIss expedition to found the above-ground outpost of "New Xorlarrin", in order to control the wild arcane energy let loose by the Spellplague and shape it into a reformed version of the Weave that could be controlled by Lolth herself.
While the formation of New Xorlarrin and the drow Deathweavers were thwarted by the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge, Syndrith continued their work at the Temple of the Spider within the Underdark. The hero and their adventuring party ventured into the Shallows beneath Rothé Valley, and stormed the temple, slaying Syndrith and preventing the perversion of the Weave that bound arcane magic on Toril.
