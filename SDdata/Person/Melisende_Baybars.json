        "mainbody": "Melisende Baybars lived on the island of Kaff in the Djinnis Claws in 1367 DR.\nMelisende was as near to physical perfection as most mortals could come.\nHer personality was the polar opposite of her striking beauty, filling her with a cold heart and twisted thoughts. Her evil nature was often masked by false courtesy.\nMelisende was a formidable opponent, possessing martial and magical skills.\nMelisende owned a pair of bracers of defense +5, a magical sword, and a wand of magic missiles.\nShe was the daughter of Alim Baybars. Her mother, and namesake, was from the strange lands far west of the borders of Zakhara. Only her fear of his power kept Melisende from killing her father."
