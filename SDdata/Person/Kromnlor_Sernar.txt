Kromnlor Sernar was a sage and midwife inhabiting Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Kromnlor rented a room at an inn called Warm Beds located in Waterdeeps Dock Ward where Presper Street met Ship Street. She could typically be found there early in the morning or late at night. She specialized in nature lore, specifically fungi and herbs of the Sword Coast, north Faer√ªn, and the Heartlands. She wandered the Dock Ward providing services as a midwife to those in need, clashing frequently with the Guild of Apothecaries & Physicians who did not appreciate her effective use of herbal remedies.
She was originally from Sespech.
