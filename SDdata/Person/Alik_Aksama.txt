Alik Aksama was a merchant and the proprietor of Fine Rugs in the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Alik was always busy. The three tents of Fine Rugs streamed with customers, most of whom never left empty-handed.
Alik imported fine rugs from distant Kara-Tur or had cheaper rugs woven by his apprentices in Huzuz.
