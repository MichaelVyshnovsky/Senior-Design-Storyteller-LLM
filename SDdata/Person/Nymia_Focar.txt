'''Nymia Focar''' was a [[fighter]] and [[tharchion]] of [[Pyarados]] of [[Thay]].

==Description==
Nymia was handsome with a wide, sensuous mouth. She had several silver rings in each ear and a stud in the left side of her nose..

==Personality==
Nymia was often friendly and informal with her underlings, sometimes even took them to her bed. However, she could turn into a ferocious disciplinarian when encountering a setback, sometimes even flogging soldiers who had played no part in whatever had gone amiss - often her former lovers were the ones who wound up tied to the whipping post.

==History==
Nymia played a great role during the war of the zulkirs as one of the highest-ranked commanders of the allied forces.
