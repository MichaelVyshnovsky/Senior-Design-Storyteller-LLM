'''Eryn Lashir''' was a [[half-elven]] wilderness guide who lived in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. While he was somewhat excitable, Eryn was quite experienced in exploring the less civilized regions of [[Faer√ªn]]. He would travel alongside adventurers, charging them by the mile.

Eryn operated his business, [[Ways Unknown]], in the [[Torchtown]] neighborhood within the Bluff's [[Uptown District]]. When he wasn't venturing out through [[Toril]], Eryn maintained living quarters within his shop.
