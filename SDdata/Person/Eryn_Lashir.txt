Eryn Lashir was a half-elven wilderness guide who lived in the city of Ravens Bluff during the 14 century DR. While he was somewhat excitable, Eryn was quite experienced in exploring the less civilized regions of Faer√ªn. He would travel alongside adventurers, charging them by the mile.
Eryn operated his business, Ways Unknown, in the Torchtown neighborhood within the Bluffs Uptown District. When he wasnt venturing out through Toril, Eryn maintained living quarters within his shop.
