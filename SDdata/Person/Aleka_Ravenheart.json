        "mainbody": "'''Aleka Ravenheart''' was an officer of the [[Purple Dragons]] in charge of the garrison of [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]], who served in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Aleka had an athletic build and wore her black hair in a long braid.",
        "Personality": "She was dependable, dutiful, and took her position very seriously, though she could be lured into making foolhardy decisions.",
        "Possessions": "She wore [[chainmail]] armor and carried a [[longsword]], in addition to a ''[[ring of regeneration]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Aleka was good friends with [[Haverish Hallefon]], innkeep of the [[Bubbling Bulwark]] and a former soldier in her regiment.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], she was in charge of the 40-strong Purple Dragons garrison of [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]].\n\nHer investigation ultimately uncovered the involvement of the [[Emerald Swords]] [[Adventurer|adventuring]] company, who had actually kidnapped Lord Thistle and murdered the [[doppelganger]] [[Xixis]] in his place. As it was \"merely' kidnapping and not the murder of a noble, she had the authority to have the Swords exiled from [[Cormyr]], rather than executed."
