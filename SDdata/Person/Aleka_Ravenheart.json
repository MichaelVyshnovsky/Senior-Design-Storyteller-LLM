        "mainbody": "Aleka Ravenheart was an officer of the Purple Dragons in charge of the garrison of Thistleflame Keep in Suzail, who served in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nAleka had an athletic build and wore her black hair in a long braid.\nShe was dependable, dutiful, and took her position very seriously, though she could be lured into making foolhardy decisions.\nShe wore chainmail armor and carried a longsword, in addition to a ring of regeneration.\nAleka was good friends with Haverish Hallefon, innkeep of the Bubbling Bulwark and a former soldier in her regiment.\nIn 1369 DR, she was in charge of the 40-strong Purple Dragons garrison of Thistleflame Keep in Suzail.\nHer investigation ultimately uncovered the involvement of the Emerald Swords adventuring company, who had actually kidnapped Lord Thistle and murdered the doppelganger Xixis in his place. As it was \"merely kidnapping and not the murder of a noble, she had the authority to have the Swords exiled from Cormyr, rather than executed."
