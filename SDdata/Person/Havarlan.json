        "mainbody": "Havarlan was a silver dragon \"paladin\" who devoted herself to the dragon god Xymor and led the Talons of Justice until her death in 1373 DR.\nIn her silver dragon form, she had several scars from her many crusades. While traveling, she usually took the form of a humanoid female warrior with silver-blonde hair.\nHavarlan was a dedicated, almost fanatical, crusader against evil. She was oath-sworn to the Ptarian Code and specifically to the tenets of Xymor.\nUnlike most dragons, Havarlan had no lair. Instead, she was a wandering dragon.\nThanks to her dedication to Xymor, the dragon god had given her powers similar to those of the paladins. In return for those powers, Havarlan had to donate half of her treasure to the communal funds of the Talons.\nIn 1373 DR, she send two of her Talons, Azhaq and Moonwing, to capture the song dragon Karasendrieth under orders of the King of Justice Lareth for defiance of councils decisions about the abnormal Rage of Dragons of that year.\nWhen Lareth and his lieutenant Tamarand challenged each other over whether to help humanoid races against the Rage, Havarlan was chosen to be one of the witnesses of the duel, the other being the powerful gold dragon sorcerer Larendrammagar.\nAfter being decided to help the humanoid races, Havarlan led a group of metallic dragons to broke the siege of chromatic dragons to the Monastery of the Yellow Rose.\nIn the final battle against Sammaster, Havarlan led all her Talons against the draconic horde of Sammaster. Amid the battle, she engaged Sammaster on her own and was killed by the necromancer."
