        "mainbody": "'''Lamona''' was a Sharran Fidelian – a [[mage]] in the hidden [[Cloister of Sombre Embrace]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Lamona was a [[wood elven]] woman with a pale skin complexion, watery grey eyes, [[tattoo]]ed neck, and white hair streaked with pink. She wore [[Church of Shar|Sharran]] Fidelian [[robe]]s and hid her face behind a white [[porcelain]] mask adorned with [[Shar]]'s ''[[holy symbol]]''.",
        "Abilities": "Like her fellow Sharran Fidelians, Lamona wielded a [[quarterstaff]] in battle and was proficient with dark magics that created clouds of ''[[darkness]]''. She herself was not hindered by such clouds as Sharran Fidelians were ''born into darkness'' – they could freely see in magical ''darkness'' and could never be blinded.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Lamona served the Mother Superior [[Viconia DeVir|Viconia DeVir]] in the underground Cloister of Sombre Embrace as one of her cultists underneath the [[House of Grief]]. Lamona, along with the entirety of the cloister may have confronted its rogue member named [[Shadowheart]], were she to turn away from Shar. Lamona could have perished in the struggle. By other accounts, Fidelian and the rest of the cloister helped defend the city of Baldur's Gate from the army of the [[Absolute]], were Shadowheart to remain loyal to her evil deity, or if Shadowheart was betrayed and surrendered to the Mother Superior for punishment."
