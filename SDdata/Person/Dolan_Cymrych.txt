'''Dolan Cymrych''' was High King of the [[Moonshae Isles]] for a brief time in the mid&ndash;9{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|33}}

==Relationships==
He was a member of the [[Cymrych Dynasty]] and the second son of his predecessor, High King [[Kevan Cymrych|Kevan]]. His successor was his first son, [[Conn Cymrych]].

==History==
Dolan assumed the throne of the High King in the {{YearlinkName|850}}, following the death of his father.

Only two years later, in the {{YearlinkName|852}}, a massive fleet of [[Illuskan]] [[longship]]s arrived from the [[Sword Coast]] seeking to invade and settle the Moonshaes. Dolan and his son, Prince Conn, led a flotilla of [[coracle]]s to meet them in [[Whitefish Bay]], but they were hopelessly outmatched and their fleet was all but destroyed.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|27}} Dolan died in that sea battle as he covered his followers' and son's retreat, and the ''[[Crown of the High King]]'' sank with him. The loss of the ''Crown'' would severely weaken the political power of his successors, who would go on to fight and ultimately concede territory to the same "[[Northmen]]" invaders over the next century.
