'''Halamor''' was a businessman in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], sometime before the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. He made a fortune renting out rooms and floors of [[Halamor's Tower|his tower]] on [[Orntathtar Way]] to many finecrafters who deburred, assembled, or polished much of the hardware produced in the Iron City. He died a wealthy man, but even after his death his name was still associated with his eponymous tower and [[Halamor's Sure Service]], a package delivery business located on [[Hael Way]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|79}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 61: Khôltar, Part 12, A Tour of Dubrinlar}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|68}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 54: Khôltar, Part 5, The Farrgaunlar}}
