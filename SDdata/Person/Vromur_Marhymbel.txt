'''Vromur Marhymbel''' and his brother [[Ilund Marhymbel|Ilund]] ran the well-reputed [[Marhymbel House Shipways]] shipwright business out of [[Sarshel]] in [[Impiltur]], in the [[1490 DR|1490s DR]].

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Ilund and Vromur were second-generation shipbuilders. They produced reinforced and rugged top-quality naval vessels in reasonably fast timeframes, earning the reputation of being some of the best shipwrights of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].
