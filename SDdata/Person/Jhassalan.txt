Jhassalan was an arcane devotee of Tyr in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.
Jhassalan hailed from Silverymoon in Luruar but departed to become an adventurer. With the Guild of the Just, a party of Tyrrans, he attacked the House of Pain, a temple of Loviatar in Undermountain, in order to free captives, but they were ambushed by the Loviatans. Jhassalan escaped only after the intervention of Muiral the Misshapen.
From that time, he devoted himself fully to Tyr and led the spellcasting forces of the Hall of Justice in Waterdeep.
Jhassalan retained his hatred for the local Church of Loviatar, hoping one day to uncover the source of their funds. His namesake derived from his predilection for electricity spells.
