'''Deirk Erlich''' was a man living in [[Hillsfar]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Shackles of Blood|10}}

==History==
Deirk lived with his family in the slums of Hillsfar until ''circa'' [[1486 DR]], when his brother [[Haakon Erlich]], a officer of the [[Red Plumes]], told him that the [[Tinfellow Farm]] was now vacant and he could take him there. Deirk, with his sons and a carpenter, started repairing the farm along with [[Baar Tworgeir|Baar]], when an adventuring party arrived asking about the [[Tinfellow]] family. Deirk lied to them, saying that he had lived here for years and had recently been attacked by [[elves]].
