'''Enna Hendrick''' was a farmer who resided in the village of [[Imnesvale (town)|Imnesvale]] in the [[Umar Hills]] of [[Amn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Enna was a woman of humble means. She wore commoners' garb. Enna was a [[human]] with a bronze skin.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the village of Imnesvale faced a slew of disappearances and locals did not hesitate to blame the legendary [[Umar Witch]]. Enna and her husband [[Erlin Hendrick]] fled their distant farm in fear of the dreaded witch and stayed within the Imnesvale. They brought their seven favorite [[chicken]]s over to the village. The chickens were not pets but rather the couple's future meals. Curiously enough, one of the chickens they brought over to Imnesvale had swallowed a precious [[beljuril]] [[gemstone]] that was still inside it.
