The tower was a heavily trapped and dangerous place, making some inhabitants of the town wonder about the wizards kindness.\nCholandrothipe used his magic for a fee to transport cargo safely across the Feather Falls. His fee usually fell into the 25â€“50 gp range, causing many to believe he had quite the stash of coin hidden somewhere within his tower."
