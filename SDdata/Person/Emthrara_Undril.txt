Emthrara Undril was a female human Harper who worked as a dancer at The Laughing Lass tavern in Suzail to maintain her cover.
Emthrara was beautiful with long blonde hair.
Emthrara once defeated and took apart a clockwork horror, so she was called by Laspeera Inthré to help analyze the remains of the abraxus during the abraxus affair in 1369 DR.
Emthrara wore a silver locket around her neck that contained a tiny silver harp, the sign of a Harper.
Emthrara was proud of the fact that she had met Elminster and he paid her a compliment about her dancing.
