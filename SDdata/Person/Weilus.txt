'''Weilus''' was one of the [[Blades of the Old Man]] as of {{yearlink|1374}}. On the night of [[Tarsakh 25]], they became aware of an intruder in [[Sentinelspire (fortress)|Sentinelspire]]. While they were looking out for the intruder, they came across [[Lewan]] and [[Ulaan]]. On his orders, [[Dayul]] and [[Turan]] tried to get them to return to their room; however, this led to a fight. He took Lewan's hammer during the fight, but was killed by swarming [[killoren]] not long after.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||35}}
