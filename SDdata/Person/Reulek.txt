Reulek was a duergar ghost at the Fane of the Eye under Tyar-Besil during the Elemental Evil crisis.
In life, Reulek had a partnership of convenience with an oni called Obratu.
Reulek descended into the Fane with an intent to recover the treasures of Besilmer. After he stole a helm from the kings tomb, he was ambushed and killed by four drow ghosts and rose again as a ghost himself.
In 1491 DR, some adventurers infiltrated the Fane and were confronted by Reuleks ghost. During the encounter, Reulek was ultimately destroyed.
