Abu bin Sujah was a renowned Zakharan desert rider who sought the fabled city of Suj around 1367 DR.
Sujah wore voluminous, white desert robes, crowned with a white turban. He wore leather riding boots, and carried a curved longsword in a scabbard attached to his waist. He had tan skin and a short, black goatee.
He was considered to be the foremost horseman of his people.
Sujahs sword was magically enchanted, and was especially powerful when wielded against genies. His horse, named "Hisan", was outfitted with a bridle of speed.
Owing to his great skill at mounted combat, Sujah was entrusted to lead his people in raids against other tribes. He became interested in the seals of the princes, said to have been secreted away in the mythical city of Suj.
