        "mainbody": "The '''White Stag of Labelas''' was a unique servant of the [[Elf|elven]] god [[Labelas Enoreth]], who was only ever observed on the island of [[Evermeet]].",
        "Description": "The White Stag of Labelas was a powerful, horned, snow-white [[Celestial creature|celestial]] [[stag]], standing {{SI|7.5|ft|long=yes}} tall, with rippling muscles and glowing red eyes. Its divine aura was visible even with the naked eye.",
        "Abilities": "The White Stag was fearless and highly intelligent. If forced to defend itself, it struck with hooves and antlers. It also had the magical power to mislead those who would harm it with an effect similar to the ''[[lose the path]]'' spell, which would remain for a whole day.",
        "Activities": "When not delivering messages for its god, the stag was believed by elven scholars to spend its time in the realm of [[Arvandor]]. It was a herbivore who was active during daylight hours.",
        "History": "The White Stag was said to appear on the Island of the Elves whenever elves were in danger or in need of divine wisdom or advice or as an omen of great events. When followed, the stag would lead elves to a place where a vision or other divine message would be received."
