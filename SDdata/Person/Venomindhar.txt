'''Venomindhar''', known as simply '''Venom''', was a [[green dragon]] who dwelt in the southern woods of [[Cormanthor]] in the millennium before [[Dalereckoning]]. She always acted in unison with her mate [[Venominhandar]], also called Venom, and nobody realized they were in fact two dragons.

==History==
Settling in the Emerald Vale in {{Yearlink|-982}}, they corrupted the area until it became known as [[Tangled Vale]].

They also killed many [[centaur]]s during this age.

The female Venom, Venomindhar, was slain in battle in {{YearlinkName|-249}}.

The male Venom, Venominhandar, was eventually confronted and killed by the [[moon elf]] warrior [[Jassin Aunglor]] in the {{YearlinkName|-206}}.

At one point they sired an heir, [[Vendemniharan]], who later joined the [[Cult of the Dragon]].
