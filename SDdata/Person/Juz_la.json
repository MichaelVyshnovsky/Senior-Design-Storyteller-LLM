        "mainbody": "'''Juz'la''' was a [[tainted one]] and independent spy of [[Skullport]] and [[Waterdeep]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Juz'la was born and raised in Skullport. From a young age, she made a living as a freelance spy and sold secrets for coin.\n\nHowever, she drew the ire of the [[yuan-ti]] slaver [[Zstulkk Ssarmn]], who captured her, trained her as a [[sorcerer]], and finally turned her into a tainted one. Zstulkk used Juz'la as a spy to infiltrate the [[church of Cyric]], but she converted truly to the worship of [[Cyric]] and for some time worked as a double agent. When her master learned of her duplicity, she managed to escape to the surface.\n\n''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], Juz'la worked as a minor spy lord on behalf of a number of Waterdhavian merchants and [[guild]]s."
