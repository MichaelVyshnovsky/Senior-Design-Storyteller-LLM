He wore a long black robe.\nDuring the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, Ingval sought the help of passing adventurers (from Eberron) in regards to the missing War Wizard Barthand, who had gone and investigated the cave system below the ruins of a burnt-out house on the edge of Eveningstar in pursuit of the strange dreams and voices that had been haunting the people of Eveningstar. Though a capable War Wizard, Barthand did not return. When the adventurers showed up, Ingval explained the situation in depth and asked that they investigate the caves and rescue the wizard. Within the caves they found the night hag Frelga, who was working for the drow invaders."
