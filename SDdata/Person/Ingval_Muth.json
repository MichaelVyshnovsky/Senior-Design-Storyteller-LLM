They feel a malevolent presence, and a harsh voice calls out, \"Where is the [[Thread of the Weave]]? Tell us or die!\" Then the dreamers hear a foul laugh and awaken with a feeling of uncontrollable fear.\n|Ingval\n}}\nDuring the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], Ingval sought the help of passing adventurers (from [[Eberron]]) in regards to the missing [[War Wizards|War Wizard]] [[Barthand]], who had gone and investigated the cave system below the ruins of a burnt-out house on the edge of Eveningstar in pursuit of the strange dreams and voices that had been haunting the people of Eveningstar. Though a capable War Wizard, Barthand did not return. When the adventurers showed up, Ingval explained the situation in depth and asked that they investigate the caves and rescue the wizard. Within the caves they found the [[night hag]] [[Frelga]], who was working for the [[drow]] invaders."
