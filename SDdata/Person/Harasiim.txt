'''Harasiim''' was a mage from [[Turmish]] who lived in [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/98/The Ministry of Art: Ravens Bluff's Newest Government Branch|6}} He held the seat of [[abjuration]] in the [[Ministry of Art]], which managed affairs of [[magic]] in the City of Ravens.

==History==
Harasiim immigrated from Turmish to Ravens Bluff, taking his whole household with him. He became a prominent and distinguished mage in his new home.

He joined the newly established Ministry of Art.

==Personality==
He was charismatic.

==Relationships==
Following the Turmish custom of group marriage, Harasiim had three wives.

==Description==
Handsome, middle-aged, and a little overweight, he had dark skin with a mustache and a beard cut square after the Turmish custom. Similarly, he had three blue dots on his forehead that indicated his learning in reading, religion, and [[magic]] and a blue-stone earring in his left ear to show he was married. For these, the folk of Ravens Bluff gave him the nickname 'Harasiim the Blue', though he never used it himself.

==Activities==
While Harasiim conducted his magical studies, his wives ran a number of prosperous business, both in Ravens Bluff and beyond.

==Home==
They lived on [[Hippocampus Street]] in the [[Tlasbras]] neighborhood of the [[Ravens Bluff/Southside District|Southside District]]. Known as the "Blue Castle", the house was massive and looked like a mock castle, including battlements, tapering turrets, extra-large banners, and a number of portcullises, which would slam shut one after the other each dusk.
