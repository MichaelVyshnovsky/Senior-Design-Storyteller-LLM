        "mainbody": "aheb al-Zidq was a noble dao inhabiting Ajayib in Zakhara in 1367 DR. \nDespite being a mighty noble among the dao, Zaheb was madly in love with the Calipha of Ajayib, Halima al-Wahsi. He spent most of his time at Halimas side, hoping to win her affections. \nAside from driving off other potential suitors, it seemed that all of Zahebs efforts were wasted since the Calipha viewed him as a favorite pet and nothing more."
