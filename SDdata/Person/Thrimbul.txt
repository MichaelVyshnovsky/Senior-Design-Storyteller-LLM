Thrimbul was a dwarven historian that lived on the Sword Coast North during the late 15 century DR.
The dwarf studied Mount Hotenow and its history and recruited adventurers to help in his research.
Thrimbul had a strong ally and good friend in Heartleaf, a dryad that dwelled within a lone tree that grew just outside the entrance into Mount Hotenow.
Years Mount Hotenow erupted in the , and the city of Neverwinter was well underway in its rebuilding efforts, dwarves of Clan Hillborn led an expedition into the volcanic mountain. A set of dwarven ruins dating back to ancient Delzoun had been uncovered, and the Hillborn expedition sought to investigate, hoping to link the lost fortress to the fabled dwarven realm of Gauntlgrym.
The work of historian Thrimbul and that of the rest of the expedition was greatly hampered by the activities of the mad fire giant Gommoth and the cult of Maegera. Thrimbul worked with the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to recover some ancient dwarven artifacts, cull the number of fire archons that roamed around the ruins, and defeat their leader, General Ignazar deep within Fireguard Fortress.
