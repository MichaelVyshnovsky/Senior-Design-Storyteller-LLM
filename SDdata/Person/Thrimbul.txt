'''Thrimbul''' was a [[dwarven]] historian that lived on the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The dwarf studied [[Mount Hotenow]] and its history and recruited adventurers to help in his research.

==Relationships==
Thrimbul had a strong ally and good friend in [[Heartleaf]], a [[dryad]] that dwelled within a lone tree that grew just outside the entrance into Mount Hotenow.

==History==
Years Mount Hotenow erupted in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, and the city of [[Neverwinter]] was well underway in its rebuilding efforts, dwarves of [[Clan Hillborn]] led an expedition into the volcanic mountain. A set of [[Fireguard Fortress|dwarven ruins]] dating back to ancient [[Delzoun]] had been uncovered, and the Hillborn expedition sought to investigate, hoping to link the lost fortress to the fabled dwarven realm of [[Gauntlgrym]].

The work of historian Thrimbul and that of the rest of the expedition was greatly hampered by the activities of the mad [[fire giant]] [[Gommoth]] and the [[cult of Maegera]]. Thrimbul worked with the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to recover some ancient dwarven artifacts, cull the number of [[Elemental myrmidon|fire archon]]s that roamed around the ruins, and defeat their leader, [[Ignazar|General Ignazar]] deep within [[Fireguard Fortress]].
