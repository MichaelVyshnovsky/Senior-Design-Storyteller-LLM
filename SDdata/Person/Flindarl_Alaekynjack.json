        "mainbody": "lindarl Alaekynjack was the proprietor of the Walking Out to Meet the Dragon drinking establishment in Mosstone, Tethyr, in the 14 century DR.\nFlindarl was the man who built the tavern and named it after the bravest thing hes ever done - covered in cold sweat of terror, he walked out to meet a marauding dragon, as a distraction for an adventuring band. The dragon saw no danger in the terrified man and pounced to play with its food. Even though Flindarl was injured and crippled by the dragons maw, he survived the battle thanks to the adventurers who ended the wyrms rampage with swords and spells. Alaekynjack received his share of the dragons hoard and used it to build one of the best taverns in Tethyr. He offered a warm welcome to half-orcs, adventurers, disfigured folk, outcasts, and other people who mightve been given the cold shoulder anywhere else. By the end of Flindarl Alaekynjacks life, he had a lot of close friends and was beloved and respected by all. He passed several years after his wife perished from a strange fever. As of the late 14 century DR, Flindarls mountain of a daughter, Kardeera Alaekynjack, ran her fathers establishment and was just as friendly and beloved as her old man."
