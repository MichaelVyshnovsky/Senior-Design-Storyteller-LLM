        "mainbody": "ovo was an inhabitant of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR. He was an assistant to blacksmith Aunsible Durn and notably was revealed to be posing as the ghost of the bandit chieftain Fastred as part of a spy ring.\nWhile many folk in town thought him a moron,\nHe was big and strongly built. He was known to wear a cloak and a hat, which carried a badge of the smiths guild formed from a feather and their sigil.\nFor his ghost costume, Dovo donned a worn breastplate an antique helmet, small and squat with a visor but no plume and carried a large axe with an edge  in length. He smeared himself and his things with a luminous green paint made from glimmergrass.\nHe had a wife and three children, but he neglected them and they suffered because of it. Instead, he was a philanderer always looking for another woman to sleep with, regardless of whether she was married.\nDovo was a mate of some of Gharss like-minded fools and ruffians. He enjoyed riling up Rolf by bothering Mayella. Even his associates in the spy ring, Tobald and Grodoveth, didnt escape his annoying ways.\nDespite Dovos many personal faults, his boss Durn at least found him to be a good worker, though he recognized his failings. He ordered him to keep his pranks and philandering well away from the smithy and his business, and not to annoy the customers.\nWhen off duty, he spent most of his time at the taverns, rather than with his family.\nAs part of the spying ring, Dovos duty was to go out at nights to the edge of the Vast Swamp and signal coded messages given to him by Grodoveth (largely economic data) to another agent within or beyond the swamp in Sembia. To allay suspicion, following Grodoveths suggestion, he disguised himself as the ghost of the bandit chieftain Fastred this scared off those who saw him, and if caught he could pass it off as just a prank. To signal discreetly, he used a bullseye lantern.\nIn the first several days of working for Aunsible Durn, Dovo put a burr under his friend Argys Krals saddle so it threw him when he mounted. Durn chewed Dovo out for that and he carried out no more of his pranks, at least at the smithy.\nAt some point in the , Dovo was secretly recruited by Tobald, the mayor of Ghars, and Grodoveth, a disgraced envoy of the crown, who were agents of the Iron Throne. Whether he knew this or not, or if he was given a false story of serving Cormyrean agents or smugglers or even knew what he sent would go unknown, but he was likely just in it for the money and the chance to frighten the town.\nTo lay the groundwork for his ruse, on Mirtul 27, Dovo claimed a ghost had attacked him while riding home from the Swamp Rat tavern, even showing off a cut cloak supposedly slashed by its axe. After this, townsfolk were ready to believe him to be the ghost an Arabel merchant on Kythorn 12, Diccon Picard on Kythorn 27, Elizabeth Clawthorn on Flamerule 8, Lukas Spoondrift on Flamerule 21, Bortas and his wife on Eleasias 16, and Bryn Goldtooth on Eleasias 28, all nights when he was sending messages. However, Dovo would grow over-confident and self-important, by speaking familiarly with Tobald and Grodoveth in public and hinting at his exploits to others.\nFinally, sent off early from work on Eleint 16, Dovo went to the Bold Bard tavern and had a North Brew with his buddies. He bothered the young Mayella Meadowbrock, and succeeded only in scaring her and her dog. In her defense, Rolf stepped in, Dovo insulted him, and the two got into a brawl that ended when tavernkeeper Shortshanks broke it up and sent out Rolf for starting it. Falsely magnanimous, Dovo offered to buy a drink for everyone, but only one to share. Later, Dovo tried to pick up Kendra, but the adventuress, familiar with his type, proved the better at insulting and belittling him. He put a hand on her arm, she a knife on his neck, and Kendra and Shortshanks threw him out. Dovo even threatened her, but fled from her anger. His performance this night would be his undoing, for Tobald and Grodoveth both witnessed his reckless behavior and feared hed reveal his role just to impress a woman, and elected to get rid of him before he exposed them.\nGoing out to play ghost and spy again that night, Dovo was spotted by Jasper and scared him off. He was later met by Grodoveth, who took his axe on some excuse. Dovo lost his fingers, head, and life to Grodoveths professional swing.\nJasper and the War Wizard Lindavar found his body the next day and reported it. Joined by retired War Wizard Benelaius, Captain Flim of the Purple Dragons, Doctor Braum, Kendra, and Mayor Tobald, they examined the murder scene, with Tobald interjecting false theories to throw the others off the truth, such as that the ghost of Fastred had killed him. They considered Dovos many enemies, both people offended and husbands cuckolded. His body was taken to town and his family informed. Jasper, Benelaius, and Lindavar investigated his murder over the coming days. Durn considered trying to help Dovos widow and children to get by without Dovos income. Meanwhile, one of Dovos treacherous cronies planted his cloak and hat in the Bold Bard to make it appear his ghost ruse was only a scheme with Shortshanks to drive customers away from the rival Swamp Rat tavern. \nBenelaius solved the crime and revealed the spy ring on Eleint 21, but blamed Tobald as Dovos murderer, having manipulated evidence and his findings to conceal Grodoveths role after his death and protect the honor of the Cormyrean crown."
