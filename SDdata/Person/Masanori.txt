'''Masanori''' was a [[shogun]] of [[Wa]] who ruled around 1717 ([[1299 DR]]).

==History==
In 1717 (1299 DR), two [[ninja]]s infiltrated [[Aru]] disguised as [[pilgrim]]s and tried to assassinate Daimyo [[Koji Kubahachi]]. They were killed in the attack, Koji couldn't find who hired them, and in revenge and as a message to his unknown enemy, he executed every one of the pilgrims in the train. At this brutal excess, Masanori removed Koji both from office and from the mortal world.
