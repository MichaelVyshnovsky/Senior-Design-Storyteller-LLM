        "mainbody": "'''Mournak Steelsmite''' was a fearsome [[dwarf|dwarfish]] [[battlerager]] who raged and ate his way across the shores of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "By the age of fifty-four Mournak was infamous across the Sea of Fallen Stars for rushing to battle singing a battle song. He left trails of goblin and orcish limbs and broken weapons. Once he entered one of his battle rages, Steelsmite was equally dangerous to his friends and foes. Mournak feared nothing, not even death, and he only accepted a payment of copious amounts of food and drink.\n\nSometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, Mournak Steelsmite was among the ambitious fortune seekers who were interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally mysterious magical ''orb'' from its depths."
