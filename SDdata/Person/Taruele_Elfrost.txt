'''Taruele Elfrost''' was an adventuress in [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].

==History==
Taruele was born in [[Yhaunn]] to a wealthy [[human]] merchant of the [[Taprylorn]] family. She lived in luxury until her father died and her father's family expelled Taruele and even tried to kill her.

She escaped and resettled in [[Highmoon]] in [[Deepingdale]]. There she became the apprentice of the sorceress [[Ilythyrra]] of Sevenskulls. Six years later, Ilythyrra was killed by some evil adventurers. When she discovered the crime, Taruele hunted and killed all of Ilythyrra's killers.

Back in Deepingdale, she accidentally met her family, the Taprylorns, who'd arrived with a retinue in the dale. Soon after a battle broke out and Taruele killed many of her kin and their servants. At last, exhausted, she was cornered by her enemies when the [[Company of the Catlash]] arrived and saved her. She joined them.

In 1370 DR, the Company decided to go to Myth Drannor in order to acquire some magic items to empower them.
