Taruele Elfrost was an adventuress in Myth Drannor in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Taruele was born in Yhaunn to a wealthy human merchant of the Taprylorn family. She lived in luxury until her father died and her fathers family expelled Taruele and even tried to kill her.
She escaped and resettled in Highmoon in Deepingdale. There she became the apprentice of the sorceress Ilythyrra of Sevenskulls. Six years later, Ilythyrra was killed by some evil adventurers. When she discovered the crime, Taruele hunted and killed all of Ilythyrras killers.
Back in Deepingdale, she accidentally met her family, the Taprylorns, whod arrived with a retinue in the dale. Soon after a battle broke out and Taruele killed many of her kin and their servants. At last, exhausted, she was cornered by her enemies when the Company of the Catlash arrived and saved her. She joined them.
In 1370 DR, the Company decided to go to Myth Drannor in order to acquire some magic items to empower them.
Taruele was a member of the Company of the Catlash.
Taruele was very happy to finally have a rightful place for her and friends and companions. She was thrilled to see the fabled Myth Drannor and gain some of its magic.
