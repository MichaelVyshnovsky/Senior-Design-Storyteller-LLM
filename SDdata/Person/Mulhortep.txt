Mulhortep was the precept of Thazarim in far northern Mulhorand during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Given the close proximity to Thay, Mulhorteps main focus was ensuring border security against the land of the Red Wizards. Mulhorteps abilities as a competent general and leader of soliders served him well as precept here.
