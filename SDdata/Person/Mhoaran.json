        "mainbody": "King Mhoaran the Tusk-Bearded of the House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul was the first king of the Lions Dynasty of Tethyr.\nMhoaran was a thick and tall man and a powerful warrior.\nKing Mhoaran was known for his powerful temper, but he was also a shrewd ruler.\nMhoaran was a great-grandsonLands of Intrigue Book 3 Erlkazar and Folk of Intrigue conflicts with Book 1 Tethyr in claiming that Mhoaran was the son of Cyrianas third sister instead of her only brother. On the other hand, Book 1 also claims that Mhoaran was a grandson of Sybille, not a great-grandson.\nBecause of so many assassination attempts on his family, Mhoaran lost three wives and was the father of more than 40 children, as he attempted to produce an heir.\nMhoaran was born in 919 DR, the Year of the Chase.\nHe and his father, Prince Atann, believed him to have a more legitimate claim to the throne, as Atann should have been the male heir of Sybille rather than the line having passed through Queen Cyriana to Queen Teresa the Great as it did. For this reason, Mhoaran built up an army and staged a military coup to take the throne from King Teremir, Teresas son. When Teremir refused to step down from the throne, Mhoarans army attacked, and Mhoaran himself slew King Teremir. The year was 959 DR.\nKing Mhoarans reign was an unstable time, where the nobles of the land sought to assassinate him and his family to restore the Bormul Dynasty. Mhoaran tried to protect his children by hiding them at birth and having them raised in secret. Even so, the first sixteen sons of Mhoaran died before they could reach adulthood.\nUpon his death, his seventeenth son (and 32 child), Nearel, succeeded him as king in 974 DR."
