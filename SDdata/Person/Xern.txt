Xern was a monk at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose.
Xern was a member of the Order of the Chisel of the Disciples of St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred. His duty was to act as wine master and cook for the monastery and occasionally also for the Guest House. Secretly, he was also a member of the Cult of the Howling Hatred.
Xern was one of the cultists who infiltrated the monastery in 1491 DR. He brewed the cordial that cultists used to keep Mother Savahn unconscious.
Xern was one of the few to know fellow monk Nym personally. He also was a good friend of Ovon.
