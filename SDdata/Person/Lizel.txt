'''Lizel''' was a vendor employed by Master [[Velsin]] in [[Sundabar]] in [[1373 DR]].

==History==
In 1373 DR, [[Aliisza]], while in disguise, saw Lizel treated rudely by [[Yrudis Gregan]] and somehow sensed that her father, a city guard, was killed some nights before by some [[tanarukk]]. Later in the [[House of the Triad]], [[Tauran]] allowed Alissza inside Lizel's mind. She discovered that she was a follower of [[Ilmater]] and had two younger sisters, [[Kaiga]] and [[Sadil]], who needed new clothes.
