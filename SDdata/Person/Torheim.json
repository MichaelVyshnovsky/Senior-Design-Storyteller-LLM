Upon showing him the [[favor coin]] they had received from the Ministry's [[Azoth Malishar|Master Fire]], Torheim recounted a dream that Thor gave him a few days prior. In it he came across a warrior, who outstretched a bloody hand holding a [[gold]] coin resembling the coin held by the adventurers. He then outstretched his own hand, revealing two coins. The warrior took one of them, saying it was \"For the slaying of foes,\" and then took the other whilst saying it was, \"For the recovery of the prisoner's token.\" The warrior then gave Torheim a golden feather and he woke up from the dream to find two favor coins in his purse. If the adventurers had fought the giants, then Torheim gave them one of his favor coins as a reward.\n\nTorheim then told the adventurers that he was in Jotunheim to scout out the area around the giant fortress-city of [[Utgard]] for a scheme that required a great deal of planning if he was going to pull it off. He also explained to them that the city was ruled by [[Utgard-Loki]], a powerful child of the [[Giant pantheon|Giant power]] [[Thrym]], whom he had plans to embarrass utterly. Torheim offered the adventurers his second favor coin if they were willing to break into the nearby [[Okalnir|Brimir's hall]] and steal from its proprietor [[Brimir]] a [[deva]] feather he kept in a clay jar. He advised against fighting the hall's over fifty giants and waited for them to return before dusk the next day.\n\nWhen the adventurers returned the next day and bestowed upon him the feather, he finally explained why he wanted it. Torheim was on a mission to free a deva that was imprisoned within the depths of Utgard, which the feather belonged to, and having the feather would enable him to narrow down the [[angel]]'s position. He then presented a [[priest]] of either [[Ilmater]], [[Torm]], or [[Tyr]] in the party a ''[[power key]]'' of ''[[hold person]]'', saying that the Norse god Tyr was pleased with their actions.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|24}}"
