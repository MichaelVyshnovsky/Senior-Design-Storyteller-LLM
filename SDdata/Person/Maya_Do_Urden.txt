'''Maya Do'Urden''' was the youngest daughter of [[Malice Do'Urden]] and a priestess of [[Lolth]] in [[House Do'Urden]] of [[Menzoberranzan]].

==Description==
Maya was slender but strong, stronger than her brother [[Drizzt]].

==History==
Maya was the youngest of the three daughters of Malice Do'Urden.

In [[1297 DR]], when House Do'Urden attacked [[House DeVir]], Maya was connected to her brother [[Nalfein Do'Urden]] and felt the moment he died. She notified her family, thus saving newborn [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], who was about to be sacrificed due to his status as the third living son. However, with Nalfein's death, Drizzt was spared, as he was then the second living son.

Maya was involved in Drizzt's first test to teach him the way of the drow: Maya brought her "champion," [[Byuchyuch]] (a [[goblin]] transformed into a [[drow]] warrior, to challenge Drizzt. Drizzt defeated Byuchyuch easily, but was forced to kill him. Maya then attacked him with her mace; he struck her back and was severely punished because males were not allowed to ever strike females.

When House Baenre and [[Bregan D'aerthe]] attacked House Do'Urden following the failure of [[Zin-carla]], Maya is slain in the attack, her body shot with several needles. 

==Possessions==
Maya wielded a [[mace]] and [[shield]].

==Relationships==
Maya's mother was Malice Do'Urden and her father was [[Rizzen Do'Urden]], the house patron.<ref>
