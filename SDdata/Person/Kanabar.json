The eye tyrants were ordered to hunt down the Shadovar sorcerer Melegaunt Tanthul and then wipe out the stone giant settlement of Thousand Faces in the Greypeaks.\nDuring the takeover of Thousand Faces, Kanabar charmed a lone giant by the name of Aris, sparing his life from its fellow beholders. Some time later, the elven warrior Galaeron Nihmedu rescued Aris and incapacitated Kanabar with a shadowy, gum-like material, and used its own anti-magic ray to undo the charm placed upon him. Finally freed, the stone giant gripped the devious floating eye in his palm and smashed it on the cliff side like a ripe melon."
