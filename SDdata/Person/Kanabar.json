        "History": "Kanabar was among those beholders enthralled by the [[phaerimm]] that escaped from the [[Sharn Wall]] within the depths of the [[Shaeradim]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. The eye tyrants were ordered to hunt down the [[Shadovar]] sorcerer [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] and then wipe out the [[stone giant]] settlement of [[Thousand Faces]] in the Greypeaks.\n\nDuring the takeover of Thousand Faces, Kanabar ''[[charm]]ed'' a lone giant by the name of [[Aris (giant)|Aris]], sparing his life from its fellow beholders. Some time later, the [[elven]] warrior [[Galaeron Nihmedu]] rescued Aris and incapacitated Kanabar with a shadowy, gum-like material, and used its own anti-magic ray to undo the charm placed upon him. Finally freed, the stone giant gripped the devious floating eye in his palm and smashed it on the cliff side like a ripe [[melon]]."
