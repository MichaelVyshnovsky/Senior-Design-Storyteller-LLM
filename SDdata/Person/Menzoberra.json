        "History": "After decades of infighting among the [[drow]] of [[Golothaer]], and at the behest of the Spider Queen, who gave her the title ''[[Yor'thae]]'' (the Chosen), Menzoberra the Kinless led seven drow families from their southern holdings of [[Great Bhaerynden]] into the [[Northdark]].\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>When escorting the refugees through the caverns, she came across dwarven mines, inhabited by the iron mining [[Clan Black Axe]]. The two groups fought in a fierce battle, but eventually Menzoberra's forces prevailed. They, however, took significant losses, and their numbers were halved. As the last dwarf, [[Dorn Black Axe]], fell to the ground, he cursed her invaders and wished upon them \"the doom of many eyes\".\n\nBy {{Yearlink|-3917}}, after several years in the dark deeps of the [[Underdark]], the refugees came to a giant cavern inhabited by a swarm of [[spider]]s and the legendary [[beholder]], [[Many Eyes]]. After a long battle with many losses for the drow, Menzoberra laid the final blow on the beholder. When the battle was over, a [[yochlol]] appeared in front of the surviving drow proclaiming the cavern was to be their new home: \"Menzoberranzan\" in recognition of Menzoberra's service to Lolth.",
