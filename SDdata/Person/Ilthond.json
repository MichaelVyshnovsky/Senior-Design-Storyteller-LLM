        "Description": "During his young apprentice years Ilthond could often be found in his dirty gray robes; made so by his cleaning duties. He was extremely thin and had a slightly hunched back. His face often showed the resentment he felt for all living things, especially his fellow wizards.",
        "History": "Ilthond was originally assigned to Darkhold to study under [[Ashemmi]] along with three other apprentices - [[Kadorr]], [[Sashen]], and [[Yarkul]]. As the least experienced of the four apprentices most of the mundane and unpleasant duties fell to him, and he was little more than a servant to head apprentice, Kadorr. That lead to Ilthond's resentment and contempt for all of the other wizards in the keep, including Ashemmi and [[Sememmon]] himself.\n\nAfter Sememmon and Ashemmi's disappearance Ilthond became an apprentice and loyal follower of [[Manshoon]]. In [[1357 DR]], he was briefly involved in the hunt for [[Shandril Shessair]], helping his wounded master after a fight with Shandril. He also tried to capture Shandril but only barely managed to save himself from her ''[[spellfire]]''.\n\nIn later years, he was relocated to [[Dagger Falls]] as one of the senior wizard assigned to the Zhent occupation army in Daggerdale. In 1369 DR, Ilthond was involved in the kidnapping of Daggerdale's rightful heir and freedom fighter leader [[Randal Morn]]. Ilthond had a skirmish with the adventurers recruited to free Randal and with the powerful [[arch-shadow]] [[Gothyl]].\n \nDuring the final battle for the liberation of the Dale, Ilthond was attacked and consumed by Gothyl."
