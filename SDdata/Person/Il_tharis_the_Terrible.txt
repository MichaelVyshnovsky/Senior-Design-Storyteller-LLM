Il'tharis was summoned by the [[drow]] ritualist [[Vur'din]] alongside many other [[slaad]]i, as part of an operation led by Mistress [[Laerion'vyr]]. Il'tharis was kept enslaved to the will of Vur'din by a control gem, and if the summoner was slain and the gem broken, Il'tharis would simply leave the plane.
