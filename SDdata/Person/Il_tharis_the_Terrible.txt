Iltharis the Terrible was a gray slaad summoned to a drow outpost beneath the Stonelands in the late 15 century DR.
Iltharis was summoned by the drow ritualist Vurdin alongside many other slaadi, as part of an operation led by Mistress Laerionvyr. Iltharis was kept enslaved to the will of Vurdin by a control gem, and if the summoner was slain and the gem broken, Iltharis would simply leave the plane.
