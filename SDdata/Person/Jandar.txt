'''Jandar'''  was a jeweler and the operator of a shop within the [[Priador Emporium]] in the [[Thayan enclave (Proskur)|Thayan enclave]] in the city of [[Proskur]] around [[1372 DR]]. He was quite skilled at his craft, and claimed he could fashion any kind of metal into jewelry for his clients.

Jandar's work was in such high demand, he counted [[khazark]] [[Chathin Zurn]] among his clients. In return for his work, she placed [[magic]]al protection over his strongbox and swore her wrath upon any who attempted to rob his shop.

==Personal life==
While he worked at the enclave in Proskur, Jandar's wife [[Yuldra]] was back in Thay living in servitude as a slave. Her sentence was punishment for the crime of attacking a [[wizard]], despite the fact he was robbing her shop. As it was against Thayan law to free slaves, Jandar was extremely frustrated and had little hope of being reunited with his beloved.
