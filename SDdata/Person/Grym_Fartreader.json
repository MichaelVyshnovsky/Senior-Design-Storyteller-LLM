        "History": "Grym's party ventured into a group of dungeons beneath [[Roth√© Valley]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}. After encountering [[duergar]] that accused them of wielding dangerous magic, the group was beset by a cave-in on the fifth day of their expedition. While searching for a way past a set of locked doors, Grym became no more after being engulfed by a [[gelatinous cube]]."
