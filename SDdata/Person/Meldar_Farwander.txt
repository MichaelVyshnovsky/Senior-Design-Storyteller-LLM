'''Meldar Farwander''' was a merchant in the [[Western Heartlands]] around [[1347Â DR]].

==Activities==
Meldar usually traded between [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Daggerford]] leading a caravan.

==History==
Around [[1347 DR]], Meldar's caravan was attacked by bandits near [[The Way Inn]] and his guards were killed. So Meldar stopped at The Way Inn in search of new guards and, with the help of [[Dauravyn Redbeard]], recruited some adventurers who were members of Daggerford's militia.

==Relationship==
Meldar usually traveled with his daughter [[Delora Sharpeye]] and his three loyal animal handlers, [[Ian]], [[Finn]], and [[Dooley]].
