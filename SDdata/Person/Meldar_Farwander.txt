Meldar Farwander was a merchant in the Western Heartlands around 1347 DR.
Meldar usually traded between Baldurs Gate and Daggerford leading a caravan.
Around 1347 DR, Meldars caravan was attacked by bandits near The Way Inn and his guards were killed. So Meldar stopped at The Way Inn in search of new guards and, with the help of Dauravyn Redbeard, recruited some adventurers who were members of Daggerfords militia.
Meldar usually traveled with his daughter Delora Sharpeye and his three loyal animal handlers, Ian, Finn, and Dooley.
