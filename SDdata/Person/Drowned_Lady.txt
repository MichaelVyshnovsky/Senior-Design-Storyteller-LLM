"The Drowned Lady" was the name given to a ghost that haunted the hamlet of Sevenecho in the Vast around 1367–1370 DR.
Locals regularly sighted her on or beside a pool named for her, Ghost Pond, just north of the hamlet. They described her as a beautiful woman.
Tales about her varied however. Some said she was a local woman, the great-grandmother of Beliot Sevenecho, the innkeeper. Others said she was a traveler who flirted with a local lad but then spurned, for which he killed her, likely by drowning her in the pond. The killers identity and family varied according to the tale-teller.
