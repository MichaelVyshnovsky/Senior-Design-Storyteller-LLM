'''"The Drowned Lady"''' was the name given to a [[ghost]] that haunted the [[hamlet]] of [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]] in [[the Vast]] around [[1367 DR|1367]]–[[1370 DR]].

Locals regularly sighted her on or beside a pool named for her, [[Ghost Pond]], just north of the hamlet. They described her as a beautiful woman.

Tales about her varied however. Some said she was a local woman, the great-grandmother of [[Beliot Sevenecho]], the innkeeper. Others said she was a traveler who flirted with a local lad but then spurned, for which he killed her, likely by drowning her in the pond. The killer's identity and family varied according to the tale-teller.
