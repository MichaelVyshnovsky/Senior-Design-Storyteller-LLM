        "mainbody": "Chad was a trapper from the town of Mossbridges, who worked as a trapper alongside his brothers in the late 14 century DR.\nLike his siblings, Chad had shortly-cropped brown hair and brown eyes.\nChad had two older brothers, Golin and Borin. The brothers were acquainted with the retired half-orc fighter named Chester Hearth, who frequented the Golden Goblet Inn in Mossbridges. They considered the fighter to be a talented trapper and thought him to be a fine fellow despite being a half-orc. At one point, Chads and his siblings dog was denied breeding with Chester Hearths moorhound Suzzane.\nWhen the Golden Goblet Inn was opened in the late 14 century DR, after the war in the Vast, the brothers became frequent patrons of Georgios fine establishment, during breaks between trapping beasts and selling the bounty to the Merchant House of Mossbridges. The family even boisterously celebrated Chads 20 birthday at the Goblet with many drinks and toasts."
