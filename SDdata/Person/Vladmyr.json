        "mainbody": "'''Vladmyr''' was a loan shark and the proprietor of a curio shop [[Stop Hole Abbey]] in [[Daggerford]]'s marketplace ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''He is months behind on his debt. Were I to allow this to continue it would soil my reputation. Surely you understand how men in my line of work must keep appearances.''|Vladmyr on sending thugs to Davey Halloran's father}}",
        "Description": "Vladmyr had a cold and dispassionate face and dressed in all black.",
        "Possessions": "Vladmyr was the sole owner of the Stop Hole Abbey, a curio and collectibles store that rivaled the similar establishments in bigger cities like [[Waterdeep]].\n\nVladmyr employed muscle to help convincing his clients who were late one they payments. The hired thugs often left them beaten half to death.",
        "Relationships": "Vladmyr had a bitter rivalry with a fellow curio store owner form [[Gillian's Hill]], [[Torleth Mindulspeer]].\n\nVladmyr was a strict and cruel loan shark who took advantage of many individuals in need, like [[Davey Halloran]] and his gambling  addict father.\n\nHe had solid working relationship with the militiamen of Daggerford, which gave Vlad confidence and security to continue operating his loaning business.",
        "History": "At some point before [[1372 DR]], Vladmyr came across a long-abandoned old abby that once belonged to the [[Old Order]]. He reconstructed the building to open the store that would house his collection of rare oddities.\n\nVladmyr's more profitable side-business was loaning coin. He was extremely strict when the payback time arrived and often threatened his clients with being drowned in [[Delimbiyr River]]. One notorious incident that involved Vladmyr's loan business involved a certain narcissistic and dimwitted sculptor from [[Gillian's Hill]], [[Yujist Glemp]]. The aspiring artist used the loan to purchase [[gold]] to make a casting of himself and use it as a collateral. However what he purchased was [[pyrite]]. In terror of Vladmyr's collectors, Yujist skipped the city, leaving only the \"[[Barrels of Bamboozle]]\" for the furious loan shark to find.\n\nOne more of these unfortunate deals was made with Davey Halloran's father, to elevate his gambling debts. The money was gambled away and the old man Halloran was facing a wet death. His son Davey was attempting to scrounge some money at the [[Black Stone Inn]] by pickpocketing unsuccessfully. Instead, the gangly youth ran into the adventurers, later known and the heroes of Daggerford. They promised the troubled young man to talk to Vladmyr to try and save the father's life.\n\nEven though Halloran senior's debt of 500 [[gp]] was hefty, Vlad was willing to forgive it in exchange for a little task outside of the rule of law. The loan shark requested the return of an expensive and rare painting that he claimed was stole from him by his competitor and bitter rival, [[Torleth Mindulspeer]] of Gillian's Hill. The painting was called ''[[Greatshout as a Young Man]]'', the portrait of Duke [[Pwyll Daggerford]]. Vlad claimed the stolen painting was about to be auctioned off to one of the local nobleman, and had to be stolen and replaced with a fake.\n\nWhen the painting was stolen, the auction appraisers detected the false authenticity and it damaged the competitor's reputation greatly. However, that was not the only task Vlad needed performed. With Davey Halloran's father being debt free, the curio dealer offered a paying job to the Hero of Daggerford. Vladmyr had a rare collection of artifacts transported up the [[Trade Way]] with the caravan driver being dimwitted enough to forget to latch the wagon's doors. The artifacts deface scattered all over from [[Bowshot]] to Daggerford. Most items were recovered apart from three, that were supposedly lost somewhere around Gillian's Hill and [[Liam's Hold]]. The frost item was a rare sheet music from [[Silverymoon Conservatory]] (''[[The Song of Breaking]]''), an [[Uthgardt]] burial totem (''[[Wrath of the Blue Bearâ€Ž]]''), and a [[gold|gild]]ed chalice from the [[Chult]]an city of [[Mezro]] (''[[Mazewalker chalice]]''). Vladmyr offered a generous finder's fee of 2,000 gp for the three unique items."
