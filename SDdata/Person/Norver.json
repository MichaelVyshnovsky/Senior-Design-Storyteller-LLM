        "mainbody": "'''Norver''' was a cook and a member of the crew led by Pirate King [[Bartholomew Blackdagger]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He along with a few of his comrades were able to avoid the horrific curse that transformed Blackdagger and his loyalists into horrifying [[undead]], thanks to their mutinous actions in the face of his ever-growing tyrannical control.\n\n{{Quote|I wouldn't like to think of what would have happened if they'd found us. There are many fates worse than death, and Bartholomew Blackdagger knows them all.}}",
        "Personality": "Due to the many years he spent merely surviving with scant few friends and companions, Norver was a fearful man that was greatly appreciate of what goodness he encountered in life. He showed profound bravery when given the opportunity, proving that his spirit had not been entirely broken.",
        "History": "After Blackdagger and his pirates took control of [[Pirates' Skyhold]] and established [[Skull Fortress]] in the midâ€“15{{th}} century, the self-styled Pirate King became too much of a despot for some of his followers. Norver and other like-minded crew members mutinied against their former friends, actions that were met with swift violence. Only Norver and a small number of allies managed to escape into the nearby [[Vilebog]] swamp. There they lived for decades surviving off the land, their numbers gradually becoming fewer as they died from lack of food, disease, or attacks at the hands of the resident [[lizardfolk]].\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, less than ten of the mutineers remained alive in the swamps of Pirates' Skyhold. Their salvation appeared to Norver in the form of an [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|adventurer]] working for the [[Company Yargo]], which had flown up to the [[earthmote]] aboard their flagship ''[[Buccaneer's Tear]]''. Norver guided the adventurer across the Blackdagger pirates' stronghold, helping them rescue some fellow mutineers that had been captured and destroy some of the [[ballista]]e that would prevent escape by [[skyship]]. Norver provided directions for the adventurer and their [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|companions]] to the [[Pirate King's Retreat]], the resting place of the undead Bartholomew Blackdagger and his last remaining ship, the ''[[Black Scourge]]''.\n\nFor all his efforts, Captain [[Shil Yargo]] provided passage off Pirates' Skyhold for Norver and the mutineers. By his own admission he had never heard sweeter words than that promise shared to him by his adventurer ally."
