King '''Coram II''' of [[House Tethyr|House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul]] was the sixth king of the [[Lions' Dynasty]] of [[Tethyr]].

==Relationships==
Coram II was the second-oldest grandson of King [[Coram I]].<ref group="note">The source actually states that he was the fifth son. This article assumes that it was intended for him to be the fifth ''child'', since he is stated to be the second grandson of [[Coram I]] elsewhere, and it is more likely for him to be crowned king as the second grandson than as the fifth. and an older brother named [[Alemander I]], who would also later be king.

==History==
Coram was born in the [[1050 DR|Year of the Keening Gale, 1050 DR]]. In that same year, his family was traveling with a caravan when they were attacked by a group of three [[wereboar]]s. His father Natan died saving all of them.

Since his father was dead, Coram II was crowned king in only his fifteenth year ([[1065 DR]]) at the death of his grandfather Coram I.

After a short reign of only five years for King Coram, [[Teremir Bormul II|Teremir Bormul]] started a coup against him. In the month of [[Kythorn]], after a personal duel, Coram II was killed by Teremir, who took the throne as Teremir II and restored the [[Queens' Dynasty|dynasty]] of his great-grandfather. Coram's brother Alemander would avenge his death before a year had passed.

==Rumors and Legends==
Coram II was considered unlucky in Tethyr, since he was a fifth child. The fact that he died in the fifth year of his reign was thought to confirm this.
