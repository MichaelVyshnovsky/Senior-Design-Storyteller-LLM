'''Rathan Thentraver''' ({{Pronounce|rath|AN|_|then|TRAH|var|refs=}}) was a [[human]] [[cleric]] of [[Tymora]] and a member of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Personality==
He appreciated feasting and drinking very much and suffered from hangovers from time to time, though he did not complain about them. His trust in the Lady Luck made him a fearless man who preferred to act instead of thinking issues over.

==Description==
While he was overweight and rather unattractive, Rathan had a jovial and brutally honest personality.

==Relationships==
Rathan's best friend was fellow [[adventurer]] [[Torm (adventurer)|Torm]], a thief.

==Possessions==
The priest wielded a [[mace]] and [[shield]] in battle, the latter of which could hold onto his ''[[holy symbol]]''.<ref>

He also had a ''[[ring of the ram]]'', which he recovered after a battle with some [[wizard]]s of the [[Zhentarim]].

==History==
Born to [[Rathur Thentraver|Rathur]] and [[Ulla Thentraver]], Rathan lost his parents at an early age to [[cholera]], and was thrust into the [[church of Tymora]] by his greedy uncles in an effort to lay claim upon his family's wealth. Rathan was "officially" assigned to the temple in [[Arabel]], by superior priest [[Segril]], to spread the faith of Tymora among the travelers and adventurers who may need a little luck in their perilous journeys, though in all likelihood it was just to rid himself of the boisterous drunkard.

In [[1348 DR]], Rathan had a chance meeting with the [[Knights of Myth Drannor|Swords of Eveningstar]], who had been teleported to Arabel by a dungeon trap.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Swords of Eveningstar}} Shortly thereafter, he wandered to the [[Dalelands]] where he joined the Swords, who by then had renamed themselves the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]].
