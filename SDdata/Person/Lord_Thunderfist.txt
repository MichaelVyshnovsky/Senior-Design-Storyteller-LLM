'''Lord Thunderfist''' was a [[Waterdeep|Whaterdevian]] noble in the late 14{{th}} century DR.

==Possessions==
Lord Thunderfist had a small army of private guards around him at all times that obeyed his every word.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], a [[gnome]] "professional treasure hunter" [[Purfbin Doogrick]] ran into Lord Thunderfist at one of Waterdeep's busy markets. The little rogue ended with the noble's purse in his possession but was caught by the angry lord. Thunderfist threatened Purfbin with hanging even though the gnome tried to convince the noble his purse simply fell on him. Lord Thunderfist was not convinced, but the gnome managed to escape and hopped onto a merchant caravan heading to [[Daggerford]], escaping the law.
