'''Lila''' was a traveling musician, performer, and a [[bard]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

{{quote|''Some new faces in town lately. Could be good for us.''|Lila}}

==Description==
Lila was a short and slender [[elf|elven]] woman with large brown and chestnut braided hair. She wore a green performer's garb. She was a cold and aloof demeanor that strangely contrasted her vocation.

==History==
In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, Lila, a [[flute|flautist]], was a part of a [[rogue|roguish]] band of traveling performers that included [[Venn]] who played a [[lute]], [[William (Crossroad Keep)|William]] – a [[tambourin]]ist, and the troupe's leader, a flaming dancer named [[Azahr]]. Lila and the band spent some time performing at the [[Crossroad Keep]] as it was being reinvigorated by trade and commerce after a devastating [[Shadow War]]. The band's leader was happy to be making [[coin]] once again and planned on staying at the keep for a little while. However, that time was cut short after Azahr sole a precious artifact – ''[[Gauntlets of Ironfist]],'' from the keep's seneschal. Lila accompanied her bandmates to Azahr's cabin hideout in the [[Neverwinter Wood]]. [[Khelgar Ironfist]] sent a group of adventurers to retrieve the precious stolen magic item; a brawl was ensured.
