Marimmar, also known as Marimmar the Magnificent, was the wizard master of the young Narm Tamaraith.
Marimmar was a good but slow magic teacher who over-estimated his powers. At one point, he started tutoring the young Narm in the magic arts.
In 1357 DR, he decided against all prudence to travel to the ruined Myth Drannor to acquire magical treasure but Marimmar was quickly killed by the devils there.
