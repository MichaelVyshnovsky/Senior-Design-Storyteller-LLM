'''Walnut Dankgrass''' was an [[elven]] [[druid]] who served as [[documancer]] for the [["C" Team]] of the [[adventurer|adventuring]] company [[Acquisitions Incorporated]].

==Personality==
Strongly opposed to urban civilization, Walnut sought to undermine citied life from within. Distrustful of most people who did not mirror her matriarchal values, Walnut had a rigid conviction that her beliefs were right and true, and would see them through to the bitter end.

==Abilities==
She was an accomplished druid, capable of assuming the ''[[wild shape]]'' of a [[dire wolf]].

==Possessions==
She wielded the [[magic]] [[scimitar]] ''[[Foremother]]'' in combat.

==History==
Walnut was born into the [[Enclave Panax Anima]] in [[Kryptgarden Forest]], an all-female clan dedicated to protecting the forest and serving [[Mielikki]]. It could not last, however; Walnut's clan was destroyed by agents of "civilization", leaving her as one of the few survivors. Although possessed of an antipathy toward anything urban, Walnut eventually made her way to the city and was recruited into Acquisitions Incorporated as a documancer.
