Lord '''Grodoveth''' was a nobleman of [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] who served as an envoy of the crown. Secretly, he was also a member of the [[Iron Throne]] mercantile organization and part of a spy ring based in [[Ghars]].

==Description==
He was tall, with a big, muscular build. For official duties, he wore a [[cloak]] displaying a royal crest. He was left-handed.<ref>

==Personality==
Grodoveth was known to have quite a short temper. For example, while in Ghars, he had the local tailor sew the crest back on his cloak, but the hungover man did the job a little crooked and, enraged, Grodoveth nearly drew his sword on him.

He was also rather lecherous, with a predatory eye for beautiful women. Though he attempted subtlety, he lacked tact and would make advances that were unwelcome or even offensive.

==Relationships==
He was the husband of [[Beatrice]], who was a cousin of King [[Azoun IV]], which made Grodoveth a relative to the crown as well.

Grodoveth was a former student and later friend of [[Tobald]]. Later in life, they often played [[chess (game)|chess]] together. However, Benelaius suspected they had a deeper bond forged from them both having known disgrace and resenting their superiors, which led to their spying and betrayal of their kingdom.

==Activities==
As envoy, it was Grodoveth's duty to carry news and messages to King Azoun IV in [[Suzail]] and to Lord [[Sarp Redbeard]] in Wheloon, who was his supervisor. This involved much hard riding between all the towns of Cormyr's southeast, from the [[Way of the Manticore]] to [[Thunderstone]] and from the [[Wyvernwater]] to the [[Vast Swamp]], with the town of Ghars near the center.

In this capacity, Grodoveth acquired much economic data from across southeast Cormyr, information that was coveted by the Iron Throne. Thus, while in Ghars, he related this information to fellow Iron Throne member Mayor Tobald and to their recruit, a local blacksmith's assistant named [[Dovo]]. Dovo's task was to go out at nights to the edge of the [[Vast Swamp]] and signal coded messages to another, unnamed agent within or beyond the swamp in [[Sembia]]. To allay suspicion, Grodoveth suggested that Dovo disguise himself as the ghost of the bandit chieftain [[Fastred]]; this scared off those who saw him, and if caught he could pass it off as just a prank. Grodoveth was too high profile to be caught doing this himself. They used the [[Swamp Rat]] tavern outside town as their base of operations for their signaling and fake ghost sightings. Worse still, Grodoveth and Tobald both received from the Iron Throne [[vial]]s of [[blackweed]] meant to [[poison]] the whole town and assassinate the Grand Council of the [[Merchants' Guild]] during their meeting in Ghars on [[Eleint 19]] in 1367 DR, marking them both as would-be mass murderers as well.

==History==
As a young man, Grodoveth studied at the [[University of Suzail]], where he was a student of Tobald, who was later dismissed from his position for unknown reasons.

Although a relative of the king, Grodoveth was said to have committed a wanton indiscretion (rumored to involve a [[prostitute]] in a Suzail tavern) that not only dishonored himself but risked embarrassing the throne. With only his family connections protecting him, Azoun had him effectively exiled from the city by making him a lowly envoy. On these occasions, Grodoveth presumably brought Tobald into the Iron Throne and the spy ring as well, and local man Dovo, who was probably duped with a false story of serving Cormyrean agents or smugglers and tempted with the money and the chance to frighten the town.

While on his journeys, Grodoveth started visiting the [[Ghars library]] in [[Tarsakh]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, where he researched the Vast Swamp and the legends of the bandit chieftain Fastred. He would come in occasionally over the following months for this purpose. These legends gave him the idea of disguising Dovo as Fastred's ghost to cover up his signaling.

But by mid-[[Eleint]], Dovo had become a problem, overstepping his place and acting too familiar with the mayor and royal envoy. He asked too many annoying questions of the envoy at [[Aunsible Durn's smithy]] and, when Dovo pulled too hard whilst leading his horse and causing it to stumble, Grodoveth hit him, knocking him to the ground, before giving him a veiled warning. But after their co-conspirator Dovo's more public misbehavior and cocky hints at his secret activities, Grodoveth and Tobald resolved to be rid of him before he risked giving them and their spying away. Later that night, while Dovo was dressed up as a ghost and signaling out in the swamp, Grodoveth met him, took his [[axe]], and beheaded him with it, before taking his broken [[bullseye lantern]] to hide what the ghost was actually doing, though some pieces remained to give enough of a clue as to what was really going on. Either Grodoveth or Tobald also hid Dovo's clothes at the Bold Bard to further divert attention from their activities around the Swamp Rat.

The [[Eleint 17|next day]], Grodoveth visited the Ghars library again for more research into legends of Fastred's tomb. There, [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]], who was investigating on behalf of retired [[War Wizard]] [[Benelaius]], asked him if he knew anything of brigands who might've murdered Dovo, but Grodoveth impatiently rebuffed him. That evening, Grodoveth and Tobald met in the Bold Bard again,<ref> but, after a surprise [[mouse]] outbreak, they relocated to the Swamp Rat.<ref> Grodoveth elected to spend the night there,<ref> ostensibly to save himself a journey when he headed south in the morning. Instead, during the night, he secretly went into the Vast Swamp to find Fastred's tomb and the treasure said to lie within. He was successful and went inside, but was swiftly and bloody beheaded by Fastred's [[axe]], which had been set as a trap at the entrance.

The open tomb and Grodoveth's body were discovered the [[Eleint 18|following morning]] by the [[gnome]] peat-cutter [[Darvik]], who alerted Captain [[Flim]] of the [[Purple Dragon]]s. Flim, Jasper, and War Wizard [[Lindavar]] investigated the crime scene. Later, Royal Magician [[Vangerdahast]] ordered Benelaius to investigate and that Captain Flim should immediately execute the killer. Benelaius speculated Vangerdahast had done this to avoid controversy because of Grodoveth's familial relation to Azoun. When Benelaius revealed the spy ring to townsfolk on [[Eleint 21]], he blamed Tobald for Dovo's and Grodoveth's deaths and covered up Grodoveth's involvement to protect the honor of the Cormyrean crown. Instead, he painted Grodoveth as bravely seeking to expose the spies until he was betrayed and murdered.
