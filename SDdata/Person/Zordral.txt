'''Zordral''' was an evil [[human]] [[conjurer]] who was enemies with the witch [[Bentha]].

==History==
In [[1368 DR]], he held Bentha hostage in a tent in the [[Nashkel]] carnival. He insisted that she must die or she would poison the children of the town, kill the livestock, and seduce the men. He had the power to kill her with a single word, "Arashaka", but was stopped from doing so by the arrival of [[Gorion's Ward]] and party. Zordral died in the fight.
