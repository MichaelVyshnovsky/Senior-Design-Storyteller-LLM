Zordral was an evil human conjurer who was enemies with the witch Bentha.
In 1368 DR, he held Bentha hostage in a tent in the Nashkel carnival. He insisted that she must die or she would poison the children of the town, kill the livestock, and seduce the men. He had the power to kill her with a single word, "Arashaka", but was stopped from doing so by the arrival of Gorions Ward and party. Zordral died in the fight.
