'''Jhaniloth Puiral''' was a lich and member of the [[Twisted Rune]]. Before that, she was a wizardess of [[Silverymoon]].

==Background==
Jhaniloth had a hatred for [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] after he foiled a number of her plots and exiled her from [[Silverymoon]], [[Secomber]] and [[Waterdeep]]. She joined forces with fellow Twisted Rune member [[Priamon "Frostrune" Rakesk]] in order to form a plot to take over the [[Undermountain]] in order to get back at Khelben.

In [[1330 DR]], while in her lair, Jhaniloth was destroyed by Prince [[Rythan]] of [[Tethyr]].
