Jhaniloth Puiral was a lich and member of the Twisted Rune. Before that, she was a wizardess of Silverymoon.
Jhaniloth had a hatred for Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun after he foiled a number of her plots and exiled her from Silverymoon, Secomber and Waterdeep. She joined forces with fellow Twisted Rune member Priamon "Frostrune" Rakesk in order to form a plot to take over the Undermountain in order to get back at Khelben.
In 1330 DR, while in her lair, Jhaniloth was destroyed by Prince Rythan of Tethyr.
