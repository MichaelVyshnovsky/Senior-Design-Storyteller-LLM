        "mainbody": "'''Eschar''' was a powerful [[demon]] bound by the [[Nar demonbinder]]s of [[Narfell]] beneath [[Dun-Tharos]] to guard the [[Sighing Vault]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|195-200|19}}",
        "Description": "Eschar resembled an immense [[ogre]] with red skin and a crown of horns. He spoke with a brutish, hollow voice. His skin was scaled, and his horns radiated with fiendish witchlight; his body pulsed with evil power.",
        "Personality": "Unlike other demons, Eschar actually relished the conditions of his binding. He was still bloodthirsty, ferocious, and proud.",
        "Abilities": "Eschar was mainly a physical fighter, swinging fists and clawed feet. He commanded other demons, being able to freeze even the servants of the [[Queen Abiding]] by commanding them. He was also capable of teleporting himself from place to place, even outside of the Sighing Vault from time to time.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|224-225|23}}",
        "Activities": "Until 1373 DR, Eschar guarded the [[Sighing Vault]] in Dun-Tharos, particularly from the servants of the [[Queen Abiding]], but he did not do so very closely. He remained in Dun-Tharos after it was breached.",
        "History": "Eschar was originally bound by the Nar to guard the Sighing Vault. At one point, after the [[Rotting Man]] discarded the Queen Abiding's token of control, Eschar took it to the Sighing Vault.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Eschar fought [[Marrec]] and his party to prevent them from entering the Sighing Vault.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|237-239|25}}\n\nHowever, Eschar somehow managed to survive and remained in Dun-Tharos as of {{yearlink|1479}}.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|135}}",
        "Relationships": "Other demons similar to Eschar, but smaller and misshapen, were in Dun-Tharos close to his location.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|190-193|19}}"
