'''Ender Sai''' was an [[elven]] spy who was tasked with investigating the [[iron crisis]] that afflicted the [[Sword Coast]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Ender began investigating the activities of the [[Iron Throne]]. Some time after he began, Endar was apprehended by the [[bandit]] leader [[Tazok]]. He made the logical conclusion that the two incidents were linked.

During his confinement, Ender learned that Tazok was making regular trips to the [[Cloak Wood]] forest and believed that to be the next step in learning the truth behind the iron crisis.
