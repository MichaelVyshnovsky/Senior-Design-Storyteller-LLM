'''Proskler''' ({{Pronounce|PROS|kler|refs={{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|40}}}}) was a member of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]] in [[Mulmaster]].{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|7}}

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], while posing as a strange adept of [[Talos]], Proskler helped the relatives of [[Maude Kron]] to devise a plot against Cloak [[Nelvon deJun]] by kidnapping his younger brother, [[Larch deJun]]. They seized him at a great party in the [[Astrid Saj]] villa{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|7-8}} and took him to a nearby tower to enact a revenge rite. In truth, Proskler wanted to summon some [[hippogriff]]s from the [[Elemental Plane of Air]], using the lives of all present at the rite. Eventually, an adventuring party hired by Nelvon foiled his plan and Proskler died.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|10-11}}
