Mattrim "Threestrings" Mereg () was a bard and Harper spy at the Yawning Portal in 1492 DR.
Mattrim hid his true elevated skills as a musician to maintain a low profile. He resided in the inn and used all his afternoons and evenings to spy upon Zhentarim agents and collect information about others possible troublemakers.
In 1492 DR,  Mattrim befriended the barmaid Bonnie and, after discovering her secret, decided to help her.
Some time later, Mattrim hired adventurers to take a pouch of gold and deliver it to Calal Claddani, a female half-drow located in Skullport, in exchange for her saving a wounded Harper agent.
