        "mainbody": "Kyrie was a well-known human adventurer who operated along the Sword Coast.\nShe was clad entirely in black clothing. Her long mane of hair reached down to her legs, framing her symmetrical and light-skinned features.\nKyrie owned a very potent magical suit of leather armor. She carried an enchanted short sword, and wore a cloak of displacement.\nKnown as a hero among the roguish types of the Sword Coast, Kyrie was celebrated as a thief who preyed on the rich, but also as a daring adventurer who went on solo treks into the Undermountain. She vanished one day, with rumors saying she had fallen in love and eloped with a sailor from Saerloon."
