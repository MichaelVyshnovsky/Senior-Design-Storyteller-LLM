        "mainbody": "Lauzoril, otherwise known as the Zulkir of Charm and Enchantment, was one of the eight leaders of the Red Wizards of Thay.\nLauzoril stood about  and weighed around roughly . He had blond hair with grey streaks and green eyes. By the time he was in his late 40s he was still considered by others to have a rather handsome and distinguished appearance.\nLaurozil was always very charming to anyone he talks to. Even when he seemed to be about to order ones immediate execution, he was charming. People he had ordered slain in their presence went to the executioner smiling. He was very fond of creating sentient, enchanted weapons that would be loyal to him and sow discord among his enemies.\nLauzoril was known to possess a carpet of flying, the whip variant of an ebon lash, a Ring of protection +4, and a stone horse figurine of wondrous power. Though his most unique possessions were a sentient, wavy-bladed dagger known as Shazzelurt\nShazzelurt could detect magic within a  radius, locate objects within a  radius, and heal its wielder once per day. When unsheathed it could also read magic and detect secret doors within a  radius at the wielders will. Any bard that was struck by the blade was likely to disintegrate. In addition to all these magical effects, Shazzelurt was capable of speaking in Common, Gnoll, and the Thayan dialect.\nLauzoril openly opposed the ruler of Szass Tam. He actively sought some magical means by which he could wrest control away from the lich. Another zulkir, Nevron, was allied with him in this endeavor.\nHe held great indifference towards Thayan enclaves, mainly because they rarely offered the sort of magic he was interested in. Despite his hatred of them, Lauzoril had a healthy respect for the Harpers in regards to what they were capable of accomplishing.\nLauzoril was not known outside of Thay as a Zulkir, however his position as a leader of the Imperialist party had garnered the attention of the Harpers and in turn attracted Lauzoril to them. Lauzoril had no liking for the meddling Harpers and spent much of his time scheming to destroy them.\nOne of his schemes to destroy the Harpers led him to to create the weapon Shazzellim. So pleased was Lauzoril with the weapon that he soon after went on to make another sentient weapon, the dagger Shazzelurt. He sent Shazzelim with the then-captain of the Thayan gaurds, Ahlzul, to slay the prominent Harper ranger Dove Falconhand. However, Ahlzul mistakenly slayed the knight Jasilmer and was cut down in turn. In the years that followed the scimitar would change hands many times.\nIn the mid-14 century DR, Lauzoril opposed the more blunt approach to conquest his allies were taking &mdash the invasion of neighboring lands &mdash and often sought to undermine their plans. This was because he felt that their approach to conquest would serve only to paint Thay as a serious threat to outside organizations like the Harpers, who would then in turn try to make conceited efforts to destroy them.\nHis own master plan for conquering the rest of the Realms during that period was to assassinate the rulers and major players of other lands. Once the followers of those assassinated were uncertain and demoralized, he planned to make his move.\nBetween 1367 and 1369 DR Lauzoril survived five assassination attempts.\nBy 1372 DR, Lauzoril had yet to sponsor any Thayan enclave. Around that time he was considering a number of difference by which to sabotage or spread rumors about them in order to hamper their effiency, as he wanted to avoid any one faction from gaining too much power."
