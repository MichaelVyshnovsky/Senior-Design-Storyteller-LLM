        "mainbody": "'''Lauzoril''', otherwise known as the [[Zulkir]] of [[Charm]] and [[Enchantment]], was one of the eight leaders of the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]].",
        "Description": "Lauzoril stood about {{SI|5'9\"|ft-in}} and weighed around roughly {{SI|145|lbs|k}}. He had blond hair with grey streaks and green eyes. By the time he was in his late 40's he was still considered by others to have a rather handsome and distinguished appearance.",
        "Personality": "Laurozil was always very charming to anyone he talks to. Even when he seemed to be about to order one's immediate execution, he was charming. People he had ordered slain in their presence went to the executioner smiling. He was very fond of creating [[sentient item|sentient]], [[item enchantment|enchanted]] weapons that would be loyal to him and sow discord among his enemies.",
        "Possessions": "Lauzoril was known to possess a ''[[carpet of flying]]'', the [[whip]] variant of an ''[[ebon lash]]'', a ''[[Ring of protection]] +4'', and a ''stone horse [[figurine of wondrous power]]''. Though his most unique possessions were a sentient, wavy-bladed [[dagger]] known as ''[[Shazzelurt]]''\n\n''Shazzelurt'' could ''[[detect magic]]'' within a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} radius, ''[[locate object]]s'' within a {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} radius, and ''[[heal]]'' its wielder once per day. When unsheathed it could also ''[[read magic]]'' and ''[[detect secret doors]]'' within a {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} radius at the wielder's will. Any [[bard]] that was struck by the blade was likely to ''[[disintegrate]]''. In addition to all these magical effects, ''Shazzelurt'' was capable of speaking in [[Common]], [[Gnoll language|Gnoll]], and the Thayan dialect.",
        "Relationships": "Lauzoril openly opposed the ruler of [[Szass Tam]]. He actively sought some magical means by which he could wrest control away from the [[lich]]. Another zulkir, [[Nevron]], was allied with him in this endeavor.\n\nHe held great indifference towards Thayan enclaves, mainly because they rarely offered the sort of [[magic]] he was interested in. Despite his hatred of them, Lauzoril had a healthy respect for the Harpers in regards to what they were capable of accomplishing.",
        "History": "Lauzoril was not known outside of Thay as a Zulkir, however his position as a leader of the Imperialist party had garnered the attention of the [[Harpers]] and in turn attracted Lauzoril to them. Lauzoril had no liking for the meddling Harpers and spent much of his time scheming to destroy them.\n\nOne of his schemes to destroy the Harpers led him to to create the weapon ''Shazzellim''. So pleased was Lauzoril with the weapon that he soon after went on to make another sentient weapon, the dagger ''Shazzelurt''. He sent ''Shazzelim'' with the then-captain of the Thayan gaurds, [[Ahlzul]], to slay the prominent Harper [[ranger]] [[Dove Falconhand]]. However, Ahlzul mistakenly slayed the [[knight]] [[Jasilmer]] and was cut down in turn. In the years that followed the scimitar would change hands many times.\n\nIn the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], Lauzoril opposed the more blunt approach to conquest his allies were taking &mdash; the invasion of neighboring lands &mdash; and often sought to undermine their plans. This was because he felt that their approach to conquest would serve only to paint Thay as a serious threat to outside organizations like the Harpers, who would then in turn try to make conceited efforts to destroy them.\n\nHis own master plan for conquering the rest of the Realms during that period was to assassinate the rulers and major players of other lands. Once the followers of those assassinated were uncertain and demoralized, he planned to make his move.\n\nBetween [[1367 DR|1367]] and [[1369 DR]] Lauzoril survived five assassination attempts.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], Lauzoril had yet to sponsor any [[Thayan enclave]]. Around that time he was considering a number of difference by which to sabotage or spread rumors about them in order to hamper their effiency, as he wanted to avoid any one faction from gaining too much power."
