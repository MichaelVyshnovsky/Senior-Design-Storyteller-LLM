He no longer hated and feared all non-beholderkin, but instead came to identify with and imitate them, thinking of himself as a [[humanoid]]. As he circulated in the criminal elements of Underdark criminal society, he took up the personality of a thuggish goon and became crude, crass, arrogant, and generally offensive to be around.

        "Description": "Vikhrumn Coll was a fairly typical beholder in form, possessed of a {{SIAdj|5|ft|long=yes|adj=wide}} spherical body and gray, pebbly skin. He had a distinctive large scar (claimed to be from fighting an [[aboleth]]) that cut diagonally from near an eyestalk on top of his body, across his central eye, and down to his underside, winning him the hated nickname \"Scarhead\". He was usually seen chomping a [[cigar]] and wearing an oversized fedora, and ''[[levitate]]d'' a trenchcoat, gloves, and shoes below his body to imitate a humanoid form, a disguise he believed was perfect.",

        "Possessions": "Aside from his fedora, trenchcoat, gloves, and shoes, 100 Gold possessed little of interest besides his cigars, which were so noxious nearby people could be incapacitated if they were exposed to the smoke.",
        "Relationships": "Vikhrumn Coll didn't really have any friends besides [[Brikhalna Ipprszhen]] and was typically avoided by other criminals for his foul personality and odor, though his quick lethality meant they they appeased and accommodated him if he demanded their company. He found employment with crime lords such as [[Felyndiira Shi'narrvha]], who appreciated his services even if they didn't like him.",
        "History": "[[File:Underdark Gangsters.png|thumb|280px|''100 Gold meeting up with the gang at the [[Think Easy]].'']]\nVikhrumn Coll was once the servant of a hive mother in one of the Underdark's largest beholder cities, said to be the apple of his master's eyes. He suffered a near-lethal head wound during a war against another city, but managed to survive with a gruesome scar and a debilitating brain injury. Unable to meet even the loose standards of sanity found in a beholder hive, the hive mother exiled him to wander the Underdark, where he was found by the enterprising and friendly [[mind flayer]] Brikhalna Ipprszhen. Brikhalna took him into the ranks of hired thugs and killers, and from that point on the beholder performed hits for 100 [[gold piece]]s eachâ€”earning him his new name."
