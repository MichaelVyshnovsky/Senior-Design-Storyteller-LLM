        "mainbody": "Duvon Trarach, later known as Avinvesa Fey, was a drow weapon master in Menzoberranzan in the early 11 century DR.\nDuvon hailed from House Trarach, a small house.\nIn the , Duvon, together with Matron Mother Hauzz Trarach and his sister Daungelina Trarach, planned an attack on House Simfray. The first priestess reassured Hauzz about the wizards they had hired from House Xorlarrin and Duvon about the presumably very talented Simfray weapon master Zaknafein.\nDuring the attack, Daungelina and Duvon confronted Zaknafein but the enemy weapon master easily defeated Duvon and later, with a few quick actions, also killed Daungelina. Duvon was on the verge of being killed by his giant lizard mount when Jarlaxle saved and sedated him.\nAfterward, with Duvons blessing, Jarlaxle sold him to House Fey-Branche to be their new weapon master until one of the children of Matron Byrtyn Fey proved adept at the job. He remained in that position until 1118 DR.\nHowever, Duvon was still resentful of Zaknafein and Matron Byrtyn and, that year, her daughter Affyn Fey started to plot Zaks death using Duvon. A few days later, Duvon tried to kill Zaknafein inside the Oozing Myconid, with the support of Harbondair Trarach, but was stopped by Jarlaxle, who proposed to set up a regular duel soon.\nOn the day of the duel, which had attracted many noble gamblers, Duvon had his great fight with Zak. However, thanks to a little support from Jarlaxle, Zaknafein ultimately gained supremacy and Duvon surrendered. After the defeat, Jarlaxle traded with Matron Byrtyn to have Duvon dismissed by House Fey-Branche and, following a sojourn in Ched Nasad in the , he formally joined Bregan Daerthe."
