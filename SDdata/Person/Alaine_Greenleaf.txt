'''Alaine Greenleaf''' was an [[elf|elven]] hero who lived some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Alaine was believed to be the last wielder of the [[longsword]] called ''[[The Equalizer]]'', sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. She and the sword were lost during an expedition to the [[Underdark]], where the ''The Equalizer'' was broken in three and remained lost until 1369 DR.
