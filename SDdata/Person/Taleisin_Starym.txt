'''Taleisin Starym''' was a clan elder and Lord Protector of the [[Starym]] [[elven]] clan, uncle by marriage of [[Ysmyrl'da Starym]]. He was a [[bladesinger]] and former member of the [[Akh'Velahr]] as an ''aryk&#233;rym'' cavalry. Taleisin, along with the clan heir [[Josidiah Starym]] were elves of great honour, and after the clan broke ties with the [[Coronal]] and most abandoned [[Myth Drannor]], these two rebuilt the reputation of the family.
