Taleisin Starym was a clan elder and Lord Protector of the Starym elven clan, uncle by marriage of Ysmyrlda Starym. He was a bladesinger and former member of the AkhVelahr as an aryk&#233rym cavalry. Taleisin, along with the clan heir Josidiah Starym were elves of great honour, and after the clan broke ties with the Coronal and most abandoned Myth Drannor, these two rebuilt the reputation of the family.
