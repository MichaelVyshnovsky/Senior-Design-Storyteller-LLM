Brindlor Zidorion was a deathsinger from Ched Nasad.
Brindlor wore fine clothes and gems. He had long hair, which he wore in many braids. In 1361 DR, Gorlist placed the Ruby of Chissentra, a scrying gem, in his forehead at the behest of priestess Shakti Hunzrin and it appeared almost like a third eye.
As a deathsinger,A deathsinger appears to be a type of bard that utilizes necromantic magic. Brindlor was able to control the dead through his song, which sounded as a keening wail with the harsh, irregular rhythm of drow chant.
In 1361 DR, Brindlor was hired by Gorlist to help with and record the pursuit of Liriel Baenre in revenge for her killing of Nisstyre, Gorlists father. Gorlist, pressed upon his forehead the ruby Nisstyre previously had, allowing direct communication with Shakti, which proved to be the cause of his death when he was killed in Gorlists assault upon Liriel in Rashemen, as Liriel used the gem as a somatic component for a spell causing him to burst in an explosion of gore and viscera.
