Wilaver Chandler was an elder member of the extended Chandler family in the mid-1480s DR, who lived together in the Midler farmhouse near Eveningstar.
Wilaver was an older man with long white hair.
Wilaver was the father of Jandove and Graven, and husband of Caryn.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, the drow forces of Vicala Szind attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the Thread of the Weave. Unknown to the drow, the houseservant Maisby had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of Purple Dragons and then a team of adventurers to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.
Wilaver was kept in the cellar with his wife Caryn and grandson Thoben, guarded by drow warriors until their fate was decided.
