'''Torin Nomerthal''' was a First Lord of [[Hillsfar]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/State of Hillsfar|1,4}}{{Cite adventurers league/Hillsfar Reclaimed}} He was a human who reinstated the city's Great Laws of Trade and Humanity in [[1487 DR]].

He was head of a powerful family, known to be outwardly friendly, but secretly shrewd and cunning.
 
==Relationships==
Torin governed the city with the aid of Chancellor [[Garos Daunger]] the Just, Seneschal [[Torgrave Needlebaum]], Chamberlain: [[Malkyn Grenefeld]], and his former advisor, [[Davon Malaeda]].

Torin was briefly betrothed to Davon's twin sister, [[Thessaly Malaeda]], but she turned out to be a shapechanged [[succubus]].

Torin formed an alliance made up of Hillsfar's [[Tower Guard]], [[Mages' Guild]], and [[Rogues Guild]], as well as mercenaries and disloyal [[Netherese]] soldiers and defeated the Netherese garrison outside Hillsfar.
