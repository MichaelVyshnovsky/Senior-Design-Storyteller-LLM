        "mainbody": "'''Molostroi''' was a [[baelnorn]] protector of Myth Drannor that opposed the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s plan to gain control of all of [[Faer√ªn]] through [[Pelendralaar]] corrupting the city's ''[[mythal]]'' and a ''[[pool of radiance]]''.\n\n{{Quote|''This form is only an image, and I cannot move objects. I need you to bring the scepter into the ruins of Myth Drannor and aid the attack against the Cult so that mythal may be saved and repaired. It is dangerous, but I know secret paths. Will you aid me?|Molostroi}}",
        "Description": "Molostroi appeared as a tall elf with dried up and shriveled skin. His eyes glowed with ancient power and his presence radiated impressive power.",
        "Personality": "Molostroi's entire existence was dedicated to protecting the secrets and power of the fallen elven city. He was not aggressive, carried no weapon, and had a cunning mind.",
        "Abilities": "Molostroi was an ancient and powerful baelnorn with the extent of his power unrevealed. He often presented himself in the ''baelnorn teleprojection'' form that was powerful enough to take on dangers and kept his actual body safe.\n\nIn the ''baelnorn teleprojection'' form, Molostroi had full access to his ''spells'', baelnorn abilities, and some special traits. Molostroi was able to use his magic to ''[[turn undead]]'' at the level of a powerful [[cleric]], he was immune to ''cold'', ''electricity'', ''[[polymorph]]'', and any magics or abilities that affected one's mind. He was able to fly, like other elves, possessed ''[[darkvision]],'' and had a wide variety of spells handy, such as ''[[sunburst]]'', ''[[Power word, stun]]'', ''[[prismatic spray]]'', ''[[analyze dweomer]]'', ''[[Bigby's forceful hand]]'', ''[[dimensional anchor]]'', ''[[invisibility sphere]]'', and ''[[greater dispelling]]'', among many others.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], the Cult of the Dragon occupied the ruins of Myth Drannor, aiming to corrupt the city's ''mythal'' and perform a dreaded ritual submerging the Cult's [[dracolich]] ally into the ''pool of radiance'', discovered in the [[Elven Catacombs]]\n\nEventually, Molostroi was captured and imprisoned by the cultists, yet he, and his fellow baelnorn protectors, were still able to reach out to the three groups of adventurers that were opposing the cult in the ruins of Myth Drannor. One of these groups was led by [[Athan]] and sent by [[Elminster]] himself to stop the cult, the second was the group of heroes from [[Phlan]] who were tasked with guarding the resurgent ''pool of radiance'' under the city but were swept through a ''gate'' to Myth Drannor, and the third group of heroes arrived at the city in pursuit of the cult's slavers.\n\nMolostroi used his ''baelnorn teleprojection'' to appear in front of the surviving heroes guiding them to stop the cult. Once the adventurers that were in the pursuit of the slavers penetrated the [[Crypt of Orbakh]] and laid their hands on the ancient [[necromancer]] weapon that rested there, ''[[Orbakh's ivory scepter]]'', Molostroi realized that the heroes now had a chance of stopping the cult if he directed them. The scepter was one of few weapons in the ruins of Myth Drannor that was able to destroy Pelendralaar's ''[[phylactery]]'', making the cult's plan vulnerable.\n\nHe helped them by indicating the most secure way to get to the main hideout of the Cult inside the ruined city and asked them to destroy that ''phylactery''. Once the dracolich was vulnerable, he guided the other surviving group of adventurers to battle the dreaded creature, killing it permanently, and subsequently, restoring the ''mythal'' and letting the ''pool of radiance'' drain into nothingness."
