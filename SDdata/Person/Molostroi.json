        "mainbody": "Molostroi was a baelnorn protector of Myth Drannor that opposed the Cult of the Dragons plan to gain control of all of Faer√ªn through Pelendralaar corrupting the citys mythal and a pool of radiance.\nMolostroi appeared as a tall elf with dried up and shriveled skin. His eyes glowed with ancient power and his presence radiated impressive power.\nMolostrois entire existence was dedicated to protecting the secrets and power of the fallen elven city. He was not aggressive, carried no weapon, and had a cunning mind.\nMolostroi was an ancient and powerful baelnorn with the extent of his power unrevealed. He often presented himself in the baelnorn teleprojection form that was powerful enough to take on dangers and kept his actual body safe.\nIn the baelnorn teleprojection form, Molostroi had full access to his spells, baelnorn abilities, and some special traits. Molostroi was able to use his magic to turn undead at the level of a powerful cleric, he was immune to cold, electricity, polymorph, and any magics or abilities that affected ones mind. He was able to fly, like other elves, possessed darkvision, and had a wide variety of spells handy, such as sunburst, Power word, stun, prismatic spray, analyze dweomer, Bigbys forceful hand, dimensional anchor, invisibility sphere, and greater dispelling, among many others.\nIn 1369 DR, the Cult of the Dragon occupied the ruins of Myth Drannor, aiming to corrupt the citys mythal and perform a dreaded ritual submerging the Cults dracolich ally into the pool of radiance, discovered in the Elven Catacombs\nEventually, Molostroi was captured and imprisoned by the cultists, yet he, and his fellow baelnorn protectors, were still able to reach out to the three groups of adventurers that were opposing the cult in the ruins of Myth Drannor. One of these groups was led by Athan and sent by Elminster himself to stop the cult, the second was the group of heroes from Phlan who were tasked with guarding the resurgent pool of radiance under the city but were swept through a gate to Myth Drannor, and the third group of heroes arrived at the city in pursuit of the cults slavers.\nMolostroi used his baelnorn teleprojection to appear in front of the surviving heroes guiding them to stop the cult. Once the adventurers that were in the pursuit of the slavers penetrated the Crypt of Orbakh and laid their hands on the ancient necromancer weapon that rested there, Orbakhs ivory scepter, Molostroi realized that the heroes now had a chance of stopping the cult if he directed them. The scepter was one of few weapons in the ruins of Myth Drannor that was able to destroy Pelendralaars phylactery, making the cults plan vulnerable.\nHe helped them by indicating the most secure way to get to the main hideout of the Cult inside the ruined city and asked them to destroy that phylactery. Once the dracolich was vulnerable, he guided the other surviving group of adventurers to battle the dreaded creature, killing it permanently, and subsequently, restoring the mythal and letting the pool of radiance drain into nothingness."
