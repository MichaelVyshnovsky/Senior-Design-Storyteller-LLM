'''Ilvarthaele Everstone''' was a [[Damaran]] [[human]] woman and a [[High Heralds|High Herald]], as which she was known as the '''Silver Stag'''.

==History==
Ilvarthaele Everstone was once a [[scribe]] and [[loremaster]] in the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]].

In the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], Ilvarthaele was selected by the High Heralds to join them as a High Herald herself. She was also permitted to establish a new High Herald office, that of the [[Silver Stag]], which she based in the Stormspire in the town of [[Songhal]] in [[Impiltur]] near the end of that year. This was the first time a new High Herald post had been created in the lands around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] since the Heralds had been founded in the [[992 DR|Year of the Watching Helm, 992 DR]].

==Activities==
Ilvarthaele was charged with supporting the practice of [[heraldry]] in the lands of Impiltur, [[Thesk]], [[Damara]], and the independent cities of [[northeast Faerûn]]. She was also tasked with maintaining and administering heraldry in lands east of the Inner Sea.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|59}}
