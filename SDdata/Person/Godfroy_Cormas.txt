'''Godfroy Cormas''' was a [[fighter]] and [[cleric]] of [[Lathander]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Cormas had light blond hair and a righteous attitude. The [[half-elf]] was a devout worshiper of [[Lathander]] and was a skilled cleric in both the [[Healing domain|Healing]] and [[Sun domain]]s.

==Relationships==
Godfroy's father, [[Dalan Cormas]], was a great priest of Lathander and his mother, [[Maria Cormas|Maria Emmarask]], was a noble of the [[Emmarask]] family. His father came from a lowly background, but fell in love with the noble young woman. Due to the differences of their backgrounds, and that his mother's family only cared for advancing their political careers, the two did all they could to deny their love for each other. The other noble families caught onto this and circulated rumors that they were actually together. His father did not wish to embarrass the girl he adored, and moved away to a little parish in the [[King's Forest]]. She, however, could not bare to lose him and followed her lover to the forest. Shortly after, the two married and gave birth to their child, Godfroy.

==History==
After his parent's original home was blighted by [[ghazneth]]s, Godfroy's family rented one of [[Valetto]]'s farms at the edge of the King's Forest, just north of [[Morfen]]. After only living there for a short time, [[hobgoblin]]s raided their farm. Godfroy was not present during this raid, as he was working alongside [[Jonas]] and Jonas' brother. All of his family were killed, including his mother, father, and cousin, [[Bardas Frem]]. Godfroy set off with Jonas and Jonas's brother to seek out [[Sir Hawklin]].
