Boofie McLaddin was a guard in Luskan in the mid–15 century DR.
While working as guard in 1463 DR, he recognized Drizzt and Dahlia entering the city. He quickly informed Tolston Rethnor and claimed a large part of the bounty on Dahlia for her killing Supreme Captain Borlann of Ship Rethnor in exchange for his help ambushing the two elven warriors.
