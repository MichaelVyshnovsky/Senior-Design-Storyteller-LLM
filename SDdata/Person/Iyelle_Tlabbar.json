However, Iyelle turned traitor and attacked her fellows during a battle with some monsters.\n\nLater, Iyelle retreated inside the outpost with three [[hobgoblin]] slaves, where she was confronted by adventurers hired by [[House Xorlarrin]], [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]], and [[Bregan D'aerthe]]."
