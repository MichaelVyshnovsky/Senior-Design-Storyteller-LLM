        "Combat": "Snort was often used in combat, where it could ram foes, and subsequently burn them.",
        "Relationships": "Athrogate cherished the war pig that he had been given, and was known to treat Snort like a loved pet.",
        "History": "In [[1368 DR]], Jarlaxle explained to his dwarven companion, Athrogate, that he did not walk from place to place. Instead, he used a [[magic]]al steed that was tied to a conduit, as did [[Artemis Entreri]]. Whilst Jarlaxle used a nightmare, he passed his short companion a red ''figurine of wondrous power''. When Jarlaxle explained how to call for it, by using its name, Athrogate literally snorted, as he believed that would summon it. Jarlaxle had to clarify that \"Snort\" was indeed the hellish boar's name."
