He led the Sharran cultists' activities at the [[Black Rift]] on the [[Plane of Shadow]], serving the [[black dragon]] [[Despayr]].",
        "Description": "He wore shining black [[full plate]] armor. As a dark creature, he appeared more gray and black than a regular human.",
        "Abilities": "Although Malkarion had lost the holy powers he had as a paladin, he gained in return the unholy powers of a blackguard, such as the ability to smite good creatures, find them with ''[[detect good]]'', and use poison without risk.<ref group=\"note\">In v.3.5, as a 7th-level [[paladin]] taking two levels of the [[blackguard]] [[prestige class]], Malkarion should gain a range of blackguard powers. However, very few of these are listed in his statistics block in the ''[[Cormyr: The Tearing of the Weave]]'' module, most likely in error.\n\nAt some point, Malkarion became a [[dark]] creature, partially of shadow. He was able to see in the dark, could move swiftly, was highly resistant even to intense cold, and could move stealthily, and able to disappear into the shadows even whilst observed.",
        "Possessions": "In battle, Malkaron wore shining black ''+1 [[full plate]]'' armor, wielded a ''+1 [[bastard sword]]'', and carried a ''+1 [[heavy shield|heavy steel shield]]''. He also had three masterwork [[dagger]]s, oft-poisoned with [[shadow essence]]. He was equipped with ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]''.\n\nAs part of his [[gorgon]]-training efforts, he had two ordinary [[horse]] saddles—a [[riding saddle]] and a [[military saddle]]—modified with extra-long girth straps to accommodate the beast's greater size. He also had several ''[[scroll]]s of [[break enchantment]]'' for those occasions when it turned him to stone.\n\nHe owned several sets of fine clothing.",
        "Activities": "Serving Despayr, Malkarion managed the day-to-day affairs at the Black Rift, leading the dark disciples and priests there, allowing the black dragon to concentrate on the ritual to tear apart the [[Weave]]. He knew all the Sharrans working there and those working with them.\n\nHe dwelled at one of the towers in the Black Rift—his \"demesne\". It was surrounded by [[Evard's black tentacles|writhing black tentacles]], a manifestation of the morphic nature of the Shadow Plane. Here he could be found in prayer to Shar.\n\nMalkarion missed the special celestial mount he'd had as a paladin, and so attempted to train a [[gorgon]] he'd acquired to carry him. He brought the beast with him to the Black Rift, and kept it in a cave in the side of the cliff, though it was disturbed by the Plane of Shadow. He was as yet unsuccessful, but the gorgon usually did not attack him, though it would attack anyone else who strayed into the cave. He himself was petrified several times. He left instructions with his minions that, if he was, they should ask Despayr to retrieve his body, then use a ''scroll of break enchantment'' to restore him.",
        "History": "Malkarion was once a [[paladin]] devoted to [[Tyr]], god of justice, before being swayed by [[Shar]], goddess of darkness. He fell from grace, losing his holy powers and his celestial mount, and rose instead as a wicked [[blackguard]].\n\nHe became heavily involved the plot hatched between [[Esvele Graycastle]] and Despayr to tear apart the [[Weave]]. By the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], he was based in the Black Rift in the [[Shadow Swamp]] on the [[Plane of Shadow]], managing Sharran operations there and serving Despayr directly."
