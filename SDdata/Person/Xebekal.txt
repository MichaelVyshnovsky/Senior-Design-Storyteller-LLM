'''Xebekal''' was a [[beholder]] [[Transmutation|transmuted]] by [[Arcturia]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime before the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], Xebekal invaded [[Arcturiadoom]] to conquer it. However, Arcturia using a ''[[wish]]'' [[spell]] and transformed the beholder into a tapestry. From then on, the beholder retained its [[darkvision]] and could see whatever was in front of it, but nothing behind it. It couldn't speak, and its movement was limited to harmless flapping.
