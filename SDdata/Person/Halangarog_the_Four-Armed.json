        "mainbody": "alangarog the Four-Armed was one of the Tharkuls of Thar, legendary for abdicating from the position of power, sometime before 1372 DR, simply because he was sick of it all.\nDuring his reign, Halangarog the Four-Armed was served by seven oni mage advisors. They were impressed with the rulers mastery of weaponry from the countries to the east of Faer√ªn and gifted him the Seven Stars of Halangarog, enchanted shurikens, imbued with their life force and weaved in powerful enchantments. The oni advisers looked forward to seeing these powerful weapons in combat, but that was never to be. Halangarog infamously gave up the throne before the shrikes ever taste blood. The ruler simply was fed up with the job. He left the seat of power and Thar itself, becoming the only Tharkul ever to do so and the only Tharkul not to die on the throne."
