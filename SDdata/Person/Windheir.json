        "mainbody": "Duke Windheir was the most prominent member of the avorals and one of the Companions of the Celestial Lion Talisid of Elysium. According to the World Tree cosmology, Windheir resided with Talisid and the other guardinal paragons, in the House of Nature.\nWindheir was the wisest and most powerful of all avorals.\nThe duke shared all powers common to avorals, including the ability to shoot forth lightning bolts.\nWinheir had a daughter, named Morningwind, who served as the guardinal ambassador of the town of Release-From-Care on Amoria to the gate-town of Ecstasy in the Outlands.\nBy the mid- to late-14 century DR, Duke Windheir had retired and been replaced by Lady Zvestra and later by Dutchess Sathia."
