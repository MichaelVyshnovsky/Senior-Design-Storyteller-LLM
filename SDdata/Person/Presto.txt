'''Presto''', or '''the Magician''', and also called '''Preston''',{{Cite comic/Saturday Morning Adventures 1}}

==Description==
He wore [[glasses]] and a long green [[robe]], with a matching floppy pointed hat over his tatty auburn hair. Presto had a golden [[sash]] around his waist that fastened his robe and held a couple of [[pouch]]es.

==Personality==
Though quite intelligent, and wise,

==Abilities==
Being a competent wizard, Presto could cast [[spell]]s as strong as ''[[ice storm]]'' and ''[[wall of fire]]''.

==Possessions==
His most well-known possession was the ''[[hat of many spells]]''. However, it could often be useless.

Preston carried a significant amount of other magical equipment, such as a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]'' and ''[[potion]]s'' of ''[[aid]]'', ''[[cure serious wounds]]'', and ''[[displacement]]''.

His gear was mostly magical. He wore a ''[[cloak of resistance]]'', a ''[[headband of intellect]]'', and a ''[[ring of protection]]''. He also had a [[dagger]], his [[spellbook]], [[waterskin]], trail [[ration]]s for a day, flint and steel, and three [[torch]]es.

==History==
Presto and his friends were originally from Earth, Later, they were in some place they called "the Forgotten Realms", evidently not knowing the difference.{{speculation}} Aiding by the Dungeon Master, they battled monsters sent at them by the villainous [[Venger]] and tried to defeat him for good while struggling to find a way home. During all this, Presto found his soulmate.

===The Victims of Tiamat===
Living long before the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], he was among a band of young adventurers who were all trying to find a way back to their distant home. However, it was said they were all slain horribly by [[Tiamat]], together with their miniature unicorn. By [[1369 DR]], the [[Adventurer Mart]] in [[Athkatla]], [[Amn]], displayed paintings of his two friends, Hank and Bobby.

===The Grand Tour of the Realms===
In the 1360s DR, Presto and his friends made their way to the town of [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]] in [[Faerûn]] so that Presto could ask the great sage [[Elminster]] to take him on as an apprentice. While drinking in the [[Old Skull Inn]], they spotted Elminster, but Presto was hesitant until his friends cajoled and taunted him into approaching the mage. He did, then lost his nerve, but his friends stood beside him to declare his suitability. So Elminster decided to take Presto with him on his "evening rounds" where he checked on various ongoing matters around Faerûn.{{Cite comic/Forgotten Realms: The Grand Tour}}

Thus, Elminster whisked Presto away on a whirlwind tour of the Realms, [[teleporting]] the two of them from place to place while teaching him much of the history, society, geography, and heroes of Faerûn. He corrected his misconceptions and gave a lot of practical advice besides. First, in the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]], they overlooked a battle between the [[Ebon Dream]] [[orc]]s and the [[Iron Banner]] barbarians, but Elminster's goal was to show Presto some [[Netherese]] ruins in a cavern. Here, Presto picked up a glowing green [[gem]] and they were surprised by a [[sharn]], before Elminster teleported them out of there. Now in [[Cormyr]], they visited a private club for mages, called [[War Wizard (club)|War Wizard]] and met travelogue writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. Next, they went to [[Skullport]] to meet [[Qilué Veladorn]], who called Presto a 'studmuffin'. While discussing [[drow]] and other figure, the sharn caught up with, but Qilué and Elminster zapped it with [[magic]]. Finally, they went to [[Turmish]], where they aided [[Alias]] and [[Dragonbait]] in defense of a temple of [[Deneir]] against a force of [[gnoll]]s led by a priest of [[Cyric]]. Presto used Elminser's magic staff to blast gnolls, until he was clubbed down and nearly killed by one, before Alias slew it and saved his life. Once the battle was over and the temple saved, Elminster took the weary Presto back to Shadowdale. 

There, outside the Old Skull, traumatized and beaten, Presto realized it was too dangerous to be Elminster's apprentice. That was when the sharn appeared a third time. At Elminster's hinting, Presto returned the glowing green gem to it, and it vanished. Elminster gave Presto some parting encouragement and departed. Returning to his friends, Presto heard all their questions and insisted he didn't want to talk about. Nevertheless, Presto soon had some ideas for future adventures with his friends.

Now he was older, he was tall and slender. Presto had grown wispy facial hair in the shape of a goatee. He wore green robes trimmed in a blue-and-white pattern and a pointed brown hat.

===The High Sun Games===
In the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Presto and his friends, all adults now and without unicorn, were one of six teams competing in the [[High Sun Games]] in the newly built [[Neverwinter arena|arena]] in [[Neverwinter]]. They evaded the [[displacer beast]] and even got to the center of the maze and safely inside the sanctuary cage at the end, winning that round. However, the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Sofina]] used the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'' above the arena soon after, so their fate is unknown.<ref>{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}<ref group="note">After reaching the cage, the cartoon characters are not seen again. The ''beckoning death'' smoke later engulfs their position in the arena, but it is likely they left before this. Their purpose for competing is also unknown, but they may also have been trying to stop Forge and Sofina.

===Went to Waterdeep===
Aged only 14, Presto and friends were camping in a forest one night when the Dungeon Master arrived to check on them, soon abandoning them again with promises of finding snacks, such as the spicy fried [[potato]]es they liked. Hank grew annoyed at this and their lack of progress on getting back to Earth; he had a new plan, but Presto and the others were tired and were accepting their new life. Presto wanted to make the best of being in "the Forgotten Realms". But then [[drider]]s and [[darkmantle]]s ambushed them, and they fought their way out and into a mysterious ''[[portal]]'' that opened. It dumped them from a height into the streets of [[Waterdeep]], now in daytime and autumn. They were met by a girl who was pleased her spell had worked.
