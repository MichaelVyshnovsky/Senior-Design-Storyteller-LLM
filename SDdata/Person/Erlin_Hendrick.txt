==Description==
Erlin was a fair-skinned [[human]] man with red hair. He wore a simple [[leather armor]] and was armed with a [[short sword]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the village of Imnesvale faced a slew of disappearances and locals did not hesitate to blame the legendary [[Umar Witch]]. Erlin and his wife [[Enna Hendrick]] fled their distant farm in fear of the dreaded witch and stayed within the Imnesvale. They brought their seven favorite [[chicken]]s over to the village. The chickens were not pets but rather the couple's future meals. Curiously enough, one of the chickens they brought over to Imnesvale had swallowed a precious [[beljuril]] [[gemstone]] that was still inside it.
