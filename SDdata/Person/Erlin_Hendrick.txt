Erlin Hendrick was a farmer who resided in the village of Imnesvale in the Umar Hills of Amn in the late 14 century DR.
Erlin was a fair-skinned human man with red hair. He wore a simple leather armor and was armed with a short sword.
In the , the village of Imnesvale faced a slew of disappearances and locals did not hesitate to blame the legendary Umar Witch. Erlin and his wife Enna Hendrick fled their distant farm in fear of the dreaded witch and stayed within the Imnesvale. They brought their seven favorite chickens over to the village. The chickens were not pets but rather the couples future meals. Curiously enough, one of the chickens they brought over to Imnesvale had swallowed a precious beljuril gemstone that was still inside it.
