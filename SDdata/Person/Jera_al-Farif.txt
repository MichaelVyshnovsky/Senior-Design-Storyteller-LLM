'''Jera al-Farif''' was the owner of [[Sculptures for the Elite]] within the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Jera was one of the most skilled sculpturers in all of Huzuz. [[Obsidian]] and marble were his materials of choice, though he used gems to enhances his projects.

If Jera was not completely satisfied with his work at any point during its construction, he would smash the object to bits and begin again.

He charged 500 [[dinar]]s for a life-sized sculpture, and 100 for smaller ones. His piece depicting the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] even adorned the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]].

He outright refused to take an order for a piece depicting any kind of [[genie]].

==Rumors and Legends==
Unbeknownst to the population of Huzuz, Jera was actually a [[markeen]] masquerading as a [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]]. It was unknown what happened to the original Jera.
