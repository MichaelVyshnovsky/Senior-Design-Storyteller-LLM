        "History": "T'lar was once a noble of [[House Mizz'rynturl]] of the city of [[Guallidurth]] until she joined the Velkyn Velve, the assassin branch of the new [[Temple of the Black Mother]], renouncing all her bond to better honor [[Lolth]].\n\nIn [[1378 DR]], she was chosen to kill [[Nafay Mizz'rynturl]], an old childhood friend who was in secret a traitor priestess of [[Vhaeraun]] and Eilistraee (combined as the Masked Lady). T'lar followed Nafay to the surface and observed her dealing with a [[wild elf]]. T'lar attacked and killed Nafay but out of curiosity tried to investigate more about this unusual meeting, sparing for a moment the wild elf.\n\nHe took her to a very ancient temple to Lolth on the surface. There T'lar sacrificed him to Lolth and this triggered the appearance of [[Halisstra Melarn]]. The Lady Penitent presented herself and T'lar proclaimed that she would spread devotion to the Lady inside her temple.\n\nIn [[1379 DR]] T'lar was in [[Sshamath]] as head of a new [[College of Bae'qeshel Magic]] that Master [[Guldor Zauviir]] tried to elevate as new member of the Conclave.\n\nLater she discussed with Guldor and his aunt Streea'Valsharess [[Ilharess Laele Zauviir|Zauviir]], the city high priestess of Lolth, about why their plot failed. Under orders of [[The Lady Penitent]] T'lar killed Guldor and later menaced [[Q'arlynd Melarn]].\n\nAfter T'lar killed also Streea'Valsharess and took control of her temple, informing her Lady about the news and she ordered to T'lar to kill Q'arlynd.\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>Just after Q'arlynd had engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by [[Wendonai]]'s blood into brown-skinned [[dark elves]] T'lar tied to kill him but Q'arlynd instead killed her thank to a [[contingency]] spell. She so joined Lolth in her realm."
