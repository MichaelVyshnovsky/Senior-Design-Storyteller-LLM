        "mainbody": "Tlar Mizzrynturl was a drow assassin member of the Velkyn Velve.\nTlar was once a noble of House Mizzrynturl of the city of Guallidurth until she joined the Velkyn Velve, the assassin branch of the new Temple of the Black Mother, renouncing all her bond to better honor Lolth.\nIn 1378 DR, she was chosen to kill Nafay Mizzrynturl, an old childhood friend who was in secret a traitor priestess of Vhaeraun and Eilistraee (combined as the Masked Lady). Tlar followed Nafay to the surface and observed her dealing with a wild elf. Tlar attacked and killed Nafay but out of curiosity tried to investigate more about this unusual meeting, sparing for a moment the wild elf.\nHe took her to a very ancient temple to Lolth on the surface. There Tlar sacrificed him to Lolth and this triggered the appearance of Halisstra Melarn. The Lady Penitent presented herself and Tlar proclaimed that she would spread devotion to the Lady inside her temple.\nIn 1379 DR Tlar was in Sshamath as head of a new College of Baeqeshel Magic that Master Guldor Zauviir tried to elevate as new member of the Conclave.\nLater she discussed with Guldor and his aunt StreeaValsharess Zauviir, the city high priestess of Lolth, about why their plot failed. Under orders of The Lady Penitent Tlar killed Guldor and later menaced Qarlynd Melarn.\nAfter Tlar killed also StreeaValsharess and took control of her temple, informing her Lady about the news and she ordered to Tlar to kill Qarlynd.\n Just after Qarlynd had engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by Wendonais blood into brown-skinned dark elves Tlar tied to kill him but Qarlynd instead killed her thank to a contingency spell. She so joined Lolth in her realm."
