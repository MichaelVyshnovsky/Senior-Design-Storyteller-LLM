'''Karr Nevrim''' was a [[half-orc]] rebel and a cell leader of the [[Nashers]] in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Karr had a taste for fine liquors and owned a bottle of [[Ferguson-Mosiondz Single Malt]].

==History==
Following the defeat of Nashers second-in-command [[Karzov]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Karr's cell continued to hold out from their base in the sewers below the old [[Merchant Square (Neverwinter)|Merchant Square]] in the [[Tower District]]. He had underhanded dealings with the [[Many-Arrows]] [[orcs]] who had occupied the district that threatened the rest of the city. When Captain [[Janros]] learned of this (via reports carried by a slain courier), he dispatched an [[adventurer]] to invade their sewer base and slay Karr.
