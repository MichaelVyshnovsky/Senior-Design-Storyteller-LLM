        "mainbody": "'''Quarrel''' was a [[half-drow]] [[warlock]] who feverishly pursued magical might and attention of the infamous warlock [[Ammon Jerro]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''I came here to follow in the footsteps of the Great One - the fearsome Ammon Jerro! What would he say if he saw me now?!''|Quarrel, about the [[West Harbor]].}}",
        "Description": "Quarrel had dark grey skin, wild black eyes, and white hair.",
        "Personality": "Quarrel's personality was a volatile mixture of confident displays of power and insecurity. Quarrel was obsessed with his fellow warlock Ammon Jerro, who played a role in the recent [[Shadow War]] in [[Neverwinter]].",
        "Possessions": "Quarrel was armed with a unique [[enchanted]] ''[[Quarrel's mace|mace]]'' that shared his fiery personality, and a set of ''[[Quarrel's leathers|leathers]]'', supposedly stitched together out of armor once worn by the half-drow's warlock hero.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Quarrel's quest for arcane power and pursuit of Ammon Jerro's legacy brought him to the small swamp town of West Harbor just as it was taken hostage by a duo of [[Harbor Mead]]-loving [[black dragon]]s – [[Voaraghamanthar]] and [[Waervaerendor]]. By that time, Quarrel had already gained some significant arcane powers from dealings with [[demon]]s and [[devil]]s and seen things that would terrify the stoutest hearts. When the dragons arrived, Quarrel foolishly confronted the wyrms, bragging about his great powers to Voaraghamanthar's and Waervaerendor's amusement. The dragons laughed in Quarrel's face and tossed him with other villages to work in West Harbor's brewery, supplying the thirsty wyrms with their favorite [[mead]]. This mockery wounded Quarrel's vulnerable pride.\n\nWhen a group of adventurers who partnered with a merchant princess [[Sa'Sani]] arrived in West Harbor, forging new trade routes for her mercantile empire, Quarrel took the opportunity to join them and travel to the [[Crossroad Keep]]. The fortress was the center of Sa'Sani's merchant business in [[Northwest Faerûn]] and another significant step in Ammon Jerro's history worthy of study.\n\nLuckily, the half-drow did find some first-hand information about Jerro. The Crossroad Keep's seneschal at the time was [[Khelgar Ironfist]], who, in fact, spent some time traveling alongside the famed [[Knight-Captain]] and Ammon Jerro. To Quarrel's fury, Khelgar mockingly talked about how his group defeated Jerro at his strongest in the warlock's hidden haven. The drow refused to believe such preposterous claims. All things considered, keep's books, stories, and information Quarrel collected were worth his time. He concluded that in order to learn Jerro's power, he had to do what the older warlock did – join with a power he respected, the group of Sa'Sani's adventurers, becoming a permanent member of the group, despite moral disagreements between them. The alliance would eventually let Quarrel learn and gain more power.\n\nAs part of the adventuring company, Quarrel faced with the [[yuan-ti]] plot of the [[Snaketongue cult]] to cripple the Sword Coast economy and Sa'Sani's business, eventually confronting the interloper deity [[Zehir]] in the jungles of [[Samarach]]. After the crisis was over, Quarrel returned to the Crossroad Keep to continue his accumulation of power and learning; however, that did not last. Eventually, the half-drow found out that his hero, Ammon Jerro, resurfaced somewhere in the far eastern nation of [[Thay]]. Quarrel immediately headed there, leaving the Crossroad Keep forever."
