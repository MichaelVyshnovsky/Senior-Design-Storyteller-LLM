He lied about the latter fact to his followers,\nHe and Hethyl Arkorran had a mutual disdain for one another, and a standoffish relationship with Avarice of the Arcane Brotherhood.\nIn addition to his cultist followers, Kadroth \"employed\" a number of captured servants, including the young tiefling Mere and a human called Thoob.\nCirca the , Kadroth led the cult in a campaign to take over the power of Caer-Dinevals speaker, Crannoc Siever. They took up residence within the castle, and prevented the speaker from leaving his personal quarters.
