        "mainbody": "'''Kadroth''' was a cultist of [[Levistus]] who oversaw the [[Knights of the Black Sword]] in the tiny town of [[Caer-Dineval]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Kadroth was seen as an inspired and ingenious leader by his followers. He had a sly mind for politics and cultivated a true cult of personality.",
        "Activities": "He led the cult from the reclaimed office of Caer-Dineval's former speaker, at the [[Caer-Dineval keep|town's castle]].",
        "Relationships": "While Kadroth received ''[[telepathic]]'' messages from Levistus, he was not able to communicate to the [[archdevil]] in kind. He lied about the latter fact to his followers,\n\nHe and [[Hethyl Arkorran]] had a mutual disdain for one another, and a standoffish relationship with [[Avarice]] of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]].\n\nIn addition to his cultist followers, Kadroth \"employed\" a number of captured servants, including the young tiefling [[Mere]] and a [[human]] called [[Thoob]].",
        "History": "Circa the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, Kadroth led the cult in a campaign to take over the power of Caer-Dineval's speaker, [[Crannoc Siever]]. They took up residence within the castle, and prevented the speaker from leaving his personal quarters. He took advantage of the man's ill health and acted as leader in his place, using Speaker Siever to sign and necessary documents and turning away anyone who sought to visit him in person."
