'''Opal Starlight''' was a [[half-elven]] [[scout]] of [[Ravens Bluff]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Opal Starlight lived in the city of Ravens Bluff in [[the Vast]], but little was recorded of her life; however, the woman's name graced the pages of the locally popular [[broadsheet]] – the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]''. [[Jacinth Moonspring]], the Society Editor, connected Opal to a notorious womanizer named [[Don Juan Montery]], who, apart from her, also entangled and frolicked with several other notable women within just a single month: pock-faced [[Vedina Stareye‎]], a lovely [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]], [[Yvonne Chantel]], and the fellow [[Knight of the Golden Rooster]] named [[Ladyhawke]].
