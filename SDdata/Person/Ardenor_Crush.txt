'''Ardenor Crush''' was a a mercenary leader who led the mercenary company known as the [[Chill]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. While he appeared as a [[hobgoblin]], he was in fact a [[human]] who had been reincarnated in a hobgoblin body.

==Personality==
Even in his second life he could still appreciate humans' sense of humor.

==Possessions==
Ardenor had ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'' and an amulet which allowed him to summon a [[nightmare]].

==History==
Following his human death, Ardenor was reincarnated by his [[wizard]] friend [[Grangor]]. His first task in his new body was to muster the [[goblinoid]] soldiers who lived through the [[Second battle of Urml]] and take revenge on those who killed him. The five separate divisions of the Chill traveled far to [[the North]] to this end.

Ardenor and his mercenaries were involved in the events of the [[iron crisis]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. Along with the [[Blacktalons]] they led raids on caravans traveling along the Coast Way and rerouted any iron shipments to their overseer [[Tazok]]. While Ardenor and the leader of the Blacktalons were under the impression they were under the employ of the [[Zhentarim]], they were actually being manipulated by the [[Iron Throne]].
