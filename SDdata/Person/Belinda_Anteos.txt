'''Lady Belinda Anteos''' was a member of the [[Waterdhavian]] [[Anteos]] family and the owner of the [[Sword Coast Traders' Bank]] in the town of [[Daggerford]].

==Description==
Some people considered her to be responsible and dependable enough to consider the services of her bank.

==History==
Lady Belinda established her business in Daggerford some time around the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, thanks in part to the support of the town's leader, [[Maldwyn Daggerford|Duke Maldwyn Daggerford]]. While she swore to others that her means of transferring funds were secure and confidential, many of the local townsfolk were not receptive.
