        "mainbody": "Skeikh Kaldhun bin Hanif was the leader of the enlightened House of Hanif tribe from the Haunted Lands around 1367 DR.\nKaldhun had sharp features and senses. He wore a stylish beard that had just a hint of gray. Khaldun stood  tall. He was strongly built even for a man in his late 50s as of 1367 DR. His presence exuded his proud and commanding demeanor.\nRarely would passionate outbursts take control as reason and sense were his dominant traits.\nKhaldun wore enchanted lamellar armor and wielded a vorpal great scimitar called Storm of Justice. Other items of note that he owned included a ring of genie summoning, a pair of boots of striding and springing, an enchanted composite longbow, and a quiver of enchanted arrows including arrows of slaying for giants, dao, efreet and elementals. Khaldun also carried three potions of extra-healing. Both the great scimitar and ring were family heirlooms.\nKaldhun sent an ambassador, Kerim to represent the tribe in Huzuz.\nHe assumed leadership of the House of Hanif at the age of fourteen. He was summoned to Huzuz the next year where he pledged his loyalty to the Grand Caliph.\nKaldhun fathered two sons from two different women. Yazid was born later on the same day as Muawiya.\nHis enchanted ring was capable of summoning a pleasant djinni ally named Besper."
