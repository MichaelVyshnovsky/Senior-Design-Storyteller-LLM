Revil Slombarr was a mage and a member of the Harpers in the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 15 century DR.
He was a heavyset young man.
In the late 1480s DR, Revil lived in a secret basement beneath the Smiling Satyr tavern outside Loudwater, which was run by a Harper sympathizer, Gharwin Umbryl. His duty was to attend to one of the teleportation circles of Krowen Valharrows network, but often he abandoned his duty and went out visiting festhalls, and Gharwin tried to cover for him.
