'''Revil Slombarr''' was a [[mage]] and a member of the [[Harpers]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was a heavyset young man.

==Activities==
In the late 1480s [[DR]], Revil lived in a secret basement beneath the [[Smiling Satyr]] tavern outside [[Loudwater]], which was run by a Harper sympathizer, [[Gharwin Umbryl]]. His duty was to attend to one of the ''[[teleportation circle]]s'' of [[Krowen Valharrow]]'s network, but often he abandoned his duty and went out visiting festhalls, and Gharwin tried to cover for him.
