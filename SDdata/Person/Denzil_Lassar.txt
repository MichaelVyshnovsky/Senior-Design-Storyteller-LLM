'''Denzil Lassar''', later known as '''Lady D''', was the owner and the founder of the [[Inferno Hall]], a temple to [[Sharess]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|Human nature. I learned that everybody has his or her price. I've seen some of the same "good-hearted" adventurers that are up in arms against her wait in line to trade with Ceraphane like frothing animals. It's a shame that us mortals are so weak willed.|Denzil Lassar in an interview with ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter''}}

==Description==
Denzil Lassar was known for their acid tongue.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8/Interview of a Deputy Mayor Candidate|4}}

==History==
Denzil Lassar was born in the nation of [[Chessenta]], where he witnessed the atrocities of slavery and abuse. There, he learned to despise the practices of [[slavery]] and evangelical preaching.

In [[Ches]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{LCRB}} a new establishment dedicated to the Goddess of Excess & Lust opened in Ravens Bluff, called the [[House of Desires]]. This sparked some outrage from the [[Clerical Circle]], as the temple was opened as a merchant house by all legal definitions and registrations and, as such, the Clerical Circle held no power over it. The new establishment's owner, named [[Ceraphane]], threatened to outperform and overshadow the Inferno Hall quickly. As a gesture of goodwill, Ceraphane invited Denzil Lassar and members of the [[Infernal Hunt Club]] to the House of Desires. Following the visit, Denzil Lassar gave an interview to the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' saying that the two temples' philosophies were well aligned and he saw a great mutually beneficial future ahead. Since then, Denzil had been seen meeting with Ceraphane several more times.{{Cite trumpeter/2-3/A Tale of Two Temples|2-3}} In [[Tarsakh]] of the same year, Denzil Lassar was among many notable individuals who attended the housewarming celebration of [[Briar Oldhill]]'s manse, boarding house, and shrine humorously named [[Briar's Patch]].{{Cite trumpeter/2-4/A Pleasant Housewarming|2}}

The month of [[Mirtul]] of 1371 DR was shaken by a scandal that exposed Ceraphane as a being of [[lower planes]]. The social club called the Infernal Hunt Club was sucked into the scandal because of their quick and close relations ever since the initial visit to the House of Desires. [[Jacinth Moonspring]] of ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter'' conducted an interview with Denzil after a [[candle]]lit dinner in which the Master of the Hunt denied claims that Ceraphane was a [[baatezu]] and that he and the social club held no ill intents for Ravens Bluff. The man reiterated that the Infernal Hunt Club had some of the most upstanding citizens among its rands and that he himself was aiming to run for the position of the Lord Speaker in the future.{{Cite trumpeter/2-5/The Infernal Hunt Club Exposed!/4}}

In [[Kythorn]], Denzil Lassar was one of many [[adventurer]]s who embarked on a journey under the leadership of Sir [[Rethgif Deepburrow]], Knight Commander of the [[Order of the Fox]], to the 47{{th}} level of the [[Abyss]] to oppose its ruler's dire plot against the Living City. The adventures managed to rescue several abducted inhabitants of [[Big Moe]] from an earlier attack on the town. The article by [[Gilbert Hadfree]] that recounted these events, erroneously or falsely, claimed that Rethgif Deepburrow's operation rescued the goddess [[Waukeen]],{{Cite trumpeter/2-6/Waukeen Freed from the Abyss|1}} however, that was a false claim as the goddess was freed months earlier by a group of heroes sponsored by the [[Goldspires]] of [[Amn]] and guided by visions of [[Halanna Jashire]]. Later the same month, Denzil Lassar publicly denounced slavery as a gaggle of dead slavers washed ashore in the neighboring city of [[Tantras]]. He vowed the Infernal Hunt Club would guard the shores of the [[Dragon Reach]] from such deplorable people.

By [[Flamerule]] of 1371 DR, Denzil Lassar decided to publicly announce his retirement{{Cite trumpeter/2-7/Campaign News|6}} from adventuring and officially began the campaign to run for the office of the Lord Speaker of Ravens Bluff.{{Cite trumpeter/2-7s/Government positions draw plenty of nominations|4}} The following month, [[Gary Goodnews]] of the ''Trumpeter'' conducted an interview with [[Harmony of Milil]], a candidate for the office of the deputy mayor. During the interview, she suggested that she would be interested in picking Denzil Lassar, now known as Lady D, as her running mate. In an editorial note, it was revealed that, shortly before, Denzil had been involved in an incident of some sort in the Temple of [[Sel√ªne]] from which the candidate for the speakership emerged as a woman. The magical transformation did not affect her electoral candidacy nor campaign.
