==History==
Hope was once a sailor until she retired and opened the [[Hillpicket Inn]]. By the mid-1480s DR, she had become the village's mayor.

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Hope believed that the visiting [[Doctor Jubal's Carnival of Curiosities]] would bring an increase in her business, and had not heard any stories of spreading madness at the time, but would figure it to be no more than idle gossip.

==Relationships==
Hope was married twice and was searching for a possible third spouse.
