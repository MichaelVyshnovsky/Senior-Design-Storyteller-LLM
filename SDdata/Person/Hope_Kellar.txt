Hope Kellar ( 
Hope was once a sailor until she retired and opened the Hillpicket Inn. By the mid-1480s DR, she had become the villages mayor.
Circa 1486 DR, Hope believed that the visiting Doctor Jubals Carnival of Curiosities would bring an increase in her business, and had not heard any stories of spreading madness at the time, but would figure it to be no more than idle gossip.
Hope was married twice and was searching for a possible third spouse.
