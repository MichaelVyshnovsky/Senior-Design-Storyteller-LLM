'''Caldan Darkwood''' was a [[Sharran]] infiltrator from the hidden [[Cloister of Sombre Embrace]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Caldan Darkwood served the Mother Superior [[Viconia DeVir]] in the [[House of Grief]], located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]. Caldan Darkwood was hand-picked by the Mother Superior to lead a band of Sharran infiltrators to steal a powerful [[atrifact]] she thought to be a weapon – the ''[[Astral Prism]]''. The group also included [[Buddug Vriss]] – an expert in combat, [[Kurk Deepcroft]] – a [[lockpick]]er, [[Dreena Covely]] – a language expert, and [[Shadowheart]] – the group's [[healer]]. Every member of the group was considered to be utterly expendable and, before embarking on the quest, every member of the group had their memories taken by Shar to ensure nothing would be revealed to the enemy were they captured and tortured.

Eventually, the group was successful in stealing the artifact, but Shadowheart was the only survivor.
