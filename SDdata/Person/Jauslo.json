        "mainbody": "Civilar '''Jauslo''' was a member of [[Waterdeep]]'s [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] who was trusted by the [[Open Lord]], [[Laeral Silverhand]] ''circa'' 1490s [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''...And you get to go home rather than to jail! Everyone's happy, right?''|Jauslo}}",
        "Personality": "Jauslo was a serious, stern, and brutal woman who has committed her life to the service to the City of Splendors. She was mistrusting and cruel towards criminals, on occasion throwing them into the [[Castle Waterdeep]]'s dungeons, simply forgetting about them and letting them slowly die of starvation and dehydration. She always prioritized her duty over her morals. Still, she was willing to turn a blind eye to the individuals who performed goodly deeds, like freeing slaves.",
        "Activities": "Jauslo was in charge of a small group of loyal blades.",
        "History": "Civilar Jauslo was a loyal member of the City Watch member entrusted by Open Lord, Laeral Silverhand with the mission of recovery of her favorite pet, a baby [[griffin]] who was stolen from of the Lord's mansion by the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]] ''circa'' 1490s DR. Jauslo captured the [[halfling]] thief who unsuccessfully attempted to pick the Open Lord's pockets and after making sure the thief was not the member of Xanathar's Guild, \"requested\" the halfling's aid. She outfitted the little thief with disguise and pointed the halfling towards [[Skullport]], the underground city from which the Thieves' Guild operated from."
