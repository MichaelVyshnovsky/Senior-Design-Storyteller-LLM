She was mistrusting and cruel towards criminals, on occasion throwing them into the Castle Waterdeeps dungeons, simply forgetting about them and letting them slowly die of starvation and dehydration. She always prioritized her duty over her morals. Still, she was willing to turn a blind eye to the individuals who performed goodly deeds, like freeing slaves.\nJauslo was in charge of a small group of loyal blades.\nCivilar Jauslo was a loyal member of the City Watch member entrusted by Open Lord, Laeral Silverhand with the mission of recovery of her favorite pet, a baby griffin who was stolen from of the Lords mansion by the Xanathars Thieves Guild circa 1490s DR. Jauslo captured the halfling thief who unsuccessfully attempted to pick the Open Lords pockets and after making sure the thief was not the member of Xanathars Guild, \"requested\" the halflings aid.
