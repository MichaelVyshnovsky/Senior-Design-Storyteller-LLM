Shurdriira Helviiryn was the head of the College of Alteration and one of the members of the Conclave of Sshamath in the city of Sshamath in the year 1372 DR.
In 1379 DR, Shurdriira agreed with the proposal of Master Guldor Zauviir to elevate Tlar Mizzrynturl, Master of Baeqeshel Magic, to be a new member of the Conclave.
After Qarlynd Melarns revelation that only Lolths worshipers could practice Baeqeshel, she withdrew her support of Master Guldors proposal.
