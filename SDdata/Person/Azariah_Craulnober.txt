}}'''Azariah Craulnober''' (pronounced ''ah-ZAH-ree-ah''{{cite web |url=http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/lore_ec.htm |title=Realmslore from Elaine Cunningham|accessdate=2014-03-19 |author=[[Elaine Cunningham]] |authorlink= |date=20 May 2004|work= |publisher=Candlekeep Forum |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}) was the daughter of [[Elaith Craulnober]], a [[moon elf]] crime lord of [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
Azariah had silvery hair. In the summer of [[1364 DR]], her ears were still soft and folded, like those of all elven toddlers.

==History==
Azariah was an unexpected child, born in Waterdeep in the spring of [[1363 DR]] to Elaith's sun elven mistress,

Elaith, with the help of [[Danilo Thann]] and company, found the harp in the summer of [[1364 DR]], but after Danilo used it to reverse a curse, the harp was consumed and Elaith could not complete his task. However, in the process of defending Danilo, he was badly injured and his thoughts turned only to his daughter. His moonblade, sensing his change of character, reactivated itself so that Azariah would be able to inherit it.

After Elaith healed from his injuries, he took Azariah to [[Evermeet]], where she became a ward of the royal court.

When Azariah was old enough, Elaith brought her to Waterdeep and asked [[Arilyn Moonblade]] to train her and teach her the demands of bearing a moonblade.  Unknown to both Azariah and Elaith, Azariah had a half-brother, a child of Elaith and [[Amnestria|Amnestria Moonflower]], who may in fact be the heir to the Craulnober moonblade.
