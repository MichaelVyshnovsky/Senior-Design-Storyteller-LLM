Victorious, Aelric scattered Rathgar's own bloodforged forces.\n\n:In disarray and dread, Rathgar and his army retreated into the [[Serpent Valley]]. Aelric pursued, exploiting the chaos to once again strike at his foe.\n\n:Ultimately, Rathgar's army fled to [[Doegan Capital|Doegan's capital]] with Aelric's horde hot on his heels. They crashed through the city gates and walls and fought the invaders in the streets, with steel and fire and magic. Thus did Aelric the Avenger fulfil the old king's curse and liberate Doegan. The princess became queen, with Aelric at her side, and brought peace to Doegan.",
            "Rathgar the Raider": "[[File:Howl of Vengeance Aelric 3.jpg|thumb|right|Aelric the Avenger bursts through the gate of Doegan.]]\n:Rathgar paid no heed to the king's curse, until months later a captured criminal, a graverobber called [[Grubkern]], whispered of a gathering army of [[undead]] coming to rid Doegan of the invaders. As fear spread in the capital, Rathgar investigated, finding an undead horde almost at his doorstep. Fighting in and around the capital, they repelled the invaders and burned their crypts. Rathgar pardoned Grubkern, and Grubkern revealed the name of the leader of the undead: Aelric the Avenger.\n\n:Rathgar and his army pursued Aelric to the Serpent Valley, where he rallied his undead forces. Rathgar overcame them in bloodforge battle, forcing them to retreat once more.\n\n:Aelric's army holed up in Old Stone Keep. Resolute, both rulers prepared for a final battle. Ultimately, Rathgar defeated Aelric, putting an end to the old king's curse."
