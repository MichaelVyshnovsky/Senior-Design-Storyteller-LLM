Alicia Paalater was a debutante noble daughter of the Baroness Paalater of Amn in the late 14 century DR.
Alicia was a young debutante, considered to be foolish and naive by fellow noble Lady Lasalla of Athkatla. She preferred to wear finery of green hues. She could not tolerate commoners, thought them foul-smelling, and wanted them to be not allowed into Athkatlas Waukeens Promenade.
In the , Alicia Paalater found herself in the resplendent and exclusive inn known as the Mithrest and swooning over the foppish and predatory Count Claylan. The young woman was enamored with the nobleman, praising his bravery after listening to the Counts tales and being impressed by his supposed influence over the Council of Six. Alicia was invited to visit Count Claylans manor the same evening to view his collection of Sunite statuary. The nobleman insisted that her parents did not need to be distracted from their daily activities for a visit, especially since Count Claylans wife was away from the manor.
