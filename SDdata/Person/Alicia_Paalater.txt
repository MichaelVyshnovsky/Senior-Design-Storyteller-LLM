{{quote|''How dare you approach a debutante, beggar! My father should have you flogged!''|Alicia Paalater}}

==Description==
Alicia was a young debutante, considered to be foolish and naive by fellow noble Lady [[Lasalla]] of [[Athkatla]]. She preferred to wear finery of green hues. She could not tolerate commoners, thought them foul-smelling, and wanted them to be not allowed into Athkatla's [[Waukeen's Promenade]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Alicia Paalater found herself in the resplendent and exclusive inn known as the [[Mithrest]] and swooning over the foppish and predatory Count [[Claylan]]. The young woman was enamored with the nobleman, praising his bravery after listening to the Count's tales and being impressed by his supposed influence over the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]]. Alicia was invited to visit Count Claylan's manor the same evening to view his collection of [[Sunite]] statuary. The nobleman insisted that her parents did not need to be distracted from their daily activities for a visit, especially since Count Claylan's wife was away from the manor.
