'''Femter Deldrannus''' was a [[Shar]]ran faithful during the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a bald man with purple and black robes.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|692|16}}

==Possessions==
He looted a plethora of magic from [[Karsus' Keep]].

==Relationships==
Femter was one of [[Elryn]]'s [[Dreadspells]].

==Abilities==
As a Dreadspell, he wielded borrowed arcane power.

==History==
Femter Deldrannus was one of the Dreadspells sent with [[Elryn]] to find and slay a [[Chosen of Mystra]] near [[Westgate]] two [[tenday]]s into the Chaos of [[the Art]] in the {{yearlinkName|797}}. During the first leg of the trip, he had [[Uldus Blackram]] lead the way, while holding the noose around the man's throat. When Uldus Blackram was killed by [[Ilbryn Starym]], Femter found this funny.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|730-731|19}}

Once they found the ruin, Karsus' Keep, Femter helped loot the place of magic, and in particular found a ring that cloaked against seekings and hid all dweomers.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|725-726|19}} Once their looted magic failed against Azuth, despite bringing down the ruin, they fled.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|730-731|19}}

When Dread Sister [[Klalaera]] appeared and herded them back against Azuth, she used some agonizing power on Femter to convince the others before having him stand and walk. They were stopped partway by [[Umbregard]] and [[Starsunder]], two mages that appeared suddenly, and he made another attempt to escape, which was cut short by her control again. She then used him to absorb an attack from Starsunder, which left nothing but chunks of him.
