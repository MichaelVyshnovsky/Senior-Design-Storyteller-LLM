King Arbas "the Black Usuper" was an interloper who briefly seized the throne of Amn in the 7 century.
Arbas was married to Leluia Torlath, the only daughter of King Brinnaq Torlath I.
After the death of King Brinnaq I in 694 DR, Arbas set about killing all the male Torlaths in Amn and wiped out most of the royal family by 696 DR, including newly-crowned King Esmel IV and his baby son Esmar. Arbas took the crown of Amn for himself, but his reign ended the next year when the surviving Torlath heir Jhanos I returned and slew him, reclaiming the throne for his family.
