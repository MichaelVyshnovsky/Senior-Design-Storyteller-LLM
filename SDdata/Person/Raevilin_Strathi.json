        "mainbody": "Raevilin Strathi was an elven conjurer who was became mad, during his stay in a strange device of the Underdark.\nHe fought with a quarterstaff, and carried scrolls which could summon earth elementals and efreeti. Raevilin also had in his possession the enchanted bastard sword, Albruin. \nRaevilin Strathi and his group set out to the Underdark to explore, made no enemies and found nothing of importance.\nPrior to 1369 DR, Raevilin became trapped in the second-from-left facet of the Facet sphere. During his entrapment, he appeared to have lost his senses, particularly speech. He may have been rescued by the adventuring part of Gorions Ward, if treated with powerful divine magic. He admitted that he had lost his mind in the \"nothingness\" of the sphere, and became trapped by unknown means."
