        "mainbody": "Elvauna Larethra was the matriarch of Milil who represented the Lord of Song throughout the late 14 and nearly all the 15 centuries DR. She served the Mililan faithful as high priestess of the Arbalests House temple in Athkatla.\nShe had the appearance of an alluring, middle-aged woman with a slim build. She had lean features and—during her mortal life―blue eyes that belied a sense of melancholy. Following her ascension as Milils matriarch, Elvauna stood more tall, and her eyes shone with a radiance of pure joy.\nElvauna was considered an inspirational and kindhearted benefactor by her fellow faithful of Milil.\nAs matriarch, Elvauna focused her time on bolstering the morale of anyone who heard the music of the sorlyn. She ensured those petitioners had their spirits lifted and hearts comforted by Milils eternal melody. She took personal interest in the affairs of the Lords clergy and directly intervened in their troubles whenever possible.\nAccording the matriarch herself, Milil revealed to her over time, clues that hinted at a grand undertaking that would call upon all sorlyn of the Realms.\nIn early autumn of the , the previous Patriarch ascended to \"join Milils choir\", and his body rose from the ground and faded into nothingness. That night, all of the Realms sorlyn of appropriate influence, including all songmasters, shared a dream of Milil playing his harp while seated atop a cloud illuminated by moonlight.\nIn a rush of exalted singing and with a crack of thunder, Milil himself appeared before then-Prioress Elvauna, and kissed her in a full embrace. He imbued within her a light from within his own divinity, and named her Matriarch of his entire church. In that moment she became the mortal leader of the Mililan faithful.\nMatriarch Elvauna gathered her fellow sorlyn and made a brief visit to Waterdeep, before continuing south via portal to Arbalests House in Athkatla."
