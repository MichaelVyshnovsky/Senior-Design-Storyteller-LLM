'''Imbrar II''' was the last king of [[Impiltur]].

==Relationships==
He was the second nephew of [[Soarimbrar the Younger]] (who was a descendant of [[Imphras II]]'s fourth son), through his older sister.

==History==
Before his coronation, the teenage Imbrar would travel under the alias of ''"Sarshel of Laviguer"''. During this time his identity was kept hidden and his life protected by the [[Knights of Imphras II]].

After reaching age 16, he was crowned on [[Marpenoth 24]], the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. He took the throne from the aged Queen-Regent [[Sambryl]], who herself gained power when Imbrar's uncle was killed just before his coronation.
