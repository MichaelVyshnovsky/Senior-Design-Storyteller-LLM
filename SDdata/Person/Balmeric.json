        "mainbody": "'''Balmeric''' was the leader of the soldiers guarding [[adventuress]] [[Zaranda Star]]'s merchant caravan as she traveled from [[Morninggold Keep]] to [[Zazesspur]] in [[Mirtul]] of [[1366 DR]]. He afterward became Highstar over the [[Warriors of the Star]].\n{{Quote|To glory or an interesting death!|A toast proposed over [[beer]] with [[Zaranda Star]]}}",
        "Description": "Balmeric had an expressive face with long features.",
        "History": "Like the rest of the guards in her caravan, Balmeric was chosen directly by Zaranda. He was paid and treated well.\n\nWhen the party reached a farm that had been raided by bandits, Zaranda ordered her sergeant to form his men into a defensive circle off the road to protect the merchandise and animals, while she and the other adventurers approached the burning farmhouse. She ordered him to use their [[crossbow]]s to shoot any bandits who might approach. She similarly ordered him off the road when the party encountered the [[orog]] [[Shield of Innocence]].\n\nAfter Zaranda fled from the city of Zazesspur, Balmeric remained with her as a member of [[Star Protective Services]], and he and his crossbowmen helped defend the village of [[Tweyar]] from bandits.\n\nIn the fall of [[1366 DR]], after an internal conflict over the goals of Star Protective Services, in which Zaranda quit and had to be talked into coming back, Balmeric also quit. Zaranda bought out the mercenaries in service to him, and Balmeric himself traveled to [[Myratma]], hoping to take passage on a ship to [[Waterdeep]] and new employment there.\n\nAfter the queen took the throne and Star Protective Services became the Warriors of the Star, Balmeric apparently returned to Tethyr to became their leader until he was replaced by [[Vander Stillhawk]]."
