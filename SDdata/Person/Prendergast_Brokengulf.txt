'''Prendergast "Gast" Brokengulf''' was a noble in [[Waterdeep]] and heir to the [[Brokengulf]] family title in the latter part of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
By the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, his hair was turning gray.

==Personality==
Prendergast preferred being in the wild lands outside the city. He had a narcissistic streak and was jealous of younger men who were trying to achieve the same level of success as he had achieved as a gladiator. He was fearful and somewhat depressed at the prospect of growing old.

==Abilities==
He was an expert huntsman and had won much glory as a gladiator on the [[Field of Triumph]] in Waterdeep.

==Activities==
Prendergast eventually rose to become the Director of the Field of Triumph.

==Relationships==
Gast was the first son of the patriarch of the family, but passed on the title to his younger brother [[Morus Brokengulf I|Morus I]] because he wanted to continue his life as a hunter, gladiator, and agent for his family's business interests.

Gast was good friends with [[Urtos Phylund II]], but by the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, he was infatuated with [[Aridarye Phylund]] (Urtos II's young stepmother), and would do anything for her. After she was widowed, they eventually married.

In the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Gast came to blows with Lord [[Kuldos Roaringhorn]] in the [[Twilight Hunters (tavern)|Twilight Hunters]] tavern when he asked Kuldos about a rumor he'd heard implicating the noble in a scandalous relationship with a young girl in an outlying village. The two sparring nobles were ejected into the street by [[Song (individual)|Song]], one of the co-owners and an accomplished [[wizard]]ess, using a particularly strong ''[[gust of wind]]'' spell.

The entire Brokengulf family had a vendetta against [[Claugiyliamatar]], the [[green dragon]] known as "Old Gnawbones".

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, Aridarye Phylund used her influence over Prendergast to coerce him into arranging the accident that resulted in the death of her husband, Lord [[Urtos Phylund I]]. At the time, the elder Lord Phylund was estranged from his son, Urtos II, who was a close friend of Gast.{{Cite polyhedron/93/Adversaries|6}} Nevertheless, Gast was consumed with guilt over this evil deed for many years.{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|2}}

It was Aridarye that pushed Gast to become the Director of the Field of Triumph and to inaugurate the [[Champion's Games]], not only to raise his prestige but also create business opportunities for both the Brokengulf and Phylund clans.
