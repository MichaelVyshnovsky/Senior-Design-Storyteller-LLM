        "History": "Thaleste was born in [[Menzoberranzan]] as a member of a noble house. However, around [[1373 DR]], she angered her [[matron mother]], who then poisoned Thaleste. She barely survived and escaped, going to [[Skullport]] in search of a cure.\n\nHowever, Thaleste took a wrong turn and blundered into the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]]. There she was healed and decided to join the [[Church of Eilistraee]].\n\nIn [[1375 DR]], she was with the [[Darksong Knight]] [[Cavatina Xarann]] in her first patrol duty on the eastern fringes of the promenade.\n\nDuring the patrol, while Cavatina was busy with a [[spellgaunt]], Thaleste was attacked by an [[aranea]] cleric of [[Selvetarm]]. Cavatina however managed to arrive in time to save Thaleste's life.\n\nLater, Thaleste went back to check the place of the attack and found a secret passage. She followed it without telling this to anyone, and while inside she was attacked and killed by a [[carrion crawler]]."
