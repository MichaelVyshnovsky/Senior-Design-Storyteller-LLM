        "mainbody": "Zulmat, also simply called The Darkness, was a terror of Jumlat in the Pearl Cities region of west Zakhara in 1367 DR. \nZulmats calling card depended on his victim. Moneylenders wrists were broken and their throats were cut. Wicked sea captains were left on the beach like flotsam with lungs full of sea water. Corrupt city guards were stripped naked and dumped into al-Fatir River.\nJumlats Chief Vizier, Agat amir-Doth had yet to unravel the mystery of the Darkness as of 1367 DR.\nThe exact nature of this individual remained unclear. They could have been a man or a woman and a human or perhaps even a genie. Others believed the Darkness was a society and not just one individual."
