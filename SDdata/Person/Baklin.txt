'''Baklin''' was a [[shield dwarf|dwarf]] of [[Clan Stoneshaft]] who lived in [[Waterdeep]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Like many of his kin Baklin was stout and sported the typical dwarven beard. His appearance was so akin to his fellow dwarves it could be described as wholly unremarkable.

==Activities==
Baklin worked as a bartender at the [[Quaffing Quaggoth]] in the city's [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]]. He also served as an ally to the [[Red Sashes]], keeping an eye on the tavern for the vigilante group.
