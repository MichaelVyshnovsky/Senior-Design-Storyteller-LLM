Duchess Merial Luenath was the ruler of Luenath in Dambrath and the head of Clan Luenath.
Merial was one of the most powerful figures in Dambrath, second only to Queen Yenandra. The cities of Luenath, Hethar, and Prastuil were completely loyal to her.
She felt that she should be queen instead of Yenandra, but the daily strain of managing the affairs of three large cities consumed most of her time.
The duchess wore a ring of sleeplessness that she used often in order to have time to attend all of her duties.
