'''Nasim yn Feroz el Pesarkhal''', known as the '''"Dark Caleph"''', was the younger brother of [[Syl-Pasha]] [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]] and the leader of [[el Pesarkhal]] clan in [[Memnon]]. In this position, he directly controlled the black marketeers, and began buying and selling with sources in the [[Underdark]], which boosted earnings for the family by 50% over only a few years. He also controlled the enforcers and thugs in the city.

Nasim was raised by his older brother like a son, and the two of them together were responsible indirectly for the assassinations of more than one hundred people during the syl-pasha's rise to power in the late 1360s [[DR]].

Nasim's [[half-elven]] wife, [[Nureh el Pesarkhal|Nureh]], was the spymaster of el Pesarkhal family.<ref>
