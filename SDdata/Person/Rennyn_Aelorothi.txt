Rennyn Aelorothi was a gold elf fighter, wizard, and thief and one of the best spies of Evermeet around 1367 DR.
Rennyn was one of the most talented spies of Queen Amlaruil Moonflower. Often he went on missions to Faer√ªn and he usually disguised himself as a conjurer, a minstrel, or another kind of entertainer. Thanks to his magic, he could appear with a different face each time.
For a missions success, Rennyn was very able at faking friendship or interest to get familiar with someone. However, in truth, he had a frosty personality, being very insular and distant from others.
He was considered handsome.
