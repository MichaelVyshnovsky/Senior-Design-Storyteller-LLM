Alysae was a businesswoman and priest of Shar in Skullport.
In her festhall, she was the unquestioned authority. On the surface, Alysae was regal and peaceful, but in truth she was a ruthless individual who was quick to answer any challenge to her authority by any means, even brutal violence if need be. All staff and customers knew her true temperament, and avoid confrontation.
Hailing from somewhere south of Waterdeep, Alysae had an incident with the City Watch, who presumably searched for her. Afterward, she found a way to Skullport. Around 1370 DR, she owned the Hobbled Lamia and ran it successfully.
