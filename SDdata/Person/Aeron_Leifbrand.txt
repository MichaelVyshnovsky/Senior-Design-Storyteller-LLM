==History==
[[File:Aeron Leifbrand zombie.jpg|200px|thumb|''Aeron after fully succumbing to the infection.'']]
Sometime around the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], Aeron was recovering in the [[Eveningstar War Hospital]] when [[Peron Uthe]] arrived for treatment. Peron was infected with a strange disease passed from the [[druid]] [[Halsaime]], which turned him into a [[red musk zombie]] and began spreading to the other patients. Aeron was among those infected, and eventually transformed into a zombie as well before being destroyed when the hospital was cleansed. A sample from his body was able to be used by head priest [[Jaskyr Hurim]] to create an inoculation, allowing Peron Uthe to be safely destroyed.
