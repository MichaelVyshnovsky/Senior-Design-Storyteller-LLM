'''Anth-Malar''' was the [[Chosen]] of [[Malar]] and leader of the [[Furious Hunt]] [[lycanthrope]] cult in the early 1370s [[DR]].

==Description==
Though a pure-blooded [[human]], anth-Malar had the aspect of a furry humanoid beast with hooked claws.

==History==
Little was known about anth-Malar before he became Malar's Chosen except that he was considered his god's most devout worshiper and laired in the [[Twisted Run]] northeast of [[Silverymoon]].{{Cite dungeon/129/The Twisted Run|71}}

Malar bestowed upon anth-Malar his Chosen status in response to the formation of [[Luruar]], which was seen by the god as civilization encroaching too far upon his beloved wilderness.

Through the actions of a subordinate, [[Kazok]], anth-Malar discovered that [[blacktooth fungus]] could be used to intensify the effects of lycanthropy. He planned on using an army of so-called [[blacktooth lycanthrope]]s to eradicate the settlements of Luruar.

==Personality==
Anth-Malar was devoted to his god, leading many more [[High Hunt]]s within the Twisted Run than was usual per year. He was sadistic, preferring to impale living victims on the points of stalactites above him.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/129/The Twisted Run|86}}

==Possessions==
Anth-Malar wore many defensive [[magic item]]s to protect him from both physical and magical attacks, but his prize possession was the ''[[Skin of Malar]]'', a bloodstained [[artifact]] of his god.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/129/The Twisted Run|88}}
