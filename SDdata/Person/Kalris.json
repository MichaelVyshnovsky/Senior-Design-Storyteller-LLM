        "mainbody": "Kalris was a human adventurer and member of the Emerald Swords company circa 1369 DR. He was a wizard of some quality, and handled most of the groups spellcasting.\nKalris had long, red hair.\nHe was a cunning and opportunistic man, preferring stealth and misdirection over direct action.\nKalris was a proficient arcane spellcaster, and had a wide variety of spells at his disposal. They tended towards subtle spells that aided his subterfuges.\nKalris carried a dagger and a wand of magic missiles. He wore a robe of the archmagi, a ring of mind shielding, and a ring of form retention.\nIn 1369 DR, Kalris and the Emerald Swords were guests at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail. They conspired to kidnap Lord Partic Thistle and hand him over to Zhentil Keep for questioning, and had Xixis the doppelganger impersonate Lord Thistle to allow them to escape without suspicion. To aid the deception, Kalris lent Xixis his ring of form retention, to make absolutely sure that the doppelganger didnt lose its disguise. When Xixis risked carelessly ruining the plan, Gandegar Armstrong had Haridyn Storm kill Xixis with a dagger of venom, so that the Lords murder would cover up his kidnapping. Thanks to the ring of form retention, Xixis kept the form of Lord Thistle even in death. Despite their best attempts at diversion, the Emerald Swords were caught and Lord Thistle rescued. For their murder and kidnapping, they risked exile or execution for their crimes."
