Kulaga was a male logokron that was a fiend patron for warlocks in the 15 century DR.
In 1486 DR, Lorcan hoped to bargain with Kulaga. Lorcan and Farideh went to the small fortress home of Kulaga and confronted the patron and Adastreia and at last after a brief battle Kulaga agreed to a parley.
Kulaga was an incredible spymaster and a practitioner of true name magic.
Kulaga was the patron of a warlock heir of the Toril thirteen called Adastreia Tyrianicus. He could summon some barbazu and had two flesh golem bodyguards.
