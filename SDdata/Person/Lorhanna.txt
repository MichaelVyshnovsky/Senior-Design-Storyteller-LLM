Lorhanna was a priest of Tempus in Yûlash in the late 15 century DR.
Lorhanna took care of the shrine to Tempus in the Red Plumes encampment in Yûlash.
Lorhanna was exiled from Hillsfar by Torin Nomerthal because he disagreed with the use of non-humans in the arena.
Circa 1486 DR, during the visit of Torin Nomerthal to the city, Lorhanna possibly joined an adventuring party hired by Elanil Elassidil to try to remove the First Lord from power. She spoke to gain the support of the soldiers.
Lorhanna believed it was dishonorable to force untrained warriors to fight to the death for the amusement of others.
