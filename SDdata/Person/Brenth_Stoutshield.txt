High Marshal '''Brenth Stoutshield''' was a [[halfling]] crusader who came to found and lead the [[Citadel of the Banner Raised Anew]] in [[Amn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Brenth was highly driven and devoted to his cause of building a realm for halflings to live in, free of interference by the taller folk.

==Relationships==
The High Marshal built a strong alliance with Major [[Tharundar Olehm (soldier)|Tharundar Olehm]] of [[Hillfort Torbold]], and they worked together to protect their interests.

==History==
Brenth was an officer of [[Arvoreen's Marchers]], a group of militant halflings and [[gnome]]s in [[Tethyr]] founded during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]]. While the Marchers were preoccupied with defending the [[Purple Marches]] during the widespread civil war, Brenth had the dream of founding an independent halfling realm in the Marches. This plan came to naught with the restoration of Tethyr's stability, and so in [[1367 DR]] Brenth resigned his position and began casting about for other opportunities.

Brenth found a fortune of [[gem]]s while raiding the ruins of [[Lost Xandar]], and then began new project in the lands of former Meiritin. He built the Citadel of the Banner Raised Anew on ancient sacred ruins, and used the new temple of Arvoreen as a base for halfling solidarity. Starting with a small cadre of young [[priest]]s and devout followers, Brenth attracted halflings parishioners from the nearby farmlands, gathered tithes, and began organizing militia patrols in the surrounding area. These worked in conjunction with the [[Council Army]] at Hillfort Torbold, and managed to cull the population of monsters in the region.

During the [[Sothillisian War]] in [[1370 DR]], Brenth put himself and most of his troops at the disposal of Major Olehm, leaving only a small reserve to defend the Citadel and surrounding area. This proactive stance put Brenth in the position of potentially winning great acclaim and influence, and potentially furthering his goals of an independent Meiritin.
