{{Quote|''Lord Gortash has to make some tough decisions to keep this city safe - I hope this rabble understands that.''|Fist Ernestus}}

==Description==
Fist Ernestus was a middle-aged [[human]] male with sun-kissed skin and bags under his eyes, obscured by his uniform's [[helmet]]. He was adorned in a set of [[chainmail]] with a Flaming Fist [[tabard]] and carried a heavy [[halberd]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Fist Ernestus was tasked with patrolling the Lower City of Baldur's gate. During the rising stardom of Duke [[Enver Gortash]] and the looming threat of the [[Absolutist]] army, Ernestus was faced with some of the Baldurian citizens who were unsatisfied with Gortash's governing and openly criticized the [[Baldur's Mouth]] [[broadsheet]] that was in the Duke's pocket. Ernestus held Enver Gortash in high opinion, claiming that the Duke had to make "tough decisions" to keep his citizens safe and that if the people had an issue with the ''Baldur's Mouth Gazette's'', they should take it to the rag's editor in chief.
