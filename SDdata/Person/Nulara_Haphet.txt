'''Nulara Haphet''', also known as '''Silversong''', was a female [[human]] [[bard]] who was one of the members of the [[Shadow Council]] of the [[Shadow Thieves]].

==History==
Nulara hailed from distant [[Mulhorand]], a place she never spoke of, and was considered to have the soul of a dark poet and the mind of a criminal genius. Her duty was to expand the guild's activity on the [[Sword Coast North]].
