Nulara Haphet, also known as Silversong, was a female human bard who was one of the members of the Shadow Council of the Shadow Thieves.
Nulara hailed from distant Mulhorand, a place she never spoke of, and was considered to have the soul of a dark poet and the mind of a criminal genius. Her duty was to expand the guilds activity on the Sword Coast North.
