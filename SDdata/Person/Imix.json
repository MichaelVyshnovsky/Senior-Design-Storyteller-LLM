He was a [[primordial]] older than the world itself.<ref> \n\nImix's many nicknames and titles included the '''Prince of Elemental Evil''', the '''All-Consuming Fire''', and the '''Eternal Flame'''.\n{{Quote|Someday, there will be only fire. Someday, everything will burn.|Imix}}",
        "Personality": "Imix was passionate, quick to anger, vain, paranoid and prone to jealousy. He seemed to have an endless supply of energy, which was spent on schemes that were always to the detriment of others.\n\nHe was noted as a masterful tactician and was very creative but his overconfidence and haughtiness caused him to rush into situations and he easily became frustrated when things didn't go according to his plans. He destroyed any who refused to acquiesce to him.",
        "Possessions": "The unique dagger ''[[Tinderstrike]]'' was imbued with a portion of Imix's power.",
        "Relationships": "Imix had enemies in the form of [[Zaaman Rul]] and [[Olhydra]], two other archomentals whom he was at war with.{{cite book/The Inner Planes|46}} Imix could have potentially destroyed Zaaman Rul if he was not fighting a war on two fronts but nonetheless, his servants eventually defeated Zaaman Rul's army. Imix also schemed against [[Kossuth]], but such was Kossuth's power in comparison, that although Kossuth was wary of Imix, he didn't take Imix's threat seriously.\n\nImix was served by the [[pit fiend]] [[Asgeroth]] (who had been tasked to destroy Zaaman Rul) as well as a multitude of [[efreet]], [[fire elemental]]s, [[fire giant]]s, [[Grue#Fire Grues|fire grues]], [[Mephit#Fire Mephits|fire mephits]], [[firenewt|firenewts]], [[magmin]]s, [[salamander]]s and [[red dragon]]s, some of whom worshiped him as a god. \n\nImix was one of the more eager allies of the [[Elder Elemental Eye]] and was being courted by [[Moloch]] for an alliance. He was said to also have allies on the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] and the [[Great_Wheel_cosmology#Inner_Planes|Para-Elemental Plane of Magma]].\n\nHe was venerated by the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]] led by the [[tiefling]] prophet [[Vanifer]].",
        "Domain": "[[File:Fire Elemental.jpg|thumb|left|''A [[holocaust disciple]], one of Imix's creations.'']]\nOn the Plain of Burnt Dreams, an island in the Blazing Sea of the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], rose a volcano, within which was the Temple of Ultimate Consumption, a  pyramid surrounded by volcanic rock in the middle of a lake of fire.",
        "History": "Imix's history on the [[Material Plane]] was concentrated mostly on the world of [[Oerth]], where his alliance with the Elder Elemental Eye caused him to send an aspect of himself to the ''Temple of Elemental Evil'', however that aspect was destroyed and Imix immediately withdrew his support.\n\nImix wished to make the Plane of Fire a plane of evil and searched for powerful evil servants to aid him in this task.\n\nDuring the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]], in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Imix was present in the [[Yaga-Shura's keep|keep]] of [[Yaga-Shura]] within the [[Marching Mountains]].\n\nCirca the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, the Cult of the Eternal Flame attempted to summon Imix to [[Faer√ªn]] at the site of the [[Weeping Colossus]] within the ruins of [[Besilmer]]."
