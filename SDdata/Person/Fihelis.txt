'''Fihelis''' was a [[half-elf]] of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Fihelis was a citizen of [[Neverwinter]], whose daughter died during the [[Wailing Death|Neverwinter plague]]. He began working with the Watch as a spy in [[Smuggler's warehouse]], to uncover [[Moire]]'s plans.

==Gameplay==
If the [[Kalach-Cha]] and the companions sided with the Watch, they needed to rescue Fihelis, who was being interrogated by Moire. Once done, the Kalach-Cha could threaten him for a reward, then bring him to [[Brelaina]].

If the Kalach-Cha and the compaions sided with the thieves, they needed to kill Fihelis. They could also kill the watchmen on the first floor for Moire or leave them alive for [[Axle]].
