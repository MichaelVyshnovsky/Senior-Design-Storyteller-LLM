        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], while in his [[Elemental Plane of Earth|home plane]], Gorx saw a [[gate]] to [[Toril]]. Intrigued, he passed through and arrived in the Fane. There, [[Keltar (individual)|Keltar]], a member of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]], mistook Gorx for an emissary of the elemental lord [[Ogrémoch]]. Taking advantage of this, the xorn enslaved the cultist, saying that Ogrémoch needed tributes to be given to Gorx. However, some adventurers infiltrated the Fane and confronted him."
