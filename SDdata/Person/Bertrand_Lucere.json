        "mainbody": "'''Bertrand Lucere''' was a merchant in [[Luskan]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "A merchant noted for his business ethics, Bertrand had worked his way up building a business that traded in lumber and [[iron]]. In the 1480s DR, however, he moved into specialty goods like rare herbs and minerals with alchemical properties used in [[potion]]-making. He met often with many of the town's merchants.\n\nHe had a daughter, [[Indra Lucere]], to whom he left a substantial inheritance.\n\nSome time around [[1490 DR]], Bertrand was murdered, his throat slit, in the entry hall of his home. He was found by his daughter Indra. A select few valuables of his most recent shipment, among them various bits of jewellery, was stolen, and his daughter's fianc√© [[Edwin (Luskan)|Edwin]] went missing."
