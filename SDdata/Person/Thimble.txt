{{quote|''As far as I'm concerned, Lord Gortash gets the benefit of the doubt. Until he does something obviously wrong, he's got my support.''|Thimble}}

==Description==
Thimble was a [[human]] woman with greenish-tinted skin and long, straight brown hair she wore gathered in a ponytail. Thimble wore a common dark-colored jerkin and a button-down tunic with simple brown baggy pants and [[leather]] [[boots]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Thimble frequented the busy [[Elfsong Tavern]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldurs Gate. There, she could be found playing cards with her drinking buddies [[Buff Tanner]], [[Cyndirie Vand]], and [[Grainne Jodhpur]]. Thimble was a supporter of the new Duke [[Enver Gortash]] and advertised unity in the face of the looming armies of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. She offered him full support unless Gortash were to do something disgraceful.
