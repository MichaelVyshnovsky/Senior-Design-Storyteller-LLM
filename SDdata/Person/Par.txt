'''Par''' was a villager of [[Highcliff]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Par was a wealthy villager of [[Highcliff]]. He asked of [[Kalach-Cha]] to go into his house and see what was wrong. The Kalach-Cha found a bunch of sailors, led by [[Dulahey]], who were robbing the place. Once Kalach-Cha defeated the pirates, Par would give some potions as a reward.
