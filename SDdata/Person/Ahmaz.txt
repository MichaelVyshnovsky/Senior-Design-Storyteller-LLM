Ahmaz was the captain of a githyanki spelljammer.
The captain was very xenophobic, even to the drow who allowed him to dock his spelljammer at their ports.
Ahmaz fought with an enchanted longsword.
Prior to 1358 DR, Ahmaz and his crew encountered a vortex in the astral seas, where his ship was badly damaged. He was forced to dock in Ust Natha, Faer√ªn, where he had to restore and seal the spellhammers hull.
