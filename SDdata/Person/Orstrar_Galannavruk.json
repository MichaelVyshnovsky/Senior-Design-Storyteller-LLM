        "mainbody": "'''Orstrar Galannavruk''' was a merchant from the city of [[Zazesspur]] in [[Tethyr]] who worked alongside [[Andred Kuroone]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Orstrar was a long-haired [[human]] man with a bushy beard who generally left negotiation and haggling to his more charismatic partner.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Orstrar and Andred made a living by trading in [[thael leaf]] (a type of [[pipeweed]] flavoring), [[herb]]s, and [[spice]]s, as well as dried foods and fruits, such as [[apricot]]s. Orstrar was the [[coin]] behind the enterprise. Some of their customers were found in [[Triboar]] and [[Scornubel]] and included [[Lurandural Veltree]] of Scornubel's merchants' guild, [[the Halanthor]]. When dealing with the [[High Holy House of Coinâ€Ž]], Orstrar prepared a taste test for the clients of thael leaf in a chase-decorated globe incense burner, while Andred Kuroone negotiated the price and advertised the goods."
