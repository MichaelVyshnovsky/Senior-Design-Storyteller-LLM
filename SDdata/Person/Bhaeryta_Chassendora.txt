Bhaeryta Chassendora was a merchant from the city of Tantras in the Vast.
Bhaerytas specialty was to trade in rare and otherwise hard-to-find material components and substances required for magic, such as dragon blood, manticore spikes, and wyvern scales. She often acquired these from adventurers who won them in their exploits, and sold them onto mages.
