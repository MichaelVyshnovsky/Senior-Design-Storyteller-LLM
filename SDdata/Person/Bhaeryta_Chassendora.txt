'''Bhaeryta Chassendora''' was a merchant from the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]].

==Activities==
Bhaeryta's specialty was to trade in rare and otherwise hard-to-find material components and substances required for [[magic]], such as [[dragon]] blood, [[manticore]] spikes, and [[wyvern]] scales. She often acquired these from adventurers who won them in their exploits, and sold them onto mages.
