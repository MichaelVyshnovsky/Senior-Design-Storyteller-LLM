He was a strict man with a commanding presence, and he took his job seriously. Dajos wore polished brass armor that indicated his rank.\nDajos owned books published by Volothamp Geddarm. Not surprisingly, he did not hold the author in high esteem.\nCirca the , Captain Dajos supervised Samargol Elite Guard Patrols within the city and outside its walls. His job included routing out all traces of yuan-ti corruption with extreme prejudice at the orders of the nations High Phantasmage. In 1374 DR, one of Dajoss patrols brought back survivors of the Vigilant shipwreck on the Omgars Teeth. The outsiders were to be brought in and interrogated. However, the famed author Volothamp Geddarm was among the survivors, and shortly after their arrival, a respected merchant SaSani vouched for the new arrivals, sparing them from Samarachs law. Captain Dajoss reluctance was swayed by SaSanis threat of angering the High Phantasmage.\nSometime later, when one of SaSanis aides was revealed to be a yuan-ti infiltrator, Captain Dajos was dispatched to inform her that the Council revoked her authority and commanded the merchant woman to leave Samargol my the following days sunset. The laws that dealt with the much-feared yuan-ti threat were an immediate danger, forcing SaSani to flee for the Sword Coast."
