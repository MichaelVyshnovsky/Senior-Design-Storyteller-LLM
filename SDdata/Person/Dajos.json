        "mainbody": "'''Dajos''' was a Captain of the [[Elite Guard]] from the city of [[Samargol]] in [[Samarach]], ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''I wasn't pointing at you, foreigner, although actually, I do recognize you from an illustration in one of your [[book]]sâ€“ you looked younger.''|Captain Dajos to [[Volothamp Geddarm]]}}",
        "Description": "Captain Dajos was a tall [[human]] male with slicked-back brown hair. He was a strict man with a commanding presence, and he took his job seriously. Dajos wore polished [[brass]] armor that indicated his rank.",
        "Activities": "Dajos owned books published by [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. Not surprisingly, he did not hold the author in high esteem.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Captain Dajos supervised Samargol Elite Guard Patrols within the city and outside its walls. His job included routing out all traces of [[yuan-ti]] corruption with extreme prejudice at the orders of the nation's [[High Phantasmage]]. In 1374 DR, one of Dajos's patrols brought back survivors of the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' shipwreck on the [[Omgar's Teeth]]. The outsiders were to be brought in and interrogated. However, the famed author Volothamp Geddarm was among the survivors, and shortly after their arrival, a respected merchant [[Sa'Sani]] vouched for the new arrivals, sparing them from Samarach's law. Captain Dajos's reluctance was swayed by Sa'Sani's threat of angering the High Phantasmage.\n\nSometime later, when one of Sa'Sani's aides was revealed to be a yuan-ti infiltrator, Captain Dajos was dispatched to inform her that the Council revoked her authority and commanded the merchant woman to leave Samargol my the following day's sunset. The laws that dealt with the much-feared yuan-ti threat were an immediate danger, forcing Sa'Sani to flee for the [[Sword Coast]]."
