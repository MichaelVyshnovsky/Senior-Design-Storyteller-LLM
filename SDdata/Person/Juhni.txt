Under the influence of [[Halsaime's staff]], Juhni was utterly devoted to his mad cause, though she was still quite a bit less bloodthirsty and aggressive than her fellow victims.

==Abilities==
Juhni specialized in transforming into a huge [[dire bear]], eschewing other forms of combat.

}}
After the corruption of [[Halsaime]] and the subversion of his druidic companions, Juhni defended the hidden [[Druid's Deep]], along with the [[ranger]] [[Kuldail Ukien]]. Though loyal to Halsaime, she did not wish bloodshed, and offered intruders the opportunity to leave unharmed rather than attacking on sight.
