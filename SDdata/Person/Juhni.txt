Juhni was a druid of Thorngap during the late 15 century DR.
Juhni had light skin and long white hair.
Under the influence of Halsaimes staff, Juhni was utterly devoted to his mad cause, though she was still quite a bit less bloodthirsty and aggressive than her fellow victims.
Juhni specialized in transforming into a huge dire bear, eschewing other forms of combat.

After the corruption of Halsaime and the subversion of his druidic companions, Juhni defended the hidden Druids Deep, along with the ranger Kuldail Ukien. Though loyal to Halsaime, she did not wish bloodshed, and offered intruders the opportunity to leave unharmed rather than attacking on sight.
