'''Carlig''' was a [[Shadovar]] soldier and scout from [[Thultanthar]] that served at the discretion of [[Princes of Shade|Prince]] [[Escanor Tanthul]] of [[Thultanthar]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Members of Carlig's unit were given unique horned helms that protected them from mind-controlling magic.

==Relationships==
Carlig was a member of the reconnaissance team led by fellow Shadovar [[Parth Gal]], working alongside [[Balpor]], [[Elar]], and eight others.

==History==
Carlig was killed in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, alongside the rest of Parth Gal's reconnaissance team. That Shadovar ventured into the ruined [[Irithlium]] tower in [[Myth Drannor]] alongside the brave [[Vaasan]] warrior [[Vala Thorsdotter]]. Calig, Elar, and Parth Gal all fell to traps set by the elves centuries prior to protect their catacombs from invaders.
