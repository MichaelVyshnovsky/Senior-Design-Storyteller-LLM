'''Nesterin Deirr''' was a [[star elf]] [[bard]] in the 1370s [[DR]] in [[Sildëyuir]].

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], Nesterin found [[House Aerilpe]] abandoned and infested by [[nilshai]]. He tried to return but during the voyage was attacked by two nilshai. He was saved by a timely meeting with [[Jorin Kell Harthan]] and [[Araevin Teshurr]]'s party. He offered them hospitality inside the [[House Deirr]] palace.

Later, he joined Araevin's party in their search for the [[Gatekeeper's Crystal|Gatekeeper crystal]].

He was greatly injured inside the [[Waymeet]] fighting [[Malkizid]] and his [[yugoloth]] servants in order to gain time for Araevin to use the Gatekeeper.
