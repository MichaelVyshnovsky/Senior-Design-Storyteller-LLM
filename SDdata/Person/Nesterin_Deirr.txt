Nesterin Deirr was a star elf bard in the 1370s DR in SildÃ«yuir.
In 1374 DR, Nesterin found House Aerilpe abandoned and infested by nilshai. He tried to return but during the voyage was attacked by two nilshai. He was saved by a timely meeting with Jorin Kell Harthan and Araevin Teshurrs party. He offered them hospitality inside the House Deirr palace.
Later, he joined Araevins party in their search for the Gatekeeper crystal.
He was greatly injured inside the Waymeet fighting Malkizid and his yugoloth servants in order to gain time for Araevin to use the Gatekeeper.
