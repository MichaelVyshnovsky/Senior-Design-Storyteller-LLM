        "mainbody": "'''Grannoc''' was an [[anchorite of Talos]] who grew and nurtured a [[Gulthias tree]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Grannoc was a [[half-orc]] who dressed in [[hide armor]] and was a devout follower of [[Talos]], the god of storms. He was known to perform eerie dances while invoking his god, and to become enraged if anyone dared to interrupt him.",
        "Abilities": "As an anchorite of Talos, Grannoc was blessed by his god with storm-themed [[spell]]s, including the ability to cast ''[[lightning bolt]]'', and was also a [[shapechanger]] who could adopt the form of a [[boar]]. Thanks to his connection with the Gulthias tree he had nurtured, Grannoc also possessed the unique ability to command any [[blight]]s spawned from the tree.",
        "Possessions": "Grannoc was the only member of the anchorites of Talos known to keep a map that marked the location of their headquarters at the sacred [[Circle of Thunder]] in southern [[Neverwinter Wood]].",
        "History": "During the late 15{{th}} century DR, Grannoc was a member of the anchorites of Talos who venerated their god's servant, [[Gorthok|Gorthok the Thunder Boar]], at the Circle of Thunder.\n\nAt some point not long before the arrival of the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] in the [[Sword Coast North|region]], Grannoc travelled to the ruins of the [[Woodland Manse]] not far from the Circle of Thunder, and planted a Gulthias tree at the bottom of the well. and several were sent back to the Circle of Thunder to bolster the site's defenses. Meanwhile, three more anchorites joined Grannoc at the Woodland Manse to oversee the raising of [[pumpkin]]s and boars for the organization's food supply and [[ritual]]s.\n\nAfter Cryovain drove the [[orc]]s from [[Icespire Hold]] in the [[Sword Mountains]], many sought refuge with the anchorites. A contingent took up residence in the Woodland Manse under Grannoc's supervision, and alongside his blights, they used the ruin as a staging ground to launch attacks on [[Neverwinter]] hunters at [[Falcon's hunting lodge]]. Grannoc himself remained at the Manse, and performed profane rituals involving the consumption of [[possum]] entrails to beseech Talos for aid in destroying the hunters."
