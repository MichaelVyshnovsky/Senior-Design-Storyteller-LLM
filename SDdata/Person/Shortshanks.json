        "mainbody": "hortshanks was a dwarf and the owner of the Bold Bard tavern in the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nBad tempered and humorless, given to making sour comments under his breath or above it, and answering greetings with a grunt or nothing at all, he made a poor host,\nNevertheless, Shortshanks ran the Bold Bard quite ably, and didnt water down the drinks or skimp on their quality. He was aided by long-suffering barmaid Sunfirth.\nHe broke up brawls with the aid of his oak mallet, which weighed some .\nHe had a good memory, which he was proud of and ready to show off when challenged.\nShortshanks inherited the Bold Bard from a jovial gnome who, on his passing, bequeathed it in his will to the decidedly non-jovial dwarf, for the sole reason of trying to make him smile at last. In this, he completely failed.\nWhen a rival tavern, the Swamp Rat, opened outside of Ghars in the , it immediately stole customers and business from the Bold Bard. This angered Shortshanks, who complained of the Rats poor-quality, watered-down drinks. However, sightings of the ghost of the bandit chieftain Fastred caused the Swamp Rats business to drop off sharply as customers went back to the Bold Bard.\nThe night of Eleint 16 proved a busy one for Shortshanks. First, Jasper visited to purchase a cask of clarry for his master Benelaius. The next notable arrival was the adventuress Kendra, and when Dovo and then Grodoveth tried it on with her, she drove them off herself, with Shortshanks ordering Dovo out. Such events might be an unremarkable evening, but they would lead to a series of deathsâ€”Dovos and Grodoveths.\nAfter Dovo was murdered and exposed as faking the ghost sightings on the morning of Eleint 17, retired War Wizard Benelaius bade Jasper pass another evening at the Bold Bard to begin his investigation. Making use of Shortshanks prodigious memory, Jasper spoke with him to get a list of dates of the ghost sightings. Shortshanks feared people would go back to the Swamp Rat, but was optimistic that theyd fear the murderer more. Jasper later discovered Dovos cloak and hat stashed in the cleaning closet, and stole them. When Jasper threw a piece of cheese at Rolf and triggered a fight, Shortshanks tossed Rolf out of the Bold Bard and yelled at Jasper. Finally, Jasper released some mice hed found in the cleaning closet for a distraction and, while Sunfirth and Shortshanks hunted mice, he stole the taverns accounts book for the investigation. Unfortunately, this stunt drove the customers out and to the Swamp Rat and elsewhere for the evening.\nExamining the evidence later, Benelaius, Lindavar, and Jasper theorized that the presence of Dovos clothes implied hed been using the Bold Bard as his base for posing as the ghost, and furthermore that Shortshanks was in on it, for the purpose of driving business away from the Swamp Rat. From the accounts book, they correlated Grodoveths visits and the ghost sightings, but found nothing shady in Shortshankss dealings. They later discounted Shortshanks from their investigation most likely, Tobald or Grodoveth had planted Dovos clothes in the tavern to shift focus to the Bold Bard and away the Swamp Rat, which they were using for their spying ring.\nAfter the Merchants Guilds welcoming dinner, in the small hours of Eleint 20, Shortshanks was forced by the Purple Dragons to go with other townsfolk to Benelaiuss cottage, where he would expose the murderer of Dovo and Grodoveth. Shortshanks was outraged to be missing a night of good business, but Captain Flim intimidated him into complying. Shortshanks was cleared of involvement, but Benelaius revealed a plot by the Iron Throne to poison the Grand Council, and even the whole town, with blackweed put in the water supply by Mayor Tobald. It left Shortshanks feeling queasy until it was revealed the plot had already been foiled."
