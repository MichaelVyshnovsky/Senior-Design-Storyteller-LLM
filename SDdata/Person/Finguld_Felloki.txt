Finguld Boomer Felloki was a frost giant warrior in the late 15th century DR.
Finguld was one of the most trusted warriors of Jarl Fimmel Orelson.
In 1485 DR, during the late stages of the War of the Silver Marches, Finguld was with his jarl when Fimmel finally understood that the drow had deceived him about the brothers of the giant god Thrym and decided to stop his war with Luruar.
