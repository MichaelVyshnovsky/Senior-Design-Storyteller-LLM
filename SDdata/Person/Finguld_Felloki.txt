'''Finguld Boomer Felloki''' was a [[frost giant]] warrior in the late 15th century [[DR]].

==History==
Finguld was one of the most trusted warriors of Jarl [[Fimmel Orelson]].

In [[1485 DR]], during the late stages of the [[War of the Silver Marches]], Finguld was with his jarl when Fimmel finally understood that the [[drow]] had deceived him about the brothers of the giant god [[Thrym]] and decided to stop his war with [[Luruar]].
