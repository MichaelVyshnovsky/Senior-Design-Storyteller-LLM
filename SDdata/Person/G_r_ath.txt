{{Quote|''I see they're letting even istik mercenaries in these days.''|Raider G'r'ath}}

==Description==
G'r'ath had typical skin and spot coloration of her kin. She had high brown hair and had painted or [[tattoo]]ed eyes and eyebrows. She wore almost no armor, apart from a pauldron and bracers of githyanki design. As a Raider, G'r'ath was armed with a [[heavy crossbow]].

==History==
Raider G'r'ath, along with other [[gith]] of what would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the [[Rosymorn Monastery]] of [[Lathander]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in [[Faerûn]] shifted in balance. During that time, G'r'ath was placed to stand guard in the Crèche's hatchery and its youths' caretaker [[Varsh Ko'kuu]]. Raider G'r'ath showed disdain for any non-gith ''istik'' if they were allowed access to Crèche Y'llek.
