Zhora Hallen was a drow explorer and hunter of Menzoberranzan in the late 15 century DR.
Zhora was very close to her daughter Hanne. Her family were allies of House Mizzrym.
Zhora led the Dark Hunters, a group of ten drow explorers who normally hunted for purple worm eggs in the Wormwrithings in order to sell them to wizards in the city.
Circa 1486 DR, Hanne went on an egg run with Zhora and the Dark Hunters in the Wormwrithings, but the passage of a purple worm separated her from the group. Zhora believed her daughter dead and was greatly worried but continued the hunt.
