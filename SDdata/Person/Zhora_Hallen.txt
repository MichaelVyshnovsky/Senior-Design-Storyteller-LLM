'''Zhora Hallen''' was a [[drow]] explorer and hunter of [[Menzoberranzan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationship==
Zhora was very close to her daughter [[Hanne Hallen|Hanne]]. Her family were allies of [[House Mizzrym]].

==Activities==
Zhora led the [[Dark Hunters]], a group of ten drow explorers who normally hunted for [[purple worm]] eggs in the [[Wormwrithings]] in order to sell them to [[wizard]]s in the city.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Hanne went on an egg run with Zhora and the Dark Hunters in the Wormwrithings, but the passage of a purple worm separated her from the group. Zhora believed her daughter dead and was greatly worried but continued the hunt.
