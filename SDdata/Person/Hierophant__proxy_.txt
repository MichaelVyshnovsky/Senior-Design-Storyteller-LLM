The Hierophant was a half-elf druid and proxy of the power known as Silvanus.
The Hierophants primary passion in life was nature and her deity Silvanus, to a degree that one could call fanatical. There was a gleam in her eyes whenever she spoke of them, which was most of the time.
In addition to having druidic powers, Silvanus granted the Hierophant the ability to transform herself into any animal or tree that shes seen within his divine realm of Summeroak.
The Hierophant spent most of her time wandering the woodlands of the divine realm known as Tir na Og, looking for those who might appreciate the wild beauty of Summeroak.
