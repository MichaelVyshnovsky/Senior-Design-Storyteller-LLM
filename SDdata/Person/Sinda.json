        "mainbody": "Sister Sinda was an undead nurse who worked alongside Malus Thorm, a servant of the goddess Shar, of the House of Healing in the town of Reithwin throughout the 15 century DR.\nSinda was a pale-skinned, shambling, undead creature of some sentience. Like other sisters, she was dressed in the elaborate garb of a nurse with a headdress that covered the creatures eyes, leaving only her necrotic lips and cheeks exposed.\nLike other sisters, Anya was armed with a scalpel and had the ability to release a mind screech – a powerful psionic attack that clawed at and damaged the living creatures souls.\nSister Sinda lived in the town of Reithwin in the Western Heartlands before its fall sometime before the . During that time, Sinda and other sisters performed healing and various medical procedures in Reithwins House of Healing. The nurses entertained themselves by making wagers on what sorts of foreign objects they would extract after being lodged in their patients backside orifice. Sindas bets included a wine bottle, childrens doll, and her highest bet – a simple quill.\nAt some point during the towns fall into dark worship of Shar or after the Shadow-cursed Lands consumed Reithwin in the late 14 century DR, Sister Sinda perished and was changed by the dark Shadowfell magic. As of the late 15 century DR, Malus Thorm and his nurses operated out of the House of Healing in the Shadow-cursed lands. They spent their unlives \"experimenting\" on innocents that either wandered, or were brought against their will, into his hospital. Malus attempted to teach his Sister the finer arts of what he called surgery but was ultimately unsuccessful. Unlike the other undead nurses, Sinda was tasked not with \"healing\" procedures but with the hospitals front desk.\nSister Sindas fate after turning undead remained unconfirmed. She couldve been slain by the True Heroes of Baldurs Gate during their quest to stop the Cult of the Absolute or left in peace in the shadow-consumed House of Healing."
