        "mainbody": "'''Sister Sinda''' was an [[undead]] nurse who worked alongside [[Malus Thorm]], a servant of the goddess [[Shar]], of the [[House of Healing (Reithwin)|House of Healing]] in the town of [[Reithwin]] throughout the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''Here to see the doctor? Are we poorly? Are we desperately poorly? Not so well. But well enough to wait. Join the line, and you will be seen.''|Sister Sinda}}",
        "Description": "Sinda was a pale-skinned, shambling, undead creature of some sentience. Like other sisters, she was dressed in the elaborate garb of a nurse with a headdress that covered the creature's eyes, leaving only her necrotic lips and cheeks exposed.",
        "Abilities": "Like other sisters, Anya was armed with a [[scalpel]] and had the ability to release a ''mind screech'' – a powerful psionic attack that clawed at and damaged the living creatures' souls.",
        "History": "Sister Sinda lived in the town of Reithwin in the [[Western Heartlands]] before its fall sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1394}}. During that time, Sinda and other sisters performed healing and various medical procedures in Reithwin's House of Healing. The nurses entertained themselves by making wagers on what sorts of foreign objects they would extract after being lodged in their patients' backside orifice. Sinda's bets included a [[wine]] bottle, children's doll, and her highest bet – a simple [[quill]].\n\nAt some point during the town's fall into dark worship of Shar or after the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] consumed Reithwin in the late 14{{th}} century DR, Sister Sinda perished and was changed by the dark [[Shadowfell]] magic. As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Malus Thorm and his nurses operated out of the House of Healing in the Shadow-cursed lands. They spent their unlives \"experimenting\" on innocents that either wandered, or were brought against their will, into his hospital. Malus attempted to teach his Sister the finer arts of what he called surgery but was ultimately unsuccessful. Unlike the other undead nurses, Sinda was tasked not with \"healing\" procedures but with the hospital's front desk.\n\nSister Sinda's fate after turning undead remained unconfirmed. She could've been slain by the [[True Heroes of Baldur's Gate]] during their quest to stop the [[Cult of the Absolute]] or left in peace in the shadow-consumed House of Healing."
