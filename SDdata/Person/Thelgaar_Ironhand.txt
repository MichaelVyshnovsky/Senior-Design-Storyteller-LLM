Thelgaar Ironhand was the king of Omans Isle, in the center of the Moonshae Isles.
In 1345 DR, Grunnarch the Red brought his host of longships to Thelgaar Ironhands Iron Keep on Omans Isle to prepare an attack on the southern Moonshae Isles. In the first council of northern Kings and Captains, Thelgaar announced his intention of making long lasting peace with the Ffolk and start a prosperous trading relationship. Most of the warriors that were present did not agree and decided to continue with the plan of raiding and pillaging the cities of Caer Corwell and Caer Callidyrr and the rest of the Ffolk lands. The same night, Thelgar was slain by Kazgoroth who took the identity of the king and carried on with the plan to attack Caer Corwell.
He was buried in a cairn within the Old Stone Wood.
Thelgaar wielded an enchanted greatsword called Ironhands Reckoning.
