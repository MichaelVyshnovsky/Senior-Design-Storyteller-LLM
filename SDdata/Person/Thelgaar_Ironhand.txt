'''Thelgaar Ironhand''' was the king of [[Oman's Isle]], in the center of the [[Moonshae Isles]].

==History==
In [[1345 DR]], [[Grunnarch]] the Red brought his host of [[longship]]s to Thelgaar Ironhand's Iron Keep on Oman's Isle to prepare an attack on the southern [[Moonshae Isles]]. In the first council of northern Kings and Captains, Thelgaar announced his intention of making long lasting peace with the [[Ffolk]] and start a prosperous trading relationship. Most of the warriors that were present did not agree and decided to continue with the plan of raiding and pillaging the cities of [[Caer Corwell]] and [[Caer Callidyrr]] and the rest of the Ffolk lands. The same night, Thelgar was slain by [[Kazgoroth]] who took the identity of the king and carried on with the plan to attack Caer Corwell.

He was buried in a [[Cairn of Thelgaar Ironhand|cairn]] within the [[Old Stone Wood]].

==Possessions==
Thelgaar wielded an enchanted [[greatsword]] called ''[[Ironhand's Reckoning]]''.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|11}}
