Garrod Phipps was a human resident of Eveningstar in Cormyr during the mid-1480s DR.
Garrod had light skin and medium-length dark brown hair, tied back. His outfit included an extensive belt of pouches.
Around the time of the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, Garrod worked as a craftsman in Eveningstar. He was quite thrilled to have seen the famous Elminster, despite the circumstances.
