Chaver Tegarech was an aide to First Speaker Tessarin Alaurun in Nesmé. In 1374 DR he rode from Nesmé to check upon a watchpost at Morach Tor and was kidnapped by the Khoroshen tribe of lizardfolk, who had been hired to protect the town against attack from giants and trolls. The lizardfolk betrayed Alaurun and Nesmé. Tegarech overheard a conversation between the lizardfolk and the trolls, to decide upon how to split Nesmé and its surrounding lands, and was captured.
