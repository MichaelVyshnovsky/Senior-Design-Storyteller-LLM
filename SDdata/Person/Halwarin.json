        "mainbody": "'''Halwarin''' was a priest of [[Bane]] and member of the [[Zhentarim]] who led the [[Holy Keep of Bane]] in the city of [[Bral]] on the [[Rock of Bral]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "A former adventurer, Halwarin established the Holy Keep in the mid-1300s [[DR]]. He was committed to spreading the Banite faith to the stars, but after eight years it remained a lesser faith in Bral, and this was not aided by the god himself being inconveniently dead.\n\nNevertheless, in the 1360s DR members of the [[Tenth Pit]] on Bral contacted Halwarin; they sought to use the Banite faith to gain power, but Halwarin would not yoke Bane's cause to theirs."
