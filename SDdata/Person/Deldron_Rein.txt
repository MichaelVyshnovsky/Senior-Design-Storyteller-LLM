'''Deldron Rein''' was a wealthy merchant of the [[Rein]] family of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/A Fellowship Rises}}

==Activities==
He was the owner (but not manager) of properties such as the [[Red Boar Inn]]<ref><ref> and the leader of the [[Red Boar Trading Coster]]. His preferred caravan captain in the coster was [[Geveral Telkku]].<ref>

He also engaged in a number of lumbering ventures in the Delimbiyr Vale, though some, particularly local [[elves]], raised concerns about them.

==Relationships==
Deldron had a number of children, including his daughter [[Jesym Rein|Jesym]], the traitor, and his son [[Stedd Rein|Stedd]], the youngest.

==History==
When his son Stedd returned from the [[College of War]] in [[Athkatla]] in the {{yearlinkName|1369}}, while he was still ''en route'' to Loudwater, Deldron departed the city to greet his son and conduct business in [[Daggerford]], taking the Red Boar Trading Coster's sizeable guard with him. But a magical communication from Loudwater alerted Deldron about a vicious [[lycanthrope]] attack, known as the [[Night of the Blood Moon]], and the Reins and their Red Boars hastened to return. Deldron sent Stedd ahead with half his forces while he followed close behind. When Deldron arrived in the aftermath, he heard many praising his son for his heroism and leadership, and was pleased. It also improved the Rein name, erasing the earlier memory of Jesym's treachery.
