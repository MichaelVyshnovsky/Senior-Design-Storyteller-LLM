Werz Saltbaron was a duergar merchant in Gracklstugh in the late 15 century DR.
Werz was a merchant with dealings with some corrupt officials like Gorglak.
Circa 1486 DR, in Mantol-Derith, Werz met the deep gnome alchemist Kazook Pickshine and the two started a gem-trading business without their superiors knowledge.
Later, for unknown reasons, Werz was targeted by the notorious Empty-Scabbard Killers and asked for the help of an adventuring party that had escaped the drow of Velkynvelve.
