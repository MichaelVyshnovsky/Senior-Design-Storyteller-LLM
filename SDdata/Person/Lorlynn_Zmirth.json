While searching separately inside the Obstacle Course level, however, the Netherskull killed Elvilac. Lorlynn was unaware of this and still awaited the return of her brother. If she learned about the death of Elvilac, she would try to recover his body and reanimate him as an undead.\nLorlynn hated all people apart from her brother."
