'''Galvena''' was a guildmistress who had many [[slavery|enslaved]] [[courtesan (prostitute)|courtesans]] under her control. She lived in [[Brynnlaw]], and conducted business in her festhall.

==Description==
Lady Galvena was exceptionally cruel, and forced many young denizens of Brynnlaw into servitude and slavery. She would force them to do many despicable acts, and would control every aspect of her lives. She had the company of a "pet" wizard, named [[Vadek]] and employed several guards, who were lead by [[Rerdes]]. When in a combat situation, she wielded a mace and equipped leather armor. She hired many "masters" and would give them medallions to show their purpose to others.

==History==

In 1369, the guildmistress found out that one of her slaves, [[Claire]], had wished to marry a local merchant named [[Sanik]]. They wished to elope, but this never came to fruition. Instead, Lady Galvena sent an assassin after her husband-to-be, and in the meanwhile, tortured Claire herself. She decided to sentence Claire to death, to make an example of her to the other courtesans.

==Rumors==
It was rumored that many of courtesan slaves wished to leave or revolt against Lady Galvena. Among these were [[Ginia]] and Claire.
