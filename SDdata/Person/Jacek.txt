'''Jacek''' was a soldier and a member the [[Flaming Fist]] that served the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He had a long-time friendship with his fellow soldier [[Ephren]]. It was she that originally convinced Jacek to join the Fist.

He also had a daughter named [[Molly]], who was cared for by [[Cora Highberry]] at [[Highberry's Home]] for orphans.

==History==
Jacek was killed while accompanying Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]] along the [[Risen Road]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Ravengard and a contingent of Fist soldiers were staying at [[Waukeen's Rest]] when the inn was raided and set aflame by a combined [[goblin]] and [[drow]] force associated with the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. While the soldiers killed many of the cultists, Duke Ravengard was ultimately abducted, and Jacek paid the ultimate price for carrying out his duties.
