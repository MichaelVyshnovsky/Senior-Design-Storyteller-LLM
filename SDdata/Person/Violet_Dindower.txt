Violet Dindower was a halfling cook and smuggler who worked aboard a spelljammer.
Violet had light skin and reddish-brown hair. She dressed in a low-cut brown tunic, and wore several pieces of jewelry.
She truly enjoyed her line of work. In addition to granting her a decent income, it provided her with enough risks to "keep life spicy."
Violet carried five packets of dust of disappearance,
She also owned a short sword +1, and a suit of leather armor +2.
Violet was dissatisfied with trying to eke out a living in Waterdeep. When a spelljammer stopped for repairs in the city, Violet jumped at the chance to sign on as a cook.
Her stealthy eliminations of unwanted guests endeared Violet to the ships captain on many occasions.
