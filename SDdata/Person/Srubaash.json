        "mainbody": "ing Srubaash was the goblin ruler of the Neidlig tribe in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nSrubaash led his tribe with cunning and diplomacy, forming alliances with other communities and avoiding warfare whenever possible. His ultimate intent was to build a realm similar to Hlundadim, unifying goblins, orcs, and other humanoids. Thanks to his successes and belief in his grand destiny, he styled himself King, rather than Chieftain of his tribe.\nSrubaash claimed to have been visited by a mysterious spirit that urged him to rebuild the ancient realm of Hlundadim. Following this experience, he began assembling an increasingly expansive multi-racial realm, making Neidlig the largest and most powerful force in the Goblin Marches by the 1360s DR."
