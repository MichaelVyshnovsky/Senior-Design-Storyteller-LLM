        "mainbody": "Wizard\nBarbanas was a wizard in the mortal world for a period of time, but lived a second life of sorts as a flameskull after his death. He dwelled on the plane of Avernus in the Nine Hells, under the dominion of the night hag Mad Maggie.\nBy and large, Barnabas was as self-important in undeath as he was magically powerful in life. While he was forgetful he had periodic great insights and recalled profound arcane knowledge from his previous existence.\nAfter his death as a mortal, the wizard Barnabas skull was stolen from his tomb by one of his rivals. It was then turned into his newer form of a flameskull.\nBarnabas rival later formed an infernal pact with Mad Maggie, a night hag from Avernus, and offered up Barnabas as part of the deal. Barnabas was brought into the Knucklebones Gang, a motley band that included other fiends, kenkus, imps and redcaps.\nBarnabas was tormented by the gangs redcaps, but was too humiliated too complain. Around the , Barnabas lost a tooth when one of the fey hurled a metal gear at his jaw, causing him to whistle whenever he spoke."
