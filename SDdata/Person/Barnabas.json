        "mainbody": "'''Barbanas''' was a [[wizard]] in the mortal world for a period of time, but lived a second life of sorts as a [[flameskull]] after his death. He dwelled on the plane of [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]], under the dominion of the [[night hag]] [[Mad Maggie]].",
        "Description": "By and large, Barnabas was as self-important in [[undeath]] as he was [[magic]]ally powerful in life. While he was forgetful he had periodic great insights and recalled profound arcane knowledge from his previous existence.",
        "History": "After his death as a mortal, the wizard Barnabas' skull was stolen from his tomb by one of his rivals. It was then turned into his newer form of a flameskull.\n\nBarnabas' rival later formed an infernal pact with Mad Maggie, a night hag from Avernus, and offered up Barnabas as part of the deal. Barnabas was brought into the [[Knucklebones Gang]], a motley band that included other [[fiend]]s, [[kenku]]s, [[imp]]s and [[redcap]]s.\n\nBarnabas was tormented by the gang's redcaps, but was too humiliated too complain. Around the {{YearlinkName|1494}}, Barnabas lost a tooth when one of the [[fey]] hurled a metal gear at his jaw, causing him to whistle whenever he spoke."
