'''Barus Broadblade''' was the leader of the guards for the slaver ring hidden in the [[Oasis of the White Palm]]. Shortly after the release of [[Khalitharius]], during {{yearlink|1356}}, he had been captured by the dervish cultists of the oasis for interrogation.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|76}}

==History==
Barus had been captured by the dervish cultists at least seven days after the princess disappeared;{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|66}} he spent three of those days being interrogated in the dungeon, where he learned the dervishes did not hold the princess. After his release, Barus would remain suspicious, trying to flee his rescuers at the first possible opportunity.

==Rumors & Legends==
Though he had not been the one making the contact, he knew the dervishes had contacted the slavers, looking to kidnap the princess. He had since learned that the dervish cult had been contacted by an [[efreet]], to whom the princess was probably somehow a threat; he had also learned that the efreet's stronghold was in the [[Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak]].
