'''Cierre''' was a female [[drow]] [[ranger]] who wandered the [[Silver Marches]] around the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. 

==Description==
The ranger was 5 ft 9 in (1.8 m) tall which was quite tall for a drow. Cierre had an athletic build due to her time spent living in the wild. Her eyes were a pale amber color, which turn almost orange when she was angry.

==Personality==
She was usually calm and non-threatening, curious about the affairs of others but somewhat reserved when she was the subject of the conversation. Claiming she was inspired by the story of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], she left the [[Underdark]] to become a ranger in his footsteps. In truth, Cierre was a spy for the dark elves of [[Menzoberranzan]].

==Possessions==
Living in the wild, Cierre wore a suit of magical ''+1 [[studded leather armor]]'' and a ''[[cloak of elvenkind]]''. When in battle, she fought with an enchanted ''+1 [[longsword]]'' and a fine crafted [[handaxe]]. If she attacked her foes from afar, Cierre used an exceptional [[shortbow]] with magic [[arrow]]s.

==History==
Every 45 days, Cierre would travel to a secret spot in the [[Nether Mountains]] to report to contacts from Menzoberranzan.
