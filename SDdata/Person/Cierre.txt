Cierre was a female drow ranger who wandered the Silver Marches around the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. 
The ranger was 5 ft 9 in (1.8 m) tall which was quite tall for a drow. Cierre had an athletic build due to her time spent living in the wild. Her eyes were a pale amber color, which turn almost orange when she was angry.
She was usually calm and non-threatening, curious about the affairs of others but somewhat reserved when she was the subject of the conversation. Claiming she was inspired by the story of Drizzt DoUrden, she left the Underdark to become a ranger in his footsteps. In truth, Cierre was a spy for the dark elves of Menzoberranzan.
Living in the wild, Cierre wore a suit of magical +1 studded leather armor and a cloak of elvenkind. When in battle, she fought with an enchanted +1 longsword and a fine crafted handaxe. If she attacked her foes from afar, Cierre used an exceptional shortbow with magic arrows.
Every 45 days, Cierre would travel to a secret spot in the Nether Mountains to report to contacts from Menzoberranzan.
