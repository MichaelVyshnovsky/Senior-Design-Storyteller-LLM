He then reported, to the duke's displeasure, that no one in [[Reth]] or [[Westgate]] was forthcoming to take on the assignment to find the mysterious Slayer. And then, to even more of the duke's displeasure, he reported the [[Harpers]] had taken an interest in the matter, and would be reporting to him before the end of the season. He then helped the Duke come to terms with the fact he was in a bad situation and the best he could do was wait."
