Khlerat was an inhabitant of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Although retired by the mid-1360s DR, Khlerat kept busy by acting (or dabbling) as the towns unofficial master of public works.
By the start of autumn in the , Ghars was suffering a drought, having gone tendays without rain, and many wells dried up. What water remained was stored in a newly built public cistern that Khlerat maintained and guarded.
On the night of Eleint 20, Khlerat was collected by the local Purple Dragons for a midnight meeting at Benelaiuss cottage regarding the recent murders of Dovo and Grodoveth Khlerat drove a carriage for himself and the librarian Phelos Marmwitz. There, Benelaius revealed a plot to poison the towns water supply and the visiting Merchants Guild with blackweed. Khlerat revealed that Mayor Tobald was the only other person to have access to the cistern, having asked to inspect it that day.
He seemed respectful, or fearful, of authority but was not without indignation if suggested to have failed in his duty.
He was aged and had shortsightedness.
