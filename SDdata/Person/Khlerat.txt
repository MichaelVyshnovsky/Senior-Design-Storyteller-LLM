'''Khlerat''' was an inhabitant of the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Although retired by the mid-1360s DR, Khlerat kept busy by acting (or dabbling) as the town's unofficial master of public works.

==History==
By the start of autumn in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Ghars was suffering a drought, having gone [[tenday]]s without rain, and many wells dried up. What water remained was stored in a newly built public cistern that Khlerat maintained and guarded.

On the night of [[Eleint 20]], Khlerat was collected by the local [[Purple Dragon]]s for a midnight meeting at [[Benelaius]]'s cottage regarding the recent murders of [[Dovo]] and [[Grodoveth]]; Khlerat drove a carriage for himself and the librarian [[Phelos Marmwitz]]. There, Benelaius revealed a plot to [[poison]] the town's water supply and the visiting [[Merchants' Guild]] with [[blackweed]]. Khlerat revealed that Mayor [[Tobald]] was the only other person to have access to the cistern, having asked to inspect it that day.

==Personality==
He seemed respectful, or fearful, of authority but was not without indignation if suggested to have failed in his duty.

==Description==
He was aged and had shortsightedness.
