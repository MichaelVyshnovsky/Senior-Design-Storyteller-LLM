'''Orbakh''' was a great [[necromancer]] of [[Myth Drannor]] who resided with his brethren in the [[Tower of Bones]] in the city's [[Polyandrium]] before the [[Weeping War]].

==Possessions==
Orbakh possessed many precious ''[[spellbook]]s'' and personal valuables that all were entombed with him inside [[Crypt of Orbakh|his crypt]]. Among more mundane items were a [[gold]] skeletal mask, eighth [[silver]] [[ring]]s all decorated with skull signets, and an intricate necklace of white gold, his failed and empty ''[[phylactery]]'' (a crystal encased inside a steel, [[platinum]], and gold cage).

Among more notable enchanted items that Orbakh owned and was buried with were ''[[Orbakh's ivory scepter]]'' and ''[[Orbakh's bone mantle]]''.

==History==
Orbakh lived and died in the years that predated the advent of the Weeping War that destroyed the City of Song. He was one of the most powerful and ambitious necromancers of the Tower of Bones. Reaching older age, Orbakh was looking for a way to prolong his existence via magic and, eventually attempted the ritual of turning himself into a ''[[lich]]''. The ritual failed, killing the [[wizard]] in the process. The fellow necromancers constructed a crypt in the Polyandrium that fit the dead wizard's status, and interred his body along with his empty failed ''phylactery''.

At the time of Orbakh's interment, the wizards of the Tower of Bones decided to use the [[Crypt of Orbakh|crypt]] as a prison and death sentence for a recently disgraced member [[Famras]]. The disgraced wizard was thrown into the crypt and sealed inside. This eventually turned the crypt into a lair of a [[deepspawn]] that Famras smuggled in along with himself.
