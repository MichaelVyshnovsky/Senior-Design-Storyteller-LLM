        "mainbody": "adventurer\nGorstag of Highmoon was an adventurer in the early 14 century DR, and the innkeeper of the The Rising Moon inn in Deepingdale since. He was the foster father of Shandril Shessair.\nGorstag loved night snacks, and strong cheeses. He had many tales to tell of Deepingdales early days and his own adventuring exploits both.\nHe had kind, jovial eyes.\nHe favored the battle-ax. Even in his later years, he was handy with the axe and kept the peace in the inn.\nGorstag was the innkeeper in the Rising Moon from around  for at least close to 30 years.\nGorstag married Lureene, one of his employees. Other employees of his included Shandril Shessair, his adoptive daughter whom he tried to provide with a normal life, the late cook Korvan, and Rhiia Duskmantle, who later replaced Korvan. He had adventured with Dammasae.\nGorstag was the owner of the Rising Moon inn. At the end of his adventuring career, he owned some gems.\nGorstag had an amulet that blocked several forms of detection, almost certainly an Amulet of proof against detection and location, taken from a necromancer he had slain. He also owned a Luck medallion of Tymora.\nGorstag had adventured together with Dammasae. He described adventuring pains as forgettable.\nAfter Dammasae gave birth to her daughter Shandril in Elturel, she remained there for eight months before departing for Shadowdale. Gorstag accompanied the family in the trip, but the group was ambushed at the Bridge of Fallen Men. Garthond died Dammasae and Gorstag were both heavily injured, and though he sought healing at High Horn, it was too late to save Dammasae. He and the infant Shandril were ultimately the only survivors. The responsibility of hiding her fell squarely on him. Gorstag took the baby to Deepingdale, hoping to leave her with the elves and make for the Tower Tranquil, where hed loot Garthonds belongings for Shandril to have the elves warned him the Tower was now a Cult redoubt, annexed into the lair of Rauglothgor. Instead, he bought an old inn, once belonging to his father, counting on his relative obscurity to hide him from the Cult.\nWhile in the position of innkeeper and Shandrils tutor, Gorstag had once taken on Shandril on the bet she could not consume a great blandreth of soup by herself. He taught Shandril of innkeeping trade.\nIn Mirtul 6 of the , Gorstag broke a fight when the visiting Company of the Bright Spear lost its thief, Lynxal, slain while pickpocketing a local man, Ghondarrath. The next morning, Shandril ran off with the Company of the Bright Blade, leaving a note behind. Per Elminster, Gorstag was quite pained by that.  During that time, one of his maids, Lureene, became close to him, hoping to ease his pain. Gorstag spoke at length with Narm during that evening, learning of Shandrils foes, and explained at length what he knew of her parents. He offered Shandril an amulet protecting against detection and location, which she accepted.\nHowever, his cook, Korvan, was a member of the Cult of the Dragon, and informed on Shandrils arrival Gorstag had to slay the man, just as the newlyweds had left the inn. He later fought off and slew Sintre, a Malaugrym impersonating a priestess of Oghma. The events took place over the next day, Flamerule 9.\nUnknown to him, Shandril later briefly scried on him while he was together with Lureene, to no greater consequence, at some point before her next contact He received another contact from her later that month, close to or on Flamerule 22, after Shandril destroyed the Wizards Tower in the Citadel of the Raven, learning that Shandril was with child. After Shandrils immolation and death on Flamerule 27,\nDecades later, Gorstag was considering expanding the inn. By that point he studiously avoided saying anything about Shandril recently, a secret shaft was discovered beneath his establishment.\nGorstag told that the amulet of proof against detection and location he kept was pilfered from an evil necromancer, whose brother was beat to death by an 8-year old armed who drew him out of his tower by throwing rocks at the window. He didnt elaborate.\nSome rumors flew that Gorstag may have been Shandrils father.\nPer Volothamp Geddarm, Gorstag said he had met the Deeping Princess, but he wasnt anywhere near old enough for that. Also according to Volo, someone had rented the hidden space recently discovered beneath the inn, but Gorstag would not say who."
