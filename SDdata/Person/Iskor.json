        "History": "The [[illithid]] [[Vestress]] of [[Ascarle]] bargained an agreement with Iskor and she provided the illithid with some extraplanar creatures like some [[nereid]]s.\n\nIn [[1361 DR]], the archmage [[Gromph Baenre]] summoned Iskor and convinced [[Shakti Hunzrin]] to bargain an agreement with her in order to locate [[Liriel Baenre]]. Shakti agreed. Using the water ways, Iskor went to Ascarle and reported the conversation to Vestress, proposing to add the [[drow]] to the agents of the [[Kraken Society]]. Vestress liked the idea and Iskor explained that Shakti was in search of a renegade drow wizard, the same girl who was causing trouble to Vestress too.\n\nDuring the attack on [[Ruathym]], Iskor was sent to attack some [[water elemental]]s.",
