Ferla Treerunner (also seen as Ferla Treeclimber) was a wild elf who lived in the Forest of Amtar in northern Dambrath.
Ferla guided the Trunadar tribe as their shaman for over 300 years, through at least the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR.
The Trunadar people were in constant conflict with the Crinti of Dambrath, caused by the ingrained hatred between the elves and the drow.
