Xalyth, also known as Nal, was a female drow trader and fencer of gems and spell components in Menzoberranzan in 1370 DR.
Her fortune came from her relations with nine suppliers, from Ammryyr of Skullport, a male drow worshiper of Vhaeraun, to Ubelein Shubelith, a duergar of Underspires nicknamed "Fatreek".
Xalyth was fearless and fairly trustworthy. She had a sharp tongue, but was slow to anger. Her nickname was formed from the initials of "Not A Lady".
