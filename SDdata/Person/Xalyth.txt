'''Xalyth''', also known as '''Nal''', was a female [[drow]] trader and fencer of gems and spell components in [[Menzoberranzan]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Her fortune came from her relations with nine suppliers, from [[Amryyr Yauntyrr|Ammryyr]] of [[Skullport]], a male [[drow]] worshiper of [[Vhaeraun]], to [[Ubelein Shubelith]], a [[duergar]] of [[Underspires]] nicknamed "Fatreek".

==Personality==
Xalyth was fearless and fairly trustworthy. She had a sharp tongue, but was slow to anger. Her nickname was formed from the initials of '''"Not A Lady"'''.
