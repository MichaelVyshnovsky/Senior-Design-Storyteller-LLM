        "mainbody": "'''Saleska Mintharl''' was a [[human]] woman and a priestess of [[Tempus]]. She held the title \"Shield of Tempus\" and was a [[Merchant Duke]] of the city of [[Calaunt]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Saleska was formerly an [[adventurer|adventuress]] in [[Bellas's Band]], under [[Bellas Thanatar]]. Each member of the band grew wealthy by following Bellas's orders.\n\nAround the 1330s DR, Bellas's Band took power in the city of Calaunt. Bellas named himself [[Supreme Scepter]], while Saleska and the others took the title of Merchant Duke. They now grew wealthier and more powerful by following Bellas and supporting his rule.",
        "Activities": "Saleska and the dukes grew increasingly wealthy and powerful by following Bellas and supporting his rule. In all decisions on major policies, Saleska had one vote while Bellas had two.\n\nSaleska and the Dukes often confiscated property and magic from visitors, allegedly \"for the benefit of the city\", but mostly used it only for personal gain and use, to increase their power. They acquired a large collection of [[magical item]]s this way, and still sought more.\n\nSaleska lived in a palatial house close to the [[Fortress of the Five Vultures]]."
