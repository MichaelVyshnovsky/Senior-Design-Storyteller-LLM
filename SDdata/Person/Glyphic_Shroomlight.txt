Glyphic Shroomlight was a young deep gnome acolyte of Segojan Earthcaller in Blingdenstone in the late 15 century DR.
Glyphic was very nervous because he knew his position needed an older and more experienced priest.
Circa 1486 DR, Glyphic was assigned to run the recently reconsecrated Ruby in the Rough temple.
