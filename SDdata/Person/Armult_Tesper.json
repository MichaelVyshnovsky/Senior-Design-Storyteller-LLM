        "mainbody": "Armult Tesper was a noble and patriach of the Waterdhavian noble house Tesper during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nArmult trusted too easily, a trait that led to two failed marriages when he realized his wives were only after his coin. Unbeknownst to him, the ancestral ghosts of the family villa coerced the wives to leave him before causing too much harm.\nHe lived within Tespergates located at the corner of Mendever Street and Delzorin Street in the central section of Waterdeeps Sea Ward.\nHe spent much of his youth adventuring south of Waterdeep, earning his fathers respect.\nArmults current wife, a Harper named Nleera Tarannath Tesper, was discovered while masquerading as one of the ancestral ghosts of Tespergates during a party. Armult grew to love the Harper, and with the ghosts approval, eventually married her."
