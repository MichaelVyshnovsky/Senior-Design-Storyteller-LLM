Prayerboy Zorvxx was an unsavory dragonborn mercenary from the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Prayerboy was a dragonborn male with a sandy-brown coloration and burning orange eyes. He wore a simple breastplate and was armed with a wooden shield and a mace.
In the , opportunistic and immoral mercenary Aradin Beno set out to find the Nightsong for the mage Lorroakan. If the Nightsong, in reality a Sel√ªnite aasimar, was to reach the city of Baldurs Gate, then Beno had a band of mercenaries with questionable morals ready to attack those who sheltered her. Prayerboy Zorvxx was among those mercenaries, ready to break into the Elfsong Tavern to kill and kidnap.
