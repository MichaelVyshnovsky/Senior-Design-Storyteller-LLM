'''Prayerboy Zorvxx''' was an unsavory [[dragonborn]] mercenary from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Prayerboy was a dragonborn male with a sandy-brown coloration and burning orange eyes. He wore a simple [[breastplate]] and was armed with a wooden [[shield]] and a [[mace]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, opportunistic and immoral mercenary [[Aradin Beno]] set out to find the [[Nightsong]] for the [[mage]] [[Lorroakan]]. If the Nightsong, in reality a [[Sel√ªnite]] [[aasimar]], was to reach the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], then Beno had a band of mercenaries with questionable morals ready to attack those who sheltered her. Prayerboy Zorvxx was among those mercenaries, ready to break into the [[Elfsong Tavern]] to kill and kidnap.
