'''Qar Jysstev''' was Namarch on the [[Council of Five (Amn)|Council of Six]] in [[Amn]].

==Description==
He was a skinny man who tried to hide his bald spot with expensive wigs of [[ox|yoxen]] hair.

==Personality==
Qar advocated the use of the Council to progress Amnian trade, and wanted to introduce more trade goods from [[Maztica]] to the isolated northern areas of the nation, since this is more profitable, albeit riskier.

==History==
In [[1321 DR]], Qar became Lord of [[House Jysstev]] and later in [[1345 DR]], he was appointed Dahaunarch.  In [[1362 DR]], he was made Namarch on the Council of Six. His family fell into debt sold all their assets in [[Athkatla]] and [[Murann]]. Still high ranking, the Jysstev family moved to [[Eshpurta]], where they had allies and honor bound loyalists.
