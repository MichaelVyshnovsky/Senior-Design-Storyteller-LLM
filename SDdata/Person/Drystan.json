        "History": "Drystan and his sister [[Tegan]] were two farmers in the [[Dalelands]] until, around [[1481 DR]], they were captured in an [[orc]] raid. They were sold to the [[yugoloth]] [[Maram il Vass]] as a slave in its lair in the Deep Wastes.\n\n''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], they managed to escape but were in very poor condition until they met an adventuring party that saved Tegan. For Drystan, however, their escape had come too late and the torture had driven him mad. He shoved a stick in his ears, leaving him [[deaf]]."
