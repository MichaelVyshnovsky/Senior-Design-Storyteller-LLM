        "mainbody": "rystan was an escaped slave in the Deep Wastes in the late 15 century DR.\nDrystan and his sister Tegan were two farmers in the Dalelands until, around 1481 DR, they were captured in an orc raid. They were sold to the yugoloth Maram il Vass as a slave in its lair in the Deep Wastes.\nCirca 1486 DR, they managed to escape but were in very poor condition until they met an adventuring party that saved Tegan. For Drystan, however, their escape had come too late and the torture had driven him mad. He shoved a stick in his ears, leaving him deaf."
