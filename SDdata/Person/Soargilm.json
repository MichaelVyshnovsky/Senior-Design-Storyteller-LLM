        "mainbody": "'''Soargilm''' was a [[cleric]] and [[paladin]] of [[Ilmater]] who served as one of the [[Lords of Imphras II]], the advisory council that aided in the governance of [[Impiltur]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. As one of the elder lords of the realm, Soargilm offered his sage advice to the [[Sambryl|Queen-regent Sambryl]] in the years leading up to the coronation of [[Imbrar II|King Imbrar II]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}",
        "Description": "Soargilm was a man of good sense who became quite wise throughout his years of service to the kingdom. Despite his wealth of perspective, he largely retired from public life and seldom spoke during council meetings. He preferred to share his guidance with the Queen-regent directly acting alongside [[Rilimbraun]] as her personal advisers."
