        "mainbody": "Soargilm was a cleric and paladin of Ilmater who served as one of the Lords of Imphras II, the advisory council that aided in the governance of Impiltur during the mid-to-late 14 century DR. As one of the elder lords of the realm, Soargilm offered his sage advice to the Queen-regent Sambryl in the years leading up to the coronation of King Imbrar II.\nSoargilm was a man of good sense who became quite wise throughout his years of service to the kingdom. Despite his wealth of perspective, he largely retired from public life and seldom spoke during council meetings. He preferred to share his guidance with the Queen-regent directly acting alongside Rilimbraun as her personal advisers."
