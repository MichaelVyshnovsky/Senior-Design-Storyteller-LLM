'''Talgos Twilight''' was a [[thief]] and guest of [[The Redmark]] inn in the town of [[New Velar|Harrowdale]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Activities==
Talgos recently acquired unwanted attention in [[Impiltur]], perhaps enough to force him to make his way to [[Harrowdale]] where he ransacked his room at the Redmark in search of something particular.
