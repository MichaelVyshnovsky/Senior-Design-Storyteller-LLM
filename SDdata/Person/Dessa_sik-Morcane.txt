'''Dessa sik-Morcane''' was a female [[drow]] [[cleric]] of [[Lolth]] in [[Szith Morcane]] who, during the [[Silence of Lolth]], turned to [[barbarian|barbarism]].

==History==
Born a female drow in Szith Morcane and into minor nobility in [[House Morcane]], Dessa was initiated into the mysteries of the [[Church of Lolth]] and trained to be a cleric of the Spider Queen. However, in [[1372 DR]], Lolth's Silence struck the drow of Szith Morcane and Dessa was caught up in the coup of House Morcane that followed. She was captured by [[Kiaransalee]]an cultists, led by [[Dorina T'sarran|Dorina]] and [[Zedarr T'sarran]], and used as food for their [[vampire|vampiric]] servants.

==Description==
Dessa had particularly deep black skin for a drow and a shock of wild, white hair. A powerfully built female, Dessa wore only a plain black [[tunic]] and black [[breeches]]. During her captivity at the hands of the Kiaransaleeans, in [[1372 DR]], she was even denied her boots and a belt.

==Personality==
A shameless and duplicitous drow, Dessa was not afraid to debase herself to gain an advantage against her enemies. She especially disliked surface-worlders.

==Abilities==
Raised in the service of [[Lolth]], Dessa sik-Morcane had passable training as a cleric. Her most distinguishing traits, however, were those of a powerful and wild warrior who would fly into a rage in combat.

==Possessions==
Prior to her capture during the Silence of Lolth, Dessa sik-Morcane had a number of items befitting her station as a minor cleric of Lolth. However, she was soon stripped of these once House Morcane was overthrown.
