        "mainbody": "Surero was an alchemist present in Innarlith on the Lake of Steam in the mid–14 century DR.\nHe had blond hair.\nHe had expertise in creating smokepowder.\nHe was also able to make potions and ointments for healing.\nHe worked as an alchemist in Innarlith.\nIvar Devorast was his employer and friend after Ivar contacted him to help him with the creation of smokepowder to assist in a project to construct a canal from the Lake of Steam to the Nagaflow.\nMarek Rymüt was his hated enemy. He resented him as a foreigner with great power in Innarlith and (rightly) believed him to secretly be a Red Wizard. Surero was afraid of him, although Marek wasnt bothered by him and even excused his attempts to try to kill him.\nSurero used to be an alchemist in Innarlith before losing out in competition, owing to the magical items trade being put out of business by the clandestine Red Wizard Marek Rymüt.\nIn 1364 DR, Surero made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Marek by exploding a bomb in the streets of Innarlith while Marek and the polymorphed black dragon Insithryllax were walking in the street. The bomb failed to kill them and Insithryllax came close to polymorphing into his dragon form, thus revealing himself to the people of Innarlith. However, the city watch promptly arrested Surero and took him into custody. Marek asked that he not be executed and excused his attempted assassination by explaining it as a result of \"hard times\".\nSurero was kept in a solitary cell for 125 days before he was released by the Ransar upon the request of Marek Rymüt. Surero then fled the city and headed westwards to the city of Saelmur on the Lake of Steam, with plans of possibly starting business again in Athkatla.\nIn 1366 DR, Ivar Devorast went to Saelmur to find him there and asked him to return with him to the wilderness north of Innarlith, where he was building a canal. Devorast wanted Surero to help him produce smokepowder for excavation of the canal trench. Surero was persuaded and agreed to return with Devorast, although with some reluctance out of fear of Marek Rymüt.\nHe went back to the canal site with Devorast and got Devorast to secure a supply of saltpeter for him from Berrywilde, the estate of Senator Inthelph. At one point, an assassin attempted unsuccessfully to kill Devorast at the site by exploding Sureros smokepowder. \nA Banelar naga was sent by the Zhentarim to murder Devorast. The attempt was thwarted but Devorast was poisoned and badly injured. Surero used potions and ointments he made to help Devorast recover.\nEventually Ransar Salatis dismissed Devorast from managing the canal construction and Surero departed as well. He went back to the city of Innarlith and took a position as brewmaster at the Green Phoenix tavern in the third quarter under the alias Orerus (simply \"Surero\" spelled backwards).\nHe visited the canal site following his dismissal in 1369 DR. From the viewing stand, he witnessed an accident with smokepowder that killed several workers.\nDevorast and Surero eventually returned to the canal site in 1371 DR and secretly worked as laborers there. Surero disguised himself by growing a beard in order to avoid being recognized. He and Devorast secretly gave advice to the workers about how to build the canal, since Devorasts replacement Horemkensi was incompetent and causing the deaths of workers, while replacing them with zombies (who were also often former workers).  \nSurero visited the Sisterhood of Pastorals in Innarlith and spoke with Halina Rymüt-Sverdej a cleric of Chauntea, he had met years before. He convinced her to talk to the other sisters of their monastery about doing something regarding the growing number of zombie workers in the city. \nSurero and Devorast were both arrested several months later on charges of being behind the assassination of Horemkensi. They were later released from prison a year later in 1372 DR on orders of Ransar Pristoleph who knew that they were both innocent. The Ransar then ordered them both to return to the canal to continue the construction. \nSurero assisted Devorast with planting smokepowder charges in the canal, which Devorast later used to destroy the canal when his vision for the canal was abandoned and a magic portal was placed in it. \nWillem Korvan an undead assassin under the control of Marek Rymüt and disguised as a human senator, attempted to kill Devorast but ended up killing Surero instead when the latter walked into the tent between him and Devorast. Willem then fled after killing Surero. Pristoleph ordered for Willem to be arrested afterwards for the murder."
