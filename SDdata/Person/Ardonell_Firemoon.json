Her speeches often riled up unrest towards the Land of the Purple Dragon. Another notable quality of hers was the knowledge of old lore, ancient stories, and legends that surprised even Elminster Aumar hiself.\nArdonell Firemoons gear included an enchanted +2 chainmail, a spellblade that made her untochable to lightning bolt spells, and a pair of boots of speed."
