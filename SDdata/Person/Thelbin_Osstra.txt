Thelbin Osstra was a wheat farmer that lived in Nightstone during the late 15 century DR.
He lived in the walled village with his husband Brynn and Brynns family, including his sister, mother, and nephew Broland.
Some time after the , the Osstra family cottage was partially destroyed when Nightstone was besieged by cloud giant dropping giant boulders upon the village. When the townsfolk fled Nightstone to seek shelter in nearby caves, many of them including Brynns sister and mother were slain by a band of goblins, while others were "merely" taken captive for some time.
