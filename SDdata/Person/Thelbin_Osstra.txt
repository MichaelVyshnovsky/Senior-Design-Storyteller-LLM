'''Thelbin Osstra''' was a [[wheat]] farmer that lived in [[Nightstone]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He lived in the walled village with his husband [[Brynn Osstra|Brynn]] and Brynn's family, including his sister, mother, and nephew [[Broland Osstra|Broland]].

==History==
Some time after the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the Osstra family cottage was partially destroyed when Nightstone was besieged by [[cloud giant]] dropping giant boulders upon the village. When the townsfolk fled Nightstone to seek shelter in nearby caves, many of them including Brynn's sister and mother were slain by a band of [[goblin]]s, while others were "merely" taken captive for some time.
