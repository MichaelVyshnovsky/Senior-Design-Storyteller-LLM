'''Maegla''' was a shopkeeper in [[Red Larch]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Activities==
Maegla ran a clothing shop with her husband, [[Helvur Tarnlar]]. She was the true business mind in the shop.

The Tarnlars had at this time four children, two boys and two girls, aged between 7 and 10 years old, who were known to play in and around the ravine by [[Lance Rock]] outside of Red Larch.

Maegla, as well as her husband, were members of the [[Lords' Alliance]] at this time.
