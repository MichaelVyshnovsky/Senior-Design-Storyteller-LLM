In 1357 DR, they went to the Sel√ªnes Smile in Waterdeep and used a poison dart and a club to subdue Vajra and kidnap her, though even beaten and drugged she put up a fight.\nConner, Timoth Eyesbright, and Salabak eventually caught up with the band, distracted them with the illusion of a dracolich, and slew them with arrows, rescuing Vajra."
