Gerinvioch was an ancient blue dragon living in the Raurin.
Gerinvioch rather enjoyed his deceptions He really didnt care for humans, and was intensely scornful of their achievements.
Gerinvioch was somehow versed in the operation of artifacts such as the Evise Jhontil.
Of note, not far from Gerinviochs lair was the town of Lliiress, which the dragon had entrapped with an artifact.
He was no friend of Ronatsinaderin.
In the , Gerinvioch was approached by a party that included Aniolon Gruanthe. After slaying most of them with his breath, Gerinvioch heard out Aniolon the human explained that he was looking for his aid, not his treasure. The dragon was intrigued, and accepted, on two conditions he wanted an artifact brought to him, the Evise Jhontil, and he wanted the bodies left in his lair for him to eat. Aniolon agreed to both conditions.
After Aniolon sent people to acquire the Evise Jhontil, Gerinvioch used the relic to perform a ritual that created a barrier. He was interrogated a little by Umbeso, a fellow of Aniolons, while performing the riteâ€”the dragon claimed that the barrier would prevent entry as well as hide them from all forms of observation. The dragon was lying, however, as the barrier prevented only egress, not ingress, and a side effect of the artifact was that it caused the death of everyone inside who employed magic.
In , Gerinvioch was approached by Kinase Bronihim, who was seeking the Evise Jhontil. The dragon pointed him in the direction of Lliiress, where the wizard became trapped forevermore.
Gerinviochs name was known in the otherwise extremely isolated town of Lliiress.
