'''Gerinvioch''' was an [[dragon aging|ancient]] [[blue dragon]] living in the [[Raurin]].{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|174-178}}

==Personality==
Gerinvioch rather enjoyed his deceptions{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|180}} He really didn't care for [[human]]s, and was intensely scornful of their achievements.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|169-170}}

==Abilities==
Gerinvioch was somehow versed in the operation of [[artifact]]s such as the ''[[Evise Jhontil]]''.

==Possessions==
Of note, not far from Gerinvioch's lair was the town of [[Lliiress]], which the dragon had entrapped with an artifact.

==Relationships==
He was no friend of [[Ronatsinaderin]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|976}}, Gerinvioch was approached by a party that included [[Aniolon Gruanthe]]. After slaying most of them with his breath, Gerinvioch heard out Aniolon; the human explained that he was looking for his aid, not his treasure. The dragon was intrigued, and accepted, on two conditions: he wanted an artifact brought to him, the ''Evise Jhontil'', and he wanted the bodies left in his lair for him to eat. Aniolon agreed to both conditions.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|163-170}}

After Aniolon sent people to acquire the ''Evise Jhontil'', Gerinvioch used the relic to perform a ritual that created a barrier. He was interrogated a little by [[Umbeso]], a fellow of Aniolon's, while performing the rite—the dragon claimed that the barrier would prevent entry as well as hide them from all forms of observation.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|171-173}} The dragon was lying, however, as the barrier prevented only egress, not ingress,{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|181-182}} and a side effect of the artifact was that it caused the death of everyone inside who employed magic.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|174-178}}

In {{yearlink|1372}}, Gerinvioch was approached by [[Kinase Bronihim]], who was seeking the ''Evise Jhontil''. The dragon pointed him in the direction of Lliiress, where the wizard became trapped forevermore.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|157-160}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Gerinvioch's name was known in the otherwise extremely isolated town of Lliiress.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|161-162}}
