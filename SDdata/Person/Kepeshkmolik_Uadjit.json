        "mainbody": "epeshkmolik Uadjit was a dragonborn member of Clan Kepeshkmolik who served as the ambassador of Tymanther. She was a direct descendant of Shasphur. \nUadjit had dark eyes and sleek, gray-green scales.\nUadjit was considered to have a silver tongue and a charismatic personality.\nUadjit was the daughter of Kepeshkmolik Narghon, the wife of Verthisathurgiesh Arjhani and the mother of Dumuzi.\nAround 1450 DR, Uadjit was chosen to be Mehens wife, but he spurned her because he had a relationship with his clanmate, Arjhani. When Mehen was exiled, Arjhani was chosen by Clan Verthisathurgiesh as the new husband for Uadjit.\nIn 1486 DR, Uadjit was the scion of Clan Kepeshkmolik and the ambassador of Tymanther in High Imaskar. However, she returned to Tymanther when Mulhorand declared their war against the Imaskari.\nUadjit was Clan Kepeshkmoliks candidate for the elections to chose the new Vanquisher, that were expected to be celebrated in 1487 DR. She was the candidate with the strongest claim to the title. This changed, however, when Dumuzi became the Chosen of Enlil, as Uadjit lost a lot of popularity among the elders of the clans.\nIn the wake of the Second Sundering, Uadjit helped Mehen and Kallan with the efforts to rescue the survivors of the exchanging of lands between Toril and Abeir. She was also one of the dragonborn who supported the decision to allow Namshitas refugees to live in Tymanther, in gratitude for Namshitas help against the Untherans.\nDuring the first Tymanther-Unther War, Uadjit was in charge of the defense of the gates of Djerad Thymar."
