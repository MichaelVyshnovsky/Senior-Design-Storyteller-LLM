'''Absalme''' was a henchman, or perhaps pet, to the [[Talontar blightlord]] [[Damanda]] in {{yearlink|1373}}. She was 'elf thin', wore a gown of white leather, and played a flute of fused humanoid bones.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|215-217|22}} After she tried to grab [[Araluen]] and lift the child by her hair, the infant brushed her wrist; she was instantly annihilated by blinding light.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|244-246|26}}
