        "mainbody": "'''Shorn Diergar''' was a small and pesky [[dwarf]] who was captured in the mysterious [[Darkmoon]] temple, in or some time prior to [[1358 DR]].",
        "Description": "Diergar had brown hair and a thick beard. Upon his capture, he was found to be starved and stripped to only a rag. He was a passionate [[cleric]], who wished to stand against the villains that prayed upon the innocent.",
        "History": "Shorn Diergar was a cleric of the [[Temple of the Stone Axe]]. For months, he was haunted by a vision of an ancient temple that was shrouded in dark cloth. He felt compelled to seek out the temple, so that he could battle the evil within. Thus, Shorn traveled for four days to find Temple Darkmoon. When he arrived, he found no evil, just a group of clerics who greeted travelers with open arms. Thus, the stout dwarf spent the night at the temple. When he awoke, he found himself in a cell, imprisoned in the temple's catacombs.\n\nUpon their infiltration of Temple Darkmoon in [[1358 DR]], the [[Heroes of Waterdeep]] may have come across Shorn Diergar, who was kept a prisoner there. In his famished state, he croaked at the heroes for help. If saved, he picked himself up from the floor and in a pained voice, told the heroes that he had no idea what the evil clerics of Darkmoon had in store for him. The Heroes of Waterdeep asked him how he became imprisoned, and he told them his story. After this, the dwarf thanked the heroes, and told them that he was a capable healer and had fought in several battles. He then offered to join them."
