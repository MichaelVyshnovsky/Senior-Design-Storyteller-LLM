Losifan Urdo was a mercenary swashbuckler in Westgate in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Losifan was a handsome and fashionable man who cared about appearances and had a biting sarcastic wit.
Losifan wore an enchanted +2 set of leathers, and was armed with a magic +1 longsword as well as a main gauche.
Losifan was one of the field officers of the Mercenaries Guild of Westgate. He was responsible for discipline and training together with Mannin. Losifan was kind of a dandy.
Losifan hailed from a prominent House Urdo family of Westgate, and a known "black sheep" amongst the wealthy merchant family members. In his youth, Losifan was a duelist. Initially, he joined the Guild as a recruit but impressed Palla so much that she hired him permanently.
