        "mainbody": "'''Mackester Claypipe''' was a [[halfling]] [[assassin]] of the [[Night Masks]] in [[1370 DR]].\n\nMackester on the surface was the houndsmaster of [[House Thalavar]] and the most skilled canine expert of [[Westgate]], loved both by her masters and the city's halfling community. However, she was secretly also a Night Mask assassin. Mackester was in fact also a member of a small cult of worshipers of [[Urogalan]] who believed that the god needed sacrifices, and she always remained confident in this doctrine. For this, Mackester always interred her victims underground as a sacrifice to Urogalan."
