'''Arcanali''' was a very old [[drow]] wizard in [[Battledale]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Arcanali was responsible for brewing up [[drow venom]] for a band of drow mercenaries.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Arcanali was a decrepit and slightly addled old woman, "retired" to the caves underneath [[Haptooth Hill]]. She brewed her [[poison]]s using local [[mushroom]]s for the wizard [[Dracandros]] who took over Hap. These interactions were not voluntary, and Arcanali considered Dracandros a "robber-baron." She was willing to help those trying to depose the [[Red Wizard]] usurper.
