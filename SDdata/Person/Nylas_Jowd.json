        "mainbody": "'''Nylas Jowd''' was a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] who lived within [[Undermountain]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a student at the [[magic]] academy known as [[Dweomercore]], located within the dungeon-complex far beneath the city of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description": "Like the other Red Wizards, Nylas wore red wizards' robes and kept his head shaved bald. Also like his countrymen, he possessed a certain disposition towards malevolence and evil. Nylas was particularly interested in anatomy and tended to view the living as future corpses that could be manipulated with [[necromancy]].",
        "Relationships": "As companions, the young wizard kept a pair of invisible [[will-o'-wisp]]s that accompanied him throughout his journeys.\n\nIn his studies, Nylas drew the ire and cruelty of the \"Horned Sisters\" of Dweomercore, [[Turbulence]] and [[Violence]]. He sought to have them killed so that he could ''[[Animate dead|reanimate]]'' their bodies as walking [[undead]].",
        "Possessions": "Among Nylas's possessions was his personal [[spellbook]], which was crafted from the wood of a coffin and the flesh of one or more [[humanoid]]s. Its pages were inscribed with words written in Nylas's own blood.",
        "History": "While he began his arcane studies in his homeland of Thay, Nylas eventually traveled west to Undermountain to study necromancy directly under the \"Mad Mage\" [[Halaster Blackcloak]]. Sometime before the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], he enrolled in the arcane academy, Dweomercore, accompanied by his will-o'-wisps."
