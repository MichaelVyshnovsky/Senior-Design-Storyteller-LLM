        "mainbody": "lack Logan was reputed to be a warlord of the Sword Coast North early in its history and the commander of Black Logans Keep in the Red Rocks in the Sea of Swords.\nA local legend claimed that the fortress was built by Black Logan, who was supposedly a peer of an early warlord of Waterdeep, but it wasnt specified which. In any case, the story went that the two came into conflict, Black Logan escaped to his island keep, and the warlords army laid siege to it for over a year. Finally, Black Logan suffered heartstop and died and his troops tossed the body off the wall as a sign of surrender.\nHowever, the warlord remained enraged that Black Logan had evaded justice, and brought his body back to Waterdeep, where it was put on trial, found guilty of something, and then hung, drawn, and quartered.\nThe legend went on to say that the ghost of Black Logan haunted the keep and hungered for revenge. However, visitors to the later Hall of Reflected Moonlight had seen no sign of it, so either the story was false or else the Order of the Blue Moon had made a deal with Black Logan."
