'''Tyran the Outlaw''' was a bandit leader in [[Teshendale]] in [[1368 DR]].

==History==
Tyran was a descendant of an old [[Teshwave]] family.

Around 1368 DR, he gathered a small army and started to attack [[Zhentarim]] caravans with the ultimate goal of freeing his dale. The [[Zhent]]s put a bounty on his head.
