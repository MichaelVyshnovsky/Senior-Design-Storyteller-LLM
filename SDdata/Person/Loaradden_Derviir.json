        "mainbody": "'''Loaradden Deviir''' was a sinister [[Magister]] who held the title for two years from [[319 DR]] to [[321 DR]] before his actions finally earned the wrath of [[Mystra]].",
        "Personality": "Loaradden was cold and calculating, caring for nothing but the pursuit of magical power.",
        "History": "After helping [[Iolaeden Stonehallow]] vanquish her foes for several years, Loaradden turned to his own goals that revolved around raiding temples and slaying any practitioner of the [[The Art|Art]] in search of arcane might.\n\nMystra initially tried to thwart Loaradden by erecting ''[[wall of force|walls of force]]'' before him whenever he approached a temple. While blocked from entering the temples, he turned his attentions to attacking any [[mage]] he could find regardless of their skill level in the Art. Outraged by this affront, Mystra took Loaradden's magic while he was plowing his way through a group of guards en route to the vault of [[Onsilur Maerdrathom]] in [[Sheirtalar]]. Loradden's magic abandoned him during the use of a flight spell, causing him to tumble into the courtyard below where Onsilur easily blasted his broken body."
