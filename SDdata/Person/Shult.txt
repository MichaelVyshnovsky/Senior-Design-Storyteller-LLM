Shult was the innkeeper of the Wild Goose in Arabel, Cormyr, in the midâ€“14 century DR.
He was considered a kind old man around 1367 DR.
As well as running the inn, Shult could procure almost anything a patron could ask for, provided it could fit through the corridors and wasnt outright hazardous. This was thanks to his arrangements with Mitchifer of the dimensionally neighboring World Serpent Inn. Shult would deliver it for free, but the patron must pay whatever Shults vendors charged. Shult also knew how to enter the World Serpent and would sell the secret to those who asked.
He had three daughters, whom Volo described as jolly, robust, and incredibly energetic about their duties.
