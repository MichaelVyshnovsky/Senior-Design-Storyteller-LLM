        "mainbody": "''' Dalzhel''' was a [[human]] warrior of the [[Zhentil Keep]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a lieutenant of the then-[[human]] [[Cyric]] when he entered into the service of [[Bane]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]].{{cite book/Tantras|230-330|15, Epilogue}}{{cite book/Waterdeep|24-178}}",
        "History": "Dalzhel was a skilled warrior of Zhentil Keep and during the Time of Troubles he was in the [[Zhentilar]] army stationed in [[Scardale]].\n\nDalzhel was promoted to lieutenant of the [[Company of the Scorpions]] under Cyric. Dalzhel and Cyric assisted [[Bane]]'s forces in the assault on [[Tantras]], but after the death of Bane at the hands of [[Torm]], Dalzhel and his men pledged loyalty to Cyric.\n\nDalzhel was involved in the hunt for the [[Tablets of Fate]] and continued to follow Cyric even after the loss of most of his men. In the end, during a three-way confrontation with the then-human [[Kelemvor]] and the god [[Bhaal]], Dalzhel was killed by the god of assassins.",
        "Personality and Traits": "Dalzhel was a very practical man and he felt no particular loyalty to Bane, unlike most in the Zhentilar. He considered no god worthy of his adoration because he received no advantages from gods. However, Dalzhel followed Cyric loyally because he liked his plan for power, even after knowing he did not truly serve Zhentil Keep."
