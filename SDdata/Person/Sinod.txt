Sinod was an Overseer of the Cult of the Dragon circa 1369 DR during the occupation of the ruins of Myth Drannor who reported to Kya Mordrayn herself.
Sinod was one of the cultists who were led by Kya Mordrayn in 1369 DR into the ruins of the ancient elven city to take control of a pool of radiance in the basement of Castle Cormanthor. He ordered lieutenant Garesh to hunt down a band of orog mercenaries who rebelled against their cultist masters who were stripping souls off their kin, tuning them into subservient living zombie-like creatures. According to the notes left behind in the Elven Catacombs, Sinod threatened Garesh with Kya Mordrayns thinning patience because of the lieutenants inability to handle the orog problem.
