I could flay the skin from your bones, or cause your blood to boil up like a steaming teapot. Oh, the possibilities are infinite.|Extallimix}}",
        "History": "Extallimix was imprisoned within a magicical [[crystal]] [[orb]] many years before 1372 DR. His prison was kept within the Sorceller's Encapsulate, a [[wizard]]s' guild of [[Daggerford]]. [[Delfen Ondabarl]] had access to the item, and in 1372 DR, he used the demilich to exact vengeance on his old arch-nemesis, [[Mogdor]]. The lich's prison was delivered to the wizard of [[Etabalon]], and he happily opened the chest, realizing the villain's scheme. Thinking Mogdor was responsible for his imprisonment, Extallimix blasted Mogdor with deadly spells, seemingly killing him on the spot. The delivery was made by the [[Hero of Daggerford]], and the lich turned on the adventurer, ready to flay them alive. However, Extallimix felt mysterious magical power nearby and left the Hero to gather the demilich's servants for a purpose unknown."
