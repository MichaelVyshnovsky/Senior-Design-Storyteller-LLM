        "mainbody": "Extallimix was an old evil demilich who was imprisoned within Sorcellers Encapsulate circa 1372 DR.\nExtallimix was imprisoned within a magicical crystal orb many years before 1372 DR. His prison was kept within the Sorcellers Encapsulate, a wizards guild of Daggerford. Delfen Ondabarl had access to the item, and in 1372 DR, he used the demilich to exact vengeance on his old arch-nemesis, Mogdor. The lichs prison was delivered to the wizard of Etabalon, and he happily opened the chest, realizing the villains scheme. Thinking Mogdor was responsible for his imprisonment, Extallimix blasted Mogdor with deadly spells, seemingly killing him on the spot. The delivery was made by the Hero of Daggerford, and the lich turned on the adventurer, ready to flay them alive. However, Extallimix felt mysterious magical power nearby and left the Hero to gather the demilichs servants for a purpose unknown."
