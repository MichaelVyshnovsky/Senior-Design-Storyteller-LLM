        "mainbody": "'''Salena Starre''' was an adventurer from [[Ravens Bluff]] who lived in the city around the year [[1370 DR]]. When she wasn't venturing out throughout [[Faer√ªn]], Salena lived with her mother [[Elonia Starre|Elonia]], in their home above [[Elonia's Beauty Shoppe]].\n\nThe ravishing Salena had many adoring fans within the city, who followed her career, eager to hear about her most recent harrowing adventure or valorous adventure. Elonia's shop was often packed with men seeking to court Salena, who had become the subject of at least one ballad composed by Ravenian [[bard]]s."
