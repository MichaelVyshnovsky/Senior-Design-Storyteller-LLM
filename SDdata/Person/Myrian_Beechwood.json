        "History": "Once Myrian was an adventurer priest of [[Waukeen]]. After [[Lashan Aumersair]]'s demise, he did so much for the poor people of the dale that the occupying forces offered him the provisional lordship. To the surprise of all, himself included, he remained in office until 1368 DR, despite growing tired and angry from the conflict in the Parliament."
