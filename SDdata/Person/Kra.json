This room was decorated with trophies and spoils from his raiding, including expensive furniture, animal furs and antlers, as well as the severed heads of his humanoid enemies.\nKras tribe found Icespire Hold, a stone fortress on Icespire Peak, abandoned and damaged by an earthquake in the late 15 century DR. They took over the fortress and dwelled there, fighting dwarves, humans, and rival orcs in the surrounding region. \nKras reign ended a decade later when the young white dragon Cryovain decided to make Icespire Hold its new lair. He gained access through the southwest section that was still damaged by the earthquake. Cryovain ate several orcs including Kra, leaving behind nothing of the war chief save for his right hand, causing the remaining orcs to flee. The dragon then settled on the roof and occupied the fortress."
