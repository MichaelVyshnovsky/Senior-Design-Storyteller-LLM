'''Kellen''' was a 10-year-old boy who in [[1491 DR]] was kidnapped from his home in [[Liam's Hold]] by [[werewolves]] from [[Barovia]], forced to engage in a combat to the death with other children, and subsequently infected with werewolf [[lycanthropy]].

==Activities==
Kellen usually lay in a small corner of the werewolf den curled up in his [[wolf]] form along with Wensencia, a older [[werewolf]] of the werewolf pack.

==Possessions==
Kellen held dear to him a [[zombie]] doll with the inscription "Is no fun, Is no Blinsky!" written on it.
