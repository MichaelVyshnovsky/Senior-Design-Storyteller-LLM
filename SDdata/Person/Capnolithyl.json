        "mainbody": "'''Capnolithyl''', also known as '''Brimstone''',",
        "Description": "Capnolithyl appeared to be a normal, adult smoke drake with reddish black scales. However that was an illusion used to disguise its [[undead]], vampiric nature.",
        "Abilities": "Capnolithyl fancied himself a scrier, who had spells to contact people at a distance.{{cite book/The Rage|126|8}} Brimstone knew at least one spell that shot fire darts.{{cite book/The Ruin|178|7}} He knew a charm to increase his own speed.{{cite book/The Ruin|179|7}}",
        "Possessions": "Unlike other vampire dragons, that cannot leave their hoards for large periods of time, Capnolithyl was able to remain apart from his hoard due to a [[magic]]al collar he had prepared for such purpose. During the final battle against [[Sammaster]], the [[lich]] managed to destroy the collar. A tiny portion of the collar remained, however, and Capnolithyl placed it within his body to keep it safe.",
        "History": "Capnolithyl was one of the drakes Sammaster reached out when he was researching a way to create the first [[dracolich]]es. He allowed Sammaster to turn him into a vampire, thinking this would win him favor and a position of power in the new world Sammaster prophesied. However, Sammaster realized the disadvantages of vampires far outweighed their usefulness, and he discarded Capnolithyl. Since that day, Capnolithyl's only desire was to see Sammaster destroyed.\n\nFor that reason, Capnolithyl remained in his lair near [[Lyrabar]] waiting and gathering power. In [[1373 DR]], Capnolithyl learned about [[Karasendrieth]]'s quest to cure the [[Rage of Dragons]], and contacted her to offer his aid. He later journeyed with Kara, [[Dorn Graybrook]] and their companions to help them in their quest to learn about Sammaster's secrets, but also did work on his own. Little is known of the time he spent apart from Graybrook. The entire time he traveled with Graybrook, he did not get along with their traveling [[cleric]], [[Pavel Shemov]], a priest of [[Lathander]], who found it hard to tolerate Capnolithyl's undead condition.\n\nNotable accomplishments by Capnolithyl were reversing the [[Vaasa]]n Horde that was stirred up by Sammaster to cause confusion, and the saving of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], King of [[Damara]]; and its help in the final battle against Sammaster and the destruction of the [[mythal]] that caused the Rage of Dragons. For this reason, dragons across [[Faer没n]] hailed him as a hero, although some believed he died in that final battle.\n\nAfter the destruction of Sammaster, Capnolithyl began to feel a sense of emptiness. He remained in Sammaster's fortress, the citadel where the final battle against the lich took place, searching for something to give purpose again to his life, and he found it when he came across information about an old draconic custom, the ''[[xorvintaal]]''. He then traveled across the [[Outer Planes]] in order to fully investigate his discovery.\n\nHe returned to [[Toril]] in [[1479 DR]], and went to [[Dracowyr]] to contact the [[Princes of Murgh么m]] in order to start his own ''xorvintaal''. After [[Tchazzar]] was freed from [[Sseelrigoth]]'s prison, Capnolithyl sought the red dragon to invite him to play the ''xorvintaal'' as well.\n\nWhen [[Alasklerbanbastos]] warned Capnolithyl about [[Aoth Fezim]]'s meddling and the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] attempts to foil the ''xorvintaal'', the vampire allowed the dracolich to reach other dragon allies, including Tchazzar and a few dragon princes of [[Murgh么m]], to attack the Brotherhood.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Luthcheq]], the leaders of the Brotherhood of the Griffon, as well as several dragons and [[dragonborn]] knights from [[Tymanther]], traveled to Dracowyr to confront Capnolithyl and forced him to cancel the magic that bound wyrms to the game. Before he disappeared to whereabouts unknown, Capnolithyl claimed that the game was just a ruse to allow him to eliminate the most powerful dragons around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]."
