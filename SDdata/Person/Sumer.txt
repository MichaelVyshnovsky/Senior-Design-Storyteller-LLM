Sumer was a vile cleric of Talos inhabiting Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Sumer was tall and thin and had dark hair. He wore purple robes and was always surrounded by several bodyguards.
Though he kept a low profile in public masquerading as a trader, Sumer sought to kill at least one victim for Talos every time he visited Waterdeep. He prefered adventurers for his sacrifice as they were far less likely to be missed by the locals. He would often stalk bands of adventurers into the wilds or the sewers beneath the city and strike when they were weakened or least expected it.
Sumer wore an amulet of proof against detection and location at all times.
