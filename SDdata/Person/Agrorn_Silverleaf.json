        "Description": "He dressed in [[leather armor]], underneath which he wore a purple tunic, purple pants, and brown [[riding boots]]. Agrorn had fair skin and long, brown hair. He could be seen riding a white [[horse]].",
        "History": "Agrorn grew up as an only child. He was an occasional student of the famous sage [[Elminster Aumar]], who told him many tales of the greater world. The story of ''spellfire'' particularly resonated with Agrorn, and he set off in search of it. After his search ended in disappointment, Agrorn returned to Elminster for advice. The sage advised him to travel to the [[North]], and seek employment there."
