She realized that she was to be sacrificed to the jungle, and was placed as an offering in a cluster of thorny brambles alongside a [[tabaxi]] named [[Ashen Rock]]. Despite her frantic calls for help, she was dragged screaming into the brambles and killed by [[Twig blight|twig]] and [[needle blight]]s."
