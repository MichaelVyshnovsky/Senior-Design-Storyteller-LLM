Lodar was the cheerful tavern master of the Bubbling Cauldron in the village of Hilltop in the late-14 century DR.
In 1372 DR, after a kobold attack on Hilltop, Lodars chef Mara was taken hostage in the taverns kitchen by a band of kobolds, led by Hurc, who had been separated from the main group. He would ask Drogan Drogansons pupil to free Mara from the kobolds.
