        "mainbody": "Draguth Endroun is the elderly and reclusive leader of the druidic circle known as the Knightswood Nine. A stubborn and short-tempered man, Draguth is often found fighting with the other members of the group. He retains his leadership over the others by acting more powerful than he is along with possessing a brilliant store of knowledge about the Kings Forest.\nAlong with possessing a staff of the woodlands, Draguth has a unique immunity to dryad charms. This ability has allowed him to befriend the tree folk and perfect a dimension door that allows him to travel from one tree to another many times in a single day. All these powers allow him to stalk those who journey into the woods in which he lives, confronting anyone who defiles the forest or rescuing wounded travelers."
