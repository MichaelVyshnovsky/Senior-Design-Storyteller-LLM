        "mainbody": "'''Baerick Hammerstone''' was a [[dwarf]] master of the [[black ice]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in [[1485 DR]].",
        "Possessions": "Wearing [[splint mail]] in battle, Baerick fought with a black ice [[maul]] and [[light hammer]].",
        "History": "Baerick was a simple miner of [[Clan Battlehammer]] when he and his crew were recruited by [[Pallidor]], a former member of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]], to recover the corpse of [[Akar Kessell]]. However, Baerick was the first to discover the black ice, which drove him mad. Crazed, he killed all his fellows and afterward became subservient to Kessel, who had risen as a [[wight]].\n\nUnder Kessel's orders, Baerick spread the black ice through the dale, corrupting many people. Meanwhile, back at [[Kelvin's Cairn]], he questioned [[Stokely Silverstream]]'s leadership, resulting in a schism in the group. Similarly disaffected dwarves followed Baerick and departed. They established themselves in the [[Halls of Black Ice]], where Baerick plotted to conquer all dwarves."
