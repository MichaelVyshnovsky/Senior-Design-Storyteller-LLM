That his flesh was torn and fed to the great red dragon [[Ephelomon]].''|[[Lae'zel]]}}<br/>\nVoss was widely believed to have killed [[Orpheus]] at the end of the [[War of the Comet]]. In truth, Orpheus survived, albeit imprisoned within the [[Astral Prism]]. After the war, Voss maintained a façade of loyalty to [[Vlaakith CLVII|Vlaakith]], but secretly sought to free Orpheus and end Vlaakith's reign.\n\nIn the [[Faerûn]] {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Voss and his fellow knights began pursuit of an [[illithid]] [[nautiloid]], in search of the prism. Mounted atop their red dragon steeds, the knights traveled to the planet of [[Toril]] over the city of [[Yartar]], to the [[Nine Hells]] on the planes of [[Cania]] and [[Avernus]], and again back to Toril in the region of the [[Sword Coast]].\n\nJust beyond their [[crèche]], Voss and his knights began to patrol a stretch of the [[Risen Road]]. There they encountered a group of [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries, who they then killed without a second thought."
