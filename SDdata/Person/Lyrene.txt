Lyrene () was a half-elf in Mulmaster.
The half-elf dreamed of joining the Zhentarim like her ancestors.
Lyrene and her family lived near Zhentil Keep, where her father worked for the Zhentarim. She trained as a warrior. After that citys destruction, they transferred to Mulmaster, where her older sister began working as a maid and her father as a mason.
In 1491 DR, she was offered a chance to join the Zhents by Equarz if she could find a lost treasure at the bottom of the Lost Drop lake. An adverting party hired by her sister Dylohra saved her from some strange monsters inside the lake.
