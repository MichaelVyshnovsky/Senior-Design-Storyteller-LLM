'''Lyrene''' ({{Pronounce|lie|REEN|refs={{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|40}}}}) was a [[half-elf]] in [[Mulmaster]].

==Personality==
The half-elf dreamed of joining the [[Zhentarim]] like her ancestors.

==History==
Lyrene and her family lived near [[Zhentil Keep]], where her father worked for the Zhentarim. She trained as a warrior. After that city's destruction, they transferred to Mulmaster, where her older sister began working as a maid and her father as a mason.

In [[1491 DR]], she was offered a chance to join the Zhents by [[Equarz]] if she could find a lost treasure at the bottom of the [[Lost Drop]] lake.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|28}} An adverting party hired by her sister [[Dylohra]] saved her from some strange monsters inside the lake.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|30}}
