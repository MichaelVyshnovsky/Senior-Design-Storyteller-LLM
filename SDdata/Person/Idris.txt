'''Idris''' was a [[Netherese]] [[necromancer]] who lived in [[Neverwinter]] in [[1484 DR]].

In the burial grounds of [[Ebon Downs]] on the [[High Road]], she found a powerful artifact known as the [[Deathknell]] and with it Idris made pacts with the [[Barrow Lords]] of Ebon Downs, seeking to build an army of [[undead]] to strike at their [[Thayan]] foes. However, the appearance of this undead army alarmed Lord [[Dagult Neverember]], who sent a contingent of his army to stop them, accompanied by [[Doomguide]] [[Vesper Soulhearth]].

To deal with the situation, Vesper recruited an adventurer to destroy the Deathknell. The adventurer fought and defeated Idris and destroyed the Deathknell, stopping the dead from rising.
