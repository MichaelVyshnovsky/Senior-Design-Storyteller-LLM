{{quote|''Sheydann Zinn is my name, and I'm afraid the clothes are an affectation that I am unable to rid myself of.''|Sheydann Zinn}}

==Description==
Sheydann was a well-dressed, charismatic, and charming man, uncharacteristically so for a backwater swamp village inhabitant. He had brown hair and favored green-colored garb.

==History==
Before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Sheydann Zinn was a merchant from the city of Neverwinter. With the [[Shadow War]] devastating the region's commerce, Sheydann's business was ruined, and he lost everything he owned. After the war, he decided to pursue simpler life and moved to the backwater village of West Harbor. There, Sheydann ran a small merchant business, trading in baubles and other common goods. Sheydann was a resident of West Harbor when the duo of [[black dragon]]s, [[Voaraghamanthar]] and [[Waervaerendor]], tried to take over the village's brewery. During his time in West Harbor, Sheydann befriended the Mayor's son, [[Jan Buckman]].
