'''Kickshaw''' was a [[rogue]] member of the outlaw mercenary band from [[Cormyr]] called the [[Iron Collar Band]], active in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''You're drunk, fool! Shut your mouth, or my [[sword]]'ll do it for you. We're an '''adventuring company,''' not mercenaries. You'd best not confuse the two again...''|Black Geoffrey}}

==Description==
Kickshaw was a [[leather armor|leather]]-clad roguish type and a messy drunk. He was somewhat aloof and tended reveal too much. He often claimed that the Iron Collar Band were mercenaries to Black Geoffrey's anger. Kickshaw's loose tongue gained him several threats from the group's de-facto leader.

==Possessions==
Kickshaw was armed with a [[short sword]] and carried a [[dagger]], [[throwing knives]], a bottle of [[wine]], and a ''[[potion of luck]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Kickshaw and his two heavily-drinking comrades found themselves in the town of [[Targos]] as it was besieged by a [[goblin]] army of the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. Originally, the trio came from the southern nation of [[Cormyr]] where they did mercenary work. They fled the Forest Kingdom due to some unrevealed event involving plundering tombs and being shackled by Cormyr's [[Purple Dragons]]. The group did not regret the flight. Kickshaw and his mates were not willing to comply with Cormyr's many laws and fees that ruled over adventurers there.

Black Geoffrey, [[Blanchard Pike]], Kickshaw, and a [[priest]] named [[Koluhm Bonecutter]], all traveled as an "adventuring band" named the Iron Collar Band and eventually reached the unruly city of [[Luskan]]. There, they met the ragged [[wizard]] [[Phaen of the Rags]], secretly an agent of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]], who joined the group and told them of "easy gold" to be made in [[Targos]] as the town put out a call for adventurers at the time.

The Iron Collar Band accepted the contract with Targos, ostensibly becoming its defenders. On the day the settlement was attacked by goblins who bypassed its fortifications, Geoffrey, Pike, and Kickshaw didn't care for the attack and spent their day drinking and boasting at [[The Salty Dog Tavern]].
