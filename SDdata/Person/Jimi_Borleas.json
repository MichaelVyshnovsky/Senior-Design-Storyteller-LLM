        "mainbody": "Fist '''Jimi Borleas''' was a member of the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenary company from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{Quote|Don't worry about the smell, citizen â€“ probably just the drains. Nothing to concern yourself with.|Fist Borleas}}",
        "Description": "Jimi was a [[gold dwarvish]] man with a light skin tone, blue eyes, and a clean-shaven face. He wore a set of [[chainmail]] [[armor]] as part of the Flaming Fist uniform, decorated with the organization's emblem on a [[tabard]]. He was armed with a [[halberd]] and was ready to use it to punctuate his stern and cruel attitude.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Fist Borleas answered a complaint from [[Battrick Degronce]] in the Lower City. The [[gnome]] complained about the stench of decay around [[Philgrave's Mansion]]. Fist Borleas tried to convince Battrick that the stench was nothing but a clogged sewer and that he would file a report requesting the sewer's eventual cleanup. However, Battrick was correct in his suspicions that the stench was coming from the mansion. It was the lair of [[Mystic Carrion]] and his [[undead]] servants."
