Jaerathindryl, or "Malachite", was a wyrm-aged female green dragon who laired in the forests south of Mulmaster in the lands of the Moonsea in north Faer√ªn.
By 1369 DR, Malachite was waging a feud with the much younger black dragon Velvet, who lived in the Flooded Forest to the south. Velvet sought to move in on Malachites territory.
Malachite still lived by 1374 DR.
Malachite was supported by a Cult of the Dragon cell based near Mulmaster. The cell was large but chaotic and divisive, struggling amongst themselves for power, wealth and Malachites attention. They feuded with Velvets own Cult cell.
