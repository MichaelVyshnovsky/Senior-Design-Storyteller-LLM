'''Jaerathindryl''', or '''"Malachite"''', was a [[wyrm]]-aged female [[green dragon]] who laired in the forests south of [[Mulmaster]] in the lands of the [[Moonsea]] in [[north Faerûn]].

==History==
By [[1369 DR]], Malachite was waging a feud with the much younger [[black dragon]] [[Throstulgrael|Velvet]], who lived in the [[Flooded Forest]] to the south. Velvet sought to move in on Malachite's territory.

Malachite still lived by [[1374 DR]].

==Allies==
Malachite was supported by a [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell based near Mulmaster. The cell was large but chaotic and divisive, struggling amongst themselves for power, wealth and Malachite's attention. They feuded with Velvet's own Cult cell.
