'''Khayar Ironfist''' was a member of the [[Ironfist]] clan on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Khayar was an older dwarf, who went to explore the Ironfist stronghold. However, he was captured by [[bugbear]]s.

[[Khelgar Ironfist]] and the [[Kalach-Cha]] could have encountered Khayar while he was imprisoned by the bugbears. Once the bugbears were defeated, Khayar would be freed and the Kalach-Cha could have gained influence with Khelgar, so long as there was no mention of Khelgar deserting the clan.
