'''Daile Redfletching''' was a [[human]] [[ranger]] of the [[Moonsea]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Daile was the daughter of the ranger-thief [[Ren o' the Blade]] and the [[druid]] priestess [[Ciela]], who died when Daile was young.

==Description==
She had red-gold hair cut short and her father's blue eyes.

==Possessions==
Ren carved for Daile a [[longbow]] and polished the wood with the ''[[ioun stone]]s'' from the hilts of his magical [[dagger]]s [[Left]] and [[Right]]. The longbow was imbued with the magical power to shoot [[arrow]]s with great accuracy and distance. The bow had a deep red-brownish color and a highly polished surface, and emitted a low hum when Daile wielded it and only she could use it.
