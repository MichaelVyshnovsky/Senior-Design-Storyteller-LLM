Daile Redfletching was a human ranger of the Moonsea in the late 14 century DR.
Daile was the daughter of the ranger-thief Ren o the Blade and the druid priestess Ciela, who died when Daile was young.
She had red-gold hair cut short and her fathers blue eyes.
Ren carved for Daile a longbow and polished the wood with the ioun stones from the hilts of his magical daggers Left and Right. The longbow was imbued with the magical power to shoot arrows with great accuracy and distance. The bow had a deep red-brownish color and a highly polished surface, and emitted a low hum when Daile wielded it and only she could use it.
