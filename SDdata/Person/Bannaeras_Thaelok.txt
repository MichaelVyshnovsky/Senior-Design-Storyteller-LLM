Bannaeras Thaelok was the operator of Thaeloks Fine Leathers, a tannery operating out of a small bay south of the main harbor of Port Llast, in the late 15 century DR. Aside from his main occupation, Thaelok also farmed squid and octopuses.
Prior to settling in Port Llast, Thaelok operated out of Athkatla, until business took a turn for the worse after some bad deals. He relocated to the north to get away from rivals and creditors.
Having set up shop in Port Llast, Thaeloks Fine Leathers primarily worked with roth√© hides, but also with oxen, cattle, and deer.
As a result of pumping boiling water used for tanning into the bay for years, Thaelok inadvertently cultivated a thick bed of algae, attracting a population of squid and predatory cold-water octopi. Seeing an opportunity, Thaelok started catching and farming the molluscs and selling them as fertilizer or food. Some unsavory patrons, including Niklor the Masked of Waterdeep and Ulbaerl Taraskus of Athkatla, even bought the animals as live specimens for the purposes of breeding and magically transforming them to keep as guardians.
