'''Tarthane''' was one of the bandits under the [[Iron Fox]] in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
The men of the Iron Fox wore light armor and brought no lances or horses.

==History==
When [[Elminster Aumar]], a [[Chosen of Mystra]], carried out a scouring of the bandits in [[Buckralam's Starn]], Tarthane remained with his boss, the Iron Fox, until moments before his death at [[Fox Tower]]. They were attacked at the mess hall, where Elminster ambushed them using one or more [[crossbow]]s from a gallery overlooking them; Tarthane then dashed up the gallery on the boss' orders, together with fellow renegade [[Llander]].

At the top of the stair, Elminster dropped a tapestry on Llander, and then pulled the rug underneath Tarthane, gaining a few precious moments he used to stab the man in the eye.
