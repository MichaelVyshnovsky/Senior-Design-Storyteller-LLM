        "mainbody": "'''Favin Kreeger''' ({{Pronounce|FAY|vin|_|KREE|gur|refs={{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|5}}}}) was an [[albino dwarf]] who resided in [[Port Nyanzaru]]'s [[Port Nyanzaru/Old City|Old City]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He made a living by hiding corpses in the city's [[Refuse pit (Port Nyanzaru)|refuse pit]].{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|4}}\n{{Quote|I swear on my fatherâ€™s grave I didn't do anything wrong!|Favin Kreeger, probably lying}}",
        "Description": "Favin dressed in rags and would sweat profusely when he exerted himself. He was surprisingly nimble.",
        "Personality": "Favin was a compulsive liar and a nervous, sniveling coward. He was quick to whine in the face of discomfort and to grovel in the face of intimidation. He had no loyalties, even to family, and cared only for his own self-preservation and comfort. While he was a criminal, he was not a killer and lacked the courage to engage in fighting.",
        "Relationships": "He offered his body-hiding services to the criminals of Port Nyanzaru, and charged a hefty fee to make the corpses of murder victims disappear. He was also not above accepting odd jobs from suspicious individuals.",
        "History": "Shortly after the end of the [[death curse]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR,{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|3}} Favin crossed paths with an [[undead]] [[necromancer]], [[Jaru Tasca]], while hiding a [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] man's body in the refuse pit. She offered him 50 [[gold piece]]s to deliver a letter to the [[Port_Nyanzaru/Old_City#Government|beggar prince]] [[Pock-Marked Po]], and threatened to kill him if he revealed anything about her identity. He accepted the job in part out of fear, and unbeknownst to him, the letter was intended to push Po to send [[adventurer]]s into a trap.\n\nUpon delivering the letter, Po was concerned that neither he nor his contacts recognized the letter's handwriting, and when Favin refused to divulge who had given him the letter, Po had the dwarf thrown into [[Executioner's Run]] to scare him into speaking. This worked, and Favin revealed what he knew&mdash;including the location of the secret tunnel from which he had seen Jaru emerge&mdash;and hoped that adventurers would slay the necromancer to ensure his safety."
