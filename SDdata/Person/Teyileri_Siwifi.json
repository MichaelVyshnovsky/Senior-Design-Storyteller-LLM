        "mainbody": "'''Teyileri Siwifi''' was a wealthy young woman in [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]], during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "She had a bold sense of style and sought to impress those to whom she spoke, if not stun them into silence.",
        "Relationships": "Her father was a close associate of the [[Port Nyanzaru#Merchant Princes|merchant prince]] [[Wakanga O'tamu]], and she was known to spend time at the prince's villa to enjoy his menagerie.",
        "History": "During the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} Teyileri was embarrassed while giving a toast when a man rudely interrupted her. Seeking to make sure it did not happen again, her best solution was to acquire three magnificent [[necklace]]s&mdash;fashioned from [[rubellite]], [[silverspruce]], and [[sphene]]&mdash;believing that wearing such items would clearly convey her importance. She therefore contacted the [[Tearah Initoo|Master of the Market]] to commission the pieces."
