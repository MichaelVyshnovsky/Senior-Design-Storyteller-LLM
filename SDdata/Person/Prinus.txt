==History==
Prinus lurked in Uthe Lodge along with the other wood woads [[Robur]] and [[Falcata]] around the same time as the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]]. They served and protected the maddened [[dryad]] [[Sylvie]], who was the source of the plant overgrowth. The wood woads, the dryad, and other plant and animal life in the Lodge had been twisted by the [[druid]] [[Halsaime]], who had infected the [[ranger]] [[Peron Uthe]] and allowed him to spread the disease.
