        "mainbody": "'''Slobberchops''' was the pet [[tressym]] of the [[Vanthampur]] family from [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The tressym had a mean appearance, with multiple scars and a bobbed tail.",
        "Personality": "Slobberchops had no feeling of loyalty toward the Vanthampurs. It particularly disliked [[Thurstwell Vanthampur]] and his [[imp]] spies. Such was Slobberchops's contempt for its masters that it eagerly followed and helped any visitor who offered it food, warning them of potential dangers within [[Vanthampur Villa]].",
        "Abilities": "Like all tressym, Slobberchops had the ability to see [[Invisibility|invisible]] creatures and objects, an ability that was frequently used to spot hidden imps.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} Slobberchops lived in the villa's kitchen, feeding off [[rat]]s and scraps. The tressym was depicted in numerous family paintings and was featured in a lifelike statue at the villa's gallery."
