==Personality==
Zalto was a warmonger, dreaming to lead his kind at war in the glory of [[Surtr]] and [[Annam]].

==Activities==
Zalto could usually be found in [[Ironslag]]'s assembly hall playing with his two [[hell hound]]s [[Narthor]] and [[Zerebor]].

==Relationships==
Zalto had also managed to forge a non aggression pact with the nearby [[yak folk]].

==History==
[[File:Zalto AFR.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Duke Zalto with his pet hell hounds.]]
Zalto was one of the [[giant]] lords at time of the shattering of the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]]. In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR after the disappearance of the [[storm giant]] king [[Hekaton]], all of the giant lords took to reshape the ordning to their own fitting. Zalto first led his minions to reclaim Ironslag in the [[North Faer√ªn]], the greatest forge of ancient [[Ostoria]], planning to reconstruct the ancient colossus [[construct]] [[Vonindod]], a relic of the [[Thousand Year War]], and unleash it upon the hated [[dragon]]s.

However, Zalto eventually came to understand that a flame stronger than Ironslag's was required to awaken Vonindod. He then proceeded to forge an alliance with the [[drow]] of [[House Xorlarrin]] in order to gain the fire [[primordial]] [[Maegera]] with the hopes of using it's powers to complete Vonindod.
