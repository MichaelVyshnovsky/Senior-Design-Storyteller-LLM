A. Salvatores the Legend of Drizzt page 117 says he is a movanic deva. A deva may be promoted to a planetar and then a solar, though the time-frame for these events is unknown.\nHe resembled a handsome elf with wings, golden skin and long blond hair, naked but for a well-placed sash.\nAt one time, in some place, Al Dimeneira tried to put an end to the evil artifact called Crenshinibon. The demon Errtu was looking for the relic, craving its power, but Al Dimeneira appeared and banished Errtu back to the Abyss with a single word and then went after the relic. Telshazz, Errtus demon minion, tried to stop him and failed. However, Crenshinibons power overwhelmed the angelic being, burning his hands as he tried to grasp it and showing he could not destroy the evil Crystal Shard. Instead, Al Dimeneira threw the relic across the planes of existence, hoping to put it far away from Errtus grasp, hoping it would be found by no-one except someone with the power and sense to destroy it."
