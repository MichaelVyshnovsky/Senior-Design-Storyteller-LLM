        "mainbody": "'''Al Dimeneira''' was a powerful [[angel]] (a [[movanic deva]]<ref group=\"note\">While ''The Crystal Shard'' describes Al Dimeneira only as an \"angelic being\", ''Volo's Guide to All Things Magical'' page 99 states he is a solar, while ''A Reader's Guide to R. A. Salvatore's the Legend of Drizzt'' page 117 says he is a movanic deva. A deva may be promoted to a planetar and then a solar, though the time-frame for these events is unknown.",
        "Description": "He resembled a handsome elf with wings, golden skin and long blond hair, naked but for a well-placed [[sash]].",
        "History": "At one time, in some place, Al Dimeneira tried to put an end to the evil [[artifact]] called ''Crenshinibon''. The [[demon]] [[Errtu]] was looking for the relic, craving its power, but Al Dimeneira appeared and banished Errtu back to the [[Abyss]] with a single word and then went after the relic. [[Telshazz]], Errtu's demon minion, tried to stop him and failed. However, ''Crenshinibon''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s power overwhelmed the angelic being, burning his hands as he tried to grasp it and showing he could not destroy the evil Crystal Shard. Instead, Al Dimeneira threw the relic across the planes of existence, hoping to put it far away from Errtu's grasp, hoping it would be found by no-one except someone with the power and sense to destroy it."
