Venturing inside, he discovered the tomb of [[Fastred]], a notorious bandit chieftain of centuries past, but more significantly a still-burning [[torch]] and a freshly and bloodily slain body. He immediately fled, fearing the perpetrator might still be there and attack him next.\n\nOut of the swamp and on the road, Darvik encountered a [[Purple Dragons]] patrol led by Captain [[Flim]]. Darvik showed them the body, which Flim recognized to be that of the king's envoy, [[Grodoveth]]. Flim alerted Mayor [[Tobald]], and they informed [[Benelaius]], [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]], and [[Lindavar]], who were investigating [[Dovo|a previous murder]], with Darvik giving his account.\n\nSubsequently, Darvik guided Flim, Jasper, and Lindavar through the Vast Swamp and back to the site, showing them where to walk and how to avoid a [[thornslinger]] tree. He waited outside while they examined the scene; briefly, they considered Darvik as a culprit, but dismissed it based on footprint evidence and the difficulty of a small gnome to behead such a large [[human]]. Darvik led them out and headed back to his holding.",
        "Description": "He was small with a gravelly voice, and had skin that was brown, lined and leathery in a manner distinctive of gnomes.",
        "Personality": "He was very earnest and polite, always calling people \"sir\"—or \"sor\" in his thick accent—and fearful of tracking mud into their homes. However, he was also very long-winded and rambling. Being practical, he always had a [[candle]] and [[tinderbox|flint and steel]], \"because you never know, no, you don't\".",
        "Relationships": "There was a Missus Darvik.",
        "Activities": "Once a month, Darvik went into the [[Vast Swamp]] to pick [[peat]] for burning in the stove. He knew the ways of the dangerous swamp fairly well.",
