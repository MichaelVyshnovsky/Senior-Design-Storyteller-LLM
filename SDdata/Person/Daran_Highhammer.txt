Daran Highhammer was a dwarven exterminator who traveled across western Faerûn during the mid–14 century DR. He went wherever he could find work, helping folks get rid of troublesome vermin, particularly those that stood on two legs.
Daran was used to killing all manner of creatures that were known to cause infestations, such as snakes, ankhegs, carrion crawlers, and on occasion, the undead.
Throughout his life he has traveled the breadth of the Sword Coast fifteen times, from Calimshan to the Spine of the World mountains.
In the  Daran was hired by Auchlin Deepvein to help clear vermin away from his dig site located near the Coast Way crossing. Unfortunately the expedition dug into the Repository of Undeath and let loose a horde of undead creatures.
