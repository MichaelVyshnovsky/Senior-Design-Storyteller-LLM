Around 1480 DR, Drounan and his partner Andarphisk Hawkspike were paid by Lady Dawningdown to go to the remote and secret prison stronghold of Castle Irlingstar in the Thunder Peaks on the eastern border of Cormyr to free Jeresson Dawningdown. In truth they planned to double-crossed Lady Dawningdown and asked a ransom for her son and escapes in Sembia.
However arrived at the Castle they were pursued by a black dragon and refuged inside meeting Gelnur Farland, Arclath Delcastle, Amarune Whitewave, Duth Gulkanun and Imbrult Longclaws.
