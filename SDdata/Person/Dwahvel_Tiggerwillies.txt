'''Dwahvel Tiggerwillies''' was a [[halfling]] woman and the guildmistress of a halfling guild based in [[Calimport]] in [[Calimshan]] and the proprietor of the [[Copper Ante]]. She did not entertain many who were not halflings.

==Relationships==
She was a cousin of [[Dondon Tiggerwillies]].

[[Artemis Entreri]] considered her a friend (his first real friend) and spoke openly with her, sharing opinions and thoughts that he shared with nobody else.

==Activities==
She was very good at procuring information, and was used frequently for this purpose by Artemis.

==History==
She informed Artemis about his situation when he was "kelp-enwalled", and when [[Merle Pariso]], a battle mage from the [[House Basadoni|Basadoni Guild]], sought to kill him.

She helped Artemis with his plan to escape from Calimport by obtaining information about [[Cadderly Bonaduce]], feeding misinformation to [[Sharlotta Vespers]], and by procuring a copy of the [[Crenshinibon]].
