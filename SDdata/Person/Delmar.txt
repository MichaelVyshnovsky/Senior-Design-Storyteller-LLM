'''Delmar''' was a spy of the [[Purple Dragon Knight]]s in [[Eveningstar]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In late {{yearlink|1357}}, Highknight [[Forold]] brought up the observations of Delmar, relating that [[Vangerdahast]] had been to [[Eveningstar]] earlier and numerous apparitions reacted to his presence. The mage slew them all.
