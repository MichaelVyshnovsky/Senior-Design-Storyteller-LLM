'''Kynorath Greybeard''' was a scholar and historian who lived in the city of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Kynorath valued history, especially that of his home city, and did what he could to preserve it for others.

==Relations==
He was affiliated with the [[House of Knowledge (Neverwinter)|House of Knowledge]], the temple of [[Oghma]] in Neverwinter.

==History==
The eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] in the {{YearlinkName|1451}} was especially disastrous for the city of Neverwinter. Many [[Waukeen]]ar shrines in the [[Tower District]] were destroyed, and along with them relics that had been gathered by the city's merchants.

Decades after the cataclysmic event, following the [[Siege of Neverwinter]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Kynorath led a number of treasure hunts in the Tower District to recover these lost relics. He sent these to the House of Knowledge for preservation.
