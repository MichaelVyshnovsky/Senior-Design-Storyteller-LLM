'''Morinn''' was the king of [[Citadel Felbarr]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Like his queen, Morinn was known for being a particularly wise ruler. 

==Relationships==
Morinn shared equal authority over her people along with his wife Tithmel. The two were distant relatives of the famous [[dwarven]] king, [[Emerus Warcrown]].

==Possessions==
Morinn owned a splendid suit of ceremonial [[armor]], forged for him by the Royal Armorer, [[Ghelryn Foehammer]].

==History==
Some time after the [[War of the Silver Marches]] of [[1485 DR]], the Morinn and Tithmel received accounts of [[fire giant]]s passing through the hills located to the northwest of Citadel Felbarr. Fearing the worst, they employed a band of [[adventurer]]s to investigate the subterranean fire giant forge known as [[Ironslag]].
