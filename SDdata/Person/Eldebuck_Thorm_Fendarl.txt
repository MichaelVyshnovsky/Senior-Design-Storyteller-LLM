His Imperial Altitude '''Eldebuck Thorm Fendarl''', self-styled High Knight-Emperor of the Vale, was the ruler of the village of [[Fendarl's Gate]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was the four-times-great grandson of the village's founder, the warrior [[Fendarl]].

==Personality==
Eldebuck was supremely petty and pompous, as his chosen titles showed. He required everyone to address him as "Imperial Altitude", and punished those who forgot by confiscating all their goods and imprisoning them for a [[tenday]]. He was also an immense gourmand who insisted everyone else finish all their meals too.

==Description==
Naturally he was short and fat as well.

==Activities==
He occupied the small castle in the village, which he called the [[Imperial Palace]], where around [[1366 DR]] he spent his time in near-day-long feasts and commanded a grand army of only fourteen knights. It doubled as the village's inn, since Eldebuck forbade the building of an actual inn or tavern and also charged handsomely for the privilege of sharing a roof with the High Knight-Emperor. The "personal guests" who paid or were invited by Eldebuck, his knights, and select villagers were treated to dishes whether they wanted them or not, so at mealtimes villagers would claim to be "too busy in the fields" and knights engaged in training or [[falcon]] hunting, lest food be delivered to them on Eldebuck's orders whilst they stood guard.

At highsun, he inspected his subjects and guests, when he insisted everyone eat all their highsunfeast meals, thank the village's abundance, and sing his cooks' praises, while he boasted of Fendarl's heroism with the same tales each day. The local folk wisely smiled and answered with enthusiasm without fail.

==History==
One eveningfeast, a visiting [[mage]] pranked Eldebuck by having a roast, stuffed [[stag]] head on a platter animate via an ''[[audible glamer]]'' and complain to his Imperial Altitude about its death, butchery, and poor treatment in the kitchen. Afterward, this dish was not served again.
