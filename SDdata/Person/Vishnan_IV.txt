'''Vishnan IV''' was a priest-king of the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in [[Malatra]] some time before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
He once discovered a spring that produced ''[[elixir of youth]]''. To give thanks to the [[Lords of Creation]], he established a temple and the town of [[Durapatya]] nearby.
