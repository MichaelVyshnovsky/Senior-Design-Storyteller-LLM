        "Relationships": "Dassar was the leader of his own squad of rangers, and aided by his second-in-command [[Imbross Irri'Karr]]. He was an associate of Councilwoman [[Alisara Callum]] of [[Helm's Hold]] and Sergeant [[Alphonse Knox]] of the [[Neverwinter Guard]].<ref name=D&D.N\" />",
        "History": "{{Quote|[[Corellon]] be praised! Neverwinter has sent you to our aid, then they understand how serious this situation truly is.}}\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Dassar holed himself up in the outskirts of the Helmite city on the border of the [[Watcher's Forest]] along with a few other allies, including the merchant [[Kella]], the [[hedge wizard]] [[Nottin]], and [[Meryth Heartwood]]. He worked with some [[adventurer]]s to help take back [[Helm's Hold]] from the [[Ashmadai]], leading the efforts to slay the cult's [[mage]]s, [[conjurer]]s, and even the [[erinyes]] devils that prowled the city streets.<ref name=D&D.N\" />\n\nAfter learning that the Ashmadai cultists had broken into the [[Crypts of the Vigilant Eye]] to steal ''[[shield]]s of [[Helm]]'', he aided the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] in reclaiming them from their fiendish clutches. They worked together one more time to kill one of the cult's leaders, a priest by the name of [[Halas|Halas the Pure]].<ref name=D&D.N\" />\n\nHe later led his ranger squad into [[Rothé Valley]] so they could aid the [[Rothé Valley|local village]] from the onslaught of [[drow]] slavers. Dassar reunited with his adventurer ally from Helm's Hold and directed them to work with Imbross in order to infiltrate the slavers' camp and bring them down from the inside.<ref name=D&D.N\" />"
