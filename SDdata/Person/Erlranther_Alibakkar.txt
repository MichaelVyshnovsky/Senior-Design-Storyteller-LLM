'''Erlranther Alibakkar''' was the [[Meisarch]], the highest-ranking member of the [[Council of Six]], the government of [[Amn]], circa the {{YearlinkName|1370}}.

==Description==
By the time he had reached his 50s Lord Erlranther had a slightly large belly. He still had muscled arms that had grown large when he was a younger man.

==Personality==
In an argument, Erlranther would stare down upon his opponent and tense his muscles so that it appeared he was ready to fight.

==Relationships==
He had at least three younger brothers. The youngest of them was the rather lazy [[Skarmaen Alibakkar|Lord Skarmaen]] of [[Trademeet]].

==History==
In his early years, Erlranther was originally a caravan organizer and a fighter. In the {{YearlinkName|1333}} he entered the Council of Six as the lower-ranked [[Namarch]], and gradually made his way up the ranks.
