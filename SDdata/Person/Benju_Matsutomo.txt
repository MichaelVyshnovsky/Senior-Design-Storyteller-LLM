'''Benju Matsutomo''' was a renowned [[samurai]], head of the [[Matsutomo]] clan, and a [[daimyo]] of [[Aru Province]] in [[Wa]] in the late 1700s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==Description==
Described as a force of nature, Benju was a big man, with a broad build and great power, yet he was also as graceful as a dancer and could be just as silent. He had dark eyes and strong facial features. Though he normally spoke softly, when needed he took a commanding tone with ease. Aged in his late 60s by Wa Year 1775, he looked and acted like a man ten years younger. He typically wore only a plain brown kimono.

==Personality==
In his youth, Benju was a bold and daring warrior, known for his bravery and taking risks, as well as his mercy. However, as he matured and settled into the role of daimyo, he grew more cautious and focused on his family's future and guaranteeing its security and stability. Deciding his ancestors' failures resulted from overambition, he resolved to be as quiet, safe, unobtrusive, and error-free as he could, hoping that if the Matsutomos could hold the daimyate for a few generations, they might achieve a better position. He was angered when people talked about money, or at least asked him for it.

==Relations==
Benju had a much younger wife and a number of children, who lived in a ''[[yashiki]]'' in the capital city of [[Uwaji]]. This was part of the shogunate's policy of ''sankin kotai'', keeping them as effective hostages of the shogun. Benju's mother-in-law was Lady [[Satomi]]; the two of them despised each other.

His favorite consort was [[Naomi (consort)|Naomi]]. She loved Benju and did whatever she could to help him, even disobeying his direct orders if she considered them foolish. Afterward, Benju always accepted her reasoning and forgave her. She was pregnant with a child by him in 1775.

Benju's eldest daughter married [[Buntaro Ostato]], before she died in childbirth. Through Buntaro and her, Benju had a grandson. Surprisingly, Benju really liked his normally unlikable son-in-law, even tolerating rudeness from him that would get anyone else executed.

His nephew was [[Sumihiro Matsutomo]] and his niece was [[Takako Shimizu]].

His advisor, right-hand man, and best friend was [[Yuji Takaesu]]. Yuji was a loyal vassal who training the [[Home Guard]] samurai who defended Aru and Aru Province.

Benju was a good leader. As a warrior, he specialized in the katana. He was also proficient in [[horse]]manship, as well as calligraphy, poetry, heraldry, and the [[tea ceremony]]. He also enjoyed being outdoors and practicing [[falcon]]ry.

He loved music and often tried to learn to play. Unfortunately, he was terrible in any instrument he picked up, which saddened him greatly.

However, his real talent lay in the theater, particularly in noh. Benju regularly held plays with his friend Yuji Takaesu to entertain family and other members of his household.

==History==
Perhaps spurred on by the Matsutomo clan's past failures, Benju rose swiftly through the ranks of the [[shogun]]'s army and achieved great things. By the time he was thirty, the shogun's generals knew him well, and by the time he was forty, all knew he was meant for even higher office. Benju became famous across Wa for his bravery and wisdom, as well as his prowess as a warrior.

In his time, Benju led forces in many great battles, ranging from defending Wa against invading barbarians to quelling internal conflicts. These latter skirmishes weren't normally reported on, as they violated the shogun's peace, but one in particular proved significant. At the time, Benju and another commander were in alliance with [[Eiji Tanaka]]; Benju led the center, Eiji the right, and the other commander the left. When the battle reached its heigh and Benju's force was entirely committed, Eiji betrayed his allies, turning and attacking Benju's flank. It was only with tremendous skill at arms and tactics that Benju and his remaining ally achieved victory; their exploits would be told of in song. Afterward, they captured the treacherous Eiji and Benju himself executed him by beheading. Displaying his customary mercy, though it was not common in Wa and their lives were officially forfeit, Benju spared Eiji's family. Despite this, some in the [[Tanaka]] clan told the story that Benju murdered Eiji in jealousy of his superior skill as a general. Only Eiji's youngest son, [[Eichiro Tanaka]] would develop the grudge into a vengeful plot against Benju.

In {{YearlinkConvert|1758|WY}}, shogun [[Matasuuri Nagahide]] returned the daimyate of Aru Province once again to the Matsutomos, appointing Benju as its daimyo. He governed well but as he grew older he worried about his family's future and grew cautious in his governance.

He remained in power through {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}.

In the summer pilgrimage season of that year, a variety of strange and disturbing incidents around Aru threatened the [[pilgrim]]s going to the [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]] for the vital [[Ceremony of the Three Thousand Steps]]. Thus, for the good of the town and the Matsutomo clan, Benju focused on ensuring the safety of the pilgrims and the smooth performance of the ceremony. From his intelligence network (among them the headman of the neighboring village of [[Anjiro]]), he knew some plot was underway, but not the specifics of it, except that Eichiro was behind it and had hired unidentified [[ninja]]s (the [[Yamaguchi]] clan). However, he could not respond with force, lest he break the shogun's peace. Therefore, on Yuji's counsel, he hired the [[Ohara]] ninja clan to counter these other ninja and covertly protect both pilgrims and his family members. In addition, seven days before the ceremony, Benju hired an adventuring party recently arrived in Aru to investigate, recognizing the value of a fresh set of eyes, but he was guarded about the exact details of the "incidents"; he had the samurai [[Tsukku]] summon them from [[The Waiting Stone]] for a midnight meeting at his donjon. The shogun later sent his inspector [[Hiro Matsu]] to both honor Benju and observe how he handled matters.

One evening, Benju organized an evening gathering for himself, Naomi, Yuji, Buntaro, Sumihiro, Takako, Satomi, [[Toshikazu Wada]], and the adventuring party on the vantage point on the hill north of Aru, beside the [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]]. Benju asked the adventurers for reports on how their investigation was proceeding. While watching the sunset, he also commenced a poetry competition among the guests. The evening was ruined when the temple's great [[brass]] bell broke when the hour was rung. On a later evening, Benju, Yuji, and Toshikazu met the adventurers in the North Tower of Aru's Castle District for another update. This time, a ninja attacked Toshikazu and fled and Benju ordered the adventurers to assist in guarding the donjon. Late in the night, disguised Yamaguchi ninja infiltrated the donjon and attacked Benju in his room (though he had swapped with Yuji); he defended himself handily before the adventurers came to his aid. Eventually, many, but not all, of the incidents were revealed to be the work of the vengeful Eichiro Tanaka seeking to embarrass Benju before the shogun, who was expected to dispose of Benju and name Eichiro as daimyo in his place. However, when the adventurers mistakenly investigated or even accused Buntaro, Benju angrily dismissed them from this service. It was only when they returned, while Benju was having tea with Lady Satomi, with evidence of her involvement in Eichiro's scheme that he accepted them back into his service. Benju interrogated Satomi, even threatening to execute her and her daughter—his own wife—to get the truth out of her. She told the adventures how to contact the Yamaguchi so they could alert the ninja about Eichiro's intended betrayal.  

Finally, the Ceremony of the Three Thousand Steps went ahead, with Benju and his advisors and family in attendance. It was interrupted when the Yamaguchi ninja—who were meant to attack and disrupt the procession, so Eichiro Tanaka, mastermind behind them could step in with his forces and defeat them, thus discrediting Benju—instead surprised and betrayed Eichiro and his samurai, revealing the scheme. Desperate, Eichiro attacked Hiro Matsu, and was defeated by the adventurers. Shortly after, [[Daisake Mayazato]] and his three ninjas, [[Smoke (ninja)|Smoke]], [[Snake (ninja)|Snake]], and [[Moonlight]], appeared and demanded the Ceremony be cancelled forever. They and the adventurers fought a duel to decide whether it should go ahead or not. Most likely, it finally did. Benju then rewarded and praised the adventurers.

Afterward, Benju may have hired the same adventurers to look into the attacks on the Yama-''san'' river dam. They found the culprit to be the [[shen lung]] [[Li Kit Su]]—the dragon of the river was angered by the disruptions to his river.

Benju also requested these adventurers to investigate the rumored "tiger-bird spirit" seen haunting Aru after it attacked his niece, Takako. They found it was actually a [[tigbanua buso]] that had infected Takako.

==Possessions==
Benju had a [[katana]] and [[wakizashi]] that were rarely ever far from his hand. The katana was a quality weapon and the Matsutomo family heirloom. He only wore armor when needed for battle or protocol.

==Home==
Benju and his remaining family lived in his [[donjon (Aru)|donjon]] in the Castle District of the town of [[Aru]]. His own room there was austere, even nearly empty, with none of the trappings of a powerful noble. Benju enjoyed meditating in the parlor, perhaps contemplating his wife's watercolor painting.
