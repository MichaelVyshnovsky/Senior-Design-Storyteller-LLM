'''King Highstead''' was the ruler of the [[Onusclan]] tribe of [[orc]]s from the [[Orsraun Mountains]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
King Highstead's reign was in full power ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}. Under his rule, Onusclan orcs raided neighboring territories of the southern [[Ancient Ax]] [[goblin]] clan and the eastern [[Tattered Cloth]] [[Kobold|kobolds]]. Due to regular raids, populations of all three factions of the Orsrauns were kept in check and away from becoming a problem for [[Turmish]]. However, King Highstead's orcs trespassed in the [[Orbrekh]], the territory of a group of [[Giant|giants]] calling themselves the [[community of the high brows]], the giants decimated Onusclan.
