Velkor Minairr, also called Velkor of the Valiant Arm, was a mercenary of the Bloodaxe Mercenary Company around 1358 DR.
Originally second in command, Velkor assumed leadership of the company when its founder and first leader, Deldagg Huldgrym, died in 1331 DR. Though largely inactive in 1358, Velkor and his company were occasionally hired to fight orcs in the north.
