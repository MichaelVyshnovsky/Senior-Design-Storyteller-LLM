'''Velkor Minairr''', also called '''Velkor of the Valiant Arm''', was a [[mercenary]] of the [[Bloodaxe Mercenary Company]] around [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Originally second in command, Velkor assumed leadership of the company when its founder and first leader, [[Deldagg Huldgrym]], died in [[1331 DR]]. Though largely inactive in 1358, Velkor and his company were occasionally hired to fight [[orc]]s in the [[North Faer√ªn|north]].
