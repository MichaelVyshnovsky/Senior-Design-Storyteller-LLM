        "mainbody": "Ugbuz was an orog veteran serving under a \"scarred\" wizard of the Cult of the Dragon in the ruins of Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR.\nUgbuz did not like the Cult of the Dragon nor the wizard he was honor-bound serving. He disliked most members of the Cult, especially its leader, Kya Mordrayn, as he felt she was usurping the titles of the deity Ugbuz worshiped, Shar.\nUgbuz revered his dark lady Shar. He was convinced that he was touched by her avatar dressed in feathers, the event that turned him to worship the goddess. He spoke often and at length about his deity, to utter irritation of his fellow veteran stationed alongside Ugbuz in the Dwarven Dungeons.\nIn 1369 DR, Ugbuz, along with another fellow orog veteran, were honor-bound to serving one of the wizards of the Cult of the Dragon that occupied the ruins of Myth Drannor. Under the Cults command, Ugbuz and the other veteran were stationed in the Halls of Light, tasked guarding the stairs up to the Room of Words inside the House of Gems. When the orogs encountered the group of adventurers opposing the Cult of the Dragon, the Veiled Ones, the veterans were delighted to know that the heroes slew their master. Both orogs were friendly enough and shared information with the adventurers who freed them from servitude. The orog veterans shared the info on recently captured hin junk dealer, and merchant Nottle, the activities of the Cult and the pool of radiance, as well as warned the Veiled Ones of the high concentration of Cultists and fellow orogs in the House of Gems.\nWhen the heroes asked the orogs about the Mistress of the Night, Shar, Ugbuz started praising the goddess, claiming she touched him, to great disdain of the veteran orog next to him. The fellow orog attacked Ugbuz, trying to make him stop praising the goddess, killing the Shars devotee in the process."
