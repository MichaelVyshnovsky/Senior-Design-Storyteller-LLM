        "mainbody": "Rydah the Storm Soother () was the high priestess of Umberlee in Mulmaster.\nRydah was a cunning and cool-headed individual. Despite not being violent herself, she believed that the last resort was should always be violence. With that method, she protected herself and Umberlees position in the city.\nRydah rose through the ranks of the local Church of Umberlee with a combination of politics and force. At last, she killed the previous high priest in a duel on the docks.\nIn 1491 DR, she was concerned by Drayson Fivestarss preaching to devotees of her church. She hoped to find someone to stop him."
