        "Activities": "Kalda was a paladin and an officer of the [[Hammer of Moradin]] in [[Earthfast]].",
        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], after [[Furgis Boltsmelter]] stole the [[elemental codex]] from Earthfast, Kalda was chosen to lead a Hammer squad to purse him and retake the item. Near [[Mulmaster]], she and her squad confronted Furgis and his adventuring party bodyguards when the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] attacked both groups. In the battle against earth cultists, Kalda and most of her men died.",
        "Personality": "Kalda was guided by her vows to [[Moradin]]. She knew that not everyone held the same values that she did and did not expect that others lived up to her standards. Kalda respected all people with a strong personal code and disliked those who changed their mind for money."
