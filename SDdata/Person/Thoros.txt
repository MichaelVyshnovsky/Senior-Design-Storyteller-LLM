Ranger '''Thoros''' was a scout for the [[Company Yargo]] mercenary group that operated throughout the Realms during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a burly man whose face was decorated with particularly stylish face tattoo.

==History==
Thoros was a member of the expedition that ventured up to [[Pirates' Skyhold]] aboard the ''[[Buccaneer's Tear]]'' in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. He and his fellow scout [[Shaben Shortcloak]] braved the perilous [[Vilebog]] swamp and made it past the [[lizardfolk]] denizens en route to [[Skull Fortress]], but the two became separated and Thoros believed Shaben required rescuing.

He worked with the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to "evict" many of the lizardfolk that dwelled within sunken village surrounding the old fort, in order to save his friend and fellow scout.
