They offered to save the missing sprouts in exchange for help from the Sacred Seer to find the braincap. After pondering the offer, Agaricus decided to accept the help of the adventurers.\nThe Sacred Seer was a macabre and brooding creature. Her goal was the decay of all the universe, believing this would benefit her race. The Sacred Seer refused to admit to worshiping Zuggtmoy."
