        "mainbody": "rjixtilex Vardhira was a dragonborn of Tymanther and the matriarch of Clan Yrjixtilex in 1486 DR. She was a direct descendant of Esham-Ana.\nVardhira had coppery-tinged scales with a silvery-gray patina.\nIn 1486 DR, Vardhira got involved in an investigation into a series of murders in Djerad Thymar, when a city guard member of Clan Yrjixtilex was killed by a maurezhi servant of the God-King Gilgeam.\nIn the wake of the first Tymanther-Unther War, Vardhira allied with other clan elders, such as Verthisathurgiesh Anala and Fenkenkabradon Ishkhanak, to put forward Yrjixtilex Kallan as a candidate for the Vanquisher title, in the hopes of raising her clans status, and to outmaneuver Clan Kepeshkmolik."
