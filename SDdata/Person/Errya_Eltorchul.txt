Born around 1340 DR, Errya Eltochul was the youngest daughter of the Eltorchul noble family of Waterdeep. She fled into Undermountain in disgrace around 1375 DR. 
In 1367 DR, Errya befriended Brandon Korelwyn, whom she used to gather information about rival politicians.
After fleeing into Undermountain sometime before 1372 DR, Errya studied magic at the Halasters Heirs magic academy.
While living in Undermountain, Errya charmed the bard Ellithral and ordered him to direct all the adventurers attracted by the dying message of Halaster Blackcloak to a particular spot in the dungeon with the promise of a "post-earthquake" map of Undermountain. She would meet with these adventurers accompanied by her two bugbear bodyguards.
Errya was a very self-centered individual. If she didnt get what she wanted or receive proper praise for her actions she would hold a grudge and would often extract an untraceable revenge against her offender. Her mother admired her ruthless aptitude, while her father was oblivious.  
Errya was obsessed with regaining the lost fortune of her family. Her demeanor was described as viper-like.
