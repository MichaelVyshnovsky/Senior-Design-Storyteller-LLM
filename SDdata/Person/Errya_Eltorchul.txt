Born around [[1340 DR]], '''Errya Eltochul''' was the youngest daughter of the [[Eltorchul]] [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble family]] of [[Waterdeep]]. She fled into [[Undermountain]] in disgrace around [[1375 DR]]. 

==History==
In [[1367 DR]], Errya befriended [[Brandon Korelwyn]], whom she used to gather information about rival politicians.

After fleeing into Undermountain sometime before [[1372 DR]], Errya studied magic at the [[Halaster's Heirs]] magic academy.

While living in Undermountain, Errya [[Charm|''charmed'']] the bard [[Ellithral]] and ordered him to direct all the adventurers attracted by the dying message of [[Halaster Blackcloak]] to a particular spot in the dungeon with the promise of a "post-earthquake" map of Undermountain. She would meet with these adventurers accompanied by her two [[bugbear]] bodyguards.

==Personality==
Errya was a very self-centered individual. If she didn't get what she wanted or receive proper praise for her actions she would hold a grudge and would often extract an untraceable revenge against her offender. Her mother admired her ruthless aptitude, while her father was oblivious.  

Errya was obsessed with regaining the lost fortune of her family. Her demeanor was described as viper-like.
