        "mainbody": "[[File:MirranNym.jpeg|thumb|242x242px|Mirran and [[Nym (storm giant)|Nym]] entertaining guests.]]\n'''Mirran''' was a [[storm giant]] princess sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].",
        "History": "Mirran was the eldest child of the storm giant king [[Hekaton]] at the time of the shattering of the [[Ordning (social_structure)|ordning]]. The giant found herself to be in opposition to her mother, [[Neri]], and younger sister, [[Serissa]], because the latter was appointed as the new heir to the throne. However, Mirran forged an alliance with her sister, [[Nym (storm_giant)|Nym]], who equally shared hatred towards her family.\n\nThe two plotted against Neri and Hekaton, though they did not act until the blue dragon, [[Iymrith]], appeared before them under the disguise of a storm giant. Iymrith quickly became a mother figure to the two sisters, and aided them with the assassination of Neri and kidnapping of Hekaton.\n\nSoon after (roughly around the late 1480s or early 1490s DR), Iymrith became an advisor for the newly-appointed queen Serissa, but continued to help Mirran and Nym plot against their sister.\n\nMirran and Nym were entrained several giants ambassadors who gave news about Serissa's plans for the future.",
        "Personality": "Mirran was described as an unpredictable, spoiled child. She wanted the power of the [[Wyrmskull Throne]] for herself, believing it was rightfully hers, as she was the eldest daughter of Hekaton. Mirran believed that she was the one destined to rule all giants and that they would kneel before her. She planned to resurrect the ancient empire of [[Ostoria]], with plans to destroy the small folk. If discovered, Mirran tried to blame Nym to be the main conspirator."
