'''Skixtalq''', also known as '''Skixtalq the Obscurant''', was one of the most powerful [[elder orb]]s in [[Faer√ªn]]. 

==Activities==
The [[beholder]] was the [[Chosen]] of [[Gzemnid]], who was said to have send visions to it. For its position, Skixtalq was greatly respected in [[Zokir]] and the rulers of the city regularly sought its counsel. Skixtalq could be considered to be a kind of sage, being the hive's preeminent acquirer of knowledge.

It acquired its moniker as a result of Skixtalq's relentless efforts to erase knowledge about beholders on the surface. Often, it had its charmed agents attack libraries and sages, stealing or destroying tomes about beholders and silencing arcane scholars who studied them.
