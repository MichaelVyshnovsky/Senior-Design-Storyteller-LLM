'''Alledec''' was a life-long [[priest]] from a religious order dedicated to [[Ilmater]], who lived in the 9{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Alledec had been a devotee of Ilmater for twenty years before he decided to leave a legacy after his time on [[Toril]] was over. He began working on the [[enchanted]] weapon called ''[[Three White Doves]]'' - a masterfully crafted [[mace]] weapon of black-enameled [[steel]] and a handle of [[ivory]]. The weapon was completed in the {{YearlinkName|850}}, and Alledec died peacefully in his sleep in the {{YearlinkName|853}}. After the cleric's death, the ''Three White Doves'' was entrusted to an Ilmatiri [[fighter]], and after that, to the traveling cleric – [[Recken the Bold]], who lost it in a struggle against a powerful [[vampire]] near the [[Trollbark Forest]].
