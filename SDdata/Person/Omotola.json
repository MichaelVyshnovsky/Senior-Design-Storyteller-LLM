        "mainbody": "Madame '''Omotola''' was a well-respected [[jeweler]] and [[gem]] merchant proprieter of [[The Glitter Gala]] from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|Drab attire, lackluster skin - my darling, you need my gems. They'll brighten even a [[ghoul]] like yourself! A [[skeleton]] would be more accurate - you have good bones, darling, you just need decoration. And you're in the right place.|Mme Omotola}}",
        "Description": "Omotola was a middle-aged [[human]] woman with a dark skin tone and blue eyes. She kept her blonde curly hair cut short. Her garb of choice was an expensive, richly embroidered green gown.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Omotola's shop had been doing business with the rich and powerful of the Gate for over twenty years. She dealt in gems, both mundane and magical, imported from [[Amn]], [[Cormyr]], and even [[Damara]], and sold custom-crafted jewelry, including a pair of resplendent and [[enchanted]] wedding [[ring|bands]] for Lady [[Patriar]] [[Firelia Jannath]]. As the [[Absolute crisis]] began threatening the city, many refugees tried to find employment and lodgings after fleeing from their homes. One such individual was [[Ellswin Glimrock]], an artisan refugee from the city of [[Elturel]]. Ellswin wrote to Omotola, praising her glittering shop, and offered her services as a resident jeweler. Notably, one of Madame Omotola's business partners or investors was Lord [[Enver Gortash]], secretly one of the leaders of the dreaded [[Cult of the Absolute]]. Omotola's business also supplied other fanciful shops with gemstones, such as [[Figaro Pennygood]]'s [[Facemaker's Boutique]]."
