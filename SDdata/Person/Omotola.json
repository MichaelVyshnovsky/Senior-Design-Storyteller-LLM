She kept her blonde curly hair cut short. Her garb of choice was an expensive, richly embroidered green gown.\nBy the , Omotolas shop had been doing business with the rich and powerful of the Gate for over twenty years. She dealt in gems, both mundane and magical, imported from Amn, Cormyr, and even Damara, and sold custom-crafted jewelry, including a pair of resplendent and enchanted wedding bands for Lady Patriar Firelia Jannath. As the Absolute crisis began threatening the city, many refugees tried to find employment and lodgings after fleeing from their homes. One such individual was Ellswin Glimrock, an artisan refugee from the city of Elturel. Ellswin wrote to Omotola, praising her glittering shop, and offered her services as a resident jeweler. Notably, one of Madame Omotolas business partners or investors was Lord Enver Gortash, secretly one of the leaders of the dreaded Cult of the Absolute. Omotolas business also supplied other fanciful shops with gemstones, such as Figaro Pennygoods Facemakers Boutique."
