        "History": "At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Yarin retired from the life of thievery and spent his time in the illicit backrooms of the [[Copper Coronet]] in the slums of Athkatla's [[Athkatla/River District|River District]]. He was aware of the recently raging guild war in the city, but he was not a member of the [[Shadow Thieves]]. At some point, he was approached by a member of the new guild, secretly a [[vampire]] coven, trying to recruit Yarin. The new mysterious guild was not picky in who they recruited; younglings and old men like Yarin were among them, and the offer was quite lucrative. However, Yarin had little interest in returning to the rogue's life."
