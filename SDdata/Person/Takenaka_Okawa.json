        "mainbody": "'''Takenaka Okawa''' was the [[shikken]] of [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].",
        "History": "Okawa became shikken in [[1349 DR]] after the conclusion of the [[Hojo War]], where the [[Takenaka clan]] gained supremacy over the [[Hojo clan]], putting a puppet shogun on the throne. However, [[Takenaka Sugawara]], the true military leader of the war, couldn't ascend to the shikken position because he was of no blood relation to the [[shogun]], a trait possessed instead by his half-brother, Okawa.",
        "Personality": "Okawa was reserved and aloof, ambitious and very able in manipulate others. He was able in administrative works but not an inspired military leader or a good diplomat. Okawa considered Sugawara only a jealous man and was divided by the necessity to keep united his clan and frustration for Sugawara's actions against him"
