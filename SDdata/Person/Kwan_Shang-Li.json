        "mainbody": "Kwan Shang-Li was a young Shou monk belonging to the Standing Tree monastic order.  Kwans mother was an elven ranger whom his father married against his familys wishes.  Kwan learned woodcraft and his devotion to the goddess Mielikki from his mother.  When Kwan was fourteen, his mother was killed by pirates.  Kwan felt great affection for his father, Kwan Yung, but their relationship was often tense and they tended to verbally spar with each other.  In addition to his skills as a monk, Kwan was a respected scholar.\nKwan and his father traveled together in the area around the Sea of Fallen Stars for many years.  The monastery sent them on a mission to recover two rare and dangerous books written by Liou Chang that revealed the secret of opening teleportation gates.  The books were believed to have been on the Grayling when it went down in 1399 DR.  In order to locate the wreck of the Grayling, Kwan broke into the wizard Ravel Kouldars tower on Pirate Isle and stole the Graylings log.  Kwan narrowly escaped with his life and then traveled with his father to Westgate on a ship owned by the monastery.  While sailing to Westgate, Kwan began to experience visions sent by the eladrin Caelynna.\t\nAt Westgate, they reprovisioned and Kwan reunited with two friends, the tiefling fighter Iados and the dragonborn paladin Thava.  While in Westgate he recruited a young mage named Amree to act as ships mage.  The ship sailed into the Sea of Fallen Stars and was sunk by Caelynna and their ship settled at the bottom of the sea in Cealynnas domain.  Because of Caelynnas magic, the crew was able to breath water and move about as if on land.  Caelynna took Kwan to her citadel where she expected him to translate Liou Changs books.  While in the citadel, he found a secret passage and made his way to Caelynnas chambers.  Caelynna had opened a small portal to the Feywild and Kwan was able to communicate with one of Caelynnas eladrin enemies.  The eladrin gave Kwan a staff infused with eladrin magic to use against Caelynna.\t\nKwan left the castle and rejoined his shipmates just as they were refloating their ship.  Once the ship was on the surface, Caelynna attacked and Kwan used the magic staff to kill her.\nKwan had dark, close-cropped hair and turquoise eyes.  He had tattoos of oak trees on his forearms.\t\nKwan Shang-Li wore leather armor.  He carried many weapons but his primary fighting weapons were two batons he kept hidden in the sleeves of his garment.  He also kept an elven dagger strapped to his leg and often carries a longsword or katana.\nCategoryMonks\nCategoryShou\nCategoryHalf-elves\nCategorySages\nCategoryWorshipers of Mielikki\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\n5xwoisesc94rdg5z1gtxih4wuz9jzic"
