The Nameless One was a shadovar girl and a high-ranking priestess and Chosen of Shar.
She resided in Sakkors with her parents until it was destroyed around 1484 DR and her parents died in the fall.
In 1486 DR, the Nameless One went to check the shadovars secret village full of captive Chosen built by wizard Adolican Rhand.
Later she asked to speak with Farideh.
When Faridehs party made their escape, the Nameless One tried to stop them but was defeated by the just-arrived Mehen. She died during the destruction of the village.
