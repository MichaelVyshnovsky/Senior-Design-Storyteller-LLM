The '''Nameless One''' was a [[shadovar]] girl and a high-ranking priestess and [[Chosen]] of [[Shar]].

==History==
She resided in [[Sakkors]] with her parents until it was destroyed around [[1484 DR]] and her parents died in the fall.

In [[1486 DR]], the Nameless One went to check the shadovar's secret village full of captive [[Chosen]] built by wizard [[Adolican Rhand]].

Later she asked to speak with [[Farideh]].

When Farideh's party made their escape, the Nameless One tried to stop them but was defeated by the just-arrived [[Mehen]]. She died during the destruction of the village.
