Lightning was an ironically named black gelding horse because it was docile enough to let the saurial hero Dragonbait handle it circa 1357 DR.
In 1357 DR, companions of the hero Alias purchased Lightning, along with other horses from Dimswart Manor in Cormyr.
Lightning was a pack horse and was purchased especially for its calm demeanor, letting Dragonbait ride it, unlike all other mounts available. Dragonbait rode the horse to Suzail, the Shadow Gap, Shadowdale, and Yulash, where the heroes were forced to abandon their mounts while pursuing the Abomination of Moander through Cormanthor.
