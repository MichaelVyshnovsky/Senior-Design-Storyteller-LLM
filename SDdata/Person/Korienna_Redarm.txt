'''Korienna Redarm''' was a [[human]] female bandit leader in southern [[Amn]] around the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.

==Possessions==
Korienna was carried ''[[Mordemar]]'', a magic [[longsword]] that was particularly effective against [[undead]] creatures. It was a gift from her grandfather.

==Activities==
Korienna was originally an officer, as indicated by her [[plate mail|full plate]] armor and shield, but deserted the [[Council Army]] and chose a lawless life. She led a small band of about a dozen well-equipped deserters and they marauded up and down the [[South Road (Amn)|South Road]] between [[Eshpurta]] and [[Hillfort Keshla]], and perhaps beyond, robbing travelers for their horses and other valuables.
