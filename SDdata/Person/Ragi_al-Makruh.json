        "mainbody": "Ragi al-Makruh was an influential merchant inhabiting Jumlat in the Pearl Cities region of west Zakhara in 1367 DR. \nRagi was exactly what he appeared to beâ€“a hulking angry brute. It was whispered that he had more money than brains and more brains than charm.\nRagi controlled most of the fleet associated with pearl diving. Many were surprised that he didnt immediately run his familys business into the ground upon gaining control.\nHe spent much of his time paying homage to the Sultan and his Chief Vizier, collecting favors to be used when the moment was right."
