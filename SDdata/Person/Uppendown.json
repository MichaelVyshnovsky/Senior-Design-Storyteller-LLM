        "Activities": "Along with [[Panana]], Uppendown was responsible for prepping bread dough made from Gnomengarde's distinctive green mushrooms. His role was to shape the dough into loaves before baking. He took his work very seriously, and worked like an artist in deep concentration with his tongue sticking out at an angle as he sculpted the dough.",
        "Abilities": "Like all the other [[gnome]]s in Gnomengarde, Uppendown had some training as a [[wizard]] in addition to his innate abilities. In combat, he preferred to attack with [[spells]] like ''[[ray of frost]]'' and ''[[magic missile]]''."
