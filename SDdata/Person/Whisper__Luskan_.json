        "mainbody": "'''Whisper''' was a vicious criminal in [[Luskan]].",
        "Activities": "Whisper was a criminal with a vile reputation. She had a network of fence contacts and was one of the few who could smuggle people inside and outside the city without the knowledge of the [[High Captains of Luskan]]. Whisper was always secretly followed by her minions when she traded with a client, in order to protect her.",
        "History": "In [[1356 DR]], Whisper traded a map to [[Mithral Hall]] with [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Bruenor Battlehammer]]. Later, [[Artemis Entreri]] asked her for information about the [[Companions of the Hall]]. Whisper tried to double-cross Entreri but the assassin subdued her and later killed Whisper in order to leave no witnesses."
