She had a network of fence contacts and was one of the few who could smuggle people inside and outside the city without the knowledge of the High Captains of Luskan. Whisper was always secretly followed by her minions when she traded with a client, in order to protect her.\nIn 1356 DR, Whisper traded a map to Mithral Hall with Drizzt DoUrden and Bruenor Battlehammer. Later, Artemis Entreri asked her for information about the Companions of the Hall. Whisper tried to double-cross Entreri but the assassin subdued her and later killed Whisper in order to leave no witnesses."
