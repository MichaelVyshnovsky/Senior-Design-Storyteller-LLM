Nestra Ruthiol was the ruler of Yartar and a member of the Lords Alliance during the late 15 century DR.
Nestra considered her allegiance to the Lords Alliance vital for the survival and prosperity of her city. She permitted the Harpers and Zhentarim to travel the streets, but she only dealt with them when it was absolutely necessary.
Ruthiol was accused of murdering a former lover, Kaidrod Palyr, after arguing publicly with his wife, Tiarshe. While she was cleared of the charges, some speculated that the Hand of Yartar criminal organization was involved.
She ruled Yartar while the Elemental Evil crisis of 1491 DR occurred.
