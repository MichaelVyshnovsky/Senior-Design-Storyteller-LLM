Pallabar was a rock gnome living in Gnomengarde in the late 15 century DR.
Like many other Gnomengarde inhabitants, Pallabar preferred not to talk about his homes troubles with outsiders.
Like all the other gnomes in Gnomengarde, Pallabar had some training as a wizard in addition to his innate magical abilities.
