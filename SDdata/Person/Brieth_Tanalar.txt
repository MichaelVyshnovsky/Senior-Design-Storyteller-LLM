Brieth Tanalar was a ex-Purple Dragon, horse breeder and businessman of Tilverton in the 1350sâ€“1360s.
Brieth was often suspicious and unfriendly towards strangers, suspecting that everyone was a horse-thief.
Brieth bred and trained horses on his ranch near Tilverton, with his business represented in town at Tanalars Fine Mounts. His reputation for fine horses brought customers from as far away as Calimshan, who purchased his steeds for war, riding, racing, and studding. Although his prices were high and his attitude unfriendly, his services remained in demand, and he was the most prominent and single most important businessman in Tilverton.
