'''Brieth Tanalar''' was a [[Purple Dragons|ex-Purple Dragon]], [[horse]] breeder and businessman of [[Tilverton]] in the 1350sâ€“1360s.

==Personality==
Brieth was often suspicious and unfriendly towards strangers, suspecting that everyone was a horse-thief.

==Activities==
Brieth bred and trained horses on his ranch near Tilverton, with his business represented in town at [[Tanalar's Fine Mounts]]. His reputation for fine horses brought customers from as far away as [[Calimshan]], who purchased his steeds for war, riding, racing, and studding. Although his prices were high and his attitude unfriendly, his services remained in demand, and he was the most prominent and single most important businessman in Tilverton.
