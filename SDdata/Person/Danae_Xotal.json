        "mainbody": "Danae Xotal was a Thayan agent who was stationed in Icewind Dale in 1485 DR.\nThe agent was described to be fairly plain-looking, though she had jet-black hair.\nDanae was a barkeep of the Lucky Liar Tavern of Lonelywood. The astute woman would make notes about the potential information drunk patrons might blurt out. She wouldnt spend much time talking to the other residents of Icewind Dale, though when she did, it was usually small-talk.\nSeveral years prior to 1485 DR, Danae was tasked with traveling to Icewind Dale. Whilst here, she was to find out if anyone planned to move against Szass Tam and the Red Wizards of Thay. She had some success in this role, and enemies she identified suffered unexplained disappearances."
