        "mainbody": "'''Ketsarra Shadowscale''' was a [[shadowslain]] [[half-dragon|half–]][[black dragon]] [[lizardfolk]] [[cleric]] of [[Shar]]",
        "History": "Ketsarra was the daughter of the black dragon [[Despayr]] and an unnamed lizard-woman of the enslaved remnants of [[Dragonslayer (tribe)|Dragonslayer]] tribe. Despayr used the power of the ''[[shadow shard]]'' to transform Ketsarra and the other lizardfolk slaves into undead creatures, and she became chieftain of the new Shadowscale tribe.\n\nIn the service of [[Esvele Graycastle]]'s scheme, Despayr sought to dominate much of the Vast Swamp. Their goal was to tear a hole in the [[Weave]] of [[magic]] and so form a [[dead-magic zone]] over all the Vast Swamp. It was to be a powerbase for the followers of Shar. In the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], at Despayr's behest, Ketsarra led the Shadowscales in a savage war upon the tribes of the Vast Swamp, particularly the other lizardfolk, whom they captured and carried off to become Shadowscales themselves.\n\nIn early [[Eleint]], adventurers in service to [[Mystra]] investigating the Sharrans' activities assaulted the [[Lost Refuge]], and Ketsarra was presumably destroyed in the fighting.",
        "Activities": "Ketsarra was the chieftain of the Shadowscale tribe. From the Sharrans' base in the [[Lost Refuge]], alongside [[Thieraven]], a [[shadar-kai (fey)|shadar-kai]] ally, she also commanded the shadar-kai forces, [[Bestra Mornscroll]], and other beings, as well overseeing communications and transportation of prisoners to the [[Monastery of the Ebon Dome]] through the [[Dusk Lord's Passage]] ''[[portal]]''.",
        "Description": "Of black dragon descent, Ketsarra had black scales and horns that jutted forward. Being shadowslain, she was wreathed in lambent shadows and her eyes held an unholy glow, while her body was emaciated, decayed, and even skeletal.",
        "Powers": "Ketsarra had the powers of a shadowslain undead and the ability to breathe [[acid]] like a black dragon, and commanded [[divine]] [[spell]]s as a cleric of Shar, choosing the [[Darkness domain|Darkness]] and [[Evil domain]]s. She also employed a particularly tenacious form of [[Shadow Weave]] [[magic]].",
        "Possessions": "Ketsarra fought with a ''+1 [[spear]]'' and ''+1 [[heavy wooden shield]]'', with a half-dozen [[javelin]]s. She was also equipped with a ''[[javelin of lightning]]'', a ''[[potion]]'' of ''[[inflict serious wounds]]'',  four vials of [[unholy water]], and 50-[[gp]] of [[silver]] dust as a component for her ''[[desecrate]]'' spell. Her unholy symbol of Shar was a ''[[disc of secrets]]''."
