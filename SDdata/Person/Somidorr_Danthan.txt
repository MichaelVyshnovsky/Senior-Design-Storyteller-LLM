'''Somidorr Danthan''' was a half-elf man and smuggler of the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]].

Somidorr made a number of shrewd decisions in his illicit trade, and by [[1358]] had become very rich and dangerous. He desired to increase his own power with the acquisition of [[magical item]]s, and didn't care who he took them from or how.
