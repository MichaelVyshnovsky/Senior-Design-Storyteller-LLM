        "mainbody": "'''Sildar Hallwinter''' was a retired knight from [[Neverwinter]] and later a member of the [[Town Council of Phandalin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Sildar was nearly 50 years old in [[1491 DR]].{{Phandelver-time}}",
        "Personality": "Despite his restrained and almost cold mannerisms and speech, Sildar was kind-hearted{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|6}} and sincere, although lacking in confidence and charisma. He wished to see the town of Phandalin prosper and to ensure that innocents&mdash;even fools&mdash;never came to any harm.",
        "Activities": "As a citizen and later town councilor of [[Phandalin]], Sildar's role was to ensure the safety of the town's mining and timber operations, and to see to it that nothing interfered with them. In this way, he strove to help elevate Phandalin to a position of relevance in the region's trade and commerce.",
        "Relationships": "He was a loyal member of the [[Lords' Alliance]], and had close ties to both [[Neverwinter]] and [[Waterdeep]]. He was a friend of [[Gundren Rockseeker]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|38}}\n\nHe was a member of the knightly [[Hallwinter]] family{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Vecna: Nest of the Eldritch Eye}} and had an adopted daughter named [[Alana Hallwinter|Alana]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|15}}\n\nAs a member of the town council of Phandalin, he was well respected and trusted by the townsfolk. He seemed to get along well with fellow councilors [[Trilena Stonehill]] and [[Halia Thornton]], but not so much with councilor [[Harbin Wester]], whom he saw as fundamentally corrupt.",
        "History": "Sildar originally hailed from Neverwinter. In his younger days, Sildar was a soldier and earned himself a place of honor among the [[Griffon Cavalry]] of Waterdeep.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, Sildar was working as a sellsword.\n\nFollowing his rescue from the Cragmaws by [[adventurer]]s, Sildar's confidence in himself was badly shaken, and he retired from his martial lifestyle in Phandalin. Despite his lack of confidence, he continued to stay in shape and quickly became respected within the community as an honorable and brave man. When Phandalin formed a town council not long after his retirement had started, he was elected as one of the three councilors.\n\nEarly in his tenure as councilor, his adopted daughter Alana disappeared into the [[Crooked Forest]]. Unable to go after her for fear that his disappearance would cause anxiety in Phandalin, he hired adventurers to find her and to return with her discretely.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1496}},{{AI-time}} Sildar campaigned against Harbin Wester in Phandalin's first mayoral election. He was generally lacking in the swagger and oratory ability expected of an aspiring politician, but was motivated to push against Harbin's corrupt and self-serving agenda."
