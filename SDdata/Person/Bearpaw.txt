'''Bearpaw''' was an immensely strong and affable [[ranger]] who lived in [[northwest Faerûn]] some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Bearpaw was a sort of man who made friends and earned respect wherever he went. During his time patrolling the [[Cloakwood Forest]], to everyone's surprise, Bearpaw befriended a strangely benevolent [[ogre]]. This friendship earned the ranger a massive [[enchanted]] composite [[longbow]] called the ''[[Strong Arm]]''. The weapon could only be wielded by a person of great physical strength, but luckily, Bearpaw was very strong. When the ranger died, his sons were unable to draw the longbow's [[bowstring]]. The best one son was able to do was to draw it halfway. Unable to use it, Bearpaw's wife sold the ''Strong Arm'' to a merchant traveling south. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the weapon ended up in the capital of [[Amn]], [[Athkatla]]..
