'''Jak Fleet''' (full name '''Jakert''') was a [[halfling]] [[cleric]] of [[Brandobaris]] and [[thief]] of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was an adventuring companion and best friend of [[Erevis Cale]].{{Cite dragon/277/Rogues Gallery: The Heroes of Shadow's Witness|101}}

He was born in [[Hillsfar]] but soon after his family escaped and relocated to [[Mistledale]]. There he became a thief, and later a priest.

In his early career, Jak served in the semi-secret organization known as the [[Harpers]]. He joined the Harpers because he really wanted to help people, but when Cale was in trouble and Jak asked for their help, he was refused. He left the Harpers soon after out of his undying loyalty to Cale.{{Fact}}

In the {{Yearlink|1373}}, they were thrust into a plot put together by the god [[Mask]] to steal from a temple of [[Cyric]], which resulted in a confrontation that ended his life.<ref> Jak Fleet died at the hands of a [[death slaad]] named [[Dolgan]] when fighting alongside Cale and [[Drasek Riven]]. As a result, Cale never forgave Mask for the loss of his friend.{{Fact}}

He loved to wear wide-brimmed hats, and often was found chewing on a pipe.{{Fact}}
