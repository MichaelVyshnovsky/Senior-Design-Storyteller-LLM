General '''Anglin''' of [[Seventon]] was a [[Netherese arcanist]] and a respected general in the Seventon militia.

==Personality==
Anglin was constantly worried about defending himself and the town of Seventon from attacks. This defensive focus reflected on the nature of the spells he invented.

Besides being a very well respected general, Anglin also ran a spellcraft school called the [[Summoned Sorcerer]]. In exchange for his teachings, he only asked pupils to serve in the Seventon militia for at least five years.

==History==
Anglin invented many of the prismatic spells, such as ''[[prismatic sphere]]'', ''[[prismatic spray]]'' and ''[[prismatic wall]]'', always from a defensive point of view. He was also credited with the ''[[magic mirror]]'' spell as a means to watch out for danger.

He was killed while researching for a new spell he would name ''Anglin's gateway''. The accident sucked him into a mystic portal.
