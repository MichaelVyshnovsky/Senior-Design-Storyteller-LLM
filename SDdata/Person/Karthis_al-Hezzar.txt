'''Karthis al-Hezzar''' was a merchant who sold his wares in [[Tethyr]] as of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
He sold a number of [[potion]]s, [[magic]]al [[scroll]]s, and a variety of [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s that held strong [[item enchantment|enchantments]].

==Activities==
Karthis and his fellow caravaneers regularly traveled the [[Ithal Road]] through [[Saradush]].

==History==
During the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]], in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Karthis and his caravan were traveling near the city of Saradush when they were set upon by soldiers loyal to the [[fire giant]] [[Yaga-Shura]]. While of his traveling companions were slain, Karthis managed to survive the initial onslaught thanks to the intervention of [[Abdel Adrian]] and his allies.

He planned on waiting in the area for some time, in the hopes of accompanying the next caravan that he encountered.
