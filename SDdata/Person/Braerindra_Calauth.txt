'''Braerindra Calauth''' was an [[elf|elven]] woman who was the last of House [[Calauth]] in [[Cormanthyr]]. After her death, she rose as a [[baelnorn]] and was entrusted by the [[Coronal]] to act as guardian of his quarters.

==Description==
Though deadly-looking, she was spectral and graceful. Prior to Elminster's meeting with the [[Coronal]], she manifested as a nude shape of blue mist. Her eyes were pits of shadow that winked with silver stars. The color of her shape was the effect of her unique ''[[mithrilskin]]'' spell, and other spells were responsible for other characteristics of her form. This form, while resembling her own, was actually a phantom sending.

==Abilities==
Besides her ''mithrilskin'' spell, she was known to use a phantom sending of sorts to communicate.

==Personality==
She was resigned to the loneliness of her position as a [[watchghost]] until she made friends with Elminster.

==Activities==
She dwelt in the cellars of the palace, and mostly kept to the gardens.

==History==
Before her death, Braerindra was the last member of House [[Calauth]].

In {{yearlink|241}}, Braerindra spoke briefly with [[Elminster Aumar]] on his way to meet the Coronal. They became fast friends.

She fought and was destroyed during the [[Weeping War]].
