Though deadly-looking, she was spectral and graceful. Prior to Elminsters meeting with the Coronal, she manifested as a nude shape of blue mist. Her eyes were pits of shadow that winked with silver stars. The color of her shape was the effect of her unique mithrilskin spell, and other spells were responsible for other characteristics of her form.

Before her death, Braerindra was the last member of House Calauth.
In , Braerindra spoke briefly with Elminster Aumar on his way to meet the Coronal. They became fast friends.
