Prince '''Natan''' of the [[House Tethyr|House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul]] was a [[paladin]] of [[Ilmater]] who became a saint of that faith for his heroic sacrifice.

==Relationships==
Natan was the third son of Prince [[Coram I|Coram]] of [[Tethyr]],

==History==
In the [[1050 DR|Year of the Keening Gale, 1050 DR]], the paladin-prince was traveling with his family as part of a caravan when they were all attacked by three [[wereboar]]s. Natan died saving his family, which included his newborn son Coram, and the strangers of the caravan. As his dying wish, he asked that a temple to Ilmater be built in his memory.

Within a few months, the [[Church of Ilmater]] made Prince Natan a saint, and they constructed a garrison and temple as he had requested. In addition, the site became an orphanage with a school and a monastery, being called the [[Monastery of St. Natan]].

St. Natan's body was buried in one of the corners of the courtyard of the monastery, and his spirit continued to watch over the worshipers of Ilmater there.
