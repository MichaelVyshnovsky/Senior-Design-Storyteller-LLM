'''Thorn''' was a [[lythari]] [[adventurer]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and a companion of [[Liriel Baenre]] and [[Sharlarra Vendreth]]. She was a champion of [[Eilistraee]] and a [[Moon Hunter]], able to travel along moonbeams.

==Description==
Thorn was tall and lithe and appeared much like a [[moon elf]], except for the feral light in her amber eyes. She had dark, raven-colored hair left unbound with a single streak of silver-colored hair, which was a mark of the favor of Eilistraee. She preferred to dress in all black colors, the same color as her pelt in [[wolf]] form.

==Personality==
She was feral and enjoyed eating fresh (very rare, ''i.e.'', raw) meat. She was mostly stone-faced and calm, however, but acted very straightforward and blunt and could easily be considered rude. As a lone lythari, she had no interest in manners and etiquette, and as an outcast follower of [[Sel√ªne]], she had neither patience nor mercy for her and the goddess's enemies. She also had a very high resistance to pain and torture, never compromising herself in the face of danger or agony.

She had a longing for companionship, being a loner and an outcast from her pack, and thus joined forces with Liriel Baenre in the Rashemi woods.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, Thorn followed [[Fyodor]] of [[Rashemen]] and his companion Liriel Baenre to western [[Faerun]] and back at the bequest of his grandmother, [[Zofia]], who had promised to send a Moonhunter to retrieve his body if he fell while on his quest. She helped transport Fyodor and Liriel to Rashemen and, once there, helped them defeat a band of [[drow]] led by [[Gorlist]] that was pursuing Liriel.

Thorn continued to travel with Liriel and Sharlarra Vendreth for at least ten years. In particular, she developed a bantering friendship with Sharlarra. ''Circa'' [[1371 DR]], she was with the two in [[Hlammach]], [[Impiltur]], serving as hired blades for the [[Warswords|Impilturan military]].

==Combat==
She used a [[sword]] and a [[bow]] to fight and was quite skilled. With her sword, she could easily match seasoned [[drow]] fighters one-on-one.

She also used some magic that her goddess granted her, such as transforming a ripped lock of her hair in the drow warrior Gorlist's hand into a serpent.
