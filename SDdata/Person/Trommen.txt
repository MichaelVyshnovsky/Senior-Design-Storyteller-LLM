Trommen was an ex-adventurer in Daggerford around 1370 DR.
Although extremely lazy, Trommen was an adventurer with 32 years of adventuring experience. His life included a collection of interesting experiences, including studying for five years the priesthood of the lizardfolk in Silverymoon, serving as the mayor of a tiny hamlet in the Neverwinter Wood for three years, and being imprisoned by the drow for fifteen years with two of his companions.
In 1370, with the treasures recovered from the drow, all Trommen wanted was to live in peace.
He lived in a house in the southeast section of Daggerford located along Water Street near the River Gate.
