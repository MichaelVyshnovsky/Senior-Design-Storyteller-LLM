'''Trommen''' was an ex-adventurer in [[Daggerford]] around [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Although extremely lazy, Trommen was an adventurer with 32 years of adventuring experience. His life included a collection of interesting experiences, including studying for five years the priesthood of the [[lizardfolk]] in [[Silverymoon]], serving as the mayor of a tiny hamlet in the [[Neverwinter Wood]] for three years, and being imprisoned by the [[drow]] for fifteen years with two of his companions.

In 1370, with the treasures recovered from the drow, all Trommen wanted was to live in peace.

He lived in a house in the southeast section of Daggerford located along [[Water Street]] near the [[River Gate]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
