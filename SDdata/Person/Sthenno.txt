'''Sthenno''' was a [[medusa]].The text never calls Sthenno a [[medusa]] or describes her. However, given that [[Marrec]] had snakes growing out of his hair as an infant and later developed a petrifying gaze upon puberty, he is strongly implied to have medusa ascendance. The [[blightlord]] [[Damanda]] describes him as a medusa when he reveals his powers, and Marrec himself considers the use of his power as calling upon a medusa's gaze. [[Euryale]] and Sthenno, Marrec's aunts, consider themselves to be of a specific kind with Marrec's mother, distinct from Marrec's father; [[Thanial Selwander]] claims one of Marrec's parents must've been human. Furthermore, Sthenno, Medusa, and Euryale are the names of the three [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgon gorgons] in the Greek myth of Medusa. Thus, this article concludes that Marrec's mother is a medusa, and so are her sisters.

==Relationships==
Sthenno was [[Marrec]]'s aunt. Unlike her sisters, she sometimes missed his hiding spot while playing hide and seek. Neither she nor her sister, [[Euryale]], liked when Marrec's mother brought up the memory of his father, insisting that he was too vulnerable, and not of their kin.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|91-92|11}}

==History==
Auntie Sthenno was playing hide and seek with Marrec on the night he went missing.
