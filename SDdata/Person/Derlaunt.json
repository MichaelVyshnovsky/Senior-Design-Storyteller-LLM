        "mainbody": "Derlaunt was the ruler of Gheldaneth in Mulhorand in 1357 DR.\nBeing bored, Derlaunt was trying to animate one of the many Statues-That-Walk surrounding Gheldaneth. However the ritual he had cast backfired and instead animated all the statues and Derlaunt needed to fix the problem.\nDerlaunt fought all his life to obtain the power he desired but obtained it only when he was too old to enjoy it.\nDerlaunt was a very irritable old individual. He considered himself above all people save a few Mulhorandi nobles.\nDerlaunt was the cousin of Tholaunt, the current incarnation of Thoth."
