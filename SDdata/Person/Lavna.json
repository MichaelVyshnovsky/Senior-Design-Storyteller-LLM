        "mainbody": "'''Lavna''' was one of the shepherds who tended to cattle in the [[Wild Pastures]], west of [[Liam's Hold]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Lavna was a young woman with a wide square face and clear blue eyes, color of spring [[Jasmine (plant)|jasmine]] flowers. She wore a simple handkerchief on her head.\n\nShe was a simple, friendly, and superstitious person. She often knuckled on there forehead and spat twice over her shoulder to avoid bad luck, especially when talking bout the One-Eyed Worg.",
        "History": "Lavna was present in the Wild Pastures when the cattle started mysteriously disappearing. Having witnessed the dreaded [[Old One-Eye]], a fierce and cunning [[worg]], Lavna was convinced that it was the beast who was behind the missing cattle. Lavna offered adventurers a simple but magical ''[[shepherd's charm]]'' in exchange for the worg's head."
