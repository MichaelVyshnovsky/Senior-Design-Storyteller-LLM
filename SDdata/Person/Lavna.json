        "mainbody": "Lavna was one of the shepherds who tended to cattle in the Wild Pastures, west of Liams Hold in the late 14 century DR.\nLavna was a young woman with a wide square face and clear blue eyes, color of spring jasmine flowers. She wore a simple handkerchief on her head.\nShe was a simple, friendly, and superstitious person. She often knuckled on there forehead and spat twice over her shoulder to avoid bad luck, especially when talking bout the One-Eyed Worg.\nLavna was present in the Wild Pastures when the cattle started mysteriously disappearing. Having witnessed the dreaded Old One-Eye, a fierce and cunning worg, Lavna was convinced that it was the beast who was behind the missing cattle. Lavna offered adventurers a simple but magical shepherds charm in exchange for the worgs head."
