Belym was a citizen of Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the late 15 century DR.
He had a husband named Draza.
Around the same time as the death curse, Draza was arrested for theft and sentenced to Executioners Run. This led a distraught Belym to try and persuade anyone in authority that his husband had been mistakenly convicted without a proper trial, but he was unable to convince anyone of this. Just as Draza was about to be thrown into the Run with a pair of velociraptors, Belym turned to adventurers, offering them all of his meager savings to help or protect Draza from the sidelines.
