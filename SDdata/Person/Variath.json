        "mainbody": "'''Variath''' was a powerful [[druid]] in the [[Chondalwood]] in [[1358 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Variath governed a section of Chondalwood.",
        "History": "Variath was born and raised in the Chondalwood, only venturing into the outside world once.\n\nIn 1358 DR, Variath found ten members of the [[Sailors of the Crimson Sea]] mercenary company inside his forest after they had killed a [[deer]], a terrible crime in Variath's eyes. He captured them and put them on trial.",
        "Personality": "Variath believed that all outside the Chondalwood was evil and that men were evil. He hated what he had seen in [[Faer√ªn]]. In truth, Variath was full of petty hatred and wanted to vent his ire on someone."
