'''Darhost "the Mongrel" Tharsuir''' was a [[Tashalan]] [[human]] [[fighter]] and, ''circa'' [[1373 DR]], the hereditary ruling Shoonsar of [[Ithmong (Lapaliiya)|Ithmong]], a city holy to [[Bhaelros]], in [[Lapaliiya]].

Ithmong was the second-most-powerful city of the [[Lapal League]]. In practice, the Overking of Lapaliiya needed to negotiate with Shoonsar Darhost to have decrees passed by the Grand Council.
