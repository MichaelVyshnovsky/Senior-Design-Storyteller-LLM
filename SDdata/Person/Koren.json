        "mainbody": "Koren was an elderly craftsman and the proprietor of Korens Curios, a small shop in the Priador Emporium within the Thayan enclave of Proskur during the late 14 century DR. He imported few of the items in his shop, and instead crafted most of the goods that he sold. Koren specialized in wooden and ivory crafts, especially small gifts that were meant to be exchanged by young lovers.\nBefore they joined the enclave upon its founding, Koren and his wife Chasesk ran a small business in the Thayan capital city of Eltabbar. They saw the endeavor as an opportunity to see the world beyond Thay.\nKoren once carved a small figure for a Red Wizard, who in turn transformed the item into an onyx dog. The wizard commissioned several more of these carvings, imbued them with a light magical aura and gifted them to her colleagues and friends in order to hide her own figures unique characteristics and power."
