        "mainbody": "Xax Chung was a male hare hengeyokai bushi and the hero of the city of Koje in Koryo in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nXax was found wounded in the form of a hare by a wandering shukenja, who healed him. However, the shukenja also placed a geas on Xax, commanding that he must look after and protect the people of the city of Koje until Jisziats Tower, a prominent local landmark, was \"cast to the ground\". Xax could not be free until this came about.\nIn the course of this duty, Xax saved Koje from a giant dragon turtle and slew the tengu Kwiasp. For his efforts, he was feted as the \"hero of Koje\". He was also said to have \"tamed\" the witch Zartalla, whom he later married.\nBy 1357 DR, Xax and Zartalla had settled down and raised a family, but his geas remained unfulfilled.\nFinally, many years later, when Xax was an old man, Koje was assaulted by a dragon, who tore down Jisziats Tower. Xax battled the dragon, and died defending his adopted city. Revealed to be a hare hengeyokai at the end, he remained known as the hero of Koje.\nIn the fulfillment of his geas, Xax had to maintain the pretense of being a human to the people of Koje, though he would prefer to get away into the woods to be with other hengeyokai. He never ate meat, a habit that was noticed but not questioned. Few suspected the truth until his death.\nIn human form, Xax was of medium build and had wide brown eyes as befitted a hare. He typically wore around his neck a brass chain bearing the symbol of the god of the warren, but its meaning was unknown or obscure to those who saw it.\nXax had reflexes that were lighting fast, lending him great skill at arms.\nXax was married to Zartalla, and they had children.\nXax dwelled at a large cattle ranch about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) north of Koje, together with his family and servants."
