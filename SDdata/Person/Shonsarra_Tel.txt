'''Shonsarra Tel''' was a mage hailing from [[Oslin]] in [[Chessenta]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

She was acquainted with [[Elminster]], the Sage of [[Shadowdale]], and with [[Thorongh Davarragar]], a notorious adventurer in [[Delzimmer]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]], who presented himself as a northern dragon-slaying barbarian hero. However, Shonsarra said to Elminster that Thorongh had probably never even seen snow or a [[dragon]].
