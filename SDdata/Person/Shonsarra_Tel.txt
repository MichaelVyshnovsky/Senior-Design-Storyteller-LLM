Shonsarra Tel was a mage hailing from Oslin in Chessenta in the midâ€“14 century DR.
She was acquainted with Elminster, the Sage of Shadowdale, and with Thorongh Davarragar, a notorious adventurer in Delzimmer circa 1372 DR, who presented himself as a northern dragon-slaying barbarian hero. However, Shonsarra said to Elminster that Thorongh had probably never even seen snow or a dragon.
