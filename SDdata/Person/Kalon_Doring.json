        "Rumors and Legends": "It was widely rumored that the gods drove Kalon mad because he dared to challenge the might of the Celestial Emperor. With an army numbering 10,000, Kalon marched onto a frozen glacier searching for the Emperor's forces. Kalon and his army were never seen again, though many claimed they haunted the glacier which was later named the [[Glacier of the Lost King]]."
