'''Lunapine''' was a languid-seeming [[moon dog]] of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Lunapine was the closest companion of [[Naneatha Suaril]], the high priestess of [[Sel√ªne]] at the [[House of the Moon]] temple in [[Waterdeep]] around [[1370 DR]]. A regular guest of hers, Lunapine stayed in the antechamber outside her quarters.
