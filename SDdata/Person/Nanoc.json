        "mainbody": "Nanoc, also known as Nanoc the Barbarian, was a novice adventurer and warrior.\nThe barbarian was proud and arrogant. He prided himself on being raised in the North, and stated that he was immune to the pathetic civilized way of men.\nThe adventurer owned a standard set of hide armor and a greatsword.\nNanoc first lived in the harsh lands of the North.\nHe met his fellow adventurers, Bondari and Tim Goldenhand in a tavern. The group foolishly decided to enter a cavern to the Underdark, and they encountered the mad wizard Iycanths creations. The creatures quickly petrified the trio, turning them to stone."
