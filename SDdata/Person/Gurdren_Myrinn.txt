'''Gurdren Myrinn''' was a female [[keening spirit]] and a [[divine champion]] of [[Kiaransalee]]. She resided in [[V'elddrinnsshar]] in the [[Vault of Gnashing Teeth]] alongside [[Larynda Telenna]].

==Description==
Insubstantial and ghostly, Gurdren Myrinn wore heavy armor forged with the likeness of [[demon]]ic features. In her hands she clasped a serrated [[greatsword]].

==Abilities==
As a keening spirit, Gurdren could release a baleful wail that afflicted creatures much like the ''[[wail of the banshee]]'' spell. Furthermore, she could rejuvenate from most defeats unless certain conditions were met.

Since she had dedicated herself to Kiaransalee as a divine champion, Gurdren Myrinn trained extensively with the [[dagger]] (despite her seeming preference for the greatsword), which was the favored weapon of her deity. In addition, she could heal wounds with her touch, if she so wished.

==Possessions==
Gurdren customarily wore a set of ''[[demon armor]]'' and carried a greatsword with a serrated edge.

==Relationships==
Her high status in the [[church of Kiaransalee]] meant that she was venerated in some shrines by devotees, such as the [[divine seeker]] [[Paelinn]].

==History==
At some point in [[1372 DR]], Gurdren died and rose again as an [[undead]] spirit known as a keening spirit. During the [[Silence of Lolth]] in 1372 DR, she was based in the Vault of Gnashing Teeth, where she held a prominent position in the church of Kiaransalee.
