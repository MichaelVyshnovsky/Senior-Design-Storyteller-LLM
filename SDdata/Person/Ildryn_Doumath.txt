'''Ildryn Doumath''' was the head of [[Doumath]] mercantile house, as well as their representative on the [[Merchants Council]], in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was quite an ambitious [[half-elf]], having worked his way from a skilled woodcarver to head of a Ravnenian merchant house. 

Despite his achievements, Ildryn preferred his time practicing his craft over the seemingly ceaseless talking and dawdling found in council meetings.

==History==
Ildryn became the patriarch of House Doumath after the death of [[Emryn Bentbow]], having purchased the deceased councilman's business and thereby inheriting his seat. He often tried to end meetings early, interrupting his contemporaries with snappy, sarcastic comments in an attempt to move things along.
