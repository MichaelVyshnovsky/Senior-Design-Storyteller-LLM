'''Murith Garas''' was a member of the [[Red Wizards]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who oversaw the sale and export of [[arcane]] wares in the city of [[Proskur]].

Murith was the third-most senior Red Wizard within the city's [[Thayan enclave (Proskur)|enclave]]. He headed the [[Stronghouse]], a large complex that housed a number of shops that provided a variety of magical goods and services. He was also personally responsible for the security of the Stronghouse's secret vault, which housed an inventory of a great many exotic and dangerous arcane items held by the Red Wizards of Proskur. As of the late 14{{th}} century, the total value of the cache was estimated to be well over 100,000 [[gp]].

==Relationships==
Among Murith's subordinates were [[Tarithi]], the apothecary and mid-level bureaucrat of the [[Guild of Foreign Trade]]; the [[potion]]-and[[scroll]] merchant, [[Thazal Tabar]]; a Red Wizard tattooist named [[Urhun Kren]]; the eccentric alchemist [[Kethin Zurn]]; and [[Ramshan Doon]] of the [[Arcane Gallery]], among others.

Like all the Red Wizards within Proskur, Murith answered to the [[khazark]] of the enclave, [[Chathin Zurn]].
