'''Chock''' was an [[ogre]] mercenary who worked on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Ogre kill everyone around! Then ogre eats them!|Chock.}}

==Description==
The mighty ogre wore a crude loincloth, hide-wrapped bracers, a simple necklace, and makeshift eyepatch.

==Abilities==
Chock traveled alongside [[Fank]], and their magnificent leader, [[Lump (ogre)|Lump the Enlightened]]. They often debated as to whether other creatures they encountered should be classified as friends or food, and argued about what animals that 'food' may taste like.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Chock and his allies were hired by the [[goblin]] [[Cult of the Absolute|cultists]] of the [[Absolute]]. The trio were directed to remain in the ruins of [[Moonhaven]], to check passersby for anyone bearing the ''mark of the Absolute''. They were given gold by the goblins, along with executive decision making as which individuals could or could not be eaten.
