He was famous for his ability at crafting constructs.\nOldo Tappard was tall, old, and gaunt long before becoming Magister.\nOldo was a toymaker whose fondness for children was well-known.\nEven before becoming Magister, Oldo had become a creator of golems. After becoming Magister, he soon developed the ability to act, speak, and even cast spells through his creations.\nOldo Tappard was known to own a workshop, even before becoming Magister.\nOldo had never stopped making toys for children as a Magister. He also dropped spell scrolls as gifts for wizards who were parents.\nOriginally a maker of animated toys and golems, Oldo accepted the office of Magister, tempted by the possibility of incredible power overnight. After his ascension, he crafted a new spell to act through them, and sent one of his \"bodies\" to a temple of Mystra, where he claimed to be using such golems as his body. He then sent such bodies around Faerûn whenever a mage destroyed one, Oldo sent one of his bodies afterwards to ambush them at their weakest, claiming to be \"hunting the evil Magister\".\nHe died to a wasting disease in , after sending his creations to remove the doors from several magical schools, so that \"all could enter in, and learn.\" His own constructs revealed his secrets through a scroll in Candlekeep. Though many mages were interested in his spells, and sought to glean them from his constructs, all the animated bodies disappeared through the tenday after his death.\nOldo had spread the rumor, soon after becoming Magister, that after a magical mishap, he encased his body in a construct of his own making to explore through the Realms. It was also said that the magical bodies through which he acted disappeared due to the will of Mystra or the actions of her servants."
