        "mainbody": "Tarthane was one of the bandits under the Iron Fox in the midâ€“8 century DR.\nThe men of the Iron Fox wore light armor and brought no lances or horses.\nWhen Elminster Aumar, a Chosen of Mystra, carried out a scouring of the bandits in Buckralams Starn, Tarthane remained with his boss, the Iron Fox, until moments before his death at Fox Tower. They were attacked at the mess hall, where Elminster ambushed them using one or more crossbows from a gallery overlooking them Tarthane then dashed up the gallery on the boss orders, together with fellow renegade Llander.\nAt the top of the stair, Elminster dropped a tapestry on Llander, and then pulled the rug underneath Tarthane, gaining a few precious moments he used to stab the man in the eye."
