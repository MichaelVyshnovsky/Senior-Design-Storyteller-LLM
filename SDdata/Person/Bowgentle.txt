Bowgentle of Silverymoon was a legendary wizard.
Bowgentle was noted for his calm demeanour, politeness and generosity, but also for his reckless adventuring.
Bowgentle spent much of his life venturing into dangerous places in search of hoarded magic. Upon escaping with his spoils, he would then share what hed found in cities. He cast spells for the benefit of others, making him a much-loved hero of the people.
Bowgentle was born on Nightal 30 1034 DR. His father was a fisherman in Silverymoon. At the age of six, Bowgentle began his study of magic under Quintas Uhlawm. By the age of nineteen, Bowgentle had attracted the personal attention of Silverymoons High Mage Orjalun, who took him on as a student for a time. Four years later, Bowgentle left his home city and began a grand career in wizardry up and down the Sword Coast and Savage Frontier, rivalled by few. 
Some highlights of his storied career were when he slew Raurgoch the black dragon with magic pilfered from the wyrms own treasure hoard his unsealing and plundering of the well-guarded tomb of the Wizard-King when he teased a red dragon by matching its flame breath with his own fire magic before going on to defeat it and when he helped found the Abbey of St. Alaric after Alaric himself saved Bowgentles life.
