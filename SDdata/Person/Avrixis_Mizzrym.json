        "mainbody": "Avrixis Mizzrym was a drow ranger member of House Mizzrym who sought to fulfill her ambitions in the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nAvrixis was an ambitious and highly skilled woman with smarts, making her an expert negotiator.\nAvrixis was born into the drow House Mizzrym of Menzoberranzan. She honed her skills and became a trusted agent of the matron mother, negotiating on the Houses behalf and wielding cold steel when words were not enough. Sometime in the 1490s, DR, when she was four hundred thirty-six winders old, Avrixis was sent to the city of Baldurs Gate by the matrons mother to forge alliances with certain nobles and fat merchants. However, Avrixis developed a twisted appreciation of the surface world unbeknownst to the matron mother. She became consumed by the flames of ambition, seeing how many soft and gullible people were there, ripe for ruling. Avrixis sought to dominate the surface world and become a \"matron mother\" in her own right. She thought that groveling under the house mothers heel was no compassion to becoming the Dark Queen of Baldurs Gate. This ambition led Avrixis to face adventures and misadventures in Baldurs Gate alongside other enthusiastic individuals."
