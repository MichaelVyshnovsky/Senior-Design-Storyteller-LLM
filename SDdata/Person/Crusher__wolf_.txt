Crusher was one of the two pet wolfs of the bandit leader Bonegnasher from Shadowdale, active in the mid-14 century DR.
Crusher was a slightly smaller wolf than its fellow Predator, about  tall. They both had grey fur.
Both wolves, Predator and Crusher were virtually inseparable from their master. They lived in his room located on the sub-level of the Tomb of Damara, just outside of the ogres treasure storage.
During the time Bonegnasher occupied the ruins of the Damaras Castle, his pets served as his loyal guards. When a group of adventurers from Freedale confronted the bandits and slavers of the castle, both wolves and their owner died in a battle against them.
