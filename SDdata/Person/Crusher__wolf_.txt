'''Crusher''' was one of the two pet [[wolf]]s of the bandit leader [[Bonegnasher]] from [[Shadowdale]], active in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Crusher was a slightly smaller wolf than its fellow [[Predator (wolf)|Predator]], about {{SI|3'|'"|long=yes}} tall. They both had grey fur.

==Relationships==
Both wolves, Predator and Crusher were virtually inseparable from their master. They lived in his room located on the sub-level of the [[Tomb of Damara]], just outside of the ogre's treasure storage.

==History==
During the time Bonegnasher occupied the ruins of the Damara's Castle, his pets served as his loyal guards. When a group of adventurers from [[Freedale]] confronted the bandits and slavers of the castle, both wolves and their owner died in a battle against them.
