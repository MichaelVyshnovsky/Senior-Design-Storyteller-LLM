Aswansea was a moon elf priest of Tyr inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Aswansea was a member of the Daggerford militia and led patrols through the countryside. 
She originally wanted to be a ranger, but always fell behind her peers during hikes. Her parents were among the moon elves who resided at Floshin Estates.
She was close friends with Maelwyn. Aswansea was in a tentative relationship with Cork, but ultimately did not want to marry him because he was a "short-lived" human.
