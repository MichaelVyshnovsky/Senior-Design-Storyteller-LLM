        "mainbody": "homren was a druid of Thorngap in the late 15 century DR.\nSometime around the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon, Thomren lived as a druid at the circle of Thorngap. Unfortunately, the respected druid Halsaime became corrupted by the powers of the strange staff that he received from Oriphaun Huntsilver, becoming a destructive and malevolent force of nature. Thomren was one of the druids that joined his cause, either of his own accord or the powerful will that Halsaime exerted, and guarded Thorn Hollow with the local dire bears until overcome by Harper agents sent from Eveningstar by Kirinel Zay."
