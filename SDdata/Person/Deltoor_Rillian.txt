Deltoor Rillian was a druid of Chauntea in the Spiderhaunt Wood around the year 1369 DR.
Deltoor taught a group of young initiates about proper maintenance of the trees near the trail and how to make their way out of the forest during the night. He was always ready to give useful advice about forest conservation.
