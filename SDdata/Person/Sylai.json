        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Sylai had already moved away from home and only occasionally visited Old Jol, communicating via letters. When the [[Absolute crisis]] struck the Gate, Sylai heard about upcoming food shortages and sent season's victuals to their father, knowing how he hated shopping for himself. Sylai promised to visit as soon as they could."
