        "mainbody": "Eldovar Fleetleaf was an elven guide who traveled the Storm Horns in the late 15 century DR.\nEldovar had light skin and long black hair. He wore rugged and practical clothing and carried a walking stick as he traversed the wilderness.\nHe had a rather poor opinion of adventurers, and prided himself on his specialized wilderness knowledge and professionalism.\nAround the mid-1480s DR, Eldovar offered his services as a guide to people in the Storm Horns, but strongly preferred people who had proven themselves competent already. He was willing to take completely clueless people, but it required a significant payment for his time and effort."
