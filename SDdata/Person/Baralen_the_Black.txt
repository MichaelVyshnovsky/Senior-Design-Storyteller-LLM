Baralen the Black was an infamous pirate who once kidnapped the daughter of Lord Tygarian.
Sometime before 1372 DR, Baralen managed to capture and hold hostage Lord Tygarians daughter. The pirates ransom was paid with a set of enchanted light armor, Fencers Grace. However, Baralen refused to release his prisoner anyway. When Lord Tygarians daughter found out, she flew into blind rage and killed her kidnapper with a single strike. She took the ransom armor and used it to become a pirate herself.
