He had been called forth at some point prior to 1479 DR.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|96-97|9}}\n\nAfter testing the command to return to the item in the [[Dragonskull Chamber]] at [[Obarskyr Castle]], Marlin commanded him and fellow blueflame ghost Treth Halonter go find and kill [[Seszgar Huntcrown]] in [[Suzail]]. In executing the command, the two went on a rampage. Every time they met someone on the streets, Relve asked if they'd seen Seszgar Huntcrown, with Treth adding immediately if they'd seen him recently. The duo killed anyone who didn't know where he was. Their rampage ended when they came across [[Belgryn Murenstur]]; they intimidated the man into leading them to [[the Bold Archer]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|228-230|21}}\n\nAfter slaying the Huntcrown heir, the two took his corpse to Marlin Stormserpent at [[Stormserpent Towers]]; he called on them to throw it in the furnace.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|245-247|23}} They were called on afterwards to kill [[Jharakphred]], an artist for hire, after the later painted for Marlin the likenesses of [[Draskos Crownsilver]] and [[Gariskar Dauntinghorn]], who were to be the ghosts' next target.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|259-260|25}} Later, a frightened Marlin used the ghosts to watch over him in his sleep.\n\nOn the evening after the disastrous [[Council of the Dragon]], Treth Halonter and Relve Langral were sent into the palace as part of another plan, this time hatched by Marlin Stormserpent and [[Traevyn Illance]] both, in which Marlin would make himself out to be the one who stopped those ghosts.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|141-142|15}} Along the way, however, they were spotted by one of the [[Lords of Waterdeep]], [[Mirt]], by the understeward [[Corleth Fentable]], by the evil [[archmage]] [[vampire]] [[Manshoon]], who was riding on Corleth Fentable's mind at the moment,{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|159|17}} and finally by the renegade wizard [[Elminster Aumar]]. The ghosts were attacked before reaching the palace.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|160-161|17}}\n\nRelve Langral was almost destroyed by one of Elminster's spells, and fled,{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|188-190|20}} His next use of the ghosts was to try and capture him some breakfast in the wilderness after he fled Suzail; unfortunately for him, the only creature they were able to kill was a [[bear]], as everything else fled the unnatural entities.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|239|25}}\n\nThe ''Flying Blade'' was seized by [[Cymmarra]] after she slew Marlin Stormserpent; she was building her own collection of those ghosts,{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|266|28}} which she mobilized towards the [[Bold Blazon]] at the [[Festival of Handras]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|321|34}} She later pursued Elminster into a secret cave after he retrieved the belt buckle of Lord [[Calantar (Lord)]], secretly a ''blueflame item'', wielding her retinue of ghosts against him there. She stopped using the blueflame items after [[The Simbul]], restored by the belt buckle, slew her.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|329-335|35}}"
