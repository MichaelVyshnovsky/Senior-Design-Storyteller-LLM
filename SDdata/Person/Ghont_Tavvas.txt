'''Ghont Tavvas''' was one of the [[Boar's Head]]s of the [[Order of the Blue Boar]], a mercenary recruitment organization in [[Amn]].

==Description==
Lord Tavvas was a distinguished man who was rarely seen out of his blue uniform. In [[1358 DR]], he was the oldest member of the Boar's Heads, being nearly 90 years old. His mind was still sharp, even at that age, and he was proud.

==Activities==
Ghont was a leading member of the Order of the Blue Boar who offered strategic advice. In his younger days, he was a great warrior and led infantry companies into battle. As an older man, he hired others to lead his troops.

==History==
Ghont was distantly related to some of the members of the [[Lions' Dynasty]]'of [[Tethyr]], but he kept this matter a secret, because he was exiled from that kingdom at the end of the 12{{th}} century [[DR]] for being involved in a brief succession war.
