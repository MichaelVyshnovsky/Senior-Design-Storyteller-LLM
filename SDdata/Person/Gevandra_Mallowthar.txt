'''Gevandra Mallowthar''', lovingly nicknamed '''the Evening Rose''', was the first [[Lady of Graces]] in service of the Court of King [[Foril Obarskyr I]] of [[Cormyr]] in the early-to-mid–15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Gevandra was a stunningly beautiful woman with dark blue eyes and hair. Her uncanny hair color was natural and by many accords, was the result of her [[half-elven]] bloodline. These features earned her the Evening Rose moniker.

==Possessions==
As a lady of the Court, Gevandra resided within a suite in the [[Court of Cormyr]]. Her quarters were in the western end of the Royal Court, along with the receiving room, connected to the suites via a circular staircase. The receiving room was named Font of Grace, while the chambers were later named after Gevandra Mallowthar—the Rose Rooms.

==History==
Gevandra Mallowthar left her office in the {{YearlinkName|1459}}, and was succeeded by [[Brunzarra Hethcanter]], the second Lady of Graces of Cormyr.
