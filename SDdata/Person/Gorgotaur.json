He claimed to be a child of the demon lord Baphomet.[http//forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=9189 According to author Eric L. Boyd], the article in Dragon #355 originally included a stat block for the Gorgotaur, but this was cut prior to publication. Notably, the Gorgotaurs other tauric half was supposed to be minotaur, and his alignment was supposed to be chaotic evil.\nHe was a notably ruthless leader who pushed his cultists past the brink of exhaustion.\nUnder the Gorgotaurs leadership, the Cult of the Labyrinth launched numerous raids on drow and duergar merchants traveling between Menzoberranzan and Gracklstugh."
