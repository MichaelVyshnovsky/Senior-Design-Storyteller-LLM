Loregrim Thandaron was an elderly, yet powerful human druid of Silvanus who lived in the Misty Forest around the 14 century DR.
There were a variety of rangers in the Misty Forest that Loregrim habitually worked alongside. He also had two young, novice druids under his wing that acted as assistants.
Prior to settling down in the Misty Forest, Loregrim had been a citizen of the city of Neverwinter.
