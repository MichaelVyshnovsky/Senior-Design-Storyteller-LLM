'''Ri'ola'con''' was the 22nd [[eadar]] of the nation of [[As'arem]] beneath the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], and a member of the [[Nantarn Council]].

==Description==
He had grey skin, but with a white mark on his forehead and white stripes on his dorsal fin, which marked him as a member of the shalarin [[Shalarin#Culture|Rulers' caste]].

Ri'ola'con was old and sickly as of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, at which time he was 241 years old and had been in power for 125 years. He was gaunt and frail, with deep wrinkles and a drooping dorsal fin.

==Personality==
Despite his great age and poor health, his mind remained sharp and clear. On the Nantarn Council, he acted as a mediator and facilitator.

==Activities==
Ri'ola'con was the unseen ceremonial emperor of the four [[shalarin]] kingdoms which comprised As'arem, as well as the shalarin representative on the Council. He was not the leader of the council, but as the ruler of As'arem, he was the highest-ranking leader.

==Relationships==
The decision to tie As'arem close to the Nantarn Council was unpopular among the four kings of the shalarin with whom Ri'ola'con shared his power. This led some to plot against him.

Following the death of his heir, [[Ri'ola'sur]], during the [[Twelfth Serôs War]], Ri'ola'con declared [[Ri'ola'kirk]] to be his new heir.

To the surprise of many, especially shalarin, Ri'ola'con forged a friendship with [[Gayar]].

==History==
Ri'ola'con became eadar in the {{YearlinkName|1245}}.

After the Twelfth Serôs War in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, he decided to reside in Myth Nantar, causing tumult and plotting. He however wanted to fully support the [[Nantarn Alliance]].

Ri'ola'con was poisoned on [[Greengrass]] of [[1370 DR]] while in his palace at [[Us'roch]].<ref group="note" name="ROAdeath">While the ''[[Sea of Fallen Stars (sourcebook)|Sea of Fallen Stars]]'' sourcebook (p. 75) states that Ri'ola'con was assassinated in [[1370 DR]], the novel ''[[Queen of the Depths]]'' features Ri'ola'con alive and still serving in his capacity as eadar as of [[1373 DR]].
