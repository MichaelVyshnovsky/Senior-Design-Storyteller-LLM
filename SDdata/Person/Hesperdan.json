        "mainbody": "Hesperdan was an archmage in the Zhentarim. Secretly the black dragon Alorglauvenemaus, he also went by the alias Gelvar Thordrunn, a dealer of magical curios and esoterica in Ordulin, Sembia.\nHe was keen-witted, and had a sense of humor.\nAlorglauvenemaus had early gained Elminster Aumar as an ally, and he mind-melded with the old mage sometimes, allowing them to speak out of each others mouths and see from each others eyes, allowing Elminster to be an insider at the Zhentarim, in which the dragon later took up a role. They even impersonated each other from time to time.\nOther mages of the Zhentarim had varying views of him Drauthtar Inskirl claimed to hate him, Eirhaun Sooundaeril claimed no one knew enough to hate him others of middling rank such as Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle believed him to be an unpredictable and potentially dangerous excentric, tolerated only because of his apparent lack of interest in becoming an obstacle to anyones schemes, and his incredibly extensive general knowledge.\nIn particular, Hesperdan had a number of scrying orbs, some of which hed crafted himself.\nHaving shared memories with Elminster, Hesperdan could be easily assumed to rank among the most powerful mages anywhere in Faer√ªn. He could craft a variety of scrying orb. He was known to have \"expensive vices\".\nWhile a member of the Zhentarim, many of his intrigues revolved around the Citadel of the Raven and the magelings therein. Mostly he kept to intrigues, rather than being overt in his activities, making backroom deals.\nIn the , at the age of 43, Alorglauvenemaus was rising in power among dragons, yet faring badly against greater wyrms. Disillusioned by the paranoia, territoriality, and greed of other dragons, he met with Elminster Aumar and accepted some overtures to study the arcane together. They also began mind-melds that year Alorglauvenemaus had the intention of taking on human shape, and so actualize his true love of intrigues and wizardry.\nHesperdan, in the guise of Gelvar Thordrunn, took on Malathar Wingstarl (later known as Sememmon) as an apprentice, teaching him wizardry. Gelvar disappeared, believed lost at sea, two years after taking on Malathar, some time between 1234 DR and 1258 DR.Malathar was born in 1234 DR and moved to Zhentil Keep in 1258 DR so Gelvars \"death\" must be somewhere between these dates.\nHesperdan was among the earliest members of the Zhentarim. While one, Hesperdan schemed to bring Fzoul Chembryl to power in the Black Network, thus allowing him to use Manshoon for his own purposes. He did much behind the scenes to foster the rise of his student Semmemmon in the Zhentarim ranks and indirectly sought to mould him to be a foil for Manshoon.\nIn the , Hesperdan met with a former Zhentarim mage, Arlonder Darmeth \"Old Ghost\" in a well-hidden room of the Citadel of the Raven, inquisitive about the phantoms intentions after its actions regarding Horaundoon. Though Hesperdan was ambushed, with four portals in the room opening to four different mages, each armed with a wand, none of their spells did anything to him. Old Ghost also attempted to strike Hesperdan, finding himself damaged instead. Besides inquiring as to his actions regarding Hilmryn, a Red Wizard, and its further intentions regarding Horaundoon, Hesperdan also bade him not interfere with the Knights of Myth Drannor.\nIn the , Hesperdan got involved tangentially during the last of the hunt for the spellfire wielder Shandril Shessair, during the period after Flamerule 21. While berserk and displaying numerous unlikely powers due to a strange spellfire overload or meltdown, Shandril somehow learned of him and demanded to be shown Hesperdan Alustriel, who was present and trying to contain her fury, did so, creating a gate-like window towards him. The wizard quickly closed Alustriels gate, but not before Shandril sent forth a torrent of spellfire across space. The spellfire emerged at the hideout of his rival mage Eirhaun Sooundaeril, tearing the place apart in Hesperdans wake. Eirhaun vowed a vengeance against his rival.\nShortly after Flamerule 28, Hesperdan healed Eirhaun Sooundaeril, who had been found by his apprentices after he attempted to snatch Narm Tamaraith after trying to verify Shandrils death, only to find himself thwarted by the Seven Sisters and burned nearly to death. Eirhaun Sooundaeril took note of the stink of pipesmoke around the sardonic Hesperdan.\nDuring Cyrics ascendance, a deal between Hesperdan and the Pereghost made it so that anyone who gave in to violence at Darkhold would be teleported high over a distant peak, then left to fall, so that Darkhold would not fall into chaos.\nDuring the time prior to the Spellplague of , Hesperdan met with Khelben Arunsun, \"Blackstaff\" a number of times, some of them in disguises Khelben did not see through.\nHe died in  inside his lair in Hullack Forest, executed by Elminster upon the restoration of Mystra."
