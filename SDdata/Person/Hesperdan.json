        "Relationships": "Alorglauvenemaus had early gained [[Elminster Aumar]] as an ally, and he mind-melded with the old mage sometimes, allowing them to speak out of each other's mouths and see from each other's eyes, allowing Elminster to be an insider at the [[Zhentarim]], in which the dragon later took up a role. They even impersonated each other from time to time.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-02-12 - Hesperdan and Elminster's Mind-Melds}}{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/04-04 - Fzoul's Enemies}}\n\nOther mages of the Zhentarim had varying views of him: [[Drauthtar Inskirl]] claimed to hate him, [[Eirhaun Sooundaeril]] claimed no one knew enough to hate him;{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|219-221|13}} others of middling rank such as [[Hlael Toraunt]] and [[Korthauvar Hammantle]] believed him to be an unpredictable and potentially dangerous excentric, tolerated only because of his apparent lack of interest in becoming an obstacle to anyone's schemes,{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|132|8}} and his incredibly extensive general knowledge.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|77|5}}",

        "History": {
            "Early Life": "In the {{yearlinkName|1106}}, at the age of 43, Alorglauvenemaus was rising in power among dragons, yet faring badly against greater wyrms. Disillusioned by the paranoia, territoriality, and greed of other dragons, he met with [[Elminster Aumar]] and accepted some overtures to study the arcane together. They also began mind-melds that year; Alorglauvenemaus had the intention of taking on human shape, and so actualize his true love of intrigues and wizardry.\n\nHesperdan, in the guise of Gelvar Thordrunn, took on Malathar Wingstarl (later known as [[Sememmon]]) as an apprentice, teaching him wizardry. Gelvar disappeared, believed lost at sea, two years after taking on Malathar, some time between 1234 DR and 1258 DR.Malathar was born in 1234 DR and moved to Zhentil Keep in 1258 DR so Gelvar's \"death\" must be somewhere between these dates.",
            "As a Zhentarim": "Hesperdan was among the earliest members of the Zhentarim.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/10-25 - Early Zhentarim}} While one, Hesperdan schemed to bring [[Fzoul Chembryl]] to power in the Black Network, thus allowing him to use [[Manshoon]] for his own purposes. He did much behind the scenes to foster the rise of his student Semmemmon in the Zhentarim ranks and indirectly sought to mould him to be a foil for Manshoon.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1348}}, Hesperdan met with a former Zhentarim mage, [[Arlonder Darmeth]] \"Old Ghost\" in a well-hidden room of the Citadel of the Raven, inquisitive about the phantom's intentions after its actions regarding [[Horaundoon]]. Though Hesperdan was ambushed, with four portals in the room opening to four different mages, each armed with a [[wand]], none of their spells did anything to him. Old Ghost also attempted to strike Hesperdan, finding himself damaged instead. Besides inquiring as to his actions regarding [[Hilmryn]], a [[Red Wizard]], and its further intentions regarding Horaundoon, Hesperdan also bade him not interfere with the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]].{{cite book/Swords of Dragonfire/MMP|1-7|Prologue}}",
            "After the Spellplague": "He died in {{yearlinkName|1479}} inside his lair in [[Hullack Forest]], executed by Elminster upon the restoration of [[Mystra]]."
