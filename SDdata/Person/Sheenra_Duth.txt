'''Sheenra Duth''' was a [[Harper]] active around [[1367 DR]].

==Personality==
Sheenra loved her life and always had a contagious smile on her face. She was able to remember thousands of minute details during her normal walk.

==History==
Sheenra was born in [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]] and lived a normal childhood until her family was caught in a business intrigue; a rival of her father ended up killing her parents and taking Sheenra as a slave. Luckily, she managed to escape and in revenge robbed the man's shop and burned his home.

Sheenra later left Amn with no objective in mind but during the journey was intrigued by a traveling minstrel and followed him. Thanks to this man, a Harper agent, Sheenra arrived at the [[Twilight Hall]] in [[Berdusk]], where she blossomed into an able Harper thief and musician. She volunteered for every mission, whether difficult, dangerous, or delicate, until [[Cylyria Dragonbreast]] assigned an easy one to Sheenra: she had to infiltrate a caravan with two fellow Harpers in order to deliver a message. Instead, Sheenra seduced the caravan merchant and stole from him a document. It was found that the man was a [[Zhentarim]] agent and Sheenra had stolen a list of [[Zhent]] agents.
