Jono Branton was a human priest of Amaunator in Eveningstar during the late 15 century DR.
Jono had pale skin, gray eyes, and black hair tied in two braids.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the mid-1480s DR, Jono and Delethir Mistveil attended the injured Purple Dragons who needed treatment at the Eveningstar War Hospital, under the guidance of Hurim Jaskyr. Unfortunately, the patients were victims of werewolf bites, making the situation far worse.
