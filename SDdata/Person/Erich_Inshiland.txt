Erich Inshiland was the Grand Mairshar of Tasseldale in early 15 century DR. He followed the reign of Elizzaria Whitehand, having been groomed by her at an early age as she prepared to step down. 
In 1420 DR, Grand Mairshar Inshiland led the dale in battle to resist the invasion of Sembian mercenaries from Yhaunn. Their forces lost unfortunately, and the dale fell under the rule of Sembia.
During his youth, Erich was known for having a cheerful disposition,  which grew into a charismatic personality as leader of Tasseldale.
