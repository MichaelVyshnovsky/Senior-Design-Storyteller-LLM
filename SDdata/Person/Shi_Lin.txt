Shi Lin was a wu jen in the town of Hsin-to in Tu Lung in 1358 DR.
In 1358 DR, she became one of the three wu jen bought under the control of Dragon Claw. She was a leader of Dragon Claw followers in the city and led her minions to fight the wu jen Ko La Ko and an adventuring party hired by Ko Ho San at the tomb of Poh Nih. The adventurers however killed all her minions and so Shi Lin buried the adventurers inside the tomb with her magic.
Shi Lin was made highly unstable and vicious by the use of cursed Dragon Claw swords and their inherent conflict with her use of magic.
