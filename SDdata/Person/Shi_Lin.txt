'''Shi Lin''' was a [[wu jen]] in the town of [[H'sin-to]] in [[T'u Lung]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
In 1358 DR, she became one of the three wu jen bought under the control of [[Dragon Claw]]. She was a leader of Dragon Claw followers in the city and led her minions to fight the [[wu jen]] [[Ko La Ko]] and an adventuring party hired by [[Ko Ho San]] at the tomb of [[Poh Nih]]. The adventurers however killed all her minions and so Shi Lin buried the adventurers inside the tomb with her magic.

==Personality==
Shi Lin was made highly unstable and vicious by the use of cursed Dragon Claw swords and their inherent conflict with her use of magic.
