Thessaloni Canos was the tharchion of the island tharch of Aloar in Thay.
Thessaloni was a tall woman even by Mulan standards. She was quite handsome with a pleasant face, hooded green eyes, and weather-beaten skin. She usually wore scale armor and ornaments of coral, pearl, and scrimshaw. Her skin was also tattooed in an aquatic motif. Her favorite weapon was the trident.
Thessaloni was considered one of the most capable commanders in Thay.
In 1385 DR, during the war of the zulkirs, Thessaloni and her men fled to the Wizards Reach and secured both Escalant and Laothkund for the council of zulkirs.
