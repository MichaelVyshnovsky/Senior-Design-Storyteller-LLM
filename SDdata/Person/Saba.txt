Prince Saba was the legitimate ruler of the city of Hafayah within the Free Cities of Zakhara in .
Since Prince Saba was only eight years old in 1367 DR, Most Holy Regent Uqban ruled until he came of age. Saba became the only surviving heir when the previous Sultan was poisoned when he was only five years old. The ensuing coup resulted in the deaths of all of his older brothers and sisters.
Saba did not desire the throne. Instead he wanted to roam the lands as a desert rider, aiding others with their troubles and becoming a hero. This greatly troubled his advisors who hoped to dissuade these fantastic notions in the eight years they had remaining efore Saba claimed the throne.
