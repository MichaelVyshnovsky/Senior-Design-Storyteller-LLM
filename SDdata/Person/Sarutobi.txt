Sarutobi was a renowned martial artist from the land of Shou Lung, who lived long before the late 13 century DR.
Sarutobi was already a famed fighter by the time he was challenged to a duel by a rock giant. To aid the martial artist, a wealthy Shou merchant commissioned the creation of enchanted bracers, later to be known as Sarutobis Stone Breakers. According to the story, Sarutobi passionately declined the gift, claiming that he needed no help in crushing the giants skull. The martial artist survived the duel only to one day step through a planar gate and disappear, leaving a son behind. The merchant gifted the magic gauntlets to Sarutobis son, who later went on a life-long quest to find his missing father. He never did.
