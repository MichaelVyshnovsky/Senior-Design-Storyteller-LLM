'''Oraundas Haeltower''' was a vintner from the land of [[Tethyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/407/Eye on the Realms: A Surprising Vintage}}

==Activities==
Oraundas was best known for producing drinkable but rather unexceptional table [[wine]]s sold throughout the [[Sword Coast]]. His wines kept well and were a favorite among innkeepers and shopkeepers. His vast vineyards lay northeast of [[Vineshade]] in the [[Purple Hills]] region of Tethyr. Although Haeltower's wines were transported in wooden [[cask]]s, many buyers bottled the wine in glass bottles for resale.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], many strange items were found in bottles of Haeltower wines. These items included [[gold]] [[ring]]s, [[gem]]s, and ornate [[key]]s. The Tethyrian queen ordered an investigation led by [[Storl Thammuraster]] who, with the help of a [[Sembia]]n [[wizard]] named [[Amaront]] of [[Selgaunt]], uncovered an [[Amn]]ian smuggling operation run by several prominent noble families.
