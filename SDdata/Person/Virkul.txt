Virkul was a dragonsoul of the Cult of the Dragon that operated in Icewind Dale during the late 15 century DR. He played  a role in the cults effort to open a portal to the isle of Tuern in the Trackless Sea.
Virkul wore a stylized suit of plate armor with a helmet crafted in the likeness of a black dragons skull. He wielded a single, curved dagger in combat.
At some point in the 1480s DR, Virkul served directly under Severin Silrajin when the leader of the Dragon Cult performed the necessary actions to activate the portal to Tuern. When groups of adventurers arrived to thwart the cults efforts, Severin dispatched Virkul along with several iron golems to fight off some of their numbers.
As the Cult of the Dragon activated the portal, one band of adventurers managed to slip through in pursuit of them. Virkul remained behind to deal with the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge. Unfortunately for Dragonsoul Virkul, he and his minions were defeated in battle atop the snowy banks of Icewind Dale.
