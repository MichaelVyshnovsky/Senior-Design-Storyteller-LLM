'''Virkul''' was a [[dragonsoul]] of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that operated in [[Icewind Dale]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He played  a role in the cult's effort to open a ''[[portal]]'' to the isle of [[Tuern]] in the [[Trackless Sea]].

==Possessions==
Virkul wore a stylized suit of [[plate armor]] with a [[helmet]] crafted in the likeness of a [[black dragon]]'s skull. He wielded a single, curved dagger in combat.

==History==
At some point in the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Virkul served directly under [[Severin Silrajin]] when the leader of the Dragon Cult performed the necessary actions to activate the ''portal'' to Tuern. When groups of adventurers arrived to thwart the cult's efforts,{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 2}} Severin dispatched Virkul along with several [[iron golem]]s to fight off some of their numbers.

As the Cult of the Dragon activated the portal, one band of adventurers managed to slip through in pursuit of them. Virkul remained behind to deal with the [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]]. Unfortunately for Dragonsoul Virkul, he and his minions were defeated in battle atop the snowy banks of Icewind Dale.
