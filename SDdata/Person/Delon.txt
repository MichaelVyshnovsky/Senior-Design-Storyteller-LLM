Delon was a child messenger from the village of Imnesvale in the Umar Hills of Amn in the late 14 century DR.
Fael was a meek and stuttering human boy. He had light skin and dark brown hair.
In the , Delon was sent to Athkatla by the people of Imnesvale to bring back help in dealing with the recent deaths and disappearances. During his travels, Delon was met with cruel and mean people, had all of his coin stolen, and was left desperate to find an adventurer or two to take back to the Umar Hills. The child talked about missing people, folk going mad, some being found turned inside out, strange beasts seen skulking around, and even stories of the Umar Witch herself returning to torture the village. Subsequently, Delon may have came across Abdel Adrian and his companions and asking them to travel to the Umar Hills.
