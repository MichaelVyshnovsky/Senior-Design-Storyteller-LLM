'''Minolin Fey''', also known as '''Minolin Fey-Branche''' and '''Minolin Fey-Baenre''', was a Mistress of [[Arach-Tinilith]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] and wife of [[Gromph Baenre]], [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]].

==Personality==
Minolin had an inner strength and independence that was belied by her servitude to [[Quenthel Baenre]]. 

==History==
Minolin was a fifth-year novice priestess at [[Arach-Tinilith]] in [[1372 DR]]. She later served as a mistress of Arach-Tinilith, a position she held in [[1484 DR]]. In this position, she handled administrative work under Mistress [[Quenthel Baenre]] and was served by [[Myrineyl Baenre]].

While serving Quenthel Baenre at Arach-Tinilith, Minolin developed an ally in Gromph Baenre, Quenthel's brother. She became pregnant with his child in 1484 DR; in the same year, the two were married. Their child was to be named [[Yvonnel Baenre II|Yvonnel]] and was expected to become the successor of [[Matron Mother]] [[Quenthel Baenre]].

==Relationships==
Minolin served Quenthel Baenre, who viewed her as weak and a fool. However, Minolin developed a relationship with Gromph Baenre as her ally and advisor, a relationship Gromph intended to use to subvert his sister's power. Minolin in turn hoped to use Gromph to break the [[Tier Breche|Academy]] free from the control of [[House Baenre]].
