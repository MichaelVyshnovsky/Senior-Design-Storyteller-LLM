'''Zarr''' was a mad [[half-elf]] mercenary in [[Undermountain]] in [[1479 DR]].
 
==History==
In 1479 DR, during a job in [[Dalelands]], he saw a strange [[glyph]].

Later, Zarr went ro [[Waterdeep]] where he was hired by the young [[Rutherford Urmbrusk]] for a rescue mission, to find [[Quarren Urmbrusk]] inside Undermountain. However, during the expedition into the dungeon, Zarr saw a glyph very similar to the one in the Dalelands that afflicted his mind. Quickly Zarr turned his blade on a companion and Rutherford disappeared. After killing his companion, the now mad Zarr went in search of an army to lead.

Soon, he met a [[kobold]] tribe and in killing their chieftain gained command of them. The kobolds were at war with a nearby [[goblin]] tribe but Zarr defeated and absorbed the goblins into his growing army. He gained control of a small section of the dungeon and started to train his troops. He decided to attack all the adventurers arriving from the [[Yawning Portal]] and thanks to a bribe to [[Sanfin Lotte]], he gained the information he needed to ambush them.

Zarr was with his advisors studying maps for his campaign when an adventuring party hired to find Rutherford found and defeated him.

==Personality==
Zarr was always obsessed by military and war. However, after seeing the glyph, he believed himself a great war leader destined for great exploits. However, in his megalomania, he believed all his followers were loyal to him.
