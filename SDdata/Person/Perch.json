The lizard was instrumental to his initial distraction of Taaki, Sauks arumwon, which eventually led to Beruns own capture. The lizard was later instrumental to his escape from Sauks group. After Berun was separated from Lewan by a shambling mound, Perch was instrumental to nursing him back to health, by bringing him eggs to eat. The lizard was also instrumental to distracting the guards in the Fortress of the Old Man. Perch slew Taaki on the night of Tarsakh 25, after being swallowed whole. The lizard continued to fight afterwards, but its utility was limited against the Old Man of the Mountain. The lizard survived its master that night Lewan carried it outside of the tower."
