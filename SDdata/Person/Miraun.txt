'''Miraun''' ({{Pronounce|mih|RAWN|refs=}}) was a male [[human]] [[enchanter]] and the "diplomat at large" for [[Zhentil Keep]] and the [[Zhentarim]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].

==Personality==
As required in his job, Miraun was an intelligent and charming person. Although he was quite competent, [[Fzoul Chembryl]] disliked him, and as Fzoul rose in power, Miraun's position declined. Miraun couldn't think why [[Manshoon]] tolerated Fzoul in the Zhentarim. He considered doing more work with [[Darkhold]].

==Activities==
Miraun usually traveled as an ambassador for Zhentil Keep, in which capacity he reported to various heads of state the official position of the Zhentarim.

==History==
Miraun was a long-standing member of the Zhentarim and was their official envoy. In 1370 DR, his position began to decline as a result of Fzoul's dislike and own rise in status. Only his competent ambassadorial service shielded him from the worst consequences.
 
==Relationship==
Miraun was a bastard son of the noble Zhent [[Dannacaster]] family.
