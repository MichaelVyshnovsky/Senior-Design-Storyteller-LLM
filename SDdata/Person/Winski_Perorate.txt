Winski Perorate was the Bhaalist mentor of Sarevok who taughit him ambition and set him on the course to try and become the new Lord of Murder in the 14 century DR.
He taught Sarevok "in the darkest of rituals" and helped orchestrate his intended rise to power as the new Lord of Murder. He was not even certain himself of Sarevoks interpretation of the prophecy of the Bhaalspawn, that causing enough slaughter would cause him to ascend, and he was convinced even success would mean his own death. Nevertheless, he wanted to help him ascend in order to be remembered for his role in history.
When Gorions Ward foiled Sarevoks plans by exposing him in front of the surviving Grand Dukes of Baldurs Gate, Winski teleported in and took Sarevok away by magic, hoping to save his life in spite of the suddenly low odds of Sarevok ever ascending. The two fled to a maze under the base of the local thieves guild, but at the entrance of the Undercity Sarevok cut Winski down in retaliation for saving him rather than helping him to fight the Grand Dukes, their guards, and Gorions Ward head on. Sarevok continued with his remaining faithful followers to prepare for his last stand in the temple of Bhaal in the Undercity, while Winski was left for dead, though alive enough that when Gorions Ward later caught up, Perorate was able to explain much of what had happened.
