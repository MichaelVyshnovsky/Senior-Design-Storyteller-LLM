'''Rayphus Goodtree''' was a [[paladin]] in service to [[Tyr]] who lived in [[Baldur's Gate]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Rahphus was a man of faith and righteousness. He believed it was heretical for a [[priest]] to devote themselves to the worship of many [[deities]], as opposed to one in particular.

==Relationships==
All the men of the Goodtree family were expected to dedicate themselves to martial service in Tyr's name.

==History==
In his youth, Rayphus was afraid of not living up to his family's tradition and rejected living a life of service. As he got a bit older, he overcame his fear and took his vows as a paladin in Tyr's service.

When [[War of the Shining Crusade|war]] broke out in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Rayphus joined the [[Coalition]] forces to meet the threat of the [[Shining Crusade]]. He offered his services to a corporal of the [[Flaming Fist]], [[Bence Duncan]].
