==Description==
Those who knew Donovan in life said he had a thick skull but was a good person with a big heart. Others added that he liked to drink a bit too much at the [[The Salty Dog Tavern]] in the docks of Targos.

==History==
Donovan and his beloved [[Veira]]'s lives ended some years before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}. By some accords, Donovan sailed into [[Maer Dualdon]] after drinking a bit too much and soon after met his doom in a storm. Veira's heart was broken, and she hurled herself out of the window to the base of the cliff. Since then, the lake-facing room in the [[Weeping Widow Inn]] remained locked and unused, with Veira's ghost appearing and crying on the deepest nights.

Some said that her spirit found rest in 1312 DR, soon after a group of adventurers from [[Luskan]] found a broken carved prow from the [[skiff]] called ''[[Veira's Gaze]]'' that was displayed for several years at the Salty Dog Tavern where Donovan liked to drink.
