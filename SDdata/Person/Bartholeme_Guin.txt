'''Bartholeme Guin''' was an adventurer and a member of the [[Company of the Lynx]] for a time during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He had a twin brother [[Parys Guin|Parys]], who was a also a spellcaster in the same adventuring company.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Bartholeme and rest of the Company of the Lynx recovered a collection of [[magic]]ally sealed [[pouch]]es among the remains of a dead [[dragon]] near the [[Wyvernwater]]. The Guin brothers refused to use their magic to open the pouches, believing them to be old and dangerous in nature.

Rather than press Bartholeme and Parys, the company's leader [[Knorrel Talbot]] hired the lone spellcaster [[Midnight]] to complete the deed. When she removed the arcane protections from the pouches, Talbot hid the fact they contained scrolls bearing the [[true name]]s of a great many [[Red Wizard]]s of [[Thay]]. When Midnight used a ''[[clairaudience]]'' spell to learn this secret and fled into the night, Talbot ordered the twins along with the rest of the company to take her down.

Bartholeme Guin and all but one member of the Company of the Lynx died that night in a conflagration of blue fire. Only Midnight survived.
