        "Personality": "He had a reputation for flying into fits of rage, typical for clerics of his religion.",

        "Activities": "Owing to his explosive temperament, the residents of Shadowdale tended to avoid Thear. He was very interested in purchasing a warhorse, but had trouble finding a suitable mount: he found [[horse]]s too large, and [[pony|ponies]] too scrawny."
