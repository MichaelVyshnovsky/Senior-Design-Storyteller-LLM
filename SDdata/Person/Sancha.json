        "History": "Even though Sancha lived in a town of [[Bowshot]] on the [[Sword Coast]], she had been exchanging letters with Alicine Bricket for the majority of their lives since childhood. In [[1372 DR]], Sancha was expected to visit her old friend in the Bricket Homestead to the west of Daggerford. She was invited to a celebration of Alicine's and [[Muriel Bricket]]'s much hated brother, [[Elveronne Bricket]]."
