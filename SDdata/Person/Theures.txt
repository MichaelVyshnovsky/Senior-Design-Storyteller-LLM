'''Theures''' was a [[Dragonsoul]]<ref group="note">One lore entry in ''[[Neverwinter: Tyranny of Dragons]]'' incorrectly refers to Theures as Wyrmspeaker. of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that took the lead on their operations in [[Icespire Peak]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was a direct subordinate of [[Wyrmspeaker]] [[Galvan]].

==History==
In the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Theures was directed to take the lead on acquiring [[mithral]] from within the [[Clan Icehammer]]'s [[Icespire Peak#Notable Locations|mine]] at Icespire Peak within the [[Sword Mountains]]. While the valuable metal was much desired by the cult for the construction of their ''[[lightning jar]]s'', as well as construction efforts elsewhere, Theures did use some of what they acquired as an offering to the [[white dragon]] [[Merothrax]].
