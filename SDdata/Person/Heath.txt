==History==
Sergeant Heath fought in the [[Siege of Helm's Hold|reclamation of Helm's Hold]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, following its occupation by [[devil]]-worshiping [[Ashmadai]] forces. He worked with fellow guardsmen to rescue Lieutenant [[Nessfettle]] and her squad, after being forced to barricade themselves in a building to stay safe from the [[fiend]]s that roamed the city's streets.
