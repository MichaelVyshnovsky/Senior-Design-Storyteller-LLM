He was a light-skinned human man with sharp features, stubble, and long blond hair. He wore armor of the Zhentarim and wielded two hammers in battle, even as an incorporeal spirit.\nIn the 15 century DR, Alash could be seen haunting the depths of the Haunted Halls, having perished long before. His equipment suggested that he was one of the Zhentish agents who once worked under Whisper in the mid-14 century DR."
