        "mainbody": "'''Alash''' was a [[ghost]] who haunted the infamous [[Haunted Halls]] near the village of [[Eveningstar]] in [[Cormyr]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "In his [[undead]] state, Alash retained the appearance of his mortal self. He was a light-skinned [[human]] man with sharp features, stubble, and long blond hair. He wore armor of the [[Zhentarim]] and wielded two [[hammer]]s in battle, even as an incorporeal spirit.",
        "Activities": "In the 15{{th}} century DR, Alash could be seen haunting the depths of the Haunted Halls, having perished long before. His equipment suggested that he was one of the Zhentish agents who once worked under [[Whisper]] in the mid-14{{th}} century DR."
