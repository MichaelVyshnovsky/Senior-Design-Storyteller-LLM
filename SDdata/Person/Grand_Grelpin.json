        "mainbody": "'''Grand Grelpin''' was a [[kobold]] [[wyrmpriest]] in [[Undermountain]] in [[1479 DR]].",
        "History": "In 1479 DR, he was leading his tribe into Undermountain in search of a rumored [[dragon]] when the mad [[half-elf]] mercenary [[Zarr]] appeared and killed their chieftain. Most of the kobolds believed Zarr to be the dragon in half-elf form. Grelpin did not agree but said nothing to avoid being killed. He served Zarr until the mercenary ordered Grelpin to face a [[basilisk]]. Instead he hid in his chamber, planning a way to escape.",
        "Personality": "Grelpin wanted to overthrow Zarr and the alliance with the [[goblin]]s and proclaim himself as the new chieftain. As the tribe's priest, he couldn't abandon his fellows.",
