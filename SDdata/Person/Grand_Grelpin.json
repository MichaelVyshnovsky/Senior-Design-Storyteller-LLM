Most of the kobolds believed Zarr to be the dragon in half-elf form. Grelpin did not agree but said nothing to avoid being killed. He served Zarr until the mercenary ordered Grelpin to face a basilisk. Instead he hid in his chamber, planning a way to escape.\nGrelpin wanted to overthrow Zarr and the alliance with the goblins and proclaim himself as the new chieftain. As the tribes priest, he couldnt abandon his fellows.\nCategoryKobolds\nCategoryPriests and priestesses\nCategoryInhabitants of Undermountain\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nsgf4c7mch7ve7ezzonwmsf0r5407ukp"
