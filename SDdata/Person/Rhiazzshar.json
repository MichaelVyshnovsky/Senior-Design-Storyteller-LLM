        "mainbody": "Rhiazzshar was a wood elf druid of Silvanus and a member of a tribe in Wildhome in the late 15 century DR.\nRhiazzshar had amber-colored eyes and mahogany skin. She smelled of freshly crushed pine needles.\nIn 1479 DR, when the wild elves became interested in Duvans immunity to the Spellplague, Rhiazzshar pretended to show affection for him so that she could convince Duvan to participate in experiments to determine the limits of his abilities. They became lovers for a time but Duvan rejected her when he realized she was using him for her own purposes."
