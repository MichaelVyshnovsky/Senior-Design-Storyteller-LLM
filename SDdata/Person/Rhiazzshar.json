        "mainbody": "'''Rhiazzshar''' was a [[wood elf]] [[druid]] of [[Silvanus]] and a member of a tribe in [[Wildhome]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Rhiazzshar had amber-colored eyes and mahogany skin. She smelled of freshly crushed pine needles.",
        "History": "In [[1479 DR]], when the wild elves became interested in [[Duvan]]'s immunity to the [[Spellplague]], Rhiazzshar pretended to show affection for him so that she could convince Duvan to participate in experiments to determine the limits of his abilities. They became lovers for a time but Duvan rejected her when he realized she was using him for her own purposes."
