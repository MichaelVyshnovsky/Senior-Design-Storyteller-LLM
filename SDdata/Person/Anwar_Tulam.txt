'''Anwar Tulam''' was an [[elf|elven]] [[Corsair (kit)|corsair]] and captain of the pirate vessel the ''[[Reaver (ship)|Reaver]]'' in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

His banner was a flying pair of crossed [[cutlass]]es.

==Personality==
Easily the most-feared pirate haunting [[Zakharan seas|Suq Bay]] and even the [[Zakharan seas|Golden Gulf]], Anwar's bloodthirsty nature struck terror into the hearts of anyone sailing on the bay.

==Activities==
Anwar and his crew attacked anyone they came into contact with on the open water. Fire was his preferred method of attack. He enjoyed using his [[liquid star]] projector on ships from the Admiralty of [[Huzuz]].

As of 1367 DR, Anwar had a 5,000 [[dinar]] price tag attached to his head.

==Rumors and Legends==
After a brutal attack on the admirality, Anwar's ship was left short of men and was believed to be heading for the [[Pearl Cities]] to recruit new crewmembers.
