        "mainbody": "'''Koront''' was one of the three war-leaders of the [[Tornskulls]], a tribe of nearly 5,000 [[orc]]s whose territory encompassed the [[Dead Orc Pass]] in the [[Rauvin Mountains]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Immense in size, even for an orc, Koront had gray, heavily-scarred skin and a bald head.\n\nKoront was renowned among the tribe for his endurance in battle.",
        "History": "War-leader Koront, along with [[Naurorin]] and [[Baerzel]], took over as leaders of the Tornskulls after a cave-in killed the tribe's chieftain [[Glorlarkh]] in the early 1370's.",
        "Relationships": "Koront had an intense rivalry with his fellow War-leader Naurorin, which was well-reciprocated. Baerzel kept the two in check, reminding them that in-fighting would weaken the tribe and stop their greater goal of becoming a greater power in the region.\n\nOne of Koront's remarkable commanders was [[Vaug|Vaug the strong]], whose ''claw'' of 80 orcs was stationed at the Dead Orc Pass.\n\n{{Stub-person}}"
