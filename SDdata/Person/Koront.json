        "mainbody": "Koront was one of the three war-leaders of the Tornskulls, a tribe of nearly 5,000 orcs whose territory encompassed the Dead Orc Pass in the Rauvin Mountains during the late 14 century DR.\nImmense in size, even for an orc, Koront had gray, heavily-scarred skin and a bald head.\nKoront was renowned among the tribe for his endurance in battle.\nWar-leader Koront, along with Naurorin and Baerzel, took over as leaders of the Tornskulls after a cave-in killed the tribes chieftain Glorlarkh in the early 1370s.\nKoront had an intense rivalry with his fellow War-leader Naurorin, which was well-reciprocated. Baerzel kept the two in check, reminding them that in-fighting would weaken the tribe and stop their greater goal of becoming a greater power in the region.\nOne of Koronts remarkable commanders was Vaug the strong, whose claw of 80 orcs was stationed at the Dead Orc Pass."
