        "mainbody": "Ottolenszillasla, or Otto for short, was a violet faerie dragon living in Maddgoths Castle in Undermountain in the 14 and 15 centuries DR.\nAround 1483 DR, Otto was drawn into Undermountain by Halaster Blackcloaks magic, together with a stone giant clan. He enjoyed his new home, especially Maddgoths Castle, whose magic did not affect the dragon. So Otto decided to settle there playing with the stone giants.\nBy 1492 DR, Otto was growing tired of the presence of Maddgoths homunculus and started make plans to remove it.\nOtto was a typical faerie dragon.\nWhen bored, Otto played pranks on the nearby stone giants or fought with Maddgoths homunculus as it annoyed him."
