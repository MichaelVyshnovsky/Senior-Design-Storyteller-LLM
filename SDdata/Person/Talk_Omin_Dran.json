And after being transported into Faerûn in the latter years of the 15th century DR., He would become a Masked Lord of Waterdeep.",
        "mainbody": "Little was known of his two sisters, Portentia and Auspicia.\nHis Mother Prophetess owns a tavern in the town of Red-Larch known as the \"Dran and Courtier\", which Omin loans as a base for the C-Team.\nPortentia was later rescued from the Wandering Crypt, a living dungeon, by the C-Team. She currently resides in Red-Larch with Prophetess at the \"Dran and Courtier\".\nOmin Dran is the biological child of 2 mothers, the means of how this was possible is never specified\nOmin Dran has been described by Diath Woodrow as \"the worst kept secret of Waterdeep.\"\nOmin was born to Prophetess Dran in an inn somewhere in another world. Years later, he founded Acquisitions Incorporated for some secret purpose.\nBeing thrown through the multiverse, by his party members dimensional traveling mansion, him as well as his employees Jim Darkmagic and Binwin Bronzebottom crash landed outside of the City of Waterdeep in the Forgotten Realms.\nShortly after arriving in the city he began to look wealth that would allow for Acquisitions Incorporated to climb back to the top as since they had moved worlds, they lost all their capital. Their quest for wealth lead them to a rogue named Viari, who had a map of Undermountain. Omin hired Viari as an Intern and they began their quest. Moments later he was run over by a stage coach. Being hurt quite badly, Omin realized that he could not use any of his divine magic to heal himself, finding out that his old patron, the goddess Avandra, had no presence in the world of Faerûn. He then received a blessing from the goddess Tymora, leading him to go to her temple and convert to being a Cleric of her, and then regain his divine spells.\nAfter exploring through the Undermountain the four ran into a [http//forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Djinni genies] harem, and noticed that one of the women was tied up in chains. Jim Darkmagic freed her and was about to kiss her when the woman transformed into her true form, a succubus and gutted Jim with her claws, killing him instantaneously. The succubus then did a charm spell on Viari and used him to attack Omin with his rapier. The succubus then turned to attack the brainwashed Viari killing him also. Omin received a lot of damage and was close to death, but with the help of Binwin Bronzebottom they were able to send the Fiend back to the Abyss. Saddened over the loss of his friends it was at that moment that Tymora raised Viari back to life. And somehow Viari was able to sing a magic song that resurrected Jim Darkmagic. As a team they found a way out of the Undermountain maze.\nUpon reaching the exit the four stumbled upon a gigantic sized stone statue in the likeness of the Mad Mage Halaster, the designer of the Undermountain, who died nearly a century ago. Climbing inside the statue they engage in a battle with Halaster, who had somehow imbued the enchanted statue with a peace of his consciousness. As a team they defeated the spirit of Halaster and took control of the Statue by climbing inside it, finding controls within. Traveling back to Waterdeep they were met by a Tarrasque who had been sleeping for centuries under the City of the Dead. Bursting out from the ground and engaging the Halaster mech. The giant stone Halaster defeated the beast with a single kick.\nOmin, Jim, Bindwin, and Viari were all celebrated as heroes for defeating the Tarrasque and saving the city from destruction. It was decided that Acquisitions Incorporated would settle in Waterdeep and the rebuilding of their business would start from there. Shortly thereafter Omin was awarded with the Title of Masked Lord of Waterdeep, and invited to participate in the city secret council meetings. Wearing a mask and dark clothes, as well as using a magic staff that altered his voice, his identity was kept a secret from even the other masked lords.\nSome time after becoming a Masked Lord, Omin attended a council meeting that was quite crowded with seventeen other Lords present, unusual as there were usually only five to six regular members. Among the things discussed were repairing the damages done to the citys graveyard by the reawakened Tarrasque, the project to dismantle the Enchanted Statue, and the announcement that a nobles house had been sacked by men in all black, finally a unanimous vote was carried out to denounce and replace [http//forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Dagult_Neverember Dagult Neverember] as the Open Lord of Waterdeep for his neglecting of his city and instead focus on the rebuilding and annexing of Neverwinter in his propaganda based movement called New Neverwinter. Before leaving the council room he was warned by a female masked lord to watch his back.\nIn 1491 DR during the Death Masks assassination Omin felt safe enough after the deaths of other Lords that he did not seek to hire body guards like his fellow lord, Landarmyn Voskur. Omin was one of the few Masked Lords who not only survived the assassinations but also kept his true identity hidden."
