Linan Swift was a human female commoner in the small town of Greenest, located in the Western Heartlands in west Faer√ªn.
As a mother, Linan would fight to the death to save her children and her husband.
To protect her children, Swift was known to fight with a round shield and a worn spear.
Around 1489 DR during a battle with the Cult of the Dragon in the Tyranny of Dragons, Linan, her husband Cuth Swift, and their children were pursued by some kobolds until they were saved by some adventurers. After the fight, the commoners asked to be taken to the safety of the Keep.
