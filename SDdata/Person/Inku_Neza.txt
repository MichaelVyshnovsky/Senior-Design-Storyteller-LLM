'''Inku Neza''' was a [[barbarian]] [[berserker]] member of the [[Dead Eyes]], a criminal group from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] that named itself for the grim trophies they collected from their enemies, in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Inku was a [[dragonborn]] woman with flaming red eyes, brown scales, and long horns that curved inward. She wore a set of [[splint mail]] [[armor]] and was armed with two [[handaxe]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Dead Eyes set out to perform a job that would end up setting the gang against [[the Guild]] and its leader, [[Ninefingers]]. The Guild did not take competition lightly and sent thugs to take care of the Dead Eyes. The band survived and relocated to a new lair. Unbeknownst to [[Aideen Ni Chuirc]], the gang's leader, one of her men was a traitor, informing the Guild of the lair and the hidden stash's location. The traitor [[bard]] instructed Ninefingers's men to strike at the hideout quickly and hard. It was unknown if Inku Neza and the Dead Eyes survived an attack from the Guild or other eager adventurers of Baldur's Gate.
