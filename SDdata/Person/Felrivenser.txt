'''Felrivenser''', also known as '''Gembright''', was an [[amethyst dragon]] who dwelled in the [[Channel Lock]] within the empire of [[Netheril]] in the first to third millennia before [[Dalereckoning]].{{Cite web enhancement/Roll Call of Dragons}}

==History==
She was first recorded when she arrived on one of the northern locks in {{YearlinkConvert|1027|NY}}, then only an [[dragon aging|adult]] dragon. She claimed all the surrounding lands as her own and made her lair on an island.

Thereafter, knowing her as Gembright, a handful of curious [[Netherese]] [[archwizard]]s made their way there to talk about [[magic]], the affairs of [[dragon]]s, and matters in society of the time.

Gembright lived there over two millennia and grew to become an ancient wyrm, but something forced her to leave her island in {{YearlinkConvert|3214|NY}}. She never came back.

Living elsewhere, she survived a few more centuries, becoming a mighty great wyrm.

By the 14{{th}} century DR, Felrivenser was considered to be long deceased.

===Legacy===
In the 3{{rd}} century DR, the [[sorceress]] [[Chassabra]], called the Lady of Swirling Stones and a ruler of the [[Mlembryn Lands]] by the [[River Dessarin]], researched her genealogy and discovered she was a descendant of Felrivenser. What's more, she was believed to have found Felrivenser's treasure hoard and stashed it in an extradimensional space accessed only by a [[portal]] unlocked by her [[Chassabra's pendant|pendant]]. Eventually, she transformed herself into an amethyst [[half-dragon]] and abandoned her tower and her realm.
