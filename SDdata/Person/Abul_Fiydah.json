        "mainbody": "Abul Fiydah was the Amir of Estanil during the midâ€“14th century DR.\nAs the ultimate commander of the forces stationed in Estanil, Abul was faced with the difficult task of defending the border city of Semphar.\nFive thousand troops were at his disposal, though only 1,000 were in the city at any given time. They were stationed in the only stone building within the city.\nStrangely enough, his most difficult challenges did not come from the goblins and elves who attacked from outside of the city, but from the Council of Loggers found within."
