'''Fara Icehewer''' was a [[ranger]] of the [[Sky Pony]] tribe of [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s that lived in [[Wolmad's Camp|a camp]] in the [[Nether Mountains]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]. This band snubbed the traditions of the Uthgardt and acted as plundering bandits under the leadership of [[Wolmad Eaglewing]].

Despite her identity with the tribe, Fara led a faction within the Sky Ponies that opposed the needless violence and greed.
