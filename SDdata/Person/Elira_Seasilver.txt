'''Elira Seasilver''' was a noblewoman of [[Seasilver|House Seasilver]] and the grand duchess of [[Marsember]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Elira could be cold, dismissive and emotionally manipulative.

==Personality==
She had a particular distaste for [[apple]]s and anything apple-flavored.

==Relationships==
Lady Elira and her husband Grand Duke [[Farnig Seasilver]] had a single daughter, named [[Arietta Seasilver|Arietta]].

==History==
On [[Uktar 2]] of the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, Lady Elira was captured by [[Yder Tanthul]] during the evacuation of [[Marsember]], in the conflict between [[Netheril]] and [[Cormyr]]. She was rescued a short time later by the combined efforts of her daughter and house guards, guardsmen of the [[Marsember Watch]], and three [[chosen]] of the gods; [[Kleef Kenric]], [[Joelle Emmeline]], and [[Malik el Sami]]. The grand duchess was then sailed to safety by watchman [[Jang]], presumably to her extended family in [[Westgate]].
