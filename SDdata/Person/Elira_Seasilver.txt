Elira Seasilver was a noblewoman of House Seasilver and the grand duchess of Marsember during the late 15 century DR.
Elira could be cold, dismissive and emotionally manipulative.
She had a particular distaste for apples and anything apple-flavored.
Lady Elira and her husband Grand Duke Farnig Seasilver had a single daughter, named Arietta.
On Uktar 2 of the , Lady Elira was captured by Yder Tanthul during the evacuation of Marsember, in the conflict between Netheril and Cormyr. She was rescued a short time later by the combined efforts of her daughter and house guards, guardsmen of the Marsember Watch, and three chosen of the gods Kleef Kenric, Joelle Emmeline, and Malik el Sami. The grand duchess was then sailed to safety by watchman Jang, presumably to her extended family in Westgate.
