'''Temis''' was the precept of [[Mishtan]] in southeast [[Mulhorand]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Temis oversaw both Mishtan and the nearby [[Land of the Dead]]. The tombs of past pharoahs found within the Land of the Dead were his responsibility. Temis was a [[priest]] of [[Osiris]].
