        "mainbody": "Cryovain was a white dragon enslaved by frost giants sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.\nCryovain was dim-witted and cruel, like most white dragons. He refused to cooperate with or show mercy to humanoids, regardless of whatever aid they might have provided him.\nHe seemed genuinely invested in the well-being of his mate and his eggs.\nCryovain lived with his mate Isendraug on Svardborg.\nIn the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, frost giant minions of Jarl Storvald reclaimed the place during an absence of Isendraug and Cryovain and took the opportunity to steal all their eggs. Storvald blackmailed the two white dragons to obey his orders or face the destruction of the eggs.\nCryovain was chained to the \"Krigvind\", the jarls colossal warship. During battles, Storvald ordered Cryovain to provide air support.\nAfter escaping the frost giants, Cryovain flew south to avoid other more powerful dragons. He killed the orc war chief Kra and drove his tribe of orcs out of Icespire Hold on Icespire Peak, taking the fortress as his new lair. Cryovain terrorized the surrounding areas&mdashincluding the settlements of Phandalin, Gnomengarde, Leilon, and Neverwinter&mdashand the displaced orcs wreaked havoc in the area as well. Cryovain also drove a manticore from its mountaintop nest, which then attacked Adabra Gwynns home on Umbrage Hill."
