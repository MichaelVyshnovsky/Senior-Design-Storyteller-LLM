        "mainbody": "'''Cryovain''' was a [[white dragon]] enslaved by [[frost giant]]s sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].",
        "Personality": "Cryovain was dim-witted and cruel, like most white dragons. He refused to cooperate with or show mercy to [[humanoid]]s, regardless of whatever aid they might have provided him.\n\nHe seemed genuinely invested in the well-being of his mate and his eggs.",
        "History": "Cryovain lived with his mate [[Isendraug]] on [[Svardborg]].\n\nIn the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, frost giant minions of Jarl [[Storvald]] reclaimed the place during an absence of Isendraug and Cryovain and took the opportunity to steal all their eggs. Storvald blackmailed the two white dragons to obey his orders or face the destruction of the eggs.\n\nCryovain was chained to the \"[[Krigvind]]\", the jarl's colossal warship. During battles, Storvald ordered Cryovain to provide air support.\n\nAfter escaping the frost giants, Cryovain flew south to avoid other more powerful dragons. He killed the [[orc]] war chief [[Kra]] and drove his tribe of orcs out of [[Icespire Hold]] on [[Icespire Peak]], taking the fortress as his new lair. Cryovain terrorized the surrounding areas&mdash;including the settlements of [[Phandalin]], [[Gnomengarde]], [[Leilon]], and [[Neverwinter]]&mdash;and the displaced orcs wreaked havoc in the area as well. Cryovain also drove a [[manticore]] from its mountaintop nest, which then attacked [[Adabra Gwynn|Adabra Gwynn's]] home on [[Umbrage Hill]]."
