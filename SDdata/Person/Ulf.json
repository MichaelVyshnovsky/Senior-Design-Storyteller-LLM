        "Activities": "Ulf was a shaman and religious leader of the [[Northlander]]s.",
        "History": "Ulf grew up with his cousin [[Hrolf]], being sons of twin-born brothers.\n\nThe night that Ulf's twin daughters [[Dagmar]] and [[Ygraine]] were born, an omen said that Ygraine would bring back the ancient magic of the [[Shapechange]] and thus it was decided she must marry [[Wedigar]], the only man gifted with that power. In [[1360 DR]], however, Ygraine was lost in a sudden squall.\n\nIn [[1361 DR]], the renegade [[drow]] wizard [[Liriel Baenre]] went to met Ulf in order to learn [[rune magic]] to carve inside the [[Yggdrasil's Child]] with the [[Windwalker (artifact)|windwalker]]. However, Ulf disagreed with Liriel and refused to help her. At that time, [[Ivar]] informed Ulf that some hunters who had gone to hunt with First Axe [[Aumark Lithyl]] were slaughtered and only the Axe came back injured. Ulf went to heal Aumark but the wounds were too deep so Liriel arrived and saved Aumark with [[Lolth]]'s clerical powers, impressing Ulf. Despite this, however, Ulf still refused to teach Liriel.\n\nLater, he led the song for the dead Hrolf and saw that Liriel was also devastated by the loss and at last agreed to teach rune magic to her. Together they conducted the burial of Hrolf and at the same time started Liriel's training. Liriel was so powerful that Ulf decided that she could forge the rune that night. However, at the last moment, Liriel understood that she needed [[Fyodor]] to forge the rune and Ulf said she did not need him any more.\n\nThe next morning, Ulf told Liriel that his daughter Dagmar, acting as a substitute for Ygraine, went to [[Holgerstead]] to marry [[Wedigar]], the First Axe of that village. He asked Liriel to accompany her, taking the role of Hrolf at the wedding. \n\nAfter Dagmar's defection, Ulf started to study with Liriel the magic of the windwalker, helping her to understand the religiosity of the Northmen. \n\nDuring [[Ascarle]]'s attack on Ruathym, Ulf died.",
        "Relationships": "Ulf had two daughters, [[Dagmar]] and [[Ygraine]], from his wife [[Sanja]]. His cousin was Captain [[Hrolf]].",
