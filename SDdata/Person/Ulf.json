        "mainbody": "Ulf was a shaman of Ruathym in 1361 DR.\nUlf was a shaman and religious leader of the Northlanders.\nUlf grew up with his cousin Hrolf, being sons of twin-born brothers.\nThe night that Ulfs twin daughters Dagmar and Ygraine were born, an omen said that Ygraine would bring back the ancient magic of the Shapechange and thus it was decided she must marry Wedigar, the only man gifted with that power. In 1360 DR, however, Ygraine was lost in a sudden squall.\nIn 1361 DR, the renegade drow wizard Liriel Baenre went to met Ulf in order to learn rune magic to carve inside the Yggdrasils Child with the windwalker. However, Ulf disagreed with Liriel and refused to help her. At that time, Ivar informed Ulf that some hunters who had gone to hunt with First Axe Aumark Lithyl were slaughtered and only the Axe came back injured. Ulf went to heal Aumark but the wounds were too deep so Liriel arrived and saved Aumark with Lolths clerical powers, impressing Ulf. Despite this, however, Ulf still refused to teach Liriel.\nLater, he led the song for the dead Hrolf and saw that Liriel was also devastated by the loss and at last agreed to teach rune magic to her. Together they conducted the burial of Hrolf and at the same time started Liriels training. Liriel was so powerful that Ulf decided that she could forge the rune that night. However, at the last moment, Liriel understood that she needed Fyodor to forge the rune and Ulf said she did not need him any more.\nThe next morning, Ulf told Liriel that his daughter Dagmar, acting as a substitute for Ygraine, went to Holgerstead to marry Wedigar, the First Axe of that village. He asked Liriel to accompany her, taking the role of Hrolf at the wedding. \nAfter Dagmars defection, Ulf started to study with Liriel the magic of the windwalker, helping her to understand the religiosity of the Northmen. \nDuring Ascarles attack on Ruathym, Ulf died.\nUlf had two daughters, Dagmar and Ygraine, from his wife Sanja. His cousin was Captain Hrolf. \nCategoryHumans\nCategoryNorthlanders\nCategoryShamans\nCategoryInhabitants of Ruathym\nCategoryInhabitants of the Trackless Sea\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nsedb0285326sgatz5068u0sv4c9lhai"
