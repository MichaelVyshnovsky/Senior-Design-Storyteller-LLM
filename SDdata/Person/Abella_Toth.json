        "Description": "Abella was a [[human]] woman with an almost ghostly white skin tone, long, straight black hair, and icy blue eyes. She wore a fine official Magistrate's uniform, and could be seen holding a [[holy symbol]] of [[Shar]] (no doubt kept for investigatory purposes, not her own faith).",
        "Activities": "Abella worked alongside her fellow Magistrates [[Celia Pendrick]], [[Barthold Moncrief]], and [[Cornelius Latrimor]] in the [[Wheloon Docks]] as they oversaw the prison and investigated situations as they arose.",
        "History": "{{quote|''Disturbing, very disturbing. We must investigate this right away!''\n|Abella, pondering the presence of Sharrans in the hills}}\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, Magistrates Abella, Celia, and Barthold traveled to Eveningstar to pursue an investigation into reported sightings of [[Sharran]]s in the [[Storm Horns]] foothills. Abella believed that the infamous Wheloon escapee [[Dedryk Black]] was hiding in the region and gathering a cult, and she sent a band of [[adventurer]]s from the world of [[Eberron]] to search for him in the hills. After a successful raid on his [[Sharran hideout (Storm Horns)|hideout]], Dedryk and some of his cultists were handed over to Magistrate Toth and her associates to be transported to Wheloon for imprisonment, personally overseen by Magistrate Moncrief. She rewarded the adventurers with a powerful holy symbol of Shar, the ''[[Guidance of Shar]]'', trusting them to use it appropriately."
