Queen Neri was a storm giant queen in the late 15 century DR.
Neri was the queen of the storm giants, and was married to King Hekaton.
At one point, she went with her youngest child Serissa to the Sword Coast and the Moonshae Isles to meet friendly small folk.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, her brother-in-law, Uthor, found Neris dead body. Uthor went to his niece, Serissa, for counsel and the daughter of the queen managed to calm her fathers rightful rage.Â After this, Hekaton decided to first uncover the truth behind his wifes demise, before taking action.
Neri was known for her friendliness towards the small folk, a trait she passed to her youngest daughter, Serissa. However, she showed equal favor for her children, Mirran and Nym believed she showed favoritism, leading to jealousy of Serissa.
