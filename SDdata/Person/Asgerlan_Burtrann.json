        "History": "Asgerlan described his work as \"a brief and tasteful inquiry into interesting social pastimes and their effects.\" but members of the Cormyrian nobility judged the work to be treasonous in its revelations. [[Throrton Marliir]] had Asgerlan put to death by being dragged behind a horse.\n{{Quote|&hellip;staining the good names and characters of the fine families of the realm, and thereby besmirching all Cormyr, and moreover laying bare diverse secrets and weaknesses of the kingdom to all of its foes possessed of the ability to read, or listen to what others read aloud&mdash;which might well include a few [[Sembia]]ns.|Throrton Marliir, on the reason for Asgerlan Burtrann's execution.}}"
