For his creation he was targeted by many [[Calishite]] assassins, one the famed [[Thyruin of the White Flowers]], and subject of many kidnapping attempts by merchants of [[Amn]], [[Luskan]], and [[Thay]]. Rhalagligalade asked the protection of the [[Lords' Alliance]], who sent an adventuring party to act as his bodyguards."
