        "mainbody": "'''Feg''' was a trained and magically enhanced [[flying monkey]] that belonged to [[Kaverin Ebonhand]] of the [[Cult of Frost]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Feg is very valuable to me, and I treasure him greatly.''|Kaverin Ebonhand}}",
        "Description": "Feg was an [[albino]], its most notable feature was its leathery [[bat]]-like wings, that made Feg unique among other winged monkeys.",
        "Abilities": "Apart from being a pet, Feg was used as a living fan by Kaverin Ebonhand, during his venture to [[Chult]] in search of the fabled ''[[Ring of Winter]]''. The magic enchantment of the monkey allowed its master to send the creature out as his spy and see through its eyes, similar to a [[wizard]]'s ''[[familiar]]''.",
        "History": "Kaverin Ebonhand purchased Feg from a wizard in [[Tantras]].\n\nIn [[1362 DR]], Feg accompanied its master on board of the ''[[Narwhal (galleon)|Narwhal]]'', the vessel of Captain [[Bawr]], from [[Baldur's Gate]] to [[Chult]], in search of the ''Ring of Winter''. The flying monkey served as an invaluable asset in the sweltering heat of the jungle as it constantly fanned its master.\n\nAs Kaverin Ebonhand ventured into the jungle, trying o locate the artifact ahead of his nemesis, an ex-[[Harper]] adventurer [[Artus Cimber]], the villain stroke a shaky alliance with Chultan [[Batiri]] [[goblin]]s and their beautiful queen [[M'bobo]]. The partnership came at a price, however. Kaverin Ebonhand gave his provisions up for the goblins' service and gifted Feg to the queen, to Feg's utter disgust.  Ebonhand still reserved the right to use his albino monkey as a spy in the quest for the ''Ring''.\n\nSoon after, Feg was sent to be Kaverin's eyes, spying on Artus Cimber and his activities in the hidden city of [[Mezro]]. The flying monkey was caught and instantly slain by [[Neyobu]], a guardian [[panther]] of [[Ras T'fima]], one of Mezro's ''[[Bara]]''. Feg's body was used for Ras T'fima's [[witch doctor]] magic. He used [[quartz]] crystals to track Feb's connection back to its master, allowing Artus to track the villain."
