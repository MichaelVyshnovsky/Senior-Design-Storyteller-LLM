Pelendethas Everstride was an elf who lived in New Sharandar during the late 15 century of the Faer√ªnian calendar.
Pelendethas served as a military officer under Merrisara Winterwhite, the leader of the New Sharandar. He was tasked with overseeing operations at a camp located near the Blighted Grove.
Circa the  , the elves of New Sharandar were threatened by the aggressive actions taken by the fomorian king Malabog, who had raised an army of dark fey minions such as redcaps and cyclopes. Pelendethas led the counter-offensive against these foes, working with the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to slay scores of redcaps and cyclops warriors.
When the Scion of Corruption broke through the Feydark breach deep within the Blighted Grove, Pelendethas enlisted the hero from Neverwinter to delve into the corrupted grove and eliminate the diseased fomorian monstrosity.
