'''Pelendethas Everstride''' was an [[elf]] who lived in [[New Sharandar]] during the late 15{{th}} century of the [[Calendar of Harptos|Faerûnian calendar]].

==Activities==
Pelendethas served as a military officer under [[Merrisara Winterwhite]], the leader of the New Sharandar. He was tasked with overseeing operations at a camp located near the [[Blighted Grove]].

==History==
''Circa'' the  {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the elves of New Sharandar were threatened by the aggressive actions taken by the [[fomorian]] king [[Malabog]], who had raised an army of [[dark fey]] minions such as [[redcap]]s and [[cyclopes]]. Pelendethas led the counter-offensive against these foes, working with the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to slay scores of redcaps and cyclops warriors.

When the [[Scion of Corruption]] broke through the [[Feydark]] breach deep within the Blighted Grove, Pelendethas enlisted the hero from [[Neverwinter]] to delve into the corrupted grove and eliminate the diseased fomorian monstrosity.
