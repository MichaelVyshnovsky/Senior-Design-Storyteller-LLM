adventurer
Szuszalan, known as the Warrior Maid, was a veteran former adventurer and later advisor in the settlement of Goldenfields in the Dessarin Valley in the 14 century DR.
In her youth, she was a member of the Circle of Steel, a famous all-female adventuring company. They dared to explore the ruins of Myth Drannor and, most impressively, lived to tell the tale. Szuszalan won her first handful of gold from the adventure.
She later founded another adventuring band, The Company of the Fiery Fane.
In her time, Szuszalan slew an evil dragon and destroyed a vile lich, and she won much treasure over her life. But eventually the gems lost their allure and the gold lost its gleam, and her victories grew dull. In time, she retired from the adventuring life.
In her old age, Szuszalan settled in the Chauntean abbey-town of Goldenfields. She wrote her biography, Walking on a Swordblade, in the . In it, she reflected that it was the companionship and sense of having what was truly hers that she remembered most fondly.
She still lived as of 1372 DR, though at her age few recognized her or linked her to her past exploits.
She was both advisor and friend to Tolgar Anuvien, the cleric of Chauntea and leader of Goldenfields.
By 1357 DR, Szuszalan was elderly, and even considered a crone.
