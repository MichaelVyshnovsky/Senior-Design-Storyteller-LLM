'''Balismo Dey Canna''' was an adventurer in [[Maztica]].

==History==
Balismo was a noble of [[Calimport]] who, at the [[Amn]]ian court, decided to join the expedition to [[Maztica]]. However, arriving in [[Helmsport]], he was set to act as an overseer. Instead, he wanted to lead an expedition to find some gold and many times Balismo spoke to Lord [[Drakosa]] about this.

==Personality==
Balismo grew bored of the "new world" in [[Ulatos]] and dreamed of leading a great expedition that would make him rich. However, he was too cautious to act without official permission. Balismo claimed he had nothing against the [[Maztican]]s, provided they obeyed his orders.
