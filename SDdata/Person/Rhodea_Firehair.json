        "Personality": "Rhodea's personality matched her surname. Contrary to most [[wizard]]s, Rhodea was often seen at the front line of any battle or conflict, fearlessly leading those around her to victory. With a wide array of destructive spells, she was truly a force to be reckoned with.",
        "Activities": "Rhodea was the only Elder on the [[Council of Elders (Halruaa)]] who never missed a call to meeting from [[Zalathorm Kirkson]].\n\nShe took it upon herself to make sure the [[Royal Mint]] was run effectively and fairly.",
        "Relationships": "During the last few months of her life, Rhodea tutored a [[loxo]] named [[Dauphal]] who approached her because she was not afraid of him. She taught him the rudiments of [[the Art]], of which he was fascinated and awestruck.{{Cite web/Realms Personalities/Dauphal}}\n\nRhodea had a daughter that was killed a short while after Rhodea's passing.",
        "History": "Sometime in the early [[1370 DR|1370s DR]], Rhodea was killed at the town mint in an accident involving a [[dragon]]."
