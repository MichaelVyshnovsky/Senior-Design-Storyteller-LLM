        "mainbody": "Corauth Belark was a member of the Belark merchant family in Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR.\nCorauth was the middle son of Oldyle Belarks three sons and was quite the opposite of his staid older brother Hlonsker. Corauth was a bit wild and delighted in the pain and suffering of others.\n__NOTOC__\nCorauth and his little brother Aslyn were free to act almost with impunity around Delzimmer, getting into all sorts of trouble and gleefully terrorizing the common folk."
