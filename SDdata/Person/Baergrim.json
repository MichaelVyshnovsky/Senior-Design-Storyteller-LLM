        "Relationships": "Together with [[Eltragar]] and [[Mheriyam]], Baergrim was part of the Blades. He appeared to be familiar with [[Mhulker]], and had concerns that the latter may have been taken over by his \"guest\".",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|1372}}, Eltragar, Mheriyam, and Baergrim were escorting Mhulker in [[Undermountain]]. Mhulker was seeking a particular woman to eat her brain; he found her chained and gagged in an altar, but it turned out to be a trap, which Baergrim spotted by noticing that the woman's gag covered her nose too. After [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s trap slew Mhulker and the ancient wizard revealed himself, the mercenaries fled."
