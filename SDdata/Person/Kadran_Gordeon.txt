'''Kadran Gordeon''' was a lieutenant of [[House Basadoni]], the most powerful [[Thieves' guild]] in [[Calimport]] in [[1364]]. He was the leader of the guild's army and a good fighter. Kadran was insanely jealous of [[Artemis Entreri]], whom all considered the best fighter of Calimport, a title Kadran wanted for himself. When Entreri returned to the city and [[Basadoni]] offered him a place in the guild, Kadran thought his position was at risk and used all resources of the guild to kill Entreri. However, thanks to the intervention of [[Bregan D'aerthe]] Entreri survived, and in the end the assassin easily killed Kadran and gained control of the whole guild.
