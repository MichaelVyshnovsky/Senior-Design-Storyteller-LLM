Kadran Gordeon was a lieutenant of House Basadoni, the most powerful Thieves guild in Calimport in 1364. He was the leader of the guilds army and a good fighter. Kadran was insanely jealous of Artemis Entreri, whom all considered the best fighter of Calimport, a title Kadran wanted for himself. When Entreri returned to the city and Basadoni offered him a place in the guild, Kadran thought his position was at risk and used all resources of the guild to kill Entreri. However, thanks to the intervention of Bregan Daerthe Entreri survived, and in the end the assassin easily killed Kadran and gained control of the whole guild.
