'''Kamon''' was a short and stocky [[human]] mercenary who was killed in a fight with [[Abdel Adrian]] in [[1368 DR]]. Kamon had previously worked with Abdel in [[1367 DR]], guarding a warehouse in [[Athkatla]]. Kamon had blue eyes and liked to wield two [[axe]]s simultaneously.

==Death==
In combat with Abdel Adrian in 1368 DR, Kamon had been dispossessed of one of his two axes, and swung low at Abdel with his other axe. Abdel dodged a blow from the [[halberd]] of [[Eagus]], which struck Kamon on the head, killing him.
