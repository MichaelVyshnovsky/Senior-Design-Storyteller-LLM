'''Clarshee Taraghe''' was the owner and operator of the [[Moonwyvern Inn]] on the [[Everlund Pass]] in [[Luruar]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite dragon/288/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Moonwyvern Inn|74}}

==Description==
By most common standards, Clarshee was not young&hellip; or pretty.

==Personality==
{{Fq|text=Cesspits of Waterdeep!|source=Oath heard from Clarshee Taraghe|width=220px}}
Clarshee was a curmudgeonly old woman who was fiercely independent and not afraid to get her hands dirty. She maintained an almost constant stream of mumbled complaints between occasional outbursts of colorful but resigned outrage. She was charitable toward those she liked and often gave aid, credit, shelter, or nursing care to people in desperate need. She believed in keeping everyone's secrets and avoided gossip or pontificating.

==Abilities==
Clarshee was a [[sorceress]] of moderate skill with good concentration and a thorough knowledge of her inn and its surroundings. She could run much faster than her appearance indicated.{{Cite dragon/288/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Moonwyvern Inn|76}}

==Possessions==
{{Fq|text=By the blasted blue danglepipe of Longjaws the dragon!|source=Oath heard from Clarshee Taraghe|width=250px}}
In addition to the Moonwyvern Inn, she owned a crossbow, a ''+2 [[dagger]]'', a ''+1 [[ring of protection]]'', three ''[[cure light wounds]] potions'', and two ''potions of [[cure critical wounds]]''. She could command a [[shield guardian]] that she kept hidden in a closet, and she had a chest of fourteen [[crawling claw]]s in the cellar that she could herd because they hated [[pickle]] juice.

==Relationships==
Clarshee was like a den mother to many of her regular patrons, regardless of which side of the law they were on at any given time. Most simply adored her and would leap to her defense or aid if she needed it. Her two [[athach]] assistants, [[Beelbraeth]] and [[Horokh]], were also fervently loyal to her.

==Rumors & Legends==
Under Clarshee Taraghe's care, the Moonwyvern Inn became somewhat less rowdy and lawless, which led some gossipmongers to speculate that she was a [[Harpers|Harper]]. While she agreed with many of the goals of that semi-secret organization, she was not a member or an agent.
