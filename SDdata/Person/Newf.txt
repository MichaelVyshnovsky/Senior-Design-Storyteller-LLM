'''Newf''' was a [[human]] pirate from the isle of [[Brynnlaw]] in the [[Sea of Swords]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Newf was a simple-looking man with brown hair and dressed red-hued commoner's garb.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Newf could be found drinking in the [[Vulgar Monkey]] dock-side tavern. Like so many fellow pirate customers of the rowdy establishment, Newf was an eager sea-shanty singer. ''[[I'se th' b'y that Builds the Boat]]'' was his favorite.
