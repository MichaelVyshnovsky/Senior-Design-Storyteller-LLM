All his employers had to sign a very wordy and complicated contract that guaranteed a term of service and specified the penalties to be incurred should the contract be broken in truth, he used the contacts to scare his subordinates.\nAn outcast noble of Waterdeep, he tried a career in adventuring until he discovered his true vocation restaurateur. Soon, Denver had opened a series of taverns all over the city, becoming very rich. In 1370 DR, he had to become the head cook of Traitor Picks, after the regular cook was fired and nobody wanted to stay in the position."
