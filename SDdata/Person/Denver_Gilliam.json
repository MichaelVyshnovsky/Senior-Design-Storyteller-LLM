        "mainbody": "'''Denver Gilliam''' was a businessman in [[Skullport]].",
        "Personality": "Denver liked written contracts. All his employers had to sign a very wordy and complicated contract that guaranteed a term of service and specified the penalties to be incurred should the contract be broken; in truth, he used the contacts to scare his subordinates.",
        "History": "An outcast noble of [[Waterdeep]], he tried a career in adventuring until he discovered his true vocation: restaurateur. Soon, Denver had opened a series of taverns all over the city, becoming very rich. In [[1370 DR]], he had to become the head cook of [[Traitor Picks]], after the regular cook was fired and nobody wanted to stay in the position."
