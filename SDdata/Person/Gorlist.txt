}}'''Gorlist''' was the son of [[Nisstyre]] and leader of a [[drow]] band pursuing [[Liriel Baenre]].

==Description==
Gorlist had short white hair and a [[dragon]] tattoo on his left cheek that glowed if a dragon was in the vicinity. The color of the glow indicated the color of the dragon.

==History==
In [[1361 DR]], Gorlist was present when his father, [[Nisstyre]], was killed by [[Liriel Baenre]]'s assault on the [[Dragon's Hoard]] headquarters in [[Skullport]]. He sought revenge on her for the death of his father. He hired the [[deathsinger]] [[Brindlor Zidorion]] and worked with the former [[Red Wizard]] [[Merdrith]] and the drow [[priestess]] [[Shakti Hunzrin]] to pursue Liriel, finally catching up with her in [[Rashemen]], where he was defeated by her and her allies.
