'''Odd Valros''' was a [[coffin]]maker from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Odd Valros's services were in high demand due to the [[Absolute]] Crisis. The coffin maker's specialty were deluxe [[hardwood]] coffins that, according to the crafter, were thrice as durable as other types of [[wood]]. Odd Valros's coffins were said to preserve the bodies for longer than the competitors' and protected the dearly departed from vermin such as [[rat]]s and [[maggot]]s. To promote the business, Odd Valros penned ''[[The Superior Durability of Hardwood]].''
