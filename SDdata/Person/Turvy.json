He was constantly blabbering and muttering darkly and his sister translated for him. They feared that someone would discover that they were novice wererats who couldnt easily control their instincts.\nTopsy and Turvy lived in Blingdenstone. Sometime in the late 1480s, they were infected with lycanthropy.\nNot much time later, during a trip to collect some mushrooms, he and his twin were captured by drow slavers of Velkynvelve."
