Sheikh Ali al-Sadid was the leader of the House of Thawr tribe in the High Desert of west Zakhara around 1367 DR.
Because of recent tragedies, Alis mood was dark, prompting him to experience strange visions.
Ali was old when he assumed leadership of the tribe and, as of 1367 DR, he had ruled the tribe for 80 years.
Ali experienced a vision of strong winds rising in the desert to envelop the soft civilized lands to the south, tearing the flesh from their unworthy inhabitants and leaving an open blanket of desolation for more worthy beings to move in. Ali appeared to take this vision to heart as he begun raiding the borderlands of the Pearl Cities.
With the help of hired adventurers, Ali ordered the tribe to scour the ruins in the region in search of something specific, though he would not share what that item was.
Sadly, during the last five years Ali lost his wife and four of his five children. His three youngest sons perished at the hands of raiders from Gana. Alia bint Ali was his only surviving child.
