        "mainbody": "'''Adoy''' was a [[wild mage]] hermit who lived in the [[Cloud Peaks|Cloud Peak mountains]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "He saw [[wild magic]] as an expression of chaos and believed it could not truly be controlled by its practitioners.",
        "Possessions": "Adoy was in the possession of a ''[[Adoy's belt|unique belt]]'' that protected him from accidentally transforming himself into a form he didn't so wish.",
        "Activities": "He chose to live far removed from settlements and civilization,",
        "Relationships": "While living in the mountains, Adoy was acquainted with [[Magreb]] and [[Rilsa]], two [[ranger]] who lived in a nearby cabin.\n\nHe acted as a mentor of sorts to the young wild mage [[Neera]]. He fulfilled this role both during their brief meeting in the Cloud Peaks, and the time following his death.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Adoy inadvertently attracted a tribe of [[goblin]]s to his hideout while making a pot of porridge. These goblins became convinced he was the [[goblinoid]] deity of cooperation [[Bargrivyek]], and began to worship him as such. A [[hobgoblin]] by the name of [[Rogdok]] took advantage of this situation by capturing Adoy, gaining power over the goblins and becoming their king.\n\nLater that year Adoy was rescued from imprisonment by Neera, who hoped to gain further understanding over her powers. Unfortunately her intervention attracted the attention of the [[Red Wizard]] [[Ekandor]],  who had been tracking her movements. After dealing with Ekandor, Adoy bid farewell to Neera and disappeared in a flash of magic.\n\nThe Order of the Eight Staves eventually caught up with Adoy, experimented upon him, and eventually tortured him to death. His consciousness became trapped in the [[Fugue Plane]], though it maintained communicate with Neera by some manner of telepathy. Neera traveled to a ''[[portal]]'' in the ruins of [[Kanaglym]] called the ''[[Fountain of Nepenthe]]'', to free Adoy's spirit. While he was eternally bound to the Fugue Plane, he did manage to offer Neera one final piece of advice: to remain vigilant and  watch out for others like her."
