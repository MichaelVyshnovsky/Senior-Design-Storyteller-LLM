        "mainbody": "'''Gulmarin Reldacap''' was a brilliant inventor and [[cleric]] of [[Gond]] in [[Essembra]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Gulmarin was very arrogant and stuffy old man, and he believed himself to be above ever being ousted from his position. He was also a pacifist and disliked change, especially from young people, an attitude that was rather strange for a Gondsman to have. He cared nothing about the complains he received, instead being totally focused on his projects.\n\nHe generally refused to aid anyone, save for the most dedicated of [[Gondar]]. He judged such people to be those who made large monetary contributions, were conservative, and that were respectful.",
        "Activities": "Gulmarin managed the [[House of Gond]] in Essembra with the aid of three lesser priests. Over the years while working there he made advancements cart suspension, [[candle mold]]s, and dry ingredient measurement that saw adoption elsewhere.\n\nGulmarin invented a wide array of items These inventions included, but were not limited to, the following: [[lock (item)|locks]] that required three [[key (item)|keys]] to open, [[oil lamp]]s that refueled themselves by taking in [[lamp oil]] from a reservoir when needed, box jigs that allowed for the cutting of boards and posts in the same way repeatedly, sliding metal lids for [[tin]] [[bucket]]s to keep out unwanted pests or water, and cage spits that allowed for greater ease in roasting small fowl over a fire.\n\nDue to his production of new inventions, he always managed to elude being removed from office whenever a Gondar envoy came to inspect him.",
        "Relationship": "Two of the temple's lesser priests, [[Oldbrin Stonelun]] and [[Targarth Snowul]], recognized Gulmarin's genius and were content to assist him with his inventions. But another, [[Caldeen]], resented his frictious attitude and neglect for his office Outside of the temple, his attitude garnered numerous complaints from the faithful and rumors increasingly spoke of Gulmarin possibly being removed one day because of these complaints."
