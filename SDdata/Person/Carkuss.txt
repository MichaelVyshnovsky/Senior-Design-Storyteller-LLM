Carkuss was a wandering human priest of Beshaba active in the late 15 century DR.
Carkuss was a favored soul of Beshaba, meaning that to simply cross paths with him could mean calamitous misfortune. He himself was also subject to this misfortune, and years of wandering in his goddesss service had left him pale, bloated, and ugly such that it was hard to even tell he was human.
The constant misery of living in Beshabas misfortune had left Carkuss fatalistically apathetic about his own safety, and he gladly welcomed death as a sweet release. He rarely looked at people when he spoke to them, and frustrated those unlucky enough to cross his path by speaking in rhymes and riddles.
While Carkuss himself had no special capabilities, Beshaba used him to grant good or bad luck to those who interacted with him. She was generous to those who could answer his riddles and did not harm him, but she would inflict the Curse of Beshaba on those who failed on either of these counts, as well as on those who were simply too nice or sycophantic toward her poor priest. Those afflicted by this curse experienced bad luck, occasionally bad enough to kill them, and could pass the curse on to others.
Carkuss wore no clothing, and had no possessions save for his holy symbol of Beshaba, a copper medallion adorned with antler designs.
In the late 15 century DR, Carkuss wandered the Sword Coast North, ensnaring unsuspecting passersby in his web of misfortune. In the , he crossed paths with a group of adventurers from Acquisitions Incorporated on the Triboar Trail.
