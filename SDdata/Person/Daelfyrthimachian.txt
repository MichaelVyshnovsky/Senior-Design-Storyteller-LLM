'''Daelfyrthimachian''', also known as '''The Jet-Boned Tyrant''', was a [[dracolich]] ruler who lived in or near [[Skelkor]], [[Laerakond]], in [[Abeir]], centuries before the [[Spellplague]].

==History==
Daelfyrthimachian raided constantly the lands of [[Tymanchebar]], raising back dead [[dragonborn]] to bolster his armies of [[undead]]. This constant raiding forced the dragonborn to change their funerary rites to protect their dead, eventually shaping how they revered their ancestors.
