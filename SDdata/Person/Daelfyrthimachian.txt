Daelfyrthimachian, also known as The Jet-Boned Tyrant, was a dracolich ruler who lived in or near Skelkor, Laerakond, in Abeir, centuries before the Spellplague.
Daelfyrthimachian raided constantly the lands of Tymanchebar, raising back dead dragonborn to bolster his armies of undead. This constant raiding forced the dragonborn to change their funerary rites to protect their dead, eventually shaping how they revered their ancestors.
