        "History": "He could be found by adventurers deep in the underground tunnels of the plains of Icewind Dale, looting the area for [[silver]] and rare [[gem]]s. Borenorak was once controlled by an [[aboleth]], and thus suffered from \"Aboleth disease\". This caused his skin to become marked by conspicuous veins."
