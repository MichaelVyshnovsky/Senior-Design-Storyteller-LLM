        "mainbody": "lgerkhan was a half-orc warrior living in Palischuk in Vaasa in the late 14 century DR.\nOlgerkhans features favored his orcish half, with wide eyes in a tusked face his lip twisted as a result of his huge, uneven canines and his thick forehead being adorned with a singular bushy brow over bloodshot eyes. His nose was flat and crooked and his face was marked by small and uneven patches of hair. Olgerkhan was not very tall, somewhere between 5.5 and 6 feet (1.7 to 1.8 meters). He appeared much larger though, for his limbs and chest were thick and strong.\nAlthough not overly smart, Olgerkhan was very polite, respectful, and protective of his love, Arrayan Faylin.\nOlgerkhan almost died defending Arrayan from being killed by Athrogate and Canthan Doolittle. He was saved by Artemis Entreri through the vampiric powers of Artemis dagger, consuming the life-force of Canthan and giving it to Olgerkhan."
