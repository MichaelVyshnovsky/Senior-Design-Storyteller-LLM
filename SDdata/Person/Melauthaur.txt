Melauthaur, also known as The Undying One, was the emperor of Melabrauth, the oldest draconic empire of Laerakond as of 1479 DR. He was said to be a unique type of dracolich, ancient beyond reckoning and incredibly powerful. When alive, he was a black dragon.
Melauthaur was no ordinary dracolich, and although his abilities were not known to most people, he was more powerful than normal dracoliches and had abilities no other dracolich could develop.
As of 1479 DR, Melauthaur was focused on ruling his lands and had no interest in the outside world. He left the day-to-day government to his "overdragons", dragon lords who he had elevated over their brethren. It was rumored that he bided his time creating all sorts of undead creatures. He also hired the services, usually through coercion, of necromancers of all kinds. 
When bored, he used his hirelings and other servants to spread rumors across all Laerakond of "treasures found in Melabrauth", to lure greedy explorers and adventurers into its jungles to serve as "fresh meat" for ongoing necromantic experimentations, or just to give some amusement to its dragon servants.
He was also interested in obtaining a powerful relic known as the Shadow of Ao, and he usually sent his dragon servants to search for it across Laerakond.
During the Wailing Years, Melauthaur had to endure a fierce dragonborn rebellion on his lands that nearly killed a quarter of the dragon population of Melabrauth. Melauthaur had to intervene, and using powerful magic he learned from the Dawn Titans, he was able to destroy Djerad Kusold and thwart the rebellion. Since then, he forbade his servants to have dragonborn slaves.
