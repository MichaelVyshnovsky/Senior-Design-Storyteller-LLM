Carnelian was one of the few self-aware ghosts who lived in Wandering Stones, and he had lived there for many decades, as of 1479 DR. Carnelian was a wise individual, thanks to the information he had learned from other spirits, including the spirit of the primordial Arambar itself. He was intrigued about this primordial, wondering what could be the event Arambar was awaiting so eagerly. Carnelian was also a good friend of the dragonborn shaman Olothon.
