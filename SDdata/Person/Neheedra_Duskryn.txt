'''Neheedra Duskryn''' was a [[drow]] turned [[medusa]] ally of [[Ogremoch's Bane]] in [[Blingdenstone]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
As a drow, she was full of greed and vanity and was obsessed with ''[[spell gem]]s'' for their power and beauty. She dreamed of one day ruling a drow settlement as queen and hoped Blingdenstone was the perfect location.

==History==
Neheedra was part of a contingent of [[House Duskryn]] that remained in Blingdenstone after the drow attack on the city in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. She wanted to collect as many ''spell gems'' as possible. Soon Neheedra engaged in dark rituals designed to secure her hold on power, but the magical pacts she made transformed her into a [[medusa]]. Enraged by her fate, Neheedra turned her servants to stone and descended into madness.

She wandered the ruins, petrifying any creature she encountered, until met the Ogremoch's Bane. She somehow made an alliance with it and from then on they worked in concert.

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], she may have been encountered by a party of adventurers who had been hired by some [[deep gnome]] factions after escaping from drow slavers of [[Velkynvelve]].
