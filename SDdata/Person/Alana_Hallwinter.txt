'''Alana Hallwinter''' was a resident of [[Phandalin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the adopted daughter of [[Sildar Hallwinter]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|15}}

==Description==
She was a capable miner who wore ribbons in her hair.

==Personality==
Alana was a smart but foolhardy girl. She was said to be obsessed with stories of fine ladies and was a fan of pretty things like ribbons and [[flowers]].

==Relationships==
She was close friends with a trio of [[dwarf|dwarves]] and fellow teenagers named [[Nedd Angelite]], [[Sasha Flint]], and [[Grace Hardstone]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|16}}

Her father, Sildar, was very protective of her and did not trust her to track or travel alone in the woods. Even so, he permitted her to travel unsupervised as far afield from Phandalin as [[Swallow Lake]] to swim with her friends.

==History==
When she was a teenager in the 1490s DR, she became concerned when her three dwarven friends&mdash;Nedd, Sasha, and Grace&mdash;disappeared into the [[Crooked Forest]] while seeking proof of some of the things they had read about in the newly-published ''[[Volo's Guide to Monsters (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to Monsters]]''.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|17}} She decided to go look for them, but did not tell her father. Instead, she told him that she was meeting with her friends to go swimming, and left a note explaining her true intentions for him to find later. When he discovered it, he feared that the teens' disappearance could start a panic, and so he concealed the information from the townsfolk and from his fellow members of the [[Town Council of Phandalin]]. Feeling like he was unable to go after her without alerting the town to the disappearances, he instead sought out [[adventurer]]s and offered to reward them not only for finding his daughter, but for their discretion.

Meanwhile, Alana had met with the same fate as her friends in the Crooked Forest: she was captured by [[gnoll]]s, who blindfolded her and took her to their camp. Although bleeding and terrified, Alana managed to remove her blindfold and sneakily leave a trail for any rescuers to follow by tying ten of her ribbons onto branches as her captors carried her deeper into the forest and higher into the trees. During this episode, she caught a glimpse of [[Gavmogon]], although did not realize what it was.
