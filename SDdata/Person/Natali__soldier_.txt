'''Natali''' was a soldier stationed at the [[Damaran Gate]] of [[Bloodstone Pass]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/The Rite||prologue}}

==Description==
She was a slender redhead with a sunburned neck.

==History==
She was the first victim of the traitor [[Fodel]], an infiltrator of the Damaran Gate for the [[Cult of the Dragon]], on the night of [[Mirtul 2]] in the {{yearlinkName|1373}}. After she spotted a [[flight of dragons]] approaching, she was about to signal with her [[bugle]], but Fodel quickly slew her. Her blood and gore on his chest would later serve as a warning for a local [[paladin]].
