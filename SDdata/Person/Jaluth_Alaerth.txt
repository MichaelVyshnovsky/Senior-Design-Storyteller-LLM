'''Jaluth Alaerth''', known as '''"Snakeface"''', was one of the Overwizards of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] in the 1360s [[DR]].

==Activities==
''Circa'' [[1365 DR]], Jaluth was developing new necromantic [[spell]]s in order to gain control of [[undead]], [[golem]]s, and [[gargoyle]]s. She plotted to gain control over all [[dragon]]s, conquer [[Icewind Dale]], take possession of as many mines as possible, and also sack [[dwarven]] holdings and [[Netheril]]'s ruins.

==History==
In [[1371 DR]], after [[Eldeluc]] and [[Valkebar]]'s coup against the Archmage Arcane, [[Arklem Greeth]], Jaluth pledged her loyalty to the conspirators. When Greeth returned, now transformed into a [[lich]] with some new [[devil]]ish allies, Jaluth relocated to near Icewind Dale. 

==Powers==
Jaluth had a strange power or curse that caused her face to spill snakes every time that she was angry or upset.
