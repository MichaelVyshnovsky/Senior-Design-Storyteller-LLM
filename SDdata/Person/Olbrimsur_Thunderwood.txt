Olbrimsur Thunderwood was a shopkeeper in Berdusk in 1367 DR.
Olbrimsur once led the Stormriders adventuring band fighting many monsters and Zhentarim in the Sunset Mountains. However, a Red Wizard of Thay killed all Olbrimsurs companions.
While living in Berdusk he was known to often lead independent adventurers on expeditions to kill nearby giants, goblinkin, and other creatures considered monsters.
Olbrimsur managed the Thunderwood Forays outfitting shop. He knew the Far Hills like the corners of his own shop. He sponsored some adventurers to explore the Far Hills as scouts.
Some said that Olbrimsur knew about a buried city in the Far Hills and he sent adventurers there to find a way to its treasures.
Olbrimsur was a Harper ally.
