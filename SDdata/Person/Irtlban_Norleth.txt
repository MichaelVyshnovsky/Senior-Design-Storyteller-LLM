High Priest '''Irtlban Norleth''' was the ranking priest of the [[Tower of Riches]], a temple dedicated to [[Waukeen]], in [[Ordulin]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}.

==Activities==
Irtlban was nearly driven insane with the disappearance of his goddess during the [[Time of Troubles]]. Many of his fellow clergymen vacated the temple, leaving only seven behind to help him with the temple duties.
