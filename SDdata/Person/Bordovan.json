        "mainbody": "ordovan was one of the four bartenders who also worked as bouncers of the Copper Coronet in the River District of Athkatla, in the late 14 century DR.\nBordovan was built like a wall of muscles. He was a balding man wearing a number of jingling earrings who worked wearing his breastplate, greaves, and armored codpiece. Judging by his posturing and physique, Bordovan was a steeled warrior. When at the Coronet, Bordovan showed little friendliness to the taverns customers, keeping stoic professional attitude.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Bordovan was an established member of the Copper Coronets staff. He, along with Vaermaer, Delric, and Othlo, was supervised by Old Sarvo Droostan, the Coronets tavernmaster. Bordovan worked in full armor and was proficient in stopping trouble, fighting off rowdy drunkards, spotting drunk spell-casting, and faked intoxication. Bordovan and the rest of the mountainous bouncer-bartenders kept large rocks behind the bar. These rocks were used as projectiles, thrown around with immaculate precision at drunken troublemakers. Bordovans attitude changed to that of a glacier when an obviously rich visitor entered the Coronet or one of Athkatlas officials arrived. Bordovan and his fellow bartenders did not tolerate patrons harassing the Copper Coronets female employees."
