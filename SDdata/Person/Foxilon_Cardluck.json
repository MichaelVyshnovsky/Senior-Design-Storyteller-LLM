        "History": "Foxy was born in [[Luiren]] but soon left in search of adventures with some [[halfling]] companions. However, Foxy and his fellows were tricked by [[Joribel]] into becoming addicted to a narcotic substance known as [[cheeeese]]. So they became Joribel's pawnsâ€”stealing, raiding and even killing for a piece of cheeeese. However, when a bully took Foxy's cheeeese, Foxy briefly regained lucidity, managing to escape together with a halfling girl.\n\nIn their escape, they met [[Dwalimar Omen]] and [[Minder]]. Foxy explained his situation and Omen destroyed Joribel. Afterward the [[wizard]] trained Foxy in stealing magical items. When Omen launched the ''Realms Master'', Foxy became his first mate.",
        "Personality": "Foxy was a buoyant and charming individual. He was protective of his crew members and considered it his mission to keep their spirits up. Foxy was friendly and liked almost all people but was not naive. Sometimes he still felt a craving for cheeeese but resisted the temptation."
