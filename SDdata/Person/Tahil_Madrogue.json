        "mainbody": "'''Tahil Madrogue''' was an adventuring [[thief]] of questionable prowess, active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "By the age of twenty, Tahil learned to be a competent and fearless rogue. However, his career was stifled by his lack of finesse with the tongue of the trade – [[thieves' cant]]. Tahil could never remember differences between such words as \"box-man,\" \"made-guy,\" \"mark,\" \"pennyweighter,\" \"rounder,\" nor \"tipster.\" When talking with fellow thieves, he often found himself with his foot in the mouth. His inability to communicate well in thieves' cant landed more fellow rogues in prison than the city guard ever could. Tahil also could not get a membership with any of the many [[Faerûn]]ean [[thieves' guild]]s as he once unintentionally gravely insulted one of these organizations. To make amends for the insult, Tahil Madrogue was offered to pay astronomical guild dues for joining – something he could not afford.\n\nSometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, Tahil Madrogue was among the ambitious fortune seekers who were interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally mysterious magical ''orb'' from its depths."
