Keeper of the Key was a cursed sohei in Ito-jo in 1360 DR.
The Keeper was a retainer of Ito family who died in the castles burning in 647 DR. Thanks to an ancient curse and a krakentuas influence, he did not truly die and instead lingered to haunt the castle as seventh of the seven weapon masters of the castle. Finally, in 1360 DR, an adventuring party hired by Michimori Uemon to recover the Seven Swords fought and destroyed him.
