'''Keeper of the Key''' was a cursed [[sohei]] in [[Ito-jo]] in [[1360 DR]].

==History==
The Keeper was a retainer of [[Ito family]] who died in the castle's burning in [[647 DR]]. Thanks to an ''[[ancient curse]]'' and a [[Krakentua (Ito-jo)|krakentua]]'s influence, he did not truly die and instead lingered to haunt the castle as seventh of the seven weapon masters of the castle. Finally, in 1360 DR, an adventuring party hired by [[Michimori Uemon]] to recover the [[Seven Swords]] fought and destroyed him.
