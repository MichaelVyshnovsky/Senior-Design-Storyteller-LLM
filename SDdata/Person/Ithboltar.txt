'''Ithboltar''' was a male [[wizard]] who was the leader of the [[magelord]]s of [[Athalantar]] and was killed in [[Elminster Aumar]]'s insurrection.

==History==
Ithboltar was a powerful member of the magelords from the start of their power, most of the magelords began as apprentices of him: first [[Neldryn Hawklyn]], later [[Kadeln Olothstar]] and [[Seldinor Stormcloak]]. Thus Ithboltar was the closest to a leader of the magelords as possible.

However, when [[Elminster Aumar]] began his insurrection, his students appeared too disunited to fight together against the rebels. In the end, Elminster with a powerful spell destroyed Ithboltar and the few remaining magelords agreed to fight together.
