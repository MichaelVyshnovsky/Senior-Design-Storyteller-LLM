Ithboltar was a male wizard who was the leader of the magelords of Athalantar and was killed in Elminster Aumars insurrection.
Ithboltar was a powerful member of the magelords from the start of their power, most of the magelords began as apprentices of him first Neldryn Hawklyn, later Kadeln Olothstar and Seldinor Stormcloak. Thus Ithboltar was the closest to a leader of the magelords as possible.
However, when Elminster Aumar began his insurrection, his students appeared too disunited to fight together against the rebels. In the end, Elminster with a powerful spell destroyed Ithboltar and the few remaining magelords agreed to fight together.
