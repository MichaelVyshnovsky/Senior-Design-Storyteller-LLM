'''Braethan Cazondur''' was a [[Lords of Waterdeep|Lord of Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He spoke slowly and methodically, but he had a quick mind. An utterly ruthless and ambitious man, it was said that Cazondur murdered his father to inherit his business. He was quite intelligent and charismatic, being able to bend others to his will with inspiring words and hatch elaborate plots with many moving parts. As a result of this, he needed little incentive to kill, murdering many nobles and guildmasters who risked interfering in his plans without hesitation.

==Possessions==
Braethan Cazondur complemented his lack of [[magic]]al ability with a large collection of [[magic item]]s. He possessed a suit of ''[[armor of resistance]]'' and many magical [[ring]]s, including several [[ring of mind shielding|''rings of mind shielding'']], which he used during his plot to assassinate the [[Masked Lord|Masked Lords]]. He communicated with the [[wizard]] Glenmaur using a ''[[stone of far speaking]]''. He also owned a ''[[staff of the magi]]'', although Belvarra and Suthool replaced it with a non-magical duplicate.

==Activities==
Cazondur was a very wealthy Waterdhavian investor, although he also engaged in sinister plots to further his own ambitions. He often hired [[adventurer]]s to carry out his less-scrupulous work for him. He planned to discreetly increase his own influence by assassinating Masked Lords in order to fill their vacant positions with his supporters, but after he killed [[Laeral Silverhand]] he tried to seize control of the city directly. His plot was foiled, however, when Laeral returned in the body of [[Elminster]].

==Relationships==
Cazondur was aided in his plan by a worshiper of [[Asmodeus]] named [[Belvarra Bowmantle]] and a [[mind flayer]] named [[Suthool]], although they later turned on him on the Xanathar's orders.

* The [[Zushaxx|Xanathar]] supported Cazondur's scheme in order to distract the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|Watch]] and the [[Lords of Waterdeep#Open Lord|Open Lords]] from his operation in [[Skullport]] and to gain power in order to expel the [[Zhentarim]] from Waterdeep, although he eventually decided Cazondur had gone too far and ordered Bowmantle and Suthool to kill him.

Cazondur hired an elite member of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]] named [[Glenmaur]] to provide him with magical aid in his schemes, including using a ''[[teleportation circle]]'' and conjuring an ''[[illusory dragon]]''. Glenmaur also helped him kill Laeral Silverhand. He hired another Watchful Order mage named [[Qasmult]] to kill Glenmaur, although both wizards were imprisoned in ''[[forcecage]]s'' and arrested.

Under the guise of Antler, Cazondur hired a young Waterdhavian noblewoman named [[Tasheene Melshimber]] to kill Masked Lords on his behalf. Tasheene enlisted the help of another noble named [[Zaraela]], a Guildmaster named [[Roysark Cuthbarrel]], and her lover, [[Darleth Drake]].

Cazondur often employed a thug from [[Dock Ward]] named [[Shrikegulk]] to do his dirty work for him, although he eventually had him murdered.

==History==
In [[Mirtul]] of [[1491 DR]], Cazondur instigated the murders of several Masked Lords of Waterdeep.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was said that Cazondur killed his own father to inherit his business.
