        "mainbody": "'''Krag Foultooth''' was the brutal leader of a group of [[gnoll]]s that allied with the [[Blackdagger Bandits]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the Blackdaggers broke their deal with [[Angelhead Mine]] owner [[Melkhor Goldseeker]], believing they could find treasure in the mine. Krag Foultooth and his bandits assaulted Angelhead, imprisoned and enslaved the miners, and took Melkhor's niece and the forewoman [[Mira Thamros]] hostage to ensure his silence and cooperation. He was visited there by fellow bandit leader [[Jareth Grim]]. Finally, Foultooth was killed by an [[adventurer]] sent by [[Yates]] to Angelhead Mine to free Mira and the other miners."
