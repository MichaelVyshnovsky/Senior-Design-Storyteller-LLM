'''Timber''' was a [[squirrel]] that lived on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

Timber was very protective of the land she claimed as its territory, the breadth of the [[Emerald Grove]]. While she was brave in the face of invaders, Timber would at times negotiate passage across her lands.
