        "mainbody": "rgathakul was a red dragon who laired on Harvestshield Mountain as of the 15 century DR.\nHe was relatively young in dragon terms as of the late 15 century DR, but would display the cruelty of a dragon twice his age. He was prone to wander away from his territory, yet was willing to go to great lengths to defend that territory. However, he was not above fleeing a battle to save himself.\nArgathakul laid claim to Harvestshield Mountain, but generally stayed out of sight unless he believed that his authority was being questioned. His lair sat at the summit of the mountain, and from it seeped sulfuric runoff that poisoned much of the water and plants of the mountain.\nArgathakul famously wreaked havoc on the Harvestsheild Mountain region sometime between the late 8 and early 15 century DR, thus ending its long years of agricultural prosperity.Warriors of Waterdeep is set in the late 15 century DR during Laeral Silverhands tenure as Open Lord of Waterdeep, and Laeral states that \"Few are still alive who remember how cruelly Argathakul despoiled Harvestshield Mountain, but I do.\" Laeral was born in , giving the stated range from the late 8 to early 15 century DR. Laeral subsequently describes Argathakul as \"young for a dragon\", which might suggest a more recent date within this range. He then reemerged in the late 15 century DR after Mrolgyets Legion had claimed Chaunteas Citadel atop the mountain, and inserted himself into the middle of a battle between the Legion and the Lords Alliance in order to assert his claim over the mountain. He was driven off by a group of adventurers in the service of Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep."
