        "mainbody": "'''Dalyria''' was a [[vampire spawn]] and one of the favorite \"children\" of the [[vampire lord]] [[Cazador Szarr]], who resided in the [[Szarr Palace]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Spawn or no, I'm still Doctor Dalyria, and I will not submit to this lowly status. The others say vampirism is a curse, but in my educated opinion, it's a disease, and therefore must be vulnerable to medical treatment.''|Excerpt from Dalyria's diary}}",
        "Description": "Dalyria was a pale-skinned [[elf]] woman with silver hair and eyes glowing with evil. Like her \"siblings,\" Dalyria's back was carved with a circle of scars that formed a sigil written in [[Abyssal]]—a part of Cazador's ritual centuries in the making.",
        "History": "Before being afflicted with [[vampirism]], Dalyria was a well-respected doctor, the Physician General to the [[Parliament of Peers|Parliament]] of Baldur's Gate. When she was turned into an [[undead]] vampire spawn, Dalyria became one of the favorite \"children\" of the vampire lord and a \"sibling\" of [[Astarion Ancunín]], the lucky vampire who escaped Cazador's influence and joined the [[Absolute Adversaries]].\n\nDespite being thrall to her master, Dalyria refused to submit to her misery and became convinced that vampirism was just a [[disease]] to be cured. The spawn developed a theory that the cure was hidden in a great amount of blood from a young and strong individual, one strong enough to overwhelm vampirism. She targeted the \"pureblooded\" daughter of her vampire spawn \"sibling,\" [[Leon Onufrio]]. [[Victoria Onufrio]], still just a child, was  among the inhabitants of the palace, who was able to escape with her father's help, but Dalyria snatched the child back to the Szarr Palace. Unbeknownst to Dalyria, Victoria had a powerful [[curse]] placed on her by her father as protection. When Dalyria attempted to drain the child, the curse activated. Dalyria was found puking the cursed blood when Cazador discovered her plan and dragged her away to be punished.\n\nLike her siblings, the purpose of Dalyria's existence was a powerful ritual to be performed by Cazador Szarr in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. As a result, the vampire spawns were to be destroyed, and their power would transform Cazador into a vampire ascendant. It was unknown if the ritual was successful and Dalyria was destroyed, or if the ritual never was completed, leaving Dalyria freed from her dark master, or if she was slain in the process."
