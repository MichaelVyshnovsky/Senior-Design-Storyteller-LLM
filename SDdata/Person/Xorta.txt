Xorta was a young stone giant in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Circa 1483 DR, Halaster Blackcloak lured Xortas family inside Maddgoths Castle and cursed them to remember nothing of their past lives and even anything that had happened over eight hours previously.
In 1492 DR, Xorta dreamed of exploring more of the dungeon. She also tried to learn to play the flute, despite often forgotting her lessons.
Xorta had the soul of an explorer but couldnt abandon her family and her parents wouldnt let her stray far.
