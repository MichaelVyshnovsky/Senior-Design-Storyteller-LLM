        "mainbody": "'''Homer Bubbins''', better known as the '''Bad Twin Bubbins''', was a [[halfling]] member of [[The Guild]] from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''You won't catch me looting all that shiny Zhent armour. I'd rather go into battle bare-arsed.''|Homer Bubbins}}",
        "History": "Homer Bubbins was born in the town of [[Beregost]] in [[West Faerûn]]. At some point, Homer Bubbins pursued a religious career in the [[Open Hand Temple]] of [[Ilmater]] in Baldur's Gate. Or, at least, that was what [[Mama Bubbins]] believed. Homer wrote letters home, continuing the charade, claiming to serve and live happily under Father [[Lorgan]] and even claiming to have reached the title of the \"right-hand temple manager.\" In reality, the man known as the \"Bad Twin Bubbins\" joined the infamous Guild.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Homer's twin brother, [[Flymber Bubbins]], became inspired by his brother's lies and decided to move to Baldur's Gate and join the Open Hand Temple, as reported by Mama Bubbins in a birthday letter to her prodigal son.\n\nHomer Bubbins was present at The Guild's Guildhall in Baldur's Gate's [[Undercellar]] during the [[Absolute crisis]] of 1492 DR and an attempt by the [[Zhentarim]] to seize control of the weakened criminal cartel. However, Bad Twin Bubbins's survival past the tumult of these two conflicts remains unconfirmed."
