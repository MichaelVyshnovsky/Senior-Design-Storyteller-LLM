Caleb was a male human bandit of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR.
Caleb was one of the local Docks thugs, who was acting under Moires employ. He did not respect the Watch, at all.
If the Kalach-Cha and the compaions sided with the Watch, after helping Hagen defeat the thieves they would have to visit Caleb. Caleb refused to be arrested, so he and his thugs attacked them.
If the Kalach-Cha and the companions sided with the thieves, Caleb would ask them to threaten Hagen. After returning to Caleb, Hagen would come back with the guards and attack. Once they were defeated, Caleb would advise the Kalach-Cha to speak with Moire.
