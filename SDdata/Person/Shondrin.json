        "mainbody": "'''Shondrin''' was a retired sailor of the [[Sword Coast]] and the proprietor of [[Shondrin's Packsack of Plenty]] in the settlement of [[Bargewright Inn]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He was a fat and jovial fellow, and full of wild stories from his seafaring days.",
        "Activities": "From \"the Pack\", Shondrin sold all sorts of things, including dry goods and an assortment of practical supplies, like [[candle]]s, [[rope]], and outerwear clothing. Shondrin occasionally accepted items in trade, which he sold in the store. Hence, it included some secondhand items such as hardware and old armor and weaponry and even [[magical item]]s, though Shondrin rarely dealt in them knowingly. If Shondrin didn't have what a customer wanted in stock, he could tell them the nearest place they could find it, which might be as far as [[Waterdeep]], [[Athkatla]], or even [[Calimport]]. While this wasn't always helpful, it was a point of pride to Shondrin that he had complete, up-to-date knowledge of all legal, open-market vendors.\n\nHis house stood at the very center of the settlement, between the Rise and the Back streets and next door to [[Rinthar]]'s house.<ref><ref>"
