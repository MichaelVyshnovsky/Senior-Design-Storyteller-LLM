Thrakkus was a red dragonborn butcher in Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
Thrakkus came off as stern and serious, not taking kindly to those whom he saw as "fools" or those that wasted his time.
Thrakkus, being a red dragonborn, could breath a cone of fire up to  and was resistant to fire.
Thrakkus worked as a butcher in Waterdeeps Field Ward, having converted a burned-down windmill into his butcher shop. However, his true activities involved butchering humanoid corpses delivered to him by the Zhentarim for disposal, and selling the meat.
The dragonborn allowed squatters to reside in his home and business, provided they helped in other tasks or are not disruptive.
