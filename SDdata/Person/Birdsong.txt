'''Birdsong''' was a [[tabaxi]] [[bard]] who lived in [[Chult]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She worked at varying times as a [[minstrel]], a [[merchant]], and an [[adventurer]].

==Description==
She had brown fur with dark brown markings, and yellow eyes. Birdsong wore [[leather armor]] over a blue [[tunic]] and green [[trousers]].

==Personality==
Birdsong was a cunning tabaxi woman who harbored great aspirations. She was a talented and inspiring player of the [[lute]].

==Relationships==
{{Fq

| source = Birdsong, speaking of Vanessa
}}
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, she was in a romantic relationship with [[Vanessa]], a [[templar]] of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] stationed at [[Camp Vengeance]]. Because such templars were not permitted to mingle with the civilian locals, they kept their relationship a secret. Evens so, Birdsong had composed and performed songs about their love in [[Port Nyanzaru]].

==Possessions==
Birdsong was heavily armed, carrying both a [[short sword]] and a larger blade, in addition to her lutes. She owned several of the musical instruments including a ''[[Doss lute]]'', a lavish [[gold]]-inlaid lute that could be heard over great distances, a magical ''[[masterwork lute of rest]]'', an the enchanted ''[[Singing Wind]]''. Among short swords she owned were: a simple iron shortsword, a lighter and sharper steel shortsword, a magical ''[[singing sword]]'', an enchanted ''[[sword of sharpness]]'', and a legendary blade the ''[[Fang (sword)|Fang]]'' said to be made out of [[Shagambi]]'s tooth.

==History==
When she was very young, Birdsong's village was destroyed and enslaved by [[yuan-ti]]. Although she grew up as a [[slave]], Birdsong quickly discovered she had a talent for the bardic arts. Playing her lute, Birdsong's music had a profound effect on her fellow slaves. After escaping the yuan-ti slavers, Birdsong vowed to one day get revenge. She became known as one of the greatest minstrels in all of Chult.

During the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} Birdsong allied herself with the likes of the jungle guide [[Eku]], the adventurers [[Artus Cimber]] and [[Dragonbait]], the [[aarakocra]] elder [[Asharra]], and the [[druid]] [[Qawasha]] to help investigate and stop the curse.

On or just before the [[Alturiak 14|14th of Alturiak]] that followed the appearance of the death curse, Birdsong was traveling with a merchant caravan from Port Nyanzaru to Camp Vengeance when they were attacked by a [[flesh golem]]. The survivors were rescued by an old woman named [[Nanny Pu'pu]] and given shelter at her home in [[Mbala]], only for it to be revealed that the old woman was in fact a [[green hag]]. The merchants were all killed with the exception of Birdsong, who was kept as a prisoner to entertain the hag before she was rescued by adventurers sent to look for her by a concerned Vanessa.
