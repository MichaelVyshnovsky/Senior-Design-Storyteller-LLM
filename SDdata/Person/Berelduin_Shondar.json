        "mainbody": "Berelduin Shondar, nicknamed Bereld the Just, was a human cleric of Helm in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nBy 1358 DR and through 1367 DR, he was the High Watcher of the Helms Shieldhall temple in Elturel, ruling over twenty-one priests and eighty-five followers.\nHe also led patrols of the Hellriders, as many as the High Rider Lord Dhelt did.\nPatriarchal and stern, Berelduin ran the temple with an iron hand. He was belligerent and aggressive in defense of the Helmite faith."
