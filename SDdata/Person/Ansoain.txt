'''Ansoain''' was a traveling [[mage]] that lived and worked her craft throughout the [[Western Heartlands]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She ventured from one town to another with her son [[Galimer]] and her young apprentice [[Druhallen]] of [[Sunderath]], educating them in the the [[arcane arts]] along the way.

==Personality==
Ansoain was a restless woman that took numerous lovers, and could never spend more than a few days at a single location. While she did maintain a well-kept library of books at her home in [[Scornubel]], Ansoain hardly needed to refer to its contents, as she possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of not-always-useful bits of arcane lore and spellcasting particulars.

She had a particular concern about [[demon]]s and ensured she and her boys were well-educated about their kind. 

==Possessions==
In addition to her extensive collection of books, Ansoain had a collection of [[magic]]al [[ring]]s.

==Activities==
At some point in her life Ansoain had formed some manner of relationship with the Dark Lord [[Sememmon]] of [[Darkhold]] and became associated with the western branch of the [[Zhentarim]]. They had given her the name ''Bitter Ansoain'', presumably referring to her behavior after having too much drink. 

Because of her history with the Black Network, Ansoain taught her son and apprentice to exercise great caution when dealing with their people. She always assumed they knew everything about the goings on of their lives. 

==Relationships==
Ansoain had two sons by birth, the handsome and charming Galimer, who followed in her spellcasting footsteps; and the younger, much more mischievous [[Tiep]], who was born a not long before her untimely death. Ansoain had also taken on the young wood-worker Druhallen as an apprentice, after witnessing the talents he possessed for magecraft. As she offered Dru the benefits of her experience and wisdom over the course of his young life, Ansoain became a foster mother of sorts to the young spellcaster from [[Sunderath]].

==History==
In or around [[Flamerule]] of the {{YearlinkName|1353}}, Ansoain, Galimer, and Druhallen took on a job accompanying a bride-groom and her caravan through the [[Vilhon Reach]] towards [[Hlondeth]], the City of Serpents. As they were deep in discussion about [[material component|magical reagents]], Ansoain was killed in the attack. Her body was rent to pieces and could only be identified by her scattered possessions and shredded clothing.

Druhallen and Galimer recovered a mysterious, ''[[Netherese glass disk]]'' from the magic-scorched battlefield, and investigated its origins at [[Candlekeep]], in an attempt to identify Ansoain's killers and find some greater meaning behind her death.
