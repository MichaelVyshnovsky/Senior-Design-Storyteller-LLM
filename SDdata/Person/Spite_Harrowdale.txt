Spite Harrowdale was a thousand-year-old archmage who posed as a 12-year-old apprentice mage in the magical academy of Dweomercore during the 15 century DR.
Spite was extremely intelligent he was fluent in a number of languages and possessed great talent as a practitioner of the Art.
He appeared as a young Rashemi boy who demonstrated typical magical skill for someone that age. He owed his youthful appearance to regular imbibing of potions of longevity.
Spite viewed the "Mad Mage" Halaster Blackcloak as a superior magical power and wanted to learn as much as he could from the similarly ancient wizard. He viewed his time in Undermountain as a grand adventure.
While enrolled in Dweomercore, Spite came to realize that the headmaster of the academy was not actually Halaster Blackcloak, but rather an arcanaloth assuming his form. Spite maintained a similar deception, demonstrating competence in only the most basic spells to maintain his ruse of being a pre-adolescent magic student. Unlike Spites classmates, the arcanaloth saw through the archmages deceit as well and kept a close eye on his activities.
While he was enrolled within the academy, in the late 15 century DR, Spite sought to steal Halaster Blackcloaks personal spellbook.
The archmage was accompanied by an oni mage named Kumar who, like Spite, altered their appearance to that of a half-orc woman named "Dumara".
Within his personal dormitory, Spite kept the two volumes of his spellbooks, the Spells of Spite. They were hidden within a Leomunds secret chest, in a room protected by a glyph of warding.
Before he joined the academy of Dweomercore, during the 14 century DR. Spite lived in Undermountain within the realm of Wyllowwood.
He and Kumar made their home within a set of ruins nestled into an isle in the middle of the River of the Depths. In addition to his room, he had a small laboratory and holding cells that housed the subjects of his arcane experimentation.
