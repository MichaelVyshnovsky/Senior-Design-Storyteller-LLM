        "mainbody": "Kressa Bonedaughter, who held the title Mistress of Souls, was a devotee of Myrkul, and key member of the cult of the Absolute, who dwelled within Moonrise Towers during the late 15 century DR.\nShe was wholly devoted to the cult of the Absolute and took great pleasure in her role as its chief vivisectionist.\nShe wielded an enchanted flail known as a Myrkulite scourge.\nKressa engrossed herself in the work of torture and pseudo-medical experimentation. She became quite knowledgeable about the process of ceremorphosis and the processes required to inflict it upon other mortals, absent an actual mind flayer.\nShe was one of the few attendees of Moonrise Towers who was granted permission to conduct business in the illithid colony situated beneath its foundation.\nKressa followed the direct orders of General Ketheric Thorm, chosen of Myrkul and one of the three co-conspirators of the Absolute crisis.\nShe was married to a fellow cultist Myrkulite mage by the name of Maghtew. She worked alongside the halfling cutlist Ironfinger and bugbear enforcer Hairy Henry.\nKressa found the Bhaalspawn known as the Dark Urge shortly after he was attacked by his subordinate Orin and infected with a mind flayer tadpole."
