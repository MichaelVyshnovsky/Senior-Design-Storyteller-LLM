Lathtolt was a long-lived mage of Tashluta and the record-holder for the most attempts at becoming the Magister by the late 14 century DR.
His defensive spells were excellent, though he relied on them overmuch while dueling. He was also able to brew a potion of longevity or a magical bath of his own devising that accomplished a similar effect.
He was over 800 years old, and had challenged the Magister a total of 42 times in that time, as of .
