Mithykyl was an illithid who was under command of the Bhaalspawn Sendai circa 1368 DR.
When Gorions Ward was close to reaching Sendais inner chamber of her enclave, Mithykyl was appointed as the last bastion of defense. He was in charge of several ulitharids, vampiric illithids, and elder umber hulks. In the end, Mithykyl and his minions fell, and the ward gained access to Sendai.
