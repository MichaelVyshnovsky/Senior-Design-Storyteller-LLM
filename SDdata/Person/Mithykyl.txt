'''Mithykyl''' was an [[illithid]] who was under command of the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Sendai]] ''circa'' [[1368 DR]].

==History==
When [[Gorion's Ward]] was close to reaching Sendai's inner chamber of her enclave, Mithykyl was appointed as the last bastion of defense. He was in charge of several [[ulitharid]]s, [[vampiric illithid]]s, and elder [[umber hulk]]s. In the end, Mithykyl and his minions fell, and the ward gained access to Sendai.
