High Artificer '''Danactar''', Most Holy Servant of [[Gond]], was the highest-ranking mortal priest of the Wonderbringer ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Danactar led the [[High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration]] monastery in the city of [[Illul]] in [[Lantan]]. Moreover, the High Artificer was the supreme voice in ecclesiastical matters for the [[church of Gond]] in [[Faer√ªn]]. However, in practice, while his word was deeply respected in Lantan itself and among Lantanese expatriates and merchants, Gondar further afield only nominally acknowledged it.

In addition, by [[1372 DR]], Danactar was a leading member in Lantan's ruling council, the [[Ayrorch]].It is unclear if Danactar is the leader of the council, the Ayrar, or merely a very influential regular member, a Santar. Morever, since Danactar was not listed as a member of the Ayrorch in the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]'', it is clear Danactar joined after [[1356 DR|1356]]/[[1357 DR]].
