'''Nivlin Goskull''' was an assistant in the cookhouse of the [[Whistling Wizard]] inn located in [[Voonlar]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|31}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 26: Why Stay at the Wizard?}}

==Personality==
Nivlin was a prankster and was known to leave the severed heads of animals on a pillow in some guests' rooms. He stopped this particular practice after he was caught and beaten severely.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|31-32}}

==Activities==
Nivlin was one of three kitchen drudges that fetched firewood, tended fires, stirred pots, and helped peel, clean, and chop vegetables for the soup. The all-male kitchen staff worked in hot and humid conditions generated by the many fires and bubbling cauldrons, so they wore very little clothing as they sweated and toiled. This made for a very acrimonious atmosphere in the cookhouse as he and his coworkers grudgingly took shouted orders from the two old [[dwarven]] cooks, [[Bezoldur Thornhand]] and [[Thaunder Gallowglaive]]. The drudges returned in kind but somehow the food got prepared. The four serving girls were not given any mercy either and spent as little time as possible picking up orders and then scurrying away to deliver them.
