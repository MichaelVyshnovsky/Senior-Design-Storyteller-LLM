        "Personality": "Soluun was a fanatical bully totally loyal to Bregan D'aerthe and Jarlaxle. He considered his brother weak for his decision to study [[magic]]. From his earliest days, he hated surface elves and half-elves and when he had free time outside his missions Soluun always tried to kill some solitary elvish individuals.",
        "Possessions": "Like his fellows Fel'rekt and Krebbyg, Soluun was equipped with [[Lantanese]] [[firearm]]s."
