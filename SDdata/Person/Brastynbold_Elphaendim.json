        "mainbody": "'''Brastynbold \"Oldhelm\" Elphaendim''' was a member of the noble merchant [[House Elphaendim]] of [[Arrabar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Brastynbold was an extremely tall and muscular man with a chest as big as a wine barrel. He had immense strength that was barely contained in his huge body. He accidentally roughhoused people with a mere handshake or a kiss of a lady's hand.",
        "Personality": "Brastynbold's temperament was the almost complete opposite of his uncle's, Elphaendim family patriarch – [[Thalammose Elphaendim]]. Oldhelm Elphaendim was a loud and exuberant individual who loved brawls almost as much as he loved [[wine]].",
        "History": "Brastynbold \"Oldhelm\" Elphaendim had a boisterous reputation in the city of Arrabar. One story that was quite popular in the noble circles was the incident when Oldhelm witnessed a thief in his estate. After ingesting a full keg of [[firewine]], the bear of a man hurled his [[greatsword]] at the criminal across the family's sizable courtyard. The sword impaled the thief to the estate's wall as he tried to scale it to escape.\n\nOn [[Tarsakh 13]] of the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, Oldhelm Elphaendim attended [[Emriana Matrell]]'s grand sixteenth birthday celebration, along with his uncle, Thalammose, and the patriarch's great-niece [[Cauvra Elphaendim]]. Brastynbold was present at the party and, along with other guests, witnessed an assassination attempt at the matriarch of [[House Matrell]] – [[Hetta Matrell]]."
