        "mainbody": "rastynbold \"Oldhelm\" Elphaendim was a member of the noble merchant House Elphaendim of Arrabar in the Vilhon Reach in the late 14 century DR.\nBrastynbold was an extremely tall and muscular man with a chest as big as a wine barrel. He had immense strength that was barely contained in his huge body. He accidentally roughhoused people with a mere handshake or a kiss of a ladys hand.\nBrastynbolds temperament was the almost complete opposite of his uncles, Elphaendim family patriarch – Thalammose Elphaendim. Oldhelm Elphaendim was a loud and exuberant individual who loved brawls almost as much as he loved wine.\nBrastynbold \"Oldhelm\" Elphaendim had a boisterous reputation in the city of Arrabar. One story that was quite popular in the noble circles was the incident when Oldhelm witnessed a thief in his estate. After ingesting a full keg of firewine, the bear of a man hurled his greatsword at the criminal across the familys sizable courtyard. The sword impaled the thief to the estates wall as he tried to scale it to escape.\nOn Tarsakh 13 of the , Oldhelm Elphaendim attended Emriana Matrells grand sixteenth birthday celebration, along with his uncle, Thalammose, and the patriarchs great-niece Cauvra Elphaendim. Brastynbold was present at the party and, along with other guests, witnessed an assassination attempt at the matriarch of House Matrell – Hetta Matrell."
