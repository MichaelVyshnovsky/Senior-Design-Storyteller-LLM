        "mainbody": "Lata Hisiir was a half-elf trader who inhabited the Shining Lands during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nLata specialized in the sale and trade of gemstones and jewels. She wandered the Shining Lands, always on the lookout for a good deal and was honest in her dealings with the price of her stones. She had a keen eye for her craft and knew exactly how much each gem was worth. Lata was allied with the Seltarir chaka. She usually kept this information private, prefering instead to build a reputation for herself based upon her skills.\nShe carried a shortsword."
