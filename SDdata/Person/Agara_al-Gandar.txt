Caliph '''Agara al-Gandar''', who was also called '''Agara the Dandy''' was the ruler of the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free City]] of [[Utaqa]] in [[north Zakhara]] in {{Yearlink|1367}}.{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Agara was selected to be a puppet ruler by the [[mamluk]]s of [[Qudra]] after an insurrection that resulted in the mamluks' execution of the previous Caliph and his entire family. Agara quickly realized that the population of Utaqa needed a degree of autonomy in order for anything to be accomplished. Though Qudra was carefully watching Agara's progress, they did not interfere since the [[Grand Caliph]] in [[Huzuz]] assured them that things were operating smoothly in the city under the new Caliphate. Agara was stressed more and more with the pressures of ruling such a city.

==History==
Agara was a successful businessman before becoming Caliph.
