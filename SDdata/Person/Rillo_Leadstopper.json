        "mainbody": "illo Leadstopper was a gnome tinkerer in Phlan during the late 15 century DR.\nAfter the death of his wife, Rillo and his daughter Villonah always became at odds with each other. Even at a young age, Villonah had regularly got into with the law. Typically, she was captured by the Knights of the Black Fist and released after Rillo paid for the damage she did.\nIn the 1480s DR, Villonah disappeared, prompting Rillo to go to Madame Freonas Tea Kettle to hire some adventurers to help him find her."
