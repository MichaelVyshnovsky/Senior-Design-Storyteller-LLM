        "Personality": "Opanrael was a tidy man, almost obsessively so. He placed order and structure in high regard and did not like people with opposing views. Opanrael could became easily excitable by topics that piqued his interest.",
        "History": "Opanrael was the Head Curator of Mantor's Library for many years, being one of the longest-lasting members of the library. In [[1489 DR]], he was involved in a case of stolen books, but was more concerned about the disappearance of two of the Library's scribes, [[Garda Greenleaf]] and [[Ellison Berenger]]."
