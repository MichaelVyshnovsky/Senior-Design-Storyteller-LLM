        "mainbody": "'''Vishnan VII''' was a priest-king of the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in [[Malatra]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relations": "His mother was Lady [[Natiya]], who remained as a dowager and advisor to her son.\n\nHis brother was Divine Prince [[Puran]].\n\nVishnan had three wives and twelve consorts. With these, he had nine legitimate children, the eldest of whom, Novice-Prince [[Kavayah II]], was his heir presumptive.",
        "Personality": "Aged 35 around 1357 DR, Vishnan was an utterly authoritarian leader with a regal manner. He would take advice only when he asked for it, and after he had made a decision only his mother could change his mind.\n\nHe preferred conducting temple ceremonies to going on military campaigns, despite being an able [[sohei]].",
        "Activities": "As Priest-King, Vishnan VII dominated the absolute monarchy and theocracy of the Kuong Kingdom, serving as both head of civil government and leader of the church venerating the [[Lords of Creation]]. His authority was unquestioned and his power was full and far-reaching. Moreover, the Priest-Kings were believed to be divine, and the Kuong viewed him with awe. He was aided by a few advisors and councilors of his choosing, as well as senior priests. His chief advisor was his mother, Lady Natiya; she instilled her imperial ambitions in him.\n\nVishnan was noted for often dismissing irresponsible or incompetent bureaucrats and appointing replacements.\n\nHe ruled from the capital city of [[Ranguri]].",
        "History": "Hungry for its prosperous agricultural lands and spurred by Natiya's dreams of empire, Vishnan called for a new assault on the northern nation of [[Laothan]] in the 1350s DR. He placed his brother Puran as general of the \"army of conquest\". Moving covertly, the Kuong army of conquest began marching north in [[1357 DR]], going through the [[Purang]] hill country and entering Laothan in secret."
