In this capacity, he led 33 priests and 69 lay-followers.\n\nHowever, Latheen went mad following the apparent death of Waukeen during the [[Time of Troubles]], in [[1358 DR|the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], though he remained in charge for some time after.\n\nBy [[1367 DR|the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]], Latheen had been replaced as High Priest by [[Baniya Dolester]]. One of Dolester's duties was to care for the still-suffering Latheen.",
