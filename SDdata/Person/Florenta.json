When  Karlach escaped the Hells in the  abroad a spelljammer ship, Florenta sent sulphur-reeking notes to Toril. One such note that found Karlach talked about Fruug and his imp, who got stuck in a butter barrel and plummeted into a volcano to Florentas amusement. Flos laugh irritated Zariel enough to send her out of the room."
