        "mainbody": "Tsjancy Yildree was the Magister from  to . He was chosen by Azuth, probably by being the most thorough magical researcher of his day.\nHe was a fat, scuttling man.\nHe was genial, and always smiled, even during torture. His hobbies included strong cheeses, mustard pickles, and crafting new spells.\nHe was the most thorough magical researcher of the day.\nTsjancy accepted the office of the Magister when Azuth offered it, but almost immediately regretted it due to the volume of challengers for the position. This frustration led him to develop a spell, the feeblemind field, to deal with them more efficiently.\nThe end of his tenure began when a foe captured him with a freshly-developed dispel magic field spell, and chained one of his hands to a cave where the dispelling field was set down. He then tortured him for the specifics of several spells by crushing his free hand. When his captor allowed him some time alone, Tsjancy severed his own hand with a hidden boot knife, freeing himself, and transformed into a serpent to escape between the bars.\nHe spent some months afterwards hiding from all mages to the best of his ability, but then was caught and slain by Urboltar Highymhelver, who mployed a spellseeking worm to do it."
