'''Chanragoupta''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] and merchant who operated [[Chanragoupta's Exotic]] in [[Eileanar]] until its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Activities==
Chanragoupta traveled [[Faer√ªn]] in search of exotic textiles for his shop. He also bought up any fabrics brought back by the [[spelljammer]]s of [[Yeoman's Loft]], making him the sole supplier of these rare fabrics from [[Realmspace]] and other [[planes]].

==History==
Chanragoupta managed to catch the prolific [[thief]] [[Cadogen]] during an attempted robbery, and intended to have him hanged at dawn the next day. Cadogen used his roguish skills to not only slip his bonds, but seduced Chanragoupta's wife [[Valleria]], and escaped with her. With the situation posed as a kidnapping for ransom, Chanragoupta paid the demanded 20,000 [[gp]], though she never returned. Despite fearing that she had been killed, he maintained a standing 5,000 gp reward for her safe return afterwards.
