        "mainbody": "rimgol Muzgardt was a duergar ale merchant of Clan Muzgardt from Gracklstugh in the late 15 century DR.\nCirca 1486 DR, during one of his travels to Mantol-Derith, he found Fraz-Urbluus gem. Convinced by the gem that he was without honor, Krimgol hired the wizard Yantha Coaxrock, leader of the Stoneheart Enclave in Blingdenstone, to set the gem in an item of jewellery.\nHowever, Yantha too succumbed to the gems influence and lied to Krimgol about the value of the gem. Suspecting treachery, he demanded the gem back, but it was secretly stolen by Flink Thunderbonk. Krimgol did not believe Yanthas story and, with the support of Ghuldur Flagonfist, the duergar representative, attacked the deep gnome section of the city and kidnapped the wizard, starting a civil war in the trading post.\nGhuldur and Krimgol then interrogated Yantha in order to understand the whole matter.\nThe gem caused Krimgol to believe himself to be a calassabrakâ€”a duergar without honor.\nKrimgor was a good friend of Ghuldur Flagonfist, the duergar representative in Mantol-Derith."
