        "mainbody": "Nobruzzal was a male drow wizard and a student of Solom Nedrazak at the Inverted Tower in Szith Morcane.\nA tall and gaunt male drow, Nobruzzal distinguished himself by dressing entirely in black. He wore black boots and trousers, a black shirt, and a black cloak.\nNobruzzal was a drow of eclectic tastes in magic, preferring to dabble in all manner of schools of magic and practices.\nA skilled wizard and the apprentice of Solom Nedrazak, Nobruzzal had researched many spells from a variety of schools. In addition, he had studied alchemy and could create a number of magical potions.\nAs an apprentice of the Inverted Tower, Nobruzzal was denied many possessions as a result of the policy of austerity that his master, Solom, enforced. However, he did keep a snakeskin-bound spellbook in his room and wore a set of bracers of armor and a ring of protection.\nNobruzzal had a cordial enough relationship with the other members of the Inverted Tower that he could study alongside them communally.\nAs an apprentice of the archmage Solom Nedrazak in the Inverted Tower, Nobruzzal had spent many years studying the art of wizardry.\nIn 1372 DR, Nobruzzal was present when House Morcane fell to Kiaransaleean cultists and the arrival of refugees from Maerimydra. Despite these disturbances to Szith Morcanes society, Nobruzzal and the rest of his colleagues in the Inverted Tower were left largely unaffected.\nCategoryDrow\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryInhabitants of the Inverted Tower\nCategoryInhabitants of Szith Morcane\nCategoryInhabitants of the Deep Wastes\nCategoryInhabitants of the Upperdark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nj9rta4ucme3385n16nxn3fd5xhqemy0"
