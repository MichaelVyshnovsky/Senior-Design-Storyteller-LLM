        "History": "In [[1377 DR]], Durth was one of the deep gnomes hired by [[Cavatina Xarann]] to act as a guide for the combined force of [[Sshamath]] wizards and priests of [[Eilistraee]] to the main temple of [[Kiaransalee]], which they planned to attack.\n\nHowever Durth and his companion had long had business with the Crones of Kiaransalee, providing them with [[voidstone]]. So they double-crossed the [[drow]]. They tried to kill [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] but instead Q'arlynd knocked Durth down and killed his companion."
