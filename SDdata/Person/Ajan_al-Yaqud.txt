'''Ajan al-Yaqud''' was the leader of the members of [[House Bakr]] who chose to remain in the [[High Desert]], as of [[1367 DR]]{{AQ-time}}, after their sheikh decided to live in [[Tajar]].<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p37">

==Activities==
Ajan often led his [[desert rider]]s in the south-central region of the desert in attacks against bandits who preyed upon caravans bound for [[Akota]]. Ajan believed remaining in the desert was the best way for his tribe to avoid danger. He maintained relations with the Sheikh in Tajar by sending representatives to exchange news. He refused to enter Tajar himself because of a vision of his own doom that would transpire should he do so.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p37"/>

==Relationships==
Ajan was the son of Sheikh [[Ali al-Hadd]]'s sister and the nephew of the Sheikh.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p37"/>
