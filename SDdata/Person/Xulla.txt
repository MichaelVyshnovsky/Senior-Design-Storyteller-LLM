'''Xulla''' was a [[beholder]] member of the [[Zhentarim]].

==Relationships==
Xulla was the longest and most loyal beholder ally of [[Fzoul Chembryl]].

==History==
It was one of the many beholder exiled from [[Ooltul]]
The beholder was chosen as a replacement for [[Xantriph]] as Voice of Bane in the [[Temple in the Sky]] but was not so efficient.

In later years, Xulla was nominated as Caravan Leader of the Zhentarim and responsible for the mercantile part of the organization.
