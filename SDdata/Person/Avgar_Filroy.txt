'''Avgar Filroy''' was the only innkeeper in [[Noanar's Hold]] until sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==Activities==
Courageously, Avgar managed the [[White Hart Inn]] with the help of some ''[[unseen servant]]s'' for the cleaning. He was a little delusional and always warned customers not to disturb the [[Hunt Lords]] or go out of the inn in the night.
