Broxley Fairkettle was a strongheart halfling representative of the Fellowship of Innkeepers in Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR.
In 1492 DR, Broxley possibly went to check the new owners of the Trollskull Manor, trying hard to recruit them into his guild and offering advice.
Broxley always lamented the difficulty of being the father of nine children and believed that if all followed the Guilds rules his life would become little easier.
