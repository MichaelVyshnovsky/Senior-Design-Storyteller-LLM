'''Ulreel''' was a [[bronze dragon]] who attended the meet called by [[Lareth]] on [[Marpenoth 14]] of the {{yearlinkName|1372}}. He was initially reticent to follow Lareth's plan, and almost got violent, but eventually caved in to the scheme involving [[Nexus]]' spell to sleep through the next year's [[Rage of Dragons]].{{cite book/The Rage||7}}
