'''Jeorug Khalaga''' was a [[human]] [[monk]] and the high lama of the city of [[Li-Raz]] on the [[Plain of Horses]] ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.

==History==
Khalaga was born to a family based in Li-Raz that had produced eighteen consecutive generations of first-born sons who took up the path of the [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]]. He grew up in the city and trained at the renowned [[Temple of Seven Bells]].

However, the leaders of Li-Raz had grown less and less tolerant of the shiftless lamas so, around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, Jeorug reinvented himself as a guide to get out of the city and reduce his profile. Fortunately, within a few months, Jeorug had become quite popular with travelers, thanks to his encyclopedic knowledge about the region and his good nature.

==Personality==
He had a bright, cheerful personality and was loquacious and a skilled debater. This was most evident in the ''choir horal'', a kind of religious debate where lamas challenged each other with questions of a philosophical nature; Jeorug was talented in these.
