Amaerel was one of the adventurers who ran the Stargath House inn in the Amnian town of Purskul in the late 14 century DR.
Like several other members of her adventuring band, Amaerel was a beautiful, tall, and graceful woman.
By the late 14 century DR, Amaerel, Rathradauna, and Tristel, along with other members of a certain adventuring band, were semi-retired and in charge of the Stargath House in Purskul. Despite their affluent past, Amaerel, nor her adventuring companions, divulged the name of their group, if it had one.
