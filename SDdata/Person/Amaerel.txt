'''Amaerel''' was one of the [[adventurer]]s who ran the [[Stargath House]] inn in the [[Amn]]ian town of [[Purskul]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Like several other members of her adventuring band, Amaerel was a beautiful, tall, and graceful woman.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Amaerel, [[Rathradauna]], and [[Tristel]], along with other members of a certain adventuring band, were semi-retired and in charge of the Stargath House in Purskul. Despite their affluent past, Amaerel, nor her adventuring companions, divulged the name of their group, if it had one.
