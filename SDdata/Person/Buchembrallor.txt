Buchembrallor was a green dragon living in Cape Velen in 1373 DR.
Buchembrallor plagued the Fyraven area.
During the Rage of Dragons of 1373 DR, Buchembrallor declared war on all ships of Wealdath and with the help of Linussaxannol he destroyed a large portion of the coast. Later, the local sailors put a bounty on his head.
Buchembrallor was overconfident, believing all creatures of his size or smaller were surely inferior to him and always started a battle with them. Thank to this system, he had acquired a hoard larger than most dragons his age had.
Buchembrallor forged a friendship with Linussaxannol, whom the green dragon respected.
