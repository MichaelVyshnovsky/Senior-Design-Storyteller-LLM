Raoryndar or Rindlar was a snakeskin merchant of Suzail in the late 15 century DR.
His gaze was very uncomfortable for Amarune Whitewave, compared to that of other patrons at the Dragonriders Club.
He was quite tight-fisted about his coins.
He was a snakeskin merchant, and a regular at the Dragonriders Club.
One early evening after the Open Feast of , while dancing at the Dragonriders Club, Amarune Whitewave overheard Raoryndar or Rindlar or something, who had been an honest enough patron for three years, bring up the rampage three nobles had earlier gone on. Amarune quickly decided to hop off, get her clothes on, and go tell Arclath Delcastle about it.
