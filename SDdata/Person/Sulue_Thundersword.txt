==Description==
Sulue Thundersword was described as petite noblewoman.

==Personality==
Sulue was considered quite sweet and gentle in temperament.

When her true allegiances were revealed, Sulue chose to silently stare at the walls of her cell. She refused to share any secrets, no matter what the [[War Wizards]] did early on in her interrogation.

==Abilities==
Sulue Thundersword was capable of handling a [[longbow]], at least to a basic degree.

==Activities==
Sulue was an agent and worshiper of [[Shar]]. She had managed to evade the vetting processes intended to root Sharrans out, and served as a lady-in-waiting to the then princess, [[Raedra Obarskyr]].

==History==
When Sulue's true allegiances were discovered in the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, she was caught and imprisoned shortly thereafter. Interrogation by War Wizards followed. The revelation came as a shock to her tearful parents and [[Raedra Obarskyr]].
