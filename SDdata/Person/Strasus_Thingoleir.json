        "mainbody": "'''Strasus Thingoleir''' \"the Bold\" was a talented [[archmage]] and [[adventurer|ex-adventurer]] living in [[Yhaunn]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/Character Profile: At Home in Fourstaves House}}",
        "Description": "The archmage had a rather deep and hideous voice, especially when he was annoyed at someone.",
        "Personality": "Strasus had a particular fondness for destructive [[evocation]] spells, though his tendencies became more temperate with age. He was rather grouchy and had little tolerance for time-wasters that kept him from his work.",
        "Relationships": "Strasus was married to [[Dagnalla Irongard]] and was the father of [[Malia Thingoleir|Malia]], [[Roderio Thingoleir|Roderio]], and [[Keph Thingoleir|Keph]], as well as father-in-law to [[Krin Foxrun]] and grandfather of [[Adrey Foxrun|Adrey]]. He and Dagnalla tutored Malia, Roderio and Adrey in magic.\n\nHe struggled to be a good father to Keph, having little to connect over, and often came off as patronising or dismissive. He was exasperated by his son's relentless troublemaking and how he had to repeatedly bail him out of jail. In an attempt to bond over his son's love of dueling, he commissioned the magical rapier ''[[Quick]]'' as a gift for Keph, to little effect.",
        "Possessions": "In addition to his home at Fourstaves House, Strasus also worked from a tower in western Yhaunn. The tower was {{SI|70|ft|long=yes}} tall and no visible entrances, windows, or other features, and had an ''[[anti-magic shell]]'' around it. When dealing with visitors, Strasus communicated with them via a magical eye and mouth on the ground level that also let him cast spells at them if necessary.{{Cite dungeon/48/The Oracle at Sumbar|18}}",
        "Activities": "Over the years, Strasus built quite the reputation for saving the day at the last second with a powerful [[spell]]. By the time he lived in Yhaunn, he had largely retired from excitement, but still provided services to the city when needed.",
        "History": "In his youth, Strasus was an adventurer and travelled widely. He was well-known for standing face to face with a [[red dragon]] and blasting it to bits with his magic, heavily singed but alive, earning the nickname \"the Bold\". In the course of his adventures, he came into repeated conflict with the wizard Dagnalla Irongard, with their strong rivalry growing into love. After marrying Dagnalla, they built [[Fourstaves House]] and started their [[Thingoleir|family]] in Yhaunn.\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], he was entrusted with safekeeping and studying a collection of artifacts recovered from the tunnels around Yhaunn, among them ''[[The Leaves of One Night]]''.\n\nLater during the events around [[Moonshadow Hall]], he led his family to defend the [[Stiltways]] from the [[shadow mastiff]]s sent as a distraction by [[Variance Amatick]]."
