        "Activities": "Lanric worked to stop the bandits and pirates that plagued the Sword Coast and the [[High Road]] north of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 1470s DR. He was based out of the [[Broken Crown]] inn.",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, during Neverwinter's Protector's Jubilee, [[Elminster]] visited the city and bade [[adventurer]]s who sought him out to carry an important coded message to Lanric. It contained new orders and a message from Elminster that Lanric was to relay to other Harpers between Neverwinter and [[Luskan]]. Lanric figured it was safer for the adventurers not to know the details."
