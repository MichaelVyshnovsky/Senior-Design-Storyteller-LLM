        "age": "31 in {{yearlink|1356}}The article in ''Dragon 172'' says he's 31. Though the default date for 2e is 1368 DR, his stats are reprinted in ''Ruins of Myth Drannor'', which has its maps current to the Year of the Worm (1356 DR). As the book makes no reference to events past the Time of Troubles, a date of 1356 DR is assumed. Furthermore, the timeline in ''City of Splendors'' fits better if he was 31 years old in 1356 rather than 1368, so that his arm is grafted at the age of 16, after a long career of thievery and the theft of a heavy automaton. If he is taken to be 31 years old in 1368, he would have performed a long thieving spree by the age of 4, accumulating great treasure, survived a hand-slicing trap, carried off an automaton only to destroy it with stored magic, and finally purchased the services of Wonderstar to affix him a constructed hand, then started his tutelage, only to slay numerous assassins and then train himself. Such a thing by that age would be prodigious to the point of being worth explicitly pointing out, at the very least, and thus his age is assumed to be 31 by 1356.",

        "mainbody": "'''Baelam the Bold''' was a [[wizard]] and [[thief]] in [[Myth Drannor]] in the {{yearlinkName|1356}}.",
        "Personality": "While his humor was black and he was grim, he could comport himself gently and courteously when he really wanted to.",
        "Appearance": "He had broad shoulders, standing about {{SIAdj|6'1|ft-in|long=yes}} tall, with jet black hair and a hooked nose.",
        "Powers": "Baelam had a metal left hand, capable of dealing serious damage, even to creatures that required as much magic as a [[stone golem]] to be struck down. The hand was part of his body and couldn't be removed; if it were to be separated from him, it would continue to act on his will, even if the rest of him was ''disintegrated''. The excruciating experience of grafting had made him just about immune to nausea and pain. Besides his prowess as a mage and a sneak, Baelam's agility and wit were absolutely superlative.",
        "Possessions": "Besides a spellbook, he carried a ''[[ring of the ram]]'', a ''[[ring of regeneration|vampiric ring of regeneration]]'', a powerfully enchanted [[dagger]] that could ''[[blink]]'' on command for some minutes about once every 33.3 hours, a ''[[rope of entanglement]]'', and a ''[[potion of healing]]'' he carried in a [[steel]] vial. He also carried some money, and more often than not, a few gems.",
        "History": "Baelam was an infamous and very successful thief in the [[Sword Coast]] until he tried to steal from the wizard [[Thronthimm Blacksilver]]. Trying to disable a trap, Baelam lost his left hand. He managed to steal a strange [[iron golem]] and fled. However, later the golem animated and tried to kill him but Baelam, using a powerful [[magic item]], destroyed the golem's head.\n\n[[File:Baelam-Dra172.png|thumb|left|Baelam the Bold had his arm replaced by an automaton's.]]\nAfterward, he took the still-working left hand of the golem and went to the wizard [[Irritym Wonderstar]] in [[Waterdeep]]. Using most of Baelam's, treasure Irritym transplanted the golem hand to Baelam, replacing the lost one.\n\nImpressed by Irritym's result, Baelam decided to train in [[magic]] under him. In the {{yearlinkName|1342}}, Irritym was killed by a group of thieves and Baelam managed to killed the assassins but couldn't resurrect the wizard.\n\nHe continued his training in magic, wandering the Sword Coast and killing infamous thieves and using their treasures to finance himself. During this time, Baelam made many enemies, among them the sorcerer [[Garthagul]] of [[Calimport]] and the infamous thief [[Ssilban|Ssilban the Silent]] of [[Theymarsh]].\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1351}},{{Cite dragon/172/Lone Wolves}}\n\nFor a time he wandered around the [[Realms]] helping innocents and thieving from evil wizards and other thieves. Around {{yearlink|1356}} he had settled in [[Myth Drannor]], with the objective of finding and recovering some lost magic.",
        "Rumors": "In {{yearlink|1372}} there was a rumor around [[Greengrass]] that Garthagul unearthed a number of automatons branded with Wonderstar's symbol while excavating under a [[Dock Ward]] warehouse. As none were seen, it was largely considered to be a bid to bring out Baelam; the man was spotted at many taverns throughout Waterdeep within days, while Garthagul disappeared just as suddenly.",
        "Activities": "Sometimes, Baelam helped adventurers against [[baatezu]] and [[alhoon]]. He preferred to trade magic rather than killing."
