        "Personality": "Though often quick to anger, she also possessed an open mind and was very curious.",
        "History": "Bryn's entire family earned a living baking with crumblecake being their staple. When she and her siblings came of age they struck out from home to become adventurers, going their separate ways in the process.\n\nShe initially trained with the rangers of [[Ardeep Forest]], and developed a relationship with their leader, [[Corissa Windroot]], who was tasked with the safekeeping of an artifact known as the [[Infernal Stone]]. Corissa was however seduced and killed by the [[succubus]] [[Madelith]], in an unsuccessful attempt to gain control of the Infernal Stone.\n\nBryn's training ended when her group band was forced out of the forest by [[Eldreth Veluuthra]]. As chance would have it she reunited with brother who encouraged her to join the [[Order of the Burning Dawn]]. Bryn eventually earned a position of leadership with the Burning Dawn.\n\n''Circa'' [[1487 DR]], Bryn was informed that the Infernal Stone had resurfaced, and traced it to a Luskan citizen, who turned out to be under the control of Madelith. With the help of the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]], the stone was recovered and Madelith banished to the [[Nine Hells|Hells]]."
