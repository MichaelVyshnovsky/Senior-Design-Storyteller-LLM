'''Talonar Winter''' was a high-ranking member of the [[Purple Dragons]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Appearance==
He was well-spoken.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|181-183|19}}

==Abilities==
He was pretty capable at getting up and between trees.

==Relationships==
He was an immediate underling of [[Eskrel Starbridge]] during the time the latter was the top [[Highknight]] in [[Cormyr]]. For years, he'd been tailing [[Broryn Windstag]], a nobleman.

==History==
Around [[1479 DR]], Talonar replaced his superior in the [[Purple Dragons]], Eskrel Starbridge, in a security meeting after the [[Council of the Dragon]] was postponed due to magically introduced toxic smoke in the room where it was to be held. Before he could contribute anything to the conversation on how to find the traitor who had bypassed the wards, the [[ghost]] of [[Alusair Obarskyr]] walked through him; he didn't say much of anything through the rest of the meeting.

After the actual, calamitous Council of the Dragon, [[Glathra Barcantle]] wanted him to look at all the bodies before they were returned to their families.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|101|11}} She later commanded [[Arclath Delcastle]], a noble heir, to report to him, as he was going to be pressed into service as a Purple Dragon.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|120|13}} Glathra talked to Talonar again during his debriefing about the situation on the streets, on the same day.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|147|16}}

On the evening, Talonar Winter eavesdropped on Broryn Windstag and [[Delasko Sornstern]], two nobles who conspired against the Crown; he learned what they knew of ''[[blueflame item]]s'' and their dealings with [[Marlin Stormserpent]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|268-269|28}}

During the [[Festival of Handras]], when blueflame ghosts were expected to be unleashed in response to the performance of the Blue Flame (actually an illusion cast by [[Elminster Aumar]] and his descendant, [[Amarune Whitewave]]), Talonar Winter was part of the retinue guarding King [[Foril Obarskyr I]], that ultimately protected him from [[Cymmarra]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|325-327|34}}
