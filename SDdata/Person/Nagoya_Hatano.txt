Nagoya Hatano was the head of the Nagoya clan in Nakamaru in Wa around 1357 DR.
Hatano withdrew into his family to avoid peoples suspicions about his heritage.
Foreseeing troubles in the land, Hatano sought only to maintain his familys existing prosperity through a policy of careful neutrality.
Hatano was born to a minor samurai in the service of Lord Toragi and a beautiful spirit folk of the woods. They wed under mysterious circumstances, and Hatano was born but soon after, just as mysteriously, his mother disappeared.
Hatano knew nothing about the illicit romance between his son Nagoya Kenko and Sumi-ko but, if he discovered it, the young Kenko would be in deep trouble.
Hatano knew people were suspicious about his heritage. He was a bitter, tight-lipped, and sullen man.
