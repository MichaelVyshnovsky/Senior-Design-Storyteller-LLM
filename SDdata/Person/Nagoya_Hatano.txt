'''Nagoya Hatano''' was the head of the [[Nagoya clan]] in [[Nakamaru]] in [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Hatano withdrew into his family to avoid people's suspicions about his heritage.

Foreseeing troubles in the land, Hatano sought only to maintain his family's existing prosperity through a policy of careful neutrality.

==History==
Hatano was born to a minor samurai in the service of Lord [[Funada Toragi|Toragi]] and a beautiful [[spirit folk]] of the woods. They wed under mysterious circumstances, and Hatano was born but soon after, just as mysteriously, his mother disappeared.

Hatano knew nothing about the illicit romance between his son [[Nagoya Kenko]] and [[Sumi-ko]] but, if he discovered it, the young Kenko would be in deep trouble.

==Personality==
Hatano knew people were suspicious about his heritage. He was a bitter, tight-lipped, and sullen man.
