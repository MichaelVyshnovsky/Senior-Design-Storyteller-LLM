Myrvek of Gracklstugh was a derro merchant and savant who lived in the Underdark in the early 14 century DR. He was of the Hakrett clan.
The derro savant sold wares in the area near Rilauven, such as magical gear. He was also in the possession of some rare gems, but did not sell these. Myrvek had an odd personality, and may become hostile if insulted.
Despite their racial differences, he took up the company of fellow merchants Heggr Splitsteel and Wode the Guileful.
Myrvek would fight his enemies with his quarterstaff and magical spells.
