'''Kurgin Stonehand''' was the leader of [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[Clan Stonehand]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Under Kurgin Stonehand's leadership, Clan Stonehand owned a mine not far from a dreaded [[black dragon]] [[Zarkursk]]'s swamp lair. The clan's warriors led an attack and slew the beast, inheriting its horde of [[gem]]stones. This sudden wealth attracted unwanted attention from the dwarven bachelorettes of the [[Clan Licehair]]. To fight that, Kurgin Stonehand commissioned the creation of ''[[dwarven belt of charming|dwarven belts of charming]]'', [[enchanted]] items that lowered appeal and charisma of the young dwarven bachelors of Clan Stonehand.
