Kurgin Stonehand was the leader of dwarven Clan Stonehand sometime before 1372 DR.
Under Kurgin Stonehands leadership, Clan Stonehand owned a mine not far from a dreaded black dragon Zarkursks swamp lair. The clans warriors led an attack and slew the beast, inheriting its horde of gemstones. This sudden wealth attracted unwanted attention from the dwarven bachelorettes of the Clan Licehair. To fight that, Kurgin Stonehand commissioned the creation of dwarven belts of charming, enchanted items that lowered appeal and charisma of the young dwarven bachelors of Clan Stonehand.
