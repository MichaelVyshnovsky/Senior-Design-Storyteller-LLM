        "mainbody": "lackcut was a dark one who was a member of the Glumguts family of dark creepers in the Shadowfell city of Evernight as of the late 15 century DR.\nHe sought merriment and excitement by going on sneaky adventures and playing pranks on the inhabitants and visitors of Evernight. He was unafraid to do things that challenged or might embarrass the Glumguts or their employers, the Netherese. This put him and the whole family potentially at risk if his antics were discovered.\nBlackcuts father was Blackclaw, the terrifying and merciless leader of the Glumguts. Along with his fathers young cousins, Thrax and Vynnia, Blackcut tempted fate by defying his father with his behavior.\nHe lived at the dark creeper enclave with the rest of the Glumguts.\nBy , Blackcut, Thrax, and Vynnia had caused enough trouble that, if their involvement were ever discovered by the ghouls of Evernight, it would put the whole Glumguts family at risk of retaliation from the Netherese. Luckily, Blackclaw had yet to learn what they had done, else he would punish them severely. Blackcut, meanwhile, believed that he would be spared his fathers wrath because of their familial connection."
