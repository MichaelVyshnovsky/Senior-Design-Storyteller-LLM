        "Description": "After his transformation into a silveraith, Duneth barely resembled his previous self. He appeared as a vaguely skeletal being wrapped in wisps of glowing blue energy that trailed around him much like a wizard's robe.",
        "Possessions": "Since his transformation into a silveraith, Duneth eschewed most material possessions. However it was known that in life he possessed a ''[[staff of frost]]'', which was taken by Irae T'sarran.",
        "History": "Duneth Wharreil was the archmage of Maerimydra up until the Silence of Lolth struck the Maerimydrian priesthood. Then Duneth hatched a plan to remove the [[Lolth|Lolthites]] and rise to power himself by forging an alliance with the [[half-fiend]]/half [[fire giant]], [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]], to invade the city.\n\nWhilst his plan came to fruition and the city fell to their combined forces, he was struck by the aspiring church of [[Kiaransalee]]. The priestess Irae T'sarran destroyed the archmage and threw down his tower, turning the wizard himself into an [[undead]] creature known as a silveraith in [[1372 DR]]. Duneth was rendered a mere tool of Irae, pitted against any threats she perceived."
