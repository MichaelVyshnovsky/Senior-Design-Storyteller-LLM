Wyx was a nothic and advisor to Zedgar.
In the late 15 century, Vanifer directed the nothic to advise Zedgar, who was chief of the Emberhorn tribe.
Wyx was particularly persuasive, and was able to flatter others. Despite this, many members of the Emberhorn tribe didnt particularly like the odd creature.
