Like her sister, she wore a magic chain shirt underneath her cloak for defense and was armed with a halfspear. She carried rope and a grappling hook and potions infused with the spells fly and cure moderate wounds.\nKathala was a well-trained fighter, who focused on ranged attacks with her bow. With her magic potions, she often rained arrows down on foes from the air.\nWhenever adventurers entered their patrons lair, the two medusae would assist the former green dragon, who was immune, as a dracolich, to their petrifying gazes."
