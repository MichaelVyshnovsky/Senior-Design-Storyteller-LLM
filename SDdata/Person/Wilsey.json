        "mainbody": "'''Wilsey''' was a mayor of the hamlet of [[Liam's Hold]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Mayor Wilsey was an older woman with white hair, put together in a tight bun. She was dressed in rich brown robes.",
        "History": "By [[1358 DR]], Wilsey has been elected as the Mayor of Liam's Hold and several other helmets along the [[Trade Way]]. She was busy with the village's business, ensuring the safety and functionality of the hamlet and the passing caravans. Any visitors were greeted by Mayor's loyal [[halfling]] assistant [[Twinkin]].\n\nDuring [[Time of Troubles]], the nearby monastery, later known as the [[Stronghold (Liam's Hold)|Stronghold]], was exposed as a lair of a villainous [[Bhaal]]ist sect. However, the inhabitants of the keep mysteriously disappeared during the time when gods walk the Realms. An adventuring [[bard]] from [[Waterdeep]] discovered the stronghold empty and left the key to the structure with the mayor for safekeeping.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], Mayor Wilsey offered the empty stronghold to the person known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]] as payment for dispatching a gang of ne'er-do-wells - [[Methro Munroe|Methro]], [[Jethro Munroe|Jeth]], [[Yage Munroe|Yage]], and [[Sossi Munroe|Sossi \"Munroe\"]], who roughed up and harassed locals.\n\nThe same year, Mayor Wilsey helped the Hero of Daggerford investigate a series of strange occurrences that led to disappearance of [[Xanda Pennywell]], abducted by [[vampire]] [[Sieronius Dethick]]."
