She was dressed in rich brown robes.\nBy 1358 DR, Wilsey has been elected as the Mayor of Liams Hold and several other helmets along the Trade Way. She was busy with the villages business, ensuring the safety and functionality of the hamlet and the passing caravans. Any visitors were greeted by Mayors loyal halfling assistant Twinkin.\nDuring Time of Troubles, the nearby monastery, later known as the Stronghold, was exposed as a lair of a villainous Bhaalist sect. However, the inhabitants of the keep mysteriously disappeared during the time when gods walk the Realms. An adventuring bard from Waterdeep discovered the stronghold empty and left the key to the structure with the mayor for safekeeping.\nIn 1372 DR, Mayor Wilsey offered the empty stronghold to the person known as the Hero of Daggerford as payment for dispatching a gang of neer-do-wells - Methro, Jeth, Yage, and Sossi \"Munroe\", who roughed up and harassed locals.\nThe same year, Mayor Wilsey helped the Hero of Daggerford investigate a series of strange occurrences that led to disappearance of Xanda Pennywell, abducted by vampire Sieronius Dethick."
