        "Description": "Gayrlana was a beautiful womanGayrlana's apparent drow heritage and use of a sword from southeast Faerûn suggests she may hail from [[Dambrath]].",
        "Personality": "When individual members of her company caused problems, Gayrlana went to great efforts to set things right, ensuring the company as a whole remained trustworthy.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Mindulgulphs.jpg|thumb|''Gayrlana, \"Lady Bloodsword\", standing on the left, with some of her company in the Shaar.''|318x318px]]\nShe was amazingly charismatic as well as a tactical genius, so she was able to make full use of the abilities and talents of even her most unusual followers.\n\nGayrlana had some ability in [[psionic]]s, and her talents included the powers ''[[contact]]'' and ''[[mindlink]]''. Her telepathy aided her tactical and leadership abilities.\n\nShe was also a capable fighter, and specialized in the use of the [[longsword]] and [[whipsting]]. The whipsting was an exotic sword usable as a whip, from [[southeast Faerûn]].",

        "Relationships": "Gayrlana was the leader of the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company, in which capacity she had about 200 humanoid and entirely nonhumanoid soldiers under her command.\n\nThe famed warlord-for-hire, [[Brandon|Brandon, \"Battlemaster\"]], also based in Priapurl, once served alongside Gayrlana in the Mindulgulph Company. While he greatly respected her, he did not enjoy the company of her non-human soldiers.",
        "History": "[[File:Mindulgulph_insignia.JPG|thumb|right|''The symbol of the Mindulgulph Company was flames within a circle.'']]\nIn her youth, Gayrlana fought in an adventuring company. In the early 1340s [[DR]], they raided Mindulgulph Castle near Priapurl and discovered a number of intelligent, \"monstrous\" creatures dwelling inside. However, rather than slaying them as many adventurers would, they instead recruited the majority of them to their side. Gayrlana soon reformed the group into the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company, and they took the castle as their base.\n\nAt one point, Gayrlana killed a [[Red Wizard of Thay]], [[Thongh Mirr]], in single combat in the streets of [[Teziir]]. Famously, she won. Her explanation of her victory, \"the blade is faster than [[magic|the Art]]\", became a popular saying in [[Faerûn]] by [[1356 DR]].\n\nGayrlana's company was fully established and well known by 1356 DR.\n\nIn the 1360s DR, Gayrlana led much of her company to the [[Eastern Shaar]], where they took an extended contract with the [[gold dwarves]] of the [[Great Rift]]. Her purpose was to study the chances of war in the local [[Underdark]].\n\nGayrlana was still running the company in [[1372 DR]]."
