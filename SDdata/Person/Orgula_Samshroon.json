        "mainbody": "Orgula Samshroon was a clerk inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid–1360s DR.\nShe gave off a strong matronly vibe. Orgula never forgot a face and was quite cheerful. She was rather short.\nOrgula worked as a counter clerk in Auroras Realms Shop, Street of Tusks Catalogue Counter within Waterdeeps Trades Ward. Her vast knowledge of Faerûn, and the items carried within the shop, made her a valuable asset to the company.\nOrgula was a secret contact for the Harpers and served as a set of eyes for Piergeiron Paladinson himself."
