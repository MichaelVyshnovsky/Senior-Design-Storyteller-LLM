        "mainbody": "'''Aldor Urnpoleshurst''' was a lawyer just before the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].",
        "Personality": "Aldor was very suspicious of others and made accusations over nothing. He was a lawyer in training but a skunk in inclination.",
        "History": "Around [[1489 DR]], Aldor was forced to escape from [[Baldur's Gate]], probably because he'd been involved in a scandal. He boarded a great caravan, which unknown to him was full of [[Cult of the Dragon]] agents transporting treasures for the [[Hoard of the Dragon Queen]]."
