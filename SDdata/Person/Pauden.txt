Pauden was a Shadow Druid from the dark druid circle in Amn, based in the northeast of Trademeet in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Pauden was a pale male human with red hair.
In the , Paudens druidic circle from Tethyr fell under the sway of Shadow Druid Faldorn and her aggressive ways, who replaced the Great Druid Gragus. Druids became cruel and hardened, dispensing natures punishment to civilized people of the southern edges of Amn. At some point, the Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian was asked to solve the dire animal attacks on Trademeet. Subsequently, the adventurer and his companions discovered that the onslaught was the doing of the Shadow Druids. Pauden was unwilling to spill blood. Instead of attacking the Bhaalspawn, he left them with a warning of Faldorn remaining with the druidic grove and becoming unbeatable as long as she remained there. Cernd, a druid companion of Abdel Adrian, was familiar with the druids of Tethyr, having left them a while back. Pauden recognized his old ally and told him of the circles new direction.
