'''Fowler''' was a [[horse]] that was kept at a stable in [[Parnast]] for a time during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Fowler and several other horses accompanied the [[mage]] [[Druhallen]], the guardswoman [[Rozt'a]], the thief [[Tiep]], and a [[Dekanter goblin|goblin]] named [[Sheemzher]] on a trek across [[Greypeak Mountains]].

After the company returned to the surface from the mines of [[Dekanter]], Fowler remained waiting for them along the [[Dawn Pass Trail]]. The loyal horse then carried Dru for a ways until they reached the [[Weathercote Wood]], before he refused to continue any longer. The ultimate fate of Fowler the horse is unknown.
