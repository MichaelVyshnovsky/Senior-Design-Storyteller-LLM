        "mainbody": "Briglynn was a mystic of the Earthmother and a shopkeeper in Skullport.\nBriglynn was born with Anithlynn and Kaitlynn on board a Moonshae Isles ship to a mystic of the Earthmother, Celya, who lost most of her energy in childbirth. The triplets were taught from birth the mysteries of mystics. By their thirteenth birthday, Celya had died.\nBriglynn was the most passionate of the triplets and the most self-centered. She was a quiet free spirit. She sometimes doubted her vocation and her bond with her sisters, but still loved them.\nBriglynn managed with her sisters the Sisters Three Waxworks. She was however often busy with personal projects."
