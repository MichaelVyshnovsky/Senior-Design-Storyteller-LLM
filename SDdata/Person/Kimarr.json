        "mainbody": "imarr was an ambitious and power-hungry mage and traitor to the city of Phlan in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nIn the , mages Kimarr and Quil of Phlan were sent on an expedition to find the legendary Taydomes Keep, an ancient hold that guarded powerful magics. The keep was discovered in the Shaar just before the city of Phlan, and other settlements on the shores of the Moonsea were spirited away by the allied forces of the evil deity Bane. Council member Sasha and her bodyguards had left Phlan just before the city disappeared and were heading to Taydomes Keep after receiving a word from the two mages. The Council of Ten hoped to take the keep and use it as a stronghold.\nThe keep was found to have once been home to Lord Taydome, who weaved a magical contract with ogres and giants of antiquity into the castles walls. Kimarr discovered a scroll penned by Taydome that allowed for the use of the contract and its magic for enslaving giants with whom the original agreement was struck. Seeing an opportunity, Kimarr recited spells several times daily, enslaving more giants with each casting. Under his control, the keeps giants captured Councilmember Sasha once she arrived to inspect the new holding.\nKimarr knew of Sashas value and used her as a bargaining chip in dealing with Banes forces. However, Quil, still loyal to the Council, stole the spell scroll from his old ally and hid away within the keeps hidden passages and tunnels. Subsequently, Sasha was freed by the heroes of Phlan, with Quils aid, while Kimarr was presumed slain after he transformed himself into a fierce blue dragon."
