Haeleth was a smith, businessman, and landlord hailing from Waterdeep and based in the settlement of Bargewright Inn in the Savage Frontier in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He was tall and a man of few words.  He also a sound sleeper but a loud snorer, who could be heard even in the street outside his home and store.
He had a wife and four sons. He also kept a pet lizard its species was unknown but resembled a smaller relative of the basilisk and was not known to have turned anyone to stone.
Running Haeleths Horseshoes in Bargewright Inn, his specialty was of course making and attaching horseshoes, not only to horses but to all kinds of hoofed animals. Haeleth also made hasps, hinges, and hooks, which he delivered by the wagon-load to Waterdeep for sale in the markets there. In general, he truly loved working with sturdy iron rather than with the finer metals like copper and silver, but was not inexperienced in them.
Haeleth was prosperous in this trade, but all his coin went to Waterdeep, where he purchased properties and rented them out. The profits from these supported his family his wife in her Waterdhavian villa and his four sons as adventurers across Faer√ªn.Volos Guide to the North p. 30 suggests that these robberies happened while Haeleth was asleep, thus implying that he lives at or near his smithy. However, the map of Bargewright Inn on the preceding page puts his house on the other side of the settlement. Perhaps he naps during the day.
His house was on the opposite side of the settlement from his smithy, on the street called the Back and standing between the homes of Halduth Meer and Ruldarr and opposite Rinthar.
