Aravele was a mercenary that lived in Phlan during the late 15 century DR.
She was known to be freinds with a fellow mercenary named Keria and Grim, a guardsman and member of the Black Fist.
During the 1480s DR, various problems began to arise in Phlan, and the beacon over Sokol Keep went out. Both the citys Black Fist guardsman and the local dockworkers blamed each other for the emergent problem. Some members of the Black Fist, including Kerias friend Grim went missing.
One night when having drinks at the Laughing Goblin Inn, Aravele and Keria got into a heated argument with a group of Phlans dockworkers.
