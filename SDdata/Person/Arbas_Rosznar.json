        "mainbody": "Captain Arbas Rosznar was an Amnian Council Army officer of the Rosznar family who was assigned to command Hillfort Keshla on the realms borders in the 14 century DR.\nArbas was a gifted soldier and commander, but since his banishment to Keshla became a perpetually angry, bitter man who took out his frustrations on those below him. Despite his failings, he was still a competent and driven officer who was determined to do a good jobâ€”at any cost.\nArbas worked hard at Citadel Rashturl to win the command of the prestigious fortress, but in 1363 DR his aspirations were undone when he accidentally killed a man in a drunken brawl while on leave in Athkatla. To his misfortune, the man was the lover of Lady Phillippa Argrim, and only his family connections saved him from execution. Instead, he was assigned to the Hillfort of Keshla in the distant Tejarn Hills, a notorious posting used to dump malcontents and incompetents.\nArbas managed to take command of the inferior fort through the judicious use of murder, extortion, and other nasty deeds, and set about transforming it into a proper military operation. He ruled the fort through tyranny and abuse, and took out his frustrations in life on the bevy of incompetent soldiers who were sent his way. Arbas engendered fear and hatred in those under him, though his methods were actually very effective in raising the slipshod standards he had inherited. Through his efforts, the fortress was kept clean and in good repair, the troops improved from useless dregs to borderline-normal soldiers, and the underofficers started expressing some ingenuity, such as in developing a new boiling oil defense.\nDesperate to show off his work and be reassigned elsewhere, Arbas requested an inspection from General Labak Craumerdaun (or failing that, Commander Balacer Macefist) every year that he was at the fort, and the General finally agreed to perform a visit on Midsummer of 1370 DR."
