Goldandar Blackenrock was a svirfneblin leader who oversaw a small village in the Underdark.
Goldandar was welcoming to non-hostile outsiders, and was more than happy to converse with them.
In 1368 DR, the deep gnomes tunneled too deep released a monstrosity, a creature of nightmares. Goldandar desperately wished that this monstrous creature would be slain. He sent the majority of the deep gnome villagers to lower depths, leaving the village rather empty.
He asked Gorions Ward and their adventuring party to slay the monstrous creature of the depths that the sverfneblin miners had released. He also gave them a scroll of stoneshape so that they could collapse the rocks upon it. In exchange, he told Gorions Ward and the companions that he had seen Jon Irenicus and Bodhi travel to Ust Natha. He pointed them to a contact, Adalon, who may have known a way into the drow city. He rewarded the group with a magical mace and a gem that could dispel darkness.
