'''Goldandar Blackenrock''' was a [[svirfneblin]] leader who oversaw a small village in the [[Underdark]].

==Personality==
Goldandar was welcoming to non-hostile outsiders, and was more than happy to converse with them.

==History==
In [[1368 DR]], the deep gnomes tunneled too deep released a monstrosity, a creature of nightmares. Goldandar desperately wished that this monstrous creature would be slain. He sent the majority of the deep gnome villagers to lower depths, leaving the village rather empty.

He asked [[Gorion's Ward]] and their adventuring party to slay the monstrous creature of the depths that the sverfneblin miners had released. He also gave them a ''[[scroll]]'' of ''[[stoneshape]]'' so that they could collapse the rocks upon it. In exchange, he told Gorion's Ward and the companions that he had seen [[Jon Irenicus]] and [[Bodhi]] travel to [[Ust Natha]]. He pointed them to a contact, [[Adalon]], who may have known a way into the drow city. He rewarded the group with a magical [[mace]] and a [[gem]] that could dispel darkness.
