        "mainbody": "Khondar \"Ten Rings\" Naomal was a human wizard and the guildmaster of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors in Waterdeep.  His nickname referred to the ten rings he wore at all times, only two of which were magical at any given time. \nKhondar was bald and had a \"scarecrow frame.\" He had a salt and pepper mustache and goatee, as well as a unibrow. He always wore ornate rings on each of his fingers.\nKhondar had an explosive personality and was quick to anger. He liked his magical toys and became very reliant on his magical rings.\nKhondar served as the guildmaster of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors in 1479 DR. He claimed that many years previously, he had killed Markall Silverspur in Yhaunn after Silverspur blackmailed and stole from the guild.\nIn 1479 DR Khondar and his son Centiv killed the Blackstaff Samark Dhanzscul in a bid to become Blackstaff and replace the Lords of Waterdeep with a council of mages.  When Samarks power flowed into Vajra Safahr on Samarks death, Khondar kidnapped Vajra and took her to the sub-basement of a home he owned.  He tortured Vajra in an attempt to make her divulge the secrets of the Blackstaff but she was rescued by Renaer Neverember and friends before she gave up any secrets.\t\nKhondar was able to acquire enough knowledge from Vajra to enter Blackstaff Tower. He and Centiv entered the tower, but when Khondar saw he needed more keys to disable the wards, he abandoned his son to his fate. He finally acquired the six magical keys needed to disable the wards of the tower and he attempted to enter the tower on the Nightal 12, 1479 DR.  Vajra, who had assumed the position of Blackstaff, summoned spectral hounds of the Black Hunt, which eventually tore Khondar to shreds. His animated skeleton continued to swirl around the tower to be chased and ripped up by the illusions of the hounds, only for the scene to replay itself as a warning to potential intruders.\t\nKhondar searched plaguewrought lands for magical items and discovered the Jhaarnnan Hands in the Neverwinter Woods around 1460 DR. This item allowed Khondar to instantaneously switch out the two magical rings on his hands with other magical rings he kept on the Jhaarnnan Hands.\t\nCentiv Naomal was Khondars third son.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryGuildmasters\nCategoryMembers of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Sundabar\nCategoryInhabitants of Luruar\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Sundabar Vale\nCategoryInhabitants of Old Delzoun\n6ksy7djw6t0phsfxhfwdvgqzjfbdb6s"
