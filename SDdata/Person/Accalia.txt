Accalia was a female human priest from the Temple of Tempus in Easthaven within the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale.
As a follower of Tempus, the priestess wore armor even while completing her temple duties.
Accalia traveled from Neverwinter after Everards fellow priest, Renfeld, was killed outside Bryn Shander during a Reghedmen barbarian raid. 
In Eleint, 1281 DR, Accalia aided Everard in his duties for maintaining the temple.
