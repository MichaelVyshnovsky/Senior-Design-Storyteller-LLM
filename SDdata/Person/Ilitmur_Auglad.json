At some point between {{yearlink|293}} and {{yearlink|297}}, he began a romance with the [[Magister]] [[Nasana Melnuthquel]] after she snuck into his wizard's tower. She lived with him for some years, until someone seeking to challenge her for the position of the Magister broke into his tower and slew him. He was at the time so feeble that he had become a thing of magic more than man."
