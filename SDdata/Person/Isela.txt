Isela was an old witch dwelling in the ruined Talfirc city of Talis in the Reaching Woods in the midâ€“14 century DR.
She had dark eyes and wrinkled skin.
She was capable of magic.
She remained in Talis to await the child wizard of the Talfirc prophecy.
When the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon passed through Talis in 1364 DR, she told them about the Talfirc prophecy and gave the mage Morhion Gendahar a magical ring set with a violet stone, and a book, On the Nature of Shadows. She was thought to be defeated by Shadowhounds, but no one could say for sure.
