            "Legacy": "While the Aurilians were not sad to see Aronthan dead, they remained enamored with the power she had acquired. Even over a century later, powerful members of the clergy like [[Faerovel Hawntar]] and [[Amgrel Vlorund]] were still trying to emulate her. Meanwhile, her fortress of Frostspire continued to play an important role for the church, serving as a secret headquarters and a place of judgment where wayward clerics were brought for trial and punishment."
