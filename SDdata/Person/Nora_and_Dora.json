        "Personality": "Nora and Dora were dutiful enough in their work, but they did have a tendency to gossip too much.",
        "Activities": "The twins were excellent cooks, and handled most of the Manor's meals. They worked alongside [[Malda]], who they wisely prevented from getting involved in anything except boiling.",
        "Relationships": "Like Malda, they found [[Dom]]'s histrionic baking style rather tiresome to work around."
