        "History": "By the time Eldra died in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, she was known as a talented slayer of men, monsters, and [[sweet pear tea]]. She perished while hunting down members of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] across the [[Chionthar Valley]], drowned in the river's waters. Her soul yearned for revenge against the deadly cult, and Eldra Luthrinn ended up among the dozen individuals plucked from the [[Fugue Plane]], chosen by the entity [[Withers]] to aid in his campaign against the [[Dead Three]] and their Cult of the Absolute."
