'''Bim''' was a farmer in [[Neverwinter]] and student at the [[Neverwinter Academy]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When the city of [[Neverwinter]] put a call out for adventurers to investigate the deadly disease known as the [[Wailing Death]] in [[1372 DR]], Bim and his twin brother Pavel gave up their lives as farmers and joined the academy. When their new home was assaulted in the same year, Bim was one of the many casualties.
