Bim was a farmer in Neverwinter and student at the Neverwinter Academy during the late 14 century DR.
When the city of Neverwinter put a call out for adventurers to investigate the deadly disease known as the Wailing Death in 1372 DR, Bim and his twin brother Pavel gave up their lives as farmers and joined the academy. When their new home was assaulted in the same year, Bim was one of the many casualties.
