        "mainbody": "Dalilah al-Nakar was Grand Caliph Khalil al-Assad al-Zahirs first wife.\nDalilah was a mature beauty in her mid 40s in 1367 DR. She always carried herself like a queen.\nHer discerning gaze noticed everything that went on in the Royal Harim.\nDalilah was betrothed to Khalil when he was still an adolescent boy. She preferred the friendship of Zaynal ibn Sabur to Khalils other wives but was friendly with all of them.\nDuring the first years following their marriage, Khalil promised Dalilah that he would not take any more wives. Dalilah was never able to conceive children. Khalils Grand Vizier, Alyana al-Azzazi, informed him of the need to father children, and Dalilah released him from his oath. Her bitterness faded over the years."
