This was considered a weak foe compared to the usually more intelligent or dangerous creatures pitted against drow in this ceremony, and she resented the teasing it brought upon her.\nBythnara and Liriel had a strong rivalry, having grown up together. In 1361 DR, Bythnara planned to dispose of her, so Liriel preemptively pushed Bythnara into a lake of flesh-eating pyrimo fish. Their friend Syzwick witnessed the murder but swore never to speak of it."
