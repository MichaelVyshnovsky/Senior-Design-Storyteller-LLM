However, she never became the True Soul. Like other necromancers of the cult, she served General Ketheric Thorm and followed the deity of death – Myrkul. Because of that, Radija looked down on other cultists, especially the True Souls, who were infected with altered illithid tadpoles. Trusted servant of Ketheric Thorms, Radija resided within the Moonrise Towers and stood guard of the towers rooftops – the area off-limit to all. When the battle started between the Absolutists of the towers and the group of heroes who opposed them, aided by Harpers, Radija was presumed slain in the struggle shortly before the adventurers confronted and ended the unlife of General Ketheric Thorm."
