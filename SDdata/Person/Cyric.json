        "mainbody": "The mortal Cyric was born a bastard to two of Zhentil Keep's most unfortunate souls sometime around the early 1330s [[DR]]. His mother was an unsuccessful and destitute [[bard]] that lived in the poorest part of Zhentil Keep, and his father was a low-ranking [[Zhentilar]] officer that refused to acknowledge Cyric as his son. Cyric's mother resorted to [[prostitution]] and depended on the good will of others to keep her son alive, which she managed until the day she was slain by Cyric's father. The illegitimate Cyric was sold into slavery by his father, as recompense for the inconvenience of his existence, and shipped off to the southern nation of [[Sembia]].\n\nThe infant Cyric was purchased by a childless merchant-class couple as an heir to pass on their wine-making business. [[Astolpho]] the vintner and his wife raised Cyric in the lap of luxury for years, catering to the young lad's every want and desire. At the age of ten, ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1340}}, Cyric uncovered the truth of his birth and dramatically ran away from his family's estate. While he was promptly returned home by local guardsmen, Cyric boisterously asserted to all that his true home was Zhentil Keep and word of his origins spread rapidly among the Sembian elite. Over the course of the next two years, Cyric's parents became pariahs among their peers and their businesses came to ruin. The young man's growing mistrust of his parents turned to derision and outright hatred of them. At the mere age of 12 years old, Cyric murdered his parents in their sleep and left Sembia, heading north for Zhentil Keep.\n\nBelieving the death of his parents would grant him peace, Cyric set out to make a life of his own. But the reality of surviving in the Realms quickly set in with Cyric. Within a [[tenday]] he found himself near-starving and stricken with fever at the border of the [[Dalelands]]. In a stroke of twisted fate, the dying child was captured by Zhent slavers and taken north to Zhentil Keep in the Moonsea.\n\n===The Adventurer===\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1350}},<ref group=\"note\">While an exact date is not given, Cyric remembers the event taking place around 15 or 20 years before [[1368 DR]]. Cyric attempted to steal the ''[[Ring of Winter (artifact)|Ring of Winter]]'' from a powerful tribe of [[frost giant]]s led by [[Thrym (frost giant)|Thrym]], but was unsuccessful and became trapped in their cave. The opportunity to flee only came when a band of adventurers, including the mercenary [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]], attacked the frost giants' lair while also trying to find the ''Ring of Winter''. Kelemvor's entire party, save himself, was slain and only he and Cyric managed to escape. Once back in [[Arabel]] the two eventually joined [[Adon]], a young cleric of Sune, and they took work from the local city watch to uncover a traitor.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Cyric went to make offerings to an avatar of [[Tymora]] when she appeared in Arabel. Cyric was doubtful about the gods' arrival in the mortal realms and postulated that a divine being would have no use for his [[currency|gold]]. Some time later, Cyric, Kelemvor, and Adon met [[Caitlan Moonsong]], They were soon joined by Midnight, a charming adventuring [[magic-user]] to whom Cyric felt an immediate connection. \n\n[[File:Adventurers Shadowdale.png|thumb|left|300px|''Kelemvor, Midnight, Adon, and Cyric standing before Castle Kilgrave.'']]\nThe group freed Mystra from the clutches of Bane on [[Midsummer]], and accompanied her to the [[Celestial Stairway]], where she confronted still-divine [[Helm]], the God of Guardians. Despite Mystra's insistence that she deliver to Ao the message that Bane and Myrkul had stolen the ''Tablets of Fate'', Helm would not let her re-enter the planes. The avatars of the two gods fought a brief but terrible battle, one that excited Cyric's bloodlust like never before, and Helm slew Mystra on the steps of the Stairway.\n\nAfter passing through [[Tilverton]], the group journeyed eastward to seek out [[Elminster]] in [[Shadowdale]]. While passing through the [[Spiderhaunt Wood]] they encountered the [[Company of Dawn]] adventuring band, and Cyric uncharacteristically became fast friends with a young, naïve thief named [[Brion]]. Their connection was tragically cut short however, when [[giant spider]]s attacked the two adventuring groups and Brion was violently killed before Cyric's eyes. Cyric was clearly traumatized by the experience, but did not speak of it to others.\n\n===The Hero===\n{{Quote|You wish glory? You wish to lay down your worthless lives? Alright. But will you seek it at the cost of their lives? Leave this place and who will protect them?...Stand with me and you stand with Shadowdale!|Cyric to the Dalesfolk during the [[Second battle of Shadowdale]], [[1358 DR]].}}\nThe troupe arrived at Shadowdale on the eve of a Zhentilar invasion. Seeing the Dalesman confronted with overwhelming odds, Cyric's old mentor Marek suggested they leave together and defect to the Zhents' cause. Marek claimed they were both born for a life of murder and theft. Cyric refused, insisting that he would fight for his honor among his new friends. Marek forsook his friendship with the younger thief and walked away from his pupil. Cyric stabbed Marek in the back and justified his murder by claiming his former teacher was a Zhent spy.\n\n[[File:Ashaba Bridge.png|thumb|right|300px|''Riders crossing the bridge over the Ashaba.'']]\nCyric and the rest of the adventuring party joined in the defense of Shadowdale as the Zhents marched down from the north. He demonstrated great bravery when he confronted a group of Dalesmen abandoning their duties, and convinced them to help the town's refugees leave for safety by means of the [[Ashaba River]]. During the [[Second battle of Shadowdale|battle]], Cyric led the ambush against the Zhentilar cavalry as the mounted soldiers crossed the [[Ashaba bridge]], and even scored a direct bow shot against the Zhent commander and [[Banite]] priest [[Fzoul Chembryl]]. He was celebrated as a champion of the town by many of the local Dalesfolk.\n\nUnfortunately, Cyric had little time to bask in praise as Midnight and Adon were accused of killing Elminster in a magical explosion in the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba|Twisted Tower]] during the battle. The pair were brought before Lord [[Mourngrym Amcathra]] for judgement and, after a brief trial, were sentenced to death the following day. Cyric had to suppress his instincts to immediately murder Lord Mourngrym, but rather set out that night to free his companions from captivity. Overcome by indifference and bloodlust, Cyric silently slaughtered many unsuspecting guardsmen as he 'rescued' Midnight and the near-catatonic Adon. In the dead of night, the trio set out east down the Ashaba ''en route'' to Tantras, where one of the ''Tablets of Fate'' was rumored to lay in wait.\n\n===The Traitor===\nDuring their travel downriver, Cyric's cynicism and dark nature took over. He tormented the troubled Adon and tried to convince Midnight to abandon any hope of reuniting with Kelemvor. By this time, Cyric saw Midnight and the arcane power she demonstrated in the Twisted Tower as his means to acquire the ''Tablets of Fate'' for himself. After some time the trio came to [[Blackfeather Bridge (bridge)|Blackfeather Bridge]], atop which stood Kelemvor and a group of Dalesman charged with their apprehension. Cyric panicked, capsized their skiff and plummeted into the waters of the Ashaba. He was recovered by the Dalesmen after a short time and managed to lie and deceive his way into being taken captive rather than immediately killed for his grievous crimes in Shadowdale.\n\nCyric's time as a prisoner was short-lived, as the Dalesmen were soon stopped by a superiorly outfitted band of Zhentilar soldiers, the Company of the Scorpions. A fight broke out between the two groups and the Zhent company emerged victorious. Cyric expertly maneuvered the subsequent conversation to his advantage and secured himself a spot within the company by killing the last remaining Dalesman in a twisted game. He traveled with the Zhents across the eastern Dalelands for some time, and eventually took over the Company of the Scorpions for his own.\n\nIn a short time, Cyric and his company were granted audience with Bane in Scardale. In an ironic twist, Bane's avatar remained in the body of Fzoul Chembryl, the Zhent priest Cyric had wounded during the Battle of Shadowdale. Cyric offered nearly all he knew about his former companions and their quest for the ''Tablets of Fate'' to the Dark Lord, but held back offering freely Midnight's true name. Bane tasked Cyric and the assassin [[Durrock]] with killing Kelemvor in Tantras, and apprehending Midnight, but unfortunately they proved unsuccessful. The Company of the Scorpions and their leader were designated as Bane's personal guard, protecting him as he received the benefits of a [[Myrkulyte]] ritual that cost the lives of [[Bhaal]]'s assassins across [[Faerûn]].\n\n[[File:Bane v Torm.png|thumb|right|300px|''The battle of the gods Bane and Torm.'']]\nBane took a new avatar in the form of a towering [[obsidian]] colossus and marched across the [[Dragon Reach]] to Tantras with a fleet of Zhent ships—among them ''[[The Argent]]'' that passaged Cyric and his company—following closely behind. The colossal Bane was met in battle by the equally mighty avatar of Torm, and the two gods battled until each destroyed the other's mortal form. Sensing his moment to once again gain the upper hand, Cyric ordered his ship away from the dueling gods and avoided the destructive magic Midnight and recently returned Elminster delivered unto Bane's army. The ''Argent'' then sailed west in pursuit of Midnight, who had reunited with Kelemvor and Adon. Despite what was written in a [[Cyrinishad|certain book]] that detailed Cyric's life, he had no hand in the god's death but merely survived it by means of treachery.\n\nCyric and the Company of the Scorpions continued in pursuit of Kelemvor, Midnight, and Adon over the following [[tenday]]s, determined to retrieve the tablet they'd recovered from Tantras. and Cyric obtained ''Godsbane'', an intelligent blade inhabited by the god Mask that guided him to give in to his murderous instincts.\n\n===The Godslayer===\nHaving established themselves in the [[Haunted Halls]] of Cormyr, Cyric's company abandoned all ties to the Zhentarim and dedicated their lives to his quest for the ''Tablets of Fate''. During this time, horrific murders appeared across the Heartlands, with all signs pointing to the avatar of Bhaal, the Lord of Murder. Unable to stay in one locale for too long, they continued tracking Midnight and the others until they found refuge in the fortress of [[High Horn (hold)|High Horn]]. When the adventurers left under Cormyrean escort west through [[Yellow Snake Pass]], Cyric saw his moment of opportunity to act. As Cyric as snuck upon their camp, Kelemvor took notice and confronted him, with their former fellow companions, the Cormyrean soldiers, and Cyric's own company looking on. Despite Midnight's protests—and lingering hope Cyric would rejoin their group—Cyric and Kelemvor fought a vicious battle. When Kelemvor took the upper hand and held Cyric at the mercy of his blade, Cyric took advantage of Mystra's sympathy, got out from Kelemvor's grasp, and murdered his their traveling companion [[Sneakabout]], before fleeing into the night.\n\n[[File:Cyric_killing_Bhaal.png|thumb|left|300px|''Cyric raising ''Godsbane'' to slay the avatar of Bhaal...'']]\nDistraught after witnessing Cyric's true cruelty, Midnight went off to confront him alone, but was kidnapped by Bhaal in his most recently claimed avatar. The god of murder confided that only she held the power that could best Helm—despite Mystra's previous failure—and recover the second tablet from the Realm of the Dead. Putting their past aside for a moment, Kelemvor, Adon, and Cyric agreed to work together to rescue Midnight from Bane and rode off to [[Boareskyr Bridge]]. Fighting alongside each other once again, the former companions wore Bhaal down and Cyric delivered a final killing blow through Bhaal's chest. A great blast of white energy engulfed the bridge along with everyone atop it.\n\n[[File:Bhaal's death.png|thumb|right|300px|''...and the resulting explosion that enveloped Boareskyr Bridge.'']]\nCyric awoke to hear his former companions discussing what should be done with him. Ultimately they decided to leave him to his fate and continue on to [[Dragonspear Castle]]. Most importantly to Cyric, he retained possession of ''Godsbane''. Cyric stalked after the trio as they stole into the ruined castle, struck out at them as they descended into its basement, and—while aiming for Kelemvor—killed Adon with a single shot from his bow. He was turned away by Mystra's magic, and forced to flee west from the castle towards [[Daggerford]].\n\nCyric bided his time and tracked his companions to the city of [[Waterdeep]] in mid–[[Marpenoth]]. He infiltrated the city's [[Waterdeep/Sewers|sewer system]], and shadowed the avatar of Myrkul to the entrance beneath [[Blackstaff Tower]], where the God of the Dead deposited one of the tablets. He ascended the tower and found Elminster, Midnight, Kelemvor, and a resurrected Adon on the roof, all in possession of both ''Tablets of Fate''. As Myrkul's army of the dead descended upon Waterdeep, Cyric gravely wounded Midnight, slew Kelemvor, and took the ''tablets'' to the Celestial Stairway atop [[Mount Waterdeep]]. There Cyric presented himself before Lord Ao, and pled his case to the overgod. He was granted godhood, but could only use it to serve both Ao and his newfound faithful throughout the Realms. Cyric would never again feel any satisfaction or joy, and would forever have to contend with Midnight, the restored incarnation of Mystra and new Goddess of Magic. \n\n===The God===\n{{Quote|Cyric was a mistake, an exception that will not be permitted a second time.|Ao's [[solar]], to [[Amelyssan]] the Blackhearted.}}\n[[File:Cyric novel cover.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Cyric as a god''.]]\nOn [[Marpenoth 15]] in 1358 DR, Cyric ascended to godhood, taking on the portfolios of Strife, Murder, and Death,\n\nSome months after his ascension, Cyric conspired with Mask to kill the goddess [[Leira]]. Cyric took over her portfolios of Deception and Illusion, and along with Mask, successfully withheld this information from the rest of the pantheon.\n\nOver the following decade, Cyric ordered his faithful to scour every corner of the Realms to uncover the soul of Kelemvor Lyonsbane. Unbeknownst to Cyric, Kelemvor's eternal being was being hidden away by Mask. At the same time, Cyric directed his clergy to scribe the ''[[Cyrinishad]]'', a tome that would magically convert anyone that read it or heard it read aloud to Cyric's faith. \n\nOn [[Marpenoth 30]] of {{YearlinkName|1361}},Page 21 of ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set|Forgotten Realms Campaign Set: Running the Realms]]'' states this occurred in [[1360 DR]]. Cyric directed his patriarch in Zhentil Keep to carry out an inquisition against the lingering faithful of Bane in Zhentil Keep, in a series of killings known as the [[Banedeath]]. Banites in the city were forced to convert to Cyricism to explain to the new God of Strife in person as to why they should be exempt of his worship.\n\n[[File:Cyric Rinda.png|thumb|left|250px|''Cyric commissioning the ''Cyrinishad'' from the scribe Rinda.'']]\n===The Cyrinishad===\n{{Quote|It all depends on me, you see. Nothing is certain until I have beheld it and set it in place, until I have placed myself above it or below, before it or after...I am the One, the All, the Face Behind the Mask. I am the Everything.|Cyric, on the [[Night of Despair]], [[Nightal 28]], [[1368 DR]].}}\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Cyric attempted to create the ''Cyrinishad'' himself by means of his magic, He immediately ordered the city's denizens to scour the city. He rapidly became frustrated with the fruitless search for Kelemvor, however, and ordered Jergal to completely annihilate one denizen within his realm each hour until it was uncovered. \n\nAt the same time Rinda worked with Fzoul Chembryl and the gods Mask and Oghma to craft a second book, ''[[The True Life of Cyric]]''. Used in place of the ''Cyrinishad'', ''The True Life'' would demonstrate to Cyric's faithful just how deranged and treacherous he actually was.\n\n[[File:Inquisitor.png|thumb|right|250px|''Cyric's Inquisitor carries out the Second Banedeath.'']]\nCyric focused all his attention on the Mortal Realms and ignored his denizens, leading to growing unrest in the City of Strife. Armed with powerful [[Gond]]ar suits of armor, and continued the slaughter throughout Darkhold, [[Mulmaster]], [[Teshwave]], [[Yûlash]], and the [[Citadel of the Raven]]. This slaughter later came to be known as the [[Second Banedeath]].\n\nAfter his success with the inquisition, Cyric manipulated the god Oghma into sharing the rites to a bloody [[Gargauth]]an ritual that could grant insight to the whereabouts of Kelemvor's soul. He presented the rites before his patriarch [[Xeno Mirrormane]] in dramatic fashion and forced his faithful to prepare for its performance. Cyric then raised an army of [[dragon]]s and frost giants from [[Thar]] to the north and directed them to march south in an invasion of Zhentil Keep, with the intent of saving the city and emerging as its savior. The ''Cyrinishad'' worked on deities just as it would with mortals.\n\nMystra garnered support from the Circle to stop Cyric's abuse of dark magic, turned his former inquisitors against him, and spurred full rebellion in the City of Strife. Fzoul Chembryl completed the reading of ''The True Life of Cyric'' in Zhentil Keep, inciting riots in the city and ran rampant through its streets. Cyric returned to witness the denizens storming the Bone Castle. While Cyric was weakened and his faith waned across the Realms, Mask revealed himself as ''Godsbane'' and professed his 'revelation' of Cyric's singular divinity. Kelemvor arrived to lead the denizens to the throne room of the Bone Castle, The City of Strife's denizens elevated Kelemvor as the new God of the Dead, transferring a major part of Cyric's divine power to his most hated foe.\n\n===The Crucible===\n{{Quote|As for Cyric, now he sits alone in his Shattered Keep, lost in delusions of grandeur and absolute power, leaving his church of Faerûn to grow ever more fragmented and weak... Cyric was the first to read the ''Cyrinishad''; his own lies drove him mad.|Excerpt from ''The True Life of Cyric''.}}\n[[File:Cyric the mad god.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Cyric the Mad God.'']]\nAfter his defeat, Cyric reappeared in the plane of Pandemonium where he constructed his new realm, the [[Supreme Throne]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Cyric briefly appeared within the [[Pocket Plane]] that manifested from the divine realm of Bhaal. Cyric spoke with one of the last remaining [[Bhaalspawn]], [[Abdel Adrian]], to assess how much of a threat he posed by ascending as the God of Murder. Cyric appeared to be aware of the madness he held, but remained civil and did not stray from Ao's decree that he not interfere with the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]].\n\nOver the next couple years Cyric abandoned his divine responsibilities and peace and serenity spread across much of the Realms. By the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, this became apparent to even the gods and [[Tempus]]' ire grew. The god of war was eventually convinced by Mask On the eve of the trial, Cyric commanded his loyal follower [[Malik el Sami]] to recover the lost ''Cyrinishad'' from [[Candlekeep]], so that he might read it before the other gods at the trial and inflict upon them the same delusion it had on Mask.\n\nDuring the initial stages of Cyric's trial, the former God of the Dead turned attention to his accusers. He alleged that Mystra did not allow [[good|morally upstanding]] individuals to die by means of magic and that Kelemvor offered such great rewards to the virtuous after death that they no longer feared their own mortality. Tyr decreed that the charges of incompetence and disrupting the Balance against Cyric would be linked to those put forth against Mystra and Kelemvor.\n\nIn the city of [[Elversult]], Adon, now Mystra's new patriarch, was performing last rites when he became became possessed by a force appearing to be linked to Cyric. In truth, it was Mask forcing Adon to view Mystra as Cyric did, and the mortal priest was driven mad in the process. Mask carried out this plot in an attempt to take back his portfolio from Cyric, and compel Mystra to withhold magic from Cyric's followers. Meanwhile, Malik el Sami continued on towards Zhentil Keep, determined to cure Cyric of his madness, by once again replacing the ''Cyrinishad'' with ''The True Life''.\n\nTo prevent Mystra from interfering with Malik's quest, Cyric manipulated Mystra into attacking Mask, and she was temporarily interred within Helm's prison. After Mystra was released, she visited Kelemvor in his newly formed [[Crystal Spire]] in the City of the Dead. Mystra came to witness the dramatic change that Kelemvor had undergone: Cyric's machinations had forced the new God of the Dead—who remained as her longtime lover—to disregard the morality of his subjects. While wholly dedicated to his new divine duties, Kelemvor became cold, indifferent, and passionless. He was no longer the man or god Mystra fell in love with.\n\nAt the trial, each of the accused gods presented their cases before the Circle of Twelve. Kelemvor demonstrated his newfound commitment to fair and neutral judgement of the dead, and Mystra offered a similar revelation, that she would no longer unjustly wield access to the Weave to suit her own desires. When time came for Cyric to offer his defense—by having Malik read from the ''Cyrinishad''—some members of the Circle intervened and chaos broke out. Malik was allowed by Tyr to present his god's defense, and dutifully acted in Cyric's best interests by reading from ''The True Life''. The process was excruciating for Cyric but by the end of Malik's recitation, the Mad God had recovered his senses and offered his final defense: even when in the throes of madness he was the only one worthy to be the God of Strife. Through all his plotting and scheming Cyric had finally managed to strip Kelemvor and Midnight of their passions and destroy the love they shared. The same love that incited feelings of jealousy and rejection in Cyric,\n\nFreed from his madness, Cyric and Malik pursued a plot to chronicle their time together and unite the fractured Cyricist faith. This new tome that would document and glorify Cyric's feats would be entitled: ''[[An Honest and True Account of the Trial of Cyric the Mad, or How Our Dark Lord Saved Faerûn (Again)]]''.

Zasian managed to open a pathway to [[Celestia]] from the [[City of Brass]], a plot that claimed twelve years of the priest's life. In the years that followed, Cyric forged an alliance with the goddess [[Shar]], working together to weaken Mystra's hold over the Weave and lessen her influence in the Realms.\n\nOver a decade later, in the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, Cyric unleashed his wrath on Helm by orchestrating his death at the hands of Tyr.{{Cite dragon/381/Channel Divinity: Champions of Torm|91}}\n\nThe [[1385 DR|following year]], Cyric's priest Zasian freed the Sharran 'shadow mystic' [[Kashada]] from imprisonment in Celestia. Kashada was in fact an aspect of the goddess Shar, the Goddess of Night. Shar had manipulated Cyric's Zasian to help her supplant the Weave with her own [[Shadow Weave]]. and Shar distracted the god Azuth long enough for Cyric to recover his arcane staff. Cyric used Azuth's ''[[Old Staff]]'' to finally murder Mystra, and exacted revenge upon his former companion and one-time friend. Mystra's death wrecked the bonds that held together the Weave, and brought about the Spellplague, a calamitous event that was felt across the multiverse.{{Cite dungeon/181/Campaign Workshop: Hero Battle: Elminster|39}}\n\nIn retaliation for his murder of Mystra, [[Lathander]], Tyr, and Sune trapped Cyric in the Supreme Throne for 1000 years.

It supported cruel rulers and indulged fostered fear and intrigue while avoiding the spread of outright war. The church was often beset by internal feuds and backstabbing for some time before eventually waning. Many outside the church viewed it as a twisted den of madness, trickery, and death. Cyricist clergy condemned this outlook, preferring to see their religion as one of enlightenment. It purportedly revealed that all societal bonds of friendship, family, and love were nothing but ties that always withered away, and were therefore useless, weak, and pitiful.\n\nCyric's [[clerics]] prayed for spells at night, after moonrise, and often trained as [[rogues]] or [[assassins]].

Cyric's mother resorted to [[prostitution]] and depended on the good will of others to keep her son alive, which she managed until the day she was slain by Cyric's father. The illegitimate Cyric was sold into slavery by his father, as recompense for the inconvenience of his existence, and shipped off to the southern nation of [[Sembia]].\n\nThe infant Cyric was purchased by a childless merchant-class couple as an heir to pass on their wine-making business. [[Astolpho]] the vintner and his wife raised Cyric in the lap of luxury for years, catering to the young lad's every want and desire. At the age of ten, ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1340}}, Cyric uncovered the truth of his birth and dramatically ran away from his family's estate. While he was promptly returned home by local guardsmen, Cyric boisterously asserted to all that his true home was Zhentil Keep and word of his origins spread rapidly among the Sembian elite. Over the course of the next two years, Cyric's parents became pariahs among their peers and their businesses came to ruin. The young man's growing mistrust of his parents turned to derision and outright hatred of them. At the mere age of 12 years old, Cyric murdered his parents in their sleep and left Sembia, heading north for Zhentil Keep.\n\nBelieving the death of his parents would grant him peace, Cyric set out to make a life of his own.

Marek claimed they were both born for a life of murder and theft. Cyric refused, insisting that he would fight for his honor among his new friends.

A fight broke out between the two groups and the Zhent company emerged victorious. Cyric expertly maneuvered the subsequent conversation to his advantage and secured himself a spot within the company by killing the last remaining Dalesman in a twisted game. He traveled with the Zhents across the eastern Dalelands for some time, and eventually took over the Company of the Scorpions for his own.\n\nIn a short time, Cyric and his company were granted audience with Bane in Scardale. In an ironic twist, Bane's avatar remained in the body of Fzoul Chembryl, the Zhent priest Cyric had wounded during the Battle of Shadowdale. Cyric offered nearly all he knew about his former companions and their quest for the ''Tablets of Fate'' to the Dark Lord, but held back offering freely Midnight's true name. Bane tasked Cyric and the assassin [[Durrock]] with killing Kelemvor in Tantras, and apprehending Midnight, but unfortunately they proved unsuccessful.

When Kelemvor took the upper hand and held Cyric at the mercy of his blade, Cyric took advantage of Mystra's sympathy, got out from Kelemvor's grasp, and murdered his their traveling companion [[Sneakabout]], before fleeing into the night.\n\n[[File:Cyric_killing_Bhaal.png|thumb|left|300px|''Cyric raising ''Godsbane'' to slay the avatar of Bhaal...'']]\nDistraught after witnessing Cyric's true cruelty, Midnight went off to confront him alone, but was kidnapped by Bhaal in his most recently claimed avatar. The god of murder confided that only she held the power that could best Helm—despite Mystra's previous failure—and recover the second tablet from the Realm of the Dead. Putting their past aside for a moment, Kelemvor, Adon, and Cyric agreed to work together to rescue Midnight from Bane and rode off to [[Boareskyr Bridge]]. Fighting alongside each other once again, the former companions wore Bhaal down and Cyric delivered a final killing blow through Bhaal's chest. A great blast of white energy engulfed the bridge along with everyone atop it.\n\n[[File:Bhaal's death.png|thumb|right|300px|''...and the resulting explosion that enveloped Boareskyr Bridge.'']]\nCyric awoke to hear his former companions discussing what should be done with him. Ultimately they decided to leave him to his fate and continue on to [[Dragonspear Castle]]. Most importantly to Cyric, he retained possession of ''Godsbane''. Cyric stalked after the trio as they stole into the ruined castle, struck out at them as they descended into its basement, and—while aiming for Kelemvor—killed Adon with a single shot from his bow. He was turned away by Mystra's magic, and forced to flee west from the castle towards [[Daggerford]].\n\nCyric bided his time and tracked his companions to the city of [[Waterdeep]] in mid–[[Marpenoth]]. He infiltrated the city's [[Waterdeep/Sewers|sewer system]], and shadowed the avatar of Myrkul to the entrance beneath [[Blackstaff Tower]], where the God of the Dead deposited one of the tablets. He ascended the tower and found Elminster, Midnight, Kelemvor, and a resurrected Adon on the roof, all in possession of both ''Tablets of Fate''. As Myrkul's army of the dead descended upon Waterdeep, Cyric gravely wounded Midnight, slew Kelemvor, and took the ''tablets'' to the Celestial Stairway atop [[Mount Waterdeep]]. There Cyric presented himself before Lord Ao, and pled his case to the overgod. He was granted godhood, but could only use it to serve both Ao and his newfound faithful throughout the Realms. Cyric would never again feel any satisfaction or joy, and would forever have to contend with Midnight, the restored incarnation of Mystra and new Goddess of Magic.",

Cyric took over her portfolios of Deception and Illusion, and along with Mask, successfully withheld this information from the rest of the pantheon.\n\nOver the following decade, Cyric ordered his faithful to scour every corner of the Realms to uncover the soul of Kelemvor Lyonsbane. Unbeknownst to Cyric, Kelemvor's eternal being was being hidden away by Mask. At the same time, Cyric directed his clergy to scribe the ''[[Cyrinishad]]'', a tome that would magically convert anyone that read it or heard it read aloud to Cyric's faith. \n\nOn [[Marpenoth 30]] of {{YearlinkName|1361}},Page 21 of ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set|Forgotten Realms Campaign Set: Running the Realms]]'' states this occurred in [[1360 DR]]. Cyric directed his patriarch in Zhentil Keep to carry out an inquisition against the lingering faithful of Bane in Zhentil Keep, in a series of killings known as the [[Banedeath]]. Banites in the city were forced to convert to Cyricism to explain to the new God of Strife in person as to why they should be exempt of his worship.\n\n[[File:Cyric Rinda.png|thumb|left|250px|''Cyric commissioning the ''Cyrinishad'' from the scribe Rinda.'']]",

He rapidly became frustrated with the fruitless search for Kelemvor, however, and ordered Jergal to completely annihilate one denizen within his realm each hour until it was uncovered. \n\nAt the same time Rinda worked with Fzoul Chembryl and the gods Mask and Oghma to craft a second book, ''[[The True Life of Cyric]]''. Used in place of the ''Cyrinishad'', ''The True Life'' would demonstrate to Cyric's faithful just how deranged and treacherous he actually was.\n\n[[File:Inquisitor.png|thumb|right|250px|''Cyric's Inquisitor carries out the Second Banedeath.'']]\nCyric focused all his attention on the Mortal Realms and ignored his denizens, leading to growing unrest in the City of Strife. Armed with powerful [[Gond]]ar suits of armor, and continued the slaughter throughout Darkhold, [[Mulmaster]], [[Teshwave]], [[Yûlash]], and the [[Citadel of the Raven]]. This slaughter later came to be known as the [[Second Banedeath]].\n\nAfter his success with the inquisition, Cyric manipulated the god Oghma into sharing the rites to a bloody [[Gargauth]]an ritual that could grant insight to the whereabouts of Kelemvor's soul. He presented the rites before his patriarch [[Xeno Mirrormane]] in dramatic fashion and forced his faithful to prepare for its performance. Cyric then raised an army of [[dragon]]s and frost giants from [[Thar]] to the north and directed them to march south in an invasion of Zhentil Keep, with the intent of saving the city and emerging as its savior. The ''Cyrinishad'' worked on deities just as it would with mortals.\n\nMystra garnered support from the Circle to stop Cyric's abuse of dark magic, turned his former inquisitors against him, and spurred full rebellion in the City of Strife. Fzoul Chembryl completed the reading of ''The True Life of Cyric'' in Zhentil Keep, inciting riots in the city and ran rampant through its streets. Cyric returned to witness the denizens storming the Bone Castle. While Cyric was weakened and his faith waned across the Realms, Mask revealed himself as ''Godsbane'' and professed his 'revelation' of Cyric's singular divinity. Kelemvor arrived to lead the denizens to the throne room of the Bone Castle, The City of Strife's denizens elevated Kelemvor as the new God of the Dead, transferring a major part of Cyric's divine power to his most hated foe.",

Cyric was the first to read the ''Cyrinishad''; his own lies drove him mad.|Excerpt from ''The True Life of Cyric''.}}\n[[File:Cyric the mad god.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Cyric the Mad God.'']]\nAfter his defeat, Cyric reappeared in the plane of Pandemonium where he constructed his new realm, the [[Supreme Throne]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Cyric briefly appeared within the [[Pocket Plane]] that manifested from the divine realm of Bhaal. Cyric spoke with one of the last remaining [[Bhaalspawn]], [[Abdel Adrian]], to assess how much of a threat he posed by ascending as the God of Murder. Cyric appeared to be aware of the madness he held, but remained civil and did not stray from Ao's decree that he not interfere with the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]].\n\nOver the next couple years Cyric abandoned his divine responsibilities and peace and serenity spread across much of the Realms. By the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, this became apparent to even the gods and [[Tempus]]' ire grew. The god of war was eventually convinced by Mask On the eve of the trial, Cyric commanded his loyal follower [[Malik el Sami]] to recover the lost ''Cyrinishad'' from [[Candlekeep]], so that he might read it before the other gods at the trial and inflict upon them the same delusion it had on Mask.\n\nDuring the initial stages of Cyric's trial, the former God of the Dead turned attention to his accusers. He alleged that Mystra did not allow [[good|morally upstanding]] individuals to die by means of magic and that Kelemvor offered such great rewards to the virtuous after death that they no longer feared their own mortality. Tyr decreed that the charges of incompetence and disrupting the Balance against Cyric would be linked to those put forth against Mystra and Kelemvor.\n\nIn the city of [[Elversult]], Adon, now Mystra's new patriarch, was performing last rites when he became became possessed by a force appearing to be linked to Cyric. In truth, it was Mask forcing Adon to view Mystra as Cyric did, and the mortal priest was driven mad in the process. Mask carried out this plot in an attempt to take back his portfolio from Cyric, and compel Mystra to withhold magic from Cyric's followers. Meanwhile, Malik el Sami continued on towards Zhentil Keep, determined to cure Cyric of his madness, by once again replacing the ''Cyrinishad'' with ''The True Life''.\n\nTo prevent Mystra from interfering with Malik's quest, Cyric manipulated Mystra into attacking Mask, and she was temporarily interred within Helm's prison. After Mystra was released, she visited Kelemvor in his newly formed [[Crystal Spire]] in the City of the Dead. Mystra came to witness the dramatic change that Kelemvor had undergone: Cyric's machinations had forced the new God of the Dead—who remained as her longtime lover—to disregard the morality of his subjects. While wholly dedicated to his new divine duties, Kelemvor became cold, indifferent, and passionless. He was no longer the man or god Mystra fell in love with.\n\nAt the trial, each of the accused gods presented their cases before the Circle of Twelve. Kelemvor demonstrated his newfound commitment to fair and neutral judgement of the dead, and Mystra offered a similar revelation, that she would no longer unjustly wield access to the Weave to suit her own desires. When time came for Cyric to offer his defense—by having Malik read from the ''Cyrinishad''—some members of the Circle intervened and chaos broke out. Malik was allowed by Tyr to present his god's defense, and dutifully acted in Cyric's best interests by reading from ''The True Life''. The process was excruciating for Cyric but by the end of Malik's recitation, the Mad God had recovered his senses and offered his final defense: even when in the throes of madness he was the only one worthy to be the God of Strife. Through all his plotting and scheming Cyric had finally managed to strip Kelemvor and Midnight of their passions and destroy the love they shared. The same love that incited feelings of jealousy and rejection in Cyric,\n\nFreed from his madness, Cyric and Malik pursued a plot to chronicle their time together and unite the fractured Cyricist faith. This new tome that would document and glorify Cyric's feats would be entitled: ''[[An Honest and True Account of the Trial of Cyric the Mad, or How Our Dark Lord Saved Faerûn (Again)]]''. Cyric demanded that this book be published before a sect of [[Waterdhavian]] [[Oghmanyte]]s published their own accounting of the events.{{Cite dragon/245/Honest and True|57-64}}\n\nAs Cyric's insanity led to his decline in power, Bane's immortal son Iyachtu Xvim was able to take back some of his father's lost portfolios from the Mad God, including Hatred and Tyranny.",

Zasian managed to open a pathway to [[Celestia]] from the [[City of Brass]], a plot that claimed twelve years of the priest's life. In the years that followed, Cyric forged an alliance with the goddess [[Shar]], working together to weaken Mystra's hold over the Weave and lessen her influence in the Realms.\n\nOver a decade later, in the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, Cyric unleashed his wrath on Helm by orchestrating his death at the hands of Tyr.{{Cite dragon/381/Channel Divinity: Champions of Torm|91}}\n\nThe [[1385 DR|following year]], Cyric's priest Zasian freed the Sharran 'shadow mystic' [[Kashada]] from imprisonment in Celestia.

Shar had manipulated Cyric's Zasian to help her supplant the Weave with her own [[Shadow Weave]]. and Shar distracted the god Azuth long enough for Cyric to recover his arcane staff. Cyric used Azuth's ''[[Old Staff]]'' to finally murder Mystra, and exacted revenge upon his former companion and one-time friend. Mystra's death wrecked the bonds that held together the Weave, and brought about the Spellplague, a calamitous event that was felt across the multiverse.{{Cite dungeon/181/Campaign Workshop: Hero Battle: Elminster|39}}\n\nIn retaliation for his murder of Mystra, [[Lathander]], Tyr, and Sune trapped Cyric in the Supreme Throne for 1000 years.

While Malik and his companions—chosen of Helm, Sune, and [[Siamorphe]]—ventured through the [[Chondalwood]], Cyric manifested before Malik as the visage of a skull in a dead tree. The imprisoned god ordered Malik to slay his fellows at their exact moment of triumph."
