'''Gardolf Beorunna''' was the Thane of [[Ruathym]] and was known for being the father of [[Uthgar]]. Beorunna had other children, including [[Morgur]], for whom [[Morgur's Mound]] was named.

Gardolf met his end fighting a [[demon]] in the [[Druarwood]], where it was said in the final moments of the battle, the ground opened beneath their feet, plunging the two of them to their deaths. In his honor, the area was named  [[Beorunna's Well]].
