Marlyn "Luxor" Lurraxol was a human diviner and a barmaid at the Fierce Flumph tavern in Eshpurta, Amn, 
She was the niece of a member of the Lurraxol family of Athkatla, but was an outcast for some reason. 
At some point, Luxor relocated to Eshpurta and was known to the locals as Luxor. She was an ally of Sable, the Herald of Crimmor, Mikaal Krimmevol.
