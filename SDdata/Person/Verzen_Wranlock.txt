{{quote|''Oh what a joy it shall be to see their faces when they are caught in the act, and surrounded by dark cloaks.''|Verzen Wranlock}}

==Description==
Verzen was believed to be a person with an analytical mind and focus, judging by the tight and precise handwriting left behind in the Inquisitor's investigation notes ledger in Reithwin.

==History==
Verzen Wranlock died sometime before the fall of Reithwin and its consumption by the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]], before the {{Yearlink|1374}}. In life, Verzen sought and eradicated followers of Lady Shar's much-hated sister [[Sel没ne]] in Reithwin. Wranlock's last investigation sent the Inquisitor on a hunt for a hidden Sel没nite resistance cell after the town's complete fall into Shar worship. One of the prisoners in the [[Moonrise Towers]] revealed the information on the cell with some help from a thumbscrews torture device. It was revealed to Verzen that there was an abandoned river shore fishing hut where a potter once lived, and the shack was used as a place of worship to Sel没ne and a gathering place for her faithful. It was unknown if she was successful, but Verzen's dead body ended up on the ruined battlefield on the outskirts of Reithwin, where the army of Sharrans and [[Harper]]s clashed in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
