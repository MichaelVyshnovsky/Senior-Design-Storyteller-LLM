'''Mulser''' was a male warrior and a member of the [[Zhentilar]] in [[High Dale]].

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], Mulser was part of a secret [[Zhent]] occupation army in High Dale. However, his patrol was attacked and defeated by [[Elminster Aumar]] and [[Sharantyr]]. Before he died, Elminster pretended to be a [[Zhentarim]] lord and interrogated him to discover all the details of the Zhent plot against the dale.
