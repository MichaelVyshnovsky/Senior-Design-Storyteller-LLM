Shderra Dzeer was a young amethyst dragon who dwelled in the southern Highstar Lake on the High Moor in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She had now and then spoken to two copper dragons of the High Moor—the bad-tempered Aaronarra and very rarely the violent Carynnallerastis—and thought they were particularly foolish for the detrimental effect they had on the local ecology. On occasion, she distracted them from engaging in something especially damaging.
Shderra had talked more often with the local druid Bara. The two were in good agreement on environmental matters and Bara hoped she could persuade Shderra to help her preserve the High Moors ecology, but doubted the amethyst dragon would go so far as to fight for it. Otherwise, Bara thought the gem dragon was beautiful and lovely.
Shderra was settled on the High Moor and an acquaintance of Bara in the mid-1360s DR.
She was known to be still alive after the Dracorage of 1373 DR.
