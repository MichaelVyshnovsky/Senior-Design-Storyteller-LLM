        "mainbody": "'''Hesthera Draketalons''' was a high priestess of [[Tiamat]] in charge of her goddess's temple and operations at [[Castle Perilous]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Hesthera was the leader of the [[Handmaidens of the Undying Queen]], From there, she worked directly with her goddess's [[avatar]] to prepare to strike against [[Damara]] and its king, [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], who had humiliated Tiamat in 1359 DR and reinvigorated the worship of her rival, [[Bahamut]].",
        "History": "Tiamat's plans for Castle Perilous had been set in motion as early as the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, and Hesthera and her Handmaidens became the keepers of this outpost of the Church of Tiamat sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1370}}. As the leader and high priestess, Hesthera coordinated the collection of [[metallic dragon]] eggs and bodies to feed to her deity's terrible [[avatar]] and worked to undermine or convert members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].\n\nDuring the 1370s DR, the focus of her Handmaidens turned to the creation of [[dragonspawn]] by using the old laboratories of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] to create the monstrous crossbreeds."
