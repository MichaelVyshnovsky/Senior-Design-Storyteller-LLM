        "History": "When the [[Ashmadai]] overran Helm's Hold ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Aldwin ignored the warnings of his brother and remained in his home on [[Scar Alley]]. The [[devil]]-worshiping cultists briefly kidnapped the councilman, but were thwarted by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]], who was hired by Corlan.\n\nAfter the incident, Councilor Graves agreed to go into hiding, though it was believed to be more for the safety of his wife rather than his own well-being."
