'''Warsh''' was a boatman in the [[Moonsea]] region in [[1489 DR]].

==Personality==
Warsh was a greedy, foul-tempered old man. He mumbled when he spoke and often had his pipe clenched in his teeth, making it difficult to understand his speech. He was superstitious of outsiders.

==History==
Warsh lived in a small village on an isle near [[Phlan]]. He served as the boatman for people who wanted to travel to his village. He was one of the last original members of the group that forged the deep secret of the village.{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows over the Moonsea|13}}  The truth was that sixty years before, Warsh and the other villagers had invoked [[devil]] servants of [[Tiamat]] to enslave the pirate crew of [[Reeve Sar Testain]], who was menacing their village, in exchange for their souls and worship.{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows over the Moonsea|5-6}}
