        "mainbody": "'''Karazikar''' was a [[beholder]] living in the [[Wormwrithings]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Like all of its kind, Karazikar was arrogant, hateful, and paranoid. It plotted to seize the [[Maze Engine]].",
        "Relationship": "Karazikar had a mad but loyal [[human]] servant named [[Shedrak]].",
        "History": "Karazikar was a typical beholder until it met the last [[Great Modron March]]. Karazikar captured a [[pentadrone]] [[modron]] and discovered that the reality-shifting Maze Engine was somewhere in the [[Underdark]]. So its goal became to find and seize the engine. For this, Karazikar tried to capture as many modrons and similar creatures as possible. At one point, it captured an adventuring party, killed many of them. The survivor, Shedrak, became his favorite slave.\n\nKarazikar  was killed by an expedition led by some adventurers, hired by [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] to investigate the threat of the [[demon lord]]s. They were in need of the central eye of a beholder for a rite to banish the demon lords."
