'''Saisho''' was a [[wu jen]]/[[ninja]] adventurer in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Saisho was born in Miyama and as a child met and befriend [[Etsu-no-kami Makoto]]. Saisho's family died when he was very young and he was taken in by his uncle, a talented wu jen living in a ninja village. Saisho was taught magical skills by his uncle and ninja skills by the [[myusho]]. When a message arrived of the banishment of the [[Etsu]] family, Saisho escaped from the village to find his friend. 

In 1357 DR, Saisho had just met Makoto when they decided to return to Miyama. Meanwhile, Saisho's uncle sent letters saying he had forgiven him for his escape.
