        "mainbody": "Lady '''Arden Thurlow''' was a lady of fine breeding in an arranged marriage with the speaker of [[Lonelywood]], [[Baldemar Thurlow]] of the [[Ten Towns]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''We '''must''' hire some servants. Imagine... a lady of my breeding reduced to living in a shack. I cannot live in such squalor.''|Arden Thurlow}}",
        "Description": "Arden was a [[human]] woman with a fair complexion who wore the fanciful dresses of a noblewoman.",
        "Personality": "Lady Thurlow was a woman of refined taste and uppity attitude. Even though she lived in the largest home in Lonelywood at the time, she thought it to be a shack. She could not stand local riffraff tracking mud all over her expensive carpets. She did not enjoy boorish traveling merchants visiting her home to exchange [[coin]] with Baldemar.",
        "History": "Arden Thurlow entered an arranged marriage with Baldemar Thurlow, an opportunistic man, away from the freezing Icewind Dale. Baldemar was a cartwright who made a fortune by supplying caravan wagons for the costers in [[northwest Faerûn]]. She could have never imagined that the marriage would result in her living in the smallest of the frontier [[Ten Towns]]. By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Arden's husband took on the position of the representative of Lonelywood's merchants and tradesmen, a profitable stature that made him the town's speaker. Subsequently, the town of Lonelywood became menaced by a [[barbarian]] army led by [[Wylfdene]]. Instead of trying to settle the crisis peacefully, speaker Baldemar hired an [[assassin]] to end Wylfdene's life. [[Purvis]], the assassin, however, was unable to fulfill the contract. When the word of the assassin got out, the barbarian camp doubled the guard, making Wylfdene unreachable. As the adventurers investigated the threat, Wylfdene's true identity was revealed, and the barbarian was put to the sword. Unwilling to gain the reputation of a failure, Purvis assassinated Speaker Thurlow, Arden Thurlow, and just needed to finish off the last witnesses of his failure – the [[Heroes of Icewind Dale]]."
