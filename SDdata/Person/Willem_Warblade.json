        "mainbody": "'''Willem Warblade''' was a [[bloodforge]] mage in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).\n\nWillem forced a group of [[dwarf]] smiths out of their workshop in the [[Hall of Wonder (Utter East)|Hall of Wonder]] and moved in in their place. Thereafter, the dwarves hid in the foothills, angrily cursing the intruder. The [[Legendary Campaign]] leader discovered them there, then returned to the Hall of Wonder to evict Willem in a bloodforge battle."
