Rivrel almost never spoke.

==Relationships==
In [[Narnra Shalace]]'s recollection, her mother, [[Maerjanthra Shalace]], had five apprentices: [[Goraun]], [[Rorgel]], [[Jonczer]], [[Tantheld]], and Rivrel. She learned that at least one of them believed her mother to be a literal [[dragon]].{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|13|1}} Other than Rivrel, she could not confirm that any of them were dead, knowing only they disappeared after her mother's death.
