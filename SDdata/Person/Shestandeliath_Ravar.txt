}}'''Shestandeliath Ravar''' was a [[dragonborn]] [[wizard]]

==History==
Ravar was one of the few members of the [[Liberators of the Steel Sky]].

For some unknown reasons, Ravar wasn't present the day the Liberators were killed by a [[maurezhi]] granted to the [[God]]-King [[Gilgeam]]. However, on [[Nightal 19]] of 1486 DR, Ravar went to search for the maurezhi in the [[Catacombs (Djerad Thymar)|catacombs]] of [[Djerad Thymar]] and was killed in the ensuing battle, despite the aid of [[Yrjixtilex Kallan]] and [[Ilstan Nyaril]].
