Malphyss mother was the sun elf Chelryn Sarynnryllar and his father was the moon elf Rhyem Maraphiir. His sister was Ashemmi (born Shemithil Maraphiir).
Soon after Ashemmis birth in Silverymoon, the family moved to live with the wood elves in the Neverwinter Wood, and were taken in by the Ilbaereth house. Malphys gained an apprenticeship under Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun. Using the knowledge he gained in magic, he taught his sister Ashemmi, beginning from when she was around 80 years old.
