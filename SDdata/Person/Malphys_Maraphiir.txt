'''Malphys Maraphiir''' was an [[elf]] and the brother of the [[wizard]] [[Ashemmi]].{{Cite dragon/357/Volo's Guide: Renegades of Darkhold|74}}

==Relatives==
Malphys's mother was the [[sun elf]] [[Chelryn Sarynnryllar]] and his father was the [[moon elf]] [[Rhyem Maraphiir]]. His sister was [[Ashemmi]] (born Shemithil Maraphiir).

==History==
Soon after Ashemmi's birth in [[Silverymoon]], the family moved to live with the [[wood elf|wood elves]] in the [[Neverwinter Wood]], and were taken in by the [[Ilbaereth]] house. Malphys gained an apprenticeship under [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]]. Using the knowledge he gained in magic, he taught his sister Ashemmi, beginning from when she was around 80 years old.
