'''Draskos Crownsilver''' was a nobleman of [[Cormyr]] and a head of the [[Crownsilver]] family in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He had icy blue eyes, and his hair was going white at the temples. The man was burly and fierce-looking, but had good looks for a warrior.

==Relationships==
He was the patriarch of House [[Crownsilver]] and a rival of [[Marlin Stormserpent]].

==History==
In [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, [[Marlin Stormserpent]] paid the artist [[Jharakphred]] follow two people, Lord [[Gariskar Dauntinghorn]] and Draskos Crownsilver, and then paint a portrait of them. He continued to follow them for days, until he got roughed up by the noblemen's bodyguards. Marlin then set his two [[blueflame ghost]]s, [[Relve Langral]] and [[Treth Halonter]], to learn the men's likenesses from their portraits and so better identify and kill them.
