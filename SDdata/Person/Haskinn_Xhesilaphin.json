        "mainbody": "askinn Xhesilaphin was a renowned dragonborn alchemist and a writer, who lived sometime in the early-to-mid-15 century DR.\nHaskinn, in their youth, suffered a de-scaling, the incident that pushed them into the career of alchemy. Haskinn Xhesilaphin sought to discover a way to regrow the missing scales but often of themselves setting the research aside to aid some unfortunate commoners, something of which Haskinn wrote verbosely in their published works. Sometime later into their career, the dragonborn was convinced by Nikros that the formulas, research, notes, and the unedited contents of their journal needed to be published, after Haskinn encountered a poisoned human child in the Elfsong Tavern, while sipping on some hot cocoa.\nIn their many works, Haskinn relied on the most basic alchemical rule the Rule of Three, which was an integral part of many of their recipes. One such recipe was a simple healing potion recipe made with the salts of rogues morsel and a suspension of mergrass. This particular formula helped them soothe the damaged descaled hide that cracked and ripped with ease.\nBy the , Haskinn Xhesilaphins tome – Extracts – The Rule of Three, was considered the most comprehensive beginners guide to alchemy. The book was already in its 50 anniversary re-print with a special foreword penned by Adynn Ilvar. Their book titled On Antidotes was volume two of the Basics of Alchemy series. It featured a recipe for the basic antidote potion made using salts of mugwort and a suspension of bullywug trumpet. The Avernus Survival Guide was volume five of the series, On Weapon Coatings was volume ten, and Fiendish Alchemy was volume fourteen. Lastly, Haskinn Xhesilaphins chance encounter with a gnome and her guinea pig led Haskinn to develop a recipe for the elixir of barkskin using salts of gnarled tree bark and suspension of either mud mephit wing or laculite. The dragonborn was hopeful that by using that recipe, they would eventually be able to coat their body in platinum scales as the pain of the damaged hide was starting to become unbearable. Writing with their left hand was turning into a challenge, while the dragonborns right hand was seized in a claw of agony. In the final books they penned, On Serpent Venom Toxin and Recipe of Wyvern Toxin, its revealed that they ended up losing their mind and poisoning their close friend, Nikros, after the platinum scale plan failed to work out."
