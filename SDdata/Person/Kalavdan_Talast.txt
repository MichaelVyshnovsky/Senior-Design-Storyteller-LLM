Master Kalavdan Talast was a worshiper of Gond inhabiting Tulmon along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He was a thin man with a pronounced stoop to his posture.
Kalavdan was the high priest of the House of Cogs and Hammers which was one of Tulmons newer temples at that time. Kalavdan excelled at envisioning new creations.
