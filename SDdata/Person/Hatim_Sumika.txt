'''Hatim Sumika''' was a [[gnome]] scribe who lived in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|56-57}}

==Description==
Hatim stood 2 and a half feet tall.

==Activities==
Hatim's shop was located near the [[Bathhouses of Jisan of the Floods]]. The close proximity to the bathhouses gave him access to the merchants who frequented the establishment. They used Hatim's services for document production.

Hatim excelled at copying documents, including spellbooks. His eidetic memory allowed him to produce and forward documents to the city chancellor to review. Hatim loyally served the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] by gathering information for him.
