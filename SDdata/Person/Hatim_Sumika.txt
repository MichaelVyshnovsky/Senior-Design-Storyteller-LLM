Hatim Sumika was a gnome scribe who lived in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Hatim stood 2 and a half feet tall.
Hatims shop was located near the Bathhouses of Jisan of the Floods. The close proximity to the bathhouses gave him access to the merchants who frequented the establishment. They used Hatims services for document production.
Hatim excelled at copying documents, including spellbooks. His eidetic memory allowed him to produce and forward documents to the city chancellor to review. Hatim loyally served the Grand Caliph by gathering information for him.
