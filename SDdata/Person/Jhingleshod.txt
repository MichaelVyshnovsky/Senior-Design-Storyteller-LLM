'''Jhingleshod''' ({{Pronounce|JING|gul|shahd|refs= 

==Description==
From a distance, Jhingleshod appeared as a knight of the Realms, albeit in rust-stained armor. Upon closer examination however, his form resembled that of [[animated armor]], with skin formed of interlinking plates of [[iron]].

==Personality==
Since his own lifeforce was connected to Wulgreth, Jhingleshod could only truly die and be at rest when Wulgreth was no more.

Jhingleshod's unfortunate demeanor was a direct result of his tortured existence. As he roamed his woods, the Iron Axeman remained aloof and disconnected from others, save for when he saw opportunity to end it all, He remained suspicious of others that claimed they could release him from his curse, fearful of and threatened by the inevitability of being tricked once again.

==Possessions==
He always carried with him a massive [[axe]], a weapon that was too unwieldy for most mortal men.

==Abilities==
Jhingleshod was all-but indestructible while the undead Wulgreth remained on Toril. His iron-formed body could reform itself as if he were mere pieces of metallic clay being combined together.

==Activities==
{{Quote|I've never been beyond the [[Pale Ring]], but no need to worry. Jhingleshod will find ''us''.|[[Takari Moonsnow]] to [[Malik el Sami]].}}

As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, Jhingleshod spent his entire existence roaming around the [[Dire Wood]] searching for some means to destroy Wulgreth and finally achieve peace.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|883}}, Jhingleshod left [[Hellgate Keep]] with his master Wulgreth, who was fleeing from the influx of [[fiend]]s. They traveled to the ruins of [[Karse]] where Wulgreth hoped to gain power from the [[Karsus Butte|petrified body]] of [[Karsus]]. While in the midst of casting a powerful [[epic magic|epic spell]], Jhingleshod turned on his master and slew him to prevent him from summoning more fiends. a patch of petrified trees that became overrun with undead.

The undead mage hunted Jhingleshod down and punished his former servant by torturing him until death. 

===Undeath===
{{Quote|There is a boon I would ask for my help, elf. Will you give it?|Jhingleshod.}}
Just as his master, Jhingleshod arose as an undead monstrosity,

In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Jhingleshod encountered the [[Evereska]]n [[Evereskan tomb guardian|tomb guardian]] [[Galaeron Nihmedu]], along with his companions [[Vala Thorsdotter]], [[Melegaunt Tanthul]], and [[Malik el Sami]], as the group passed through the Dire Wood. After assessing Galaeron's character, Jhingleshod offered him a bargain: he would guide the elf and his allies to the ''[[Karsestone]]'' in exchange for their help in destroying Wulgrath.

Jhingelshod and his companions traveled for some distance and eventually arrived at a black pyramid set atop the [[Karsus Butte]], the petrified remains of the [[Karsus|ascended arcanist]] after which it was named. After venturing within, they destroyed a [[demilich]] hoping it to be the remains of Wulgreth. Unfortunately they were mistaken, as the undead remains were merely those of an ancient [[sharn]] imprisoned within. 

Just as Jhingelshod resigned their efforts to failure, the lich Wulgrenth ambushed them just as they entered the chamber with the ''Karsestone''. A fierce battle broke out and eventually Galaeron cleaved the lich's skull in half. At Jhingleshod's direction, they gathered its remains and began the search for his phylactery. After staying overnight within the black pyramid and having no luck with their search, it gradually dawned on nearly all the members of the group the ''Karsestone'' itself was Wulgreth's phylactery. Cursed by [[Mystra]] to always speak the truth, Malik inadvertently shared this revelation out loud, triggering Jhingleshod's paranoia and rage. 

Believing they wanted to steal the ''Karsestone'' with no intent of helping destroy Wulgreth, Jhingleshod attacked them all and nearly killed Vala. Galaeron drew upon the [[whole magic]] that permeated the ''Karsestone'' and shot a beam of gold energy, blasting the Iron Axeman in half. That was not enough to stop Jhingleshod, as his top half clung on to Galaeron as both they and the ''Karsestone'' shot out of Karsus' remains into the pool below. Jhingleshod's two halves reformed just as the ''Karsestone'' ascended into the skies and [[Return of the Archwizards (event)#The Return|a mountain descended in its place]]. Jhingleshod's ultimate fate was unknown however, as it was believed that Wulgreth's undead remains were already reforming within the stone corpse of Karse.
