        "History": "Horquine spent years attempting to breed a variety of [[azmyth]] that would eat the fyreflies in Cormanthor. The fyreflies were causing problems by igniting large parts of the forest, and although the Horquine azmyth were able to consume triple of their won weight in fyreflies, they hardly affected the bug population. Furthermore, the could not digest the abdomens, the source of the flames, and so they were forced to spit them out in a ball of fire."
