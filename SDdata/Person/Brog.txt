'''Brog''' was an [[orc]] warrior from [[Many-Arrows]] who lived in [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Brog was a regular of [[the Fallen Tower]] tavern. As of [[1479 DR]], he was the champion of the tavern's arm-wrestling and drinking contests. Brog was the only known orc able to withstand a full tankard of [[Vagdru One-Ear]]'s homemade beer.{{Cite dungeon/193/Shards of Selûne|39}}
