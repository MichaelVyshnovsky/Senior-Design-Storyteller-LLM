        "mainbody": "Duke '''William Horgath''', most commonly know as '''William the Lazy''', was the eighth duke of [[Arcata]] in [[Damara]] in [[1357 DR]] and [[1359 DR]].",
        "History": "In 1357 William the Lazy, in league with the [[Grandfather of Assassins]], gathered an army to conquer the [[Barony of Bloodstone]]. However his troops were defeated by the Bloodstone army led by [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]. He surrendered to Gareth that imposed to him no penalties.\nAt [[1359 DR]] William was deeply unpopular in his own lands, so much so that in the mining village of [[Sudrav]], it was not uncommon for effigies of him to be burned."
