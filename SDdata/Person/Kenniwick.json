        "mainbody": "Kenniwick was a merchant visiting the town of Wheloon in Cormyr in the 1370s DR.\nIn the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Kenniwick visited the new Temple of Mystra and was among a group of people who partook in the three-day-long ritual of Mystras Sacred Trust that the priests there were pushing, alongside eleven others Durgen Glintstone, Kareem Hastith, Smote, Tholwick Styles, Dava, Mendios, Zephan, Veera Wavecrest, Halish, Duncan, and Amnic Basult. In the end, Starweaver Deinyn Fembrys dominated all of them with the Starry Gnosis, abducting them as part of a secret Sharran plot.\nHowever, Kenniwick either resisted the effect or was deemed unsuitable, lacking any magical ability. Kenniwick, Duncan, and Amnic were tortured to death on a rack by Fembrys, then beheaded and had their heads stuffed and mounted in the mad priests room. Eventually, on Eleint 6, investigators found their bodies and identified them by their possessions.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryMerchants\nCategoryInhabitants of Cormyr\nCategoryInhabitants of Interior Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands\nb69n2j6qv58ki3242qq1d7ww3xlto72"
