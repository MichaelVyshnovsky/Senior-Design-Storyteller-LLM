'''Zofia''' (often named with her title as Zofia Othlor, which meant "elder among witches") was one of the [[Witches of Rashemen]] and an oracle and elder of the witches in her community in [[Dernovia]], [[Rashemen]].

==Description==
Zofia was old and plump and had blue eyes.

==History==
In [[1360 DR]], after the [[Immil Dale|Battle of Immil Dale]], Zofia deemed Fyodor a ''nydeshka'' ("blunt sword," meaning he was dangerous to others), but rather than sending him to his death, she gave him the quest to return the [[Windwalker (artifact)|Windwalker]] amulet to Rashemen.

==Relationships==
Zofia had a twin sister, [[Zhanna]]. who bore the [[Mask of Danigar]] and who was killed at the [[Watchtower]] by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] in [[1360 DR]].

Zofia's eldest son was [[Mahryon]], who was killed at the Battle of Immil Dale. His son was [[Fyodor]], who was thus Zofia's own grandson.

Zofia had been acquainted with [[Sylune]], Witch of Shadowdale, before her passing.
