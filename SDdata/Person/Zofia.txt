Zofia (often named with her title as Zofia Othlor, which meant "elder among witches") was one of the Witches of Rashemen and an oracle and elder of the witches in her community in Dernovia, Rashemen.
Zofia was old and plump and had blue eyes.
In 1360 DR, after the Battle of Immil Dale, Zofia deemed Fyodor a nydeshka ("blunt sword," meaning he was dangerous to others), but rather than sending him to his death, she gave him the quest to return the Windwalker amulet to Rashemen.
Zofia had a twin sister, Zhanna. who bore the Mask of Danigar and who was killed at the Watchtower by the Red Wizards of Thay in 1360 DR.
Zofias eldest son was Mahryon, who was killed at the Battle of Immil Dale. His son was Fyodor, who was thus Zofias own grandson.
Zofia had been acquainted with Sylune, Witch of Shadowdale, before her passing.
