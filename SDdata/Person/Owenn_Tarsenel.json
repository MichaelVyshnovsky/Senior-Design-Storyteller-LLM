        "mainbody": "'''Owenn Tarsenel''' was the innkeeper of the [[Luskan Arms]] inn in [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He was quiet and balding.",
        "Activities": "Owing to the inn's theme, Owenn had scraps of knowledge about [[Luskan]], but it had all been passed down from his father or learned from guests at the inn who'd been through Luskan.",
        "History": "During [[Auril]]'s unending winter in [[1488 DR]] and [[1489 DR]], Owenn was afraid that summer was gone forever from Icewind Dale, and so became deeply depressed."
