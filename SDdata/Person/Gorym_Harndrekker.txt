'''Gorym Harndrekker''' was a battle priest of [[Tempus]] and the acting Priest-General of the [[Abbey of the Sword]] as of [[1372 DR]].  Formerly a skilled fighter, his advancing age and an encounter with [[wraith]]s greatly diminished his physical prowess.  He was best known as a master military strategist.
