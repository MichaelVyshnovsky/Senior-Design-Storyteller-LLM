        "mainbody": "Frostbite was a white dragon wyrmling that inhabited caves within the Wyrms Tooth glacier atop the Spine of the World in the late 13 century DR.\nBefitting his youth and the savagery of his race, Frostbite considered both humans and demihumans to be nothing more than food and felt no remorse towards eating them. Whenever he spoke Common it came out in a very broken form.\nFrostbite held a gemstone in his possession.\nSome time in 1281 DR, the frost giant Joril Frostbeard convinced Frostbite and the rest of his pack of white wyrms to feign death and then kill his unsuspecting father Kreg Frostbeard so that he could assume control over his tribe. In return for their cooperation, Joril regularly fed them the human and demihuman slaves that his tribe shared with the glaciers intelligent salamanders, much to the chagrin of some members of his tribe.\nFrostbite and his pack of white wyrms lived in a tense sort of peace alongside the frost giants within Wyrms Tooth glacier."
