        "mainbody": "'''Frostbite''' was a [[white dragon]] [[wyrmling]] that inhabited caves within the [[Dorn's Deep|Wyrm's Tooth glacier]] atop the [[Spine of the World]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Befitting his youth and the savagery of his race, Frostbite considered both [[human]]s and [[demihuman]]s to be nothing more than food and felt no remorse towards eating them. Whenever he spoke [[Common]] it came out in a very broken form.",
        "Possessions": "Frostbite held a [[gemstone]] in his possession.",
        "History": "Some time in [[1281 DR]], the [[frost giant]] [[Joril Frostbeard]] convinced Frostbite and the rest of his pack of white wyrms to feign death and then kill his unsuspecting father [[Kreg Frostbeard]] so that he could assume control over his tribe. In return for their cooperation, Joril regularly fed them the human and demihuman slaves that his tribe shared with the glacier's intelligent [[salamander]]s, much to the chagrin of some members of his tribe.",
        "Relationships": "Frostbite and his pack of white wyrms lived in a tense sort of peace alongside the frost giants within Wyrm's Tooth glacier."
