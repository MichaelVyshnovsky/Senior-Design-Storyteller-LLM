        "mainbody": "Cyric, Myrkul\nDeep Elder Doom Haaeluth Muribaert was a priest who led the Conclave of Doom in the Skullspire in the town of Tulmon on the Lake of Steam in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHaaeluth was said to be very old man of poor health with a cold-heart. Despite his age, his mind was very sharp.\nPrior to 1358 DR, Muribaert chaired the Conclave of Doom, which trained and directed the lesser members of the Church of Myrkul. When Cyric took over following the Time of Troubles, the church smoothly converted to the worship of him. Ten years later, the church moved on to the worship of Kelemvor. Muribaert was still under control at this time."
