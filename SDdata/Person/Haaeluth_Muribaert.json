        "mainbody": "[[Deep Elder Doom]] '''Haaeluth Muribaert''' was a [[priest]] who led the [[Conclave of Doom]] in the [[Skullspire]] in the town of [[Tulmon]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Haaeluth was said to be very old man of poor health with a cold-heart. Despite his age, his mind was very sharp.",
        "History": "Prior to [[1358 DR]], Muribaert chaired the Conclave of Doom, which trained and directed the lesser members of the [[Church of Myrkul]]. When [[Cyric]] took over following the [[Time of Troubles]], the church smoothly converted to the worship of him. Ten years later, the church moved on to the worship of [[Kelemvor]]. Muribaert was still under control at this time."
