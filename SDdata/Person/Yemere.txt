Yemere was a steel dragon who lived in the disguise of a young windsoul genasi in Akanûl.  He was a participant in the draconic game of Xorvintaal and was allied with the gray dragon Vairshekellabex.  Yemere traveled with Aoth Fezims expedition into the Akanapeaks to kill Vairshekellabex.  He charmed a young stormsoul genasi named Son-liin and forced her to take actions to harm the expedition.	
One night, Gaedynn Ulraes remained awake all night and followed Son-liin to her rendezvous with Yemere where he attacked the dragon.  Yemere nearly defeated Gaedynn but Aoth heard the fighting and brought his genasi allies and together they killed Yemere.
