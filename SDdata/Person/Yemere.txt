'''Yemere''' was a [[steel dragon]] who lived in the disguise of a young [[windsoul genasi]] in [[Akan没l]].  He was a participant in the [[dragon|draconic]] game of [[Xorvintaal]] and was allied with the [[gray dragon]] [[Vairshekellabex]].  Yemere traveled with [[Aoth Fezim|Aoth Fezim's]] expedition into the [[Akanapeaks]] to kill Vairshekellabex.  He charmed a young [[stormsoul genasi]] named [[Son-liin]] and forced her to take actions to harm the expedition.	

One night, [[Gaedynn Ulraes]] remained awake all night and followed Son-liin to her rendezvous with Yemere where he attacked the dragon.  Yemere nearly defeated Gaedynn but Aoth heard the fighting and brought his genasi allies and together they killed Yemere.
