        "mainbody": "human\nMordoc SeLanmere, also known as the Pale Knight or the White Prince, was the self-proclaimed first and most powerful vampire king in all of Toril.\nMordoc was the disciple of Eldrith the Betrayer, but he was not a loyal servant to her. He did provide her with slaves and fighters for her army.\nMordoc also proved himself to be an excellent alchemist.\nMordoc, after becoming the king of the vampires, led his army of vampires, nightwalkers, and nightshades into the Battle of Bones, where they began to thrive. Just outside, or at the edge, of the battlefield, Mordoc built the Keep of Pale Night where his vampire servants lived with him. At one time, the assassin Karne was sent to slay him, but Mordoc defeated Karne in battle and appeared to kill him instead. Karne however, had found his mortal enemy and had feigned his death.\nMordoc then pledged his allegiance to Eldrith the Betrayer, though his true masters lay in Mulhorand. Mordocs ultimate goal was to destroy the city of Baldurs Gate and through Eldrith, he hoped to achieve this. He assisted Eldrith by supplying the troops of the Dark Alliance. Later, an agent of Karne in Xantams thieves guild posed as a servant of Eldrith and tricked him into building for him the Orb of the Undead, which was used to animate the dead in the Crypts of Ilmater in Baldurs Gate.\nWhen Vahn, Kromlech, and Adrianna killed Eldrith and used a shadow gate to escape the Onyx Tower, Mordoc was overjoyed as he was now the ruler of the Onyx Tower. Mordoc informed his allies in Mulhorand of the delay and informed them of his plan to move the Onyx Tower to Baldurs Gate to destroy the city.\nWhen the Harpers activated all the elemental foundations to activate the tower and thus hope to seal it, Mordoc gained access to the tower. However, Karne discovered Mordocs plan and with his enemies, the Harpers Jherek, Dorn Redbear, Allessia Faithhammer, Ysuran Auondril, Borador Goldhand, and Vhaidra Uoswiir, the Keep of Pale Night was infiltrated.\nKarne then freed Vahn, Kromlech, and Adrianna from Mordocs holds and with Jherek, he stayed behind to fend off Mordocs zombies, mummies, and shadow creatures. The eight adventurers fought Mordoc and bested him in battle causing him, weakened, to flee and move the Onyx Tower to Baldurs Gate.\nMordoc used the Onyx Heart to transform the citizens of Baldurs Gate into zombies under his control, while his vampires transformed other citizens into vampires. The soldiers outside of Baldurs Gate launched a desperate attack against the undead. Mordoc renamed Baldurs Gate to Mordocs Gate and to allow his allies from Mulhorand to enter the Onyx Tower, he added an entrance to it. While it took the eight adventurers, Karne and Jherek about a month to enter Mordocs Gate, their appearance changed the tide of the battle.\nKarne and Jherek assisted the soldiers of Baldurs Gate in their battle against the zombies, while Dorn Redbear defeated the vampiric form of Randalla Brasshorn, the lieutenant of Mordocs general Xanhast. The eight adventurers then entered the Onyx Tower through its newly added entrance, a small weakness that would bring his downfall. They advanced through the Onyx Tower and eventually through the final shadow gate, which had been restructured to go to the Plane of Shadow.\nThe eight adventurers once again battled Mordoc, who had become nearly as powerful as a god. But they managed to kill him, leaving one of them entitled to the leadership of the Onyx Tower. However, they decided to destroy the Onyx Heart, which in turn broke the elemental foundations, destroying the Onyx Tower and restoring Baldurs Gate to the way it was.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Mordocs bust was displayed in the manse of Cazador Szarr, a vampire lord, and a patriar of Baldurs Gate."
