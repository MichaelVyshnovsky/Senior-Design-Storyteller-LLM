        "mainbody": "Razak Irdi was a barbarian nomad and member of the Kashghun tribe in the Plain of Horses circa . He was a notorious horse rustler.\nIrdi lived in the city of Chegoyui in the Quoya Desert until around , when he stole one of the most valuable huluk horses belonging to the qaghan. He fled north and remained apart ever since.\nIrdi lived as a lone nomad, sleeping through the day and moving at night, never settling anywhere, and avoiding contact with his fellow humans. In fact, he preferred the company of wild horses and always traveled with a herd of wild horses, numbering 20â€“50, as well as twelve wild dogs. His own mount was a black huluk named Dohju. All these beasts seemed completely obedient and dedicated to their master. \nOccasionally, he conducted thefts and raids on camps in order to free horses from their owners. Naturally, he was seen as a thief and a pest and many times people had tried to apprehend Irdi but with no success.\nHe had a small build but thick legs. His eyes were described as darting."
