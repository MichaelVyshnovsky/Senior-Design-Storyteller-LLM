        "mainbody": "'''Razak Irdi''' was a [[barbarian]] nomad and member of the [[Kashghun]] tribe in the [[Plain of Horses]] ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}. He was a notorious [[horse]] rustler.",
        "History": "Irdi lived in the city of [[Chegoyui]] in the [[Quoya Desert]] until around {{YearlinkConvert|2600|SY}}, when he stole one of the most valuable ''[[huluk]]'' horses belonging to the ''qaghan''. He fled north and remained apart ever since.",
        "Activities": "Irdi lived as a lone nomad, sleeping through the day and moving at night, never settling anywhere, and avoiding contact with his fellow [[human]]s. In fact, he preferred the company of wild horses and always traveled with a herd of wild horses, numbering 20â€“50, as well as twelve wild [[dog]]s. His own mount was a black ''huluk'' named [[Dohju]]. All these beasts seemed completely obedient and dedicated to their master. \n\nOccasionally, he conducted thefts and raids on camps in order to free horses from their owners. Naturally, he was seen as a thief and a pest and many times people had tried to apprehend Irdi but with no success.",
        "Description": "He had a small build but thick legs. His eyes were described as darting."
