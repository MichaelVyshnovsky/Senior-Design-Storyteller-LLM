Flameran Verminbane was a halfling during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Flameran worked in the great Dellmon farm in the Dessarin Valley. He was also an agent of the Emerald Enclave.
In 1491 DR, the Iceshield orcs attacked many farms around the Dellmon property. However, Kerbin Dellmon refused to abandon his farm and flee to Yartar, instead deciding to fight with the aid of his family and workers, including Flameran. Flameran helped Dreena Dellmon to ask the help of the elves of the High Forest. With the lucky arrival of some adventurers, the Dellmons managed to defend the farm.
