'''Daidoji Rakan''' was a [[samurai]] retainer of the [[Niwa clan]] and also a [[jito]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
He controlled affairs in [[Takeo]] village in the center of a very beautiful Niwa [[Kozakuran dictionary#S|''shoen'']].

==Personality==
Despite his age, Rakan was far from being frail or senile. He remained a formidable figure capable of leading armies, taming horses, swimming across rivers, and mastering the art of the sword as effectively as anyone in their prime. He carried a deep respect for his duties and personal capabilities, showing little patience for any remarks that hinted at his age or perceived weaknesses, which he viewed as outright disrespect.
