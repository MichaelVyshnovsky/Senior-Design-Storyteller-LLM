Daidoji Rakan was a samurai retainer of the Niwa clan and also a jito in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
He controlled affairs in Takeo village in the center of a very beautiful Niwa shoen.
Despite his age, Rakan was far from being frail or senile. He remained a formidable figure capable of leading armies, taming horses, swimming across rivers, and mastering the art of the sword as effectively as anyone in their prime. He carried a deep respect for his duties and personal capabilities, showing little patience for any remarks that hinted at his age or perceived weaknesses, which he viewed as outright disrespect.
