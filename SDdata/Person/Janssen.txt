'''Janssen''' was a retired [[bard]] inhabiting the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Though not quite a [[sage]], Janssen was a valuable source of information regarding anything about the [[High Forest]] region. He could usually be found at the [[Lady Luck Tavern]], raising his drink and boisterously starting a new round of song.

He lived in a house in the south section of Daggerford on [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]] near the barracks.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
