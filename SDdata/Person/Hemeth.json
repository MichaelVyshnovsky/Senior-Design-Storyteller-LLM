        "mainbody": "Hemeth was a duergar arms dealer from Gracklstugh in the late 15 century DR.\nCirca 1486 DR, the dwarf heard that the village of Sloobludop had started a civil war, so he went there in order to sell his weapons to both factions. However, Hemeth was captured by cultists, led by Bloppblippodd, who wanted to sacrifice him to a new god named Leemooggoogoon, the Deep Father (who was, in truth, the demon lord Demogorgon)."
