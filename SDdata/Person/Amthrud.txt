'''Amthrud''' was a [[Zhentarim|Zhentish]] merchant and spy who operated in [[Thentia]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Activities==
Amthrud operated a legitimate business as a map and chart merchant in Thentia, but also collaborated with fellow spy [[Beldergast]] in discovering ways for [[Zhentil Keep]] to overtake the city through economic means. Despite being loyal and trying his best, they had no tangible results to report and could only give their superiors promises of future success. Worse, his secret activities were known to several Thentians, including the eccentric trader [[Melyrk Rubyripper]].

Amthrud had a retinue of three experienced [[wizard]]s and six veteran [[fighter|men-at-arms]] to protect him from danger.
