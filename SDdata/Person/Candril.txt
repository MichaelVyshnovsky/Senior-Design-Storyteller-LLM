'''Candril''' was a member of the [[Adventurer's Guild (Crossroad Keep)|Adventurer's Guild]] of the [[Crossroad Keep]] and a member of [[Daerred]]'s adventuring group in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Candril was an [[elf|elven]] woman with striking green eyes and blonde, almost white, hair. She wore a flower in her hair and was dressed in a hunter's garb, with an [[arrow]]-filled [[quiver]] at her back.

==History==
Candril and her companions claimed to had trained in the art of adventuring under the illustrious Knight-Captain, also known as the [[Kalach-Cha]]. When the troupe leader, Daerred, was granted permission to open his guild in the fortress of the Crossroad Keep, she joined the rest of her traveling companions. Together, they dreamed of opening the greatest adventuring school on the [[Sword Coast]], passing along all things they learned from the Knight-Captain to the next generation of heroes. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Candril could be found in the Adventurer's Guildhall, offering training, paying out monster bounties, and purchased monster parts of value from hunters and adventurers.
