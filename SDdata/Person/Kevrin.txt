{{Quote|If Shan says it, I believe it.|Kevrin}}
'''Kevrin''' was a male [[Chondathan]] [[human]] [[sorcerer]] who dwelled at the [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]], [[Cormyr]], in the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]].

==Activities==
Kevrin whiled away his days in his quarters, which he shared with [[Shan Thar]], idly reading books on outdated magical theory and nursing strong liquor.

In the evenings, he assisted in the nightly stargazing ceremonies in the temple's outer courtyard, casting ''[[silent image]]'' to create illusions of brightened stars and animated constellations overheard as Shan Thar named and revered the astronomical bodies.

==History==
Kevrin was a man who did ill in his past, and to soothe his conscience he offered his services to the new Temple of Mystra in Wheloon.

==Personality==
Kevrin had a rather dour and resigned personality, but was a devout follower of [[Mystra]] and greatly trusting of the priests at the temple. He was rather tough.

==Description==
Kevrin had a rather haggard appearance and wore dark grey robes.
