Kevrin was a male Chondathan human sorcerer who dwelled at the Temple of Mystra in Wheloon, Cormyr, in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR.
Kevrin whiled away his days in his quarters, which he shared with Shan Thar, idly reading books on outdated magical theory and nursing strong liquor.
In the evenings, he assisted in the nightly stargazing ceremonies in the temples outer courtyard, casting silent image to create illusions of brightened stars and animated constellations overheard as Shan Thar named and revered the astronomical bodies.
Kevrin was a man who did ill in his past, and to soothe his conscience he offered his services to the new Temple of Mystra in Wheloon.
Kevrin had a rather dour and resigned personality, but was a devout follower of Mystra and greatly trusting of the priests at the temple. He was rather tough.
Kevrin had a rather haggard appearance and wore dark grey robes.
