'''Golin''' was a trapper from the town of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]], who ran a modest trapping business and traded with the [[Merchant House]] alongside his brothers in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Like his siblings, Golin had short-cropped brown hair and brown eyes.

==Relationships==
Golin had two brothers, [[Borin]], and the youngest among the three, [[Chad (trapper)|Chad]]. The brothers were acquainted with the retired [[half-orc]] [[fighter]] named [[Chester Hearth]], who frequented the [[Golden Goblet Inn]] in Mossbridges. They considered the fighter to be a talented trapper and thought him to be a fine fellow despite being a half-orc. At one point, the siblings' [[dog]] was denied breeding with Chester's powerful [[moorhound]] named [[Suzzane]].

==History==
When the Golden Goblet Inn was established in the late 14{{th}} century DR, after [[The Three Women War]], Golin and his brothers became frequent patrons of [[Georgio]]'s fine establishment. The family celebrated Chad's 20{{th}} birthday at the Goblet.
