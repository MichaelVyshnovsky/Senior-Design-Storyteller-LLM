        "mainbody": "'''Onskrar Hammershield''' was the Shieldlord (governor) of the city of [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], from the [[374 DR|Year of the Thoughtful Man, 374 DR]], to the [[424 DR|Year of the Ambitious Sycophant, 424 DR]].",
        "History": "Hammershield was appointed Shieldlord of Khôltar by the dwarves of the [[Deep Realm]] after the previous Shieldlord, [[Amberu Khôltar]], was assassinated in a failed attempt to implicate the [[human]] population of the city and cause strife. One of his first acts was to calm the outraged citizens by forming an advisory council that could draft laws for his approval and give guidance in matters related to public works and governance. No such organization had existed under Amberu's rule.\n\nThe council originally had twelve old and experienced human crafters, four dwarves, two [[gnomes]], and a [[halfling]], plus eight seasonal appointees. Over the next two hundred years, this governor's council evolved into what became known as the [[Onsruur]], but Onskrar did not live to see it (or prevent it). Tragically, he was killed while inspecting a tower that had been built by a group of humans&mdash;the building accidentally collapsed while he was touring inside with no evidence of foul play. Shortly thereafter, [[Gonth Forgegold|Gonth \"Merrybelt\" Forgegold]] was appointed to replace him."
