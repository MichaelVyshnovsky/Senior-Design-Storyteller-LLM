'''Iyrith Telgahlagar''' was a [[Zulkir]] of [[Enchantment]] sometime ''circa'' late [[1300 DR]] and was the closest thing to the true leader of [[Thay]] at the time.

==Description==
Iyrith was a dark-featured and bearded handsome Thayan [[human]] man. He was courteous, polite, and soft-spoken.

==Abilities==
The zulkir was ruthless when it came to disposing of his foes. Iyrith dispensed magical punishment through flying [[bat]]s.

==History==
Iyrith Telgahlagar claimed the title of the Zullkir of Abjuration sometime before the late {{YearlinkName|1300}}. He was listed among several zulkir names that became widely known after being identified and described in the [[book]] called ''[[Twelve Winters Under the Lash]]'', penned by an anonymous slave and smuggled out of Thay sometime in late 1300 DR. Iyrith Telgahlagar earned his status through expert strategy and diplomacy. His statecraft gained him numerous alliances among fellow zulkirs and [[tharchion]]s.
