He could have ten be found alongside his friend, throwing jabs at each other. In 1369 DR, a huge [[Planar Sphere]] crash-landed in the vicinity of the [[Copper Coronet]]. Brelm, under the influence of nine pitchers of Turmishan [[whisky]], decided to investigate the strange structure but, like many others, failed to find a way in. The dwarf continued gossiping with Ribald about the sphere."
