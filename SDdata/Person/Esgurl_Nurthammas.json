As per his role, he was an expert at constructing and maintaining public stonework, such as bridges and roads. He, however, did not operate on drains, city walls, or underways.\nThe master was nervous and eager to please. Belonging to quite a poor patiar family, he hoped to impress during his post as the Master of Cobbles, in order to become part of the Parliament of Peers.\nIn 1482 DR, six noble youths vandalized the Beloved Ranger. The Master of Cobbles was livid, and planned to offer a 150 gp reward to those who tracked down and seized the criminals. He recklessly stated to to want the vandals to \"pay with their souls\", but did not have the authority to sanction such a harsh punishment."
