        "mainbody": "Thalaumbur was a wealthy merchant in the city of Waterdeep in the 11 century DR.\nThalaumbur was known be a rather cold and calculating character, what some might describe as villainous.\nThalaumbur made multiple attempts to earn the title of nobility in Waterdeep, but was repeatedly shunned.\nIn life Thalaumbur owned a block of buildings in Waterdeep that were enclosed by Sulmor Street and (what would later be named) Thalaumburs Trot. At some point he attempted to acquire lichdom by purchasing it from someone, though his ultimate fate after this was unknown."
