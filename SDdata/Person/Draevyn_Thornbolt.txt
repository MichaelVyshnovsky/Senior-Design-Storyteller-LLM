Draevyn Thornbolt was an albino wizard in Neverwinter sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Draevyn was a captain on the employ of Dagult Neverember, captaining the Seabreaker. He had an affable half-orc brute as a first mate. He always dressed impeccably.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Draevyn was hired to accompany an adventuring party to Svardborg.
