        "mainbody": "Sovereign '''Spaw''' was the ruler of [[Ebonlake Grotto]], a [[myconid]] community in the [[Underdark]] situated near the [[Ebonlake]].",
        "Abilities": "Spaw could communicate to non-myconid by use of spore clouds that lingered around Ebonlake Grotto.\n\nIt also had the ability to raise the bodies of the dead as [[spore servant]]s, [[zombie]]-like husks that served as mindless followers and protectors.",
        "Possessions": "Spaw kept a treasury in Ebonlake Grotto, which house the powerful [[drow]] item, ''[[Shadow of Menzoberranzan]]''.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[duergar]]s aligned with the [[cult of the Absolute]] raided the Ebonlake Grotto and slew many of the myconid's young. Spaw raised several of the raiders as spore servants and sought out ways to take out vengeance on the cult and its duergar slavers. Spaw also offered safe haven to the [[deep gnome|gnome]] woman [[Thulla]], who was grievously injured by the raiders.\n\nThe duergar also attacked the myconid sovereign [[Glut]], and destroyed its entire circle. Spaw received an appeal for aid from Glut, but chose to ignore its requests outright."
