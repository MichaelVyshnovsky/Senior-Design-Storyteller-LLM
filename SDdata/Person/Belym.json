        "mainbody": "'''Belym''' was a citizen of [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "He had a husband named [[Draza]].",
        "History": "Around the same time as the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} Draza was arrested for theft and sentenced to [[Executioner's Run]]. This led a distraught Belym to try and persuade anyone in authority that his husband had been mistakenly convicted without a proper trial, but he was unable to convince anyone of this. Just as Draza was about to be thrown into the Run with a pair of [[velociraptor]]s, Belym turned to [[adventurer]]s, offering them all of his meager savings to help or protect Draza from the sidelines."
