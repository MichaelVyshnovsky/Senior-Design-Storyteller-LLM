'''Santrin "the Skilled"''' was a [[gnome]] man living in [[Calaunt]] in [[the Vast]]. 

Around [[1358 DR]], he was a noted carver of [[amber]], [[ivory]], [[jade]], [[obsidian]], and fine [[wood]], producing extremely fine and beautiful inlays. Though very expensive, his work was famous around the [[Dragon Reach]], and he had a very long backlog of orders.
