'''Durdyn Teh'kinrellz''' was the [[weapon master]] of [[House Teh'Kinrellz]] of [[Ched Nasad]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Durdyn took on the female commoner, [[Relirva Indagley'Belash]], and she served under him. He gave her the opportunity to study creatures around Ched Nasad, such as [[choldrith]] and [[chitine]]s. Her efforts led to the death of a rival houses's secondboy, and she was granted greater privileges by her house.
