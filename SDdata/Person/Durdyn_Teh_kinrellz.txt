Durdyn Tehkinrellz was the weapon master of House TehKinrellz of Ched Nasad in 1370 DR.
Durdyn took on the female commoner, Relirva IndagleyBelash, and she served under him. He gave her the opportunity to study creatures around Ched Nasad, such as choldrith and chitines. Her efforts led to the death of a rival housess secondboy, and she was granted greater privileges by her house.
