Abordabe was the chieftain of the largest tribe in Narfell in 1359 DR, the Adordabe.
Abordabe supervised the massive Trade Fair each summer. All his tribesmen considered him the best warrior of Narfell and few tried to challenge him.
Abordabe was an honorable individual, wise and tolerant to outsiders (for a Nar). However, he did not want to abandon power despite his old age.
