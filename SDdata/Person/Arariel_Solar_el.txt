Arariel Solarel was a warrior of the Solarel Clan in Luskan during the late 15 century DR. 
Arariel was the second daughter in her family. As she was her parents favorite daughter, and considered different within her clan, she was gifted with the Dagger of Clan Solarel.
Around 1487 DR, Arariel attacked the Champion of the Burning Dawn in the slums of Luskan, but was slain by their party.
