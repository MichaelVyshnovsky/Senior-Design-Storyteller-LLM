        "mainbody": "Bilnur Faerglamer was the Magister from  to .\nShort and rotund, Bilnur wore spectacles.\nHe was reclusive and mumbled to himself.\nBilnur was the only known user of a \"flytrap\" spell that swallowed its foes with airborne spectral jaws.\nBilnur owned a large house, Faerglamer House, and had been the creator of hundreds of pairs of Faerglamer gauntlets. He crammed the place with constructed guardians resembling suits of armor that were probably more powerful than helmed horrors, and loose coinage.\nBefore becoming the Magister, Bilnur had lived in the same house for over seventy years, selling Faerglamer gauntlets by the hundreds through a middleman. He did not travel, mentor apprentices, or see visitors, having drawn only limited fame as the name for those gauntlets.\nAfter Azuth offered him the position, Bilnur limited himself to putting scrolls inside completed gauntlets before shipping them. He defeated several foes and at least one attack on his house with a hitherto unknown \"flytrap\" spell, but never faced a serious challenger. He died of natural causes at the age of six score."
