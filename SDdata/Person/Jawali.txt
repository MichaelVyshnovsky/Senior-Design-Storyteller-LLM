Jawali was a dwarf faris living on Nada al-Hazan in the Crowded Sea in 1367 DR.
Jawali was fierce and rarely socialized with others. He never smiled, constantly reminded of the scar upon his honor.
At one time, Jawali was once the head of security for the treasure in a temple in Jumlat. The Temple of Najm was robbed under his watch, forever scarring his honor.
