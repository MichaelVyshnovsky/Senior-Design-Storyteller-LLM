'''Obril Matrell''' was one of the three siblings, the second generation of [[House Matrell]], a noble mercantile family of [[Arrabar]].<ref>{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080519045858/http://ww2.wizards.com/Books/Wizards/?doc=fr_vambrancp| title = Character Profile: Vambran Matrell| accessdate = 12-21-2021| date = 12-21-2021}}

==History==
Obril Matrell was born on the 25{{th}} of [[Ches]], the {{YearlinkName|1318}}. Growing up, Obril, along with his siblings [[Hesta Matrell|Hesta]], [[Dregaul Matrell|Dregaul]], and [[Xaphira Matrell]] were ostracized by nobles of Arrabar for being a young merchant house with no social weight behind their name. Through his life, however, House Matrell gained prominence and success due to the leadership of Obril's parents, [[Hetta Debrinne Matrell|Hetta Debrinne]], and [[Obiron Matrell I]]. At some point before his death, Obril married [[Ladara Lazelle Matrell]] and sired three children [[Vambran Matrell|Vambran]], [[Emriana Matrell|Emriana]], and [[Evester Matrell]]. He never got to see his children grow up as he died quite young, on the 18{{th}} of [[Elient]], the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. His youngest children were too young, so they had few memories of their father. Vambran was only four and Emriana - one. Obril's older son, Evester inherited the man's good looks as was evident by a huge portrait that hung in Hetta Debrinne Matrell's sitting room, above a fireplace.
