        "mainbody": "'''Christian''' was a [[Waterdhavian]] noble who often took trips to [[Candlekeep]].",
        "Description": "The noble, of an unknown house, spent a huge amount of money perusing books and tomes from Candlekeep. He spent so much that he did not want this knowledge spread to othersâ€”even his banker became dismayed at his expensive habit.",
        "Personality": "Christian displayed the typical rudeness of nobility, and even compared others to chimps. He considered himself clean, and did not take part in using illegal substances or hiring [[prostitute]]s.",
        "History": "In [[1368 DR]], Christian of Waterdeep made one of his typical trips to Candlekeep, and rented a room at the [[Candlekeep Inn]]."
