        "mainbody": "Christian was a Waterdhavian noble who often took trips to Candlekeep.\nThe noble, of an unknown house, spent a huge amount of money perusing books and tomes from Candlekeep. He spent so much that he did not want this knowledge spread to othersâ€”even his banker became dismayed at his expensive habit.\nChristian displayed the typical rudeness of nobility, and even compared others to chimps. He considered himself clean, and did not take part in using illegal substances or hiring prostitutes.\nIn 1368 DR, Christian of Waterdeep made one of his typical trips to Candlekeep, and rented a room at the Candlekeep Inn."
