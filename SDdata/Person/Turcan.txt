'''Turcan''' was the stablemaster of the noble [[Pharaboldi]] family of [[Arrabar]] ''circa'' [[1373 DR]].

==History==
Pharaboldi were renowned for their passion for [[horse]]s. The family kept a collection of beautiful beasts of various colors peacefully grazing on the lawns of the Pharaboldi estate. Turcan, along with a handful of stablehands, was in charge of caring for the horses and outfitting them to be ridden by the noble masters and their guests. Among the steeds Turcan cared for were a palomino named [[Goldy]] and a bay named [[Shert]].
