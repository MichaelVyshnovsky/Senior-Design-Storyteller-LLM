{{quote|''Oh, yes! I could go to sleep if only I had him! Would you get him for me? Would you, please please please?''|Wellyn}}

==Description==
In his [[undead]] form, Wellyn appeared blurred, moving across the [[Athkatla/Grave District|Grave District]] near his grave.

==History==
Wellyn was born in the {{YearlinkName|1359}} to a mother and loving father in Athkatla. Just ten years later, the child's life was ended abruptly. His body was put to rest in Athkatla's Grave District. However, Wellyn's spirit could not find rest, and the [[ghost]]ly child wandered the graveyard at night, looking for his favorite stuffed [[bear]] toy named [[Littleman]] after a fatal hin hero. The child could not sleep without his toy. The child found the individual who murdered him â€“ a [[dwarf]] named [[Llynis]], who took Littleman as a trophy, by the killer was too afraid to listen to the ghost, and the child's pleas for the toy were ignored.

It was said that [[Abdel Adrian]] came across the child and offered to help him to go to eternal sleep. The hero tracked down the murderer to the [[Copper Coronet]]'s back rooms and confronted the dwarf, eventually returning the bear to Wellyn. Details of the confrontation and even the outcome of the child's plea were unrecorded, and accords of the events varied.
