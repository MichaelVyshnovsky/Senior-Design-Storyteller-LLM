Wellyn was a halfling child from the City of Coin, Athkatla, who became a victim of a monstrous murder in 1369 DR.
In his undead form, Wellyn appeared blurred, moving across the Grave District near his grave.
Wellyn was born in the  to a mother and loving father in Athkatla. Just ten years later, the childs life was ended abruptly. His body was put to rest in Athkatlas Grave District. However, Wellyns spirit could not find rest, and the ghostly child wandered the graveyard at night, looking for his favorite stuffed bear toy named Littleman after a fatal hin hero. The child could not sleep without his toy. The child found the individual who murdered him â€“ a dwarf named Llynis, who took Littleman as a trophy, by the killer was too afraid to listen to the ghost, and the childs pleas for the toy were ignored.
It was said that Abdel Adrian came across the child and offered to help him to go to eternal sleep. The hero tracked down the murderer to the Copper Coronets back rooms and confronted the dwarf, eventually returning the bear to Wellyn. Details of the confrontation and even the outcome of the childs plea were unrecorded, and accords of the events varied.
