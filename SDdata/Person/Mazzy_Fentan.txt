'''Mazzy Fentan''' was an intrepid [[halfling]] warrior, [[adventurer]], and [[Truesword]] of [[Arvoreen]]. She was the closest thing to a halfling [[paladin]] of Arvoreen at a time in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] when such a thing was entirely unheard of.

{{Quote|''"In Arvoreen's name it will be done."''|Mazzy}}

==Personality==
Mazzy was quite brave and dedicated to the protection of others. She was steadfast in her faith and believed righteousness would allow her to overcome the evils she faced.

She daydreamed about such things as riding atop a white [[griffon]] as a paladin and traveling to such sites as [[Dragonspear Castle]] and the city of [[Waterdeep]].

==Abilities==
Mazzy possessed divine-granted abilities similar to those of a paladin. She could ''[[lay on hands]]'' to heal others from their wounds, summon forth an innate physical strength within herself, and instill her allies with an unwavering sense of bravery.

==Possessions==
Fitting for her role as a divine warrior, Mazzy was gifted two weapons by her deity Arvoreen. A ''[[Bow of Arvoreen|unique bow]]'' and an ''[[Sword of Arvoreen|enchanted shortsword]]''.

==Relationships==
Throughout their time together and even after his death, Mazzy was wholly in love with her adventuring companion [[Patrick]].

Even during her time as an adventurer Mazzy remained close with her family. As expected her mother [[Vara Fentan|Vara]] worried for her safety. She also had a sister named [[Pala Fentan|Pala]].

Beyond her family Mazzy had many friends across Amn. Among them were [[Vytari]], the owner of a [[Vytari's pub|nearby pub]], [[Ribald Barterman]] of the [[Adventurer Mart]] in [[Athkatla]], and [[Samuel Thunderburp]] the great warrior of [[Highdale]].

==History==
Mazzy was born and raised in the [[Amn]]ian town of [[Trademeet]]. As a young girl she dreamed of being a paladin in service to Arvoreen and admired the brave [[Keldorn Firecam|Sir Keldorn Firecam]] of the [[Order of the Radiant Heart]].

She eventually took up the adventuring life with Patrick and other [[halfling]]s from Trademeet. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, they were hired by [[Lloyd|Minister Lloyd]] of [[Imnesvale (town)|Imnesvale]] to seek out the town's missing protector [[Merella]] and investigate a number of recent deaths. The group found the [[ranger]]'s journal and went forth to the nearby [[Temple of Amaunator (Amn)|abandoned temple]] of [[Amaunator]].

Within the ruins they were ambushed by the malevolent being known as the [[Shade Lord]] and his [[shadow dragon]] [[Thaxll'ssillyia]]. Most of the group including Patrick were slain and transformed into twisted [[shadow]] versions of themselves. Perhaps most fortunately, Mazzy was merely imprisoned in order that she could replace the undead Merella as the Shade Lord's consort.
