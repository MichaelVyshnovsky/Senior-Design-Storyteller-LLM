        "mainbody": "he Stag King was a dark fey lord who ruled part of Ashenwood forest in Rashemen.\nThe Stag King was huge in stature, with a large rack of antlers on his head. Although some of his facial features resembled those of a deer, he was more human looking than most of his offspring.\nThe Stag King was thousands of years old. Many centuries ago he agreed to aid a tribe of elves in exchange for the right to mate with three elven maidens. Over the generations, the Stag Kings blood overpowered his descendents elven blood and they began to resemble him. Years after he fathered his children, the Stag King returned and declared himself king of his mixed blood offspring.\nIn 1479 DR, Zyl, one of the Stag Kings servants, led the mercenary captain Aoth Fezim to his stronghold. Aoth was able to convince the Stag King to join with the Rashemi berserkers to attack the durthan stronghold of the Fortress of the Half-Demon. \nDuring the battle, the Stag King held his warriors back and let the berserkers lead the assault although once his fey entered the battle, they were quite effective.  The Durthans and their allies were driven into the tunnels below the fortress and the Stag King and allies were forced to enter the catacombs to finish off the Durthans.  During a fight in the catacombs, the Stag King was tricked into separating himself from his warriors and was apparently killed by a group of durthan vampires. \nSometimes on Higharvestide the Stag King reputedly appears floating above the flames of bonfires. Here, he has been described as a large human figure, towering over those nearby, with the skull of an ancient stag for a head, with hollow eyes and a full rack of antlers. It is said that those who see the Stag King on this night are destined to have some kind of adventure in the coming year."
