Prince Livid was a massive gray ooze follower of the Pudding King in Blingdenstone in the late 15 century DR.
The Pudding King, an insane deep gnome fascinated by oozes, subjugated a black pudding he called Princess Ebonmire and a gray ooze he called Prince Livid. Princess Ebonmire and Prince Livid always remained close to the Pudding King.
Circa 1486 DR, after a great battle between the Pudding Kings ooze army and all the factions of Blingdenstone gathered together, Prince Livid was killed just before its master by a party of adventurers hired by some deep gnome factions after escaping from drow slavers of Velkynvelve.
