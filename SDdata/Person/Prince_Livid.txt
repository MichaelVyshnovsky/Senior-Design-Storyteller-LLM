'''Prince Livid''' was a massive [[gray ooze]] follower of the [[Pudding King]] in [[Blingdenstone]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The Pudding King, an insane [[deep gnome]] fascinated by [[ooze]]s, subjugated a [[black pudding]] he called [[Princess Ebonmire]] and a gray ooze he called Prince Livid. Princess Ebonmire and Prince Livid always remained close to the Pudding King.

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], after a great battle between the Pudding King's ooze army and all the factions of Blingdenstone gathered together, Prince Livid was killed just before its master by a party of [[adventurer]]s hired by some deep gnome factions after escaping from [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]].
