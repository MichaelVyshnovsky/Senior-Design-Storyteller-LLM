        "mainbody": "l-Amzija was a black cloud of vengeance that surrounded the ruins of Sokkar in 1367 DR.\nThough the black cloud could not enter the city, it surrounded it for miles in every direction, guarding against any intrusions.\nAl-Amzija could sense any living creature within the city once the creature spent a day within Sokkar and was even aware when items from Sokkar were taken, making it the perfect deterrent for potential thieves.\nThe mere mention of Al-Amzijas name called the black cloud to the precise location within minutes.\nAl-Amzija was summoned by the Undying to shield Sokkar upon the death of its last citizen."
