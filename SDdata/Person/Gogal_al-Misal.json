        "mainbody": "'''Gogal al-Misal''' was a nefarious slave trader within the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}\n\nIn reality, he was actually a skilled [[Elemental mage|flame mage]] of the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]].",
        "Description": "Gogal was lean and possessed aquiline features.{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|31}} He was a handsome man in his late 30's. He always kept his beard and mustache neatly trimmed. In order to put many of his customers at ease, Gogal appeared completely unarmed at all times. All of his magical items and spellcasting components were hidden beneath his voluminous robe.",
        "Activities": "Since no official slave market existed within the City of Delights, Gogal used his monopoly on the vile business to make himself rich. He operated his business out of an open courtyard within the Grand Bazaar. Most of his clientele consisted of disreputable nobles and merchants. Many of the missing persons of Huzuz's less affluent districts were a direct result of Gogal's agents.\n\nIn addition to the stock he kept on display, Gogal took orders from clients requesting specific types of slaves like [[Dwarf|dwarves]] needed to dig a mine. Gogal also wandered the vast market in search of potential wealthy clients.\n\nGogal enjoyed disguising himself as a trader or slaver in order to approach his intended targets. He also served as a excellent recruiter for the Brotherhood.\n\nIn order to maintain his secrecy, Gogal never contacted the other agents of the Brotherhood within Huzuz, preferring instead to operate as an individual. With delicate care, Gogal made important contacts with Huzuz's nobility, helped raise money, and passed along useful information, all for the greater glory of the Brotherhood.",
        "History": "Gogal began his life with the Brotherhood by recruiting agents in [[Qadib]]. However, he did not really garner the attention of the [[Nar-Aidiya|Bonfire]] until assuming command of the [[Flamedeath Fellowship]] in [[Umara]].",
        "Possessions": "Gogal was rumored to own a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]'', a ''[[scarab of deception]]'', a ''[[wand of fire]]'', and a ''[[cloak of displacement|aba of displacement]]''."
