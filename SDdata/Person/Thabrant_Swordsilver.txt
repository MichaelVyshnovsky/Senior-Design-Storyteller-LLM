'''Thabrant Swordsilver''' was a retired [[adventurer]] turned woodcarver of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the father of [[Caladnei]].

==Description==
He was tall, and vigorous until the death of his wife. He had gnarled, woodcarver's hands.

==Personality==
After the death of his wife, he became dejected, listless, and bitter.

==Relationships==
With his wife [[Maela Rynduvyn]], he fathered [[Caladnei]], future [[sorceress]] and Royal Mage of [[Cormyur]] . He was known to [[Meleghost Telchaedrin]], a [[Halruaa]]n [[wizard]], and they still conversed mind-to-mind from time to time.

==History==
He was born in Cormyr. In his youth, Thabrant Swordsilver adventured with Meleghost Telchaedrin. Later, he married Maela Rynduvyn, and they lived in [[Tharnadar Edge]] in [[Turmish]], where their daughter Caladnei was born; he lived as a woodcarver during this time.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|275|17}} After the death of his wife, he became bitter and dejected, and moved back to Cormyr, living in a hut north of [[Immersea]].

During a mind-talk with [[Meleghost Telchaedrin]], he told him that he wanted to see his daughter again; Lord Meleghost, in response, gave Caladnei the knowledge of a [[spell]] to transport her there right away. These events necessarily happened prior to the [[Shieldmeet]] of {{yearlink|1372}}, as Caladnei was not yet the Royal Mage of Cormyr when they happened.
