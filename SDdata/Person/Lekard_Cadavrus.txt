Lekard "Dead-Eye" Cadavrus was a pirate and the master of the Uncivil Serpent during the late 15 century DR, after leading a mutiny against its former captain.
Dead-Eye earned his nickname from his blinded right eye, which was clouded over with a cataract. He was a burly man with a confidant strut despite being positively foul-smelling.
Six months before the , Dead-Eye and his fellow pirates took control of the Uncivil Serpent away from its captain, Murosko Sessprin.
Some time later, Dead-Eye and his pirate crew were robbed by one of their own, Rhonda Thunderbell. They tracked her to Baldurs Gate and sailed to the city in pursuit of revenge.
