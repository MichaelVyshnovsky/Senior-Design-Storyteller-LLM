{{quote
|To the memory of Niree Swifthands. In Elmwood, a Hero of the New Moon Pact, in Chancelgaunt, a Heretic. Murdered in treachery and jealousy there at Bright Lady's Tower in the Year of Lost Wayfarers, 757. Selûne guide her to rest.

Niree oversaw the Temple of the Half-Moon in Elmwood as high priestess, and served Selûne as a werewolf of the New Moon Pact, fighting against her enemies with tooth and claw. In [[757 DR]], the High Moonmistress [[Brima Chintamn]] of [[Bright Lady's Tower]] in [[Chancelgaunt]] declared the New Moon Pact a heresy, and Niree was among those targeted. She was captured, taken to Chancelgaunt, and executed by the [[church of Selûne]] at Bright Lady's Tower, though her companion Halftail escaped.

When [[Feena Archwood]] investigated the mystery of the New Moon Pact in [[1373 DR]], Niree's spirit appeared in her dreams alongside the other members of the Pact to defend and guide her. After she uncovered [[Velsinore]]'s heresy and they mutually slew each other, Feena's spirit was met by a [[Shards|Shard]] escort to the afterlife, but the spirits of the Pact members encouraged her to return to life and join the New Moon Pact herself. With the aid of [[Julith Harkspur]]'s healing, Feena was revived and ultimately continued the legacy of the Pact.
