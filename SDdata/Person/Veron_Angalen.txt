'''Veron Angalen''' was a [[half-orc]] bounty hunter of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
He was originally from [[Silverymoon]]. Unlike many half-orcs who were the result of a non-consensual union between a [[human]] female and a male [[orc]], Veron's orcish mother and human father were married and loved each other.

In [[1478 DR]], Veron accepted a commission to track down a supposedly mad woman named [[Clytemorrenestrix|Nestrix]] who had killed a [[wizard]] in [[Cormyr]]. He tracked her to [[Waterdeep]] and, while attempting to apprehend her, became caught up in a plot by a [[green dragon]], [[Andareunarthex]], to steal [[magic item]]s that would allow him to bypass Waterdeep's [[Ahghairon's dragonward|''dragonward'']].

Veron helped rescue Nestrix, who was really a [[blue dragon]] that had been [[plaguechanged]] into a human woman, from Andareunarthex. Later, he helped to defeat the green dragon and drive him from Waterdeep.
