'''Loska''' was a [[winter wolf]] that lived in [[the North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the traveling companion of [[Delaan Winterhound]], a [[ranger]] of the [[Emerald Enclave]].

==History==
Loska accompanied Delaan to [[Waterdeep]] in the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} during the founding on the [[Council of Waterdeep]]. She did enter with him into the city however, and remained on patrol beyond its gates.
