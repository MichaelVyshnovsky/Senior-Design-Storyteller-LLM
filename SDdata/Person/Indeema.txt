Indeema was a halfling cleric living on Jazayir al-Alfar in the Crowded Sea in 1367 DR. She was the ruler of a tribe of halfings called the Tarangu.
Indeema was overweight and heavily tanned. She had an ample supply of freckles.
Indeema served as the ruler of the Tarangu and a cleric of the crab god Karrrga. She supervised all sacrifices made to the god which usually consisted of offerings left along the lagoon. Most of the time these offerings were consumed by animals inhabiting the region, but sometimes Karrrga would come ashore and claim the offering and a halfling victim if the mood suited him.
