The [[Hand That Sings]] was a [[living spell]], created by one of [[Halaster]]'s apprentices some time prior to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] with use of the ''[[handfang]]'' and ''[[magic mouth]]'' [[spell]]s, who was infamous for haunting [[Brindul Alley]] in the [[Trades Ward of Waterdeep]]. The people of [[Waterdeep]], unknowing that it was a living spell, assumed it to be an apparition or phantom.

==Description==
Having been created by a combination of ''handfang'' and ''magic mouth'', the Hang That Sings had the appearance of an animated, severed [[human]] hand with a mouth in its palm. Many claimed it bore a resemblance to the holy symbol of the [[deity]] [[Moander]].

==Behavior==
The Hand That Sings was easy to provoke, but it did not hold grudges.

==Abilities==
As befitting its nature, the Hand That Sings could engulf other creatures like a closing fist or slam them with its whole mass. Any being struck by the latter means of defense was also struct with the same effects caused by the spells originally used to create the Hand, namely ''handfang'' and ''magic mouth''.

==Activities==
The Hand That Sings spent its existence following the barely remembered dictates the apprentice that had created it. Typically the Hand would would drift along Brindul Alley at night, taking no notice of those who didn't provoke or follow it. All the while singing in an eerie manner ancient, fragmented ballads of the [[Sword Coast]] and love songs.

Though Hand was far more well known for snatching from passersby any valuables that it fancied, especially [[magic items]], and occasionally attacking them. Typically in the form of strangulation or tripping them into fatal falls.

==Relationships==
The Hand had a reputation among the people of Waterdeep for being dangerous.

==History==
In the early 14{{th}} century DR, the Hand That Sings lurked around the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of Waterdeep, until eventually making Brindul Alley its permanent haunt in [[1352 DR]].

By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Hand That Sings was still alive and haunting Brindul Alley.
