Malus Blackiron was a duergar specter priest of Deep Duerra and a member of Clan Blackiron at the small duergar settlement of Fort Iron in the Underdark under Mulmaster in the Moonsea.
Over time, most of Maluss fellow duergar went mad as a result of the influence of the Seed of Fel Earth, a sentient stone part of Ogr√©moch. Maluss cleric powers protected him but, circa 1486 DR, the seed directed against him a purple worm and in the battle they slew each other. Malus however rose again as a specter.
He remained in the mine until 1491 DR, when an adventuring party hired by Leleanor to explore the mine found and defeated him.
As a specter, Malus had a mental connection to the seed that tormented him. He felt as though he was a germ trapped inside a great restless beast and he felt all of its pain. He frequently rambled his lamentations and was prone to violent outbursts.
