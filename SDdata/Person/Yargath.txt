'''Yargath''' was a member of the [[anchorites of Talos]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was one of the caretakers of the [[Circle of Thunder]] in [[Neverwinter Wood]], a site dedicated to the worship of Talos and the veneration of his servant, [[Gorthok|Gorthok the Thunderboar]].

==Description==
Yargath was a [[half-orc]], but her appearance left some doubt as to her exact heritage at first glance. Her fingernails were long and sharp, appearing as claws.

==Abilities==
As an anchorite of Talos, Yargath was a [[shapechanger]] who could change into a [[boar]]. She was also a [[Divine magic|divine]] spellcaster in service to Talos, and favored ''[[bless]]ing'' her allies in combat before bringing to bear some of her more formidable spells, such as ''[[lightning bolt]]''.

==Possessions==
Yargath made her home in a cave situated on the southeastern face of the hill on which the Circle of Thunder sat. The entrance to her modest abode was adorned with a crude carving of three stick figures being struck by lightning. She kept few furnishings or possessions, save for a ''[[potion of greater healing]]'' that she took with her when out on patrol in the nearby woods.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Yargath and her fellow anchorites [[Flenz]] and [[Narux]] were responsible for keeping the Circle of Thunder safe and for performing profane rites and rituals within the Circle to summon Gorthok and to change the weather.

When the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] arrived in the nearby [[Sword Mountains]], the Circle of Thunder hosted a number of [[orc]]s forced to flee when the dragon claimed their home of [[Icespire Hold]] as his lair. The anchorites put these orcs to work harassing local hunters or patrolling the area around the Circle, and Yargath was known to lead such orc patrols.
