'''Maimun''' was a [[bard]] and renowned pirate who sailed up and down the entirety of the [[Sword Coast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{fact}}

==History==
Some time around [[1344 DR]],<ref group="note">In ''The Stowaway'', Maimun is thought to be 12 years old during events that may be dated to 1356 DR. However, his true date of birth is unknown. as a baby, Maimun's village was destroyed by raiders working for the [[cambion]] named [[Asbeel]], who was obsessed with finding both the [[Stone of Tymora]] and the mortal whom the stone had chosen as its wielder. Maimun was that mortal.{{fact}}

His mother hid him in the wine cellar of the family home before it was set alight. Though a beam of the burning ceiling fell, it missed the babe by an extremely narrow margin and its flames kept him warm through the night. The next day, he was rescued from the ruins by a mysterious rider and taken to live with the [[druid]]ess [[Elbeth]] of the [[High Forest]] in her grove.

Exactly six years after that event, which the two celebrated as his birthday, Asbeel found the two of them and demanded Elbeth surrender the child, though of course she refused. Not wanting to face Elbeth in her grove, he set fire to the surrounding trees, drawing her out. Elbeth hid the boy in the boughs of a pine tree and told him to follow the road at dawn.

The man was called [[Perrault]] and was the same mysterious rider who had taken him from the ruins of his first home. With him not having a proper name, Perrault named him 'Maimun', the [[Bedine]] word for 'twice lucky' since he had been rescued twice.

Perrault and Maimun traveled along much of the northern and southern Sword Coast for the next six years, never venturing inside a settlement larger than [[Nesm√©]], nor between [[Waterdeep]] and [[Tethyr]].<ref group="note">The book says "Tyr", but this is likely a typo, since Tyr is either a deity or a city in the ''Dark Sun'' setting. Maimun was taught to read and learned of much lore in that time thanks to the many books Perrault carried with him. Then, one day Perrault told him to research [[Baldur's Gate]].

Maimun later joined Captain [[Deudermont]]'s crew in the {{yearlinkName|1356}}.<ref group="note">Though no date is given in the novel, it is set during the events of events of ''[[The Halfling's Gem]]'', which is officially dated to 1356 DR.
