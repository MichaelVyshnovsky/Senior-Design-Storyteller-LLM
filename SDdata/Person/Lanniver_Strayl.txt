Lanniver Strayl was a member of the Order of the Gauntlet who lived in Neverwinter during the late 15 century DR.
A deeply devout adherent of Tyr, Lanniver was a staunch supporter of the goodly forces of Faer√ªn. He was determined that things would always work out in the end, as long as good men and women did what was necessary. Lannivers manner was wry and witty, and he was very rarely surprised by anything.
Lanniver was happy to support adventurers of goodly intent where he could, even going so far as to provide arms and veteran warriors if the cause was worthy enough.
He was well known and highly respected among the powerful factions of the Sword Coast.
Lanniver always traveled with his younger squire Rhiele Vannis.
He was a friend of fellow knight Baric Nylef.
When several demon lords were set loose in the Underdark in the 1490s DR, King Bruenor Battlehammer convened a council of powerful factions to end the crisis. Lanniver Strayl was the delegate sent by the Order of the Gauntlet.
Some time later, Lanniver sought to investigate the affairs of Dannika Zarn, a fellow member of the Order of the Gauntlet. Lanniver was concerned by Dannikas association with the Order of the Gilded Eye, an extremist Helmite organization. He was additionally involved in his Orders efforts to find a werewolf lair in the Misty Forest near Daggerford.
