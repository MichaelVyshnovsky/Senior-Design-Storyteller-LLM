Haliator Mendara was a seasoned Red Plume of Hillsfar and the leader of Hillsfars troops stationed in Yûlash around 1367 DR.
Commander Mendara was a hardened and cruel man, middle-aged by 1373 DR. He had a reputation of turning a bland eye on extortion and looting done by the Red Plumes of Hillsfar.
Haliator commanded roughly 240 Red Plumes arranged into 24 detachments. He condoned looting so long as his troops were the ones doing the looting.
In the , the Zhentarim became targeted by a mysterious Order of the Crippled Fang. The Shind Road that connected Hillsfar and Yûlash became swarmed by the fiends in service to the cult. Haliators Red Plumes occasionally clashed with the roaming monsters, however, he showed little interest in aiding Zhent patrols and Merrik who was taken to Yûlash as a prisoner to be executer at a later date.
