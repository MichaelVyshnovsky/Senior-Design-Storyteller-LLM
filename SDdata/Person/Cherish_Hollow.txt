Cherish Hollow was the necromancer who authored The Amiable Art of Necromancy, sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.
Cherish harbored a plethora of phobias. She was afraid of sharks, licorice, wallpaper, Netherese artifacts, overly large and overly small hats, the outdoors, the indoors, and milk pails. One thing she was not afraid of, however, was zombies, unlike her father who was terrified of them.
She owned the Staff of Cherished Necromancy at some point before the late 15 century DR.
Daughter of Thibault Hollow, Cherish penned her book sometime before the , in which she defended a ladys need for the art of necromancy despite the questions and disdain of others. In her book, Cherish used the example of her undead attendant to prove her point. The zombie who once was Mister Nascent Owens retained none of his living thoughts or memories. The necromancer believed that Nascent found pleasure in serving her tea, giving backrubs, and eating the mistresss enemies. Cherish stated that giving purpose and direction to the discarded husk was the best economical and metaphysical approach to the taboo of death in her contemporary society. Furthermore, Cherish stated that, as such, the art of necromancy was helpful for those who were lonely.
