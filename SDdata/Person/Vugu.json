        "mainbody": "Master Vugu, was the founding member of the short-lived Order of Theorosophers, active in the late 14 century DR.\nMaster Vugu finalized his doctrine on Theorosophy fifteen years before the . His academic work resulted in the formation of the Order of Theorosophers, something that became a bane of his existence. Initially, Master Vugus concept was simple an individual should not discount deep, psychic urges and the motivations of their subconsciousness when attempting to validate an unproven hypothesis. Vugu stated that the scientific approach ignored the individuals primeval mind and over-relied on clinical data.\nVugu took two pupils, Beb-Shuur and Xianga, who failed to understand the Masters teachings to Vugus exasperation. Both men were fawning academia rejects who focused on the \"syntax\" of Vugus words rather than their meaning. For Beb-Shuur and Xianga, Theorosophy was in active opposition to perception based on logic and empiricism. Instead, they relied on deductive reasoning and intuition. Vugus lifes work became a quasi-spiritual pseudo-science, and as Beb-Shuur and Xianga ventured into the world, they accredited the creation of the Order of Theorosophers to Master Vugu. This devastated his standing within academia and philosophical communities of Faer√ªn.\nWith his reputation destroyed, Master Vugu committed suicide by jumping off the dangerous Blade Cliffs to the southwest of Daggerford. His tattered journal that recorded Vugus true thoughts about Theorosophy was saved ashore not far from the cliff where he died. When the journal was recovered, Beb-Shuur and Xianga denied its authenticity based on a gut feeling as dictated by Theorosophy. Subsequently, both \"sages\" convinced each other that the only way to decide who was worthy of the title and leadership role was to follow Vugus example. Both dimwitted men died after jumping off a cliff."
