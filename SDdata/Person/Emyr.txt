==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Emyr and several other Flaming Fist soldiers encountered nearly a dozen people that recounted fantastical stories related to [[the Companion]] and the city of [[Elturel]]. They said the false sun changed from its normal radiance to a black sphere that released countless shadows that enveloped the city, causing it to disappear.

Emyr ordered their soldiers to take these people into custody until they could glean more information about the situation.
