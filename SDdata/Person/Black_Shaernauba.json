        "mainbody": "'''Black Shaernauba''' was a [[werewyvern]] brigand reputed to dwell within the [[Storm Horns]] mountains in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "A subject of local legend, Black Shaernauba robbed travelers on the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]]. If they got the better of her, she transformed into a [[wyvern]] and flew back to her lair. This was said to be a cave in the mountains, stuffed with coins and [[gem]]s. She was even said to kidnap handsome men and keep them captive there.\n\nSupposedly, she'd even murdered [[Purple Dragons]] who tried to establish an outpost in the hamlet of [[Wyvernhunt]] and people who tried to build inns there. However, [[Volothamp Geddarm]] thought this unlikely, as Cormyr's Purple Dragons and [[War Wizards]] wouldn't be deterred by one bandit, even if a werewyvern, if they'd been serious."
