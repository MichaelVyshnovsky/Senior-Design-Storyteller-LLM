If they got the better of her, she transformed into a wyvern and flew back to her lair. This was said to be a cave in the mountains, stuffed with coins and gems. She was even said to kidnap handsome men and keep them captive there.\nSupposedly, shed even murdered Purple Dragons who tried to establish an outpost in the hamlet of Wyvernhunt and people who tried to build inns there. However, Volothamp Geddarm thought this unlikely, as Cormyrs Purple Dragons and War Wizards wouldnt be deterred by one bandit, even if a werewyvern, if theyd been serious."
