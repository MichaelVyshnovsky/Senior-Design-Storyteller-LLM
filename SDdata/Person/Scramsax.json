        "mainbody": "Scramsax was an innkeeper in Bryn Shander sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.\nScramsax, a retired sellsword, managed the Northlook inn, a well-known place among adventurers and mercenaries of the North. He profited off his customers by charging the most exorbitant rates in the town. However, he permitted to remain on credit customers who were undertaking a new job but he wanted to be paid with very high interest. If someone did not pay, then Scramsax showed that he could still use a sword."
