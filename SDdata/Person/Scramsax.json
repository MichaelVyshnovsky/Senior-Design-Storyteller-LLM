        "Activities": "Scramsax, a retired sellsword, managed the [[Northlook (inn)|Northlook]] inn, a well-known place among adventurers and mercenaries of the [[North]]. He profited off his customers by charging the most exorbitant rates in the town.

If someone did not pay, then Scramsax showed that he could still use a sword."
