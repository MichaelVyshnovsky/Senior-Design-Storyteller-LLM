'''Veega''' was a [[half-orcish]] blacksmith for hire from the city of [[Neverwinter]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Many half-orcs were known to be patient and deft, however, Veega possessed neither of these qualities. She was extremely passionate about her trade but lacked finesse and patience. Despite it all, Veega made a living by practicing smithing and offering her services to adventurers for hire in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
