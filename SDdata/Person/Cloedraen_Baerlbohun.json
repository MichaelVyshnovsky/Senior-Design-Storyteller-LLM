        "mainbody": "Cloedraen Baerlbohun was one of the children of \"Toadroarer\" Phonchandas Baerlbohun, the foul-tempered self-made noble of Baerlbohun Towers in Athkatla, active in the 14 century DR.\nCloedraen was a spoiled individual who only cared about wenching, drinking, and dueling. Like his father and brothers, he had a foul temper and was prone to smashing things in fits of rage.\nBy the late 14, Cloedraens mother and two other wives of \"Toadroarer\" were dead from various causes. The Baerlbohun family was looked down upon by other merchant and noble families of Athkatla, while Cloedraens uncles branch of the family that resided within Baerlbohun House pretended that Phonchandass branch did not exist. Cloedraens branch returned the favor."
