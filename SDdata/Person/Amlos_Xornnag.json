        "mainbody": "Captain '''Amlos Xornnag''' was an [[Amnian]] [[Council Army]] officer of the [[Xornnag]] family who was assigned to command [[Hillfort Ishla]] on the realm's borders in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Captain Xornnag was a vain man who kept himself fit and worried greatly about his receding hairline.",
        "Personality": "Amlos was a selfish and greedy fellow who truly only cared for himself. He used his oily charms and quick guile to trick, scheme and come out on top in deal-making and duels, no matter what.",
        "History": "Captain Xornnag came to command Hillfort Ishla in [[1355 DR]], and promptly turned it into a profitable venture for himself and the troops there. He had his garrison of soldiers abandon their military duties in favor of performing on-demand tasks for the wealthy figures in nearby [[Esmeltaran]], with apparent \"emergencies\" in town turning out to be the pressing need for a company of infantry to act as waiters at a party. The discipline and functionality of the fort suffered greatly for this profit. The gardens were ill-kept and unable to provide much food, the grounds flooded from a light rain, the lodgings were leaky and drafty, and the outer walls were ready to collapse with a push. The troops hated being in such a situation, but any complaints outside the fort were rebuffed by the Captain's network of connections, and complaints inside of it resulted in the offending soldier being quickly reassigned elsewhere, or perhaps simply disappearing entirely if they were too strident about it. The majority of his troops were content to suffer quietly in their posting while earning extra money by performing demeaning tasks for their betters.\n\nThis lucrative arrangement came to an end in [[1370 DR]] on [[Eleasis 7]], when the [[Sothillisian War]] suddenly started when the [[Skullgnasher]] [[hill giant]]s and [[Spearbiter]] [[goblin]]s poured out of the [[Small Teeth]] and easily shattered Hillfort Ishla. No Amnian soldier managed to escape the spear or cookpotâ€”except for Captain Amlos Xornnag, who chose to aid the monstrous invaders in order to save his own skin. He used his knowledge of Amn's defenses to aid their assault, and over the next two days they had overun [[Gambiton]], destroyed the [[King's Arch]], and even captured Esmeltaran. He proceeded solidify his investment in his new allies by helping them prepare for the inevitable counterattack, and on [[Eleasis 21]] they repelled General [[Labak Craumerdaun]]'s assault, killing thousands of Council Army soldiers and mercenaries, and forced a long siege that only ended in late [[1372 DR]]."
