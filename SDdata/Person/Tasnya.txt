'''Tasnya''' was an exiled [[archdevil]] in the mid-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She liked pain.

==Appearance==
She was often crimson with the blood that she coated herself with, though flames rose in wisps from her face and breasts, of which there were multiple; she was dark and sinuous beneath the blood, with spikes long enough to transfix anyone close by.

==Relationships==
Nergal and her were rivals of sorts. One [[erinyes]] serving her was named [[Sressa]].{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|136-137|8}}
She thought Malachlabra was a fool just like Nergal.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|171|11}}


==Abilities==
Besides some abilities related to scrying, Tasnya showed the power to cast spells that made the blood around her burn with deadly flames, as well as alter the behaviour of said ''bloodfire'' into cones, lances, and other forms. She could also alter the spikes on her body, making them lengthen or thicken in combat.

==Activities==
Amongst other things, she liked to scry on fellow outcasts, be flogged by imps, bite the throats off erinyes, wrestle abishai, get bitten by land lampreys. 

==History==
Soon after Nergal came into possession of [[Elminster Aumar]], Tasnya was already aware of him, and soon sent one of her servants, [[Sressa]], to watch them. She continued to scry during the events, including, momentarily, over [[Malachlabra]].{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|136-137|8}}

After Nergal placed Elminster in her cave, The Simbul came to her, drawn by him; the sorceress destroyed Tasnya soon after their meeting.
