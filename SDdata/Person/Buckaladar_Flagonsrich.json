With a single sip of wine, the halfling could identify the grape used in the wines pressing, vintage year, and country of origin.\nThe Flagonsrich family, along with several other notable hin clans, owned most of Purskul. Bucks home stood along the Orc Road in the Zehoarastria region of Amn. The Flagonsrich Estate included a great garden and vineyards in the back.\nIn the , before the Feast of the Moon, the Knights of the Shield worked on restoring Amns monarchy, manipulated by Rhinnom Dannihyr, the Grandmaster of the Shadow Thieves. Buckaladar Flagonsrich was a strong supporter of the agenda and led to Bucks nomination to the Knights of the Shield."
