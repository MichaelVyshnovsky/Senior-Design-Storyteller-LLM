        "Description": "Buckaladar was a haughty snob of a [[halfling]], a winemaker of great skill, pallet, and terrible temper. With a single sip of wine, the halfling could identify the [[grape]] used in the wine's pressing, vintage year, and country of origin.",
        "Possessions": "The Flagonsrich family, along with several other notable hin clans, owned most of Purskul. Buck's home stood along the [[Orc Road]] in the [[Zehoarastria]] region of Amn. The [[Flagonsrich Estate]] included a great garden and vineyards in the back.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, before the [[Feast of the Moon]], the [[Knights of the Shield]] worked on restoring Amn's monarchy, manipulated by [[Rhinnom Dannihyr]], the Grandmaster of the [[Shadow Thieves]]. Buckaladar Flagonsrich was a strong supporter of the agenda and led to Buck's nomination to the Knights of the Shield."
