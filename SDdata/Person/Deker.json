        "History": "[[File:Deker's Home.png|thumb|273px|''Deker's residence highlighted on a map of Volkumburgh.'']]\nIn [[1358 DR]],{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} in the month of [[Calendar of Harptos|Uktar]] some time prior to the [[Feast of the Moon]], Deker was clearing out the ruins known as [[High Pasture]] in hopes of constructing a new barn in its place. During this, one of his [[sheep]] walked up to and bit a ''[[runestick]]'' that made it seemingly disappear.\n\nLater a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Suzail]], seeking out the scattered remains of [[Awtawmatawn]] on behalf of [[Amelior Amanitas]], overheard residents gossiping about this incident while in the [[Crimson Wyrm]]. They came to inquire with him about it and Deker gladly obliged to show them the ''runestick''."
