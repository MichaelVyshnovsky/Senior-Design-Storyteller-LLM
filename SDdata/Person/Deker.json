During this, one of his sheep walked up to and bit a runestick that made it seemingly disappear.\nLater a group of adventurers from Suzail, seeking out the scattered remains of Awtawmatawn on behalf of Amelior Amanitas, overheard residents gossiping about this incident while in the Crimson Wyrm. They came to inquire with him about it and Deker gladly obliged to show them the runestick."
