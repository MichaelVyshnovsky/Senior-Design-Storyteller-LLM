        "mainbody": "'''Tharlgarl \"Steelfists\" Darowdryn''' was a member of the noble [[House Darowdryn]], one of the oldest and wealthiest merchant families of [[Arrabar]] and all of [[Chondath]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Tharlgarl was a huge man who resembled a [[bear]] who prided himself for his great white mustaches that hung below his chin. His nickname â€“ \"Steelfists,\" came from the man's habit of wearing a heavy set of [[gold]]-ornamented pompous [[plate mail]], even in Arrabarran sweltering hot and humid climate.",
        "Relationships": "Tharlgarl \"Steelfists\" Darowdryn could often be seen accompanying and guarding his aunt [[Ariskrit Darowdryn]], the aging matriarch of House Darowdryn.",
        "History": "On [[Tarsakh 10]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Ariskrit and Tharlgarl Steelfists attended [[Emriana Matrell]]'s grand celebration of becoming an adult, an Arrabarran tradition for a woman's 16{{th}} birthday. During the celebration, Tharlgarl and Ariskrit witnessed an assassination attempt on [[Hetta Matrell]]'s life orchestrated by the cabal of [[Talricci]]s, [[Pharaboldi]]s, and, as later revealed, Hetta's own family, as retaliation for the matriarch's disapproval of the sneak coin activities."
