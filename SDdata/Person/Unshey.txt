Unshey was a cleric and author who resided on the Sword Coast during the 14 century DR.
Sometime in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, Unshey encountered an ogre while traveling along the Coast Way. In exchange for her life, she offered the the creature a signed copy of her book, the History of Tethyr. Unfortunately, the ogre had a particular fetish for wearing girdles and accepted nothing less than her enchanted belt, Elves Bane.
Escaping with her life, Unshey made her way north to the Friendly Arm Inn to seek refuge.
