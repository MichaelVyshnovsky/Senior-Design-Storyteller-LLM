Kathra Shallowtaint was a rowdy elven adventuring mage, active in the 14 century DR.
At age 127, Kathra was a wizard of some power, but her reputation came from her wild partying and copious alcohol consumption. When she was around her elven kin, Kathra routinely drank entire bars worth of feywine and still remained alert, able to gamble and win many a coin. As a wizard, Kathra was cocky and held no respect for elders and sages, be they elves, human, or any other race. One notable incident took place on the Road to the Dawn. The elven spell-slinger came across an aging sage and held him at a daggerpoint, demanding him to teach her everything he knew about philosophy by the first light of the morning sun.
Sometime in the 14 century DR, Kathra Shallowtaint was among adventurers interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths.
