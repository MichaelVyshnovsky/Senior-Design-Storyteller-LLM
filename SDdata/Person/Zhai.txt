'''Zhai''' was a half-[[drow]], halfâ€“[[wood elf]] [[rogue]] of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
She was able to use twin [[dagger]]s and had skill at hiding herself.

==History==
Zhai was raised in the [[wood elf]] village of [[Cedarleaf]] by her drow mother and wood elf father, until they were killed indirectly by the [[slaad]] [[Ygorl]] in a raid against the town.

Feeling insecure in the home of the wood elves, Zhai left them and became a rogue. She was captured by [[orc]]s attacking a town but was freed by [[Rannek]] during the battle. Soon thereafter, Zhai acquired a ''[[ring of jumping]]''.

Zhai later gained a reputation in [[Damara]] around [[1368 DR]], with [[Ellery Dragonsbane]] hearing tales of her and mentioning them to [[Jarlaxle Baenre]].<ref><ref group="note">While unnamed, this is presumed to be Zhai, as she is a female half-drow and ''Demon Stone'' and ''Promise of the Witch-King'' are both written by R.A. Salvatore.
