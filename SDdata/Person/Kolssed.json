He found the hermitic lifestyle relaxing, but struggled with the social isolation aspect.\nBeing a hermit, Kolssed owned nothing of value, and as such was mostly left alone by bandits.\nKolssed was a successful merchant in the Amnian town of Nashkel. After losing everything as a result of the iron crisis of 1368 DR, he became a wandering hermit. When the Bhaalspawn known as Gorions Ward escaped Candlekeep, Kolssed was one of the first people to run into them. He offered the Ward advice, and warned them of two nearby unpleasant fellows the Zhentarim agents Xzar and Montaron."
