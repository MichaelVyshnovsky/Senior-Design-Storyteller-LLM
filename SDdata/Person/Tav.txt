'''Tav''' was an [[adventurer]] and detective in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, Tav began investigating the murder of an [[elf]], whose body was found on [[Sailor's Crossing]] in [[Eastway]]. After unraveling a larger plot, a letter from [[Sceleritas Fel]] threatened Tav with death if they failed to identify the killer, whom Sceleritas Fel identified as his master. The letter gave Tav a time limit of a [[tenday]] to complete the task. This threat was carried out by the [[Dark Urge]], a white [[dragonborn]] and [[Bhaalspawn]].
