Jacer Wind-dancer was an adventurer in Cormyr with the Grand Fist company in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Jacer was a genial and helpful person, but was also a bumbling and incapable fool.
In , Jacer and Brandy Fumblebuckle attended a party at Thistleflame Keep, held by Lord Partic Thistle for King Azoun IVs birthday. They were interviewed as suspects after Lord Thistle appeared to be murdered at the party, but any suspicions that they had committed a complex criminal plot were ended by their impressive incompetence.
