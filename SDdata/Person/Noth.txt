'''Noth''' was a [[priest]] of [[Bane]] and member of the [[Zhentarim]] inhabiting [[Snowmantle]] in [[Daggerdale]] during the  mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
''Circa'' [[1369 DR]], Noth was part of the combined forces of Zhentarim and [[Zhentilar]] who occupied Snowmantle. He was tasked by his commander [[Ragnoth]] with watching [[Juliana Saan]] within the [[Singing Dryad]]. Noth observed Juliana as she prepared meals for the Zhentilar soldiers and made sure she didn't sneak extra food to the slaves.
