'''Norweg the Magnificent''' was a [[wizard]] who lived in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/58/The Living City: Of Wits and Wizards, A Logic Puzzle|27}}

==Home==
Norweg lived in a yellow one-story house on [[Magician's Row]]. It was the first of five houses.

==Description==
Norweg had a black [[cat]] [[familiar]], smoked Saltweed [[tobacco]], and was primarily a [[wine]] drinker.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], Norweg the Magnificent and [[Panese|Panese the Excitable]] separately stole two minor [[magic item]]s of historical importance from the city vaults at approximately the same time. Norweg spilled some of his wine at one of the vaults. Though the thieves were unidentified, suspicions and [[divination]]s tracked them to Magician's Row. The [[City Guard (Ravens Bluff)|City Guard]] serving Regent of the Exchequer [[Vernon Condor]] only had time to search two of the five houses before they earned their boss's ire, so they tried to deduce the culprits from what they knew of the five wizards in the neighborhood.
