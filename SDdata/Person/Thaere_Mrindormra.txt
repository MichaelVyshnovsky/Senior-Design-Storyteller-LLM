Thaere Mrindormra, or simply Mother Thaere, was an aging healer who lived just outside Hultail in Cormyr, in the late 15 century DR.
Thaere was an aging spinstress around sixty years old. She was a human woman, three generations removed from her half-elven ancestors.
By the late 15 century DR, Mother Thaere was known for her healing skills and discretion. She was the only member of her family to still inhabit her cottage home to the east of Hultail, on the southern bank of the Thunder River, surrounded by green gardens.
