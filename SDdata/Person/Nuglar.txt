'''Nuglar''' was a farmer in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
At the time of his death he carried a goad stick.

==History==
While going somewhere through the path between [[Aerhiot's Field]] and [[Salopar's Field]] with three [[oxen]] in the {{yearlinkName|761}}, Nuglar heard a tinkling sound, like bells. He believed it may have been a [[lamb]] with a toy [[bell]] placed there by Priests of the Mother, almost certainly [[Chauntea]]. He also considered the ringing sound may have been children playing with something. Shortly after, however, he saw a sparkling mist approach one of his oxen; reaching out to touch it, the mist made some of his arm disappear. Before he could scream, the mist flowed over him, and reduced him to bones that crumbled in the breeze. Unknown to him, that mist was [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]].
