Jurguth Goroth was a high priest of Shar active during the 1 century DR. He was the owner of Gorothirs Girdle, a divine relic of his faith.
Jurguth was one of the many grandchildren of the mythical priest Gorothir. During the Night of Dark Fire, he conspired with several allies to end his grandfathers life in a massive conflagration of magic. After their victory, Jurguth salvaged Gorothirs Girdle. The goddess Shar worked through the Girdle to corrupt Jurguth, who ultimately became a Dark Heart of her church.
On the , his subordinate Klaunauthe Draeyl heard whispers of the Dark Lady in her dreams. The goddess commanded her to slay Jurguth and take the divine Girdle he was wearing, which she did in a spectacular fashion. On Eleint 11 of the same year, Klaunauthe used her magic to smash him to a bloody pulp against the ceiling of their temple during a ritual. She absorbed his life essence to empower her own life and magic, and took both his Girdle and his position for herself.
