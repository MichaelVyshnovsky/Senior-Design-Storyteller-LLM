'''Jurguth Goroth''' was a high [[priest]] of [[Shar]] active during the 1{{st}} century [[DR]]. He was the owner of [[Gorothir's Girdle]], a divine [[relic]] of his faith.

==History==
Jurguth was one of the many grandchildren of the mythical priest [[Gorothir]]. During the [[Night of Dark Fire]], he conspired with several allies to end his grandfather's life in a massive conflagration of magic. After their victory, Jurguth salvaged ''[[Gorothir's Girdle]]''. The goddess [[Shar]] worked through the ''Girdle'' to corrupt Jurguth, who ultimately became a Dark Heart of her church.

On the {{YearlinkName|469}}, his subordinate [[Klaunauthe Draeyl]] heard whispers of the ''Dark Lady'' in her dreams. The goddess commanded her to slay Jurguth and take the divine ''Girdle'' he was wearing, which she did in a spectacular fashion. On [[Eleint 11]]{{th}} of the same year, Klaunauthe used her magic to smash him to a bloody pulp against the ceiling of their [[temple]] during a [[ritual]]. She absorbed his life essence to empower her own life and magic, and took both his ''Girdle'' and his position for herself.
