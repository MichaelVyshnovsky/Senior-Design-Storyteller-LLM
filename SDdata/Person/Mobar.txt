Mobar was a goblin werebat chieftain in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Mobar ruled his tribe living inside Wyllowwood. He spent time making gifts for Wyllow and leaving them in front of Wyllows Tower. He preferred to remain in his hybrid form.
In 1492 DR, Mobar exiled the trouble-maker Vool from his tribe.
Mobar was a very resolute individual, ruling with iron fists. However he was totally crazy with love for Wyllow.
Mobar loved Wyllow and always obeyed her orders.
