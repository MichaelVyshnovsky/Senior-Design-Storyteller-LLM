        "History": "Cassius was bound to a ''figurine of wondrous power'' that had the wolf's name inscribed on its side. In order to summon Cassius, the owner of its figurine needed to rub the magic item. This could be one once per day.\n\nMost of Cassius's history remained a mystery. One of the wolf's companion was a [[druid]] from [[Cormanthor]], [[Branon Oakheart]]. The duo was attacked a group of [[fiend]]s and Cassius lured the creatures away from Branon, allowing him to escape. Cassius's ''figurine of wondrous power'' was lost in the process, hidden under a patch of soil in the city of [[Elventree]] of the [[Moonsea]] region. The figurine was still there, concealed by dirt, as of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}."
