'''Lakkar''' was a [[frost giant]] who once lived in the [[Sword Mountains]].

A loyal follower of the god [[Thrym]], Lakkar was gifted an [[artifact]] known as the [[Winterforge]] by his god, which channeled the power of the icy realms within the [[Elemental Chaos]]. With this power, Lakkar waged a unstoppable war of conquest throughout the [[Sword Mountains]]. Eventually the [[Icehammer]] [[dwarves]] of [[Icespire Peak]] stood up to him. In response Lakkar absorbed the Winterforge into himself, growing to an immense size and declaring himself a god. This brazen act of hubris angered Thrym, who stripped Lakkar of his defenses and allowed the dwarves to defeat him. In death, his titanic body was frozen solid atop Icespire Peak.
