'''Aragath Taltar''' was an evil [[lich]]-like [[undead]] in [[Turmish]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Aragath was a priest of [[Talos]] in the smugglers' city of [[Jathrin's Jump]]. He was planning to become undead when his temple was destroyed by followers of [[Lathander]]. Somehow he returned from death as a [[wraith]]-like [[lich]] leading some [[stone golem]]s.

Around [[1310 DR]], a [[thief]] recovered Aragath's diary and sold it to the [[Uluuthin]] family, who died later during an adventure.

Around 1370 DR, Aragath killed an [[adventurer]].
