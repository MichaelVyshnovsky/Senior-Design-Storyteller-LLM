'''Lavok Corthala''' was a powerful [[human]] [[wizard]] living in [[Athkatla]], [[Amn]], in the 1360s [[DR]]. 

==History==
Lavok was a mighty wizard, with an interest in [[necromancy]]. He was known for his creation of the [[Planar Sphere]] artifact. After some time, Lavok decided to travel across the [[plane]]s for a time. He was already 200 years old when he left Amn in his sphere.

Lavok came back to Amn 100 years later. His plan was to use the body of his descendent, [[Valygar Corthala]], as host for his mind, granting him an extended life but in the end he was defeated by [[Gorion's Ward]] and his own descendant. When defeated, he seemed to bitterly regret his actions, stating that a dark shadow was controlling him, and that he had to fight it, in order to protect the secret of the Sphere.
