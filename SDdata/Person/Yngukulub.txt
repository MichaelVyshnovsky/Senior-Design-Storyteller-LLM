Yngukulub the Devourer was an aboleth ally of Gar Shatterkeel at the Fane of the Eye under Tyar-Besil during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Yngukulub obeyed Gar because it believed that in the new era of Olhydra the aboleth would rule the world.
In 1491 DR, Yngukulub stayed at the Fane, served by a retinue of deranged kuo-toa, until some adventurers infiltrated the temple and killed it.
