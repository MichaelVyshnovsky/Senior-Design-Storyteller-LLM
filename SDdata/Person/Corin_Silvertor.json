        "mainbody": "ord Corin Silvertor was a human noble of Waterdeep in the early 14 century DR.\nBorn the youngest of three sons to the noble House Silvertor, Corin did not grow up expecting to be heir. He was a disappointment to his father, and was often whipped, leaving scars on his back that would remain as he grew up.\nIn the , the young Corin had recently assumed the title of Lord Silvertor after his fathers passing, when he was lost on a hunting trip into Undermountain below Waterdeep. The half-orc thief Artek Artalen, called the Knife, was hired by Lord Darien Thal to rescue Lord Silvertor from Undermountain, and with the help of the wizard Beckla Shadesar, they located the young nobleman, and the three of them battled their way through Undermountain.\nCorin was described as handsome, with golden hair and blue eyes, and a boyish face with fine, elegant features.\nCorin carried a slender rapier.\nCorin was an excellent shot with a short bow, and very fast with his rapier. He was also a capable and strategic lanceboard player.\nCorin was grateful to Artek Artalen for his help, and had warm feelings for Beckla Shadesar in particular, as he invited her to join him as he returned to Waterdeep."
