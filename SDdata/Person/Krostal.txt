'''Krostal''' was a thief of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Krostal had a ginger beard.

==Personality==
Krostal was dismissive of matters he hadn't personally experienced. He disliked [[alanthe]] [[wine]] from [[Sheirtalar]], and [[yhaummarind]], too.

==Abilities==
Krostal was an expert thief.

==Possessions==
Krostal wielded a number of throwing knives.

==Activities==
Krostal was a genuine dealer in [[Lantanna]] clockwork when he wasn't undertaking thefts.

==Relationships==
Malivur and Krostal were working together to capture [[Shandril Shessair]] late in the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, though they didn't get along too well.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|243-244|15}}

==History==
According to Korthauvar Hammantle, Krostal had been the one to seize the [[Tiara of the Eyes]] from Lady Thaulindra of [[Sheirtalar]] a few years before.

Malivur and Krostal were assigned to attempt the capture of Shandril Shessair while she was in a caravan from [[Scornubel]] to [[Waterdeep]] in late 1357 DR.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|272|16}} as well as [[Red Wizards]] scrying under the command of [[Hulrivior]] in [[Triel]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|309|18}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Krostal told Malivur he recognized another, especially powerful, fellow mage of the Cult of the Dragon in the caravan. The people scrying on them weren't able to identify that mage; it is possible he was lying.
