'''"King" Tredarath Bormul''' was [[Tethyr]]ian prince who perished during a period of royal infighting and intrigue in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Tredarath was the son of King [[Teremir I]] of the [[House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul]], with an elder brother and a sister whose names were lost to history.

==History==
When [[Mhoaran]] set about slaying the members of the [[Queens' Dynasty]] in the {{YearlinkName|959}}, Prince Tredarath plundered a royal vault and fled with his followers. Seeking to either found a new realm far to the north, or raise a rebellion against his murderous cousin, his retinue passed through the swamps at the mouth of the [[Winding Water]] near [[Lathtarl's Lantern]] but got lost in a fog bank. Weighed down with all the royal regalia and treasure, Tredarath and his hundred-strong band of armsmen drowned in the water and [[quicksand]] while being assailed by the hungry denizens of the swamp, never to be seen again. The only traces of the lost king-to-be were the occasional [[coin]]s and a [[jewel]]ed [[dagger]] found by local residents, and a [[gold]] crown seen worn by a [[lizardman]].
