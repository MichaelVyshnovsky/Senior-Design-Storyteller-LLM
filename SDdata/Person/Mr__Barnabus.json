        "mainbody": "'''Mr. Barnabus''' was a smart [[bat]] and animal companion of a young child [[sorceress]] [[Jemmy Kirschtorte]] of [[Liam's Hold]] in [[1372 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Mr. Barnabus is my friend. Say \"hello,\" Mr. Barnabus.''|[[Jemmy Kirschtorte]]}}",
        "Description": "Mr. Barnabus was an ordinary-looking small bat. He had sleek brown fur, furiously flapping wings, and a loud squeaky voice.",
        "History": "''Circa'' 1372 DR, young commoner girl Jemmy Kirschtorte discovered she could communicate with an ordinary but very smart and loyal bat she named Mr. Barnabus. The girl's talent of sorcery manifested in her being able to speak with animals. The duo became fast friends, and Mr. Barnabus lived in Jemmy and her mother's home - [[Nell's Pie Shop]].\n\nIn 1372 DR, young Jemmy was noticed by an ancient [[drow]] [[vampire]] [[Sieronius Dethick]] who was seeking for a woman to marry - the only way for him to break an imprisonment ''[[curse]]''. The vampire stalked the young girl, talking to her via dreams. The vampire also tried to ''[[charm]]'' Mr. Barnabus into serving him, but the little bat liked his young friend too much to leave. Eventually, Sieronius realized that the sorceress was too young to marry. Instead, the drow set his eyes on Jemmy's mother, [[Nell Kirschtorte]]. However, Mr. Barnabus felt the [[undead]] bloodsucker's approach and warned Jemmy. Sieronius saw the child awake and, without leaving his mist form, left the shop, focusing his attention on another victim - [[Xanda Pennywell]] of Liam's Hold."
