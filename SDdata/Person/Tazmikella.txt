'''Tazmikella''' was a [[copper dragon]] who lived in the [[Bloodstone Lands]].

==Appearance==
Her human form was that of a rather ordinary looking, middle-aged woman with once-strawberry-blond, mostly soft-gray hair, dressed in simple clothes. She was also known to take the form of a young blond female elf, but still kept her human name. She had wide shoulders and a smallish head.

==Personality==
Tazmikella was considered friendly by her customers and neighboring merchants. She hated wearing clothes and couldn't understand the need of humans to hide their natural forms. To her that showed a level of shame and modesty reflective of a race that couldn't elevate itself above its apparent limitations.

==History==
By the 14th century [[DR]], Tazmikella was centuries old. She had a sister, [[Ilnezhara]], with whom she crawled from her egg in the great deserts of [[Calimshan]].

She and her sister were once approached by [[Zhengyi]], the Witch-King, with the offer of immortality in [[lich|lichdom]] if they served beside his conquering armies. The dragon sisters declined that offer.

In [[1368 DR]], Tazmikella owned a shop at [[Wall's Around]] in [[Heliogabalus]] called [[Tazmikella's Bag of Silver]].

By [[1484 DR]], Tazmikella was posing as the human "Mickey," the owner of a curiosity shop called [[Mickey's Bag of Holding]] at Wall's Around in [[Helgabal]]. That year, the [[drow]] [[Jarlaxle]] approached her and her sister, requesting them to help him in the events surrounding the [[Darkening]] and the involvement of several [[white dragon]]s.

During the [[Tyranny of Dragons]], she was chosen as member of [[Protanther]]'s council of [[metallic dragon]]s to oppose the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and [[Tiamat]].

==Abilities==
In her dragon form, Tazmikella could blow a [[garlic]]-smelling breath that slowed those affected. When in her [[human]] and [[elf]] forms, Tazmikella still retained her dragon strength, being capable of stopping a [[frost giant]]'s [[warhammer]] many times her size as well as use it against it with ease, a feat that shocked many who bore witness.
