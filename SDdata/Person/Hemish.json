        "History": "In [[autumn]] of {{yearlink|1368}}, Hemish found a baby, [[Araluen|Ash]], close to [[Fullpoint]]. He could not find the foundling's parents, and so took her in, looking for advice from [[Mausa]] at some point. Within a month, he sought new clues close to where he had found her; all he found is that the spot where she was had turned to blight. On the way back to the village, Ash manifested the ability to heal and revitalize sick animals, using this ability on Mausa's horse; Hemish discovered she had a gift.\n\nIn the [[spring]] of {{yearlink|1373}}, Fullpoint was attacked by [[blightspawned]] [[volodni]] who took his daughter; he took an injury to his head during the fight, which incapacitated him.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|19|2}} A priest of [[Lurue]] come from afar, [[Marrec]], healed him, and explained that he had come to find a child in his care. Though Hemish was cagey at first, he finally revealed that he was not surprised someone had come for her, given her gift for healing.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|21-23|3}}\n\nWhen the priest returned with his adopted daughter, he asked Hemish to let her travel with him. Though initially reluctant to give her up, he soon relented.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|35-36|4}} Once Ash finally became the aspect Araluen, she still held Hemish in high regard, for his kindness.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|302}}"
