The gold-haired elf was of slender build and dressed in hunting leathers.
Erevain was a kind elf who felt a great desire to see all Faer√ªn and not take the Retreat to Evermeet.
He wielded an enchanted broad sword that was originally forged by the Greycloaks of Evereska.
He had a cousin named Xan, who himself was a member of the Greycloaks.
In Eleint of the , Erevain stayed at the Snowdrift Inn after traveling from Kuldahar in the Spine of the World. He was killed by spiders in Dragons Eye later that year.
