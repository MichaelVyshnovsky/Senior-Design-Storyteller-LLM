        "Description": "Slatey was a [[human]] woman with a sun-kissed skin tone, big brown eyes, and black hair gathered in tight cornrow braids.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], the [[half-orcish]] artist named [[Splatters Doolug]] spent his days painting murals on the [[Old Wall (Baldur's Gate)|Old Wall]]. His art faced criticism from some passersby like Slatey Marven, who thought Doolug took criticism poorly. She believed that artists were too soft and that their egos crumbled with a single negative comment, instead of taking the criticism as feedback to grow and improve."
