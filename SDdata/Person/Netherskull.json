        "mainbody": "'''Netherskull''' was a [[death tyrant]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Many years before the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], a [[beholder]] from the [[Underdark]] went into Undermontain. There it settled inside the [[Obstacle Course]] level and turned itself into a death tyrant, renaming itself Netherskull. It fought [[Halaster Blackcloak]] but the Mad Mage prevailed. However, Halaster decided not to destroy Netherskull, instead turning it into a dungeon guardian. Netherskull became the lord of the Obstacle Course level permitting Halaster to install his new magical traps here.\n\nAround [[1392 DR]], the Netherskull battled the paladin [[Fidelio]], but he returned as a [[ghost]] and fought Netherskull many times.",
        "Activities": "Netherskull resided in its sanctum, where it raised all its defeated foes as [[zombie]]s in its service. Nearby was an immense chasm created by its [[disintegrate]] ray, which Halaster had flooded with lava."
