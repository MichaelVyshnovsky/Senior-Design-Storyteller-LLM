        "mainbody": "orweg the Magnificent was a wizard who lived in Ravens Bluff in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nNorweg lived in a yellow one-story house on Magicians Row. It was the first of five houses.\nNorweg had a black cat familiar, smoked Saltweed tobacco, and was primarily a wine drinker.\nCirca 1357 DR, Norweg the Magnificent and Panese the Excitable separately stole two minor magic items of historical importance from the city vaults at approximately the same time. Norweg spilled some of his wine at one of the vaults. Though the thieves were unidentified, suspicions and divinations tracked them to Magicians Row. The City Guard serving Regent of the Exchequer Vernon Condor only had time to search two of the five houses before they earned their bosss ire, so they tried to deduce the culprits from what they knew of the five wizards in the neighborhood."
