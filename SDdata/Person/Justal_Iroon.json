        "History": "At some point before the turn of the 9{{th}} century, when Justal Iroon was already an old man, he was slain by [[Radellus]], who fancied his tower near [[Sreve]] for his own. Radellus flung Justal Iroon's smoking body the length of Sreve's main street; it was then whisked into the millpond, killing all its fish. Unknown to either mage, a young [[Kurtal]] snuck into the tower and stole three of Justal's spellbooks during the exchange of spells."
