        "Description": "In her [[human]] form, Gisentraxia appeared to be a light-skinned woman with brown eyes and hair. She wore face paint and had her hair gathered in a bun over an undershave.",
        "Relationships": "She was [[Palhavorithyn]]'s mate and a friend of [[Elminster Aumar]].",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Gisentraxia aided her friend Elminster in investigating the [[Weave]]. Later, she carried Elminster to the [[Dragonbone Vale]], where the [[Cult of the Dragon]], allied with the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], planned on making the prophecy of the ''[[Chronicle of Years to Come]]'' come true. She assumed her human form while assisting Sergeant [[Alphonse Knox]]'s troops and [[adventurer]]s from [[Neverwinter]], who operated out of the [[Shield of the North]] camp. However, Gisentraxia had a personal stake in the cult's sinister plot; she believed that Palhavorithyn, her beloved, was corrupted by foul magics."
