When Harkle took out the [[material component]]s for ''Melf's acid arrow'', Robillard recognized the spell instantly, and said that he knew Melf. Harkle was surprised and asked his age, and Robillard clarified that he didn't know him personally, but was familiar with his work. Robillard then cast ''Melf's minute meteors'' and Harkle commented \"Better Melf\".\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, Melf joined some noted champions of the [[Realms]] as they journeyed through the many places of [[Faer√ªn]]."
