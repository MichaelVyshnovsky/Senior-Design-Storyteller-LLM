'''Mizreal Everdark''' was a [[succubus]] from the [[Nine Hells]] that aligned herself with the [[Ashmadai]] in [[Helm's Hold]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
The succubus was guarded by a pair of [[blazing skeleton]]s.

==History==
Mizreal was slain in [[Faer√ªn]] during the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, by the [[Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]], when they ventured beneath the Cathedral of Helm to complete route the [[devil]]-worshiping Ashmadai cultists from the city.
