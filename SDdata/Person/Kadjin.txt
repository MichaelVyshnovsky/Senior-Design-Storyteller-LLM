'''Kadjin''' was the First Mate aboard the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

==Description==
Kadjin was an [[elf]] with sharp features and confident demeanor.

==History==
In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, Captain [[Lastri Kassireh]] and the ''Vigilant'' sailed from the [[Sword Coast]] to the nation of [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. Onboard the ship were several passengers, including [[Volothamp Geddarm]] who traveled to meet with a wealthy [[yuan-ti]] merchant, [[Sa'Sani]]. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled; freshwater [[barrel]]s ruptured; one of the crew, [[Kellen (sailor)|Kellen]], got drunk and drowned; Volo almost got poisoned; and new [[rope]]s became frayed.

Kadjin's life ended when the string of strange occurrences culminated in a deadly storm. The ''Vigilant's'' shipwreck was washed ashore not far from the city of [[Samargol]]. Most sailors perished in the storm, while others were captured to be eaten by the [[Batiri]].
