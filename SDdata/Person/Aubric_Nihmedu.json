        "mainbody": "Blademajor '''Aubric Nihmedu''' was a well-respected citizen of [[Evereska]] that served as one of the [[Swords of Evereska]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|When I am in too much pain to defend Evereska, you will know it by the pieces on the ground.|Aubric, to Artmaster [[Rhydwych Bourmay]].}}",
        "Personality": "The senior Nihmedu was a devoted father and brave warrior that remained wholly dedicated to the preservation of Evereska.",
        "Abilities": "In his younger years Aubric joined the ranks of the [[bladesinger]]s, fabled elven warriors that perfectly joined the disciplines of [[arcane magic]] and warcraft.\n\nHe was able to speak in \"peeptalk\" with small [[bird]]s, such as [[Manynests]] a messenger for Lord [[Erlan Duirsar]].",
        "Activities": "Aubric led the Swords of Evereska as a whole, along with the [[Noble Swords]] branch that served alongside the [[Lordly Wands]] commanded by Artmaster [[Rhydwych Bourmay]].\n\nHe helped train and educate Evereska's younger soldiers at the city's [[College of Arms]].",
        "Relationships": "Aubric had two children, [[Keya Nihmedu|Keya]] and [[Galaeron Nihmedu|Galaeron]], the latter of whom was a soldier of the [[Evereskan tomb guardian|Tomb Guard]].",
        "History": "On [[Nightal 30]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Aubric and his fellow Swords joined in a battle at [[Rocnest]] between the Evereskan elves and the recently-released [[phaerimm]] and their armies. Along with Armaster Bourmay, the Blademajor expertly navigated the battlefield until they encountered the group of [[Elven high mage|high mages]] that were in the process of forming a ''[[portal]]'' to allow the [[Waterdhavian]] army to bypass the [[Deadwall]] that the phaerimm established around the [[Shaeradim]]. Due to the valiant efforts of Aubric, Rhydwych, and the fellow Swords, along with the timely assistance of the [[chosen]] [[Khelben Arunsun]], the high mages were able to complete the ''portal''. During the battle however, Aubric suffered grevious wounds. He gave his life in service of Evereska, fighting one last time in the bladesinging art as he did in his youth."
