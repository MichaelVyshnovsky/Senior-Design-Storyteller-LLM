'''Zitembe''' ({{Pronounce|zeh|TEM|bay|refs=}}), known as '''Grandfather Zitembe''', was the head priest of the [[temple of Savras (Port Nyanzaru)|temple]] of [[Savras]] in [[Port Nyanzaru]] during the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Zitembe could conduct a ritual which could grant him visions from Savras relating to questions asked by visitors to the temple. He referred to this as "consulting the guides".

==History==
During the events of the [[death curse]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Zitembe was granted visions that allowed him to know that the curse stemmed from the city of [[Omu]]. At the same time, he had to contend with pressure from agents of the [[Zhentarim]] who wanted his help to [[scry]] the location of [[Artus Cimber]] and the ''[[Ring of Winter]]'', however he refused for fear of helping such [[evil]] individuals.

Following the end of the death curse, Zitembe was granted a vision from Savras which alerted him to the machinations of the [[yuan-ti abomination]] [[Kress'voon]], who was plotting to recreate the death curse in [[Orolunga]] with a device called the ''[[Death of the Sun]]''.{{Cite adventurers league/Fathomless Pits of Ill Intent|3}}
