        "mainbody": "'''Lanaxis''', also known as the '''Twilight Spirit''', was a [[titan]] of great size and strength and the origin of the titan race. He and [[Othea]] claimed the vast cold plains of [[Faerûn]], where Lanaxis constructed the citadel of [[Voninheim]].",
        "Relationships": "Lanaxis was the son of [[Annam All-Father]] and [[Othea]].",
        "History": "When [[Ulutiu]]'s amulet began to freeze northern [[Faerûn]], Lanaxis's citadel of [[Voninheim]] was put under threat, but Othea, his mother, forbade him to go after it. He immediately summoned his siblings and planned to go after the amulet anyway, but [[Dunmore]] refused to help. Lanaxis changed his plan, attempting to poison Othea, and inadvertently poisoned all of his siblings too, except Dunmore and [[Arno and Julian]]. Before Othea succumbed to the poison, she cursed Lanaxis to lose his immortality if he ever left her shadow. The sons of Lanaxis, the titans, fled to the plane of [[Arborea]]. The fate of Lanaxis was for a long time unknown.\n\nAfter the [[War of the Hart]], an apparition of unknown identity, called the Twilight Spirit, began appearing in [[Twilight Vale]] once a year, attracting a pilgrimage of [[giant]]s who believed it to speak a prophecy concerning the return of Annam All-Father to [[Abeir-Toril]]. It appeared as a large shadowy figure. Notably, the [[stormazîn]] [[Xephras]] did not believe this prophecy was true.\n\nUltimately, the Twilight Spirit was revealed to have been Lanaxis all along."
