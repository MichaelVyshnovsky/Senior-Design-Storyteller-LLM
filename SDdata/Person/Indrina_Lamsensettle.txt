Indrina Lamsensettle was a Neverwintian actress in the late 15 century DR. She belonged to the elite social circles of Neverwinter.
At some point, Indrina paid for genealogical research into the family history of Neverwinters ruler, Dagult Neverember.
In the late 1490s DR, Indrina and other three nobles were kidnapped by a group of Vecna cultists and taken to Neverwinters graveyard, Neverdeath. Indrina was certain that the mastermind behind her kidnapping was none other than Dagult Neverember. She believed he was planning to silence her to prevent her from divulging information that would prove Lord Neverember had no blood ties to Lord Nasher Alagondar. In truth, he was unconcerned with her findings.
