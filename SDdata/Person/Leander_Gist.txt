Lord '''Leander Gist''' was a [[patriar]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Lord Gist was a portly snowy-bearded man, wrapped in layers of heavy and expensive [[satin]]s and a frumpy hat.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a portrait of Leander Gist painted by [[Oskar Fevras]] was kept in the attic of the [[Jannath estate]] of Baldur's Gate. That year, it became possessed by wailing [[poltergeist]] unwittingly summoned by the painter. The picture aggressively yelled at observers, "Bastard bog [[goblin]]! Get out!" Other copies of the same painting were seen across the city of Baldur's Gate.
