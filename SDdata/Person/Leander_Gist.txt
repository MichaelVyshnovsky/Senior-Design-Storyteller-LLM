Lord Leander Gist was a patriar of Baldurs Gate sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.
Lord Gist was a portly snowy-bearded man, wrapped in layers of heavy and expensive satins and a frumpy hat.
In the , a portrait of Leander Gist painted by Oskar Fevras was kept in the attic of the Jannath estate of Baldurs Gate. That year, it became possessed by wailing poltergeist unwittingly summoned by the painter. The picture aggressively yelled at observers, "Bastard bog goblin! Get out!" Other copies of the same painting were seen across the city of Baldurs Gate.
