        "History": "In [[1487 DR]], Manarlume and her sister [[Lelavdra Tanthul]] were summoned by High Prince [[Telamont Tanthul]], who ordered them to gather in a kind of club all the young ambitious [[arcanist]]s, and seduce the most suspicious in order to uncover all plots against Telamont. The Most High hinted that he knew about the ambitions of both Manarlume and Lelavdra and that new princesses could be easily sired if the sisters betrayed him.\n\nLater, Manalume reported that she and her sister had found a very dangerous arcanist, [[Gwelt]], who was plotting to kill all of the Princes of Shade.\n\nAfter [[Larloch]] shattered the minds of most of the shadovar arcanists, Gwelt went to Manarlume and Lelavdra, saying that he loved them both. They started discussing how to survive the fighting. Later, among the ruins of the collapsed [[Thultanthar]], the three laughed about the stupidity of the High Prince.",
        "Relationships": "Manarlume was a daughter of [[Dethud Tanthul]] like her sister Lelavdra."
