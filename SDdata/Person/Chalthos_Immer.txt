'''Chalthos Immer''' was a man living in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. He was the proprietor of the [[Immerhand Inn]].

Chalthos Immer was once a mercenary warrior. During his career, he relied on huge [[lantern|storm lanterns]]. He also managed to loot a number of paintings from all around [[Faer没n]].

He later retired to Wheloon to run the Immerhand Inn by [[1358 DR]], and was still in business ''circa'' [[1369 DR]]. He furnished each room of his inn with his favored storm lanterns, and with one of his looted paintings.
