Chalthos Immer was a man living in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr. He was the proprietor of the Immerhand Inn.
Chalthos Immer was once a mercenary warrior. During his career, he relied on huge storm lanterns. He also managed to loot a number of paintings from all around Faerûn.
He later retired to Wheloon to run the Immerhand Inn by 1358 DR, and was still in business circa 1369 DR. He furnished each room of his inn with his favored storm lanterns, and with one of his looted paintings.
