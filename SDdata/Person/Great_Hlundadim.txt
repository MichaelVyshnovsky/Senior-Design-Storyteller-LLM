Great Hlundadim was a mysterious wizard who founded the goblin realm of Hlundadim, only to disappear centuries later.
Great Hlundadim was a powerful spellcaster and masterful leader, gaining the allegiance of countless goblinoids and other humanoids and engendering great loyalty and trust from them.
Great Hlundadim first appeared in -393 DR in the dying days of Netheril, and rallied the tribes of the Windy Plains, including goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, orcs, gnolls, and kobolds, as well as some humans. They constructed the fortress-city of Araugul and formed the nation of Hlundadim, waging war upon neighboring realms for centuries and dominating the region known as the Goblin Marches.
His armies ravaged Anauria, Tarkhaldale, and Cormyr, but the devastating dust storms that heralded the expansion of Anauroch in 268 DR caused his subjects to panic and flee south. As Araugul was abandoned, Great Hlundadim disappeared without a trace.
Great Hlundadim never returned to the Goblin Marches, but his legacy was well-remembered by the many tribes and warbands that originated from his great armies, his name a sign of power to be invoked in times of danger.
* The exact nature of Great Hlundadim was unknown, with guesses including him being a former arcanist of Netheril, or a traveler from another plane.
* The dwarven realm of Tethyamar was destroyed in 1104 DR by an army of orcs supported by powerful magic and summoned monsters, led by an individual claiming to be Great Hlundadim.
