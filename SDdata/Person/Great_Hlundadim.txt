'''Great Hlundadim''' was a mysterious [[wizard]] who founded the goblin realm of [[Hlundadim]], only to disappear centuries later.

==Abilities==
Great Hlundadim was a powerful spellcaster and masterful leader, gaining the allegiance of countless [[goblinoid]]s and other [[humanoid]]s and engendering great loyalty and trust from them.

==History==
Great Hlundadim first appeared in [[-393 DR]] in the dying days of [[Netheril]], and rallied the tribes of the [[Windy Plains]], including [[goblin]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, [[bugbear]]s, [[orc]]s, [[gnoll]]s, and [[kobold]]s, as well as some [[human]]s. They constructed the fortress-city of [[Araugul]] and formed the nation of Hlundadim, waging war upon neighboring realms for centuries and dominating the region known as the [[Goblin Marches]].

His armies ravaged [[Anauria]], [[Tarkhaldale]], and [[Cormyr]], but the devastating dust storms that heralded the expansion of [[Anauroch]] in [[268 DR]] caused his subjects to panic and flee south. As Araugul was abandoned, Great Hlundadim disappeared without a trace.

Great Hlundadim never returned to the Goblin Marches, but his legacy was well-remembered by the many tribes and warbands that originated from his great armies, his name a sign of power to be invoked in times of danger.

==Rumors & Legends==
* The exact nature of Great Hlundadim was unknown, with guesses including him being a former [[arcanist]] of [[Netheril]], or a traveler from another plane.
* The [[Dwarf|dwarven]] realm of [[Tethyamar]] was destroyed in [[1104 DR]] by an army of orcs supported by powerful magic and summoned monsters, led by an individual claiming to be Great Hlundadim.
