        "mainbody": "'''Veris''' was a [[Cyric]]-worshiping pirate on the [[Moonsea]] in [[1367 DR]].",
        "Description": "Veris was a one-eyed, bald, and scarred man.",
        "Personality": "Veris was a cruel man; he enjoyed playing deadly jokes on his victims. His favorite joke was to take all crew and passengers from a captured vessel while his men looted it, before allowing them to board again and leave. However, once they were back on board, Veris ordered his men to shoot the ship with flaming arrows and then pick the people off as they escaped the burning ship. Needless to say, they were skilled archers.",
        "History": "Veris was a devotee of Cyric who remained loyal to [[Zhentil Keep]]. At some point, he went into piracy and became quite notorious for his actions. His ship was the ''[[Purple Star]]''."
