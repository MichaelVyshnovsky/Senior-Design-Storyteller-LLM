'''Bryn Kernwyld''' was a [[druid]] of [[Chauntea]] who inhabited the [[Moonshae Isles]]. She was known for creating several spells unique to her faith.{{Cite web/Earthmother's Weapons}}

==History==
Although the precise time period during which Bryn lived was unknown, sages agreed that it was likely anterior to [[1000 DR]]. She was known as the author of ''[[Earthmother's Weapons]]'', a book containing several unique spells: ''[[bone talisman]]'', ''[[Frostbite (transmutation spell)|frostbite]]'', ''[[horrible taste]]'' and ''[[wolfskin]]''.

She created those spells to help her brethren during the wars which opposed the forces of [[Malar]] and [[Bhaal]] and the civilized people inhabiting the [[Moonshae Isles]]. They proved a great help to minimize the damage wars caused to the surrounding nature.
