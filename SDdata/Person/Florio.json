He felt a responsibility toward his companions.\nFlorio was a warrior who, with his friend the elven druid Nualion Galanodel, the dwarven cleric Rorik Ironheart, and the human ranger Kyra, decided to form an adventuring party in Selgaunt.\nIn 1491 DR, they went to Mulmaster with the intention of exploring some dwarven ruins in the Earthspur Mountains, but the City Watch Sergeant Audra Maskyr hired them to explore the citys sewers. During the exploration, they fought some large rats and lost Rorik Ironheart in a flood. At this point, Florio and the others met another adventuring party sent by Sergeant Maskyr and, with their help, Florio and his companions escaped the sewers with their lives."
