During the exploration, they fought some large [[rat]]s and lost Rorik Ironheart in a flood. At this point, Florio and the others met another adventuring party sent by Sergeant Maskyr and, with their help, Florio and his companions escaped the sewers with their lives.{{Cite adventurers league/Foulness Beneath Mulmaster|9}}"
