        "mainbody": "'''Artiuk''' was a loyal [[half-orc]] bodyguard to the [[tiefling]] merchant [[Vadin'ya]] of [[Samargol]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].",
        "Description": "Artiuk was a stout and short gray-skinned half-orc. His silent demeanor and no-nonsense attitude gave him an intimidating presence.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Artiuk and his feisty mistress were doing business in the capital of [[Samarach]]â€“Samargol. The half-orc could be seen guarding the merchant's tent in the [[Openpalm Bazar]], the only district open to very few select outsiders. During that time, Artiuk oversaw dealings between a group of hirelings of a local merchant [[Sa'Sani]] and his mistress.\n\nAmong the items Vadin'ya sought to procure was an [[axe]], touched by fire elemental magic of [[firenewt]]s who took over [[salt]] [[Mines of Selgol]]. She claimed that the axe was for Artiuk."
