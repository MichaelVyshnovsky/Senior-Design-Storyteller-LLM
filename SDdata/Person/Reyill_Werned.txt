Reyill Werned was a greengrocer in Hillsfar in the late 15 century DR.
Reyill went to farms outside the city to buy foodstuffs and repackaged them for sale inside Hillsfar.
Circa 1486 DR, Reyill was drinking with his halfling friends at the Plodding Plow, in the village of the Stop.
Reyill was no racist but being pragmatic, he knew not to voice his opinion about the Great Law of Hunanity inside Hillsfar.
Reyill was a friend of the halflings Roge Applewink, Narder Ulthub, and Guylian Stundter.
