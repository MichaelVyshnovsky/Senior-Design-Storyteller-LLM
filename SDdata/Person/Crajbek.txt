'''Crajbek''' was the Chieftain of the [[kobold]] tribe that laired in the infamous [[Haunted Halls]] near the village of [[Eveningstar]] in [[Cormyr]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
In the 15{{th}} century DR, Crajbek's gang included High Priest [[Pimulpekk]] of [[Kurtulmak]], who led a group of priests. When a group of adventurers who fell through a rift to [[Toril]] from the world of [[Eberron]] investigated the haunted depths of the dungeon, they faced High Priest Pimulpekk and Crajbek, possibly slaying both and claiming the kobold tribe's looted treasures.
