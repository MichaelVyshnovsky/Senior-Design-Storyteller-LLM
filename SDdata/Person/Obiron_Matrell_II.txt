'''Obiron Matrell II''' and his twin sister [[Quindy Matrell]] were the youngest members of the noble merchant [[House Matrell]] as of [[1373 DR]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080519045858/http://ww2.wizards.com/Books/Wizards/?doc=fr_vambrancp| title = Character Profile: Vambran Matrell| accessdate = 12-21-2021| date = 12-21-2021}}

==Personality==
As a kid, Obiron was a wild child who once terrified the entire household by yelling and charging across the gardens of the Matrell estate waving around a loaded [[crossbow]]. Both twins were affectionate with their family and especially showed love for young Emriana.

==History==
Obiron and his sister were born on [[Ches 4]] of the {{YearlinkName|1365}} to father [[Evester Matrell]], who was business savvy heir to the family's trade, and to mother [[Marga Talricci]] of [[House Talricci]]. Young Quindy showed interest in all things traditionally feminine, very much like her mother, while Obiron Matrell II was more akin to his father.

On [[Tarsakh 13]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, both twins were present at Emriana Matrell's grand sixteenth birthday celebration, a big occasion for the nobility of [[Arrabar]]. During the celebration, they witnessed an assassination attempt on the family's elderly yet willful matriarch [[Hetta Matrell]]. The assassination attempt was later revealed to have been orchestrated by a sneak coin cabal that included the twins' own father, Evester Matrell.

Later the same year, the twins were kidnapped by the surviving member of the same cabal â€“ [[Grozier Talricci]]. Marga Talricci, the twins' mother, was ensorcelled to remain silent but managed to write down the culprit's name on a piece of paper. Quindy and Obiron were rescued by Emriana and her mercenary aunt [[Xaphira Matrell]].
