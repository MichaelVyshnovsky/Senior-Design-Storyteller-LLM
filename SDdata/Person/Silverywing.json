They both had made a bargain: the prince got the egg and, twenty years later, the dragon, in exchange for a special [[moon elf]] as a sacrifice.\n\nDurothil kept Silverywing confined within his magical dimension. Silverywing grew to develop a love for learning and beauty. She and Durothil created attacks and [[:Category:Spells|spells]] together.",
            "Freedom and death": "After 20 years of confinement, Durothil planned to let Silverywing go free, and sent [[Sharlario Moonflower]] to the top of a mountain in preparation. Mahatnartorian appeared and attacked Sharlario. Silverywing emerged from the magical dimension, ridden by Durothil, and attacked Mahatnartorian, but she was not powerful enough to defeat the great wyrm. The fight was over quickly and resulted in the deaths of Silverywing, Mahatnartorian, and Durothil himself."
