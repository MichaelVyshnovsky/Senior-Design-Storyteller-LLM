        "mainbody": "Silverywing was a young silver dragon. She lived in the Dawn Age and served the legendary gold elf Prince Durothil. She died at age 20, in combat with the red dragon Mahatnartorian.\nDurothil received Silverywings dragon-egg from the ancient red great wyrm Mahatnartorian, who killed her mother and gave the egg to the prince. They both had made a bargain the prince got the egg and, twenty years later, the dragon, in exchange for a special moon elf as a sacrifice.\nDurothil kept Silverywing confined within his magical dimension. Silverywing grew to develop a love for learning and beauty. She and Durothil created attacks and spells together.\nAfter 20 years of confinement, Durothil planned to let Silverywing go free, and sent Sharlario Moonflower to the top of a mountain in preparation. Mahatnartorian appeared and attacked Sharlario. Silverywing emerged from the magical dimension, ridden by Durothil, and attacked Mahatnartorian, but she was not powerful enough to defeat the great wyrm. The fight was over quickly and resulted in the deaths of Silverywing, Mahatnartorian, and Durothil himself."
