'''Alisannara Morcane''' was a female [[drow]] and the High Priestess of [[Lolth]] in [[Szith Morcane]].

==History==
She was consumed by a ''[[destruction]]'' spell when followers of [[Kiaransalee]] from [[Maerimydra]] overthrew [[House Morcane]]. Afterward, Alisannara remained in the [[Fane of Lolth]] above House Morcane as a [[keening spirit]] attacking any who entered its inner fane.

==Description==
Alisannara was a stern drow [[cleric]] of slight proportions, dressed in a black robe trimmed with purple and burgundy. In death, she looked much the same although she manifested as a hazy and insubstantial version of her living self.
