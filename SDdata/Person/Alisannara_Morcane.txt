Alisannara Morcane was a female drow and the High Priestess of Lolth in Szith Morcane.
She was consumed by a destruction spell when followers of Kiaransalee from Maerimydra overthrew House Morcane. Afterward, Alisannara remained in the Fane of Lolth above House Morcane as a keening spirit attacking any who entered its inner fane.
Alisannara was a stern drow cleric of slight proportions, dressed in a black robe trimmed with purple and burgundy. In death, she looked much the same although she manifested as a hazy and insubstantial version of her living self.
