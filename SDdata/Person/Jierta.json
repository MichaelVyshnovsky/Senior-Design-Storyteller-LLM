        "History": "Jierta was one of the warriors in Jarl [[Greigor Kundknoddick]]'s tribe, who allied with [[drow]] and [[orc]]s during the [[Darkening]].\n\nIn [[1485 DR]], during the late stages of the [[War of the Silver Marches]], Jierta reported to Greigor that an army from [[Silverymoon]] had defeated their [[orc]] allies. Soon after, Gregor was approached by [[Jarlaxle]], who suggested he withdraw his troops in the wake of the imminent defeat of [[Many-Arrows]]."
