'''Raelis Shai''' was a [[tiefling]] [[bard]] who was the leader of an actor's troupe based in [[Sigil]] circa the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] on the world of [[Toril]].

==Relationships==
Among the fellow actors in Raelis' troupe were the [[blade (kit)|blade]] [[Haer'Dalis]] and two other individuals.

==History==
At some point, Raelis penned a play titled ''[[A Comedy of Terrors]]'', which was quite critical of [[Rowan Darkwood|Duke Rowan Darkwood]]. Having passed it off as the work of another author, she and her fellow actors actually performed the play on Sigil. When Duke Blackwood got wind of the performers he sent bounty hunters after the troupe.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Raelis' companion Haer'Dalis tried to steal a ''[[portal gem]]'' from the [[mage]] [[Mekrath]] in Athkatla, in order that the troupe could escape [[Toril]] via the [[Astral Plane]]. Unfortunately Haer'Dalis was caught and imprisoned within Mekrath's lair in Athkatla's sewer system.

During that time the troupe tried to continue to put on plays in the theater beneath the [[Five Flagons]]. Unfortunately their new understudy [[Biff]] did not have the same acting chops as Haer'dalis.
