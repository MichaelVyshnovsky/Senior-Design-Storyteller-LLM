In , he played Three-Dragon Ante against Warian Datharathi somewhere north of Cathyr in Dambrath the last hand was interrupted by Bui the Hog, who chose that moment to pick a fight with Warian. He restrained Warian early in the fight, and then attempted to expertly disable him with a blood choke. Warians arm awakened to its powers while in that blood choke, and Yasha was thrown into a wall, where he stopped moving. Warian left the tavern afterwards before finding out whether Yashas injuries were mortal."
