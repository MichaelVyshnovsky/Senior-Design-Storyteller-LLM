        "mainbody": "'''Yasha''' was a gambler. In {{yearlink|1374}}, he played [[Three-Dragon Ante]] against [[Warian Datharathi]] somewhere north of [[Cathyr]] in [[Dambrath]]; the last hand was interrupted by [[Bui|Bui the Hog]], who chose that moment to pick a fight with Warian. He restrained Warian early in the fight, and then attempted to expertly disable him with a blood choke.{{cite book/Darkvision|20-21}} Warian's [[plangent|arm]] awakened to its powers while in that blood choke, and Yasha was thrown into a wall, where he stopped moving. Warian left the tavern afterwards before finding out whether Yasha's injuries were mortal.{{cite book/Darkvision|23-24}}"
