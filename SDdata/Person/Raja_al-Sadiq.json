Her group removed a unique talisman they discovered from the ruins, unknowingly breaking the seal that had kept Tisan Balshareska, the Arch Geomancer, imprisoned for ages.\nTisan struck a deal with Raja, tasking her to retrieve the Seal of Suhail min Zann in exchange for rulership and power. Raja used Tabati, an invisible stalker and her servant, to track down the seal. Both Tisan and Raja were bound by a geas so they could not betray each other, but unbeknownst to Raja, Tisan planned to use a wish to safely break the geas when the seal was retrieved."
