        "mainbody": "Rûlgar was an orc ranger and rogue in Thar in the early 1370s DR.\nAround 1369 DR, Rûlgar went with his sister Jurrg to the Xûl-Jarak citadel in search of a fabled orc leader that Jurrg had seen in a dream sent by Gruumsh. There they met three just-arrived orogs Naazlog, Daazlag, and their leader Thrull. Jurrg proclaimed them \"sons of Gruumsh\" and Thrull the new king of Thar. Together they started to build a new orc kingdom.\nAround 1374 DR, Rûlgar found the Hammer of Gruumsh in a cave in the Galena Mountains and Jurrg saw this as a sign that the time of Thrulls rule was near. Meanwhile, thanks to Daazlag, the orcs captured the scions of five powerful noble houses of Melvaunt. Jurrg planned to ritually sacrifice them in a crowning ceremony for Thrull.\nWhen adventurers came in search of the scions, Rûlgar was in the temple to Gruumsh inside Xûl-Jarak together with Thrull and four orc warriors, waiting for the start of the ceremony to proclaim Thrull king of all Thar."
