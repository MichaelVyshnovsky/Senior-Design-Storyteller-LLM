The next year, hoping to use the node as a means to summon an army of elementals, he and a several other survivors from his family first gathered a small army of monsters and traveled through the portal. They caught the Netherese off-guard and conquered Tzindylspar in less than a tenday.\nNadim and his followers transformed the earth node into a dao shrine, but he died of heartstop before he could perform the magic to open a portal to the Plane of Earth. Because Nadim had sealed the portal back to Calimshan, he followers—none of whom possessed his magical talent—could return home."
