        "History": "In the Third Age of [[Calimshan]], there was steady trade in [[rubies]] between the [[Netheril|Netherese]] city of [[Tzindylspar]] and Calimshan, by means of a ''[[portal]]''. with the death of Nadim's relative [[Syl-Pasha]] [[Violir el Cajaan IX|Violir IX]].\n\nPower-hungry Nadim sought a means of overthrowing the beholders who now enslaved his people, and he devised a plan. He strongly suspected that the ruby vein of Tzindylspar surrounded an [[earth node]] with a link to the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]. The [[-1427 DR|next year]], hoping to use the node as a means to summon an army of [[elemental]]s, he and a several other survivors from [[Cajaan Dynasty|his family]] first gathered a small army of monsters and traveled through the ''portal''. They caught the Netherese off-guard and conquered Tzindylspar in less than a [[tenday]].\n\nNadim and his followers transformed the earth node into a [[dao]] shrine, but he died of [[heartstop]] before he could perform the magic to open a ''portal'' to the Plane of Earth. Because Nadim had sealed the ''portal'' back to Calimshan, he followers—none of whom possessed his magical talent—could return home."
