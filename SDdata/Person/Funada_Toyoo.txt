Funada Toyoo was the administrator of Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
Often his brother the daimyo Funada Mitsuhide was in Uwaji in attendance to the shogun and during these times it was Toyoo that ran the city. The two brothers feuded over whether the next daimyo of Nakamaru would be the son of Mistsuhide or the son of Toyoo. Mistuhide was trying to discreetly remove Toyoo from his position as administrator of the town
Toyoo was more sly than Mitsuhide but lacked patience, preferring a swift and decisive victory even if at extreme cost.
