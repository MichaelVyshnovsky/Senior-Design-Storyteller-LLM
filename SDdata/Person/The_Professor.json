Spare me the story behind the name – I'm sure it's very scary. Fair warning – the guildmaster wants no fraternizing with the Zhentarim.

        "Description": "The Professor was a [[half-elf]], evident by his bushy and well-trimmed mutton chops and mustache. His long hair, tied in a bun, and eyes were brown and his skin was of brownish-green hue, as was common among the [[wood elves]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Stone Lord]] began threatening the Guild, and it caused an underground guild war between the upstart, controlled by the dreaded [[Cult of the Absolute]], and the Guild. The Professor was a well-informed member of the criminal organization who kept track of the Guild's operations in the field and warned the Guild's agents against fraternizing the members of the [[Zhentarim]], who were hired to help the Guild against the upstart kingpin. He could be often found in the [[Guildhall]], the Guild's illicit club and its stronghold in the [[Undercity]] in Baldur's Gate's [[Lower City]]."
