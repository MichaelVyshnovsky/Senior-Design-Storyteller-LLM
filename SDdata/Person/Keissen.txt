'''Keissen''' was a [[thief]] who had a talent for the shadowy arts.

==Relationships==
The man was romantically involved with [[Osala]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1374 DR]], Keissen set out to the [[Battle of Bones]] on an expedition. He was to recover an orb and then bring it to the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. In return, he was offered a huge amount of money. Despite the huge sum of money offered, it appears that he was [[charm]]ed or hypnotized, as he became obsessed with finding the orb. Should anything bad happen, he would meet his lover, Osala, in the [[Elfsong Tavern]].

Keissen set out, but was killed upon returning the orb, as its powers were unleashed. When placed, [[undead]] spawned from the orb, and killed him. Osala waited in their meeting spot for three days until she was approached by a trio of adventurers. They sought him out, and found him dead.
