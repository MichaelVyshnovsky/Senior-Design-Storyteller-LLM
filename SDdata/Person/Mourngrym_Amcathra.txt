Mourngrym Amcathra (
Mourngrym was born to the noble Amcathra family of Waterdeep. As a child, he had everything he ever needed as well as lots of friends and a good knowledge of how Waterdeep worked. Still, he felt unfulfilled, as if he wasnt doing enough to make himself useful. In his early teens, he began training to use weapons which served him well when he ended up aiding an associate of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun. Khelben watched the youth with interest from then on and noticed his martial skill and his ability to remain persuasive under duress.
Mourngrym became affiliated with the Harpers and, through them, Khelben encouraged him to join Doust Sulwood, the current lord of Shadowdale in his adventures. He became an important member of the Knights of Myth Drannor.thumb|242x242px|Mourngrym Amcathra during one of his visits to the Elminsters Tower.
In 1353 DR, when Doust Sulwood gave up the rule of Shadowdale to return to adventuring, he chose Mourngrym to be his successor, and Mourngrym accepted. Although Mourngrym had been sent from Waterdeep by Khelben Arunsun for other reasons, Doust recognized and admired his honesty and ambition to help protect Shadowdale, and was inspired to pass on the lordship.
A few years later, in 1355 DR, a diplomatic envoy from Cormyr named Shaerl Rowanmantle was sent by Vangerdahast to investigate why the last two lords of Shadowdale were both "chosen" by Khelben. Shortly after her arrival in Shadowdale, Mourngrym fell in love with the young spirited and beautiful thief. The Lords feelings were reciprocated but Mourngrym could not approve of Shaerls profession. That conflict led the couple to drift apart. Subsequently, Shaerl and Mourngrym found themselves facing against an overwhelming horde of fiends from Myth Drannor. The beautiful and brave thief sacrificed her life to save Mourngryms, and with her gone, he came to terms with his deep love for Shaerl. He avenged her death and embarked on a long quest to have his love resurrected. Eventually, he succeeded and was reunited with Shaerl. Soon after in 1355 DR, they were married.
In 1357 DR, Mourngrym became acquainted with the hero Alias and her companions Olive Ruskettle, Akabar Bel Akash, and Dragonbait, after the adventurers broke Shadow Gaps occupation by the Iron Throne. The mountain pass was guarded by a monstrous Kalmari, effectively stopping the trade with Shadowdale. Lord Mourngrym extended Alias the gratitude of Shadowdale.

In 1358 DR, three years after their marriage, Shaerl was pregnant with Mourngryms son. One night, the Lord of Shadowdale was busy supervising Elminster and his new guests Dwalimar Omen and Foxilon Cardluck. During the meeting, Foxilon wandered off inside Elminsters Tower and accidentally released a magically trapped assassin. Mourngrym and Elminsters guests were holding the hulking creature off when he attacked very pregnant Shaerl and attempted to take her hostage. The assassin did not expect the woman to be able to defend herself. The Lady of Shadowdale elbowed the assassin in the stomach and knocked him out with a punch. The stress of the fight caused her to go into labor shortly after. Luckily, her husband, Elminster, and Foxilon were able to deliver her child. The baby was named Scotti.
Mourngrym was nearly killed by the avatar of the god Bane when the second battle of Shadowdale broke out during the Time of Troubles that same year. The lord of Shadowdale was saved by his sergeant-at-arms Mayheir Hawksguard. 
When the adventurers Midnight and Adon were brought in under suspicion of murdering the Old Sage Elminster following the battle, Mourngrym was devastated but fulfilled his duty and presided over their trial. While he wound up serving as a witness by their defender in court Thurbal. In the end, Mourngrym found them guilty and sentenced them to death. Fortunately, the adventurers escaped their fate when they were "rescued" by their companion Cyric. 
Mourngrym finally met his match in the summer of 1375 DR when his body was possessed by Yder Tanthul. Despite his rescue from this state, Mourngrym became depressed at his inability to protect himself and his people and offered to step down as lord of Shadowdale. He handed the Pendant of Ashaba over to Azalar Falconhand and rejoined the Knights of Myth Drannor.
