'''Randil Moorwatch''' was a mercenary in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], Randil and his [[Blue Griffon Company]] were hired by the [[Sembia]]n lord [[Borstag Duncastle]] to participate in the [[Cormanthor War]]. However, later, Randil and his men passed into the command of [[Miklos Selkirk]].

Randil and his men intercepted [[Ilsevele Miritar]] and [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]], who were on a diplomatic mission, and questioned them.
