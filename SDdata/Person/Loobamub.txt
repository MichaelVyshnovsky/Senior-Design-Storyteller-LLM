'''Loobamub''' was a [[myconid]] and leader of the [[Circle of Hunters]] in [[Neverlight Grove]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When, ''circa'' [[1486 DR]], [[Zuggtmoy]]'s will twisted most of the Grove, Loobamub and the Circle resisted the evil influence.

==Personality==
A loyal follower of Basidia, Loobamub shared its leader's concerns about the strange behavior of [[Phylo]] and its followers. Loobamub kept its opinions to itself, but its wariness spread to the other hunters when they melded, cementing their loyalty to Basidia. Loobamub's main concern was redirecting the [[spore servant]]s and ''[[awaken]]ed'' [[zurkhwood]]s Phylo created away from its circle's territory.
