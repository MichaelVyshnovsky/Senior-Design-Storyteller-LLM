        "mainbody": "'''Chantos Graybeard''' was a businessman and [[wizard]] in [[Skullport]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Chantos was a gentleman mage known for his quick wit and complex, but deft, hand gestures during spell casting. He disliked [[Nestor Podgin]] and planned to ruin him.",
        "Possessions": "He was never seen without his midnight blue ''[[cloak of displacement]]'', his ''[[ring of shooting stars]]'', and at least three ''[[ioun stones]]''. He always carried with him a ''[[wand of fire]]'' and a ''[[dagger of throwing]]'' that was particularly devestating against beings from the [[lower planes]]. This last item was a prize he had discovered during the adventures of his youth.",
        "Activities": "With three partners&mdash;[[Aurin|Aurin the Generous]], [[Ysele|Ysele the Cat]], and Lord [[Ithvar Wordkiller]]&mdash;Chantos co-owned and managed [[Hired Horrors]], a business of breeding and selling [[deepspawn]], usually for dungeons.",
        "Relationships": "Aurin and Chantos had been good friends for five decades, and shared a bond of mutual respect that made it nearly impossibe to drive a wedge between them. Ysvele and Ithvar were too greedy for Chantos.",
        "History": "In his youth, Chantos once adventured in the [[High Forest]] with Aurin. Arriving in Skullport, he, Aurin, Ysele, and Ithvar created the deepspawn breeding business.\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], he began to doubt Aurin's leadership of the business. He was especially concerned with the appearance of a competitor, Nestor Podgin's [[Monsters Made to Order]], and would try everything to ruin him.",
