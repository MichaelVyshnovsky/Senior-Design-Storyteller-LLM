        "mainbody": "Chantos Graybeard was a businessman and wizard in Skullport during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nChantos was a gentleman mage known for his quick wit and complex, but deft, hand gestures during spell casting. He disliked Nestor Podgin and planned to ruin him.\nHe was never seen without his midnight blue cloak of displacement, his ring of shooting stars, and at least three ioun stones. He always carried with him a wand of fire and a dagger of throwing that was particularly devestating against beings from the lower planes. This last item was a prize he had discovered during the adventures of his youth.\nWith three partners&mdashAurin the Generous, Ysele the Cat, and Lord Ithvar Wordkiller&mdashChantos co-owned and managed Hired Horrors, a business of breeding and selling deepspawn, usually for dungeons.\nAurin and Chantos had been good friends for five decades, and shared a bond of mutual respect that made it nearly impossibe to drive a wedge between them. Ysvele and Ithvar were too greedy for Chantos.\nIn his youth, Chantos once adventured in the High Forest with Aurin. Arriving in Skullport, he, Aurin, Ysele, and Ithvar created the deepspawn breeding business.\nIn 1370 DR, he began to doubt Aurins leadership of the business. He was especially concerned with the appearance of a competitor, Nestor Podgins Monsters Made to Order, and would try everything to ruin him.\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryIlluskans\nCategoryBusinesspeople\nCategoryInhabitants of Skullport\nCategoryInhabitants of Undermountain\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nbhxiwhluxjpe4sv5hsz3s913bxhsiq3"
