        "mainbody": "olan the Healer was a cleric of Waukeen from the town of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale who served under Quinn Silverfinger, the Grand Syndar of Waukeen in the early 14 century DR.\nNolan was a pale-skinned human male with blond hair. He was adorned in a simple set of chainmail and used a warhammer to defend himself.\nNolan the Healer looked down on nature-worshiping priests and penniless rangers. He thought their faith to be questionable and their disregard for money and trade blasphemous. Despite that opinion, Nolan thought that the help of those poor rangers would be helpful in safeguarding Targos via their tracking skills and knowledge of the surrounding lands. He did respect their abilities to enlist aid from tundra animals via nature magics.\nNolan served the Merchants Friend in the town of Lonelywood, but eventually he was shipped to Targos as a \"penance\" for greed running too thickly in Nolans blood. The Healer took his punishment from his superior, the \"runt\" Quinn Silverfinger, with disdain. Nolan was tasked with seeking new trade routes out for Lonelywood. During this \"penance\", the town of Targos became besieged by orc and goblin forces in the service of the Legion of the Chimera that sought to level the Ten-Towns. Begrudgingly, Nolan was forced to lend his magical healing to the towns defenders at the palisades.\nDuring the siege, Nolan sneered at mercenaries who aided the town against the goblin horde. He begrudgingly healed battle wounds but refused to treat frostbite. Self-admittedly, Nolans healing skills were nowhere as potent as those of the war-priests found in Targoss Pavilion. He was ordered by commander Shawford Crale to remain in the home taken over by the palisades commanderâ€”an order that Nolan obeyed willingly, as it was well away from goblin arrows."
