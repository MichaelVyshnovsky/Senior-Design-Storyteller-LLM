        "mainbody": "'''Aldernar''' was a cousin of [[Ivus Barbarak]], the proprietor of the [[Holdfast Inn]] in [[Liam's Hold]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Aldernar was a member of the [[Amn]]ian navy and often found himself traveling across the [[Sea of Swords]]. During that time, he resided in the city of [[Athkatla]]. At one point before [[1372 DR]], Aldernar sent his dead cousin a huge curious [[nautilus]] shell he claimed to have found on the [[Moonshae Isles]]. However, Ivus Barbarak suspected the sailor simply bought the shell in the markets of the [[Waukeen's Promenade]]."
