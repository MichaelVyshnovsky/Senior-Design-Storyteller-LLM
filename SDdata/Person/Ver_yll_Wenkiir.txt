'''Ver'yll Wenkiir''' was a [[Lolthite]] [[drow]] [[ranger]] and a poet, who lived and died in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Ver'yll was a drow man with long white hair, partially dyed in pink. As a ranger, he wore [[leather armor]] and wielded a [[bow]].

==History==
By the time Ver'yll Wenkiir died in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, he was was a romantic ranger who spent his days penning poems dedicated to twilights, [[tree]]s, and noble beasts, like a [[hedgehog]]. At some point after the rise of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], Ver'yll declined joining and was torn apart by the cultists. The drow soul yearned for revenge against the deadly cult, and Ver'yll Wenkiir was among the dozen individuals plucked from the [[Fugue Plane]], chosen by the entity [[Withers]] to aid in his campaign against the [[Dead Three]] and their Cult of the Absolute.
