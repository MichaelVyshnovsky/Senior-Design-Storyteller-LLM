'''Brother Gregor''' was an [[alchemist]] dedicated to [[Oghma]] who lived in the city of [[Ormpetarr]] around [[1479 DR]].  Gregor was touched by wild magic and had a [[spellscar]] that allowed him to know the effects that any ingredients would have on a potion.

==History==
Gregor was apprenticed to an alchemist at an early age. Later in life, he was touched by the [[Spellplague]] and acquired a spellscar that gave him abilities that made him one of the best alchemists in [[Faer√ªn]].

In [[1478 DR]], he had a vision that the [[Kelemvor|Kelemvoran]] monastery in [[Impiltur]] should move to [[Ormpetarr]]. He was able to convince the monks to travel to Ormpetarr and begin construction on a new monastery.

Gregor was able to develop an elixir that conferred partial immunity to the effects of the Spellplague. The [[Order of Blue Flame]] used the potion in their ritual to enlarge the [[Plaguewrought Land]]. Gregor was uneasy with the methods of the Order but he believed their goal was to contain areas of wild magic, so he cooperated with the Order's plans. After [[Tyrangal]] and [[Duvan]] disrupted the Order's ritual to move the Plaguewrought Land's border, Tyrangal imprisoned Gregor and convinced him to conduct research on her behalf.

==Description==
His hair was black and dusted with silver. He kept his beard neatly trimmed. His spellscar bleached his hair and skin around his left ear pale.
