Chymist '''Norffe''' was an [[alchemist]] and cultist of [[Bane]] who served the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Norffe was a [[human]] man who wore dark hooded Baneite robes.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Cult of Bane]] joined forces with the [[Cult of the Absolute]], led by the [[Chosen]] of Bane, Lord [[Enver Gortash]]. Chymist Norffe was a part of the Cult's operations that targeted the countless refugees that flooded Baldur's Gate. His branch of the Cult assembled donations and toys rigged with [[smokepowder]] explosives in the [[Felogyr's Fireworks]] shop's third floor. Presumably, Norffe perished during or shortly before the Cult attacked Baldur's Gate.
