'''Kya Mordrayn''' was a [[sorceress]] and [[archmage]] and the leader of a [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell operating in [[Myth Drannor]] in the late 1360s [[DR]]. She created a dracolich out of the dragon Pelendralaar. It was her vision to use the [[Pool of Radiance]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]] to corrupt the lands of [[Faer√ªn]], starting with [[Phlan]].

==Description==
Kya Mordrayn wore a red leather bodysuit that left much exposed with a great wing-like collar around her neck. She had a dragon talon in place of her right arm.

==Personality==
Kya Mordrayn was haughty and commanding. She had a dry wit when taunting her enemies. She was highly focused on her goal of domination. She could easily manipulate others with her charm and charisma, but she was vicious in her execution.

===Abilities===
Attacking with her dragon claw could cause paralysis, but she could also strike with such force that it broke bones.

==History==
Mordrayn once made a pact with [[fiend]]s, the nature of which is unknown.

Mordrayn bargained with the dragon [[Pelendralaar]] and convinced him to become a [[dracolich]]. With the Dragon Cult, she conducted the rite to turn Pelendralaar into a dracolich. Together, they invaded the ruins of Myth Drannor. Once in [[Castle Cormanthor]], Kya approached [[the Protector]] and, via deceit and empty promises of reviving Myth Drannor to its former glory, they convinced him to hand over a [[sapphire]] connected to the [[Weave]]. She used the [[gem]] and its connection to the mysterious power of the ''[[Mythal]]'' to amplify her powers, also giving her telepathy. Using the gem, she conquered several bands of [[drow]] in the underground and enslaved them, drawing the ire of [[Nathlilik]]. She imprisoned some drow, stole their souls, and drained their blood to feed Pelendralaar. Once she was in control of the ''Mythal'' she revived the Pools of Radiance (which turned men into [[skeleton]] warriors) and spread the Pools into the lands above.

When the first pools started to appear, in the {{YearlinkName|1369}} with one in [[Phlan]], [[Elminster]] sent two sets of adventurers into Myth Drannor. The first group went directly into the underground and was nearly wiped out by the cult's sorcerers. [[Athan Stormlake]] was captured alive as was another fighter. The second group to investigate was brought in by a teleporting doorway. This group included [[Kestrel]], [[Corran D'Arcey]], Athan's wizard sister [[Ghleanna Stormlake]] and the fighter [[Durwyn]]. The group eventually uncovered how to destroy the sapphire gem, cutting the connection Kya had to the ''Mythal''.
