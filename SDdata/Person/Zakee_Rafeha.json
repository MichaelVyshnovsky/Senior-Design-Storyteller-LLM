        "mainbody": "Zakee Rafeha was a bartender and portly gentleman who managed the Zephir tavern in Amkethran in Calimshan around 1368 DR.\nZakee, whilst running the tavern, would often overhear stories told by the mercenaries of the monk, Balthazar. He would get scared by the awful tales they had to tell. He did not wish to know why these mercenaries were there, and was content just working in the tavern.\nHe may have informed Gorions Ward that Marlowe was a stranger to Amkethran and arrived only a few weeks ago, but that he had to remain as his daughter fell ill."
