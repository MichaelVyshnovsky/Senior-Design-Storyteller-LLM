        "mainbody": "'''Snarlclaw''' was a giant [[troll]] who was chief of a gang of trolls near [[Harvestshield Mountain]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "It was hard to motivate Snarlclaw or his gang without either a great deal of food or a great deal of coercion. In battle, Snarlclaw fought out of a desire not to lose rather than out of any drive to win. He was bad at keeping secrets.",
        "History": "Snarlclaw and his gang were in constant conflict with [[Grocknock]] and his [[ettin]]s over territory. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, both groups were forced to serve [[Mrolgyet's Legion]], and their members were branded with the Legion's symbol. On [[Mrolgyet]]'s orders to retrieve the [[Anvil of Dumathoin]], Snarlclaw's trolls were forced to dig a tunnel from Harvestshield Mountain into the [[Frostsilver Mines]] while Grocknock's ettins broke and extracted their teeth to force them to keep digging. Once inside the Mines, Snarlclaw encountered a group of [[adventurer]]s in the service of the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], [[Laeral Silverhand]]. He was badly battered in the fight, but managed to escape and recover."
