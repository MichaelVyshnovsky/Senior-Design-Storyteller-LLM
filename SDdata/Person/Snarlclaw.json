        "mainbody": "narlclaw was a giant troll who was chief of a gang of trolls near Harvestshield Mountain in the late 15 century DR.\nIt was hard to motivate Snarlclaw or his gang without either a great deal of food or a great deal of coercion. In battle, Snarlclaw fought out of a desire not to lose rather than out of any drive to win. He was bad at keeping secrets.\nSnarlclaw and his gang were in constant conflict with Grocknock and his ettins over territory. In the late 15 century DR, both groups were forced to serve Mrolgyets Legion, and their members were branded with the Legions symbol. On Mrolgyets orders to retrieve the Anvil of Dumathoin, Snarlclaws trolls were forced to dig a tunnel from Harvestshield Mountain into the Frostsilver Mines while Grocknocks ettins broke and extracted their teeth to force them to keep digging. Once inside the Mines, Snarlclaw encountered a group of adventurers in the service of the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Laeral Silverhand. He was badly battered in the fight, but managed to escape and recover."
