        "mainbody": "Tasha was a monk at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose.\nTasha was a thief in her youth, but in time she redeemed herself, becoming a monk at the monastery.\nIn 1491 DR, Tasha was one of the monks kidnapped by cultists of the Cult of the Howling Hatred, who planned to use them in a plot to access an elemental node. At the entrance room to the node complex under the monastery, she met an adventuring party hired by Grandmaster Perrywinkle Shin to find the missing monks. Tasha tested the adventurers, posing as a member of the Cult of the Black Earth, in order to see if they could be trusted to save her fellows. If they answered correctly, she disappeared."
