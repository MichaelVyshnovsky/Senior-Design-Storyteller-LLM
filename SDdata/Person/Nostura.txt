'''Nostura''' was a [[warlock]] and a member of the [[Cloaked Ascendancy]] of [[Neverwinter]] that took over the [[Neverwinter/Chasm|Chasm]] region of the city during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
She was a warlock who made a pact with a powerful [[archfey]].

==Activities==
As of the late 14{{th}} century, Nostura was a member of the [[Many-Starred Cloak]] in Neverwinter. 

==History==
When the [[Spellplague]] hit the Realms in the {{yearlinkName|1384}}, Nostura was pulled into the [[Far Realm]] along with many of her fellow wizards. The wizard [[Gyrion]] took charge of the situation and tried to helped them survive until they could escape. The energies of the Far Realm changed Nostura, warping her body.

Some time after the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Nostura and three other wizards, Gyrion, [[Kabal]], and [[Lukan]], managed to escape the Far Realm and return to Neverwinter. At some point thereafter, she broke her pact with the archfey and instead began drawing power from the [[hag]] named Auntie [[Margath Bale-eye]].

Gyrion was angered by what he saw as the illegitimate rule of [[Dagult Neverember]], and believed that as the last survivors of the Many-Starred Cloak it was their duty to rule Neverwinter. The four formed the Cloaked Ascendancy, and Gyrion used a replica of the ''[[Crown of Neverwinter]]'' to make himself appear as though he was the true heir of [[Nasher Alagondar]]. When Lord Neverember descended into the Neverwinter vaults with the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to verify that the real crown was safe, Nostura sent her minions to harry them before charming Lord Neverember himself and attempting to make him give her the crown. When the heroes resisted her spell, she complimented them on their skill in battle and withdrew, releasing Lord Neverember from her control and leaving a "peace offering" in the form of a [[mimic]] disguised as a treasure chest.

Eventually [[Kavatos Stormeye]] found a means to bypass her defenses and enter her [[demiplane]] within the [[Feywild]]. Using magical stags provided by the [[Iliyanbruen]] of [[New Sharandar]], the heroes rode through the treacherous forest surrounding her keep and confronted her within, but she fled and swore to return. She regrouped with Gyrion and Kabal at Lukan's hidden ritual site just outside the city, bringing with her a massive army of [[fey]] creatures. When the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge arrived to stop them, Gyrion sent her and Kabal away in order to finish the ritual himself. The pair sought refuge within the Spellplague Caverns at the bottom of the [[Chasm]], but the heroes followed and slew them for good.
