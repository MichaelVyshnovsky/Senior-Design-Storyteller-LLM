'''Edrae "the Doomed Babe"''' was the 30th [[Obarskyr]] monarch and officially a king of [[Cormyr]], but he was only an infant, and he did not live to see his fourth birthday. He was killed by his own mother as an act of mercy to end the suffering caused by his evil aunt [[Gorauna Obarskyr|Gorauna's]] [[Purplethroat Plague]].
