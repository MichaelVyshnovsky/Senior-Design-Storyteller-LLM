'''Jhevven Dree''' was the author of one of the most important philosophical books about the exploration of the multiverse. He was from the island of [[Tharsult]].

==Activities==
Dree was most famous for his popular work ''[[The Great Realms in the Stars]]'', in which he wrote about the potential of other [[planes of existence]] and postulated that the divinity of the gods and goddesses was tied to the essence of these planes.

The vague descriptions of some of these "hypothetical" other worlds led many to suspect that Dree had actually traveled to some of them.

==History==
Dree wrote ''The Great Realms in the Stars'' in {{Yearlink|1332}}. An elderly Dree was still alive as late as the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, and folk of that time—especially merchants, [[adventurer]]s, and sages—eagerly hoped that he was working on another book.
