        "mainbody": "King '''Strohm III''' was a king of [[Tethyr]].",
        "Description": "Strohm III was rumored to have been a giant. In any case, he was peerless as a warrior, and many tales were told of his great prowess in combat.",
        "Relationships": "Strohm III was the great-great-great-grandson of [[Strohm II]], who was a [[half-elf]] and thus long-lived, which was why Strohm III succeeded his great-great-great-grandfather as king of Tethyr instead of his own father.\n\nStrohm III had at least three sons.",
        "History": "Strohm III was born in the [[715 DR|Year of the Hungry Jaws, 715 DR]]. He was crowned king at the age of twenty years in the [[735 DR|Year of the Prophet's Child, 735 DR]].\n\nStrohm III fought many wars during his reign as king,\n\nUpon Strohm's death in [[769 DR]], his third son and a warrior like his father, [[Strohm IV]], became king in his stead.\n\n[[Tomb of Strohm III|His tomb]] was located in the [[Windspear Hills]].",
        "Rumors and Legends": "A tale was often told of how Strohm and his general alone slew 5,000 drow during a battle that lasted two full days. This battle took place on a hill known as [[Argentor]] in the eastern [[Marching Mountains]] during a [[Wikipedia:en:Solar eclipse|solar eclipse]]."
