'''Forier''' was a [[Turmishan]] [[ranger]] who was instrumental in the [[blue dragon]] [[Anaglathos]]' becoming a ruler of the nation in [[1242 DR]].

==History==
In the late 1230s DR, the ruler of Turmish, Lord [[Sjorn Sendreth]] sought to re-fill the realm's treasure after the disastrous [[Turmish War of 1220]] against the [[dwarves]] of [[Ironfang Deep|Ironfang]]. The lord sponsored treasure-hunting adventuring parties sent into the [[Orsraun Mountains]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1242}}, the [[Company of the Sabred Tooth]], guided by ranger Forier, stumbled across the horde of the blue dragon Anaglathos. The cunning wyrm saw it as an opportunity and killed the ranger's [[wolf]] companion [[Emerald (wolf)|Emerald]], taking its place. Along with Forier and the [[adventurer]]s, Anaglathos marched across Turmish and presented the stolen dragon hoard to Sjorn. This audience ended abruptly as the blue dragon revealed himself and slaughtered Lord Sendreth, and presumably, Forier, taking over the mantle of the Lord of Turmish.
