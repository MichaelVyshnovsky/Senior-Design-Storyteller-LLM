Vanguard Shellidar was a human crusader of Torm and one of the three leaders of the Janessar, an organization that opposed slavery and protected travelers from bandits in Calimshan, in the 14 century DR.
Despite his great age, he still had a bear-like figure, being tall and looming.
Shellidar hailed from the town of Easting in the Western Heartlands, but came to Calimshan some time around 1330 DR and never left, which proved his commitment to the cause of the Janessar.
By 1370 DR, being too old to fight or ride, Shellidar instead helped lead the Janessar as a Speaker from the Tower of the Three in the Khanall enclave in the Marching Mountains. He also focused on training the Janessar in weaponsmithing and combat.
