Vanguard '''Shellidar''' was a [[human]] [[crusader]] of [[Torm]] and one of the three leaders of the [[Janessar]], an organization that opposed [[slavery]] and protected travelers from bandits in [[Calimshan]], in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Despite his great age, he still had a bear-like figure, being tall and looming.

==History==
Shellidar hailed from the town of [[Easting (town)|Easting]] in the [[Western Heartlands]], but came to Calimshan some time around [[1330 DR]] and never left, which proved his commitment to the cause of the Janessar.

==Activities==
By [[1370 DR]], being too old to fight or ride, Shellidar instead helped lead the Janessar as a Speaker from the Tower of the Three in the [[Khanall]] enclave in the [[Marching Mountains]]. He also focused on training the Janessar in weaponsmithing and combat.
