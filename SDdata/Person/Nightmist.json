        "mainbody": "'''Nightmist''' was a [[Sharran]] [[Dark Justiciar]] Crusader in the hidden [[Cloister of Sombre Embrace]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Nightmist was a [[high elven]] woman with a light skin tone and blue eyes. Her features were hidden by a Dark Justiciar's [[helmet]] and a set of highly decorated [[plate mail]]. She was armed with a [[greatsword]].",
        "Abilities": "Like other Sharran Justiciars, Nightmist was a formidable foe whose attacks were reinforced with [[necrotic]] magics. She could assume an umbral form when enveloped in darkness and launched devastating mental attacks, overwhelming her opponents with grief.",
        "Relationships": "Fellow Dark Justiciar [[Owltalon]] shared a close relationship of some sort with Nightmist, or \"her little Nightmist,\" as the other woman referred to herself in their letter exchange. Nightmist eagerly reported to Owltalon that her mistress approved Nightmist's status as a Certified Venom Specialist and allowed her to study sudden esophageal collapse.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Nightmist served the Mother Superior [[Viconia DeVir]] in the underground Cloister of Sombre Embrace as one of her cultists underneath the [[House of Grief]]. Nightmist, along with the entirety of the cloister, might have confronted a rogue member named [[Shadowheart]], were she to turn away from Shar. Nightmist could have perished in the struggle. By other accounts, Nightmist and the rest of the cloister helped defend the city of Baldur's Gate from the army of the [[Absolute]], were Shadowheart to remain loyal to her evil deity, or if Shadowheart was betrayed and surrendered to the Mother Superior for punishment."
