        "Description": "By the tradition of his house, Hoshtar wore a red veil over his face.",
        "Personality": "Hoshtar could be influenced by those who showed knowledge about arcane matters or fed his ego. He thumped his chest and clapped an employee on the shoulder when he was pleased.",
        "History": "Hoshtar was his family's representative for an alliance with [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]] and [[Bregan D'aerthe]] in handling a party of [[adventurer]]s. This was a task in which he had spent much effort himself. It was written to [[Faelas Xorlarrin]], a master of [[Sorcere]], and its content was about how the Goddess's current plan supported the idea of wizards joining the [[Ruling Council (Menzoberranzan)|Ruling Council]].\n\nAfter the adventurers returned from their first mission, Hoshtar was invited to meet with members of the [[Council of Spiders]] by his cousin, [[Raelaryn Xorlarrin]]. At the meeting, a [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] assassin killed Raelaryn and captured Hoshtar. The alliance's hired team managed to rescue him. Regardless of the alliance's decision on how to deal with the civil war, it was unanimous in sending the adventurers to eliminate [[Valan Jaelre|the leader of the assassins]]."
