'''Gannis''' was a [[human]] conman active throughout the taverns of the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He adopted different surnames and backstories in each city to which he traveled.

==History==
In [[Baldur's Gate]], Gannis posed as a merchant named '''Gannis Tath''' seeking to raise funds for an expedition to [[Chult]]. He sold false [[gemstone]]s to patrons at the [[Low Lantern]], and claimed to introduce his marks to a Chultan tradition that bound them in an unbreakable trust. By the time that he was outed as an imposter by [[Artus Cimber]], he had already fled Baldur's Gate. A vengeful [[kenku]] [[assassin]] soon pursued him.

In [[Waterdeep]], he adopted the identity of '''Gannis Frostmantle''' and claimed to be an emissary of the [[Tuigan]] working to undermine [[demon]]ic forces. He used this story to woo [[Iokaste Daliano]], the proprietor of the [[Pink Flumph]], and conned her out of a great deal of [[coin]]. She ultimately realized that he was lying when he failed to recognize traditional foods of the [[Endless Wastes]], and she and her companion [[Wishes]] drove him out of town using [[illusion]]s to make him believe that the [[gods]] of the Tuigan were angry with him. He fled from there to [[Luskan]].

In Luskan, he claimed to be '''Gannis Redthumb''', a fugitive nobleman from [[Damara]] fleeing from persecution. He settled in at [[One-Eyed Jax]] and convinced drunk patrons to buy the seeds of [[peach]]es and [[strawberries]] that he claimed to be [[magic]]ally hardy and resistant to winter snow. However, it was here that the kenku assassin from Baldur's Gate caught up to him, and he wound up dead in the mouth of the [[River Mirar]].
