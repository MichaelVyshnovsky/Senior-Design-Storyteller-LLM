        "History": "When a horde of [[orc]]s assaulted Dubrinlar, the eastern gate through the double walls of Khôltar, legend has it that Elgrol held the gate single-handedly for hours before dying of his many wounds. A statue in his likeness was erected inside the guardhouse that served  Dubrinlar, and the building was named [[Darrusktraal]] after him.\n\nThe gates of Khôltar were constructed during the tenure of Shieldlord [[Angloam Dubrin]] ([[577 DR|Year of the Alabaster Mounds, 577 DR]], to the [[619 DR|Year of Orcsfall, 619 DR]]) so Dubrinlar (named after Angloam) was also completed during this period;{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|85-86}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 65: Khôltar, Part 16, A Brief History of Khôltar, Part 3}} therefore, the heroic deeds of Elgrol Darrusk took place sometime after that date."
