'''Larissa Neathal''' was a [[Courtesan (prostitute)|courtesan]] and one of the [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lord of Waterdeep]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Larissa had red hair. However, she was very skilled in using cosmetics and magic to alter her appearance.

By some unknown means, Larissa was protected from all manner of [[poison]]s and [[drug]]s that made people fall asleep.

==Personality==
In the public sphere, Larissa was superficial and empty-headed. However, she used that persona as a front to allow her to gain information from the many public officials she lured into her hands.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, Larissa was beaten and badly wounded by agents of the [[Knights of the Shield]] working for [[Iriador Wintermist]]. She was found by [[Mirt]] in her home and slowly nursed back to health.

==Residence==
Larissa lived in a house on [[Mulgomir's Way]] in the [[Castle Ward]],

==Possessions==
Larissa always wore a distinctive ''[[periapt of proof against poison]]'' necklace that was shaped like a golden phoenix rising from a cluster of rubies.

==Relationships==
Larissa was one of the "Like-Minded Lords" who served as of [[1364 DR]]; along with [[Mirt]], [[Khelben]], [[Durnan]], [[Nymara Scheiron|Kitten]], and [[Brian]]. The group frequently met up with one another to enjoy each others' company. Durnan was her closest friend and she often turned to him for emotional support.
