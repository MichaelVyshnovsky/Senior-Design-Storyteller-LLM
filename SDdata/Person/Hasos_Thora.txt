Hasos Thora was the Baron of Soolabax in 1479 DR.
Hasos was tall, muscular and long-nosed.
In 1479 DR, due to the war against Threskel, Hasos had to cooperate with Aoth Fezim and the Brotherhood of the Griffon in the war effort. He did so, but grudgingly.
During the siege of Soolabax, he fought alongside Gaedynn Ulraes and helped to defeat the threskelian army.
