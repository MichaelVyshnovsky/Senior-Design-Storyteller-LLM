        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1491}},{{Phandelver-time}} Aida was kidnapped by [[psionic]] [[goblin]]s and herded with several other victims and more goblins through an underground tunnel connected to a sinkhole beneath the [[Sleeping Giant]]. Aida, her sister, and her sister's fianc√©, [[Oskar Ninebough]], were at the rear of the group because Oskar had an old leg injury that slowed him down. The other townspeople and goblins went ahead. They were then attacked by [[grell]]s that killed several goblins. The grells grabbed the goblin corpses as well as Aida, Cathlette, and Oskar, and deposited them in a small cave along the passage."
