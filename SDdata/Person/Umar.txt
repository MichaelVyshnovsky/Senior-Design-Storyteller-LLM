Umar, also called Umar the Patrician, was the governor and commander of the military forces  of Port Ghaast in 1359 DR.
Umar was a competent and intelligent commander. He was easily frustrated by his troops discipline or lack thereof.
Even though Umar knew that King Tharmakkas IV was a fool, he refused several treasonous invitations from prominent citizens of Murghôm. However, he did not report their activity to the king either.
