        "mainbody": "Bigby was a legendary otherworldly wizard and hands-on spell inventor. He was known by several inhabitants of the Realms, and a handful of his spells were used all over.\nBigby was not born on Toril, but instead on Oerth. However, it is believed that he had travelled to Toril.\nThe archmage invented many handy spells, several of which were used in the Realms. Some of these spells were Bigbys forceful hand, Bigbys interposing hand, Bigbys clenched fist, Bigbys crushing hand, and Bigbys grasping hand.\nOver the course of his life Bigby had possessed a +2 dagger, a djinni bottle, a +3 ring of protection, a ring of X-ray vision, a ring of mind shielding, a staff of power +3, a wand of fire, a wand of frost, a wand of negation, a pair of bracers of defense, a pair of winged boots, and a pair of boots of striding and springing. \nBigby also possessed a spellbook that he authored, named Manual Powers Beyond Life, which in addition to all of his major spells included burning hands.\nBigby was an associate of Mordenkainen and a member of the Circle of Eight. However, Bigby and Otiluke were killed by the traitorous wizard, Rary.\nTenser wore the enchanted item called the Hood of the Weave during the ceremony of being inducted into the Circle of Eight on the world of Oerth. The hood would eventually find its way to Toril, but following the ceremony, during the celebration, the fellow members of the Circle, Otiluke and Bigby pranked Tenser. However, thanks to the hood, they found their vodka glasses ensorcelled with a spell that transformed their earlobes into sassy pixies.\nIn 1358 DR, Midnight remembered a spell she once saw be performed. Because she had gained much of Mystras power, Midnight immediately recognized that Bigby had invented this spell many centuries ago.\nIn 1364 DR, Robillard and Harkle Harpell engaged in a spellcasting competition. After Robillard cast a spell, Harkle asked if Robillard knew of Bigby, who of course recognised him as one of the most magnificent wizards of all time, even on other worlds. Harkle, however, claimed that he had improved on one of Bigbys spells by inventing a new version himself Bigbys snapping digits.\nSometime before the , Bigby fashioned an enchanted ring of blinking for his trusted dog â€“ Bigboy. The hound used the rings magic to catch cats and harass postmen.\nthumb|Bigbys time as a Human is ended at the hands of a Frost giant\nWhile travelling with Mordenkainen, Bigby would be killed by a Frost giant. Mordenkainen was unable to find a Cleric to revive him, and instead had a Druid use Reincarnate to resurrect him as a Gnome.  \nSome time after that, Bigby would free an enslaved woman from a Hill giants dungeon, and in gratitude she taught him the basics of rune-carving. He later discovered that woman was the goddess Diancastra in disguise when they met again teaming up to take down a cult of the Elemental Evil being led by a Cloud giant. The two of them would go on to have many adventures in each others company, many of which revolved around preventing giants from being corrupted by evil deities.\nthumb|Bigby the Great in his latter years.\nIt was rumored that Khelben Arunsun had met Bigby, though the meeting went sour. Khelben told his apprentice, Illistar, that Bigby relied on over-used \"gimmicks\". To prove his point, the Blackstaff developed a spell, Khelbens warding whip, in order to counter many of Bigbys spells."
