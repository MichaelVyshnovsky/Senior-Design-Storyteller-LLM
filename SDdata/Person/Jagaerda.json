        "mainbody": "'''Jagaerda''' was the princess of [[Gundarlun]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Jagaerda was a strong, charismatic, and competent [[fighter]].",
        "Possessions": "The princess fought with a set of enchanted [[chainmail]] and a [[battleaxe]].",
        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], Jagaerda went missing from her father's palace. It turned out that she had been kidnapped by pirates, who took her to a nearby hideout on the isle. However, the fighter managed to dispatch her kidnappers, and was then found by the [[Heroes of Ascore]]. She said that they could be her honor guard, and escorted her back to the palace. Jagaerda offered to join the party and accompanied them until they returned to the mainland. She helped the Heroes to secure the Statuette of the West on the Purple Rocks.\n\nLater that year, many merchant ships heading to [[Gundarlun]] had been attacked by pirates, far more than normal. Against her father's wishes, she sailed to [[Mintarn]] to find out what was going on. Here, she learned of the joint plot of [[evil]] organizations to disguise themselves as soldiers from [[Waterdeep]] and cause commotion within the [[Lords' Alliance]]. She again asked to join the cause of the Heroes of Ascore and find hard evidence of the evil scheme, only parting with them once they left the isles.\n\nJagaerda later met with the heroes in [[Luskan]], where she told them that [[Ruathym]] would apparently be backing Luskan in their scheme to blockade Waterdeep. She told them of Ruathym's Captain [[Redleg]], who led the powerful armada. Jagaerda hinted that he was under magic control, as Ruathym would never ally with their ancient enemies. The princess then suggested that they head to Ruathym to find out what was going on, and when they accepted she lent them her ship, though she stayed behind in Luskan and was captured thereafter by Luskan guards.\n\nThe heroes whom liberated [[Redleg]] had ferried from Ruathym to Luskan, discovered and freed her. Jagaerda rejoined the heroes."
