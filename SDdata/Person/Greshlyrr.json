        "mainbody": "'''Greshlyrr''' was a [[kobold]] chief of the [[Scything Claw]] tribe in [[Turmish]] in [[1358 DR]].",
        "History": "Greshlyrr gained fame among his tribe from an episode in his past: in an abandoned den he found  a masterfully crafted figurine of the kobold god [[Kurtulmak]], and only a second after he had exited the den with his prize the den collapsed in an earthquake. This was seen by the tribe as a sign of Kurtulmak's blessing to Greshlyrr.\n\nAround [[1348 DR]], he had become the Scything Claw chief, elevating his tribe to a higher level of civilization. At the same time, he started a war with the nearby [[gnome]] settlement of [[Gildenglade]]. After many years, it ended with a truce.\n\nIn 1358 DR, while he and his warriors were away attacking a band of [[goblin]]s, an adventuring party raided the home of the Scything Claw tribe.",
        "Personality": "Greshlyrr was an unusually intelligent and cunning kobold. He was cruel and took joy from others' suffering.",
        "Possessions": "Greshlyrr normally fought with an axe or keenly sharpened scimitar. His prized possession, however, was a sturdy wood and wicker shield emblazoned with a bloody talon glyph that he called [[Blade Turner]]."
