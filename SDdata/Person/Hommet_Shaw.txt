Hommet Shaw was a human necromancer from Longsaddle.
Hommet was a young, talented, and eager necromancer, but he was not a very detail-oriented person. Despite the reputation of most necromancers, he sought a mentor who wasnt evil or insane.
Hommet was from the eccentric Harpell family.
He was born to a young pair of farmers in a small village near Longsaddle. He was a scrawny child, and no use around the farm. As such, his parents sent him off to live with his Uncle Kipper Harpell. He managed to get exiled for some reason.
At some point before 1487 DR, he travelled to Luskan, where he at various times got mugged, kidnapped and blackmailed.
He trained under the mage Maferil, but was sento to Neverwinter sometime before the wizards death around 1487 DR. He returned to Luskan after hearing of Maferils murder.n-Space (October 2015).
