'''Azmaer Dhuurniv''' was the last [[drow]] marshal of the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]] in [[Shadowdale]] in the early 10{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Azmaer oversaw the last retreat of the drow in the face of a [[human]] uprising in the {{YearlinkName|906}}, and held the citadel against a year-long siege.

Though thought dead or exiled or hiding for his failure, the truth is that Azmaer never truly left his post but rather mummified himself in spidersilk and waited in [[undeath]] as a [[mummy]] to guard the [[Fane of Lolth (Shadowdale)|Fane of Lolth]] for the return of the drow.
