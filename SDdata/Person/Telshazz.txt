'''Telshazz''' was a [[demon]] in the [[balor]] [[Errtu|Errtu's]] service.

==Personality==
The small demon was obedient and very submissive to its masters.
==History==
Errtu appointed Telshazz with the task of retrieving the [[Crenshinibon]] artifact. However, the relic was found by [[Al Dimeneira]], but its power overwhelmed that of the angelic being, burning its hands. Al Dimeneira managed to throw Crenshinibon across the planes of existence, putting it far away from Errtu's grasp. When Telshazz reported all this to its master, Errtu tore its throat out in rage.
