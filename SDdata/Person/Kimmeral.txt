==Description==
Kimmeral wore Absolutist acolyte's padded armor and a hood that covered his blush-skinned face and handsome features. He was armed with a [[light crossbow]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Kimmeral was among those who joined the new religion that sprang in the [[Western Heartlands]]. He was stationed within the Moonrise Towers – the fortress controlled by the Absolute's warlord – General [[Ketheric Thorm]]. Kimmeral shared his quarters with [[Mig]], a cultist [[ogre]]ss who was convinced she was hearing sounds of meat moving in the Towers' walls. Kimmeral looked down on the dimwitted ogre and lamented having to share quarters with her. According to some, Kimmeral may had been slain during the [[True Soul]] heroes and [[Harper]] attack on the Moonrise Towers that ended Ketheric Thorm's [[undead]] existence.
