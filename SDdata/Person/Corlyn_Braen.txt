Corlyn "Corl" Braen was the mayor of Crimmor in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Corlyn was known to be fair-minded and well-meaning, wanting the best for the city and its inhabitants.
The Mayor was backed by several influential friends and family members
* His cousins were Lamia Crytrapper, head of the Crytrapper family, and Chynna Crytrapper, the local priestess of Lliira.
* His best friend, Mikaal Krimmevol, head of the Krimmevol family. Corlyn was amongst the few who know of Mikaals identity as a Herald of Faer√ªn.
Corlyns ruling was opposed by Lady Zharnn Ophal, head of the Ophal family, who wanted to replace him by her own candidate.
