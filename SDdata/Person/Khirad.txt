'''Khirad''', also known as the '''Star of Secrets''', was a star-like [[Elder Evil]] from the [[Far Realm]] who had taken a place among stars of [[Realmspace]]. Unlike normal stars, Khirad didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.

== Description ==
Khirad was a blue star.

==History==
Khirad, like the other Far Realm-infested stars of Realmspace, was somehow related to the [[Eldest]].

Wherever an apocalypse of some sort happened in Realmspace, Khirad was the most brilliant star in the sky.{{Cite dragon/366/Wish Upon a Star|18}}

Khirad was one of the stars the [[warlock]] [[Japheth Donard]] sought out in [[1396 DR]], after having lost his pact with the [[archfey]] [[Neifion]].

Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a vestige of Khirad's power had found its way into the domain of [[Demiplane of Dread#Barovia|Barovia]] in the [[Shadowfell]], where it offered pacts with creatures who approached it. To those few Khirad bestowed the gift of ''[[divination]]'', giving them the ability to use the ''[[Scrying (spell)|scrying]]'' spell up to three times. Even non-[[warlock]]s could be granted this ability from the star. Those who were granted the gifts of Khirad had their voices turned into whispers, and their smiles seemed cruel and evil to onlookers.
