On the night of [[Tarsakh 25]], he was on guard duty at the [[Fortress of the Old Man]] together with two others. He spotted a faint green glow; meeting up with [[Galban]] and [[Bennig]], they pursued the light into the [[Gallery of Stone Faces]], where Jerumillis was slain without ever seeing his attacker, [[Berun]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||29}}"
