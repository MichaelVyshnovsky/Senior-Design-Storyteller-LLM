        "mainbody": "'''Torynnar Rhaevaern''' was a [[sun elf]] [[baelnorn]] [[wizard]] and [[archmage]] and one of the founders of the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]].",
        "History": "By [[1374 DR]], he was the last surviving member of the original founders and was still amongst its ranks, as one of its leaders, the [[Vel'Nikeryma]]. They asked for his wisdom on all important matters.\n\nAt the time, he suspected that the organization was suffering from an outside influence, particularly in the [[Cormanthor]] cells. He had last felt an influence of this power during the [[Weeping War|fall of Myth Drannor]] of [[711 DR]] to [[714 DR]]. However, he was unsure of the source and was reluctant to tell the full council about it until he was.",
        "Home": "He laired in an ancient crypt in the heart of the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]], guarded by all manner of traps and magical defenses as well as [[Claugxinaurak]], the venerable [[green dragon]] who served as his steed."
