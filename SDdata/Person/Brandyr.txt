'''Brandyr''' was one of the [[fire giant]] lieutenants of Queen [[Hledh Hellspawn]], who ruled the city of [[Maerimydra]] in the [[Deep Wastes]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Brandyr was in charge of the [[Six-Fingered Courtyard]], where inhabitants paid homage to the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]] with four [[cambion]] assistants until an adventuring party hired by [[Solom Ned'razak]] to collect samples of fiendish fire giant bloods confronted and defeated her and her minions.
