Brandyr was one of the fire giant lieutenants of Queen Hledh Hellspawn, who ruled the city of Maerimydra in the Deep Wastes in the late 15 century DR.
Brandyr was in charge of the Six-Fingered Courtyard, where inhabitants paid homage to the demon lord Grazzt with four cambion assistants until an adventuring party hired by Solom Nedrazak to collect samples of fiendish fire giant bloods confronted and defeated her and her minions.
