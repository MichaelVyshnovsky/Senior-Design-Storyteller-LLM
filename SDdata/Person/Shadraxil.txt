'''Shadraxil''' was a [[shadow dragon]].{{Cite dungeon/155/Keep on the Shadowfell: Forgotten Realms Conversion|5}}

==History==
He was already a [[great wyrm]] when the nation of [[Cormyr]] was founded in the {{YearlinkName|26}} and had sired many other shadow dragons, including [[Shhuusshuru]]. He laired in the [[Thunder Peaks]] where his granddaughter [[Aurgloroasa]] presently resides.

As Cormyr expanded, it built several fortresses in the Thunder Peaks to guard its eastern border. In the {{YearlinkName|236}}, Shadraxil began attacking these keeps. In response, Cormyr sent the knight and dragonslayer [[Jerold Keegan]] and a contingent of men to slay him. Keegan's plan involved luring Shadraxil into an arcane trap that would seal him inside a magical prison in the [[Plane of Shadow]].{{Cite dungeon/155/Keep on the Shadowfell: Forgotten Realms Conversion|14}} by [[Tharyann Obarskyr|King Tharyann]]{{Cite dungeon/155/Keep on the Shadowfell: Forgotten Realms Conversion|15}} to slay a juvenile shadow dragon, bury it, and keep the affair secret. The fortresses were abandoned for fear of future reprisals from Shadraxil.

Over a thousand years later, Shadraxil had given up hope of escape but then in [[1385 DR]], [[Shar]] folded the Plane of Shadow into the [[Shadowfell]] and the [[Spellplague]] weakened his magical prison. Shadraxil petitioned Shar to help him escape in return for his service and she agreed.

She sent her agents to infiltrate the town of [[Winterhaven]] and after several years of excavations and preparation the cult of Shar was ready to free him but adventurers happened to stumble across the secret and closed the portal to Shadraxil's prison before he could manifest.
