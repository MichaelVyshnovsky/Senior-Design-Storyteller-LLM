        "mainbody": "atasuuri Shogoro was the shogun of Wa who unified the nation under his solitary rule.\nUnlike his descendant, Nagahide, Shogoros solution to problems was to use force.\nKazuo Tokuri was Shogoros nephew. He was famous for being the last prisoner incarcerated on the Isle of One Thousand Pines.\nIn Wa Year 1647 (1229 DR), the most powerful clan of Wa daimyos, the Makino clan, offered to form an alliance with clan Matasuuri. The alliance was agreed upon and signed, and Matasuuri Shogoro was selected as the general of the unified clan armies. As general, Shogoro began the process of unifying—by the power of his sword—the provinces.\nAfter fourteen years, in Wa Year 1661 (1243 DR), Matasuuri Shogoro secretly arranged for ninja to assassinate the leader of the Makino clan, Makino Mansaku, bringing full control of the daimyo to himself. He then began a campaign to take the capital of Wa, Iiso, in what was called the Summer March.\nUpon reaching the town of Tomo, Matasuuris northern army was met by an alliance of other daimyo from central Wa. His forces were pushed back and had to retreat within the town. The other daimyo laid siege to Tomo, leading to a stalemate that would last for about a year.\nIn the second summer, while still under siege, Matasuuri was able to send messages to the daimyo of the south and convince them to strike at the central daimyos holdings. This distracted and weakened the enemies, which allowed Matasuuri to gather reinforcements and break the siege. Having strengthened his position throughout the summer by persuading further daimyo to gather under his leadership as the nations shogun, at the turn of the year, he surprised his enemies by making a push for the capital in the middle of winter. All of Wa officially came under Matasuuri Shogoros command by early Wa Year 1663 (1245 DR).\nAfter taking control, Matasuuri moved the capital of Wa from Iiso to Uwaji. A collection of displayed samurai in Iiso attempted to start a coup, but they failed, resulting in a series of battles lasting six months, before at last all of the rebellious samurai were executed. Matasuuri then divided up the military forces of Iiso among other cities in Wa to prevent a repeat attempt at rebellion.\nIn the new capital, Shogoro commanded the daimyo of the six nearest provinces to reconstruct Uwaji Castle and its Palace of Imperial Prosperity to be his new fortress and home.\nEarlier in that same year, the Spirit of the Sun was said to have appeared to Shogoro, granting him three sacred gifts to reward him for his efforts at unifying the nation. These gifts were a sword, a pearl, and a mirror."
