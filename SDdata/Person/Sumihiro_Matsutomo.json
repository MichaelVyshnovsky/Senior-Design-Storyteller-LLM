        "Description": "He was ugly and was aged almost 40 in {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}.",
        "Personality": "Sumihiro had a sullen attitude and was very uncharismatic.",
        "Relations": "Sumihiro was the nephew of [[Benju Matsutomo]], the [[daimyo]] of [[Aru Province]], and one of the members of his court. He was viewed as a disgrace to the family.As [[Takako Shimizu]] is Benju's niece and is described as \"differentâ€¦ in almost every way\", it seems intended that Sumihiro and Takako are siblings or half-siblings.",
        "Abilities": "He was specialized in his [[katana]] and proficient in [[horse]]manship, calligraphy, and poetry. However, he was incredibly clumsy and poor samurai despite decades of quality training.",
        "Possessions": "Though he always had his katana and wakizashi with him, he was not known to have drawn them for years. He never donned armor.",
        "History": "In high summer of {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, Sumihiro, Benju, various local nobility, and a group of adventurers hired by the daimyo gathered one evening on the vantage point on the hill north of Aru, beside the [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]]. The evening was ruined when the temple's great [[brass]] bell broke as the hour was rung."
