'''Quayle Moss''' was a young lad that came from a farming family, who made their way by farming [[peat]] in the [[Twilight Marsh]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|11}}

==Relationships==
Quayle's parents were named [[Millivent Moss|Millivent]] and [[Haldred Moss]]. He had four siblings, a brother [[Volland Moss|Volland]], two sisters [[Alleena Moss|Alleena]] and [[Kithian Moss|Kithian]], along with the baby named [[Bo Moss|Bo]].

==History==
During the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} the Moss family farm was assailed by a band of [[goblin]]s. During the attack it appeared if Quayle, most of his siblings, and their father were taken captive by the raiders. Fortunately for them all, Quayle's mother Millivent managed to escape with baby Bo and sought help nearby.
