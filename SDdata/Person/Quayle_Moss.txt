Quayle Moss was a young lad that came from a farming family, who made their way by farming peat in the Twilight Marsh during the late 15 century DR.
Quayles parents were named Millivent and Haldred Moss. He had four siblings, a brother Volland, two sisters Alleena and Kithian, along with the baby named Bo.
During the 1480s DR, the Moss family farm was assailed by a band of goblins. During the attack it appeared if Quayle, most of his siblings, and their father were taken captive by the raiders. Fortunately for them all, Quayles mother Millivent managed to escape with baby Bo and sought help nearby.
