'''Nyo-ko''' was the third wife of [[Funada Mitsuhide]], daimyo of [[Nakamaru]] around [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Nyo-ko born as daughter of a daimyo and her parents had gone to great trouble to teach her refined graces. In 1357 the shogun [[Matasuuri Nagahide]] planned her marriage with Funada Mitsuhide of far [[Nakamaru]] to solidify the relations between the shogunâ€™s extended family and Nyo-ko's father. Nyo-ko however had become the target of an [[ikiryo]].

==Personality==
Nyo-ko was a demure and delicate girl, totally capturing the heart of her husband, Lord Mitsuhide, for the moment. She was skilled in singing and poetry.
