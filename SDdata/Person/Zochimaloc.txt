'''Zochimaloc''' was the ruler of [[Tulom-Itzi]] in [[1361 DR]].

==Personality==
He was very wise and knew much concerning the coming of the [[Golden Legion]] in [[Maztica]], but was very enigmatic in speaking about it.

==History==
He ordered the kidnapping of [[Gultec]], a young [[Jaguar Knights|Jaguar Knight]] from [[Payit]], and transported him to his city. There, Zochimaloc tutored Gultec, who, thanks to this training, learned to use all of his hidden powers. Just before the [[Night of Wailing]], he encouraged Gultec to go to [[Nexal]].

Zochimaloc died destroying the [[Darien]]'s army of [[giant ant]]s.
