'''Rasid Nadepa'an''' was the crown prince of the kingdom of [[Bawa]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Rasid did not truly care about matters of state. His true ambition was to become the best [[kensai]] of Bawa. For this, he often went to hunt in the wilderness. During those travels, he killed many monsters and forged good relationships with many [[Bawani]] tribes.
