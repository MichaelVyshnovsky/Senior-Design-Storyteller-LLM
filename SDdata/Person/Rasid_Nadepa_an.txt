Rasid Nadepaan was the crown prince of the kingdom of Bawa in 1357 DR.
Rasid did not truly care about matters of state. His true ambition was to become the best kensai of Bawa. For this, he often went to hunt in the wilderness. During those travels, he killed many monsters and forged good relationships with many Bawani tribes.
