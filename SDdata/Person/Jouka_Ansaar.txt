Jouka Ansaar was a wainwright from the hamlet of Gillians Hill who worked for the towns farm goods distributor, Sejellus Krimp, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Jouka Ansaar was a muscular and stoic fellow who worked hard and diligently.
By 1372 DR, Jouka Ansaar was a busy and well-paid wainwright, working day and night preparing Sejellus Krimps trade wagons, patching up passing caravans, and building new wagons out of old parts. He was deeply appreciated by all of his clients and they gladly paid him highly for his hard work.
With Gillians Hill often being raided by the lizardfolk of the Lizard Marsh, Joukas workshop was often affected as these wild humanoids grabbed anything to affixed to place and things that even remotely resembled weapons. During one of lizardfolk raids, Jouka Ansaars family "heirloom" of sorts, a silver-plated awl, was snatched and carried away. The wainwright was not a daring fighter, so he asked the Hero of Daggerford to retrieve the item in case they were heading into the Marsh.
