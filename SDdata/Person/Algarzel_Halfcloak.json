        "mainbody": "Algarzel Halfcloak was a mage in the early-to-midâ€“14 century DR.\nAlgarzel Halfcloak fought Kluennh Tzarr in a spell-battle around .This is eleven years before . He avoided a fireball that struck a ferry in a nearby river, killing everyone in it. The only survivor from the ferry was Narm Tamaraith, who was hurled into the water by his father moments before the explosion. Algarzel ultimately was defeated in that spell-battle.\nThough he was never seen again after the battle, there were reports he might have not perished, but fled elsewhere, perhaps to another plane."
