He avoided a [[fireball]] that struck a ferry in a nearby river, killing everyone in it. The only survivor from the ferry was [[Narm Tamaraith]], who was hurled into the water by his father moments before the explosion. Algarzel ultimately was defeated in that spell-battle.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Though he was never seen again after the battle, there were reports he might have not perished, but fled elsewhere, perhaps to another plane."
