        "Activities": "She worked as the junior waitress and kitchen maid, though she would rather be known as a barmaid, and she sometimes worked the bar when the owner [[Durnan]] was out. She also made [[cheese]]s.",
        "History": "Luranla was an orphan from the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of Waterdeep, who lived on the streets until Durnan hired her.\n\nShe was working at the Yawning Portal on the night of the [[Revel of Storms]] in the {{YearlinkName|1339}}, when a patron, [[Yelver Toraunt]], was murdered and the killer escaped. When a sailor got upset at hearing how Durnan disposed of bodies in the inn—by dropping them down a chute to be noisily devoured by a monster—Durnan quelled the man and Luranla served him a tankard of [[Black Sail]] and a complimentary seed-spiced [[cheese]], mollifying him with her flirtatious charm. Durnan left her in charge of the bar when he departed with [[Mirt]] to investigate Yelver's death. Later, after meeting not one but two [[dragon]]s in human form and learning of many more in the City of Splendors, Durnan and Mirt joked that Luranla too might be a dragon in disguise and Durnan feared to ask her.\n\nShe was still working at the Yawning Portal as of [[Eleint 30]] in the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, when [[Halaster's Call]] drew many [[adventurer]]s to the Yawning Portal seeking access to [[Undermountain]].<ref>",

        "Description": "Luranla had a beautiful full figure with distinctive black eyebrows and a great long mane of bright blue-black hair. Extensive dark [[tattoo]]s covered her body, shoulders, and sides, so tangled that the distracted and confused the eye. Her voice was deep, described as smoky and husky. She commonly worked in only baggy [[breeches]], [[boots]], and an [[apron]] that was full-fronted but sleeveless so as to show off her tattoos. Sometimes she forwent the apron to show off rather more than her tattoos."
