'''Gaylyn''' was the youngest daughter of the sage [[Dimswart]] of [[Suzail]], who married a squire from the [[Wyvernspur family]] of [[Immersea]] in [[1357 DR]].
{{quote|''Nothing holding that girl up but the stays in her bodice, and nothing keeping her moving but nervous energy, Alias thought. The bride, Gaylyn, had greeted everyone, even taken a moment to thank Alias for all her help. It was doubtful she knew exactly what Alias had done, since she'd greeted many people with the same platitude, but she seemed in earnest. She'd go far in court, Alias decided, even without help from her new in-laws.''}}

==Description==
Gaylyn was a beautiful and sophisticated young lady. She had golden hair that lit up the room, and a pink, almost glowing skin akin to a wild rose. She wore remarkable jewelry and fashionable gowns appropriate for a young noblewoman.

==Personality==
Like a true noble, Gaylyn knew etiquette, and could easily navigate social and court events. She was happy, upbeat, and earnest.

==Relationships==
Gaylyn got along with everyone, her family, and the Wyvernspurs. [[Giogioni Wyvernspur]] thought her to be the cheeriest, the most amusing woman he'd ever met. Gaylyn and cousin [[Julia Wyvernspur]] often played [[backgammon]] together, often accompanied by the family matriarch, Aunt [[Dorath Wyvernspur]]. 

Her husband [[Frefford Wyvernspur]] was head-over-heels in love with his young wife, always looking at her with solicitous devotion, and Gaylyn fully shared his feeling. 

==History==
Gaylyn soon-to-be Wyvernspur had her wedding ceremony in 1357 DR. Her father Dimswart spared no expense on the ceremony, trying to impress the Wyvernspur family as they were distant relatives of the crown of [[Cormyr]]. Her mother [[Leona]] worked tirelessly to organize the lavish event. One of the things the bride's family laid [[gold]] for were the services of a famous bard [[Olav Ruskettle]] (in reality a [[halfling]] "bard" [[Olive Ruskettle]]). The bard was abducted by a [[red dragon]] prowling on the [[Storm Horns]] and a sellsword named [[Alias]] was hired to retrieve the entertainment.

The swordswoman succeeded and the wedding was to commence uninterrupted. Gaylyn along with her bridesmaids and friends stayed up giggling and celebrating the bride's last night of freedom loudly into the morning. The young woman, nevertheless, appeared fresh, happy, and restless with giddiness. The wedding celebration was interrupted after all when Alias, controlled by her azure bonds, attempted to assassinate who she believed was King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], and who was in fact the groom's cousin, [[Giogioni Wyvernspur]]. The attempt was foiled when the sellsword's friends collapsed the tent on the crowd. Even though Lady Leona was furious over this, Gaylyn, her new husband, and their friends emerged from under the tent giggling hysterically.

Following the wedding, the happy couple moved to [[Immersea]], to reside with the rest of the Wyvernspur clan in the [[Redstone Castle]].

In [[1358 DR]], Gaylin and Freffie welcomed their firstborn child: [[Amber Leona Wyvernspur|Amberlee]]. Soon after, the newborn was kidnapped by a wizard named [[Flattery Wyvernspur]], [[Finder Wyvernspur]]'s [[construct]] "child". He attempted to use the child to get his hands on the Wyvernspur family's wondrous heirloom, the [[Wyvern's Spur]]. The child was rescued and the wizard eventually defeated by Giogioni Wyvernspur, Olive Ruskettle, [[Drone Wyvernspur]], Aunt Dorath, and [[Cat (person)|Cat]]. Subsequently, Olive became a close ally and a friend of the family. She performed at baby Amberlee's [[Sel√ªnite]] blessing ceremony but declined the offer to stay at the [[Redstone Castle]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Gaylyn and Frefford attended a birthday party for King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|Azoun IV]] at Lord [[Partic Thistle]]'s estate of [[Thistleflame Keep]]. They stayed overnight, and were questioned as to Lord Thistle's apparent murder that evening.

By the {{YearlinkName|1407}}, Gaylyn had followed in her father's footsteps. She bore a renowned title of the Sage Most Learned of the Royal Court of Cormyr. Her works included musings on the history of the [[Barbarian]]s of [[the Ride]].
