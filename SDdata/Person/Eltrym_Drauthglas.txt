'''Eltrym Drauthglas''' was an independent land owner in the [[Hullack Forest]] in the 12{{th}} century [[DR]]. His land was forceably annexed by the kingdom of [[Cormyr]], but Eltrym was allowed to keep his title and stewardship of the land. He was the last male [[Drauthglas]] and by tradition the bloodline ended with him, even though he was survived by six daughters.

==Description==
Eltrym was tall and had a very dignified bearing. In later life, the hair on the top of his head disappeared, but had a full gray beard.

==Abilities==
He was a skilled hunter and warrior for most of his adult life. He was crippled in battle when a [[horse]] rolled over him.

==Relationships==
Eltrym sired four sons and six daughters. All four male heirs were killed in battles with Cormyr. His daughters, from eldest to youngest, were [[Jalalla Drauthglas|Jalalla]], [[Theera Drauthglas|Theera]], [[Ghaunyl Drauthglas|Ghaunyl]], [[Ileeyra Drauthglas|Ileeyra]], [[Ormarra Drauthglas|Ormarra]], and [[Yolara Drauthglas|Yolara]]. His wife preceded him in death by a number of years.

Despite having been conquered by Cormyr, Eltrym eventually became friends with King [[Pryntaler Obarskyr|Pryntaler]] and they enjoyed playing [[chess (game)|chess]] and discussing Cormyrean business over a glass of [[wine]].

==History==
The history of the conflict between Pryntaler and Eltrym, as seen from the royal perspective, was documented by Lady [[Auleethaea Cormaeril]], a lady-in-waiting to Queen [[Alvandira]], in her diaries.{{Cite dragon/281/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 4|77}}
