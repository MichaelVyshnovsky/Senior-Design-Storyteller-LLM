Eltrym Drauthglas was an independent land owner in the Hullack Forest in the 12 century DR. His land was forceably annexed by the kingdom of Cormyr, but Eltrym was allowed to keep his title and stewardship of the land. He was the last male Drauthglas and by tradition the bloodline ended with him, even though he was survived by six daughters.
Eltrym was tall and had a very dignified bearing. In later life, the hair on the top of his head disappeared, but had a full gray beard.
He was a skilled hunter and warrior for most of his adult life. He was crippled in battle when a horse rolled over him.
Eltrym sired four sons and six daughters. All four male heirs were killed in battles with Cormyr. His daughters, from eldest to youngest, were Jalalla, Theera, Ghaunyl, Ileeyra, Ormarra, and Yolara. His wife preceded him in death by a number of years.
Despite having been conquered by Cormyr, Eltrym eventually became friends with King Pryntaler and they enjoyed playing chess and discussing Cormyrean business over a glass of wine.
The history of the conflict between Pryntaler and Eltrym, as seen from the royal perspective, was documented by Lady Auleethaea Cormaeril, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Alvandira, in her diaries.
