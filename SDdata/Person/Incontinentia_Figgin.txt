==Description==
Incontinentia was a drow woman with long white hair gathered in a ponytail. She wore a set of armor dyed green.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a large group of [[duergar]], [[giant spider]]s, and [[drow]], was slaughtered in the home of a [[Bloomridge Park]] groundskeeper, [[Lavernica]]. The murder spree was performed by [[Orin the Red]] and her [[Murder Tribunal]] of [[Bhaal]]. Incontinentia's body was gutted and displayed in a grotesque display at the center of a small cave under the groundskeeper's home. Her body was turned into an effigy representing [[Sendai]], a drow [[Bhaalspawn]] who died a century earlier at the hands of [[Abdel Adrian]]. The grisly display was embellished with the bodies of Lavernica, [[Broom Boy Tigrellpie]], [[Josef the Ferret]], [[Fluemartina B. Martelles]], [[Abaforth Zelksix]], [[Appleblossom Cathraelk]], [[Damn 'Em All Holmwood]], [[Zybil Hastenwald]], and [[Cotre Silkwright]].
