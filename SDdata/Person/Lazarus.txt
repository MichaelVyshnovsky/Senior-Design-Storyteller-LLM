Lazarus was a drow psionicist from the Underdark, active in the 14 century DR.
Lazarus the Drow had dark, purple-hued skin, dark eyes, and dark hair, virtually unheard of among drow elves. He wore a hefty amulet around his neck.
Lazarus possessed a powerful gift for psionics. All typical psionic powers used by this man were doubled in power and his presence rendered Lazaruss allies immune to psionics.
