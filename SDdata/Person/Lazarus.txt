'''Lazarus''' was a [[drow]] [[psionicist]] from the [[Underdark]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Lazarus the Drow had dark, purple-hued skin, dark eyes, and dark hair, virtually unheard of among drow [[elves]]. He wore a hefty [[amulet]] around his neck.

==Abilities==
Lazarus possessed a powerful gift for [[psionics]]. All typical psionic powers used by this man were doubled in power and his presence rendered Lazarus's allies immune to psionics.
