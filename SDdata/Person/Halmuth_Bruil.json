Halmuth did not care, being more concerned with the increasing activity of orcs from Thar. He spoke with the adventuring party hired by Lord Woarsten Nanther to find the scions, saying that theyd left from of the northern gate together with the dwarf adventurer Dorn Crownshield.\nHalmuth was well known for his brutality, but he was also a very cunning individual, very talented in tactics and strategies. He cared nothing for the missing scions."
