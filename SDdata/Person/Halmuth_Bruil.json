        "History": "In 1374 DR, some scions of the noble houses went on adventures and disappeared, including the heir of [[Bruil|House Bruil]], [[Argens Bruil]]. Halmuth did not care, being more concerned with the increasing activity of [[orc]]s from [[Thar]]. He spoke with the adventuring party hired by Lord [[Woarsten Nanther]] to find the scions, saying that they'd left from of the northern gate together with the [[dwarf]] adventurer [[Dorn Crownshield]].",
        "Personality": "Halmuth was well known for his brutality, but he was also a very cunning individual, very talented in tactics and strategies. He cared nothing for the missing scions."
