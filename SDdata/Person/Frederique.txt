Frederique, who was also simply called Red for his hair color, was an agent of the Harpers active within the city of Kzelter in the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Frederique monitored all soldier movements between Kzelter and Mintar for both the Harpers and the crown of Tethyr. His intimate knowledge of the region provided him with interesting solutions to his problems. For instance, Frederique was aware that the Ala-min tribe moved their herds in the Spring across the same routes used by Banites en route to Kzelter. He was hopeful that he could convince the Lion Tribes leader, Faerdaleeyn, to attack the Banites. Barring this straightforward approach, Frederique planned to arrange a chance meeting between the two in order to achieve the same outcome.
