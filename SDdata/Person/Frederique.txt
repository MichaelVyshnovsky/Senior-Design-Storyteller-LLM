'''Frederique''', who was also simply called '''Red''' for his hair color, was an agent of the [[Harpers]] active within the city of [[Kzelter]] in the [[Lake of Steam]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Frederique monitored all soldier movements between Kzelter and [[Mintar]] for both the Harpers and the crown of Tethyr. His intimate knowledge of the region provided him with interesting solutions to his problems. For instance, Frederique was aware that the [[Ala-min]] tribe moved their herds in the Spring across the same routes used by [[Banite]]s en route to Kzelter. He was hopeful that he could convince the Lion Tribe's leader, [[Faerdaleeyn]], to attack the Banites. Barring this straightforward approach, Frederique planned to arrange a chance meeting between the two in order to achieve the same outcome.
