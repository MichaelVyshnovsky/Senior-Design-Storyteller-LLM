        "mainbody": "'''Ben-Karad''' was a [[priest]] of [[Myrkul]] who died years before the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Ben-Karad was one of the known owners of a unique [[enchanted]] [[Myrkulyte]] [[belt]] â€“ the ''[[Belt of Bones]]''. When the [[wizard]] from [[Urmlaspyr]] named [[Isanan]] retired, he found a buyer for the magic belt that served him for several years. Ben-Karad was overjoyed with being able to claim a Myrkulyte item for himself and gladly made the purchase. However, his life ended in the [[sewers of Waterdeep]] some years before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, and the ''Belt of Bones'' was though lost until it reappeared in [[Icewind Dale]] some time later."
