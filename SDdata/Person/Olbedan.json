        "mainbody": "'''Master Sufferer Olbedan''' was a priest of [[Ilmater]] the Broken God, dwelling at the [[House of the Harmed]] in [[Aralent]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. Olbedan was widely regarded as a saintly and trustworthy soul.\n\nIn the [[1343 DR|Year of the Boot, 1343 DR]], the people of [[Hlondeth]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] requested that the [[Graycloak's Wolves]] adventuring company deliver the ''[[Tome of Torment]]''—the holiest book of the [[church of Ilmater]]—to Master Sufferer Olbedan in Aralent. However, during the harsh winter, Graycloak's Wolves fell prey to [[doppelganger]]s and [[leucrotta]] preying on travellers and never made it to Olbedan. The ''Tome'' was thought lost in the winter snows.",
