'''Tyranis Shagal''' was a [[bloodforge]] mage who laid claim to [[Herne's Wood]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

Shagal was known as a [[Great Mage (Bloodforge)|great mage]] with impressive achievements.

An itinerant [[bard]] told the leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] about Shagal. Seeking to win glory by defeating a worthy opponent, the leader issued a challenge to Shagal to fight a bloodforge battle.
