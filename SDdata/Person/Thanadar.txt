'''Thanadar''' of [[Dragonrock]] was an adventuring [[ranger]] through the early-to-late-mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], and a member of [[The Nine]].

==Description==
He was tall, with graying hair, steel-gray eyes, and an urbane manner.

==Personality==
Though once merry and proud, he was much-changed since.

==Abilities==
Despite his age, the ranger was very strong in {{yearlink|1367}} despite a career that stretched before {{yearlink|1337}} and a human lifespan.

Of note, due to a curse, Thanadar had to change his name.

==Possessions==
Thanadar had a significant amount of magic on him, including a ''[[defending|defender]]'' [[longsword]], a ''[[ring of shooting stars]]'', a ''[[girdle of many pouches]]'', a seemingly endless supply of ''[[potions of healing]]'' in it, and a ''[[blink ring]]'' with the ability to use ''[[blink]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', and ''[[teleport without error]]'' twice a day each.

==Activities==
Thanadar led a small band of caravan guards he'd trained himself, which operated in the [[Sword Coast North]].

==Relationships==
Once one of [[The Nine]] alongside the [[bard]] later known [[Arnthiir Windrivv]] and Laeral Silverhand, after they were released from their curses, Thanadar continued to be in occassional contact with Laeral Silverhand.

Notably, Thanadar had taken the name of a grand-uncle of his', a man from [[Dragonrock]], who had died some decades prior to {{yearlink|1367}}.

Thanadar had gained the rare trust of the [[elves]] in [[Greycloak Hills]] and could pass through unmolested.

==History==
The bard was one of the Nine in {{yearlink|1337}}, the year in which they acquired the ''[[Crown of Horns]]'', a [[Myrkul]]ite artifact; the crown put a curse on them that gave any [[hordling]] in [[Hades]] the ability to ''[[teleport without error]]'' to their presence, even across planes, by simply uttering their names. Laeral came to possess the ''Crown'' through most of that time; with its fell power, the artifact drove the adventurers to fight each other until Laeral was rescued by [[Khelben Arunsun]]. The mage then broke the curse on the surviving members, including him and the ranger, but that required them to abandon their old names.

By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], he spent most of his time heading a company of caravan guards throughout the [[Sword Coast North]].

==Rumors & Legends==
It was said he kept a cache of [[enchanted]] devices in the [[Marsh of Chelimber]].
