'''Sato Masako''' was a [[samurai]] retainer of the [[Niwa clan]] and [[jito]] of [[Tosa]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
In 1357 DR, Sato went to a small village led by [[Gobo]] to stop some bandit [[sohei]] in answer to a letter sent by Gobo. As he arrived, however, the village was raided and Gobo killed. Sato gave help to the villagers and hired some adventurers who happened to be there to find these raiders and report to him in Tosa.

==Activities==
In Tosa he led a company of three samurai and twelve [[bushi]]. He was busy trying to stop a group of [[Tengu]] living in nearby hills that played pranks to him for his fatness
