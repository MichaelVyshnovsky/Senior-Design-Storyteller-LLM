        "History": "She was born in [[Marsember]], [[Cormyr]], and retired there around [[1338 DR]]. She became wealthy creating and selling magical items and potions. In turn, she bought the rare materials she needed to complete these items. She was pretty despite her age.\n\nFilfaeril survived two attacks. The first, by pirates, was an attempt to capture her for her skills. The second was by a group led by the [[Zhentarim]], who tried to kill her and steal her magic items. She was protected both times by being enclosed in a magical healing sphere."
