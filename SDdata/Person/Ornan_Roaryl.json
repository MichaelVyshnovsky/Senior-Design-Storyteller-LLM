        "mainbody": "'''Ornan Roaryl''' was the king of [[Eskorn]], [[Laerakond]], as of [[1479 DR]]. He was a member of the [[Clan Roaryl|Roaryl]] dynasty.",
        "Description": "Ornan was a red-faced, rugged but aging man.",
        "Personality": "Ornan was a veteran who spent many years fighting outlaws, would-be usurpers, and monsters. He strove to be just and fair, but he had little patience for those who defied him. King Ornan liked plain talk, honest dealings, and subjects who were kind to and supportive of each other.",
        "Background": "The common people of Eskorn loved their king, and believed that any setback suffered in the kingdom was the work of his opposition or of evil outsiders. Eskornar nobility, however, didn't held King Ornan in high regard and wanted to either put his daughter, [[Dlorna Roaryl]], as the new Queen of Eskorn, or to usurp the throne, as was the case of the nobles led by [[Amaunthur Sardron]].",
        "Activities": "Under his rule, King Ornan traveled across Eskorn, bringing his justice across the realm. He was a harsh judge, executing murderers and flogging thieves while proclaiming their crimes. Those who didn't deserved to die were put to work under his knights' services. While he was traveling, he left his servant, [[Mreskan Haundle]], to serve as his seneschal in [[Stormhelm]]. He used the [[Seeing Stones]] to communicate with Mreskan whenever was needed.",
        "Relationships": "King Ornan was a three times widower who had three children: princes [[Imrar Roaryl]] and [[Flandarr Roaryl]], and princess Dlorna Roaryl."
