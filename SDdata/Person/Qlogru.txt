Qlogru was a mind flayer wizard during the mid-1480s DR.
In addition to typical illithid abilities, they were a powerful arcane spellcaster, and were served by various creatures including water elementals and skeletons.
Qlogru lurked near the drow city of Sschindylryn in the Underdark around the time of their invasion of Eveningstar.
