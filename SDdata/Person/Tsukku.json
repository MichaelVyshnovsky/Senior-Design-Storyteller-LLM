        "mainbody": "Tsukku was a samurai in the town of Aru in Wa in the 1770s on the Wa Calendar.\nHe was a lieutenant of Buntaro Ostato and served Benju Matsutomo, daimyo of Aru Province.\nTsukku was young but a very proud samurai. He took any kind of offense very seriously, even challenging an offender to a duel, but he would not go against orders and would tolerate any rudeness if he had to.\nHe wore a brown kimono and ring mail, and was armed with katana and wakizashi.\nHe was adept in horsemanship, calligraphy, painting, and poetry.\nOne night in high summer in , Benju ordered Tsukku to meet a group of adventurers who were staying at The Waiting Stone, a local ryokan (inn). He was to invite them to a midnight meeting with the daimyo at his donjon, and escort them there, and not take no for an answer. Tsukku privately felt the adventurers were most likely rogues and ronin. He met them with a group of seven other samurai, and later escorted them back."
