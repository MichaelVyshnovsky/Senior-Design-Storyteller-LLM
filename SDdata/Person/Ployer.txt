'''Ployer''' was a businessman and slaver of [[Calimshan]] who operated businesses in [[Athkatla]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''My name means nothing?  Nothing?! I am Baron Ployer! PLOYER! You ruined me! Not remembering is an even greater insult!  You are why I am destitute today! You and your Harper kin accused me of breeding slaves in Calimshan!  My businesses in Athkatla were taken!  I was made a pauper and you do not even remember?!''|Ployer, confronting Jaheira}}

==Description==
Until his holdings were taken from him, Ployer was once a baron from the Calishite Ployer family.

==History==
At some point the [[Harpers]] [[Jaheira]] and [[Belgrade]] discovered and spread word of Ployer's slave-breeding operation in Calimshan. Following these accusations, Athkatlan officials stripped Ployer of his titles and Athkatlan business holdings. He was left completely destitute.

He formulated a plot to take revenge on the Harpers for what he perceived as their "libelous ways". He used the last of his resources to hire [[Terrece]] and his [[spellcaster]]s to develop a lingering [[curse]] that would kill the Harper members over time. By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Ployer managed to afflict the curse upon Belgrade, causing his death. Operating from the [[Sea's Bounty]] tavern, he sought out Jaheira to do the same.
