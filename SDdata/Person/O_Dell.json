When the [[Crossroad Keep]] was reclaimed by [[Neverwinter]] and subsequently became the the hub for the [[Mercantile House]] of merchant princess [[Sa'Sani]] of [[Samarach]], O'Dell found himself working as the Caravan Master for the coaster's activities in [[Northwest Faerûn]]. Caravans under O'Dell's supervision traveled between the Crossroad Keep, Neverwinter, [[Leilon]], [[Conyberry]], [[New Leaf]], [[Highcliff]], [[Phandalin]], [[Thundertree]], [[Port Llast]], and the [[West Harbor]]."
