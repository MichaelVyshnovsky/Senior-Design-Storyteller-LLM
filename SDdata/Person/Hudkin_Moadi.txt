Hudkin Moadi was the halfling mayor of the city of Krenadir in Luiren in 1367 DR.
Hudkin hated adventurers of all types, and sent many to their deaths on foolhardy quests within the Mortick Swamp.
Hudkin wished to be an adventurer in his youth, but found the hardships of life on the road to be distasteful.
