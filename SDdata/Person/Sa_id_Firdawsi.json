        "mainbody": "Said Firdawsi was a rich halfling cloth merchant in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.\nTypical for many halflings, Said was cheerful and got along well with most people. All of this was an elaborate ruse that concealed his manipulative nature.\nSaids cloth business in the Court District was a front for his real job as spymaster of Huzuz. His network of spies stretched across the entire expanse of the Land of Fate. He communicated regularly with Tannous al-Assad with special message rings. In order to keep hired muscle ignorant of their true patron, Tannous used Said to hire adventurers and mercenaries for his special missions.\nTannous al-Assad personally appointed Said to his position when Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir became the Grand Caliph 30 years earlier."
