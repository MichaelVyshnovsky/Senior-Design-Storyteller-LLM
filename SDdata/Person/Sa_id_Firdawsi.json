        "Personality": "Typical for many halflings, Sa'id was cheerful and got along well with most people. All of this was an elaborate ruse that concealed his manipulative nature.",
        "Activities": "Sa'id's cloth business in the [[Court District]] was a front for his real job as spymaster of Huzuz. His network of spies stretched across the entire expanse of the Land of Fate. He communicated regularly with [[Tannous al-Assad]] with special [[message ring]]s. In order to keep hired muscle ignorant of their true patron, Tannous used Sa'id to hire adventurers and mercenaries for his special missions.",
        "History": "Tannous al-Assad personally appointed Sa'id to his position when [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]] became the [[Grand Caliph]] 30 years earlier."
