Pharaxes Zora was a cleric of Bane who was stationed in Elmwood during the Rage of Dragons of , in an attempt to conquer it for the Zhentarim. He was slain by Pavel Shemovs party.
Barrel-chested, Pharaxes uncombed, greasy hair and stained clothing made him resemble a violent ruffian more than a priest.
Pharaxes got a cynical thrill out of lying to people he perceived as unable to respond. He was quick to resort to insults, and swift to punish perceived disobedience.
Pharaxes entered into a spell duel with Pavel Shemov.
In addition to his armor, his holy symbol of Bane and a morningstar, Pharaxes carried a ring of magic detection, which he used to determine that Karasendrieth was probably concealing some possessions from them.
Officially a "customs agent" in Elmwood, Pharaxes was part of a very official-sounding scheme to rob every traveler on behalf of an alliance around the Moonsea to fight the Rage of Dragons. The alliance, yet to materialize, had Zhentil Keep at its head and had granted itself the right to arbitrarily tax travelers passing through Elmwood.
He was also the captain of a warship, the Dagger, out of Yulash.
Pharaxes was slain in Tarsakh 11, while in a spell duel against Pavel Shemov that started after his party attacked him in protection of Karasendrieths possessions, which they expected would be confiscated by the customs agent.
