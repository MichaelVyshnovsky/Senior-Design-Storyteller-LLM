'''Pharaxes Zora''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Bane]] who was stationed in [[Elmwood]] during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of {{yearlink|1373}}, in an attempt to conquer it for the [[Zhentarim]]. He was slain by [[Pavel Shemov]]'s party.{{cite book/The Rage||17}}

==Description==
Barrel-chested, Pharaxes' uncombed, greasy hair and stained clothing made him resemble a violent ruffian more than a priest.

==Personality==
Pharaxes got a cynical thrill out of lying to people he perceived as unable to respond. He was quick to resort to insults, and swift to punish perceived disobedience.

==Abilities==
Pharaxes entered into a spell duel with Pavel Shemov.

==Possessions==
In addition to his armor, his holy symbol of Bane and a morningstar, Pharaxes carried a [[ring of magic detection]], which he used to determine that [[Karasendrieth]] was probably concealing some possessions from them.

==Activities==
Officially a "customs agent" in Elmwood, Pharaxes was part of a very official-sounding scheme to rob every traveler on behalf of an alliance around the Moonsea to fight the [[Rage of Dragons]]. The alliance, yet to materialize, had [[Zhentil Keep]] at its head and had granted itself the right to arbitrarily tax travelers passing through Elmwood.

He was also the captain of a warship, the ''Dagger'', out of [[Yulash]].

==History==
Pharaxes was slain in [[Tarsakh 11]], while in a spell duel against [[Pavel Shemov]] that started after his party attacked him in protection of [[Karasendrieth]]'s possessions, which they expected would be confiscated by the customs agent.
