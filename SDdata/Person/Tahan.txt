'''Tahan''' was a [[druid]] and a resident of the [[Emerald Grove]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Tahan was resentful of the [[tieflings]] that were given temporary residence within the Emerald Grove following [[the Descent]] of [[Elturel]] into the [[Nine Hells]]. The fact their presence attracted violence to the Emerald Grove was too much for her to forgive.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Archdruid Halsin allowed a community of tiefling refugees take up residence within the Emerald Grove, just before leaving himself to investigate strange goings on associated with the enigmatic [[Moonrise Towers]]. These two factors combined with the misguided leadership of the temporary leader [[Kagha]], threw the grove into turmoil and upset druids like Tahan.

Tahan was among the druids tapped to perform the ''[[Rite of Thorns]]'', a ritual utilizing the ''[[idol of Silvanus]]'' that would hide away the grove from outsiders and protect it from the world beyond.
