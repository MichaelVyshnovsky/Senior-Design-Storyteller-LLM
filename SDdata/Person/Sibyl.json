        "mainbody": "The '''Serpent Sibyl''', or simply '''Sibyl''', was a [[half-fiend]] [[yuan-ti abomination]] [[fighter]] and [[sorcerer]] of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who was once an [[avatar]] of [[Sseth]], god of the [[yuan-ti]], and desired to be so again. She commanded the cult known as the [[Sibyl's Chosen]].",
        "Description": "She had a serpentine body that was {{SI|14|ft|long=yes}} long with a hide of thick black scales. She had four scaled arms—she favored the upper two for spellcasting and the lower two for weaponry—and a set of wings similar to a [[pterodactyl]]'s emerging from her back. Finally, her eyes glowed a malevolent crimson hue.",
        "Abilities": "She possessed all the unholy powers of a half-fiend and all the abilities of a yuan-ti abomination. As well as being an adept sorcerer, this provided the Serpent Sibyl with an array of spells and magical gifts.\n\nShe was highly skilled in the spiked chain, and in the use of spells in combat.",
        "Worshipers": "Sibyl's worshipers included the [[Se'Sehen]] yuan-ti tribe, which lived in [[south Faerûn]], and [[Medusanna Mhairdaul|Medusanna]] of [[House Mhairdaul]].",
        "History": "The Serpent Sibyl was the progeny of a yuan-ti abomination and a [[marilith]]. However, she believed herself to be a reincarnation of Sseth himself, specifically of an avatar that had reigned over [[Serpentes]] a millennium before.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{yearlinkName|1358}}, Sseth chose the Serpent Sybil as his [[avatar]]. But the god's presence in her mind overwhelmed it, and she retained few memories of the experience. The Serpent Sybil remembered feeling powerful, rising high over the [[Lapal Sea]] and gazing down on the [[Pit of Vipers]], once part of Serpentes. She also remembered battling with a reptilian monster with enormous jaws and blazing with divine power. Later, other yuan-ti told her she fought the god [[Ubtao]], Father of the Dinosaurs, which the Serpent Sibyl accepted readily.\n\nAfter the god was gone, her body was left stronger, so the Serpent Sibyl believed that Sseth could return to her at any time when he next had need of her. She was also believed that Serpentes might be restored.\n\nYears later, in the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, the Serpent Sybil arrived in the [[Scaled Halls of Varae]] beneath [[Hlondeth]], the City of Serpents, in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. There, she attracted [[serpentfolk]] to a cult of Sseth, who venerated the Slitherer Supreme at the long-abandoned altar. The Sibyl's Chosen, as they were called, swiftly swelled in numbers and power, until they risked threatening the dominance of [[House Extaminos]] in Hlondeth.",
        "Activities": "By [[1373 DR]], the Serpent Sybil plotted to unite yuan-ti holdings all over [[Faerûn]] and establish an empire akin to ancient [[Mhairshaulk]] in its heyday, or even grander, with herself as its empress.\n\nShe and the Sibyl's Chosen allied with another cult, the [[Plague-Mother's Children]], in an effort to make [[tainted one]]s in shocking numbers. Unknown to them, [[Dediana Extaminos]], fearing the Serpent Sybil's power, worked covertly to thwart them.\n\nIn addition, the Serpent Sybil sent several of her yuan-ti to seize and fortify the ''[[Deepwing Portal]]'' in the [[Spines of Surkh]].",
        "Personality": "The Serpent Sibyl was inspirational to her followers, moving them with visions of ancient and glorious yuan-ti empires and driving them to revive that lost legacy. She believed fully in it herself.",
        "Possessions": "She was armed with a ''+5 [[flaming]] [[keen]] [[spiked chain]]'' and a ''+1 [[composite longbow]]'' that imparted incredible strength to the shot, together with a score of ''+1 [[arrow]]s''. She wore ''[[bracers of armor]] +5'' and a ''[[ring of regeneration]]'' and a ''[[ring of protection]] +1''. She had about 600 [[gp]] in coin on hand."
