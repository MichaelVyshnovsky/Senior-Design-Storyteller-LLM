        "mainbody": "eledon was a ghost who was the husband of the elven songstress of the Elfsong Tavern.\nKeledon was located through a door in the Onyx Tower and manifested as a ghostly apparition.\nHe appeared to be wearing a tattered green cloak. His hair, although balding, was white. His body resembled a skeletal structure. Keledon often hovered above the ground.\nKeledon was a soldier of the Westering Sun under Eldriths command. Because of her treachery, Keledon and his men met their fate in the Marsh of Chelimber. Keledon knew the story of the elven maiden who sang in the Elfsong Tavern. He left his wife within the walls of Baldurs Gate, where she would be safe. He described her as the most beautiful elven maid, and he revealed that the voice in the Elfsong Tavern was his wife, who sang in lament for him.\nBoth spirits could not reunite until Eldrith was defeated."
