        "mainbody": "'''Emthreena Gulkryn''' was a priestess of [[Mielikki]] active in the [[High Forest]] in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "She was combating the creeping evil of [[Hellgate Keep]] in the eastern High Forest when, in the {{YearlinkName|964}}, the legendary [[ranger]] [[Yornar|Yornar the Tracker]] gave her the holy [[spellbook]] that would come to be known as ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]''.\n\nEmthreena made good use of it for much of a season until Mielikki sent her dream visions telling her it was time to pass it on, and to give it to a passing ranger who seemed worthy. She duly did so, establishing 'the Rightful Cycle' of the ''Companion'' changing hands from priest to ranger, ranger to priest. However, Emthreena also gain the understanding that a Mielikkian priest might be permitted to use the ''Companion'' a second time after passing it on, but only if the need was great."
