'''Battle-Chaplain Gordon Stakaria''' was the jaded veteran warrior-priest of the temple fortress of [[Swordpoint]] in the city of [[Archenbridge]]. He was the Swordmaster of the [[Shrine_of_Swords_(Archenbridge)|Shrine of Swords]].

==Personality==
Dedicated to the service of [[Tempus]] through the faithful worship of the soldiers of [[Archendale]], Gordon had little time to waste on other faiths or even the devotees of Tempus who hailed from outside his homeland. He spent much of his time seeking a bold and strong woman as a mate, only to see many potential suitors slain tragically in battle.

==Activities==
In return for healing, Gordon accepted prayers to Tempus along with tasks of hardiness and endurance. Among these were:
* Climb a certain [[Arkhen]] peak in the middle of winter, while wielding only a [[dagger]] and wearing a suit of [[leather armor]].
* Find a [[wyvern]] lair, slay one of the beasts, and return its head as an offering to Tempus.
