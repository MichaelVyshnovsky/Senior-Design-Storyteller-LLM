'''Kala Danirith''' was a [[bloodforge]] mage in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

The leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] chased Kala along a tunnel through the mountains, when it collapsed and dropped both of them in the [[Puzzle Palace]]. Kala threatened the leader, and the two foes then fought a bloodforge battle there.
