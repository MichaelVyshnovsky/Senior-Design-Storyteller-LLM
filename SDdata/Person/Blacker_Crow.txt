'''Blacker Crow''' was a [[human]] warrior known for his eye-catching black and red attire.

==Description==
Over his [[chain mail]], Blacker wore a black and red-trimmed cloak. He wore red gloves, and a wide-brimmed cavalier hat adorned with a red feather.

==Possessions==
Blacker's chain mail was of the heavily enchanted variety, and so was his [[longsword]].

==Activities==
Blacker struggled to stand out from other adventurers, eventually causing him to adopt his signature style of fashion. This helped keep him memorable and attracted multiple copy dressers, to the point that he would sometimes get credit for deeds he had no part in.
