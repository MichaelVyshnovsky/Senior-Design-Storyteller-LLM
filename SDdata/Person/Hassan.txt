Hassan was a powerful efreeti who patrolled the halls of the Royal Harim of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Hassan wielded a massive fiery scimitar.
He was sworn to slay any male&mdashaside from the eunuch mamluks also on guard&mdashfound within the Royal Harim.
Hassan began his service to the Grand Caliph when he was presented to Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir as a gift from Adnan al-Raqi.
Over the years, Hassan became rather domesticated by the Grand Caliphs wives. They often encouraged him to take long naps during which male visitors could sneak into the harem.
