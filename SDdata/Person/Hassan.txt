'''Hassan''' was a powerful [[efreeti]] who patrolled the halls of the [[Royal Harim of Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

== Possessions ==
Hassan wielded a massive fiery [[scimitar]].

== Activities ==
He was sworn to slay any male&mdash;aside from the [[eunuch]] [[mamluk]]s also on guard&mdash;found within the Royal Harim.

== Relationships ==
Hassan began his service to the [[Grand Caliph]] when he was presented to [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]] as a gift from [[Adnan al-Raqi]].

Over the years, Hassan became rather domesticated by the Grand Caliph's wives. They often encouraged him to take long naps during which male visitors could sneak into the harem.
