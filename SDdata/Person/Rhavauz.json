        "Description": "During her duties as an officer of [[Szith Morcane]], Rhavauz wore a [[wikipedia:en:Tabard|tabard]] over her [[breastplate]] with the emblem of [[House T'sarran]] on it, a leering black skull upon a white background.",
        "Personality": "Rhavauz had great disdain for the worshipers of [[Lolth]], which only deepened during the [[Silence of Lolth]]. Despite this, she held at least some semblance of hope for those of her own family, that they might join her in the worship of [[Kiaransalee]].",
        "Abilities": "Specializing in the use of a [[two-bladed sword]], Rhavauz was a highly mobile [[fighter]] who could spring in and out of combat as needed.",
        "Possessions": "As an officer in Szith Morane, Rhavauz had access to a nice array of magical items but she customarily kept both a [[magic]]al two-bladed sword and breastplate with her at all times and would wear a pair of ''[[slippers of spider climbing]]'' on her feet.",
        "Relationships": "Rhavauz had a close relationship with [[Indrizil]], a family member who resided under [[Cormanthor]].",
        "History": "Before the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372 DR]], Rhavauz lived in [[Maerimydra]] as a follower of [[Irae T'sarran]] and was involved in the slaughter of the [[Lolth]]ites during the Silence. During the invasion of Maerimydra by the forces of [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]] on [[Eleint 23]] of [[1372 DR]], Rhavauz worked with others of the city to defeat the [[fire giant]] and [[goblinoid]] invaders. When [[House Chumavh]] eventually fell, she fled to [[Szith Morcane]] and became a guard officer in [[Dorina T'sarran]]'s new regime.\n\nBy [[Marpenoth]] of [[1372 DR]], Rhavauz had decided to get in touch with her family in [[Cormanthor]] and composed a letter to [[Indrizil]] hoping it might bring her more allies in Szith Morcane.",
