Dame '''Jenilynn Leyland''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Tyr]], and a [[Knight]] of the [[Right Hand of Tyr]] from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], who married Sir [[Sarren Nightstalker]], [[Knight of the Griffon]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}{{LCRB}}, Jenilynn Leyland made an appearance on the pages of the [[Kythorn]] issue of the ''[[Ravens Bluff Tumpeter]]'' [[broadsheet]]. She was among the attendees of the lavish [[Greengrass Celebration]] sponsored by the temple of [[Lliira]]. The festival was a wild party hosted at the [[Temple of Lliira (Ravens Bluff)|Temple of Lliira]]. Dame Jenilynn Leyland, a known conservative and a critic of the [[Church of Sharess]], was reported by [[Clio Hesperin]] of the ''Trumpeter'' to had been acting like a Sharessian during the festival. She was said to had drank a single glass of [[wine]] and instantly became enamored by Sir Sarren "Thrud" Nightstalker, who also was in attendance. The well-respected cleric of Tyr led Sir Nightstalker into a darker corner of the temple's dance floor. The rest of the scene was left to the ''Trumpeter'' reader's imagination.

In [[Flamerule]] of the same year, Dame Jenilynn Leyland announced her campaign for the Deputy Mayor position up for reelection. She published an open letter to the citizens of Ravens Bluff in that month's issue of ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter,'' in which she proclaimed that the Bluff deserved open and honest government, bringing to attention the past year's treasonous Deputy Mayor, [[fiend]] attackers that kidnapped and enslaved teenage girls, and corrupt judges. Jenilynn built her campaign on her being a trustworthy Knight and a cleric of Tyr Grimjaws. She promised safety on the streets, even as far as [[Crow's End]]. In the same letter, Dame claimed to had been [[drug]]ed during at the Greengrass Celebration and promised to protect the citizens from such crimes.{{Cite trumpeter/2-7s/Government Positions Draw Plenty of Nominations|4}}

In [[Marpenoth]] of 1371 DR, the wedding of Dame Jenilynn Leyland and Sir Sarren Nightstalker took place at Sir [[Alexander Thorin]]'s estate, a fellow Knight of the Right hand of Tyr. The ceremony was performed by [[Tatyanna Elfsdottir]]. Jenilynn Leyland's attendants were [[elf|elven]] Lady [[Dominique Thorin]], Dame [[Ladyhawke]] of the [[Knights of the Golden Rooster]], Squire [[Selphiras Elvenstar]], and [[Sally Elvenstar]] as a flower girl. It was reported on the pages of the ''Trumpeter'' the wedding was scheduled for an earlier date, but Jenilynn Leyland was delayed by her mission to the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] and being transformed into a [[unicorn]].
