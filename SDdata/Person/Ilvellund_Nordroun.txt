'''Ilvellund Nordroun''' was a head of the [[Highknight]]s in [[Cormyr]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He had little patience in the field, and was mindful of the chain of command.

==Activities==
He was commander of the [[Highknights]] of [[Cormyr]], and he was well-regarded. He had also trained some highknights.

==Relationships==
He had been the one to train [[Merlar]].

During the raid where he died, Ilvellund Nordroun was part of a team that included [[Merlar]], [[Eskrel Starbridge]], and [[Therlon]]. Kelgantor was the leader of the full squad.

==History==
Ilvellund Nordroun was tapped for the raid on [[Tethgard]] in [[Mirtul 5]] of {{yearlink|1479}}, after the fugitive wizard [[Elminster Aumar]], who had stolen the ''[[Royal Gorget of Battle]]'' was finally tracked there. He was at loggerheads with [[Shuldroon]], a [[war wizard]] who tried to give the orders in the squad, eventually outright refusing an order from the latter when he told him to bind [[the Simbul]], a sorceress and previous queen of [[Aglarond]], when they found her with Elminster.

Once the combat began, he continued to countermand Shuldroon's orders, even as casualties increased.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|34-37|3}} After the raid, Eskrel Starbridge became the head of all highknights, clearly signaling that Ilvellund had not been among the survivors.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|278|26}}
