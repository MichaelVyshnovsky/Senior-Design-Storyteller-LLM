        "Description": "Cirian was a [[human]] woman with light skin and brown eyes. Her head showed a half-shaven scalp and, on the opposite side, a mop of long blonde hair. When out of her civilian disguise, she wielded a common tool of her [[Bhaalist]] sect â€“ an [[enchanted]] [[dagger]] called ''[[Murderous Cut]].''",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Cirian led a band of murderers on a mission of venerating their evil [[deity]] through the slaughtering of innocents in the [[Bloomridge Park]] of the [[Lower City]]. It was unknown if the slaughter was commenced or if the Bhaalists were stopped and slain by the [[Absolute Adversaries]]."
