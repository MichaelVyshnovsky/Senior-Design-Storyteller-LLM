'''Jelvus Grinch''' was the "First Citizen" of [[Neverwinter]] in the mid&ndash;15{{th}} century [[DR]], meaning he was the ''de facto'' leader of the ruined town and of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] following the [[Ruining]].

==Personality==
Through his toughness, courage, and strength of will, Jelvus Grinch rose to become the nominal leader of the people eking out a living in the ruins of Neverwinter following the city's destruction. He was known not to shy away from any challenge, but so too could recognize when he had no leverage in a confrontation.

==Relationships==
In his capacity as a capable leader of the ruined city of Neverwinter, Jelvus Grinch met and made allies of [[Artemis Entreri]] and [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. He had also met [[Reginald Roundshield]] (as "[[Bonnego Battleaxe]]") later in life.{{Cite digital book/The Companions/Kindle||22}}

==History==
After [[Mount Hotenow]] exploded in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, and destroyed his native city,{{Cite digital book/Gauntlgrym||9}} Jelvus came to be recognized among the survivors as a leader, and was referred to by many as the "first citizen of Neverwinter".

In the {{YearlinkName|1463}}, Jelvus allied with the [[Shadovar]] representative [[Herzgo Alegni]] against the [[Thayan]]s.

Following the arrival of [[Dagult Neverember]] in Neverwinter, Jelvus was sidelined, although he was offered a modicum of respect by the new regime in recognition that many citizens still looked to him for guidance. As of the {{YearlinkName|1483}}, he still commanded a few of the Guards manning [[The Wall (Neverwinter)|The Wall]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, an elderly Jelvus accompanied Lord Dagult Neverember and General [[Sabine]] to a meeting with Bruenor Battlehammer and [[Emerus Warcrown]] in Neverwinter to discuss the reclamation of [[Gauntlgrym]] from the [[drow]].
