Galen Addakal was a bloodforge mage in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).
Galen was an arrogant bully who wandered the land hurting people. After a rampage through the villages of the Realm of Lands raised complaints, the leader of the Legendary Campaign vowed to punish Galen in a bloodforge battle.
