        "mainbody": "'''Zstulkk Ssarmn''' was a [[yuan-ti abomination]] who was a slaver of [[Skullport]] and one of the founders of the [[Iron Ring]].",
        "Description": "Zstulkk Ssarmn's head closely resembled a [[human]], but the rest of his body was that of a large [[snake]] with no arms or legs.<ref group=\"note\">Despite being a [[yuan-ti]], Zstulkk's appearance is more similar to a [[naga]]. He wore a magical neckband that made him appear fully human, albeit with a low-sloping forehead and skin that did not quite conceal a pattern of scales.",
        "Possessions": "In order to appear human, Zstulkk had a magical neckband that altered his appearance. He was also known to wear a ''[[brooch of shielding]]'' and a ''[[ring of protection]] +2''.",
        "Relationships": "The leaders of the consortium, known as the Lords of Iron, were reluctant partners at best and despised enemies at worst, but worked together enough to make a successful slave trade organization, all the while scheming to take control of the Iron Ring for themselves.",
        "History": "Zstulkk hailed from [[Hlondeth]] he founded&mdash;together with fellow slaver and priest of [[Loviatar]], [[Quinan Varnaed]]&mdash;the Iron Ring consortium. Zstulkk maintained a cadre of [[yuan-ti pureblood]]s and [[yuan-ti halfblood|half-breeds]] under him.\n\nIn [[Nightal]], [[1369 DR]], Zstulkk Ssarmn threatened another Lord of Iron, [[Ahmaergo]] of the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]], in front of the general populace and then later that night staged a symbolic attack on Ahmaergo's residence using yuan-ti agents. The purpose of this show of force was unknown, but Ahmaergo responded by changing and reinforcing his defenses and having two yuan-ti publicly murdered in the street.\n\nOne of Zstulkk's plots was to construct a secret temple to [[Sseth]] and afterward create so many yuan-ti that they could overthrow the city. This temple was completed by [[1372 DR]] beneath his home, and the process of creating new yuan-ti servitors was begun, including the creation of [[tainted one]]s."
