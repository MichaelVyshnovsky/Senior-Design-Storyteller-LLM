When they ran out of [[spell]]s and realized that they had no other options, the two men agreed to sacrifice themselves to stop Palron. Arun struck Khelben's ''[[Duskstaff of Sarael]]'' with his ''[[Lupinaxe]]'', causing an explosion that killed both him and Khelben and turned the surrounding sand to glass."
