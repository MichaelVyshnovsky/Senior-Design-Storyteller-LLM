==History==
Oprion Blackstone was one of the priests that Elthaulin called on to seize control of the Citadel after Fzoul engaged in combat with [[Shandril Shessair]].

After Shandril's last frontal assault on [[Zhentil Keep]], causing the death of Fzoul Chembryl, Oprion impersonated Manshoon and sent a speaking stone to [[Eveningstar]], which carried a message from him impersonating Manshoon to Shandril. In the message, he made the claim that the Brotherhood would no longer seek her ''spellfire''. While scrying on the stone, he caught some of a conversation with [[Elminster]]. Then the real Manshoon turned up and told Oprion to get on with resurrecting Fzoul.

He later contemplated the possibility of ignoring Manshoon's coming request for parley after Shandril's death, only to be warned by local [[beholder]]s that they would kill him for that.
