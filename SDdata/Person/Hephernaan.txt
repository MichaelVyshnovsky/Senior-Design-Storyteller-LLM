Hephernaan was a red abishai and the main architect of the crusade against Dragonspear Castle in 1368 DR.
Hephernaan, a servant of Belhifet, was sent to Faer√ªn in order to find a way to open a gate to the Hells. Disguised as a human cleric/mage, Hephernaan found an ideal pawn in the aasimar Caelar Argent, who had read the Tome of The Nine when she was child and was saved only by the sacrifice of her uncle.
Hephernaan hid his true identity well and managed to convince Caelar to lead a crusade to invade Avernus in order to rescue her uncle. They gathered an army and marched to Dragonspear Castle, where it was known that a gate to the Nine Hells existed.
