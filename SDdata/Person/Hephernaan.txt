'''Hephernaan''' was a [[red abishai]] and the main architect of the crusade against [[Dragonspear Castle]] in [[1368 DR]].

==History==
Hephernaan, a servant of [[Belhifet]], was sent to [[Faerûn]] in order to find a way to open a gate to the [[Hells]]. Disguised as a [[human]] [[cleric]]/[[mage]], Hephernaan found an ideal pawn in the [[aasimar]] [[Caelar Argent]], who had read the [[Tome of The Nine]] when she was child and was saved only by the sacrifice of her uncle.

Hephernaan hid his true identity well and managed to convince Caelar to lead a crusade to invade [[Avernus]] in order to rescue her uncle. They gathered an army and marched to Dragonspear Castle, where it was known that a ''[[gate]]'' to the Nine Hells existed.
