        "History": "In [[1373 DR]], Kurkle was hired by [[Kaanyr Vhok]] and [[Zasian Menz]], accompanied by [[Myshik Morueme]], to serve as their guide through the Elemental Plane of Fire to the [[City of Brass]]. When Myshik turned on his companions, he killed Kurkle and trapped Vhok and Zasian in an extraplanar mansion."
