'''Ahndri Stolyarof''' was a musician and a [[lute]]-player of some renown from [[Faer√ªn]] who lived sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Ahndri was known for playing a unique heavy deep-voiced lute, later known as [[Stolyarof's table lute]]. Notoriously, Ahndri never allowed anyone else to play the instrument. It was unknown if or when Ahndri Stolyarof perished, but by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Stolyarof's table lute was owned by [[Thomas C. Quirkilious]], the [[dragonborn]] proprietor of the [[Chromatic Scale]] musical instrument shop located on the second floor of [[The Glitter Gala]] [[gem]] and jewelry vendor of the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]].
