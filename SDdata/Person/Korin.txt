Korin was a bard and a regular patron of the Beached Leviathan, one of the most popular taverns of Neverwinter in the late years of the 15 century DR.
Korin was known as the "chanteyman" of the Beached Leviathan because he always performed in the tavern. Korin was a friendly fellow, happy to tell stories and lead drinking songs and sea tunes. On occasion, he sang a dark dirge about a man who lost his family to devil cultists that showed real talent.
At some point before 1479 DR, Korins family was murdered by Ashmadai cultists operating out of Neverwinter. Korin went to live in Neverwinter in the hopes of tracking down the cultists and get revenge.
