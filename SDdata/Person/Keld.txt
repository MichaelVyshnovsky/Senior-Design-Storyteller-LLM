'''Keld''' was a [[stone giant]] carver at the [[Lodge of Faces]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Szith Morcane Unbound|15-16}}
  
==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Keld and all his fellows succumbed to the ''[[faerzress]]''-infected madness caused by the [[Purple Statue]]. Keld became very impatient, which was a very strange behavior for a stone giant.
