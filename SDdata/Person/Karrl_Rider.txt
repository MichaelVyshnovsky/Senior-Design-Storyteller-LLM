==Description==
Karrl was a [[human]] man with light skin and blonde hair. He wore a simple [[leather armor]] and carried a [[shortsword]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Karrl Rider and [[Jemeliah]] accompanied Rawleigh Gallaway's caravan to the town of [[Lonelywood]]. The business venture was cut short by a [[barbarian]] army that besieged the town, stopping the Gallaway Trading Coaster wagons from leaving. Karrl, Jemeliah, and Rawleigh Gallaway all were stuck until the barbarian threat was over.
