        "mainbody": "'''Uldus Blackram''' was a [[Shar]]ran faithful during the mid-8{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "He did many things in the woods, and mostly worshipped at a local shrine by day, thanking that he was safe from [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]], an entity that was responsible for the disappearance of most animal life and travelers between [[Ripplestones]] and [[Starmantle]] starting from early spring of {{yearlink|767}}.",
        "History": "Uldus Blackram had been present for the consecration of a [[Shar]]ran shrine in the woods somewhere near [[the Dead Place]], and participated in a ritual which involved barefood, dancing ladies; the memory of it made him blush. In the {{yearlinkName|767}}, about two tendays into the Chaos of [[the Art]] of that year, he was called upon by the Dreadspells of [[Elryn]] to lead them into [[the Dead Place]].\n\nWhile leading the Sharran dreadspells to the ruins, with a noose tied to his throat, they came across Ilbryn Starym. He was struck down by one of the elf's lightning spells; [[Femter Deldrannus]], who was holding his noose, confirmed he was indeed very dead, which tickled him as funny."
