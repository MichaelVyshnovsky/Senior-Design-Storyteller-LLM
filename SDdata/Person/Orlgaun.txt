Orlgaun was a black dragon allied with the Zhentarim and usually ridden by Manshoon.
Manshoon rode him in his first tentative abduction of Shandril Shessair, but thanks to her power of spellfire and her friends she defeated Manshoon and greatly injured the dragon.
Despite Manshoons efforts, the dying Orlgaun lost all his strength and crashed into the ruins of Myth Drannor. A clone of Orlgaun took his place upon his death.
