'''Orlgaun''' was a [[black dragon]] allied with the [[Zhentarim]] and usually ridden by [[Manshoon]].

Manshoon rode him in his first tentative abduction of [[Shandril Shessair]], but thanks to her power of ''[[spellfire]]'' and her friends she defeated Manshoon and greatly injured the dragon.

Despite Manshoon's efforts, the dying Orlgaun lost all his strength and crashed into the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. A clone of Orlgaun took his place upon his death.
