        "History": "In her youth, Alastra was a wide-wandering adventurer: she went from [[Nimbral]] to [[Malatra]] in [[Kara-Tur]] and from [[Zakhara]] in the distant south to the castles of the [[cloud giant]]s above the endless ice of the [[North]]. Finally, Alastra settled in Longsaddle near her friend [[Auglyth Harpell]].\n\nAlastra opened a festhall in the village and continued her business even after Auglyth died in [[1358 DR]].\n\nShe was rumored to be a [[Harper]] or a Harper ally.\n\nAlastra resurfaced around [[1487 DR]] as a fully Harper, and secret lover of [[Malchor Harpell]], and competed with other archmages for the possession of the [[Lost Spell]] during a [[spellstorm]]. Alastra was however killed by [[Maraunth Torr]]."
