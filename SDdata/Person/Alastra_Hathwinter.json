        "mainbody": "Alastra Hathwinter was a wizard in Longsaddle.\nIn her youth, Alastra was a wide-wandering adventurer she went from Nimbral to Malatra in Kara-Tur and from Zakhara in the distant south to the castles of the cloud giants above the endless ice of the North. Finally, Alastra settled in Longsaddle near her friend Auglyth Harpell.\nAlastra opened a festhall in the village and continued her business even after Auglyth died in 1358 DR.\nShe was rumored to be a Harper or a Harper ally.\nAlastra resurfaced around 1487 DR as a fully Harper, and secret lover of Malchor Harpell, and competed with other archmages for the possession of the Lost Spell during a spellstorm. Alastra was however killed by Maraunth Torr."
