        "mainbody": "rughor Axe-Biter was the leader of a group of scouts from the Many-Arrows tribe in the late 15 century DR.\nAxe-Biter was a ferocious brute who led six other orcs in his scouting unit. However, Brughor himself was much more fond of raiding and killing, than he was for just scouting. His orcs would flee from combat if he were slain. Brughor was much more vigorous than ordinary orcs, and was able to survive far longer against blows in combat. As a result of pillaging, Axe-Biter had accumulated a decent amount of currency, as well as three bottles of perfume.\nCirca 1491 DR, Brughors group moved south, burning many houses on their way. They eventually moved to a cave in Wyvern Tor and found an ogre ally, called Gog. After hearing rumors of their existence, the townmaster of Phandalin, Harbin Wester, wished for someone to clear out Brughor and his band."
