Kajeel was the so-called Master of Undergate, who ran his own drinking hole in Westgates shady underbelly â€“ Undergate, in the late 14 century DR.
Kajeel was a very large mind flayer, gambler, business owner, and a talented psion.
Kajeel ran a bar in the Undergate section of Westgate and had many dealings with the infamous Night Masks. His shady underground establishment attracted those in search of criminal dealings and "depraved delights." The mind flayer limited accessibility to his establishment, allowing only individuals with special tokens inside. He chose his clients carefully, allowed the right people in, and kept the wrong people out. Sometime before the , Kajeel was challenged to a game of cards by an overly-drunk and confident dao genie. The elemental bed a hundred years of servitude against Kajeels establishment. Gambling against a prison was a poor decision. The dao lost. Since then, the sarcastic elemental was tasked with guarding the magic gate to the bar located in the Undergate. The unnamed dao was only to let individuals with tokens inside, with no exceptions. The genie was bound by his indented servitude oath and could not disobey. However, he spoke against his master often.
