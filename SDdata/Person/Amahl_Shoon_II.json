        "Description": "Amahl II was a [[wizard]] who was corrupt and completely loyal to his grandfather, the [[Syl-pasha|Pasha]] of [[Calimshan]].",

His father was [[Akkabar Shoon the Younger]].\n\nAmahl had a single son, named [[Amahl Shoon III|Amahl]] after him, and at least two daughters, one of which married [[Rahman Cormal]], who would become king of Tethyr under the [[Shoon Imperium]].",
        "Activities": "During Amahl's reign, the new capital of [[Shoonach]] was constructed, from stone carried away from the sacked city of [[Darromar|Ithmong]].",
        "History": "When Akkabar the Elder realized that King Amahl I would not be his puppet, he sent Amahl II to Amahl I's court to be his heir. Since the elder Amahl had no children of his own, he was unable to refuse.\n\nIn the [[-3 DR|Year of Ruins, &minus;3 DR]], Amahl II slew his \"treacherous\" uncle with poison and then took the throne of Tethyr.\n\nAs his first act as king, Amahl II accused [[Agaryn Ithal]] of murdering his uncle and then began a purge of [[Clan Ithal]]. After waging an eighteen-month war, nearly the entire clan had been rounded up and executed, and the city of Ithmong was destroyed. \n\nAfter his victory with the fall of Ithmong, on [[Greengrass]] in the [[-2 DR|Year of Gruesome Streams]], Amahl II swore fealty to his grandfather, making the nation of Tethyr a puppet state of Calimshan, and elevating his grandfather to be the true ruler of Tethyr.\n\nAmahl II died from disease at the age of 52 years in [[15 DR]], and his only son, Amahl III, succeeded him as puppet king of Tethyr."
