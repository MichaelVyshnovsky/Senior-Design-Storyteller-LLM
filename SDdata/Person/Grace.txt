'''Grace''' was the [[half-orcish]] wife of [[Del (person)|Del]]. Both lived in an unnamed coastal village in [[northwest Faerûn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Grace and Del had a favorite drinking buddy and friend named [[Feltin]] who lived in the same village when a mysterious "haunted" island just off the coast started luring villagers to it. Many disappeared, with Feltin following suit in the 1490s [[DR]].{{HAT-time}} Grace and her husband, by luck, came across [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] at a local tavern. Words of Forge's recent heroic deeds spread wide, and the spouses approached him, seeking help. Forge eagerly invited Grace and Del to a northern town of [[Targos]] where he introduced the commoners to [[Edgin Darvis]], and [[Holga Kilgore]], his fellow "heroes." Grace and Del offered their hard-earned coin as the reward for Feltin's return. Eager to help, Edgin's daughter [[Kira]] promised to help, much to the couple's joy and happy hugs.

Subsequently, it was revealed that the haunting was, in fact, a [[green hag]] who lured and devoured villagers. Edgin's group found Feltin's remains and returned the man's ''[[holy symbol]]'' of [[Chauntea]]. Grace and Del were angered at the "adventurers" bringing them dire news and the couple refused to pay the promised fee. They did not see Feltin's body and thought the green hag story to be nothing but lies. Grace was ready to start throwing punches, but, eventually, both stormed away from Targos.
