        "mainbody": "'''Bobby''', or '''the Barbarian''', was a [[barbarian]] and an [[adventurer]] from [[Earth]] and [[the Realm]] ([[Forgotten Realms|no relation]]). He was a companion of the [[monk]] [[Diana]], the [[fighter]] [[Eric]], the [[ranger]] [[Hank]], the [[wizard]] [[Presto]], and his elder sister, the [[rogue]] [[Sheila]], together with his pet [[unicorn]] foal, [[Uni]].{{Cite comic/Saturday Morning Adventures 1}}",
        "Personality": "Bobby was the youngest of his adventuring group, but was certainly capable. The barbarian was impulsive, had a quick temper, and always ready for battle, tending to act and attack before thinking.",
        "Description": "He was known to be quite small, but was strong for his age, especially when armed with his ''thunder club''. He had blonde hair. He wore fur [[boot]]s and [[loincloth]], as well as studded [[belt]]s and a horned [[helmet]].",
        "Possessions": "The barbarian wielded a ''[[thunder club]]'' that caused earthquakes",
        "Abilities": "Very strong,",
        "History": {
            "The Victims of Tiamat": "Living long before the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Bobby was among a band of young adventurers who were all trying to find a way back to their distant home. Rumors claimed he also had a pet miniature unicorn. However, it was said they were all slain horribly by [[Tiamat]], with the barbarian and his unicorn both being swallowed by one of her heads. By [[1369 DR]], the [[Adventurer Mart]] in [[Athkatla]], [[Amn]], displayed paintings of Hank and Bobby.",
            "The Grand Tour of the Realms": "In the 1360s DR, Bobby and his friends (no unicorn in sight) made their way to the town of [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]] in [[Faerûn]] so that Presto could ask the great sage [[Elminster]] to take him on as an apprentice. While drinking in the [[Old Skull Inn]], they spotted Elminster arrive. When Presto lost his nerve, Bobby pointed out that Elminster wasn't busy and stood beside him to declare his friend's suitability.{{Cite comic/Forgotten Realms: The Grand Tour}}\n\nThus, Elminster whisked Presto away on a whirlwind tour of the Realms, and he came back traumatized and beaten and decided it best not to be his apprentice. Nevertheless, Presto had ideas for future adventures with his friends.\n\nAt this time, he was middle-aged. Moreover, Bobby had grown to be the largest of his group in both height and width. He became extremely muscular and his hair significantly had darkened from blonde to brown. Much of his apparel remained the same.",
            "The High Sun Games": "In the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Bobby and his friends, all adults now and without unicorn, were one of six teams competing in the [[High Sun Games]] in the newly built [[Neverwinter arena|arena]] in [[Neverwinter]]. They evaded the [[displacer beast]] and Bobby found a [[battleaxe]] in one of the chests. They even got to the center of the maze and safely inside the sanctuary cage at the end, winning that round. However, the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Sofina]] used the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'' above the arena soon after, so their fate is unknown.<ref>{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}<ref group=\"note\">After reaching the cage, the cartoon characters are not seen again. The ''beckoning death'' smoke later engulfs their position in the arena, but it is likely they left before this. Their purpose for competing is also unknown, but they may also have been trying to stop Forge and Sofina.",
            "Went to Waterdeep": "Aged only 9, Bobby and friends were camping in a forest one night when the Dungeon Master arrived to check on them, soon abandoning them again with promises of finding snacks, such as the spicy fried [[potato]]es they liked. Hank grew annoyed at this and their lack of progress on getting back to Earth; he had a new plan, but Bobby and the others were tired and were accepting their new life. But then [[drider]]s and [[darkmantle]]s ambushed them, and they fought their way out and into a mysterious ''[[portal]]'' that opened. It dumped them from a height into the streets of [[Waterdeep]], now in daytime and autumn. They were met by a girl who was pleased her spell had worked.\n{{Sectstub}}",
            "Now in Neverwinter": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Bobby was an adventuring adult, accompanied by fully matured Uni. The duo found themselves joining adventurers of [[Neverwinter]] in defense of kindly folk of Faerûn ''circa'' [[1479 DR]]."
