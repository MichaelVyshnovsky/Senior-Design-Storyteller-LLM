        "mainbody": "'''Withegroo Seian'Doo''' was a [[wizard]] who lived in [[Shallows]], where he had his own tower. He founded and led the hamlet.",
        "Description": "Withegroo looked old and had a white beard. He had a wrinkly face, large ears, and a hawk-like nose. His white hair was unkempt. He stood over 6 feet (1.83 meters) tall. He wore red robes with gold stars (similar to the pennant hanging from his tower) and a pointy hat.",
        "History": "Withegroo made a name and a fortune for himself by adventuring in caves and fighting creatures. He used the money to build himself a tower, and it gradually turned into a town as more and more people came to live in safe proximity.\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], during the [[orc]] and [[frost giant]] attack on Shallows, Withegroo was hit by a hurled boulder while on top of his tower, and was seriously injured. Fortunately, he was healed by the dwarven [[cleric]] [[Rockbottom]].{{cite book/The Thousand Orcs/MMP|329}}\n\nUltimately, Withegroo fell, when a horde of orcs and [[worg]]s came charging into the town. His final act was to cast a ''[[fireball]]'', blasting some of the orcs and stopping the charge, but the exertion cost him dearly. He managed a smile as he launched his devastating bomb, then he looked at Catti-brie and winked. He fell over dead giving into his injuries.{{cite book/The Thousand Orcs/MMP|?|28}}"
