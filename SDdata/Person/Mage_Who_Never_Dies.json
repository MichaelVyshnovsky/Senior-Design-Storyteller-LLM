This included the duskwood forests at its southern edge and the Mages Tower, with the village of Tavilar lying at the southern border.\nSome folk in Ylraphon rumored that certain evil groups and orcs, who regularly stocked up on supplies in Ylraphon before venturing into the Flooded Forest, served the Mage Who Never Dies."
