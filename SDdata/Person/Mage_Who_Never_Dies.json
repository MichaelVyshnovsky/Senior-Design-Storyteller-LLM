        "mainbody": "The '''Mage Who Never Dies''' was the mysterious master of the [[Flooded Forest]] in [[the Vast]] and the [[Moonsea]] regions of [[north Faer√ªn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The title was given by folk around [[Ylraphon]], but whoever or whatever this being was remained unknown.\n\nThe Mage Who Never Dies was said to have claimed the southern part of the Flooded Forest as his domain ''circa'' [[1370 DR]]. This included the [[duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] forests at its southern edge and the [[Mage's Tower]], with the village of [[Tavilar]] lying at the southern border.\n\nSome folk in Ylraphon rumored that certain evil groups and [[orc]]s, who regularly stocked up on supplies in Ylraphon before venturing into the Flooded Forest, served the Mage Who Never Dies."
