'''Autton Shadowshroud''' was a male [[elf|elven]] [[assassin]] and a member of the [[Shadowkind]] [[assassin guild]] based in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] in the 1360s [[DR]].

==Description==
Autton was 5 feet and 2 inches (1.57 meters) tall and weighed only 120 pounds (56 kilograms). However, Autton was surprisingly strong for his thin and small frame. As one of the Shadowkind, he dyed his naturally blond, short hair black. His eyes were almond in color, and displayed his intellect and cruelty.

==Abilities==
Autton was a capable fighter and a stealthy assassin.

==Possessions==
Autton wore [[leather armor]] and wielded a [[shortsword]], a half-dozen [[dagger]]s, and a [[shortbow]]. He used [[poison]] on his weapons.

==History==
When [[Calispar Delgorth]], a [[Talona]]n priest and member of the [[Vipers]] bandits, offered to demonstrate his magic-resistant poison for the Shadowkind, Autton Shadowshroud was sent to represent the guild and oversee the test. On the 28th [[Eleasias]] in [[1369 DR|the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], Autton met with Calispar near [[Brynwood]] and was taken to the [[Vipers' Nest]]. On the 1st of [[Eleint]], the pair slipped into [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]] to poison a well, killing a few villagers and sickening more. The local priests of [[Tymora]] found that their magic could do nothing to identify or cure the poison.

The experiment a success, Autton and Calispar returned to the Vipers' Nest to concoct more of the magic-resistant poison. However, Calispar could not make it lethal enough for the Shadowkind's purposes. Therefore he worked long and hard under Autton's gaze over the next few days to refine a more potent version.
