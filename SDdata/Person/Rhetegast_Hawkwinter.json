        "mainbody": "hetegast Hawkwinter, who went by Rhett, was a half-elf paladin of Torm and young noble of Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the , Rhett was a low-ranking Waterdavian guardsman assigned to man the blockade Waterdeep maintained around Luskan to keep the Fury plague from spreading. He met Kalen Dren as Kalen was attempting to enter the Cliffside Cranny gate. After a brief battle, Kalen subdued the guardsmen and left his powerful broadsword Vindicator with Rhett.\nSurprisingly, Rhett was able to wield the sword and later tracked down Kalen in Luskan with the intent of becoming Kalens apprentice. The two were attacked and captured by the Dead Rats gang and taken back to the gangs headquarters. There, Rhett met Myrin Darkdance and Kalen assigned Rhett to guard her, though it was unlikely the powerful mage needed a bodyguard.\nRhett tagged along with Kalen and Myrin on several forays into Luskan to investigate the Fury plague infecting the city. Rhett helped defeat Scour, the demon who was the cause of the plague.\nMyrin shadow-walked with Rhett to Westgate so Rhett could train with Levia Shadewalker at the Eye of Justice, although Myrin returned to Luskan. While in Westgate, he met Lilten, who convinced him that Kalen had lost his mind and intended to kill him.\nRhett assumed the mantle of Shadowbane and began crusading throughout the city. However, Rhett disagreed with Kalens methods and favored Tyr over the other aspects of the Threefold God and referred to himself as \"Mercy\".\nEarly in their relationship, Rhett idolized Kalen and wanted to be his apprentice although Kalen refused.  During his time in Westgate, Rhett disapproved of Kalens lack of mercy but in the end reconciled with him.\nRhett was one of three crusaders who, as of 1480 DR, was able to wield Vindicator.\nWhile crusading, he dressed as Kalen with leather armor and a helm."
