Rodolpho Wianar was a nobleman and a cousin of Eles Wianar, the Lord of Arrabar.
In the Flamerule of the , Rodolpho attended his cousins lush annual festival - the Night of Ghosts. At some point during the celebration, the man snuck away into the palace gardens of Generon to have a romantic rendezvous with a lady. At the same time, three young scions of Arrabars noble houses, Adyan Mercatio, Horial Rohden, and Vambran Matrell, were playing around with Vambrans bejeweled crossbow, shooting at plantain fruits. One stay bolt missed the tree and embedded itself in Rodolphos chest, killing him. Eventually, the noblemans body was discovered by the mans paramour and friends, who were confronted by a masked assassin. The assassin shot at the guests and fled, pursued by the Municipal Guard of Arrabar. The assassins identity was not discovered - Xaphira Matrell, beloved aunt of Vambran Matrell. Xaphira was a mercenary commander and decided to take the fall, saving her family and her nephew. She fled the city, leaving the Lord of Arrabar to start a headhunt for the murderer of his family member.
Eleven years later, Xaphira Matrell returned to Arrabar to aid her family against a plot that was sure to ruin the family. She shared some vital information regarding Rodolpho Wianars death in the process. Vamrans stray bolt did not kill him. Someone stole several bolts from the young mans quiver and framed him. That became evident when Xaphira Matrell fled the guard. She was shot in the leg with the identical bolt that was retrieved from the dead nobleman. Rodolphos death was part of a bigger plan orchestrated by those who sought to plunge Arrabar into war.
