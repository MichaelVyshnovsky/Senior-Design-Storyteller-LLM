Dessaer was Lord of Elventree in Cormanthor.
Lord Dessaer was a tall half-elf with golden hair and pale skin with a faint bronze hue to it. He was well-muscled for a male, and he wore a breastplate of gleaming gold with noble accoutrements.
In 1372 DR, Dessaer, under the suggestion of his advisor Seyll Auzkovyn, offered welcome and protection to the drow outcasts Ryld Argith and Halisstra Melarn.
