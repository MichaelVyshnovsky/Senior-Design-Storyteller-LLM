        "mainbody": "'''Astragarl Hornwood''' was a renowned Mage of [[Elembar]], who lived in the 2{{nd}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Astragarl hailed from the city of Elembar that was destroyed in the {{YearlinkName|511}}. The city was part of a [[human]] kingdom of [[Delimbiyran]], located on the [[Sword Coast]]. Astragarl Hornwood became known as the Mage of Elembar by the {{YearlinkName|112}}. As a [[wizard]], Astragarl Hornwood tutored at least one apprentice in 112 DR, to whom he imparted knowledge of [[dragons]]. Notably, Astragarl agreed that the great wyrms were indeed magnificent creatures, as long as one observed them on a tapestry or from the great distance of several kingdoms away."
