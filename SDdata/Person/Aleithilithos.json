        "mainbody": "Aleithilithos was a great wyrm amethyst dragon and a thane of the gem dragon god Sardior.\nAleithilithos possessed all the common powers of amethyst dragons and was a master of psionics, focusing on psychokinesis. In particular, he knew the powers detection of good or evil, detection of magic, dimension walk, energy control, and  object reading and all the psionic attacks (mind thrust, ego whip, id insinuation, psychic crush, mind blast) and defenses (empty mind, thought shield, mental barrier, intellect fortress, tower of iron will).\nAs a thane, Aleithilithos had a continuous mental contact with Sardior and could be used for his remote viewing, though he could choose to block it.\nAleithilithos and the other thanes normally resided within Sardiors Ruby Palace as part of his court, but on occasion would wander a world of the material plane alone. Creatures that earned his favor might be rewarded with gems, or sometimes some other gift or favor. He represented a certain facet of Sardiors personality.\nOn worlds where Sardior was worshiped, some 10% of later temples to him were dedicated to Aleithilithos. At these temples, lesser in size and overlooked places, Aleithilithos was revered by the faithful and served as the messenger and conduit of their faith. They attracted psions specializing in psychokinesis. There were also small shrines alongside major Sardioran churches in larger cities. However, aleithian dwarves dedicated their temples specifically to Aleithilithos.\nAleithilithos served Sardior as his thane, alongside fellow thanes the crystal dragon Hrodel, the emerald dragon Smargad, the sapphire dragon Charisma, the topaz dragon Tithonnas, and the destroyed obsidian dragon Seradess.\nOnce, Aleithilithos was set a task by Sardior, and went deep underground of some world to contemplate it. Eventually, he was interrupted when a dig team of the deep dwarves of Rokehold inadvertently broke through into his temporary lair. They ran in fright, but Aleithilithos was only amused as he realized that, while he had not planned on company, they were the solution to his problem.\nAleithilithos made his proposal to Sardior, who accepted it and negotiated with the dwarf god Moradin with Dumathoin as an intermediary. Moradin permitted the Rokehold dwarves to serve Sardior as his caretakers. Sardior paid Moradin back with a few secrets of his foes. Agents of Sardior granted the Rokehold dwarves a portal to the Demiplane of Ectoplasm and training in constructing stable mines there, the use of ectoplasm, and cutting crystals. In exchange, the dwarves were expected to defend the demiplane against trespassers. The Rokehold dwarves explored and mined the demiplane eagerly.\nIn the centuries that followed, the Rokehold dwarves dug an extensive tunnel network in the Demiplane of Ectoplasm, but grew more apart from their kind. Meanwhile, their physiology adapted to suit their environment and acquired innate psionic talents. This was Sardiors influence via Aleithilithos and they worshiped Aleithilithos directly. Thus they became the aleithian dwarves, after Aleithilithos.\nEventually, some time in the mid-to-late 12 century DR, by Toril time, Aleithilithos returned to the Rokehold. He commended the dwarves for their work, gave them some additional instruction, and sealed the portal, while advising them to ready themselves for a return to the surface, where their new gifts would soon be needed. They began a migration to the surface of their world and to meet other races."
