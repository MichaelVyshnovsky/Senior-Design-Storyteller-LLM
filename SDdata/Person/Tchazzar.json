        "mainbody": "During the [[Time of Troubles]], 340 years later, [[Tiamat]] was killed by [[Gilgeam]] but her divinity was split into 3 pieces, each of which came to inhabit a [[chromatic dragon]]. Tchazzar was one of those dragons and, since he still had Chessentans that revered him as a god, he finally ascended to godhood. However, it was still Tiamat's essence within him and it compelled him to seek out the other two pieces of her divinity. With his new deific powers, Tchazzar easily found and slew the other two dragons, [[Gestaniius]] and [[Skuthosiin]] \"the Venomous\". The divine 'trinity' of Tiamat was once more as one. An avatar of Tiamat promptly formed and ate Tchazzar before she left to continue her war with Gilgeam.\n\nHowever, this was not the end of Tchazzar. During the last days of the [[Rage of Dragons]], Tchazzar was resurrected by Tiamat and he materialized over the bay of Chessenta in the midst of a naval battle between the cities of [[Cimbar]] and [[Soorenar]]. Consumed by the rage and in a state of shock, he nearly destroyed both fleets before regaining some self-control. He flew off to drive out or destroy all of the [[Dracolich]]es in Chessenta before forcefully installing himself as [[Sceptenar]] of Cimbar in [[1373 DR]].\n\n===Spellplague===\nTchazzar was traveling through the Sky Rider mountains in Threskel when the Spellplague manifested.  He was hit by a wave of blue fire and accidentally traveled through a rift to the [[Shadowfell]].  He was wounded by the blue fire and was subdued by a blight wyrm named [[Sseelrigoth]] who fed on his essence for nearly 100 years. \n\n===Post-Spellplague===\nin [[1479 DR]] two members of the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] rescued Tchazzar who then destroyed Sseelrigoth and returned in triumph to [[Luthcheq]] in Chessenta and claimed the kingdom as his own.   When Threskelan forces loyal to [[Alasklerbanbastos]] invaded Chessenta, Tchazzar was slow to react, preferring to remain in Luthcheq at his court.  [[Aoth Fezim]] finally prevailed on Tchazzar to fly to [[Soolabax]] to lead his army against the Threskelan troops.  Tchazzar was slow to enter the battle and only attacked when it appeared his army would lose the battle unless he participated.  He killed several lesser wyrms and routed the Threskelan army.\n\nPrior to the second battle in the war, Alasklerbanbastos's lieutenant [[Jaxanaedegor]] entered into an agreement with Tchazzar to switch sides during the expected combat between Alasklerbanbastos and Tchazzar.  During the battle, Jaxanaedegor entered the fight only when it was obvious Tchazzar would win.  Tchazzar defeated Alasklerbanbastos and destroyed his physical form although not his [[phylactery]].  After the victory, Tchazzar made Threskel a vassal state.\n\nIn 1479 DR Tchazzar raised an army to attack [[Tymanther]] with his allies from [[Akanûl]].  However, [[Aoth Fezim]] and other members of the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] convinced Akanûl to withdraw from the war and enlisted [[High Imaskar]] to fight on Tymanther's side.  Even though the loss of an allied army and the entry of a powerful new adversary would have caused most generals to abandon the planned invasion, Tchazzar wanted to continue.  Before he could march his army to Tymanther, Alasklerbanbastos contacted Tchazzar through magical means and explained the Brotherhood's manipulations.  This sent Tchazzar into a rage and he attacked the Brotherhood's forces which started the [[Battle of Luthcheq]].\t\n\nDuring the battle Alasklerbanbastos temporarily allied with Tchazzar and the two were about to rout the combined Chessentan, Akanûlan and Brotherhood of the Griffon forces.  [[Jhesrhi Coldcreek]] was able to channel the elemental fire she had infused into Tchazzar in the Shadowfell and this weakened Tchazzar so much that [[Shala Karanok]] was able to kill him.\n\n===Post-Second Sundering===\nSome time after the [[Second Sundering]], a new incarnation of Tchazzar was ruling the city of [[Erebos]].",
        "Appearance": "Despite his age, Tchazzar had the vigor of a red dragon in its prime. His scales were as bright as a [[wyrmling|wyrmling's]] except along his wings where they were black as obsidian. His eyes and horns were completely black and the horns themselves were sharp and serrated.\n\nIn human form Tchazzar was a large, handsome man with an angular face and slightly pointed ears.  He had yellow eyes and flawless white teeth.",
        "Personality": "Tchazzar was a force of pure chaos and evil. He was convinced of his superiority over all living things, even more so than a typical red dragon. He cared not for his subjects or allies except as expendable resources, but at the same time made efforts to ensure their loyalty.\n\nAfter his return to [[Chessenta]] in [[1479 DR]] Tchazzar behaved extremely erratically.  It's unknown whether his madness was caused by his imprisonment in the Shadowfell or if his participation in [[Xorvintaal]] was responsible.  At times he was gracious to his subjects but he often brutally punished subordinates for real or imagined transgressions.  He asked the high priest of [[Amaunator]] to hold the sun in the sky twenty-four hours of the day and when the priest balked he threw him from the top of the palace.",
        "History": {
            "Early Life": "Little is known about Tchazzar's life until he began on the path to godhood, only that his father was [[Rauthstokh \"Redbones\"|Rauthstokh]], an old red wyrm who died well before his son matured.",
            "First Kingdom": "In [[929 DR]] he forged an alliance between several [[Chessenta]]n cities and led them in a rebellion against [[Unther]]. The rebellion was successful and Chessenta seceded from Unther to form its own nation that still existed for centuries (albeit, in a fractured form at times).\n\nHe was crowned king, setting up a temple to himself in an effort to achieve his ultimate goal of divinity. In [[1018 DR]] he rode alone to battle with raiding [[Sahuagin]] but his body was never found. Tchazzar had actually retaken his true form, slain the Sahuagin and sent visions of himself standing atop a pile of their corpses to the throne and council chambers of all Chessentan cities, telling his subjects that he'd \"won his greatest victory\". This inspired Chessentans into greater religious fervor for him, ensuring that the church of Tchazzar remained intact, even while his empire fractured without his leadership over the next decade.",

        "Divinity": "Although Tchazzar was unquestionably divine when he was Tiamat's Chosen, his divine status as of [[1479 DR]] was uncertain. Since his return he did not show any abilities other than those an ancient red wyrm would be expected to possess.  Tchazzar was unable to defeat Alasklerbanbastos in single combat without aid from his followers.  He proclaimed himself a god but did not grant spells to his priests.  In fact, Tiamat's priests performed the clerical functions in his cult."
