        "mainbody": "During the Time of Troubles, 340 years later, Tiamat was killed by Gilgeam but her divinity was split into 3 pieces, each of which came to inhabit a chromatic dragon. Tchazzar was one of those dragons and, since he still had Chessentans that revered him as a god, he finally ascended to godhood. However, it was still Tiamats essence within him and it compelled him to seek out the other two pieces of her divinity. With his new deific powers, Tchazzar easily found and slew the other two dragons, Gestaniius and Skuthosiin \"the Venomous\". The divine trinity of Tiamat was once more as one. An avatar of Tiamat promptly formed and ate Tchazzar before she left to continue her war with Gilgeam.\nHowever, this was not the end of Tchazzar. During the last days of the Rage of Dragons, Tchazzar was resurrected by Tiamat and he materialized over the bay of Chessenta in the midst of a naval battle between the cities of Cimbar and Soorenar. Consumed by the rage and in a state of shock, he nearly destroyed both fleets before regaining some self-control. He flew off to drive out or destroy all of the Dracoliches in Chessenta before forcefully installing himself as Sceptenar of Cimbar in 1373 DR.\nTchazzar was traveling through the Sky Rider mountains in Threskel when the Spellplague manifested.  He was hit by a wave of blue fire and accidentally traveled through a rift to the Shadowfell.  He was wounded by the blue fire and was subdued by a blight wyrm named Sseelrigoth who fed on his essence for nearly 100 years. \nin 1479 DR two members of the Brotherhood of the Griffon rescued Tchazzar who then destroyed Sseelrigoth and returned in triumph to Luthcheq in Chessenta and claimed the kingdom as his own.   When Threskelan forces loyal to Alasklerbanbastos invaded Chessenta, Tchazzar was slow to react, preferring to remain in Luthcheq at his court.  Aoth Fezim finally prevailed on Tchazzar to fly to Soolabax to lead his army against the Threskelan troops.  Tchazzar was slow to enter the battle and only attacked when it appeared his army would lose the battle unless he participated.  He killed several lesser wyrms and routed the Threskelan army.\nPrior to the second battle in the war, Alasklerbanbastoss lieutenant Jaxanaedegor entered into an agreement with Tchazzar to switch sides during the expected combat between Alasklerbanbastos and Tchazzar.  During the battle, Jaxanaedegor entered the fight only when it was obvious Tchazzar would win.  Tchazzar defeated Alasklerbanbastos and destroyed his physical form although not his phylactery.  After the victory, Tchazzar made Threskel a vassal state.\nIn 1479 DR Tchazzar raised an army to attack Tymanther with his allies from Akanûl.  However, Aoth Fezim and other members of the Brotherhood of the Griffon convinced Akanûl to withdraw from the war and enlisted High Imaskar to fight on Tymanthers side.  Even though the loss of an allied army and the entry of a powerful new adversary would have caused most generals to abandon the planned invasion, Tchazzar wanted to continue.  Before he could march his army to Tymanther, Alasklerbanbastos contacted Tchazzar through magical means and explained the Brotherhoods manipulations.  This sent Tchazzar into a rage and he attacked the Brotherhoods forces which started the Battle of Luthcheq.\t\nDuring the battle Alasklerbanbastos temporarily allied with Tchazzar and the two were about to rout the combined Chessentan, Akanûlan and Brotherhood of the Griffon forces.  Jhesrhi Coldcreek was able to channel the elemental fire she had infused into Tchazzar in the Shadowfell and this weakened Tchazzar so much that Shala Karanok was able to kill him.\nSome time after the Second Sundering, a new incarnation of Tchazzar was ruling the city of Erebos.\nAlthough Tchazzar was unquestionably divine when he was Tiamats Chosen, his divine status as of 1479 DR was uncertain. Since his return he did not show any abilities other than those an ancient red wyrm would be expected to possess.  Tchazzar was unable to defeat Alasklerbanbastos in single combat without aid from his followers.  He proclaimed himself a god but did not grant spells to his priests.  In fact, Tiamats priests performed the clerical functions in his cult."
