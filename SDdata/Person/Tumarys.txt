'''Tumarys''' was a [[half-elf]] [[druid]] of [[Chauntea]] inhabiting [[Zhentil Keep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Tumarys was tasked to convert the land surrounding Zhentil Keep into farmland. He was aided by a group of protective forest creatures including a large [[bear]], a pair of [[griffon]]s, a [[stag]], a pack of [[wolves]], and a [[pegasus]]. These creatures could be summoned in a moment's notice if Tumarys blew a small wooden whistle.

His home was located behind a stand of trees just south of the [[Tesh Trail]] outside of the [[River Trail Gate]] of the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]].
