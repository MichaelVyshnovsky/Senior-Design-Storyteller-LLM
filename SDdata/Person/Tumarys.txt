Tumarys was a half-elf druid of Chauntea inhabiting Zhentil Keep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Tumarys was tasked to convert the land surrounding Zhentil Keep into farmland. He was aided by a group of protective forest creatures including a large bear, a pair of griffons, a stag, a pack of wolves, and a pegasus. These creatures could be summoned in a moments notice if Tumarys blew a small wooden whistle.
His home was located behind a stand of trees just south of the Tesh Trail outside of the River Trail Gate of the Foreign Quarter.
