Soluun Xibrindas () was one of the top agents of Bregan Daerthe in Waterdeep during the early 1490s DR.
Soluun, together with Felrekt Lafeen and Krebbyg Masqilyr, was tasked by Jarlaxle with carrying out dirty deeds in the city. At night, Soluuns hobby was killing solitary elves and half-elves in the Dock Ward.
The familys house was destroyed and only Soluun and his younger brother Narl survived. They decided to join Bregan Daerthe.
Soluun was a fanatical bully totally loyal to Bregan Daerthe and Jarlaxle. He considered his brother weak for his decision to study magic. From his earliest days, he hated surface elves and half-elves and when he had free time outside his missions Soluun always tried to kill some solitary elvish individuals.
Like his fellows Felrekt and Krebbyg, Soluun was equipped with Lantanese firearms.
