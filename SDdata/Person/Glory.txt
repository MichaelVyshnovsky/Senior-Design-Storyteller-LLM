Glory was a tiefling psionicist who was employed by the merchant clan House Serrat for security.  Her primary duty was to erase the memories of the clans terazul harvesters so that the familys rivals could not learn the location of the plants.
Glory had red skin and purple hair and was considered shapely.  She smoked a pipe.
Glory had the ability to read most minds and was able to wipe the memory of those she encountered.  Her ability to wipe memories often resulted in comical situations such as when people would bump into her wagon because they couldnt remember where it was located.
Glory was easy going but inherently lazy, preferring to work only when she had to.
Glory was with the Serrat caravan in the jungles south of Delzimmer when Zaltys Serrat, adopted daughter of one of the clans leaders, ventured into the Underdark in search of her long-lost tribe.  Glory elected to remain behind on the surface because she was worried that some denizens of the Underdark such as mind flayers would be attracted to her psionic energy.
