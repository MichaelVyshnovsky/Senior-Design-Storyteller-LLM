'''Glory''' was a [[tiefling]] [[psionics|psionicist]] who was employed by the merchant clan [[House Serrat]] for security.  Her primary duty was to erase the memories of the clan's [[terazul]] harvesters so that the family's rivals could not learn the location of the plants.

==Description==
Glory had red skin and purple hair{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|404}} and was considered shapely.  She smoked a pipe.

==Abilities==
Glory had the ability to read most minds and was able to wipe the memory of those she encountered.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|409}}  Her ability to wipe memories often resulted in comical situations such as when people would bump into her wagon because they couldn't remember where it was located.

==Personality==
Glory was easy going but inherently lazy, preferring to work only when she had to.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|697}}

==History==
Glory was with the Serrat caravan in the jungles south of [[Delzimmer]] when [[Zaltys Serrat]], adopted daughter of one of the clan's leaders, ventured into the [[Underdark]] in search of her long-lost tribe.  Glory elected to remain behind on the surface because she was worried that some denizens of the Underdark such as [[mind flayer]]s would be attracted to her psionic energy.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|1610}}
