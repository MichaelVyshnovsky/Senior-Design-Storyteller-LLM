        "mainbody": "'''Thaalim Torchtower''' was a renegade [[Cormyr]]ean soldier turned bandit leader, warlord, and self-stylized king of the [[Tun Marshes]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Precipitating his rise to lawlessness was the slaying of a fellow Cormyrean soldier, of which he was found guilty and condemned to death if ever he was caught.\n\nIn [[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Torchtower rose to power as a bandit leader in the [[Tunlands]]. Rumors spread that he had spies and agents throughout the Forest Kingdom of Cormyr and the [[Dragon Coast]], but that was only true for the town of [[Eagle Peak]]. While snooping around the lair of the [[black dragon]] [[Skurge]], he found and stole an egg, putting it in temporal stasis with a [[scroll]]. This allowed him to form an uneasy truce with the dragon so long as her egg remained within his fortress.\n\nIn [[Tarsakh]] of [[1367 DR]], the [[Zhentarim]], who had taken over [[Darkhold]] five decades prior, set about training and directing the Tunlanders to raid the interior of Cormyr. In response, Cormyrian forces from [[High Horn (hold)|High Horn]] raided the Tunlands. The warlord's youngest son died in these raids and Torchtower vowed revenge against King [[Azoun IV]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/Thaalim Torchtower}}\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], he was still in power and was referred to as Lord Thaalim Torchtower.",
        "Allies": "Torchtower had a bodyguard of loyal [[human]], half-human, and [[humanoid]] warriors, as well as two renegade [[sorcerer]]s who assisted in battle and served as scryers and spymasters: [[Thylash]], a human male from [[Thay]], and [[Khyssaria]], a [[half-elf]] woman.\n\nHe also allied himself with Skurge and the other [[Tun bandits]], although it was a tenuous alliance at best. He was still seen as an outlander, albeit one who knew their ways and had brought prosperity."
