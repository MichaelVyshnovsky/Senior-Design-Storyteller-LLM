        "Description": "Rugger was a [[gold dwarf]] with luscious head of pampered brown hair, clean-shaven face, double chin, and hazel eyes.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, shortly before the armies of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] attacked the city of Baldur's Gate, Lord Rugger Shattershield was a Parliamentarian of the Gate who voted in support of crowning lowborn Lord [[Enver Gortash]] as the city's Archduke. Rugger Shattershield was present for Gortash's coronation that took place in the audience hall of [[Wyrm's Rock]]. Following the coronation, he proudly supported the Archduke's steen constructs and the safety they brought in face of a looming war. In a conversation with [[Alia Durinbold]], Rugger stated that the steel watchers and the [[Flaming Fist]]s needed to be in the same chain of command under the same commander â€“ Lord Enver Gortash."
