He worked as an instructor specializing in melee weapon combat and assisted instructors Herban and [[Hewwet]]. He usually sparred with the students of the Academy and conducted combat trials.\n\nDendy harbored hopes of crossing paths with [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]] at the graduation ceremonies, but his life was ended in the attack on the Academy."
