==Relationships==
He was a member of the [[Zhentarim]].

==History==
Deverel Rinthar was known to have joined the caravan carrying [[Shandril Shessair]] from [[Scornubel]] to [[Waterdeep]] in late {{yearlink|1357}}. Through the trip, he pretended to be a dealer in exotic [[cheese]]s from [[Elturel]].

During the final ambush the caravan faced, [[Hlael Toraunt]] thought to seek aid in capturing Shandril Shessair from Deverel's blades, and so, he went to his cart, announcing himself as Deverel, Master Rinthar's cousin, sent by [[Manshoon]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|330|19}}
