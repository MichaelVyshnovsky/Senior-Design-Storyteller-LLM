'''Charthraxis''' was a [[green dragon]] that dwelled in the region of the [[Sword Coast North]] that had an association with the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was known for having a particularly bad temper.

==History==
In the 1480s [[DR]], dragon cultists began operating in the [[Neverwinter/Neverdeath|Neverdeath]] graveyard in [[Neverwinter]]. They managed to convince Charthraxis to attack the city's graveyard, an effort that was rebuffed by adventurers hired by [[Windle]] and the [[Harpers]].
