Vaelam was a Sharran faithful during the mid-8 century DR.
He was rather dense, having difficulty to recognize derision.
He was a bald man with purple and black robes, thin and soft-spoken.  He was also the second youngest of that team, after the death of Iyrindyl.
He looted a plethora of magic from Karsus Keep.
Vaelam was one of Elryns dreadspells. He was not greatly loyal in extreme situations.
As a dreadspell, he wielded borrowed arcane power.
Vaelam was one of the dreadspells sent with Elryn to find and slay a Chosen of Mystra near Westgate two tendays into the Chaos of the Art in the . During the first leg of the trip, Uldus Blackram lead the way. During the first leg of their trip, Uldus Blackram was killed by Ilbryn Starym, an elven wizard they chanced upon.
Once they found the ruin, Karsus Keep, Vaelam was the one who stumbled upon its method of access speaking the word "Karsus" while standing on a stone platform labeled "K", but which radiated no magic, activated a teleportation effect. Inside, he helped loot it of valuables, and tested a staff that hurled flame against some trees, most likely alerting the elf Starsunder across the continent. Once their looted magic failed against Azuth, despite bringing down the ruin, they fled.
When Dread Sister Klalaera appeared and herded them back against Azuth, they were stopped partway by Umbregard and Starsunder, two mages that appeared suddenly. During the battle, one of Starsunders spells destroyed him and Hrelgrath at the same time it blocked their spells.
