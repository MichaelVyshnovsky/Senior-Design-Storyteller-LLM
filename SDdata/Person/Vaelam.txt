'''Vaelam''' was a [[Shar]]ran faithful during the mid-8{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|What was the name of that mage in the legend, who defied the gods to steal all magic and become himself lord over all magic? Klar ... no, Karsus.|Vaelam, Dreadspell of [[Shar]], in the {{yearlinkName|767}}}}

==Personality==
He was rather dense, having difficulty to recognize derision.

==Description==
He was a bald man with purple and black robes,{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|692|16}} thin and soft-spoken.  He was also the second youngest of that team, after the death of [[Iyrindyl]].

==Possessions==
He looted a plethora of magic from [[Karsus' Keep]].

==Relationships==
Vaelam was one of [[Elryn]]'s dreadspells. He was not greatly loyal in extreme situations.

==Abilities==
As a dreadspell, he wielded borrowed arcane power.

==History==
Vaelam was one of the dreadspells sent with [[Elryn]] to find and slay a [[Chosen of Mystra]] near [[Westgate]] two tendays into the Chaos of [[the Art]] in the {{yearlinkName|767}}. During the first leg of the trip, [[Uldus Blackram]] lead the way. During the first leg of their trip, Uldus Blackram was killed by [[Ilbryn Starym]], an [[elven]] [[wizard]] they chanced upon.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|696-698|17}}

Once they found the ruin, Karsus' Keep, Vaelam was the one who stumbled upon its method of access: speaking the word "Karsus" while standing on a stone platform labeled "K", but which radiated no magic, activated a teleportation effect. Inside, he helped loot it of valuables, and tested a staff that hurled flame against some trees, most likely alerting the [[elf]] [[Starsunder]] across the continent.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|725-726|19}} Once their looted magic failed against Azuth, despite bringing down the ruin, they fled.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|730-731|19}}

When Dread Sister [[Klalaera]] appeared and herded them back against Azuth, they were stopped partway by [[Umbregard]] and [[Starsunder]], two mages that appeared suddenly. During the battle, one of Starsunder's spells destroyed him and [[Hrelgrath]] at the same time it blocked their spells.
