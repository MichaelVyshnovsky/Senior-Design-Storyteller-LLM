'''Rydah the Storm Soother''' ({{Pronounce|RY|duh|refs={{Cite adventurers league/The Drowned Tower|31}}}}) was the high priestess of [[Umberlee]] in [[Mulmaster]].

==Personality==
Rydah was a cunning and cool-headed individual. Despite not being violent herself, she believed that the last resort was should always be violence. With that method, she protected herself and Umberlee's position in the city.

==History==
Rydah rose through the ranks of the local [[Church of Umberlee]] with a combination of politics and force. At last, she killed the previous high priest in a duel on the docks.

In [[1491 DR]], she was concerned by [[Drayson Fivestars]]'s preaching to devotees of her church. She hoped to find someone to stop him.{{Cite adventurers league/The Drowned Tower|5}}
