        "mainbody": "Xenix the Occluded was an elderly beholder eye tyrant of Ooltul and an innkeeper in 1370 DR.\nXenix, like its fellow beholders, hated non-beholder strangers. Only the orders of the Triumvirate forced Xenix to deal with visitors. Usually, Xenix followed the most rapid and violent resolutions to problems and left much of the care of guests to its goblin slaves.\nAged and rheumy-eyed, having lost the use of most or all of his powers, Xenix adapted to act as an innkeeper. Its inn, the Severed Stalk, was a relativity good place for sojourn in Ooltul, although it was recommended that guests erect their own personal magical wards before going to sleep."
