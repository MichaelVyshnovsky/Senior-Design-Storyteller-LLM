        "mainbody": "'''Xenix the Occluded''' was an elderly [[beholder]] eye tyrant of [[Ooltul]] and an innkeeper in [[1370 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Xenix, like its fellow beholders, hated non-beholder strangers. Only the orders of the [[Triumvirate]] forced Xenix to deal with visitors. Usually, Xenix followed the most rapid and violent resolutions to problems and left much of the care of guests to its [[goblin]] slaves.",
        "Activities": "Aged and rheumy-eyed, having lost the use of most or all of his powers, Xenix adapted to act as an innkeeper. Its inn, the [[Severed Stalk]], was a relativity good place for sojourn in Ooltul, although it was recommended that guests erect their own personal magical wards before going to sleep."
