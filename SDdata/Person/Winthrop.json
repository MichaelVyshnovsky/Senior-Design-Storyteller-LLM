        "mainbody": "Winthrop was the innkeep of the Candlekeep Inn in the 1360s DR. He was known for his good-humored nature and frequent jests.\nBy 1368 DR, Winthrop appeared as a portly man, and was considered old by Candlekeeps youth. He had a noticeable Northern accent.\nWinthrop had a pleasant manner, even if his frequent jokes often bordered on the crude. He showed great pride in his inn, claiming it was \"as clean as an elven arse\", and that its rooms were \"the best on the Sword Coast.\" He had a personal dislike for mercenaries. Winthrops prices were considered fair, and he did his best to keep them as low as possible.\nWinthrops adopted daughter, the Bhaalspawn Imoen, helped Winthrop run his inn by performing various chores, much to her annoyance. She referred to the innkeep as \"Old Puffguts\", which in turn annoyed him.\nWinthrop felt the sage Gorion was too stiff for his liking.\nWinthrop adopted Imoen in Baldurs Gate, after her mother died during childbirth. Together they traveled to Candlekeep, where Winthrop eventually began running the Candlekeep Inn.\nIn addition to running the inn, Winthrop sold various merchandise, including both weapons and armor. He kept a book with pictures of naked women in his room."
