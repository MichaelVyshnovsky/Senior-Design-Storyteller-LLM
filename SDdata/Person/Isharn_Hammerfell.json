        "mainbody": "'''Isharn Hammerfell''' was a young [[dwarf]] [[thief]] who lurked in the [[Warriors' Tomb]] in [[1358 DR]].",
        "Description": "The young dwarf had black scruffy hair and a beard. He wore [[splint mail]] that was fastened by a belt, a set of bracers, and leather [[boot]]s. Isharn carried three ''[[dagger]]s +1'' and an ''[[axe]] +2''.",
        "History": "Isharn was once affiliated with a party of adventurers, but they were overwhelmed by [[shadow]]s and slaughtered. His dwarf clan went to look for him, but were also unable to gain advantage against the monsters. Eventually, Isharn was the sole survivor, lurking and hiding around in the tomb. He was not beyond  stealing [[ration]]s from others. He believed he was justified in doing so, as he was not intent on stealing ''all'' of their food supplies. Thus, the other adventurers could remain alive to deal with the other monsters that inhabited the area."
