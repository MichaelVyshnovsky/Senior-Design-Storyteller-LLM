'''Opara Rendril''' was a [[human]] woman of the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]].

==History==
Around [[1358 DR]], Rendril was a well-known Procampan master metal-smith who crafted high-quality [[longsword]]s and helms, while her bracelets and belt-[[dagger]]s were famous around the [[Inner Sea]]. By [[1368 DR]], Rendril was the owner of [[Rendril's Forge]], and also an active [[Harper]] agent, though she remained based in Procampur.
