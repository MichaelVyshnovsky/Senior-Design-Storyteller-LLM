        "mainbody": "Teles Ahvoste was an archmage from Halruaa and one of the Great Readers that served Candlekeep during the late 15 century DR.\nBorn in the great magocracy of Halruaa in the Shining South, Teles has always maintained a strong understanding and familiarity with arcane magic. Because of this relationship, Teles has always been well aware of the inherent dangers that accompanied the use of magic.\nWhile Teles always thought of Halruaa as home, the learned sage always sought new opportunities to learn more about arcane secrets that were hidden within the world. The Great Reader believed that scholars of Faer√ªn were tasked by the gods to uncover these secrets.\nThe Great Reader was considered to be Candlekeeps foremost authority on arcane magic, with specific expertise in magical items, all manner of curses, and the Weave itself. While quite knowledgeable, Teles was prone to meander and blather a bit in conversation, in order to ensure every subject was explained just right."
