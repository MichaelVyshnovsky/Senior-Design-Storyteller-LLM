Lorthalae Shamrass was the High Whipmistress of the Ladys Hand Monastery, a temple of Loviatar on Ladypeak at the western end of the Nether Mountains.
Whipmistress Shamrass led her clergy of some 90 humans and half-elves against repeated attacks by monsters, the most prevalent of which were orcs. Even after her temple was ravaged by an attack from the Morueme blue dragons and their army of hobgoblins, in 1372 DR she persevered as their leader and vowed to rebuild.
