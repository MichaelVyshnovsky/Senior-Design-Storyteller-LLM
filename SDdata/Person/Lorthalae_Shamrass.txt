'''Lorthalae Shamrass''' was the [[High Whipmistress]] of the [[Lady's Hand Monastery]], a temple of [[Loviatar]] on [[Ladypeak]] at the western end of the [[Nether Mountains]].

==Activities==
Whipmistress Shamrass led her clergy of some 90 [[human]]s and [[half-elves]] against repeated attacks by monsters, the most prevalent of which were [[orc]]s. Even after her temple was ravaged by an attack from the [[Blood of Morueme|Morueme]] [[blue dragon]]s and their army of [[hobgoblin]]s, in [[1372 DR]] she persevered as their leader and vowed to rebuild.
