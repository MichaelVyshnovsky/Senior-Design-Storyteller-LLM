==Description==
Bailey was a rude [[human]] servant with an olive-hued skin tone, dark blue eyes, and a head of chestnut hair.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Chamberlain Mercer, the man in charge of Lady [[Firelia Jannath]]'s staff, dismissed all servants from the mansion on the mistress's orders. Mercer placed Bailey, who was tasked with shining [[silverware]], [[Furbleston]], [[Cyrilla]], [[Jooli]], [[Phubbs]], and Chef [[Marjoram (chef)|Marjoram]] on temporary leave with the pay of half-wages and allowance to seek temporary employment somewhere else. The chamberlain issued a statement that this dismissal was done at no imputation of malfeasance and would be ended upon notice.

Bailey May have had been fired for his attitude in 1492 DR.
