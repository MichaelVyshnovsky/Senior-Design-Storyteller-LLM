        "Personality": "He was a [[wine]] connoisseur and an attentive host to guests of the Crown. King [[Dhalmass Obarskyr|Dhalmass]] appreciated and took advantage of his discretion as a seneschal of the [[Castle Obarskyr|Palace]].",

        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1227}}, Elbryn was part of an escort sent by Dhalmass to ensure the safety and comfort of an important [[Sembia]]n trade representative on the road to [[Immersea]]. While camping for the night, a stolen pay-wagon—known to history as [[Waevor's Wagon]]—barrelled through the group without forerunners or lights. Elbryn and fellow noble [[Tharim Roaringhorn]] were both struck by the careening conveyance and died from their injuries."
