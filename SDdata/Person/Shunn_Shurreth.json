        "mainbody": "hunn Shurreth was a drow lieutenant of the Xanathar in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.\nShunn led the northern watchpost of the Xanathars Thieves Guild inside the Arcane Chambers.\nShunn angered a priestess of Lolth who cursed him and forced him into exile.\nIn 1492 DR, some wererats stole a key from the southern watch post and Shunn, believing the key unlocked something important, used his resources to reclaim it, by capturing and ransoming a wererat.\nShunn in time came to appreciate his curse that had gained him the favor of the Xanathar and intimidated his subordinates. He believed that removing the curse would weaken his position. In dealing with adventurers, he was always polite and diplomatic.\nShunn was a drow exile who was favored by the Xanathar.\nThe curse partially transformed Shunn into a spider, giving him eight red arachnid eyes, a mouth full of fangs, and black bristles sprouting from his slender limbs."
