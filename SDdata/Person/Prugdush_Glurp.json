He did not seem to be bothered by the sweltering heat of his forge.\nPrugdush Glurp had trouble differentiating warm-blooded humanoids from one another, calling them \"soft-skins\" and used his sense of smell as a reliable tool in dealing with land-dwellers.\nThe sahuagin blacksmith often joked about eating his customers, but in reality, it was explicitly forbidden for him to do by the priestesses of Umberlee in Spindrift Town. Prugdush was quite friendly otherwise.\nPrugdush Glurp was a blacksmith who created and sold a wide variety of armors and weapons. He also offered armor upgrades. His blacksmiths single-handedly outfitted the towns pirate fleet."
