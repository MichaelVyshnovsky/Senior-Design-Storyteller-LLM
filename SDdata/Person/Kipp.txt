Kipp was a boy in the village of West Harbor in the Mere of Dead Men on the Sword Coast North in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Kipp implied his father was a Shadow Thief from somewhere in the south (probably Amn). Kipps parents attempted to make their home in the swamp, but they were killed by lizardfolk. After this, Kipp went to live with Lannons, but he disliked all the rules, so he ran away.
He tried to survive by his wits, stealing whatever food and supplies he needed. He was known to sometimes steal things and throw acorns at militiamen on drill (Bevil Starling in particular).
He apparently owned two pet frogs among his many thefts were a set of basilisk eyelashes for them, which he "acquired" from Tarmass workshop. (It is unknown why the frogs needed eyelashes.)
