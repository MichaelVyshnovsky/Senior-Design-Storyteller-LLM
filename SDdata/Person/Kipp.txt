'''Kipp''' was a boy in the village of [[West Harbor]] in the [[Mere of Dead Men]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Kipp implied his father was a [[Shadow Thief]] from somewhere in the south (probably [[Amn]]). Kipp's parents attempted to make their home in the swamp, but they were killed by [[lizardfolk]]. After this, Kipp went to live with [[Pitney Lannon|Lannons]], but he disliked all the rules, so he ran away.

==Activities==
He tried to survive by his wits, stealing whatever food and supplies he needed. He was known to sometimes steal things and throw acorns at militiamen on drill ([[Bevil Starling]] in particular).

He apparently owned two pet [[frog]]s; among his many thefts were a set of [[basilisk]] eyelashes for them, which he "acquired" from [[Tarmas]]'s workshop. (It is unknown why the frogs needed eyelashes.)
