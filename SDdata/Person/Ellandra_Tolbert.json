        "mainbody": "Lady Doctor Ellandra Tolbert was a noblewoman and a famous necromancer-anatomist from the city of Waterdeep in the 14 century DR.\nEllandra was a paper-pale woman of short stature&mdashonly reaching  in height. Her thin hair was yellow, eyes hazel in color and framed by long yellow eyelashes. The necromancers hands were thin and delicate, ending in queerly-long fingernails that she often clacked on surfaces when nervous or impatient.\nShe was a beautiful yet insecure person. Ellandra wore long-sleeved Calishite wizardly robes that covered most of her skin. Ellandra always carried a black leather shoulder bag in which she carried her medical tools.\nAs the only heir to the Tolbert familys wealth, Ellandra behaved as a true aristocrat supercilious and demanding. Ellandra expected everyone to cater to her every wish because of her wealth. However, she was lonely and deeply saddened by the tragedies of her life. She brought memories of her husband and father up every opportunity and reveled in the misery. Ellandra also loved compliments and flattery.\nDespite all her personality traits, she was neither evil nor malicious. The many tragedies simply colored her life with sadness. She was generous with her allies and those she was attempting to befriend, and she was known to show interest in the patronage of adventurers and touring of novice mages, especially those who reminded Ellandra of her husband.\nEllandra Tolbert was a highly skilled surgeon and doctor. She performed surgeries on the living to gain allies and respect, not because she cared for healing and medicine. Ellandra Tolbert was extremely knowledgeable in all forms of medicine, herbalism, and anatomy, trained in etiquette, heraldry, and knew elvish and dwarvish languages. She was a talented spellcaster and  possessed knowledge of spirit lore and poisons.\nAt all times, Ellandra had the contingency spell active that activated a fire shield is she suffered any type of physical attack. Her spellbook contained a wealth of spells, not exclusively of the necromancy school of magic. Some of the more exotic spells known to the woman were living link, delay death, false face, iron mind, wizard sight, brainkill, empathic wound transfer, summon spirit, bone growth, graft flesh, throbbing bones, and transmute steel to bone, some of which were of her own invention.\nThe woman was an accomplished necromancer who wore bracers of defense, a greater bone ring, a pearl of power set in a platinum necklace, and an amulet of life protection to protect herself. Among offensive items, Ellandra carried a wand of paralyzation, and an enchanted +2 hornblade dagger.\nEllandra usually worse several types of expensive jewelry, including her diamond wedding ring, golden necklace, and for jade bracelets. Within her black shoulder bag, one could find a variety of expensive medicinal surgery tools like knives, scalpels, and bandages. Other items in the bag were four vials of soultravel, three bottles of mindshadow, a potion of extra-healing, three jars of Kheoghtoms ointment, and two doses of dust of sneezing and choking.\nEllandras closest friend and confidant was Mistress Yola – Pain-Mistress Yolanda Shamat, who influenced the necromancer enough to add a cruel streak to Ellandras personality. Despite Yolas religious zealotry, Ellandra considered her to be an ally.\nEllandra Tolbert was born to a famous anatomist father from a noble House Tolbert of Neverwinter, and from her early years, she assisted Lord Tolberts work&mdashanatomical dissections. The family suffered a great loss when Ellandra was just thirteen winters old. The family estate was torched and burned down, leaving Ellandra the only survivor. A disgruntled serf perpetrated the arson that left the young girls face badly scarred. The loss of the family estate did not affect Ellandras commitment to her fathers work, and with time, she joined the Anatomical Academy on Sahu, the Homeland of the Necromancer Kings, and later, to Waterdeep. Her initial focus was curing or hiding the facial disfigurements – this was the genesis of the false face spell. Further research led Ellandra to discover the graft flesh magic that allowed her to wear flesh from cadavers as her own.\nWell into her adulthood, Ellandras appearance was hidden underneath grafted flesh that she masterfully blended with her own skin via the mastery in the Art. Ellandra weaved a series of spells that maintained her appearance daily, ensuring that a simple application of dispel magic would leave her magically grafted face unaffected.\nSome five years before the law 14 century DR, Ellandra Tolberts husband – famed sea captain and privateer named Gerard Anterra, perished in a naval battle by the Nelanther Isles. With no body left to be returned to the widow, Ellandra fell into a deep depression and eventually fully committed her life to the Anatomical Academy. In her thirties, she obsessively was working for the academy, all while secretly sought for a way to return Gerard Anterra back to her."
