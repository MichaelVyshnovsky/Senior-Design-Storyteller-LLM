        "mainbody": "'''Drengar Harbright''' was the proprietor of the [[High Flagon]] gambling hall and inn located about two miles (just over three kilometers) north of [[Waterdeep]] on the [[Long Road]],<ref group=\"note\">Either the location of the High Flagon was retconned, or there was a second establishment by the name of High Flagon Gambling House owned by the same family located at the east edge of the [[Sea Ward of Waterdeep|Sea Ward]] near the North Gate (map key $76). See ''[[City of Splendors: Waterdeep]]'', page 92, and the [http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20060503a Environs of Waterdeep] web enhancement, page 12. ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "Drengar was one of the older uncles in the [[Harbright]] family of Waterdeep and, like most elder members of his family, was going gray at the temples. He was of average height and slightly on the slender side, with sharp, handsome features.",
        "Personality": "As an employer, he was tough but fair to his employees and was respected and well regarded. To his family, he wanted to ensure that his daughters did not get pulled into the corruption of Waterdeep and hastily marry questionable suitors at a young age. Considering that the High Flagon regularly saw gambling, drinking, brawling, [[prostitution]], and [[drug]] dealing, the move out of the city might have been in vain.",
        "Abilities": "Under his management, the High Flagon rapidly became a bigger source of revenue for the Harbright family than their long-established textile business. He provided a relatively safe environment with many armed guards where privacy was respected, cheaters were not tolerated, and the drink menu was considerably long. He contributed to the excitement by occasionally \"sweetening the winner's pot\" with coins from the house coffers. By every measure, the Flagon was a successful business.",
        "Possessions": "Drengar kept the keys to the money vaults (hollow spaces in the walls of the cellar accessible by well hidden, locked doors) in a drawer-safe concealed under a loose board near the wall of his private chamber.{{Cite dragon/302/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The High Flagon|79}}",
        "Activities": "The High Flagon was so successful that the Harbright family (under Drengar's supervision) opened another gambling den outside Waterdeep called the [[Roaring Dragon House]].",
        "Relationships": "His daughters and sometimes other Harbright women worked in the kitchens of the High Flagon where he could keep an eye on them. Drengar placed his niece [[Brarindra Harbright|Brarindra]] and nephew [[Thoalur Harbright|Thoalur]] in charge of the Roaring Dragon where they took alternating shifts as manager."
