Tyssaklera was a very old faerie dragon in Evermeet in 1367 DR.
Tyssaklera claimed to be the queen of all faerie dragons of Faerun, despite the fact that most of her kind in the Realms had never even heard her name. She was so old that she herself had forgotten her exact age. Tyssaklera lived in a massive oak near Farmeadows, attended by a dozen faerie dragons of various ages.
Tyssaklera was more serious than most of her kind, thanks to her old age. She still enjoyed pranks but sometime she thought of serious matters like how to protect Evermeet or having good dealings with Queen Amlaruil Moonflower.
