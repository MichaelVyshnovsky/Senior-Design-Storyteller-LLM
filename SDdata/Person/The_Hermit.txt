The Hermit was a corpse tearer linnorm sage living in Narfell during the Rage of Dragons of 1373 DR.
The Hermit was a gigantic linnorm, bigger than even a great wyrm dragon, with dark, slimy scales covered in mold and lichen.
In , the Hermit witnessed the first Rage of Dragons and the fall of the draconic empires of the Time of Dragons. He then pledged himself to the service of ancient dark powers.
The Hermit was living in the hills of Narfell with some undead servants. The Nar tribes saw him as a sage and treated him with great reverence and fear. They had legends about the foolishness of seeking its counsel, as usually those helped by the Hermit ended up cursed by him as well.
At some point before 1373 DR, the lich Sammaster sought the Hermit and defeated it in combat, forcing it to reveal all it knew about the origins of the Rage.
In 1373 DR, following the suggestion of some Nar tribesmen, Dorn Graybrook and his allies Karasendrieth, Pavel Shemov, Will Turnstone, Raryn Snowstealer, Taegan Nightwind, Jivex and Brimstone sought an audience with the Hermit. But the Hermit didnt want to become involved in mortal affairs and refused. After a brief skirmish, however, the Hermit agreed to help them and told them what it knew about the creation of the Dracorage mythal the secret elven citadel was built high in the Novularond Mountains in the midst of the Great Glacier.
