'''Yandrin Thorl''' was a [[wizard]] in [[High Dale]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
One time as a demonstration, Yandrin unleashed a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' over a pirate isle in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], totally destroying it.

==Activities==
Yandrin protected the peace of his dale against all invaders, from [[Archendale]], [[Sembia]], and [[Cormyr]]. Yandrin resided in a tower near [[Highmoon]]. Visitors needed to deal with a kind of ''[[unseen servant]]'' that asked them to write their request on a book and leave; if Yandrin was interested, in three days he would contact them. If someone tried to sneak inside, they usually found themself [[teleport]]ed naked into the [[Thunder Peaks]].

==Relationship==
Once a year every year on the same date Yandrin played [[talis]] card games with [[Elminster Aumar]].
