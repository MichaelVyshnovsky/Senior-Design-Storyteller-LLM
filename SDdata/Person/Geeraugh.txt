'''Geeraugh''' was a [[half-ogre]] bandit in [[Red Larch]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Geeraugh and his companion [[Mougra]] were hidden in the [[Haunted Tomb]] of Red Larch waiting for a bandit raid. However, the young [[Pell Mhandyvver]] saw Mougra and directed some adventurers to the tomb, where they defeated Mougra and Geeraugh.
