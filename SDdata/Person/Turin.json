        "mainbody": "'''Turin''' was a humble [[desert rider]] inhabiting the [[High Desert]] of [[west Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}",
        "Description": "Turin was an unattractive man by most standards. His features included a huge nose, droopy eyes and huge ears. A disease he suffered from as a child left his body completely devoid of hair.",
        "Personality": "Turin had low self-esteem.",
        "Possessions": "He wore a simple [[copper]] ring inscribed with his mother's name.",
        "History": "Turin survived an attack at sea by a [[zaratan]] as a young child, floating on a piece of drift wood from [[Suq Bay]] until he reached shore along the southern region of the High Desert. He wandered for a week through the desert until a tribe of nomads found him.\n\nHe spent the next decade of his life with the tribe where he learned the skills of the desert riders. He discovered a knack with dealing with animals and was even able to soothe them with a touch.\n\nHis tribe was ambushed by the [[House of Dhi'b]] and Turin would have perished had [[Khafaz ibn Dahz]] not arrived with a compliment of [[Tajar]]i soldiers to drive off the raiders. Khafaz planned on selling Turin as a slave but quickly discovered his useful abilities with animals and the ways of the desert. Turin worked with Khafaz since being rescued in the desert."
