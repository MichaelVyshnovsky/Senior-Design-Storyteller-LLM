'''Shaleen''' was the long-lost love of [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] and his first wife, who he thought and dreamed about often later in life.

==Description==
Shaleen had an uncanny resemblance to [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]]. They both had bright, silvery eyes, long auburn hair, and pearly white teeth.

==Personality==
According to Piergeiron, Shaleen was anything but helpless.

==Relationships==
Shaleen and Piergeiron were in a passionate relationship during the Paladinson's young years.

==History==
Shaleen and Prigeiron were eventually wed. At some point long before [[1371 DR]]{{DDTS}} Shaleen was believed dead but in truth she was abducted by the [[Unseen]] and put in a [[stasis sphere]].
