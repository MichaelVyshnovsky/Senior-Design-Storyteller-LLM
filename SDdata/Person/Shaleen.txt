Shaleen was the long-lost love of Piergeiron the Paladinson and his first wife, who he thought and dreamed about often later in life.
Shaleen had an uncanny resemblance to Eidola of Neverwinter. They both had bright, silvery eyes, long auburn hair, and pearly white teeth.
According to Piergeiron, Shaleen was anything but helpless.
Shaleen and Piergeiron were in a passionate relationship during the Paladinsons young years.
Shaleen and Prigeiron were eventually wed. At some point long before 1371 DR Shaleen was believed dead but in truth she was abducted by the Unseen and put in a stasis sphere.
