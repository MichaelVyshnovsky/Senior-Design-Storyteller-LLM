Amber Smithkin was a blacksmith in Skullport in the mid-14 century DR.
Amber Smithkin owned and operated the Amberforge, formerly known as The Ringing Stone. Having inherited the business upon her fathers death, Amber proved herself a skilled and dedicated blacksmith, carrying forward her familys legacy with pride. Despite having several brothers, it was Ambers passion and talent for ironworking that led her to take over the forge.
Amber Smithkin was known for her no-nonsense demeanor and an intolerance for disrespect, particularly in regard to her craft. Her reputation as a master of her trade, combined with her physically imposing presence, discouraged most from challenging her. However, customers who approached her with proper respect were rewarded with high-quality metal goods, including nails, horseshoes, pots, cauldrons, and various ironworking tools. The products she forged were durable and reliable, offered at average prices that reflect their solid workmanship.
