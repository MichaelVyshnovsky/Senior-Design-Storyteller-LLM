'''Amber Smithkin''' was a blacksmith in [[Skullport]] in the mid-14{{th}} century DR.

==Description==
Amber Smithkin owned and operated the [[Amberforge]], formerly known as The Ringing Stone. Having inherited the business upon her father's death, Amber proved herself a skilled and dedicated blacksmith, carrying forward her family's legacy with pride. Despite having several brothers, it was Amber's passion and talent for [[iron]]working that led her to take over the forge.

==Personality==
Amber Smithkin was known for her no-nonsense demeanor and an intolerance for disrespect, particularly in regard to her craft. Her reputation as a master of her trade, combined with her physically imposing presence, discouraged most from challenging her. However, customers who approached her with proper respect were rewarded with high-quality metal goods, including [[nail]]s, [[horseshoe]]s, [[pot]]s, [[cauldron]]s, and various ironworking tools. The products she forged were durable and reliable, offered at average prices that reflect their solid workmanship.
