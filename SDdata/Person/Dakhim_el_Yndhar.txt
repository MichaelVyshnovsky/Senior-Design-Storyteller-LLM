'''Dakhim el Yndhar''' was a former caleph arcane of [[Almraiven]].

==History==
While one of the most powerful wizards alive in [[Calimshan]] in [[1370 DR]], the elderly wizard chose to live as a hermit in one of the minarets in northern [[Memnon]]. From his simple-looking tower, he spent his time making specialty [[magic carpet]]s and other magic item variants. While the [[Ralan el Pesarkhal|syl-pasha]] tried to bribe him to move to [[Calimport]] and provide his services at court, the old [[enchanter]] despised politics.
