        "History": {
            "Stoneplague": "In the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Torrin traveled into the [[Underdark]] to purchase a [[teleportation]] rune from a shady dwarf. The dwarf had a strange condition that made his skin look like dried mud and his eyes like white marbles.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|160}}\n\nShortly afterward, his young nephew [[Kier Thunsonn|Kier]] stole a [[griffon]] from Eartheart's griffon pens and rode to an [[earthmote]] drifting over the [[East Rift]]. Torrin followed Kier and together they found a cache of [[gold]] bars in a cave.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|821}} Although they were unable to loot the cache, the city guard retrieved the stash. The bars were contaminated with the [[Stoneplague]], which was unleashed on Eartheart.<ref>{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|?}}\n\nTorrin deduced that the contaminated gold was the source of the Stoneplague. He used his teleportation rune to teleport to [[Eralynn Thunsonn]] in the dwarven city of [[Sundasz]].{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|2621}} While in Sundasz, Torrin was able to trick several of the dwarves who made the tainted gold bars into meeting him. After a fight, he interrogated one of the dwarves and learned the gold came from Moradin's [[Moradin's Vein|River of Gold]], which had been cursed by the [[duergar]] of [[Drik Hargunen]] through the use of [[rune magic]]. Torrin reported this information to the Council of Eartheart but they declined to allow him to go along on the raid to destroy the duergar magic.<ref>{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|?}}\n\nInstead, Torrin teleported into Drik Hargunen and discovered the rune magic inside a giant [[geode]]. Torrin was able to destroy the magic with the help of several raiders from Eartheart. Torrin, however, was killed by the destruction of the rune magic.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|4358}}\n\nAfter his death, his soul journeyed to [[Moradin]]'s realm and the god allowed Torrin to be reincarnated as a dwarf in honor of his service to the dwarven people. Decades later, Torrin was reincarnated as Kier's son.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|4441}}"

        "Personality": "Although Torrin was undeniably reincarnated by Moradin as a dwarf decades after his death, it was unknown whether his belief that he had a dwarven soul in his human body was correct.<ref>{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|?}}",
        "Relationships": "Torin was a close friend of [[Eralynn Thunsonn]] and several other members of the Thunsonn clan. He was considered an uncle to Kier Thunsonn. He had a frosty relationship with his human parents and rarely visited them.<ref>{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|?}}",
        "Equipment": "Torrin carried a magical dwarven mace and used goggles that allowed him to see in the dark.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|156}} He also carried the standard issue Delvers' magic backpack, which only he could open.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|960}}",
        "Description": "Torrin had a full red beard with silver hammers tied to the braids.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|300}}"
