'''Komatsu''' was a [[yakuza]] in the town of [[Aru]] in [[Wa]].

==History==
Komatsu was once a yakuza in a large city but became a freelance thief. In {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, he was in Aru doing dirty jobs for the local yakuza gang. He stayed at [[The Apple Tree Inn]] and might've been confronted by adventurers there.
