Caliph '''Hava al-Gatil''' was the ruler of [[Halwa]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/Land of Fate/Adventurer's Guide to Zakhara|58}}

==Activities==
Hava's main interest appeared to be his memoirs. He spent the vast majority of his time cloistered with his favorite scribes, writing of his personal exploits from adventures past.

The caliph left the responsibility of running Halwa to his trusted Chief Vizier, [[Zarad]].

==History==
Hava was a skilled [[askar]] in his youth. He enjoyed adventuring before the death of his father forced him to assume the role of caliph.

==Relationships==
Hava had three daughters—[[Sikayah bint Hava|Sikayah]], [[Rajiyah bint Hava|Rajiyah]], and [[Mahabbiyah bint Hava|Mahabbiyah]]—who were triplets nearing maturity in 1367.
