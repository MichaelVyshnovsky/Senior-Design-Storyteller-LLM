'''Kinase Bronihim''' was a wizard from [[Chavyondat]]. He sought the ''[[Evise Jhontil]]'' in {{yearlink|1372}}, ultimately getting himself trapped in [[Lliiress]] after finding it.

==Description==
Kinase wore a purple cloak, and a robe whose sleeves were covered in designs from [[Estagund]]. His hair was graying, and his forehead sloped very steeply.

==Personality==
Kinase was almost completely defined by his arrogance. However, he mellowed out somewhat through his stay in Lliiress.

==Abilities==
Amongst other spells, Kinase could cast a spell similar to ''[[discern lies]]'', and one that kept him from touching the ground, possibly ''[[Halaster's light step]]''. He also could cast ''[[detect magic]]''.

==History==
In {{yearlink|1372}}, Kinase Bronihim sought out the [[blue dragon]] [[Gerinvioch]], demanding the ''[[Evise Jhontil]]'' at once. The dragon played at being cowed, ultimately giving Kinase the location of the artifact. Kinase followed his directions to the town of ''[[Lliiress]]''. A local woman, [[Moriandro]], related unto him the story of the town, and explained to him that there was no escape, and no spells could be cast, for any spell would kill its caster due to the ''Evise Jhontil''.

Kinase remained for at least a number of months in Lliiress.

==Rumors & Legends==
Kinase Bronihim pretended to have slain the [[green dragon]] [[Ronatsinaderin]] during his attempt at bullying [[Gerinvioch]].
