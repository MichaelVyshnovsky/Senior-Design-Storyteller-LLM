        "mainbody": "Arton Githsberry was the ruler of Turmish in 522 DR, whose seat of power was the city of Alagh√¥n.\nWhen petitioned by a joint delegation of Gulthmere druids and Xorhunian elves to cease Turmishs logging operations, Githsberry made a show of inviting all his lords to discuss the issue. This gathering was merely a political facade, however, as Githberry had no intention of heeding the druids request."
