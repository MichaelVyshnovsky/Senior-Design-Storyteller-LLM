Tekinjo Yojairo was the military governor the empire of Wa around Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR).
Yojairo was a highly skilled samurai. As military governor of Wa, Yojairos responsibility was to serve as the liaison between the emperor in Rukimbaru&mdashwhere Yojairo also lived at the palace&mdashand the shogun in Uwaji.
Yojairo was a rather handsome man.
Yojairo was a man of good heart and a very efficient administrator. Even though he was part of a family that essentially guaranteed him an official position, he could easily have earned the role by the merits of his shrewd skill in management.
His service had shown him the true miseries of Was poor people and the hypocrisies of the shogunate, and he began to grow discontent with his rule in the government of Wa. He kept these feelings secret from everyone.
Yojairo was the oldest son of Daimyo Tekinjo Gasahan of Kurahito, one of the Three House daimyos.
When Yojairo learned that shogun Matasuuri Nagahides granddaughter Kisha Yunoko was sent to be the emperors concubine as a means of spying on him, he was disgusted. Knowing that she was forced to act as a pawn, he felt great compassion for her, which soon grew into love, and they began a secret affair.
Around Wa Year 1765 (1347 DR), Yojairo was appointed as military governor. Around 1774 (1347 DR) was when he started his secret relationship with Yunoko.
