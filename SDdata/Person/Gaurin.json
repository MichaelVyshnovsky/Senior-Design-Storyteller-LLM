        "History": "Jesanta Beril's uncle found the [[Talontar]] blightlord Gaurin and had him serve as Jesanta's tutor in [[the Art]] on her twelfth birthday. Gaurin taught her magic in the Lady of Poison, [[Talona]]'s ways, rather than [[sorcery]]; as a tutor, he disciplined Jesanta for her interest in binding [[demon]]s over creating [[disease]]s. However, on her eighteenth birthday, Jesanta wandered into her uncle's cabin and found him dead to a Talontar [[poison]]; in response, she slew Gaurin in his sleep.",
        "Legacy": "Jesanta Beril later named her [[imp]] [[familiar]] [[Gaurin (imp)|Gaurin]] after the late blightlord."
