        "mainbody": "'''Zymena''' was a [[demon]] [[sorceress]] in [[Westgate]] around [[1374 DR]].",
        "History": "Zymena became intrigued by the [[banshee]] [[Elandra]] and the [[Human Cattle Factory]] built by the [[Night Masks]]' leader [[Orbakh]]. She decided that she wanted Elandra and the factory for herself. So Zymena posed as a [[human]] sorceress and helped the rebellious [[vampire]] [[Tasheni]] to create the [[Ebon Claws]] crime organization to start a war against the Night Masks.\n\nAround 1374 DR, Zymena was decisive in helping an adventurer in their fight with the Night Masks. At last, when it seemed that the adventurer had killed Orbakh and Tasheni, Zymena arrived together with two [[erinyes]] to take possession of the factory, showing her true nature. However, the adventurer managed to defeat Zymena (and Orbakh was revealed to have faked his death)."
