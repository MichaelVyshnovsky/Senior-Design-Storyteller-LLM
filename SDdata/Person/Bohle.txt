Bohle was a skilled thief inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
His house was located along the High Road in central Daggerford. Bohle excelled at collection information while remaining unseen, but was far less skilled in picking pockets, opening locks, and finding traps.
