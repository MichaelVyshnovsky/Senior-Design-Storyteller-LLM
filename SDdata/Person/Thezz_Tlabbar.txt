'''Thezz Tlabbar''' was a [[drow]] warrior of [[House Faen Tlabbar]] in [[Menzoberranzan]].
 
==Description==
Thezz had a good appearance.

==Personality==
Thezz always tried to bully people of Houses lowest than his, but reluctantly obeyed those of higher-ranked Houses.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], Thezz was among the people gathered to inspect the lost outpost of [[Sezz'ia]], alongside priestesses [[Guannerrae Tlabbar]], [[Myaral Tlabbar]], and [[Iyelle Tlabbar]], among others. However, Iyelle turned traitor and attacked her fellows, including Thezz, during a battle with some monsters.

Thezz survived without injuries, unlike the priestesses, so he became the spokesman of the group. He planned to go back to Menzoberranzan.

==Relationship==
Thezz was a favorite of First Priestess [[Luafae Tlabbar]].
