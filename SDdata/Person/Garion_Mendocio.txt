Circus performer
Garion Mendocio was a human adventuring swashbuckler active in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Garion was a pompous and loud man who often underestimated his opponents.
As a swordsman, Garion wielded a pair of enchanted weapons a +3 rapier and a +2 stiletto. Other magic items in his possession included boots of striding and springing and gloves of missile snaring.
Garion was raised in a traveling circus where he was taught the swashbuckling skills. These swordsmanship skills remained in use and helped the man for many years after he left the circus life.
