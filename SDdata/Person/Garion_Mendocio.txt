'''Garion Mendocio''' was a [[human]] adventuring [[swashbuckler]] active in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Garion was a pompous and loud man who often underestimated his opponents.

==Possessions==
As a swordsman, Garion wielded a pair of [[enchanted]] [[weapon]]s: a ''+3'' [[rapier]] and a ''+2'' [[stiletto]]. Other [[magic item]]s in his possession included ''[[boots of striding and springing]]'' and ''[[gloves of missile snaring]]''.

==History==
Garion was raised in a traveling circus where he was taught the swashbuckling skills. These swordsmanship skills remained in use and helped the man for many years after he left the circus life.
