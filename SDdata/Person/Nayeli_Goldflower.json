        "mainbody": "'''Nayeli Goldflower''' was a [[human]] [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]] who served as advisor to Duke [[Maldwyn Daggerford|Maldwyn]] of [[Daggerford]] and was a member of the [[Guardians of Daggerford]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "A stern-looking woman, Nayeli had brown eyes, dark skin, and spiky hair. She had several ear piercings, and facial tattoos on both cheeks.",
        "Personality": "Nayeli was driven by a quest for vengeance, and sometimes felt that she struggled to observe her oaths as a paladin. From her perspective, her enemies included not only her sworn enemies and targets, but any who supported or benefitted from their actions.",
        "Possessions": "Nayeli's combat gear consisted of a suit of [[chain mail]] worn over a red tunic, with [[plate mail|plate]] gauntlets protecting her hands. Her armor was emblazoned with the glory of Tyr, and included an enchanted helm known as the ''[[Radiance of Tyr]]''. She also wore ceremonial Tyrran armored boots, and had sharpened the metal plates on these boots to both give her an edge in combat and to give her foes fair warning of her approach. She wielded a [[Blessed Sword of Tyr|Tyr-blessed greatsword]] in combat in addition to a ''[[holy avenger]]'' blade, and she carried a mundane [[halberd]] as well as two enchanted ones, named the ''[[Daggerford Blade]]'' and the ''[[halberd of swift admonition]]''. Her most valuable weapon, however, was ''[[Tyr's Justice]]'', a blade forged with [[devil]]-tainted [[gold]] off Duke Maldwyn's body.\n\nShe possessed several potent [[holy symbol]]s of Tyr, including a ''[[sign of Tyr]]'', a ''[[mark of Tyr]]'', a ''[[symbol of Tyr]]'', and the ''[[Judgement of Tyr]]''.\n\nDuring her time performing missions for [[Laeral Silverhand]] alongside other warriors of [[Waterdeep]], Nayeli was in possession of several additional magic items, including a ''[[serpentine]] [[owl]]'' (one of the ''[[figurine of wondrous power|figurines of wondrous power]]''), the ''[[seal of righteousness]]'', and a ''[[paladin's helm]]'', and she wore a ''[[ring of vigor]]'' and a ''[[belt of bodily health]].''\n\nDuring her time serving alongside the Guardians of Daggerford, Nayeli was equipped with a [[scarab]]-shaped ''[[brooch of shielding]]''. She abandoned wearing the item after Maldwyn Daggerford's murder, but eventually was encouraged to proudly display the ''brooch'' as the representation of her oath of vengeance by [[Laeral Silverhand]].",
        "History": "Nayeli served as both guardian and advisor to Duke Maldwyn of Daggerford, until his untimely demise after being possessed by the [[devil]], [[Baazka]]. Following the death of her master, Nayeli took up an oath of vengeance and wandered Toril seeking to destroy infernal beings and their allies."
