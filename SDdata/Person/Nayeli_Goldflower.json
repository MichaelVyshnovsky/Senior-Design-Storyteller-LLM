        "mainbody": "ayeli Goldflower was a human paladin of Tyr who served as advisor to Duke Maldwyn of Daggerford and was a member of the Guardians of Daggerford in the late 15 century DR.\nA stern-looking woman, Nayeli had brown eyes, dark skin, and spiky hair. She had several ear piercings, and facial tattoos on both cheeks.\nNayeli was driven by a quest for vengeance, and sometimes felt that she struggled to observe her oaths as a paladin. From her perspective, her enemies included not only her sworn enemies and targets, but any who supported or benefitted from their actions.\nNayelis combat gear consisted of a suit of chain mail worn over a red tunic, with plate gauntlets protecting her hands. Her armor was emblazoned with the glory of Tyr, and included an enchanted helm known as the Radiance of Tyr. She also wore ceremonial Tyrran armored boots, and had sharpened the metal plates on these boots to both give her an edge in combat and to give her foes fair warning of her approach. She wielded a Tyr-blessed greatsword in combat in addition to a holy avenger blade, and she carried a mundane halberd as well as two enchanted ones, named the Daggerford Blade and the halberd of swift admonition. Her most valuable weapon, however, was Tyrs Justice, a blade forged with devil-tainted gold off Duke Maldwyns body.\nShe possessed several potent holy symbols of Tyr, including a sign of Tyr, a mark of Tyr, a symbol of Tyr, and the Judgement of Tyr.\nDuring her time performing missions for Laeral Silverhand alongside other warriors of Waterdeep, Nayeli was in possession of several additional magic items, including a serpentine owl (one of the figurines of wondrous power), the seal of righteousness, and a paladins helm, and she wore a ring of vigor and a belt of bodily health.\nDuring her time serving alongside the Guardians of Daggerford, Nayeli was equipped with a scarab-shaped brooch of shielding. She abandoned wearing the item after Maldwyn Daggerfords murder, but eventually was encouraged to proudly display the brooch as the representation of her oath of vengeance by Laeral Silverhand.\nNayeli served as both guardian and advisor to Duke Maldwyn of Daggerford, until his untimely demise after being possessed by the devil, Baazka. Following the death of her master, Nayeli took up an oath of vengeance and wandered Toril seeking to destroy infernal beings and their allies."
