'''Haragh Mnistlyn''' was an apprentice [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]] in [[High Dale]].

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], Haragh was a member of the secret [[Zhent]] occupation army in High Dale. He was acting as gatekeeper when he noticed [[Elminster Aumar]] and [[Sharantyr]]. They looked to be suspicious individuals in his eyes so he cast a ''[[read mind]]'' spell. However, he was instead surrounded by well-trodden grassâ€”a symptom of the [[Time of Troubles]]. Haragh remained totally shocked while Elminster subtly made jokes at him.

When later an insurrection started against the Zhents, Haragh confronted Elminster and Sharantyr inside the [[High Castle]] but they managed to kill him.
