==History==
In [[1362 DR]] while harvesting [[terazul]] blossoms in the jungles south of [[Delzimmer]], guards from her caravan discovered a seemingly human infant girl and brought her back to camp.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|242}}  The child was thought to be the last surviving member of a tribe that had been massacred by [[derro]].  Having no children of her own and needing an heir, Alaia adopted the girl and named her Zaltys.

In [[1479 DR]] Zaltys discovered that her tribe may have been [[slavery|enslaved]] rather than killed by derro and decided to enter the [[Underdark]] with her cousin [[Julen Serrat|Julen]] in search of survivors.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|1405}}  Zaltys and Julen were attacked by derro and she sent a psychic sending to the Serrat guard captain [[Krailash]].

Alaia and Krailash entered the Underdark with a small group of guards but were nearly killed by [[swordwings]].{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|2122}}  Alaia healed Krailash and he was shown the way to the derro settlement by an [[avatar]] of the [[yuan-ti]] [[god]] [[Zehir]].

In the derro settlement, Alaia discovered that the terazul vines grew out of a portal to the [[Far Realm]] that had been opened by the derro.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|3140}}  Because the terazul trade was so important to House Serrat's fortunes, Alaia made the decision to leave the plants alone.  Due to the fact that the Far Realm was so utterly opposed to the natural world of [[Faerûn]], Alaia's decision not to destroy the terazul vines caused her to lose her remaining connection to nature and thus her shamanic powers.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|3372}}  Krailash, however, sacrificed himself to close the portal and the terazul vines withered.

Due to the destruction of the terazul plants, Alaia's status in House Serrat was greatly diminished.  She decided to remain in the jungle to reconnect with nature and regain her shamanic powers.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|3781}}
