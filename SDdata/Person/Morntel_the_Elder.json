        "mainbody": "'''Morntel the Elder''' was a merchant of [[Amn]] and an ex-member of the [[Knights of the Shield]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Morntel was a wealthy merchant in [[Athkatla]], working for [[House Redolo]]. In [[1356 DR]], he was reported to have been killed by a magic attack or by a demonic creature, but unknown to most, this was only a ruse. In truth, Morntel had discovered some Knights involved in the slave traffic to [[Calimshan]] and tried to stop the slaving operation, which was too cruel for his tastes. However, the only result was that the slaver Knights threatened to kill him. So he faked his death and fled to [[Sigil]] in [[Concordant Opposition]].\n\nIt was only in [[1369 DR]] that Morntel reestablished contact with his son, also called [[Morntel]], meeting at the [[Blais House]] in [[Westgate]], where they started making plans for his revenge."
