        "mainbody": "Fhamin Dread was a would-be warlord human mage, active in the 14 century DR.\nBy his seventieth year, the man only known by the alias of Fhamin Dread was already a notoriously obsessive and power-hungry wizard. He pursued his warmongering and aggressive aspirations to conquer through a personal army and magical power. His target was not just a town or a nation but the entire world. Fhamin accumulated experience by slinging spells in battles against monsters, warriors, and fellow mages. Every coin he earned in his travels through adventuring and mercenary work was sent to finance the future army. However, the young mans egomaniacal tendencies made it challenging to find any loyal followers.\nSometime in the 14 century DR, Fhamin Dread was among the ambitious fortune seekers who were interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths."
