Erek was the bodyguard and manservant of Amelior Amanitas.
Erek had long blonde hair, wore a horned helmet, and had a beard that reached past his stomach, giving him a somewhat dwarven appearance. He wore a green shirt over banded mail and fought with a serrated long sword and shield. The fighter was heavily muscled, and had a tattoo on his right arm.
The bodyguard was not so intelligent, but was loyal to his master, whom he deeply respected. However, the Northman was said to be sharp of tongue, and somewhat irritating.
In 1358 DR, Ereks master, Amelior, had been captured by the Zhentarim. Amelior had found out the Zhentarim planned to locate four magical statuettes that, together, could send monsters across the Anauroch desert. Erek overheard that they were taking his master to Zhentil Keep, passing through Everlund and Llorkh on the way.

Erek met up with the future Heroes of Ascore, who had found the scene of Ameliors struggle at a local inn. Erek and the heroes immediately set off to Everlund to find the brilliant magic-user.
After reaching the city of Everlund, they found a group of owlbears feeding, and being trained by Zhentarim agents. Erek and the party killed the evil Zhents and their monstrous pets, which they were planning to use to torture the captive Amelior. The heroes unchained the sage, and he bestowed upon them the ring of reversal. After his heroic part in the rescue, Erek went back to Secomber with Amelior, in order to protect him.
