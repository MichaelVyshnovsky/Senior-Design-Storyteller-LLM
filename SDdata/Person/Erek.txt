'''Erek''' was the bodyguard and manservant of [[Amelior Amanitas]].

==Description==
Erek had long blonde hair, wore a horned [[helmet]], and had a beard that reached past his stomach, giving him a somewhat [[dwarf|dwarven]] appearance. He wore a green shirt over [[banded mail]] and fought with a serrated [[long sword]] and [[shield]]. The fighter was heavily muscled, and had a tattoo on his right arm.

==Personality==
The bodyguard was not so intelligent, but was loyal to his master, whom he deeply respected. However, the [[Northman]] was said to be sharp of tongue, and somewhat irritating.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], Erek's master, Amelior, had been captured by the [[Zhentarim]]. Amelior had found out the Zhentarim planned to locate four [[magic]]al statuettes that, together, could send monsters across the [[Anauroch]] desert. Erek overheard that they were taking his master to [[Zhentil Keep]], passing through [[Everlund]] and [[Llorkh]] on the way.

Erek met up with the future [[Heroes of Ascore]], who had found the scene of Amelior's struggle at a local inn. Erek and the heroes immediately set off to Everlund to find the brilliant [[magic-user]].

After reaching the city of Everlund, they found a group of [[owlbear]]s feeding, and being trained by Zhentarim agents. Erek and the party killed the [[evil]] Zhents and their monstrous pets, which they were planning to use to torture the captive Amelior. The heroes unchained the sage, and he bestowed upon them the ''[[ring of reversal]]''. After his heroic part in the rescue, Erek went back to [[Secomber]] with Amelior, in order to protect him.
