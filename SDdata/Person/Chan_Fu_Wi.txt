Lord Chan Fu Wi was a human samurai and the emissary of the empire of Shou Lung based in the city of Bral on the Rock of Bral in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He was the envoy of Emperor Kai Tsao Shou Chin to both Bral and to wildspace and was invested with significant political and diplomatic powers. He could declare war using Shou Lungs spelljammer navy provided he had a good reason for his emperor afterward. As such, he was consulted by many people on matters involving Shou Lung and his work kept him quite busy.
He was also the only Shou noble in Bral and held the power of high justice. As such, he held leadership and legal authority over the Shou community and Shou-town, but he chose not to exert it. He also ignored Ozamata Ku Murawa, leader of the Yakuza thieves guild, and the businesswoman Kurishi Otobe, as he believed squabbling over leadership with them to be undignified and beneath him, though he could have the crime lord executed if he needed. 
He was a dignified elderly man almost 80 years in age.
He was known for his restrained and quiet manner, which disguised the political power he wielded.
A capable warrior in his younger days and a respected statesman, Lord Chan was appointed as ambassador to Bral by the 1360s DR.
He was equipped with bracers of defense and a +3 katana in which he was specialized. He also had dust of disappearance and a potion of flying.
He had a home in the High City, on Noble Street between House Lianin and House Mosantas and opposite House Murawa.
He worked at the Shou Embassy, which was located in the Low City in Shou-town.
