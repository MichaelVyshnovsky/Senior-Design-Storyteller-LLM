Kyrie was a kind of bounty hunter in Daggerford around 1370 DR.
Kyrie was hired by nobles from Waterdeep who needed property or personal belongings retrieved. If the price was right, she would travel from Ascore to Calimshan to find the goods.
Her home was located along Horse Way and Wall Street in northwest Daggerford.
