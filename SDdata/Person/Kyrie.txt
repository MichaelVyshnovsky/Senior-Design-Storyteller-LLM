'''Kyrie''' was a kind of bounty hunter in [[Daggerford]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Kyrie was hired by nobles from [[Waterdeep]] who needed property or personal belongings retrieved. If the price was right, she would travel from [[Ascore]] to [[Calimshan]] to find the goods.

Her home was located along [[Horse Way]] and [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]] in northwest Daggerford.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
