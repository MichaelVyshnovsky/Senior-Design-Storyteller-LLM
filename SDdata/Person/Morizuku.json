        "mainbody": "Morizuku was a hunting spider katanga who served the Mother of a Thousand Young as her bodyguard within the Fire Mountain of the Malatran Plateau in the late 14 century DR.\nAs an experienced warrior, Morizuku was a fearsome foe. He preferred to fight in bipedal form while starting combat by throwing ranged weapons at the enemy.\nMorizuku was armed with a large enchanted wooden shield and carried five halfspears into battle. Like other spider katanga, Morizuku could freely crawl across any surface, and his bite was a deadly venomous weapon.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the Wise Ones tribe became aware of the leader of evil spider katanga, the Mother of a Thousand Young, being ready to birth a thousand ravenous younglings. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Morizuku, along with Taluku, was tasked with guarding the venomous Mother at the center of her bones-riddled nest. Both katanga fought defensively when a band of heroes from the Living Jungles reached the Mother of a Thousand Young in an attempt to end the poisoning and the spawning.\nMorizukus fate is unknown however, his death was almost unavoidable as he and Taluku would fight until their dying breath to defend the Mother."
