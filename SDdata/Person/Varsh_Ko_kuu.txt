'''Varsh Ko'kuu''' was a [[githyanki]] youth caretaker from [[Crèche Y'llek]], on [[Toril]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''Most caretakers would not give the child its fair chance, but I shall. There could be greatness in that shell.''|Varsh Ko'kuu}}

==Description==
Ko'kuu was a lanky githyanki with white hair and well-trimmed facial hair. He wore a sophisticated collection of [[lenses]] that formed an ocular device on his left eye.

==Possessions==
Varsh Ko'kuu was armed with a large [[crossbow]] of githyanki design. He also wore a pair of [[enchanted]] ''[[Varsh Ko'kuu's boots|boots]]'' that protected him from the acidic pools in the Crèche Y'llek hatchery.

==History==
Varsh Ko'kuu, along with other gith of what would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the [[Rosymorn Monastery]] of [[Lathander]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[West Faerûn]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the [[mind flayer]]s in [[Faerûn]] shifted in balance. Varsh Ko'kuu was in charge of githyanki eggs, personally creating the entire hatchery. Ko'kuu's opinions on the young clashed with others, especially Kith'rak [[Therezzyn]], as he was not willing to discard delayed unhatched eggs, believing that even a "weak" gith could hold greatness. This belief was personal. Ko'kuu himself was the last hatchling of his clutch and was close to being drowned in the hatchery acid, so he wholeheartedly believed that not all late haltings were weak.

Varsh was desperate to save the last unhatched egg in 1492 DR and could be convinced to give it up to Lady [[Esther]], an adventurer employed by the [[Society of Brilliance]], the organization that sought to prove that nurture trumped nature by raising a githyanki from birth to being good.
