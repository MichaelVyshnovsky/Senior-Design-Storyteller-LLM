'''Lallargh''' was [[firbolg]] crone who lived in the [[South Jotunhammer Mountains]] on the island of [[Norland]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|11}}

==Activities==
Lallargh led the firbolgs and other [[giant]]s who claimed the mountains. She believed that for her kind to survive they needed to sweep down from the mountains and crush [[Rogarsheim]], allowing them to take the rest of Norland with ease. To further this goal Lallargh made pacts with [[duergar]] who lived beneath the mountains, as well as wicked [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. All were promised a portion of the spoils after Rogersheim was sacked.
