        "History": "Sometime in 15{{th}} century DR, a group of githyanki led by [[Al'chaia]] arrived at the [[Crystal Labyrinth]] while tracking down a colony of mind flayers in the level of [[Seadeeps]]. Upon discovery of the portal leading to [[Stardock]], they converted the abandoned asteroid into a crèche for the breeding and training of young githyanki, which they named Crèche K'liir. The labyrinth was converted into a fortress from where they led attacks against the mind flayers and protected their access to Stardock.\n\nAround [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], Urlon remained to command the githyanki inside the Labyrinth while Al'chaia was in Stardock.\n\nAfter succeeding Al'chaia as Commander of Stardock, he set out to transform the asteroid into a stronghold for the reunited Gith people.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Stardock Under Siege|4}}",
