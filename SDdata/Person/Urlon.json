        "mainbody": "Urlon was a githyanki commander in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR. Following the demise of Alchaia, he became ruler of Stardock.\nSometime in 15 century DR, a group of githyanki led by Alchaia arrived at the Crystal Labyrinth while tracking down a colony of mind flayers in the level of Seadeeps. Upon discovery of the portal leading to Stardock, they converted the abandoned asteroid into a crèche for the breeding and training of young githyanki, which they named Crèche Kliir. The labyrinth was converted into a fortress from where they led attacks against the mind flayers and protected their access to Stardock.\nAround Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR, Urlon remained to command the githyanki inside the Labyrinth while Alchaia was in Stardock.\nAfter succeeding Alchaia as Commander of Stardock, he set out to transform the asteroid into a stronghold for the reunited Gith people.\nUrlon was usually inside the laboratory where it created crystal golems.\nUrlon was a gish and the second-in-command of Alchaia but hated his boss, believing her a tyrant and wanting her dead. He sympathized with the githzerai. He was disposed to collaborating with adventurers in order to plot the death of Alchaia. \nHe was secretly a member of the Shasal Khou, an organization dedicated to reuniting the gith race."
