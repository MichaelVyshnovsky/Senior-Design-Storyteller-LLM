        "Personality": "Maraunth Torr was a young and ambitious archmage. He despised the [[shadovar]] for their haughtiness about non-[[Netherese]]. He was an expert poisoner. [[Elminster]] considered him like a young [[Manshoon]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, [[Hlael Toraunt]] of the [[Zhentarim]] considered Maraunth Torr together with [[Shaaan]], [[Szass Tam]], and [[Larloch]] to be one of the most powerful evil archmages of the time. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1487}}, he was one of the archmages who competed for possession of the [[Lost Spell]] during a [[spellstorm]]. Maraunth killed the rival [[Harper]] wizard [[Alastra Hathwinter]] but was ultimately killed by Shaaan the Serpent Queen in a fight."
