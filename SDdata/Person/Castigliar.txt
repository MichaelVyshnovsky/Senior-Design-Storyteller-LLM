Castigliar was a nobleman from Scardale who was the namesake of Port Castigliar in Chult.
Several centuries before 1362 DR, Sir Ilyber Kitcher arrived in Chult. Financed by his rich uncle Castigliar, Ilyber embarked on uncovering unmapped Chultan lands and planned to erect a series of enchanted monuments to commemorate his future glorious achievements. He planned to place these busts on the sites of his discoveries and illustrious battles and enchant them to recite the tales of Sir Kitchers achievements and inform travelers about local flora and fauna and survival tips. The hapless explorer soon died due to his own pompousness but not before he named a plot of beach along the Refugee Bay after his uncle, Port Castigliar.
Thankful for the naming, uncle Castigliar paid a group of people to sneak into the jungles and erect the monument to the fallen relative that later came to be known as Kitchers Folly.
