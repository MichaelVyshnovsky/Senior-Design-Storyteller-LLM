        "mainbody": "hyester of Silverymoon was the first prophet of Lathander, who was formerly blind.\nDuring his life, Rhyester founded multiple temples for his god, preached sermons, and received visions from Lathander, including one called the Vision of the Ten Suns, which was an encouragement to persevere in times of trouble.\nRhyester was born blind however, at dawn on Ches 1 of 717 DR, he miraculously received his sight. In response to his healing, although only a young boy at the time, Rhyester helped found a crude temple to Lathander in Silverymoon, called Lathanders Dawn.\nIn 760 DR, Rhyester preached his famous \"Sermon of the Eclipse\", spoken during the solar eclipse that year. The sermon used the Dawn Cataclysm as an example of how lessons can be learned from failures. Rhyester wrote out the sermon in advance, but only an excerpt survived.\nRhyester died of natural causes in the Year of the Aurumvorax, 773 DR. He was buried beneath the first temple that he founded, and it was renamed Rhyesters Matins in his honor within a year.\nThe city of Waterdeep held an annual, day-long holiday to remember Rhyester, known as Rhyestertide.\nThe musical prodigy, Rhiist Majarra, grandson of Kethul Majarra, of Waterdeep composed a complicated ballad titled, \"Rhyesters Eyes\", which only a few skilled bards, such as Mintiper Moonsilver and Storm Silverhand were ever able to master.\nThe phrase \"Rhyesters Eyes\" was also used as an exclamation of surprise, as in, \"Rhyesters Eyes! What a fighter he was.\""
