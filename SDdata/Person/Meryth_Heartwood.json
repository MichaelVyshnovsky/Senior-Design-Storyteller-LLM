        "mainbody": "'''Meryth Heartwood''' was a [[spellscarred]] resident of [[Helm's Hold]] and a member of the [[Heirs of Azure]] political movement that arose in the city during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|[[Rohini|The Prophet]] fooled us. Everything she did was a ruse.|Meryth}}",
        "Description": "Unlike the more extreme followers of the movement, Meryth advocated for peaceful resistance against the anti-spellscared sentiments that were so strong among her fellow citizens.",
        "Personality": "Meryth held the culture of [[Illefarn]] with great reverence, particularly the form of artistry known as ''[[song path]]s'', ''portal'' networks associated with performances of hours-long poems.",
        "History": "Meryth was a devout believer in the movement led by the [[half-elf]] spellscarred [[Halas]], as well as the all-inclusive oration offered by the Prophet [[Rohini]]. She was wholly disillusioned when Rohini revealed herself to be the leader of the [[Ashmadai]], and cleansed Halas and many of his followers of their spellscars, in exchange for their devotion to the [[devil]]-worshiping [[Ashmadai]]. \n\nDuring the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Meryth joined a resistance group operating at a camp at the edge of the [[Watcher's Forest]]. She found comrades among the group, including her fellow [[elf]] [[Dassar Truebow]], a [[hedge wizard]] named [[Nottin]], and the merchant [[Kella|Kella the Fair-Dealing]]. She worked with fellow [[elven]] adventurers to help recover stolen relics from Illefarn, and prevent the Ashmadai from opening a''song paths'' within the city."
