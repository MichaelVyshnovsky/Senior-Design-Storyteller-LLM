'''Ulgulu''' was a [[barghest]] whelp from the planes of [[Gehenna]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the brother of [[Kempfana]].

==Description==
Ulgulu was a huge purple-skinned [[goblin]]-like creature with glowing orange eyes. He was bigger than his brother Kempfana.

==History==
Sent to the [[Material Plane]] to eat and grow, Ulgulu and his brother Kempfana made their home in the cave of a [[hill giant]] named [[Lagerbottoms]] in the [[Silver Marches]], where they could safely mature before returning to their home plane.

Around [[1340 DR]], the barghests sent their main force of [[gnoll]]s to capture the father and eldest son of the [[Thistledown (family)|Thistledown]] family, but the raiders never returned. Ulgulu and his brother sent [[Nathak]] to scout out what happened, and he returned reporting their raiding party of five gnolls were dead. After that, Ulgulu sent his [[quickling]] ally, [[Tephanis]], to discover exactly what had happened. When Tephanis returned, he told them a newly surfaced [[drow]], [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], had slain the monsters. In rage, Ulgulu asked the quickling steal one of Drizzt's [[scimitar]]s.<ref> After receiving the blade, Ulgulu used his shape-changing abilities to make himself appear as a drow, and attacked the Thistledown farmstead. After slaying the residents, he left the broken scimitar to frame Drizzt as the killer of the family.<ref>

When Drizzt learned what had happened, he and [[Guenhwyvar]] attacked the cave's inhabitants, destroying the two barghests and many of their goblin allies. Ulgulu changed into his monstrous wolf-like form and pursued Guenhwyvar to a cliff, but when he pounced, the panther dissolved into mist, going back to the [[Astral Plane]], and Ulgulu fell over the cliff. Though he tried changing back to a more humanoid shape in order to [[levitate]], he was too slow and died on impact, his body halfway through transformation.

His twisted remains were later found by the party investigating the death of the Thistledowns and Drizzt's intentions. [[Dove Falconhand]] would then come to the correct conclusion that Drizzt battled Ulgulu and Kempfana to avenge the deaths of the Thistledown family.<ref>
