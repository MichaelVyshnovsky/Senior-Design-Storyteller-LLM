'''Kardhel Terov''' was a fellthane among the [[Warlock Knights]] of [[Vaasa]] and an ambitious merchant in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Kardhel was a tall [[human]] with pale skin, iron-gray hair, and a normally clean-shaven face with a strong jawline. As a result of his forming the pact with [[Telos]] that all Warlock Knights took, his eyes were a deep, bloody crimson. 

==Personality==
Terov was manipulative and cold. He was always unflappably calm, with an iron will that he used to suppress showing any anger or frustration in his negotiations. He was quick to offer and require that those with whom he made deals swear upon his pact ring, and thus partake in the ''[[pact of the iron ring]]'' to compel both parties to uphold their end of the bargain.

==Possessions==
Among Terov's possessions was his heavy [[ironfell ring|''ironfell'' pact ring]] carved with dire runes, which he wore on his finger and which was not removable.

When he though he might be going into danger, Kardhel wore ebon [[plate mail]] with a black helm fitted with gilded ram's horns curling from the sides. 

==History==
In [[Ches]] of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Terov approached [[Mhurren]] of the [[Bloody Skulls]] [[orc]] tribe, offering the warchief his own kingdom of [[Thar]] in exchange for an oath of fealty and an agreement not to endanger cities under Kardhel's protection. Wanting to have a protected trade route from Vaasa to the [[Moonsea]], he provided the chieftain with arms, armaments, monsters, and the loyalty of several other Tharran tribes, which Mhurren then used to sack [[Glister]] and then march on [[Hulburg]], where the army was defeated at the [[Battle of Lendon's Dike]] in [[Tarsakh]] of that year.

Undeterred, he continued to try to bring Hulburg into Vaasa's orbit, first by trying to undermine the city and the [[Hulmaster]] family by supporting [[Valdarsel]], a follower of [[Cyric]] stoking discontent and violent among the populace in mid-to-late 1479 DR, and then by offering power and protection to the usurper [[Rhovann Disarnnyl]] in [[Alturiak]] of the {{YearlinkName|1480}}.
