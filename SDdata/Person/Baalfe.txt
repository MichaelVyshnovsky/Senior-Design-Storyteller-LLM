'''Baalfe''' was a hireling guard who worked for [[Baldur's Mouth]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Watch yourself in there - sarky bastards, these writer types.''|Baalfe}}

==Description==
Baalfe was a [[human]] woman with light skin, dark brown eyes, and greying brown hair she wore gathered in a loose bun. Like her fellow guards, Baalfe wore [[chainmail]] armor, carried a simple [[shield]], and was armed with a [[mace]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Baalfe was employed by Baldur's Mouth and its editor-in-chief, [[Ettvard Needle]]. She was tasked with guarding the broadsheet's main entrance from unwanted visitors and critics of the gazette's editorial direction. Despite Baalfe's disdain for the "writer types," she still preferred working in front of the Baldur's Mouth to guarding the rancid [[fish]] stench-ridden docks.
