        "History": "In life, Brysis was a great sorcerer in [[Netheril]]. On the day of her death, she was interred in a floating tomb.\n\nAfter the fall of Netheril, Brysis's tomb plummeted into a crevasse and wound up in the [[Underdark]] region of the Silken Paths, where it remained for centuries.\n\nMagical energies awoke Brysis from the eternal sleep of death as a wraith, served by [[specter]]s who were once her loyal retainers. \n\nA party of adventurers escaping [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]] with help of [[Fargas Rumblefoot]] may have defeated her."
