        "mainbody": "Raynaar Marliir was the head of the Marliir noble family of Arabel in Cormyr in the 1360s DR.\nAs a landlord, he was seen as benevolent to tenant farmers. He also maintained good relations with most merchant companies, excepting the more exploitative ones.\nAround 1367 DR, Raynaar was more often at the familys seat in Arabel than at the Royal Court in Suzail, owing to the familys focus on improving its own power base, not in intrigues of the court.\nCirca 1370 DR, he was married to Duchess Merelda Marliir.\nIn the , Lord Raynaar and Lady Terese Marliir attended a birthday feast for King Azoun IV, and spent the night as guests of Lord Partic Thistle at his manor, Thistleflame Keep. They knew nothing about Lord Thistles apparent murder that evening."
