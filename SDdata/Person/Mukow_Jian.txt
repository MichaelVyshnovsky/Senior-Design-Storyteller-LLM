Baron '''Mukow Jian''' was a noble of the town of [[Pim Tung]] in [[Tabot]] around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.

==History==
Although born to the noble class of Tabot, Baron Mukow Jian Thus, he engaged in certain illicit activities, including building a secret rebel army, the [[Vian-chi]].

At some point, in the city of [[Motra]], Mukow bought the slave girl [[Holang]] for her beauty, before she was of marriageable age. Bringing her to Pim Tung, he made her a house slave, but later took her as his third wife.

When Mukow caught Holang spying on his secret activities, he threatened to kill her, but she saved herself by giving him better and more honest counsel than any of his advisors, thanks to her T'u Lung education and frank speech. Mukow let her live and started consulting her in secret, and thanks to her he found successes.

In time, Holang was Mukow's favored wife and he chose his son with her as his heir. By 2607, Lady Holang had complete control over Pim Tung and commanded her own spies and warriors, and still had greater ambitionsâ€”nothing less than the overthrow of the High Lord of Oceans [[Ning D'Ahn]] himself and turning Tabot into an empire, with Mukow as its emperor, and she its empress.
