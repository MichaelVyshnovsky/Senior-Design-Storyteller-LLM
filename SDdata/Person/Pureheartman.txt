Pureheartman was a shaman of the Black Raven tribe of the Uthgardt.
He was described as being of noble bearing, tall, slender, and usually dressed in a cape of flowing black feathers.
In 1370 DR, he and his assistant Wulphegar were the only shamans tolerated within the Black Raven tribe.
He was secretly a member of the Host Tower of the Arcane and did what he could to oppose the plots of Dendybar and Eldeluc, and others of dubious nature.
He worshiped Mystra and the Great Raven.
