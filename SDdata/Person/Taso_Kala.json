        "History": "Around [[1369 DR]], she crushed a sect of [[Ghaunadaur]] worshipers, but fled to the south-east of Ust Natha. She may have asked [[Gorion's Ward]] and companions to perform a service for her, which was apparently demanded by [[Lolth]]. The service was to destroy the sect completely, which was led by a high priest and the mage [[Relonar]]. She would, however, give no reward, apart from allowing the adventurers' continued existence."
