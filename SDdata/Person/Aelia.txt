'''Goodwoman Aelia''' was a healer and herbalist in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/No Foolish Matter|7}}

==History==
At one point, Aelia settled in the small Moonsea village of [[Hillpicket]].

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], a mysterious illness spread in the area and Aelia believed that the cause was the wandering [[Doctor Jubal's Carnival of Curiosities]], which had just then also arrived in Hillpicket. She tried to convince some adventurers who happened to be in the village to help her to uncover the truth, believing all the villagers to be accomplices of the carnival.

She decided to infiltrate the carnival herself to investigate. However, she was captured and replaced with a mirror duplicate of her afflicted with madness.{{Cite adventurers league/No Foolish Matter|13}}

Aelia was imprisoned inside the mirror maze together with [[Berl Cuttler]], Doctor [[Jubal]], [[Weet Greenspen]], and others.{{Cite adventurers league/No Foolish Matter|14}} 
 
==Personality==
Aelia was kind of eccentric. She always saw [[demon]]s and conspiracy around her, usually mistakenly.
