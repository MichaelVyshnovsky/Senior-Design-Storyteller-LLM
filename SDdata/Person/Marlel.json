        "mainbody": "'''Marlel''', known as the '''The Dark Blade of Doom''', was an infamous [[assassin]] of [[Scornubel]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a retainer for the [[Cult of the Dragon]], but also a [[Harper]].",
        "Personality": "Marlel was pleased by the slaying of malevolent mages and potential rivals. He seized short-term pleasures wherever the opportunity rose{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|110-113|7}} Also, he was cautious and hard to catch unaware.",
        "Abilities": "Not merely an ace with the blade, Marlel had a number of skills, including disguise and sewing, though his expertise regarding [[blandreth]]s was limited. A number of wenches attested he did everything well. The Dark Blade of Doom was also capable of wielding [[wand]]s.",
        "Relationships": "Marlel was on retainer for the Cult of the Dragon, through [[Thoadrin]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|65|4}} He claimed to have business with [[Orthil Voldovan]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|54-62|4}}",
        "Possessions": "Marlel hid daggers on his person. He wore a [[ring]] that carried [[spell]]s, and always hid a few needles and waxed thread on a shoe. He was furnished with a number of \"masks\", which could be damaged in combat, and which cost at least five [[quara]]. He also carried on himself an [[armorweave]] bag. The assassin was paid a hefty retainer by the Dragon Cult and bore a ''[[Harper pin]]''.",
        "Appearance": "Marlel's sly expression somewhat resembled [[Torm (adventurer)|Torm]]'s. He was black-haired, when out of costume.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|50-51|3}}",
        "Reputation": "His reputation as the Dark Blade of Doom had reached the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]],{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|273|16}}",
        "History": "Marlel claimed to have worked with a Red Wizard in [[Triel]] prior to 1357 DR.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|310-312|18}} By the end of that year, he had been in Scornubel for about five seasons, through which he'd become a retainer for the Cult of the Dragon. He had at some point delivered \"doom\" upon a number of [[Sembians]], presumably during those five seasons.\n\nLate in the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, Marlel met with Thoadrin, a Dragon Cult operative in Scornubel. Along the way, he was attacked by three people, and slew all of them. Marlel was able to correctly ascertain he was going to be ordered to hunt for ''[[spellfire]]''; his payment consisted of fifty [[Calimshan]] [[rubies]], with fifty more to be paid upon completion.\n\nHe caught up with the ''spellfire'' wielder [[Shandril Shessair]] in the Scornubian inn known as [[the Sun over Scornubel]], assisting her when a number of Zhentarim swordsmen tried to capture her.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|51|3}} After aiding her in her escape, he led her towards [[the Stormy Tankard]], where he brought her and her husband, [[Narm Tamaraith]], to the local Harpers, and then to an ambush with numerous wizards. They employed spells against Shandril and Narm, knocking him out, but then Shandril slew them all. Marlel was able to convince her he had no part in the ambush; however the laying of Marlel's ambush was known to [[Tornar]], who later reported to Belgon Bradaskor that it had failed. The Dark Blade of Doom showed her to her room, and then pointed out Orthil Voldovan, whom she was seeking, in the common room of the inn.\n\nMarlel entered Orthil Voldovan's caravan disguised as a religious [[pilgrim]] paying for covered passage to [[Waterdeep]], concerned with his own piety and unable to use holy magic, who had nonetheless declined to name the [[god]] that was the reason for his pilgrimage. While in the caravan, he lured [[Haransau Olimer]] and his assistant to another wagon, which he destroyed with a couple spells, killing Haransau in the process; he then impersonated Haransau Olimer.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|102|7}} He was able to stitch his fake belly back together quickly, successfully fooling [[Arauntar]] and [[Beldimarr]] with his disguise.\n\nDuring his time impersonating the blandreth-dealer, Marlel spread some rumors to make obstacles for the other rogues in the caravan, bringing up the clinking of the wagon on which [[Mhegras]] and [[Sabran]] traveled to ensure they were searched.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|144|9}} While spying, he bore witness to Narm slaying a man who attempted to ambush him in the night; Marlel considered the dying man to be a Thayan agent.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|178|11}} Later, Marlel slew a Zhentarim disguised as a merchant during one ambush.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|216|13}} During another ambush, [[Stlarakur]], a Zhentarim priest of [[Bane]], thought to take refuge in Haransau Olimer's wagon. Marlel took the opportunity to brain the man with a blandreth, and left his body at the wagon's entrance, with one arm outside to deter anyone else from taking refuge there.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|234-235|14}}\n\nWhile the caravan remained at Triel, the Dark Blade of Doom was contacted by a voice out of thin air; he chose to heed it, and it gave him a mission.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|302|17}} Once the caravan arrived at Triel, Marlel took a moment to meet with [[Hulrivior]] and his underlings; he introduced himself as having worked with a Red Wizard sometime prior in Triel, and offered them spellfire. While their guard was down, he threw a gem into a flame hovering on the table atop the meeting room, leading to a terrible explosion, which almost certainly killed Hulrivior, per Marlel's understanding. He then used wands to execute any survivors, claiming it was another Red Wizard that hired him to slay them. [[Hesperdan]] claimed responsibility for Marlel being in possession of such magic.\n\nMarlel attempted to wield an unspecified [[wand]] of some flame power against Shandril while she was undergoing meltdown. One of his spell blows was blocked by [[Mirt]], who threw himself in the way; this won Shandril enough time that she was ready for his next attack, and returned ''spellfire'' along its way, killing Marlel instantly."
