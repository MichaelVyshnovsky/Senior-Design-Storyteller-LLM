Thelorn was a human man and the proprietor of Thelorns Safe Journeys in Red Larch.
Thelorn was a former mercenary who became a skilled wheelwright. He had money invested in not only his business in Red Larch, but also in real estate in Waterdeep. He was assisted by fifteen, very loyal, skilled carpenters who were all lesser fighters.
Thelorn was grim, yet capable.
Red Larch locals thought Thelorn had hidden wealth beneath his fortified house. There were rumors that specifically named an undercellar that could only be reached through one of the three chimneys in Thelorns home.
