        "Description": "Ilkin lived in the forested areas ([[Westwood]] and [[Kryptgarden Forest]]) not far from Amphail and his face showed the years of exposure to the elements. His hands were like knotted wood and he was thin and wiry. His hair tended to fly free and, as of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, it was more gray than not. He favored plain robes and boots. He had green eyes that glowed like a lamp when his ire was roused.",
        "Possessions": "He carried a [[staff]] made from a tree branch that always sprouted green shoots and leaves.",
        "Activities": "Ilkin was one of the senior members of the [[church of Mielikki]] in the vicinity of Amphail and was often involved in preparations for the Rite of the Stag Lass celebrated every year in that village."
