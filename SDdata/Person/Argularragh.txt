'''Argularragh''' was a [[dragon]] who lived in the realm of [[Eskorn]], [[Laerakond]], in the centuries before the [[Spellplague]].

==Description==
Argularragh was a massive dragon, even by dragon standards.

==History==
Argularragh was the ruler of the castle of [[Argul]], in Eskorn, where it lorded over a commune of [[dragonborn]] slaves. However, one day Argularragh simply vanished without a trace. Most of the other Eskornar dragon lords believed Argularragh was killed by a rival during a sea battle and its body was lost in the waters, but a few of them believed that Argularragh was either trapped inside a [[magical item]], or that the dragon learned how to change shape and went to live its remaining days as a member of another race. The few individuals who believed this tale, also believed Argularragh was still alive as of [[1479 DR]].
