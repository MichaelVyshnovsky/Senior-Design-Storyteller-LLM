        "mainbody": "'''Variel''' was an employee of [[Sa'Sani]]'s [[Mercantile House]] that operated in the [[Crossroad Keep]] in the late  14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|If we had the resources, we could hire a group of people to do nothing but tell other people about how great we are - how we offer the highest quality goods in the Sword Coast, things like that. People hear that enough, and Im sure they'll want to deal with us over our competitors!|Variel}}",
        "Description": "Variel was a [[half-elven]] woman with a light skin tone, blonde hair cut in a bob, and icy blue eyes. She was slender and youthful in appearance. Variel's excitement for her job was barely masked by her professional demeanor. She preferred to wear red and maroon [[robe]]s.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Crossroad Keep was recovered and rebuilt by the allies of [[Neverwinter]]. Soon after, two merchants, [[Il'foss]] and [[Kizu]], purchased a building in the reopened keep to be used as the headquarters of their trading company. They had big plans to \"change the [[Sword Coast]].\" They hired Variel to serve as the company's majordomo and put her in charge of the home office, as well as allowing her to do trading on the organization's behalf. Soon after she arrived at Crossroad Keep, Variel was tasked with managing the company's few shipments. Il'foss and Kizu grew frustrated with the business being slow; however, when a word game of two massive shipments was sent their way. Variel was never given any details on the nature of the shipments, and she was too happy for the business to look into it. When the shipments reached Crossroad Keep, Il'foss insisted on accompanying one of the shipments to Neverwinter, never to return, and soon after, the second shipment and Kizu disappeared as well. With no leadership, Variel was left alone to keep the headquarters operating.\n\nWhen merchant [[Sa'Sani]], Il'foss' and Kizu's partner, took over the abandoned headquarters, Variel joined the [[Mercantile House]] as the majordomo of Crossroad Keep. She was the point of contact between the forces of Neverwinter, the [[Greycloaks]], as well as the [[Church of Waukeen]], organizing donations, investments, and paying for upgrades to the Keep and its allies on behalf of the Mercantile House. Variel showed initiative in promising the [[cleric]] of [[Waukeen]] named [[Daija]] to build a shrine to her goddess in Crossroad Keep in exchange for the deity's ''[[bless]]ing''. She also maintained the relationship with the [[gnome]]s of [[Lantan]], on Sa'Sani's behalf, and [[Orias]], who operated a ''[[portal]]'' that connected Crossroad Keep to a secret and illegal logging camp in [[Samarach]] via the ''[[Lantan-Samarach portal]]''. With time, she hoped to have enough [[coin]] to expand the ''portal's'' function, connecting the headquarters to other locations across [[Toril]]. Another initiative of Variel's was to connect Sa'Sani's Mercantile House with her contact in Neverwinter, which could provide the Greycloaks with improved arms and armor to secure the trade routes around the keep."
