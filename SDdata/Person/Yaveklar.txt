'''Yaveklar''' was a [[githyanki]] commander in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century DR, a group of githyanki led by [[Al'chaia]] arrived at the [[Crystal Labyrinth]] while tracking down a colony of [[mind flayer]]s in the level of [[Seadeeps]]. Upon discovery of the [[portal]] leading to [[Stardock]], they converted the abandoned asteroid into a crèche for the breeding and training of young githyanki, which they named Crèche K'liir. The labyrinth was converted into a fortress from where they led attacks against the mind flayers and protected their access to Stardock.

Around the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], Yaveklar was leading a strike force inside Seadeep itself.

==Activities==
Yaveklar commanded the githyanki stronghold while waiting for reinforcements in order to carry out the final assault against the illithids. She was concerned with how to defeat the [[neothelid]].

==Relationships==
Yaveklar, as senior knight, was leader of the strike force but her young second-in-command [[Lashiir]] believed her too cautious and wanted to depose her.

==Personality==
After suffering heavy losses among her troops, Yaveklar had become very cautious. Nevertheless, she wanted to personally wipe out the illithids.
