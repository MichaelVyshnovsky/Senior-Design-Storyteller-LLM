Yaveklar was a githyanki commander in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Sometime in the late 15 century DR, a group of githyanki led by Alchaia arrived at the Crystal Labyrinth while tracking down a colony of mind flayers in the level of Seadeeps. Upon discovery of the portal leading to Stardock, they converted the abandoned asteroid into a crèche for the breeding and training of young githyanki, which they named Crèche Kliir. The labyrinth was converted into a fortress from where they led attacks against the mind flayers and protected their access to Stardock.
Around the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR, Yaveklar was leading a strike force inside Seadeep itself.
Yaveklar commanded the githyanki stronghold while waiting for reinforcements in order to carry out the final assault against the illithids. She was concerned with how to defeat the neothelid.
Yaveklar, as senior knight, was leader of the strike force but her young second-in-command Lashiir believed her too cautious and wanted to depose her.
After suffering heavy losses among her troops, Yaveklar had become very cautious. Nevertheless, she wanted to personally wipe out the illithids.
