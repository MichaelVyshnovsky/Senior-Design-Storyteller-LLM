Oka Yoshinaka was a retainer of the Goshukara clan in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
In 1357 DR, Yoshinaka and Mashida Kowa clashed with the Gamo brothers, Hidenobu, Mitsutoshi and Mochikuni.
Yoshinaka was a very handsome but modest young man. Thank to the influence of his brother, Oka Sanai, he inherited his sound wisdom and showed great promise as a warrior-scholar.
Yoshinaka valued and cared for his appearance (knowing it to be a great asset) but he did not let it get the better of him.
