'''Rashara''' was a [[cambion]] servant of the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Waydown|20}}
 
==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Graz'zt exiled the twins [[Gattash]] and Rashara for some failures, sending them to the [[Waydown]] area. Here, however, the cambion twins, using ''[[fiendish charm]]'' and ''[[alter self]]'' [[spell]]s, managed to gain the worship of a tribe of madness-infected [[kuo-toa]], who believed them to be gods. Impressed, Graz'zt sent the [[hezrou]] [[Toad (demon)|Toad]] to serve them.

Gattash and Rashara planned to destroy the [[Red Plumes]] garrison inside the Waydown and go back to the court of the demon lord. They started sending some [[octopus]]es to attack Red Plume patrols.{{Cite adventurers league/The Waydown|5}}

With their kuo-toa minions, they resided in the [[Shrine of Twofold Sin]] in a luxury room they termed their Sanctum of Sin. However, they were killed by some adventurers hired by [[Arrizz]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Waydown|23}}
