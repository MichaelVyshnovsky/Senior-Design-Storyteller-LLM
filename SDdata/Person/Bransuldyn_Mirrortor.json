Often he used his collection of disguises and went unnoticed in the city gathering lore and listening. Then, using some personally created spells, Bransuldyn recorded what he had learned.\nRumors said that Bransuldyn still adventured and he had found passages to the Underdark, where he had put his treasure, which was protected by a deadly trap."
