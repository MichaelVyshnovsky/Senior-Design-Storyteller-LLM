Vaeren Dragonskorn was a sky pirate.
Vaeren had managed to repair an old Halruaan skyship that he used for his business.
In 1480 DR, Simbul went to Dragonskorns sky ship asking for a blueflame item. He instead ordered his crew to kill her but in the end the Simbul killed Dragonskorn.
Vaeren considered himself not a pirate but a "skys adventurer".
