Dai Rolno was a Morninglord of Amaunator that visited the Wheloon Prison in the late 15 century DR during the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon.
Dai was a light-skinned human woman with orange-red hair tied into two braids. She wore a set of sun-decorated chainmail, and carried a buckler and mace-like holy symbol of Amaunator.
Dai saw Wheloon Prison as a failure of justice, especially for the innocents trapped inside.
