==History==
Prior to the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Korvan had been a cook at the [[Castle Obarskyr]] of [[Suzail]]. However, he got in trouble there by trying to charm some ladies with a magical philter; though the philter was not authentic, his seller was an informant for the [[War Wizards]], and after a stern talking to, he was frightened into departing Suzail for other places. He continued to work jobs in [[Sembia]] for a while, until he arrived at [[The Rising Moon (inn)|the Rising Moon]] in [[Highmoon]], where he remained in employment for a long time, under [[Gorstag]], the tavern's owner.

Korvan habitually abused the owner's foster daughter, Shandril Shessair.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|208-209|11}} He passed on this information to an agent.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|221-222|11}}
