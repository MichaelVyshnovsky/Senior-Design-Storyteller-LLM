'''Bastinado''' was a [[ranger]], [[adventurer]], and a member of the [[Annals of Halgren]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Bastinado was a large muscular [[human]] male who had an affinity with animals and wielded large [[sword]]s in battle. He was a relentless optimist.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, Bastinado has traveled all across the Realms and wore many hats. He's experienced the lives of pirates, fishers, mercenaries, tinkers, south, and foresters. He learned to handle almost all types of weapons and developed his monstrous strength and endurance. 

Eventually, Bastinado found himself in the city of [[Luskan]], where he joined the Annals of Halgren. The adventuring troupe searched for mercenaries, and the ranger happily joined. His personality became the cornerstone of the new adventuring group. In battle, Bastinado learned to take the left side of the team's gruff [[dwarven]] leader â€“ [[Halgren Death's Head]], becoming the symbolic sword of the group. Halgren's wife, [[Alia Shield-Maiden]], who was the group's "[[shield]]".
