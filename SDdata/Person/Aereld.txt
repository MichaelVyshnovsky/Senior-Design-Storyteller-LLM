==Relationships==
He was a trusted steward of the [[Windstag]] family.

==History==
In the aftermath of the massacre at the [[Council of the Dragon]] of [[Cormyr]] in late [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlink|1479}}, Aereld reported to Broryn Windstag and his guest at [[Staghaven House]], [[Irlin Stonestable]], that word on the street was that King [[Foril Obarskyr I]] had been killed in the massacre, and that Cormyr was at war after all the nobles were butchered. Before Lord Windstag could cross-examine him, he was interrupted by the arrival of [[Mellast Ormblade]] and [[Sacrast Handragon]] at Staghaven.

He later interrupted the lords to announce the arrival of [[Traevyn Illance]], who dismissed him with a hand signal before discussing any more.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|132-133|14}}
