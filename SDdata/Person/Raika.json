        "mainbody": "'''Raika''' was a [[half-orc]] [[barbarian]] and adventurer of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description": "Raika wore war paint over her face, and sometimes a [[helmet]]. The strong half-orc fought with [[spear]]s or [[warhammer]]s, and dressed in barbarian garb, made from creatures of her surroundings, such as [[snake]]s and [[bear]]s.",
        "Personality": "Raika wielded her rage with restraint, letting it out when the opportunity for a decisive blow presented itself. Her personal mission was to find like-minded warriors to lead and inspire, but she sometimes struggled to stay on her path after countless battles. She strive to sustain balance in her life as she moved between Waterdeep and the wilderness.",
        "Possessions": "During her time in service of [[Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Raika had an arsenal of mundane and magical weapons at her disposal, including the ''[[Great Wolf's Fury]]'', the ''[[Manticore's Tail]]'', a ''[[bulette-claw spear]]'', a ''[[yeti-bone hammer]]'', and the unique ''[[maul of focused destruction]]''. She further carried several [[magic items]], notably a ''[[ring of healing]]'', ''[[elixir of defense|elixirs of defense]]'', a pair of ''[[indomitable gloves]]'', the ''[[seal of harmony]]'', and her precious ''[[ioun stone of regeneration]]''.\n\nShe wore armor fashioned from the hide and claws of an ancient [[owlbear]] which she had once bested, and a headpiece adorned with mementos of that battle. She later acquired a custom [[helmet]] from Laeral Silverhand known as the ''[[Great Wolf's Mark]]''.",
        "History": "As a child, the half-orc was abandoned in the [[Spine of the World]]. However, she was found and raised by the [[Tribe of the Wolf|Wolf Tribe]]. After growing up under the guidance of her tribe, Raika reached maturity and headed out to other places across [[Faer√ªn]]. Her first great victory came against an ancient and legendary owlbear in [[Lurkwood]], which she slew and then claimed its claws, hide, and skull as pieces of her armor.\n\nAt some point during her travels, Raika clashed with a a [[yuan-ti malison]] overlord in [[Chult]]. She slew the creature twice in the same battle after which the barbarian claimed the yuan-ti's ''ioun stone of regeneration''.\n\nUltimately, Raika wished to create her own tribe of warriors, which she would lead. Raika believed she had found those worthy enough in Waterdeep."
