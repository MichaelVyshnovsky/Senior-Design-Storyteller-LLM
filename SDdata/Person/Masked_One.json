        "mainbody": "The '''Masked One''' was a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] and a necromancer in [[1358 DR]].",
        "History": "The Masked One was a powerful wizard who tried to change the interests of the School of Necromancy from the destruction of [[Rashemen]] to other goals. Due to this, he came into conflict with [[Zulkir]] [[Szass Tam]], so he hid himself in his castle to do research. He also staged an apparent disaster in his spell laboratory, which reportedly weakened him and left him disfigured, thus becoming \"the Masked One\".\n\nIn truth, he was plotting how to ruin Tam. He created a spell capable of dissolving the person and subsuming the powers of anyone his most secret spell could envelop. He killed some Red Wizards, becoming very powerful.\n\nWhen, in 1358 DR, the [[Time of Troubles]] started, the Masked One saw a unique occasion to gain a god's power. So he began secretly hunting the [[avatar]] of [[Hoar]].\n\nHowever the Overgod [[Ao]] sent [[Elminster Aumar]] to stop the Masked One."
