        "mainbody": "Aslyn Belark was a member of the Belark merchant family in Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR.\nAslyn was the youngest of Oldyle Belarks three sons and was very much like his older brother Corauth. He had a sadistic streak and was haughty enough to feel he could indulge his whims, especially when Corauth set the example.\n__NOTOC__\nAslyn and his older brother Corauth were free to act almost with impunity around Delzimmer, rousting about town and maliciously making the lives of the common folk miserable."
