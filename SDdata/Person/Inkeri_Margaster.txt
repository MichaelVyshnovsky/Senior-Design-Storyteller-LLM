Lady '''Inkeri Margaster''' was the leader of [[House Margaster]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During his time as [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep, [[Dagult Neverember]] with the complicity of Inkeri, stole millions from Waterdeep's reserve.

In the {{YearlinkName|1488}}, Lady Inkeri allied with the [[drow]] of [[House Hunzrin]] and together they managed a business involving [[Demon|demonic]] [[phylacteries]].

In early 1488 DR, in [[Neverwinter]], the [[halfling]] [[rogue]] [[Regis]] spied on the mysterious agreement between Lord Dagult Neverember and Lady Inkeri involving the fate of the [[Thornhold]] fortress. Some time later, Regis met Lady Inkeri and her cousin [[Alvilda Margaster]] at the [[Driftwood Tavern]] near [[Neverwinter]]. The Margasters held a party and during the dances Regis gained some useful information from his dance partner Alvilda about Inkeri's plots, and also managed to witness the demonic possession of Inkeri. Afterward, [[Charri Hunzrin]] convinced Inkeri to ally with Matron Mother [[Zhindia Melarn]] against [[Drizzt]] and [[Zaknafein]].

Later that year, Alvilda gave birth to a child named [[Charon|Sharon]], who appeared somehow corrupted, perhaps as a result of the family's trade in demonic phylacteries. Their conflict came to a head when Alvilda and Inkeri managed to capture Regis and [[Dahlia Sin'felle]], who had infiltrated the Margaster estate in [[Waterdeep]]. Instigated by Sharon, the two cousins fully transformed into demons, with Alvilda becoming a [[bar-lgura]] and fought each other, until Alvilda beheaded Inkeri.

==Relationships==
Inkeri was the leader of the Margasters living in Waterdeep. Her main collaborators were her brother, Brevindon; and her cousin, Alvilda. She and Alvilda grew very close to each other, even considering each other sisters instead of cousins.

Inkeri housed inside herself the demonic phylactery of a [[bar-lgura]] follower of [[Demogorgon]], in truth not a simple bar-lgura but [[Bar-lgura (individual)|Bar-lgura]], the namesake of the whole demonic race.
