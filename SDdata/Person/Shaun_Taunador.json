        "mainbody": "'''Shaun Taunador''' was one of the primary [[mind flayer]] merchants of [[Ch'Chitl]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Shaun originated when an illithid tadpole was [[Ceremorphosis|implanted]] in the body of a [[quaggoth]] [[shaman]]; this rare choice for a host stemmed from a time when there were lack of more suitable hosts. However, Shaun possessed incredible psychic powers and was a giant among illithid kind.\n\nShaun Taunador became one of the [[Skullport]]'s primary sellers of illicit substances, usually potions, painkillers, and poisons. Although it conducted business from a barge moored at the docks or from rented rooms in Skullport, and most thought it dwelled there, in truth it [[teleport]]ed home to Ch'Chitl every day after finishing work."
