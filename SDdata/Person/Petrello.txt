'''Petrello''' was a misguided [[halfling]] [[bard]] who was infatuated with the [[wild elf]] chieftain [[Kyleena Moonglow]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

{{quote|I'm afraid the operas are all still in my head... You see, I'm not particularly good at transposing music to paper... I'm not what you might call "classically trained."|Petrello the Magnificent}}

==Description==
Petrello wore his reddish-brown hair in a ponytail and dressed in smart, fanciful clothes. He always tried to inflate his importance and exaggerate his talents.

==Possessions==
Petrello was armed with an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[double-bladed sword]].

==History==
Petrello came across Kyleena Moonglow's tribe after she guided them to the [[Lonely Barrens]] outside of [[Daggerford]] and attempted to claim the land as her own. The hin musician relentlessly pursued the wild elf's affection and convinced himself he was Kyleena Moonglow's "court composer." In reality, Kyleena found the halfling entertaining and almost annoying, allowing him to stay with the tribe as long as he amused her tribe with his poor musical skills. Despite Petrello's incessant practice, Kyleena did not consider him her "court composer" nor a member of the tribe. The bard claimed to have composed entire operas dedicated to his Queen. However, none of the operas were completed nor put on paper.

In 1372 DR, a piece of music sheet landed on the halfling's head when he was on his morning stroll. The paper was ''[[The Song of Breaking]]'' that was recently lost while being transported along the [[Trade Way]]. Petrello tried to sway Kyleena using the new piece of music unsuccessfully. Subsequently, the [[Hero of Daggerford]] came knocking in search for the unique magical music sheet on the behest of [[Vladmyr]], a collector from Daggerford. Petrello greedily attempted to leverage a high price for the item, but his negotiating skills were just as lacking as his musical skills were. The hero claimed the scroll, paying measly 100 [[gold]] [[coin]]s, while Petrello claimed he memorized the songs by heart. However, Petrello quickly realized that he did not remember a note. Following Kyleena Moonglow's departure from the Lonely Barrens, Petrello's whereabouts were unknown.
