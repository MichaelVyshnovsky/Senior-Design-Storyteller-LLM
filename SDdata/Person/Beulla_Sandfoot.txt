{{Quote|''Just discussing the weather, dearie. Nothing of interest to you.''|Beulla Sandfoot}}
==Description==
She was a [[hin]] woman with a fair skin tone, blue eyes, and blonde hair. She wore simple garb consisting of a navy blue jacket, brown trousers, and a light blouse.
==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Beulla could be found with her co-conspirator, the [[half-orc]] [[Fyrd Nuugh]] in the Lower City near one of the docks. Their meeting place was a seaside gazebo, where they discussed the Guild and [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] while pretending to simply discuss the weather if unwelcome listeners were near.
