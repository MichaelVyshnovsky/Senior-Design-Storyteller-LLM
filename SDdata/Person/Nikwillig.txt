'''Nikwillig''' was a [[Citadel Felbarr|Felbarran]] [[dwarf]] cobbler and a traveling companion of [[Tred McKnuckles]]. After his trading party were killed in an orc ambush, the two mortally wounded found refuge in the town of [[Clicking Heels]]. After their departure, the town fell victim to an orc raid orchestrated by [[Obould|Obould Many-Arrows]]. Nikwillig vowed to avenge the people of Clicking Heels and quickly allied with [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] after their return from [[Mirabar]].

He helped [[Nanfoodle Buswilligan]] with [[giant]]s on the ridge facing [[Mithral Hall|Keeper's Dale]] in [[1370 DR]]. He was tasked in setting the explosive box that would trigger Nanfoodle's gas explosion when met with the impact of [[Catti-brie|Catti-Brie]]'s arrow. Due to this, he was unable to join the greater retreat into [[Mithral Hall]] and was left stranded.<ref>[[R.A. Salvatore]] (June 2004). '''''The Lone Drow'''''.

After this he marched for the [[River Surbrin|Surbrin River]]. Cold, injured, and hungry he walked aimlessly until encountering a [[goblin]] encampment. Starving, he attacked the goblin chef, bringing more goblins. He jumped into the Surbrin, but not before being struck by a spear to the foot.<ref>[[R.A. Salvatore]] (September 2005). '''''The Two Swords'''''. ([[Wizards of the Coast]]), chap. 3. ISBN [[Special:BookSources/0-7869-3790-4|0-7869-3790-4]]. 

He could speak [[Orc (language)|Orcish]].
