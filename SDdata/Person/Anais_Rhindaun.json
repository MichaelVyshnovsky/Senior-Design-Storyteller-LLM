        "mainbody": "Queen '''Anais'''  of [[Tethyr]] ruled over the kingdom from the [[Court of the Crimson Leaf]], during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]],",
        "Relationship": "Anais was of the [[Rhindaun Dynasty]]. She was the granddaughter of [[Reinhold]]. \n\nThe Queen had a half-sister [[Evonne Linden]], who had two children: Anais' nephew [[Teague Linden|Teague]] and her niece [[Ysabel Linden|Ysabel]]. Following Evonne's death, Anais adopted Ysabel as her own and named the young child her heir.",
        "Activities": "Anais reigned from the palace of [[Faerntarn]] in the capital city of [[Darromar]]. In the capital she was protected by soldiers belonging to the [[Order of the Tempest Stahl]].\n\nShe ruled through her dukes, counts, and, more visibly, her sheriffs, whom she appointed directly to maintain law and order. Anais herself handled affairs of state and maintained a sizeable military in Darromar. She was advised by the Royal Council, which included Ysabel Linden.",
        "History": "Anais ascended as Queen of Tethyr in the {{YearlinkName|1468}}, a few months after the death of her sister Evonne's husband [[Garion Linden]]. She did not have an easy beginning to her reign as monarch however. Within the first year of her rule, Evonne tried to take the throne for hew own. The sisters made amends and continued on in relative peace with one another for a time. \n\nTragedy struck Tethyr the [[1469 DR|following year]]. Anais' nephew and many scores of innocents were slaughtered in the [[Winter Palace]] by [[elves]] of the [[Wealdath]], a tragedy that came to be known as the [[Children's Massacre]]. Evonne's daughter Ysabel as one of only three survivors. Queen Anais and Evonne managed to avoid the massacre, as their retinue was waylaid in [[Celleu]] due to an unnatural fog that inhibited travel. While both sisters avoid the mass-killing, Evonne was not as fortunate as her sister and was slain by assassins that very night.\n\nOne of the massacre's other survivors, [[Declan Cardew]] the so-called \"Hero of the Realm\", earned the queen's good graces by \"saving\" her niece Ysabel.\n\nAnais' own grandfather, Reinhold, blamed her for the catastrophe and created the [[Branch of Linden]], a political faction that overthrow the queen and install Ysabel Linden on the throne. After several skirmishes between the queen's army and the Branch of Linden, with the last and worst on the [[Ebenspy Plateau]], the rebels retreated into [[Ebenspy Keep]]. After several days of siege, half of them died with a coughing sickness and the queen's soldiers broke the siege and seized the castle, defeating the Branch of Linden. The leaders were hanged before the High Palace at [[Darromar]].\n\nYet the organization survived and was resurgent in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.―who had recently come of age―and Tresco Manyard would act as the regent behind the veil. Their plot was ultimately unsuccessful however. Evonne Linden had managed to survive the Children's Massacre through the use of horrifying [[blood magic]], and the body of an [[Ysabel Linden|innocent child]].\n\nQueen Anais remained in power throughout the 1480s, well into the {{YearlinkName|1489}}."
