Alurah bint Asrah was the Sultana of Hiyal in 1367 DR.
She was considered a wise a fair ruler by some, while others thought of her as a dark-hearted schemer.
Alurah was in her 60s in 1367 and in a poor state of health.
Alurahs husband, then the sultan, died suddenly in 1362 DR during a dinner. She was able to convince her allies in Huzuz, Prince Tannous al-Assad chief among them, that she alone could quell the chaos that ensued after her husbands death.
