In the , shortly before the armies of the Cult of the Absolute attacked the city of Baldurs Gate, Lady Alia Durinbold was a Parliamentarian of the Gate and voted in support of crowning lowborn Lord Enver Gortash as the citys Archduke. Lady Durinbold was present for Gortashs coronation that took place in the audience hall of Wyrms Rock. Following the coronation, Lady Durinbold expressed her support of Enver Gortash as she trusted Duke Ulder Ravengards judgement.
