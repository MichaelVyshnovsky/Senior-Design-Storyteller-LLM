'''Mirabeta Selkirk''' was an influential countess of [[Sembia]] who briefly served as its Overmistress during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Born into the wealth of the [[Selkirk]] family, Mirabeta was a truly evil person who was interested only in power, and was even involved with the [[slave]] trade with her children and grandchildren.

==Activities==
Mirabeta decided to invest in the [[Six Coffers Market Priakos|Six Coffers Market]] trading house until she had a controlling interest. She also heavily funded the [[Church of Waukeen]] after it reestablished itself in Sembia.

==Relationships==
Mirabeta used her five children and her grandchildren as minions for her illegal dealings. She had a poor view of her cousin [[Kendrick Selkirk]]. Her main competitor for power inside the family was her nephew [[Miklos Selkirk|Miklos]]. 

As of 1374 DR, Mirabeta's niece [[Elyril Hraven]] served as her main advisor. She was attended by her house mage [[Rynon]].

Mirabeta had a contact among the [[Cult of the Dragon]], a merchant by the name of [[Morthan]]. 

==History==
Mirabeta gained power after the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, when her cousin Kendrick Selkirk was elected Overmaster. In contrast to his predecessor [[Elduth Yarmmaster]], Kendrick heavily depended on the help of his family, especially his eldest son Miklos Selkirk.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Kendrick was poisoned by [[Rivalen Tanthul]] of [[Thultanthar]]. Unaware of the circumstances of his death, Mirabeta acted in order to be elected the new Overmaster against [[Endren Corrinthal]] of [[Saerb]]. She became the first Overmistress in history. 

After the formal start of the [[Sembian Civil War]], she was also granted power as war regent in order to defeat the rebel towns of Saerb and [[Selgaunt]]. During the war, her army emerged victorious against Saerb. The tides of battle turned however, and her troops were defeated at the [[Battle of Selgaunt]], after the city received aid from the [[Princes of Shade]]. 

On [[Nightal 1]] of 1374 DR, Elyril Hraven revealed her true nature and summoned the [[Adumbral Calyx]] upon [[Ordulin]], unleashing the [[Shadowstorm]] upon the Realms. As the city was destroyed, everyone in the city fled for their lives. Mirabeta was killed by the [[shadowstuff]] that poured out from the [[Plane of Shadow]].
