Mirabeta Selkirk was an influential countess of Sembia who briefly served as its Overmistress during the late 14 century DR.
Born into the wealth of the Selkirk family, Mirabeta was a truly evil person who was interested only in power, and was even involved with the slave trade with her children and grandchildren.
Mirabeta decided to invest in the Six Coffers Market trading house until she had a controlling interest. She also heavily funded the Church of Waukeen after it reestablished itself in Sembia.
Mirabeta used her five children and her grandchildren as minions for her illegal dealings. She had a poor view of her cousin Kendrick Selkirk. Her main competitor for power inside the family was her nephew Miklos. 
As of 1374 DR, Mirabetas niece Elyril Hraven served as her main advisor. She was attended by her house mage Rynon.
Mirabeta had a contact among the Cult of the Dragon, a merchant by the name of Morthan. 
Mirabeta gained power after the , when her cousin Kendrick Selkirk was elected Overmaster. In contrast to his predecessor Elduth Yarmmaster, Kendrick heavily depended on the help of his family, especially his eldest son Miklos Selkirk.
In the , Kendrick was poisoned by Rivalen Tanthul of Thultanthar. Unaware of the circumstances of his death, Mirabeta acted in order to be elected the new Overmaster against Endren Corrinthal of Saerb. She became the first Overmistress in history. 
After the formal start of the Sembian Civil War, she was also granted power as war regent in order to defeat the rebel towns of Saerb and Selgaunt. During the war, her army emerged victorious against Saerb. The tides of battle turned however, and her troops were defeated at the Battle of Selgaunt, after the city received aid from the Princes of Shade. 
On Nightal 1 of 1374 DR, Elyril Hraven revealed her true nature and summoned the Adumbral Calyx upon Ordulin, unleashing the Shadowstorm upon the Realms. As the city was destroyed, everyone in the city fled for their lives. Mirabeta was killed by the shadowstuff that poured out from the Plane of Shadow.
