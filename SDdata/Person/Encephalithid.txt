The '''Encephalithid''' was the [[elder brain]] of [[Oryndoll]] in [[1370 DR]] and [[1372 DR]].

==Personality==
The Encephalithid did not have absolute authority over the community; instead, it led the [[Elder Concord]] and had an active role in the governing of the community. Its [[psionic]] powers were at a level unmatched by any other non-divine being in the [[Realms]].

==History==
The Encephalithid had lived for millennia. During the [[Time of Troubles]], [[Ilsensine]] manifested and used the Encephalithid as its avatar. After that occasion, the Encephalithid retained the pair of tentacles commonly associated with the avatar form of the Tentacled Lord.
