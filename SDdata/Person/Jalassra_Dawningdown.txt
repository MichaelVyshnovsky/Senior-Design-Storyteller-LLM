Jalassra Dawningdown was a noble in Suzail.
Around 1480 DR, she hired Drounan Harbrand and his partner Andarphisk Hawkspike to go to Castle Irlingstar in the Thunder Peaks on the eastern border of Cormyr to free her son Jeresson Dawningdown, a traitor and murderer. She was close to a fellow noble, Austrus Flambrant.
Later, she was confronted by Lady Rensharra Ironstave about the income tax she needed to pay to the King. Believing herself offended by Rensharras attitude, Lady Dawningdown later sent two men to beat her.
