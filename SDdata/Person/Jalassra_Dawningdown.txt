'''Jalassra Dawningdown''' was a noble in [[Suzail]].

==History==
Around [[1480 DR]], she hired [[Drounan Harbrand]] and his partner [[Andarphisk Hawkspike]] to go to [[Castle Irlingstar]] in the [[Thunder Peaks]] on the eastern border of [[Cormyr]] to free her son [[Jeresson Dawningdown]], a traitor and murderer. She was close to a fellow noble, [[Austrus Flambrant]].

Later, she was confronted by Lady [[Rensharra Ironstave]] about the income tax she needed to pay to the King. Believing herself offended by Rensharra's attitude, Lady Dawningdown later sent two men to beat her.
