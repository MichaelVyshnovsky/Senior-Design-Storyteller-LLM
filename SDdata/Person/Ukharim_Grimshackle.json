He was filthy and bedraggled like his brother.\nUkharim and his brother Bhevek Grimshackle opened Grimshackle Jail, where they took criminals whom they ransomed to the highest bidder.\nIn 1489 DR, Ukharim permitted, for some money, an adventuring party to interrogate Gray Patriotss member Rathene Fel. Afterward, however, in an attempted prison break, the corrupt jailer Iorg Brokenjaw took him hostage, but the adventurers resolved the situation."
