Windon Lumbus was a halfling boy in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Windon lived with his family at the Lumbus farm, near the village of The Stop.
Circa 1486 DR, a group of goblins wearing strange robes attacked the Lumbus farm, killing all the Lumbuses while they slept. Windon however managed to escape and hid himself in the barn among the surviving goats.
Windon trusted halflings and humans but was shy with other races. He knew much about goblins, as his uncle had told him many tales about them.
