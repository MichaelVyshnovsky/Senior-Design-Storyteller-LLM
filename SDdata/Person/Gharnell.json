However, his companions were slaughtered by the [[goblin]] and [[kobold]] followers of the mad [[half-elf]] mercenary [[Zarr]]. Gharnell was spared only for his knowledge of the [[Goblin language|Goblin]] and [[Draconic language]]s. Zarr ordered him to teach [[Common]] to the dimmer and most hostile of his supporters.",
