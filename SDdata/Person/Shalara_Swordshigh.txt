==Personality==
Quiet-spoken, Old Night Shalara said almost nothing in Council of 12 Peers meetings, except to provide lore and information on current situations in [[the North]]. She could perfectly recall and quote all the words spoken by the other Peers back at them, but played no favorites.  She merely strove for clarity in thought and argument.

==Possessions==
Shalara customarily wore ''[[bracers of armor]] +4'' and carried a rusty iron sphere (''[[iron bands of Bilarro]]'') at her belt.

Shalara was promoted to the office of Old Night after her predecessor, [[Haemar the Old]], died sometime between the [[1356 DR|Year of the Worm, 1356 DR]] and the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], She belonged to Lady [[Alustriel Silverhand]]'s [[Council of 12 Peers]] which helped rule the [[Silver Marches]] around [[1370 DR]]. If Lady Alustriel died, Old Night would act as High Lady until the Council voted on a new ruler of the Silver Marches.
