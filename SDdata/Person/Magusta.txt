'''Magusta''' was a powerful female [[malaugrym]] that was involved in the hunt for [[Shandril Shessair]] in [[1357 DR]]. At the end, she managed to get close to the girl posing as her [[dwarf]] friend [[Delg Hammerhand]] but was killed by [[Torm (adventurer)|Torm]] of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]], whom [[Elminster]] had sent to find and stop the malaugrym.<ref><ref>
