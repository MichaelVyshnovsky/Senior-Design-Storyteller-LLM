Magusta was a powerful female malaugrym that was involved in the hunt for Shandril Shessair in 1357 DR. At the end, she managed to get close to the girl posing as her dwarf friend Delg Hammerhand but was killed by Torm of the Knights of Myth Drannor, whom Elminster had sent to find and stop the malaugrym.
