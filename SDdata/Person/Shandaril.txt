Shandaril was a particularly wicked archmage of the midâ€“14 century DR who slew other mages purely to eliminate rivals and acquire their spells and magic.
She had a cold and selfish manner.
She was strikingly beautiful and quickly learned how to use her appearance to get what she wanted.

She penned Shandarils Workbook, which she used to ensnare other mages with the help of a clever spell she developed called Shandarils tracer. The spell provided her with the knowledge of the precise location of anyone carrying her workbook. She could then either teleport directly to the unknowing target to confront them herself, though she rarely did this in order to keep herself hidden without risking a deadly confrontation. Instead, she usually sent minions to do the dirty work for her. She was fond of sending a pair of invisible stalkers after her prey with explicit instructions to bring the targets back to her after rendering them helpless. If for some reason they were defeated she would send more powerful creatures.
Shandaril was born in Telflamm and later moved to Sembia with her merchant parents. She studied magic under two tutors in Selgaunt Halakoun and Mairgaer.
At a young age, she apprenticed under Thalaver, a mage and adventurer of The Company in Crimson. She went with them into the Stonelands and its ruins, and there murdered every member of the Company and stole their magic. She returned alone to Suzail to rob Thalavers Tower, but was met by Vangerdahast and other notable mages asking where the rest of the Company was. She boasted of her crime and escaped with her life, but only barely, thanks to a teleportation item.
Shandaril remained wanted in Cormyr for the slaying of the Company in Crimson the royal warrant was still outstanding as of 1357 DR. Her exact whereabouts were unknown after she fled Cormyr, but she was believed to have moved south. After that, she released Shandarils Workbook.
Shandaril carried a staff of power that she took from Thalaver, as well as his spellbooks.
