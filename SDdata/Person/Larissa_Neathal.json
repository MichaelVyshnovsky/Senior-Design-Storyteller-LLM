However, she was very skilled in using cosmetics and magic to alter her appearance.\nBy some unknown means, Larissa was protected from all manner of poisons and drugs that made people fall asleep.\nIn the public sphere, Larissa was superficial and empty-headed. However, she used that persona as a front to allow her to gain information from the many public officials she lured into her hands.\nIn the , Larissa was beaten and badly wounded by agents of the Knights of the Shield working for Iriador Wintermist. She was found by Mirt in her home and slowly nursed back to health.\nLarissa lived in a house on Mulgomirs Way in the Castle Ward,\nLarissa always wore a distinctive periapt of proof against poison necklace that was shaped like a golden phoenix rising from a cluster of rubies.\nLarissa was one of the \"Like-Minded Lords\" who served as of 1364 DR along with Mirt, Khelben, Durnan, Kitten, and Brian. The group frequently met up with one another to enjoy each others company. Durnan was her closest friend and she often turned to him for emotional support."
