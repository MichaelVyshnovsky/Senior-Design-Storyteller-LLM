'''Anammelech''' was a [[Talontar blightlord]] operating in the [[Rawlinswood]] as of {{yearlink|1373}}.

==Description==
He had empty eye sockets that built up slime{{cite book/Lady of Poison|154-158|15}}

==Personality==
Annamelech was vindictive,, covetous, overconfident, and a bit of a jokester.

==Abilities==
Anammelech could use [[ooze mephit]]s as extensions of his will.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|141|14}} He could also transport himself through the ooze left behind by his mephits.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|152|15}} Fire had no power over him, and he was capable of moving without shifting his weight, leaving behind a trail of slime. Finally, he could engulf his foes with his amorphous body.

==History==
In {{yearlink|1373}}, Anammelech was sought out by ''[[Gloomgate]]'', which teleported towards him once [[Gameliel]] was ''[[disintegrate]]''d. He learned of [[Marrec]] and [[Ususi Manaallin]]'s party, as well as [[Araluen]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|165-168|17}} Though he managed to split Ususi and Marrec from [[Gunggari Ulmarra]] and [[Elowen]], almost slaying the first two, Marrec barely managed to defeat him by employing his petrifying gaze against the blightlord just as the latter was about to personally engulf him.

==Relationships==
Anammelech coveted [[Gameliel]]'s ''Gloomgate'', and he planned on taking revenge on [[Damanda]] for past slights. He cultivated the patronage of the [[Nentyar hunter]] [[Fallon]], eventually turning him into betraying the [[Nentyarch]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|117-118|13}}
