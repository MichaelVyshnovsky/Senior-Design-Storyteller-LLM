        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, an army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Hunkers Boolean and his beloved [[dragonborn]] [[Gaheid Slickjaw]] found their way to the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] district outside the city walls, but, like all other refugees, they were refused entrance. The two men had to live in the tent city, only able to gain entrance with proper paperwork. Gaheid thought, somewhat sheepishly, that picking fights with the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries was a bad idea, to what his partner called him the \"most cowardly dragonborn in the [[Realms]].\" Despite calling Gaheid a blockhead, Hunkers claimed to feel love for the man."
