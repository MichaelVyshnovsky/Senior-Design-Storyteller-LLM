'''Biaste Ganderlay''' was the mother-in-law of Lord [[Feringal Auck]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Biaste was a caring mother, but eventually became very ill with a condition known as [[the wilting]]. Such an affliction could only be cured by powerful [[cleric]]s, and not by changes in mood. Her daughter, [[Meralda Ganderlay]], used this as inspiration to marry the lord of Auckney, Feringal.

Around the time of her daughter's marriage in the late 1360s [[DR]], the lord kindly hired clerics of [[Helm]]: High Watcher [[Kalorc Risten]] and his assistant, Watcher [[Beribold]]. Beribold was able to cure Biaste's difficult condition. Biaste was excited for the prospect of her daughter being the most beautiful wife in the village of [[Auckney]], which eventually became a reality.
