        "History": "Phostral was a member of the Frostfire Banner when they took on High Duke [[Horostos]]'s assignment to search for the reason why all animals larger than one's hand, as well as most people, were vanishing on the road between [[Starmantle]] and [[Ripplestones]].\n\nThey were ambushed on their first night out of Starmantle by a chiming mist, [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]], which killed most of the party. He woke up when [[Paeregur]] called everyone awake; only he and [[Lhaerand]] were still alive at that point. Seeing the mist, Phostral tried to parry, but the entity swung into him, and reduced him to dust inside his armor."
