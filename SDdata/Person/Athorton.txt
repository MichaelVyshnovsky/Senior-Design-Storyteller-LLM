'''Athorton''' was a sage from [[Nleeth]] on [[Vilhon Reach]], living in the 13th century [[DR]].

==History==
Athorton was a young sage in the early 1200s DR.

By the mid–14th century [[DR]], it was theorized that it was Athorton who stole the ''[[Tome of Torment]]''—the holiest book of the faith of [[Ilmater]]—from the priestess of [[Loviatar]], [[Lalaskra]] of [[Ormpetarr]]. Lalaskra had worn the hairshirt tome constantly, but removed it during a ritual in the [[1211 DR|Year of the Crimson Crag, 1211 DR]] when it was stolen by an unknown thief, who also managed to make off with the tome's covers, stored in a backroom in Lalaskra's quarters in a nearby temple. Incensed, Lalaskra whipped her Loviatan minions into a frantic search for the ''Tome'' all across the southern [[Vilhon Reach]] lands, though without success.

In later years, Athorton wrote extensively of the [[magic]] of the Ilmatari—magic known to few outsiders and widely mocked—and he may have acquired such knowledge via the ''Tome''. As an old man, he became friends with [[Beromchess Ilthyn]], a local priestess of Ilmater. Following Athorton's death in the [[1264 DR|Year of the Shattered Altar, 1264 DR]], Beromchess covertly took the ''Tome'' to the [[House of Holy Suffering]] in [[Mussum]].
