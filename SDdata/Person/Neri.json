        "mainbody": "Queen '''Neri''' was a [[storm giant]] queen in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relations": "Neri was the queen of the storm giants, and was married to King [[Hekaton]].",
        "History": "At one point, she went with her youngest child [[Serissa]] to the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Moonshae Isles]] to meet friendly small folk.\n\nIn the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], her brother-in-law, [[Uthor]], found Neri's dead body. Uthor went to his niece, Serissa, for counsel and the daughter of the queen managed to calm her father's rightful rage.Â After this, Hekaton decided to first uncover the truth behind his wife's demise, before taking action.",
        "Personality": "Neri was known for her friendliness towards the small folk, a trait she passed to her youngest daughter, Serissa. However, she showed equal favor for her children, [[Mirran]] and [[Nym (storm giant)|Nym]] believed she showed favoritism, leading to jealousy of Serissa."
