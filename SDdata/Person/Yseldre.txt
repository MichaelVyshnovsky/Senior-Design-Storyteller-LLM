Lord Yseldre was a noble of Solon during the time of the Solonese empire.
He was the father of Tiphera tir-Yseldre.
King Andizen posted him to the lands south of Solon, to its most dangerous frontier. Yseldres efforts protecting the area against the blue dragon Sturykkazynarr and his forces enraged the wyrm enough that, after some years, it came to slay the man and his family directly, destroying his home in the process.
Lord Yseldre was survived only by his daughter Tiphera, who later sought revenge against the wyrm and ultimately slew it.
