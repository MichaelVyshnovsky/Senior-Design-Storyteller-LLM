Lord '''Yseldre''' was a noble of [[Solon]] during the time of the Solonese empire.

==Relationships==
He was the father of [[Tiphera tir-Yseldre]].

==History==
King [[Andizen]] posted him to the lands south of Solon, to its most dangerous frontier. Yseldre's efforts protecting the area against the [[blue dragon]] [[Sturykkazynarr]] and his forces enraged the wyrm enough that, after some years, it came to slay the man and his family directly, destroying his home in the process.

===Legacy===
Lord Yseldre was survived only by his daughter Tiphera, who later sought revenge against the wyrm and ultimately slew it.
