        "mainbody": "'''Extremiton''' was an [[ulitharid]] leader of a [[mind flayer]] colony in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[githyanki]] attacked a large illithid colony deep in the [[Underdark]]. Before being killed, the leading [[elder brain]] ordered Extremiton to escape to the surface and estabilish a new colony. Extremiton managed to arrive in [[Seadeeps]] in Undermontain and settled there, planning to transform itself into a new elder brain. Despite the relative security provided by the dungeon around the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], the colony was under threat of extermination by the githyanki group living in the [[Crystal Labyrinth]]. So Extremiton halted its plan of transformation and instead bred a [[neothelid]], planning to send it into the Crystal Labyrinth to deal with the githyanki.\n\nMeanwhile, Extremiton became intrigued by the complexity of [[human]] life in [[Waterdeep]] and wanted to know better how the city worked. It built a series of [[psipod]]s in the level, devices that could imprison sentient creatures in a dream version of Waterdeep called [[Alterdeep]], crafted from information gathered telepathically from Waterdhavians' minds. The ulitharid then manifested itself in the illusion as any character it wished, although it showed a preference to appear as [[Durnan]].",
        "Activities": "Usually Extremiton was in the main control room of Alterdeep and sometime checking the breeding of the neothelid.",
        "Personality": "Extremition had plans to conquer Waterdeep. However, the city's vast population had made the ulitharid extremely curious.",
        "Relationships": "Extremition was the favorite vassal of the elder brain of its colony."
