        "mainbody": "xtremiton was an ulitharid leader of a mind flayer colony in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.\nIn the late 15 century DR, githyanki attacked a large illithid colony deep in the Underdark. Before being killed, the leading elder brain ordered Extremiton to escape to the surface and estabilish a new colony. Extremiton managed to arrive in Seadeeps in Undermontain and settled there, planning to transform itself into a new elder brain. Despite the relative security provided by the dungeon around the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR, the colony was under threat of extermination by the githyanki group living in the Crystal Labyrinth. So Extremiton halted its plan of transformation and instead bred a neothelid, planning to send it into the Crystal Labyrinth to deal with the githyanki.\nMeanwhile, Extremiton became intrigued by the complexity of human life in Waterdeep and wanted to know better how the city worked. It built a series of psipods in the level, devices that could imprison sentient creatures in a dream version of Waterdeep called Alterdeep, crafted from information gathered telepathically from Waterdhavians minds. The ulitharid then manifested itself in the illusion as any character it wished, although it showed a preference to appear as Durnan.\nUsually Extremiton was in the main control room of Alterdeep and sometime checking the breeding of the neothelid.\nExtremition had plans to conquer Waterdeep. However, the citys vast population had made the ulitharid extremely curious. \nExtremition was the favorite vassal of the elder brain of its colony."
