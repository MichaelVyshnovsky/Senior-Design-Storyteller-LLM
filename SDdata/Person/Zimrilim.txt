'''Zimrilim''' was the ruler of [[Unthalass]] in [[Unther]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Zimrilim was the right hand of the god-king [[Gilgeam]]. He planned to hire a great army of [[Chessenta]]n mercenaries to crush a revolt ''circa'' [[1357 DR]].

==Personality==
Zimrilim was a brilliant man. He was well aware that he was the perfect scapegoat for the current situation and that many Great Lords wanted his position.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Zimrilin was one of the nobles who were in Gilgeam's army when [[Tiamat]] attacked Unthalass and thus witnessed the death of his god.

In the {{YearlinkName|1373}} Zimrilin led a group of remaining followers of Gilgeam in a plot to resurect their god thanks to the help of a thief named [[Kehrsyn]] posing as Massedar, merchant prince of [[Wing's Reach]] in [[Messemprar]] devoted to [[Bane]], and gaining the help of a group of [[Zhentarim]]. Zimrilim used the ''[[Alabaster Staff]]'' to raise the preserved body of Gilgeam in order to try to use the undead god as a puppet to rule Unther.

With the help of the [[Harper]] agent [[Demok]], Kehrsyn was able to steal back the ''Alabaster Staff'' from Zimrilim by exchanging it with a replica made by the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] [[Eileph]]. Kehrsyn later used the ''Alabaster Staff'' to destroy the reanimated Gilgeam, with the help of the [[Tiamat]]an priestess [[Tiglath]]. 

Zimrilin and his priests were soon killed by the [[Church of Tiamat]] and their allies.{{Cite dragon/358/Volo's Guide: War upon the Sands|71}}
