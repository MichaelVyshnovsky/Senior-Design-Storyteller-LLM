Zimrilim was the ruler of Unthalass in Unther in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Zimrilim was the right hand of the god-king Gilgeam. He planned to hire a great army of Chessentan mercenaries to crush a revolt circa 1357 DR.
Zimrilim was a brilliant man. He was well aware that he was the perfect scapegoat for the current situation and that many Great Lords wanted his position.
In the , Zimrilin was one of the nobles who were in Gilgeams army when Tiamat attacked Unthalass and thus witnessed the death of his god.
In the  Zimrilin led a group of remaining followers of Gilgeam in a plot to resurect their god thanks to the help of a thief named Kehrsyn posing as Massedar, merchant prince of Wings Reach in Messemprar devoted to Bane, and gaining the help of a group of Zhentarim. Zimrilim used the Alabaster Staff to raise the preserved body of Gilgeam in order to try to use the undead god as a puppet to rule Unther.
With the help of the Harper agent Demok, Kehrsyn was able to steal back the Alabaster Staff from Zimrilim by exchanging it with a replica made by the Red Wizard Eileph. Kehrsyn later used the Alabaster Staff to destroy the reanimated Gilgeam, with the help of the Tiamatan priestess Tiglath. 
Zimrilin and his priests were soon killed by the Church of Tiamat and their allies.
