The Wolf Knight was brigand who once ruled over the Keep of the Far Hills in the Western Heartlands.
Once a follower of Angarn Surfyst, Wolf Knight betrayed and slew the bandit leader, before seizing the Far Hills fortress as his own. Unfortunately for the unnamed lord, his tenure as ruler of the keep was short-lived.
The Wolf Knight was himself killed by the sorceress Sarunn Thoon, who posed as a timid captive and prospective lover.
Although his name was lost to the ages, the Wolf Knight appeared as part of Sarunns tale, as immortalized in The Witch of the Far Cold Hill.
