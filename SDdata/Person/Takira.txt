Takira was a merchant and trader living in Hiyal around 1367 DR.
Twice per year, Takira would travel to the High Desert of west Zakhara to trade goods with the House of Dhib. The tribe would offer goods taken from raids for weapons, dried fish, and other items not found normally in the desert. These meetings would occur in one of Anwat al-Makkars hidden fortresses.
