        "mainbody": "randon was a fifty-year-old quarterstaff-wielding warrior, secretly a wizard, who spent years recruiting for the Hammers of Tyr. \nTrandon appeared to be a leather-clad fighter of roughly fifty years. He kept his silver-streaked hair long and tied in a ponytail. His right arm appeared to be healthy even though Trandon claimed it was permanently damaged by a vampire in the past, making him unable to wield the weapon of his faith - a warhammer..\nTrandon kept his ability to use arcane spells a secret even from his closest allies. He likely used the wound dealt to him by a vampire in the past as an excuse to wield a quarterstaff as opposed to fighter weapons. Trandon felt deep insecurity and shame regarding his arcane abilities, thinking the magic to be dangerous and irresponsible.\nSecretly a wizard, Trandons senses were finely tuned to the rhythms of magic. He could feel the arcane energies surrounding Skillport and its residents.\nTrandon used leather armor and his trusty thick ashen quarterstaff in battle.\nNot a member himself, Trandon was highly trusted by the Hammers of Tyr as he spent years wandering Cormyr recruiting for their cause. His real affilition was to the War Wizards of Cormyr, where he was a a member of the leadership Council of War Wizards. \nTrandon lived a long life filled with battles. At one point in the past, he claimed to have had a close encounter with a vampire that permanently drained the health from his right arm. The alleged wound proved to be uncurable with cleric magic and healing ointments alike.\nIn 1371 DR, on Eleint 17 and 18, Trandon, representing the Hammers of Tyr, was in attendance at the wedding ceremony between the Open Lord of Waterdeep Piergeiron the Paladinson and Eidola of Neverwinter. \nThe wedding concluded with an assassination attempt and the brides abduction. Trandon was recruited to be a part of the rescue team assembled by Khelben Arunsun to travel through Undermountain to reach the only portal to the Utter East that was in the vicinity of the city. Blackstaff was unable to teleport the paladins to the portal directly because of Kerns anti-magical abilities, leaving the party with only one choice — traveling through Skullport. \nWhen the paladins reached Skullport, the group was tasked with aiding zombies by the mysterious Skulls of Skullport in penance for destroying one of the watchers. The group split apart in search of undead to aid. Trandon was weary of the abundance of dangerous magics practiced by the residents of Skullport. Eventually, he encountered a limping zombie carrying its own foot. Making sure no one can see the cast magic, Trandon used a mending spell to fix the shambling undeads leg, fulfilling the Skulls task.\nAfter the paladins passed out of Skullport, they encountered a group of ettins. An unfortunate skirmish let to the death of Harloon, who was set aflame on a funeral pyre before the paladins moved on.\nCloser to the destination, the paladins came across tanarri aiming to use the same portal as the heroes. Barlguras were using a magical mirror located not far from the portal to create duplicates of themselves. In the ensuing battle, Able was killed and Noph got captured by two fiends, Shaakat and Rejik. They held him, hostage, to destroy the rest of the party. However, he successfully distracted them so the surviving paladins were able to penetrate the fiends’ circle of protection against law. The fiends fled, and Aleena Paladinstar sent Trandon and the others off through the gate.\nDuring the escape from the fiends besieging Eldrinpar in the kingdom of Doegan in the Utter East Trandon was forced to unveil his true colors."
