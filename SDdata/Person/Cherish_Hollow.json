        "mainbody": "'''Cherish Hollow''' was the [[necromancer]] who authored ''[[The Amiable Art of Necromancy]]'', sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''So who needs necromancy? We who demand a chance to challenge the whole 'death' thing, because we're weird, and lonely, and we like having friends as much as anyone...''|Excerpt from ''[[The Amiable Art of Necromancy]]''}}",
        "Personality": "Cherish harbored a plethora of phobias. She was afraid of [[shark]]s, [[licorice]], wallpaper, [[Netherese]] [[artifact]]s, overly large and overly small hats, the outdoors, the indoors, and [[milk]] [[pail]]s. One thing she was not afraid of, however, was [[zombie]]s, unlike her father who was terrified of them.",
        "Possessions": "She owned the ''[[Staff of Cherished Necromancy]]'' at some point before the late 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "History": "Daughter of [[Thibault Hollow]], Cherish penned her [[book]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, in which she defended a lady's need for the art of necromancy despite the questions and disdain of others. In her book, Cherish used the example of her [[undead]] attendant to prove her point. The zombie who once was Mister [[Nascent Owens]] retained none of his living thoughts or memories. The necromancer believed that Nascent found pleasure in serving her [[tea]], giving backrubs, and eating the mistress's enemies. Cherish stated that giving purpose and direction to the discarded husk was the best economical and metaphysical approach to the taboo of death in her contemporary society. Furthermore, Cherish stated that, as such, the art of necromancy was helpful for those who were lonely."
