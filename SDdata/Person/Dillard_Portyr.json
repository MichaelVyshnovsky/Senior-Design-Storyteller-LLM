        "mainbody": "Dillard Portyr () was the leading Grand Duke of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nDillard disliked conflict, mostly for not being able to manage the stress. As a leader he was a weathercock, turning wherever the wind blew him.\nHe was uncle to Liara Portyr, a high-ranking commander in the Flaming Fist.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, Dillard was the most senior of the Grand Dukes and for this reason their unofficial leader. In the , Dillard also survived the crisis in Baldurs Gate that culminated in the resurrection of Bhaal.\nIn the , Duke Portyr recalled his niece Liara from her post at Fort Beluarian in Chult, after Grand Duke Ulder Ravengards disappearance during the Descent of Elturel.\nWhen Baldurs Gate fell into turmoil, he gave a speech to the Baldurian people in the Wide. He was killed that day when someone shot an arrow into his chest, he exploded, and devils burst from his body. \nSomehow, Duke Portyr recovered from his apparent violent death. Later in the year, the Church of Bane and Lord Enver Gortash targeted Dillard in Envers quest for power. The cult thought Dillard to be a cowards and planned to have him resign, through simple threats, passing the seat to his niece Liara Portyr, who, in turn, was to be infected with an illithid tadpole and indoctrinated into the service to the Absolute. He later attended the inauguration of Lord Enver Gortash in Wyrms Rock fortress and appointed him, along with Ulder Ravengard, as the first Archduke of Baldurs Gate."
