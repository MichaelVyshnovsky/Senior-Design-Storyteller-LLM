        "History": "As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Dillard was the most senior of the Grand Dukes and for this reason their unofficial leader. In the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, Dillard also survived the crisis in Baldur's Gate that culminated in the resurrection of [[Bhaal]].\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1492}}, Duke Portyr recalled his niece Liara from her post at [[Fort Beluarian]] in [[Chult]], after Grand Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]]'s disappearance during [[the Descent]] of [[Elturel]].\n\nWhen Baldur's Gate fell into turmoil, he gave a speech to the Baldurian people in [[the Wide]]. He was killed that day when someone shot an arrow into his chest, he exploded, and [[devil]]s burst from his body.{{Cite adventurers league/Day of the Devil|3}} \n\nSomehow, Duke Portyr recovered from his apparent violent death.{{speculation}} Later in the year, the [[Church of Bane]] and Lord [[Enver Gortash]] targeted Dillard in Enver's quest for power. The cult thought Dillard to be a cowards and planned to have him resign, through simple threats, passing the seat to his niece Liara Portyr, who, in turn, was to be infected with an [[illithid]] tadpole and indoctrinated into the service to the Absolute. He later attended the inauguration of Lord Enver Gortash in [[Wyrm's Rock]] fortress and appointed him, along with [[Ulder Ravengard]], as the first Archduke of Baldur's Gate."
