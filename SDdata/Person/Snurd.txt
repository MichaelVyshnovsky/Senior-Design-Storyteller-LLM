'''Snurd''' was a [[goblin]] devotee of [[the Absolute]] who lived on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{Quote|I can see the Absolute from here. I can!|Snurd.}}

==Description==
Snurd wore a crudely made [[scale mail]] cuirass along with a leather hood and mask that obscured his face.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[cult of the Absolute]]'s launched a terrible, and yet successful, raid on the [[Waukeen's Rest]]. Afterwards many of the goblin cutlists celebrating by drinking, playing games, and enjoying whatever they looted, at the nearby [[Shattered Sanctum]]. Snurd unfortunately was left at guard duty, at a small outpost just outside the sanctum. He did not seem to mind however, as his vantage point atop the outpost gave him a lovely view, from which he thought he could see the Absolute herself.
