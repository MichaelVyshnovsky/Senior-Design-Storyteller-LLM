Dharvanum was one of the Empyrean Knights until . After the Keeper of the Cerulean Sign Telarian struck Commander Brathtar down, he promoted Dharvanum to the position. Nearly immediately, Dharvanum judged the Keepers reason had deserted him and that he had to be struck down. Telarian slew him just as immediately.
A gore splash was left behind where he was struck down, which Telarian had to explain later.
