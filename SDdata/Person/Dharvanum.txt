'''Dharvanum''' was one of the [[Empyrean Knight]]s until {{yearlink|1375}}. After the [[Keeper of the Cerulean Sign]] [[Telarian]] struck Commander [[Brathtar]] down, he promoted Dharvanum to the position. Nearly immediately, Dharvanum judged the Keeper's reason had deserted him and that he had to be struck down. Telarian slew him just as immediately.{{cite book/Stardeep|159-160|14}}

A gore splash was left behind where he was struck down, which Telarian had to explain later.{{cite book/Stardeep|165|15}}
