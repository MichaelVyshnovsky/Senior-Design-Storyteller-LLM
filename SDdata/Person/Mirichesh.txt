Mirichesh was a dragonborn of Abeir and an ancestor of Clan Ophinshtalajiir.
Mirichesh was a renowned dragon-slayer during the dragonborn rebellion.
Mirichesh was one of the dragonborn clan leaders who took part in the battle of the Crippled Mountain. While Iskdara, Shurideh, Reshvemi, and Thuchir infiltrated the Celestial Mountain to kill Rhodrolytharnestrix, Mirichesh was one of the clan leaders who led the dragonborn rebels against Rhodrolytharnestrixs dragon army.
Mirichesh survived the final battle and was one of the founders of Tymanchebar, and presumably, he was the first patriarch of Clan Ophinshtalajiir.
