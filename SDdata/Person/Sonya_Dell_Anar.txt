'''Sonya Dell'Anar''' was a [[human]] turned [[vampire]] of the 13{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==History==
Before Sonya became a vampire, she had a quarrel over a man with her cousin, which left them on bad terms. Wanting revenge, her cousin contacted an [[evil]] [[wizard]] who sent a vampire to kill Sonya but who instead turned her into one.

==Description==
Sonya appeared as a lady in her thirties, but her age was masked by her vampirismâ€”by the mid-to-late 1300s DR, she was almost 150 years old.

==Activities==
Sonya would attack anyone who resembled her cousin.

==Abilities==
As well as her vampiric nature, she was very intelligent.
