'''Linu La'neral''' was a female [[moon elf]] [[cleric]] of the elven goddess [[Sehanine Moonbow]]. She hailed from the city of [[Evereska]]. 

Linu was clumsy (some said unfortunate), often causing accidents in her wake. She had a somewhat naive worldview but was well liked by many people for her constantly positive outlook and her kindheartedness to others. She had a great deal of humorous lines and stories, including how she met her (later deceased) husband.<ref>
