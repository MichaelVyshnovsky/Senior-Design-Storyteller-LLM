Baronne '''Ilza Bormul''' was a renowned member of the noble [[patriar]] [[Bormul]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] many years before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Baronne Ilza Bormul was a historic individual, a patriar who lived many years before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Ilza owned slave-labor mines in the mountains of [[Amn]], importing ingots of precious metals to enrich herself and the city of Baldur's Gate. The bloody nature of Ilza Bormul's ingots was often not mentioned in classless and history [[book]]s, however, her cruel imports were named on page thirty seven of ''[[Baldur's Gate and the Dialectics of Plunder]]'', a book sold in the Gate in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
