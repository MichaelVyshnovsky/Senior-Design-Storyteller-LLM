        "mainbody": "Lord '''Heradd''' was the [[orc]]ish lord of the [[Ringfork Stronghold]] in the [[Trielta Hills]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Cult of the Absolute]] was attempting to recruit the orcs of the Trielta Hills into its army. The first envoy, Agent [[Mhoss]], was slaughtered on sight on the orders from Lord Heradd, as negotiations were thought to be a sign of weakness. Following that failure, General [[Ketheric Thorm]] reassessed their approach to dealing with the orcs and Lord Heradd. Sir [[Yax]] of [[Scornubel]] was selected to be the next envoy as soon as he returned from the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]]. Yax's strategy was to arrive accompanied by two [[ogre]]s and issue a personal challenge to Lord Heradd for the killing of Agent Mhoss. Yax then would have to defeat the orcish lord, force him to swear allegiance to [[the Absolute]], and, in exchange, the cult would offer Lord Heradd an alliance in conquering the other two orcish communities of the Trielta Hills."
