'''Thuchir''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Abeir]], a descendant of [[Haizverad]], and an ancestor of [[Clan Shestandeliath]].

==History==
During the [[dragonborn rebellion]], Tuchir was the bearer of the [[Breath of Petron]].

Thuchir was one of the dragonborn clan leaders who took part in the [[battle of the Crippled Mountain]]. He sacrificed part of his lungs by using the Breath of Petron<ref group="note">According to chapter 23 of ''Ashes of the Tyrant'', the artifact always demands this price for its usage. to open an entrance to the [[Crippled Mountain|Celestial Mountain]], allowing [[Iskdara]], [[Shurideh]], and [[Reshvemi]] to kill the [[dragon]] overlord [[Rhodrolytharnestrix]].

Thuchir survived the final battle, however, and was one of the founders of [[Tymanchebar]], and presumably, he was one of the first patriarchs of Clan Shestandeliath.
