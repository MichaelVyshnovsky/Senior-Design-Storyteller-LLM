She wore ''[[boots of elvenkind]]'' and a ''[[cloak of elvenkind]]'', which eased her avoidance of fire-based attacks. All of her equipment would become useless if exposed to sunlight.\n\nInside her pillow, Zomara kept ten [[gem]]s, each of which was worth 50 [[gold piece]]s, five gems worth 100 gp, and one gem worth 5000 gp."
