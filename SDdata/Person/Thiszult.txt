'''Thiszult''' was a [[wizard]] working for the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

==Personality==
He was impatient and impulsive. His superiors considered him overly ambitious.

==Abilities==
He possessed [[spell]]s to ''[[teleport]]'' at least himself and one more. At least one of his spells slew a stable full of animals, apparently with electricity, almost certainly ''[[lightning bolt]]''.

==Possessions==
At the time of his death, he wore a dark [[cloak]].

==Relationships==
Unknown to him, [[Salvarad]] of the Cult possessed his true name.

==History==
Thiszult was sent by the Cult of the Dragon to capture [[Shandril Shessair]] in {{yearlink|1357}}, on [[Flamerule 9]]. Knowing she had too much of a head start, he teleported to the [[The Rising Moon (inn)|Rising Moon]] with a warrior on tow rather than ride the rest of the way; at the inn, Korvan told him Shandril wasn't much further ahead.

Definitive accounts show that the warrior he took along during teleportation stayed behind with Korvan and attacked [[Gorstag]]; the mage instead stole a horse and slew all the others with lightning. Thiszult himself was ambushed by the [[Malaugrym]] [[Architrave]], which he escaped with the same spells, only to get too close to Shargailar and be struck with lightning breath on the spot, on Flamerule 9 too.These differences exist between the 2005 and the 1988 versions.
