Thiszult was a wizard working for the Cult of the Dragon.
He was impatient and impulsive. His superiors considered him overly ambitious.
He possessed spells to teleport at least himself and one more. At least one of his spells slew a stable full of animals, apparently with electricity, almost certainly lightning bolt.
At the time of his death, he wore a dark cloak.
Unknown to him, Salvarad of the Cult possessed his true name.
Thiszult was sent by the Cult of the Dragon to capture Shandril Shessair in , on Flamerule 9. Knowing she had too much of a head start, he teleported to the Rising Moon with a warrior on tow rather than ride the rest of the way at the inn, Korvan told him Shandril wasnt much further ahead.
Definitive accounts show that the warrior he took along during teleportation stayed behind with Korvan and attacked Gorstag the mage instead stole a horse and slew all the others with lightning. Thiszult himself was ambushed by the Malaugrym Architrave, which he escaped with the same spells, only to get too close to Shargailar and be struck with lightning breath on the spot, on Flamerule 9 too.These differences exist between the 2005 and the 1988 versions.
