'''Janzobur of the Snow Cats''' was a [[barbarian]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Janzobur was a member of the [[Uthgardt]] [[Red Tiger tribe]]. He first came to Waterdeep in [[1357 DR]] in search of a warrior-princess for his tribe. Unfortunately his first candidate, a mercenary from [[Athkatla]], was killed by a [[remorhaz]].

In disgrace with his people, Janzobur went back to Waterdeep to find a new candidate. Instead, he put his efforts into survey all the brews in the taverns of the [[South Ward of Waterdeep|South]] and [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Wards]]. At the urging of his friend [[Myrnd Gundwynd]], he joined the [[Black Boar]] mercenary group.
