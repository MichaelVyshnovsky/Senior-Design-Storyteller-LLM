Janzobur of the Snow Cats was a barbarian in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.
Janzobur was a member of the Uthgardt Red Tiger tribe. He first came to Waterdeep in 1357 DR in search of a warrior-princess for his tribe. Unfortunately his first candidate, a mercenary from Athkatla, was killed by a remorhaz.
In disgrace with his people, Janzobur went back to Waterdeep to find a new candidate. Instead, he put his efforts into survey all the brews in the taverns of the South and Dock Wards. At the urging of his friend Myrnd Gundwynd, he joined the Black Boar mercenary group.
