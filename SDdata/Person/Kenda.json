        "mainbody": "Father Kenda was a priest at the Temple of Savras in Port Nyanzaru during the late 15 century DR. He was an assistant to the head priest, Grandfather Zitembe.\nDuring the events of the death curse, Father Kenda conspired with the Red Wizards of Thay to assassinate Grandfather Zitembe. When a mob of bandits attacked the temple, their assassin attempted to slip inside unnoticed while Father Kenda fled at the same time. He headed to the Coliseum to hide during the fallout, and thus did not realize that Zitembe had survived until a group of adventurers came looking for him on the head priests behalf."
