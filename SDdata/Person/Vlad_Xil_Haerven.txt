'''Vlad Xil Haerven''' was one of the seven [[lich]]es who created [[Crenshinibon]], and was later consumed by it.

==Description==
Out of each of the liches behind the creation of the Crystal Shard, Vlad Xil Haerven was said to be the most greedy. Vlad would do absolutely anything for wealth. Xil Haerven would even resort to insane measures to increase his material prosperity.
