'''Eagus''' was a mercenary who was killed by [[Abdel Adrian]] in [[1368 DR]].

==Appearance==
Eagus had a messy greying brown beard and yellow teeth.

==Equipment==
Eagus wielded a [[halberd]] and wore rusty armour.

==Background==
Eagus lost a bet to Abdel in [[Julkoun]], eight months prior to Eagus's death, and as a result, he bore a scar on his face.

Eagus was in combat alongside [[Kamon]] and others, against Abdel and [[Gorion]], when he was stabbed by Abdel's [[broadsword]]. Eagus disarmed the sword from Abdel, but lost a lot of blood from his stab wound, and succumbed to death when Abdel cut his throat with a silver [[dagger]].
