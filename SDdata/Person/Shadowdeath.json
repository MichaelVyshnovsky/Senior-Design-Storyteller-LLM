        "mainbody": "hadowdeath was a young shadow dragon who got trapped inside the Tower of Ruin while looting it in 1353 DR.\nShadowdeath was a cunning and intellectual dragon, but had no qualms about using violence to get what he wanted.\nHe managed to gather up a respectable hoard, including thousands of gold pieces worth of coins and gems. The heap of magical items was made up of a +5 holy avenger, a +1 flame tongue shortsword, a mace of disruption, a +2 shield, a suit of +1 blending splint mail, a suit of +2 chain mail, a suit of +1 leather armor, a staff of thunder and lightning, a wand of wonder, a Bucknards everfull purse, a large bag of holding, and a talisman of Zagy. He also gathered up potions of healing, extra-healing, speed, longevity, fire resistance, and plant control.\nSome time after 1352 DR, he invaded the Tower of Ruin but was cursed by Torm, trapped alongside the defenders and their assailants inside a time-locked version of the tower even as it crumbled into nothing.\nShadowdeath remained unaware of the passage of time, and finally encountered a group of adventurers in 1369 DR who had sought out the mystery of the ruined tower. He probed them for information on the outside world and how to break the curse, then attacked, only to be killed and have his treasure hoard looted."
