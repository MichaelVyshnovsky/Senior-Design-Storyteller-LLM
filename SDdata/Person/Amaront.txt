'''Amaront of Selgaunt''' was a young [[mage]] of [[Selgaunt]] in [[Sembia]]. His primary area of research was creating [[spell]]s that used [[gem]]s as foci. Using a gem as the focus for the [[magic]] made it difficult to trace a spell back to the caster.[[Ed Greenwood]]. "Eye on the Realms:  Surprising Vintage." ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #407. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, January, 2012.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], Amaront was approached by a [[Tethyrian]] officer named [[Storl Thammuraster]] ,who was investigating the adulteration of [[Oraundas Haeltower]]'s [[wine]]s. Someone had been placing objects such as gold rings and gems into bottles of the wine and the Queen wanted to get to the bottom of what the Tethyrians believed to be a smuggling operation.

Amaront and Storl traveled throughout the region investigating wine merchants. Amaront was able to use his foci spell to cause any foreign objects in unopened wine bottles to emit a sound or glow that helped to identify the suspect bottles. However, while in [[Athkatla]], Amaront accidentally blew up [[Daranthur's Hall]], killing dozens of traders, apparently because a very large number of wine bottles reacted to his spell. Amaront was seriously injured in the incident.
