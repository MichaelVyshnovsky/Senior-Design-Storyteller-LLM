'''Akima Abd al-Garib''' was a [[mamluk]] inhabiting the island of [[Afyal]] in east [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|22}}

==Activities==
Akima served as the leader of the [[Wondrous Mamluk Society]], an organization dedicated to protecting the [[Alad bin Alaq bin Alonka|Padisha]] of Afyal.

Since she publicly shared the padisha's belief that his personal troops were not to be wasted, the Wondrous usually only served as guards on parades or within the [[Palace of Alon]].
