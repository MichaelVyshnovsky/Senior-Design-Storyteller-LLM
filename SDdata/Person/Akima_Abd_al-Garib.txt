Akima Abd al-Garib was a mamluk inhabiting the island of Afyal in east Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Akima served as the leader of the Wondrous Mamluk Society, an organization dedicated to protecting the Padisha of Afyal.
Since she publicly shared the padishas belief that his personal troops were not to be wasted, the Wondrous usually only served as guards on parades or within the Palace of Alon.
