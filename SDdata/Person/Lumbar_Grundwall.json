        "mainbody": "'''Lumbar Grundwall''' was a timber merchant who operated in the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''My question exactly! I can find no one supervising the crane's use, nor anyone to see about making it work again! By the Gods, my anger's fit to split me in two!''|Lumbar Grundwall}}",
        "Description": "Lumbar was a large and wide red-faced man with an explosive attitude.",
        "Relationships": "[[Jorun Tamewater]], of the [[Tamewater]] clan, had a strained and argumentative relationship with Lumbar Grundwall. After a fight in [[1312 DR]], the two stopped talking with each other.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the [[Ten-Towns]] and the town of Targos were besieged by a [[goblin]] army that served the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. Lumbar Grundwall offered his services in the construction of the town's defensive palisades in the face of the looming siege. To facilitate this, two local [[dwarves]] of the Tamewater clan constructed a crane to lift lumber from the docks to then be pushed across Targos towards the palisades. \n\nOn the day the town was attacked by the goblins, [[Olap Tamewater]]'s crane broke, much to Lumbar Grundwall's fury and frustration. Because of this, the understaffed merchant was unable to deliver an essential shipment of lumber from [[Lonelywood]] for the palisade, threatening Targos's safety."
