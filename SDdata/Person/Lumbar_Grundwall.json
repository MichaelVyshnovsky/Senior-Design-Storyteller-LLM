        "mainbody": "umbar Grundwall was a timber merchant who operated in the town of Targos in Icewind Dale in the early 14 century DR.\nLumbar was a large and wide red-faced man with an explosive attitude.\nJorun Tamewater, of the Tamewater clan, had a strained and argumentative relationship with Lumbar Grundwall. After a fight in 1312 DR, the two stopped talking with each other.\nIn the , the Ten-Towns and the town of Targos were besieged by a goblin army that served the Legion of the Chimera. Lumbar Grundwall offered his services in the construction of the towns defensive palisades in the face of the looming siege. To facilitate this, two local dwarves of the Tamewater clan constructed a crane to lift lumber from the docks to then be pushed across Targos towards the palisades. \nOn the day the town was attacked by the goblins, Olap Tamewaters crane broke, much to Lumbar Grundwalls fury and frustration. Because of this, the understaffed merchant was unable to deliver an essential shipment of lumber from Lonelywood for the palisade, threatening Targoss safety."
