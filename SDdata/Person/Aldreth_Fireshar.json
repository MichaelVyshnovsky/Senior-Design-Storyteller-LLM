        "mainbody": "Aldreth Fireshaar was a peculiar mage that lived in Telflamm during the mid—14 century DR. She dwelled within a barge, docked at the harbor, that was well-protected by a number of gargoyles.\nAldreth could always be found with a floating, magical skull that accompanied her wherever she traveled.\nShe was knowing for being rather unprincipled and particularly conspicuous in her actions.\nWhile Aldreths eyes were normally greyish-green in color, they turned a vibrant orange when she became excitable.\nShe wore an abundant amount of jewelry.\nAmong Aldreths repertoire was a spell of her own creation, one that granted her dominion over a number of goblins at the same time.\nAldreth studied the arcane arts in the Lake of Steam region of southern Faerûn before journeying to Thay. Though there was no firm evidence, the Harper mage Sunder Snowhand believed she delved into some Thayan crypts and even stole an evermagic during that time.\nAt some point she became involved in a goblin attack that raided a Zhentarim caravan. It was believed by Elminster Aumar that the attack was made to recover a scroll that pointed to the location of a sky chariot from the ancient realm of Mourativi Teshy Mir.\nRumors originating in the kingdom of Impiltur said that Aldreth had ties to pirates that sailed the Sea of Fallen Stars, while others told tale that she had invested into a thaedar.\nStories heard in the Sword and Horn tavern alluded to her involvement with ships that could sail in the sky and travel to other worlds."
