==Activities==
Sulcar spent much of his time drowning his sorrows at the [[Old Skull Inn]].

==Relationships==
He was married to a timid woman named [[Della]] and they had several sons together., eventually expanding to its borders. 

==History==

When the [[second battle of Shadowdale]] broke out during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the Reedo family farm was used to mobilize defenses for the outnumbered Dalesmen.
