|The infection can only by caught from [[Peron Uthe]], the [[ranger]] who brought it into the hospital. And Head Priest [[Jaskyr Hurim|Jaskyr]] has him safely locked away. No one's allowed in until he can protect them from catching it.<br/>The sick who have contracted this plague have grown strange and violent. Hurim Jaskyr, our Head Priest, is working on a way to inoculate others, but he's only an old man. To do it, he needs the help of someone like you.

{{Quote
|You and Jaskyr beat the infection? What good news! But how did that Peron Uthe ever contract this strange infection? And in [[King's Forest]], not some untamed hinterland!

During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], Meena worked at the [[Eveningstar War Hospital]] in treating the wounded and sick. She assisted fellow priest [[Anazar Narroun]] in investigating the strange events around [[Peron Uthe]]'s return to Eveningstar, and directed aid to the hospital where Peron had transformed into a [[red musk zombie]] and was spreading the monstrous infection to others. After the hospital situation was addressed, the investigation moved onto [[Uthe Lodge]], where the healer [[Eolynn Arva]] had spotted an unnatural overgrowth of vegetation.
