        "mainbody": "'''Stedd Rein''' was a noted citizen of the [[Rein]] family of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/A Fellowship Rises}}{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/What is the Green Regent}}",
        "Description": "He was young and handsome.",
        "Personality": "As a leader, Stedd was alert, dynamic, and charismatic, and he had reputation for integrity and sincerity.\n\nHe was a dedicated follower of [[Red Knight]], the Lady of Strategy, and used her colors and symbols.",
        "Relationships": "Stedd was the youngest child of [[Deldron Rein]], but perhaps the most well-known after his treacherous sister [[Jesym Rein|Jesym]].\n\nFor his leadership and heroism in battle, Stedd was an idol of many of the younger humans and half-elves of Loudwater.",
        "History": {
            "Early History": "As the son of Deldron Rein, leader of the [[Red Boar Trading Coster]] and owner of properties such as the [[Red Boar Inn]],<ref> Stedd was born to the wealthy and influential Rein family of Loudwater, which had immigrated from [[Waterdeep]] some six decades earlier.\n\n''Circa'' [[1361 DR]], Stedd Rein went south to [[Amn]] to receive an education at the renowned [[College of War]] in [[Athkatla]]. There, he studied military matters for some eight years. After he graduated, he would soon have the opportunity to put what he'd learned into practice.",
            "Night of the Blood Moon": "When Stedd returned to the Delimbiyr Vale in the {{yearlinkName|1369}}, while he was still ''en route'' to Loudwater, Deldron departed the city to greet his son and conduct business in [[Daggerford]]. He had taken with him the Red Boar Trading Coster's sizeable guard, and unwittingly helped to leave Loudwater hopelessly vulnerable. For at the rising of a blood-red [[moon]], [[Malarite]] [[lycanthrope]]s surged out of the [[High Forest]] and fell upon Loudwater and the surrounding homesteads in a vicious conflict known as the [[Night of the Blood Moon]].\n\nA magical communication alerted Deldron about the attack, and the Reins and their Red Boars hastened to return. While he followed close behind, Deldron sent Stedd ahead with half his forces and they arrived in Loudwater on the third day of the conflict, linking with [[Gauntlet (title)|Gauntlets]] [[Kalahar Twohands]] and [[Harazos Thelbrimm]]. Twohands and Thelbrimm divided the city into quadrants for defense by their own armies, the Red Boar guard, and the [[elf|elven]] house guards. Stedd opened the Red Boar's stores and equipped his forces with nearly forty [[alchemical silver]] weapons.\n\nThen, on the third night, the Malarites targeted [[Standing Stone Hill]], which stood at the edge of the city within the elven quadrant, and a vital ritual being conducted there by the [[Green Regent]] [[Galaer Grasswave]] and his [[Scions of the Green Regent|Scions]]. But while some of the elven house guard battled bravely in its defense, too many of them tarried and even departed their forces to protect their own estates. Learning of the threat, Stedd Rein rallied his Red Boar forces and charged desperately through the Malarites' ranks, fighting all the way with silver blades and battle spells, to reach Standing Stone Hill. It was a valiant effort, but too far and too hard to be successful. By the time they got there, Stedd and his forces discovered only a scant few surviving Scions and the head of Galaer Grasswave mounted on a stake. Thereafter, the moon returned to its regular hue and the Malarites melted back into the woods, marking the battle's end.\n\nDespite this, for his courage and leadership and actions that had yet saved many lives, Stedd Rein earned praise and accolades. When Deldron arrived in the aftermath, he heard many praising his son, and was pleased. It also improved the Rein name, erasing the earlier memory of Jesym's treachery and earning them the support of the [[Beutaleen'dal]] elven house, whose new matriarch [[Ovendal Beutaleen'dal]] had been saved by Stedd on that third night.<ref><ref>",
            "The Green Regent?": "In the following years, Stedd Rein would be considered the favorite to become a Scion himself and even the next Green Regent in the ceremony held on [[Shieldmeet]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. But he was rejected by Mielikki herself for both roles, vomiting up the [[Greendraught]] as others did, and this was met by stunned silence and surprised gasps. Even more shockingly, the [[orc]] [[Otar]] would be accepted as Green Regent instead. Even the elven nobility, who'd long opposed the Reins but had supported Stedd, were appalledâ€”the Beutaleen'dals claimed it was evidence of the ceremony being tainted or sabotaged. In contrast, the [[Phelaniityr]]s held it up as proof of the Reins' inherent wickedness following Deldron's lumbering business and Jesym's betrayal, but paradoxically maintained the ceremony had also been sabotaged to admit Otar. A few even doubted the validity of all the Scions, which nearly everyone rejected as ridiculous. As for Stedd Rein, he was defiant and made other plans..."
