        "mainbody": "Stedd Rein was a noted citizen of the Rein family of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 14 century DR. \nHe was young and handsome.\nAs a leader, Stedd was alert, dynamic, and charismatic, and he had reputation for integrity and sincerity.\nHe was a dedicated follower of Red Knight, the Lady of Strategy, and used her colors and symbols.\nStedd was the youngest child of Deldron Rein, but perhaps the most well-known after his treacherous sister Jesym.\nFor his leadership and heroism in battle, Stedd was an idol of many of the younger humans and half-elves of Loudwater.\nAs the son of Deldron Rein, leader of the Red Boar Trading Coster and owner of properties such as the Red Boar Inn, Stedd was born to the wealthy and influential Rein family of Loudwater, which had immigrated from Waterdeep some six decades earlier.\nCirca 1361 DR, Stedd Rein went south to Amn to receive an education at the renowned College of War in Athkatla. There, he studied military matters for some eight years. After he graduated, he would soon have the opportunity to put what hed learned into practice.\nWhen Stedd returned to the Delimbiyr Vale in the , while he was still en route to Loudwater, Deldron departed the city to greet his son and conduct business in Daggerford. He had taken with him the Red Boar Trading Costers sizeable guard, and unwittingly helped to leave Loudwater hopelessly vulnerable. For at the rising of a blood-red moon, Malarite lycanthropes surged out of the High Forest and fell upon Loudwater and the surrounding homesteads in a vicious conflict known as the Night of the Blood Moon.\nA magical communication alerted Deldron about the attack, and the Reins and their Red Boars hastened to return. While he followed close behind, Deldron sent Stedd ahead with half his forces and they arrived in Loudwater on the third day of the conflict, linking with Gauntlets Kalahar Twohands and Harazos Thelbrimm. Twohands and Thelbrimm divided the city into quadrants for defense by their own armies, the Red Boar guard, and the elven house guards. Stedd opened the Red Boars stores and equipped his forces with nearly forty alchemical silver weapons.\nThen, on the third night, the Malarites targeted Standing Stone Hill, which stood at the edge of the city within the elven quadrant, and a vital ritual being conducted there by the Green Regent Galaer Grasswave and his Scions. But while some of the elven house guard battled bravely in its defense, too many of them tarried and even departed their forces to protect their own estates. Learning of the threat, Stedd Rein rallied his Red Boar forces and charged desperately through the Malarites ranks, fighting all the way with silver blades and battle spells, to reach Standing Stone Hill. It was a valiant effort, but too far and too hard to be successful. By the time they got there, Stedd and his forces discovered only a scant few surviving Scions and the head of Galaer Grasswave mounted on a stake. Thereafter, the moon returned to its regular hue and the Malarites melted back into the woods, marking the battles end.\nDespite this, for his courage and leadership and actions that had yet saved many lives, Stedd Rein earned praise and accolades. When Deldron arrived in the aftermath, he heard many praising his son, and was pleased. It also improved the Rein name, erasing the earlier memory of Jesyms treachery and earning them the support of the Beutaleendal elven house, whose new matriarch Ovendal Beutaleendal had been saved by Stedd on that third night.\nIn the following years, Stedd Rein would be considered the favorite to become a Scion himself and even the next Green Regent in the ceremony held on Shieldmeet in the . But he was rejected by Mielikki herself for both roles, vomiting up the Greendraught as others did, and this was met by stunned silence and surprised gasps. Even more shockingly, the orc Otar would be accepted as Green Regent instead. Even the elven nobility, whod long opposed the Reins but had supported Stedd, were appalledâ€”the Beutaleendals claimed it was evidence of the ceremony being tainted or sabotaged. In contrast, the Phelaniityrs held it up as proof of the Reins inherent wickedness following Deldrons lumbering business and Jesyms betrayal, but paradoxically maintained the ceremony had also been sabotaged to admit Otar. A few even doubted the validity of all the Scions, which nearly everyone rejected as ridiculous. As for Stedd Rein, he was defiant and made other plans..."
