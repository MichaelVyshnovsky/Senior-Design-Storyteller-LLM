Basel Indoulur was the governor of Halagard in Halruaa in 1367 DR.
Basel was an accomplished Conjurer. He was also a leading Elder and member of the Council of Elders.
One of the most interesting things about Basel was the fact that he enjoyed having apprentices, which was a true rarity among Halruaan wizards.
