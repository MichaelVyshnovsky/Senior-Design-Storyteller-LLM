        "mainbody": "'''Drufi''' ({{Pronounce|DROO|fee|refs=}}) was a [[frost giant]] who led an attack on [[Bryn Shander]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].",
        "Activities": "Drufi always traveled with her two [[winter wolf|winter wolves]].",
        "History": "In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], under the orders of [[Jarl]] [[Storvald]], Drufi led a giant contingent to Bryn Shander to search for [[Artus Cimber]] and the ''[[Ring of Winter]]''.\n\nAround that same time, Drufi led a search party of twenty frost giants to [[Chult]] to continue searching for Artus Cimber and the ''Ring of Winter''. The giants arrived aboard the [[longship]] ''[[Hvalspyd]]''. Drufi's search was slow and inefficient as she needed to avoid detection by the [[Flaming Fist]]s."
