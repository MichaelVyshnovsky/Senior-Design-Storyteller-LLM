'''Mas'ud''' was a healer from [[Al Qahera]] in [[Raurin]] as of {{yearlink|1374}}. He was the one to examine [[Feraih]] after she died; unable to find any cause for her death, he considered it to be the product of some curse sourced from the [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]] which she had just visited. He also provided care to [[Thormud Horn]] during his stay in Al Qahera: he judged he may have been affected by a similar affliction.{{cite book/Darkvision|208-209|22}}
He was [[Fadheela]]'s father.{{cite book/Darkvision|184-185|19}}
