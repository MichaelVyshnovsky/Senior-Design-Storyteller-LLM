'''Denton Crimsguard''' was one of the most fervent, and devoted [[priest]] of [[Tyr]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] around the year [[1370 DR]]. From his [[temple of Tyr (Alagh么n)|temple]] in the city of [[Alagh么n]], Denton would lead impassioned speeches for his faithful every week.

==Description==
Denton was extremely dedicated in his service to [[Tyr]]. He had an extensive understanding of the laws and legal codes of both his home nation of [[Turmish]] and those of [[Chondath]].

==Activities==
To serve justice as a priest of Tyr, Denton sent out a number of [[paladin]]s to hunt down the leader of the [[Company of the Hunt]], and [[Malar]]-cultist, [[Jaras Silverblood]]. He wanted the outlaw brought back to Alagh么n alive so that he could be held on trial. Denton expressed a great concern over the activities of another cultist of the Beastlord, [[Marsalas Endriven]].

==Possessions==
Among Denton's possessions were a ''[[staff of curing]]'', a ''[[horn of blasting]]'' and he wore a ''[[ring of mind shielding]]''.
