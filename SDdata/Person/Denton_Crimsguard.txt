Denton Crimsguard was one of the most fervent, and devoted priest of Tyr in the Vilhon Reach around the year 1370 DR. From his temple in the city of Alaghôn, Denton would lead impassioned speeches for his faithful every week.
Denton was extremely dedicated in his service to Tyr. He had an extensive understanding of the laws and legal codes of both his home nation of Turmish and those of Chondath.
To serve justice as a priest of Tyr, Denton sent out a number of paladins to hunt down the leader of the Company of the Hunt, and Malar-cultist, Jaras Silverblood. He wanted the outlaw brought back to Alaghôn alive so that he could be held on trial. Denton expressed a great concern over the activities of another cultist of the Beastlord, Marsalas Endriven.
Among Dentons possessions were a staff of curing, a horn of blasting and he wore a ring of mind shielding.
