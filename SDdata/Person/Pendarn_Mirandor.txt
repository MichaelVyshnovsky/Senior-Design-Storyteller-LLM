'''Pendarn Mirandor''' was one of the early monarchs of [[Impiltur]]. He ruled as the 17{{th}} member of the [[Mirandor Dynasty]] for over a decade during the late 2{{nd}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was the second son of [[Inrath Mirandor III]], brother of [[Inrath Mirandor IV|Inrath IV]], and stepbrother of [[Doraven Mirandor|Doraven "the Bloody"]].

His only son, [[Ellarath Mirandor|Ellarath]] served as his successor.

==History==
Some time during or before the {{YearlinkName|162}}, Pendarn returned to his native Impiltur from [[Cormyr]], following the death of his elder brother Inrath IV. His return home was largely in response to the bloody coup initiated by their stepbrother, [[Doraven Mirandor|Doraven]], who had slain Inrath and seized the throne of Impiltur for himself. Pendarn slew Doraven in turn, and reclaimed the monarchy in his brother's name.

Pendarn ruled Impiltur for over a decade and a half, until the {{YearlinkName|178}}.
