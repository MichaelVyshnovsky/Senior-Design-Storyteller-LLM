Maggie Tefoco was one of the youngest kids of Oliver Tefoco, the proprietor of the Beehive Goods and Wares general store in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Maggie was a child of Oliver and Kroyce Tefoco, and had a number of siblings. The oldest of them was Bubbles Tefoco, who lived in the Stonyeyes district of the Gate with her family and the newborn Dorimara. Another older sibling was Dariel Tefoco who served the Flaming Fist. Thegglis and Crowell were traveling caravan guards, while the youngest of the bunch, Hemjax, Maggie, and others, still lived with Oliver and Kroyce as of the late 15 century DR.
Maggie kept a piece of paper that recorded her favorite "cukies" recipe. It called for butter, "shugar," egg, "flower," and "chokluts." The instructions read as follows "mix ingerdians, make cukie shapes, put cukies in stowve, yum yum yum!"
In the , as the Cult of the Absolute threatened Baldurs Gates safety, Kroyce Tefoco took Hemjax, Maggie, and the other youngest kids to the town of Beregost to live with Uncle Sternwell, away from the threat of war. Oliver stayed behind to run the shop, to Kroyces dismay. Maggie and the family were given Uncle Sternwells shearing shed to live in.
