'''Ulweth''' was a seasoned [[dwarf|dwarvish]] hunter from the [[Crossroad Keep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''New faces in the Keep, I see. You planning on hunting the worgs, too?''|Ulweth}}

==Description==
Ulweth had his brown beard groomed and braided. He wore primitive well-cured [[hide armor]] and a simple leather [[skullcap]] [[helmet]]. Ulweth used a [[crossbow]] for hunting.

==History==
Sometime before or in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Ulweth was attracted to the stronghold of the [[Crossroad Keep]] by a promise of a challenging hunt. The locals suffered savage attacks by a pack of [[worg]]s that laired not far from the trade routes, attacking travelers who walked the plains surrounding the Keep. Ulweth theorized that the worgs came from the nearby [[Neverwinter Wood]], forced away from their territory by something or someone. The dwarf planned to kill several worgs, forcing them to abandon the plains, and after that â€“ Ulweth was to travel to the Neverwinter Wood to uncover the source of the disturbance. The hunter did not target worgs for the reward as there was none promised; he also refused to team up with anyone else, claiming he was better at hunting alone. While his hunting operation was ongoing, he stayed at the [[Phoenix Tail Inn]] of the Crossroad Keep.
