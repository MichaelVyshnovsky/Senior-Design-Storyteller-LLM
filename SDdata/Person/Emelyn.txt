'''Emelyn the Gray''', was an [[archmage]] who was considered to be the most powerful of his kind in the [[Bloodstone Lands]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the leader of the vigilante group known as the [[Twilight Riders]].
 
==Description==
Emelyn wore satin gray robes. His long hair was white and often unkempt, and it hung down his shoulders.

==Abilities==
As a magic user of considerable power Emelyn was capable of teleporting great distances across the width and breadth of [[Vaasa]] and [[Damara]]. One of his magical abilities was the ability to ''[[Polymorph self|polymorph]]'' into a bird to cover great distances at fast speed.

==Possessions==
He was a proud owner of a ''[[staff of the magi]]''.

==Activities==
When he lived in the forest, Emelyn ran a school that catered to its native centaurs.

==Relationships==
Emelyn lived in the [[Warrenwood]] alongside a band of [[centaur]]s. He took an active role in their continued education.

Emelyn was a personal friend of [[Gareth Dragonsbane|King Gareth Dragonsbane]], having fought alongside him during the [[Bloodstone Wars]]. Among their adventuring companions were [[Dugald|Friar Dugald]], [[Caledon Kearney]], [[Riordan Parnell]], [[Olwen Forest-Friend]], and the monk called [[Kane]].

He counted many others among his allies, including his fellow Riders [[Myrddin Viligoth]], the [[dwarven]] prince [[Tamal]], and the nomadic [[Most Holy Order of the Sacred Shrike|knight]] [[Haelimbrar]], who traveled under the alias of "Agarelth".

The old wizard was well-served by his trusted apprentice, [[Gabrielle]].

==History==
During Emelyn's youth, he was a thrill-seeking adventurer who sought to gain as much arcane knowledge as he could.

When [[Zhengyi]] assaulted the northern lands of [[Damara]], Emelyn's school was destroyed. In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, he took up arms alongside his friend Gareth Dragonsbane.
