        "mainbody": "Zeldan was a merchant in the city of Waterdeep in the early 14 century DR.\nZeldan was rather short in stature.\nZeldan was a smoker and a devout worshiper of Gond.\nFor much of his time living in Waterdeep, Zeldan funded the construction of townhomes and warehouses around what would come to be named Zeldans Alley. Under the cover of these construction projects, Zeldan spent much of his fortune sponsoring priests of the Church of Gond, who traveled to Waterdeep to build and install various experimental devices in the alley.\nCirca 1337 DR, Zeldan met his end when a construct meant to gently raise him so he could paint a wall had instead smashed him through it."
