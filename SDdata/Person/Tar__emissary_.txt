Emissary Tar was the chief negotiator who spoke on behalf of the Council of Four of Baldurs Gate during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She was a particularly rotund woman.
Tar was a committed civil servant who would not be distracted from her duties nor suffer fools that may waste her time.
During the iron crisis of the Sword Coast in the , Emissary Tar was tasked with negotiating a new price for iron with Thaldorn Tenhevich and Destus Gurn of the Baldurian branch of the Iron Throne , along with six of their "advisors". The Throne had just been granted rights to iron mines owned by the Merchants League and Seven Suns Trading Coster. Unbeknownst to Tar and the Grand Dukes, however, many of the members of those mercantile groups had been killed and replaced with doppelgangers.
Emissary Tar did not survive her visit to the Iron Throne headquarters in the Lower City. The meeting was a trap Tar was slain by agents of Sarevok Anchev and her persona claimed by one of his doppelganger agents. Her body was hidden away in the towers top floor.
