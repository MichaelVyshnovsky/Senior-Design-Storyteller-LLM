Emissary '''Tar''' was the chief negotiator who spoke on behalf of the [[Council of Four]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She was a particularly rotund woman.

==Personality==
Tar was a committed civil servant who would not be distracted from her duties nor suffer fools that may waste her time.

==History==
During the [[iron crisis]] of the [[Sword Coast]] in the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, Emissary Tar was tasked with negotiating a new price for [[iron]] with [[Thaldorn Tenhevich]] and [[Destus Gurn]] of the Baldurian branch of the [[Iron Throne]] , along with six of their "advisors". The Throne had just been granted rights to iron mines owned by the [[Merchant's League]] and [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]]. Unbeknownst to Tar and the [[Grand Duke]]s, however, many of the members of those mercantile groups had been killed and replaced with [[doppelganger]]s.

Emissary Tar did not survive her visit to the [[Iron Throne headquarters]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]. The meeting was a trap; Tar was slain by agents of [[Sarevok Anchev]] and her persona claimed by one of his doppelganger agents. Her body was hidden away in the tower's top floor.
