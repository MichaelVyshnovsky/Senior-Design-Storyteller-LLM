Grace Hardstone was a dwarven resident of Phandalin in the late 15 century DR.
She was friends with fellow teenagers Alana Hallwinter, Nedd Angelite, and Sasha Flint.
When she was a teenager in the 1490s DR, she and two dwarven friends&mdashNedd and Sasha&mdashbecame skeptical of some of the tall tales written by Volothamp Geddarm in the newly-published Volos Guide to Monsters. The three teens decided to travel to the Crooked Forest to investigate, where they captured by gnolls. Soon, their friend Alana arrived in the woods to search for them, but was captured as well. The harrowing ordeal left Grace and her friends in shock and barely able to speak.
