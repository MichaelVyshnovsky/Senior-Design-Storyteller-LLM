Jagress Dawnlion was a human Lathanderite priest that lived and died in southern Unther sometime before the Spellplague devastated the region.It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or Tymanchebar. However, owing to the adventure only making note of ruins of "the old Untheric Empire" and the presence of a Lathanderite sarcophagus, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther.
Jagress was buried wearing white robes, in a stone sarcophagus with their name etched into the lid, within the mausoleum of a burial site. Their sarcophagus was designed with a false bottom to hide their belongings within it, which included a number of gold pieces, a +1 amulet of mental resolution, and a +1 symbol of turning.
In the late 15 century DR, when the surrounding area was part of what was known as Tymanther, the mausoleum where Jagress rested was desecrated by a human necromancer and later a member of the Gem Assayers Union named Melnar. The former took Jagresss skull and enchanted it with Skull Watch to watch over the mausoleum. Later, a group of adventurers sent by Dirnth of the Gem Assayers Union to find Melnar would inspect Jagresss sarcophagus, finding their body had long since been destroyed but discovering the hidden compartment.
