        "mainbody": "'''Lander''' was a [[ranger]] and a member of the [[Harper]] from [[Sembia]] that operated in the desert of [[Anauroch]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|You helped a woman find her place. Now her people will have a chance at freedom.|Lander's vision of the Lady of the Forest.}}",
        "Description": "He was a generally average looking man save for the fact he wore an eye patch over his right eye.",
        "Personality": "Lander was a pragmatic man who was wholly dedicated to the goals of the Harpers and completing their missions by any reasonable means necessary. While honest and forthright, he was not above withholding information or speaking about a truth from a different perspective in achieve his objectives.\n\nHe was a devoted follower of [[Mielikki]].\">",
        "Possessions": "Among Lander's possessions were a couple of [[item enchantment|magical items]] including his ''[[Harper pin]]'' and an ''[[amulet of comprehend languages]]''.",
        "Relationships": "During his time working for the Harpers, Lander became quite close to the [[Bedine]] woman [[Ruha]], an exiled [[sorceress]] of the [[Mtair Dhafir]] tribe. Despite societal conventions that forbade her from being with others so soon after the death of her husband, Lander and Ruha became lovers. promising Ruha that they would travel to the lush landscape after they completed what they set out to in the desert.\n\nWhile in Anauroch, Lander worked with two [[D'tarig]] guides, [[Bhadla]] and [[Musalim]]. While he did not fully trust them, Lander relied on them unto a point before discovering they were in the employ of the [[Zhentarim]].",
        "History": "Lander was born in [[Sembia]] to a wealthy [[Archenbridge]] merchant and a mother who was a covert Zhentarim spy. His mother's true allegiance was revealed when Lander was a teenager, after she insisted on accompanying his father to a merchant meeting in [[Archendale]]. His father discovered the truth and warned people in Archendale about the Zhent plot. Lander's mother found her son and offered him a place among the Zhents, but the young man refused, instead slaying the Zhent agents and sparing his mother. In response, Lander's mother arranged the death of his father.\n\nSome time later, a member of the Harpers approached Lander and informed him of his mother's death. Lander decided to join the Harpers and stop the Zhents at any opportunity. \n\nDuring or just before the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Lander was in attendance at a Harper meeting in [[Shadowdale]], along with several senior members including [[Florin Falconhand]], [[Urso]], and [[Alustriel Silverhand]]. After some debate about growing Zhentarim activity in [[Anauroch]], Lander volunteered to serve as their spy. With the support of Florin Falconhand, Lander was granted the opportunity to prove himself.\n\nLander took some six months to travel to the desert and get to a point where he could meet with the sheikh of the [[Mtair Dhafir]] at [[El Rahalat]], to offer warning about forming any agreement with the Zhentarim. Although he could not convince the sheikh in time to save the Mtairi people from being overrun, Lander managed to slay the Zhent spokesman [[Zarud]] and ally himself with the sheikh's daughter Ruha, her brother-in-law [[Kadumi]]. The trio set out across the desert, uniting the numerous Bedine tribes under one cause, the preservation of their people in the face of the threat presented by the [[Zhentilar]] army.\n\nLander and Ruha proved successful, uniting the tribes together as a united front. While the allied Bedine suffered losses when the Zhent's poisoned a sacred Bedine oasis and even slaughtered an entire tribal camp while they slept, they proved victorious at the [[Balle of the Chasm]] and the [[Battle of the Fissures]]. Just before the united Bedine army set upon the ruined city of [[Orofin]] to deliver one final blow against the Zhent forces, Lander was slain by the assassin Bhadla, who was wielding a poisoned blade. In his final moments Lander had a vision of the goddess Mielikki, who told the young ranger he had successfully completed his task to aid the Bedine."
