        "mainbody": "'''Joatra Stelmar''' was a [[druid]] and an agent of the [[Knights of the North]] in [[1374 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Joatra first and foremost loved all kinds of birds and nobody could harm one of them in her presence, especially her knights. She had free command over her sky sentinels but was uninterested in the political decisions of the Knights.",
        "History": "Joatra originally was just a druid with a good feeling for [[dire hawk]]s in the [[Dragonspine Mountains]]. One day, she saved a group of the Knights of the North from a [[Zhentarim]] ambush, thanks to her hawks. So, they offered Joatra a position in the Knights and she accepted. She came to lead the [[Moonsea skysentinel]]s, a division of the Knights specifically created to counter the [[Zhentarim skymage]]s."
