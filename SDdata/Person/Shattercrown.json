He personally brought the Wintergnaw pack of winter wolves under his control by cowing them with his strength.\n\nOver several years, his efforts eventually unearthed Thrymstone and allowed him to access the main gates, but at this time the excavation came under attack by both the [[white dragon]]s of [[Kovanyrach]]&mdash;angered by the efforts to restore the ancient fortress which their ancestors had destroyed&mdash;and [[adventurer]]s from [[Waterdeep]] sent by [[Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]]&mdash;drawn to the conflict after [[goblinoid]]s fleeing from Shattercrown's rule had attacked [[Shimmersky Valley]].\n\nThe adventurers managed to invade Thrymstone, defeat Horrengar, and confront Shattercrown. Despite his bravado and great strength, Shattercrown was defeated. With his strength having been broken, the Frosthunger Horde scattered and the frost giants fled, many of them being killed by Kovanyrach's dragons. Despite his defeat, Shattercrown refused to relinquish his mission of restoring Thrymstone.",
        "Personality": "He was calm, confident, cruel, and driven, but it was his incredible strength that most characterized him and gained him the loyalty of his subordinates. Following even a heated battle, he would simply dust himself off and return to whatever task was at hand.",
        "Abilities": "{{fq\n| text   = Your tricks cannot overcome your frailty, Little Ones. Or protect you from my fists.\n| source = Shattercrown\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}Shattercrown fought with his fists, and would make a show of discarding his [[axe]] before a battle. He would pummel his foes and the battlefield alike to the roaring delight of his frost giant followers. He was remarkably resilient and very quick, seemingly with [[Thrym]]'s own reflexes. He specialized in disrupting his enemies' tactics and stunning them with his strikes.",
        "Relationships": "He was sworn enemies with the [[white dragon]]s of the [[Frozenfar]], notably [[Kovanyrach]].\n\nMost of his subordinates served him either out of fear or&mdash;in the case of his lieutenant [[Horrengar]] and the [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]] of the [[Wintergnaw|Wintergnaw pack]]&mdash;respect for his incredible strength.",
