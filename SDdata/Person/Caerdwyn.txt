'''Caerdwyn''' was an avid reader and a member of the [[Book Brigade]], a [[book]] club from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Caerdwyn was a [[half-elven]] woman with a light skin tone, light brown eyes, and straight steely grey hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Caerdwyn was part of a group that gathered monthly to discuss a pulpy book they all read. The group met at the [[Bloomridge Park]] and consisted of [[Morgan]] â€“ its organizer, [[Nansi Gretta]] of the [[The Bibliophile]], and [[gnome]] [[Kepli]] for whom Nansi had feeling. At some point during the [[Absolute crisis]], Nansi Gretta chose to leave the group due to her busy schedule running the bookstore, but Morgan still tried to entice the shopkeep to rejoin, using her affections for Kepli as an incentive. One of the works the group read was a smutty series of books, ''[[Dusk's Dark Desires]]'', about a [[werecow]] with the protagonist. Caerdwyn though the latest novella to be more lewd than its prequels, despite its flawless sense of intrigue and the werecow character to be written beautifully. The book club was in session in Bloomridge Park with a group of assassins worshippers of [[Bhaal]] who attempted to slaughter the park-goers in the middle of a day to venerate their monstrous [[deity]]. It was unknown if Morgan and her club survived.
