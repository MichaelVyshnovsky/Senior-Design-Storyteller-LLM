'''Akla''' was a monk at the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]].

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Akla was one of the monks kidnapped by cultists of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]], who planned to use them in a plot to access an [[elemental node]]. In one of the rooms of the node complex under the monastery, she was kept in the custody of some [[gargoyle]]s until an adventuring party hired by Grandmaster [[Perrywinkle Shin]] to find the missing monks defeated the gargoyles and freed her.
