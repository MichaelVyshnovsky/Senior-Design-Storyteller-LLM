'''Suzara Obarskyr''' was the wife of [[Ondeth Obarskyr]] and moved with him to the [[Forest Country]] to create a new life, and what would later become the nation of [[Cormyr]]. Its capital, [[Suzail]], was named after her.

==Relatives==
Suzara's husband was [[Ondeth Obarskyr]]. She had two sons, [[Rhiiman Obarskyr|Rhiiman]] and [[Faerlthann Obarskyr]], and a brother-in-law, [[Villiam Obarskyr]].

==Background==
Suzara did not like the lifestyle of the new settlement, preferring the company of other people in a larger town, and she had been vocal to Ondeth about this since the original move in [[6 DR]].. At some point she died and her body was placed under the roots of a fir tree. She was the first [[Ghazneth]].

==Ghazneth==
As a [[Ghazneth]], Suzara had the power of fire manipulation and control. She could spray crimson fire from her fingertips and create pits of hellfire that would burst upward and incinerate any unfortunate creature caught within the radius.

On her fir tree was engraved the typical [[Ghazneth]] poem, with her final line reading:
{{Quote|''"Here come ye, Faithless Suzara, and lie among these rootes."''}}
