'''Qwo''' was an old servant in [[Shou Lung]].

==History==
Qwo was the old family servant of Lady [[Wu]], the wife of General [[Batu Min Ho]].

In [[1359]], Qwo remained with his lady near the Emperor while Batu went to lead the campaign against the [[Tuigan]].

Lady Wu later discovered that there was a Tuigan spy inside the court and correctly deduced that the spy was the Minister of State Security [[Ting Mei Wan]]. Wu asked Qwo's help to arrest her.

However, Qwo was killed along with Lady Wu and all other members of her house when soldiers in the service of Ting Mei Wan stormed the palace where they lived.
