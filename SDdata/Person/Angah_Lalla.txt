'''Angah Lalla''' was a curios dealer and fence for stolen goods in the city of [[Scornubel]].

==Appearance==
Angah dressed in flowing off-white robes with a black veil. He wore a large gold rune-engraved ''[[amulet of protection]] +2'' around his neck. His long black hair was braided and tied with off-white cloth. He spoke in a hoarse whisper.{{Cite web/The Search for the Circle of Vehlarr/Part Two}}

==Background==
There were rumours that Angah was from the lands east of [[Thay]] and [[Rashemen]] or [[Zakhara|Zhakar]], mostly perpetuated by his dress sense and his reluctance to show his face.

Angah was actually a character invented by a married couple, [[Aareem]] and [[Leila]], who came to Scornubel from [[Sembia]] after angering a powerful prince. One half of the team was usually out collecting information while the other stayed behind in the shop. Aareem and Leila were both in their forties with a teenaged daughter named [[Ezther]], who also began assuming the guise of Angah.

==Shop==
Angah's shop was near the center of Scornubel and appeared large from the outside, but it was dimly lit with maze-like shelving arrangements within. The contents of the shop consisted of weapons, books, scrolls, armor, and other knick-knacks. There was a thick smell of incense inside. A hidden door operated within the shop.
