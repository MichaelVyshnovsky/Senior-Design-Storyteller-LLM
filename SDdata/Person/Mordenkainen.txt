==Description==
[[File:Mordenkainen - Epic Level Handbook.jpg|thumb|left|''Mordenkainen with his staff.'']]
Mordenkainen had a hawk-like face, with a permanent frown that gave the appearance of alertness and almost anger, and a penetrating gaze. He kept a close-trimmed beard and wore grey, high-collared robes. His voice was deep and melodic.{{Cite dragon/185/Magic in the Evening|57}}

While imprisoned in [[Barovia]], his hair and beard were both long, black and peppered with grey streaks. When mad, his eyes crackled with eldritch power.

He later changed his hairstyle, favoring a bald head and a trimmed goatee, but lost none of his penetrating  stare.

==Personality==
Typically stubborn and one who did not suffer fools gladly, Mordenkainen could be difficult even with his friends.

While suffering from his madness, he was convinced that enemies were everywhere and he was being constantly watched by evil agents.

==Possessions==
In addition to many [[scroll]]s and [[potion]]s, Mordenkainen was known to possess a ''[[bag of holding]]'', a set of ''[[bracers of defense]]'', a ''[[crystal ball]]'', a ''+1 [[dagger]]'', an ''[[efreeti bottle]]'', a ''[[wand of cold]]'', a ''[[wand of fear]]'', and three ''[[pearl of power|pearls of power]]''.

==Relationships==
[[File:Elminster_and_Mordenkainen-2e.jpg|thumb|270px|''Elminster and Mordenkainen in Ed Greenwood's living room, with Ed hiding inside a suit of armor.'']]
Mordenkainen was the leader of the Oerthian group of wizards known as the Circle of Eight, which included many spell inventors whose names were well known on [[Toril]], such as [[Bigby]], [[Drawmij]], [[Nystul]], [[Otiluke]], [[Otto (Greyhawk)|Otto]], [[Rary]], and [[Tenser]].

Mordenkainen was a good friend of [[Elminster Aumar]]; the two met on numerous occasions at [[Ed Greenwood]]'s house on [[Earth]] to exchange news from each other's worlds, as well as spells and lore, along with his apprentice, [[Rautheene]].{{Cite dragon/185/Magic in the Evening|56-63}} On occasion, the two were also joined by [[Dalamar]] of [[Krynn]].{{Cite dragon/188/The Wizards Three: Sorcery from Three Worlds|27-34}}<ref group="note">See also other articles in [[the Wizards Three]] series in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]]''.

He was also an acquaintance of [[Khelben Arunsun]].

==History==
Although Mordenkainen resided primarily on [[Oerth]], by at least the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, his spells were not uncommon among spellbooks in [[Faerûn]]. He often traveled to [[Waterdeep]] with his friends for revelry in a city where he would not be recognized.<ref>{{Cite dragon/211/The Wizards Three: A Night of Shadows|84}}

Following the demise of the Circle of Eight at the hands of [[Vecna]] during the lich's first failed attempt at obtaining [[greater deity]] status, a grieving Mordenkainen was consoled by Elminster, as the wizards reflected on the fragility of their good deeds.

At one point, Mordenkainen created the ''[[helmet of disjunction]]''; it's unknown if he ever made more than one.{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Legendary Magic Items}} It replicated the effect of his spell known as ''Mordenkainen's disjunction'',{{speculation}} making it capable of breaking any 'enchantment' within its vicinity.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} However, he later wanted nothing to do with that "accursed thing" for fear of it destroying all his magical possessions, and he angrily rejected [[Xenk Yendar]] when he came to him in [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' [[1400 DR]] seeking help dealing with it.

Mordenkainen later traveled to [[Demiplane of Dread#Barovia|Barovia]] in an attempt to free the local population from its [[vampire]] darklord [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. However, he underestimated Strahd's power and, after barely surviving a confrontation with him, he lost his spellbook and his staff, eventually losing his memory and being driven to the brink of madness. He became known by the locals as the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok.

In the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, Mordenkainen, still suffering from bouts of madness, was in Waterdeep, where [[Storm Silverhand]] and [[Elminster]] were helping him to recover from them.

By the {{YearlinkName|1494}},{{BG-DiA-time}} Mordenkainen inhabited the [[Tower of Urm]], a dwelling that he used as a vehicle to travel through the [[multiverse]]. He occasionally visited [[Avernus]] to study the effects of the [[Nine Hells]] over the schools of [[magic]] and to ensure the balance of the universe.

==Rumors and Legends==
His toenails appeared to be a venerated item in some places.<ref>{{cite book/Finder's Bane}}
