Mordenkainen (|audio=Mordenkainen.ogg  
Mordenkainen with his staff.
Mordenkainen had a hawk-like face, with a permanent frown that gave the appearance of alertness and almost anger, and a penetrating gaze. He kept a close-trimmed beard and wore grey, high-collared robes. His voice was deep and melodic.
While imprisoned in Barovia, his hair and beard were both long, black and peppered with grey streaks. When mad, his eyes crackled with eldritch power.
He later changed his hairstyle, favoring a bald head and a trimmed goatee, but lost none of his penetrating  stare.
Typically stubborn and one who did not suffer fools gladly, Mordenkainen could be difficult even with his friends.
While suffering from his madness, he was convinced that enemies were everywhere and he was being constantly watched by evil agents.
In addition to many scrolls and potions, Mordenkainen was known to possess a bag of holding, a set of bracers of defense, a crystal ball, a +1 dagger, an efreeti bottle, a wand of cold, a wand of fear, and three pearls of power.

Mordenkainen was the leader of the Oerthian group of wizards known as the Circle of Eight, which included many spell inventors whose names were well known on Toril, such as Bigby, Drawmij, Nystul, Otiluke, Otto, Rary, and Tenser.
Mordenkainen was a good friend of Elminster Aumar the two met on numerous occasions at Ed Greenwoods house on Earth to exchange news from each others worlds, as well as spells and lore, along with his apprentice, Rautheene. On occasion, the two were also joined by Dalamar of Krynn.See also other articles in the Wizards Three series in Dragon Magazine.
He was also an acquaintance of Khelben Arunsun.
Although Mordenkainen resided primarily on Oerth, by at least the , his spells were not uncommon among spellbooks in Faer√ªn. He often traveled to Waterdeep with his friends for revelry in a city where he would not be recognized.
Following the demise of the Circle of Eight at the hands of Vecna during the lichs first failed attempt at obtaining greater deity status, a grieving Mordenkainen was consoled by Elminster, as the wizards reflected on the fragility of their good deeds.
At one point, Mordenkainen created the helmet of disjunction its unknown if he ever made more than one. It replicated the effect of his spell known as Mordenkainens disjunction, making it capable of breaking any enchantment within its vicinity. However, he later wanted nothing to do with that "accursed thing" for fear of it destroying all his magical possessions, and he angrily rejected Xenk Yendar when he came to him in Waterdeep circa 1400 DR seeking help dealing with it.
Mordenkainen later traveled to Barovia in an attempt to free the local population from its vampire darklord Strahd. However, he underestimated Strahds power and, after barely surviving a confrontation with him, he lost his spellbook and his staff, eventually losing his memory and being driven to the brink of madness. He became known by the locals as the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok.
In the , Mordenkainen, still suffering from bouts of madness, was in Waterdeep, where Storm Silverhand and Elminster were helping him to recover from them.
By the , Mordenkainen inhabited the Tower of Urm, a dwelling that he used as a vehicle to travel through the multiverse. He occasionally visited Avernus to study the effects of the Nine Hells over the schools of magic and to ensure the balance of the universe.
His toenails appeared to be a venerated item in some places.
