        "mainbody": "Helena \"Hook\" Nostrum was a giantslayer who roamed around the Savage Frontier in the late 15 century DR.\nHelena had a strong will and a good sense of leadership, capable of keeping people under her command sharp and focused.\nSome time after the shattering of the Ordning in 1485 DR, when the Savage Frontier became a hotbed of squabbling giant activity, Helena witnessed the destructive power of giants firsthand. From that day forward she became a giantslayer, dedicating her life to always being one step ahead of the towering humanoids. She eventually joined up with two other adventurers to form a giantslayer organization &mdash Hook, Line, and Sinker. Within the group she acted as the impromptu leader, keeping everyone together."
