Heinrich was a scribe charged with keeping records for goods and raw materials passing through Harloch on Snowdown Ride. He spent his free time studying books on the history of the Moonshae Isles. He stumbled across a book in a shop in Westphal impaled with a strange horn. The book discussed the mysterious Moonwells found throughout the Moonshae Isles. When he removed the horn from the book a jolt of energy shot through his body. Ever since then he was obsessed with Moonwells and finding one. He learned about the existence of a single Moonwell on Snowdown and wished to visit the sacred place. His darker thoughts wondered what would happen if he tossed the strange horn into the Moonwell.
