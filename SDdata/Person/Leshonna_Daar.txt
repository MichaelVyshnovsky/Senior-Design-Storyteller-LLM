Leshonna Daar was a teenage rancher of Uluvin, who lived there during the late 15 century DR.
Leshonna and her friend Albie Grizlow left their home after it was overrun by a force of hill giants and goblins. Once they were safe, they sought out adventurers to help their fellow townsfolk, who were in hiding at the time.
