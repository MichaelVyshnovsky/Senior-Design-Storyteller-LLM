'''Leshonna Daar''' was a teenage rancher of [[Uluvin]], who lived there during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Leshonna and her friend [[Albie Grizlow]] left their home after it was overrun by a force of [[hill giant]]s and [[goblin]]s. Once they were safe, they sought out adventurers to help their fellow townsfolk, who were in hiding at the time.
