        "mainbody": "'''Merin Falle''' was a swift and hard-working [[hin]] cook of the [[Yawning Portal]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In [[Kythorn]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Merin was present at the inn along with her fellow cook [[Frinli Hinkille]] and the foul-tempered chef. A gaggle of [[drow]] [[assassin]]s emerged from the Yawning Portal's entrance to [[Undermountain]] and staged a slaughter of the gathered adventurers. Even though the attackers were repelled back into [[Undermountain]], Merin's worries over a fellow cook under-[[spice]]ing dishes started to seem not as dramatic as before."
