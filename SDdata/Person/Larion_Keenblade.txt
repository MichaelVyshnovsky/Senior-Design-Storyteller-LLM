'''Larion Keenblade''' was a member of [[Severin Silrajin|Severin]]'s reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]]. 

==History==
He was forcibly conscripted into the Cult and not very happy about his situation. He was part of the Cult's army in the assault on [[Greenest]]. Later, he was at the Cult's camp near the city. 

===Gameplay===
Adventurers could potentially befriend him and convince him to betray the Cult, providing them with very useful information.
