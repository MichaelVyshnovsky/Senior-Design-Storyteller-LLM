Larion Keenblade was a member of Severins reformed Cult of the Dragon. 
He was forcibly conscripted into the Cult and not very happy about his situation. He was part of the Cults army in the assault on Greenest. Later, he was at the Cults camp near the city. 
Adventurers could potentially befriend him and convince him to betray the Cult, providing them with very useful information.
