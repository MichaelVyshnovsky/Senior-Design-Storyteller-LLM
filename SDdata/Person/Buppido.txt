'''Buppido''' was a cunning [[derro]] murderer who lived in the [[Underdark]] during the late 1480s [[DR]].

==Personality==
Buppido was crazy at heart. He believed himself to be the living incarnation of the derro god [[Diinkarazan]] and, as the avatar of murder, he must offer bloody sacrifices to create a path of carnage through the [[Underdark]] for his people to follow to glory.

In his mind, any setbacks were part of his "divine plan". Convinced he was a god, he believed he could not be killed (or at least the death of his mortal form meant nothing to him), so he was completely fearless.

==History==
Buppido hailed from [[Gracklstugh]] but wandered the Underdark performing his carefully ritualized killings, hiding his true nature under a friendly facade.
During the late 1480s DR, he was captured by [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]].
