Skahmau the Wolfshead was a legendary villain in the fables of Cursrah. The hippopotamus hero Khises was supposed to have battled Skahmau at the bottom of the Mother of Rivers.
Princess Amenstar of Cursrah had a painting of this battle scene within her private privy. Pressing the eyes of Khises and Skahmau would open a secret door to the cellars below the royal compound, and she used it frequently to sneak away to be with her friends.
