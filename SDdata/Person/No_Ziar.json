        "Description": "Short-statured and hunch-backed, with a shaved head and such bad myopia that he was always squinting, his nickname was very fitting.",
        "Equipment": "No Ziar possessed an enchanted walking stick that bestowed an amazing power: the ability to summon and talk to pond turtles.",
        "Relations": "He was closely affiliated with the [[yakuza]] of [[Pan (town)|Pan]], and bore their mark: a small tattoo of a blue feather on the heel of his left hand.\n\nHis [[familiar]] was a raccoon called [[Mita]], which swelled to twice its natural size in a fight.",
        "Activities": "Ever greedy, this wu jen was ready to steal whatever he could lay his hands on that had magical powers. He stashed his stolen treasures in a keep located high in the Vorkani Mountains.\n\nNo Ziar also brewed potions that transformed people into aquatic creatures. He gained notoriety for tricking helpless people into having a quick meal and changing them into fish, such as [[tuna]] or whitefish. It seemed he and his familiar then ate the fish themselves.",
