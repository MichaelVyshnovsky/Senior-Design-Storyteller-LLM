        "mainbody": "No Ziar, called the mole, was a male human wu jen who dwelled in the Vorkani Mountains and in the settlement of Pan in Koryo around 1357 DR.\nShort-statured and hunch-backed, with a shaved head and such bad myopia that he was always squinting, his nickname was very fitting.\nNo Ziar possessed an enchanted walking stick that bestowed an amazing power the ability to summon and talk to pond turtles.\nHe was closely affiliated with the yakuza of Pan, and bore their mark a small tattoo of a blue feather on the heel of his left hand.\nHis familiar was a raccoon called Mita, which swelled to twice its natural size in a fight.\nEver greedy, this wu jen was ready to steal whatever he could lay his hands on that had magical powers. He stashed his stolen treasures in a keep located high in the Vorkani Mountains.\nNo Ziar also brewed potions that transformed people into aquatic creatures. He gained notoriety for tricking helpless people into having a quick meal and changing them into fish, such as tuna or whitefish. It seemed he and his familiar then ate the fish themselves.\nCategoryWu jen\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryInhabitants of Pan\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vorkani Mountains\nCategoryInhabitants of Silla\nCategoryInhabitants of Koguryo\nCategoryInhabitants of Koryo\nCategoryInhabitants of Northeast Kara-Tur\nCategoryInhabitants of Kara-Tur\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nnsjyl0mjp9kcps12a11cd2rrlxzbtbc"
