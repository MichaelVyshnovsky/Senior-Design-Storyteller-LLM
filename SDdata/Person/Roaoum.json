        "mainbody": "'''Roaoum''' was a [[locathah]] [[ranger]] and subchief of the [[Tiger Coral]] tribe as well as a member of the [[Nantarn Council]] in [[Myth Nantar]], [[Serôs]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "Roaoum was the son of chief [[Cuvis]]. For a long time, he had also been an acquaintance of Prince [[Mirol]] of the [[merfolk]].",
        "Activities": "Roaoum held the Locathah Seat on the Nantarn Council by [[1370 DR]]. However, out of all the councilors, he spoke the least and gave his thoughts only if requested. In fact, he considered most of the political discussions to be pointless and irritating and he cared only for the [[kelp]] harvest, [[fish]] hunting, winter food storage like all his fellow locathah. He was actually useful in advancing kelp production and food storage after the [[Twelfth Serôs War]]. In truth, Chief Cuvis waited to gain better weapons in trade for his tribe's woven [[net]]s and fish stores before he would help the alliance more."
