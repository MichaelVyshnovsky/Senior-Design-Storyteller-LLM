Ibtisam's real skill revolved around her ability to pick specific clothing to suit each customer and their particular body shape. Customers of hers included nobles from court. She was even invited to consult with members of the royal harim.

She charged 10 [[dinar]]s for a consultation.

Ibtisam's small home and shop was located near the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]] in the [[Court District]].
