        "mainbody": "Thukmuul Teleshann was a magister of Mystra at the Tower of Balance in Silverymoon in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nIn 1366 DR, Thukmuul ended one of his religious services by announcing Eriladar Leafsigil as his successor before leaving the Tower. He was seen quickly pacing towards the Moonbridge, before eventually disappearing in a flash of emerald colored light once he reached its highest point. Some noted that his manner of disappearance was similar to that of the High Mage Orjalun.\nIn the years that followed some attempted to inquire with Mystra about Thukmuuls whereabouts or activities, but such efforts proved fruitless."
