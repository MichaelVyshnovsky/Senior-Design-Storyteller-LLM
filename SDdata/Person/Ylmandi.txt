Ylmandi was a sorcerer and summoner from the ancient Netherese Empire, who lived over 3,000 years before Dale Reckoning.
Sometime around -3000 DR, Ylmandi came into a conflict with a warrior devotee of Amaunator, Kalamnin. The warrior was torn apart by Ylmandis summoned nycadaemons, rewarding the sorcerer with a powerful enchanted bastard sword – Amaunators Legacy. The blade remained in Ylmandis family up until the death of Netheril in Karsuss Folly.
