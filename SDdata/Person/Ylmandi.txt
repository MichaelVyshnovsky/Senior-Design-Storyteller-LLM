'''Ylmandi''' was a [[sorcerer]] and summoner from the ancient [[Netherese Empire]], who lived over 3,000 years before [[Dale Reckoning]].

==History==
Sometime around [[-3000 DR]], Ylmandi came into a conflict with a [[warrior]] devotee of [[Amaunator]], [[Kalamnin]]. The warrior was torn apart by Ylmandi's summoned [[nycadaemon]]s, rewarding the sorcerer with a powerful [[enchanted]] [[bastard sword]] – ''[[Amaunator's Legacy]]''. The blade remained in Ylmandi's family up until the death of Netheril in [[Karsus's Folly]].
