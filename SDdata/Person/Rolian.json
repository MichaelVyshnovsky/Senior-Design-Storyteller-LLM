        "mainbody": "Rolian was a warrior in the Frostfire Banner adventuring party ing the midâ€“8 century DR.\nHe found fatalism annoying.\nHe carried a sword.\nRolian was a member of the Frostfire Banner when they took on High Duke Horostoss assignment to search for the reason why all animals larger than ones hand, as well as most people, were vanishing on the road between Starmantle and Ripplestones.\nThey were ambushed on their first night out of Starmantle by a chiming mist, the Slayer. Rolian did notice the sound, but when he warned Paeregur, the latter moved to the edge of the cliff where theyd stopped to check up on Arvas. In the few moments while Paeregurs back was to Rolian, the Slayer struck at him, disintegrating him by the time Paeregur noticed, Rolians clothes fell over, and split in three pieces."
