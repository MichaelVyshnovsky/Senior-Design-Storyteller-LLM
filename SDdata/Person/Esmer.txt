'''Esmer''' was an [[Avowed]] monk of [[Candlekeep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Esmer was pockmarked, with straw-like unruly hair, and tall.

==Activities==
Esmer accompanied and helped people who investigated subjects in [[Candlekeep]].

==History==
In {{yearlink|1373}}, Esmer was the monk assisting Roablar of [[Lantan]] (actually Lady [[Noumea Cardellith]] in spell-guise) in their search for material regarding [[Thay]]. After explaining they did not show the Thayvian spells to anyone, the visitor answered that they were not looking for magic, but for their other activities. Together with other monks, Esmer volunteered more information, including the information they gained from talking to passing travelers and other, more covert and magical methods.
