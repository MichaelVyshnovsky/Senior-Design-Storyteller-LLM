Esmer was an Avowed monk of Candlekeep in the late 14 century DR.
Esmer was pockmarked, with straw-like unruly hair, and tall.
Esmer accompanied and helped people who investigated subjects in Candlekeep.
In , Esmer was the monk assisting Roablar of Lantan (actually Lady Noumea Cardellith in spell-guise) in their search for material regarding Thay. After explaining they did not show the Thayvian spells to anyone, the visitor answered that they were not looking for magic, but for their other activities. Together with other monks, Esmer volunteered more information, including the information they gained from talking to passing travelers and other, more covert and magical methods.
