==Description==
Erthaer was a tall man at over {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall, and was quite fit and strong. He had fair skin, gray eyes, a large aquiline nose, and wore his hair long and loose under his [[helmet]]. He had a thick, gravelly voice that commanded attention and a quick, hearty laugh when warranted.

He resembled himself in life as a ghost, though with a certain misty transparency and a hint of madness in his face.

==Personality==
Erthaer loved to wander and explore, but proved an effective ruler of his own land when given the chance. He managed his holdings in a careful and thoughtful manner, planning well ahead for the future, and was known for his fairness and generosity towards his subjects. His devotion to Starshadow Vale was so strong that he returned as a [[ghost]] to attempt to hold it for one more winter, and came to a single-minded obsession regarding its fulfillment and his hatred of [[orc]]s.

==Abilities==
As an experienced [[ranger]], Erthaer was an excellent fighter and tracker. He specialized in hunting down orcs, [[goblinoid]]s, and magical beasts, and was an expert at stealthily sneaking up on a target and cutting them down while unaware. He knew a few spells that he used to support his martial skills, including ''[[entangle]]'', ''[[plant growth]]'', ''[[alarm]]'', ''[[cat's grace]]'', and ''[[protection from energy]]''.

==Possessions==
Erthaer wore a suit of [[Eaerlann]]i  ''+3 [[mithral]] [[full plate]] of [[fire resistance]], [[invulnerability (property)|invulnerability]], and [[woodwalking]]''. He wielded ''[[Tuskreaver]]'', a ''+1 [[orc]] [[Bane (property)|bane]] [[longsword]]'', and Orcsloss, an orc blade formerly called Feyshot. He also had a ''+2 distance [[returning]] [[cold iron]] [[throwing axe]]'', and a ''[[horn of blasting]]'' called Erthaer's Horn.

==History==
Erthaer grew up in the royal halls of the palace at [[Delimbiyran (city)|Delimbiyran]] as the son of King [[Javilarhh Snowsword III]], but quickly took to wandering the wilderness surrounding the realm. In these travels, he fought many orcs and other denizens of the wilds, rescuing [[Mhaelorin]] and capturing Orcsloss in one particular battle. When he found the isolated valley of Starshadow Vale in the {{YearlinkName|691}}, he fell in love with the place and returned home to ask his nephew King [[Davyd Snowsword]] for a noble title to the Vale. Winning the King's support, Erthaer was named Baron of Dauntylgar and was promised that the title to the Vale would be granted in full should he or his heir hold it for twelve winters.

Arriving in the Vale with a loyal cohort and Swordcaptain Mhaelorin at his side, Erthaer's company seized the valley from the local [[High Forest orc]]s and monsters. Over the following years, he built his new realm carefully, ruling it fairly and generously with an eye to the future. This state of affairs was upturned when King Davyd was assassinated in the {{YearlinkName|697}}, and Delimbiyran shattered into competing claimants. A civil war followed and Starshadow Vale quickly became overpopulated with desperate folk who sought shelter from the unfolding chaos. Despite his best efforts, over the next few years the nearby [[High Forest]] was hunted and logged with reckless abandon, and the increasingly desperate settlers began looting the orcish burial mounds that lined the valley. This proved too much to bear, and the nearby orc populations united into the [[Horned Horde]] and swept through Starshadow Vale in retribution. Erthaer was shot with an [[arrow]] and died a slow, lingering death as his nascent realm was destroyed by the vengeful orcs, and was buried in the corpses of his followers and the rubble of [[Starshadow Tower]] as it was assaulted. As he lay dying amidst the ruins of his ambition, he turned defiant against fate and swore to the [[god]]s that he would not be stopped. Though he and Starshadow Vale were destroyed, his [[ghost]] remained and haunted the site, obsessed with finding new hands that would allow him to hold it for one more winter.

The first new attempt was in the {{YearlinkName|882}} when he possessed the [[adventurer]] [[Heldack Ironclaw]] and compelled him to rebuild the settlement, only for [[Nimoar]] the Reaver to sack the Vale on his way to [[Bloodhand Hold]]. Once more in the {{YearlinkName|1018}}, the possession of [[Tordath Ironfist]] led to a hopeful settlement of [[dwarves]], only for the [[red dragon]] [[Imvaernarhro]] to arrive and destroy everything. Again, in the {{YearlinkName|1222}}, Lord [[Ornigar Tchazzam]] of [[Waterdeep]] led a well-funded expedition that looted the old orcish burial mounds and provoked the [[Horned Lord]] and [[Tanglethorn]] tribes, causing them to form the [[Blackhorn Horde]] and destroy the Vale a second time. Finally in {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Erthaed possessed [[Daela Swiftarrow]] and began a new attempt to hold the Vale through winter. As winter began, Daela and her settlers struggled to survive attacks by orcish [[wight]]s and even the appearance of a [[dracolich]] that seemed fixated on destroying them.
