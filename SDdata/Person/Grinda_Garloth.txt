Grinda Garloth was a mad treasure hunter in Waterdeep during the early 1490s DR.
Grinda lived and worked in her laboratory in Mistshore. With her apparatus of Kwalish, she searched for treasures in the Deepwater Harbor.
In 1492 DR, Grinda had conflicts with the awakened shark Obliteros.
If the Xanathar managed to obtain the Stone of Golorr, he entrusted the Stone to Grinda. She agreed to take custody of the Stone but changed her mind and decided to use it for herself, ordering her familiar to hide it. Grinda was later besieged by Xanathars minions, who wanted the Stone back.
Grinda had made some business dealings with the Xanathars Thieves Guild. She had a rat familiar. Her family had a mausoleum in the City of the Dead.
