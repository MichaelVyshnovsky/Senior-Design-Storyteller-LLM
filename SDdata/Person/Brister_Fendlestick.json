        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1338}}, Fendlestick [[polymorph]]ed a [[pech]] into the [[hook horror]] known as \"[[Clacker]].\" Clacker was then returned to Brister by [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Belwar Dissengulp]] in order to reverse the spell, but before the transformation could be completed, Clacker lashed out and killed Fendlestick.\n\nThe cave where Fendlestick was killed had a fast-moving stream and was known as [[Fendlestick's Folly]]."
