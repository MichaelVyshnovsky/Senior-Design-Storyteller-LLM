'''Skedmoor''' was a butcher of the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Butcher Skedmoor sold several kinds of meat—beef, lamb, fish, and poultry, and so on. While he had his own shop, he delivered to inns and taverns in town by wagon. He had a good reputation for fresh meat.

==History==
Skedmoor and his men delivered a load of meat to [[Lukas Spoondrift]] of the [[Sheaf of Wheat]] inn on [[Eleint 18]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}; this was a special order to cater for the [[Merchants' Guild]] meeting the next day. While there, having heard Lukas blame [[Rolf (roofer)|Rolf]] the roofer for the murder of [[Dovo]], Skedmoor explained to [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] the origin of Lukas's enmity for Rolf, namely a feud over a collapsed roof.
