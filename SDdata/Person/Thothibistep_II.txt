Thothibistep II was the tenth pharaoh of Mulhorand and the second to not be a physical incarnation of the Mulhorandi god Horus-Re, but rather the god Thoth.
Thothibistep II was born in 885 DR. He ascended to the throne of pharaoh of Mulhorand in 925 DR, after the former pharaoh and family member Thothibistep I was slain by the wizard Nezrak following the Spelldoom.
He intended to rule as pharaoh only until a suitable incarnation of Horus-Re could take the throne. This occurred in 929 DR, when Akonhorus I took the throne. Thothibistep II would later die in the year 969 DR.
