'''Thothibistep II''' was the tenth [[pharaoh]] of [[Mulhorand]] and the second to not be a physical incarnation of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi god]] [[Horus-Re]], but rather the god [[Thoth]].

==History==
Thothibistep II was born in [[885 DR]]. He ascended to the throne of pharaoh of Mulhorand in [[925 DR]], after the former pharaoh and family member [[Thothibistep I]] was slain by the [[wizard]] [[Namrek|Nezrak]] following the [[Spelldoom]].

He intended to rule as pharaoh only until a suitable incarnation of Horus-Re could take the throne. This occurred in [[929 DR]], when [[Akonhorus I]] took the throne. Thothibistep II would later die in the year [[969 DR]].
