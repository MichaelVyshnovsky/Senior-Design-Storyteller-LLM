The daggers had a sapience of their own.\nBefore becoming the Magister, Valargrim Hond was a mercenary mage who had extensive fighting experience in the Vilhon Reach and Chessenta.

And before he was able to attain the powers of the office, Valargrim Honds enchanted daggers struck him down, and then escaped. Thus, Azuth offered the role of Magister to Ramarthant Horaerays."
