In the {{yearlinkName|1490}}, after conferring with [[Mystra]], [[Azuth]] offered the office of Magister to Valargrim Hond upon the retirement of [[Tannathra]].\n\nHe defended his office through numerous duels until the {{yearlinkName|1496}}, when he was slain in the [[Eyes of the Beholder]] club in [[Ormpetarr]], by six [[Red Wizards]] sent by [[Szass Tam]]. But his slayer never attained the powers of the office, as they were soon after killed by [[Handrar Rezgult]], a [[Zhentarim]] mage who was staying in the city. And before he was able to attain the powers of the office, Valargrim Hond's enchanted daggers struck him down, and then escaped. Thus, [[Azuth]] offered the role of Magister to [[Ramarthant Horaerays]]."
