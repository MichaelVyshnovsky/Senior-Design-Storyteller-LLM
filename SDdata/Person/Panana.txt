'''Panana''' was a [[rock gnome]] baker living in [[Gnomengarde]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Along with [[Uppendown]], Panana was responsible for prepping bread dough made from Gnomengarde's distinctive green mushrooms. Her role was to mix and knead the dough using a rolling contraption, which required her to stand atop her workbench in order to operate.

==Abilities==
Like all the other [[gnome]]s in Gnomengarde, Panana had some training as a [[wizard]] in addition to her innate abilities. In combat, she preferred to attack with [[spells]] like ''[[ray of frost]]'' and ''[[magic missile]]''.
