Yathlanae was a sorceress serving the Coronal of Cormanthyr in the 3 century DR.
In , she joined a meeting with the Srinshee and other sorceresses in the Vault of Ages, discussing that they needed to be watchful for the houses of the city and their response to a human made armathor.
She survived the fight with Llombaerth Starym and his forces when they struck against Coronal Eltargrim in , recovering a number of wands from the dead. She may have made use of them during the laying of the Mythal.
