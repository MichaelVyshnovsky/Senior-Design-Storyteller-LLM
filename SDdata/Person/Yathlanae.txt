'''Yathlanae''' was a sorceress serving the [[Coronal]] of [[Cormanthyr]] in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In {{yearlink|241}}, she joined a meeting with the [[Srinshee]] and other sorceresses in the [[Vault of Ages]], discussing that they needed to be watchful for the houses of the city and their response to a [[human]] made [[armathor]].{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|289|15}}

She survived the fight with [[Llombaerth Starym]] and his forces when they struck against [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim]] in {{yearlink|261}}, recovering a number of [[wand]]s from the dead. She may have made use of them during the laying of the ''[[Mythal]]''.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|357|Epilogue}}
