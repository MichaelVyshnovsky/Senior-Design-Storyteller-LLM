        "mainbody": "'''Darla Crivens''' was one of the inhabitants of [[Reithwin]], the town that once venerated [[Selûne]] in the [[Western Heartlands]], sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Darla perished in a tragic event sometime before the fall of Reithwin, before the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{Thorm-time}} and before it was consumed by the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]]. The event took the lives of Darla and almost every member of the Crivens clan, including the family [[dog]], outlived only by [[Errick Crivens]], who was, in some way, the cause of the tragedy. Darla Crivens was buried in Reithwin's graveyard behind the [[House of Healing]] in a cluster surrounded by the graves of her family. The tombstone read: \"Here rests Darla Crivens, taken along with her family on the same grim night. May their deaths be avenged.\" The Crivens family's grave markers remained relatively undamaged and legible as of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}."
