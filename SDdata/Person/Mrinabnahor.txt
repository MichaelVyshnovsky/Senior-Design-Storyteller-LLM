'''Mrinabnahor''' was a [[black dragon]] who laired in the mountains west of the [[Moonsea]]. In [[590 DR]], he battled and killed Arms-Major [[Pirphal]] of [[Myth Drannor]], along with most of his patrol. Pirphal's sword, ''[[Dragathil]]'', was added to Mrinabnahor's hoard and remained lost for the next four centuries.<ref name=tGHotR-p92><ref name=C:EoE-p41-42>
