        "mainbody": "'''Sarndaen Dalabar''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|998}} to {{yearlink|1066}}. He became known as \"The Opener\", for his work on documenting ''[[portal]]s''.",
        "Personality": "Sarndaen Dalabar often played the part of a shy, bumbling apprentice with barely any ambition. His greatest passion was exploration.",
        "Abilities": "Besides being amongst the most puissant magisters, Sarndaen Dalabar was an excellent actor.",
        "History": "Before his challenge of [[Meldryn Jalensifer]], Sarndaen Dalabar had been the apprentice to three wizardly masters in [[Athkatla]], all of which eventually embroiled themselves in mercantile intrigues that became their undoing. After his challenge, he spent a few days in Meldryn Jalensifer's company, prior to finally slaying him with three ''[[meteor swarm]]s''.\n\nOnce the [[Magister]], he worked to keep the most powerful mages opposed to each other, so they wouldn't turn their attention to him; he fulfilled his task to spread magic by giving magic to a few promising apprentices and calling on them to spread magic on his behalf. Then he, personally, devoted himself to exploring and making a map of all the gates he came across. Besides filling up books, he created ''[[the Opener's map]]'', in a castle within the [[Ice Mountains]]; his work was cut short when he died in an avalanche after crossing through an unrecorded ''[[portal]]''.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Sources stress that though there was nothing left down about Sarndaen being responsible for the downfall of his three previous masters, there would be nothing recorded either way."
