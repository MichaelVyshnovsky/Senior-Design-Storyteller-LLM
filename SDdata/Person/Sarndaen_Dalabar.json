        "mainbody": "Sarndaen Dalabar was the Magister from  to . He became known as \"The Opener\", for his work on documenting portals.\nSarndaen Dalabar often played the part of a shy, bumbling apprentice with barely any ambition. His greatest passion was exploration.\nBesides being amongst the most puissant magisters, Sarndaen Dalabar was an excellent actor.\nBefore his challenge of Meldryn Jalensifer, Sarndaen Dalabar had been the apprentice to three wizardly masters in Athkatla, all of which eventually embroiled themselves in mercantile intrigues that became their undoing. After his challenge, he spent a few days in Meldryn Jalensifers company, prior to finally slaying him with three meteor swarms.\nOnce the Magister, he worked to keep the most powerful mages opposed to each other, so they wouldnt turn their attention to him he fulfilled his task to spread magic by giving magic to a few promising apprentices and calling on them to spread magic on his behalf. Then he, personally, devoted himself to exploring and making a map of all the gates he came across. Besides filling up books, he created the Openers map, in a castle within the Ice Mountains his work was cut short when he died in an avalanche after crossing through an unrecorded portal.\nSources stress that though there was nothing left down about Sarndaen being responsible for the downfall of his three previous masters, there would be nothing recorded either way."
