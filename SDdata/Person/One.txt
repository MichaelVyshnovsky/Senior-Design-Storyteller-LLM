'''One''' was the name of a [[goblin]] child that dwelled within the [[Shattered Sanctum]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Again! Again! Make it squeal again!}}

==Personality==
Despite his few years on [[Faer√ªn]], One developed something of a sadistic side and felt glee as other creatures suffered.

==Relationships==
Along with the other goblin younglings of the sanctum, One was given a number rather than a name to distinguish him from his peers.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, One and several other goblin children went down to torment a giant [[bear]] when it was brought to the dungeons of the Shattered Sanctum. Little did they know that bear was actually a transformed [[archdruid]] named [[Halsin]].
