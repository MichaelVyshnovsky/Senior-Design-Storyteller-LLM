        "mainbody": "'''Alakraena Xorlarrin''' was a [[priestess]] of [[Lolth]] from [[House Xorlarrin]] that found herself participating in the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] in the 1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}",
        "Description": "As a typical priestess of Lolth, Alakraena wore an elaborate spider-themed outfit, including a [[bustenhalt]] that bared much of her skin.",
        "Abilities": "Alakraena could call on a number of powerful [[divine spell]]s from her mistress, including ''[[greater command]]'', ''[[cometfall]]'', ''[[unholy blight]]'', ''[[symbol of pain]]'', and ''[[flame strike]]''. She could also innately ''[[see invisibility]]'' and could sacrifice a willing ally to Lolth in exchange for a powerful boon.",
        "History": "Around the time of the [[Darkening]], Alakraena was kept captive by fellow priestess [[Teira Szind]] after being taken prisoner in battle. Despite this situation, they worked together as a team in the broader war effort, if only to please Lolth. In one particular instance they captured a priestess of [[Amaunator]] in the [[King's Forest]], but Alakraena and Teira were unable to come to agreement over precisely how to ritually sacrifice the poor woman. This argument lasted so long that [[Cormyr]]ean forces were able to catch up to them and rescue the Amaunatori priestess, likely killing the pair in the process."
