        "mainbody": "Alakraena Xorlarrin was a priestess of Lolth from House Xorlarrin that found herself participating in the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the 1480s DR.\nAs a typical priestess of Lolth, Alakraena wore an elaborate spider-themed outfit, including a bustenhalt that bared much of her skin.\nAlakraena could call on a number of powerful divine spells from her mistress, including greater command, cometfall, unholy blight, symbol of pain, and flame strike. She could also innately see invisibility and could sacrifice a willing ally to Lolth in exchange for a powerful boon.\nAround the time of the Darkening, Alakraena was kept captive by fellow priestess Teira Szind after being taken prisoner in battle. Despite this situation, they worked together as a team in the broader war effort, if only to please Lolth. In one particular instance they captured a priestess of Amaunator in the Kings Forest, but Alakraena and Teira were unable to come to agreement over precisely how to ritually sacrifice the poor woman. This argument lasted so long that Cormyrean forces were able to catch up to them and rescue the Amaunatori priestess, likely killing the pair in the process."
