        "mainbody": "albaste Avithoul was the matron mother of House Avithoul during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar and the hunt for the Thread of the Weave in the 1480s DR.\nDuring the Darkening, Balbaste allied with House Szind and DunRobar and contributed her houses forces to the attack on Eveningstar, with a special focus on capturing surfacers for slavery. When the counterattack came, it was through an unexpected source her former slave Mirini Elemys. Mirini had earned the \"affection\" of her mistress, and was henceforth kept close to more easily play with. This gave Mirini a good look at the layout of House Avithoul and Balbastes magical devices, allowing the elf to steal a wand of invisibility and use a portal to escape the city. When Mirini reached Eveningstar, she worked with the Wizard of War Aptem Mews to send a team of adventurers back to House Avithoul, where they caused a slave revolt, destroyed their treasures, and killed countless house members."
