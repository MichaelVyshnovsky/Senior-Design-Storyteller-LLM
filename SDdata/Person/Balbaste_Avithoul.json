        "Matron Balbaste of House Avithoul - You may take those captured in [[Cormyr]] for your slave pits. If you deem them too weak for even that, save their choicest parts for sacrifice to our Queen. Set aside a few strong ones as well. It is fit that we offer [[Lolth]] quality sacrifice in addition to quantity.\n|High Priestess [[Hekta Szind]]'s missive\n}}": "=History==",
        "mainbody": "ring the [[Darkening]], Balbaste allied with [[House Szind]] and [[Dun'Robar]] and contributed her house's forces to the attack on [[Eveningstar]], with a special focus on capturing surfacers for slavery. When the counterattack came, it was through an unexpected source: her former slave [[Mirini Elemys]]. Mirini had earned the \"affection\" of her mistress, and was henceforth kept close to more easily play with. This gave Mirini a good look at the layout of House Avithoul and Balbaste's magical devices, allowing the [[elf]] to steal a ''[[wand of invisibility]]'' and use a ''[[portal]]'' to escape the city. When Mirini reached Eveningstar, she worked with the [[Wizard of War]] [[Aptem Mews]] to send a team of [[adventurer]]s back to House Avithoul, where they caused a slave revolt, destroyed their treasures, and killed countless house members.",
