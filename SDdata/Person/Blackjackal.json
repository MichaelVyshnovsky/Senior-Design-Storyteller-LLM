When a [[couatl]] covered in strange markings fell out of the sky into the blueberry field, the elves and mounds did not think much of it, but its decomposing corpse infected the blueberries with a form of vine blight. The elves blamed their leader for this, and Blackjackal urged them to crush his head with a rock, assuming leadership for himself.\n\nBlackjackal formed an alliance with some of the shambling mounds, and the elves and mounds roamed the starwood, attacking whoever they found in the name of [[Talos]].<ref>",
