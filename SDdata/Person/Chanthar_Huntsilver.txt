'''Chanthar Huntsilver''' was a member of the noble [[Huntsilver]] family in [[Cormyr]]. He was the head of his house for many years until his death in the {{YearlinkName|1203}}.

==Description==
Chanthar had red hair that fell out prematurely due to disease, but he managed to keep his mustache. To cover his bald pate, he always wore a hat, and the rest of his attire was typically ornate and colorful. He gained a scar on his face when he intercepted an assassin's blade meant for King [[Pryntaler Obarskyr|Pryntaler]].

==Personality==
Chanthar was a proud man and was overly sensitive about his baldness, reacting poorly to any hair-related jokes.

==History==
Chanthar was the person who managed to wound the [[Hullack Hawk]]â€”a brigand that plagued merchants and settlers in western [[Sembia]] and caused tensions between that land and Cormyr. He called upon [[Donder Cormaeril]] and [[Althallan Crownsilver]] to help him hunt down the Hawk and bring him to justice, but the search party never found the elusive bandit.{{Cite dragon/281/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 4|77}}

==Rumors & Legends==
According to renowned explorer [[Volothamp Geddarm]], the reason Chanthar's search party came up empty was because the Hullack Hawk was in reality [[Beldarm Truesilver]], a Cormyrean noble in league with, or at least aided by, Donder and Althallan in their scheme to foment unrest in Sembia and have the blame fall upon [[Eltrym Drauthglas]], the Lord of Hullack.
