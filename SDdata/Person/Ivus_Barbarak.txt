Ivus Barbarak was the proprietor of the Holdfast Inn of Liams Hold in the late-14 century DR.
Ivus Barbarak was a charismatic man with exquisitely-groomed facial hair. His body language and facial expressions were that of a man whove seen everything, several times. His affable personality was accentuated by Ivuss love of puns.
Ivus Barbaraks cousin Aldernar was a member of Amnian navy who sent the owner of the Holdfast Inn a curious giant nautilus shell from the Moonshae Isles. However, Ivus suspected that Aldernar simply bought it as a cheap trinket in the Waukeens Promenade in Athkatla.
Ivus was the face of the Holdfast Inn. He handled the front-office part of the business, while his beloved wife, a half-dwarf Nuli Barbarak, handled the kitchen and back-end. In 1372 DR Ivus managed to hire a renowned musical guest from the city of Waterdeep - Evani and her fantastical Fantabulizer. The innkeep was beside himself in joy of hosting such a guest. During the same time, the Holdfast Inn welcomed the adventurer known as the Hero of Daggerford who aided the hamlets disappearing cattle and graciously delivered a keg of finest ale to an eccentric resident of the town - Rab Bitnez.
