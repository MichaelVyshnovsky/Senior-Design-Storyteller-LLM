'''Ivus Barbarak''' was the proprietor of the [[Holdfast Inn]] of [[Liam's Hold]] in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Ivus Barbarak was a charismatic man with exquisitely-groomed facial hair. His body language and facial expressions were that of a man who've seen everything, several times. His affable personality was accentuated by Ivus's love of puns.

==Relationships==
Ivus Barbarak's cousin [[Aldernar]] was a member of [[Amn]]ian navy who sent the owner of the Holdfast Inn a curious giant nautilus shell from the [[Moonshae Isles]]. However, Ivus suspected that Aldernar simply bought it as a cheap trinket in the [[Waukeen's Promenade]] in [[Athkatla]].

==History==
Ivus was the face of the Holdfast Inn. He handled the front-office part of the business, while his beloved wife, a [[half-dwarf]] [[Nuli Barbarak]], handled the kitchen and back-end. In [[1372 DR]] Ivus managed to hire a renowned musical guest from the city of [[Waterdeep]] - [[Evani]] and her fantastical Fantabulizer. The innkeep was beside himself in joy of hosting such a guest. During the same time, the Holdfast Inn welcomed the adventurer known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]] who aided the hamlet's disappearing cattle and graciously delivered a keg of finest [[ale]] to an eccentric resident of the town - [[Rab Bitnez]].
