Erethun Rivenstave was a member of the Council of Seven Burghers of Harrowdale in 1368 DR.
Around 1359 DR, Erethuns predecessor suddenly died and Erethun was elected to the Council thanks to his wealth, despite nobody liking or trusting him. In truth, Erethun was an agent of Mulmaster who had killed his predecessor. He plotted to eventually replace all the other councilors with his own thralls.
In order to strengthen his magic, he wanted to hire evil adventurers to find scrolls, spellbooks, and magic items.
Erethun knew very well that Selfaril planned to kill him after Mulmaster seized the dale. So he plotted to fake his death and escape using a carefully created disguise.
