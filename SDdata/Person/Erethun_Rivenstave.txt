'''Erethun Rivenstave''' was a member of the [[Council of Seven Burghers]] of [[Harrowdale]] in [[1368 DR]].

==History==
Around [[1359 DR]], Erethun's predecessor suddenly died and Erethun was elected to the Council thanks to his wealth, despite nobody liking or trusting him. In truth, Erethun was an agent of [[Mulmaster]] who had killed his predecessor. He plotted to eventually replace all the other councilors with his own thralls.

In order to strengthen his magic, he wanted to hire evil adventurers to find scrolls, spellbooks, and [[magic item]]s.

==Personality==
Erethun knew very well that [[Selfaril Uoumdolphin|Selfaril]] planned to kill him after Mulmaster seized the dale. So he plotted to fake his death and escape using a carefully created disguise.
