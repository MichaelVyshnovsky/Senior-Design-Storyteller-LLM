Delnor was a palace messenger in Suzail, during the late 15 century DR.
He was a nervous person.
Delnor was assigned by Glathra Barcantle to accompany Arclath Delcastle and have him identify the masked dancer at the Dragonriders Club who had been eavesdropping on him and his friends Belnar Buckmantle and Halance Tarandar, both of which had been murdered. Though Arclath tried to get some rumors out of him after they arrived early at Dragonriders, he had nothing useful.
Together at the Dragonriders Club, they tried to find out about the masked dancer however, they were unable to learn anything from the proprietress, Tress. By sheer chance, they came across the same dancer while she was out tossing her nightsoil into a passing cart Arclath then convinced Delnor to leave the rest to him.
Delnor joined Arclath again by the evening unfortunately for him, three wayward nobles, Delasko Sornstern, Broryn Windstag, and Kathkote Dawntard, entered the establishment drunk and looking for trouble. After Delnor tried to convince them to leave, he was struck senseless. Per Amarune Whitewaves word, they felled the man, strongly implying they killed him.
