'''Delnor''' was a palace messenger in [[Suzail]], during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was a nervous person.

==History==
Delnor was assigned by [[Glathra Barcantle]] to accompany [[Arclath Delcastle]] and have him identify the masked dancer at the [[Dragonriders Club]] who had been eavesdropping on him and his friends [[Belnar Buckmantle]] and [[Halance Tarandar]], both of which had been murdered. Though Arclath tried to get some rumors out of him after they arrived early at Dragonriders, he had nothing useful.

Together at the Dragonriders Club, they tried to find out about the masked dancer; however, they were unable to learn anything from the proprietress, [[Tress]]. By sheer chance, they came across the same dancer while she was out tossing her [[nightsoil]] into a passing [[dung wagon|cart]]; Arclath then convinced Delnor to leave the rest to him.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|163-169|16}}

Delnor joined Arclath again by the evening; unfortunately for him, three wayward nobles, [[Delasko Sornstern]], [[Broryn Windstag]], and [[Kathkote Dawntard]], entered the establishment drunk and looking for trouble. After Delnor tried to convince them to leave, he was struck senseless.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|215-221|21}} Per [[Amarune Whitewave]]'s word, they felled the man, strongly implying they killed him.
