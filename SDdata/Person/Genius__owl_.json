They inhabited one of the few floor-to-ceiling cages within the Menagerie, with half a tree trunk leaning inside of it, alongside a [[raven]] by the name of [[Noble (raven)|Noble]].",
        "Activities": "Genius was only known to be active in the Menagerie during the night. This was part of the reason for why the two avians largely got along, though they did occasionally squabble with each other."
