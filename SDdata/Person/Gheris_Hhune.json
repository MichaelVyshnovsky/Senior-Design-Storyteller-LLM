Along with Blaise Hhune, Duver Rillyn, and other werewolves, Gheris massacred a party of influential guests at the Szarr Palace, shortly before Cazador attempted to perform his ascension ritual. Gheris was guarding the passage past the massacre site to Cazadors dungeon, and sought to please his master and gain his favor. The beasts and lycanthropes were likely put out of their misery by the Absolute Adversaries and the vampire spawn Astarion Ancun√≠n."
