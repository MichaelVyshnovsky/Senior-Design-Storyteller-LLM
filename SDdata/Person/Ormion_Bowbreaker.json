        "mainbody": "'''Ormion Bowbreaker''' was a male [[Chondathan]] [[human]] [[psion]] (seer) and a soldier based at [[Castle Crag]] in [[Cormyr]] in the 1370s [[DR]].\n\nA young man, Ormion was one of the [[psionicist]]s hired by Commander [[Bren Tallsword]] to instantly transmit secure messages via [[telepathy]] to [[Arabel]] in the event the castle was attacked. However, Ormion's powers went a step further—he successfully foresaw a vicious raid by [[gnoll]]s. The [[War Wizards]] came to interrogate Ormion and the others and confirmed their loyalty. This proved the effectiveness of [[psionics]] in the army, triggering a recruitment drive for more psionically gifted soldiers by [[1374 DR]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionics Across the Land}}",
