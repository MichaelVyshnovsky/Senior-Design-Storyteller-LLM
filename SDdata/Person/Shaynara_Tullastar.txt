Shaynara Tullastar was the Fourth Reader of Candlekeep and a member of the Moonstars in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
She was fascinated by the knowledge she gained from a book that Khelben Arunsun permitted her to copy for the library.
Shaynara was one of the most valuable researchers at Candlekeep. She was in contact with Khelben for a long time, exchanging correspondence and precious books. She kept her membership of the Moonstars secret but the Second Reader Ulraunt knew the truth and approved, despite the Harpers views on the Moonstars.
She was in 1374 DR among the many powerful mages Arunsun brought together in order to cleanse part of the High Moor and restore Faertelmiir, a lost city of Miyeritar.
