'''Shaynara Tullastar''' was the Fourth Reader of [[Candlekeep]] and a member of the [[Moonstars]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].

==Personality==
She was fascinated by the knowledge she gained from a book that [[Khelben Arunsun]] permitted her to copy for the library.

==Activities==
Shaynara was one of the most valuable researchers at Candlekeep. She was in contact with Khelben for a long time, exchanging correspondence and precious books. She kept her membership of the Moonstars secret but the Second Reader [[Ulraunt]] knew the truth and approved, despite the [[Harpers]]' views on the Moonstars.

==History==
She was in [[1374 DR]] among the many powerful mages Arunsun brought together in order to cleanse part of the [[High Moor]] and restore [[Faer'tel'miir]], a lost city of [[Miyeritar]].<ref>
