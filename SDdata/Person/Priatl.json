        "Activities": "Priatl ruled over the territory alongside the human quarter and the human market. In his territory's restricted areas, [[human]]s must be killed on sign.",
        "Personality": "Priatl was a kind of religious fanatic. He believed that they lived in a new world where the [[Viperhands]] would rule over humans. He believed [[Jeordros]] a fool and [[Michitl]] too weak, so in his mind he was the best candidate to be leader of all Azatl."
