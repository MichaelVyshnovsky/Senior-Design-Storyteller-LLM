Lord Haventh was a wine merchant and one of the members of the wealthy high society of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
At some point, Lord Haventh set his eyes and amorous ambitions on Lady Firelia Jannath, one of the citys patriars and a notable patroness of the arts. He was among suitors who fought for the ladys hand in the , when her lover, Oskar Fevras, was presumed missing or killedâ€”in reality, captured and enslaved by Zhentarim smugglers. Lord Haventh requested to give his condolences in person to Firelia, over a glass of red wine from the merchants recent shipment.
