        "mainbody": "arbin Tul was a wandering bard on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR.\nTarbin Tul performed along the High Road and always looked for new tunes to add to his enormous collection. Circa 1491 DR, while staying at the Wayside Inn one night, he accidentally witnessed an undead attack. The undead had been created by the cult of Myrkul led by Ularan Mortus. A group of adventurers was able to defend the inn against the attack.\nLater, while Tarbin was again staying at the Wayside Inn, a cult of Talos led by Fheralai Stormsworn took over the inn. Although the cultists ritual to turn the inn into a temple of Talos was stopped in time, they managed to kidnap Tarbin. Eventually, the same group of adventurers came to the Tarbins rescue and freed him from his captivity."
