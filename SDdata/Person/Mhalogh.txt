'''The Mhalogh''' was a minor noble of the [[Jedea]] family of [[Mordulkin]] in [[Chessenta]]."The Mhalogh of Mordulkin" is only described as "a minor noble". The implication is that the Mhalogh is a noble of Mordulkin, but it is possible he/she acquired nobility in another location or was a born noble of another location who moved to Mordulkin. Mordulkin is described as a "family enclave" of the Jedea family, implying that, if the Mhalogh is a noble of Mordulkin, then the Mhalogh is of the Jedea family.

By [[1356 DR]], the Mhalogh was taken on as a lesser partner of the [[Dragoneye Dealing Coster]] based in [[Cimbar]], and remained in that position past [[1367 DR]].
