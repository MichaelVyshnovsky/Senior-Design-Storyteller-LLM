        "mainbody": "'''Malda''' was a cook at [[Thistleflame Manor]] and servant of Lord [[Partic Thistle]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Malda was very reliable and enthusiastic about her work at the Manor, which secured her employment despite her lack of ability.",
        "Activities": "Despite being a cook, Malda actually had little talent in the field. When left to her own devices, she would boil the subject until it scarcely resembled food. To protect the Manor's meals, [[Nora and Dora]] assigned her much of the preparatory work in the kitchen, as well as the handling of things that she couldn't ruin, like water for tea, boiled potatoes, and boiled eggs.",
        "Relationships": "Like Nora and Dora, she found [[Dom]]'s histrionic baking style annoying and tiring to witness."
