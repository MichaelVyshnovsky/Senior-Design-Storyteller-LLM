'''Boubakar''' was the spymaster of [[Golconda]] in [[Turmish]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Activities==
Boubakar directed the spies of the small kingdom of Golconda.

==History==
In [[1355 DR]], the self-styled king of [[Muktar]], [[Yrkhetep|Hetep]], started a war against Golconda. In 1358 DR, during a war council, Boubakar reported to King [[Samakay]] that one of his men had discovered that Hetep' battle plans were hidden in the small keep of [[Fort Blood]]. Boubakar convinced the king that they needed to send a small party to recover the papers in order to win the war, despite Count [[Belim]]'s objections. Samakay hired an adventuring party well-known to him to resolve the matter.

After the surprise death of King Samakay without an heir, Boubakar presented a parchment signed by King Samakay on his deathbed that nominated the adventurers as temporary commanders of Golconda's army until a new king was crowned. Thanks to this, Golconda defeated Muktar's troops for good at the [[Battle of the Wilma Pass]].
