        "mainbody": "In response to all this, Volo naturally switched his focus to his secondary interest—writing travel guides documenting Faerûn.Although not stated explicitly, Volo's switch to writing travelogues seems to be a subtle joke about him having to go on the run from the many mages out to get him. But once again, he would not enjoy immediate success. The earliest known, ''Volo's Guide to the Moonsea'', written over [[1357]] and [[1358 DR]], was similarly suppressed, now by the Zhentarim. His next works, ''Volo's Guide to the Vast'', written from [[1358]] to [[1360 DR]], and ''Volo's Guide to the Bloodstone Lands'', written from [[1360 DR|1360]] to [[1362 DR]], also went unreleased. Meanwhile, ''Volo's Guide to Westgate and the Dragon Coast'' was written some time in the early 1360s DR on commission by a noble of [[Yhaunn]], [[Sembia]], so it remained in private ownership. Continuing a theme, ''Volo's Guide to Calimport'' was written over [[1364 DR|1364]] and [[1365 DR]] but all final drafts were destroyed by [[Calimshan|Calishite]] [[pasha]]s and [[Rundeen]] agents and only notes and an old draft remained.\n\nOne of his first travel guides to see publication was ''Volo's Guide to the Frozenfar'', published in 1364 DR. Nevertheless, it notably exposed the [[Hanging Lantern]] [[festhall]] as a front for a kidnapping operation by the [[Unseen]] when Volo casually mentioned that all the courtesans were in fact [[doppelganger]]s. Although a significant setback for the Unseen and putting Volo on the doppelgangers' hit list should he ever wander into Waterdeep again, it only increased interest in the establishment.<ref><ref>\n\nThis unwilling yet fruitful writing partnership continued with Volo's next few works, with ''Volo's Guide to the North'' written over 1365 to [[1366 DR]], ''Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast'' written over 1366 and [[1367 DR]], ''Volo's Guide to Cormyr'' written over 1367 to 1368 DR, ''Volo's Guide to the Dalelands'' written over 1368 to [[1369 DR]], and ''Volo's Guide to the Lands of Intrigue'', written over 1369 to [[1370 DR]]. These would all made it to publication.\n\nAt some point, Volo helped foil a conspiracy by the Unseen and their leader the doppelganger [[Hlaavin]] that apparently threatened all Faerûn. He thought that Khelben Arunsun would owe him one after that.<ref>\n\n===Volo's Guide to Trying Again===\nIn the late 1360s DR,<ref group=\"note\" name=\"PrologueDate\">Although the \"Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction\" timeline places the ''[[Realms of Magic]]'' framing stories \"Prologue\" and \"Epilogue\" in 1366 DR, they expressly follow ''[[Once Around the Realms]]'', which \"Presenting...\" places in [[1367 DR]]. Moreover, ''Once Around the Realms'' has its own significant dating discrepancy. In addition, \"Prologue\" implies the in-universe ''Volo's Guide to the Dalelands'' is forthcoming, but \"The Candlekeep Collection\" article says it was written over 1368–1369 DR. However, both characters in this framing story could be mistaken or lying, with Justin Tym being a doppelganger and Volo being Volo. Volo returned to Waterdeep, where he had a meeting with Justin Tym to discuss business and future plans. Justin pressed Volo for forthcoming works. Volo promised he was working on ''Volo's Guide to the Moonsea'' and would soon journey to [[Mulmaster]] for research.<ref group=\"note\">\"The Candlekeep Collection\" article compiled later has ''Volo's Guide to the Moonsea'' written 10 years earlier and suppressed. Perhaps Volo means to write a new version; if so, none is known to have seen print. Instead, he offered up his magnum opus once again: ''Volo's Guide to All Things Magical, the Revised, Authorized, & Expanded Edition''. This time, he claimed to use only secondhand sources: interviews, legends, and stories, all documented, verifiable, and publicly available, with no stolen secrets (not that he admitted to having used any the first time around)\n\nIn any case, after \"due passage of time\" (a decade), Elminster had now agreed that a new ''Volo's Guide to All Things Magical'' should be published, if only to prevent people searching in vain for the original version. From his own last-remaining copy, Elminster corrected, edited, and censored the work and released a new version in 1367 DR. Then he destroyed his own last copy of the original.\n\nLater, Volo visited the [[War Wizard (club)|War Wizard]] club in Cormyr, braving the price on his head in that kingdom at the time to handle some business before he departed again for the Dalelands. While there, Elminster arrived and introduced Volo to his would-be apprentice [[Presto]] to give him a potted geography lesson. After they left, [[Ed Greenwood]] and [[Julia Martin]] arrived and pressured Volo to give up the manuscript of the new ''All Things Magical'' for publication on [[Earth]], despite his fears of being turned into a toad, insisting they would clear it with Elminster later. Left alone, poor Volo contemplated life as a toad.{{Cite comic/Forgotten Realms: The Grand Tour}}\n\n===Volo's Guide to Identity Theft===\nIronically, the next great scandal in Volo's life was one he was entirely innocent of, apparently. In the {{yearlinkName|1367}}, a Waterdhavian thief named [[Marcus Wands]], a.k.a. Marco Volo (a pseudonym he adopted to sound more appealing to women), stole from the mad wizard [[Sabbas]] a powerful [[artifact]] called the ''[[Dragonking's Eye]]'' and framed Volo for the crime, by simply sending to Sabbas an anonymous note blaming Volothamp Geddarm. After the ''All Things Magical'' affair, it seemed plausible and the wizard fell for it completely, but the plan backfired—Sabbas decided local thief Marco Volo ''was'' the real Volothamp Geddarm in disguise! He announced a 10,000 [[gold piece]] (layer 20,000) reward for Volo's capture or death, and hired mage-assassin [[Felibarr Blacklance]] to hunt him down, setting him on the trail of Volothamp, that is, \"Marco Volo\", that is, Marcus Wands.\n\nAt first, Volo remained entirely unwitting of all this. With several bounties on his head, this was just one more. But after escaping assassination attempts, he couldn't help but take notice. When he realized the description did not fit him and he was not the real target, this time, he began to look into it, With his own well-honed investigative skills, he realized who \"Marco Volo\" really was—Marcus Wands, of the [[Wands]] noble family of Waterdeep—and spoke with the family patriarch [[Maskar Wands]]. As much as Maskar disliked Volothamp and his work, he agreed to help for the sake of his nephew. Volo used his contacts to track down Marcus and the adventurers, mainly following the chaos in their wake. He also spoke to Elminster and learned of the ''Dragonking's Eye''.\n\nHe caught up with them in the [[Spiderhaunt Woods]] in [[Shadowdale]] and even help Marcus and the adventurers shut it down. He would even get a chance to ''try'' to interview the deities [[Tyr]], [[Sune]], and [[Corellon Larethian]] when they showed up to recapture the released [[Dragonking]].<ref group=\"note\">While Volo's continued participation in the final parts of ''Marco Volo: Arrival'' are optional, and indeed unlikely given his character, Volo's claim to have met gods in ''Volo's Guide to Monsters'', p. 164, implies he was present. Unless he had any other opportunities for meeting deities, of course.\n\n===Volo's Guide to Getting Lucky===\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, Volo was visiting the city of [[Elturel]] where he engaged in a table [[dice]] game with a severe-looking northern [[barbarian]]. Coincidentally, exactly at that time, the goddess of luck [[Tymora]] was affected by [[Iyachtu Xvim]]'s plot to steal the powers of both her and her sister [[Beshaba]]. The luck powers of the goddess began running rampant through Faerûn. Volo's game was affected and he rolled doubles eight times, driving his opponent into a blind rage, who angrily ordered him to continue. With tears of terror in his eyes, Volo couldn't help but keep rolling doubles but finally escaped the livid barbarian by flinging the dice cup into his face and running for his life through the streets of Elturel. He prayed to Tymora, wondering why she'd wasted so much good luck on him. By now, Volo and his guides were well known, enough for [[Joel]] to joke, on encountering a [[barghest]], \"I seem to have misplaced my Volo's guide to Gehenna.\"<ref> Volothamp Geddarm himself was a famous, much-talked-about figure all around Faerûn by [[1369 DR]].<ref>\n\nAfter this, Volo dared to return to writing about magic, with ''Volo's Guide to Rhyming Incantations'' published in [[1371 DR]].Given the curses and severe threats should he ever return to authoring books about magic, it is unclear why Volo should then publish these two. Their close dates, even if from unrelated sources, suggest a connection. It may be that their contents skirted the restrictions on him or they were thoroughly vetted and approved by the likes of Elminster. If so, the appearance of only ''Volo's Guide to Magic, Appendix III'', and not the rest of the book, suggests it did not escape the editor's axe unscathed.\n\n===Volo's Guide to Snakes & Shipwrecks===\n[[File:Volo Samarach.png|thumb|left|''Volo, during his misadventures in Samarach. He even seems to have lost his beret.'']]\nThe {{YearlinkName|1374}} was marked with a voyage for the now legendary (and infamous) Volothamp Geddarm. He boarded the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'', traveling from [[Crossroad Keep]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] to the hidden nation of [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. However, multiple strange occurrences took place during the voyage. At one point, Volo was sitting to dine on a bowl of ship's [[soup]] but became distracted by a pod of [[dolphin]]s. When he returned to his meal, the bowl was snatched by one of the ''Vigilant's'' crew members. The soup had apparently gone bad, and the [[poison]]ing killed the sailor instead, saving Volo's life.\n\nThe streak of bad luck culminated in a fierce storm that shipwrecked the ''Vigilant'' on the Samarach shore. Luckily, Volo survived, along with a handful of passengers. Soon after reaching land, the survivors were accosted by bands of local ravenous [[Batiri]] [[goblin]]s. Confident in his diplomacy and knowledge of the [[Goblin language]], Volo attempted a negotiation. Needless to say, a bloody battle followed, with the survivors emerging victorious.\n\nSubsequently, the survivors were escorted to the city of [[Samargol]] by a patrol Samarach's Elite Guards. Despite the city being closed to most foreigners, Volo's business partner, local merchant Sa'Sani, vouched for the writer and promptly hired other survivors as members of her business, allowing them entrance to the City of Veils. While in Samargol, Volo collected lore on the exotic jungle nation that later was collected and printed as ''Volo's Guide to the Serpent Kingdoms''. Along with adventurers, Volo became entangled in a clandestine plot of the [[yuan-ti]] [[House Se'Sehen]] to take over Faerûn through infiltration of merchant companies. When one of Sa'Sani's aides was exposed as a [[yuan-ti pureblood]], the group, along with Volo, was forced to flee Samarach through the hidden ''[[Lantan-Samarach portal]]'' back to the Sword Coast. As a gesture of a personal gratitude, Volo gifted the adventurers his ''rejuvenating ring''.\n\nAfterward, Volo joined Sa'Sani and the adventurers in Crossroad Keep, from where he continued work on his guides and conducted research into cult and bandit activities. Volo remained in Crossroad Keep until the snake cultists of [[Zehir]] were stopped, their plans of domination thwarted.\n\nDuring this time, Sa'Sani performed a blood ritual magic on Volo, ostensibly to mitigate the effects of intoxication and \"save him from himself\" but secretly also to magically bind the two of them together.\n\nLater, Volo diversified his interests further, publishing ''Volo's Guide to Good Rulership'' in [[1377 DR]].\n\n===Volo's Guide to Skipping Ahead===\nWhilst working on his guide to Cormyr ''circa'' 1367 DR, Volo had speculated so rampantly about the mysterious mages known as the [[Sword Heralds]] that Elminster declared \"We fix that, or this book gets renamed forthwith: ''Volo's Guide to the Effects of an Imprisonment Spell on the Victim, Written from Personal Experience.''\" For whatever reason, Elminster eventually made good on this threat and trapped Volo in an ''[[imprisonment]]'' spell, in a state of stasis, as punishment for whatever he'd done this time. He spent some time as a [[frog]], a stone ornament, or a stone ornament of a frog in Elminster's pond for some misdeed or another, for somewhere between 18 years and half a century. Elminster was controlling himself admirably, apparently, having chosen not to blast him outright.\n\nConveniently, Volo was still caught like this when the [[Spellplague]] struck in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}. With him being one of Mystra's Weave anchors, the magic fortunately did not go awry, injure him, or end prematurely. Unfortunately, he remained trapped in this state for decades, unageing and unaware of the world that moved far beyond what he'd written of in his guides.\n\nFollowing his release, he was later informed by Elminster about the events of the Spellplague and the transference of parts of [[Abeir]] and Toril, though Volo scarcely understood the explanations.\n\n===Volo's Guide to Being a Successful Author at Last===\nAfter his return, Volo was hired by his rival [[Randilus Qelver]] to explore the valley of [[Barovia]] for a commission of 99 [[Dragon (coin)|golden dragons]]. He escaped imprisonment in the [[demiplane]] by using a charm given to him by Elminster.{{Cite dragon+/6/Travel Talk: Volo's Visit to Barovia}}\n\nAt some point, he wrote the chapbook ''Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion'', a short visitor's guide to the City of Splendors intended to cover a gap in the market until a new and updated edition of ''Volo's Guide to Waterdeep'' could be released. It was again published by Tym Waterdeep Limited, with the aid of the [[Fellowship of Innkeepers]] and the [[Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen]], and had the approval of [[Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]]. At this time, Volo enjoyed the patronage of the [[Melshimber]] noble family and had procured the services of a solicitor, [[Abricade Fellswop]]. He charged 7 copper [[nib]]s for an autograph. ''Volo's Guide to Waterdeep'' was eventually reprinted, and Volo was selling them, and loaning them, to visitors on the streets of Waterdeep as of around [[1486 DR]].<ref>\n\nSometime in the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Volo journeyed to [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]] in order to promote his new book, ''Volo's Guide to Monsters''. He arranged audiences with the seven merchant princes of the city to deliver autographed hardcover copies to them, and of course visited inns and taverns to share stories and sell books for 50 [[gp]] each.\n\n[[File:Volobar.png|thumb|250px|''Volo welcoming adventurers at the Yawning Portal.'']]\nFollowing his successful promotional tour, he returned to Waterdeep to take a break and to start working on his next book, ''Volo's Guide to Spirits and Specters'', while he waited for royalty payments for his previous book, ''Volo's Guide to Monsters'', which left him short on coin. However, he struggled on ''Spirits and Specters'', not least because his knowledge of the ghostly variety of spirit was far surpassed by his knowledge of the alcoholic. While pondering it, he passed many of his free hours in the taproom of the [[Yawning Portal]] and catching up with friends and old friends.\n\nSoon after his return, in the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{WDH-time}} an acquaintance of his named [[Floon Blagmaar]] went missing, possibly kidnapped, following a night of carousing with Volo at the [[Skewered Dragon]] tavern. To find him, Volo would hire adventurers at the [[Yawning Portal]], choosing a group that just survived a tavern brawl. They rescued both Floon and [[Renaer Neverember]] and, in lieu of the promised payment he could not actually provide, Volo offered the deed to Trollskull Manor. Reputed to be haunted, Volo had purchased the property for research material. Much later, Volo may have come cap in hand to the successful adventurers to ask for funding for his next expedition.<ref>\n\nSubsequently, while relaxing at the Yawning Portal, Volo would buy drinks for other adventurers who planned to venture into [[Undermountain]] and related tales of the great dungeon. These included the legend of the lost throne of [[Coronal]] [[Syglaeth Audark]], last ruler of [[Illefarn]]; if rediscovered, he would tell elven friends about it.<ref>{{ Cite book/Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage|8,51}} He could also introduce adventurers to Captain [[Jalester Silvermane]] of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]].<ref>{{ Cite book/Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage|9}}\n\nSometime in the 1490s DR, still in Waterdeep, Volo frequented the [[Halfway Inn (Waterdeep)|Halfway Inn]]. There, he encountered a [[halfling]] [[rogue]] recruited by Open Lord Laeral Silverhand herself into the rescue mission for her pet baby [[griffin]] kidnapped by the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]. Volo aided the little thief by pointing him towards [[Skullport]] where the guild operated from and gave some advice on how to safely get there. Sometime before that, he has authored a book about adventuring and dungeon delving, ''[[Dungeonology (in-universe)|Dungeonology]]''.\n\n[[File:Volo.png|thumb|right|''Volo while a \"guest\" of the goblins.'']]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Volo traveled to the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in order to study the unique behavior of a certain group of goblins. He was subsequently captured by these goblins, who were members of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], and taken to their headquarters at a nearby [[temple of Selûne (Western Heartlands)|temple of Selûne]], which at least gave him a closer look at his subjects. He even worked on his new book, ''[[On Goblins: My Life Among the Conquering Host]]'', with his hastily scribbled notes seized by Booyagh [[Piddle]], who wondered what Volo's description of them as \"obstreperous\" and \"malodorous\" meant. Volo's fate is as yet unconfirmed; he may have been rescued by adventurers, or else left in the goblins' clutches.\n\nIn the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} a portrait of Volothamp Geddarm was instrumental in an attempted robbery of the [[Castle Never]] vaults in [[Neverwinter]] by thieves [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Holga Kilgor]], [[Simon]], and [[Doric]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}\n\nSix months after the end of the [[Absolute crisis]] in Baldur's Gate, Volo actively sought contributors for the newest edition of ''[[Volo's Guide to Baldur's Gate]]''.\n\n===Volo's Undated Misadventures===\nVolo had at different points apprenticed under various mages, including Elminster.\n\nIn one instance, he used his ''Volo's snatch'' spell to hurriedly dress himself, albeit in lingerie, while escaping a paramour's husband through a shop.\n\nIn another, Volo had a run-in with some smugglers hailing from [[Sembia]] and [[Westgate]] engaged in underhanded dealings in an upper-room club in [[Suzail]], Cormyr. In his frantic escape, he happened, quite by accident, to save the life of one Nanthé Ryddorn, undercover War Wizard.\n\nOne particularly terrible tavern brawl saw a [[mind flayer]] strangle Volo with three tentacles and burrow a fourth into his brain. Fortunately, Volo was not especially hampered by this, for the mind flayer didn't suck out his brain but rather implanted an [[enchanted]] gem known as a ''[[stone of thoughts]]''. This transmitted random thoughts from Volo to the mind flayer, [[Ixruu Thalarkul]], who used it for information gathering purposes.",
        "Personality": "What is known of Volo comes via [[Elminster]], who edited, annotated, provided prefaces for, and indeed criticized Volo's guides. and \"irrepressible, nay, pompous and pretentious\". Elminster claimed he was disgusted by Volo's \"base flattery\" and said he was given to \"exaggeration, misrepresentation, and flights of fancy.\" Volo certainly had a reputation for embellishing the truth and for bragging and he had an overly high opinion of himself and his place in the world. He also tended to be ambitious, or more precisely, greedy.\n\nVolo was also known to have an acid tongue and to be quite verbose,<ref> even bombastic, but overly honest and mocking. Elminster remarked he'd \"never met anyone who can hang himself with his own tongue as effectively as old Volo.\" Yet he nevertheless had some charms.\n\nDespite his flaws, however, Volo was soft at heart and he cared for his friends most of all, at least those friends he had. He would do anything he could to aid them.\n\nVolo himself claimed to have restless feet and a love of travel, of seeing new things and living life to the full, though his may just have been an excuse for his forced journeys. He considered anything outside the towns and cities to be boring and hazardous. He much preferred the setting of a pleasant tavern or [[festhall]] to trekking through a jungle, ruins, or dungeon, and he tended to indulge himself.\n{{quote|Set your course by the truth and you shall never be lost, no matter how far you wander.|An old adage created by Volo, from title page of ''Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion''}}",
        "Description": "[[File:Volo FRCS 2e.jpg|thumb|right|''Have you seen this wizard?'']]\nVolo was considered handsome He had a moustache",
        "Skills & Abilities": "As of the early 1360s DR, Volo was a wizard of only modest ability. He was knowledgeable in rare and unusual [[spell]]s, but only of low to moderate power, which were the only ones he could cast. Nevertheless, he was thought to have invented several noteworthy minor spells focused on finding and documenting information and for sundry other purposes. For example, ''Volo's snatch'' let him steal small tools and weapons, keys, or, more usually, tasty [[tart]]s. Common spells he prepared in the mid-1360s DR included ''[[blur]]'', ''[[cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'', ''[[change self]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[fool's gold]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'' and ''[[invisibility, 10' radius]]'', ''[[Nystul's magic aura]]'', ''[[phantasmal force]]'' and ''[[improved phantasmal force]]'', ''[[spectral force]]'', and ''[[wraithform]]''. Beginning again as a wizard in the late 1480s DR and early 1490s DR, he prepared only ''[[comprehend languages]]'',''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[disguise self]]'', ''[[friends]]'', ''[[mending]]'', and ''[[prestidigitation]]''.\n\nAs a sage, he was primarily interested in the spells and activities of [[human]] wizards. His secondary area of expertise was the geography and lore of the Realms, specifically the lands known to be inhabited by humans, as well as ancient history. After the ''All Things Magical'' affair, this study took up more and more of his time and effort. He knew a little something about everything, and was only too happy to share with anyone who would hear it. He claimed to be an expert in all the Realms.\n\nOtherwise, he was skilled in artistry, namely his writing, as well as dancing and singing; in brewing and cooking; in etiquette and heraldry; and in [[horse]]-riding and tailoring.\n\nLess professionally, Volo could drink incredible quantities of alcohol without getting drunk. Instead, he would pretend to be inebriated so as to hide the ability and let rivals and foes underestimate him or act overconfident. This was thanks to a ritual of blood magic performed by Sa'Sani ''circa'' 1374 DR.\n\n{{fq\n| text = N-no! Not replacing, good heavens no, just assisting! How could I turn down such an editor as Elminster? It would be an affront to Mystra—er—to all my fans!\n| source = Volothamp Geddarm\n}}\nUnbeknownst to Volo, he was in fact a [[Weave anchor]], being imbued by [[Mystra]] with her divine fire as a way to prevent the [[Weave]] from collapsing should anything happen to the goddess of magic, again. She chose him because no one would ever suspect him. For security, this was a secret known only to Mystra and Elminster, and kept secret from Volo himself, lest he boast and blab about it. This had no effect on his person, thoughts, habits, or any other aspect of his life.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-02-23 - Volo's weave anchor & stasis}}<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-08-15 - Creation of the Weave anchors}}<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-06-19 - Origin of the Weave anchors}} The only upshot of this to Volo was that the power, the goddess, or Elminster kept him alive on more than a few occasions in which by all rights he ought to have died, as much as Elminster might want to disintegrate him himself sometimes.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Friendships": "Volothamp Geddarm and Elminster Aumar became friends, eventually.",
            "Romances": "From a [[tenday]]-long affair with [[Ravithara Silmerhelve]], of the [[Silmerhelve]] noble family of [[Waterdeep]], Volo had one son, [[Emmeros Silmerhelve]]. Volo and Ravithara were unmarried and Emmeros was still an infant in 1372 DR.{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep}}{{Cite dragon/250/Wyrms of the North: Nymmurh|80,81,84}} During the dalliance, Volo learned of the Silmerhelves' secret guardian, the [[bronze dragon]] [[Nymmurh]], and his magic. Elminster would remark \"If Lord [[Laerlos Silmerhelve]] ever reads this, there won't be a fortress strong enough or distant enough in all Toril to save the skin of Volothamp Geddarm from the vengeance of the Silmerhelves.

While he wrote much flowery fluff about her in his notes, it's unclear if this was mere flirting or progressed to something more. Volo knew she was a shapechanger, but not that she was Jalanvaloss herself.{{Cite dragon/243/Wyrms of the North: Jalanvaloss|57-58}}\n\nVolo became infatuated with the cold and beautiful merchant wizard [[Sa'Sani]] during the mid-1370s DR when he was involved with the merchant company operating out of Crossroad Keep near [[Neverwinter]]. Although she did not encourage him in any way and remained cool and haughty, Sa'Sani was aware of his attraction and shared her dry wit with him occasionally. Her blood magic ritual also bound them together, putting a tiny piece of her inside him so that, if she died, she would slowly drain life from Volo and regenerate her own body and return to life. An unexpected side-effect was that she regularly received his thoughts, albeit in a jumbled, broken order. It helped her keep track of Volo and his activities. An even more unexpected side-effect was that Sa'Sani became infatuated with Volo too.\n\nAfter he inadvertently rescued one [[Nanthé Ryddorn]], a War Wizard, while she was undercover among smugglers in a Suzailan club, the two became friends and occasional lovers. Nanthé liked Volo and was attracted to his scent, apparently, even though she called him a \"loathsome worm\". He visited her whenever he was in Suzail and focused on Suzailan real estate to make excuses to go there. (Sa'Sani thought Nanthé was useful, and was not jealous.)",
            "Professional": "His books were published by [[Tym Waterdeep Limited]], a publishing company run by [[Justin Tym]]. Volo's work did much to build Tym's business, while Volo lived well off the advances he received and the free lunches. Initially, Tym edited Volo's books himself, before the business grew and the work was delegated to dedicated editors.\n\nVolo was an honorary member of the [[Brotherhood of the Cloak]] of [[Mulmaster]]. The membership was granted to him by the Senior Cloak [[Thurndan Tallwand]] personally, in exchange for Volo's silence on his sources used in writing the infamous and legendarily suppressed work, ''Volo's Guide to All Things Magical''.\n\nHe had also established an extensive network of contacts who actually would help him too.\n\nAlthough a notorious rogue in his own right, Volo's reputation and the rumors about him meant he was often blamed and scapegoated for many more scandals than he'd actually had a hand in."

At the very least, he was usually asked to leave shortly after publishing something. Always moving on only advanced his knowledge of the Realms further, however.\n\nVolo also engaged in countless other money-making ventures. These included the buying and selling of urban real estate in cities along the [[Sword Coast]], owning properties such as [[Trollskull Manor]] , a former tavern and residence in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].\n\nHowever, his most profitable venture throughout his life was in fact writing, printing, and selling erotic romance [[chapbook]]s, under the penname '''Valhalaeria the Vaunted''' (whom he would not admit to being one and the same as).

He was named for the city of [[Volothamp]] in [[Calimshan]], apparently because he had been conceived there, and he spent some of his early childhood there. From such an inauspicious start, he would travel far and wide.\n\nIn his youth and obscurity, Volo once attended a [[Mage Fair]]. Here, he \"overheard\" something that, combined with what he learned from some [[Harpers]], allowed him to realize the secret of the [[Nurvureem|Dark Lady]] of [[Rundreth Manor]].{{Cite dragon/249/Wyrms of the North: Nurvureem|67}}\n\nAt some point in mid-1300s DR, Volo made a deal with Justin Tym, then just an entrepreneurial print shop owner and purveyor of pornography based in Waterdeep.

[[Snilloc]] was more specific, saying, with a smile, that Volo would spend \"most of eternity as a dung beetle crushed under a rock at the bottom of a cesspool\" and only afterward lose his head. Others threatened him with the old classic of turning him into a [[toad]], or merely drove him out of town.\n\nThankfully, Elminster Aumar, the Sage of Shadowdale, and [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] of Waterdeep rescued Volo from too terrible or permanent a fate, but still gave him up for their own entertainment to the [[Simbul]], the Witch-Queen of [[Aglarond]]. She was more amused by the commotion caused by the hapless writer, so she only transformed Volo into a [[bird]] and made him fly into a wall as a punishment. The Witch-Queen dispensed some other magical chastisement on the writer, including burning all his hair off, and worse—only as an example of what would happen if he tried such unauthorized reporting again, of course. Yet, in the end, she gifted him an [[The Simbul's Sly Smile|enchanted etched stone]] with a sly smile. The Simbul told Volo in a soft voice that his survival might depend on the stone's magic. She also warned him that were he ever foolish enough to anger every spellcaster on Toril again, no trinket would be enough to save his hide.\n\n[[File:Volo in Waterdeep.jpg|thumb|left|''A sighting of Volo in Waterdeep in the early 1360s DR.'']]\nVolo was also subjected to quite a number of [[curse]]s that would be triggered if he ever looked too deeply into ways of exposing the secrets of magic ever again. He would not speak of these, but vowed he would be \"a very good boy where dealings with wizards are concerned for a long time to come.\" Nevertheless, the whole affair left him forced to be always on the move to avoid his foes. He could also never again go to another Mage Fair, either.\n\nMeanwhile, the book was suppressed by all powerful wizards, Reputedly, every copy disappeared, without even a word of refund for production costs or lost revenue, and it nearly ended Tym Waterdeep Limited as a company.\n\nFinally, Elminster prevailed on Volo to see the error of his ways. Elminster later described the book as \"misguided' and said that Volo \"should leave dabbling in Art to those who know better.\" Nevertheless, the revealed spells remained known to the magical community, and even entered common use.",

But once again, he would not enjoy immediate success. The earliest known, ''Volo's Guide to the Moonsea'', written over [[1357]] and [[1358 DR]], was similarly suppressed, now by the Zhentarim. His next works, ''Volo's Guide to the Vast'', written from [[1358]] to [[1360 DR]], and ''Volo's Guide to the Bloodstone Lands'', written from [[1360 DR|1360]] to [[1362 DR]], also went unreleased. Meanwhile, ''Volo's Guide to Westgate and the Dragon Coast'' was written some time in the early 1360s DR on commission by a noble of [[Yhaunn]], [[Sembia]], so it remained in private ownership. Continuing a theme, ''Volo's Guide to Calimport'' was written over [[1364 DR|1364]] and [[1365 DR]] but all final drafts were destroyed by [[Calimshan|Calishite]] [[pasha]]s and [[Rundeen]] agents and only notes and an old draft remained.\n\nOne of his first travel guides to see publication was ''Volo's Guide to the Frozenfar'', published in 1364 DR. Nevertheless, it notably exposed the [[Hanging Lantern]] [[festhall]] as a front for a kidnapping operation by the [[Unseen]] when Volo casually mentioned that all the courtesans were in fact [[doppelganger]]s. Although a significant setback for the Unseen and putting Volo on the doppelgangers' hit list should he ever wander into Waterdeep again, it only increased interest in the establishment.<ref><ref>\n\nThis unwilling yet fruitful writing partnership continued with Volo's next few works, with ''Volo's Guide to the North'' written over 1365 to [[1366 DR]], ''Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast'' written over 1366 and [[1367 DR]], ''Volo's Guide to Cormyr'' written over 1367 to 1368 DR, ''Volo's Guide to the Dalelands'' written over 1368 to [[1369 DR]], and ''Volo's Guide to the Lands of Intrigue'', written over 1369 to [[1370 DR]]. These would all made it to publication.\n\nAt some point, Volo helped foil a conspiracy by the Unseen and their leader the doppelganger [[Hlaavin]] that apparently threatened all Faerûn. He thought that Khelben Arunsun would owe him one after that.<ref>",

Moreover, ''Once Around the Realms'' has its own significant dating discrepancy. In addition, \"Prologue\" implies the in-universe ''Volo's Guide to the Dalelands'' is forthcoming, but \"The Candlekeep Collection\" article says it was written over 1368–1369 DR. However, both characters in this framing story could be mistaken or lying, with Justin Tym being a doppelganger and Volo being Volo. Volo returned to Waterdeep, where he had a meeting with Justin Tym to discuss business and future plans. Justin pressed Volo for forthcoming works. Volo promised he was working on ''Volo's Guide to the Moonsea'' and would soon journey to [[Mulmaster]] for research.<ref group=\"note\">\"The Candlekeep Collection\" article compiled later has ''Volo's Guide to the Moonsea'' written 10 years earlier and suppressed. Perhaps Volo means to write a new version; if so, none is known to have seen print. Instead, he offered up his magnum opus once again: ''Volo's Guide to All Things Magical, the Revised, Authorized, & Expanded Edition''. This time, he claimed to use only secondhand sources: interviews, legends, and stories, all documented, verifiable, and publicly available, with no stolen secrets (not that he admitted to having used any the first time around)\n\nIn any case, after \"due passage of time\" (a decade), Elminster had now agreed that a new ''Volo's Guide to All Things Magical'' should be published, if only to prevent people searching in vain for the original version. From his own last-remaining copy, Elminster corrected, edited, and censored the work and released a new version in 1367 DR. Then he destroyed his own last copy of the original.\n\nLater, Volo visited the [[War Wizard (club)|War Wizard]] club in Cormyr, braving the price on his head in that kingdom at the time to handle some business before he departed again for the Dalelands. While there, Elminster arrived and introduced Volo to his would-be apprentice [[Presto]] to give him a potted geography lesson. After they left, [[Ed Greenwood]] and [[Julia Martin]] arrived and pressured Volo to give up the manuscript of the new ''All Things Magical'' for publication on [[Earth]], despite his fears of being turned into a toad, insisting they would clear it with Elminster later.

            "Volo's Guide to Identity Theft": "Ironically, the next great scandal in Volo's life was one he was entirely innocent of, apparently. In the {{yearlinkName|1367}}, a Waterdhavian thief named [[Marcus Wands]], a.k.a. Marco Volo (a pseudonym he adopted to sound more appealing to women), stole from the mad wizard [[Sabbas]] a powerful [[artifact]] called the ''[[Dragonking's Eye]]'' and framed Volo for the crime, by simply sending to Sabbas an anonymous note blaming Volothamp Geddarm. After the ''All Things Magical'' affair, it seemed plausible and the wizard fell for it completely, but the plan backfired—Sabbas decided local thief Marco Volo ''was'' the real Volothamp Geddarm in disguise! He announced a 10,000 [[gold piece]] (layer 20,000) reward for Volo's capture or death, and hired mage-assassin [[Felibarr Blacklance]] to hunt him down, setting him on the trail of Volothamp, that is, \"Marco Volo\", that is, Marcus Wands.\n\nAt first, Volo remained entirely unwitting of all this. With several bounties on his head, this was just one more. But after escaping assassination attempts, he couldn't help but take notice. When he realized the description did not fit him and he was not the real target, this time, he began to look into it, With his own well-honed investigative skills, he realized who \"Marco Volo\" really was—Marcus Wands, of the [[Wands]] noble family of Waterdeep—and spoke with the family patriarch [[Maskar Wands]]. As much as Maskar disliked Volothamp and his work, he agreed to help for the sake of his nephew. Volo used his contacts to track down Marcus and the adventurers, mainly following the chaos in their wake. He also spoke to Elminster and learned of the ''Dragonking's Eye''.\n\nHe caught up with them in the [[Spiderhaunt Woods]] in [[Shadowdale]] and even help Marcus and the adventurers shut it down. He would even get a chance to ''try'' to interview the deities [[Tyr]], [[Sune]], and [[Corellon Larethian]] when they showed up to recapture the released [[Dragonking]].<ref group=\"note\">While Volo's continued participation in the final parts of ''Marco Volo: Arrival'' are optional, and indeed unlikely given his character, Volo's claim to have met gods in ''Volo's Guide to Monsters'', p. 164, implies he was present.

            "Volo's Guide to Getting Lucky": "In the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, Volo was visiting the city of [[Elturel]] where he engaged in a table [[dice]] game with a severe-looking northern [[barbarian]]. Coincidentally, exactly at that time, the goddess of luck [[Tymora]] was affected by [[Iyachtu Xvim]]'s plot to steal the powers of both her and her sister [[Beshaba]]. The luck powers of the goddess began running rampant through Faerûn. Volo's game was affected and he rolled doubles eight times, driving his opponent into a blind rage, who angrily ordered him to continue. With tears of terror in his eyes, Volo couldn't help but keep rolling doubles but finally escaped the livid barbarian by flinging the dice cup into his face and running for his life through the streets of Elturel. He prayed to Tymora, wondering why she'd wasted so much good luck on him.

Their close dates, even if from unrelated sources, suggest a connection. It may be that their contents skirted the restrictions on him or they were thoroughly vetted and approved by the likes of Elminster.

He boarded the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'', traveling from [[Crossroad Keep]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] to the hidden nation of [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. However, multiple strange occurrences took place during the voyage. At one point, Volo was sitting to dine on a bowl of ship's [[soup]] but became distracted by a pod of [[dolphin]]s. When he returned to his meal, the bowl was snatched by one of the ''Vigilant's'' crew members. The soup had apparently gone bad, and the [[poison]]ing killed the sailor instead, saving Volo's life.\n\nThe streak of bad luck culminated in a fierce storm that shipwrecked the ''Vigilant'' on the Samarach shore. Luckily, Volo survived, along with a handful of passengers. Soon after reaching land, the survivors were accosted by bands of local ravenous [[Batiri]] [[goblin]]s. Confident in his diplomacy and knowledge of the [[Goblin language]], Volo attempted a negotiation. Needless to say, a bloody battle followed, with the survivors emerging victorious.\n\nSubsequently, the survivors were escorted to the city of [[Samargol]] by a patrol Samarach's Elite Guards. Despite the city being closed to most foreigners, Volo's business partner, local merchant Sa'Sani, vouched for the writer and promptly hired other survivors as members of her business, allowing them entrance to the City of Veils. While in Samargol, Volo collected lore on the exotic jungle nation that later was collected and printed as ''Volo's Guide to the Serpent Kingdoms''. Along with adventurers, Volo became entangled in a clandestine plot of the [[yuan-ti]] [[House Se'Sehen]] to take over Faerûn through infiltration of merchant companies. When one of Sa'Sani's aides was exposed as a [[yuan-ti pureblood]], the group, along with Volo, was forced to flee Samarach through the hidden ''[[Lantan-Samarach portal]]'' back to the Sword Coast. As a gesture of a personal gratitude, Volo gifted the adventurers his ''rejuvenating ring''.\n\nAfterward, Volo joined Sa'Sani and the adventurers in Crossroad Keep, from where he continued work on his guides and conducted research into cult and bandit activities. Volo remained in Crossroad Keep until the snake cultists of [[Zehir]] were stopped, their plans of domination thwarted.\n\nDuring this time, Sa'Sani performed a blood ritual magic on Volo, ostensibly to mitigate the effects of intoxication and \"save him from himself\" but secretly also to magically bind the two of them together.\n\nLater, Volo diversified his interests further, publishing ''Volo's Guide to Good Rulership'' in [[1377 DR]].",

It was again published by Tym Waterdeep Limited, with the aid of the [[Fellowship of Innkeepers]] and the [[Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen]], and had the approval of [[Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]].

However, he struggled on ''Spirits and Specters'', not least because his knowledge of the ghostly variety of spirit was far surpassed by his knowledge of the alcoholic. While pondering it, he passed many of his free hours in the taproom of the [[Yawning Portal]] and catching up with friends and old friends.\n\nSoon after his return, in the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{WDH-time}} an acquaintance of his named [[Floon Blagmaar]] went missing, possibly kidnapped, following a night of carousing with Volo at the [[Skewered Dragon]] tavern.

They rescued both Floon and [[Renaer Neverember]] and, in lieu of the promised payment he could not actually provide, Volo offered the deed to Trollskull Manor. Reputed to be haunted, Volo had purchased the property for research material. Much later, Volo may have come cap in hand to the successful adventurers to ask for funding for his next expedition.<ref>\n\nSubsequently, while relaxing at the Yawning Portal, Volo would buy drinks for other adventurers who planned to venture into [[Undermountain]] and related tales of the great dungeon.
