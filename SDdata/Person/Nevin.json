        "mainbody": "'''Nevin''' was a [[human]] man from the City of Coin, [[Athkatla]], the capital of [[Amn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Cheap sweater?! Well â€“ I'll have you know that belonged to yer grandfather, you ungrateful git!''|Uncle Lester}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Nevin's much-hated uncle [[Lester]] expired and was being buried in Athkatla's [[Grave District]]. Nevin thought his uncle to be an absolute bastard who, even in death, managed to wrong the man by leaving him nothing in the will but a sweater, and all the coin went to a [[Calishite]] woman Lester was courting. The ceremony was performed by a drunken [[cleric]] of [[Talos]], but something went wrong. Uncle Lester rose up as an [[undead]] creature, sending the ceremony's attendees fleeing in terror. The angry undead scolded his nephew for spending just a new [[copper]]s on the ceremony that was some slurred lines of profanity mumbled by an inebriated priest, all clothes from the dead body were sold off, and even the flowers were gathered from a nearby swamp. Nevin angrily stated that he had no money to spend and Lester should've been simply dumped into the city river. It was said that the undead became enraged and swiftly murdered his nephew and went off searching for his Calishite paramour for a \"one last quickie,\" while others claimed that an adventurer witnessed the strange exchange and defended the man from his reanimated family member."
