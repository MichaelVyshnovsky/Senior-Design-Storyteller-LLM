{{Quote|''"A good blade must be fed. Find prey or I find you."''|Montaron}}

==Personality==
Seeing himself as exceptionally skilled, Montaron preferred to work for the Black Network alone. He saw little value in the lives of others but believed himself destined for great things

He liked staying in cities more so than being out in nature, and would rather be out during all hours of the night.

==Relationships==
Montaron and Xzar absolutely could not stand one another. Though they both held a shared hatred for the [[Harpers]] organization.

Over time Xzar developed some fondness for Montaron. When the [[halfling]] went missing, he was quite dedicated to ensuring his return.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Montaron and Xzar were tasked with investigating the [[iron crisis]] that plagued trade throughout the [[Sword Coast]]. They traveled along the [[Coast Way]], en route to the [[Amn]]ian town of [[Nashkel]].

By the [[1369 DR|following year]], the pair were still traveling through Amn and set up in the city of [[Athkatla]]. Montaron was captured by [[Galvarey]]'s group of Harpers and seemingly imprisoned within [[Galvarey estate|his estate]] in the form of a bird.

In fact Montaron was killed, and his "transformation" was just a ruse to draw out and assassinate his partner Xzar.
