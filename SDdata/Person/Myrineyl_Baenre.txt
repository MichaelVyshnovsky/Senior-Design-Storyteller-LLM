'''Myrineyl Baenre''' was the First Priestess of [[House Baenre]] circa [[1484 DR]].

==Personality==
Myrineyl had been groomed from infancy to rule. However, she developed a sadistic side. She had a strange fascination with surface [[elf|elves]] and had always at her side a slave attendant of this race. These attendants, however, rarely survived long and always needed to be replaced.

==Powers==
Myrineyl was equally talented in divine and arcane magic.

==History==
Myrineyl was the firstborn of [[matron mother]] [[Quenthel Baenre]]. In [[1480 DR]], she was in her last year in [[Arach-Tinilith]].

In later years, she and Quenthel's sister [[Sos'Umptu Baenre]] competed for the title of First Priestess. The appointment of her aunt as matron mother of the restored [[House Do'Urden]] probably granted the First Priestess position to Myrineyl.
