Hoshtar Xorlarrin was a drow wizard of Menzoberranzan and cousin to House Wizard Ravel of House Xorlarrin. 
By the tradition of his house, Hoshtar wore a red veil over his face.
Hoshtar could be influenced by those who showed knowledge about arcane matters or fed his ego. He thumped his chest and clapped an employee on the shoulder when he was pleased.
Hoshtar was his familys representative for an alliance with House Melarn and Bregan Daerthe in handling a party of adventurers. This was a task in which he had spent much effort himself. It was written to Faelas Xorlarrin, a master of Sorcere, and its content was about how the Goddesss current plan supported the idea of wizards joining the Ruling Council.
After the adventurers returned from their first mission, Hoshtar was invited to meet with members of the Council of Spiders by his cousin, Raelaryn Xorlarrin. At the meeting, a Jaezred Chaulssin assassin killed Raelaryn and captured Hoshtar. The alliances hired team managed to rescue him. Regardless of the alliances decision on how to deal with the civil war, it was unanimous in sending the adventurers to eliminate the leader of the assassins.
