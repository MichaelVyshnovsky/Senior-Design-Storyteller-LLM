        "mainbody": "ikkers was the person accused of murder by the Griffons Mercenary Company of Matagar Bugo in Daggerford in 1372 DR.\nCaptain Frederick of Daggerfords Guard knew Wikkers. He did not believe the man to be dangerous nor mad, only unethical and unruly.\nIn 1372 DR, the city of Daggerford faced a change of leadership following Duke Pwyll Daggerfords apparent death. A corrupt merchant and a Zhentil Keep ally, Baron Matagar Bugo quickly rose to power and took the throne of the city. Wikkers, a small-time crook, came into possession of a book that contained the truth about Bugos allegiances. He hid the book but quickly was thrown into Castle Daggerfords dungeons, accused of murder and insanity. Somehow Wikkers was able to escape and hid somewhere in the city as Commander Dratharion and his Griffons put Daggerford into a lockdown, searching for the \"mad criminal.\" The mercenaries spread the word that Wikkers lunatic ramblings about Bugo were not to be believed. Eventually, Wikkers was tracked down by the Griffons and executed on the streets of the city. The book was taken from his corpse. His murder was witnessed by the Hero of Daggerford, adding to the many plot threads into the investigation of Dukes death."
