Owenn Tarsenel was the innkeeper of the Luskan Arms inn in Targos in Icewind Dale in the late 15 century DR.
He was quiet and balding.
Owing to the inns theme, Owenn had scraps of knowledge about Luskan, but it had all been passed down from his father or learned from guests at the inn whod been through Luskan.
During Aurils unending winter in 1488 DR and 1489 DR, Owenn was afraid that summer was gone forever from Icewind Dale, and so became deeply depressed.
