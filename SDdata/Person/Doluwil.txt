'''Doluwil''' was a sailor aboard the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

==Description==
Before his death, Doluwil was still a young [[half-elven]] man. The sailing life bewildered and frustrated Doluwil and the poisoning of one of the crew members left him in fear of eating anything else from the ship's supplies.

==History==
Doluwil was one of the most recent members of the ''Vigilant's'' crew by the {{Yearlink|1374}} when Captain [[Lastri Kassireh]]'s ship sailed from the [[Sword Coast]] to the nation of [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. Onboard the ship were several passengers, including [[Volothamp Geddarm]] who traveled to meet with a wealthy [[yuan-ti]] merchant, [[Sa'Sani]]. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled; freshwater [[barrel]]s ruptured; one of the crew, a sailor got drunk and drowned; Volo almost got poisoned as his poison soup took the life of [[Joquin]]; and new [[rope]]s became frayed.

Doluwil's life ended when the string of strange occurrences culminated in a deadly storm. The ''Vigilant's'' shipwreck was washed ashore not far from the city of [[Samargol]]. Most sailors perished in the storm, while others were captured to be eaten by the [[Batiri]].
