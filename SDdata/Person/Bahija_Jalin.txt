'''Bahija Jalin''' was a potion vendor who lived in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|57}}

==Description==
Due to skillful application of make-up, Bahija appeared to be in her 90's. In fact, she was only 27 years old.

==Activities==
Most of Bahija's potions were non-magical but highly alcoholic. She sold these to unsuspecting fools or foreigners visiting Huzuz. Bahija was able to craft a potion of ''[[ventriloquism]]'', but she rarely had these for sale in her shop.

Customers could arrange for Bahija to cast the ''[[evil eye]]'' on someone if the price was right. She could also remove the curse of the ''evil eye'' from those who were afflicted.
