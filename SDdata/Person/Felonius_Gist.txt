'''Felonius Gist''' was a wealthy nobleman of the [[Gist]] [[patriar family]] who lived in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
In addition to the usual bluster that was exhibited by many noble-born, Felonious displayed distinct cowardice when presented even the slightest hint of physical harm.

==Activities==
Felonious earned his wealth at least in part from his transactions as an art dealer. He lived in a posh estate somewhere in the central area of the Gate's [[Upper City]].

==History==
At some point in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, he purchased some distinct pieces that were added to his private collection: six life-size [[humanoid]] statues that closely resembled living individuals. The "statues" were in fact six [[adventurer]]s led by the [[elf]] named [[Vail]], all of whom had been turned to stone by the gaze of a [[basilisk]].
