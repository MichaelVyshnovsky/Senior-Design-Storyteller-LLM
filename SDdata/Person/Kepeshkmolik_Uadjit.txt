'''Kepeshkmolik Uadjit''' was a [[dragonborn]] member of [[Clan Kepeshkmolik]] who served as the ambassador of [[Tymanther]]. She was a direct descendant of [[Shasphur]]. 

==Description==
Uadjit had dark eyes and sleek, gray-green scales.

==Personality==
Uadjit was considered to have a silver tongue and a charismatic personality.

==Relationships==
Uadjit was the daughter of [[Kepeshkmolik Narghon]], the wife of [[Verthisathurgiesh Arjhani]] and the mother of [[Dumuzi]].

==History==
Around [[1450 DR]], Uadjit was chosen to be [[Mehen]]'s wife, but he spurned her because he had a relationship with his clanmate, Arjhani. When Mehen was exiled, Arjhani was chosen by Clan Verthisathurgiesh as the new husband for Uadjit.

In [[1486 DR]], Uadjit was the scion of Clan Kepeshkmolik and the ambassador of Tymanther in [[High Imaskar]]. However, she returned to Tymanther when [[Mulhorand]] declared their war against the [[Imaskari]].

Uadjit was Clan Kepeshkmolik's candidate for the elections to chose the new [[Vanquisher]], that were expected to be celebrated in [[1487 DR]]. She was the candidate with the strongest claim to the title. This changed, however, when Dumuzi became the [[Chosen]] of [[Enlil]], as Uadjit lost a lot of popularity among the elders of the clans.

In the wake of the [[Second Sundering]], Uadjit helped Mehen and [[Kallan]] with the efforts to rescue the survivors of the exchanging of lands between [[Toril]] and [[Abeir]]. She was also one of the dragonborn who supported the decision to allow Namshita's refugees to live in Tymanther, in gratitude for Namshita's help against the [[Unther]]ans.

During the [[first Tymanther-Unther War]], Uadjit was in charge of the defense of the gates of [[Djerad Thymar]].
