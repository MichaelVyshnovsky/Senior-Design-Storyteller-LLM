Zarebor, who was nicknamed  the Piercer, was an apprentice inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Zarebor was apprenticed to Derf and worked in Derfs Skin Art. He specialized in a new form of body artistry that involved carefully scarring and piercing various body parts. He had aspirations to be the frontrunner with this bizarre form of expression.
