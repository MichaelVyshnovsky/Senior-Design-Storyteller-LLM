'''Zarebor''', who was nicknamed ''' the Piercer''', was an apprentice inhabiting the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Zarebor was apprenticed to [[Derf]] and worked in [[Derf's Skin Art]]. He specialized in a new form of body artistry that involved carefully scarring and piercing various body parts. He had aspirations to be the frontrunner with this bizarre form of expression.
