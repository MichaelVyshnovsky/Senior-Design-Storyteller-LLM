        "mainbody": "'''Selger''' was the [[Northlander|Northman]] king of [[Trisk]] in [[Purple Rocks]] in [[1370 DR]] but also an agent of the [[Kraken Society]].",
        "Relationships": "The Krakenar had control over Selger and Trisk for many decades. At first Selger was only a thrall of [[Vestress]] but thanks to the backing of the [[High Captains of Luskan|High Captain]] [[Rethnor]], the king gained freedom and influence.",
        "History": "Selger's true promotion arrived in [[1368 DR]] when his troops conquered the vassal isle of [[Utheraal]], which greatly pleased [[Slarkrethel]]. Later, he placed Krakenar agents in influential positions on [[Tuern]], [[Gundarlun]], the [[Ice Peak|Icepeak]], the [[Whalebones]], and in the [[Korinn Archipelago]]. Under orders of the [[kraken]], King Selger continued to report to Vestress, although the two hated each other."
