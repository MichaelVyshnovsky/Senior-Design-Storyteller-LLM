'''Gathan''' was a male [[lizardfolk]] [[ranger]] and the chieftain of the [[Sharptooth]] tribe in the [[Vast Swamp]] of [[Cormyr]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].  

==History==
In early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Gathan appeared to be killed during fighting with the attacking [[Shadowscale]] tribe, but was captured alongside others.<ref group="note">''[[Cormyr: The Tearing of the Weave]]'' page 40 says "They captured the old chieftain", but later says "the death of the previous chieftain at the hands of the Shadowscales", and he is later found alive as a prisoner. It is not clear whether he was thought dead or not. He was held prisoner in the tower of the [[Lost Refuge]] in the Vast Swamp, along with [[Ashala]], [[Gruss]], [[Kurash]], and [[Sithen]]. The ordeal left them weary and emaciated. They were presumably rescued by adventurers in service to [[Mystra]] investigating [[church of Shar|Sharran]] activities there.

Afterward, Gathan was displeased to learn that he was believed dead and had been replaced as chieftain by the priest [[Kessessek]]. Desiring an honorable death, Gathan tried to die fighting alongside the adventurers against his Sharran captors as they continued their quest; he would even challenge them if they tried to stop him.

==Abilities==
Gathan was a practiced ranger, specializing in the hunting of [[magical beast]]s.
