        "History": "During the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]], Buchembrallor declared war on all ships of [[Wealdath]] and with the help of [[Linussaxannol]] he destroyed a large portion of the coast. Later, the local sailors put a bounty on his head.",
        "Personality": "Buchembrallor was overconfident, believing all creatures of his size or smaller were surely inferior to him and always started a battle with them. Thank to this system, he had acquired a hoard larger than most dragons his age had.",
