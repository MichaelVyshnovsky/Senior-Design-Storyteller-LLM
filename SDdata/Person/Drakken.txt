Commander Drakken was a dracolich traditionalist member of the Cult of the Dragon during its mission to the Dragonbone Vale of the Sword Mountains in the late 15 century DR.
Drakken joined the Cult of the Dragon as a mere rank-and-file soldier, but he quickly became indoctrinated into the cults traditionalist fate of the dracolich supremacy. He quickly rose to the rank of a Commander thanks to his fanatism and ruthlessness. Commander Drakken led his regiment in the late 15 century DR to the Dragonbone Vale, where the cult sought to use a Netherese mythallar to bring the prophecy of the Chronicle of Years to Come to life. Drakken and his troops patrolled the Dragonbone Vale as Sammasters apprentices and their Red Wizard allies worked their foul magics.
Subsequently, the creation of the plot was thwarted by adventurers from Neverwinter, Elminster, and the alliance of the Sword Coast factions. Commander Drakken himself was defeated and possibly killed in the process.
