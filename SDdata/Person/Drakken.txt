'''Commander Drakken''' was a [[dracolich]] traditionalist member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] during its mission to the [[Dragonbone Vale]] of the [[Sword Mountains]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Drakken joined the Cult of the Dragon as a mere rank-and-file soldier, but he quickly became indoctrinated into the cult's traditionalist fate of the dracolich supremacy. He quickly rose to the rank of a Commander thanks to his fanatism and ruthlessness. Commander Drakken led his regiment in the late 15{{th}} century DR to the Dragonbone Vale, where the cult sought to use a [[Netherese]] ''[[mythallar]]'' to bring the prophecy of the ''[[Chronicle of Years to Come]]'' to life. Drakken and his troops patrolled the Dragonbone Vale as [[Sammaster]]'s apprentices and their [[Red Wizard]] allies worked their foul magics.

Subsequently, the creation of the plot was thwarted by [[adventurer]]s from [[Neverwinter]], [[Elminster]], and the alliance of the [[Sword Coast]] factions. Commander Drakken himself was defeated and possibly killed in the process.
