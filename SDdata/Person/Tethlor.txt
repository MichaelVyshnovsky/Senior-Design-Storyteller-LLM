'''Tethlor''' was a [[War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
According to [[Storm Silverhand]]'s available intelligence, Tethlor was competent, wary, and very loyal.

==Abilities==
Tethlor carried some detecting spells, though they proved ineffective at [[Tethgard]].

==Relationships==
While raiding Elminster's refuge at Tethgard, Tethlor was in formation with [[Rorsorn]], [[Kelgantor]] and [[Rorskryn Mreldrake]].

==History==
In early [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, [[Elminster Aumar]] was tracked to Tethgard in the [[Hullack Forest]] by the [[War Wizards]]; a large squad was dispatched to retrieve the ''[[Royal Gorget of Battle]]'' he had stolen. Tethlor was one of the War Wizards in the squad. He repeated a warning from [[Ganrahast]] to Kelgantor just prior to their clash with Elminster.

After the ensuing battle, Tethlor was badly injured in his wits, but counted among the survivors by the other War Wizards.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|55|5}}
