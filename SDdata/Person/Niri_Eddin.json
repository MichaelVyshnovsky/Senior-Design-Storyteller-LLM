        "History": "Niri was born in the {{YearlinkName|832}}, and subsequently became a necromancer of some renown. As many [[wizard]]s in his school of magic, Niri Eddin gained numerous secret enemies and he planned to deal with them in a gruesome manner. The necromancer started creating ''amulets of dark flesh'', small pieces innocent-looking jewelry that paralyzed its wearer and doomed them to slow death from horrible diseases. Niri gave out the ''accursed'' amulets to those he secretly despised and once his enemies expired, he collected the amulets from the deceased's servants.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Niri Eddin was believed to be at large, still \"alive\" but with his whereabouts unknown to most."
