        "History": "Phiirornaera was petrified by [[Kurtal]] at some point before {{yearlink|886}} and put in an embarassing position by his bath to serve as a towel-holder; even in stone form, she somehow co-opted the web of spells he used to query the heads of his rivals for knowledge and advice. She influenced him so into ever bolder actions.\n\nAbout a century after his death, by {{yearlink|1000}}, a rockslide covered the cavern home of Kurtal; still petrified, Phiirornaera remained in there until at least the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
