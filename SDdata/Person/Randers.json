        "mainbody": "Randers was a mighty human paladin.\nRanders was a tan, brown-haired man with narrow features and a prominent forehead. He wore a blue shirt underneath a suit of purple armor, and his head was covered by a purple, spiked helmet.\nUnwavering in his faith and unyielding in combat, Randers was a paragon of holy warriors.\nRanders was adorned in full plate, gauntlets, and wore a medallion of ESP around his neck. He wielded a holy avenger in battle, astride his mount, a black horse in full barding.\nThe holy avenger was awarded to Randers after he drove a horde of fiends from a temple outpost."
