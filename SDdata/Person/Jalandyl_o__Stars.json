        "Description": "While scarred somewhat by her travels and adventures, she was easily the most attractive of the Lion's ladies.",
        "Abilities": "Jalandyl also possessed an incredible knowledge of the mountain areas surrounding [[Archendale]], often selling maps of the region to explorers.",
        "Relationships": "Often coming to the aid of those who were harmed within the city, Jalandyl's permanence and anonymity were ensured by the twenty-thousand-[[gp|gold-piece]] debt the owner of the Drunken Lion, [[Meerkun Habalar]], owed her. While they neither trusted nor enjoyed each other's presence, their partnership lasted over twenty years. Jalandyl and [[Jalia Mossgreen]] of the [[Old Stonebows]] Inn knew each other well, including keeping secret each other's hidden lives, while both spied for and helped one another.",
