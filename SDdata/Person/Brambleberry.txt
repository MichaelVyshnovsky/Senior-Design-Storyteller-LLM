Lord '''Brambleberry''' was a noble of [[Waterdeep]].

He held a great hatred for [[Luskan]]'s pirate activity. In [[1376 DR]], he agreed with Captain [[Deudermont]] of the ''[[Sea Sprite]]'' to reform Luskan by eliminating the [[High Captains of Luskan]] and the [[Arcane Brotherhood]]. Lord Brambleberry gathered his family's troops and together with Deudermont invaded Luskan. They were victorious in the fighting against the Brotherhood's forces (the High Captains having retreated to see who was the victor of the battle). In the main attack against the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]], the [[Archmage Arcane]] escalated the battle to extremes and forced Deudermont and Brambleberry to destroy the Host Tower. However, the destruction of the tower caused many dead, among them Lord Brambleberry.
