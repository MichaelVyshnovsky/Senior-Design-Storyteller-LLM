        "Description": "Elminster's most notable feature was his hawk-like nose, which distinguished him since his youth, throughout the [[Elminster#Magical Studies & Return Home|years he spent as a woman]], and well into manhood. He had a shock of stark black hair in his youth, and maintained a beard through most of his years that eventually went gray in his old age.{{Cite dragon/110/All about Elminster|30-36}} El had vibrant blue eyes set under big, bushy eyebrows that turned blue-gray later in life. \n\nIn his later years, the elderly Elminster began to show his age, with his gruff voice and weathered features, but remained alert. He preferred to wear plain clothes, like simple black or gray [[robes]]. \n\nWhile Elminster was capable of taking on almost any appearance imaginable, he often preferred to travel in a less conspicuous manner, often utilizing ''[[invisibility]]'' and ''[[shapechange]]'' spells.",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|Archlich, I mock everyone. Myself, most of all. It's how I guard my heart against the flailing lashings of life.|Elminster to [[Larloch]], [[1487 DR]].}}\nDepending on the circumstances, Elminster could be as equally serious, fearsome, or arrogant, while just as often demonstrating exceptional charm, cleverness, and good-natured humor. El was a natural raconteur and actor, and could take on the role of father figure, a wily trickster, an immoral rake, or any other clichéd role that served his needs at the time, or else on a whim to elicit a reaction from others. Most often Elminster chose to only reveal the full range of his character to his close friends and companions.\n\nElminster extolled the virtues of tolerance, peace, and freedom from oppression. He truly cherished the wonder and beauty of the natural world. While El grew up hating magic, especially those that wielded it for their own selfish ends, he garnered a profound appreciation for [[the Power]] and [[the Art]] during his studies. According to El, mages should further their studies to best understand how to ''avoid'' using the arcane power they had their disposal.\n\nOne of El's personality quirks was that he snored loudly while sleeping. He was considerate enough to magically mute himself during sleep if it would disturb his friends.

            "Skills": "According to [[Lyra Sunrose]], Elminster's singing voice was entirely tone-deaf, despite its rather \"nice, smoky baritone\" quality. El was also known to be a poor musician, incapable of writing down music himself, unskilled in [[arithmetic]], He was, however, apparently quite skilled with a needle and thread.\n\nElminster's areas of expertise as a sage included a robust understanding of magic, familiarity with a wide range monsters, a deep knowledge of history, and comprehensive familiarity with familial genealogy.",
            "Magic & Psionics": "Elminster was rumored to have learned much of his understanding of [[arcane magic]] from [[Arkhon|Arkhon the Old]], a mage who died in [[Waterdeep]] some five centuries before the [[Era of Upheaval]]. By that time in history, El had gained knowledge of every [[spell]] that was commonly available to most adventuring spellcasters in the Realms. He did not use every spell he knew, however, preferring to avoid those from the [[conjuration]] [[school of magic]], or any associated with creatures from the [[lower planes]]. \n\nEl was considered one of the \"modern masters\" of ''[[counterspell]]ing'' He also held mastery over magic that shaped the elements of the natural world. and ''[[The Srinshee's spellshift]]''.

        },
        "Possessions": "Elminster was seldom one to travel without his staff, large pointed hat, or one of the numerous pipes in his collection. He had several notable pipes, including one made of [[meerschaum]] that usually puffed vile blue or green smoke, that could float independently and allowed others to take on his appearance.\n\nThe Old Mage owned a variety of powerful [[magic item]]s, including an ''[[amulet of natural armor]]'', ''[[bracers of armor]]'', a ''[[mantle of spell resistance]]'', and a ''[[thundering]] [[longsword]]''. He was also the bearer of the ''[[Lion Sword]]'', the sword-of-state for his native [[Athalantar]].\n\nFor a time, Elminster was the bearer of ''[[Andrathath's mask]]'', the eponymous facemask worn by his sadistic former [[the Masked|instructor of the arcane arts]].\n\nElminster's library housed a grand collection of books, the ''[[Keryfaertell]]'', a tome treasured by the elves of old Cormanthor; ''[[The Wizards' Workbook]]'', which originated from the same city; and for a time, ''[[Unique Mageries]]'', by [[Nezram]] \"Worldwalker\".",

His name was attached to a work titled ''Elminster's Black Book'', found in [[Undermountain]], that in fact housed a carnivorous [[palimpsest]] creature. The often-circulated [[chapbook]], ''[[The Way of Lost Power]]'', was also often erroneously attributed to him.{{Cite dungeon/174/Eye on the Realms: The Way of Lost Power|105-106}}\n\nEl crafted several powerful magical items over the years, including the first ever ''[[rod of spheres]]''."

Shattering fortresses? Easy enough. Caring diligently for all the folk who come to you, day after moon after year, and keeping at it—that's hard. Try it some time.|Elminster, date unknown.}}\nElminster counted upon many friends and allies throughout his life, from his fellow thief [[Farl]]; to long-time ally and friend, fellow [[archmage]], and often ideological rival, [[Khelben Arunsun]]. [[Rhauntides]] of [[Highmoon]], [[Maris Khorma Terrabin]] of [[Cormyr]], and [[Yandrin Thorl]] of [[Archendale]], among many others. El was also considered a friend by nobles and royalty from all across Toril and the planes beyond, including Regent [[Alusair Obarskyr]] of Cormyr (even after her death), Count [[Gamalon Idogyr]] of [[Spellshire]], and the Dragon Lord [[Mei Lung]] of the [[Kara-Tur]]an pantheon known as the [[Celestial Empire]].\n\n[[File:Wizards_three-2e.jpg|thumb|250px|''One of the many meetings of Elminster, Dalamar, and Mordenkainen.'']]\nThe Old Mage held friendships and acquaintanceships with his peers from other worlds, most notably [[Ed Greenwood|Ed of the Greenwood]] on [[Earth]], to whom Elminster told much about Faerûn while enjoying refreshments (the Sage of Shadowdale was particularly fond of piña coladas).{{Cite dragon/69/Runestones}}{{Cite dragon/69/More Pages from the Mages}} Elminster was also an aquaintance of [[Mordenkainen]] and [[Rautheene]] of [[Oerth]] and [[Dalamar]] of [[Krynn]];{{Cite dragon/238/The Return of the Wizards Three|43-47}} the three frequently met at Greenwood's home on Earth to exchange spells and news of each other's worlds,{{Cite dragon/185/Magic in the Evening|57-63}}{{Cite dragon/188/The Wizards Three: Sorcery from Three Worlds|26-34}} though Elminster would never have dared admit it to other Torillians.\n\nHe was connected in purpose and creation with all of Mystra's other [[Chosen of Mystra|Chosen]], and maintained communication with them by means of a telepathic link. He held a particularly strong bond with Mystra's own daughters, known throughout the Realms as the [[Seven Sisters]]. He helped raise three of them from childhood―[[Dove Falconhand|Ambara]], [[Laeral Silverhand|Anamanué]], and [[Ethena Astorma|Astorma]], and the pair nurtured their bond as kindred spirits for centuries.\n\nElminster maintained strong bonds of friendship with other good-aligned and scholarly minded individuals. El was dutifully served by [[Lhaeo]], his personal scribe he regularly edited works written by [[Volothamp Geddarm]], author of the widely popular but seldom fact-checked \"Volo's Guide to...\" series of travelogues; and maintained an amiable yet friendly rivalry of sorts with [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]], the Mage Royal of [[Cormyr]].\n\nHe was an ally of numerous [[adventuring companies]], The dragon named [[Gisentraxia]] was amongst Elminster's friends and allies in the late 15{{th}} century DR.>",
            "Apprentices": "Elminster continued to take on apprentices on occasion. Notable among these were [[Lycon]] \"Wolf-beard\", the mage and merchant; [[Ghleanna Stormlake]], who accompanied Elminster to [[Phlan]] when the city's ''[[pool of radiance]]'' became resurgent; [[Taranel]], a longtime scholar of the ''[[Draconomicon]]''; [[Raerlin]], who attempted to steal from the Old Mage but was subsequently destroyed at a [[magefair]]; and [[Nouméa Fairbright]], who witnessed Elminster defend himself against two [[Red Wizards]] from [[Thay]].\n\nWhile El did not originally take on a young Vangerdahast as an apprentice, the Old Mage did share with him some arcane secrets, which remained secret between the two friends.\n\nNot all of Elminster's apprenticeships ended well. By Mystra's request El began tutoring [[Sammaster]], one of the goddess's other Chosen who went on to found the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. The relationship between the two mages quickly became contentious. Sammaster left Elminster's tutelage after his obsession with Mystra and jealousy of her lovers overwhelmed the young mage.\n\nElminster eventually stopped taking on new students for a time. His decision stemmed from the fact so many young mages were corrupted by the ever-present drive to attain more powerful magic and to use that magic to wage war.",
            "Romances": "Elminster enjoyed many romances during his long and storied life, but his first and arguably most impassioned lover was the goddess Mystra herself. [[Nacacia]], a [[half-elf]] from Cormanthor; and the [[Srinshee]], a unique [[lich]]-like being that watched over [[Myth Drannor]]. El and the Srinshee enjoyed a centuries-long friendship, \n\nThe second great love of Elminster's life was [[Alassra Silverhand]], the Witch-Queen of [[Aglarond]] and the second-youngest of the Seven Sisters. after they met and famously battled one another in a spell-duel some decades prior. The love they shared continued on for well over a hundred years, enduring the death of [[Mystra (Midnight)|Alassra's reincarnated mother]], and the calamitous series of events that followed.

She briefly interrupted his studies to bid him farewell before she departed for [[Arvandor]].\n\nElminster returned to Myth Drannor and fought in the city's defense during the [[Weeping War]]. El joined the conflict about four months after the [[Army of Darkness]] first laid siege to Cormanthor in [[Nightal]] of the {{YearlinkName|711}}. He fought alongside the [[Khelben Arunsun|Nameless One]] and contributed to the elves' victory in the conflict known as [[Dawn at Erolith's Knoll]]. Months later, he fought again in the legendary [[battle at Silversgate]], which saw the Army of Darkness driven from the city. Elminster himself destroyed the ''[[gate]]'' that linked Myth Drannor to [[Silverymoon Pass]], but was inadvertently sucked into other [[planes of existence]] and lost to his allies for some time.\n\nAfter the tragic loss of the city, Elminster joined those in attendance of the [[Gathering of the Gods]] at the [[Dancing Place]] in the {{YearlinkName|720}}. This momentous occasion saw the clergies of many [[Faerûnian pantheon|human deities]] of nature, along with those of the [[Seldarine]], assemble together in unity against the agents of those whom they referred to as the 'Cruel Gods'. It marked the re-founding of the Harpers organization. These adventurers would act in defense of the good people of the Realms, while holding no allegiance to one single deity.",

Having run out of easy-to-steal magic items to feed to Alassra, Elminster sought to gain access to artifacts known to contain the spirits of [[the Nine]]—objects powerful enough to pierce the wards surrounding the [[Castle Obarskyr|Royal Palace]] or, Elminster believed, to permanently restore the Simbul's sanity."
