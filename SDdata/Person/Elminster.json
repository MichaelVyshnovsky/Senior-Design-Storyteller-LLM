        "mainbody": "During one of his excursions into the Royal Palace that same year, \nWith Amarunes consent and the aid of Storm, Elminsters essence was placed in the body of his great-grandaughter by means of a spell the ex-Chosen had discovered in a cache once belonging to Azuth. He then sought to train his great-granddaughter while attempting to defend the Forest Kingdom from Manshoon and traitorous nobles alike. He shared Runes body with her for a time, but soon discovered how to also cohabit the body of her paramore, Lord Arclath Delcastle, along with his consciousness.\nAs El learned to navigate his new bodiless existence, Storm discovered a means of permanently curing Alassra of her madness by helping her consume one of the powerful blueflame items seemingly created during the Spellplague. Meanwhile, the Manshoon of Westgate was enacting a convoluted scheme to manipulate the nobility of Cormyr and install himself as Emperor of Cormyr.\nThe situation came to a head as El, Storm, and the others struggled to offer the blueflame item to Alassra within a secluded cave, and Manshoon appeared before them all. Alassra returned to her full self, restored Elminsters physical form, and presented everyone with a missive from her long-dead mother El and Manshoon would have to work together against the machinations of the Imprisoner and close the many inter-planar rifts that had been opened by warlocks and others during the last hundred years. If they failed, the primordials would take over Toril, and the world of elves, men, and dwarves would be no more. Elminster and Manshoon both agreed to work alongside the other... for a time.\nthumb|left|350px|Els essence taking form in the Underdark, after Manshoons sudden but inevitable betrayal.\nManshoons loyalty to the others lasted all but a few minutes. Just after Alassra left to begin their work, Manshoon used his magic to once again cast Elminster from his body and plunge his essence into the Underdark. before encountering the consciousness of Symrustar Auglamyr, an elf that had lived in Cormanthor when El first stepped into the city. They traveled together as El came to inhabit the body of a drow woman and eventually made his way back up to the surface world.\nEl had managed to make his way back to Cormyr, reunited with Amarune, and heralded Mystras return to the Realms. He entered into the mind of an honest and stalwart member of the War Wizards and informed them their aid would be needed during the conflict ahead.\nMeanwhile, Alassra worked tirelessly to close rifts that had been opened across the Realms. She wielded her silver fire to slay many demons, but was nearly overwhelmed and called out to Elminster and Mystra for help. While Alassra emerged victorious, El heard her pleas but could not be heard in response. As she continued with her quest, consuming blueflame items became increasingly taxing on her body.\nWhen Elminster witnessed so much needless death and destruction caused by Manshoons schemes that he went into a murderous rage and unleashed all the remaining magic he had upon his old foe. It was not enough however, and Els newest body was blasted apart by the citys War Wizards. Alassra arrived moments later and sacrificed herself to restore Els rightful body and make himself whole again. Absolutely distraught with the loss of his lifelong love, Elminster went on to systematically slay everyone responsible for the events leading up to that point. He saved Manshoon for last, melting his body with silver fire, despite knowing the centuries-old despot could not be truly destroyed save for by divine intervention.\nEl resisted the urge to allow his rage to overtake him. He returned to the cave where Alassra was cured, carrying with him the power of the blueflame items she had amassed. El returned the arcane power to Mystra, allowing her to fully return as the Goddess of Magic once again.\nAfter suffering such tremendous loss, Elminster went to Neverwinter for its Protectors Jubilee to see the citys renewal for himself. A guest of honor at the Protectors Enclave, Elminster bade adventurers who sought him out to escort merchants through the hostile territory of Blacklake District, Ebon Downs, and Whispering Caverns had them meet with and bring a coded message left by an undercover spy with the Blacklake gangs had them capture a coded message from the Dead Rats for the Harpers to decrypt and directed them to covertly transcribe certain notes from Principles of Thaumaturgic Transmogrification at Braddas Sage Shop, among others.>\nWhen the restored Cult of the Dragon emerged as a threat to the Sword Coast in the 1480s DR, Elminster joined the armies of the Five Factions at the Well of Dragons, and helped prevent Severin Silrajin from summoning Tiamat to the Realms.\nthumb|right|350px|Elminster during the era of the Second Sundering.\nOver the next few years, Elminster and Storm Silverhand, along with Amarune and Arclath, traveled across the Realms working to strengthen the Weave at locales where some magical wards managed to survive the Spellplague. After adventuring in a dungeon near Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the , they learned that the Shadovar of Thultanthar had begun investigating similar points of interest across Faerûn. To stop Shars agents from carrying out their goddesss plot to takeover the Weave as part of the Shadow Weave, El ventured to Candlekeep to learn more about the situation. Storm, Amarune, and Arclath meanwhile traveled to the reborn city of Myth Drannor.\nWhile in Candlekeep, El discovered that both Shadovar agents and two of his fellow Chosen—Alustriel and Laeral—had spent years, decades even, within the library-fortress, preparing for events that were about to unfold. Els old friend Khelben had previously gleaned insight into the series of world-changing events known as the Second Sundering and had developed a contingency plan. Khelbens fellow Moonstars, along with Alustriel and Laeral, intended to destroy the wards of Candlekeep in order to prevent Shar and the Shadovar from utilizing them. While El remained aghast at the idea, the lich Larloch appeared before the trio and offered an alternative. Unlike Mystras living Chosen, Larloch had expertly retained his power following the Spellplague,\nAs agents of the Moonstars broke into Candlekeep to excise the Shadovar within, Elminster linked minds with the leaders of the Avowed to gain access to the librarys wards. Unfortunately, Larloch betrayed El and the others and used the mind-link to slay many of Candlekeeps monks. The Shadow King was then able to strip away Canlekeeps powerful wards for his own use. Elminster learned his lesson. He and his fellow Chosen quickly made their way to Myth Drannor, to ensure  Larloch could not also steal the power from the citys restored mythal.\nThey arrived too late, however, as Larloch invaded the minds of Thultanthars citizens and began the ritual to consume the mythal. El meanwhile used the technique Larloch taught him―bolstered by the support of Laeral and Alustriel―and gained control of the flying city itself. Given extra power by the Srinshee after she sacrificed what remained of her unlife, Elminster brought Thultanthar crashing down atop Myth Drannor in a cataclysmic blast that destroyed both cities. Fortunately, most residents of Myth Drannor had been evacuated before. The goddess Shar declined to further escalate her plot and admitted failure to her rival Mystra.\nthumb|right|300px|A stylized depiction of Elminsters classic appearance, as depicted on an Ace tarot card.\nThe following year, El hosted an event at Oldspires in Cormyr, home of the noble-born merchant Sardasper Halaunt. Several powerful archmages were summoned to the old manor, which was then caught in the middle of a powerful spellstorm, on the promise they could possibly attain powerful magic the Lost Spell. Mystra wished that the mages would come together in the spirit of camaraderie to help guide the Realms following the dual tragedies of the Spellplague and Second Sundering.\nUnfortunately, the gathering led to a series of grisly murders, as several of the mages slew each other in order to take the Lost Spell for themselves. In the end, Elminster destroyed the scroll of the Lost Spell and eradicated the spellstorm surrounding the manor. At Mystras request, he finally enacted justice on Manshoon for his atrocities. El removed the spindle of Mystryls divine essence from within the clone of the ancient wizard, but left him alive to languish without his power. \nLater on, in the , Elminster and former Lord of Waterdeep Mirt―who had been restored to life after his consciousness remained within a blueflame weapon for over a century―returned to the city of Waterdeep. Together they aided the citys recently appointed Open Lord Laeral Silverhand identify the culprits responsible for murdering numerous Masked Lords.\nThe following year, Elminster involved himself in the emergent Absolute crisis that threatened all of Baldurs Gate and the Sword Coast. He sought after Gale Dekarios, a fellow wizard and lover of Mystra, who bore a Netherese destruction orb within his chest.\nthumb|350px|left|Elminster finally confronting Sammaster in spell-battle on the far-off world of Adenthia.\nAt some point, Mystra sent Elminster to the world of Adenthia to investigate dracoliches terrorizing its lands Elminster suspected the Adenthian form of magical called chaos power was infecting her own magic. After destroying a few and learning they were connected to the local Penultima cult, he enlisted the aid of a local adventurer, the halfling mechanic Gerana, and her companions. At a local tavern, they ran into a Penultima cultist who boasted of the dracoliches power and directed them to their next attack. There, they discovered weakened, imitation dracoliches raised using chaos power from ancient dragon bones, but prone to madness, rage, and spontaneous disintegration. Fortunately, Gerana resonated with the chaos power in the bones and led Elminster to a wizards tower guarded by a Penultima cultist. Inside, they found a copy of the Tome of the Dragon, a long way from Toril, before cultists summoned them to meet their new leader none other than Elminsters old foe Sammaster. In the cult fortress, Sammaster revealed that hed resurrected himself on Adenthia, where he was venerated by Penultima as Adenthias long-lost Child of Chaos and sought to take over that world with dracoliches as he had attempted on Toril. In the end, they fought and Elminster and Gerana destroyed Sammaster again in a lengthy battle, saving the world and bringing peace, etc. Afterward, Elminster declined the offer of a massage and they returned to the tavern to celebrate, where Elminster named a local wine \"Elminsters Choice\" before he departed, presumably returning to his own world.\nAccording to the Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, Elminster owed his longevity in part to a hidden cache of elven bread imported from Evermeet. Others ascribed his many years to \"more mundane\" means, like drinking from potions of longevity, vitality, or the elixir of life.\nSome believed Elminster had a hand in the founding of the city of Waterdeep, or just with setting up its system of lords."
