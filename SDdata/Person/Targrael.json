        "mainbody": "'''Ismra Targrael''' was a former High Knight of [[Cormyr]] who later became a [[death knight]]. In [[1479 DR]], [[Manshoon]] [[Dominate person|dominated]] her mind and compelled her to place the kingdom's two highest ranking war wizards into [[magic|magical]] stasis and hide them in a crypt beneath the palace.  \n\nShe broke free of Manshoon's mind control and set about to protect Cormyr according to her own warped code of honor. Targrael fought [[Alusair Obarskyr|Alusair's]] [[ghost]] and was defeated but not destroyed. She crawled deep into the haunted wing of the palace and used a [[Blueflame ghost|blueflame relic]] to heal herself.",
        "Appearance": "Targrael had white skin and sliver-white hair. She had a patch of mold growing on her face which didn't seem to bother her."
