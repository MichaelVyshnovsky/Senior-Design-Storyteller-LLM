        "mainbody": "Ismra Targrael was a former High Knight of Cormyr who later became a death knight. In 1479 DR, Manshoon dominated her mind and compelled her to place the kingdoms two highest ranking war wizards into magical stasis and hide them in a crypt beneath the palace.  \nShe broke free of Manshoons mind control and set about to protect Cormyr according to her own warped code of honor. Targrael fought Alusairs ghost and was defeated but not destroyed. She crawled deep into the haunted wing of the palace and used a blueflame relic to heal herself.  \nTargrael had white skin and sliver-white hair. She had a patch of mold growing on her face which didnt seem to bother her."
