        "mainbody": "kixtalq, also known as Skixtalq the Obscurant, was one of the most powerful elder orbs in Faer√ªn. \nThe beholder was the Chosen of Gzemnid, who was said to have send visions to it. For its position, Skixtalq was greatly respected in Zokir and the rulers of the city regularly sought its counsel. Skixtalq could be considered to be a kind of sage, being the hives preeminent acquirer of knowledge.\nIt acquired its moniker as a result of Skixtalqs relentless efforts to erase knowledge about beholders on the surface. Often, it had its charmed agents attack libraries and sages, stealing or destroying tomes about beholders and silencing arcane scholars who studied them."
