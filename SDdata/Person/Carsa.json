Within the dungeon, they discovered a magic jar that held the spirit of the oni mage Kahrk. Kahrk drove Carsas companions mad, until they killed each other in a bloody slaughter, leaving her alone with the jar.\nShe left the ruins with the jar intact, highly traumatized and with a mind that had been greatly fractured by the oni mages evil influence."
