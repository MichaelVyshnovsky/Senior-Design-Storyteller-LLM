Zoey Fargo was a member of the Neverwinter Guard who lived in the city during the late 15 century DR.
The young soldier was quite the skilled archer.
Zoey had a good working relationship with her fellow Neverwintan guardsman Sergeant Alphonse Knox and even served alongside her sister Abbey.
She had a history with Karzov, the second-in-command of the violent splinter faction of the Sons of Alagondar known as the Nashers. He put a bounty on her head and she sought payback.
Following the Siege of Neverwinter, in the , Zoey Fargo was stationed in the Blacklake District of Neverwinter. She was tasked with stopping the efforts of the the violent splinter faction of the Sons of Alagondar known as the Nashers within the district, working with Private Hawthidon Faalwun.
Zoey was staking out a known safehouse occupied by Karzov when Hawthidon sent an intrepid adventurer seeking the stolen Crown of Neverwinter to work with her. When the Nashers realized the Guard were onto them, they set fire to the building to cover their escape. Zoey and the adventurer pursued them through the burning building, defeated Karzovs guards, but Zarzov escaped to the Nashers warehouse headquarters. For a distraction, Zoey had the adventurer burn the Nashers smuggled supply shipments. The pair then cornered Karzov in his headquarters, killed him, and recovered the Crown of Neverwinter.
A short time later she joined up with the adventurer again, along with her sister Zoey and their fellow guardsmen Sergeant Knox, Dell McCourt, Hawthidon Faalwun, and Josef Linkletter, in order to rescue Dorothea Linkletter from the evil wizard Rhazzad.
