Ayana No-Shui was a wu jen in the Northern Wastes of Kara-Tur around 1357 DR.
Over her years of travel and adventure Ayana accumulated a number of magical items. These included an amulet of communication, a bell of warning, and a set of drums of thunder.
Born with the mark of the maraloi, Ayana was always destined to become a wu jen. For a time, she acted as an adventurer throughout Kara-Tur but in the end Ayana went back to her home country, the Symorok Valley.
There, Ayana acted as prime counsel to the chieftain Shan Khantayan.
