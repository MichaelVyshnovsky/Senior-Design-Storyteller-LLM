'''Mumpo''' was a [[kobold]] from the [[Dragon's Rest]] cloister in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Mumpo once stole a [[copper piece]] from the hoard of the cloister's elder, [[Runara]]. He firmly believed she was clueless, but unbeknownst to him, she was well aware and chose to find humor in his ignorance. This strengthened his belief in his own courage.

''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1481}},{{Stormwreck-time}} Mumpo shared with three other kobolds a small [[Dragon's Rest#Monastic cells|monastic cell]] in the Dragon's Rest cloister cut into the cliff face. Each of the four slept on individual hammocks. Just like all the other kobolds, he worked at night because of their sensitivity to sunlight.
