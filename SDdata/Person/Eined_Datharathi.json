During this time, she found Ususi Manaallin and Iahn Qoyllor outside of the Body Shop she quickly approached them for help in shutting down the crystals production.\nEined Datharathi was slain by her grandfather, Shaddon Datharathi, in Tarsakh of 1374 DR after allowing the two Deep Imaskari with her inside Shaddons chambers.Per The Grand History of the Realms, Pandorym is sealed on Tarsakh 19, and the sealing occurs during the fight in which Shaddon is slain. Thus, since there is barely a day of difference between her death and his, she was slain on either Tarsakh 18 or 19. Her uncle, Zeltaebar Datharathi, wanted to elevate her to the status of a family saint after her death, while Ususi Manaallin meant for her name to be remembered amongst the greatest heroes of her people."
