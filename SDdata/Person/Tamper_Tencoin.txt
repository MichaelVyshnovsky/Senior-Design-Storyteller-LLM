'''Tamper Tencoin''' was a wayward [[Harper]].

==Activities==
Tamper was a wily adventurer who sometimes acted as a joker and other times patiently waited in order to enact vengeance.

==History==
For a time, Tamper was a member of the mercenary [[Flaming Fists]] until his commander [[Rivenhelm]] died on the battlefield, giving to him the magical sword ''[[Namarra]]'', which was later stolen by a [[Zhentarim]] agent. For a while, Tamper acted as a caravan master between [[Amn]] and [[Westgate]] and sometimes [[Neverwinter]].

After he joined the Harpers, Tamper helped the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] to defeat the [[Zhent]] mage [[Whisper]]. In his later career, he became a [[planewalker]], often traveling [[Faer√ªn]] with creatures from other [[planes]], like the [[Nehwon ghoul]] [[Lacheera]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, he went alone to [[Daggerdale]] to help [[Randal Morn]].
