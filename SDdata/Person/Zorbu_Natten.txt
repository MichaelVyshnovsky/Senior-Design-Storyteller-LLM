'''Zorbu Natten''' was a [[gnome|gnomish]] [[ranger]] active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
A tan gnome with a bushy mop of white hair and a matching beard, Zorbu clad himself in shades of green, purple, and [[leather armor]].

==Abilities==
He was a highly skilled tinker, fond of crafting all manner of technological gadgets.

==Possessions==
Zorbu wielded the enormous crossbow ''[[Thunderbolt]]'', which had a draw strength many times higher than possible for an unaided gnome. He wore [[bifocals]] to compensate for his poor vision, and kept a pet [[clockwork]] [[squirrel]] named "Skibbers". Skibbers was filled with [[alchemist's fire]], and would explode on contact with an enemy.

==History==
Born in a village on the slopes of a mountain south of [[Yartar]], Zorbu had a typical childhood filled with tinkering, pranking neighbors, and exploring the nearby woodlands under the supervision of [[Galor Rockshield]], a local ranger. When Zorbu's village was attacked by [[drow]] raiders, Galor saved the young gnome's life. Zorbu swore to avenge the many villagers killed by the drow, and was taken on as an apprentice by Galor.
