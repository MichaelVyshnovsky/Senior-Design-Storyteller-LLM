Tharlgarl "Steelfists" Darowdryn was a member of the noble House Darowdryn, one of the oldest and wealthiest merchant families of Arrabar and all of Chondath in the 14 century DR.
Tharlgarl was a huge man who resembled a bear who prided himself for his great white mustaches that hung below his chin. His nickname â€“ "Steelfists," came from the mans habit of wearing a heavy set of gold-ornamented pompous plate mail, even in Arrabarran sweltering hot and humid climate.
Tharlgarl "Steelfists" Darowdryn could often be seen accompanying and guarding his aunt Ariskrit Darowdryn, the aging matriarch of House Darowdryn.
On Tarsakh 10 of the , Ariskrit and Tharlgarl Steelfists attended Emriana Matrells grand celebration of becoming an adult, an Arrabarran tradition for a womans 16 birthday. During the celebration, Tharlgarl and Ariskrit witnessed an assassination attempt on Hetta Matrells life orchestrated by the cabal of Talriccis, Pharaboldis, and, as later revealed, Hettas own family, as retaliation for the matriarchs disapproval of the sneak coin activities.
