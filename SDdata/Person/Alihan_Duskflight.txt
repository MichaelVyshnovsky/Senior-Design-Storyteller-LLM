'''Alihan Duskflight''' was a [[high elf]] who lived in [[New Sharandar]] during the late 15{{th}} century of the [[Calendar of Harptos|Faerûnian calendar]].

==Activities==
He worked under [[Pelendethas Everstride]], aiding with the efforts to retake the [[Blighted Grove]] from the forces of the [[dark fey]] led by [[Malabog|King Malabog]].

==History==
''Circa'' the  {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Alihan worked with some adventurers from the [[Sword Coast North]] region of [[Faerûn]] to cull the number of beasts that had overrun the Blighted Grove. He also strived to heal the natural life that had been corrupted by the forces of Malabog. He had a specific salve that helped heal local wildlife, and had others destroy that plant life that was too far gone to save.
