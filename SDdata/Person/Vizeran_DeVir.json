        "mainbody": "'''Vizeran DeVir''' was an exiled [[drow]] [[archmage]] during the late 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "History": "A scion of [[House DeVir]], Vizeran studied the arcane arts at the same time as [[Gromph Baenre]]. However, Gromph discovered Vizeran's true devotion to the [[Elder Elemental Eye]] and arranged for him to be exposed as non-believer of [[Lolth]], leading to his disgrace and exile. Ironically, this spared Vizeran from the downfall of House DeVir at the hands of [[House Do'Urden]].\n\nIn his exile, he became a great archmage, building his tower of [[Araj]] and plotting his revenge.\nCenturies before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Vizeran DeVir crafted the weapons ''[[Ironfang (war pick)|Ironfang]]'', ''[[Drown]]'', ''[[Windvane]]'', and ''[[Tinderstrike]]'' for the [[Elemental Evil]] cults in the [[Fane of the Eye]] of [[Tyar-Besil]].\n\nFrom afar, Vizeran acted as the shadowy patron of the [[Council of Spiders]] and from their number he gained the assistance of [[Grin Ousstyl]].\n\n''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Vizeran correctly deduced that [[Lolth]] had manipulated Gromph as a pawn to unleash the [[demon lord]]s throughout the [[Underdark]] in order to gain absolute power in the [[Abyss]]. The demon lords in the [[Realms]] used ''[[faerzress]]'' to spread their madness. Vizeran devised a plan to send the demon lords back.\n\nTherefore, at [[Gravenhollow]], he approached an expedition led by some [[adventurer]]s, who'd been hired by [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] to investigate the threat of the demon lords, and offered his help. In truth, his plot aimed to gather all the demon lords back at their original place of summoning—[[Menzoberranzan]] itself—before they were sent back to the Abyss.\n\nFollowing an attempt to claim the [[Maze Engine]] for himself, he was banished to the Abyss by the warlock [[Makos]].<ref>",
        "Personality": "Vizeran's main objective was revenge against both Gromph and Lolth, the first for what he did to him, and the second for the dominion she maintained over all drow. His plans and goals were entirely self-serving and he would sacrifice anyone without hesitation to further his schemes.",
        "Relationship": "Vizeran interacted only with two beings: his [[death slaad]] [[Kleve]] and his apprentice [[Grin Ousstyl]], but he did not trust them."
