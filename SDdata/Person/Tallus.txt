Tallus was an archmage at the House of Wonder in Waterdeep.  He was in service to the dark god Asmodeus and the evil angel Sathariel.  He hoped to achieve immortality by helping Sathariel complete the ritual of the First Flensing which would open the gates of Hell in Waterdeep.  Instead, he was slain by the noblewoman Rilyanna Saerfynn who hoped to complete the ritual herself.
