'''Tallus''' was an [[archmage]] at the [[House of Wonder]] in [[Waterdeep]].  He was in service to the dark [[deity|god]] [[Asmodeus]] and the [[evil]] [[Angel (astral)|angel]] [[Sathariel]].  He hoped to achieve immortality by helping Sathariel complete the [[ritual]] of the [[First Flensing]] which would open the gates of [[Nine Hells|Hell]] in Waterdeep.  Instead, he was slain by the noblewoman [[Rilyanna Saerfynn]] who hoped to complete the ritual herself.
