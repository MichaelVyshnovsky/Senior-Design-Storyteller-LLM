'''Pikar Salibuck''' was a [[halfling]] apprentice at [[Blackstaff Tower]]. On 28 Uktar [[1374 DR]], he was involved in the defence of the tower against [[Kemarn Darkthrush]].

==History==
Pikar's father died while working for [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]], so in recognition of this, Khelben took Pikar on as an apprentice.

During the attack on the tower, Pikar pulled the stricken Khelben out of the gates of the tower and onto the street in attempt to get him to safety,
