'''Tollin''' was a caravaneer that traveled often along the [[High Road]] between [[Neverwinter]] and [[Luskan]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Not everyone has the coin to ship by sea or enough stock to make it worthwhile...The overland route takes longer, and has its dangers, but for many, it's the only way.|Tollin, on the life of caravan-workers.}}

==Description==
Tollin was quite knowledgeable about the trade goods that came in and out of both Neverwinter and Luskan, as well as the dangers regularly encountered during life on the road.

He had a missing finger that he lost while out fishing.

==Relationships==
Tollin worked with the caravan driver [[Martumal]].

==History==
He began his career sometime around the {{YearlinkName|1478}},{{cite web |url=https://forums.swordcoast.com/index.php?/topic/9116-when-is-scl-taking-place-what-year/ |title=When Is Scl Taking Place?

Some time during or around the {{YearlinkName|1490}}, Tollin and his crew led a trip from Neverwinter to Luskan, accompanied by members of the [[Order of the Burning Dawn]]. Among those that joined their caravan were [[Aleema Meddlebrook]], [[Wilfred Brewbanks]], [[William Ray]], [[Rorik]], the [[tiefling]] [[Oraphelia Mayne]], and an [[elven]] girl named [[Jaena]]. The trip was somewhat of a disaster, as several members of their group went missing, and Jaena's dog [[Guen]] bit a man named [[Jessup]]. To make things worse, members of the caravan's group were attacked by mercenaries, an assault that was set up by the treacherous Martumal.
