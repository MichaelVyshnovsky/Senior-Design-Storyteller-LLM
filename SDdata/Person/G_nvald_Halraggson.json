        "mainbody": "Bear King G端nvald Halraggson () was the ruler of the Tribe of the Bear during the late 15 century DR, in the years following the War of the Silver Marches.\nG端nvald was a merciless and stalwart king who did his best to bring honor to his reign.\nHe didnt understand the \"civilized\" folks of the Ten Towns and stayed well away from their influence.\nFor some time, G端nvald led the Tribe of the Bear with his fellow chieftain Wolvig Barrundson. After Wolvig fell under the influence of the Aurilian Chosen known as the Ice Witch and perished, G端nvald became the tribes sole leader and Bear King."
