King '''Alemander I''' of the [[House Tethyr|House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul]] was the seventh king of the [[Lions' Dynasty]] of [[Tethyr]]. Called '''Alemander the Spellbinder''', he was regarded as one of the Hero-Kings of Tethyr.

==Abilities==
Alemander was a [[wizard]] before he became a monarch.

==Possessions==
Alemander's sword, the ''[[Lion's Sword]]'', was forged by a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] ally. Alemander later enchanted the blade, granting it the power of [[flaming tongue|flame]], a magical power that was rare at that time for weapons in Tethyr.

==Activities==
As king, Alemander I gave royal contributions to support the orders of [[Torm]]ish and [[Ilmatari]] priests at [[Barakmordin]], who had supported him in his rise to power. With these funds, the fortified abbey received its outer walls and a new central keep.

==Relationships==
Alemander I was the oldest grandson of King [[Coram I]]. and a younger brother named [[Coram II]], who for some reason lost to scholars, took the throne before him.

==History==
Alemander was born in [[1038 DR]]. In [[1050 DR]], when Alemander was only a boy, his family was traveling with a caravan when they were attacked by a group of three [[wereboar]]s. His father Natan died saving all of them.

In [[1070 DR]], [[Teremir Bormul II|Teremir Bormul]] started a coup against King Coram II, Alemander's brother. In the month of [[Kythorn]], after a personal duel, Coram II was killed by Teremir, who took the throne as Teremir II and restored the [[Queens' Dynasty|dynasty]] of his great-grandfather. Before a year had passed, however, Alemander avenged his death and retook the throne for the Lions' Dynasty by the month of [[Ches]].

In the first year of his reign, Alemander had all of Teremir's heirs executed.

In [[1090 DR]], King Alemander forced a treaty with King [[Imnel IV]] of neighboring [[Amn]]. As part of the treaty, Amn ceded all of its lands south of the [[Tethir Road]] to Tethyr in exchange for a large sum of money and military support against monsters in the region.

Alemander lived an exceptionally long life for a human, over 100 years, dying at last in [[1145 DR]]. He was succeeded by his third-oldest great-grandson, [[Coram III]].
