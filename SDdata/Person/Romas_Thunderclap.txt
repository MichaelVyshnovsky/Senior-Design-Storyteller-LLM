'''Romas Thunderclap''' was the leader of an adventuring band called the [[Tenblades]].

==Activities==
Angered by the murder of two of his fellows, Romas constructed the dominating fortress of [[Darmshall]] to stand as a bastion against the wicked traveling through [[Vaasa]]. Romas' fortress was so well defended that even the [[Zhengyi|Witch King]] could not breach its defenses.
