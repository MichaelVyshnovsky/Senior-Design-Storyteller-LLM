        "mainbody": "'''Hane Cartcoster''' was a [[human]] merchant of [[Yhaunn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Hane was an anxious woman, always worried about the welfare of her son.",
        "Relationships": "Hane had married a [[half-orc]] mercenary and had her son [[Jarull Cartcoster|Jarull]] with him, but her husband died shortly afterwards on a violent adventure. Fearful that her son would meet a similar fate, she fretted for him constantly as he grew into a rebellious young man.",
        "History": "In [[Kythorn]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, her son Jarull voluntarily joined the [[Temple of Shar (Yhaunn)|cult of Shar]] in Yhaunn in search of new experiences, only to be kidnapped and taken prisoner by the [[Thultanthar]]an [[shade]] [[Variance Amatick]], who stole his identity and it to manipulate his friend [[Keph Thingoleir]] into joining the cult as well.\n\nWith her son missing, Hane had the city guard arrest and interrogate Keph, believing he knew what had happened, to no result. She also contacted the famous [[wizard]] [[Strasus Thingoleir]] and had him attempt to [[Divination|magically divine]] Jarull's location, also to no effect.\n\nJarull was finally rescued after more than twenty days of darkness and torture, and sent to the local [[Rack of Glory|temple of Ilmater]] for treatment."
