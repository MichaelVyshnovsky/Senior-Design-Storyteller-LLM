Shoudra defended themselves, saying that had they known that Mithral Hall was at war with the [[orc]] tribes, they would not have attempted to poison the ore. Shoudra and Nanfoodle then aided Mithral Hall in its war efforts.{{cite book/The Hunters Blades trilogy|698}}\n\nSoon after, at the battle of Mithral Hall's eastern gates, Shoudra was hoisted into the air by King [[Obould|Obould Many-Arrow]]s and sliced in half with his flaming greatsword."
