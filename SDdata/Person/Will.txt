'''Will''' was a farmer of the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relations==
He was drinking buddies with [[Bortas]] and [[Rob]] at the [[Swamp Rat]] tavern.

==Personality==
He smoked a [[pipe]] and was wary of wizards.

==History==
On [[Eleasis 16|Eleasias 16]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, when Farmer Bortas and his wife came to the Swamp Rat reporting they'd seen the bandit chieftain [[Fastred]], Rob and Will joined his posse of fellow farmers and returned to the scene, but the ghost had vanished and they didn't dare venture into the [[Vast Swamp]].

Later that year, on [[Eleint 17]], [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] went to the Swamp Rat tavern and met Bortas, Rob, and Will. He bought them [[Shadowdark ale]] and asked about the ghost sighting, after it was discovered to be [[Dovo]] in disguise, who was found dead.

Two nights later, on [[Eleint 19]], Bortas, Rob, and Will came out of the Swamp Rat and saw Jasper and a group of townsfolk escorted by the [[Purple Dragons]] to [[Benelaius]]'s house for the investigation into Dovo's murder.
