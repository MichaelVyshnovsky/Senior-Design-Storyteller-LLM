Will was a farmer of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the mid–14 century DR.
He was drinking buddies with Bortas and Rob at the Swamp Rat tavern.
He smoked a pipe and was wary of wizards.
On Eleasias 16 in the , when Farmer Bortas and his wife came to the Swamp Rat reporting theyd seen the bandit chieftain Fastred, Rob and Will joined his posse of fellow farmers and returned to the scene, but the ghost had vanished and they didnt dare venture into the Vast Swamp.
Later that year, on Eleint 17, Jasper went to the Swamp Rat tavern and met Bortas, Rob, and Will. He bought them Shadowdark ale and asked about the ghost sighting, after it was discovered to be Dovo in disguise, who was found dead.
Two nights later, on Eleint 19, Bortas, Rob, and Will came out of the Swamp Rat and saw Jasper and a group of townsfolk escorted by the Purple Dragons to Benelaiuss house for the investigation into Dovos murder.
