Caslatus Crypthound was an elven vampire hunter, active in the 14 century DR.
Caslatus hailed from a peaceful community in the Far Hills. At one point in his youth, he became obsessed with what he thought was his destiny—following in the footsteps of the vampire hunters of old. He went against his parents wishes and embarked on the quest to eradicate Faerûns blood-sucking undead. His life gradually became a martyrdom consumed by zeal.
Sometime in the 14 century DR, when Caslatus Crypthound reached the age of 119, he was among adventurers interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths.
