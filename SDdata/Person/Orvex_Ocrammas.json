        "mainbody": "rvex Ocrammas () was a scribe and translator in Chult in the late 15 century DR.\nOrvex was pragmatic and mercenary in his choice of employers,\nOrvex was born in the midâ€“15 century DR, and was in his early forties and had begun to go bald by the time of the death curse.\nDuring the events of the curse, he worked for a Thayan expedition to Omu led by the Red Wizard Zagmira, although he felt little loyalty to these employers and worked with them solely for the good pay. While investigating the Omuan ruins, he successfully learned to decipher the Old Omuan alphabet, allowing him to read ancient carvings that informed him about the Legend of the Nine Gods as well as about the citys shrines to the Nine Trickster Gods. He created a number of maps of the ruins to show the locations of these shrines.\nEventually, the yuan-ti of Omu attacked the Thayans encampment, killing most of the expedition. Orvex survived, but an explosion left him buried under a fallen wall, whereupon he was subsequently abandoned. He soon began suffering from exhaustion and dehydration."
