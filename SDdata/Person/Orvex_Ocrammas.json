While investigating the Omuan ruins, he successfully learned to decipher the [[Old Omuan]] alphabet, allowing him to read ancient carvings that informed him about the [[Legend of the Nine Gods]] as well as about the city's shrines to the [[Nine Trickster Gods]]. He created a number of maps of the ruins to show the locations of these shrines.\n\n{{Fq\n| text =   Orvex Ocrammas at your service, scribe and translator.
