        "mainbody": "Locke was a human psionicist who worked as an entertainer and confidence artist.\nHe had tan skin, with long, graying hair, and clad himself in a long blue robe fastened with a black belt at his waist. He was known for being rather ugly.\nLocke was a wanderer, only staying in any one place long enough to earn a few coins. He thoroughly enjoyed surprising people with his psionic powers. Locke had the privilege of having many friends and no enemies, a feat he accomplished by manipulating people with his medallion of thought projection. He also used the medallion to acquire romantic partners, and was well known for his uncanny ability to seduce women.\nLockes medallion of thought projection caused him to broadcast his thoughts to anyone within 90 feet straight in front of him. Over time, he learned to harness this power, ensuring he could control exactly who picked up his thoughts. He paid a wizard to enchant the medallion with a permanent suggestion spell, allowing him to cast the spell mentally, then project it into the mind of his choice.\nAside from his medallion, Locke owned a pair of bracers of defense.\nOne of his regular grifts involved using his medallion to convince his marks they were psychic."
