        "mainbody": "'''Ubbalux''' was an imprisoned [[barlgura]] in [[Avernus]], first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Once, [[archdevil]] [[Bel]] defeated Ubbalux and imprisoned him inside a circle of obelisks, telling him that the secret of escaping was inside the runes inscribed into the obelisks. From then on, Ubbalux studied the runes but with no fortune.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} Ubbalux was posing as a [[human]] [[wizard]], one whom he had previously devoured, hoping to manipulate the next visitors the circle in order to gain their help."
