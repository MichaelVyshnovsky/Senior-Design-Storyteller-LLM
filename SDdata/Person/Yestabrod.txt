'''Yestabrod''' was a mutant [[myconid]] leader of the [[Circle of Masters]] in [[Neverlight Grove]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In Neverlight Grove ''circa'' [[1486 DR]], Yestabrod was created as the leader of the new Circle of Masters, which was formed by [[Phylo]] only from myconids corrupted by [[Zuggtmoy]]. It was so corrupted by the [[demon lord]] that it looked more like an [[aberration]] than a myconid.
