'''Maltzabloc Riffenhammer''' was a young [[deep gnome]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1313 DR]], Maltzabloc was a member of an expedition from [[Blingdenstone]] led by Burrow Warden [[Belwar Dissengulp]] to mine some [[arandur]]. The young gnome believed that [[Symvyn Rivenstone]], a decorated hero of the city and fellow member of the expedition, was a traitor in league with [[drow]] or [[duergar]] and expressed his suspicions to Belwar, who was dubious of them.
