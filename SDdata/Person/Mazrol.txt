}}'''Mazrol''' was a former priest of [[Vhaeraun]].

==History==
Mazrol was one of the many priests of Vhaeraun who joined the [[Church of Eilistraee]] after [[1375 DR]].

Mazrol however actually agreed with [[Valdar Jaelre]]'s idea that it was Vhaeraun who had killed [[Eilistraee]] and was playing a deception plot.

In [[1379 DR]], Mazrol, alongside Valdar and others, plotted to help [[Ghaunadaur]]'s followers attack the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]]. However, he, together with [[Naxil]] and [[Jub]], was put inside the Pit by the priests of Ghaunadaur who were trying to awaken the [[avatar]] of their god. The ooze god consumed Mazrol.
