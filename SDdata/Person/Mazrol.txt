Mazrol was a former priest of Vhaeraun.
Mazrol was one of the many priests of Vhaeraun who joined the Church of Eilistraee after 1375 DR.
Mazrol however actually agreed with Valdar Jaelres idea that it was Vhaeraun who had killed Eilistraee and was playing a deception plot.
In 1379 DR, Mazrol, alongside Valdar and others, plotted to help Ghaunadaurs followers attack the Promenade of the Dark Maiden. However, he, together with Naxil and Jub, was put inside the Pit by the priests of Ghaunadaur who were trying to awaken the avatar of their god. The ooze god consumed Mazrol.
