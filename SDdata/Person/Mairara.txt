'''Mairara''' was a [[Zhentarim]] apprentice in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She kept her glossy black hair long.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|62-63|3}} Her hands were clawed.

==Personality==
Mairara was treacherous, ambitious,{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|95-96|5}} However, she wanted to prove herself,{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|170-173|10}} and expected no more mercy than she gave. For whatever reason, she misliked the idea of lovers being driven against each other,{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|149|8}} or perhaps, her master's more bloodthirsty side.

==Abilities==
She knew at least one spell of lightning that struck many from a distance. She also knew a spell that converted a dead [[gargoyle]] into two fresh ones.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|178|11}}

==Relationships==
She was apprenticed to [[Gathlarue]]. The two were romantically involved,{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/02-06 - Women in the Zhentarim}}

==History==
As of late {{yearlink|1357}}, Mairara was with Gathlarue and Tespril at [[Marsember]] with sixteen [[Zhentilar]] as an escort when they set out to capture [[Shandril Shessair]].{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|232|14}} The group scried on Shandril all the way, until they moved personally at [[Irondrake Rock]].

During the battle, Mairara employed a spell that converted a shattered gargoyle into two gargoyles, both of which she controlled.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|181-182|11}}
