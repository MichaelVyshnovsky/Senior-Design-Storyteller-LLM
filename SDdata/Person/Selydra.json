        "mainbody": "elydra, or the Pale Sybil, was an undead wizard living in Lorosfyr in the 1370s DR. She was a kind of vampire that consumed souls and magic.\nSelydra went to Lorosfyr in the hopes of learning the secrets of Imaskari magecraft.\nIn 1374 DR, Araevin Teshurrs party ventured into her realm in search of a shard of the Gatekeepers Crystal.\nSelydra explained to Araevin that indeed she had the shard but she needed it to defeat the Maddening Dark. She proposed to exchange it for a thaluud scepter hidden in a vault under Anauroch.\nSoon, however, a battle broke out between Selydra and her minions and Araevins party, but at last the elves prevailed and Araevin recovered the shard while defeating the Pale Sybil."
