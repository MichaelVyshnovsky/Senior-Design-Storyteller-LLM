        "History": "Selydra went to Lorosfyr in the hopes of learning the secrets of [[Imaskari]] magecraft.\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], [[Araevin Teshurr]]'s party ventured into her realm in search of a shard of the ''[[Gatekeeper's Crystal]]''.\n\nSelydra explained to Araevin that indeed she had the shard but she needed it to defeat the [[Maddening Dark]]. She proposed to exchange it for a [[thaluud]] scepter hidden in a vault under [[Anauroch]].\n\nSoon, however, a battle broke out between Selydra and her minions and Araevin's party, but at last the elves prevailed and Araevin recovered the shard while defeating the Pale Sybil."
