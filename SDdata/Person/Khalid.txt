Khalid was a half-elf from CalimshanIn the Baldurs Gate novel Khalid is described as being Amnian. as well as a member of the Harpers during the 14 century DR. Together with his wife Jaheira, he investigated the iron crisis which threatened the region with a war between Baldurs Gate and Amn, became involved in the defense of Bridgefort during the War of the Shining Crusade, and was briefly caught up in the early events of the Bhaalspawn conflict.
Khalid was a kind, if a bit nervous man, and spoke with a noticeable stutter. While he was not the bravest warrior in the world, he was quite capable of holding his own in most battles.
At one point in his younger years, Khalid wore a beard.
Khalid did not have a great relationships with his parents. He was particularly disliked by his merchant father, who preferred the half-elfs half-brothers. 
He was married to Jaheira, a fellow Harper whose strong personality was complementary to his own. Despite their very different personalities, they cared deeply for each other.In the same novel, Khalid and Jaheira have a strained relationship due to Khalids infidelity.
Khalid was born to a well-to-do Calishite couple who cared little for him. This caused Khalid to throw himself into the martial pursuits in spite of his otherwise placid nature. Some time later, he joined the Harpers and met and fell in love with the druid Jaheira. The two married in the Dalelands on a gloomy rainy day, standing atop an upturned cart. Later in life, Jaheira sentimentally remembered this simple ceremony for the groom stammering so much that she wondered if the vows actually counted.
At some point before their time on the Sword Coast, Khalids poetry caused Jaheira to implement a humorous ban on such gifts. Khalid, ever resourcefully, hired a certain retired Cormyte War Wizard to produce a new type of a nameday present for his wife – a sheet of parchment with an image from a persons mind transferred onto its surface. This magic was created for espionage, not art. So the resulting image was a slightly uncanny image of a young smiling couple with their mouth open too wide and their joints slightly misplaced. The parchment was signed "With all my love, and from a safe distance. Khalid."
In the  Khalid and Jaheira were traveling the Sword Coast tasked by the Harpers with investigating the iron crisis that plagued the region. They stayed the Friendly Arm Inn and were asked by their friend Gorion to watch after their foster child, should any harm come to him.
A short time after the end of the iron crisis, Khalid and Jaheira traveled a short ways away from the city to the region around Boareskyr Bridge. While they stated this was a "getaway" for them as a couple, they were actually investigating the Shining Lady and the Shining Crusade that rose up from throughout the Sword Coast. The pair became separated by the crusaders Khalid was stuck within the minor settlement of Bridgefort while Jaheira was forced to keep her distance, well beyond the crusades siege. During this adventure, Khalid gathered the finest spidersilk from the Forest of Wyrms and a perfect unblemished aquamarine to fashion an anniversary gift for his beloved wife, the necklace she would cherish for over a century after.
After the hero of Baldurs Gate was released from imprisonment within High Hall, Khalid, Jaheira, the young mage Imoen, the Rashemi witch Dynaheir and the berserker Minsc were all captured by the fallen elven mage Irenicus and his vampire companion Bodhi. Before Irenicus tortured and experimented on Imoen and her foster sibling, he slowly killed Khalid with a knife and forced the young mage to watch. Khalids lifeless body was desecrated within the dungeon beneath the streets of Athkatla.In the novel Khalid is killed by some manner of slime or ooze.
Even over a century after his death, Khalid was remembered as a historic figure, who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Jaheira and Abdel Adrian and helped to end the Iron crisis and the Bhaalspawn crisis. His name was mentioned in books, accords, and songs by bards and minstrels, even though sometimes he was depicted in not the most flattering light.
