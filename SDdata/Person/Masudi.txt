Masudi was a Semphari caravan master traveling the Hordelands in 1367 DR.
Because of his belief in the set of laws known as muhjari, Masudi was a strict individual. He fully believed in the practice of abstinence, fasting, and avoiding all physical pleasure. As such, he expected any who traveled with his caravan to follow the same rules. He would not tolerate others to worship "false gods" in his presence.
Masuid made his home in Dhaztanar.
