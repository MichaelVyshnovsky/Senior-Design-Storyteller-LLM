Betty was an innocent cow who grazed in the Wild Pastures of the Delimbiyr Vale circa 1372 DR.
On one rainy day in the , Betty, along with two other fellow cows, were watched by Ivrin the Shepherd as they grazed on the lush green grass of the Wild Pastures, west of the hamlet of Liams Hold. Suddenly, Ivrin heard strange giggling and Betty "went poof," as the shepherd later claimed. The mystery of disappearing cattle attracted the attention of the Hero of Daggerford, who met with Ivrin to discuss poor Bettys fate. Eventually, the Heros investigation revealed that a tribe of goblins armed with a magical brew that rendered cattle invisible was abducting animals off pastures to feed an army of orcs and tanarukka of the devil Gorgomorz. The every-hungry horde was assembling to attack the nearby city of Daggerford.
