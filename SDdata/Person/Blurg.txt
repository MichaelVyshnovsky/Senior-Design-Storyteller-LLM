'''Blurg''' was an [[orog]] member of the [[Society of Brilliance]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Details of Blurg's early life were unknown, though he eventually joined the Society of Brilliance; having done so alongside [[Omeluum]], [[Grazilaxx]], [[Sloopidoop]], [[Y]], and [[Skriss]]. Blurg and all the other members of the Society went on a pilgrimage to [[Gravenhollow]] some years before the [[demon]]ic crisis that struck the Underdark ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1486}}. 

As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Blurg was studying alongside [[Omeluum]], a fellow scholar of the Society of Brilliance at the [[Ebonlake Grotto]].<ref name="BGIII" >

Subsequently, Blurg and Omeluum departed the Ebonlake Grotto and returned to the Society of Brilliance's lodge in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], where he, and other members of the group may had been murdered by [[Ptaris]], a [[githyanki]] magically-raised from an egg acquitted by Lady [[Esther]].
