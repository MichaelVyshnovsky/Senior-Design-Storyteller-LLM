'''Vorasaegha''' was an ancient [[guardian dragon]] living in [[Gray Forest]] in [[Impiltur]] during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]].

==History==
Vorasaegha was a female [[bronze dragon]] in past ages prior to her death. Her spirit however continued to wander the forest she loved.

In 1373 DR, in a desperate effort to destroy a [[Cult of the Dragon]] hideout hidden in the Gray Forest, the [[avariel]] [[Taegan Nightwind]], leader of the remaining [[Impiltur]]an troops, and the [[faerie dragon]] [[Jivex]] evoked Vorasaegha, who incarnated herself in a [[bronze dragon]]. In that form, she attacked the cultists and entered into combat with the [[green dragon]] [[dracolich]] leader. The dracolich eventually found a way to expel the guardian spirit. However, the significant damage that the bronze dragon had inflicted allowed Taegan, Jivex, and the Impilturans to destroy the evil creature.
