==Description==
Harvard Willoughby was a [[human]] man with a light skin tone, blue eyes, blonde hair, and a mustache. He was a snappy dresser, wearing a mage's [[robe]], a wide-brimmed [[hat]], and a [[monocle]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Harvard Willoughby hosted a stand-up comedy competition called the "Laff Riot." Together with his young son, [[Belford Willoughby]], who was Harvard's less-than-enthused announcer, the duo occupied Elfsong's side room with a stage and a [[piano]]. Harvard would challenge guests to a stand-up competition of jokes in which the winner would be the one who causes the most cheering and applause. Harvard was the usual winner of the show, as the public seemed to enjoy the man's copious puns. He joked about [[drow]] comedian who used ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter]]'' on the attendees and that drow didn't need [[torch]]es as they had [[darkvision]]. His other jokes included references to his wife who cheated on him with a [[mage]] who could cast ''[[mage hand]]'' all night long and that she ran away from him with a [[fiend]], "fiend-zoning" the man. Harvard discouraged jokes about religion and appreciated good porcine humor.
