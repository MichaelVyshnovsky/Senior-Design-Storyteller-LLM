'''Won Kwang''', known commonly as '''the Master''', was a noted [[monk]], scholar, and philosopher of [[Koryo]].

In [[925 DR]], Won established a school for martial arts and other skills in the city of [[Pyong Do]] in the then kingdom of [[Koguryo]]. Won set down its daily routine and defined five rules for the basis of its teachings and the good behavior of its students:
# "Loyalty to lawful rulers."
# "Honor to parents and friends."
# "Bravery in battle."
# "Strength in heart and mind."
# "Mercy and justice in necessary killing."
Won also built a shrine there. By [[1357 DR]], the [[Do Jang of Won Kwang]] was a prestigious military academy that had trained many great generals, even King [[Wanang Sun]].
