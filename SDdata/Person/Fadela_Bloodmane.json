        "mainbody": "Fadela Bloodmane was a member of the House of Nasr of the High Desert of west Zakhara, and their likely successor, in 1367 DR.\nFadela was a rambunctious individual who thirsted for adventure. \nFadelas nickname, Urf-al-Dam or Bloodmane, stems from her dark red hair which had the color of dried blood. This rare hair coloration led many to believe her father was a janni or an outlander. \nFadela was captured by accident by mamluk \"recruiters\" since they believed her to be an outsider because of her striking hair. Her mother ended up breaking into the tower of Emir Hatit Abd al-Wajib in Qudra to demand her release. \nFadela was the eldest child of Sheikh Nadia umm Fadela. Amar bin Nadia was her younger brother."
