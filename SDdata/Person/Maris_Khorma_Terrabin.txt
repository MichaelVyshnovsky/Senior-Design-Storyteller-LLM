'''Maris Khorma Terrabin''' was a [[wizard]], explorer, [[adventurer]], and ecologist who traveled the Realms widely in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and studied the people, places and creatures in it.

==Personality==
Maris was rather proud of her deep knowledge of the lands she had explored, as well as her abilities as a wizard.

She was very critical of [[goblin]]s in particular, holding them to generally be cruel, cowardly, and foolish looters and raiders.

==History==
Maris grew up in the tame and well-ordered lands of central [[Cormyr]], and apprenticed under the wizard [[Felbour]]. She became enamored with tales of monsters and ruins, and at the first opportunity joined a company of adventurers on a jaunt through the [[Stonelands]] in search of the legendary [[Citadel of Seligonil]]. They ventured for months in the region, fighting border raiders and monsters, and though they did not find the mythical Citadel, Maris gained an abiding appreciation for the mysteries and treasures of the Stonelands.

She and her companions built a wooden keep in the just north of the [[High Moors]], and used it as a base to further explore the Stonelands, [[Goblin Marches]], [[Thunder Peaks]], [[Storm Horns]], [[Farsea Marshes]], [[Skull Gorge]], and into [[Anauroch]] in search of [[Rasilith]]. In later years, her companions perished or drifted apart, and she moved on to new adventures in [[West Faer√ªn|the west]], pausing briefly in the 1360s [[DR]] to write a [[Elminster's Ecologies (in-universe)|regional guide]] for her friend [[Elminster]].
