Maris Khorma Terrabin was a wizard, explorer, adventurer, and ecologist who traveled the Realms widely in the 14 century DR and studied the people, places and creatures in it.
Maris was rather proud of her deep knowledge of the lands she had explored, as well as her abilities as a wizard.
She was very critical of goblins in particular, holding them to generally be cruel, cowardly, and foolish looters and raiders.
Maris grew up in the tame and well-ordered lands of central Cormyr, and apprenticed under the wizard Felbour. She became enamored with tales of monsters and ruins, and at the first opportunity joined a company of adventurers on a jaunt through the Stonelands in search of the legendary Citadel of Seligonil. They ventured for months in the region, fighting border raiders and monsters, and though they did not find the mythical Citadel, Maris gained an abiding appreciation for the mysteries and treasures of the Stonelands.
She and her companions built a wooden keep in the just north of the High Moors, and used it as a base to further explore the Stonelands, Goblin Marches, Thunder Peaks, Storm Horns, Farsea Marshes, Skull Gorge, and into Anauroch in search of Rasilith. In later years, her companions perished or drifted apart, and she moved on to new adventures in the west, pausing briefly in the 1360s DR to write a regional guide for her friend Elminster.
