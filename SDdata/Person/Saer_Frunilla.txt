{{quote|''No matter what the Gazette says, I just hope Lord Gortash protects us when it counts.''|Saer Frunilla}}

==Description==
She was a [[human]] woman with a fair bronze skin tone, blue eyes, and a full head of red curly hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Saer Frunilla was among those citizens of the Gate who were not convinced by the [[broadsheet]]s and propaganda coming from the office of the new [[Grand Duke]]. The rulers promised safety from the encroaching army of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], but Frunilla thought that they were as vulnerable as if they were outside the city walls. However, she was hopeful that when the time came, Lord [[Enver Gortash]] would fulfill his promises to the city.
