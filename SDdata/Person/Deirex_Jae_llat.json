        "mainbody": "Deirex Jaellat was a powerful drow lich who founded the city of Ust Natha.\nThe lich owned a tower in Ust Natha, which was protected by a guard and several wards. A magical rope from Visaj could penetrate the wards on the lowest floor, allowing entry. It would also protect the owner from a lichs imprisonment spell.\nDeirex owned a ward stone for House Jaellat, without which one could not enter the house. He also had a special tooth, which acted as a key for the doors in his tower, as well as his treasure vault at the top of the tower. His tower contained many powerful spell scrolls.\nIn about 1369 DR, a member of Bregan Daerthe, called Visaj, told Gorions Wards party that the lich had captured many of Jarlaxles men. The party was told that Deirex used magical purple gems to store the imprisoned souls of his enemies. Apparently, however, this was just a ruse by Jarlaxle and Visaj, in order for the party to acquire these expensive gems from Deirex Jaellat. Jarlaxle, as a result of his cunning, settled matters with House Jaellat, whod previously humiliated him."
