        "mainbody": "'''Deirex Jae'llat''' was a powerful [[drow]] [[lich]] who founded the city of [[Ust Natha]].",
        "Possessions": "The lich owned a tower in Ust Natha, which was protected by a guard and several wards. A magical [[rope]] from [[Visaj]] could penetrate the wards on the lowest floor, allowing entry. It would also protect the owner from a lich's ''[[imprisonment]]'' spell.\n\nDeirex owned a ward stone for [[House Jae'llat]], without which one could not enter the house. He also had a special tooth, which acted as a key for the doors in his tower, as well as his treasure vault at the top of the tower. His tower contained many powerful [[spell]] [[scroll]]s.",
        "History": "In about [[1369 DR]], a member of [[Bregan D'aerthe]], called Visaj, told [[Gorion's Ward]]'s party that the lich had captured many of [[Jarlaxle]]'s men. The party was told that Deirex used magical purple gems to store the imprisoned souls of his enemies. Apparently, however, this was just a ruse by Jarlaxle and Visaj, in order for the party to acquire these expensive gems from Deirex Jae'llat. Jarlaxle, as a result of his cunning, settled matters with House Jae'llat, who'd previously humiliated him."
