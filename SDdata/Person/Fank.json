        "Description": "Fank wore a crude loincloth and hide-wrapped boots.",
        "Abilities": "The ogre worked with [[Chock]] and their leader, [[Lump (ogre)|Lump the Enlightened]], the latter of whom benefited from the refined intellect granted by ''[[headband of intellect]]''. Fank and Chock spent much of their debating what various [[humanoid]] creatures tasted like, along with whether or not they should be considered 'friends' or 'food'.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Fank, Chock, and Lump were hired by the [[cult of the Absolute]]. The trio were stationed in the ruins of [[Moonhaven]], directed to check passersby for anyone bearing the ''mark of the Absolute''. While they were compensated well by their goblin clientele, their true rewards were the creatures they got to consume along the way."
