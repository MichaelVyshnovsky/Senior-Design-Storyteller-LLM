Dzurdan Crommarch was a cleric of Tymora at the Gate of Good Fortune temple in Mulmaster in the Moonsea in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Every two tendays or so, Dzurdan rode south to the village of Maskyrs Eye, accompanied by two lay followers and four men-at-arms, to collect offerings left at the shrine of Tymora there from the local priest Khonduil Ammargath. If he learned that anyone had desecrated the shrine, stolen the offerings, or hurt the old priest, then Dzurdan would grimly search for those responsible.
