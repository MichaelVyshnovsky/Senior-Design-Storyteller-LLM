        "mainbody": "'''Faerovel Hawntar''' was a [[priest]] of [[Auril]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] who originally hailed from the town of [[Glister]].",
        "History": "During the 15{{th}} century DR, Faerovel traveled [[Faer√ªn]] and attempted to coerce followers of Auril into swearing allegiance to him. His goal was to reach the heights of power once held over the [[church of Auril]] by the self-styled \"High Icemaiden\" [[Raerele Aronthan]], who became the most powerful follower of Auril during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. In his efforts to gain power, he had a rivalry with fellow Aurilian priest [[Amgrel Vlorund]]."
