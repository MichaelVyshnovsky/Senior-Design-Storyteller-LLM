        "mainbody": "Faerovel Hawntar was a priest of Auril in the late 15 century DR who originally hailed from the town of Glister.\nDuring the 15 century DR, Faerovel traveled Faer√ªn and attempted to coerce followers of Auril into swearing allegiance to him. His goal was to reach the heights of power once held over the church of Auril by the self-styled \"High Icemaiden\" Raerele Aronthan, who became the most powerful follower of Auril during the 14 century DR. In his efforts to gain power, he had a rivalry with fellow Aurilian priest Amgrel Vlorund."
