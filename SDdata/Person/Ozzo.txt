'''Ozzo''' was a ''[[charm monster|charmed]]'' [[ogre giant]] who lived in the fortress of [[Krak al-Niraan]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
[[Jamal al-Yindannim]] used his powers to charm Ozzo into serving the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]] as a brutishly dangerous guard. Ozzo inhabited a large chamber found near the postern of the keep. Anyone entering this area unaccompanied by Jamal, whom Ozzo considered to be his best friend, risked being violently smashed.

Ozzo was carefully monitored by 24 ''[[midani dictionary|fedayeen]]'' at all times, perhaps as a safeguard in case the magic keeping the large brute under control failed. Any intruder lucky or skilled enough to breach Ozzo's chamber was attacked by 23 of the ''fedayeen'' while the remaining guard alerted the rest of the keep.
