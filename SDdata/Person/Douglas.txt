==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Douglas was still a [[human]] youth who began his apprenticeship under Booter in the guild's torture chambers of [[Aran Linvail]]'s hideout located in the [[Athkatla/Wave District|Wave District]]'s docks. The child was tasked with cleaning up expired "guests" and dismembering eager corpses for his master. Despite still working for Booter, Douglas began having reservations about his choice of future vocation.
