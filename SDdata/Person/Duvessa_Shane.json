        "mainbody": "'''Duvessa Shane''' was the speaker of [[Bryn Shander]] in [[1485 DR]] and sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].",
        "History": "Duvessa was the daughter of a [[Waterdhavian]] trader and a woman of [[Icewind Dale]].\n\nIn time, she became the speaker of Bryn Shander and leader of the [[Ten Towns]]'s council. In 1485 DR, with many threats to the dale arising, Duvessa met and befriended a trader from Waterdeep, [[Vaelish Gant]], who soon became her unofficial political aide. On [[Eleint 23]] of that year, an election was called for the position of speaker and Duvessa ran for reelection. What she did not know was that Vaelish was secretly a wizard from [[Arcane Brotherhood]] who plotted to replace her and had engineered some of the troubles in the dale. Vaelish's plan was to kidnap Duvessa on election day and afterward propose himself as a stronger leader.\n\nDuvessa held the Bryn Shander speakership throughout [[Auril]]'s [[Everlasting Rime]] from [[1487 DR]] through [[1489 DR]]. During this time, she suspected the involvement of the Arcane Brotherhood in Icewind Dale's unnatural weather, and was willing to offer clemency to Vaelish in exchange for information about their activities in the region. In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]] she was at the council chamber when [[giant]]s attacked her city.",
        "Personality": "Duvessa inherited her mother's talent for negotiation and her father's charm. Some people thought her temerity but she always obtained what she wanted She believed that people of Ten Towns can survive all kinds of storms. Duvessa did not give an inch in any argument or conflict."
