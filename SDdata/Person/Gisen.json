        "mainbody": "Gisen, known in Kozakura as Kuang, was an exiled prince of Tu Lung in 1358 DR.\nGisen was born in the royal court of Tu Lung as the third son of the emperor, tutored by the great sword master Tong Fu Mei. \nOne day, during a sea trip disguised as a trader captain, he saved a girl from pirates and discovered after falling in love with her that she was the princess of Shou Lung, the eternal rival of Tu Lung. They loved each other in secret for some time until the traveling minstrel Tam Nong Hikong used their story as the subject of one of her songs. Soon, the Shou Emperor deduced the truth, the princess was exiled far away, and her eldest brother sent assassins against Gisen. Gisen escaped thanks to Tong and started wandering to Kozakura and Wa, hoping to find powerful allies for his cause.\nIn disguise as a young eastern physician, Kuang, he met Doin Sanehiro and The Wanderer just after the Battle of Kiroshima and became his companion in the fight against Jinchin.\nGisen was an impatient individual, always acting before thinking, and despite having his goal in mind he was terrible in the realization. However, he was charming, clever, and fanciful. Gisen had a talent for disguise. His biggest weakness was his arrogance."
