        "mainbody": "'''Curkon Gheldieg''' was Namarch on the [[Council of Six]] in [[Amn]] from [[1345 DR]] until his death in [[1362 DR]]. He was the Lord of [[House Gheldieg]] from [[1317 DR]] and before Namarch, he was the Iltarch from [[1333 DR|1333]]-1345.",
        "History": "Curkon had been a [[fighter]] by trade, but his success led him to become overindulgent and obese. He relied on being carried around by his servants. His main skill lay in his ability to tie together seemingly unrelated pieces of information to keep lesser houses down. This dealing in information involved a relationship with the [[Shadow Thieves]], but he was taken out by [[Rhinnom Dannihyr]], who shared similar talents.",
        "Relatives": "Curkon's daughter was [[Vyma Gheldieg]], and she controversially married [[Pehllus Tanislove]] soon after Curkon's death."
