        "mainbody": "aheira was a tasked artist genie serving the House of Al-Kamari in Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nJaheira dressed herself in the latest fashions of Huzuz, usually before they become popular with others.\nLike most artist genies, Jaheira was very sensitive about her work. Any criticism was enough to keep her from working for at least a week.\nJaherira performed all of the finest weaving done by the House of Al-Kamari. Since Al-Kamari were aware that happy artist genies produced greater works of art, anything she required for her creations was acquired without question."
