        "mainbody": "Aunrae Dhuurniv was the eldest of the Matron Sisters of House Dhuurniv involved in the Zhent invasion of Shadowdale in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR.\nAunrae was always the most diplomatic and administrative of the Matron sisters. It was Aunrae that first proposed the alliance with the Church of Shar to survive the fall of Maerimydra and later with the Zhentarim in order to reclaim the Twisted Tower of Ashaba. In 1375 DR, having achieved her objectives, Aunrae started to organize all the Maerimydra survivors into a great army at her service. Meanwhile she tried to create dissent between the Zhentilar and Sharrans and even approached the new Myth Drannor government. The goal of Aunrae was to start a civil war on the surface and use it to conquer all of Shadowdale for the drow, as it was in past centuries."
