Nabeirion was a high-ranking monk of Candlekeep.
Nabeirions duty was to always recite the Endless Chant of Alaundo.
In 1487 DR, Nabeirion, despite being saved from shadovar and Moonstars, would not agree to participate in Larlochs plan to rebuild the Weave. Despite his objections Elminster Aumar entered his mind, forcing Nabeirion to collaborate with Larloch.
