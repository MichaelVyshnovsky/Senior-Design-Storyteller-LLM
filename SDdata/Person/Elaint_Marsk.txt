Elaint Marsk was the heir of Marsk House in Melvaunt in 1374 DR.
Elaint was undergoing training at the Temple to Oghma in Melvaunt.
In 1374 DR, he was ordained as a cleric at the temple. However, secretly he met with his friends Argens Bruil, Kalman Leiyraghon, Kara Calaudra, and Oreal Nanther. They planned to go on adventure, with the support of the dwarf mercenary Dorn Crownshield.
They found a "treasure map" (in truth, a trap devised by Bremen Leiyraghon) and went to adventure in Thar, only to be captured by the orog Daazlag and his orc minions.
Elaint was imprisoned in a cave in XÃ»l-Jarak with all his friends. Elaint was waiting for the right time to escape using all his ready spells.
Elaint had a close relationship with Kara Calaudra, a thing that greatly worried his father Peuter Marsk.
