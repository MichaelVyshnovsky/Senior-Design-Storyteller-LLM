'''Kreston''' was a [[black dragon]] born in the [[Forest Country]]. He was the spawn of [[Casarial]] and [[Miranatol]], grandchild of [[Hesior]], and the blood of [[Thauglorimorgorus|Thauglorimorgorus the Black Doom]].

Impetuous like his mother, he made the mistake of interrupting his great-grandsire Thauglor's meal in {{Yearlink|-400}}.
