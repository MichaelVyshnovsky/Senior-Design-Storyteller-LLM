        "mainbody": "Lady Remallia Haventree () was Waterdhavian noblewoman and an agent of the Harpers during the late 15 century DR. She famously founded the Council of Waterdeep, a conciliary body that united the Five Factions of the Sword Coast against the emergent threat of the Cult of the Dragon during the 1480s DR.\nRemallia had distinctly bronze-colored skin. Despite her elven heritage, she had aged considerably during a few short decades in her life.\nShe dressed in elegant finery that included beauteous robes and non-ostentatious jewelry.\nLady Remallia was honest and friendly. She understood the threats that faced the Realms, but understood the caution of her fellow Harpers. She also agreed to compromise with lesser evils to fight more nefarious but not at all prices.\nNot one to open dialogue, Remi let others speak first before saying her piece.\nAmong her possessions was a large oil painting of her family, created before her husbands death some time during the mid—to—late 15 century.\nShe was rather fond of ticklemint tea, which she served in silver kettle with porcelain teacups.\nShe was at the very least proficient in divination magic.\nLady Remallia was married Arthagast Ulbrinter of the noble Ulbrinter family. Together they had two children Arthius, their son that lived in Silverymoon, and Serenore, their daughter that lived with her family on the island of Alaron in the Moonshaes.\nShe notably worked with Zehira Deryan, a protector of storm giant queen Serissa.\nthumb|right|300px|Lady Haventree was a skilled spellcaster.\nRemallia was a noble sun elf living in Waterdeep in Ulbrinter Villa, once the home of her husband Arthagast. At some point she joined the Harpers. \nDuring the 1480s DR, the Cult of the Dragon raided Ulbrinter Villa in search of a draconic artifact stolen by a Zhentarim agent, and killed Lord Arthagast. Lady Remallia took decisive action in response, methodically and purposefully dismantling the cults operations with all the resources at her disposal. She was the decisive force in uniting the Five Factions in the Council of Waterdeep, founded to combat the menace of the Cult of the Dragon. For her efforts she was chosen as the Harpers representative on the Council.\nLady Remallia then turned her attention towards the Cult of the Dragons onetime allies, the Red Wizards of Thay. She worked with her fellow Harpers and a group of adventurers to investigate a Red Wizard safehouse in Waterdeeps Dock Ward, then directed them to take information they recovered to Candlekeep for interpretation. A short time later, she was summoned to the Maelstrom by the storm giant queen Serissa.\nRemallias investigation led to the discovery of the Tenebrous Creed, a sect of Shar-worshiping cultists obsessed with the Far Realm, She worked with adventurers and Harpers in the Moonsea region to recover a living blade of disaster that was unearthed by the Red Wizards. Working with Zehira Deryan, Remallia directed the party to form a lookout post Abeiran necropolis of Xorvintroth deep underground in Icewind Dale,  and soon joined them in their efforts to spy on the Red Wizards. \nDuring her stay in the city, Remallia became afflicted with some unknown malady. She began to unknowingly harm herself, leaving wounds that created ichor-filled boils upon her skin. Despite this, she still managed to work with her adventurer allies to free the slaves the Red Wizards had made captive in Xorvintroth,\nIn the , the goddess Eilistraee returned to the Realms near the walls of Waterdeep. In turn many of the goddess drow followers traveled to the City of Splendors en masse. Some of their numbers approached Remallia and requested aid in constructing a temple of Eilistraee in the city. Lady Remallia agreed to provide her support to their cause."
