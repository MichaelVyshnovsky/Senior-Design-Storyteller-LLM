Though he didn't ask for much, what he sought, combined with what every other noble did, would not only gut the [[Writ]], it would have granted them more power than prior to it.\n\nAfter the Council of the Dragoncame under attack, Kreskur noticed the [[blueflame ghost]] attacking. He cried out that it was a new one, strongly implying he knew of the ones that had been spotted before.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|94|10}}"
