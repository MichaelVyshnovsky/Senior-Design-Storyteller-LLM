        "mainbody": "'''Arathis Hune''' was the first main lieutenant within [[Jarlaxle]]'s [[Bregan D'aerthe]] in the early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Arathis hailed from [[House Hune]] in [[Menzoberranzan]]. However, his house was destroyed and a few Hune nobles, among them Arathis, survived. In time, most of them joined [[House Ozzl]] but Arathis had previously killed a noble of that house and was forbidden to join the new [[House Ozzl'Hune]]. At one point, Jarlaxle met and befriended Arathis, who in time became the main lieutenant of the rising Bregan D'aerthe.\n\nIn 1018 DR, Arathis and Jarlaxle were hired by matron mother [[Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin]] to deliver the weapon master of [[House Simfray]], [[Zaknafein]], to Matron [[Malice Do'Urden|Malice]] of [[House Do'Urden]]. They used an attack from [[House Tr'arach]] as cover to infiltrate the Simfray compound. Arathis had a mission to kill most of the Simfray priestesses and to recruit as many males as possible from both the Simfray and Tr'arach forces. At the end of the mission, Arathis had saved around forty members of the two Houses, including many warriors, two mages, and a priestess. Around half of them decided to join Bregan D'aerthe.\n\nAfter some time, Arathis went to [[Ched Nasad]] together with Jarlaxle and the temporarily recruited Zaknafein to kill Matron Mother [[Sheeva Zauvirr]] of [[House Zauvirr]], who had outraged Matron Mother [[Yvonnel Baenre]].\n\nIn the years between 1018 and [[1118 DR]] while Jarlaxle remained in Menzoberranzan dealing with matron mothers, Arathis took care of the missions outside the city, quite often assassination works in Ched Nasad, but was not too happy about it.\n\nIn [[1118 DR]] Arathis discussed with Jarlaxle the duel between Zaknafein and [[Duvon Tr'arach]] and he decided to secretly ask the help of [[Quavylene Oblodra]] to sabotage Zak.\n\nThe cheating however went bad thanks to Jarlaxle's prudence; Afterwards, with the help of [[Dab'nay Tr'arach]], Arathis was ambushed by Zak and after a long fight the weapon master defeated the rogue assassin until the arrive of Jarlaxle that stopped the two and again proposed to resolve the matter with a fair duel. The matter was instead resolved with Arathis doing a long job in Ched Nasad. However just returned in city in [[1119 DR]] Arathis and Zaknafien were both called in a isolate spot and there were attacked by a [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]] war party led by [[Uthegentel Del'Armgo]]. They partnered and managed to kill most of the Armgo warriors, but not Uthegentel, when suddenly they restarted their fighting because was Arathis himself that had conspired with the Armgo together with Dab'nay in order to kill Zak. Zaknafein however was the cleverest and expected the betrayal and finally managed to kill the assassin but spare Dab'nay.",
        "Personality": "He liked fishing. Arathis was knowledgeable about [[halfling]]s.",
        "Relationship": "Arathis considered Jarlaxle to be like a brother and his boss had the same feeling. He knew many of Jarlaxle's secrets. He greatly disliked Zaknafein, fearing that he would become his substitute and considering his behavior strange.\n\nArathis was the grandfather of [[Valas Hune]].\n\nIn [[1118 DR]] he divided the bed with [[Quavylene Oblodra]].",
        "Weapons": "Arathis possessed a quite large crossbow, a very unusual weapon for a drow."
