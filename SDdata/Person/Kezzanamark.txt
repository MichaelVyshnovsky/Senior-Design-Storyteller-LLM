'''Kezzanamark''' was an [[Dragon aging|adult]] [[red dragon]] that gained fame by killing a [[wizard]] and a blacksmith of some renown, [[Darnarest]] the Bladesmith in [[1303 DR]].

==Personality==
Like many of his red dragon brethren, Kezzanamark was cruel, petty, proud, vengeful, and greedy.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1303}}, a group of witless adventurers emboldened by the new enchanted weapons. The "heroes" proudly challenged the wyrm bragging of the weaponry crafted by Darnarest himself that was to bring Kezzanamark's death. Needless to say, the adventurers were quickly dispatched by the dragon's fiery breath. Angered by the foolishness, Kezzanamark embarked on the quest of finding Darnarest. Eventually, the red dragon found [[Darnarest's tower]] and its owner. The dragon and the wizard clashed in a fierce aerial battle which resulted in Darnarest being bit in half. Kezzanamark melted the tower, and scattered its remnants searching for the wizard's treasures. The search was unsuccessful and Kezzanamark departed for the part unknown.
