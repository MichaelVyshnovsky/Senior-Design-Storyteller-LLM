}}'''Shoshara''' was a priestess of [[Eilistraee]] in [[Shilmista]].

==History==
In [[1377 DR]], she was arguing with [[Glorst]], a former priest of [[Vhaeraun]], about which of their gods had absorbed the other in their duel in [[1375 DR]], when they were approached by [[Halisstra Melarn]]. Glorst tried to kill her but was defeated. Later Halisstra interrogated Shoshara about the current situation and the location of [[Cavatina Xarann]]. However, Shoshara distrusted her and refused her aid, despite Halisstra's suffering. So, at last feeling betrayed by Eilistraee, Halisstra killed Shoshara.
