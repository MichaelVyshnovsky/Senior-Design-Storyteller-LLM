        "mainbody": "Chanragoupta was a Netherese arcanist and merchant who operated Chanragouptas Exotic in Eileanar until its destruction in .\nChanragoupta traveled Faer√ªn in search of exotic textiles for his shop. He also bought up any fabrics brought back by the spelljammers of Yeomans Loft, making him the sole supplier of these rare fabrics from Realmspace and other planes.\nChanragoupta managed to catch the prolific thief Cadogen during an attempted robbery, and intended to have him hanged at dawn the next day. Cadogen used his roguish skills to not only slip his bonds, but seduced Chanragouptas wife Valleria, and escaped with her. With the situation posed as a kidnapping for ransom, Chanragoupta paid the demanded 20,000 gp, though she never returned. Despite fearing that she had been killed, he maintained a standing 5,000 gp reward for her safe return afterwards."
