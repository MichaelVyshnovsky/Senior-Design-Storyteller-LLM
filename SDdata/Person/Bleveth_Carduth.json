        "mainbody": "Bleveth Carduth was a merchant that specialized in swords for hire. He was also one of the nine founding members of the crime syndicate known as the Great Goblet, and a member in good standing as of the Year of the Tankard 1370 DR.\nBleveth was a tall, stocky, and very imposing figure. He often spoke loudly and aggressively, but his eyes remained cold and calculating.\nCarduth had a very suspicious nature and few, if any, friends. He was preoccupied with having multiple escape routes, cover stories, and fallback schemes. He also set up diversions to deflect attention away from his business interests. He never went out in public without multiple bodyguards, both obvious and under cover.\nBleveth had an eidetic memory when it came to names, faces, and words spoken within his range of hearing.\nCarduth, like all of the Lords of the Goblet, kept a golden goblet that held a dried finger or toe that once belonged to Halonidas Dreie&mdashthe arrogant and presumptuous wizard whose assassination was the inceptive event in the forming of the Great Goblet&mdashas a warning against backstabbing among the leadership.\nBy the 1370s DR, Bleveth had spent over twenty years making his fortune hiring reliable mercenaries, bodyguards, and caravan guards for clients in Elturel. He was expanding his business to other towns when he fell in with the merchant cabal in Scornubel that eventually became the Great Goblet. He then focused on being a high profile and legitimate moneylender, but still stealthily arranged security for clients nervous enough to come to him and pay his fee, based on his reputation.\nHe had an extensive spy network that operated mainly in Elturel and Scornubel, and he was well-informed about most of the activity in those two cities.\nDuring the 1350s and 1360s DR, he was dogged by recurring rumors that alleged he was involved in kidnapping and slave-trading, but the allegations were never proven."
