==Rumors & Legends==
One trick by [[Marlin Stormserpent]] had someone accuse Harmond Hawklin, alongside [[Rothglar Illance]] and [[Seszgar Huntcrown]], of plotting to unleash a ball of [[spellplague]] from a chest somehow during the [[Council of the Dragon]]. The rumor reached [[Ganrahast Aeiulvana]], Royal Magician of [[Cormyr]]; he did not know quite what to do with it.
