Chezzara was a drow priestess of Eilistraee in the Misty Forest in 1375 DR.
Chezzara was one of the priestesses of the Misty Forest. She was a powerful healer, knowing well the resurrection spell.
Chezzara resurrected Rowaan Vrinn after her death at the hands of a large group of driders.
She later tried to resurrect Rowaan again after she was killed by a nightshadow of Vhaeraun, but with her soul stolen it was impossible for Chezzara to fulfill this the task.
