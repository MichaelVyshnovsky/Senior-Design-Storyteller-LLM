        "mainbody": "'''Rogering Pegleg''' was a [[drow]] from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Rogering Pegleg was a man with long white hair who wore [[light armor]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a large group of [[duergar]], [[giant spider]]s, and drow, was slaughtered in the home of a [[Bloomridge Park]] groundskeeper, [[Lavernica]]. The murder spree was performed by [[Orin the Red]] and her [[Murder Tribunal]] of [[Bhaal]]. Rogering Pegleg's slaughtered body was found in a cellar underneath Lavernica's home, near a butchered drow woman, a grotesque display â€“ an effigy representing [[Sendai]], a drow [[Bhaalspawn]] who died a century earlier."
