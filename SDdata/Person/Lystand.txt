'''Lystand''', also known as '''Lystand the Pick''', was a [[thief]] in [[Skullport]] in the mid-14{{th}} century DR.

==Description==
Lystand operated [[Delver's Folly]]. With her background in designing and bypassing intricate security systems, Lystand specialized in crafting traps that were as lethal as they are difficult to disarm. Her poison gas and dart traps, in particular, were infamous for their complexity.
==History==
Before moving to Skullport, she was an [[adventurer]] in [[Waterdeep]].
