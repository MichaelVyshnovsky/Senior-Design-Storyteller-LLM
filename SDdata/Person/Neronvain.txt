'''Neronvain''' was the [[green dragon|Green]] [[Wyrmspeaker]] of the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] that attacked the [[Misty Forest]] during the late 1480s [[DR]].

==History==
Neronvain was the [[elf|elven]] prince of the Misty Forest, son of the king [[Melandrach]]; he had a terrible relationship with his father for the cautious mood of the king. After a very fierce discussion Neronvain was exiled. After he joined the Cult of the Dragon and became the companion of the green dragon [[Chuth]], he rose in rank. In the late 1480s DR, he was selected as the Green Dragon Wyrmspeaker; he guided a series of raids in the Misty Forest in order to gain treasures for a treasure hoard intended to summon [[Tiamat]] into the [[Prime Material plane]]. At last he was eventually defeated by a band of adventurers.
