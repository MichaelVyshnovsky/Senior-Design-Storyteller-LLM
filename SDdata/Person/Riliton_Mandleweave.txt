Riliton Mandleweave was a powerful invoker who used her arcane prowess to the defend of her home of Hlondeth in 146 DR.
Riliton Mandleweave learned her impressive skills to weave spells from a renowned wizard Charas of Winterwood. She earned her place by defending the city of Hlondeth in the siege of . The siege was the second attempt to claim the city by the ambitious and militaristic leader of Turmish, Lord Dempster Turmish. He did not plan the siege accordingly and was stumped by Hlondeths high walls, and his forces were held at bay by Riliton Mandleweaves barrage of spells. As she handled the enemys forces upfront, the Company of the Howling Harpoon flanked the army and destroyed Dempster Turmishs siege machinery, food, and other supplies. The siege was a failure, and Turmite armies were turned around.
