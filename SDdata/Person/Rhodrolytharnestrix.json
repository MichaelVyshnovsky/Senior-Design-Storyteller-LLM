        "mainbody": "hodrolytharnestrix, also known as the Tyrant of Tyrants, was the dragon ruler of Laerakond in the late years of the 13th century DR.\nRhodrolytharnestrix was bigger and more powerful than normal red dragons.\nAt some point prior the 13th century DR, Rhodrolytharnestrix unearthed powerful magic items from primordial tombs and defeated all the other dragon lords of Laerakond, becoming their de facto ruler.\nDuring the dragonborn rebellion that led to the foundation of Tymanchebar, circa 1279 DR, the dragonborn heroes Iskdara, Shurideh, Reshvemi, and Thuchir infiltrated the Celestial Mountain, a dormant volcano where Rhodrolytharnestrix had his lair, and opened a tunnel to the lava chambers using the Breath of Petron, while the rest of the dragonborn leaders led their war bands against Rhodrolytharnestrixs dragon army. Inside the volcano, the heroes dropped the Eye of Blazing Rorn into the volcano, triggering an eruption so powerful that it killed Rhodrolytharnestrix, even though he was a red dragon. This battle was later known as the Battle of the Crippled Mountain.\nA fresco depicting the Battle of the Crippled Mountain and Rhodrolytharnestrixs demise was displayed in the main hall of Clan Verthisathurgieshs enclave in Djerad Thymar."
