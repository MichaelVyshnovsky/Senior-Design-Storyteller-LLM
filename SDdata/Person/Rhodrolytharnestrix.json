        "mainbody": "'''Rhodrolytharnestrix''', also known as the '''Tyrant of Tyrants''', was the [[dragon]] ruler of [[Laerakond]] in the late years of the 13th century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Rhodrolytharnestrix was bigger and more powerful than normal [[red dragon]]s.",
        "History": "At some point prior the 13th century [[DR]], Rhodrolytharnestrix unearthed powerful [[magic item]]s from [[primordial]] tombs and defeated all the other dragon lords of Laerakond, becoming their ''de facto'' ruler.\n\nDuring the [[dragonborn rebellion]] that led to the foundation of [[Tymanchebar]], circa [[1279 DR]], the [[dragonborn]] heroes [[Iskdara]], [[Shurideh]], [[Reshvemi]], and [[Thuchir]] infiltrated the [[Crippled Mountain|Celestial Mountain]], a dormant volcano where Rhodrolytharnestrix had his lair, and opened a tunnel to the lava chambers using the [[Breath of Petron]], while the rest of the dragonborn leaders led their war bands against Rhodrolytharnestrix's dragon army. Inside the volcano, the heroes dropped the [[Eye of Blazing Rorn]] into the volcano, triggering an eruption so powerful that it killed Rhodrolytharnestrix, even though he was a red dragon. This battle was later known as the [[Battle of the Crippled Mountain]].",
        "Legacy": "A fresco depicting the Battle of the Crippled Mountain and Rhodrolytharnestrix's demise was displayed in the main hall of [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]]'s enclave in [[Djerad Thymar]]."
