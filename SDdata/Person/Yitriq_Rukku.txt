Yitriq Rukku was a barbarian  and a qaghan of the city of Haxkhun on the Plain of Horses and a member of the Fankiang tribe circa . He was subordinate to the rulers of Li-Raz.Although Haxkhun is said to be divided in two and to have two qaghan, only Rukku is presented, and it is not apparent which half he leads.
A cruel and cowardly tyrant, Rukku was nevertheless snivelling and obsequious to his masters in Li-Raz, doing whatever they commanded. Privately, he resented them for Haxkhuns second-class status amongst the Fankiang tribe, but he wasnt about to oppose them. Although he was an incompetent administrator, he was easily controlled by leaders in Li-Raz and so they tolerated and supported him.
He was heavily overweight and rarely looked directly at people.
Rukku held and competed in weekly horse-wrestling contests in Haxkhun. In these, the aim was to wrestle ones horse to the ground before the other. However, these were blatantly fixed to eliminate opponents and dissidents, as well as fatten Rukkus ego. First, he selected his opponents, posting their names only the day before a match. If that person refused to compete, then his family was executed. If that person lost, then he was executed. And since Rukku had his horse made lame before each match, he never lost.
