        "mainbody": "Olen Argent was a champion of good who lived in the years before the Era of Upheaval.\nHe was said to have been especially eloquent in his manner of speech.\nOlen owned a magnificent suit of enchanted chainmail armor, which was gifted to him by his elven friends. It was worn many years later by his descendants.\nOlen was the grandfather of the Lathanderite paladin Aun Argent, and the great-grandfather of Auns niece Caelar.\nAt some point in his life, Olen embarked upon a quest to hunt down a malevolent cult dedicated to the Beastlord Malar. When he traveled into the Misty Forest he encountered a group of elves, who mistook Olen for a threat.\nOlen spoke his peace in such an articulate manner that the elves helped him track down the Malarites. He then proceeded to cut down every last member of the cult, as justice for their killing spree."
