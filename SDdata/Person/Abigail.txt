Abigail was a follower of Gond who worked at the High House of Wonders in Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR.
Abigail was absolutely enamored with the inventions dreamt up and created by her fellow Gondar devotees.
Both of Abigails parents were alive for much of her life. She had at least one sibling, a brother named Benji who was a member of the Emerald Enclave.
At some point, Abigail wrote a letter to Benji imploring him to come visit her at the High House in Baldurs Gate.
