        "mainbody": "revindon Margaster was a member of House Margaster in the late 15 century DR.\nIn 1488 DR, Regis was informed by one of his informants that Brevindon Margaster had gone to the North during winter and stopped at a stable near the Driftwood Tavern near Neverwinter.\nSome time later, Brevindon Margaster headed for the Sword Coast with a pirate flotilla composed of humans, goblinoids, and even gnolls with the objective to attack Luskan. Brevindons fleet easily sacked Port Llast.\nAfter his takeover of Luskan, Brevindon proclaimed himself the new High Captain of Ship Kurth and all the others High Captains submitted to him. Brevindon took residence inside the Ship Kurth compound but Wulfgar, Kimmuriel Oblodra, and Bonnie Charlee planned to infiltrate the place and kill Brevindon and Asbeel.\nBrevindon and Asbeel were fused together and while Kimmuriel provided psychic support, Wulfgar engaged the man/demon and by surprise Bonnie threw away the demonic phylactery that the barbarian destroyed. Thanks to this, Kimmuriel managed to banish Asbeel from Brevindons body and the exhausted man surrendered.\nBrevindon was the brother of Lady Inkeri Margaster."
