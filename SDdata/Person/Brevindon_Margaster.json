        "mainbody": "'''Brevindon Margaster''' was a member of [[House Margaster]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In [[1488 DR]], [[Regis]] was informed by one of his informants that Brevindon Margaster had gone to the [[North]] during winter and stopped at a stable near the [[Driftwood Tavern]] near [[Neverwinter]].\n\nSome time later, Brevindon Margaster headed for the [[Sword Coast]] with a pirate flotilla composed of [[human]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, and even [[gnoll]]s with the objective to attack [[Luskan]]. Brevindon's fleet easily sacked [[Port Llast]].\n\nAfter his takeover of Luskan, Brevindon proclaimed himself the new High Captain of [[Ship Kurth]] and all the others High Captains submitted to him. Brevindon took residence inside the Ship Kurth compound but [[Wulfgar]], [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]], and [[Bonnie Charlee]] planned to infiltrate the place and kill Brevindon and [[Asbeel]].\n\nBrevindon and Asbeel were fused together and while Kimmuriel provided psychic support, Wulfgar engaged the man/demon and by surprise Bonnie threw away the demonic [[phylactery]] that the barbarian destroyed. Thanks to this, Kimmuriel managed to banish Asbeel from Brevindon's body and the exhausted man surrendered.",
        "Relationship": "Brevindon was the brother of Lady [[Inkeri Margaster]]."
