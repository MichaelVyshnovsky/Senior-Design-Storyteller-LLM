Moog was a lonely hill giant sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Moog lived in a decrepit old tower somewhere near the Dessarin Valley where she wallowed in self-pity.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Chief Guh took Moogs husband, Hruk as her own, like many others. This event destroyed Moog.
