The '''Gorgotaur''' was a [[tauric]] [[gorgon]] who led the [[Cult of the Labyrinth]] in the [[Northdark]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He claimed to be a child of the [[demon lord]] [[Baphomet]].[http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=9189 According to author Eric L. Boyd], the article in [[Dragon magazine 355|''Dragon'' #355]] originally included a stat block for the Gorgotaur, but this was cut prior to publication. Notably, the Gorgotaur's other tauric half was supposed to be [[minotaur]], and his alignment was supposed to be chaotic evil.

==Personality==
He was a notably ruthless leader who pushed his cultists past the brink of exhaustion.

==Activities==
Under the Gorgotaur's leadership, the Cult of the Labyrinth launched numerous raids on [[drow]] and [[duergar]] merchants traveling between [[Menzoberranzan]] and [[Gracklstugh]].
