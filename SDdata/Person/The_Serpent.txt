'''The Serpent''' was a female [[fox hengeyokai]] [[yakuza]] and [[ninja]] and the shadowy leader of the [[Phoenix clan]] ninja in [[Nakamaru]] in [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR|Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR)]]. She was also a low-ranked member of the [[Black Mist]] yakuza gang.

==Activities==
Very little was known about the Serpent, not her appearance nor her race, for she remained behind a gauze or ''[[shoji]]'' screen when she held meetings with the Phoenix clan. They could only rumor about her beauty. None knew that she was a [[hengeyokai]], nor that she was also a member of the Black Mist. She walked freely in public, without any disguise, being confident that nobody knew her true appearance.

==Personality==
It was known that the Serpent was physically powerful, as well as capricious, strong-willed, and without mercy. She also loved dogs.

==Possessions==
In combat, she wielded a ''[[katana]] +3'' or a quality-made [[parang]], and had a dozen quality [[arrow]]s, while she wore ''[[leather armor]] of [[healing (armor quality)|healing]] +1''. She was also equipped with a ''[[wand of enemy detection]]'' and a ''[[potion of fire resistance]]''.
