'''Halonya''' was the teenaged prophetess of [[Tchazzar]] and his high priestess. Although she was Tchazzar's proclaimed high priestess, she was incapable of casting divine magic.

Halonya was jealous of [[Jhesrhi Coldcreek]] and often whispered derogatory comments to Tchazzar behind Jhesrhi's back. After Tchazzar was slain during the [[Battle of Luthcheq]], Halonya went to the building used as Tchazzar's temple and attempted to convince the priests to leave with her. Instead, the priests killed Halonya.	

==Appearance==
Halonya was very thin and had an acne-scarred face. After her elevation to high priestess of the [[Cult of Tchazzar]], she began wearing ridiculously elaborate red robes.
