Halonya was the teenaged prophetess of Tchazzar and his high priestess. Although she was Tchazzars proclaimed high priestess, she was incapable of casting divine magic.
Halonya was jealous of Jhesrhi Coldcreek and often whispered derogatory comments to Tchazzar behind Jhesrhis back. After Tchazzar was slain during the Battle of Luthcheq, Halonya went to the building used as Tchazzars temple and attempted to convince the priests to leave with her. Instead, the priests killed Halonya.	
Halonya was very thin and had an acne-scarred face. After her elevation to high priestess of the Cult of Tchazzar, she began wearing ridiculously elaborate red robes.
