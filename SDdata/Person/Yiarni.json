        "mainbody": "Yiarni was an adult crystal dragon of the Thunder Peaks of Cormyr in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nShe kept her lair within the northern Thunder Peaks, which were cool enough to support but one gem dragon.\nShe was exceptionally kind and gentle-hearted, and very different from most crystal dragons reputations.\nWhile Yiarnis exact goals within the Thunder Peaks were unknown, the dragon would spend some of her time sharing her wealth of knowledge with local scholars and helping travelers in distress, provided they promised not to reveal her location to others. She also met with young white dragons that traveled within her territory, in hopes of tempering their naturally cruel dispositions into friendlier personalities.\nYiarni was acquainted with the sage Nibulus Loral and spoke a little with him. Nibulus believed Yiarni to be an acquaintance of the gold dragon Tarlacoal, who also dwelled in the Thunder Peaks, and that they were working together on something around the year 1367 DR.\nShe was still alive after the Dracorage of 1373 DR."
