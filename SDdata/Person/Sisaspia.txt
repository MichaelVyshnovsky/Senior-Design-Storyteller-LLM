'''Sisaspia''' was a [[yuan-ti pureblood]] [[druid]] and [[adventurer]] from the [[Chult]]an city of [[Omu]].

==Description==
Sisaspia had black hair streaked through with gray, and dressed herself in green robes and golden jewelry. She enjoyed drawing, viewing the practice as a valuable means to examine her foes. Sisaspia spoke with exaggerated "s" sounds, betraying her [[yuan-ti]] heritage.

==Personality==
Having little interest in money or fame, Sisaspia's primary motivation was to increase her power. She viewed adventuring as a means through which she could test and refine her harmful spores. She was an adherent of [[Dendar]].

==Abilities==
She constantly surrounded herself with a halo of necrotic spores, infecting anyone in close proximity. The spores would harm her enemies slowly over time, but she could also force them to grow rapidly to tear foes apart from the inside. Furthermore, she could use her spores to heal allies. Sisaspia frequently used the [[spell]] ''[[Blight (spell)|blight]]'' in combat.

==Possessions==
Sisaspia carried her collection of fungi with her everywhere. In combat she wielded a scepter shaped like a serpent as well as a [[scimitar]]. She wore a ring shaped like two serpents devouring each other; a symbol of Dendar. She had two [[yellow musk creeper|yellow musk]] [[zombie]] pets: a [[grung]] and a [[rabbit]] named [[Flopsy]].

==History==
She was exiled from the larger yuan-ti community of Omu.
