He had 26 subpriests and 48 lay-worshipers.\n\nPriests of Torm ran [[Calispar Delgorth]], a poison-dealing priest of [[Talona]], out of the city early in [[1367 DR|the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]]. When Calispar later dealt with the [[Shadowkind]] [[assassin]]s in [[1369 DR|the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], he asked them to assassinate the high priest.{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}} <ref group=\"note\">The high priest is unnamed but presumed to be Pallar the Obedient due to the close dates. As this is an adventure module and the attack is contingent upon a successful demonstration of Calispar's magic-resistant poison, which may be interrupted by player characters, the attack may not necessarily have gone ahead."
