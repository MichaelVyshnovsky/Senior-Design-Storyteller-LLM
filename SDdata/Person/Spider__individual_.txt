Spider was a delivery boy in the Lower Port of Skullport.
Spider was overconfident, brash, and arrogant.
Spider, a name he chose for himself, was a street child of Skullport, not knowing anything about his heritage. In time, he discovered that he was very good at climbing and took work as a delivery boy with his ability. By 1370 DR, he founded Spiders Fleet o Feet and started wondering about his origins discovering himself not to be a half-elf, like he had always thought.
