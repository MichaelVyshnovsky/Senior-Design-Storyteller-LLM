        "mainbody": "Barthelby was a high-ranking priest of Jergal in Undermountain in 1479 DR.\nIn 1479 DR, an omen reveled that some tombs holy to Jergal inside Undermountain had been forgotten and needed to be tended. Barthelby led an expedition to Waterdeep in order to rededicate them to Jergal. After a search in Waterdeeps libraries, he and his fellows identified the locations of the tombs and entered Undermountain to do their work and also build a shrine to their god.\nBarthelby was waiting for another priest to relieve him but instead the undead minions of the vampire Dayan attacked. Barthelby barricaded himself inside the shrine.\nLike all his fellow priests of Jergal, Barthelby was morose. He believed that one day he would die in a horrible way but tried to not think about it. However, he was very scrupulous in his work.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryPriests and priestesses\nCategoryWorshipers of Jergal\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\npobfw1ez5fb817jq3s4o99yzinnq8rn"
