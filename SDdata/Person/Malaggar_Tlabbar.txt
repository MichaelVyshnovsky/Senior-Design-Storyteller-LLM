Malaggar Tlabbar was a drow of House Faen Tlabbar, the fourth house of Menzoberranzan and head instructor of Melee-Magthere.
Malaggar was the First Sword of Melee-Magthere in 1372 DR and so the nominal head of the martial school. In that year, he coordinated with Matron Quenthel Baenre and the heads of the other schools to use their students to quell a slave uprising plotted by Syrzan.
