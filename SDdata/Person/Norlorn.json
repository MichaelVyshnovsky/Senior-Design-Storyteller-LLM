        "mainbody": "'''Noldorn''' was an [[elf]] [[wraith]] guarding the Sacred Vale in [[Cormanthor]] in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He was a wispy white shadow, trailing off into smoke below the waist.",
        "Personality": "Noldorn had grown rather aggressive about protecting the Vale. He showed concern that his fellow, [[Elaethan]], was becoming more like the men by scrying on their minds.",
        "Abilities": "He was largely unaffected by spells that destroyed undead, or even ''[[chain lightning]]''. Amongst other things, Noldorn could create barriers of force, almost certainly through ''[[wall of force]]'', and he could unmake [[mage-killer]] creatures.",
        "Activities": "He was a guardian of the [[Sacred Vale]].",
        "Relationships": "One of his fellow guardians was named Elaethan.",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|241}}, Noldorn arrived at the scene after [[Elminster Aumar]] escaped [[Heldebran]]; he mistook Elminster for an elf, due to him being transformed and wearing a ''[[kiira]]''. He ultimately left Heldebran at the mercy of his own [[mage-killer]], slaying him and then the mage-killer itself. Later he'd remark that Elaethan was thinking too much like a human."
