He showed concern that his fellow, Elaethan, was becoming more like the men by scrying on their minds.\nHe was largely unaffected by spells that destroyed undead, or even chain lightning. Amongst other things, Noldorn could create barriers of force, almost certainly through wall of force, and he could unmake mage-killer creatures.\nHe was a guardian of the Sacred Vale.\nOne of his fellow guardians was named Elaethan.\nIn , Noldorn arrived at the scene after Elminster Aumar escaped Heldebran he mistook Elminster for an elf, due to him being transformed and wearing a kiira. He ultimately left Heldebran at the mercy of his own mage-killer, slaying him and then the mage-killer itself. Later hed remark that Elaethan was thinking too much like a human."
