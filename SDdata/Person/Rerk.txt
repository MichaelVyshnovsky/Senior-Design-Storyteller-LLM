Rerk was a farm hand in the Kabels Hills community in the Quivering Forest near Phlan in 1489 DR. 
In 1489 DR, he and five other men went inside the forest to recover Halvin Graingle before he disturbed the feys. However, they were too late because the hag Jeny Greenteeth had killed him. Rerk and his fellows found their way to the hag.
Some days later, Jeny returned to Kabels Hill and nailed Rerk to the towns signpost with one of her hairpins. The hag cut out his tongue and replaced his eyes with polished jet stones. An adventuring party happened to be there and tried to save Rerk.
