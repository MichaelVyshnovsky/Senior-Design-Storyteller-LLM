'''Vernon Braig''' was the proprietor of the [[Blue Clam]] tavern, in the town of [[Termalaine]], during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
In addition to managing the tavern, Vernon worked as its chef. Vernon was known for making delectable spiced chowder for the Clam's patrons, but occasionally had roasted meat in thanks to local hunters and trappers.
