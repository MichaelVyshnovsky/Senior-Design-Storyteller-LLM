Vernon Braig was the proprietor of the Blue Clam tavern, in the town of Termalaine, during the late 15 century DR.
In addition to managing the tavern, Vernon worked as its chef. Vernon was known for making delectable spiced chowder for the Clams patrons, but occasionally had roasted meat in thanks to local hunters and trappers.
