        "mainbody": "Kaitlynn was a mystic of the Earthmother and a shopkeeper in Skullport.\nKaitlynn was born with Anithlynn and Briglynn on board a Moonshae Isles ship to a mystic of the Earthmother, Celya, who lost most of her energy in childbirth. The triplets were taught from birth the mysteries of mystics. By their thirteenth birthday, Celya had died.\nIn 1379 DR her friend Laeral Silverhand went with the then-immaterial Darksong Knight Cavatina Xarann to met Kaitlynn and thank to her healed Cavatina. \nKaitlynn was the middle of the triplets and the most responsible, always mediating between the capricious Anithlynn and the sometimes-sullen Briglynn. At heart, she was, like their mother Celya, compassionate and utterly devoted to the Earthmother. Kaitlynn was also kind and charitable.\nKaitlynn managed with her sisters the Sisters Three Waxworks. She was very capable of making non-magical love potions."
