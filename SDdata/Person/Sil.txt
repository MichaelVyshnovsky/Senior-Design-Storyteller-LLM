'''Sil''' was a [[sirine]] matriarch that lived on the [[Sword Coast]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|I tell you now that this is our living-land, and you are not welcome! You will return whence you came while you are still able!}}

==Personality==
Unlike other sirines that were often high-spirited and exuberant, Sil was rather defensive and ready to defend her tribe's home at the slightest provocation.

==Abilities==
She could make herself ''[[Greater invisibility|invisible]]'' and had the power to make others ''[[dire charm|go into a furious rage]]'' and attempt to slay anyone nearby.

==Relationships==
Sil led a small tribe of sirines that included at least two others of her kind.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Sil and her tribe relocated to a beach on the Sword Coast just north of the [[Seawatcher]] lighthouse, claiming it as their "living-land". As they claimed the territory the sirines managed to sink the boat of a [[Cordyr|local fisherman]].
