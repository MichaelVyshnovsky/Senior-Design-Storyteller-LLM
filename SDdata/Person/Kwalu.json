        "mainbody": "''Negus'' (Prince) '''Kwalu''' was the son of King [[Osaw I]] and a member of the ''[[bara]]e'', the seven \"super-paladins\" sworn to protect the holy city of [[Mezro]] in [[Chult]] before its destruction during the [[Spellplague]].",
        "Description": "Kwalu was a handsome man. He had square features and deep eyes. He often dressed in a [[tobe]] of purple that had green triangles around his heart.\n\nIn the 1360s DR, Kwalu was over 100 years old, yet, like all ''barae'', he was immortal.",
        "Personality": "Kwalu had a very intense personality and took very seriously his role of protector of Mezro. He admired true bravery.",
        "Abilities": "Like all ''barae'', Kwalu had been granted special powers from [[Ubtao]], which included the following:\n* He could utter magical [[command]]s that would compel the hearer to obedience.\n* He [[regenerate]]d health rapidly.\n* He could [[detect evil]] at will.\n* He had improved reflexes and physical and mental resistances.\n\nIf within the [[Temple of Ubtao]], he could also cast the following spells:\n* ''[[Cure critical wounds]]''\n* ''[[Forbiddance]]''\n* ''[[Remove blindness or deafness]]''\n* ''[[Remove disease]]''\n* ''[[Restoration]]''\n* ''[[True seeing]]''\n\nIn addition, Kwalu possessed the terrifying power to control vast swarms of locusts. Provided he had a single locust to begin with, he could summon a cloud of the insects more than 200 yards (180 meters) in width that would consume anything in their path.",
        "Possessions": "Kwalu never went anywhere without being armed. His weapon of choice was usually his ''[[kerrie]]'', or war club. It was pitted from having cracked so many [[Batiri]] skulls.",
        "Relationships": "The youngest of the ''barae'', the young girl named [[Fipya]], looked up to Kwalu as if he were her older brother."
