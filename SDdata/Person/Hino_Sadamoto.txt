Hino Sadamoto was the head of Hino clan in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
Sadamoto was often drunk, sleeping until late in morning. A life of dissolution and evil living had reduced him to a hollow husk.
In 1357 sadamoto became heavily indebted with the Worthless Flower yakuza gang. Knowing that Sadamoto difficulty can repair his debts the yakuza planned to eventually sell their note on Sadamoto to another for the right price. Both Funada Mitsuhide and Funada Toyoo were moderately interested about
Sadamoto was a nervous and twitchy individual prone to sudden fits of temper. He had few friends remaining.
