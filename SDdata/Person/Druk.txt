{{Quote|Another outsider come to see the [[Dror Ragzlin|boss]]? Mind yer manners, now â€“ or he'll throw ya in the pit|Druk.}}

==Personality==
He was fairly well-mannered for a goblin, at least to those that were favored by [[the Absolute]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Druk remained at the [[Shattered Sanctum]] when the leaders of the Shattered Sanctum began the hunt for certain individuals that were previously on the crashed [[nautiloid]] that landed near the [[River Chionthar]].
