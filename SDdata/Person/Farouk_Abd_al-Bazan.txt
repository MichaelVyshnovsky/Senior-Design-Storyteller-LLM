Farouk Abd al-Bazan was an efreeti and leader of the Sword Dancers sect of the Everlasting in 1367 DR.
Contrary to most of his kind, Farouk was extremely charismatic. His personality drew many followers to the Sword Dancers.
Through the use of his shapechanging ability, Farouk appeared as a handsome man in his mid-twenties. In that form, he had dark green eyes and brown hair.
Farouks ultimate goal was to lead the Everlasting. Those within the fortress of Sarahin knew him to be a sorcerer of wind and flame and not an efreeti.
Farouk wore an amulet of proof against detection and location that disguised his true nature from hakimas and shairs. He also owned a staff of the sands.
