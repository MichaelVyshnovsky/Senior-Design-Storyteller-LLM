'''Barachiel''' ({{Pronounce|bah|RAY|kee|ehl|refs= His symbol was the [[lion]]. He was also the herald of the Hebdomad, the leader of Celestia's defenses, the leader of the [[trumpet archon]]s, and a patron of mortal heralds.

==Description==
Barachiel was a regal [[tome archon]] standing nine feet (three meters) tall. Sexless, but with masculine features, he had impressive, silver-feathered wings above his shoulders. His skin was silver, and his eyes were dark purple.

Barachiel clothed himself in a long violet robe speckled with glowing stars.

==Abilities==
Barachiel had all of the powers common to tome archons. In addition to these, unique magical abilities were available to him. He could [[detect chaos]] and [[True seeing|see any creature as they truly were]]. By thought alone, he could [[consecrate]] an area with [[positive energy]], [[Daylight|illuminate an area with a light as bright as day]], surround his head with a flaming [[crown of brilliance]] so bright to blind foes, [[Dream|alter dreams]] or send [[Nightmare (spell)|nightmares]], [[Greater dispelling|dispel all but the most powerful magical effects]], [[hallow|make a site holy]], [[Ray of hope|instill hope in subjects within range]], [[Sending|send a short message to an individual anywhere in the multiverse]], [[Shield of the archons|defend himself with a mystical shield]], [[Sword of conscience|fill an evil creature with intense feelings of remorse]], [[Tomb of light|entrap an evil creature in light]], and grant a subject a [[Vision of heaven|vision of the Seven Heavens]]. He could blind his enemies by [[holy smite|smiting them with holy power]]. With a single, spoken [[holy word]], he could slay or banish wicked beings, and with another, he could [[Power word, stun|stun]] them. He could also [[Message|whisper messages]] to recipients at a distance.

Once a day, Barachiel could [[True resurrection|resurrect anyone who had died]] or perform another [[miracle]].

Barachiel could electrify any metal weapon that he held in his hands and cause it to launch a bolt of lightning at any enemy within 100 feet (30 meters). Barachiel preferred to use this electricity in battle, but if his enemies were immune to lightning, he would resort to his other magical powers.

==Possessions==
Barachiel's personal weapon was a large [[longsword]]. He also carried the same sort of magical silver trumpet wielded by trumpet archons.

Barachiel ruled from the [[Citadel of the Stars]], a fortress located on the shore of the [[Lunia|Silver Sea]].

==Activities==
Barachiel rarely had much to do in his role as defender of the entrance of the Seven Heavens. As herald of the Hebdomad he would direct the trumpet archons in delivering messages. On occasion, he might even deliver messages to the Material Plane himself, if the message was important enough to warrant such a powerful messenger.

In the Realms, some [[lawful good]] [[cleric]]s dedicated themselves to Barachiel's cause. While he could not grant spells directly, he would petition their [[patron deity]] to grant them access to [[Herald domain|unique spells]] and enhanced skills at intimidation and diplomacy.

==Relationships==
One of Barachiel's champions was [[Ziamiral]], a [[sword archon]] who served as commander of one of Barachiel's standing celestial armies.
