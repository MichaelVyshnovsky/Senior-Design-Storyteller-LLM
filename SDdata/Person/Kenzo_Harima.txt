Kenzo Harima was an undead being in Kudoku and secretly one of the Five Deadly Shadows in 1479 DR.
The wealth of Kudoku attracted Kenzo and the other Five Deadly Shadows. They slowly infiltrated the city, corrupting everything.
When rumors of the corruption reached the ears of the provincial governor in 1479 DR, she sent the magistrate Hiro Yun. Step by step, Hiro efficiently shut down all the gangs operations and arrested most of its members until only the five leaders remained. At this point, Hiro discovered the lair of Kenzo in an abandoned warehouse. There, Hiro was ambushed by all the five leaders, including Kenzo. However, Kenzo was moved by Hiros words and changed sides, trying to defeat his former fellows. However, in the end, Kenzo and Hiro were killed and Namiko Li bound the souls of Hiro Yun and Kenzo Harima to Toril, preventing them from going to the afterlife.
Thereafter, Hiro and Kenzo haunted the warehouse as undead. Later an adventuring party confronted and defeated them.
Kenzo changed his mind after meeting Hiro. However, he couldnt resist the call for blood.
