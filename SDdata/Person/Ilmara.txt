Ilmara was a queen of Impiltur and the third ruler of the Heltharn Dynasty.
Ilmara was the only daughter of King Imphras I and Queen Sambral. Her elder brother was Imbrar I.
In 1167 DR, in her early 60s, Ilmara finally married. Her husband was Rilaun of Sarshel, a man half her age. Their son was named Imphras II.
Born in 1104 DR,
The hobgoblins did return. When she saw them through the stones in 1127 DR, her brother, King Imbrar, took an army to the Giantspire Mountains to defeat them. The king, his men, and the hobgoblins were never seen again. Ilmara took the crown with sorrow.
Upon the birth of her son from her late marriage in 1169 DR, her husband became angry when she named her new son heir instead of him. He tried to take the throne by force but was killed.
Ilmara served as regent until her son reached the age of sixteen years, at which point she left the throne. She died five years later in 1190 DR.
