'''Taglath''' was a bizarre [[ghost]] in [[Skullport]].

==History==
In life, Taglath was a poet, explorer, and a romantic. He was known for courting the most beautiful women of the city, not caring for possible husbands. One day, after a tryst with the wife of a [[Calishite]] merchant, Taglath was assassinated in a Skullport street by an invisible creature. He would appear as a ghost in the place of his death.
