==Description==
Despite Chinchilla's basic appearance, she was a powerful [[spellcaster]]. Chinchilla was exceptionally intelligent and dexterous.

==Abilities==
As a formidable [[mage]], Chinchilla was able to cast some of the most powerful spells in the [[Realms]]. She was naturally ''[[haste|hasted]]'', could move and attack very swiftly, and could even morph into a different form. Chinchilla had the ability to transform into a [[wolfwere|greater wolfwere]], and could generate her pool of health extremely quickly.

Unlike other leporine creatures, Chinchilla was very well naturally armored and could survive many blows. She was also highly resistant to [[magic]] as well as melee and ranged [[weapon]]s.

==Relationships==
Chinchilla had formed some sort of brotherhood with other atypical Bhaalspawn; these were [[Toop]] the Brave, [[Tibbit]], and [[Merlinious]].

==History==
Some time prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], Chinchilla's mother somehow came to be pregnant with the seed of the Lord of Murder, Bhaal.

In [[1369 DR]], Chinchilla could be found outside of [[Yaga-Shura]]'s abode in the [[Marching Mountains]], alongside her Bhaalspawn half-brothers. When discovered, they planned to run out of sight, so as to not get murdered by other Bhaalspawn.
