'''Eron Imgrym''' was a [[mage]] of [[Sheirtalar]] of the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Although young, Eron achieved quite powerful [[spell]]s, which he used freely and violently to slay a lot of other mages and claim their [[magic]].

In the [[1354 DR|Year of the Bow, 1354 DR]], Eron ambushed the current [[Magister]], [[Imrul Athelzedar]] and his apprentice [[Nouméa Drathchuld]], with absolutely no warning or formal challenge. In a near instant, the Magister shielded Nouméa with his own spell, ''[[Athelzedar's rest]]'', and told her to stab himself and their assailant with her [[dagger]] as his and Eron's spells fueled the rest, bound them together, and consumed them, thus, ensuring their deaths and her ascension as the new Magister of [[Mystra]].
