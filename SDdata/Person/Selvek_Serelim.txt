'''Selvek Serelim''' was a merchant that operated alongside his brother [[Noohar Serelim|Noohar]] on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He had some form of mutism and communicated exclusively by means of [[sign language]].

==History==
Some time during the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Selvek and Noohar were transporting wooden carvings from the elves of [[Cormyr]] across the Sword Coast. Unbeknownst to them, the caravan they traveled with was full of agents of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. The cultists were transporting wealth of riches they had stolen for use in a ritual that could summon their goddess [[Tiamat]] to the Realms.
