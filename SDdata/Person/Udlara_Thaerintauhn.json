        "mainbody": "Udlara Thaerintauhn was a bedine camel breeder.\nUdlara was not above taking advantage of outlanders, if they didnt show themselves to be respectful of bedine culture.\nUdlara sold camels and lived in a tent that was larger on the inside, Udlaras tent.\nUdlara bred camels.\nUdlara was a widow. At the Bitter Well Oasis, he employed a few boys as keepers.\nA casually-cast Zhentarim spell had killed her husband, widowing Udlara some time prior.\nAt a later point, Udlara was the owner of Udlaras Camel Emporium, and also a man. He served the adventurers sent by Cormyr to track down Sabkhat el Talab, providing better service should they be mindful of the customs."
