'''Royappa''' was a female [[rakshasa]] who got trapped inside the [[Tower of Ruin]] around [[1359 DR]].

==Personality==
Royappa was cunning and crafty, and a compulsive liar.

==Possessions==
She wore a ''[[amulet of proof against detection and location]]'', and a jewelled necklace worth 4,000 [[gp]].

==Abilities==
Royappa was able to command some [[divine]] and [[arcane]] powers, which mostly focused around disabling or tricking her enemies. As a rakshasa, she could shapechange into a more innocuous humanoid form.

==History==
In [[1359 DR]], she visited the [[Tower of Ruin]] to investigate the curious situation there, only to be trapped herself by the curse from [[Torm]]. Though she lived comfortably on the ground floor of the Tower, she could not leave or acquire ''[[Silveredge]]''.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, she encountered adventurers who had entered the Tower in their own investigation. She presented herself as '''Elan''', a [[human]] woman sent by Torm to protect the Tower. Given the chance, she would have tried to isolate and kill the adventurers.
