She wore a amulet of proof against detection and location, and a jewelled necklace worth 4,000 gp.
Royappa was able to command some divine and arcane powers, which mostly focused around disabling or tricking her enemies. As a rakshasa, she could shapechange into a more innocuous humanoid form.
In 1359 DR, she visited the Tower of Ruin to investigate the curious situation there, only to be trapped herself by the curse from Torm. Though she lived comfortably on the ground floor of the Tower, she could not leave or acquire Silveredge.
In the , she encountered adventurers who had entered the Tower in their own investigation. She presented herself as Elan, a human woman sent by Torm to protect the Tower. Given the chance, she would have tried to isolate and kill the adventurers.
