Bellowgulp Bluefingers was a the traveling potion-peddlers and the companion of the myconid alchemist known as the Concoctor. The two traveled across the Realms selling their wars during the 14 century DR.
Despite the often dire and depressing circumstances he often found himself, Bellowgulp was ever the optimist.
Bellowgulp had a robust understanding on the system of communication used by myconids, a process that involved the dispersal of spores from their bloom-sacs.
By the time Bellowgulp and his myconid friend Concoctor were relocated to Thay, the gnome merchant developed an allergy to the Concoctors spores they communicated through.
He served as both a salesmen and an intermediary for the Concoctor, due to the myconids inability to speak and understand the common language. During their tenure as arena merchants they provided all manner of potions and substances to the gladiators that fought for their lives.
At some point during or before the , Bellowgulp and the Concoctor had been taken captive by the eccentric drow Baeloth the Entertainer, and forced to set up their shop at his Black Pits gladiatorial arena in a region of the Underdark beneath the Sword Coast. When Baeloth was defeated by one of his own fighters, Bellowgulp and his fungi friend were able to flee underground, making their way across the subterranean Nepenthe River.
By the following year, the pair had made their way to the eastern realm of Thay. Captured by the Planar Hunters while scavenging for gems and potion ingredients not far from an Underdark city of Blingdenstone, they were taken to the estate of the powerful Red Wizard Dennaton to again serve as merchants at an arena, this time serving the famed gladiators of Thay.
