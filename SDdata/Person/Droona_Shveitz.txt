'''Droona Shveitz''' was an inhabitant of [[Baldur's Gate]] and the wife of [[Agnes Shveitz]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''I hope the Grand Duke strings up whoever did this to her.''|Droona Shveitz}}

==Description==
Droona was a female [[gold dwarf]] with a clean-shaven face and long, straight chestnut hair gathered in a ponytail. The woman had a fair skin tone, dark brown eyes, and a beauty mark at the corner of her left eye.

==History==
Agnes Shveitz, Droona's wife, was murdered, presumably by the vicious members of the [[Cult of Bhaal]], in or shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Agnes was buried in the [[Lower City Graveyard]], next to the [[Hhune Mausoleum]]. The gravestone was etched with a single inscription: "Beloved Agnes Shveitz. Her smile shined like a thousand suns." In 1492 DR, Droona could often be seen mourning at the gravestone. The murder made her a stern supporter of the new Grand Duke Lord [[Enver Gortash]], hoping that he would bring the murderers to justice and believing that if it were not for his [[steel watch]], there would be many more Bhaalist murders in Baldur's Gate. Droona was at her wife's grave when it may had been accidentally desecrated, and Agnes's body raised as a [[zombie]] by [[Nina Dortmell]], a talented child with the [[gift]], who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother.
