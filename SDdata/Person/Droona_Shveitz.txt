Droona Shveitz was an inhabitant of Baldurs Gate and the wife of Agnes Shveitz in the late 15 century DR.
Droona was a female gold dwarf with a clean-shaven face and long, straight chestnut hair gathered in a ponytail. The woman had a fair skin tone, dark brown eyes, and a beauty mark at the corner of her left eye.
Agnes Shveitz, Droonas wife, was murdered, presumably by the vicious members of the Cult of Bhaal, in or shortly before the . Agnes was buried in the Lower City Graveyard, next to the Hhune Mausoleum. The gravestone was etched with a single inscription "Beloved Agnes Shveitz. Her smile shined like a thousand suns." In 1492 DR, Droona could often be seen mourning at the gravestone. The murder made her a stern supporter of the new Grand Duke Lord Enver Gortash, hoping that he would bring the murderers to justice and believing that if it were not for his steel watch, there would be many more Bhaalist murders in Baldurs Gate. Droona was at her wifes grave when it may had been accidentally desecrated, and Agness body raised as a zombie by Nina Dortmell, a talented child with the gift, who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother.
