}}'''Misker the Pirate Tyrant''' was a [[beholder]] smuggler king in [[Skullport]].

==Description==
Misker, towering even by beholder standards, was an imposing figure, his body scarred and cracked from countless battles. His massive form was covered in warts, with two of his eyestalks covered by patches, not from combat loss, but to conceal unique powers. One of these eyes, according to legend, could unleash a destructive beam potent enough to slice through [[dragon]] hide as if it were cloth.

==Personality==
Misker was known to have a very creative mind in developing his smuggling routes. His long memory ensured that nobody who cheated him could escape his revenge.

==Activities==
Misker managed most of the smuggling operations in Skullport. Though once actively involved in every facet of his operation, by [[1370 DR]] Misker remained mostly within his [[Misker's Manse|mansion]] in the [[Skullport/Lower Trade Lanes|Lower Trade Lanes]], rarely seen beyond its confines. The day-to-day management of his smuggling empire has been delegated to trusted subordinates, including a cadre of lesser beholders and loyal [[human]] and [[demihuman]] operatives. These underlings handled routine affairs, consulting Misker only on matters deemed too critical to entrust to anyone but the Pirate Tyrant himself.

==Powers==
Misker's nickname derived from two of his eyestalks, which were always covered by eyepatches. Those eyestalks had unique abilities, which remained a mystery.

==History==
Misker directed his smuggling operations for a very long time. In [[1370 DR]], just after the death of his major competitor, the beholder [[Seirtych Xantaun]], who was killed at the hands of the [[Xanathar]], Misker retreated from most of his operations. He left them in the hands of his trusted underlings and acted only as an advisor. He said he had decided to go into semi-retirement because he had enough money.

In [[1375 DR]] Misker relocated to [[Trobriand's Graveyard]] after escaping an attack by the [[Agents of the Eye]] who destroyed his lair. He liked the location's abundance of [[mithril]] and decided to use it as his new headquarters. He slowly rebuildt his organization to be ready for vengeance.
