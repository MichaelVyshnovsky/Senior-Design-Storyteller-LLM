Lieutenant '''Nessfettle''' was an officer of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] that served the great city during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|The [[Ashmadai]] have been launching assaults on our position over the last several hours, and we have soldiers with injuries.}}

==Relationships==
She served under Captain [[Dunfield]] and had earned his trust as a reliable officer of the Guard.

==History==
Lieutenant Nessfettle led her soldiers into the city of [[Helm's Hold]] during the [[Siege of Helm's Hold|city's siege]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. During the siege, they became overwhelmed by the [[Ashmadai]] and their [[devil]]ish servitors and were forced to barricade themselves within an abandoned home. They endured ongoing attacks until a sergeant of the Guard broke through the Ashmadai forces, help Nessfettle and her men defend against a counterattack and finally head back out to the [[Last Redoubt]] camp with their lives.
