'''Yerle''' was a guardswoman who worked for the [[Zhentarim]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Nothing for you in there, mate.|Yerle.}}

==Description==
Yerle had fair skin and wore her hair in curled braids along the top, with sheared sides. She wore a suit of simple, [[studded leather]] armor and leather gloves.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Yerle was tasked with protecting [[Roah Moonglow]] during her dealings with the [[cult of the Absolute]] at the [[Shattered Sanctum]]. The Zhentarim and the cult were trading in slaves and dangerous amounts of [[smokepowder]]. Yerlo and her fellow guard [[Erna]] watched over a storerom in the sanctum, that held barrels upon barrels of the highly-volatile substance.
