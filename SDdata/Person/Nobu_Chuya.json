        "History": "Chuya was an administrator of the [[Karo]] in [[Jasuga]] but his math skills so impressed the [[shogun]] that he was promoted to the [[wakadoshiyori council]] despite his young age. In time, he became the chief inspector of public works. However, Chuya was a corrupt individual, always accepting bribes and he had a lucrative business as a loan shark. Usually he spent all his free time in [[Semmishi]] where no vice was too indecent for his enjoyment."
