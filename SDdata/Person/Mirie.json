Anyone who partook in our methods did so willingly, and left with a smile on their face, freed from their troubles. Would you accuse a surgeon of robbing a tumor? I think not.''|Mirie}}",
        "Description": "Mirie was a [[wood elven]] woman with light and freckled skin. She had blonde hair and green eyes. As an attendant and a clerk, she wore simple priestly tunic and carried a [[quarterstaff]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Mirie served the [[Viconia DeVir|Mother Superior]] as one of her Attendant of Grief at the House of Grief. She welcomed guests and those searching for the temple's services in achieving sweet oblivion from grief, pain, [[melancholy]], or treachery. She directed guests to the ritual of [[Mapping of the Heart]] that determined the supplicants' true thoughts and intentions."
