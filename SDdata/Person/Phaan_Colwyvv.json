At this time, he entered the council as a Pommarch, but rose to Iltarch in 1345 DR and Tessarch in 1362 DR.\nPhaan had a hooked nose and was notoriously miserly, focusing on finances and ways to make more profit. He had a cold manner.\nPhaan knew Iltarch Rhinnom Dannihyr well but trusted him little because theyd once worked together as Shadow Thieves, where Phaan was a spy, nicknamed \"Shars Gallant\". Phaan killed all five of his older brothers to become the head of the family, but the familys power was decreasing in 1333 DR, at which point he was invited to join the Council of Six by Thayze Selemchant."
