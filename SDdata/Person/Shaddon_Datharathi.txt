'''Shaddon Datharathi''' was the patriarch of the [[Datharathi]] family in {{yearlink|1374}} and the inventor of [[plangent]]s.{{cite book/Darkvision||10}} He became a thrall of [[Pandorym]] while improving on them.{{cite book/Darkvision||16}}

==Appearance==
Shaddon had grafted his entire body, effectively replacing his skin, with [[plangent]] crystal. He had muscles and bone visible, but only one eye remained natural. He clothed himself fully in ornate golden robes, with a stiff collar, cape, and silken gloves.

==History==
Shaddon was the wizard who built [[Warian Datharathi]]'s prosthetic in {{yearlink|1367}}; he later improved the process, developing the plangents.{{cite book/Darkvision||7}} In his own words, he was the most accomplished mage that the family had ever produced.{{cite book/Darkvision|151|15}} He continued to improve on them, and starting on {{yearlink|1372}} he gained the power to possess, both spying on and controlling, any plangent in [[Vaelan]], unfortunately discovering his own transformation into a plangent had made him a thrall to [[Pandorym]] in the process,{{cite book/Darkvision||25}} Few suspected of his activities, but [[Zeltaebar Datharathi]] had come to suspect that something was controlling [[Xaemar Datharathi]] and other plangents.{{cite book/Darkvision||15}} In fact, his son Xaemar had become his favourite puppet.{{cite book/Darkvision||16}}

When Warian Datharathi returned to Vaelan, he insisted, through Xaemar, that the man come see him immediately.{{cite book/Darkvision||21}} Later, as his grand-daughter [[Eined Datharathi]] arrived together with [[Iahn Qoyllor]] and [[Ususi Manaallin]], he'd attack them too, killing Eined; they'd paralyze him and escape.{{cite book/Darkvision||23}}

Shaddon Datharathi was finally slain in the Imperial Weapons Cache of the [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]] by the [[elf]] [[Kiril Duskmourn]], on [[Tarsakh 19]] of {{yearlink|1374}}.{{cite book/Darkvision||30}}{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|155}}
