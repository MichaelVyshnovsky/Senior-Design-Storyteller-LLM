        "mainbody": "'''Marlin Stormserpent''' was a noble from [[Suzail]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He conspired to wield [[blueflame ghost]]s against the Crown.",
        "Relationships": "He was the son of [[Narmitra Stormserpent]] and nephew of [[Mhedarlakh Stormserpent]]; his father was long-dead. his siblings were named [[Elgrym Stormserpent]], [[Rondras Stormserpent]], and [[Nethglas Stormserpent]]. He had a pet [[stirge]] named [[Thirsty]].",
        "Possessions": "Of note, Marlin managed to seize two relics of the Nine: the ''Flying Blade'' and the ''Wyverntongue Chalice'', as well as an ''[[enchanted]]'' [[hand axe]] also made by [[the Imprisoners]], which held [[Mirt]], a moneylender. One of his amulets rendered him largely immune to the special attacks of most undead. He also bore some sort of ''[[ironguard]]''-like protection, a ''[[potion of neutralize poison]]'', and when out for trouble, a high gorget that thwarted stranglings, possibly through magic.",
        "History": {
            "Prior to Council": "After his older brother Nethglas Stormserpent stole the ''Wyverntongue Chalice'', he bragged about the theft before he came to fear possible consequences, and swore all his younger brothers to silence on the matter. He later slew Elgrym for speaking about it with [[Nael Rowanmantle]], and gave his two remaining brothers a thinly veiled warning that's what had happened. After his older brother's death in {{yearlink|1437}}, Marlin poisoned his other brother, Rondras, out of an obsession with possessing the ''Flying Blade''.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Marlin was conspiring regularly with [[Lothrae]], a figure he knew little about, about seizing ''[[blueflame item]]s'' to control deadly [[blueflame ghost]]s. Lothrae warned him that the [[War Wizards]] were getting suspicious about his actions.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|43-45|4}} Marlin Stormserpent was one of the guests at the [[Open Feast]] in [[Mirtul 26]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, where he received a brief inquiry about a project of his' by [[Mellast Ormblade]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|69|6}}\n\nHe excused himself from the Open Feast as soon as [[Ganrahast]] did, heading down [[Dragontriumph Hall]], where a number of War Wizards were asleep after he'd contrived to drug the wine served by the cellarer, [[Jamaldro]]. He then met up with a band of blades he'd hired, and headed for the [[Haunted Wing]]. There, after fighting a few undead, he neared the [[Dragonskull Chamber]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|72-81|7}} He did not enter it at the time.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|93-94|9}}\n\nAfter finding the ''Wyverntongue Chalice'' hidden close by, Marlin came across a patrol of [[Purple Dragon]]s, whom his men slew, aided by his pet stirge, Thirsty.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|126-129|12}} Back at Stormserpent towers, he slew his hirelings.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|130-132|12}}\n\nAt a later date, Marlin had breakfast at the [[Old King's Favorite]]'s, an eatery, where he learned that his previous actions were attributed to an invading army at the castle.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|183-185|18}} He decided to head to Dragonskull once more, to practice the use of the blueflame ghosts.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|205-212|20}}\n\nAfter [[Broryn Windstag]] was kicked out of the [[Dragonriders Club]] for drunkenness and assault, his posse headed to Marlin's home. There, Marlin told them he had a plan to gain control of Cormyr.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|237-241|23}} The blueflame ghosts soon made their way back to him.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|245-247|23}} Later, he hired [[Jharakphred]] to paint the likenesses of Lords [[Gariskar Dauntinghorn]] and [[Draskos Crownsilver]]; he had the artist slain afterwards, and had his blueflame ghosts memorize the likenesses and go out to slay. Shortly after, at the Old King's Favorite, he learned from the mage [[Oskrul Meddanthyr]] that another ''blueflame item'' was a largish [[hand axe]]. Almost instantly, he informed his co-conspirators that the axe was to be found as soon as possible.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|258-267|25}}\n\nMarlin Stormserpent was later awakened at an ungodly hour by the Purple Dragons, to tell him about how his servant Gaskur was found dead, and the word \"[[Talane]]\" was drawn next to him. He was shaken up badly by the realization, and used his blueflame ghosts to keep watch over himself while he slept.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|302-308|29}} He contacted Lothrae, whose contacts were growing more sparse, then, and asked for advice; he got nothing much.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|324-325|31}} After Broryn Windstag, Delasko Sornstern, and Kathkote Dawntard brought him the requested hand axe, he immediately tried to invoke its ghost.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|340-342|32}} Rather than a ghost, he got Mirt; after in their disappointment, they tried to shake him up for money, he gave them a good shellacking and fled.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|343-346|33}}\n\nThough frustrating, Marlin continued to plot with his companions; he made the call that some of them would attend the Council, and the rest would remain behind, ready to reach out to any noble that appeared dissatisfied. He then called for a playpretty.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|366-369|35}} Together with the playpretty came [[Arclath Delcastle]], a fellow noble young lord, who appeared to know entirely too much about the conspiracy. Before he could return to the playpretty after dismissing Arclath, Elminster appeared to confront him; the old mage said the blueflame ghosts were about to lead the Purple Dragons back to him if he didn't stop them immediately.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|371-373|35}}",
            "After the Council": "Marlin Stormserpent was snatched from Stormserpent Towers by Manshoon, who was at the moment controlling two [[death tyrant]]s; he overexerted himself, and was thus unable to properly relieve Marlin of the ''Flying Blade'' and ''Wyverntongue Chalice''.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|122-123|13}} Marlin sought succor at Broryn Windstag's home, [[Staghaven House]]; there, he met with [[Traevyn Illance]], who was recruiting nobles to a treacherous cause.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|132-135|14}} Lord Illance hatched a plot for him, where he'd set his blueflame ghosts to menace the King, [[Foril Obarskyr I]], and then pretend to save him.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|141|15}} He put the plan in motion.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|155-156|17}}\n\nHis ghosts were repelled, and returned to him at Stormserpent Towers. He immediately decided to flee Suzail.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|188-192|20}} Taking the [[Way of the Dragon]], he headed into the [[King's Forest]], where he spent the evening; he used his blueflame ghosts there to find evenfeast. They brought him a [[bear]], unable to hunt much else.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|237-239|25}} He reasoned shortly after that he would go to the Windstag family hunting lodge, have his bullyblades kill everyone there, and go there. Though they did, he was soon slain by the sorceress [[Cymmarra]], the Lady of Ghosts, at the hunting lodge. Her blueflame ghosts sliced off his arms, and then she choked him to death carelessly, despite her original intention of interrogating him about any other blueflame ghosts and the [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]]."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Unknown to Marlin, Elminster knew about his plans even before he knew of Elminster at all.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|20-21|1}}\n\nRather than tell his trusted nobles of his control of blueflame ghosts, Marlin preferred to pretend he was in cahoots with at least one powerful mage, and that he had access to a lost Obarskyr potential heir. He meant to present one of the blueflame ghosts as the true Obarskyr, if it came to that."
