Dread Brother Elryn was a Sharran priest during the midâ€“8 century DR.
Elryn starkly regretted his lack of familiarity with the arcane, for one, and for another, he was quite dissatisfied by his underlings carelessness.
He was a bald man who wore purple and black robes.
He looted a plethora of magic from Karsus Keep.
He led five Dreadspells in his last mission Hrelgrath, Vaelam, Daluth, Iyrindyl, and Femter Deldrannus. Throughout the task, he was ever-aware of Avroanas possible scrying.
As a Dreadspell, he wielded borrowed arcane power.
He mostly farscried on Sharran agents.
About two tendays into the Chaos of the Art in the , Elryn had become a Dreadspell he was then sent to capture or slay a Chosen of Mystra near Westgate. Immediately after teleporting, they came to a shrine of Shar near the Dead Place, where they picked up the woodsman Uldus Blackram and had him work as their guide.
Coercion became necessary, and Uldus Blackram led them with a sword and knife to his back, as well as a noose tied around his neck to make sure he didnt miss any reminders. During the first leg of their trip, they came across Ilbryn Starym, an elven wizard, and quickly turned violent though Ilbryn escaped, he first slew Uldus Blackram, and one of the Dreadspells, Iyrindyl, was slain during the fight.
Once they found the ruin, Karsus Keep and Vaelam stumbled upon the way to access the inside, Elryn led the looting. Once their looted magic failed against Azuth, despite bringing down the ruin, they fled.
When Dread Sister Klalaera appeared and herded them back against Azuth, they were stopped partway by Umbregard and Starsunder, two mages that appeared suddenly. During the battle, they were eliminated one by one, until Elryn alone remained he was slain by a third archmage, Tenthar Taerhamoos of the Phoenix Tower.
