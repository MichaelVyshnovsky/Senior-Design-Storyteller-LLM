Semmonemily was a doppelganger working for the Kraken Society. 
As a member of the Kraken Society, Semmonemily would gather the latest rumors and information from numerous Underdark sources and unusual informers.
Semmonemily was once the servant of an Illithid who had transformed into an alhoon.
In 1361 DR, while working for the Kraken Society, he killed and replaced a Waterdhavian courier in Yartar on behalf of Baron Khaumfros, in order to plant the seeds of a conspiracy to cause a war between Waterdeep and Ruathym.
By 1372 DR, Semmonemily was a senior agent of the Kraken Society, responsible for keeping watch over the Dessarin River valley area.
