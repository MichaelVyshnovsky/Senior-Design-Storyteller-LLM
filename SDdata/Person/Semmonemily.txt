'''Semmonemily''' was a [[doppelganger]] working for the [[Kraken Society]]. 

==Activities==
As a member of the [[Kraken Society]], Semmonemily would gather the latest rumors and information from numerous [[Underdark]] sources and unusual informers.

==History==
Semmonemily was once the servant of an [[Illithid]] who had transformed into an [[alhoon]].

In [[1361 DR]], while working for the Kraken Society, he killed and replaced a [[Waterdhavian]] courier in [[Yartar]] on behalf of Baron [[Alahar Khaumfros|Khaumfros]], in order to plant the seeds of a conspiracy to cause a war between [[Waterdeep]] and [[Ruathym]].

By [[1372 DR]], Semmonemily was a senior agent of the Kraken Society, responsible for keeping watch over the [[Dessarin River]] valley area.
