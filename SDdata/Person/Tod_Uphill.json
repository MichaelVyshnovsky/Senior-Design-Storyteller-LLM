        "mainbody": "Tod Uphill was an adventuring thief who fell into the Waterdeep sewers circa 1358 DR. He had short brown hair and a black eyepatch covering his right eye.\nThe thief was somewhat paranoid. He claimed to have been charged with completing many important quests, and accused a group of laughing at him after telling them his story of ending up in the sewers.\nTod Uphill was, apparently, a serious adventurer and was given important tasks, but managed to fall into a sewage drain. The halfling may have been resurrected by a group that set out to slay Xanathar. If so, he asked if the group needed a skilled rogue in the party."
