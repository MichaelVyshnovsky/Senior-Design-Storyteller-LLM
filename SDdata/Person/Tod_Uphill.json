        "mainbody": "'''Tod Uphill''' was an adventuring [[thief]] who fell into the [[Waterdeep]] sewers ''circa'' [[1358 DR]]. He had short brown hair and a black eyepatch covering his right eye.",
        "Personality": "The thief was somewhat paranoid. He claimed to have been charged with completing many important quests, and accused a group of laughing at him after telling them his story of ending up in the sewers.",
        "History": "Tod Uphill was, apparently, a serious adventurer and was given important tasks, but managed to fall into a sewage drain. The [[halfling]] may have been resurrected by a group that set out to slay [[Xanathar]]. If so, he asked if the group needed a skilled rogue in the party."
