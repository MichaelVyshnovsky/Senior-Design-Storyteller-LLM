'''Borsipa''' was an apprentice member of the [[Northern Wizards]] in [[Unther]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
In truth, Borsipa was a spy for [[Gilgeam]], sending constant reports to the king's army. She was collaborating with [[Shuruppak]] to kill all the Northern Wizards, a duty she performed without any doubt.
