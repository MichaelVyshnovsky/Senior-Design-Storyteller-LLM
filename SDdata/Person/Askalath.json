        "mainbody": "'''Askalath''' was a [[mage]] who once resided on the isle of [[Askalet]] in the [[Sea of Swords]], many centuries before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century DR, little remained recorded of Askalath's history. [[Elminster Aumar]], the Sage of [[Shadowdale]], believed that the mage's island, Askalet, got its name from a corruption of \"Askalath.\" The mage resided in his [[Askalath's tower|tower]], long a ruin in the 14{{th}} century DR. By that time, his home was looted of most of the treasures. However, in the tower's basement, one could find a long, seeming infinite well, a shaft that plummeted deep into the bowels of the [[Undermountain]]. Cellar complexes were hidden closer to the shaft's end, with entrances accessible from the bottom of the well."
