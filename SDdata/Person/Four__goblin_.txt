{{Quote|You think you're hard. Mess with us, and you'' end up like this bleeder.|Four, referring to the corpse she was desecrating.}}

==Personality==
Four was quite belligerent even for a child, let alone a goblinoid one.

==Relationships==
She looked up to her mother, believed she was "tough as [[worg]]-meat" even before their lives were blessed by [[the Absolute]].

==History==
Four was present when her companion [[Eight]]'s parents were killed at their camp's raid of [[Waukeen's Rest]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. She consoled her friend and avenge his parents' death by helping kick and punch the corpse of the man that killed them.
