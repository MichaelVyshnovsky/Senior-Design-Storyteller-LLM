        "mainbody": "The Lord Sage of Phlan was a sage in Phlan in 1489 DR.\nThe Lord was a taciturn and reserved individual. He was slow to show his emotions but despised troubles in his library.\nThe Lord Sage was the caretaker of Mantors Library in Phlan, who was accompanied by his second-in-command Cassra Brandywine. In his free time he studied Denlors Tower\nIn 1489 DR, two newly hired scribes, Spernik and Tibeem, were discovered stealing books from the Lords private chambers. Tibeem killed one of the summoned Knights of the Black Fist and was captured, but Spernik escaped. So the Lord Sage hired an adventuring party to find the thief and the stolen books. After the coup of Vorgansharax in conjuration with Harpers he sent adventurers to explore the Yarashs pyramid.\nLater Vorgansharax trapped the Lord Sage inside his library in Phlan but he knew too much.\nThank to an adventuring party hired by the resistance he managed to escape Phlan."
