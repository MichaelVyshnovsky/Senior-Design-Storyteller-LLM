        "mainbody": "Donar Heremet was a thief inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe wore an enchanted suit of leather armor, and wielded a short sword and a dagger of homing. The equipment, as well as his stealthy training, came from Essimuth Lanys.\nDonar enjoyed playing pranks on people that were usually harmless such as hanging a bucket of water over a door. His antics frequently got him chased from the Safehaven Inn.\nHe had two sisters named Edrianna and Ariel."
