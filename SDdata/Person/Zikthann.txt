'''Zikthann of the Six Scepters''' was a [[human]] [[lich]] living in [[Sshamath]] in the year [[1370 DR]]. 

==History==
Zikthann was a [[wizard]] from [[Illusk]]. After the fall of his country in [[1244 DR]], he wandered around [[north Faer√ªn]] for many years, eventually entering the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] to become one of the [[Old One]]s. While exploring the [[Netherese Caverns]], Zikthann covertly followed a Sshamathan patrol to the city. He acted as chief trade representative of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in Sshamath, although Zikthann never told his fellows the source of the spells and magic items he exported to [[Luskan]], giving him tight control over the new magic.
