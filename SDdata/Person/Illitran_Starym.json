        "mainbody": "Lord Illitran Starym was Lord Speaker of the Starym clan. He infamously forged a pact with Moander in order to fool his Moonblade and retain power over the house.\nIn 523 DR, a branch of  moon elven ex-patriate members of the Starym Clan returned to Myth Drannor to reclaim the house and return it to glory. The return drew the line of succession into question, as the heir at the time, Josidiah Starym, was away on a mission to find the lost Warblade since 500 DR. The Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl demanded that the current Lord Speaker, Illitran, draw his familys Moonblade to prove his worthiness and preserve Josidiahs heir status.\nDetermined to draw the blade successfully, Illitran set out on a three-month trek through the woods intended to purify his soul and clense his spirit. Unknown to all, he actually visited the ruins of Moanders temple in the northern forest, where he forged a pact with the imprisoned god, gaining the ability to cancel the powers of the sword that would deem him unworthy of Lordship. Upon his return, he easily drew the blade, and proved to Myth Drannor his familys loyalty.\nWhile Josidiah was away, Illitran named his first son, Venali Starym the heir of the house Lordship.\nCategoryInhabitants of Cormanthor\nCategoryInhabitants of Myth Drannor\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryMoon elves\nCategoryNobles\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryMembers of House Starym\n4sp79iqswbnsnxqbyokf2nw1j9e5p8a"
