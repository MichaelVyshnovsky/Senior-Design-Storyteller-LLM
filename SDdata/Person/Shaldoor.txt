Shaldoor was a storm giant residing in the Maelstrom in the Trackless Sea during the late 15 century DR.
Like many giants, Shaldoor had a deep-seated hatred for dragons and longed for the empire of Ostoria to be restored. Thus, when the shattering of the Ordning occurred, she felt it was a sign from Annam All-Father that they should go to war against their ancient enemies.
Shaldoor reveled in life on the battlefield, believing that war was an inherent aspect of life for giants and especially storm giants.
Shaldoor was a skilled animal handler, known for riding atop rocs and whales.
Shaldoor was one of four storm giant bodyguards that accompanied Imperator Uthor in the Storm Kings assault on Iymriths lair. She fought alongside Nimir, Orlekto, and Vaasha.
