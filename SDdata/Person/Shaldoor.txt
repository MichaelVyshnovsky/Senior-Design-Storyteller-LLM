'''Shaldoor''' was a [[storm giant]] residing in the [[Maelstrom (fortress)|Maelstrom]] in the [[Trackless Sea]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Like many [[giant]]s, Shaldoor had a deep-seated hatred for [[dragon]]s and longed for the empire of [[Ostoria]] to be restored. Thus, when the shattering of the [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]] occurred, she felt it was a sign from [[Annam All-Father]] that they should go to war against their ancient enemies.

Shaldoor reveled in life on the battlefield, believing that war was an inherent aspect of life for giants and especially storm giants.

==Activities==
Shaldoor was a skilled animal handler, known for riding atop [[roc]]s and [[whale]]s.

==History==
Shaldoor was one of four storm giant bodyguards that accompanied Imperator [[Uthor]] in the [[Hekaton|Storm King]]'s assault on [[Iymrith]]'s lair. She fought alongside [[Nimir]], [[Orlekto]], and [[Vaasha]].
