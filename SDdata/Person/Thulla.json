While searching for the long-lost site known as Grymforge, they were attacked by cultists of the Absolute led by Gekh Coal and other duergar slavers. While most of the gnomes were slain or taken captive by the cult, Thulla managed to get away with mere wounds. Unfortunately, the blade that cut her was laced with duergar poison.\nAt some point during or before their encounter, Thulla managed to steal Gekhs pair of boots of speed."
