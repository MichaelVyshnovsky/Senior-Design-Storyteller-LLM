        "mainbody": "'''Thulla''' was a [[gnome]] of [[Clan Ironhand]] who lived in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was part of an unfortunate excursion to the [[Underdark]] that led to much of her clan being killed or captured by the [[Cult of the Absolute]].\n\n{{Quote|We were in an expedition down here when the duergar snatched us up, I got away, but not the others. The greys have them digging out some old ruin across the lake.|Thulla.}}",
        "Description": "Thulla had gray skin and vivid white hair. She wore a [[leather]] jerkin over a green shirt and leather pants.",
        "Personality": "She was an intrepid if a bit secretive individual. The activities she and her clan conducted were held in some secrecy.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Thulla and the other deep gnomes of Clan Ironhand journeyed down to the Underdark from Baldur's Gate, on mission to uncover the mythical substance known as ''[[runepowder]]''. While searching for the long-lost site known as [[Grymforge]], they were attacked by [[Cult of the Absolute|cultists of the Absolute]] led by [[Gekh Coal]] and other [[duergar]] slavers. While most of the gnomes were slain or taken captive by the cult, Thulla managed to get away with mere wounds. Unfortunately, the blade that cut her was laced with duergar [[poison]].",
        "Possessions": "At some point during or before their encounter, Thulla managed to steal Gekh's pair of ''[[boots of speed]]''."
