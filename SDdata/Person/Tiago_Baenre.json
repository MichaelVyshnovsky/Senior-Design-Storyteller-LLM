        "mainbody": "iago Baenre was the grandson of Dantrag Baenre and a noble of House Baenre in Menzoberranzan in the mid-to-late 15 century DR. Tiago and Ravel Xorlarrin were considered the most promising of Menzoberranzans young males.\nTiago was slender and had stylish short hair. He had an unusual \"whisper\" of a white mustache. He sometimes grew his hair out in 1484 DR, he had long white hair.\nBecause of his position in House Baenre, Tiago was quite powerfulâ€”and he knew it. He was confident in his position and was not averse to using his influence to casually but seriously threaten others. He also used his influence to sleep with the priestesses of House Xorlarrin, Berellip and Saribel, although as priestesses he maintained they had the right to refuse.\nIn 1463 DR, Tiago escorted Golfanin on the Xorlarrin expedition to Gauntlgrym. Tiago also served as the expeditions emissary to House Baenre, keeping Ravel Xorlarrin and his sisters in line and reminding them that he was reporting to Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre.\nOriginally, Tiago wanted to go to Gauntlgrym to obtain weapons from the legendary smith Golfanin in order to supplant Andzrel Baenre, the house weapons master. However, once he learned that he had missed out on a chance to kill Drizzt DoUrden, who had killed his grandfather, he was determined to atone for that mistake by killing Drizzt in order to turn himself into a legend. He began tracking Drizzt, following him to Icewind Dale, where in 1466 DR, Tiago defeated the returned demon Errtu, who himself was seeking Drizzt, on a plain outside of Bryn Shander, thus endearing himself to the city. A statue of Tiago was erected in commemoration of that event, but because of that event Drizzt was no longer welcome in that city.\nIn 1484 DR, Tiago learned of the presence of Drizzts companions in Port Llast and took Ambergris, Dahlia, Artemis Entreri, and Afafrenfere captive only Effron escaped. He held his prisoners in QXorlarrin until they were rescued by Drizzt DoUrden and the reborn Companions of the Hall. During that time, he also launched an assault on Clan Battlehammer in Icewind Dale, slaying leader Stokely Silverstream and taking many dwarves captive in the Battle of Kelvins Cairn.\nAlso in 1484 DR, Tiago was made the weapons master of the restored House DoUrden. He married Saribel Xorlarrin, who took his family name against drow custom because of the power associated with it. He assisted in the alliance of a number of drow with white dragons, frost giants, and orcs. While she led the orc forces against Nesme, Tiago besieged Sundabar with his forces. During this time, he frequently rode the white dragon Arauthator, who was integral to Sundabars defeat. Once Sundabar was taken, he returned to Nesme, where he and Saribel were deemed the Duke and Duchess of Nesme.\nFollowing these events, Tiago remained obsessed with defeating and killing Drizzt DoUrden. At the instigation of Yvonnel Baenre II, they had it out in Menzoberranzan, where Drizzt killed him and took his sword, shield, and armor.\nTiago carried a sword named Vidrinath (Lullaby) and shield named Orbbcress (Spiderweb), both forged by the legendary drow smith Golfanin in Gauntlgrym.\nTiago had a riding lizard named Byok, which was killed by Errtu.\nTiago was Dantrag Baenres grandson therefore the great grandson of Yvonnel Baenre and nephew of Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre. He worked as first assistant to his cousin, weapons master Andzrel Baenre.\nIn 1484 DR, Tiago married Saribel Xorlarrin she took his family name against drow custom.\nTiago and the wizard Ravel Xorlarrin were friends."
