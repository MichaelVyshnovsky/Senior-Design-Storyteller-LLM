'''Rauglothgor''' was a [[red dragon]] who became one of the first [[dracolich]]s created by [[Sammaster]].

By [[1357 DR]], the [[Cult of the Dragon]] under [[Symgharyl Maruel]] provided a new lair for Rauglothgor in a tower belonging to the wizard [[Garthond]], who had often fought the Cult.

In a twist of fate, in [[1357 DR]], Symgharyl Maruel captured a strange girl, [[Shandril Shessair]], the daughter of Garthond, and entrusted Rauglothgor with her custody. However, in a strange series of events involving [[Elminster Aumar]], the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]], a apprentice [[wizard]] and a [[balhiir]], it was discovered that Shandril had the power of the ''[[spellfire]]''. With her new powers, she blew apart Rauglothgor, the cult members, and much of the surrounding terrain.
