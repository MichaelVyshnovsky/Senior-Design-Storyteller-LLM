        "mainbody": "anley was an industrious miner who sought to reopen ore production in Phandalin in the late 14 century DR.\nDanley was a human man with blonde hair and a nervous demeanor. He had a tendency to unconsciously rub his hands together when stressed.\nIn the , Danley lived in resettled struggling Phandalin and frequented the Danley and Sons Inn in town. Danley assembled a group of fellow tough veterans of the Shadow War to clean the cold iron mines southeast of town in the Sword Mountains of their monstrous humanoid inhabitants and resume production. The plan came to a halt when two representatives of the so-called \"Cold Mining Company\" arrived in Phandalin and declared ownership of the mines. The representatives somehow quickly cleared out goblins, orcs, and other creatures who infested it. Danley suspected connections to a shady organization and was displeased that all cold iron was sold to some unknown party, with people of Phandalin receiving not a single copper from the operations. During that time, Danley could be found in Danley and Sons, drinking and looking for a group of daring adventurers willing to investigate the suspicious new organization. He was offering trade agreements to heroes willing to help â€“ selling them cold iron at a discounted price."
