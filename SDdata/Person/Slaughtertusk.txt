'''Slaughtertusk''' was a [[nalfeshnee]] agent of [[Baphomet]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], the [[demon lord]] Baphomet established himself in the [[Labyrinth]] in the [[Underdark]]. When he found the [[Maze Engine]] inside, he ordered Slaughtertusk to watch over the crevasse and prevent any creature from approaching the device.

==Personality==
Slaughtertusk was a bully at heart, and pleaded for its life against enemies stronger than it. It was bored by the task assigned to it but knew not to disobey the Horned King.
