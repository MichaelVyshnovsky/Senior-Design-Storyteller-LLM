        "mainbody": "'''Bael''' ({{Pronounce|bayl|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}}}} {{Pronounce|BAY|ul|alt=yes|refs={{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|19}}}}) was an [[archdevil]] duke of the [[Nine Hells]] who served the Lord of the Third, [[Mammon]]. He was one of Hell's greatest tacticians, named the Bronze General for the hue of his skin and various military accomplishments, but he was impeded in his ascendance to the rank of archduke by his lack of political prowess.",
        "Description": "Bael was sometimes depicted as either a [[toad]], [[cat]], male [[human]], or some combination of the three, but none of these reflected his actual appearance.\n\nIn reality, Bael resembled a muscular, golden-skinned [[humanoid]] somewhere over {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} in height.",
        "Personality": "Bael's passion laid squarely in the art of war, and he was apathetic to matters outside of that sphere. He had a lust for battle, and his primary interest had always been leading legions, but he was more than a mindless marauder.\n\nHowever, Bael still had his ambitions, and was frustrated by his inability to ascend further up Hell's hierarchy. While they would never do so directly, critics of Bael called him na√Øve, More clever and governmentally adept rivals constantly constrained his attempts to rise in rank.",
        "Powers": "Bael had [[truesight]], as well as the ability to perceive the corruption and [[alignment]] of those he looked at (unless disguised by [[undetectable alignment]] or a similar spell). His bite was poisonous, stealing away the vitality of those bitten.\n\nBael naturally regenerated from his injuries and resisted both acid and the cold, although the latter, along with radiant power, halted his regeneration. He could also radiate a dreadful aura of ''[[fear]]'' several feet around himself.\n\nBael had access to various spell-like abilities, including ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[inflict wounds]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[shapechange]]'', ''[[teleport]]'', and ''[[windwalk]]''. When drawn to fight, he used suggestion to lure others into range before unleashing inflict wounds on an entire group. Those who best resisted would be subjected to his ''[[dominate monster]]'' spell-like ability, which he could once or twice a day. Once per day, he could create a ''[[symbol of stunning]]'', and could summon somewhere between 1-6 barbazu with a high level of success.",
        "Possessions": "Bael's personal weapon was an enchanted [[morningstar]] with a long, bronze handle. The infernal weapon could magically extend in length, going from {{SIrange|4|8|ft|long=yes}} whenever the wielder so desired, as well as burn and wither its victims.{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|26}} If Bael actually had to use his morningstar, he likely considered things to have gone horribly wrong, but he would nonetheless charge into battle and hammer any enemy in his great reach.\n\nBael also wore a suit of bronze, [[plate mail|full-plate armor]] made in an ancient style and enchanted to better fortify the wearer.\n\nAlso among Bael's possessions was a ''[[ring of telekinesis]]'' and a ''[[rod of negation]]''.",
        "Realm": "Like Mammon's other vassal dukes, Bael ruled stretches of land far from the King of Greed's central domicile. His domain in the disgusting marsh of [[Minauros]] consisted of acres of volcanic ridges and lifeless, ashen woodlands somewhere between the layer's uplands and the swamplands where the prisoners were held.{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells|25}}",
        "Relationships": {
            "Servants": "Bael had command over the most troops in Minauros, leading 66 companies (over twenty-thousand) of barbazu with tactical genius."
        },
        "Worshipers": "Bael was glad to spare those he bested, although this was because he preferred to make servants out of enemies. Those who pledged their allegiance (and souls) to him would be bound to serve him, an offer of corruption over death that he presented to almost all beings with the notable, primary exception of demons. The Bronze General also welcomed mortals who could give him a political edge, recruiting such individuals and relying on their representation on his behalf in Mammon's court while he pursued his own interests.\n\nDespite, or possibly because of, his disinterest in all but warfare, Bael had a small cultist following. His worshipers called him, rather than [[Asmodeus]], the King of Hell, and the most deluded diabolists went so far as to believe that he was the master of all devils and infernal powers. Some occultists and supernatural texts (the [[Book of Fire]] for example) claimed that he had given the ''[[invisibility]]'' [[spell]] to mortals, although magic scholars and [[arcane]] practitioners hotly and universally denied this accusation of diabolical origin.",
        "History": "Over the eons of the Blood War, countless opportunities for power and prestige presented themselves to the devils of the Nine Hells. Bael seized upon many of these chances, and received fame and respect for his successes."
