        "History": "Non Lu Non hailed from a farming family of [[Wang Ku]] and this granted him direct knowledge about agriculture. His competence was noticed by the [[Emperor's Department of Scholarly Appointments]], which initially placed him in charge of the [[Department of Joyful Rebirth of the Soil]]. He was promoted to minister for his ability in the restoration of the [[Chukei Plateau]] and curing a rice blight. \n\nIn 1358 DR, he was concerned about the loss of the rice production of [[Chu' Yuan]] province, which forced his ministry to use many of his strategic rice reserves."
