        "mainbody": "Non Lu Non was the Minister of Agriculture of Shou Lung in 1358 DR.\nNon Lu Non hailed from a farming family of Wang Ku and this granted him direct knowledge about agriculture. His competence was noticed by the Emperors Department of Scholarly Appointments, which initially placed him in charge of the Department of Joyful Rebirth of the Soil. He was promoted to minister for his ability in the restoration of the Chukei Plateau and curing a rice blight. \nIn 1358 DR, he was concerned about the loss of the rice production of Chu Yuan province, which forced his ministry to use many of his strategic rice reserves."
