        "History": "Urz was a priest from [[House Jaelre]] who joined [[Malvag]]'s plot.\n\nUrz attacked [[Eilistraee]]'s shrine in the [[Gray Forest]], claiming the soul of a priestess.\n\nLater, he went to Malvag in a designated location to cast a spell that allowed Vhaeraun to enter Eilistraee's domain undetected.\n\nHe was later killed by his fellow [[Szorak]] (in truth, [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] in disguise).\n\nMalvag managed to resurrect him after the casting of the spell but the returned Urz explained that it was Eilistraee who had killed Vhaeraun and claimed his portfolio. Afterward, he descended into madness."
