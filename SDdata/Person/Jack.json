        "mainbody": "ack was a mysterious Red Wizard agent from the eastern nation of Thay, active in the 15 century DR.\nJack was a powerful spellcaster who used the school of necromancy in service of the Red Wizards. He possessed magics that temporarily made him invulnerable to magic and melee attacks. His favorite offensive magics included deadly black vapors and death bolts. Jack commanded a small force of boneshards, skeletons, blazing skeletons, chillborns, and zombies.\nFollowing the years of Spellplague sowing chaos in the city of Neverwinter, Jack was found performing his foul necromantic experiments in the Neverdeath graveyard of Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR. The mad Red Wizards laboratory was hidden within the ruins of ancient Illefarn, the fact that became known to Lord Never after Jacks correspondence was recovered by a band of heroes after venturing into the undead-infested Neverdeath. A group of heroes was soon after dispatched to Jacks laboratory by Doomguide Volahk who feared yet another grave plot of Thay."
