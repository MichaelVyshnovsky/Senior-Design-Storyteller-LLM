        "mainbody": "'''Roald Tunnelfist''' was a [[dwarf]] from [[Clan Battlehammer]], residing in [[Dwarven Valley]] of [[Kelvin's Cairn]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''What ye be wanting, stranger? Can't ye see I be into me cups?''|Roald Tunnelfist}}",
        "Description": "Roald Tunnelfist was a stout dwarven man with a grayish skin tone and light brown beard and hair. He wore a set of [[enchanted]] ''+2'' [[chainmail]] and carried a magical ''+2'' ''[[defender]]'' [[battleaxe]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Roald Tunnelfist and several other dwarves were tasked with scouting the slopes of Kelvin's Cairn, southeast of the town of [[Lonelywood]], to keep an eye on a suspicious congregation of the northern [[barbarian]]s –&nbsp; a historic threat to the [[Ten Towns]] and the dwarves of the Valley. Roald's gand was spotted, and they were attacked on sight. The barbarians gave chase, cornering the dwarves against a bluff. Roald and his group decided to fight and die and hopefully take some of the barbarians with them. Roald Tunnelfist was the last dwarf standing, surrounded by the bodies of his comrades. Suddenly, the barbarians stepped aside, allowing a giant of a man to step forward. The [[Reghedmen]] \"king\" who led the gathered tribes – [[Wylfdene]], stepped forward, bearing a giant [[double-bladed axe]]. The king attacked, Roald barely had a chance of blocking the deadly blow with his [[shield]]. Under the barbarian's relenting strength, the shield shattered, and Roald plummeted off the bluff.\n\nSometime later, Roald Tunnelfist came to it, surrounded by a mound of broken branches that slowed his fall. Badly hurt, the dwarf limped into the closest settlement – the town of Lonelywood. Since then, he has been staying at [[The Whistling Gallows]], licking his wounds, and even getting to meet the famed [[Heroes of Icewind Dale]], who were called to mitigate the barbarian threat. Roald shared the story of his encounter and pointed the heroes to where the barbarian camp was established, east of Lonelywood. He would eventually make his way back to Clan Battlehammer and update the elders on the looming threat. and the loss of dwarven lives."
