Fendlara Astarma was a young half-elven warrior and adventurer inhabiting Urmlaspyr in 1358 DR.
Fendlaras father was a passionate life-long vintner who produced red, white, and ros√© wines, notably, the Astarma White, a perfectly balanced fruity quality wine. Fendlara did not share the mans passion but traveled and represented the family winery on his behalf. Master Astarma hoped that she would eventually develop love for the wine business.
Fendlara was known for both her wild parties and crazy activity. She once swam across the Neck at night because of a dare.
