'''Fendlara Astarma''' was a young [[half-elven]] warrior and [[adventurer]] inhabiting [[Urmlaspyr]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Relationships==
Fendlara's father was a passionate life-long vintner who produced red, white, and ros√© [[wine]]s, notably, the [[Astarma White]], a perfectly balanced fruity quality wine. Fendlara did not share the man's passion but traveled and represented the family winery on his behalf. Master Astarma hoped that she would eventually develop love for the wine business.

==Activities==
Fendlara was known for both her wild parties and crazy activity. She once swam across the [[Neck]] at night because of a dare.
