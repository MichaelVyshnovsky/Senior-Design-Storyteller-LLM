==Description==
Djingo was a tan-skinned [[gold dwarf]] with brown eyes and trimmed thick black beard.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the city of Baldur's Gate shuddered under the [[Absolute crisis]], certain goods started to become rare and expensive. One such material that skyrocketed in price was [[saltpeter]]. Djingo had a multi-[[barrel]] stash of saltpeter and he charged at least 500 [[gold piece]]s per barrel, a high price as the dwarf knew that once Baldur's Gate was besieged, he'd easily sell it for double the amount to the Gate's [[steel watcher]] foundry. Several purchasers engaged in a missing war for the barrels: [[Pheebs Splayfoot‎‎]], [[Kaet Ling]], and [[Smiley Gheef]]. Gheef offered 700 gp per barrel, but the bidding war ended abruptly when Kaet Ling offered to pay 1,000 gp per barrel, in cash, no notes.
