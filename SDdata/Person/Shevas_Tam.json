        "mainbody": "'''Shevas Tam''' was one of the great [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] during the 11{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a member of the ancient and influential [[Tam]] family, and the father of the future [[zulkir]] of [[necromancy]], [[Szass Tam]].",
        "History": "During the first century of Thay's existence, the [[Guild of Portages]] was responsible for transporting goods overland, up the [[First Escarpment]] where the [[River Thay]] was not traversable by boat. They charged exorbitant fees for this service, to which Shevas Tam took particular exception. Rather than continue to pay [[gp|gold]] to the corrupt organization, he killed their guildmaster along with most of his lackeys and transformed them into [[undead]] creatures. \n\nShevas Tam thus established the [[long portage]], a trail of sorts through which hordes of [[zombie]]s carried goods from Thayan ships to another. This system of conveyance remained in use for well over 300 years and supplied the Tam family with a significant source of wealth."
