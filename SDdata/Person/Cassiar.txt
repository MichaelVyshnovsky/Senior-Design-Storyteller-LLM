'''Cassiar''' was the [[undead]] master who turned [[Jander Sunstar]] into an [[elf|elven]] [[vampire]].

==Description==
The master vampire was young looking with coppery red hair, pale skin, and large doe-like eyes. Cassiar preferred to wear fine clothing, such as [[leather]] [[boots]], [[calfskin]] gloves, and [[linen]] shirts.

==Personality==
Cassiar was an [[evil]] creature who delighted in controlling and forcing others to do heinous acts against humanity, such as drinking the blood of an infant.

==History==
In [[1072 DR]], Cassiar was once one of the master vampires that plagued [[Daggerdale]]. For this, he was pursued by a band of adventurers, including Jander Sunstar and the [[cleric]] of [[Ilmater]] [[Gideon]], among others. Cassiar was ambushed by the adventurers but escaped while killing most of the group.

After Cassiar turned Gideon into an undead beast, the two vampires hunted down Jander Sunstar and transformed him into a vampire too.
