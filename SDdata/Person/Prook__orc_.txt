'''Prook''' was a powerful [[orc]] chieftain of the [[Clotskull tribe]] in the 15{{th}} century DR. He was succeeded by the [[ettin]] [[Harglevargle]] after he died in his personal chambers in [[Ironaxe Halls]] due to a collapsed ceiling.

==Relationships==
Harglevargle, the ettin who would eventually succeed him as chieftain of the Clotskulls, served Prook as his bodyguard for many years.

==History==
Sometime in the 1460's DR, chieftain Prook led the Clotskull tribe below [[Mount Illefarn]] to hide from [[elf|elven]] hunters. Believing the site to have been abandoned by the [[shield dwarf|shield dwarves]] long ago, the Clotskulls were surprised to find resistance from the dwindling [[Clan Ironaxe|Ironaxe]] inhabitants, but were able to overwhelm them after many casualties.

In an attempt at brokering for his people's freedom, the defeated King [[Korin Ironaxe]] offered the Clotskulls food, riches, and a safe haven in the Ironaxe Halls. However, seeing that both the Clotskull orcs and Ironaxe dwarves were decimated to the point of near-extinction, Prook instead ordered his subjects to mate with their prisoners in order to ensure the tribe's survival.

Prook eventually met his end when the ceiling of his personal chambers collapsed on him. After a leadership struggle, his former bodyguard Harglevargle became the new chieftain of the Clotskull tribe. A dwarven prisoner was forced to sculpt a statue in Prook's image, but Harglevargle ordered the statue not be finished after being disappointed in the way it was turning out.
