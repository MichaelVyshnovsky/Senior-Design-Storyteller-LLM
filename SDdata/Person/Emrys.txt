Emrys was a Netherese arcanist and a friend of Tarchamus the Unyielding. 
Some time around , Tarchamus destroyed the Netherese floating city of Tenish using his volcano spell. After the destruction of Tenish, Emrys convinced the most powerful Netherese arcanists to block Tarchamuss access to the Weave, which must have required the intercession of Mystryl. 
Years after Tarchamus built his library, Emrys realized it was intended as a trap for Tarchamuss rivals. Emrys entered the library and placed many wards on the structure to make it impossible to scry and thus extremely difficult for anyone to locate. He removed the volcano scroll from the pedestal on which Tarchamus had placed it and hid it away in a secret room. However, Emrys met his end when he set off a poisoned arrow trap. His ghost haunted the library for millennia, though he was much less malevolent than the ghosts of Tarchamus apprentices.
