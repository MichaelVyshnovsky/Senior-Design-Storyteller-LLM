Pingtu was a deep gnome priest in Blingdenstone.
Pingtu was briefly an acolyte priest under high priest Bendekik before 1371 DR. Pingtu escaped the drow attack of that year.
In 1479 DR, Pingtu was back in the city and was the new head priest. However, when he tried a divination ritual, Pingtu heard the voice of his dead master.
