        "mainbody": "Azarell was a yochlol who disguised herself as a young elven warrior. She dwelt in the dwarven mines of Icewind Dale in the midâ€“14 century DR. She may have joined a group of adventurers on their journey to Menzoberranzan.\nShe could be found by adventurers in the derro mines and offered to \"watch over\" the party. She explained to them that she had been separated from her parents, though this was a lie. Azarell was most unusual, possessing incredible strength, and able to cast spells, despite being a fighter. It turned out that Azarell was actually a yochlol in disguise, and could have become aggressive if the party found out."
