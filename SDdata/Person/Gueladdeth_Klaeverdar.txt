Gueladdeth Klaeverdar was the matriarch of the Klaeverdar family of Elturel in the late 14 century DR.
She bred goats that she trained to never ate anything containing paper, or anything at all indoors.
Her most likely successors as of  were Meldrethe Klaeverdar and Andrath Klaeverdar.
She had six magically trained wolves, and dwelt in the ruins of Oldturret at Oldturret Farm, where she had stashed numerous spellbooks.
Gueladdeth was said to scry for items up and down the Sword Coast, which she retrieved by teleporting. She was also said to transform disobedient family members into goats.
