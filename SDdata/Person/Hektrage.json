        "mainbody": "'''Hektrage''' was a mad [[drow]] [[wizard]] and a [[giant spider]] enthusiast who served Matron Mother [[Azurna]] ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].\n{{quote|''I hold a spider to my eye. Its legs dangle in the sky. The magic of its web I scry. A weave is spindly limbs does ply â€“ hi there, I'm the spider guy.''|Hektrage}}",
        "Personality": "Hektrage was driven insane by Azurna's cruel punishment, while his love of poetry and love of spiders turned into an obsession. He often confused humanoids for his beloved spiders, whom he spent most of his time talking and reading his terrible poems to.",
        "Relationships": "Even though Azurna kept the insane drow around for his seeming talent of handling spiders, he still infuriated her by often pointing out that the power-hungry woman was nothing but a lesser Queen compared to Lolth, just a Queen of the Warrens.",
        "History": "Hektrage was once a powerful wizard in service of Azurna who was relentless in his quest for power. At one point, he was taken in as the High Priestess's concubine and a plaything. Eventually, Hektrage angered his mistress for his heretic views on matriarchy and the drow society. He was punished by being thrown in a deep hole with only spiders keeping him company for an indeterminably long time. He hoped to have been turned into a [[drider]] for his disgrace, but Azurna, knowing of his spider love, refused him the pleasure. While trapped in the spider hole, the wizard lost his mind and was alone long enough to almost forget his own name. Subsequently, his innate talents with the spiders became of value, and Azurna used the insane mage to train and lead her giant spiders in the quest against [[Waterdeep]] in 1370 DR. The mad wizard was stationed in the main drow stronghold in [[Undermountain]] surrounded by his arachnid friends. Theren an agent of [[Khelben Arunsun]] who was investigating the drow activities and seeking to end the threat to the City of Splendors came across the gibbering wizard. Hektrage unwittingly helped the adventurer, confusing him for one of the spiders and allowed the [[Khelbenite]] passage into the stronghold's inner chambers."
