'''Laeron''' was a decrepit [[mummy]] who dwelled in an [[Netherese tomb (Stonelands)|ancient Netherese tomb]] beneath the [[Stonelands]].{{DDO-time}}

==Abilities==
Laeron had a number of [[arcane]] [[spell]]s at his disposal, including ''[[chain lightning]]'', ''[[displacement]]'', ''[[Otiluke's freezing sphere]]'', ''[[protection from elements, mass]]'', and ''[[wail of the banshee]]''.

==History==
Laeron was interred in his tomb with a number of other [[undead]] and servitors, including [[wheep]]s, [[quell]]s, [[skeleton warrior|skeletons]], and [[tomb guardian]] constructs. Around the time of the [[Darkening]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[adventurer]]s [[Jarus Brithandir]], [[Kirina Aelorothi]], [[Tristran of Daggerford]], [[Popkin Shortshanks]], [[Helayna]], and [[Liantor Stoneborn]] discovered the tomb and cut their way through a few of the guardians before finding a passage hidden behind Laeron's throne. The adventurers passed deeper underground into natural caverns below the tomb, and by the time Laeron was up and about they were long gone. A second wave of invaders arrived to rescue the first group, and while Laeron and his minions put up a strong fight he was destroyed.
