Yahun al-Hattab was the elder kahin for the House of Dubb tribe in the High Desert of west Zakhara around 1367 DR.
Since Sheikh Yaqub al-Quwwat was prone to drop everything in favor of hunting with friends, most of the duties of running the tribe fell on the shoulders of Yahun. Yahun had a vision that the young sheikh would die alone without fathering any children. Yahun was considered a wise elder, though after recommending Yaqub as the next sheikh he later doubted himself.
