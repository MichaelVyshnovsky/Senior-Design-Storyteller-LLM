        "mainbody": "'''Berenn''' was a [[fire giant]] [[cleric]] and a servant of the [[Bhaalspawn]], [[Yaga-Shura]].",
        "Possessions": "Berenn owned many [[gem]]s such as [[emerald]]s and [[pearl]]s. He, if not spellcasting, fought with a weakly enchanted two-handed [[sword]]. The fire giant cleric also owned a [[balor]]'s claw, which could be combined with another item to create a powerful artifact.",
        "History": "When [[Gorion's Ward]] and group entered the second level of the fire giant temple in the Forest of Mir, Berenn noticed them. He let the other giants know that intruders had entered the \"sacred\" temple and shouted that the fire of his master could never be extinguished. He may have been slain by Gorion's Ward."
