Olgala Zug was a bloodforge mage in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).
Olgala Zug brazenly laid claim to the pass in the Web Mountains and extracted a toll from travelers. However, the leader of the Legendary Campaign elected to fight a bloodforge battle against Zug instead.
