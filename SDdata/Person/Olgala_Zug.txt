'''Olgala Zug''' was a [[bloodforge]] mage in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

Olgala Zug brazenly laid claim to the pass in the [[Web Mountains]] and extracted a toll from travelers. However, the leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] elected to fight a bloodforge battle against Zug instead.
