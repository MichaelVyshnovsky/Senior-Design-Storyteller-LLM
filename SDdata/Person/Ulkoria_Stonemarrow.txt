Ulkoria Stonemarrow was an archmage representative of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors in Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR.
Ulkoria once owned the tavern in Trollskull Manor and had followed all the different owners of the place.
In 1492 DR, Ulkoria went to check on the new owners of the place.
Ulkoria had always at her side her shield guardian. Many nicknamed her "the Gargoyle" as her face was frozen in a scowl.
