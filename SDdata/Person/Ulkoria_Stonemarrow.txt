'''Ulkoria Stonemarrow''' was an [[archmage]] representative of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

Ulkoria once owned the tavern in [[Trollskull Manor]] and had followed all the different owners of the place.

In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} Ulkoria went to check on the new owners of the place.

==Relationship==
Ulkoria had always at her side her [[shield guardian]]. Many nicknamed her "the Gargoyle" as her face was frozen in a scowl.
