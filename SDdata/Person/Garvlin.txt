Garvlin was a barbed devil in service to the pit fiend Kurgaloth.
In the late 15 century DR, Garvlin was one of many lesser devils brought to the Lightfinger Estate in Waterdeep to enforce a lapsed contract between Kurgaloth and the Lightfinger family. Garvlin was assigned to guard the approach to the mansion.
When adventurers arrived to investigate the chaos that the devils arrival had caused, Garvlin was the first devil they encountered. Garvlin was defeated in the ensuing battle but managed to escape, thus avoiding being banished back to Avernus.
