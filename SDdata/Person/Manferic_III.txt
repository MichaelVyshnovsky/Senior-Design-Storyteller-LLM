Manferic III was the king of Ankhapur.
Manferics goal was immortality but for his vanity he also wanted to maintain a good appearance and continue ruling his city.
Manferic ruled Ankhapur with an iron hand and a touch of sadism. In 1366 DR, he became a lich and started a plot to obtain the body of his bastard son Janol Famisso to inhabit. However, in the end, Janol proved to be more capable than him and Manferic was destroyed by Janol and his allies.
