'''Prebek''' was an apprentice [[mage]] who lived in the city of [[Athkatla]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''No! The master would skin us and do his strange little dance on our hides if we fail his test! Come on, let us attack!''|Prebek}}

==Relationships==
Prebek served the [[Zhentarim]] [[necromancer]] alongside his fellow apprentice [[Sanasha]] under the apprenticeship of the mad necromancer [[Xzar]].

==Possessions==
The necromancer wore a ''[[mage robe of fire resistance]]'' and was armed with a simple [[dagger]]. He also carried two ''[[wands of magic missiles]]'', a ''[[potion of insight]]'' and several [[spell]] scrolls.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Prebek, Sanasha, and Xzar were conducting [[magic]]al experiments to create monsters that resembled [[goblin]]s. Both young mages were jumpy and wary of intruders, apparently, at least on one occasion, Xzar sent intruders to Prebek's house in the [[Athkatla/Wave District|Wave District]] as a test. The master was indeed a cruel man. Once, Xzar pulled three toenails off Prebek's foot for simply miscasting a [[cantrip]]. At the time they were being investigated by the Athkatlan branch of the [[Harpers]]. Prebek, Sanasha, and his "creations" may have been ordered killed by Harper [[Rylock]].
