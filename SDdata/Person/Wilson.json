        "Personality": "While Wilson was in fact a gentle and sophisticated bear, he was also described as being \"of a slashing temperament\".\n\nLike other bears, Wilson did not enjoy the taste of [[potion]], with the exception of ''[[potions of healing]]''.",
        "Abilities": "In contrast to his typical tender nature, Wilson was capable of entering into a rage in combat. During this time he became impervious to a variety of ill effects.\n\nWhile others could seemingly understand Wilson's snorts and growls, he was unable to communicate in [[Common]].",
        "Relationships": "Along with the other individuals of the [[hidden refuge]], Wilson counted the [[elven]] [[alchemist]] [[Zaviak]] among his friends.",
        "History": "Wilson was named after his father, who was believed to have also been a bear.\n\nSome time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Wilson was captured and imprisoned by the animal trader [[Jolstead]]."
