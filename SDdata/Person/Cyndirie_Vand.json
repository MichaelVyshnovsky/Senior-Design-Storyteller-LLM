He's entirely too slick to be trustworthy. Just wait. You'll see that I'm right about Lord Gortash.|Cyndirie Vand}}",
        "Description": "Cyndirie was a [[human]] woman with a light skin tone, dark brown eyes, and light brown hair gathered in a loose bun. Her quality doublet indicated she was a woman of means.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Cyndirie Vand was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. She could often be found in a large company of friends, including [[Buff Tanner]], occupying one of the large guest tables at the tavern. Like every citizen of the Gate, Cyndirie had strong opinions on the refugee crisis caused by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] as well as Lord [[Enver Gortash]]. Unlike many other Baldurians, she did not trust Gortash, seeing through his slimy charisma."
