        "mainbody": "'''Charleston Nib''' was an archaeologist who lived on the [[Sword Coast]], for at least a short time, during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He believed in scholarly pursuits and believed his findings were best suited for display in Faerûnian museums.",
        "Relationships": "While Charleston seemed blissfully unaware, his \"partner\" [[Gallor]] was not happy with the altruistic nature of their operations.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Charleston and his dig team were excavating the ruined village of a \"primitive\" race that had gone extinct ages before. While Charleston was confident about the purposes of the various rooms they dug out, little else was known about the extinct society. They were known to worship the [[Bedine]]/[[Netherese pantheon|Netherese deity]] of [[Kozah]]."
