        "Possessions": "She owned a magical ''[[tunic of blending]]''.",
        "Activities": "Katyr and Annelwin kept a vigil over the forests of northern [[Tethyr]], keeping merchants safe and treating injured animals.

        "History": "Annelwin hailed from [[Brost]], but became a full member of the Elmanesse elf tribe."
