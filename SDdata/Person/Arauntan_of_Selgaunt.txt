'''Arauntan of Selgaunt''' (the '''Wandering Wizard''') was a wizard from [[Selgaunt]]. He is notable because in [[1351 DR]], he recalled that three brothers in [[Harrowdale]] had dramatically changed their appearance.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/Harrowdale}}

==History==
In 1351 DR, Arauntan was described as a "three-hundred-year-old wizard" so he was born in or prior to [[1051 DR]].

A farmstead in Harrowdale was home to three brothers from [[Sembia]]: Torstan, Ulbaern, and Durthar Morgath. However, on the morning after "fey blue mage-fire" was seen above the farmstead, Arauntan swore that the appearances of these brothers had become those of Lord [[Elmaer Oraun]] (formerly Lord of Harrowdale circa 1180 DR), his son [[Erammon Oraun]], and his swordmaster [[Thaeron]], who had disappeared centuries earlier at the [[Battle of Marak's Stile]]. Durthar Morgath would later, during the [[second inter-dale war]], declare himself "Thaeron, Rightful Swordmaster of Harrowdale".
