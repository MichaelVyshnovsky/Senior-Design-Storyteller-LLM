This means Kelson is either a [[cleric]] or a [[ranger]]; this article assumes the latter since he has been a ranger in all previous appearances.

'''Kelson Darktreader''' was a [[half-elf]] [[ranger]] in [[Daggerford]] in the 14{{th}}

==Personality==
Kelson was a man of very few words. He really like being a guide for the duke's hunts or teaching the secrets of the wild to young rangers. His decision to go against the [[Thayan]]s had less to do with fighting evil but more with protecting [[Shalendra Floshin]] and showing her that his half-elf blood was worth more than she once thought. Kelson, however, also couldn't resist the idea of a last mission against the forces of evil.

==History==
Kelson was the grandson of [[Elorfindar Floshin]] and a nephew of [[Darfin Floshin]]. He worked as hunt master for the dukes of Daggerford for generations, starting with Duke [[Pryden Daggerford]].

In 1486 DR, he agreed to a last mission against the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] based in Daggerford.

His home in Daggerford was located along the northern stretch of [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]] near [[Delfen's Tower]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
