Kellindil was an elf archer and a member of Dove Falconhands traveling party in the .
When he encountered Drizzt DoUrden, he challenged him, ignoring his pleas to parley and attacked him, however, Drizzt managed to escape. Believing in the end that the drow was an exception to his races reputation, he promised Dove to keep track of him and watch his actions. He then left a healing potion and a dagger behind for Drizzt to use.
Kellindil kept his promise and followed Drizzt to Mooshies Grove, where he saw the battle that ensued between the rangers and the forces assembled by Roddy McGristle. In the aftermath of the battle, he pursued Roddy and tied him up to have him tried for his crimes in Sundabar, mainly against Montolio Debrouchee and Drizzt DoUrden, as he was the one who led an army of orcs and winter wolves against them in Mooshies Grove. However, Tephanis cut Roddys bindings and Roddy strangled the elf with his bare hands. Then he buried him and whatever supplies he couldnt carry.
