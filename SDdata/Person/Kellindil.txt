'''Kellindil''' was an [[elf]] archer and a member of [[Dove Falconhand]]'s traveling party in the {{yearlinkName|1340}}.

==History==
When he encountered [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], he challenged him, ignoring his pleas to parley and attacked him, however, Drizzt managed to escape. Believing in the end that the drow was an exception to his race's reputation, he promised Dove to keep track of him and watch his actions. He then left a [[healing potion]] and a dagger behind for Drizzt to use.

Kellindil kept his promise and followed Drizzt to [[Mooshie's Grove]], where he saw the battle that ensued between the rangers and the forces assembled by [[Roddy McGristle]]. In the aftermath of the battle, he pursued Roddy and tied him up to have him tried for his crimes in [[Sundabar]], mainly against [[Montolio Debrouchee]] and Drizzt Do'Urden, as he was the one who led an army of [[orc]]s and [[winter wolves]] against them in Mooshie's Grove. However, [[Tephanis]] cut Roddy's bindings and Roddy strangled the elf with his bare hands. Then he buried him and whatever supplies he couldn't carry.
