Parlek Lateriff was a sage, sorcerer, and smith in the Mountainside ward of Waterdeep. He made replica and counterfeit jewelry for nobles, who paid him quite handsomely.
In 1479 DR, Parlek was approached by Renaer Neverember and his companions, who were on the run from the law after making an enemy of Khondar "Ten-Rings" Naomal. Renaer convinced Parlek to let them hide in his house in exchange for The Annals of Kyrah, three volumes that Parlek had long sought.
A tenday later, Parlek was invited with many others to become a member of the group that Renaer was founding at Roarke House to replace the Moonstars.
