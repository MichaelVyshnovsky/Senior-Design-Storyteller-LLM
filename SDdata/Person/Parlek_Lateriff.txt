'''Parlek Lateriff''' was a sage, sorcerer, and smith in the [[Mountainside]] ward of [[Waterdeep]]. He made replica and counterfeit jewelry for nobles, who paid him quite handsomely.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], Parlek was approached by [[Renaer Neverember]] and his companions, who were on the run from the law after making an enemy of [[Khondar Naomal|Khondar "Ten-Rings" Naomal]]. Renaer convinced Parlek to let them hide in his house in exchange for ''[[The Annals of Kyrah]]'', three volumes that Parlek had long sought.

A tenday later, Parlek was invited with many others to become a member of the group that Renaer was founding at [[Roarke House]] to replace the [[Moonstars]].
