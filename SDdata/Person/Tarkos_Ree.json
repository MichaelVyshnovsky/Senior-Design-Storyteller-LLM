He killed all people who crossed him and guilds members who did not follow Tarkos instructions. However, he truly protected the citys merchants from unaffiliated thieves. Tarkos also truly protected Dimian from the shadows.\nTarkos believed in logic, being purely pragmatic. He decided to support his cousins claim to the throne because the guild would greatly expand its sphere of influence if he won it.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryThieves\nCategoryCrime lords\nCategoryInhabitants of Heliogabalus\nCategoryInhabitants of Morov\nCategoryInhabitants of Damara\nCategoryInhabitants of the Bloodstone Lands\nCategoryInhabitants of the Cold Lands\nCategoryInhabitants of Northeast Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\ntmt13qwqs2s460r7r0kbi5zozmdtfwv"
