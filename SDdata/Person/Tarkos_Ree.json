        "Relationships": "Tarkos was the cousin of [[Dimian Ree]], baron of [[Morov]].",
        "Activities": "Tarkos was the head of the [[Tightpurse]] thieves guild, being probably the most powerful being in [[Heliogabalus]]. He killed all people who crossed him and guild's members who did not follow Tarkos' instructions. However, he truly protected the city's merchants from unaffiliated thieves. Tarkos also truly protected Dimian from the shadows.",
        "Personality": "Tarkos believed in logic, being purely pragmatic. He decided to support his cousin's claim to the throne because the guild would greatly expand its sphere of influence if he won it.",
