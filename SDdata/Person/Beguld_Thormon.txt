'''Beguld Thormon''' was a merchant who lived in [[Crimmor]] in [[Amn]] in the 14th century [[DR]].

==History==
Beguld was well respected over a long career, but was murdered by [[doppelganger]] sometime in the summer of [[1342 DR|Year of the Behir, 1342 DR]]. The doppelganger adopted his identity and carried on his trade.

In a market in Crimmor in the [[1343 DR|Year of the Boot, 1343 DR]], "Beguld Thormon" ran a stall dealing in "treasures for the adventurous". The doppelganger came into the possession of the ''[[Tome of Torment]]''—the holiest book of the [[church of Ilmater]]. This had been thought lost in the winter when the [[Graycloak's Wolves]] adventuring company transporting it was slain—also by doppelgangers. "Beguld" sold the ''Tome'' for 20,000 [[gp]] to a group of [[Thay]]an agents who dealt in a number of criminal enterprises: kidnapping, slavery, smuggling, and the fencing and transport of stolen property. Ilmatari investigators later uncovered the doppelganger's true nature when they tracked down the ''Tome''.
