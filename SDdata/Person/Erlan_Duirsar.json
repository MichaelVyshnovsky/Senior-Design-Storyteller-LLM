        "mainbody": "High Lord Erlan Duirsar, also called Lord Duirsar and \"Watcher Over the Hills\", was the leader of the Hill Elders, the rulers of Evereska.\nHe was short and thin with silver hair and a face that showed signs of age.\nHigh Lord Duirsar was a trusted, capable and decisive commander and leader for more than two centuries.\nHe once created his own mist golem, a magical construct that resembled a being of \"hard air\", similar to that of a wall of force.\nThough he longed to protect Evereska from the outside world, since the phaerimm siege, High Lord Duirsar worked to move toward a more open relationship with the citys neighbors. He understood the true potential of the Netherese threat, respected the efforts to rebuild Myth Drannor, and embraced the end of the Retreat.\nDuirsar also commanded the Cold Hand&mdashan elite military company composed of Evereskas finest warriors\nHe was aided by his trusted messenger, a finch named Manynests that fluttered around Evereska speaking with elves at his behest.\nIn the , Lord Duirsar directed Evereskas high mages to the ancestral crypts of House Vyshaan in the Greycloak Hills, under escort by Kiinyon Colbathin the Evereskan Tomb Guard, in order to repair the tear in the Sharn Wall deep underground. As the phaerimm escaped from the Sharn Wall and began to wreak havoc along the outer reaches of the Evereska Vale, Duirsar coordinated the realms defense, again entrusting in the command of Tomb Master Colbathin despite his previous failures.\nMonths into the , Evereska had fallen under siege by the phaerimm entirely. In Mirtul of that year, Lord Duirsar worked with the archmage of Waterdeep—and stalwart ally of Evereska—Khelben Arunsun to strategize how the city could hold out through the siege of the phaerimm. When Evereskas mythal was on the verge of failing, Duirsar gave the final command that Khelben and the Company of the Cold Hand should leave the protection of the citys magical barrier and fight the phaerimm to ensure they did not overwhelm the city."
