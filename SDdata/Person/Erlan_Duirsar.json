        "mainbody": "High Lord '''Erlan Duirsar''', also called '''Lord Duirsar''' and \"Watcher Over the Hills\", was the leader of the [[Hill Elders]], the rulers of [[Evereska]].\n\n{{Quote|If we fail we lose everything. We have been failing for the last four months, it's time to take a chance. Call the charge.|Lord Duirsar, to [[Khelben Arunsun]], [[Mirtul 20]] [[1372 DR]].}}",
        "Description": "He was short and thin with silver hair and a face that showed signs of age.",
        "Personality": "High Lord Duirsar was a trusted, capable and decisive commander and leader for more than two centuries.",
        "Possessions": "He once created his own [[mist golem]], a magical construct that resembled a being of \"hard air\", similar to that of a ''[[wall of force]]''.",
        "Activities": "Though he longed to protect Evereska from the outside world, since the [[phaerimm]] siege, High Lord Duirsar worked to move toward a more open relationship with the city's neighbors. He understood the true potential of the Netherese threat, respected the efforts to rebuild Myth Drannor, and embraced the end of the Retreat.\n\nDuirsar also commanded the [[Company of the Cold Hand|Cold Hand]]&mdash;an elite military company composed of Evereska's finest warriors",
        "Relationships": "He was aided by his trusted messenger, a [[finch]] named [[Manynests]] that fluttered around Evereska speaking with elves at his behest.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Lord Duirsar directed Evereska's [[elven high mage|high mages]] to the ancestral crypts of [[House Vyshaan]] in the [[Greycloak Hills]], under escort by [[Kiinyon Colbathin]] the Evereskan [[Tomb Guard]], in order to repair the tear in the [[Sharn Wall]] deep underground. As the phaerimm escaped from the Sharn Wall and began to wreak havoc along the outer reaches of the [[Evereska Vale]], Duirsar coordinated the realm's defense, again entrusting in the command of Tomb Master Colbathin despite his previous failures.\n\nMonths into the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Evereska had fallen under siege by the phaerimm entirely. In [[Mirtul]] of that year, Lord Duirsar worked with the [[archmage]] of [[Waterdeep]]—and stalwart ally of Evereska—[[Khelben Arunsun]] to strategize how the city could hold out through the siege of the phaerimm. When Evereska's ''[[mythal]]'' was on the verge of failing, Duirsar gave the final command that Khelben and the [[Company of the Cold Hand]] should leave the protection of the city's magical barrier and fight the phaerimm to ensure they did not overwhelm the city."
