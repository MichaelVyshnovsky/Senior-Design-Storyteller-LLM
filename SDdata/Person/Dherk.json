        "mainbody": "Dherk was the leader of the Razorhides in the late 14 century DR.\nDherk was a tall man in his twenties, with many tattoos and scars. He wore spiked leather armor and kept his arms bared.\nA hardened criminal, Dherk was bloodthirsty, but not without fear and he could be cowed into compliance. His loyalty to those stronger than him only lasted until someone stronger came by, however.\nHe could throw knives very quickly and precisely, finding his targets throat before they even saw the knife.\nThe warlock Japheth Donard strong-armed Dherk into tributing him thirty percent of the daily profits of the Razorhides at some point in , leaving behind a quickly made construct.\nDherk was rumored to have killed a whole family by blocking the exits to their home and then setting fire to it."
