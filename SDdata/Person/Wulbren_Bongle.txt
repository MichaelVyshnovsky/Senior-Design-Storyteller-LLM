{{Quote|Our return to [[Baldur's Gate]] will usher in a new era for the Ironhand Gnomes. The realm deserves the benefit of our genius.|Wulbren Bongle.}}

==Relationships==
Wulbren placed a gravestone for his father, [[Antunio Bongle]], at the [[Lower City Graveyard|Lower City Graveyard of Baldur's Gate]].

It is not known about Wulbren's relations with his mother, but circa 1492 [[DR]] Barcus wanted to write a letter to her trying to find out information about his whereabouts.

Wulbren was a childhood friend of [[Barcus Wroot]]. Later Barcus left the Underdark for the surface city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. When Wulbren was living in the [[Decrepit Village]], he wrote a [[Spattered Diary|diary]], from which we know that he was asking himself if he will ever see Barcus again.

He was familiar with a famous smith from [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]], [[Gyldro Angleiron]], who accommodated the Ironhand Gnomes in his [[Angleiron's Cellar|cellar]] and kept their location secret.

==Possessions==

Wulbren once had an [[Wulbren's amulet|amulet]], which was lost when he got captured by [[duergar]]s. It was subsequently discovered by Barcus in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate, prompting him to embark on a journey to find and help his friend.

Wulbren had a [[Wulbren's hammer|hammer]], which he was deprived of when he was imprisoned in the [[Moonrise Towers]].

==History==
Wulbren was a descendant of [[Wolverforce Bongle]], who according to the book ''[[Ironhand Gnomes: Our Grievances]]'' once spoke to [[Gaerdal Ironhand]]. As his relatives, Wulbren was obsessed with the hatred towards the [[Gondians]] who, as he thought, once stole the technologies of Clan Ironhand and later even started to serve lord [[Enver Gortash]], whom Wulbren considered a tyrant.

His clan once helped Sarevok Anchev and was exiled from Baldur's Gate. He engaged in a relentless struggle to repair his clan's reputation, especially when confronted by Gondian critics.

Around the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Wulbren and the other deep gnomes of the Ironhand Clan were surveying the areas around the [[Ebonlake]] and conducted 42 expeditions. The main purpose was the work with [[runepowder]]. That year the Decrepit Village, which served as a base for their surveys, was pillaged by the duergars of the [[Clan Flameshade]] serving the [[Cult of the Absolute|cultists of the Absolute]]. He later was transferred to the Moonrise Towers' prison where he was detained with [[Nimble]] and [[Nickels]].

The fate of the prisoners of the Cult of the Absolute remains unknown, but some rumors say that if Wulbren didn't die, he continued his fight against lord Gortash and the Gondians, mainly through covert activities against the [[Steel Watch]] and the invention of the [[runepowder bomb]] in the Angleiron's Cellar.
