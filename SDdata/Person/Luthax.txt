Luthax was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the 7 century DR. After death, he was resurrected as a ghazneth.
He was senior officer to Thanderahast. He had Elmariel Emmarask as a trusted friend.
Luthax had a protruding belly under his robes. He had a furrowed face and a large nose, a shaved-bald head and a well-groomed beard. 
As ghazneth, his legs were underdeveloped, so he depended largely on his wings to pick up a decent running speed.
In the , Luthax conspired with Elmariel Emmarask, who had brought back a magical beast from the ruins of Netheril. They aimed to kill King Draxius Obarskyr, but their plot was foiled when Thanderahast alerted the king. Amedahast found the conspirators and detonated her magical staff, killing herself, Elmariel, and the others in the room.
However, Luthax survived somehow, because he was seen by Thanderahast in the Battle with the Witch Lords nearly 300 years later, in the .
Eventually, he was resurrected as the fifth ghazneth in the , but it remained unknown what tree he was buried under or exactly when he died.
