'''Luthax''' was a [[War Wizards|War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]] in the 7{{th}} century [[DR]]. After death, he was resurrected as a [[ghazneth]].

==Relationships==
He was senior officer to [[Thanderahast]]. He had [[Elmariel Emmarask]] as a trusted friend.

==Description==
Luthax had a protruding belly under his robes. He had a furrowed face and a large nose, a shaved-bald head and a well-groomed beard. 

As ghazneth, his legs were underdeveloped, so he depended largely on his wings to pick up a decent running speed.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|629}}, Luthax conspired with Elmariel Emmarask, who had brought back a magical beast from the ruins of [[Netheril]]. They aimed to kill King [[Draxius Obarskyr]], but their plot was foiled when Thanderahast alerted the king. [[Amedahast]] found the conspirators and detonated her magical [[staff]], killing herself, Elmariel, and the others in the room.

However, Luthax survived somehow, because he was seen by Thanderahast in the [[Battle with the Witch Lords]] nearly 300 years later, in the {{YearlinkName|900}}.

Eventually, he was resurrected as the fifth [[ghazneth]] in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, but it remained unknown what tree he was buried under or exactly when he died.
