Choosing the completely loyal Matsutomo clan to lead it, he appointed Arata Matsutomo as its first daimyo the Matsutomos dutifully relocated to Aru.\nArata served ably for two decades, until , when bandits aided by unidentified supernatural creatures (tengu being one possibility) massacred a large pilgrim train in one of the mountain passes. The shogun reprimanded Arata for this failure of security. The next year, Aratas samurai guarded the next pilgrim train, but they too were attacked and slaughtered to a man. The shogun removed Arata and the Matsutomos from power, passing the province to the Toda clan."
