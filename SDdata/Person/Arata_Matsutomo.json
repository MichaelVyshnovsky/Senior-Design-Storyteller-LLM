        "mainbody": "'''Arata Matsutomo''' was a head of the [[Matsutomo]] clan and a [[daimyo]] of [[Aru Province]] in [[Wa]] in the early 1600s on the [[Wa Calendar]].",
        "History": "In {{YearlinkConvert|1608|WY}}, the [[shogun]] [[Eiko]] officially recognized the settlement of [[Aru]] and decreed it the capital of the new Aru Province. Choosing the completely loyal Matsutomo clan to lead it, he appointed Arata Matsutomo as its first daimyo; the Matsutomos dutifully relocated to Aru.\n\nArata served ably for two decades, until {{YearlinkConvert|1627|WY}}, when bandits aided by unidentified supernatural creatures ([[tengu]] being one possibility) massacred a large [[pilgrim]] train in one of the mountain passes. The shogun reprimanded Arata for this failure of security. The [[1210 DR|next year]], Arata's samurai guarded the next pilgrim train, but they too were attacked and slaughtered to a man. The shogun removed Arata and the Matsutomos from power, passing the province to the [[Toda]] clan."
