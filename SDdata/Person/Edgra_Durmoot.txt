Edgra Durmoot was the Speaker of Dougans Hole, in the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale, during the late 15 century DR.
Edgra was not a particularly talkative woman, but outspoken and gruff when she did choose to speak. She had the true grit of someone who lived a tough life her worn appearance and scarred skin was evidence of such.
She took little consideration about the Speakers from the other Ten Towns and didnt worry about attending council meetings during the warmer months of the year.
