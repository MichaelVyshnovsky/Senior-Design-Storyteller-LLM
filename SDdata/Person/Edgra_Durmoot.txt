'''Edgra Durmoot''' was the Speaker of [[Dougan's Hole]], in the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]], during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Edgra was not a particularly talkative woman, but outspoken and gruff when she did choose to speak. She had the true grit of someone who lived a tough life; her worn appearance and scarred skin was evidence of such.

==Activities==
She took little consideration about the Speakers from the other Ten Towns and didn't worry about attending council meetings during the warmer months of the year.
