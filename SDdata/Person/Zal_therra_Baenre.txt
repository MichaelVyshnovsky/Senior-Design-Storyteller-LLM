Zaltherra Baenre was a cousin of Triel Baenre and commander of the rearguard of the Army of the Black Spider in 1372 DR. She was the most promising of Triels cousins.
She was a foot taller than Triel and was a good 30 pounds heavier.
Zaltherra was one of the most promising attendants of Triel. During the Silence of Lolth, when enemy armies marched to Menzoberranzan, Zaltherra was chosen as one of the commanders of the Army of the Black Spider, put in control of the rearguard. She was the highest-ranking House Baenre member of the army and Triel usually interacted with Zaltherra instead of the titular commander MezBarris Armgo.
In the battle against the armies of Gracklstugh at the Pillars of Woe, the army was betrayed by the plans of Nimor Imphraezl and House Agrach Dyrr sided with the invaders, causing the defeat of the drow.
Very disappointed with Zaltherra for not acknowledging the enemys plan, Triel ordered her to block the enemys path with her troops, gaining time for the majority of the army to retreat. This was considered a suicide mission and Triel commented that if it was Lolths will, Zaltherra would survive.
