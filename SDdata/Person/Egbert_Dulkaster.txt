Egbert Dulkaster the Third was a rich and self-important member of one of the most successful Waterdeep family mercantile organizations, the Dulkaster and Sons who has managed a good part of the Sword Coast trading for centuries in the late 14 century DR.
Egbert Dulkaster was a middle-aged male always dressed in well-tailored expensive elegant silk clothes of the latest fashion. He had poshly-groomed mustache with graying silvery strands of hair.
Egbert Dulkasters voice was described as slippery, reminiscent of a melting icicle, dripping with water.
Egbert was quite pompous, eloquent, and was surrounded by the air of superiority. He did not like to mingle with the commoners. He was excessively proud of his family name, and the familys prosperous trading business. Egbert was very easily deceived if her were to believe he was conversing with a sophisticated noble-person, especially if the person knew a thing or two about fashion.
Egbert Dulkaster was a valued client of Raffaldini of Waterdeep, a famous halfling tailor for the most wealthy noble families across Faer√ªn.
Egbert Dulkaster spent many summers growing up in Archendale, fishing with his grandfather in the River Arkhen.
In 1372 DR, Egbert Dulkaster the Third could be found within the Chateau Elite, the most expensive and pompous inn in the city, during his business visit to Daggerford. His room was just one door away from the spy Astriel Shalyn who was staying at the inn at  the same time. He was hiding inside his room, when the Zhentarim assassins attempted to assassinate her a few days after her arrival.
