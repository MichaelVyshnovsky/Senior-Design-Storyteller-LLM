'''Gulkin Hammerlin''' was a surly carpenter in [[High Dale]].

==History==
Gulkin was for a brief time a mercenary hailing from [[Daerlun]] before he settled in High Dale. When in [[1358 DR]] a secret [[Zhent]] occupation army occupied the dale, Gulkin was a member of the [[Council of the High Dale]]. Gulkin hated all usurpers and especially the wizards.
