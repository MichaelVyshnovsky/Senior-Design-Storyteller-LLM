        "mainbody": "'''Habib Khalid Achmed Allafif''' was an [[scimitar]]-wielding [[thief]] from the city of [[Athkatla]] in the midâ€“to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''No! My name is Habib Khalid Achmed Allafif, and I cannot be captured! I will throw my mighty scimitar at your head rather than suffer the indignity of prison! Hiiii-YAA!''|Habib Khalid Achmed Allafif}}",
        "History": "Originally from [[Calimshan]], Habib made a living through thievery in Athkatla. In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Habib thought himself to be pursued by Athkatla's law enforcement. He may have run into [[Abdel Adrian]] one night and confused him with the city guard; the thief proudly proclaimed his name and launched his scimitar at the adventurer. It was apparently not the first time a scimitar was thrown at an innocent party, as the thief eventually made his way to a shrine to [[Ilmater]] in Athkatla's [[Waukeen's Promenade]] to pray for forgiveness for attacks and the illicit profession. Yet again, when Abdel came across Habib at Ilmater's shrine, the thief threw a handful of [[gold]] coins at the adventurer and escaped, confusing him with the guard."
