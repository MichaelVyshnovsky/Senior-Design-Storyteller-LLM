Illiymbrim Sharnult was a mage at some point before the 8 century DR.
In the , the sage Beldrune, working at the Moonshorn Tower, opined about a certain Olberts triple-delayed blast fireball spell. Beldrune noted that Olbert had created that spell by combining the work of Illiymbrim Sharnult, Lhabbartan, and a third person whose name he could not recall at the moment. This strongly implied that Illiymbrim Sharnult predated Olbert.
