Dosemen, sometimes called Dosemen of Sundabar, was a competent wizard from Sundabar.
In 1364, he was involved in a contest with the fellow mages of his guild and invoked the aid of a demon. Dosemen was tricked into calling the help of a powerful demon lord, Errtu. When Errtu was invoked, the demon lord destroyed the containers spell with a piece of dead-magic zone and killed the mage.
