'''Dosemen''', sometimes called '''Dosemen of Sundabar''', was a competent [[wizard]] from [[Sundabar]].

In [[1364]], he was involved in a contest with the fellow mages of his guild and invoked the aid of a [[demon]]. Dosemen was tricked into calling the help of a powerful [[demon lord]], [[Errtu]]. When Errtu was invoked, the demon lord destroyed the container's spell with a piece of [[dead-magic zone]] and killed the mage.
