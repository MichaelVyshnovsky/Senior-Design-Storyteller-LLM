Sharp-eye '''Nozk''' was a [[goblin]] [[Cult of the Absolute|cultist]] of [[the Absolute]] who lived in the [[Shattered Sanctum]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Thought you was my replacement, but noooo. Bet Mirg has drunk herself stupid.|Nozk.}}

==Description==
He wore a suit of [[leather]] and cloth armor, a leather [[helmet|helm]], and a necklace bearing the [[holy symbol]] of the Absolute.

==Possessions==
Nozk carried with him a crude [[bow]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the cult of the Absolute launched a vicious and quite successful raid on the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn. Nozk was left on guard duty at the Shattered Sanctum, while his replacement [[Mirg (goblin)|Mirg]] got drunk during the celebratory feast.
