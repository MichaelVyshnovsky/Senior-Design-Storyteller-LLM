Sy was a fisher who lived on the Sword Coast during the late 15 century DR.
Among the possessions Sy carried on their final day, was a letter given by their true love.
Sy was in love with a woman named Anna. Though they endured some hard months together, they had a shared dream of living in the great city of Baldurs Gate.
As of the , Sy was fishing along the banks of the River Chionthar, apparently ready to pack up their life, meet with Anna, and travel to Baldurs Gate together. Unfortunately for the couple, other events interfered with their plans. An alien craft descended from the sky and crashed into the coastline of the Chionthar, near where Sy and others were catching fish. By all accounts it appeared that Sy and other fishers attempted to defend themselves from the creatures within the vessel, but were ultimately unsuccessful, and slain where they stood. Sy would never get to meet their love Anna, and died with her letter in hand.
