        "mainbody": "Evon Stralana was the Cormyrean minister of defense of Arabel during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe was a thin and sickly-looking man with dark hair.\nStralana worked directly under the Lady Lord or Arabel, Myrmeen Lhal.\nSome time before the Time of Troubles, Evon Stralana led the efforts to ferret out a traitor to the crown in Arabel, hiring on three outsider mercenaries, Adon, Cyric, and Kelemvor Lyonsbane. While the effort to find the traitor was successful, identifying one Ronglath Knightsbridge, his eventual escape aided by the same mercenaries led to a breakout of fear and paranoia in the city.\nIn the , Stralanas agents retrieved information from the noted forger Gelzunduth that Cyric and Kelemvor had sought out forged documents for safe passage out of Arabel. Myrmeen Lhal directed Stralana to interrogate their own guard force to see who allowed the mercenaries to pass through the citys borders and hunt down the wanted men. They tasked the Company of Dawn adventuring band to hunt them down across Cormyr and into the Dalelands."
