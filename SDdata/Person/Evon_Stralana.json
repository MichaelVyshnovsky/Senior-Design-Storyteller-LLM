        "mainbody": "'''Evon Stralana''' was the [[Cormyr]]ean minister of defense of [[Arabel]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He was a thin and sickly-looking man with dark hair.",
        "Relationships": "Stralana worked directly under the Lady Lord or [[Arabel]], [[Myrmeen Lhal]].",
        "History": "Some time before the [[Time of Troubles]], Evon Stralana led the efforts to ferret out a traitor to the crown in Arabel, hiring on three outsider mercenaries, [[Adon]], [[Cyric]], and [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]]. While the effort to find the traitor was successful, identifying one [[Ronglath Knightsbridge]], his eventual escape aided by the same mercenaries led to a breakout of fear and paranoia in the city.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Stralana's agents retrieved information from the noted forger [[Gelzunduth]] that Cyric and Kelemvor had sought out forged documents for safe passage out of Arabel. Myrmeen Lhal directed Stralana to interrogate their own guard force to see who allowed the mercenaries to pass through the city's borders and hunt down the wanted men. They tasked the [[Company of Dawn]] adventuring band to hunt them down across Cormyr and into the [[Dalelands]]."
