'''Salen''' was the leader of a group of mercenaries who drank at the [[Laughing Goblin Inn]].

==Description==
Salen was a very beautiful salt-and-pepper-haired woman who was an experienced [[dagger]] thrower.

==Personality==
Being the leader of her company, Salen was smart and sly. In her dagger-throwing contest versus Ren, Salen tried to trick the big man with weighted blades.

==Possessions==
Like many soldiers, Salen dressed in [[chain mail]] and fought with a [[sword]], a few daggers, and a [[throwing axe]].

==History==
On the [[Flamerule 19|19th]] of [[Flamerule]], [[1340 DR]], Salen and her allies, [[Jensena]] and [[Gwen]], challenged [[Ren o' the Blade]] to a couple of contests, which Ren won due to his cunning.

On the night of the [[Flamerule 28|28th]] of Flamerule, Salen and her companions were attacked by a [[troll]] outside the Phlan city walls. During the battle, Ren joined the fray, but not before Salen and Gwen were killed by the monster.
