Salen was the leader of a group of mercenaries who drank at the Laughing Goblin Inn.
Salen was a very beautiful salt-and-pepper-haired woman who was an experienced dagger thrower.
Being the leader of her company, Salen was smart and sly. In her dagger-throwing contest versus Ren, Salen tried to trick the big man with weighted blades.
Like many soldiers, Salen dressed in chain mail and fought with a sword, a few daggers, and a throwing axe.
On the 19th of Flamerule, 1340 DR, Salen and her allies, Jensena and Gwen, challenged Ren o the Blade to a couple of contests, which Ren won due to his cunning.
On the night of the 28th of Flamerule, Salen and her companions were attacked by a troll outside the Phlan city walls. During the battle, Ren joined the fray, but not before Salen and Gwen were killed by the monster.
