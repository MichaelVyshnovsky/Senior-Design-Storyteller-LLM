        "mainbody": "Harlakh Doroaver, known as \"the King of Swords,\" was a veteran mercenary and ostensible king of the lawless Realm of the Ready Sword, a valley between the Shaar and Duskwood in the eastern Border Kingdoms, in the late 14 century DR.\nHarlakh was a huge, musclebound man with a scarred face and raven-black hair. He was rarely seen out of his armor and his saddle.\nThe King of Swords was a direct and stoic man, possessed of great cunning. In his life he became an experienced warlord and lived to fight his innumerable foes, command his soldiers, and prepare for coming conflicts, with no interest in pursuing a peaceful domestic life. He would not waste his time on tears or anger, and planned each day as if he was about to fight a battle, keeping his wits focused and always on guard for danger. He constantly sought to gather information and news, and always verified and checked his sources to ensure accuracy.\nHarlakh was unwed, but kept the company of numerous affectionate ladies scattered across the Realm. Though they would rather die than betray him, he always kept himself ready just in case they did.\nHe guarded the folk of the Ready Sword as if they were his own children, and earned the love or respect of every inhabitant. He was accompanied in his patrols by the Crown Blades, the company of loyal bodyguard knights that aided in enforcing his rule.\nAround 1374 DR, Harlakh watched vigilantly over his \"kingdom\" and patrolled it from end to end, and was known to secretly frequent inns in order to hear unfiltered news and rumors from travelers and locals. He had no \"royal castle\", but kept homes (small, defendable stone forts) at different points in the realm The Keep of Crows on the western edge, Graaltower in the middle, and Aldersund in the east.\nThrough his shrewd politicking he kept the locals from all killing each other, and thanks to his militant patrols the Realm of Swords was kept safe enough for caravan travel. Despite his renown, his authority in the realm only extended as far as the sword-reach of himself and the Crown Blades."
