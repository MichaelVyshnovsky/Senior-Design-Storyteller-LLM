        "History": {
            "Rise": "In the {{YearlinkName|1444}}, the High Rider of Elturel was discovered to be a [[vampire]], with a vast network of [[vampire spawn]], [[charm person|charmed]] minions, [[undead]] allies, and sycophantic collaborators. Now exposed, the undead infested Elturel, and whatever victories the [[Hellriders]] won during the days, they lost sorely in the nights. It was said the Elturians prayed to the gods each night just for the dawn to come sooner.\n\nOne, Thavius Kreeg, then a priest of Torm, pleaded to ''any'' power to save his city, and in that moment his reckless prayer was answered—by the archdevil Zariel, stepping from a pillar of fire with a deal to make, to which he hastily agreed.Curiously, Thavius surrenders the city in his \"capacity as High Overseer of Elturel\", yet signs it at a time when he is ''not'' the High Overseer, and in fact the vampire High Rider is still the legitimate ruler, and he had no right to surrender the city. This implies this part of the contract is actually invalid.\n\nThen a second sun appeared in the sky, turning night to day, and blasting the vampire lord and his spawn to ashes while the remaining undead cowered from its light. Elturel was swiftly liberated from their dead grip. Only he knew the true origin of the mysterious second sun.\n\n[[The Companion]], as it became known, remained; the \"miracle\" brought [[Pilgrim|pilgrims]]: the sick, the curious, and the devout of many faiths, including many [[paladin]]s.The ''Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide'' makes it clear that the name \"Companion\" was given to the second sun some time after its appearance; the first, unnamed, paladin High Observer established the Creed Resolute; and that Kreeg took office a few years later. However, ''Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus'' has all these established in Kreeg's contract with Zariel, written beforehand. This is presumed to be in error, or at least updated, as the text of the contract also implies Kreeg is ruler of the city ''before'' he actually took power. In any case, DiA does not quite contradict SCAG, and Kreeg may have inspired these things from behind the scenes before taking power.",
            "Reign": "{{fq\n| text   = Be it known to all that I, Thavius Kreeg, High Overseer of Elturel, have sworn to my master, Zariel, lord of Avernus, to keep the agreements contained in this oath.\n| source = From Kreeg's contract with Zariel\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nKreeg was raised to the position of High Observer Nevertheless, Kreeg would reign for decades and set Elturel on the road to becoming the nation of Elturgard.\n\n''Circa'' [[1459 DR]], the High Observer ordered the [[Reaching Woods]] barricaded after the discovery of shrines to certain primal entities he disapproved of. These shrines were maintained by humans and [[elves]] as well as [[gnoll]]s and [[goblin]]s, but the High Observer said the goblins were vicious and the gnolls known [[demon]] worshipers, and declared the death penalty for anyone who came out of, or went into, the forest.\n\nWhen the entire garrison of [[Fort Morninglord]] also vanished without cause and under sinister circumstances in the {{YearlinkName|1476}}, Kreeg ordered it bricked up and sealed, out of some fear of what evil or contagion it might house. Furthermore, he decreed that anyone who broke in would be declared an outlaw.\n\nAround [[1489 DR]], Kreeg was aging and another leadership transition was expected soon. He eventually made all Elturians swear the Creed Resolute, in the process binding them to the city and to his deal with Zariel.",
            "Betrayal": "{{fq\n| text   = In my capacity as High Overseer of Elturel and its vassal territories, I acknowledge that all lands falling under the light of the Companion are forfeit to Zariel. All persons bound by oath to defend Elturel are also considered forfeit. I further recognize that this dispensation will last fifty years, after which the Companion will return whence it came, taking Elturel and its oath-bound defenders with it, if that is Zariel's wish.\n| source = The (potentially invalid) key part of Kreeg's contract with Zariel\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nHowever, in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Thavius's deal with Zariel was set to expire; he knew the exact time and made plans to be out of the city when the Companion ceased to protect it. Thus, in the months before, he coaxed Grand Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] to come to Elturel to resolve several disputes that had troubled the two cities for some time. After greeting the Baldurian delegation, Thavius escaped Elturel in secret, shortly before the Companion changed into a black orb that tore the whole of Elturel and its populace from the [[Material Plane]] and spirited it away to [[Avernus]], first of the [[Nine Hells]].\n\nHiding among the first of the Elturian refugees, Thavius made his way to Baldur's Gate, where his friend (and fellow minion of Zariel) Duke [[Thalamra Vanthampur]] covertly gave him access to the city and a hideout in [[Vanthampur Villa]], albeit in its dungeon. There, Thavius examined the ''[[Shield of the Hidden Lord]]'', in which the devil [[Gargauth]] was imprisoned; he concluded its influence was the cause of much of the greed and crime in the city. Together, they schemed to release Gargauth, so that he might help them take over Baldur's Gate and have it suffer Elturel's fate. However, the young Hellrider [[Reya Mantlemorn]] heard rumors of Thavius's presence and helped adventurers penetrate the villa to uncover the plot and confront the villains. They also retrieved his ''infernal puzzle box''.",
            "Descent": "[[File:Thaviusimprisoned.jpg|thumb|220x220px|''Thavius reborn as an amnizu and bemoaning his fate in his cell in Zariel's flying fortress.'']]\nIf killed there, Thavius's damned soul would descend to the Hells itself, and crawl from the [[River Styx]] in the form of a [[devil]]—a wretched [[lemure]]. By the terms of their contract, instantly alerted to his fate, Zariel would promote him to an [[amnizu]] as a reward for his service, but imprison him in a dungeon in her [[Zariel's flying fortress|flying fortress]] until Elturel was finally destroyed. Here he cried, but only for himself, apparently surprised to find himself in Hell after only half a century of power. If he was slain in Hell, he would be dead forever. However, Thavius's death, while satisfying, would not break the contract binding Elturel; adventurers questing to save the city by voiding the contract would need to destroy the original or else slay the archdevil Zariel herself, which was no small task, or seek some other means."

        "Activities": "Aided by a paladin knighthood, the [[Order of the Companion]],While this religious zealotry and inquisitions are made explicit in the write-up of Elturgard in the 4{{th}}-edition ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide'', they are not mentioned at all in the more extensive and very positive description in the 5{{th}}-edition ''Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide'' (albeit with some subtly hinted villainy). The two versions are difficult to reconcile. As such, this more positive vision may reflect a retcon, either out-of-universe or in-universe with the [[Second Sundering]]; the narrator for this section, [[Aedyn Graymantle]], being mistaken or unaware of the extreme elements; or propaganda one way or the other. The negative version is supported by the story of Thavius's betrayal of Elturel and service to devils in '' Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus'', but no elements are linked to it. Regardless, this wiki endeavors to present both versions for the reader to make their own judgement.\n\nHe reigned from the [[High Hall (Elturel)|High Hall]] in Elturel.",
        "Description": "By the 1490s DR, Thavius was an old man. However, his shadow was not of a man but of a horned fiend, pudgy with small wings—a very real shadow of his guilt and one he could not cover up with a lie. This was to be his form as a devil: a paunchy horned amnizu with small wings.",

        "Abilities": "Once a [[cleric]] of Torm, Thavius lost his divine power when he abandoned his faith. Thereafter, he only pretended to worship.",
        "Possessions": "He had a [[mace]]. Thavius's [[holy symbol]] of Torm was a [[silver]] pendant of the god's symbol on a silver chain. This was worth 25 [[gp]], but probably had no spiritual value to him.\n\nHe also possessed an ''[[infernal puzzle box]]'', in which a copy of his contract with Zariel was secreted."
