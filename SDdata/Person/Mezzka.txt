Devout '''Mezzka''' was a [[goblin]] priest of [[the Absolute]] that came to reside in the [[Shattered Sanctum]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|You hungry? The [[dwarf]]'s gettin' good an' crispy.|Mezzka, during a celebratory feast.}}

==Description==
Unlike other devotees of the Absolute, Mezzka opted not to decorate his clothing with bones and garish feathers, opting instead for simple [[leather]] garments.

==History==
Mezzka was present at the [[Shattered Sanctum]] following [[Cult of the Absolute|his group's]] horrific but successful raid on [[Waukeen's Rest]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
