        "mainbody": "'''Asharra''' ({{Pronounce|ah|SHAR|ah|refs=}}), or '''Teacher''', as she was known by her own kind, was an elderly [[aarakocra]] [[druid]],[https://web.archive.org/web/20180127145033/https://www.reddit.com/r/idlechampions/comments/7jl9ve/idle_champions_community_qa_4_next_livestream/dr83sbl/?context=10000 According to Chris Dupuis], a [[Wizards of the Coast]] producer, Asharra was changed from a [[wizard]] to a druid late in the development of ''[[Tomb of Annihilation]]''. As a result, Asharra is portrayed as a wizard in several games based on ''Tomb'', such as ''[[Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms]]'' and ''[[Tales from Candlekeep: Tomb of Annihilation]]''. In future appearances, Asharra will be referenced as a wizard. as well the leader of [[Kir Sabal]] near the end of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was venerated by the others in her community, to the point of being considered sacred.",
        "Personality": "Asharra was exceptionally insightful and equally ambitious. While she had a propensity for manipulating others, she never acted in a manner that was malicious or uncaring.\n\nShe knew the specifications of a ritual called the  ''[[Dance of the Seven Winds]]'', that allowed a small number of people to temporarily gain the power of flight.",
        "Possessions": "Asharra owned a collection of 44 [[book]]s, all of which were published before the {{YearlinkName|1385}}. They covered a variety of subjects including mathematics, [[:Category:Geography books (in-universe)|geography]], and philosophy, among others.\n\nAsharra owned several [[staves]] of distinct designs. A simple ''driftwood staff'', decorated with intricate carvings, an ''aarakocra battle staff'' often used in battle and ceremonial arms by the aarakocra royal guards, a staff carved out of [[suth]] decorated with colorful feathers, cloth, and jewelry. Enchanted staves of hers were: a ''[[warstaff of the Wind Dukes]]'' and a ''[[staff of the magi]]''. She was often armed with [[dagger]]s, such as a simple carving knife, a dark [[zalantar]]-hafted blade with a black blade dipped in [[ink]], a shiv crafted out of a [[velociraptor]] fang, a magical ''[[runic blade of Aaqa]]'', and the ''[[Dance Blade of the Seven Winds]]'' used in the ''Dance of the Seven Winds'' ritual.\n\nHer collection of [[robe]]s included an ''elder's raiment'', purely ceremonial vestment of aarakocra elders, a ''battle mage tunic'' that offered some defense in combat, an enchanted set of ''[[prestigious chromatic vestments]]'', and the powerful ''[[ceremonial garments of the Black Orchid]]''. Asharra used magical [[amulet]]s to enhance her spellcasting abilities. Such amulets included a simple [[copper]] cain, a [[citrine]] pendant, an intricately weaved [[silver]] string ''dreamcatcher'' that protected her from nightmares and ''[[curse]]s'', an enchanted ''[[sapphire pendant of mage armor]]'', and a powerful item, the ''[[glorious diamond necklace of the airborne]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Her needs were seen to by an elderly servant named [[Yingmatona]], who aside from Prince Na, was the only individual allowed within her home.",
        "History": "[[File:Asharra steam card.jpg|thumb|''Asharra charging into battle.''|270x270px]]\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, the aarakocra of Kir Sabal sheltered the current heirs of the royal family of [[Omu]], Prince [[Na]] and Princess [[Mwaxanaré]]. While Asharra stated their actions were altruistic in nature, she held some aspirations of uplifting the aarakocra to a higher social standing in Chult. She sheltered the young royals and raised them with an sense of entitlement and skewed perspective of their royal authority within greater [[Faerûn]]."
