'''Erik''' was a silversmith inhabiting the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Erik stood several inches over {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall. 

==Activities==
Similar to a [[dwarf]], Erik was usually extremely focused on his work.

==History==
His height helped him bully other kids growing up, but he later poured all of that anger into working metal.
