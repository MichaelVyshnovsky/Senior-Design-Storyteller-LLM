Erik was a silversmith inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Erik stood several inches over  tall. 
Similar to a dwarf, Erik was usually extremely focused on his work.
His height helped him bully other kids growing up, but he later poured all of that anger into working metal.
