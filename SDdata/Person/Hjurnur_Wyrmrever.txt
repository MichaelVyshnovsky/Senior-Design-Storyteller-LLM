Hjurnur Wyrmrever was a notorious frost giant hero of the Thousand Year War.
During the Thousand Year War, Hjurnur killed many dragons single-handedly, though he could not match the Vonindod in terms of wyrms slain. During this time he was credited with killing an adult blue dragon with a single blow of his axe and breaking the spine of a black dragon over his knees.
His final battle in life during the war was against an ancient gold dragon general, though some would say it was a king, who had destroyed many a giant city. Hjurnur lured the dragon into a deep and narrow pit he had dug in order to limit its mobility as they fought. The dragon then called upon its twelve lieutenants, who the giant each slayed. But with no cracks for the blood to drain into, Hjurnur died drowning in the blood of the thirteen dragons.
In the centuries that followed he was celebrated in many poems and songs, with the oldest being the Saga of the Dragon Queller, written by his uncle Hrotun. Circa 1356 DR, such songs and poems were only popular among his fellow frost giants.
One legend claimed that during the Thousand Year War he challenged Tiamat in a contest of riddles. He lost that contest, however, and had to allow the Queen of Dragons devour his own child.
