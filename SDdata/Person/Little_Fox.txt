The Little Fox was a yak folk fighter and the youngest member of the Seven Sages inhabiting the World Pillar Mountains in 1367 DR.
Little Fox was appointed to govern the Ghost Leopard province in the northwest region of the Yikarian Empire. Her close ties with a multitude of marrashi eyries allowed her to easily monitor all traffic through the foothills of the River Ruin.
