Brother Sepulcher was a priest of Jergal in Waterdeep in 1479 DR.
As a priest of Jergal, Sepulcher was stationed at the Yawning Portal, keeping notes of the names and descriptions of any adventurers that entered Undermountain, sometimes questioning them about relatives, spiritual inclinations, and intended Undermountain destinations. He also informed individuals who were too tall of the problems of fitting their bodies inside a coffin.
In 1479 DR, Brother Sepulcher arrived at the Yawning Portal inn with Sister Palonya. Palonya went inside Undermountain to replace the previous priest of Jergal assigned to catalog the bodies inside some particular Undermountain tombs, while Sepulcher waited.
Sepulcher was a grim and morose man.
