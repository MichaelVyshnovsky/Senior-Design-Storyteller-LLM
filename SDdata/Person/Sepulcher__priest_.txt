'''Brother Sepulcher''' was a priest of [[Jergal]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1479 DR]].

==Activities==
As a priest of Jergal, Sepulcher was stationed at the [[Yawning Portal]], keeping notes of the names and descriptions of any adventurers that entered [[Undermountain]], sometimes questioning them about relatives, spiritual inclinations, and intended Undermountain destinations. He also informed individuals who were too tall of the problems of fitting their bodies inside a coffin.

==History==
In 1479 DR, Brother Sepulcher arrived at the Yawning Portal inn with Sister [[Palonya]]. Palonya went inside Undermountain to replace the previous priest of Jergal assigned to catalog the bodies inside some particular Undermountain tombs, while Sepulcher waited.

==Personality==
Sepulcher was a grim and morose man.
