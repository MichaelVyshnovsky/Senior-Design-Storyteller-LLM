The '''Susurrus''' was a [[Lolth-touched]] [[fiendish]] [[wendigo]] [[monstrous spider|monstrous hunting spider]] of enormous proportions that ravaged [[Shadowdale]]'s geographical backroads for millennia.

==Abilities==
Its maddening whispers and diseased bite turned all [[fey]] who encountered it into cannibalistic wendigos.

==Description==
Appearing as a gigantic arachnid covered in matted white fur and hateful glowing eyes, the Susurrus floated towards its prey with the charred bloody stumps of its legs outstretched. It bore the faint emblem of a spider on its brow.

==History==
The Susurrus was unleashed upon the fey of Shadowdale in {{Yearlink|-2549}} by the [[drow]] of [[Maerimydra]] when they turned the surrounding woodland into the [[Land Under Shadow]]. Eventually, the fey decided to make a pact in order to trap the horror and vowed never to use the region's [[crossroads and backroads]] while the Susurrus lived. This ensured the monster could never escape into the real world but also cut off many fey from [[Faerie]], causing their numbers to dwindle over time.

In the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, guided and prepared by the goddess [[Mielikki]], [[Azalar Falconhand]] lured the Susurrus back to the real world, where the monster was finally slain by him and a band of [[adventurer]]s.While the events of the ''Shadowdale: The Scouring of the Land'' adventure are not set in stone, the defeat of the Susurrus may be inferred from ''The Grand History of the Realms'' stating that fey return to Shadowdale, as this requires the removal of the Susurrus.
