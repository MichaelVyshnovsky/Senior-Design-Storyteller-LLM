Ethen Yarbroul, lovingly referred as "Ma", was the tavernkeeper of the Three Flags Sailing inn in Targos in Icewind Dale in the late 15 century DR.
She was plump and had gray hair.
In the 1480s DR, "Ma" busied herself about the tavern, fussing over the fisherfolk patrons as if they were own sons (and some were) and encouraging them to have a hot beer "to take the chill off".
She was a widow and had a few sons.
