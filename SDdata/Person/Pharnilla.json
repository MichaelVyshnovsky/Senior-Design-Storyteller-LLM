        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Pharnilla could often be found peddling the ''Baldur's Mouth Gazette'' across the street from [[Beehive Goods and Wares]] in the Lower City alongside [[Dellys]], with whom Pharnilla took breaks. He didn't like taking breaks, thinking them boring and lamented not being able to read his own stock to pass the time."
