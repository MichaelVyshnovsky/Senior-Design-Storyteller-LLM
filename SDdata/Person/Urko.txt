Urko was a kobold in northwest Faerûn.
Urko was the leader of the kobolds who attacked Hilltop in 1372 DR on orders from Tymofarrar. After being attacked by gnolls, Urko and his men sought refuge in a nearby elven crypt, only to find it infested with undead elven warriors and giant spiders. Terrified, they barricaded themselves in an empty room, but were soon approached by an unnamed adventurer who wished to retrieve the mummy hand the kobolds had stolen from Drogan Droganson.
Yazka and Kipper were Urkos lieutenants.
