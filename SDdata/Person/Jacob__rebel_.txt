'''Jacob''' was a senior member of the [[Nashers]] faction of the [[Sons of Alagondar]] who lived in the [[Blacklake District]] of [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Jacob wrote a note to Nasher leader [[Karzov]] reporting the [[Dead Rats]] were responsible for the disappearance of [[Gothwan Cooper]]. Karzov wrote back explaining why he would not move against the Dead Rats or try to retrieve Gothwan. An adventurer seeking Gothwan later found this note, suggesting Jacob had been found dead, if not slain by the adventurer.
