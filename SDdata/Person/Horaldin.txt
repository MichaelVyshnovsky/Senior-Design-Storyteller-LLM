'''Horaldin''' was a [[druid]] in the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, [[Qilué Veladorn]] asked his help in investigating a gem found in the possession of a [[Selvetargtlin]] [[aranea]] and thanks to his power he was able to explain some of the history of the gem.

In the {{YearlinkName|1379}}, Qilué ordered to Horaldin to place a [[glyph of insanity]] inside the Promenade that would attract the followers of [[Ghaunadaur]]; he was worried about it and argued with Qilué.

Later Horaldin explained the matter to the [[Darksong Knight]] [[Cavatina Xarann]].

Horaldin was killed by Qilué under compulsion from [[Wendonai]]. Having used the [[Crescent Blade]], Horaldin's soul was destroyed and he could not be resurrected. (However, it is not for sure, as souls of Qilué<ref>[[Ed Greenwood]] on [https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1235039364763115522 Twitter] and Cavatina weren't destroyed when they were killed by Crescent Blade.)
