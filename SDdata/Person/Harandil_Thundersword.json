        "mainbody": "'''Harandil Thundersword''' was a knight and a member of the [[Thundersword]] noble family in [[Cormyr]] who rode with Princess [[Alusair Obarskyr]]. He was softly spoken.\n\nIn the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], Alusair and her knights were operating in the Stonelands, pursuing a bold [[orc]] band that had raided a caravan east of [[Eveningstar]]; in six days of pursuit, they'd killed a [[hydra]], a \"[[fire lizard]]\", and three [[chimera]]s. They were on a high meadow north of [[Startop Crag]] when the knights impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush, and a few were killed. Alusair rallied her forces to defeat the orcs and their [[dark naga]] master. When Alusair said warriors cleaned up after themselves, Harandil added that \"or they soon die\", agreeing with her plan to clear the [[Zhentarim]] threat to the area."
