{{Quote|Brighter! Louder! BIGGER!|Duddy Dudderken}}

==Description==
Duddy was a [[human]] boy with a light olive skin tone, short, curly dark brown hair, and dark brown eyes.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, Duddy Dudderken attended a performance of some showy magics by three spellslingers, on the [[Murl's Rest]] plaza in front of [[Sorcerous Sundries]]. The boy obnoxiously yelled demands of bigger and louder magics.
