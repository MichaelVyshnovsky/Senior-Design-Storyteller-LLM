'''Lemmeth''' was a [[War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
He could cast at least one spell of [[hold monster|''holding'']], which worked on [[doppelganger]]s, and one spell that created a ''[[moonglow]]'' capable of revealing shapeshifting creatures.

==Relationships==
He was recruited by [[Eskrel Starbridge]], the highest [[highknight]] in Cormyr at the time, to join him in a search for the fugitive [[Elminster Aumar]] in [[Shadowdale]].

==History==
Lemmeth was a part of Eskrel Starbridge's forces when seeking Elminster in Shadowdale in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}. During the search, Lemmeth managed to ''hold'' [[Thal]], a doppelganger and accomplice of another doppelganger pretending to be Elminster, for questioning. The same force found [[Storm Silverhand]] masquerading as Elminster Aumar; fearing another doppelganger, he employed a ''moonglow'' to suss her out. After proving she was not a shapeshifter, Lemmeth left the talking to Eskrel, who was outplayed completely by Storm.

He was later somewhat suspicious of Eskrel because of this.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|339-340|32}}
