Gnerkli was king of the rock gnome clan at Gnomengarde in the late 15 century DR. He ruled alongside his husband, King Korboz.
In addition to his innate gnomish abilities, Gnerkli (like everyone else in Gnomengarde) had some training as a wizard. In combat, he preferred to attack with spells like ray of frost and magic missile.
Gnerkli wore a patchwork cape and a jagged metal crown to signify his status as king. He possessed a wand of pyrotechnics, although he was happy to part with it as a show of gratitude to one who had earned his thanks.
Gnerkli cared deeply for his husband, Korboz, so much so that when Korboz went mad and imprisoned him in the late 15 century DR, Gnerkli regarded his husband as being as much in need of saving as himself.
