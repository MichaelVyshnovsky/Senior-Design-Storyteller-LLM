'''Gnerkli''' was king of the [[rock gnome]] clan at [[Gnomengarde]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He ruled alongside his husband, King [[Korboz]].

==Abilities==
In addition to his innate [[gnome|gnomish]] abilities, Gnerkli (like everyone else in Gnomengarde) had some training as a [[wizard]]. In combat, he preferred to attack with [[spells]] like ''[[ray of frost]]'' and ''[[magic missile]]''.

==Possessions==
Gnerkli wore a patchwork cape and a jagged metal crown to signify his status as king. He possessed a ''[[wand of pyrotechnics]]'', although he was happy to part with it as a show of gratitude to one who had earned his thanks.

==Relationships==
Gnerkli cared deeply for his husband, Korboz, so much so that when Korboz went mad and imprisoned him in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Gnerkli regarded his husband as being as much in need of saving as himself.
