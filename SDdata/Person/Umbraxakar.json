After Vanrak truly redeemed himself and died, Umbraxakar fell back into despair.\nGlyster had a deep friendship with Vanrak and when the noble ranger turned to evil and to Shar the dragon tried all he could to save his friend. Instead, Glyster was also corrupted but he still valued his friendship with Vanrak.\nUmbraxakar somehow gained the power to slide some areas of Vanrakdoom in and out of the Shadowfell."
