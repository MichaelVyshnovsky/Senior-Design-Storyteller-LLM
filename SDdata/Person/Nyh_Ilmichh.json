        "mainbody": "'''Nyh Ilmichh''' was an envoy of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] sent by [[Szass Tam]] to propose an alliance between [[Thay]] and the [[Council of Waterdeep]] in the 1490s DR.",
        "History": "One day, Nyh Illichh, under orders from her master, approached the Council of Lords of Waterdeep with the purpose of setting up a meeting between Thay and the Council in the hope they could help each other against the rising menace of [[Tiamat]] and the [[Cult of the Dragon]].\n\nEventually the Council sent a band of adventurers to speak with Nyh at her residence at the Thayan embassy in [[Waterdeep]]. Nyh explained that they needed to meet the tharchion [[Eseldra Yeth]], but this was possible only in her residence in Thay."
