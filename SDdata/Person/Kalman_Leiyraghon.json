However, secretly, he met with his friends Argens Bruil, Elaint Marsk, Kara Calaudra, and Oreal Nanther planning to go on an adventure, with the support of Dorn.\nThey found a \"treasure map\" (in truth, a trap devised by Bremen Leiyraghon) and went on adventure in Thar, only to be captured by the orog Daazlag and his orc minions.\nKalman was imprisoned in a cave in XÃ»l-Jarak with all his friends. Kalman was waiting for the right time to escape using all his ready spells but cared more for himself than for his friends."
