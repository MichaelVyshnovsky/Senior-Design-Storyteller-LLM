However, secretly, he met with his friends [[Argens Bruil]], [[Elaint Marsk]], [[Kara Calaudra]], and [[Oreal Nanther]] planning to go on an adventure, with the support of Dorn.\n\nThey found a \"treasure map\" (in truth, a trap devised by [[Bremen Leiyraghon]]) and went on adventure in [[Thar]], only to be captured by the [[orog]] [[Daazlag]] and his [[orc]] minions.\n\nKalman was imprisoned in a cave in [[XÃ»l-Jarak]] with all his friends. Kalman was waiting for the right time to escape using all his ready [[spell]]s but cared more for himself than for his friends."
