        "mainbody": "'''Lord Craghand''' was a roaming [[undead|undying]] skeletal creature who once was a petty lord from the land of [[Unther]] in the [[Old Empires]], long before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In life, Lord Craghand possessed no talent with ''[[the Art]]'' and employed a small army of [[necromancers]] to compensate for the shortcoming. Under his command, the necromancers enchanted a handful of fiery [[morningstar]]s – ''[[Bone Phoenix]]es''. Craghand sought to immortalize his pet rule through dark necromantic spells. However, the magics were unsuccessful. Instead of making the lord immortal, Lord Craghand and his court became cursed with a strange form of undeath. They were turned into the so-called \"Bone Phoenixes,\" undying skeletal creatures that roamed and menaced [[Faerûn]]. Every time these undead creatures perished or were slain by well-meaning heroes, they returned to undeath shortly after, doomed to endless accursed existence."
