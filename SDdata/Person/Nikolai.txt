Nikolai was a resident of Baldurs Gate who lived in the city during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Nikolai was quite knowledgeable about the history of Baldurs Gate and would offer what he knew for the rather steep price of 15 gold pieces. He worked his pitch at a street crossing in the Eastway neighborhood of the city, near the Blade and Stars inn, specifically seeking out people he suspected were new to the city.
