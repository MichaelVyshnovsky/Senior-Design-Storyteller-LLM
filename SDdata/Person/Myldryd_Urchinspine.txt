Myldryd Urchinspine was a sea hag that dwelled within a wrecked ship on the shore of the Snout of Omgar during the late 15 century DR.
The wretched hag made her lair within the ruined hull of the Dirty Dastard, that ran ashore on the Chultan isle.
Hidden in the sand beneath the wrecked ship was a treasure chest that held all of Myldryds possessions. Among these were several simple trinkets, a comb made of whale bone, a stuffed parrot that housed a single carnelian, and hidden within a secret compartment, a medallion of thoughts.
She commanded a pair of giant crab minions.
