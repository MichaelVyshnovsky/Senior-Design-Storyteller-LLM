        "mainbody": "Jayne Nettlebee was the wife of Bertram Nettlebee during the Elemental Evil crisis.\nJayne was a no-nonsense lady who knew how to handle Wiggan, Bertram, and other loudmouths. She was afraid however and most concerned for her children. She did not know her husbands true allegiance.\nIn 1491 DR, she was unwittingly involved in a trap set by her family for some adventurers who had defeated the Cult of the Black Earth at the Sacred Stone Monastery. At the end of the tragedy, she assumed the role of the new matriarch of the Nettlebee clan."
