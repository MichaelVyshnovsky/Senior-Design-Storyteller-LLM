        "mainbody": "'''Halfred''' was the last inkeeper of [[Last Light Inn]] in [[Reithwin]] during [[Ketheric Thorm's war]]. Following this, he became one of the leaders of the [[Church of Selûne|Selûnite]] resistance against Ketheric, who had turned to [[Shar]]. Halfred and his brother, [[Morfred]], fought until the [[Shadow-cursed lands|shadow curse]] overtook Reithwin. By {{YearlinkName|1492}} however, Halfred's efforts to hide Selûnite relics and establishing Last Light Inn as a haven turned fruitful with the sudden resurrection of [[Isobel Thorm]], who turned Last Light into, fittingly, the only place in Reithwin not infected by the curse. Halred's preparations also enabled both the [[Harpers]] and [[Absolute Adversaries]] to utilize the Inn as respite. \n\n{{Quote|Together, we shall preserve what we can of the Moonmaiden's light, and hope that the banners of the faithful soon rise against that treacherous dog, Thorm.|Halfred in a note to his brother}}",

            "Legacy": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Last Light Inn was used as a safe haven for the Isobel Thorm, who had been resurrected by [[Myrkul]] in order to gain Ketheric's loyalty. Last Light Inn was subsequently used as a haven and respite for the [[Harpers]] against the lingering shadow curse. Halfred's notes detailing the Selûnite resistance and the activities of Ketheric were found by the [[Absolute Adversaries]]. The group also met Halfred's brother within the [[House of Hope]]."
