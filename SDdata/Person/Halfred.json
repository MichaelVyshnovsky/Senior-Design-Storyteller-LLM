        "mainbody": "Halfred was the last inkeeper of Last Light Inn in Reithwin during Ketheric Thorms war. Following this, he became one of the leaders of the Selûnite resistance against Ketheric, who had turned to Shar. Halfred and his brother, Morfred, fought until the shadow curse overtook Reithwin. By  however, Halfreds efforts to hide Selûnite relics and establishing Last Light Inn as a haven turned fruitful with the sudden resurrection of Isobel Thorm, who turned Last Light into, fittingly, the only place in Reithwin not infected by the curse. Halreds preparations also enabled both the Harpers and Absolute Adversaries to utilize the Inn as respite. \nDuring the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Halfred and his brother Morfred served General Ketheric Thorm. Halfred managed the Last Light Inn, while Morfred worked as a mason, later tasked by Ketheric with constructing Moonrise Towers. Concerned about Ketherics intentions, however, Halfred urged his brother to refuse the commission, but Morfred ignored his warnings. Tragedy struck when Ketherics wife, Melodia Thorm, passed away, followed soon after by his daughter, Isobel. Overcome with grief, Ketheric abandoned his devotion to Selûne and turned to Shar, assembling an army of Dark Justiciars to purge Selûnite sympathies and eliminate those who refused to convert—including Halfred.\nBy , Halfred had become a key figure in the Selûnite resistance. He transformed Last Light Inn into a refuge for Selûnites, storing sacred relics in its basement. Halfred and Morfred remained in contact until Sharrans raided the Reithwin Masons Guild, Morfreds stronghold. Believing his brother dead or captured, Halfred continued the fight alone. However, Morfred had survived, striking a deal with the cambion Raphael to annihilate Ketheric’s forces.\nIn the , Last Light Inn was used as a safe haven for the Isobel Thorm, who had been resurrected by Myrkul in order to gain Ketherics loyalty. Last Light Inn was subsequently used as a haven and respite for the Harpers against the lingering shadow curse. Halfreds notes detailing the Selûnite resistance and the activities of Ketheric were found by the Absolute Adversaries. The group also met Halfreds brother within the House of Hope."
