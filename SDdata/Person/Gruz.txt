Sharp-eye Gruz was a goblin guard of the cult of the Absolute, who protected Shattered Sanctum during the late 15 century DR.
Gruz had orange-brown skin, decorated with white body paint, and black-gray hair that was kept in short braids. She wore a simple cloth tunic and pants, along with mismatched, leather and metal scale armor.
She was a no-nonsense individual who took her guard duties seriously.
Gruz spent her time guarding the front entrance of the Shattered Sanctum.
