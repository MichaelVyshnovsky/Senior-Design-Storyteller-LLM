'''Shinthala Deepcrest''' was a [[druid]] of [[Silvanus]] and member of the Elder Circle of the [[Emerald Enclave]] during the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].
{{quote|I find it ironic that the people of the [[Vilhon Reach|Vilhon]] continue to [[poison]] their own farms, streams, and air for the sake of profit. The destruction caused by these people goes far beyond the borders of the Vilhon, but this is my home. I find my actions limited by my status of [[Grand Druid]], and look forward to the time when I can find a suitable replacement. Then, I will finally be able to make a difference.|Shinthala Deepcrest}}

==History==
She was born in [[Cedarsproke]] in the [[Gulthmere Forest]] in the {{YearlinkName|1320}}.

In the late 1400s DR, Shinthala felt unable to act as she would've liked because of the chaos caused by the [[Spellplague]], which had altered the natural ecosystems and driven [[Cindermoon]], the [[elven]] member of the Elder Circle, insane.

Finally, in the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, the boy prophet of [[Lathander]], [[Stedd Whitehorn]], arrived and successfully cured Cindermoon. However, a large pirate fleet led by the [[Chosen]] of [[Umberlee]], [[Evendur Highcastle]], followed him in order to kill him. Shinthala alone agreed to join Stedd's companions and the [[Turmish]] navy in fighting them. During the battle, Shinthala and others faced Evendur and Shinthala was seriously injured. Finally, Stedd joined the fight and saved Shinthala's life.
