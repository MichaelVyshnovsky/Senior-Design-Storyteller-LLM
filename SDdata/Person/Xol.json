        "mainbody": "Xol was a flumph living in the Underdark beneath the Earthspur Mountains near Mulmaster.\nXol greatly disliked evil and did all in his ability to stop it. He was adamant in his crusade and often persuaded his mate to join him.\nXol was in love with Laal.\nIn 1491 DR, Xol noticed a group of troglodytes moving into the sewers of Mulmaster. He convinced Laal to follow them in order to warn others about this menace. Following the troglodytes, Xol located the mind of a particularly evil human. Xol tried to follow this man but was killed in an ambush. His body fell into the sewers and ended up on surface where it was discovered by some children."
