'''Noori Baenre''' was a female high-born cousin to [[Triel Baenre]]. She was one of the few exceptions to the rule of only males at Sorcere circa [[1373 DR]]. She was permitted to study magic at [[Sorcere]] rather than become a cleric of [[Lolth]] at [[Arach-Tinilith]].

==History==
She was one of the Baenre magic-users who [[Gromph Baenre]] gathered during the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]] for an attack on [[Nimor Imphraezl]] through a [[scrying]] crystal.
