'''Mondar Bleth''' was the owner of a small farmstead about a mile from [[Suzail]], which he and his family had settled shortly after [[Ondeth Obarskyr]] settled in the area. He was killed along with most of his family by elves in [[16 DR]] and his farmstead was razed. Mondar wielded a large heavy-hafted sword that would later become known as [[Ansrivarr]].

==Appearance==
Mondar was a very large man with an aggressive temper. He was balding by [[16 DR]] but had a very long beard, almost to his belt. He had deep lines on his forehead.

==Relatives==
[[Minda Obarskyr]], originally Minda Bleth, was Mondar's sister, and Mondar had a son, [[Arphoind Bleth]]. Mondar's wife died while giving birth to their son.

==History==
Mondar came to the land that would become known as [[Suzail]] in [[10 DR]], but did not want to settle in the confines of the main village, instead choosing a glade a mile to the northwest, although Ondeth disagreed with this decision. He and Ondeth eventually became good friends, but he did not like [[Baerauble Etharr]]. 

In [[16 DR]], during the night, the elves burned his farmstead to the ground and killed all of its occupants. In an effort to keep the peace between the humans and the elves, the massacre was blamed on a [[goblin]] raid. Minda and Arphoind Bleth survived the attack because they were not home at the time.
