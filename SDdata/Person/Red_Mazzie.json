        "mainbody": "Red Mazzie was the Court Wizard of Damara in the late 15th century DR. He was said to be most talented wizard in the kingdom.\nIn 1484 DR, in order to gain the favor of King Yarin Frostmantle, Red Mazzie captured the copper dragon sisters Tazmikella and Ilnezhara. However they were freed by Jarlaxle and Red Mazzie was without his prize when Captain Dreylil Andrus arrived to check his claim.\nWhen King Frostmantle was assassinated, Red Mazzie devised a plan to cover it up as a natural death in order to ensure a peaceful transition of power to Frostmantles widow, Queen Concettina Delcasio."
