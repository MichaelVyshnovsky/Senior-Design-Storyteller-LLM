        "History": "In [[1484 DR]], in order to gain the favor of King [[Yarin Frostmantle]], Red Mazzie captured the [[copper dragon]] sisters [[Tazmikella]] and [[Ilnezhara]]. However they were freed by [[Jarlaxle]] and Red Mazzie was without his prize when Captain [[Dreylil Andrus]] arrived to check his claim.\n\nWhen King Frostmantle was assassinated, Red Mazzie devised a plan to cover it up as a natural death in order to ensure a peaceful transition of power to Frostmantle's widow, Queen [[Concettina Delcasio]].<ref>{{Cite digital book/Hero/Nook| |27}}"
