        "mainbody": "Afzal was a prince of Tajar in the Pearl Cities of Zakhara in 1367 DR and the bane of his fathers existence.\nFoolish and pompous, Afzal was raised in luxury in the comfort of Tajar, shunning the desert heritage that his father was so proud of. He was surrounded by friends who only spoke of his greatness.\nThe prince was an honorary commander of Talabs cavalry.\nAfzal was the son of Sheikh Ali al-Hadd. Afzals mother died giving birth to him. The Sheikh never remarried after her death so Afzal, by default, was the Sheikhs only heir. Afzal was followed everywhere by his genie bodyguardsâ€“a dao and djinni."
