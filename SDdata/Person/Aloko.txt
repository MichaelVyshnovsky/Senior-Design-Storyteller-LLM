Aloko was a shaman of the Tribe of the Wise Ones, active in the late 14 century DR.
Aloko was trained by Kovarka, the chieftain and eldest shaman of the tribal Council of Elders.
In the late 14 century DR, the leader of the dreaded spider katanga, the Mother of a Thousand Young, captured several of the brave heroes of the Living Jungles as she prepared to birth an army of ravenous spider katanga. One of the heroes who returned to the tribe and brought the dire news â€“ Nathani, secretly allied with the Mother of a Thousand Young and was the cause of Alokos capture. Subsequently, several groups of heroes were sent to assassinate the Mother and rescue Aloko and their fellow prisoners.
