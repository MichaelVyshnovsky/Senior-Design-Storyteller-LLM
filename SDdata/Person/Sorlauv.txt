'''Sorlauv''' was a man of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]] around the 5{{th}} century [[DR]].

Sorlauv captured a number of [[treant]]s and conducted experiments on them, with the goal of making an army of powerful warriors who did not need food, coin, or barracks, but who could be simply planted in the earth when not required. This was until [[Eldrus Wands]], the [[Magister]] from [[409 DR]] to [[516 DR]], destroyed his fortress to "persuade" him to release the treants.
