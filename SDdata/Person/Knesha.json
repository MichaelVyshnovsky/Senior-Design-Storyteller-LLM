        "mainbody": "Knesha was a bard in Mulhorand in 1357 DR.\nKnesha was the greatest non-divine expert in lost relics and artifacts in south Mulhorand. She spent all her free time studying about places where ancient magic items disappeared.\nOnce Knesha was a scribe in Skuld until a mistake in her calculations caused a loss of taxes. She was imprisoned but managed to escape and settled in Outer Sultim, where nobody respected Skulds laws. There she found her true vocation as a bard specializing in satirical poems.\nKnesha had grown bored of her work as a bard and dreamed of going on adventures."
