'''Ekandor''' was the leader of a team of [[Red Wizard]]s who hunted the [[wild mage]] [[Neera]].

==History==
Ekandor and his fellows hunted Neera for a long time leading up to the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. They finally got to her in the town of [[Beregost]], but were turned away when Neera encountered [[Abdel Adrian]] and his adventuring party.

The Red Wizards tracked Neera across the [[Western Heartlands]] to the hidden enclave of another wild mage [[Adoy]], hidden in the [[Cloud Peaks]]. Ekandor met his untimely end in a final battle with Neera and her allies.
