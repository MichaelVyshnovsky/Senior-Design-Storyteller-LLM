==Description==
He had a narrow shoulders, leaned on a wooden cane, and had a habit of spitting as he talked in his gruff voice.

==History==
During the War Council, he was wary of the Shadovar threat and dismissive of the then Regent [[Raedra Obarskyr]]'s plans. He later had a genuine meeting with her, remarking on her successful approaches, and lamenting his distant relative, Lindon's choices.
