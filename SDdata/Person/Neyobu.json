        "mainbody": "'''Neyobu''' was an ensorcelled [[panther]] companion of [[Ras T'fima]], once the [[bara]]e of [[Ubtao]] and a ''[[gem magic|gem mage]]'' in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Don't try to get past Neyobu. Until T'fima invites you in, he'll do everything he can to keep you on that side of the door. And that's more than you might think.''|[[Alisanda Rayburton]] to [[Artus Cimber]]}}",
        "Description": "Neyobu was a big [[cat]] with night-black fur, with deadly fangs and big razor-sharp claws. It had lightning-fast reflexes.\n\nThe panther had three enchanted [[pearl]]s affixed to the forehead in a shape of a triangle with blueish white sparkles jumping from one gem to another. The magic pearls granted the cat powers, longevity being one of them.",
        "Personality": "Even though Neyobu was a dangerous and fearless beast, it followed T'fima's will and commands. The cat was playful and even gentle with allies like Negus [[Kwalu]] and Alisanda Rayburton, and an intense sentry guarding its master from strangers.",
        "Relationships": "Loyal companion of Ras T'fima, the cat lived together with the gem wizard in his sprawling hut on a riverbank, surrounded by natural and chiseled stone, [[granite]], [[limestone]], [[slate]], [[shale]], and other more exotic rocks.",
        "History": "In [[1362 DR]], Neyobu was living with its master outside of the magic walls of [[Mezro]] in Chult. During [[Artus Cimber]]'s expedition to Chult in search of the ''[[Ring of Winter]]'', Cimber and Alisanda sought Ras T'fima's aid in rescuing [[Dhalmass Rayburton]], captured by the [[Cult of Frost]] and the [[Batiri]]. The black cat guarded its master from the stranger - Artus, while letting the barae through into the [[sorcerer]]'s hut. During that visit, Neyobu pounced up onto the hut's roof like black lightning, instantly slaughtering [[Feg]], the [[flying monkey]] spy of the Cult of Frost."
