        "History": "Dag was captured by the [[Zhentarim]] when he was a young boy and raised into the ways of evil, despite the fact that he was the son of a [[paladin]]. Eventually, Dag Zoreth would mastermind the attack on his father's keep and murder him in a sacrifice to the Dark Sun.\n\nAt the head of a force of Zhentarim soldiers in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Dag Zoreth marched through the [[Clan Stoneshaft]] tunnels in the [[Sword Mountains]] to reach [[Thornhold]] on the [[Sword Coast North]]. On the way, they killed or enslaved many [[dwarves]], though Bronwyn Caradoon and [[Ebenezer Stoneshaft]] would later retake Thornhold. Thanks to the corrupt Sir Gareth of the [[Knights of Samular]], Dag Zoreth came close to possessing both ''[[Kezefbane]]'' and the ''[[rings of Samular]]'', only to be foiled by Bronwyn.",
        "Relations": "He was the estranged brother of [[Bronwyn Caradoon]].\n\nDag Zoreth had a [[half-elven]] child with the [[elf]] [[Ashemmi]],\n\n[[Malchior]], a fellow Darkhold cleric of Cyric based in [[Waterdeep]], had great influence over Dag's decisions there, thanks to a combination of blackmail, subtle deceit, and charisma. Dag and Malchior were the only ones aware of Sir [[Gareth Cormaeril]]'s corruption and conversion to Cyric.",
        "Abilities": "As a cleric, he commanded the [[Trickery domain]]."
