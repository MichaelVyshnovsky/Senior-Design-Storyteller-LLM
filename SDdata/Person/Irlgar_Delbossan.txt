'''Delbossan''' was a stable master in [[Espar]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Delbossan was a valiant [[adventurer]] and [[thief]] active along the trade route linking the [[Inner Sea]] lands with the [[Sword Coast]]. In time, he stole so many horses and acted as horse-tender for so many caravans that he actually learned how to train horses. 

He decided to settle in Espar and become the assistant of the old stable-master, [[Heuran]]. After Heuran's death, Delbossan succeeded him as the new stable-master.

==Activities==
Delbossan was the stable-master of Lord [[Hezom]].

==Personality==
Delbossan was a taciturn man with a quiet competence in the training and care of horses.
