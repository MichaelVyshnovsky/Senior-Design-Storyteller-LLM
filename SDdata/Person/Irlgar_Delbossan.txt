Delbossan was a stable master in Espar in 1357 DR.
Delbossan was a valiant adventurer and thief active along the trade route linking the Inner Sea lands with the Sword Coast. In time, he stole so many horses and acted as horse-tender for so many caravans that he actually learned how to train horses. 
He decided to settle in Espar and become the assistant of the old stable-master, Heuran. After Heurans death, Delbossan succeeded him as the new stable-master.
Delbossan was the stable-master of Lord Hezom.
Delbossan was a taciturn man with a quiet competence in the training and care of horses.
