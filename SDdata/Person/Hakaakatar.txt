Hakaakatar was a hobgoblin shaman and priest of Iyachtu Xvim, who served a small tribe around 1369 DR under the fire giant Oghalis in the Hullack Forest.
Hakaakatar was canny and pragmatic in his advice.
Hakaakatar was unusually wise for a hobgoblin, and as a cleric of Xvim could cast a number of offensively-minded divine spells.
He served the chief Gugak Thul as a temporal and spiritual advisor, and counselled him to continue working with Oghalis for as long as it was beneficial.
In the , the tribe suffered many losses as they attempted to live in the Hullack Forest, and accepted the leadership of the fire giant Oghalis. They turned to woodcutting and exploratory copper mining and began enslaving the local satyrs and centaurs, but they proved unsuitable for copper smelting. The tribe then began kidnapping humans from the nearby town of Thunderstone, forcing their satyrs to abduct Troyappa, Kenhart, Joelem, and Jonren. This finally drew the attention of Cormyrean adventurers, who raided the camp and freed the slaves.
