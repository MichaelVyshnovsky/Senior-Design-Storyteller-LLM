        "mainbody": "Ursuntos was the Grand Disciple of Orcus who oversaw the Temple of Filth in the Shadowfell city of Evernight as of the late 15 century DR.\nHe was a ghoul whose appearance was so gruesome and horrid that he struck fear even among other worshipers of Orcus. He carried a holy symbol of Orcus and grasped a rod within his claws.\nUrsuntos spoke with a raspy voice. He hungered for the flesh of his enemies, and would recite a series of oaths to Orcus as he prepared their bodies to be eaten.\nUrsuntos could paralyze his foes with his voice, allowing his allies to mob them. Any ghoul who was slain in his presence would rise again as a zombie.\nUrsuntos was the most politically powerful being in Evernight aside from the tribunal. His ghoul and vampire underpriests tended to his every whim with haste.\nIt was said that, in life, Ursuntos had been a servant of Orcus who killed and ate a priest of Bahamut, and when he finally died&mdashwith a prayer to Orcus on his lips&mdashthis great sin caused him to experience an unholy transformation into a powerful and terrifying ghoul in Orcuss service. As of the , he had become the Grand Disciple at the Temple of Filth."
