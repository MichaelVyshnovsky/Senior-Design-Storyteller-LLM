'''Cedric Buckenwing''' was an inhabitant of the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Cedric was a buddy of [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] and other young men in Ghars in the {{YearlinkName|1366}}. In [[Eleint]], they got drunk on cheap [[beer]] and Cedric challenged Jasper to steal something from the retired [[War Wizard]] [[Benelaius]]. He agreed and they all rode out together to his cottage. Jasper was caught and later reflected that real friends wouldn't've let him be so stupid.
