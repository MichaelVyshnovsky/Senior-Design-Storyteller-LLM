        "mainbody": "eya Nihmedu was a young noble moon elf that lived in Evereska as of the late 14 century DR. While quite young, she served as a sentry of citys Long Watch and played a significant role in the series of events that came to be known across the Realms as the Return of the Archwizards.\nShe had long blue hair and eyes that were flecked with gold.\nAt the tender young age of 80 years old,\nAfter joining the Evereskan Long Watch, Keya gained admittance to the Company of the Cold Hand, an elite fighting force specifically formed to defend Evereska from the threat of the phaerimm.\nKeya was born to Aubric Nihmedu, First Sword of the Swords of Evereska and Lady Morgwais Nightmeadow of Reitheillaethor. She was especially proud of her father but felt great worry when he was called to service. She became distraught after hearing of his death, but remained dutiful to her city and her people.\nShe became fast friends with the Vaasan warrior woman Vala Thorsdotter, the leader of an expedition that traveled for a time alongside her brother Galaeron. Their friendship became evident to all when Vala threatened to castrate Galaeron after snapping at his younger sister.\nKeya grew even closer to Dexon, one of the Vaasan warriors that served under Vala and remained at Evereska to help ensure its defense. The unlikely couple—a young elven scout and burly human warrior that could be mistaken for a bear—quickly fell in love, and Keya was soon expectant with child.\nWhen the phaerimm returned to the Realms and threatened Evereska in Nightal of the , Keya was pressed into service in the Evereskan Long Watch. She served as a sentry atop the livery watchtower and was the first elf to spot enemy activity across the face of Snagglefang mountain, as Khelben Arunsun and his allies fought the phaerimm at the Battle of Rocnest. \nAfter the phaerimm formed the deadwall around Evereska, Keya and the rest of the Long Watch remained trapped within. When the Khelben Arunsun arrived in Evereska to lead the counterattack against the phaerimm, Keyas lover Dexon and the other Vaasans joined the Waterdhavian archmage. For the moment Keya prepared herself to be away from Dexon for a time, and remain behind in the city. \nFortunes turned however when Khelben and the Vaasans led a counterattack against the besieging phaerimm, and the Long Watch were selected as their vanguard. They had run out of time and Evereskas protective mythal was about to fail them. The assault was almost immediately put to an end, when it became apparent the surrounding Vine Vale had become a death trap. Once the forces regrouped, Keya, Dexon, Khelben and the rest of the combined Long Watch and Cold Hand forces launched a final, desperate assault at the phaerimm, aided just in time by Khelbens partner Laeral Silverhand and her Shadovar allies. While Dexon was gravely wounded in the battle, both he and Keya were able to safely return to Evereska together."
