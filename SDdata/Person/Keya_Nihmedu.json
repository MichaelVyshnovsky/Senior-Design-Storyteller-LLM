        "mainbody": "'''Keya Nihmedu''' was a young noble [[moon elf]] that lived in [[Evereska]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/281/Rogues Gallery: Heroes of the Summoning|80}} While quite young, she served as a sentry of city's [[Long Watch]] and played a significant role in the series of events that came to be known across the Realms as the [[Return of the Archwizards (event)|Return of the Archwizards]].\n\n{{Quote|Only that this is my home we are defending. You wouldn't be trying to rid yourself of me, would you Dex...you must think we incapable of carrying my weight in such an elite band of phaerimm killers. Perhaps you think I am not brave enough.|Keya to Dexon, when he suggested she avoid battle out of concern for her safety.}}",
        "Description": "She had long blue hair and eyes that were flecked with gold.",
        "Personality": "At the tender young age of 80 years old,",
        "Activities": "After joining the Evereskan Long Watch, Keya gained admittance to the [[Company of the Cold Hand]], an elite fighting force specifically formed to defend Evereska from the threat of the [[phaerimm]].",
        "Relationships": "Keya was born to [[Aubric Nihmedu]], First Sword of the [[Swords of Evereska]] and Lady [[Morgwais Nightmeadow]] of [[Reitheillaethor]]. She was especially proud of her father but felt great worry when he was called to service. She became distraught after hearing of his death, but remained dutiful to her city and her people.\n\nShe became fast friends with the [[Vaasan]] warrior woman [[Vala Thorsdotter]], the leader of an expedition that traveled for a time alongside her brother [[Galaeron Nihmedu|Galaeron]]. Their friendship became evident to all when Vala threatened to castrate Galaeron after snapping at his younger sister.\n\nKeya grew even closer to [[Dexon]], one of the Vaasan warriors that served under Vala and remained at Evereska to help ensure its defense. The unlikely couple—a young elven scout and burly human warrior that could be mistaken for a bear—quickly fell in love,<ref name=\"RotA.Siege-p402-407> and Keya was soon expectant with child.<ref name=\"RotA.Siege-p408-415 />",
        "History": "When the [[phaerimm]] returned to the Realms and threatened Evereska in [[Nightal]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Keya was pressed into service in the Evereskan Long Watch. She served as a sentry atop the livery watchtower and was the first elf to spot enemy activity across the face of [[Snagglefang]] mountain, as [[Khelben Arunsun]] and his allies fought the phaerimm at the [[Battle of Rocnest]]. \n\nAfter the phaerimm formed the [[deadwall]] around Evereska, Keya and the rest of the Long Watch remained trapped within. When the [[Khelben Arunsun]] arrived in Evereska to lead the counterattack against the phaerimm, Keya's lover Dexon and the other Vaasans joined the [[Waterdhavian]] [[archmage]]. For the moment Keya prepared herself to be away from Dexon for a time, and remain behind in the city.<ref name=\"RotA.Siege-p402-407 /> \n\nFortunes turned however when Khelben and the Vaasan's led a counterattack against the besieging phaerimm, and the Long Watch were selected as their vanguard. They had run out of time and Evereska's protective ''[[mythal]]'' was about to fail them. The assault was almost immediately put to an end, when it became apparent the surrounding [[Vine Vale]] had become a death trap. Once the forces regrouped, Keya, Dexon, Khelben and the rest of the combined Long Watch and [[Cold Hand]] forces [[Battle of Vine Vale|launched a final, desperate assault]] at the phaerimm, aided just in time by Khelben's partner [[Laeral Silverhand]] and her [[Shadovar]] allies. While Dexon was gravely wounded in the battle, both he and Keya were able to safely return to Evereska together."
