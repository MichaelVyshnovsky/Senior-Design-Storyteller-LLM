'''Thradisar Starwise''' was an [[elf]] who lived in [[New Sharandar]] within the [[Feywild]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Template:Cite game/Neverwinter: Fury of the Feywild}}

{{Quote|Travel the path, enter the portal, and prepare for the fury of the [[Feywild]]|Tharidar Starwise, to the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]].}}

==Possessions==
Thradisar kept a variety of useful items that he could offer outlanders, if they proved themselves as allies of the [[Iliyanbruen]] elves. Among these were ''[[potions of heroism]]'' and ''[[potion of healing|potions of fey healing]]''.

He also owned and maintained several sets of ''[[Iliyanbruen ancestral armor]]'' that were recovered from the ancient elven kingdom of [[Iliyanbruen]] and its capital of [[Sharandar|Old Sharandar]].

==Relationships==
Thradisar rode atop a majestic [[unicorn]] steed.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[fomorian]] king [[Malabog]] began a war of conquest against the elves of New Sharandar. In response the elves' leader sent an emissary to [[Neverwinter]] in search of the aid from a great adventurer and formed a welcoming party that would meet them in the [[Neverwinter Wood]] near the ''[[Fey Crossing]]''. Thradisar was among the elves that welcomed the adventurers from Neverwinter and helped guide them to the portal to the Feywild.
