        "mainbody": "'''Oghalis''' was an industrious [[fire giant]] who led a tribe of [[hobgoblin]]s in the [[Hullack Forest]] in [[1369 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Oghalis was a harsh and unforgiving leader, and punished any dissent or questioning of her orders severely. She seemed to be obsessed with harvesting lumber and [[copper]] from the forest, but refused to explain her motivations.",
        "Possessions": "In battle, she fought with a huge [[greatsword]] and wore [[banded mail]]. She had a secret stash containing twelve 1,000 [[gp]] [[fire opal]]s, a ''[[potion of longevity]]'', a ''[[ring of warmth]]'', an ''[[Figurine of wondrous power|onyx dog figurine]]'', and a much-too-small-to-use ''+3 [[handaxe]]''.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Oghalis and her four [[ogre]] enforcers took over a tribe of hobgoblins from their chief [[Gugak Thul]] and their shaman [[Hakaakatar]], aiming to use them for a secret mission she had been assigned. She separated the young and female hobgoblins from the main body, and had them encamped separately near the [[Thunder Gap]] until her goals were reached.\n\nIn the Hullack Forest, she had the hobgoblins clear-cut as much lumber as possible. When a rich vein of copper was discovered, she had a small mine and smelter built, and soon the camp began producing stacks of copper ingots as well. To increase production, they attempted to enslave the local [[centaur]]s and [[satyr]]s, but the woodland folk proved entirely unsuitable for underground mining and industrial smelting. The next attempt involving kidnapping and enslaving [[human]]s from the nearby town of [[Thunderstone]], which resulted in [[Troyappa]], [[Kenhart]], [[Joelem]], and [[Jonren]] working the smelter for her.\n\nBefore her operation could proceed for more than a few months, the kidnappings drew the attention of [[Cormyr]]ean adventurers, who raided the encampment and freed her slaves."
