Aarun was a Harper in Icewind Dale in 1485 DR.
Aarun was a member of the Harpers based in Ten Towns. In 1485 DR, he grew suspicious about Vaelish Gant and his minions. Aarun discovered that Vaelishs minions were wererats of Ship Rethnor and contacted fellow Harper Emryn Dawe in Luskan, requesting silver weapons. Emryn promised to send them in the next shipment but, in the meantime, Vaelish discovered Aaruns true nature. He faked a letter from Mithann, leading him into an ambush, where he murdered Aarun.
