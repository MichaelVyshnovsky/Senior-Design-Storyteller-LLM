Hadarr Karakaya was a Calishite explorer in Daggerford circa 1486 DR.
Hadarr was an impulsive individual. Although he liked company, he thought that he worked better alone for his own interests. In truth, he had a heart of gold, always helping others without thinking about it, and for this he was a good friend of Sir Isteval. 
In battle, Hadarr wore dragon skin leather armor and fought with twin silver scimitars.
Hadarr went adventuring alongside Sir Isteval and Jekk Ironfist until some point before 1476 DR, but often abandoned the company in favour of something more interesting to him along the way. In Daggerford, he was a folk hero for the Calishite community taking refuge there, as he helped in all ways possible, even thieving from rich people.
