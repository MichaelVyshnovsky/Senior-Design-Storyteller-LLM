'''Hadarr Karakaya''' was a [[Calishite]] explorer in [[Daggerford]] circa [[1486 DR]].

==Personality==
Hadarr was an impulsive individual. Although he liked company, he thought that he worked better alone for his own interests. In truth, he had a heart of gold, always helping others without thinking about it, and for this he was a good friend of Sir [[Isteval]]. 

==Possessions==
In battle, Hadarr wore [[dragon|dragon skin]] [[leather armor]] and fought with twin [[silver]] [[scimitar]]s.

==History==
Hadarr went adventuring alongside Sir Isteval and [[Jekk Ironfist]] until some point before [[1476 DR]], but often abandoned the company in favour of something more interesting to him along the way. In Daggerford, he was a folk hero for the Calishite community taking refuge there, as he helped in all ways possible, even thieving from rich people.
