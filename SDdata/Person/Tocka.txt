Tocka was rescued by the future Sultana of [[Hiyal]], [[Alurah bint Asrah]], when her late-husband destroyed the Gilded Palm. Tocka became Alurah's personal servant and confidant. Those who knew of Tocka's association with the Gilded Palm often pleaded to him about their problems to make them disappear.
