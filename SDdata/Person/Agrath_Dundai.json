        "mainbody": "grath Dundai was the proprietor of the Watchful Turtle warehouses in Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale by 1366 DR and through 1370 DR.\nHe was a bearded old man possessed of a wry humor. He told many tales about Loudwater and the surrounding lands. For example, he spread the rumor that there was a crypt beneath the High Lords Hall, supposedly haunted by undead, namely the remnants of former High Lords of Loudwater, and that some of them had experimented with dark magic."
