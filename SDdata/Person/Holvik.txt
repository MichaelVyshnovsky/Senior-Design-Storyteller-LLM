'''Holvik''' was a [[duergar]] member of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Holvik had gray skin and a short white beard. He was wrapped in a [[leather armor]] and wore a leather [[helmet]]. In battle, Holvik wielded a [[crossbow]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Holvik accompanied slaver [[Gekh Coal]] and his duergar med to a decrepit coastal village in the [[Underdark]] that once was a [[deep gnome]] colony. On the behest of the Absolute, duergar held the ruined village to be used as a [[skiff]] port to transport goods and slaves to the [[Grymforge]]. With the events of the [[Absolute crisis]] unfolding, Holvik and his fellow duergar could have faced several fates; they could've been confronted by and slain by the [[Absolute Adversaries]] as they sought passage to the Grymforge or as a favor to an aspiring [[myconid]] sovereign [[Glut]].
