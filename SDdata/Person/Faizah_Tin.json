When they stormed the mage's tower in the [[Baldur's Gate/Temples District|Temples District]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], the entire party was ''[[petrified]]'' by a [[basilisk]].\n\nHaving been turned into stone, the lot of them were sold to an art collector by the name of [[Felonius Gist]]. The statues were considered quite the unique pieces of art in luxurious surroundings of the [[Gist]] noble estate in the city."
