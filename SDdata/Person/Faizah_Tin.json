        "mainbody": "Faizah Tin was a mage who lived in the Realms during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe was somewhat of a cynic, believing that others would not do good merely for the sake of it.\nFaizah Tin was an acquaintance of an elven warrior named Vail.\nAt some point, Faizah joined Vail on a venture that saw them and some other mercenaries storming the tower of the famous wizard Ramazith Flamesinger. When they stormed the mages tower in the Temples District of Baldurs Gate, the entire party was petrified by a basilisk.\nHaving been turned into stone, the lot of them were sold to an art collector by the name of Felonius Gist. The statues were considered quite the unique pieces of art in luxurious surroundings of the Gist noble estate in the city."
