'''Kortolt Rushtyn''' was a priest of [[Ilmater]] from the city of [[Mussum]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]], who preached near [[Hlondeth]] in the early 1340s [[DR]].

==History==
Kortolt Rushtyn was a young underpriest at the [[House of Holy Suffering]] in Mussum, ''circa'' [[1342 DR]], when he received visions from the god Ilmater directing him to the hidden ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', the most holy book of the [[church of Ilmater|faith]]. However, rather than take it back to Mussum or its traditional home of the [[House of the Broken God]] in [[Keltar]], Kortolt took it to [[Raven's Rack]], an isolated shrine to the god west of Hlondeth, on [[Tanarspear Hill]]. Here, Kortolt made use of the ''Tome'' to aid both believers and non-believers, and to preach about Ilmater. The people of Hlondeth came to see Kortolt as a gift from the gods, one who kept them safe and well when they were sick or injured.

However, in winter of the [[1343 DR|Year of the Boot, 1343 DR]], Kortolt was killed by bandits. They attempted to sell the ''Tome'' in Hlondeth, only to be killed themselves by a mob angry at the death of the much-loved priest. The people presented the ''Tome'' to the [[Graycloak's Wolves]] adventuring company, to take to Master Sufferer [[Olbedan]] in [[Aralent]].
