Thoob was a cultist of Levistus who lived at the castle of Caer-Dineval in the Ten-Towns during the late 15 century DR.
Fitting for his position within the cult, Thoob had a distinctly servile demeanor. While he endured the abuse of his master, he in turn found joy in domineering over others.
He acted as a servant to the cults leader Kadroth.
