'''Thoob''' was a [[Knights of the Black Sword|cultist]] of [[Levistus]] who lived at the [[Caer-Dineval keep|castle]] of [[Caer-Dineval]] in the [[Ten-Towns]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Fitting for his position within the cult, Thoob had a distinctly servile demeanor. While he endured the abuse of his master, he in turn found joy in domineering over others.

==Activities==
He acted as a servant to the cult's leader [[Kadroth]].
