'''Sharlz Molar''' was an inhabitant of the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Look, whatever you're doing, it's obviously pissing off those hacks at the gazette. So crack on.''|Sharlz Molar}}

==Description==
Sharlz was an [[wood elven]] man with greenish tan skin. He had dark curly hair and red eyes. The elf wore embroidered finery.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, Sharlz Molar could be found gossiping in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] with his friend â€“ [[Iza Blouin]]. Iza eagerly consumed the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazetteer,'' and even though she knew one should not believe every word that the [[broadsheet]] printed, Iza still avoided associating with individuals who were bad-mouthed by the publication. Unlike his friend, Sharlz insisted that everything in the ''Gazette'' was lies and encouraged anyone who was shown in the broadsheet in bad light.
