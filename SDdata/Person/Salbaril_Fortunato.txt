'''Salbaril Fortunato''' was the [[priest]] of the [[Lodge of Luck]], the shrine of [[Tymora]] in [[Halfhap]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
He was a handsome young man who seemed to have a perpetual smirking expression. He was ridiculously lucky in all things.

==Relationships==
He was greatly amused by the hatred the local priest of [[Tempus]] [[Boneblaster]] had for him.
