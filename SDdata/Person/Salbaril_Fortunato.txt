Salbaril Fortunato was the priest of the Lodge of Luck, the shrine of Tymora in Halfhap circa 1369 DR.
He was a handsome young man who seemed to have a perpetual smirking expression. He was ridiculously lucky in all things.
He was greatly amused by the hatred the local priest of Tempus Boneblaster had for him.
