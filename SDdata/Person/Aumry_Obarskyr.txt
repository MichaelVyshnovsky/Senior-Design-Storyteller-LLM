'''Aumry Obarskyr''' was the Lord of [[Shadowdale]] from [[1300 DR]] to [[1339 DR]]. His last name, [[Obarskyr]] of [[Cormyr]], was known only to a few individuals. He was the husband of [[Syluné Silverhand]]. He ruled Shadowdale peacefully until his assassination by [[Zhentarim]] agents in 1339 DR. His assassins were captured and killed by [[Jyordhan]], but Jyordhan was himself a hidden Zhentarim agent.

Aumry was laid to rest in [[Aumry's Tomb]], on [[Watcher's Knoll]] in [[Shadowdale]]. His wife eventually died in [[1356 DR]].
