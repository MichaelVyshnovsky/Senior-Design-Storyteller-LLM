'''Aglatha Shrey''' was a [[half-ogre]] order clerk for the [[Aurora's Realms Shop, Slut Street Catalogue Counter]] in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Described as flint-eyed, Aglatha stood 7 feet (2.1 meters) high and was twice as wide as a [[human]] man, and had a muscular build, making her very strong.

==Activities==
Aglatha worked as an order clerk in the Aurora's Realms Shop, aided by two brawny guards who were still smaller than her, and she clearly didn't need their protection. In her free time, she enjoyed participating in tavern brawls, especially hurling men through doors, windows, and even tables.

==History==
When he visited in the mid-1360s DR, Aglatha refused to give any information to [[Volothamp Geddarm]], not even her own name.
