Aglatha Shrey was a half-ogre order clerk for the Auroras Realms Shop, Slut Street Catalogue Counter in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Described as flint-eyed, Aglatha stood 7 feet (2.1 meters) high and was twice as wide as a human man, and had a muscular build, making her very strong.
Aglatha worked as an order clerk in the Auroras Realms Shop, aided by two brawny guards who were still smaller than her, and she clearly didnt need their protection. In her free time, she enjoyed participating in tavern brawls, especially hurling men through doors, windows, and even tables.
When he visited in the mid-1360s DR, Aglatha refused to give any information to Volothamp Geddarm, not even her own name.
