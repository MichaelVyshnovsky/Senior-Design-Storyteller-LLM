Vers Never was the founder of the Neverember noble family of Waterdeep, and its patriarch during the late 14 century DR.
Vers Never was the husband of Mirtria Ember. According to some unconfirmed rumors, Vers was the bastard son of Nasher Alagondar, and the younger half-brother of Bann Alagondar.
According to some sages, Vers was an adventurer who settled in Waterdeep in the late years of the 14 century DR. After he married Mirtria, he founded the Neverember family.
According to some detractors of Dagult Neverember, Vers Never never existed, as there is little historical evidence about him. They claimed that Dagult Neverember may have created this "Vers Never" character to get the right to claim Neverwinters throne. Other scholars believe that while Vers Never may have actually existed, there is the possibility that he died childless.
