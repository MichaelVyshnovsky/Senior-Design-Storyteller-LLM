Fusamu was a spinning spider katanga who served the Mother of a Thousand Young within the Fire Mountain of the Malatran Plateau in the late 14 century DR.
Fusamu used her magical skills to support spider katanga warriors who were put to the sentry duty alongside her.
As a sorcerer, Fusamu learned how to empower her spells and cast magics without uttering a single word. Her spell repertoire consisted of support magics, and she was wrapped in the mage armor spell most of the time. The slow spell was the most powerful spell at Fusamus disposal.
She was armed with daggers made out of carved bone and numerous spell fetishes that held various spells inside, ready to be activated.
In the late 14 century DR, the Tribe of the Wise Ones became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded spider katanga, the Mother of a Thousand Young, was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Fusamu was posted to guard a stockade of captured heroes of the Living Jungle, enemies of the Mother of a Thousand Young. She was accompanied by Lulaku and Turanu, a duo of female hunting spider katanga. The spider katanga were guarding several Nubari humans and lizardfolk. Fusamu was loyal to Talunuku, a spider katanga who was secretly responsible for the poison and sought to become the new Mother of a Thousand Young.
Fusamus fate was unknown however, she and other guards were faced with heroes of the Living Jungle that were sent to rescue the prisoners and stop the Mother of a Thousand Young.
