'''Fusamu''' was a [[spinning spider katanga]] who served the [[Mother of a Thousand Young]] within the [[Fire Mountain]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Fusamu used her magical skills to support [[spider katanga]] warriors who were put to the sentry duty alongside her.

==Abilities==
As a [[sorcerer]], Fusamu learned how to empower her spells and cast magics without uttering a single word. Her spell repertoire consisted of support magics, and she was wrapped in the ''[[mage armor]]'' spell most of the time. The ''[[slow]]'' spell was the most powerful spell at Fusamu's disposal.

==Possessions==
She was armed with [[dagger]]s made out of carved bone and numerous ''[[spell fetish]]es'' that held various spells inside, ready to be activated.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Tribe of the Wise Ones]] became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded [[spider katanga]], the Mother of a Thousand Young, was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Fusamu was posted to guard a stockade of captured heroes of the Living Jungle, enemies of the Mother of a Thousand Young. She was accompanied by [[Lulaku]] and [[Turanu]], a duo of female [[hunting spider katanga]]. The spider katanga were guarding several [[Nubari]] [[human]]s and [[lizardfolk]]. Fusamu was loyal to [[Talunuku]], a spider katanga who was secretly responsible for the poison and sought to become the new Mother of a Thousand Young.

Fusamu's fate was unknown; however, she and other guards were faced with heroes of the Living Jungle that were sent to rescue the prisoners and stop the Mother of a Thousand Young.
