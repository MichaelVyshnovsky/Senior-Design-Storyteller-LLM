        "mainbody": "Lady '''Holiday Hlath''' was the heiress of the noble [[patriar]] [[Hlath (family)|Hlath]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Lord Orthagon]] was already an old man who was the leader of the family only symbolically. His matron daughter, [[Merrigold Hlath]] was making all financial and social family discussions in Orthagon's place. When the [[Absolute crisis]] arrived to the Gate, Orthagon Hlath was noted by the [[Cult of Bane]] as a vulnerable patriar through his beloved grand-neice Holiday, a young woman of insatiable gabling habits and an impressive collection of debts from all gambling dens between [[Stonyeyes]] and [[Sow's Foot]] neighborhoods."
