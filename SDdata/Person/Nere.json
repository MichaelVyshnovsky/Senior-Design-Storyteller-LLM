        "mainbody": "ere was a drow leader within the cult of the Absolute that dwelled within Moonrise Towers during the late 15 century DR. He famously launched a failed excavation into the ruins of Grymforge in the name of the Absolute that nearly led to his own death.\nHe was an egocentric individual who did not take ownership of his failures but rather projected them onto others.\nNere wore a set of lavish black robes, with a fur-line half-cloak fastened by a talisman bearing the symbol of the Absolute, along with a very old pair of Night Walkers. He wielded a magical rapier called the sword of screams.\nThe True Soul was also in the possession of a moonlantern, a magical light sourced that granted him passage through the shadow-cursed lands around Moonrise Towers.\nNere was subordinate to an individual referred to as the General, one of the Absolutes three most powerful servants.\nIn the , Nere was tasked with leading an excursion into the depths of Grymforge in order to find a long-lost Shaaran temple. Nere directed Sergeant Thrinn and her fellow duergar cultists, along with the dwarven mercenaries of Clan Flameshade, and set up within the abandoned halls of Grymforge. They enslaved the deep gnomes of Clan Ironhand and forced them to dig through the earth towards the entrance to the temple. Unfortunately for Nere, he remained at the front of the dig just as neared the temples front doors, and became trapped with the gnome miners after the tunnel collapsed behind them."
