        "mainbody": "'''Malune Nalonkrivar''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|977}} to {{yearlink|983}}.",
        "Appearance": "He was tall and handsome, with a beard, icy blue eyes, and sharp features.",
        "Personality": "Malune was described as a master of intrigues, and a smooth-tongued man.",
        "Possessions": "As the Magister, Malune employed little beyond his own [[spellbook]] and a ''[[ring of flying]]''. The remainder of his wealth was cached throughout Faer√ªn, with his possessions previous to becoming the Magister in particular being in a ruined castle.",
        "History": "Before his tenure, Malune had been an ambassador to [[Thay]], [[Tharsult]], [[Mulhorand]], and [[Tethyr]]; however, he was not seen as adequate, because of his reluctance to bluster and threaten. On the day he was offered the position of the [[Magister]], Malune was the target of an assassination attempt; [[Azuth]] carried the two of them away from the assassins, up over the night sky of [[Calimport]], through a ceiling that turned to gas temporarily. Malune, viewing his previous life as forfeit, accepted.\n\nAs the Magister, Malune traveled extensively, stopping only to aid mages and experience local delights; his acumen with business ensured he never had any trouble with money, while his power was sufficient to casually win duels. He died in the [[Tunland]], after the winter snows of {{yearlink|983}} swelled the swamps; on stopping to rest, he accidentally wandered into a [[black dragon]]'s ambush. The dragon, [[Constulgrael]], decapitated him with a single bite before he could do anything.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It is said many of the mages Malune stopped to aid were young, comely women; Malune judged this was so, and viewed it as a sign of [[Mystra]]'s favor, for she brought such delights close by."
