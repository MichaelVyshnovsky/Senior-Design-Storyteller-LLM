'''Ko La Ko''' was a promising young [[wu jen]] of the mercantile [[Ko clan]] of [[Shou Lung]] around {{YearlinkConvert|2608|SY}}.

==History==
Sensing his talent, his grandfather the great wu jen [[Ko Ho San]] took him on as apprentice and together they investigated the [[Black Leopard Cult]]. Together with some adventurers hired by Ko Ho San, he went to search for information in [[H'sin-to]], at the mouth of the [[Fenghsintzu River]] in [[T'u Lung]].

During the journey, they met [[Hu Sen]] on [[Mad Monkey Island]], who offered to teach them his own [[martial art]], [[Mad Monkey (martial art)|Mad Monkey]].

In T'u Lung, they fought and defeated the [[demon]] known as the [[Dragon Claw]]. It was possible that, if Hu Sen appeared and offer to take them on as his monk disciples in the art of the Mad Monkey, Ko La Ko would readily accept, becoming a [[monk]] and departing off on adventures with his new master.

==Personality==
Ko La Ko was a kindly individual who had not yet shown his true potential. He was unsuited to merchant life.
