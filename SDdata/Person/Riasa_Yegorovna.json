        "mainbody": "Riasa Yegorovna (pronounced REE-suh YAY-gore-OVE-nuh) was a girl in Mulmaster.\nRiasa was an easily excitable, but a little unfocused girl. She was easily distracted and her attention easily drifted. She was a little clumsy, though stronger than she looked.\nRiasa was the daughter of Blade Pankin Yegorovna.\nIn 1491 DR, she became the disciple of Thylius Caramitru, a minor noble who claimed to have learned at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose the new meditation technique of the Yellow Breath. They gave a demonstration during a party hosted by Astrid Saj and Rosealine Culkin to honor Aleyd Burral, the Resurrected Hero of Phlan.\nAfter Riasas father became angry about her frequentation of Thylius and confined her in the heavily guarded Tower of Blades"
