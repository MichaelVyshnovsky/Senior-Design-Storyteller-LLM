        "mainbody": "Lady '''Addee Ulphor''' was a ruler of [[Shadowdale]] in the mid-to-late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], reigning from [[1459 DR]] to [[1487 DR]].<ref name=EGP-ST /><ref name=FRCG-p112 />\n{{quote|''My name is Lady Addee Ulphor, the ruler of Shadowdale. I have a matter that needs attending, and I was hoping you could help me, and Shadowdale, with this matter.''|''Lady Addee Ulphor asking for help from a group of adventurers.''{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Lady in Flames|6}}}}",
        "Description": "Lady Addee was a sturdy woman, short in stature yet possessing a broad and well-built physique. Her features included dark brown eyes and brown hair, with a noticeable streak of gray framing her ears.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Lady in Flames|38}}",
        "Personality": "Addee possessed a multifaceted personality. She was renowned for her culinary skills, adeptness in physical activities, and fearlessness towards hard work. Additionally, she demonstrated swiftness of wit and an exceptional memory for names and faces. Her conservative nature led her to be skeptical of new methods and customs, though she was not overly prim. Moreover, she could exhibit a sharp tongue when necessary.",
        "Relationships": "Lady Ulphor held a notable disapproval towards the sage [[Elminster]]. She was not charmed by him and disapproved of his tendency to venture to unconventional places, engage in peculiar activities, indulge in whimsy, and openly share his experiences, fearing that his actions could lead to discord and upheaval among the populace.",
        "Possessions": "Addee possessed the [[Pendant of Ashaba]], a significant symbol of authority in Shadowdale, which she acquired when Lord Azalar Falconhand resigned his lordship, passing the pendant to her. She kept it safe in the upper levels of the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]].<ref name=FRCG-p112 /><ref name=WotSQ-p9>",
        "History": "Addee Ulphor was born in [[Harrowdale]] to parents who fled [[Sembia]]n turmoil in [[Deepingdale]]. She later became a shieldmaiden in the Tower of Ashaba guard, but demonstrated leadership qualities as the ''de facto'' chatelaine of the tower. Thus, she was chosen by Lord [[Azalar Falconhand]] to succeed him and she assumed the role of Lady of Shadowdale on [[Mirtul 9]] in the {{YearlinkName|1459}}, upon his retirement.<ref name=EGP-ST />\n\nDuring her lordship, Shadowdale faced frequent threats from invaders, particularly [[Zhentarim]]-affiliated forces. Despite these challenges, Addee governed capably and earned the respect of her people.<ref name=EGP-ST />\n\nTragically, Addee was gravely wounded in combat against [[Netherese]]-directed mercenaries on [[Marpenoth 9]] in the {{YearlinkName|1487}}. She passed away three days later, on [[Marpenoth 12]], naming her close friend [[Khara Sulwood]] as her successor on her deathbed. Khara, who had ridden from battle to be with Addee in her final moments, returned to the fray after her passing, determined to honor Addee's legacy.<ref name=EGP-ST />",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The correct spelling of Lady Ulphor's name was apparently 'Adee,' not 'Addee.' This discrepancy arose from a recurring spelling error made by scribes associated with the Twisted Tower.<ref name=EGP-ST />"
