        "mainbody": "Lady Addee Ulphor was a ruler of Shadowdale in the mid-to-late 15 century DR, reigning from 1459 DR to 1487 DR.\nLady Addee was a sturdy woman, short in stature yet possessing a broad and well-built physique. Her features included dark brown eyes and brown hair, with a noticeable streak of gray framing her ears.\nAddee possessed a multifaceted personality. She was renowned for her culinary skills, adeptness in physical activities, and fearlessness towards hard work. Additionally, she demonstrated swiftness of wit and an exceptional memory for names and faces. Her conservative nature led her to be skeptical of new methods and customs, though she was not overly prim. Moreover, she could exhibit a sharp tongue when necessary.\nLady Ulphor held a notable disapproval towards the sage Elminster. She was not charmed by him and disapproved of his tendency to venture to unconventional places, engage in peculiar activities, indulge in whimsy, and openly share his experiences, fearing that his actions could lead to discord and upheaval among the populace.\nAddee possessed the Pendant of Ashaba, a significant symbol of authority in Shadowdale, which she acquired when Lord Azalar Falconhand resigned his lordship, passing the pendant to her. She kept it safe in the upper levels of the Twisted Tower of Ashaba.\nAddee Ulphor was born in Harrowdale to parents who fled Sembian turmoil in Deepingdale. She later became a shieldmaiden in the Tower of Ashaba guard, but demonstrated leadership qualities as the de facto chatelaine of the tower. Thus, she was chosen by Lord Azalar Falconhand to succeed him and she assumed the role of Lady of Shadowdale on Mirtul 9 in the , upon his retirement.\nDuring her lordship, Shadowdale faced frequent threats from invaders, particularly Zhentarim-affiliated forces. Despite these challenges, Addee governed capably and earned the respect of her people.\nTragically, Addee was gravely wounded in combat against Netherese-directed mercenaries on Marpenoth 9 in the . She passed away three days later, on Marpenoth 12, naming her close friend Khara Sulwood as her successor on her deathbed. Khara, who had ridden from battle to be with Addee in her final moments, returned to the fray after her passing, determined to honor Addees legacy.\nThe correct spelling of Lady Ulphors name was apparently Adee, not Addee. This discrepancy arose from a recurring spelling error made by scribes associated with the Twisted Tower."
