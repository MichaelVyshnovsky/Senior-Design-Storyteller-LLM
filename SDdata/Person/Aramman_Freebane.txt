Aramman Freebane was the ruler of Kzelter in the Lake of Steam region during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Aramman held the position of Constable General but ruled in name only. The real power in Kzelter lay with Teldorn Darkhope and his Banites in nearby Mintar. Aramman followed any orders from Teldorn dutifully.
