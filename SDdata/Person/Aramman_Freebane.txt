'''Aramman Freebane''' was the ruler of [[Kzelter]] in the [[Lake of Steam]] region during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Aramman held the position of Constable General but ruled in name only. The real power in Kzelter lay with [[Teldorn Darkhope]] and his [[Banite]]s in nearby [[Mintar]]. Aramman followed any orders from Teldorn dutifully.
