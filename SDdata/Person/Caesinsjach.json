        "History": "According to [[kobold]] legend, Caesinsjach was one of the first [[dragon]]s created by [[Asgorath]]. When Asgorath taught his children the secret to create life, the first dragon to put that ritual into practice was Caesinsjach. According to some legends, her first creation was [[Kurtulmak]]. When Kurtulmak built a majestic lair for her, she released him from duty.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants]]'', Caesinsjach ruled the draconic kingdom of [[Darastriverthicha]]. During the first [[Rage of Dragons]], around {{Yearlink|-24000}}, Caesinsjach and her fellow dragons went mad and destroyed Darastriverthicha and all its vassal states, including the kobold nation of [[Darastrixhurthi]].",
