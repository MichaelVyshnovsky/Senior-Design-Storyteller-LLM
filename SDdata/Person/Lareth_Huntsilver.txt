Lareth Huntsilver was a member of the noble house of Huntsilver in Cormyr around the turn of the 11 century DR.
Lareth was a handsome, thin man with pale blond hair and a thin mustache.
Lareth had a dry wit and was known for making sardonic observations. He was quite the ladies man, often wooing several different women rather than concentrating on one at a time. However, he eventually settled down and married a commoner.
He was good friends with Halartan Wyvernspur and reveled in imparting droll comments timed to elicit a snort or sputter that sent his drink out his nose.
Lareth was one of the four men that discovered the so-called Harp of Healing in the . He, along with Gardrath Roaringhorn, Aubleth Crownsilver, and Aiken Wyvernspur, were walking home to Suzail after a night of merrymaking when they chanced upon a roadside clearing and a softly glowing, floating harp that was playing music. Various commoners were coming out of the forest to touch the harp and apparently being healed of their sicknesses or wounds before disappearing back into the trees.
Lareth eventually married Roatha Ildraen, the daughter of an innkeeper. He became the Seneschal of Turnstone,
