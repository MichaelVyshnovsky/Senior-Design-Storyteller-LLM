'''Lareth Huntsilver''' was a member of the noble house of [[Huntsilver]] in [[Cormyr]] around the turn of the 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Lareth was a handsome, thin man with pale blond hair and a thin mustache.

==Personality==
Lareth had a dry wit and was known for making sardonic observations. He was quite the ladies' man, often wooing several different women rather than concentrating on one at a time. However, he eventually settled down and married a commoner.

==Relationships==
He was good friends with [[Halartan Wyvernspur]] and reveled in imparting droll comments timed to elicit a snort or sputter that sent his drink out his nose.

==History==
Lareth was one of the four men that discovered the so-called ''[[Harp of Healing]]'' in the {{YearlinkName|1018}}. He, along with [[Gardrath Roaringhorn]], [[Aubleth Crownsilver]], and [[Aiken Wyvernspur]], were walking home to Suzail after a night of merrymaking when they chanced upon a roadside clearing and a softly glowing, floating [[harp]] that was playing music. Various commoners were coming out of the forest to touch the harp and apparently being healed of their sicknesses or wounds before disappearing back into the trees.{{Cite dragon/280/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 3|86}}

Lareth eventually married [[Roatha Ildraen]], the daughter of an innkeeper. He became the Seneschal of [[Turnstone]],{{Cite dragon/280/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 3|87}}
