        "mainbody": "In [[366 DR]], Shoon would have his final battle with \"Sharpfangs\". This battle occurred in the skies above Shoonach, over the slaves' city adjacent to the city center. 75,000 persons were slaughtered as a result of the careless use of magic from both parties. During the battle, Shoon's right leg was crippled, and his left arm was shattered and nearly bitten clear off. Only his powerful contingency magics saved him. (From that day on, he forever walked with a limp.) He had managed to shred Iryklathagra's wings, and his soldiers and wizards were then able to drive her off. Shoon shouted in victory even as his capital city smoldered.\n\n===Undeath===\nAfter his final fight with Iryklathagra, Shoon VII decided to set his plan into action to achieve lichdom. He placed his daughter Shaani on the throne as regent while he recovered from his injuries and avoided being assassinated by a few advisors or family members. He had his own tomb constructed in Debukkher in Shoonach, which had a secret passage to his hidden lair.\n\nShoon used illusions to make it appear that his injuries would not heal. Then, he successfully faked his own death&mdash;or rather his murder&mdash;in [[367 DR]]. He tricked his greedy daughter Shaani into poisoning his soup and taking the throne for herself. She had no idea that he was immune to poisons. He used magic to create a clone of his dead body, which was embalmed and entombed.\n\nFree from the responsibilities of ruling his empire directly, Shoon spent the next several years researching [[lich]]dom, while he continued to pull strings behind the scenes. He was successful in becoming a lich in [[370 DR]].\n\nDuring this time, Shoon carefully moved many of the magic items he had created during his life from the imperial treasuries and into hiding in his own lairs. Since his archnemesis Iryklathagra had stolen his most powerful staff, he kept his remaining artifact, the ''Tome of the Unicorn'' close by his side.\n\nExcept for the elves, the rest of civilization was unaware that Shoon VII existed for the next seven centuries, and all that the elves knew was that he had hidden away somewhere within the ruins of [[Deep Shanatar]], having reached those depths from tunnels in his dungeons below the Imperial Mount of Shoonach.\n\nSometime during that 700 years, Shoon's skeletal form decayed until only a demilich remained. No one knows whether it was intentional or accidental, but Shoon's floating skull became entrapped in an extradimensional space within the last page of the ''Tome of the Unicorn'', where Shoon remained until he was discovered another 300 years later by [[Shond Tharovin]] in the year [[1357 DR]].\n\nShond successfully figured out how to summon Shoon VII. Rather than destroy Shond, he made a proposal. He requested that Shond bring him the souls of seven innocent victims for him to consume. If Shond did this, Shoon would tell him the location of a powerful artifact known as the ''[[Living Gem]]'',\n\n===Zallanora Argentresses===\n[[File:Shoon VII and Zalla.png|thumb|left|''Shoon VII in [[demilich]] form and in the guise of the [[Elf|elven]] woman [[Zallanora Argentresses|Zallanora]].'']]\nIn [[1358 DR]], a young wood elf maiden from [[Mosstone]] of only 105 years was traveling with some companions from [[Erlkazar]] to [[Silverymoon]]. Her name was [[Zallanora Argentresses]]. She had recently graduated from the [[Mystics' Academy]] and was planning to next attend the [[Lady's College]].\n\nShe never arrived. She and her friends were ambushed in the [[Cloud Peaks]] and kidnapped by the wicked and insane Calishite wizard Shond Tharovin. Shond had recently discovered and stolen the evil ''Tome of the Unicorn'' from where it had been hidden away in [[Ruathym]] and released the demilich&mdash;Shoon VII&mdash;who had been trapped inside. Shoon VII drank the souls of Zallanora's friends. When it was her turn to be consumed, at the moment, the [[Time of Troubles]] began, and magic chaos that occurred when the gods fell to the earth somehow caused Zallanora and Shoon VII to switch bodies. From that moment on, Zallonora found herself in the form of a skull trapped within the ''Tome of the Unicorn'', and Shoon VII was once again free to reign unchecked in the world.\n\nShoon and Shond worked together to hide the evidence of the ambush of Zallanora's caravan, making it look like it was destroyed by the magical chaos of the god's fall. Then, Shoon kept his promise and revealed the location of the ''Living Gem'' to Shond.\n\nIt took Shoon twelve years to get used to controlling his new female body. After this time of waiting, he set to work returning to his evil plans. He began by joining the [[Cowled Wizard]]s of [[Amn]], becoming an apprentice to Lady [[Varytha Gheldieg]]. While in a woman's body, \"she\" used seduction to gain many male admirers and had several wizards who volunteered to mentor \"her\". On those few occasions where \"Zallanora\" accidentally revealed that \"she\" knew more about magic than a young apprentice should, Shoon methodically assassinated any observers and skillfully covered his tracks.\n\nShoon VII was patient. He knew that he had many hundreds of years to make his plans in his new elven body, and those plans fully included returning to rule the lands and empire that were once his to control.\n\nShoon VII was fully aware of the existence of the [[Twisted Rune]]. He had gained knowledge of their plans through [[Uruathis]] a [[lamia noble]] working for [[Kartak Spellseer]] deep under the ruins of Shoonach. His plans included offering the Twisted Rune to join him as his servants or be destroyed.\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], Shoon had gained influence among the Cowled Wizards in Eshpurta, [[Esmeltaran]], and [[Keczulla]]. He intended to use the riches of his \"mentor\", Lady Varytha, to fund a mercenary army and use the Cowled Wizards as magic support to restore the Shoon Empire. He was still active and in Zallanora's body by the year [[1374 DR]], and he was actively trying to figure out a way to destroy his greatest rivals, Iryklathagra and the liches of the Twisted Rune.\n\nToward the dragon, he planned to send waves of dragonslayers against her until he could fully grasp her defenses and find a weakness in them. His method for this was to leave such things as maps and descriptions of her hoard in various dungeons and crypts in the south, so that unsuspecting adventurers would find them and greedily seek after her treasure.\n\nAfter the [[Rage of Dragons]] in 1373 DR, Shoon VII sent an agent disguised as a [[cleric|priest]] of [[Talos|Bhaelros]] to Calimport to speak with the [[Syl-Pasha]] [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]], who attempted to convince the caleph to offer a bounty of the position of [[Alzhedo dictionary#S|Syl]]-[[Alzhedo dictionary#V|Vizar]] of Calimport to whoever could slay the dragon.",
        "Description": "The man known as Shoon VII had taken many physical forms over his long life, beginning with that of his natural, [[Calishite]] male body.\n\nIn his [[demilich]] form, Shoon appeared as a mostly intact floating skull with gem teeth.\n\nIn his most recent form, (the strange circumstances of which are explained below,) Shoon VII appeared as a short, young [[Wood elf|wood elven]] maiden with bobbed, curly silver hair. In this feminine form, he had hazel eyes, which darkened to mahogany when he became angry.",
        "Personality": "Shoon VII was an exceptionally cruel man, yet he had such great charisma that he could inspire deep loyalty from his underlings and the people of his realm. His speeches were said to have been \"awe-inspiring\".\n\nWhile a demilich, Shoon would not bother speaking with anyone who did not refer to him as \"Emperor\". He was cold-blooded and cynical and would only speak in a calm, deadpan tone, even if in the midst of combat.\n\nIn his guise as an [[Elf|elven]] woman, Shoon had a dry sense of humor and a strange knack for knowledge of ancient history.",
        "Abilities": "Shoon VII was exceptionally talented at magical combat, and had a special talent for anticipating which spell his opponents would choose to cast.\n\nShoon had made himself immune to [[poison]]s.\n\nIn his lifetime, Shoon VII had developed several powerful spells, including ''[[soulfire]]'', which converted the lives of its victims into arcane fire, ''[[Kodos' eruptive strike]]'', which launched molten rock into the air, and ''[[Shoon's villein volley]]'', which converted up to 20 living persons into a powerful ''[[magic missile]]''. More than 500 slaves and peasants lost their lives to his repeated use of this latter spell.\n\nIn his demilich form, Shoon was able to drain the souls of victims. He could also steal spells from the minds of any who had touched the ''[[Tome of the Unicorn]]''. He could either cast the stolen spells or use their raw power to heal himself. However, as a demilich, Shoon was incapable of memorizing or casting any of the spells he had known in life; he could only cast a stolen spell.\n\nIn his new elven form, Shoon could still use all of his full magical powers; plus he gained the innate abilities of being in an elven body, such as superior night vision and hearing.",
        "Possessions": "Shoon VII crafted a good number of magical items and [[artifact]]s with his evil magics, perhaps most notably the ''Tome of the Unicorn'' and the ''[[Staff of Shoon]]'', the latter of which was carved from [[unicorn]] horns. The ''Tome's'' last known location was in a safehold beneath the [[Imperial Mount]] in [[Shoonach]]. The ''Staff'' was in the treasure horde of a [[blue dragon]].\n\nShoon VII acquired the ''[[Codex Thealnakkar]]'', a tome describing the creation of ''[[Calishite mosaics]]'' from a wizard of [[Memnon]] named [[Thealnak]]. Shoon used ''mosaics of [[teleport]]ation'' to link some of his many safeholds.\n\nShoon inherited the artifact known as ''[[Janyra's Tome]]'' from previous emperors of the Imperium, and he used it with one of ''[[Janyra's Rings]]'' to interrogate spies or to steal secrets from enemies.\n\nShoon VII also possessed two of the [[Qysari Rings]], ''[[Qysarus Secretus]]'', which protected him from scrying, and ''[[Unicorn's Bane]]'', which he used to hunt down and slay [[unicorn]]s.\n\nIn his latest female form, Shoon VII wore an ''[[amulet of proof against detection and location]]'', an ''[[elven cloak]]'' and ''[[elven boots]]'', and a ''[[ring of mind shielding]]''. He wore this last magic item to ensure that his secret identity was not detected.",
        "Holdings": "Shoon VII had magically protected lairs in every mountain range and forest in the [[Lands of Intrigue]]. One of his major safeholds was the one below the old Imperial Mount, below the tomb city of [[Debukkher]]. He also \"laired\" in the apprentice quarters of Zallanora within the Gheldieg estate in [[Eshpurta]].",
        "Relationships": "Shoon VII was the son of the [[Caleph Arcane]] of [[Almraiven]], [[Nadim el Jhotos]], and [[Selara el Shoon|Selara]], the second daughter of Empress [[Shoon V]]. He was one of twelve children. He and eight of his siblings were exceptionally talented in the art of magic.\n\nShoon had at least one daughter, [[Shaani]]. He was the nephew of [[Shoon VI]], whom he would murder.\n\nShoon's archnemesis was the blue dragon [[Iryklathagra]], and the two fought three epic battles over the period of Shoon VII's reign.",
        "History": {
            "Rise to Power": "'''Kodos yn Nadim el Jhotos''' was born in the [[290 DR|Year of Full Cribs, 290 DR]]. he was trained by the famous guild arcane of Almraiven, the oldest guild arcane in [[Calimshan]]. He was so skilled at spell battles that he had already slain at least twelve archmages before he even became emperor.\n\nIn his nineteenth year, he and his father orchestrated the bloody assassination of Emperor Shoon VI by paying off the royal guard to slay him with no fewer than 35 stab wounds. No sooner had they assassinated their master than Shoon VI's nephew Kodos \"took revenge\" for his uncle and killed them all. With Shoon VI dead, Kodos was the next male kin and took the throne of the Shoon Imperium, becoming Shoon VII in the [[309 DR|Year of the Cascade, 309 DR]].\n\nAs emperor, Shoon VII made sure that he had full control of the subtlest details of his empire. He immediately demanded a vow of loyalty (enforced magically) from each of the calephs arcane. Some refused and were killed; others accepted and were rewarded with riches. The caleph arcane of Memnon was one who refused, as did the mages under him, so Shoon VII killed them all and proceeded to rule the guild arcane of Memnon himself.",
            "Atrocities": "When crime increased in his empire, Shoon VII's solution was to order that oil be poured into the sewers of each Shoon city and lit to drive out the thieves' guilds living in hiding there. Shoon did not care that these conflagrations resulted in the deaths of over three million people. [[Ankhapur]], [[Calimport]], [[Innarlith]], [[Ithmong]], and Memnon were nearly destroyed from these [[Great Fires]] In Shoon's view, the end had justified the means, as organized crime was essentially eliminated. Instead, the emperor and his advisors took over control of \"illegal\" activities themselves.\n\nIn [[326 DR]], in [[Tashalar]], one of the vassal states of the Empire, a [[wizard]] named [[Onsilur Maerdrathom]] convinced the imperial satraps to enforce legal protections for all mages in the region. This led to a temporary peace in the region. As long as the cities of the Tashtan Coast were squabbling amongst themselves, they could not pose a threat to his throne, so Shoon demanded that the imperial satraps, his vassals, remove Onsilur from power. They obeyed, and hired mercenary mages from [[Mulhorand]] to eliminate him.\n\nShoon was responsible for the deaths of at least two dozen unicorns, which were sacrificed to create his most powerful magical artifacts. He even sanctioned hunts against them. when the [[Elf|elves]] of the [[Snakewood]] tried to defend a small herd of seven unicorns from being captured and slain, Shoon VII ordered his legions to eradicate the elves. So many elves were killed that the headwaters of [[River Rimril]] turned red from blood. Two-thirds of the elves from two tribes of the forest were captured. Half of these were enslaved; on the other half, Shoon VII performed horrifying magical experiments.\n{{fq\n| float  = left\n| text   = &hellip;waste matter and flesh frail in its morality&hellip;\n| source = Shoon VII, describing the use of the horns of twelve [[unicorns]] to create the ''[[Staff of Shoon]]''\n}}\nFrom the slaughtered elves and unicorns, Shoon VII was able to craft the magical artifact known as the ''Tome of the Unicorn''. Shoon completed his enchantments on the ''Tome'' in [[355 DR]] by soaking the metal book plates in the blood of twelve unicorns. Not wanting to waste the remains of the unicorns he had massacred, he used their horns to carve the ''Staff of Shoon''. \n\nIn [[361 DR]], Shoon VII discovered the hidden lair of [[Hazamir al Aktorral]], a former regent of the Empire who had successfully become a lich. Shoon VII battled with Hazamir and turned him into a [[grisgol]].{{Cite dungeon/131/Prison Mail|12}}\n\nIn that same year,{{Valashar dates}} Shoon VII made secret plans to expand his territory, using the ambitious prince [[Ashar Tornamn]] of [[Tethyr]] as a pawn. Wanting to impress his ''qysar'', the young [[Alzhedo dictionary#N|''nazir'']] built up an army and marched in a fifteen-month campaign, setting himself up as king of [[Valashar (kingdom)|Valashar]]. Ultimately, in [[376 DR]], Crown Prince [[Azoun I]] of [[Cormyr]] squelched Ashar's dreams and marched an army through Valashar and all the way to Ithmong before returning to Cormyr to deal with [[orc]] hordes. Despite the loss of territory, Shoon VII believed that he had tricked Cormyr into a trap, hoping to strike at that country after having it weaken itself on its long march, and was disappointed that random chance had ruined his plans.",
            "Conflicts with Iryklathagra": "[[File:Shoon vs Sharpfangs.png|thumb|right|280px|''A depiction of the Emperor Shoon VII in a mage battle against the [[blue dragon]] [[Iryklathagra]].'']]\nShoon VII's conflict with the blue dragon Iryklathagra started in [[322 DR]] when she landed in the [[Qysar's Square]] and demanded to speak with the emperor. She wanted reparations for the \"theft of her hoard\" by Shoon's great-great-great-grandfather [[Shoon IV]]. After several days of negotiations, Shoon VII paid her a small fraction of her claims, promising to arrange the rest of the payment at a later time. He said that he would personally deliver the hoard to her. Instead, he attacked her, and the two fought for the first time somewhere in the region of Valashar in northeastern Tethyr. Four entire villages were destroyed by their volley of magic, and Shoon VII emerged the victor, driving the dragon away after having stolen multiple magic items from her grasp.\n\nIn [[358 DR]], Shoon VII fought with Iryklathagra a second time Some believe that Shoon chose the spot to keep the battle away from Shoonach. The battle ended in a sort of stalemate, as Iryklathagra fled from the fight with Shoon's magic staff. Even more Tethyrian lands were demolished, and dozens of peasants and soldiers were sacrificed to power Shoon's ''soulfire'' spell.\n{{fq\n| float  = left\n| text   = &hellip;[[Iryklathagra]] shall rue the day she challenged the almighty Shoon, for I shall personally dine upon her flesh and gnaw upon her bones.&hellip; I shall fashion her hide into a mantle befitting of the qysar.
