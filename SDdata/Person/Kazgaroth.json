        "mainbody": "'''Kazgaroth''', also spelled '''Kazgoroth''', was an aspect of Bhaal who was a powerful, intelligent, evil beast opposed to the balance and the influence of the [[Earthmother]] on the [[Moonshae Isles]]. It would periodically ravage the land until it was defeated, only to return several years later, in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Kazgaroth's natural form was that of a massive \"''[[tyrannosaurus]]''\", but it could shape-change to other forms, including those of people whom it killed and devoured before impersonating.",
        "History": "Kazgoroth was born from the [[Darkwell]], a [[moonwell]] corrupted by [[Bhaal]], in the {{YearlinkName|1345}}.{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} It drew power from that moonwell, which was also a place where Bhaal's avatar entered the Realms.\n\nAfterward, Kazgaroth took several guises. The first few were a [[cow]], which attracted a bit too much attention, and a woman named [[Meridith]], who drew too much attention because Kazgaroth used its powers to make her body more attractive. The Beast's first victim was a man named [[Erian]] who was a guard for the prince [[Tristan Kendrick]] of the [[Moonshaes]], whom Kazgoroth transformed into a [[werewolf]] to subvert one of the [[Earthmother]]'s defenses, [[the Pack]]. Afterwards, he changed into a [[dryad]] in order to lure the [[druid]] [[Trahern]] of [[Oakvale]]. His next victim was [[Thelgaar Ironhand]], king of [[Oman's Isle]], of whom he took the identity so he could command the army of [[Northmen]] in their attack on the southern Moonshae Isles, mainly the city of [[Caer Corwell]]. Kazgoroth was finally forced to retreat back to the [[Darkwell]], where it was slain by Prince [[Tristan Kendrick]] and his companions, though its heart was recovered by Trahern.<ref>"
