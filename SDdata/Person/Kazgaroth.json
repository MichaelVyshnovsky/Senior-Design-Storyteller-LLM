        "mainbody": "azgaroth, also spelled Kazgoroth, was an aspect of Bhaal who was a powerful, intelligent, evil beast opposed to the balance and the influence of the Earthmother on the Moonshae Isles. It would periodically ravage the land until it was defeated, only to return several years later, in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nKazgaroths natural form was that of a massive \"tyrannosaurus\", but it could shape-change to other forms, including those of people whom it killed and devoured before impersonating.\nKazgoroth was born from the Darkwell, a moonwell corrupted by Bhaal, in the . It drew power from that moonwell, which was also a place where Bhaals avatar entered the Realms.\nAfterward, Kazgaroth took several guises. The first few were a cow, which attracted a bit too much attention, and a woman named Meridith, who drew too much attention because Kazgaroth used its powers to make her body more attractive. The Beasts first victim was a man named Erian who was a guard for the prince Tristan Kendrick of the Moonshaes, whom Kazgoroth transformed into a werewolf to subvert one of the Earthmothers defenses, the Pack. Afterwards, he changed into a dryad in order to lure the druid Trahern of Oakvale. His next victim was Thelgaar Ironhand, king of Omans Isle, of whom he took the identity so he could command the army of Northmen in their attack on the southern Moonshae Isles, mainly the city of Caer Corwell. Kazgoroth was finally forced to retreat back to the Darkwell, where it was slain by Prince Tristan Kendrick and his companions, though its heart was recovered by Trahern."
