'''Lili Huntinghawk''' was a scout for [[Company Yargo]] that served aboard the ''[[Buccaneer's Tear]]'' during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She was a pragmatist that could easily justify her actions depending on those taken by the people around her.

==Activities==
Lili was a collector of rare items, namely trophies taken from powerful beasts.

==History==
When the ''Buccaneer's Tear'' landed atop the [[Pirates' Skyhold]] [[earthmote]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Lili and her fellow scouts [[Thoros]] and [[Shaben Shortcloak]] were sent ahead across the [[Vilebog]] wetlands to observe the local [[lizardfolk]] population. While Thoros sought to outright kill the resident lizardfolk, Lili "merely" sought to ransack their homes and recover any valuables within.

When Shaben appeared to go missing near the sunken villages that surrounded the menacing [[Skull Fortress]], Lili and Thoros both sought to aid to seek out more information.
