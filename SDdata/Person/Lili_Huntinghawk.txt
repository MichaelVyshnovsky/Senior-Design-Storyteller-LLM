Lili Huntinghawk was a scout for Company Yargo that served aboard the Buccaneers Tear during the late 15 century DR.
She was a pragmatist that could easily justify her actions depending on those taken by the people around her.
Lili was a collector of rare items, namely trophies taken from powerful beasts.
When the Buccaneers Tear landed atop the Pirates Skyhold earthmote in the , Lili and her fellow scouts Thoros and Shaben Shortcloak were sent ahead across the Vilebog wetlands to observe the local lizardfolk population. While Thoros sought to outright kill the resident lizardfolk, Lili "merely" sought to ransack their homes and recover any valuables within.
When Shaben appeared to go missing near the sunken villages that surrounded the menacing Skull Fortress, Lili and Thoros both sought to aid to seek out more information.
