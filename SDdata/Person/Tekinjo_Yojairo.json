        "mainbody": "'''Tekinjo Yojairo''' was the military governor the empire of [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR|Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR)]].",
        "Description": "Yojairo was a highly skilled [[samurai]]. As military governor of [[Wa]], Yojairo's responsibility was to serve as the liaison between the emperor in [[Rukimbaru]]&mdash;where Yojairo also lived at the palace&mdash;and the [[shogun]] in [[Uwaji]].\n\nYojairo was a rather handsome man.",
        "Personality": "Yojairo was a man of good heart and a very efficient administrator. Even though he was part of a family that essentially guaranteed him an official position, he could easily have earned the role by the merits of his shrewd skill in management.\n\nHis service had shown him the true miseries of Wa's poor people and the hypocrisies of the [[shogun]]ate, and he began to grow discontent with his rule in the government of Wa. He kept these feelings secret from everyone.",
        "Relationships": "Yojairo was the oldest son of [[Daimyo]] [[Tekinjo Gasahan]] of [[Kurahito]], one of the [[Three House daimyos]].\n\nWhen Yojairo learned that shogun [[Matasuuri Nagahide]]'s granddaughter [[Kisha Yunoko]] was sent to be the emperor's concubine as a means of spying on him, he was disgusted. Knowing that she was forced to act as a pawn, he felt great compassion for her, which soon grew into love, and they began a secret affair.",
        "History": "Around [[1347 DR|Wa Year 1765 (1347 DR)]], Yojairo was appointed as military governor. Around [[1347 DR|1774 (1347 DR)]] was when he started his secret relationship with Yunoko."
