        "Description": "Eldryn was an old [[human]] Thayan man. He was bitter and paranoid. He was afraid of being back-stabbed by his many wanna-be successors. He was said to be more prepared for an attack and betrayal than a [[beholder]].",
        "Possessions": "The Zulkir of Abjuration layered his [[robe]]s with many woven defensive magics. Eldryn's specialization were automatically-triggered ''[[counterspell]]s'', many of which were unique [[spell]]s developed by the bitter old man, and their secret formulae were taken to the grave with Eldryn's death.",
        "History": "Eldryn Lammaraster took the position of the Zullkir of Abjuration sometime before the late {{YearlinkName|1300}}. His name was among several zulkir names that became widely known after being named and described in the [[book]] called ''[[Twelve Winters Under the Lash]]'', penned by an anonymous slave and smuggled out of Thay sometime in late 1300 DR."
