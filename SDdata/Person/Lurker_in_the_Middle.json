        "mainbody": "The '''Lurker in the Middle''' was a [[demon]] bound by the ancient [[Nar]]. It guarded one of the main underground passages towards the city of [[Dun-Tharos]], and it was powerful enough to give even the [[Rotting Man]]'s right hand pause while exploring the subterranean ruins.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|171|17}}",
        "Appearance": "From a distance, the Lurker itself was visible only as a pulsing, ravenous glow.",
        "Activities": "The Lurker in the Middle lurked in the middle of a hallway. Though it appeared to be hungry, it did not attack people who did not approach it.",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|1373}}, the location and power of the Lurker were known to both the [[Rotting Man]]{{cite book/Lady of Poison|178|18}} The former took the monster into consideration when commanding the traitor [[Nentyar hunter]] [[Fallon]] to make his path to [[Dun-Tharos]] through the underground so as to lose his pursuers; the Talontyr sent the [[blightlord]] [[Damanda]] to meet him, to ensure he did not run into the Lurker.\n\nFallon spotted the Lurker while on the way to meet her, choosing to take a detour so as to not approach it. His decision seemed to briefly upset the fiend. Upon her arrival, Damanda suspected that the elf, Fallon, could have been eaten by the Lurker in the Middle; however, by its glow, she judged it had not eaten recently.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|215-216|22}}"
