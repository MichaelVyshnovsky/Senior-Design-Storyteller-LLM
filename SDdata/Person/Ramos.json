        "mainbody": "'''Ramos''' was the [[paramount]] of the [[storm giant aerie of Lake Woe mountain]] in [[1366 DR]].{{Giantcraft date}}",
        "Description": "Ramos had pale violet skin and blue-black hair that was very long and unkempt. He was clean-shaven. Ramos typically wore a simple tunic with a large amount of silver jewelry. His eyes were silver-colored.",
        "Possessions": "Ramos bore a sword in battle that was twenty-feet long. It was notched and rusted.",
        "History": "In [[1364 DR]], a festival was held in honor of Ramos, who at that time was of second rank in the [[Ordning (social structure)|''ordning'']]. During the feast, the sun shone on the aerie for the first time in ten years, and this was seen as a omen that Ramos was to replace the current paramount as the new leader.\n\nBy [[1369 DR]], Ramos was no longer paramount, having been replaced by a giant named [[Anastes]]. Anastes, Ramos, and four others were summoned magically by [[Lanaxis]] to defend him when he needed to rest during his kidnapping of Queen [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] and her son [[Kaedlaw Burdun|Kaedlaw]]. They heeded his call. Ramos and a giant named Nikol cooked a moose for Brianna to eat, but during this time, [[Tavis Burdun]] and armies of [[giant-kin]] attacked. Nikol and Ramos were ordered by Anastes to deal with the [[verbeeg]]s. Ramos' fate in the ensuing battle was never recorded."
