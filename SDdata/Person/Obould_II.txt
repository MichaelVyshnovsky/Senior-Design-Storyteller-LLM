'''Obould II''', also known as '''Urlgen''', was an [[orc]] and the ruler of the [[Kingdom of Many-Arrows]] north of the [[Silver Marches]] as of [[1409 DR]]. He succeeded his father, [[Obould Many-Arrows]], and maintained his vision as well as his truce with the [[dwarves]] of [[Mithral Hall]].<ref group="note">It is unknown what link this Urlgen has with Obould's other son, [[Urlgen Threefist]], who died in 1370 DR. He may have been resurrected or this Urlgen was named for his deceased brother.

==History==
At the time of Obould I's death, Obould II was his eldest son. Obould II's ascension to the throne&mdash;and more importantly, his subsequent successes in putting down rebellions&mdash;established the legitimacy and viability of an [[Obould dynasty]] in the Kingdom of Many-Arrows.{{Cite dragon/429/Winning Races: Half-Orcs of the Many-Arrows Tribe|11}}
