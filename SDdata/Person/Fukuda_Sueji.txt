'''Fukuda Sueji''' was a [[samurai]] retainer of the [[Hori clan]] and also a [[jito]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
He controlled affairs in the once properous village of [[Chitu]].

==Personality==
His governance was marked by self-indulgence and a disinterest in the welfare of his subjects. Unmoved by the plight of the villagers, his focus remained on personal gains and the comforts of his station.
