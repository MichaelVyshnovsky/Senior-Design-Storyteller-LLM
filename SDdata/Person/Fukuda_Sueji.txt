Fukuda Sueji was a samurai retainer of the Hori clan and also a jito in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
He controlled affairs in the once properous village of Chitu.
His governance was marked by self-indulgence and a disinterest in the welfare of his subjects. Unmoved by the plight of the villagers, his focus remained on personal gains and the comforts of his station.
