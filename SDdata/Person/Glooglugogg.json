He took care of Blibdoolpoolps temple.\nGlooglugogg, Ploopploopeen, some guards, and the adventurers went to Leemooggoogoons temple in the guise of offering sacrifices. Bloppblippodd was pleased of her supposed victory over her father, and, after first sacrificing the duergar Hemeth, she intended to sacrifice the adventurers, but at that time the adventurers, Ploopploopeen, Glooglugogg, and his warriors attacked her and her lieutenants, all part of his plan to infiltrate the temple disguised to cut off the head of her cult. At this point, however, \"Leemooggoogoon\", along with dozens of ixitxachitl, rose from Darklake and started to destroy Sloobludop, killing all present."
