        "mainbody": "'''Ulnder Huntcrown''' was a knight and a member of the [[Huntcrown]] noble family in [[Cormyr]] who rode with Princess [[Alusair Obarskyr]]. She considered him a \"young hotspur\".",
        "History": "In the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], Alusair and her knights were operating in the Stonelands, pursuing a bold [[orc]] band that had raided a caravan east of [[Eveningstar]]; in six days of pursuit, they'd killed a [[hydra]], a \"[[fire lizard]]\", and three [[chimera]]s. They were on a high meadow north of [[Startop Crag]] when the knights impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush, and a few were killed. Alusair rallied her forces to defeat the orcs and their [[dark naga]] master. Ulnder cheered and thought the task done, until Alusair reminded him they had work to do yet, and he complained victories were never as simply done as in stories."
