        "mainbody": "lnder Huntcrown was a knight and a member of the Huntcrown noble family in Cormyr who rode with Princess Alusair Obarskyr. She considered him a \"young hotspur\".\nIn the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, Alusair and her knights were operating in the Stonelands, pursuing a bold orc band that had raided a caravan east of Eveningstar in six days of pursuit, theyd killed a hydra, a \"fire lizard\", and three chimeras. They were on a high meadow north of Startop Crag when the knights impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush, and a few were killed. Alusair rallied her forces to defeat the orcs and their dark naga master. Ulnder cheered and thought the task done, until Alusair reminded him they had work to do yet, and he complained victories were never as simply done as in stories."
