'''Mapathious''' was an [[angel of exploration]].{{cite book/City of Torment|88-89|8}}

==Description==
The creature trailed off into smoke at the midsection, but its upper body wore golden armor. Its skin was porcelain-white, with icy blue eyes, and wings of what appeared to be magma, which dripped molten rock.

==Personality==
Mapathious was not keen on protecting others, preferring strongly to travel alone; the irritation it caused the angel to protect them led it to consider briefly courses of action that were decidedly not angelical. Other than that, it was very curious, and driven to find and discover new locations.{{cite book/City of Torment|123-125|12}}

==Abilities==
Mapathious bore a flaming sword that could create portals by slashing across the fabric of reality. It also displayed strength even beyond its frame's apparent power when pursuing tasks of exploration, allowing it to carry even a ''[[trek bell]]''.

==Activities==
Mapathious was used to riding into unknown territory, then reporting the situation to a superior. Amongst other tasks, it recalled it was capable of determining whether foes were massed in ambush, [[demon lord]]s were riding forth, or [[adamantine]] fortresses had been created, and by who.

==Relationships==
Mapathious obeyed [[Neifion]] as part of a pact between its own masters and the archfey. Neifion could not alter this pact.

==History==
In {{Yearlink|1396}} Mapathious was summoned by [[Neifion]], calling on a pact of his own, and by Mapathious' true name (Mapathious). He bound the angel of exploration to lower a ''trek bell'' into Xxiphu, beneath the surface of [[Toril]]. Though the angel was none too happy about this arrangement at first, it was bound; its curiosity was quietly roused after describing the location.

After arriving at [[Xxiphu]], Mapathious quickly determined that the [[aboleth]] city was actually a fragment of the [[Citadel of the Outer Void]] and that it was sprouting. Before it could return to the higher planes in order to report this, it was attacked by [[Gethshemeth]].{{cite book/City of Torment|164-167|15}} The [[kraken]] soon slew him.

==Rumors & Legends==
Mapathious often wondered about a place known as the [[Citadel of the Outer Void]].
