Nofalis was a priest of Talos in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was the High Priest at the Temple of Talos in the Thayan city of Bezantur.
He delighted in the power he wielded as the highest ranking member of the church of Talos in the city. He never grew bored of preaching about how Talos would someday defeat the other gods and bring about doom and destruction.
