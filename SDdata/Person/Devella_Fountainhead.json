She was meticulous and determined in her job. As a paladin, she wore a set of Flaming Fist uniform plate armor and handled a two-handed sword.\nIn the , Devella Fountainhead turned down a generous donation from Lady Jannath, whose consort went missing, unbeknown to all, enslaved by the Zhentarim. Firelia Jannath requested a \"Sword Coast wide\" search for the painter, but Devellas men were in short supply she did, however, promise the patriar to keep an eye open for any signs of her missing lover. Devella later was tasked with assisting the Sleuth of Helm, Valeria, with the investigation of grizzly murders that plagued Baldurs Gate, beginning with the murder of Duke Belynne Stelmane. Sarevok Anchev of Bhaal was a person of interest in her investigation and was reported in a report to Blaze Liara Portyr, requisition the formation of Bhaal Murder Response Force. Despite the gnomes investigation and theories, her opinion was dismissed by investigator Valeria. One additional clue to the true nature of the murders came from Vicar Humbletoes of the Stormshore Tabernacle, where a bloodied offering was left for the God of Murder with the words \"Murder Shall be Holy Again\" inscribed on the victim. Devellas eventually faced the Bhaalist murderer Dolor as the dwarf was attempted to end the life of Figaro Pennygood, a clothier from the Lower City. Devella may not have survived that meeting or emerged alive with some help from a group of adventurers who sought to end the threat of the Absolute."
