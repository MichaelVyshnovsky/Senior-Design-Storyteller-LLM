Falataer was a powerful bard, musician, and instrument maker from the Moonshae Isles, famed for creating the original Instruments of the Bards of Toril.
Long before the 14 century DR, Falataer was known as a wise teacher and a bard of impressive powers. He ran a bardic college on the Moonshae Isles and tested his students with the Instruments of the Bards, later gifting them to his best students. Over the centuries, Falataers designs were copied, and the instrument retained the great bards name as a sign of respect.
By the , it was believed that there were only about twenty Falataeric Cli lyres left in existence, at least those exquisite lyres that were hand-crafted by the great bard in his workshop back on the Moonshae Isles. One of these instruments was sold at the Chromatic Scale, a musical instrument shop in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate.
