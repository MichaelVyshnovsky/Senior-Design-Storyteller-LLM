He wore his facial hair trimmed into bushy muttonchops.\nIn the , as the Absolute crisis ravaged the Gate, Nets Blandorfs fishing business was damaged further by pollution of the Gray Harbor. Fishers in the Lower City continued pulling nets filled with fish covered in black oily goo. Nets Blandorf could not understand how fish could be dirty as it came from water. He assumed that his nets were dirty and needed a good scrub so they wont dirty the catch. In reality, the fish was smothered in oil pollution left behind by a submersible used by the Cult of Bane to transport Lord Gortashs prisoners into the drowned Iron Throne headquarters prison at the bottom of Gray Harbor."
