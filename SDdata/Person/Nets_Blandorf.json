        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Absolute crisis]] ravaged the Gate, Nets Blandorf's fishing business was damaged further by pollution of the [[Gray Harbor]]. Fishers in the Lower City continued pulling [[net]]s filled with fish covered in black [[oil]]y goo. Nets Blandorf could not understand how fish could be dirty as it came from water. He assumed that his nets were dirty and needed a good scrub so they won't dirty the catch. In reality, the fish was smothered in oil pollution left behind by a [[submersible]] used by the [[Cult of Bane]] to transport [[Lord Gortash]]'s prisoners into the drowned [[Iron Throne headquarters]] prison at the bottom of Gray Harbor."
