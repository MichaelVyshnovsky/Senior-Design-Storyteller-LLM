'''Beldossan the Short''' was a human of [[the Vast]] in [[north Faer没n]] in the 7th century [[DR]]. Beldossan was rumored to have [[dwarf|dwarven]] blood, thus the nickname.

In the early 7th century, Beldossan assisted the [[dwarf|dwarven]] priest [[Turbaern]] and the [[elf]] sorceress [[Aleratha Ilnatar]] in enchanting over a thousand weapons forged from [[orcslayer]] metal by Master Smith [[Fyrfar Smokebeard]] over several years at the order of [[Deep King]] [[Tuir Stonebeard]], in their mission to destroy the [[orc]] realm of [[Vastar]]. Among these was the [[short sword]] ''[[Sarghathuld]]'' in [[605 DR|the Year of the Many Serpents, 605 DR]].{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|90}}
