Beldossan the Short was a human of the Vast in north Faerûn in the 7th century DR. Beldossan was rumored to have dwarven blood, thus the nickname.
In the early 7th century, Beldossan assisted the dwarven priest Turbaern and the elf sorceress Aleratha Ilnatar in enchanting over a thousand weapons forged from orcslayer metal by Master Smith Fyrfar Smokebeard over several years at the order of Deep King Tuir Stonebeard, in their mission to destroy the orc realm of Vastar. Among these was the short sword Sarghathuld in the Year of the Many Serpents, 605 DR.
