        "mainbody": "'''Emi Towiki''' was a maiden butterfly in [[Ito-jo]] in [[1360 DR]].",
        "History": "Towiki was a kitchen worker at the [[Ito family]]'s castle. She fell in love with [[Ajimo Heikaru]], the first son of the family's warlord. However, distracted by his love, Heikaru was negligent in rallying the clan's army when needed in [[647 DR]]. So a curse transformed him into a [[wererat]] condemned to guard his lover's room for eternity, while she was turned into a butterfly.\n\nAt last, in 1360 DR, an adventuring party hired by [[Michimori Uemon]] to recover the [[Seven Swords]] fought and destroyed Heikaru. Afterward, Towiki met them, telling them information about the swords and later disappeared."
