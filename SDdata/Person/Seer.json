        "History": "SEER was a [[noble]].\n\nSEER had a history with the [[cloud giant]] warlord Baron Rajiram, and had encountered him with her companion Bitter-root. SEER had been sent with allies of the Lords' Alliance on a mission to [[Durlag's Tower]]. However, all the members of this mission but SEER and Bitter-root were killed by the [[nalfeshnee]] [[Schvalt]]. When Bitter-root was possessed by another nalfeshnee, [[Blelthnol]], she begged SEER to leave her in a grove of trees near Durlag's Tower.\n\nSEER had spent some time tracking a ''[[headband of intellect]]'' containing the soul of [[Narcellia Varam'myr]], which was difficult as the headband magically prevented its wearer from being scried on. In the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} when the [[Cult of the Dragon]] attempted to summon [[Tiamat]], the wearer of the headband destroyed a statue of [[Angharradh]] in [[Parnast]]. At this point, SEER lost the trail of the headband.{{Cite adventurers league/Parnast Under Siege|4}} \n\nIn order to draw the wearer of the headband out again, SEER manipulated [[Chandra Stol]] in Parnast to commission a new statue of Angharradh. She also helped an artisan in [[Anauroch]] to create one.{{Cite adventurers league/The Black Road|6-7}}\n\nIn a room of the [[Weary Giant]] in [[Stagwick]], SEER cared for [[Emilia Marblehead]] a [[dwarf]] member of the [[Frostbite Platoon]]. Emilia had recently survived an attack by [[ogre]]s at the [[Birthright Stones]] in the [[Ice Spires]]. SEER hired adventurers to rescue the Frostbite Platoon and deliver a stone tablet that the dwarves had discovered there to her.\n\nSEER, having heard of the location of the ruins of the tower that had once belonged to the [[Wizard of the Crag]], determined through scrying that a group of adventurers had discovered the ruins already. She sent Hsing to hire the adventurers to recover works from the library of the Wizard. SEER interpreted these magical works and created a ritual to magically scry on Bad Fruul, who wore the ''headband of intellect'' containing containing the soul of Narcellia that prevented him from being scried by normal means.\n\nAt the [[Red Sheaf]] in [[Beregost]], SEER met with adventurers. She tasked them with intercepting an impending attack on Durlag's Tower by Baron Rajiram. She also warned them of the dwarf mercenary twins [[Bahldrak Slagspit|Bahldrak]] and [[Bellegia Slagspit]]. She also asked the adventurers to rescue her old companion Bitter-root from the Tower, and gave them Bitter-root's [[holy symbol]] of Angharradh. After the briefing, she [[teleport]]ed the adventurers to the Tower.{{Cite adventurers league/Durlag's Tower|4-5}}\n\nSEER also organized for adventurers to meet with Hsing and disrupt a potential alliance between [[Bad Fruul]] and [[Gralm]] in the [[Lonely Moor]].{{Cite adventurers league/Giant Diplomacy|4}}\n\nWhen Jarl [[Ryndölg]] amassed a force of [[Ice Spire ogre]]s, SEER sought more information about his [[axe]] [[Øksavmakt]].{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|5}} She visited [[Kryshilir]], of the [[Seven Stones]]. She convinced him to help by giving directions to the location of [[Hotun-Shûl]]. About a tenday later, she sent adventurers to meet Kryshilir, travel to Hotun-Shûl, and research Øksavmakt.{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|8}}\n\nAt the end of summer, still operating from the Weary Giant in Stagwick, SEER worked alongside [[Uli]] to hire adventurers to again investigate Ryndölg, whom she correctly suspected of having found [[Hartkiller's Horn (artifact)|Hartkiller's Horn]].\n\nStill researching giants, SEER and Hsing investigated the ruins of the [[Ulcaster School of Wizardry]]. She discovered a document that detailed the location of a secret library of Ulcaster and how to perform the ritual titled [[Oghma's Gifts]]. The pair were then attacked by [[undead]]. SEER became charmed by the [[vampire]] [[Levanna]], and Hsing returned to [[Feldepost's Inn]] in [[Beregost]] and hired adventurers to rescue her. The adventurers rescued [[Ulcaster]] from his tomb, and fought against Levanna. In the fight, the charmed SEER fought against her rescuers to aid Levanna. Levanna escaped, breaking the effect on SEER, who entered an unconcious meditative state to heal.\n\nAs the adventurers left with SEER and Ulcaster, the ruins were attacked by a flying pirate ship belonging to Baron Rajiram. SEER deduced that the pirates had been sent to recover notes on runes that were stored in Ulcaster's secret library, stored inside a [[demiplane]]. She again hired adventurers, and sent the young wizard [[Tenos]] with them so that they could access the demiplane.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation|6-8}}\n\nContinuing to trail Bad Fruul, SEER realised that Narcellia's soul in his headband was convincing him to attack Parnast in order to kill Chandra Stol. She realised that this was because Chandra was related to [[Luistarra Stollereil]], the [[elf]] who'd imprisoned Narcellia in the headband. From her office, she hired adventurers from Parnast to save the town from Bad Fruul's attack, and to save Chandra. She also wanted the adventurers' help in convincing [[Raggnar Redtooth]] or [[Gundalin]] to let Parnast into the Lords' Alliance.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation|9}}\n\nLater, back in Hartsvale, she worked with [[Grauman Hartwick]]. The pair hired adventurers to travel to the Ice Spires and confront Jarl Ryndölg, who was hunting the [[Beast of Talos]] and had used Hartkiller's Horn to summon [[Hartkiller]].{{Cite adventurers league/Hartkiller's Horn|7}}\n\nLater, SEER was interrupted by a group of adventurers that suddenly arrived in her presence through a portal. The adventurers had been sent through time from a tenday into the future, when they had already been hired by a future version of SEER. The time portal had been created when the adventurers touched the temporally unstable [[Eye of Xxiphu (artifact)|Eye of Xxiphu]]. The portal remained open for twelve hours, which allowed SEER to again send adventurers through it, to a period of time a tenday into the future.{{Cite adventurers league/The Mysterious Isle|16}}\n\nAfter the tenday passed naturally for SEER, her body had begun to visibly age, due to the power of the Eye of Xxiphu,{{Cite adventurers league/The Mysterious Isle|6}} the strain of keeping the portal open, and a powerful pearl at the heart of the isle of the [[morkoth]] [[M'warien]]. This isle was being besieged by [[Dworkin]], a follower of her old foe Baron Rajiram. Dworkin wished to recover the Eye of Xxiphu. In order to stop this, SEER sent adventurers to the isle—the adventurers that would later travel through time and that she had already encountered. She equipped them with some of a variety of magical items, and sent them there on the backs of [[bronze dragon]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of Xxiphu|6}} After the epic encounter, SEER arrived at the isle, on a ship sent by the Lord's Alliance, hoping to recover the Eye of Xxiphu.{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of Xxiphu|15}}\n\nFollowing this, SEER hired a number of adventurers to travel to the [[Greypeak Mountains]] in a caravan and enter the lair of Baron [[Krelas Ulgarak]] and destroy his [[inferno bombard]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/The Iron Baron|5}} She also led adventurers into Durlag's Tower, and raised his ancient flying ship the ''[[Ark of the Mountains]]'' against Baron Rajiram's ''[[Thunderbound]]'' in an epic sky battle.{{Cite adventurers league/The Ark of the Mountains|9}}"
