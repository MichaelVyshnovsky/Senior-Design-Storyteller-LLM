'''Henna''' was a [[druid]] from the [[Neverwinter Wood]], active some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Much of Henna's life was unknown apart from the story behind the [[enchanted]] set of [[light armor]] called the ''[[Skin of the Forest]]''. Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Henna became lost in the depths of the Neverwinter Wood, pursued by a gang of hungry [[troll]]s. As the rain began its downpour, Henna found shelter by an old [[oak]] [[tree]]. Eventually, her pursuers got close. By some strange magic, Henna began feeling a strange warmth that gently enveloped her. The trolls lumbered past the druid, none the wiser. When she emerged from the shelter, she found herself wearing bark-like armor. Eventually, by 1372 DR, the miraculous light armor left Henna's possession.
