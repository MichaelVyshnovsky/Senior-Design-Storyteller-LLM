'''Kadugan''' was sailor from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''The cranes, I say. Do I have to think of everything myself?''|Kadugan}}

==Description==
Kadugan was a pale and green-tint skinned [[wood elf]] with sharp chiseled facial features, long brown hair, and blue eyes. He wore dockworker's commoner clothes while aboard his vessel.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Kadugan was a lowly sailor and laborer who worked alongside [[Listless]] under Bosun [[Sharley]], who worked her crew hard. Kadugan was tasked with unloading the boat but lamented the fact that Bosun did not land under one of the docks' unloading cranes, making unloading that much harder for Kadugan and Listless.
