Sharee was a server that worked at a tavern in the Sembian city of Saerloon during the midâ€“14 century DR.
She was described as being a "fine half-elf tavern wench".
Sharee had a regular suitor in the half-orc ship captain Fowler. Every time he made advancers, Sharee would knock him in the head with an ale tankard but he would always return and seek her out again.
