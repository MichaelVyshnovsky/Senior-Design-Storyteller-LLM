==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, as a child member of the [[Night Masks]], Gedrin had a vision in which the [[deity|god]] [[Helm]] was slain in a duel with [[Tyr]]. Helm's godhood flowed into Tyr, restoring his sight. When Gedrin awoke from his vision, he held Helm's sword, ''[[Vindicator]]''. Later, Gedrin dreamed that Tyr was killed by the [[demon]] lord [[Orcus]] and that Tyr's godhood flowed into [[Torm]].

After the visions, Gedrin founded the Eye of Justice and recruited his fellow members of the Night Masks to join his church. The Eye of Justice drove the Night Masks from [[Westgate]]. The church later became corrupted and Gedrin left Westgate and eventually traveled to [[Luskan]] on the [[Sword Coast]] by the 1460s DR. There, he met a young man named [[Kalen Dren]] begging on the streets and gave him ''Vindicator'', thus recruiting the boy into the Eye of Justice.

==Possessions==
Gedrin wielded Helm's own sword, ''Vindicator'', until he gave it to Kalen Dren.
