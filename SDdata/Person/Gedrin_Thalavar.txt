Gedrin Thalavar, sometimes called Shadowbane, was a paladin and the founder of the Eye of Justice, a sect that believed in the Heresy of the Threefold God.
In the , as a child member of the Night Masks, Gedrin had a vision in which the god Helm was slain in a duel with Tyr. Helms godhood flowed into Tyr, restoring his sight. When Gedrin awoke from his vision, he held Helms sword, Vindicator. Later, Gedrin dreamed that Tyr was killed by the demon lord Orcus and that Tyrs godhood flowed into Torm.
After the visions, Gedrin founded the Eye of Justice and recruited his fellow members of the Night Masks to join his church. The Eye of Justice drove the Night Masks from Westgate. The church later became corrupted and Gedrin left Westgate and eventually traveled to Luskan on the Sword Coast by the 1460s DR. There, he met a young man named Kalen Dren begging on the streets and gave him Vindicator, thus recruiting the boy into the Eye of Justice.
Gedrin wielded Helms own sword, Vindicator, until he gave it to Kalen Dren.
