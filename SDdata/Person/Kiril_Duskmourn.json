        "mainbody": "iril Duskmourn was a star elf warrior and a Keeper of the Cerulean Sign. She was involved in the sealing of Pandorym in , the unmasking of Telarian in , and left for Abeir after the Spellplague.\nThe star elf was known for her foul mouth, purposeful baiting of others, and derision.\nShe carried an endless shame from her time in Stardeep, and was uncomfortable with people.\nKiril was the wielder of the sword Angul. She also carried a magical bronze flask of endless whiskey and wore elven chainmail. She also was gifted the sword Sadrul.\nKiril was a warden of Stardeep for five years, up until a decade before 1375 DR, together with her childhood beloved and fiancee, Nangulis. When The Traitor breached containment, the two of them, together with Cynosure employed ancient lore from the Keepers of the Cerulean Sign to fashion a magical sword, Angul, from the soul of Nangulis. So armed, Kiril managed to contain the Traitor again. However, the intense ego of the weapon was nearly impossible for her to bear she came to slay several young wood elves for being too curious about the monoliths in the entrance of Stardeep. It made her go insane.\nShe fled to for the lonely mesas southeast, trapping dune rats, drinking excessively, and occassionally finding bodyguard work. After working for a man who looked like he was ninety years of age, she became the regular bodyguard of the dwarf geomancer Thormud Horn. While with him, she christened the mesa that the dwarf inhabited the Finger Defiant, and visited at least one volcano,\nWhile under Thormuds service, Kiril helped investigate a disturbance, which led her south of the Finger Defiant for the first time since she was in his employ, expecting to head all the way to Durpar. Along the path, she was forced to resort to Angul after a phantom attacked Thormud during a divination the dwarf determined the disturbance led to Adamas Tooth and she recovered a fragment of plangent crystal from the monster after dispatching it.\nClose to Sezilinta, and within reach of Adamas Tooth, they stopped for Thormud to summon a champion he called upon Prince Monolith just in time for a new demon to attack them. The summoned elemental agreed to stay with them if they turned instead north, where it claimed the true source of the corruption was they agreed, but Thormud turned out to harbor an affliction after the fight.\nThey crossed a pass between the Giants Belt and the Dustwall to arrive at the Raurin seeking shelter from a coming storm, they made a brief stop in a cave, where they found the elf enclave of Al Qahara. There, she learned of the Palace of the Purple Emperor to the north, which the elves had dubbed the Storm Spike she also learned of the curse on that place, and received the sword Sadrul, which a local elf hoped would avenge its previous wielder, dead from a curse in the returned Palace.\nShe entered the Palace later together with Prince Monolith, and the geomancers familiar, Xet. She encountered two missing elves, presumably from Al Qahara, controlled by the same crystal that Thormud had encountered,  then she was forced to use Angul again in order to defeat a water elemental. They eventually came across Ususi Manaallin, Iahn Qoyllor, Warian and Zeltaebar Datharathi, who where in a trap. After rescuing them, they joined forces. Afterwards, they entered the Imperial Weapons Cache and fought Pandoryms forces.\nZeltaebar Datharathi briefly proposed her some trade with Stardeep, but she wasnt interested.\nAfter resealing Pandorym, Kiril had decided to head back for Stardeep. Thormud gave her Xet as a gift unfortunaely, her resolve wavered in Laothkund, and she postponed the last leg of her trip for months. At some point after Midwinter of , Kiril was in a bad way after Angul was stolen it was soon returned to her after the thief, Gage, stole it back from the Shadow Tongue thieves of Laothkund. Gage told her that the item had been stolen on behalf of Nangulis in response to that name, she revealed her past, and decided to revisit Stardeep to see if there were any actual news from Nangulis.\nThey were attacked along the way by the necromancer Sathra, whom Gage had claimed hed slain during the theft Kiril used Angul to slay her. When she arrived at the Causeway of Stardeep, she and Gage discovered elven corpses resulting from a pitched battle defenders from Stardeep afterwards demanded her sword in return for allowing her to enter. She refused before the defenders could insist, Gage revealed it was a trap in which he was involved. Though Angul refused to aid her in the fight against the Empyrean Knights of Stardeep, the sudden arrival of Raidon Kane and Adrik Commorant allowed them to prevail. She joined forces with the strangers, but violently refused Gages further company past that point.\nShe led Raidon and Adrik into SildÃ«yuir. They soon found Moonveil Citadel under attack from nilshai one of them revealed that they were operating on behalf of the Abolethic Sovereignty. Then they sought out the Edgewarden, who opened a passage for them to the Underdungeon beneath Stardeep. Shortly after Adriks death, she caught up with the Keeper Telarian, who claimed that Delphe had been the one to use Nangulis name when seeking her sword.\nKiril accompanied Telarian, intent on stopping Delphe from releasing the Traitor along the way, they were slowed down by several of Cynosures bodies, which Telarian dispatched violently and without a fight with a powerful spell. She asked Raidon to use his Cerulean Sign to teleport them into the chamber with Delphe at the last moment, Telarian revealed himself to be the actual traitor, striking at her with Nis.\nThe contact between Angul and Nis caused the blades to merge into Angul-Nis rejoined, Nangulis spirit contacted Kiril. Though theirs was a bitter parting, she eventually accepted that he had to sunder his spirit in two again in order to prevent the Traitor from escaping his prison.\nShe turned out to be incapable of letting go of Nangulis afterwards, and grabbed Angul again before his soul could depart for the afterlife.\nShortly after 1385 DR, Kiril entered the Vilhon Wilds and disappeared. According to the Chalk Destrier, Kiril, Thormud and a dragonet named Xet went to some place known as \"Returned Abeir\" at some point before 1396 DR. She gave her sword, Angul, to the Chalk Destrier in exchange for a portal to Returned Abeir."
