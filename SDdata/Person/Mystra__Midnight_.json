You can’t just grab onto her when you need magic, squeeze the power out of her, and discard her when you’re done. That sort of treatment comes back to you.

        "mainbody": "Before her ascension to godhood, the third Mystra was a woman named Midnight, who, along with several other individuals, including Kelemvor, played a large role during the Avatar Crisis, also known as the Time of Troubles.\n\n===Early Life===\nMidnight, born '''Ariel Manx''' in [[1332 DR]], was the second child of [[Theus Manx]], a merchant, and his wife [[Paiyse]]. Midnight had an elder sibling named [[Rysanna]] who assumed the role of the family's demure \"princess\" whenever wealthy suitors called. As a teenager, Midnight became familiar with the night's populace of [[bard]]s, [[rogue|thieves]], [[sorcerer]]s, and [[fighter]]s and was eventually nicknamed \"Midnight\" by these friends, a name she immediately preferred to Ariel.\n\nMidnight's first taste of magic began with her tryst with the [[Conjuration|conjurer]] [[Tad]], who set her on her path. She began to exhibit less interest in her hedonistic pursuits and more in the quest for magical knowledge and training, gradually becoming more obsessed with her magical quest. Eventually, Midnight moved out of the family home to seek her own path.\n\nIt was during this time that she fell into the worship of [[Mystra]], whose attention Midnight attracted during her time of service in one of Mystra's temples. From her 21st year on, Midnight began to feel a presence from time to time. She would feel her skin tingle coolly and began to feel that she was somehow being followed or observed. After such attentions, she always found that spells, which she had labored over for weeks, would suddenly work without any problem. Midnight soon suspected that she had been granted special attention by Mystra herself and believed that she was being groomed for the position of [[Magister]].\n\n[[Sunlar]], high priest of the [[Deepingdale]] temple of Mystra, took Midnight under his supervision. It was during this time that Midnight's knowledge of self-defense and magic improved leaps and bounds and Midnight spent a year in the temple at Deepingdale before she left. For the next three years Midnight devoted herself to Mystra's worship and pursued every scrap of magic she could.\n\n===Ascension===\n{{main|Time of Troubles}}\n[[File:Yawning Portal - Waterdeep.jpg|left|thumb|''Kelemvor and Midnight in Waterdeep'']]\nDuring the Time of Troubles, when the gods were cast down by [[Ao]], Midnight joined with Kelemvor Lyonsbane, Cyric, and [[Adon]] in the search for the stolen [[Tablets of Fate]]. During this time, the previous Mystra was killed by the deity [[Helm]] for defying Ao's command and trying to climb the [[Celestial Stairway]] back to the [[Astral Sea|heavens]]. Her death caused great damage to the Weave, but eventually Ao selected Midnight to replace the destroyed Mystra, restoring the magic of [[Toril]].
