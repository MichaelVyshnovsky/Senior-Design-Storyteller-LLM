Frenzix was a doppelganger active in Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
Frenzix was one of several doppelgangers who replaced and impersonated the servants at the Lightfinger Estate. Upon exposing the doppelgangers, Open Lord Laeral Silverhand admitted that she was unsure whether they had been replacing the servants at the behest of the Lightfinger familys enemies or whether the family had recruited them rather than normal servants.
When adventurers arrived at the Lightfinger Estate to investigate and quell an uprising of monsters, they encountered and fought with Frenzix. This led them to realize that doppelgangers had replaced the Lightfinger servants.
