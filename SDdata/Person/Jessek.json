        "History": "[[Hamezaar]], the [[vampire]] ruler of the [[Boneyard (Earthroot)|Boneyard]], once worked to recruit Death, Disease, and Destruction to his undead armies, but they declined for lack of interest.\n\n''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], the trio were searching for an [[annihilator]], intending to capture and control it with the aid of Jessek's ''[[charm monster]]'' eye-ray power. After they had an annihilator, Jessek wanted to hunt down and slay the outcast beholder [[Tobulux]] for being an abomination, as well as his [[illithid]] companion [[Ralayn]] who would oppose them."
