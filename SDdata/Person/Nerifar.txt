'''Nerifar''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Abeir]], a descendant of [[Shasphur]], and an ancestor of [[Clan Kepeshkmolik]].

==Relationships==
Nerifar was the direct ancestor of [[Kepeshkmolik Thymara]].

==History==
Nerifar was one of the dragonborn clan leaders who took part in the [[battle of the Crippled Mountain]]. While [[Iskdara]], [[Shurideh]], [[Reshvemi]], and [[Thuchir]] infiltrated the [[Crippled Mountain|Celestial Mountain]] to kill [[Rhodrolytharnestrix]], Nerifar was one of the clan leaders who led the dragonborn rebels against Rhodrolytharnestrix's [[dragon]] army.

Nerifar survived the final battle and was one of the founders of [[Tymanchebar]], and presumably, he was the first patriarch of Clan Kepeshkmolik.
