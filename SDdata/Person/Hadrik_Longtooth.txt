'''Hadrik Longtooth''' was a elder warrior of the [[Gray Wolf tribe]] and an agent of the [[Forsworn]] that lived on the [[Sword Coast North]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|It's the Packmasters who made the deal with the Netherese, corrupting the spirit of our Tribe into a twisted mockery of its former self.|Hadrik, to the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]].}}

==Personality==
Hadrik detested the leaders of the Gray Wolf tribe that aligned his people with the [[Shadovar]] of returned [[Netheril]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Hadrik worked alongside the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to strike out against the Gray Wolf Packmasters of [[Elder Rock]]. Some of the Gray Wolf tribes people had begun to worship [[Shar]], the eternal enemy of [[Selûne]], patron of [[werewolves]]. Hadrik and the adventurer recovered talismans of Shar and Selûne from the tribe members of Elder Rock, in order to launch a final assault against [[Gray Wolf Den]].

Once they were ready, the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridget infiltrated Gray Wolf Den at Hadrik's behest and slew the tribe's leaders. Notable among the three tribal leaders was [[Ethraniev Marrowslake]], the bloodthirsty barbarian that originally swore allegiance to the [[Prince of Shade]] [[Clariburnus Tanthul]].
