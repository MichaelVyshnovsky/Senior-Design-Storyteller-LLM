Goodwife Winnstrom, mostly known as Goody Winn, was the informal mayor of Winter Edge in 1484 DR.
Just after the start of the Darkening, Goody Winn urged her villagers to evacuate the village to avoid the coming orc troops. She also hired an adventuring party to take the half-orc Rhupp to the Dark Arrow Keep in hopes of stopping the war.
