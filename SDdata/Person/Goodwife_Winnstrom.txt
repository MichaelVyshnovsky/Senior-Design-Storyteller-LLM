'''Goodwife Winnstrom''', mostly known as '''Goody Winn''', was the informal mayor of [[Winter Edge]] in [[1484 DR]].
  
==History==
Just after the start of the [[Darkening]], Goody Winn urged her villagers to evacuate the village to avoid the coming [[orc]] troops. She also hired an adventuring party to take the [[half-orc]] [[Rhupp]] to the [[Dark Arrow Keep]] in hopes of stopping the war.
