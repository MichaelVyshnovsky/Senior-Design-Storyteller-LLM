Muntiver Salesh was the high priest of the Goldhall of the Sacraments, a temple dedicated to Waukeen, in Urmlaspyr in 1358 DR.
Muntiver was the leader of Waukeens faithful in Urmlaspyr. His congregation within the temple consisted of 5 other priests and no followers due to Waukeens abrupt disappearance during the Time of Troubles. Unbeknownst to his brethren in the church, Muntiver secretly considered worshiping the newly risen deity Cyric whom he believed stole some of Waukeens divine power.
