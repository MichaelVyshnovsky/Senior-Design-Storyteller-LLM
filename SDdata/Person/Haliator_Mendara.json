        "Description": "Commander Mendara was a hardened and cruel man, middle-aged by [[1373 DR]]. He had a reputation of turning a bland eye on extortion and looting done by the Red Plumes of Hillsfar.",
        "Activities": "Haliator commanded roughly 240 Red Plumes arranged into 24 detachments. He condoned looting so long as his troops were the ones doing the looting.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the [[Zhentarim]] became targeted by a mysterious [[Order of the Crippled Fang]]. The [[Shind Road]] that connected [[Hillsfar]] and Y没lash became swarmed by the [[fiends]] in service to the cult. Haliator's Red Plumes occasionally clashed with the roaming monsters, however, he showed little interest in aiding Zhent patrols and [[Merrik]] who was taken to Y没lash as a prisoner to be executer at a later date."
