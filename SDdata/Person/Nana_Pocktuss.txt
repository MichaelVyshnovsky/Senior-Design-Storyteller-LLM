'''Nana Pocktuss''' was a [[sea hag]] in the [[Thunder Cliff Caves]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She and her sisters [[Auntie Unk]] and [[Granny Muyuk]] formed a sea hag coven.

==Personality==
Nana Pocktuss enjoyed dancing. She was bored with the fanatical [[Talos]] cultists she was allied with.

==Activities==
Nana Pocktuss and her sisters ate the edible body parts of drowned sailors and animated the inedible body parts as [[skull flier]]s to protect their lair.

==Relationships==
The [[Cult of Talos]] maintained a base of operations in the Thunder Cliff Caves. The sea hags had come to terms with the cultists and entered into a mutual-protection agreement. In addition, the followers of Talos provided the corpses of sailors who drowned after being shipwrecked on the magical reefs. In return, the coven assisted the cult with specific issues.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], the Thunder Cliff Caves were attacked by a group of [[adventurers]]. Their main objective was to defeat the Talos cultists but they also confronted Nana Pocktuss and her sisters.
