Ichi was a korobokuru yakuza in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
Ichi was a kobun of the Big Head gang. He often visited the Winter Sect temple but preferred life among the eta community.
Ichi was recruited by the monks Kogi and his friend Bupposo to find a girl that could seduce monks. Ichi hired the young maiden O-Shino.
Ichi was a wispy individual, forever cringing and bowing in the presence of others. He played the part of a boastful bully, self-important, and cruel. He had many miserable cronies, but no true friends.
