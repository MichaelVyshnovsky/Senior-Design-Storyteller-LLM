'''Ichi''' was a [[korobokuru]] [[yakuza]] in [[Nakamaru]] around [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Ichi was a [[Wa-an dictionary#K|''kobun'']] of the [[Big Head]] gang. He often visited the [[Winter Sect]] temple but preferred life among the [[Wa-an dictionary#E|''eta'']] community.

==History==
Ichi was recruited by the monks [[Kogi]] and his friend [[Bupposo]] to find a girl that could seduce monks. Ichi hired the young maiden [[O-Shino]].

==Personality==
Ichi was a wispy individual, forever cringing and bowing in the presence of others. He played the part of a boastful bully, self-important, and cruel. He had many miserable cronies, but no true friends.
