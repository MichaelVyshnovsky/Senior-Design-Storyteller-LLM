Tanova was a noble lady turned vampire.
In Baldurs Gate, she met and married Jon Irenicus sometime after his exile from Suldanessellar.
Sometime after their marriage, she was murdered by a mage named Centeol, who was in love with Jon and believed that Jon would reciprocate her feelings. However, Jon tracked her down and put a curse on her as revenge. He took Tanovas body to be transformed into a vampire by Bodhi, after Jon Irenicus met her in Baldurs Gate.
In the , Gorions Ward fought her in the torture chamber in Bodhis lair in Athkatla, Amn, and defeated her. However, she was not fully slain. She was later ordered to chase a Shadow Thief called Sansuki and again fought Gorions Ward, but avoided defeat by transforming into mist.
