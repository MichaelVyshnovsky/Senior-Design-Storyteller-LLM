'''Tanova''' was a noble lady turned [[vampire]].

==History==
In [[Baldur's Gate]], she met and married [[Jon Irenicus]] sometime after his exile from [[Suldanessellar]].

Sometime after their marriage, she was murdered by a mage named [[Centeol]], who was in love with Jon and believed that Jon would reciprocate her feelings. However, Jon tracked her down and put a curse on her as revenge. He took Tanova's body to be transformed into a vampire by [[Bodhi]], after Jon Irenicus met her in Baldur's Gate.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, [[Gorion's Ward]] fought her in the torture chamber in Bodhi's lair in [[Athkatla]], [[Amn]], and defeated her. However, she was not fully slain. She was later ordered to chase a [[Shadow Thieves|Shadow Thief]] called [[Sansuki]] and again fought Gorion's Ward, but avoided defeat by transforming into mist.
