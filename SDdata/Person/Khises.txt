Khises was a legendary hippopotamus in the fables of Cursrah. This character was considered a hero in the tales. In particular, Khises battled Skahmau the Wolfshead at the bottom of the Mother of Rivers.
Princess Amenstar of Cursrah had a painting of this battle scene within her private privy. Pressing the eyes of Khises and Skahmau would open a secret door to the cellars below the royal compound, and she used it frequently to sneak away to be with her friends.
Citizens of Cursrah used the phrase "thank Khises" as an expression of relief.
