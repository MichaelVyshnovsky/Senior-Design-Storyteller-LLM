Melisende was as near to physical perfection as most mortals could come.

==Skills==
Melisende was a formidable opponent, possessing martial and magical skills.

==Possessions==
Melisende owned a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]] +5'', a magical sword, and a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]''.

==Relationships==
She was the daughter of [[Alim Baybars]]. Her mother, and namesake, was from the strange lands far west of the borders of Zakhara. Only her fear of his power kept Melisende from killing her father.
