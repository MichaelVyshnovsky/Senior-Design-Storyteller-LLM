        "mainbody": "'''Breltora Red-Eye''' was a [[half-orc]] stonemason in [[Leilon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "Breltora Red-Eye was friends with the [[Neverwinter|Neverwintan]] soldier Private [[Vester Jessup]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], Private Jessup's commander, Sergeant [[Hazz Yorrum]], sent him and three other soldiers to patrol the [[High Road]] along the [[Mere of Dead Men]]. When the patrol didn't return after already being two days late, Breltora began to worry. However, Yorrum did nothing to investigate the disappearance of the soldiers, so Breltora contacted a group of [[adventurers]]. Breltora and the adventurers pressed Yorrum into showing them the patrol route on a map. The adventurers then rescued the missing soldiers, who had been captured by a [[lizardfolk]] tribe."
