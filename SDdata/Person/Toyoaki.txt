Toyoaki was a monk in Shou Lung in 1358 DR.
Toyoaki was a monk devoted to Nung Chiang, one of the Nine Immortals of the Celestial Empire, and to the Way. He lived in the monastery of Chutung, a city in Chu Yuan province.
In 1358 DR, his masters tasked Toyoaki with the mission of building a new shrine to Nung Chiang among the people living in the Shao Mountains. Eventually, with the help of an adventuring party, he managed to finish building the shrine in time for the next holy day.
