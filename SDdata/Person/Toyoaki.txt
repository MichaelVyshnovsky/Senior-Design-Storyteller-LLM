'''Toyoaki''' was a [[monk]] in [[Shou Lung]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Activities==
Toyoaki was a monk devoted to [[Nung Chiang]], one of the [[Nine Immortals]] of the [[Celestial Empire]], and to [[the Way]]. He lived in the monastery of [[Chu'tung]], a city in [[Chu' Yuan]] province.

==History==
In 1358 DR, his masters tasked Toyoaki with the mission of building a new shrine to Nung Chiang among the people living in the [[Shao Mountains]]. Eventually, with the help of an adventuring party, he managed to finish building the shrine in time for the next holy day.
