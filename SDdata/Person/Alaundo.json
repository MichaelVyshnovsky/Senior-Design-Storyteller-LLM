        "mainbody": "His skull became a priceless relic venerated by the faithful of Deneir, Oghma, and Savras and by the Avowed of Candlekeep. It was said that the bearer of the skull could speak directly with Alaundo using a speak with dead spell, no matter how many centuries has passed. In fact, Alaundo existed as a Weaveghost tied to his skull, which he could speak through when he wished, though hed lost his prophetic ability.\nHowever, Alaundos skull was stolen shortly after his death and was lost. It was greatly sought after by the illithids of Oryndoll, who followed every clue to its supposed location. Around 1370 DR, there were rumors of it being up for sale in the market in Llorbauth, Erlkazar, after being retrieved from a fire drake lair in the Deepwing Mountains, caused an increase in illithid activity on the southern shores of the Deepwash. As for the skull, by 1373 DR, it was apparently kept in a box somewhere, carefully watched over. Alaundos Weaveghost lingered on into the late 15 century DR.\nAlaundo was known to be quiet and erudite, and he was fascinated with books all his life. In life and afterlife, Alaundo sought always to learn more about the world around him and the identity of the Voice within him, in hopes of regaining the prophetic powers that made him feel unique.\nIn life, Alaundo was a wizened elder with white beard and eyebrows. After death, as a Weaveghost, he was but an unseen and unheard presence.\nAs a Weaveghost, Alaundo more or less just flew around, quietly watching and listening and learning, and even when away from his skull, he could still watch and listen through it. He also could use a few spells and other magics like message, dancing lights, chill touch, and thunderwave.\nKnown collectively as the Prophecies of Alaundo, \nThe majority of prophecies told of relatively minor events, but some warned of quite significant happenings. Some specific prophecies of Alaundo were as follows\n* \"A golden unicorn shall travel unmolested through the length of Waterdeep.\"\n* \"…the Aumar line shall outlive the Stag Throne\" it was presumed at the time this meant the kingdom of Athalantar would fall with an Aumar on the throne, but instead Elminster Aumar simply outlived it.\n* In the , tressym would become widespread, and so they did.\n* According to the Candlekeep chanters, \"The wyrm shall wander the earth and such a pestilence will follow in his wake, that all that know of his passing shall be struck down by the plague. So sayeth the wise Alaundo.\" This likely referred to the Plague of Dragons that swept the Vilhon Reach, Chessenta, and Unther in the , and the disease-ridden dragon thought to carry it.\n* According to the Candlekeep chanters, \"When conflict sweeps across the Dales the great lizards of the north shall descend with fire and fury. So sayeth the great Alaundo.\" In the , Lashan Aumersair of Scardale sought to conquer the Dalelands and Lyran the Pretender assaulted Shadowdale, before a Flight of Dragons ravaged the Dalelands, Cormyr, and the Moonsea.\n* Following a \"war among wizards\", then \"Spellfire will rise, and a sword of power, to cleave shadow and evil and master art.\" Elminster and Lhaeo wondered if this pertained to Shandril Shessairs manifestation of spellfire in the , and her adventures and learning the art of magic, while later rumors supposed this to be the Time of Troubles, likely falsely. It was because of this prophecy that the Simbul chose to trust and aid Shandril, as well as because she liked the girl.\n* \"The One Who Is Hidden will in anger cast the gods down into the Realms. The gods will walk among men, amid chaos of Art and nature, and there will be strife in Faerun.\" He also made reference to a Godswar, and to heroes struggling to set things right. According to the Candlekeep chanters, \"When shadows descend upon the lands, our divine lords will walk alongside us as equals. So sayeth the great Alaundo.\" This of course foretold the Time of Troubles of the , which was presaged by the increasing unreliability of magic in 1357 DR.\n* \"White birds shall vanish from the North, and great evil shall die and be reborn.\" This was also believed to refer to the Time of Troubles.\n* An appearance of \"nine black doves\". According to rumor in Wheloon, some sages speculated this was fulfilled in a sighting of dragons dancing in the air above the Thunder Peaks in 1358 DR.\n* \"In the Time of Troubles, all roads will end in Waterdeep.\" Indeed, the events of the Time of Troubles culminated here.\n* According to the Candlekeep chanters, \"In the Year of the Turrets, a great host will come from the east like a plague of locusts. So sayeth the wise Alaundo.\" In that year, 1360 DR, the Tuigan Horde left the Hordelands and threatened Faerûn.\n* Many of his prophecies revolved around the rise of the Bhaalspawn, predicting the Children of Bhaal would bring a storm of death to Faerûn and even the return of the slain Lord of Murder himself. According to the Candlekeep chanters, \"The Lord of Murder shall perish, but in his doom he shall spawn a score of mortal progeny. Chaos will be sewn from their passage. So sayeth the wise Alaundo.\"\n* \"Seven scourges—five long gone, one of the day, and one soon to come—open the door no man can close. Out come the armies of the dead and the legions of the devil made by itself to sweep all Cormyr away in ruin, unless those long dead rise to stand against them.\" In alternative phrasings, they would be \"armies of the dead, and legions of devils\" who would \"sweep it away in ruin, unless those who should have been dead are there to stand against them.\" To guard against this threat, the Lords Who Sleep were formed, with a band of warriors in temporal stasis to await the day when the kingdom had need of them. This was supposed to be fulfilled with the creation and defeat of the seven ghazneths in the .\n* \"The wisest of dragons will be found on the Islands of Selûne.\" Carmanstansos the Geomancer believed this referred to the fabled Dragon Sage dwelled in the Moonshae Isles (for Selûne was goddess of the moon).\n* A large-scale magical catastrophe would strike Anauroch in the , which was taken seriously enough by a Zhentarim agent to put together an urgent expedition to recover a treasure there that year. Though not immediately catastrophic, Thultanthar, the City of Shade, returned there in the month of Hammer.\n* In the , there would occur, of course, lightning storms. Gamalon Idogyr considered this fulfilled when lightning bolts produced from Priamon Rakesks pyramid in late Uktar engulfed the Sword Coast and much of Faerûn. With the fall of Priamons pyramid on the Feast of the Moon, Gamalon began to quote a related prophecy, \"And destruction shall come upon the dawn,\" but Khelben ordered him to stop quoting Alaundo and get back to work.\n* In the , the strange events of the Spellplague were marked by blue-white flames. Cadderly Bonaduce wondered if there was a connection.\n* \"Unshackled from shadows, she will rise in moonlit glory and carve a path of brightness to the accursed ones second death. So sayeth the wise Alaundo.\" This mightve referred to the possibility of the Selûnite aasimar Dame Aylin, \"Nightsong\", being freed from her imprisonment in the Shadowfell and her assault on Moonrise Towers and General Ketheric Thorm Jaheira would quote the prophecy if it came to pass in 1492 DR.\n* The Stone That Speaks, containing the trapped spirit of an archmage of Netheril, would be found within the ruins of Tempuss Tears. Candlekeep had sponsored many expeditions to retrieve it, but it had yet to be retrieved by 1366 DR.\n* Though more opaque and obscure than ever, some of his predictions seemed to suggest a \"transcendence\" of dragonkind, with a significant alteration of their position in Lareths Grand Scheme of Justice. This was apparently unfulfilled as of 1357 DR.\nEarly compilations of Alaundos prophecies and chapbooks interpreting them were marked with the runes of Omma and Authem, together representing prophecy, and these formed the basis of the symbol of Candlekeep itself.\nCandlekeeps primary copy of the Prophecies of Alaundo was annotated by First Reader Taltro in the 700s DR, who gathered useful lore on the predictions and how theyd been fulfilled, though Elminster thought much of it \"errant nonsense\". More useful to him was the Commentaries of Iyrauthar, which was the sole book to collect relevant records, rumors, legends, and testimonials on the prophecies.\nAlaundo once wrote a piece encouraging would-be adventurers to explore Toril, in which he introduced himself, outlined the rise and fall of Netheril, mentioned his love for Faerûn, and described many of the wondrous things and the highs and lows of life that hed seen—whether hed seen them with his own eyes or through his visions he did not say. He finished by giving his view of Candlekeeps purpose, that of preserving the lessons of history, and issuing a call to adventure to the reader. He expected it would be read long, long after his death, a thousand years hence.\nAlaundo wrote on other matters too\n* On dwarves \"A grudging, suspicious race.\"\n* On gossip \"Rumor can be a wild thing.\"\n* On civilization \"If proud civilization is a rampant, roaring dragon, laws and their keepers are its mighty skeleton.\"\nHe estimated Toril was home to fourteen continents, not including Faerûn itself, but this was dependent on whether one included large islands and archipelagos. Nevertheless, Elminster said \"That’s good enough for me.\"\nAssociated with him was a magical item known as Alaundos Loop, a golden crystal shaped like a twisted curl that was constantly turning in on itself and apparently concealed eternity itself.\nWhen Alaundo started speaking his prophecies, one of the novitiates invented a means of magically recording his voice in prismatic gemstones, known as the \"echoes of Alaundo\". Spoken in old Common, in much later centuries they required magic to comprehend and only Candlekeeps First Readers and Keepers of Tomes knew the secret of their function. In any case, they rarely bothered with them, since the prophecies were so prone to being misunderstood."
