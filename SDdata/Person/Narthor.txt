'''Narthor''' was a [[hell hound]] living in [[northwest Faer√ªn]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], being one of two that were owned by the [[fire giant]] Duke [[Zalto]].

==Activities==
Narthor lived with Zalto, alongside the hell hound [[Zerebor]], inside the ancient dungeon complex of [[Ironslag]].

At times the two hell hounds chased around and blasted fire at a hollow [[iron]] ball Zalto that would throw around, much to their owner's amusement. This ball measured {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} across, was riddled with holes, and held inside of it the roasted corpse of a [[rock gnome]].
