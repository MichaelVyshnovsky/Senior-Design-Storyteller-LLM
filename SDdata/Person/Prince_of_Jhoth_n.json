        "mainbody": "The last '''Prince of Jhothûn''' was a [[qorrashi]] who was the last living resident of the city of [[Jhothûn (city)|Jhothûn]]. Whatever name the Prince once had was now forgotten.",
        "Description": "The Prince had blue skin covered in a thick frost, and a perpetual aura of intense cold surrounded him. His hair was white.",
        "Personality": "The Prince had a desperate hope of restoring the ancient [[giant]] empire of [[Jhothûn]] to its original glory. By the late fourteenth century [[DR]], he was the only living creature who remembered its history and splendor.",
        "Abilities": "As an ice [[genie]], the Prince's touch caused a magical chill of cold, so severe that it could lead to frostbite. He could walk upon any surface of ice, horizontal or vertical, much like a spider. As a genie, the Prince of Jhothûn was [[Telepathy|telepathic]] and could [[plane shift]]. He had [[darkvision]].\n\nIn addition to these abilities, the Prince of Jhothûn had a number of other inherent magical powers, to say nothing of the many spells he could cast as a powerful [[sorcerer]]. His most powerful spells were ''[[chain lightning]]'', ''[[geas]]'', and ''[[limited wish]]''. He focused on spells of [[evocation]].",
        "Possessions": "The Prince wore a major ''[[ring of protection]]'', a powerful pair of ''[[bracers of armor]]'', and a ''[[cloak of charisma]]''.",
        "Activities": "As the last royal advisor of the royal palace of the Emperors in the capital of Jhothûn, the Prince maintained constant attention on the palace and the portals to the other [[wikipedia:en:Satrap|satrapies]] that were within its walls. By some magic, he recruited guardians for each of three portals in [[Karffbadh]] on the [[Sea of Moving Ice]], [[Choshein]] on the [[High Ice]], and [[Gharreil]] on the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "History": "During the history of the lost empire of Jhothûn, the qorrash served as noble advisors to the [[frost giant]] emperors. After the empire fell, the qorrash continued to guard its secrets, selecting portal guardians to protect each of the remaining seats of the satrapies, maintaining this practice for centuries. The hope was that, someday, the true ruler of the giants would return and restore the Empire. In the meantime, its secrets and treasures would be protected.\n\nBy the time of the late fourteenth century [[DR]], only a single qorrashi advisor prince remained. This qorrashi spoke to the guardians of the three remaining portals, the [[orc]] [[druid]] [[Thurghom]]; the [[half-dragon]] [[remorhaz]], the [[Red Worm]]; and the [[gelugon]] [[Tosvin]]. All served him without knowing who he was or even what they were guarding."
