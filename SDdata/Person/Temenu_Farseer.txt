'''Temenu Farseer''' was a [[Nubari]] [[shaman]] from the [[Tribe of the Wise Ones]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Temenu Farseer was a knowledgeable and intelligent man who venerated wisdom, customary of his people.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Tribe of the Wise Ones]] became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded [[spider katanga]], the [[Mother of a Thousand Young]] was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the [[Fire Mountain]]. Temenu was among the younger and less experienced heroes of the Living Jungle who answered the call, along with [[Green Spirit]] of the [[Koshiva]], [[caiman katanga]] [[Roq Silent Hunter]], [[tam'hi]] [[Allanna]], and [[butu]] [[Tan'u]]. Temenu Farseer's group was sent to enter the spider katanga caverns and faced [[hunting spider katanga]]s who guarded a band of captured adventurers.

It was unknown if Temenu survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the [[Village of the Wise Ones]] for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and nature's healing.
