Temenu Farseer was a Nubari shaman from the Tribe of the Wise Ones of the Malatran Plateau, active in the late 14 century DR.
Temenu Farseer was a knowledgeable and intelligent man who venerated wisdom, customary of his people.
In the late 14 century DR, the Tribe of the Wise Ones became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded spider katanga, the Mother of a Thousand Young was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Temenu was among the younger and less experienced heroes of the Living Jungle who answered the call, along with Green Spirit of the Koshiva, caiman katanga Roq Silent Hunter, tamhi Allanna, and butu Tanu. Temenu Farseers group was sent to enter the spider katanga caverns and faced hunting spider katangas who guarded a band of captured adventurers.
It was unknown if Temenu survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the Village of the Wise Ones for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and natures healing.
