        "History": "Florfindyn lived in peace with his people in the Misty Forest until 1363 DR, when, at the start of the [[Second Dragonspear War]], the [[Hordes of Dragonspear]] attacked the forest. During the fighting, Florfindyn was defeated and captured. The [[cornugon]] [[Vesarius]] recognized him as a prince and took him to [[Dragonspear Castle]].\n\nThere, Florindyn was tortured in order to gain useful information [[Baazka]]'s plan, but with no success. He even managed to escape from the castle, despite being reduced to a mindless beast. Finally, he was saved by some adventurers leading the allied armies."
