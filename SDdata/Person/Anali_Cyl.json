        "mainbody": "'''Anali Cyl''' was a noble woman and a famous General of the [[Luskan]]-[[Neverwinter]] war of [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the city of Luskan launched a military campaign against its bitter southern rival â€“ the city of Neverwinter. Anali Cyl, the daughter of a wealthy [[Cyl]] family, was betrothed to a merchant family scion of [[Waterdeep]]. With the war's advent, Anali was to be shipped away to the City of Splendors. The young woman was outraged over her family's actions. She was rather die defending her home than be wed against her will. Anali's parents sneered at their daughter's words until she grabbed the family heirloom [[falchion]], called ''[[Decision]]'' off the wall, and stormed away.\n\nAnali Cyl joined the defending forces of Neverwinter and, over the course of the war, became a renowned General. She wielded ''[[Decision]]'' in every battle since leaving her family estate behind."
