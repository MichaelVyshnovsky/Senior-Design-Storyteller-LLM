        "mainbody": "'''Lanseril Snowmantle''' ({{Pronounce|LAN|sair|il|_|SNOE|man|tul|refs=}}) was a [[druid]] and a member of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "Lanseril was {{SI|6'2|ft-in|long=yes}} tall. He had dark hair, delicate features, and blue eyes.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|59|3}}",
        "Personality": "He was generally friendly, but could sometimes come across as condescending. He was known to have a somewhat bad aim and had sometimes hit friendly folks with magical lightning. But he was also very diplomatic, a good field strategist, and rarely forgot anything.\n\nLanseril bitterly hated [[wolves]].",
        "Abilities": "Lanseril was capable of casting the [[spell]]s ''[[animal friendship]]'', ''[[call lightning]]'', ''[[call woodland beings]]'', ''[[charm person or mammal]]'', ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[entangle]]'', ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[goodberry]]'', ''[[heat metal]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[locate animals or plants]]'', ''[[neutralize poison]]'', ''[[pass plant]]'', ''[[plant door]]'', ''[[summon insects]]'', ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'', ''[[tree]]'', ''[[trip]]'', ''[[warp wood]]'', and ''[[water walk]]''.\n\nThanks to his druidic powers, Lanseril could also ''[[shapechange]]'' into the form of other animals, such as [[sparrow]]s And he could ''[[pass without trace]]'' through overgrown areas.\n\nBeyond his druidic powers, Lanseril was proficient in identifying [[fungi]] and training [[badger]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Lanseril possessed an [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[circlet]] called the ''[[firecrown]]'', which he had obtained during one of his adventures, as well as a [[scimitar]] and [[quarterstaff]].",
        "History": "He was born in the tiny village of [[Snowmantle]]. His father was [[Raunaeril]], one of the \"lost\" [[elves]] of the [[Border Forest]], while his mother was a [[human]] woman and resident of the village.\n\nOne day in his youth Lanseril met and played tag with a green-clad elven stranger in the woods, whom others believed may have been the [[elven pantheon|elven deity]] [[Rillifane Rallathil]]. When his father angrily approached, the man turned into a mighty [[oak]] that vanished a week later.\n\nAt the age of six, Lanseril's father and mother were killed by raiders from the [[Citadel of the Raven]], along the [[River Tesh]]. He was taken in and taught the ways of druids by [[Haemfaest Sarthun]]. He learned from him the worship of [[Silvanus]], whom the young Lanseril considered to be more believable than Rilifane. A year later, on a cold winter night, Haemfaest was killed by a pack of ravenous wolves who then chased after Lanseril, leading him to flee southwards through the wilds to [[Highmoon]] in [[Deepingdale]].\n\nThere, Lanseril found work as a runner, errand boy, and animal keeper for the local merchant [[Braun]]. Lanseril faithfully served Braun for twelve years, during which time he witnessed many of the local businesses and roads, but all that time Braun's younger cousin saw fit to make him miserable. Then one day [[Briadorn]], a [[ranger]] of the [[Circle of Shadowdale]], witnessed him tending to an injured [[rabbit|hare]] with [[herb]]s and offered to take Lanseril with him to [[Shadowdale]].\n\nAccepting the man's offer, Lanseril moved to Shadowdale and went on to become a stalwart of the Knights of Myth Drannor. He proved himself to be a master in diplomacy and strategy, as well as the possessor of a phenomenal memory. Lanseril and the Knights attacked the [[Flaming Tower]] alongside a group of [[treant]]s, destroying the structure and laying claim to the ''firecrown'' that had belonged to a resident [[fire giant]].\n\nLater in [[1357 DR]], Lanseril participated in the [[first battle of Shadowdale]] and played an instrumental role in defeating [[Zhentil Keep]]'s reinforcements by casting the [[spell]] ''[[insect plague]]''.\n\nAround [[1369 DR]], after hearing that his home village had been conquered by the [[Zhentarim]] he petitioned both the Knights of Myth Drannor and the [[Harpers]] to aid him in driving the Zhents out. Finding that both groups were too preoccupied to help him, Lanseril became even more determined. The first several weeks were successful for Lanseril, but eventually the Zhents sent in a special group of [[mage]]s that killed many of his druid allies and captured him.\n\nThe Zhent forces drag Lanseril back to Snowmantle and trapped him within a new prison there. Knowing it would be easy for him to escape with his ''shapechanging'' powers, the Zhents warned him that they would kill five slaves upon discovery of his escape and would then go on to execute more with each passing hour that he was absent, beginning with his closest friends.",
        "Relationships": "Lanseril was a companion of [[Florin Falconhand]] and [[Jhessail Silvertree]]. During his time liberating the village of Snowmantle, he was friends with a [[badger]] by the name of [[Lawrence]]."
