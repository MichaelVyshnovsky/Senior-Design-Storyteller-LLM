        "mainbody": "'''Arkaneus Silvermane''' was the [[Archdruid]] of [[Mosstone]] and a member of the [[Company of Eight]] in [[Tethyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "Arkaneus knew how to fight with hammer, [[dagger]], and [[Quarterstaff|staff]]. He could ride horses and knew healing techniques and how to tell the weather.\n\nArkaneus was a polyglot, speaking a large number of languages, including such rare languages as the tongue of [[manticore]]s and several dialects of [[Sylvan]].\n\nHe was one of the most powerful members of the Company of Eight.",
        "Personality": "Despite his great druidic powers, Arkaneus always adopted a low profile, rarely intervening during heated discussion between his companions. His patience extended to all areas of life.\n\nHe had never maintained a single absolute point of view of things but changed according to facts, being a cool and rational decision-maker without emotional attachment. Arkaneus believed his service in the Company was a means to confer balance to the chaos of his country.",
        "Relationships": "Arkaneus was attended by three apprentice druids, the married couple [[Leisha]] and [[Thastrun]], who were devoted to the care of [[Cayr Thalwood]], and [[Manfred Arbustle]], who in [[1357 DR]] joined the Company. He had great faith in Manny and trusted that he would find his way despite his struggles and would one day became his successor.\n\nArkaneus felt a close bond of friendship with those in the Company of Eight. Because of his coolness under pressure, [[Tardeth Llanistaph]] relied on him for good advice.",
        "Possessions": "Arkaneus' primary weapon was his ''[[Staff of the Woodlands]]'', but he also carried some throwing daggers and a hammer. He wore [[leather armor]].",
