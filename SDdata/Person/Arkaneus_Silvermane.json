        "mainbody": "Arkaneus Silvermane was the Archdruid of Mosstone and a member of the Company of Eight in Tethyr in the 14 century DR.\nArkaneus knew how to fight with hammer, dagger, and staff. He could ride horses and knew healing techniques and how to tell the weather.\nArkaneus was a polyglot, speaking a large number of languages, including such rare languages as the tongue of manticores and several dialects of Sylvan.\nHe was one of the most powerful members of the Company of Eight.\nDespite his great druidic powers, Arkaneus always adopted a low profile, rarely intervening during heated discussion between his companions. His patience extended to all areas of life.\nHe had never maintained a single absolute point of view of things but changed according to facts, being a cool and rational decision-maker without emotional attachment. Arkaneus believed his service in the Company was a means to confer balance to the chaos of his country.\nArkaneus was attended by three apprentice druids, the married couple Leisha and Thastrun, who were devoted to the care of Cayr Thalwood, and Manfred Arbustle, who in 1357 DR joined the Company. He had great faith in Manny and trusted that he would find his way despite his struggles and would one day became his successor.\nArkaneus felt a close bond of friendship with those in the Company of Eight. Because of his coolness under pressure, Tardeth Llanistaph relied on him for good advice.\nArkaneus primary weapon was his Staff of the Woodlands, but he also carried some throwing daggers and a hammer. He wore leather armor.\nArkaneus was born in Mosstone and was tutored by Archdruid Tethirmin. Tethirmin wanted Arkaneus to be his successor, but Arkaneus was hesitant about this.\nthumb|280px|The Company of Eight in 1357 DR, with Arkaneus at far right.\nIn 1346 DR, he joined the Company and became the longest surviving member after Tardeth Llanistaph.\nAfter fighting with the Company of Eight in the Tethyrian civil war, Arkaneus did in fact succeed Tethirmin, despite his misgivings. As Archdruid of Mosstone, Arkaneus also became a member of Queen Zarandas Royal Privy Council.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryDruids\nCategoryMembers of the Company of Eight\nCategoryMembers of the Royal Privy Council of Tethyr\nCategoryInhabitants of Tethyr\nCategoryInhabitants of Mosstone\nCategoryInhabitants of the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of the Archdruids Grove\nCategoryInhabitants of Greenshores\nCategoryInhabitants of Cape Velen\nCategoryInhabitants of the Corsairs Sea\nCategoryInhabitants of the Firedrake Shores\nac61dzc435m80de2vi1mwdmow5th3tz"
