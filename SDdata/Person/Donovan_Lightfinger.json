        "mainbody": "Lord Donovan Lightfinger was a wealthy aristocrat in Waterdeep and the original patriarch of the wealthy Lightfinger family.\nDonovan was said to have been a rogue who delighted in tricks and traps.\nDonovan amassed his great wealth through a long career as an adventurer that took him all over Faer√ªn. Many of his greatest and most lucrative victories were won against fiends and their cultists, with one of his earliest and most notable triumphs occurring in a duel against the rakshasa known as Jurrgal. While he reaped the benefits of these battles in his lifetime, he did not always finish his fights, and amassed many enemies who went on to seek vengeance against his family.\nHe eventually settled into an uneasy retirement in Waterdeep at the head of his newly wealthy family. His descendants would go on to squander his spoils and eventually begin dealing with the same kinds of fiends that he had fought against."
