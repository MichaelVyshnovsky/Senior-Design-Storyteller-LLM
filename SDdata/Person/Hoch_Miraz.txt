Hoch Miraz was a wizard from Calimshan in west Faerûn.
Circa 1330 DR, Hoch Miraz was aboard the Golden Crown, a treasure galleon leaving the Calishite mining colony of Berranzo on the island of Gundarlun in the Trackless Sea. Struck by a storm, the Golden Crown sunk off the coast of the island, and Hoch Miraz went down with the vessel.
Hoch Miraz was said to possess a staff of the magi, a ring of spell turning, and a cube of force, though the latter was thought to have failed, to account for Hochs doom. These were still thought to lay in the sunken ship in 1370 DR.
