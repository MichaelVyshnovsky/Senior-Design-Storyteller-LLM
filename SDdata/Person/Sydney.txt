'''Sydney''' was a female [[wizard]] and a member of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] and apprentice of [[Dendybar]].

She was ordered by her master to kill the [[Companions of the Hall]] with the help of the [[Luskan]] guard [[Jierdan]] and the [[flesh golem]] [[Bok]].
They also partnered with assassin [[Artemis Entreri]] for a time, but in the end Sydney was killed.

==Possessions==
Sydney owned a ''[[mirror of mental prowess]]'' that was gifted to her by Dendybar. She kept this mirror within her small room at the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]].
