'''Galaghard Obarskyr III''' was the king of [[Cormyr]] from [[897 DR]] to [[953 DR]] and fought against the invading [[Witchlords of Wyvernwater]].

==History==
Born in [[873 DR]], Galaghard was the first son of [[Bryntarth Obarskyr I|Bryntarth I]].

He became king in [[897 DR]].

In [[900 DR]], on the eve of Galaghard's [[battle with the Witch Lords]], the elven court of [[Othorion Keove]] (the last survivor of the court of the [[Iliphar Nelnueve|Lord of the Scepters]]) arrived and both sides in the conflict attended, separately. Othorion refused to help either side, stating that the purpose of his visit was hunting. Galaghard led his army into the battle and was facing defeat until Othorion's elves entered the battle. Othorion justified this move by saying that he felt like hunting [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s.

==Relatives==
Galaghard was married, and had three children: [[Rhiigard Obarskyr|Rhiigard]], [[Tanalar Obarskyr|Tanalar]], and [[Kathla Obarskyr|Kathla]].

He was named after his great grandfather, [[Galaghard Obarskyr I|Galaghard I]], and his great-great grandfather, [[Galaghard Obarskyr II|Galaghard II]], who, strangely enough was in fact the same person and also his grandfather [[Galaghard Obarskyr I|Draxius]].

==Equipment==
In battle, Galaghard wore full plate mail armor with an open helm so that, despite the risk of being struck by an arrow, his troops could identify him. He rode a black armored war-[[horse]] with a headpiece featuring a [[unicorn]]'s horn.

==Description==
It was said that a particular [[Chess (game)|chess]] set in the royal palace had a good likeness of Galaghard as the white [[moonstone]] king piece. It was inspired by his battle with the Witch Lords.
