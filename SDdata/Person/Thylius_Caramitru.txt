'''Thylius Caramitru''' was a minor noble in [[Mulmaster]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Breath of the Yellow Rose|10}}

==Personality==
Thylius was extremely charismatic. His main joy was manipulating others to do his bidding. As a dilettante, he had studied a little of everything, but his favorite subject was herbalism.

==Powers==
Like his father, Thylius had some psionic abilities.

==History==
Thylius was the son of [[Julios Caramitru]] and [[Korona Caramitru]], two minor nobles working in the city's bureaucracy.

In around [[1491 DR]], after a trip to the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]], he said he had learned the new meditation technique of the [[Yellow Breath]]. Thylius soon had his first disciple in the young [[Riasa Yegorovna]]. They gave a demonstration during a party hosted by [[Astrid Saj]] and [[Rosealine Culkin]] to honor [[Aleyd Burral]], the Resurrected Hero of [[Phlan]].{{Cite adventurers league/Breath of the Yellow Rose|27}}
