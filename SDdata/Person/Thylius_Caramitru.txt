Thylius Caramitru was a minor noble in Mulmaster in the late 15 century DR.
Thylius was extremely charismatic. His main joy was manipulating others to do his bidding. As a dilettante, he had studied a little of everything, but his favorite subject was herbalism.
Like his father, Thylius had some psionic abilities.
Thylius was the son of Julios Caramitru and Korona Caramitru, two minor nobles working in the citys bureaucracy.
In around 1491 DR, after a trip to the Monastery of the Yellow Rose, he said he had learned the new meditation technique of the Yellow Breath. Thylius soon had his first disciple in the young Riasa Yegorovna. They gave a demonstration during a party hosted by Astrid Saj and Rosealine Culkin to honor Aleyd Burral, the Resurrected Hero of Phlan.
