Julann was a member of the Wychlaran of Rashemen who traveled to the Sword Coast on her dajemma, accompanied by her berserker bodyguard Rigah, in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Julann was prone to impulsive decisions and regularly acted on her whims. While she freely trusted others, her judgement as to their motives was somewhat misguided.
