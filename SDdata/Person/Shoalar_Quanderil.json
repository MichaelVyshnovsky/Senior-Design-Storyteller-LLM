        "mainbody": "Shoalar Quanderil was a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Crushing Wave during the Elemental Evil crisis.\nShoalar always appeared jovial, but with a biting sense of humor and tending to laugh at people rather than with them. He saw Olhydras power as a means to become rich.\nShoalar was once a pirate captain on the Sword Coast and a Crushing Wave cultist. In 1491 DR, he transferred to the Dessarin Valley, where he was involved in an assault on the Mirabar diplomatic delegation. However, at Ironford bridge, he was confronted and defeated by some adventurers hired to find the delegation."
