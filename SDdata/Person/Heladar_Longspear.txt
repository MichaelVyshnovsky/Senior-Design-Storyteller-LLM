'''Heladar Longspear''' was a male [[warrior]] member of the [[Zhentilar]] in [[High Dale]].

==History==
Heladar fought for [[Zhentil Keep]] in [[Daggerdale]] and in the conquest of the [[Citadel of the Raven]]. In [[1358 DR]], Heladar commanded a small [[Zhent]] occupation army that secretly conquered High Dale. However, [[Elminster Aumar]] and [[Sharantyr]] casually discovered the Zhent plot regarding the dale and started an insurrection in which Heladar was killed by the [[Harpers]] [[Itharr Jathram|Itharr]] and [[Belkram Hardeth|Belkram]].
