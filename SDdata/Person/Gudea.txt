Gudea was the ruler of Ssintar in Unther in 1357 DR.
Gudea was a supporter of Gilgeam. However, like many, he hid from the king when the situation was desperate. He was bargaining with Furifax and the cult of Tiamat in order to survive.
Gudea was a natural pessimist, always figuring the worst scenarios. He had no ambitions to take power.
