| daterefs       = In the ebook version of Temptation, the Realmslore section declares the events of the first part to happen in around five years starting 759 DR. In the first chapter, Nuressa, the warrior, tells Elminster theyre in early Mirtul. If it is assumed that the events happened in at most five and a half years, as more than five and a half years becomes around six years, then the last events in Part 1 must happen at most during Uktar of 764 DR. Given Feldrins warning during the coronation that the Lords of Laothkund are already planning an attack, this timeline seems plausible. Further development may yet alter the result.
Klandaerlas Glymril was a wizard and the Master of Glymril Gard during the midâ€“8 century DR.
He liked it when the scene out his window was tranquil.
During the night of his death, he wore a black robe.
He could place wyverns in spell-thrall, and had the ability to raise towers from ruins, though this bound them to his lifeforce.
Two of his guards were Halglond and Curthas. He also kept numerous wyverns in spell-thrall, which he kept rather on the edge of starvation.
He carried at least one wand and was the owner of Glymril Gard, a tower he raised from a ruin with his own magic.
Klandaerlas Glymril had at some point raised his fortress, Glymril Gard, from the ruins of an earlier fortress by using magic. He had also gathered a number of wyverns he kept under ongoing spell-thrall.
One night late in the , Klandaerlas Glymril noticed an enigmatic entity that was attracting the attention of his guards, and came out of his tower with a wand to threaten it. The creature hardened into the shape of a woman, and then swept through him he died with a scream before turning into a pyre. The tower collapsed nigh-instantly upon his passing.
