'''Khenel Barony''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]] with a great interest in [[spelljammer|spelljamming]].

==Description==
Khenel wore orange and brown robes, with an orange cap covering the top of his shoulder-length hair. He had brown eyes, with a pronounced nose and thin eyebrows.

==Personality==
A shrewd businessman and politician, Khenel preferred to use his magical ability to generate wealth, rather than waste his time on "dangerous yet mundane" adventuring.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|501|Khenel's Philosopher's Egg}}

==Possessions==
Being a powerful wizard, Khenel owned several magical items: a ''[[robe of protection]]'', a ''[[philosopher's egg]]'', and a ''[[ring of feather falling]]''. He also carried with him an art book titled ''[[Soul d'Art]]''.

==Activites==
Khenel spent much of his time attempting to influence the magical trends of his home town of [[Waterdeep]]. He considered spelljamming to be an enormous technological breakthrough, and argued that harnessing it was "necessary to the continued trade-worthiness of Waterdeep."

After learning a local thieves' guild had come into possession of a ''[[philosopher's egg]]'', Khenel orchestrated a takeover of the organization. He intended to use the ''egg'' to craft a ''[[philosopher's stone]]'', making himself extremely wealthy in the process.
