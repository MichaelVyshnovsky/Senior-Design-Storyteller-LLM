Kalivan was a shukenja and priest of the Lords of Creation in the town of Srelanat in the Kuong Kingdom in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Holding the title "Priest" circa 1357 DR, Kalivan governed the temple and the town itself. He also controlled the emerald mines that the temple owned there.
Moreover, he was even involved in the widespread gem smuggling network operating out of the town, and was related to the Jarvatya jinyan family of Ranguri.
