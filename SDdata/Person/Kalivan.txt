'''Kalivan''' was a [[shukenja]] and priest of the [[Lords of Creation]] in the town of [[Srelanat]] in the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Holding the title "Priest" ''circa'' [[1357 DR]], Kalivan governed the temple and the town itself. He also controlled the [[emerald]] mines that the temple owned there.

Moreover, he was even involved in the widespread [[gem]] smuggling network operating out of the town, and was related to the [[Jarvatya]] [[Kuong_Kingdom#Society|jinyan]] family of [[Ranguri]].
