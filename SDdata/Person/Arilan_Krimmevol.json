        "mainbody": "Captain Arilan Krimmevol was a member of the Amnian Krimmevol family and the Council Army officer who commanded Citadel Amnur in the late 14 century DR after the untimely demise of Commander Endrick Hardlm.\nArilan Krimmevol was stationed as an officer at Citadel Amnur in the service of the incompetent Commander Endrick Hardlm, until the Commander was devoured by a red dragon attack in the . The beast was in turn attacked by the blue dragon Araugauthos, who tore apart the red wyrms wings and caused it to fall into a nearby chasm where it was impaled upon sharp rocks. Captain Krimmevol took the opportunity to step forward and represent the fortress when Araugauthos returned and demanded an audience, and over two tendays he took part in an exhaustive set of discussions wherein he informed the Bluetalon of the historical events that had passed since she was imprisoned in Undermountain.\nTo everyones relief, Araugauthos thanked the humans for their assistance and departed after claiming all the treasure from the dead wyrms nearby lair. Captain Krimmevol led a detachment of soldiers to investigate the lair as well, and though the hoard had been quite effectively cleared out, he discovered a portable hole that had been crammed into a crack and contained a dozen +1 short swords and a dozen +1 shields of dwarven make.\nWith no challenges to his command of the fortress, Captain Krimmevol proceeded to administer it much more effectively than his predecessor did. He addressed the glaring deficiencies that had been allowed to fester thus far, and instilled discipline and training that soon had his troops approaching the elite competency held by nearby Citadel Rashturl."
