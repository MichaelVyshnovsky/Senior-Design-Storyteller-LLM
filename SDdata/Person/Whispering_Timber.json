        "mainbody": "The Whispering Timber was a powerful wood woad that lived in the forested foothills of the Storm Horns during the late 15 century DR.\nThe local satyrs in the region knew a ritual to summon forth the Whispering Timber, using a fox tail among other ingredients. Like the local dryads, the Whispering Timber was hostile to most non-fey due to the destructive presence of Archwizard Amskars forces."
