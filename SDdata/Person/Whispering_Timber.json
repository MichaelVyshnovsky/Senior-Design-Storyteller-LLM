        "mainbody": "The '''Whispering Timber''' was a powerful [[wood woad]] that lived in the forested foothills of the [[Storm Horns]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}",
        "History": "The local [[satyr]]s in the region knew a ritual to summon forth the Whispering Timber, using a [[fox]] tail among other ingredients. Like the local [[dryad]]s, the Whispering Timber was hostile to most non-[[fey]] due to the destructive presence of Archwizard [[Amskar]]'s forces."
