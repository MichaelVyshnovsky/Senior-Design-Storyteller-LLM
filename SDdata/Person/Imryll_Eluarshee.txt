'''Imryll Elusarshee''', also known as the '''Deeping Princess''',  was the [[half-elf]] founder of [[Deepingdale]]. She envisioned a land where [[human]], [[elves]], and half-elves could join in a common society focused on the elven lore and ways of living in [[Cormanthor]], without destroying the deep forest.  

Considering the state of the dale following the [[Retreat]], with the strongly aligned communities of humans and elves, this vision and her legacy were a success.
