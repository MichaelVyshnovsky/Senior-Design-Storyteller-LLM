Imryll Elusarshee, also known as the Deeping Princess,  was the half-elf founder of Deepingdale. She envisioned a land where human, elves, and half-elves could join in a common society focused on the elven lore and ways of living in Cormanthor, without destroying the deep forest.  
Considering the state of the dale following the Retreat, with the strongly aligned communities of humans and elves, this vision and her legacy were a success.
