Nyh Ilmichh was an envoy of the Red Wizards of Thay sent by Szass Tam to propose an alliance between Thay and the Council of Waterdeep in the 1490s DR.
One day, Nyh Illichh, under orders from her master, approached the Council of Lords of Waterdeep with the purpose of setting up a meeting between Thay and the Council in the hope they could help each other against the rising menace of Tiamat and the Cult of the Dragon.
Eventually the Council sent a band of adventurers to speak with Nyh at her residence at the Thayan embassy in Waterdeep. Nyh explained that they needed to meet the tharchion Eseldra Yeth, but this was possible only in her residence in Thay.
