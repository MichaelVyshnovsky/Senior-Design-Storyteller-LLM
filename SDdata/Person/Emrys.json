        "History": "Some time around {{Yearlink|-3500}}, Tarchamus destroyed the Netherese floating city of [[Tenish]] using his [[Tarchamus' volcano|''volcano'']] spell. After the destruction of Tenish, Emrys convinced the most powerful Netherese arcanists to block Tarchamus's access to the [[Weave]], which must have required the intercession of [[Mystryl]].{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|4137}} \n\nYears after Tarchamus built his [[Library of Tarchamus|library]], Emrys realized it was intended as a trap for Tarchamus's rivals. Emrys entered the library and placed many wards on the structure to make it impossible to [[scry]] and thus extremely difficult for anyone to locate.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|6456}} He removed the ''volcano'' scroll from the pedestal on which Tarchamus had placed it and hid it away in a secret room. However, Emrys met his end when he set off a poisoned arrow trap. His [[ghost]] haunted the library for millennia, though he was much less malevolent than the ghosts of Tarchamus' apprentices.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|?}}"
