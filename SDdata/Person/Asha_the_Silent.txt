==History==
{{quote
|All around me, the tales of the Pact are wiped away day by day. My pack is gone, but by Selûne's hand I survive. By her will, I carry its ancient history in my heart. On this day dedicated to the honored dead, I begin my secret record.
|''The opening of ''[[The Book of the New Moon]]'', written by Asha''
}}

Asha was originally the wolf '''Halftail''', the animal companion of [[Niree Swifthands]], the high priestess of the [[Temple of the Half-Moon]] in [[Elmwood]]. Niree was a [[lycanthrope]] and member of the [[New Moon Pact]], and was executed when the Pact was declared heretical by the [[church of Selûne]] at the behest of High Moonmistress [[Brima Chintamn]] in the {{YearlinkName|757}}. Halftail avoided capture by the forces led by [[Bright Lady's Tower]] and was transformed into a human by the hand of [[Selûne]], taking the name Asha. She was charged by the goddess with protecting the legacy of the New Moon Pact and safeguarding the Selûnite faith against threats from within and without.

Later in that year, she joined Moonshadow Hall as a priestess, and on the [[Feast of the Moon]] she began writing ''[[The Book of the New Moon]]'', a tome that described the true nature of the New Moon Pact, as well as the sacred rite that allowed a lycanthrope to join the Pact and become empowered by Selûne. After completing the tome, she hid it in the archives of the temple so that it might be found in the future and be used to redeem the Pact. She eventually became the High Moonmistress of Moonshadow Hall despite never speaking a word.

Asha's hopes for the Pact's legacy were ultimately fulfilled in the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, when the [[werewolf]] High Moonmistress [[Feena Archwood]] found the tome and recreated the Pact.
