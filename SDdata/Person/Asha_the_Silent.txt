Wolf
Asha the Silent was a wolf and later human who became High Moonmistress of Moonshadow Hall in Yhaunn during the 8 century DR. She was known for never speaking during her time at Moonshadow Hall.
Asha was originally the wolf Halftail, the animal companion of Niree Swifthands, the high priestess of the Temple of the Half-Moon in Elmwood. Niree was a lycanthrope and member of the New Moon Pact, and was executed when the Pact was declared heretical by the church of Sel没ne at the behest of High Moonmistress Brima Chintamn in the . Halftail avoided capture by the forces led by Bright Ladys Tower and was transformed into a human by the hand of Sel没ne, taking the name Asha. She was charged by the goddess with protecting the legacy of the New Moon Pact and safeguarding the Sel没nite faith against threats from within and without.
Later in that year, she joined Moonshadow Hall as a priestess, and on the Feast of the Moon she began writing The Book of the New Moon, a tome that described the true nature of the New Moon Pact, as well as the sacred rite that allowed a lycanthrope to join the Pact and become empowered by Sel没ne. After completing the tome, she hid it in the archives of the temple so that it might be found in the future and be used to redeem the Pact. She eventually became the High Moonmistress of Moonshadow Hall despite never speaking a word.
Ashas hopes for the Pacts legacy were ultimately fulfilled in the , when the werewolf High Moonmistress Feena Archwood found the tome and recreated the Pact.
