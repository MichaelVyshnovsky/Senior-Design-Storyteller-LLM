Akana Kiku was a wu jen adventurer in Kozakura in 1357 DR and 1358 DR.
Kiku studied wu jen arts under the Grey Master of Okazara. After his death in 1354 DR she began to travel to Kozakura. Kiku had many problems with male fighters always considering her weak and unfit to fight. She always defeated her opponents, hoping that they would understand their fault, but realized that this would not happen around where she operated. She liked buying clothing and objects like flowers, gems, and shiny metal, but quickly became bored of them, thus constantly needing money to buy new ones. 
In 1357 DR, Kiku was among the candidates evalued by Ko Mei Kho for the mission in Akari.
In 1358 DR, she had decided to settle in Shou Lung, a more civilized place even for women, where she was possibly approached by Ko Ho San.
