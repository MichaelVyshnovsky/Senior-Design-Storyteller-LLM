'''Dwak''' was a hulking [[ogre]] bouncer at the [[Bubbling Bulwark]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was responsible for guarding the main public door to the establishment, while [[Louella Bonecracker]] guarded the private inner door.

Dwak rather liked [[Annalise]], one of the barmaids.
