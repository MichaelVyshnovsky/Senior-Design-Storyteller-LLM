'''Benryn''' was a man that lived on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was married to a woman named [[Mirileth]], whom he loved very much.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Benryn and Mirileth spent some time at the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn, which was found on the [[Risen Road]] west of [[Elturel]]. The two were carrying with them a dowry for Mirileth's sister's wedding: a simple ring of [[gold]].

Unfortunately, the couple's stay was interrupted, when [[goblin]] raiders from the [[Cult of the Absolute]] assailed the inn and set it aflame. Benryn remained trapped in the inn's upper story, while Mirileth, who remained outside, was not so fortunate.
