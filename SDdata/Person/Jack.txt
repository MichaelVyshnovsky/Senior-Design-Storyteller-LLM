'''Jack''' was a mysterious [[Red Wizard]] agent from the eastern nation of [[Thay]], active in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Jack was a powerful spellcaster who used the school of [[necromancy]] in service of the Red Wizards. He possessed magics that temporarily made him invulnerable to magic and melee attacks. His favorite offensive magics included deadly ''[[black vapors]]'' and ''[[death bolt]]s''. Jack commanded a small force of [[boneshard]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[blazing skeleton]]s, [[chillborn zombie|chillborns]], and [[zombie]]s.

==History==
Following the years of [[Spellplague]] sowing chaos in the city of [[Neverwinter]], Jack was found performing his foul necromantic experiments in the [[Neverdeath]] graveyard of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR. The mad Red Wizard's laboratory was hidden within the ruins of ancient [[Illefarn]], the fact that became known to [[Dagult Neverember|Lord Never]] after Jack's correspondence was recovered by a band of heroes after venturing into the [[undead]]-infested Neverdeath. A group of heroes was soon after dispatched to Jack's laboratory by [[Doomguide]] [[Volahk]] who feared yet another grave plot of [[Thay]].
