Fenmaer was a disciple of Corellon Larethian in Luskan during the late 15 century DR.
Fenmaer was bald and wore heavy black armor.
Fenmaer and his companions met up in Athkatla sometime prior to 1490 DR, for what they had believed was to be a simple journey to Baldurs Gate. Over time, they traveled up the Sword Coast, first through Waterdeep and then Neverwinter, in order to reach their final destination of Icewind Dale. However, Fenmaer could not make the final leg of the trip, and was forced to remain in Luskan, where he awaited his companions return. While in Luskan, Fenmaer encountered the Champion of the Burning Dawn while staying in a small abode in the Luskan market district.
