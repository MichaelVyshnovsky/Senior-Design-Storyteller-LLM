The dark naga hated Mystra, the goddess of magic, and attempted to defile the Shrine of the Silver Fire nearby. The shrine was maintained by two guardian naga priestesses of the Lady of Mysteryâ€”Ethe and Gloran. Gulrithi lured the clerics into a magical trap. The two nagas remained in stasis until a group of adventurers known as the Veiled Ones slew Gulrithi and his mohrgs and master wights. The heroes broke the head pole that maintained the stasis trap, releasing the Sisters of the Silver Fire."
