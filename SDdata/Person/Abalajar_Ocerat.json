        "mainbody": "Abalajar Ocerat was a human mage-killer from Thay in the 14 century DR who wandered Faerûn to seek out and kill all wizards he came across.\nAbalajar had an abiding hatred for wizards and saw them all as evil. He found that he could not live in a world where they had infiltrated all aspects of life and society, and so he set out to do something about it. Although he knew he could not feasibly kill all wizards, he felt that each killing helped make Faerûn a slightly better place.\nHe was deeply traumatized by his parents murder at the hands of the Red Wizards when under great stress he suffered delusions where he relived the moments leading up to their deaths.\nAlthough he felt they were worthy of respect, Abalajar chose not to follow any particular deity.\nAbalajars fighting style was influenced by his opponent of choice. He preferred weakening his enemies with spells before closing on them with physical attacks. He favored ray-type and touch-type spells such as ray of exhaustion and touch of idiocy for this purpose.\nDespite his intolerance for wizards, Abalajar was actually an accomplished diviner in his own right, capable of casting many advanced spells like Rarys mnemonic enhancer, kiss of the vampire, and Simbuls spell matrix.\nAbalajar possessed a rare innate talent allowing him to cast arcane spells as divine magic. This made it very difficult for his wizardly opponents to determine what spell he was casting.\nHe carried multiple weapons, including a masterwork longsword, short sword, and composite longbow. He wore a magical chain shirt in combat, as well as a vest of resistance, a ring of counterspells, and three pearls of power.\nHe carefully planned each of his wizard kills in advance, sometimes spending weeks observing his victim. He preferred catching his prey when they were alone and isolated, but occasionally found himself forced to fight bodyguards and the like. Abalajar did his best to ensure the permanent death of his victims, making sure only prohibitively expensive magic could bring them back to life.\nHe spent the majority of his time alone, but would occasionally travel with groups provided they did not include any users of arcane magic.\nAbalajar was born into a family of farmers in the Thayan tharch of Priador. He displayed no signs of magical ability as a child, and so was left to grow up with his family. During his formative years, he witnessed first-hand how the Red Wizards brutally mistreated the people of Thay. When his own parents were killed by Red Wizards over a slight breach in etiquette, Abalajar had had enough, and fled the farm as his family burned. He returned shortly after to bury his parents and to retrieve his parents, then journeyed north to begin training as a ranger.\nHis years as a ranger were largely motivated by his desire to kill wizards to avenge his parents. During this time, Abalajar was greatly influenced by an encounter with the halfling Perinsa Falmarya, whose family had also been killed by wizards. She taught Abalajar that he could fight back against his enemies and make something of his life. Although he tried to suppress it, Abalajar also felt a growing innate talent for magic during these years. He eventually met a man who suggested Abalajar embrace magic and use it to strike back at his hated wizards. Abalajar took this to heart, spending several years studying magic and practicing fighting \"lesser\" spellcasters, culminating in his first kill of an actual wizard.\nFollowing the slaying of his first wizard, Abalajar followed the path of the mage-killer, wandering Faerûn and marking arcane adherents for death. He was known to have slain over forty wizards all in all, with most of them failing to return to life. He hoped to one day train several apprentices to carry on his work."
