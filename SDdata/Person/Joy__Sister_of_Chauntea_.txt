Joy was a friar in the Sisters of Chauntea in the 10 century DR.
Following the Orcfastings War, Joy left the Abbey of Chauntea to go south and provide aid to the people of Nimoars Hold. There she worked inside a stone structure that had been converted to an infirmary and long-term care facility for the Holds veterans. With the aid of her other sisters, she modified the magic wards around the building to amplify healing spells and sustain those close to death.
In the , Warlord Gharl set fire to the fields of Nimoars Hold in an effort to halt the advance of trolls. With ten of her infirmarys occupants being crippled or injured and twenty of them unconicous, they were unable to be evacuated up to Mount Waterdeep. She was unconcerned for her own safety, being determined to guard the people in her care, but she was extremely anxious about her Sisters back at the abbey.
When a group of time-displaced adventurers from the 15 century DR came to Nimoars Hold during the fire, she begged them to go and provide aid to her sisters back at the Abbey of Chauntea.
