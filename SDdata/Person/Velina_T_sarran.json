        "mainbody": "'''Velina T'sarran''' was a [[drow]] [[cleric]] of [[Kiaransalee]] and one of the twin nieces of [[Dorina T'sarran]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "A strongly built female drow, Velina had a rounder face than most other drow. She wore darkened drow [[chainmail]] and wrapped herself in a large black cloak. A prominent symbol of Kiaransalee was often displayed around her neck. Velina appeared identical in practically every way to her sister, Velasta.",
        "Personality": "Velina T'sarran was a drow of erratic moods, alternating between haughty and charming when dealing with others. However, she harbored nothing but contempt for her twin sister.",
        "Abilities": "An experienced drow cleric, Velina had a solid command of [[divine magic]] and was able to cast spells like ''[[flame strike]]'' and ''[[slay living]]'' in defense of her deity. In addition to this, she could craft both [[magic]]al [[weapon|arms]] and [[armor]], and magic [[wand]]s.\n\nVelina, like her sister, was an adaptive combatant and could adjust her tactics effectively when given the opportunity or when prepared.",
        "Possessions": "As a member of [[House T'sarran]], Velian was outfitted with gear befitting a priestess of her station. She wore a [[magic]] set of ''[[elven chain|drow chain]]'', a ''[[cloak of resistance]]'', and a ''[[ring of counterspells]]''. In combat, she would wield a ''[[corrosive]] [[dagger]]'' and an [[magic|enchanted]] [[shield]].",
        "Relationships": "Velina had a deep rivalry with her identical twin sister, [[Velasta T'sarran]], to the extent that both of them would happily engineer situations where the other could be \"accidentally\" killed off. This hatred was only exacerbated after the coup of Szith Morcane, when Velasta acquired the larger share of the plunder.",
        "History": "As a female of House T'sarran, Velina had been schooled as a cleric of Kiaransalee along with her identical twin sister, Velasta. However, over the years, both sisters had developed an abiding hatred for each other.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, during the [[Silence of Lolth]], Velina and her sister worked with the rest of their house to overthrow the [[Lolth]]-worshiping drow of [[Maerimydra]]. Subsequently, they were sent to track down any refugees from the city under the supervision of their aunt, Dorina, and made their way to the drow outpost of [[Szith Morcane]].\n\nWhile her sister was made part of the elite hunter-killer team by Dorina, Velina was assigned to lead the common raiding parties against the surface lands of [[Daggerdale]]. She harried a number of farms and homesteads in the [[Dagger Hills]], roughly {{SIrange|3|4|mile|k|long=yes}} from the [[Dordrien|Dordrien Crypts]]\n\nAt some point after a group of adventurers launched a raid on Szith Morcane, Velina and Velasta were raised as [[undead]] [[revenant]]s."
