'''Tebessa al-Khawati''' was a leader among the [[desert centaur]]s in the [[Burning Lands]] near [[Moradask]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Tebessa kept her hair short and rarely combed it. Her face was weathered from long exposure to the sun, framing her fiery green eyes. Though she lead the hard life of a desert nomad, Tebessa looked far younger than her 80 years.

The lower half of her body resembled that of a stout [[pony]] with the slim legs of a [[gazelle]].

==Personality==
Tebessa was blunt and honest. As such she was easily deceived. She preferred swift action to careful planning.

==Activities==
Tebessa was the leader of the [[Khawati Clan]] in 1367 DR. As a natural warrior and hunter, she preferred to leave the heavy thinking to the clan's priestess [[Narur al-Khawati]].

==History==
Tebessa was captured by [[Shorn]] cultists one night while bathing alone at an oasis near Moradusk. Infuriated by her dark curly hair, the cult's leader decided to have her entire body shaved, including her precious warrior's braid. Tebessa was able to escape with the aid of her sister, but not before her warrior's braid was removed. Tebessa never forgave the Shorn for the violation, and vowed to see them destroyed.

==Possessions==
Tebessa carried a magical [[battleaxe]] named ''[[windbiter]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]]'', a ''[[Potion of giant strength|potion of hill giant strength]]'', a [[composite longbow]], and several valuable [[gems]]. She carried her gear on an ornate [[Leather armor|leather harness]] worn on her upper body.

==Relationships==
Tebessa was the younger sister of the clan's priestess Narur.
