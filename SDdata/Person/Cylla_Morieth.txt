'''Cylla Morieth''' was a magic instructor in [[Lyrabar]] on {{yearlink|1373}} and a Wearer of Purple for the [[Cult of the Dragon]].{{cite book/The Rage||14}}

==Description==
Middle-aged and with impish features, Cylla had brown curls frosted with golden highlights.

==Personality==
It frustrated Cylla endlessly that she was forced to curtsey to nobles and priests in [[Impiltur]], which was part of why she joined the Cult of the Dragon, hoping to bring about a world more favorable to her. She met interrogations with fatalism.

==Abilities==
By [[Uktar 9]] of {{yearlink|1372}}, Cylla could not yet cast [[wall of force]]. On [[Ches 2]] of {{yearlink|1373}}, she cast an illusion to fool [[Taegan Nightwind]] into an ambush, for which she acquired the aid of several [[abishai]], presumably with magic. In the same fight, she employed some legerdemain to steal the [[avariel]]'s strength from a device, and then a different spell to escape, presumably ''[[dimension door]]''. On [[Ches 14]] of that same year amongst other spells, Cylla could cast ''[[steeldance]]'', ''[[shadow spray]]'' and a spell that broke a ''[[silence]]'' spell, almost certainly ''[[dispel silence]]''

==Possessions==
On Uktar 9, Cylla Morieth employed a [[wall of force]] scroll, brought to her by [[Sammaster]].
On Ches 2, Cylla Morieth was in possession of at least 10,000 [[golden lion (coin)|golden lions]], with which she meant to bribe Taegan Nightwind for the return of [[Sammaster]]'s notes as the Wearer of Purple.{{cite book/The Rage||11}}

==Activities==
Besides being a magic instructor, Cylla Morieth was the Wearer of Purple for the local cell of the Cult of the Dragon.

==History==
Cylla Morieth was already a member of the Cult of the Dragon when she joined Sammaster on a trip, on Uktar 9, 1372 DR. Before the Cult, she was just a teacher of minor magic employed to safeguard ships at sea.

After [[Gorstag Helder]] stole Sammaster's notes and took them to [[Taegan Nightwind]], she attempted to buy them off of him, and then bully them off of him, on [[Ches 2]] of 1373 DR.{{cite book/The Rage||12}}

She was captured by Taegan Nightwind's party while in some catacombs beneath Lyrabar on [[Ches 14]]. After some interrogation, she relayed upon them what she had experienced with Sammaster on Uktar 9 of the previous year, in the [[Gray Forest]]. As the maestro vowed to reveal her involvement in the Cult, she was forced to flee Impiltur, never to be seen again.
