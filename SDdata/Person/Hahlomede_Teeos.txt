'''Hahlomede Teeos''', often referred to as '''Blackwyrm''', was one of the eight members of the First Zulkirate and a [[Zulkir]] of [[Abjuration]] in 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Hahlomede Teeos was a Thayan [[human]] male, like most zulkirs at the time. He built an aura of mystery about himself, something he truly enjoyed. He was never seen wearing anything but his tattered black [[robe]]s and [[cloak]]s, which were [[enchanted]] to protect against [[dragons]] and make the wyrms actively avoid the wizard.

==History==
Hahlomede became the first member of the [[Council of Zulkirs]] from the [[school of magic|school of abjuration magic]] in the autumn of the {{YearlinkName|1030}}. The council was assembled under the [[diviner]] [[lich]] [[Ythazz Buvaar]]. The title allowed Hahlomede to select the [[tharchion]]s and gave him absolute control over a sliver of Thay. When he was not scheming or governing, the new Zulkir of Abjuration liked to track down lost treasures and ancient magic and weaved complex and cunning deceptions, which made him disliked by his peers. His reputation turned even sourer, to being feared and hated, after he became the investigator of the First Zulkirate.

The wizard's reign as the Zullkir of Abjuration came to an end some time before the late {{YearlinkName|1300}}.
