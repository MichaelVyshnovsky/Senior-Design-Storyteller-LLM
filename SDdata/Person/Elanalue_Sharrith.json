        "mainbody": "'''Elanalue Sharrith''' was a [[treespeaker]] priestess of [[Mielikki]] of the [[Border Forest]] in the [[Dalelands]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the last known bearer of the holy [[Mielikkian]] [[spellbook]] known as ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]''.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1335}}, Elanalue was captured by [[drow]] and taken into slavery in the [[Underdark]]. The fate of the ''Companion'' was unknownâ€”no one knew if Elanalue had managed to stash the book before the drow caught her, or if she lost it in the chase and the fight, or if the drow seized it as well. \n\nAs of [[1368 DR]], at least six [[adventuring companies]] had gone in search of Elanalue Sharrith, the last being the [[Dwarves of Destiny]] in [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1361}}. But none had succeeded, or even returned. With the ''Companion'' lost, the church of Mielikki could do naught but keep \"an eye out for it\" and try to reclaim it they ever learned of it. In any case, this marked the second breaking of the 'Rightful Cycle' of ownership of the ''Companion''."
