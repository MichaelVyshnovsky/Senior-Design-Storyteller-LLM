The fate of the Companion was unknownâ€”no one knew if Elanalue had managed to stash the book before the drow caught her, or if she lost it in the chase and the fight, or if the drow seized it as well. \nAs of 1368 DR, at least six adventuring companies had gone in search of Elanalue Sharrith, the last being the Dwarves of Destiny in Eleint of the .
