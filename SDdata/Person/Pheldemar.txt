Pheldemar Daunthrae was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 14 century DR.
Curious and decisive, Pheldemar used an unknown magical item to destroy a helmed horror just to see what it did.
Pheldemar Daunthrae had steel-gray hair and a face wrinkled enough to resemble a worn boot. While watching over the sanctum, he wore battle-leathers, a leather overcoat, and a long white glove with a flaring cut.
Pheldemar was part of the retinue protecting Vangerdahast in his sanctum near Mouth o Gargoyles after retirement.
He had some latent conflicts with Brorm, a fellow War Wizard who hurled spells too close to their sanctum. He had some history with Thaerma, which made the prospect of returning to her unpleasant.
He used a rod of some sort that allowed him to call shielding magic upon himself. The rod was long and black with tiny spikes and spires, all of them flashing with radiances of different colors. This rod was also able to blast targets with conjured water.
Pheldemar Daunthrae was one of the guardians at the sanctum where Vangerdahast was protected in the , after his retirement. He came out to investigate the explosions caused by Aumun Tholant Bezrar and Malakar Surth when they attacked the sanctum as Harnrim Staranghs vanguard. He almost apprehended the men, but they escaped him, leaving Pheldemar badly bruised he was only able to seize one of their explosives, which he tested against one of the helmed horrors kept around as scouts.
He later gave a debriefing of the situation to Huldyl Rauthur, explaining his testing of the explosives, and the total losses, which amounted to eight helmed horrors. Huldyl ordered him to return to the Royal Court to get his wounds looked at.
