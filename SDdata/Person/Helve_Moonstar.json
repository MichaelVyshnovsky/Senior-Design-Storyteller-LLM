Helve secretly feared that his heir, Rober Moonstar, didnt have the qualities needed to lead the house, so he tested all his nieces and nephews hoping to find a better candidate.\nHelve was an officer in the City Guards cavalry until an accident ended his career. To the delight of his father, he devoted himself to his familys businesses. The business prospered thanks to his wifes guidance."
