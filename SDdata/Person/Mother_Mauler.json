        "mainbody": "The '''Mother Mauler''' was a unique infamous [[anaxim]] that roamed the [[Glaur Barrens]] of [[Gontal]], in [[Laerakond]].{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|82}}",
        "Description": "The Mother Mauler was squat, squarish \"mauler\"-type anaxim, as big as a large shack. It had a cavernous mouth full of whirring blades that served as its teeth, and its metallic mandibles reached from each side of its body and served it as arms. The Mother Mauler had massive metallic legs with splayed feet that allowed it to move in any kind of terrain.",
        "History": "As of [[1479 DR]], the Mother Mauler was hundreds of years old. Many explorers of the Glaur Barrens believed the Mother Mauler was the original anaxim that served as the inspiration for the creation of the smaller \"mauler\"-type anaxims."
