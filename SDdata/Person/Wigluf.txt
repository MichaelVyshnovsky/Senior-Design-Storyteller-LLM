Wigluf was a stone giant who helped Blagothkus in managing the flying Skyreach Castle.
Wigluf was very concerned about Blagothkus plan to ally with dragons and the Cult of the Dragon. He was scared that the consequences for giant kind would be terrible, but he supported Blagothkus out of loyalty.
Wigluf and his companion Hulda were guests at Skyreach Castle. Wigluf tried to use a magic cauldron to interrogate the giant pantheon about Blagothkuss plan.
