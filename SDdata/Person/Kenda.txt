Father '''Kenda''' was a [[priest]] at the [[temple of Savras (Port Nyanzaru)|Temple]] of [[Savras]] in [[Port Nyanzaru]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was an assistant to the head priest, [[Grandfather Zitembe]].

==History==
During the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} Father Kenda conspired with the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] to assassinate Grandfather Zitembe. When a mob of bandits attacked the temple, their [[assassin]] attempted to slip inside unnoticed while Father Kenda fled at the same time. He headed to the [[Grand Coliseum|Coliseum]] to hide during the fallout, and thus did not realize that Zitembe had survived until a group of [[adventurer]]s came looking for him on the head priest's behalf.
