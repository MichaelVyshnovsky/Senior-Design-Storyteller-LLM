'''Breex Vandermast''' was an evil [[half-orc]] [[sorcerer]] living in [[Hillsfar]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Shackles of Blood|12}}

==Personality==
Breex was intelligent but nasty and cruel and was irritatingly over-confident individual who always ready with a cutting insult. His mind was filled with thoughts of money, even knowing that if the First Lord discovered his business he could expect a rather terrible punishment. He was shockingly prejudiced against non-humans, but if anyone criticized his [[orc]]ish ancestry, Breex flew into a rage.

==History==
Breex lived in Hillsfar, carefully disguised as a [[human]]. ''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], he approached Captain [[Haakon Erlich]] of the [[Red Plumes]] with an idea to become rich: kidnap non-human farmers from around the city and sell them to the [[Hillsfar Arena]]. Haakon agreed and they captured many people, included the [[halfling]] [[Tinfellow]] family and the [[drow]] [[Arrizz]]. At last, Breex and the corrupt Red Plumes tried to capture an adventuring party hired by the [[Harpers]] to find the kidnapped people.{{Cite adventurers league/Shackles of Blood|23}}
