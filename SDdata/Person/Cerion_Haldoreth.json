        "History": "Following the [[Siege of Neverwinter]], in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Cerion went to the [[Neverwinter Guard]] post in the [[Tower District]] and met with Captain [[Janros]] to offer the services of elf archers in defending the district against the occupying [[Many-Arrows]] [[orc]]s, as the land had once been part of [[Illefarn]]. He recruited an [[elf]] [[adventurer]] working with the Guard to place magical beacons in the district to guide the elf archers. He then had the adventurer slay orc sappers tunneling under the city."
