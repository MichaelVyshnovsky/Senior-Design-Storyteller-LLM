'''Qoha'dar''' was a [[human]] [[sha'ir]] who lived in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Qoha'dar spent a great deal of time making sure she was always presentable for someone of her lofty station.

==Personality==
Qoha'dar's pleasant personality was often hidden by her pretentious exterior facade.

==Activities==
Joining the [[Magical Legion]] was Qoha'dar's main goal.

==History==
Originally hailing from an affluent family in [[Muluk]], Qoha'dar visited Huzuz on her pilgrimage and opted to stay in the City of Delights.

==Relationships==
The sha'ir was always attended by her [[gen]], [[Ali]], and a [[mamluk]] bodyguard named [[Farim]], with whom she was infatuated. Due to past excursions, Qoha'dar had a healthy relationship with the [[jann]], who answered her calls immediately.

==Possessions==
Qoha'dar enjoyed flaunting her wealth by wearing embroidered robes, [[opal]] earrings, a [[garnet]] anklet, and by keeping a jeweled ''[[jambiya]]'' strapped to her waist. She also owned a staff enchanted with a ''[[continual light]]'' spell, a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]'', a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]'', a ''[[cloak of protection]]'', and several magical [[scroll]]s.
