Nalifarn was an durzagon alchemist and chieftain around 1485 DR.
Nalifarn led a clan of duergar. In 1485 DR, he was approached by the pit fiend Baazka, who offered an alliance with his Red Wizard masters. Nalifarn accepted and, with the Red Wizards help, took control of the Firehammer Hold. In exchange, the durzagon started manufacturing weapons for the Thayans. Nalifarn planned to make the Hold a permanent duergar outpost.
Later, he was killed by an adventuring party hired to search for Jekk Ironfist.
