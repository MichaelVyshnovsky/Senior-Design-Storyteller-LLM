{{Quote|Hells take you! Look what you've done to [[Lewy Jons' hog|my pig]]!}}

'''Lewy Jons''' was a male [[human]] inhabitant of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
[[File:Lewy and pig.jpg|left|thumb|Lewy's and his pig's fate]]
Lewy was a farmer of the West Harbor. Once, he took a bard into the [[Mere of Dead Men|swamp]], who did not return.

In the [[Harvest Fair]], Lewy attempted to win at the hog contest, cheating by using magic to enlarge his pig. [[Orlen]] had doubts and tasked the [[Kalach-Cha]] to investigate; Lewy was prepared to bribe the Kalach-Cha to avoid being exposed. After the Harvest Fair, however, Lewy and his hog were killed by the [[duergar]] and [[bladeling]]s.
