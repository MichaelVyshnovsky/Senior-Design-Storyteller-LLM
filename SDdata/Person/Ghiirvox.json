        "Personality": "Ghiirvox was very reserved and calculating for a [[tanarukk]]. He suspected rightly that the Grand Bloodreaver [[Jeervan]], a follower of [[Garagos]], would soon move to supplant him as warchief.",
        "Description": "Unusual for a tanarukk, Ghiirvox had violet-blue skin, suggesting a very particular [[demon]] among his ancestors.",
        "History": "Ghiirvox was a veteran of twelve conflicts in the [[Underdark]]. He ascended to his current position when his predecessor succumbed to [[Araumycos]]'s madness. In 1479 DR, his position was threatened by Garagos' worshipers, who were spreading in the Legion, and their leader Jeervan."
