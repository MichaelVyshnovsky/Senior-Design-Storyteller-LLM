Haroushin was an ethoist priest of Zann inhabiting Muluk in .
Haroushin was in his early 30s in 1367 DR. He stood  tall. His skin was pale white from spending so much time within the library of the mosque of Zann in Muluk. He had a generally pudgy appearance.
Because of his extensive studies, Haroushin was an expert in the fields of astrology, mathematics, literature, engineering, and priestly spellcraft. He was also quite skilled as a linguist in ancient languages including Noga, Kadari, Old Anwahran, and Ancient Salamic. He also spoke the Common tongue of foreigners and the languages of Zakharas genies and giants.
Haroushin wore a ring of protection. His holy symbol was a worn silver medallion. He wore a large traditional ceremonial dolman that had pockets large enough to contain a magnification lens, a small telescope, a prism, a gem of seeing, and several potions of flying and extra-healing.
Haroushin was focused solely on his duties at the library. He cared little for the politics of the clerical hierarchy, hence his slow advancement through the clerical ranks. Despite this, he was well respected for his accumulation of knowledge and scholarly expertise. His research frequently led to the discovery of ancient ruins and treasures.
