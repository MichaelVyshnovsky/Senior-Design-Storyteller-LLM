'''Haroushin''' was an [[ethoist]] [[priest]] of [[Zann]] inhabiting [[Muluk]] in {{Yearlink|1367}}.{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Haroushin was in his early 30s in 1367 DR. He stood {{SI|5'11|'"|c|long=yes}} tall. His skin was pale white from spending so much time within the library of the mosque of Zann in Muluk. He had a generally pudgy appearance.

==Abilities==
Because of his extensive studies, Haroushin was an expert in the fields of [[astrology]], [[mathematics]], literature, [[engineering]], and [[Divine magic|priestly spellcraft]]. He was also quite skilled as a linguist in ancient languages including [[Noga]], [[Kadari]], [[Old Anwahran]], and [[Ancient Salamic]]. He also spoke the [[Common]] tongue of foreigners and the languages of [[Zakhara]]'s [[genie]]s and [[giant]]s.

==Possessions==
Haroushin wore a ''[[ring of protection]]''. His [[holy symbol]] was a worn [[silver]] medallion. He wore a large traditional ceremonial ''[[dolman]]'' that had pockets large enough to contain a [[magnifying glass|magnification lens]], a small telescope, a prism, a ''[[gem of seeing]]'', and several [[potion]]s of ''[[potion of flying|flying]]'' and ''[[Potion of extra-healing|extra-healing]]''.

==Activities==
Haroushin was focused solely on his duties at the library. He cared little for the politics of the clerical hierarchy, hence his slow advancement through the clerical ranks. Despite this, he was well respected for his accumulation of knowledge and scholarly expertise. His research frequently led to the discovery of ancient ruins and treasures.
