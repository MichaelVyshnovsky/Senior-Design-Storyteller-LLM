King '''Teirgoh''' was a [[dwarf]] king who was put in a seemingly eternal coma by the [[drow]] minions of [[Xanathar]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Some time in the past, the ancestors of Teirgoh's clan were forced to the surface by evil creatures. Here, their numbers diminished, and they were in dire need. Thus, the king led the rest of the clan underground in search of their original home.

By using his secret royal knowledge, he successfully discovered the stone-carved halls. Whilst the dwarves slept, a horde of evil [[drow]] charged them, led by [[Shindia Darkeyes]]. In the battle, King Teirgoh was wounded by a poisoned [[dagger]], and lay in eternal sleep.

Later, a group of adventurers recovered an incredibly powerful [[potion of healing|healing potion]] beneath the depths of the dwarven kingdom. The group rushed to the king, and handed it to the [[cleric]] overseeing him. Miraculously, the potion worked, and the old king awoke. He handed them the ''[[Wand of Silvias]]'', an ancient [[wand]] the king did not know much about, other than it may aid them in fighting Xanathar.
