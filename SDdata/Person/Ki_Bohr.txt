Ki Bohr was the head priest of Akari in 1357 DR.
Ki Bohr took care of the shrine to the Path of Enlightenment in the town of Tai Ko. When the ochimo started to spread terror, he tried to stop him through offerings, and also went to Wa to investigate but with no results. Bohr was blamed by Governor Ko Lei Kho for his failure.
Bohr wanted to help stop the evil but was too scared to leave Tai Ko.
