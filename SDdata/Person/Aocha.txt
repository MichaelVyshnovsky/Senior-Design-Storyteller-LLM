'''Aocha''' was a trained docile [[huge spider]] mount that belonged to [[Zack Boosenburry]] of [[Baervan Wildwanderer]] ''circa'' [[1312 DR]].

==Description==
Aocha had brownish markers and wore a narrow, almost invisible [[leather]] [[collar (animal)|collar]] connected to a set of delicate reins. She was a docile beast that did not attack or scurried away from [[humanoid]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Aocha accompanied her master, [[illusionist]] [[gnome]] Zack Boosenburry to a newly erected ice temple of [[Auril]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. Zack attempted to investigate the strange structure but was ambushed and fed to a [[remorhaz]] controlled by the goddess's cult. Aocha was taken to a cell filled with [[deer]], the food storage used to feed the Aurilan monsters. Miraculously, Zack Boosenburry survived inside the remorhaz for several days until he was cut out of the monster by a group of mercenaries from [[Targos]] working against the cult of Auril. Aocha was reunited with her master shortly after.
