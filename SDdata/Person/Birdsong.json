        "mainbody": "irdsong was a tabaxi bard who lived in Chult in the late 15 century DR. She worked at varying times as a minstrel, a merchant, and an adventurer.\nShe had brown fur with dark brown markings, and yellow eyes. Birdsong wore leather armor over a blue tunic and green trousers.\nBirdsong was a cunning tabaxi woman who harbored great aspirations. She was a talented and inspiring player of the lute.\nBy the late 15 century DR, she was in a romantic relationship with Vanessa, a templar of the Order of the Gauntlet stationed at Camp Vengeance. Because such templars were not permitted to mingle with the civilian locals, they kept their relationship a secret. Evens so, Birdsong had composed and performed songs about their love in Port Nyanzaru.\nBirdsong was heavily armed, carrying both a short sword and a larger blade, in addition to her lutes. She owned several of the musical instruments including a Doss lute, a lavish gold-inlaid lute that could be heard over great distances, a magical masterwork lute of rest, an the enchanted Singing Wind. Among short swords she owned were a simple iron shortsword, a lighter and sharper steel shortsword, a magical singing sword, an enchanted sword of sharpness, and a legendary blade the Fang said to be made out of Shagambis tooth.\nWhen she was very young, Birdsongs village was destroyed and enslaved by yuan-ti. Although she grew up as a slave, Birdsong quickly discovered she had a talent for the bardic arts. Playing her lute, Birdsongs music had a profound effect on her fellow slaves. After escaping the yuan-ti slavers, Birdsong vowed to one day get revenge. She became known as one of the greatest minstrels in all of Chult.\nDuring the events of the death curse, Birdsong allied herself with the likes of the jungle guide Eku, the adventurers Artus Cimber and Dragonbait, the aarakocra elder Asharra, and the druid Qawasha to help investigate and stop the curse.\nOn or just before the 14th of Alturiak that followed the appearance of the death curse, Birdsong was traveling with a merchant caravan from Port Nyanzaru to Camp Vengeance when they were attacked by a flesh golem. The survivors were rescued by an old woman named Nanny Pupu and given shelter at her home in Mbala, only for it to be revealed that the old woman was in fact a green hag. The merchants were all killed with the exception of Birdsong, who was kept as a prisoner to entertain the hag before she was rescued by adventurers sent to look for her by a concerned Vanessa."
