        "mainbody": "Mijel Morigan was a distinguished mage and retired adventurer who lived in the city of Ravens Bluff, during the late 14 century DR, with his wife Jandra and daughter Jelima. Within the citys Swordspoint neighborhood, Mijel and Jandra ran the Kettle of Many Things restaurant, a delightful establishment that specifically catered to wizards and their familiars.\nHe was known for brewing an excellent mead.\nFor some time, Mijel focused on selling arcane components from a small shop he established in the north end of the Kettle, Morigans Complete Components. However, competition from Bendekars Mercantile forced him to refocus his efforts, and instead sell spices to local cooks and housekeepers."
