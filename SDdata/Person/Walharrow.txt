Captain Walharrow was a minotaur pirate and inmate of Grimshackle Jail in Phlan.
Walharrow was a feared pirate captain. At one point, however, he was captured and jailed at Grimshackle Jail.
In 1489 DR, the corrupt jailer Iorg Brokenjaw, in order to free Rathene Fel, let Walharrow break free to use him as diversion. The minotaur pirate rampaged through the jail until an adventuring party there to interrogate Rathene confronted and defeated him.
Years later, during the events of the death curse, Walharrow was restored to life by the infernal pirate Idrianne Smoke and her patrons within the Nine Hells. When Captain Smokes forces attacked Port Nyanzaru, Walharrow was sent to seize control of the Thundering Lizard inn, causing much bloodshed in the process. This prompted the merchant prince Ekene-Afa to send adventurers to slay him once more.
