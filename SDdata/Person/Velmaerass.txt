'''Velmaerass''' was a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When captured and questioned by [[Elminster]] in the wake of the raid of the [[War Wizards]] on the meeting of the [[Rightful Conspiracy]] in [[Marsember]], [[Cormyr]], during the early spring of the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, [[Thauvas Zlorn]] revealed that he had been praised by Velmaerass for his as-yet-unexecuted plan to use the [[Company of Crazed Venturers]] to retrieve magic for him. Elminster jested that Velmaerass might even reward Thauvas with "a tharch or two", if he lived.While it is unknown who or what Velmaerass is, by the context, Velmaerass is presumed to be Thauvas's superior in the Red Wizards.
