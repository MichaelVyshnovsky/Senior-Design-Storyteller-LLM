Speaker Aldwin Graves was a councilor of Helms Hold who lived in the fortress-city during the late 15 century DR.
Due to his position, he held great sway and influence over the people of his home city.
Aldwin had a protective brother named Corlan as well as a wife, for whom he greatly cared.
When the Ashmadai overran Helms Hold circa the , Aldwin ignored the warnings of his brother and remained in his home on Scar Alley. The devil-worshiping cultists briefly kidnapped the councilman, but were thwarted by the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge, who was hired by Corlan.
After the incident, Councilor Graves agreed to go into hiding, though it was believed to be more for the safety of his wife rather than his own well-being.
