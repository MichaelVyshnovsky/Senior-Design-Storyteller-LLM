Nareen Dhest was a thief and a member of the Hand of Yartar during the late 15 century DR.
In 1491 DR, a patrol of the Twelve near Triboar had defeated some cultists of the Cult of the Eternal Flame and recovered a devastation orb. They went back to Yartar with the orb, but just after they put it in the citys vaults, Nareen stole it. After examining it, the Hands of Yartar decided to sell it in an auction at the Wink and Kiss tavern in Yartar.
Protected by some bodyguards, Nareen managed the auction but the interventions of some adventurers and of the Kraken Society ruined the sale.
