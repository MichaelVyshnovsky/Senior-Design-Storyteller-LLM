        "mainbody": "'''Perchillux''' was an [[imp]] in [[Avernus]], first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "When the city of [[Elturel]] was transported to Avernus in the {{YearlinkName|1494}}, Perchillux roamed the streets looking to buy the souls of hapless citizens. He discovered the [[halfling]] baker [[Pilster Pebblehuck]] in an alleyway and offered him a deal: enough food for a month for his family in exchange for his very soul. Desperate, Pilster considered signing but adventurers might have intervened then, possibly determining the contract to be a trap that would have given Perchillux not just Pilster's soul, but those of all his family, and slaying or scaring the imp off.",
        "Possessions": "Perchillux presented Pilster with a densely written and convoluted contract printed on parchment made from halfling skin.\n\nHe possessed a ''[[soul coin]]'' from a former trade."
