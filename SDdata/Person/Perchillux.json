        "mainbody": "Perchillux was an imp in Avernus, first layer of the Nine Hells, in the late 15 century DR.\nWhen the city of Elturel was transported to Avernus in the , Perchillux roamed the streets looking to buy the souls of hapless citizens. He discovered the halfling baker Pilster Pebblehuck in an alleyway and offered him a deal enough food for a month for his family in exchange for his very soul. Desperate, Pilster considered signing but adventurers might have intervened then, possibly determining the contract to be a trap that would have given Perchillux not just Pilsters soul, but those of all his family, and slaying or scaring the imp off.\nPerchillux presented Pilster with a densely written and convoluted contract printed on parchment made from halfling skin.\nHe possessed a soul coin from a former trade."
