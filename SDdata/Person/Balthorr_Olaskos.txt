Balthorr "the Bold" Olaskos was a fence and trader in Waterdeep who specialized primarily in currency, coins, and various rare trinkets during the mid-to-late 14th century DR. 
Olaskos was often able to relate a story about any particular item on the spot. He operated out of his store, Balthorrs Rare and Wondrous Treasures within the city. His honesty was belled by his willingness to purchase coins, gems and regalia with no questions, but his suspected "hot" items were obtained at 40% the market value. 
Balthorr was also a spy for the Shadow Thieves, becoming more involved in their affairs once they returned to Waterdeep.
