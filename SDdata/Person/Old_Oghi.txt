Old Oghi was a massive and powerful bear that resided within the Dragonbone Vale of the Sword Mountains in the late 15 century DR.
For some unknown reason, animals born in the Dragonbone Vale were fiercer and bigger than their kin. Old Oghi was a prime example of that.
By the late 15 century DR, Old Oghi was well known to the rangers that frequented the mountain valley. One story told of a young blue dragon killing a deer and Oghi fearlessly charging at the wyrm and scaring it off with a terrifying, earth-shattering roar, claiming the meat.
When the Cult of the Dragon claimed the Dragonbone Vale, Old Oghi became a target of a hunt with adventurers being offered a hefty reward for the successful hunt. It is unknown if Old Oghi was felled by the adventurers swords.
