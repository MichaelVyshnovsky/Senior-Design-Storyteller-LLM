'''Byuchyuch''' was a [[goblin]] slave of [[House Do'Urden]] in the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]].

==History==
Byuchyuch became an "indentured servant" to House Do'Urden circa [[1307 DR]].

In or around [[1317 DR]], he was summoned by [[Maya Do'Urden|Maya]] and [[Malice Do'Urden]] to play a part in their plan to force [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] to shed blood before entering [[Melee-Magthere]], the drow fighters' academy. Malice magically turned Byuchyuch's appearance into that of a drow and Maya presented him as her champion, challenging Drizzt to a fight. Drizzt easily overcame the poor fighter. While Byuchyuch was helpless, Drizzt was magically compelled by Malice to kill him. Doing so made Byuchyuch the first being Drizzt had killed.
