Hertvor Dremble was a hireling guard who worked for Baldurs Mouth in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Hertvor was a human man with a tan skin tone, hazel eyes, and long, wavy brown hair. Like his fellow guards, Hertvor wore chainmail armor and wielded a simple spear.
In the , Hertvor Dremble was employed by Baldurs Mouth and its editor-in-chief, Ettvard Needle. He was tasked with guarding the broadsheets entryway, just past the main doors into the building. Hertvor found it odd the Gazette employed so many guards and was protected by the steel watchers. He also found the old saying "the pen really was mightier than the sword" quite questionable.
