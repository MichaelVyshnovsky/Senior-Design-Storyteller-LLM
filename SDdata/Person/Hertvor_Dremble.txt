'''Hertvor Dremble''' was a hireling guard who worked for [[Baldur's Mouth]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Hertvor was a [[human]] man with a tan skin tone, hazel eyes, and long, wavy brown hair. Like his fellow guards, Hertvor wore [[chainmail]] armor and wielded a simple [[spear]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Hertvor Dremble was employed by Baldur's Mouth and its editor-in-chief, [[Ettvard Needle]]. He was tasked with guarding the broadsheet's entryway, just past the main doors into the building. Hertvor found it odd the ''Gazette'' employed so many guards and was protected by the [[steel watcher]]s. He also found the old saying "the pen really was mightier than the sword" quite questionable.
