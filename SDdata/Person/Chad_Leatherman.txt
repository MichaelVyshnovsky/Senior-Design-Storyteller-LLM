Chad Leatherman was a harness maker in the city of Ravens Bluff, living on Iron Bell Street, in the 14 century DR.
Chad built a variety of harnesses for beasts of burden to pull carts or wagons.
Chad was good friends with Norge Greenback, who lived a few doors down from him and used a great deal of Chads harnesses at his store.
