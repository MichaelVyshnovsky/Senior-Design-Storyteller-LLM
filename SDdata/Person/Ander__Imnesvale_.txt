==Description==
Ander was a [[human]] man with long hair and light skin who wore olive-colored commoner's garb.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the village of Imnesvale faced a slew of disappearances and locals did not hesitate to blame the legendary [[Umar Witch]]. Ander, along with his wife [[Johanna]], spent much of his free time in the [[Umar Inn]] but avoided interacting with strangers out of fear.
