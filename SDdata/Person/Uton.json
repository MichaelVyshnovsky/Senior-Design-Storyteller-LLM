        "mainbody": "Uton was a crusader of Selûne and a member of the Knights of the Half Moon at the House of the Moon temple in Waterdeep in the mid–14th century DR.While Uton and the others are not mentioned to be crusaders or members of the Order of the Half Moon in \"Lunatics\", the Order invented in the later Powers & Pantheons is undoubtedly based on these characters in the comic.\nOne night during the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, while a purported avatar of the goddess resided at the House of the Moon, Uton and a fellow Knight called out Onyx and Timoth as they infiltrated the temple in robes stolen from the Knights standing guard at the entrance. Timoth claimed they were new converts Uton queried the poor fit of their robes, but Timoth argued fitted robes were in short supply and they made a speedy departure. Uton remained suspicious, and alerted High Priestess Naneatha Suaril. Onyx and Timoth were caught and divested of their robes, and Naneatha left hell hounds to deal with them instead.\nUton was a pale-skinned man with a shaven head and a silver crescent moon on his forehead,"
