'''Dornavver''' was a master sword-smith of the 3rd century [[DR]], who forged the legendary sword ''[[Dornavver]]'', the "Demonbane".

==History==
To counter the growing spread of evil under the [[Shoon Imperium]] and a plethora of evil artifacts fashioned at the time, the [[Church of Ilmater]] sought a weapon to combat such evil. To this end, Dornavver forged for them a [[bastard sword]], with a multicolored blade of an unknown alloy and a silver-plated crosspiece. The symbol of [[Ilmater]] was etched into the pommel. This sword was completed in the [[275 DR|Year of the Wrath Sword, 275 DR]]. It was named ''[[Dornavver]]'' after the smith.

On the night of the [[Feast of the Moon]] that same year, senior clergy of Ilmater took the sword to [[Allyn's Anvil]] in the [[Alimir Mountains]] east of [[Calimshan]], where they enchanted it in an impassioned ritual. These events were documented in the tome ''[[Relics of the Righteous]]''.
